Some poor little girl was about to be brutally raped after a sham marriage to a ISIS fighter and they stopped the ceremony and showed her the article that child weddings are done to make a dying child feel better in America so basically America said fuck you to her specific situation. Doesn't matter because they were all droned to death shortly after her heart broke at the realization of Americas turning its back on her./s  I will mark this comment as SARCASM. It is too difficult to understand the above comment is sarcastic and CNN did not make a news statement as to the above. No child bride and her future rapist were blown up by a drone after being told the US was making light of her situation with a newspaper article. AGAIN THIS IS SARCASM no links exist. You do not have to individually verify the statements, again no child brides were blown up and ISIS does not maintain a US news department so they can add insult to child brides before the US blows them up with drones."

Because it forced her to conform to gender expectations for girls, and also because it taught her that she was expected to date men.  Which is a bullshit argument, because when I was little, both my mother and father would call it a ""date"" if we were going out one-on-one. I had three siblings so those were special occasions.  Anyway, here is the link. I thought it was really cute and the dad was just doing something sweet for his daughter, but my teacher thought it was an omen of the apocalypse or something.  And she had a severe problem with early puberty being called ""precocious puberty"" and was so disappointed that that is the medical term for the condition, because ""precocious"" apparently has a connotation of little girls being too sexual or slutty (???).

At best, one perspective of half the story.  Getting more familiar with her work with emotional manipulations and victimhood, I wonder if she was a major ignition point for arguments and his reactions to them.

Of course, no one asked me about my experience growing up poor in a black neighborhood, being the only white kid in my class. No one asked about my being bullied so much I had to change schools. No one asked about how I got made fun of by the football players because I was a skinny little dude who liked punk rock. All that shit made me hate the world. I totally relinquished my emotions to society. And you know what that did, it made me absolutely miserable. I was so fucking depressed in college I seriously contemplated suicide regularly. After awhile I said fuck that. I went to therapy on campus and told my therapist about all of this. She started me on Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy and I have not reached that level of depression ever since. Yes, the world can suck.

I was talking to my wife about it (who is blessedly sane when it comes to gender issues) every five minutes. I was pointing out this that and the other thing ""See??

I would literally hang out on places like reddit and 4chan so I could find things to be mad about. I would see something annoying and then obsess over it for days, weeks, or even years.   I still have dumb little things that nag at me and make me want to grind my teeth into the ground and feel angry about. I one day sat down when I was feeling normal and said that I would make the irrational decision of not caring when I would get mad about something.When you are mad deciding to not be mad anymore is so weird because it feels like you are totally correct in being angry and being not angry is the wrong decision."

And concerning that men should be put to manual labour if necessary:   Q:Like slaves?  A:Not as slaves, simply as workers performing a duty, in the same way workers today do.

TumblrInAction,3dyn1z,mickeyquinnisabastrd,9,Mon Jul 20 21:42:24 2015 UTC,"Story Time  The school that I'm currently attending brought Glenda Beck in to discuss rape culture during a week long social justice fest. Like above, she only discussed the situations of men raping women and ""educated"" everyone about the sins of having a penis. Following her tirade, the united voices of Valenti's brigade segregated the school's weight room into male and female hours, left up signs around campus exclaiming how ""RAPE CULTURE HAPPENS HERE,"" and if anyone expressed opposing views they claimed their arguers were either rape apologists or that the patriarchy had brainwashed them.  Sad thing is; rather than showing support for both sides of the argument, a lot of administration/staff jumped aboard the Valenti train, so even if there were students searching to process this info all they got was the same shit that this women had been spouting off.  What angers me the most is the lack of empathy that she and those on campus had for anyone (not including online trolls) who didn't follow their exact beliefs. It reminded me of those horror stories former Scientologists told where if someone voiced just the slightest doubt of your beliefs, they were either the enemy or had been brainwashed. To have such stoic backing of any political/social belief can be incredibly dangerous, and to see it occur on the ""higher education"" level really shook me.  I identify as a feminist, I consider myself politically radical, I plan to work with sexual assault survivors as a potential career, but I cannot get behind this ""rape culture"" movement. Demonizing one group of people to save another is not productive, it just burns everything down to the level where we started.

Well, between those two, and mixed, including mixed Carib people, that covers like 95%. They colloquially call mixed afro-indo people dougla (but it always sounded like doo-gloo to me).  There are also White, Chinese, Arab, and others, but they are very small populations.  There is still a lot of racism in Trinidad and Tobago, where darker skin is equated with many negative stereotypes.   The main political parties are also quite split along racial lines. With the PNM being supported by the majority of Afro-trinis and the People's Partnership (which was formerly just the UNC) being more supported by Indo-Trinis.  TL;DR  Trinis are just as likely to be Indian as African, and almost as likely to have a mix of both."

Ending Slavery was only a side effect of the civil war rather than a main component like many perceive it (Slavery would have ended soon anyway but this speed it up by 30 or so years) plus the Confederate flag is actually a battle flag rather than the national flag"

It would be more of a a spy flick, without really any superhero type action, other than some James Bond type action (which is fine), I like  black widow but she has always been a supporting character who shines best when working with other characters. It's not just because ""lol womyn"" there are others I feel are the same way, better off in an ensemble, than a stand alone.   The olive branch, I'd love a good wonder woman movie (I know, dc not marvel) and I could see a good movie coming out of them doing a women centric movie about the Hellfire Club, rotating Emma frost, jean grey, and storm, as the white and black queens, respectively. I was disappointed in the way Emma character was done, in first class, and the abomination that was wolverine origins."

TumblrInAction,3e27a9,badpuppeh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:50 2015 UTC,"I think that would work though.  Captain America 1, while having supernatural elements, was pretty much a regular war movie with laser guns.  Winter soldier was a very textbook spy movie, Cap displays his superhuman power what, twice (the boat and the elevator)?  I think Widow would make a solid movie as a darker reflection of Caps: it's obvious she's been ""tweaked"" as well, make her the russian response to him."
TumblrInAction,3e27a9,Elcactus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, but everyone is going to want a ""superhero"" movie with her  and while she is a bad ass she isn't really super powered, as an action, spy, war movie it would be entertaining, or you could focus on her assassinations, bring up her origin story then lead it into her defecting, that would be a great movie."

The tears will flow without cease."
TumblrInAction,3e27a9,Elcactus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"As awesome as that would be, I don't think it would work now that she is established in the new continuity, as an origin story maybe, but it would end up being rather slap dash, and would have people that didn't know she was a Russian assassin/spy, up in arms. To me, those people are the killers of projects like that, they only know the characters from the movies, or merchandising, and have no idea of the backstories, then they piss and moan when the studio gives them what they think they want."
TumblrInAction,3e27a9,badpuppeh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:13 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant, it would be her origin story.  But you're right, already being established, a background movie may not be necessary.  Still though, it would be nice.  If for no small part that watching her lose to Hawkeye will create ENDLESS tears from these people."
TumblrInAction,3e27a9,Elcactus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"That's the downside of creating those big ensemble movies, if you haven't really explored those side characters ( and in the marvel movie universe, she is a aide character, for all those who would send me an angry message over that) then you are really just stuck with only being able to elude to their back story or give a flashback and hope the audience comes in already knowing who they are.  I love origin stories, when they are done right, not when they are used as a ret conning tool to appease the whiny masses.  On a side note, I wouldn't have an issue with a miles morales spider man movie, I have an issue with people wanting to race bend an existing character solely for the benefit of race bending, a lot of the bitching I've seen is not that there isn't a miles morales movie, it's that Peter parker is white. I'm still kinda miffed over the fantastic 4 race change, mostly because I don't think it makes sense, if it was done differently or maybe the fact that they were doing that was a bit more transparent..I don't know, anything you say about it, makes you sound like a grand wizard of the kkk.   I'm just a comic fan, since I was a weeun, I like things they way they were written  and hate when shit is changed. Case in point, World War Z, it would have been an entertaining zombie movie by LITERALLY any other title. But I'm a huge fan of the book, almost evangelical in the way that I used to promote it to people, so that when  they started releasing trailers I was very upset over it, all it shared with the boom was the title, and it makes me feel like it was solely a cash grab movie, using the popularity of the boom to drag in the readers, a bait and switch of sorts. I understand I'm pretty adamant about movies being as close as possible to their books, but I do understand some things have to change, but raping a boom to make a movie to cash in on the title, eh I've got issues with that."
TumblrInAction,3e27a9,badpuppeh,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"World War Z was an utter TRAVESTY.  My exceptionally well-worn copy of the book still gets off the shelf sometimes, but I refuse to see the movie out of sheer spite.  I don't advocate them rewriting Widows story to make her more palateable to SJW's, I do think she has a solid enough backstory to warrant showing it.  On the other hand, I think one of the spinoff TV series is already dealing with the program she belonged to, so maybe something will come of it."

TumblrInAction,3e1ilg,GreatBaldung,10,Tue Jul 21 17:15:12 2015 UTC,"No. Programming became ""male dominated"" after personal computers became affordable for the common people and elevated the job from being basic clerical work to a much riskier industry(i.e. less job security) making it less appealing to women workers. Women tend to value job security more than male workers do. If you look at the gender disparity between Comp Sci degrees you see women dropped off right after the video game crash and the dot com crash when it became clear how little job security the industry was offering them."
TumblrInAction,3e1ilg,J2383,8,Tue Jul 21 08:37:04 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, makes sense too. I wonder as well if it has to do with the fact that CS jobs seem very competitive (at least in the popular fields like video games etc). I get the impression you have to bring a lot to the table to stand out, not just knowing programming and all the careers events for the CS side of my course involve massive companies like IBM, Oracle etc.  I find it pretty imposing myself, from everything shown to me it seems that I'll have a much easier time getting a foot in the door pursuing maths rather than CS when I go into a career.

They don't seem to give much of a shit about women taking on stable and actually quite well paid coding roles at small time web dev houses. They only care about getting more women working at ""muh Facebook"", ""muh Twitter"" and ""muh AirBnb"".  One of the reasons this is all they focus on because the largest and higher paid mouthpieces in this movement get paid a lot of tour round conferences that these sort of companies attend and preach to them about how they're not inclusive enough.

I've seen the same figures and analysis you're referring to and although that might be part of the problem, I think most of it goes back to how today's students and workers were raised.  I'm a girl in the industry and my childhood exposure to computers and video games is definitely what got me interested, but I was the only girl that I knew of who was into that kind of stuff.  It made me a weirdo and I always had a difficult time finding common ground with female friends.  Girls just weren't encouraged to explore computers and play games on them in the same way that boys were, and I think that trend really started when PC's were mainstreamed.  I've been in the minority in my interests and hobbies for my entire life and career, and it takes a lot of ""sticktoitiveness"" to stay with something when you always feel like you have to prove that you're not some kind of token.  I think that the ""computers are for boys"" culture has changed a lot now-- as games have gotten more sophisticated they have also gotten less explicitly masculine-- but graduation rates are a latent indicator."
TumblrInAction,3e1ilg,bunnylumps,5,Tue Jul 21 13:18:08 2015 UTC,"In my own experience, the single biggest off-putting factor for women wasn't that there were a majority of boys interested in the field, but rather the kind of boys that were into it.   Most of the lads I knew who were into computers in any way deeper than a Gameboy were ostracised and shat upon by everyone else. For them computing was quite literally a safe space for them to explore. They didn't need to have their hands held, they found computing all by themselves.

In the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created. The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand tuned assembly language programs. It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort and was error-prone. The first programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was PlankalkÃ¼l, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.[2]      One of the most important people in the history of computer science   Eh, not without her merits, but hardly the most important.

Now you need to be a well rounded professional who really understands the requirements and can perform multiple roles when the time comes and regularly interact with business people to get what they dream up to be a reality.  I wouldn't even say just the act of coding was more difficult in the past, just far more cumbersome.

I'm a programmer with a large math background, and for a ton of programming jobs high level math has become less important - but there are other aspects that are much more difficult now.

Basically the opposite of eugenics but still equally as bad."
TumblrInAction,3dydm7,CountBubs,22,Mon Jul 20 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"I'll go ahead and say ""significantly worse,"" since eugenics doesn't necessarily imply cruelty. The Nazis decided to use the ""forced sterilization of people we don't like"" strategy, but I'm pretty sure eugenics in theory applies to saying ""you two are very physically fit. Have you considered procreation?""   Eugenics isn't necessarily evil, the Nazis just ruined it for everyone. Like toothbrush mustaches.  Sincerely, correct me if I'm wrong."
TumblrInAction,3dydm7,cabothief,15,Mon Jul 20 18:25:15 2015 UTC,"Eugenics isn't necessarily evil, but there really isn't a good outcome if you apply it. Even if it were applied in the most charitable and humanitarian mindset it'd still result in society essentially stratifying into castes, as the fit only reproduce with the fit, and the unfit with the unfit."
TumblrInAction,3dydm7,TheMauveHand,10,Mon Jul 20 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"That's fair. I haven't given it a significant amount of thought. I'm not actually ""pro-Eugenics,"" necessarily, although I do think it got a much worse rap than it otherwise would have from being associated with Nazis.   Still, I do think it's fair to say the linked story is ""significantly worse"" than eugenics, right off the bat. There are no good consequences to the concept of ""leveling"" put forth by the story, ever. Eugenics has the potential to go very wrong if carried all the way to its logical conclusion, but so do many ideologies. And there are theoretical universes where that casting--even splitting into different species--might not turn out as bad as it sounds.  I mean, obviously I'm talking out of my ass. I'm not going to start protesting for eugenics tomorrow. I just think this sort of thing is fun to think about.  Edit: I just realized that I like the name so much because my favorite character in fiction is named Eugenides."
TumblrInAction,3dydm7,cabothief,13,Mon Jul 20 23:16:09 2015 UTC,"Another flaw in eugenics is, whose considered fit to procreate? It's an interesting conundrum because you have to think about what traits those in charge deem ""acceptable"". For example, let's say I have great genetic potential in my strength and resilience. I have a super immune system, I can burn fat quickly and easily, I can build muscle fast, however, I'm dumb as a post. I'm very ugly. I have trouble in social situations. I might have a mild brain disorder, or I could carry some genetic disease that didn't manifest in myself. Can I procreate? Or say I'm intelligent. I'm charming. I'm attractive. But I get sick easily. Can I procreate? Say I'm a female. I'm strong, smart, fit, but my pelvis prevents natural birth or my breasts can't feed a child. Am I not allowed to procreate?  You can see the problems manifest in dog breeds. Dalmatians, for example, are extremely prone to genetic disorder. German Shepherds are susceptible to dementia. Bulldogs are at the point where they can barely give birth without C-Sections. Pugs and toy breeds are literally stupid because they don't have the skull capacity.   At the end of the day, genetic variability is the best option, because eugenics would just begin to compound issues as you artificially select for certain traits.   I understand you're not advocating for it, obviously. I just wanted to point some other issues that show that at the end of the day, it's just as crippling as literally crippling people."

TumblrInAction,3e2t2t,dsallen7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:01 2015 UTC,"That's the opposite of an accent joke. ""Hazubando"" is a loanword; Anglicizing it as ""husbando"" is applying an English accent to Japanese, not vice versa."
TumblrInAction,3e2t2t,stillnotking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand: ""husbando"" is not an anglicization of ""hazubando."" ""Husbando"" was a made-up word to complement ""waifu."" ""Hazubando"" is a relatively recent correction by Hideki Kamiya."
TumblrInAction,3e2t2t,King_Gilgamesh,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:06 2015 UTC,"Japanese people were using ""hazubando"" the first time I visited Japan, almost 20 years ago. That was well before ""waifu"" or ""husbando"" were in English use."
TumblrInAction,3e2t2t,stillnotking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"Again, there seems to be a misunderstanding here: ""husbando"" and ""hazubando"" are words of independent origin. The first exists becaus of an Azumanga Daioh meme. The second exists as a kana-nization of an English word. Hideki Kamiya is merely a Japanese man who has helped pushed the word into proper memetic usage."
TumblrInAction,3e2t2t,King_Gilgamesh,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"""husbando"" and ""hazubando"" are words of independent origin   What? ""Hazubando"" is a Japanization of an English word, and ""husbando"" is a re-Anglicization of the same word. Such games of cross-cultural Telephone are extremely common.  ""Hazubando"" is more ""proper"" in the sense that it's the standard romaji rendering, yes, but it's the same freakin' word."

TumblrInAction,3e2t2t,stillnotking,8,Tue Jul 21 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"Let me just say it again, for the record.  ""Husbando"" is a meme word, popular among westerners as an opposite to ""waifu,"" who's memetic status can't be attributed to Azumanga Daioh.  ""Hazubando"" is a loanword that means ""husband"" in English."

If it makes you happy, and isn't hurting anyone else, go ahead and do it. People with extreme fan interests tend to keep to their own circles anyway, so one very into anime, gaming, furry, music, or film, would generally only be seen in locations celebrating those interests. Then again, many keep that level of excitement under control, and only bring it up when they're really pumped about something. Notice that you don't really hear from ""weeaboos"" unless some big anime event is happening. Just like you don't hear much from trekkies until a movie comes out. Or, if they're in private."

They're not dehumanizing anyone, they're just really, REALLY big fans of the culture of Glorious Nippon.   Still, if they ever went to Japan and acted like that, they would get some seriously dirty looks by the people there and they would probably get ""ugh, stupid foreigner..."" comments. Japanese people look down on the self-proclaimed otakus, because they think that they should be doing something better with their time. In reality, Japanese people are just like us: jagoffs who have to go to work to pay bills and shit.   Reminder: it's okay to be a fan of things.

Basically they killed Warhammer Fantasy Battle as it was, and introduced new game called ""Age of Sigmar"". In this new product, there are 4 pages of core rules. I repeat - 4 pages of rules. Gone are reactions to charges, movement rules, psychology, figthing in ranks, etc. Instead of Armybooks, there are warscrolls. They are kinda interesting since they've got a lot of special rules, buuuttt... There are no point values. There are no army composition rules. Lots of weird stuff.  Suffice to say that many people are not amused, since AoS is basically a very simplified kinda- sorta- Warhammer that mainly consists of moving your figurines around and then rolling 4+. And as you may or may not know, many people liked to play Warhammer on tournaments. This is now impossible since AoS is impossible to play competitively. So there's lot of bad blood and, let's say, lots of not very amused people."

From what I've heard from people who've actually played the game and not just read the rules, the ""sudden death"" rules used when one army vastly outnumbers the other actually do a good job of balancing the game and making it possible for the outnumbered player to win. As they release new armies, the old ones will likely be discontinued."

Ladylike, as this was an older woman stating this, implies a center level of class, dignity, and discipline. Woman implies, in one way or another, that you are a member of the female half of our species. Basketball shorts and a t-shirt are fine choices of clothing, but hardly show class or discipline, and slouching in one's seat even to sleep, is not a good show of dignity. But allow me a moment to offer credence to your side, as offering judgement where it is unneeded or unasked for is hardly ladylike (very outdated statement I might add).  What it all boils down to, dear activist, is that she was not insulting your femininity, she was insulting your conduct and attire. So kindly, shut the fuck up.  Is that enough pretense?

I never understood it, because if I type ""f*ck"", I think every child knows what I mean.   I don't get why people are afraid of words in the first place. I know, some words, especially slurs,  have a negative connection (every language has those). But being afraid of words doesn't change anything. Just because it's ""forbidden"" to call a black person Nigger (for a white person), doesn't make racism disappear. Because you can use any word in a degrading way and if enough people do it, it will become a new political incorrect word. So at the end you are just losing words. But this is something I can at least understand. Because every language has some ""forbidden"" words. And not using words that might hurt people with their negative connection is not a bad thing in general. (I still think it's dumb because words are just words, but this is my personal opinion)  But substituting a letter in a word with a little star, how does this fucking help in any way, when EVERYONE knows what letter you are censoring. If you are afraid of a word don't use it at all, but these fucking little stars make NO SENSE to me. why. WHY?"

TumblrInAction,3e1iwc,trabuj,4,Tue Jul 21 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty recent cultural-specific development, and the word 'thug' means a negative to begin with.  Further, the dictionary has not enshrined that meaning.  A closer comparrison would be if the dictionary added 'synonyms: misogynist' the definition of the word 'gamer'.  Gamer, on its own, is an innocuous label that many take pride in.  Changing its definition to include something negative is a slap to all those who appreciate the good parts of the culture."

Regardless of it having a good or positive description the impact of that word has become synonymous with racism. In fact when the Baltimore mayor had to apologize for being racially charged by using the word ""thug"" it changed the context of the word. The NAACP asked for President Obama to apologize for calling the Baltimore rioters ""thugs"".  It's why I said the word fag is based on the person using the word. The point I've repeated over and over is that this tumblrina doesn't understand that words carry multiple meanings. And as a group of people that scream about contextual meaning of words it's hypocritical and cherry picking.   But this is getting retarded."

I'm not saying the word 'gypsy' is offensive: it's the name of an entire cultural group ffs.  But what IS offensive is the government enshrining a negative stereotype by putting that stereotype as a synonym for the group in the dictionary.  It's the action, not the word."
TumblrInAction,3e1iwc,Elcactus,8,Tue Jul 21 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"It is a pretty ubiquitous subset definition of the word. I just looked at the Oxford definition of ""gypsy"" on my phone app and it wasn't verbatim but identical in meaning.

I'm pretty sure the fact that context of the word is more important because that alone gives a clear definition of the word."

It doesn't mean that you retard. There are species that lost their Y chromosome and those species still have males. Also Y chromosome is not disappearing in humans and non-human primates.   Comparative genomic studies in primates provide further empirical evidence against human Y extinction21. Recent genomic data has shown that the rhesus macaque, which split from humans 30 MY ago, has an almost identical Y gene set as humans21. This implies that the gene content of the human Y has been stable in the past 30MY and that the last common ancestor had already reached an equilibrium Y chromosome gene number (Figure 3). A linear rate of decay would have instead predicted that human and rhesus would show little gene overlap on their Yâs since they should have lost genes independently since their split. This empirical data thus refutes the hypothesis of the imminent loss of the human Y.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120474/   That forum has the dubious honor of being identified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (Intelligence Report Spring 2012)   ""I DON'T AGREE WITH THEIR OPINION THEREFORE MUH SOGGY KNEE""  Good source."

Sometimes the things you say, get you punched in the mouth. Right or wrong, there it is. Personally, I own everything I say and do, my actions and words fall on me, no one else. And I apply that to everyone else. I am not responsible for the words and actions of others, my ancestors or people the same color as me, and I do not hold anyone else responsible for the words and actions of whatever group they belong to. Your words and actions are yours alone, being offended is not being right by default."
TumblrInAction,3e2y0y,badpuppeh,6,Tue Jul 21 15:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in my opinion it's going a bit too far to punch someone but still, if you are going to say something, you better be ready to face the consequences. Calling someone a racist is definitely not nice and I kinda get that it might rile up some people a fucking lot.  Besides that, being trans(or any other minority for that matter) doesn't get you a free pass to be an asshole when you please."
TumblrInAction,3e2y0y,badpuppeh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, since it's come up in PM, I'm not defending the guy who did the punching, I was just saying people need to own the things they say, and understand that freedom of speech sometimes gets you punched in the mouth. For example, as a white guy, if I call someone a nigger and he takes a swing at me, it's not his fault he punched me, it's no societies, it's not my grandparents fault, it's my. Those are my words, my actions, and I own them and all that comes with it. To use the phrase ""don't do the crime if you can't do the time"" , if you are unwilling to accept responsibility for your actions and words, whether it's criticism or being rebutted or called out whatever, then you should really think before you speak."
TumblrInAction,3e2y0y,Crazed8s,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:40 2015 UTC,Well I mean it is still his fault he punched you in your example. You just shouldn't get to go crying that black people are thugs if you're the one provoking them.

TumblrInAction,3dyr1h,Daishomaru,60,Mon Jul 20 17:10:53 2015 UTC,I always thought the fire nation was based on imperial Japan.
TumblrInAction,3dyr1h,RETRACTDONG,103,Mon Jul 20 17:23:06 2015 UTC,"That is actually a REALLY giant misconception.  Aside from the Fire Nation Navy, the gender equality (That came from Japan, as women actually fought in armies and were actually NEARLY the same level of respect as men, that is, until the Tokugawas came into power and basically degraded women into trophy wives) and the doctrine (Mix of Nazi Germany with Tojo and Showa influences) being based off Japan, the Fire Nation...  drum roll  Has very little, if anything, to do with Japan at all.  Now I know you are going to be thinking, ""What the fuck Daishomaru?  the Fire Nation has very little to do with Japan?  You got to be pulling my leg here!""  But nope, the Fire Nation has to do a lot more with Tang China than Japan.  Both the Fire Nation and the Tang Dynasty are known for their advancements in the scientific fields (So much so that until the 1700s, China became THE MOST ADVANCED CIVILIZATION during this time (Just to give you how unbelievably advanced China was during this time, they invented Air Conditioning during that time, 1000 years before Europe ever did.  Seriously.)), making significant contributions to steel making, shipbuilding, chemistry (They invented Gunpowder during this time), and were considered China's golden ages in science.  Fire Lord Ozai's rule was also known for massive revolutions in the field of science in his dynasty, which is more of a nod towards Tang China than Japan.  That armor?  That's actually Tang Dynasty Armor.  During this time, the Tang Dynasty maintained a lot of trade, including countries like Korea and Japan.  in fact, many element of Korean and Japanese culture can be traced all the way back to Tang Dynasty China, such as the clothing, architecture, armor, and even several foods, such as ramen, tea, soy sauce, tofu, and the like.  The whole Fire Nation making colonies thing in other countries is also something Tang China did too, as Tang China did successfully conquer all of Vietnam and made colonies there (Then again, Vietnam was actually a part of China for a very long time until Vietnam made a fourth declaration of independence and FINALLY broke free after 1200 years of Chinese rule, only to be conquered again by china briefly during the Ming Dynasty before making a fifth declaration of independence and breaking Ming China's rule)  Still not convinced?  If you stare at the background scenery in Avatar, the lifestyles nowhere resemble Japanese, instead taking a lot more of Chinese, for example, the fact that the fire Nation diet nowhere even remotely resembles the Japanese diet.  Note the Steamers, the plating, and the like, it nowhere resembles a traditional Japanese cuisine plating style.  Another thing is that the Fire Nation doesn't seem to have any hesitation towards eating land animal meat products.  Why is this important, you may ask?  Then let me tell you this: do you know the reason why Japan has a huge fish-based diet? Beef, pork, and other land animals were banned from being eaten in Japan during the Edo period due to the Tokugawa's extremist beliefs on Buddhism, that is why if you were to go to a ""true"" Japanese Traditional Restaurant, they will serve mainly fish but not meat.   The music instruments the fire nation are seen playing with are all Chinese.  Most of the Chinese names are Chinese based names, with only 5 names being Japanese.   The Fire Nation Written Language is NOT Japanese.  I know that a lot of people end up seeing the Fire Nation as Japan, but if you look closely at all the tiny details in the works, then you can clearly see that the Fire Nation has a lot more to do with China, particularly Tang Dynasty China, than it has to do with Japan."

First of all, the fire nation is a quickly industrializing society, similar to how imperial Japan became the first Eastern nation to successfully industrialize. The fire nation's war philosophy is also clearly imperialistic, whereas China wasn't so much into the whole colony thing. Finally, I'm no expert on this, but a lot of the character designs and names seem more Japanese than Chinese."
TumblrInAction,3dyr1h,Nothingiswronghere,25,Mon Jul 20 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"First of all, the fire nation is a quickly industrializing society, similar to how imperial Japan became the first Eastern nation to successfully industrialize.   Okay, I've seen plenty of arguments that say ""Clearly, this shows the Fire Nation is representing Japan and not Tang China.""  But here's the thing.  Imperial Japan was FORCED to industrialize their economy because of a threat.  The Fire Nation... Not so much.  The Fire Nation's jump in technology more goes through a scientific revolution, it's more of Tang Dynasty because the Fire Nation wasn't FORCED to industrialize because of a threat.   The fire nation's war philosophy is also clearly imperialistic, whereas China wasn't so much into the whole colony thing.   Vietnam says hi.  Also, the Fire Nation's reason for colonizing is ""to spread Fire Nation Glory"". The Chinese Heaven's mandate did that too, which states that the dynasty in charge is a representative of heaven and must spread his glory and influence across the entire land.   A lot of the character designs and names seem more Japanese than Chinese.   For names, out of all the names the Fire Nation has, only 5 are Japanese, 21 are Chinese, 1 is both, 14 is questionable, 17 is fantasy, and 7 of the names sound Japanese but are not  As for the clothes and designs, the reason why the clothes and designs LOOK Japanese is because during the Tang Dynasty, the Chinese and Japanese people traded a lot with each other, and Japan took a lot of Tang Clothing and incorporated it into their culture. That's why Tang Dynasty China and Japan tend to get confused a lot.  This link right here shows that the Fire Nation armor is more of a Tang Dynasty design armor than Japanese designed  It is true that in the original Avatar script, which definitely has a more Japanese design, the Fire Nation indeed had more of an emphasis on Japan, but in the end, they changed it to China  Also, check out this awesome tumblr that explains all the real world details, and a devoted section to PROVE that the Fire Nation is NOT Japan"

Like, if there was a Japan and Korea (and Africans and Europeans), each with their own very distinct forms of magic/spirituality stuff, but they were just kinda marginalized in the main story because they're trying to focus on the Chinese groups. Like a Marco Polo sort of character or something.  It'd be completely unimportant to anything in the main story, I know. Just tickles my funny bone to imagine that they come up on like, an island of Hawaiians that specialized in like, Lava Bending, or like Black people that learned how to bend power through Swords and armor and stuff. Like, Korra is the New line of Avatars, and then finds out how much wider the world actually is.

And yeah, Pre-Tokugawa Japan was pretty awesome for women back then.  It was MANDATORY EDUCATION for ALL women to learn how to use a bow and spear/polearm and how to practice martial arts (Women weren't usually trained to swordfight with Katanas because a: contrary to popular belief, the katana isn't really used in battles, usually only as a last resort sidearm or a dueling weapon, it wasn't until the Bakamatsu and the Showa era when Katanas became hyped like the weapon believed it was, B; the women's smaller stature would have made using a katana a massive disadvantage, and c: the spear/polearm would have been a lot better for a women's smaller stature), and women had to serve in the army (Basically, EVERYONE, regardless of status, gender, or sexuality, if you can wield a spear, you get drafted) when the time called alongside men.  Women served quite a bit in advising commanders, and they even charged out to battle with men.  Women were also the ones who lead the defense of villages in towns if the males were going on long offensive campaigns, and if necessary, led reinforcements into battle.  The women even had special rituals only they can perform.  Granted, Japan was still male-oriented, because women's children took the surname of the father, and male children were much more preferred over females, but overall, before the Tokugawa era, women actually had it pretty well in Japan.    Actually though, in general, Ancient Japanese samurai was one of the most open societies ever.  It was practically almost an SJW paradise in a nutshell. Race (there have been several European Samurai in history and even an African Samurai named Yasuke, famous for serving under Oda Nobunaga) , gender, and even sexuality were of no concern (The Samurai managed to out-gay the SPARTANS, as quite a few were openly bisexual, including famous warlord Oda Nobunaga).  All you had to do was change your name to a Japanese, say you will follow the Bushido code, and openly serve under a lord, and then you are all set."

Also the attack was Japanese imperialism, with the water intervening essentially acting as the allies of europe being against japan.

Deadliest wars in human history:  WWII - The two theaters were white people vs. white people and Asians vs. Asians (with white people only getting involved after being attacked)  Mongol conquests - Started by Asians, mostly Asians being killed.  Lots of white victims.  Three Kingdoms - Chinese civil war.  Zero white people involved.  Qing Dynasty conquest of Ming - Chinese civil war.  Few, if any white people involved.  Taiping Rebellion - Chinese civil war.  A few Europeans and an American mercenary sided with the Qing Dynasty.  Some foreigners were initially sympathetic to the Taiping rebels due to them claiming to be Christians, but that quickly stopped when the mass killings started.  Second Sino-Japanese War - Part of WWII.  The only white people involved were the Brits living in China who sided against the aggressors.  WWI - The only non-white power to get involved was the Ottoman Empire, a slave holding state which joined on the side of the Austrians when the Russians moved in to stop them from oppressing the Slavs.  An Lushan Rebellion - Chinese civil war.  No white people involved.  Chinese Civil War (1927-1949) - Few white people involved.  Conquests of Tamerlane - Turk/Mongol Timur the Lame, who conquered central Asia met his first white person in the Holy Land on the side of the defenders.  Well, that's the top 10.  The conquests of Shaka Zulu are as close as it gets, all the way down at number 18, and the reason Shaka was so influential is for getting the Sub-Saharan tribes to stop fighting each other, so it could more accurately be stated that they lived in a constant state of infighting until white people attacked.  Well, maybe they meant genocides.  Well, no, none of the genocides of indigenous people by whites even crack the top 20 (in fact, numbers on those are hard to get given the proportion of the populations killed by diseases not native to the area).  In fact, after the Holocaust, the top three were committed by the Ottoman Empire, and that's only if you count the starvation during the Great Leap Forward as a famine instead of a genocide.

TumblrInAction,3dyr1h,tradingsexformemes,2,Tue Jul 21 04:38:29 2015 UTC,"What the four nations in Avatar: The Last Airbender actually represent:  The Water Nation: Most notably similar to Inuit culture and society, due to their polar environment, however, the use of boomerangs is similar to that of the aboriginal, and their ships most closely resemble those of Polynesian societies. However, the northern Water  Kingdom also takes some influences from Venice, with its water-based infrastructure and gondolas. However, their architecture most closely resembles that of the Aztecs.  The Earth Kingdom - Most closely resembling China and Korea, including their love for tea (Uncle Iroh being the one exception, who despite being from the Fire Nation, gets a big ol' boner at the sight of tea), their architecture resembles Chinese pagodas, and their capital city, Ba Sing Se, has a ridiculously massive wall around it. Sound familiar?  The Air Nomads: The air nomads most closely resemble the Tibetans, with their emphasis on monk society, pacifism, and meditation. It's also no coincidence that the show decided to go with an Airbender for the Avatar, being a peace loving reincarnated almost god-figure. Sound like the Dalai Lama? Sure fucking does. It's also no coincidence that that like Tibet, the air nomads live high up in the mountains.  The Fire Nation: The Fire Nation is most notably similar to Imperial Japan (despite the Avatar world being several centuries behind in technology, the similarities are quite apparent). Like Imperial Japan, they have an emphasis on honor, a powerful royal family, a highly industrialized army and navy, and, if you watch the episode where Zuko and Iroh officially become refugees, they remove their pony tails, a symbolic gesture similar to that of renouncing your role as a samurai and renouncing your honor. Furthermore, their tactics are quite similar, including notably the reason why Zuko was banished in the first place. He spoke out against a battle strategy where a group of troops would be sent to die as bait, quite similar to the brutal tactics of Imperial Japan.  Finally, the very concept of the show most notably resembles invasions by imperial Japan, with their brutal scorched earth tactics, highly industrialized military, small island homeland, and abuse of the conquered people."

It's more sci-fi, but I personally really enjoyed Yasutaka Tsutsui's Paprika, but American people seem to be super offended by it online (OMG, this novel is not FEMINISTTTTTTTT, I don't like this or that representation, let me clutch my pearls)."

I'll check them out, I've really been getting into a lot of the new young adult books, because they are so well written, not like young adult was written when I was a kid. Urban fantasy can be pretty good, The Iron Druid series is excellent. And there is a dystopian-ish series called the Unwind Dystology that is just excellent, I'll go through my collection and pick out some that I'd recommend, though fair warning, I am a fan of fantasy/high fantasy, but I tend to gravitate towards hard Sci fi and dystopian, though I do have a love of the old stuff, Pratchett, and Jordan among others."

They turned out to be very good and very engaging, and a nice change of pace from traditional fantasy, in that the setting is modern day, and not some fantastical mideviel castle world (not that there is anything wrong with that) and if you are a fan of mythology, it's got a lot going on in there for ya, several different pantheons make appearances.

The way I'd classify a casual gamer is one who only occasionally plays games, and those games have little depth, e.g. most mobile games. The other side is those who play games often and play longer, more detailed games, those which you have to be invested in and which have a proper storyline.   It's nothing to do with gender."

Mobile games are casual because there is very little challenge and they're designed to be played on and off. The Sims is casual because there isn't a learning curve of any kind, despite soaking up a lot of time.  Games like MOBAs and FPS require a lot of time and effort to properly master. There's a reason Sims tournaments don't exist.  Casual games are fine, and I only use the term casual as an insult ironically, but it isn't a boys vs girls thing. Its someone who is legitimately passionate about games vs someone who simply enjoys them... casually. Is anyone passionate about Candy Crush?"

When readers asked for some way to tell the difference, Wong told them to fuck off and banned them.

OK. This is apparently ableist.    Compared autistic people to Frankensteinâs Monster while talking about his part as the Creature in a production of Frankenstein: âItâs basically being a man child, itâs being a man infant. And then, psychologically, Danny and Nick Dear, whoâs adapted the Mary Shelley novel, into a brilliant 2 Â½ hour play version of it, he, they both have autistic sons. So we went to two extraordinary schools and met some high spectrum autistic kids. And it was very, very humbling and amazing and very upsetting, but very, very extraordinary as well, and inspiring. And especially the people looking after them, and these amazing life forces, but just formed withâ¦sigh um, socially just things that are outside of everyday.  You know, there are certain barriers that arenât there because of the arrested development thatâ¦ there was a 17 year old that had the mental age of, I think, an 18 month old. I mean, it wasâ¦ Itâsâ¦itâsâ¦itâs really really extraordinary and very upsetting. And uh, it was important for them to realize that the Creature in their story was not theirâ¦ the monster of oldâ¦ the monster of the gothic horror stories.  Heâs very much an innocent.  Heâs very much someone who is carried through life, as someone who is so different, not only because of his appearance, but because of these behaviorial tics, which are very autistic, um, both in his understanding of the world, psychologically and emotionally, but also physically as well, how that manifests later in his body. And so that was the major part of the preparation.â    ARE YOU KIDDING ME. THAT IS THE MOST SENSITIVE, RESEARCHED STATEMENT I'VE EVER. THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.   Anyone who cared at ALL about actual autistic people would love him even more for that quote. Or if you've ever read/watched/studied Frankenstein, you'd see he's not calling autistic people evil or something. He was trying to get into the mind of a chracter known as ""Frankenstein's monster,"" who is actually just a misunderstood creature trying to make sense of the world, horribly mistreated who ends up lashing out.   I've never been to YFIP before, but that was worse than I expected.  Edit: OK, all of these quotes are him being objectively an amazing person.

TumblrInAction,3dxt57,_Lady_Deadpool_,4,Mon Jul 20 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"This also brings up some rather terrifying implications in the Star Trek universe.  For some reason there are remarkably few people of Asian descent serving in Starfleet in the 23rd and 24th centuries. There are some, yes, but roughly a third of humanity should be of Asian descent. This means that roughly one third of the crew of a Federation starship should be of Asian ancestry.  However, Federstation starships with human crews are overwhelmingly white.  Khan Noonien Singh's power base was somewhere in Asia, likely SE Asia and he was involved in the Eugenics Wars. Things started with the Eugenics Wars but this was a low level conflict that simmered for a long time, eventually culminating in WWIII.  WWIII/Eugenics Wars could very well explain why so few human Federation crew are of Asian ancestry: WWIII was fought primarily in Asia. China and India were likely mostly wiped out, along with multiple other countries in the region. Most of the hundreds of millions of deaths were in that part of the world.  In other words, the reason why there are so few humans of Asian descent in the 23rd and 24th century is because WWIII killed a large percentage of them. Asia was ravaged by nuclear war. And its all Khan's fault for starting the Eugenics Wars that led directly to WWIII and the near extermination of people of Asian descent.  (Real world explanation: Star Trek is/was produced in the US and reflects demographics of the US where it was produced.)"

They were the most fantastic warriors.    First, this is obviously an informal assumption. Secondly, it's quite likely in reference to Kahn's clothing, which takes (loose) inspiration from Indian design (the differences, of course, because 1996 was still in their future, and this is the year Khan hails from)."

When he was first introduced in Strange Tales #110 he had a more asian look but just 5 issues later in Strange Tales #115 his look had changed and you can see, especially in the last two panels, that he looks a lot like Vincent Price. This look is the one that stuck, as you can see in Strange Tales #146 which is the end of the original Ditko run.

Even though it distanced itself from Black women not only enjoying the comfort of having slaves but not wanting to help them in case it weaken their position (such altruism, such pure morals this movement was founded on) Even though it attacked gay men repeatedly standing in the way of any act that would help us because where men (Only down the line pretending to be there for us so they can exploit us and try make themselves seem more reasonable and decent, still all the while attacking us, enforcing stereotypes and basically treating us not as humans but accessories) Even though it was transphobic, calling trans people infiltrators and traitors (and trust me if you bothered to look at their history it wasn't just ""radicals"", even though that term is utterly pointless and just a cowards way to ignore a toxic history)  Even though to this day it labels all problems as gender ones even when anyone is capable of going though them, they hate anyone who has suffered and refuses to be their tool for their own selfish power and 99% of these issues are born of class, not gender, it's class warfare and so often you will see these ""feminists"" (black or white) are middle class people trying to impose laws and gain power over lower classes, which is why they love to ignore class.   Frankly I pity any minority or vulnerable person who supports feminism, they only do so out of Stockholm syndrome of a society that shoves the false narrative and selective history of feminists down their throats 24/7 (in spite of having no power yet seemingly controlling media and affecting change in policies and laws).

What do you mean I'm seen as less then human for my religious beliefs or lack there of? You're silly, I'm white so none of these things apply to me.   83:34 On that day the faithful will mock the kafirs, while they sit on bridal couches and watch them. Should not the kafirs be paid back for what they did?  8:12 Then your Lord spoke to His angels and said, âI will be with you. Give strength to the believers. I will send terror into the kafirsâ hearts, cut off their heads and even the tips of their fingers!â  6:45 So the kafirs were annihilated. All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.  4:91 If they do not keep away from you or offer you peace or withdraw their hostilities, then seize them and kill them wherever they are. We give you complete authority over them.  5:33 The only reward for those who war against Allah and His messengers and strive to commit mischief on the earth is that they will be slain or crucified, have their alternate hands and feet cut off, or be banished from the land. This will be their disgrace in this world, and a great torment shall be theirs in the next except those who repent before you overpower them. Know that Allah is forgiving and merciful.  9:29 Make war on those who have received the Scriptures [Jews and Christians] but do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day. They do not forbid what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden. The Christians and Jews do not follow the religion of truth until they submit and pay the poll tax [jizya], and they are humiliated.  3:28 Believers should not take kafirs as friends in preference to other believers. Those who do this will have none of Allahâs protection and will only have themselves as guards. Allah warns you to fear Him for all will return to Him.  33:60 They [kafirs] will be cursed, and wherever they are found, they will be seized and murdered. It was Allahâs same practice with those who came before them, and you will find no change in Allahâs ways.  A kafir is not merely someone who does not agree with Islam, but a kafir is evil, disgusting, the lowest form of life. Kafirs can be tortured, killed, lied to and cheated. So the usual word âunbelieverâ does not reflect the political reality of Islam.   ISLAM IS RELIGION OF PEACE AND LOVEEEEEEEEEE."

A black south african woman is more likely to be raped than to learn how to speak english, the education system is worse (for blacks and whites who don't have access to private schooling). The affirmative action (without improvements in schooling) and black employment quotas have borderline ruined the economy. The levels of corruption are staggering, the HIV/Aids crisis is out of control. If you're going to cite apartheid, at least try to improve on it.  Apartheid was heinously evil, there can be no denial of that. But the ANC has turned ""racist"" (prejudice+power...) and it's failing the country. What's worse is that this was never what Mandela intended. He wanted to move to a post-racial ""rainbow nation"" and become a global leader in peace-building and development.

There is one confederate flag in my neighborhood, and it's this tiny little coaster sized thing next to someone's door.  There are no white pride rallies, no white pride shirts and no confederate flag tattoos, that I have seen. But I can point out several other pieces of ""our ethnicity is the best"" paraphernalia.  One thing I will say about where I live, is that the police are not particularly interested in your race, I've had them stop and question me because I was standing out near the parking lot at midnight waiting for my dad to get home because we had some hilarity ensure in the parking lot around that time and I wanted to walk him to the door, because he is 65 and looks like an easy target to would be thugs. I can only speak from my experience but I've never seem them treat anyone differently because of the color of their skin. Race baiting like this does nothing to help the problem, it only makes it worse, creating artificial fear, is there a problem with some police sure I'm not denying that, is it at time disproportionate, again sure, but, is it sometimes the attitude of the person that causes the issues, absolutely.

I know I was raised to be the opposite, if anything.   feminism also supports men in freeing themselves from the limits of traditional male roles   Provided we don't mind never getting laid again. I don't see a lot of feminists dating short, fat, unemployed, timid dudes. ""Traditional male roles"" exist primarily as a means of making ourselves attractive to women; why this extremely obvious fact continues to be missed by feminists (or their conscious minds, at least -- see above) mystifies me.   feminism is actually for everyone   Only if being ""for everyone"" means telling men why we're wrong, even when we obviously aren't -- again, see above re: dating preferences.   we all know women and girls who have suffered from sexual harassment, street harassment, and domestic violence   And yet none of us knows anyone who thinks those things are perfectly fine, meaning the problem is not cultural sexism, it's a minority of men who don't care if they're sexist. Why are you yelling at the rest of us about it? Do you blame ""robbery culture"" every time some asshole holds up a liquor store?   97% of rapists don't spend a single day in jail   Ciation n... Uh, never mind, a citation for this statistic is literally impossible unless you have a crystal ball. All it says is ""I am not serious about this problem. I only want to use it as a political cudgel.""   why do you care [if a woman shaves her armpits or legs]   Why shouldn't I care? Do you not have any preferences at all when it comes to male bodies?

I'd always have something interesting to play and tinker with.   I wouldn't torrent anything either, except in such a case when the game isn't available for sale anymore.

They didn't care about the club at all.""   I dunno. I'm gay. I have no problem with straight people or anyone else. I just like to keep to myself and hopefully find someone who will love me and let me love them. I just think it will be with a cis gay guy. I don't begrudge anyone for having preferences. I have plenty myself - some of them picky, some not.   I personally like having allies who are straight and accept us. And I think gay and trans victories belong to them as well. When you win a battle, it's a victory for all who participated.   I also support gender equality. I don't want women to feel threatened, I've been there. I've had a few times where I didn't feel comfortable with what some of the straight guys were saying about gay people, but I didn't blog about how all straight people need to be castrated because of my fee-fees. I just left quietly and didn't go back. But to constantly claim victim status just does more harm than good because you only attract the crazies and moderate, rational people get turned off by the insanity and then are labeled cishet shitlords because they don't think a man is a rapist by virtue of waking up in the morning...

And calls out the BS that if the roles were reversed that the guy would be considered lucky.  She's not advocating for fifteen year olds to sleep with thirty year olds or anything, but that a four year age difference isn't that big of a deal.

I mean, I didn't discover anything new so much as connect previous observations.  1) activists of this stripe seem incapable of seeing their detractors as individuals. This is because ""the personal is political""  2) by the same token, they cannot acknowledge their own individuality without couching it in shame. ""Yes, I include myself, for I have sinned myself in just the manner I describe here"".   The thing is, in every conversation I've had with a feminist on the topic of feminism, I've brought up my concern about the pop-psychology of it all. I mean, the ludicrousness of wealthy white women demanded to be treated as agents while in the same breathe claiming a huge variety of actions made by strangers they've never interacted with (who have a significant difference of hormone balances) can be reduced to something so simple ""hatred of women, instilled by society while young"".  It just clicked in me that this isn't even tribalism. It's not like they see society as the tribe of man against the tribe of woman. That would require aknowledging the legitimacy of male individuality.  No, this is the entity Man, versus whatever it is convenient to consider woman at that particular time.   This is why #notallmen is a joke and a con to them--because at a fundamental level there is only one man, in whose schizophrenia sometimes pretends to ally with them.  This is why ""trolls"" don't make sense to them--those are not separate entities. They are all Man.  Now feminist treatment of women is itself somewhat varied sometimes variation occurs by feminist, but sometimes by circumstance. When rallying support, woman is a tribe. When criticizing Man, woman is either a tribe a tribe or a single body Woman. And when deflecting certain criticisms, they adopt the GamerGate defense--they're a body of loosely allied individuals acting separately with unique conceptions of feminism.  Man.

Bullies at public schools can't be expelled unless they cause massive physical damage to you.   I was bullied for years, however, I was at a private school, so if I hit my bully I would be expelled. Though he was eventually kicked out, it took many complaints from lots of kids and required 5 years of waiting. Up to that point, I had spent half my life waiting.

TumblrInAction,3dvmow,Grailums,164,Sun Jul 19 23:54:17 2015 UTC,"For men and suicide I think it has more to do with emotional openness. Women on average have a better emotional support network. I have had 2 male friends kill themselves in my life and they were under 30. They were also the last person I would of expected. Both very outgoing, and the life of the party. On the flip side one in 4 girls I would speak to growing up (possibly more) would talk about wanting to commit suicide. They had an outlet for those feelings where as I have never had to talk to a guy about that.

TumblrInAction,3dvmow,Gilth,118,Mon Jul 20 01:41:52 2015 UTC,"The major difference is in the intent of the suicide attempt.  Women attempt suicide so that someone can recognize they are in need of help, hence they use unreliable methods and often do it somewhere where they will be found. Society offers women more support so there is rarely no way out, suicide is a way to convince people they need help they may not have otherwise gotten.  Men attempt suicide because they genuinely want to end their own lives. There's no coming back from a bullet through your head even if you survive. When a man reaches the point of suicidal thoughts it's often because they have no way out.

Is there any actual data to substantiate that? It seems unintuitive, given everything else suicidal people are basically giving up on, that women would fixate on their looks to that extent.

A lot of those questions depend on the exact reason for the suicide and the mental illness behind it, if any. We don't really have much data on motivations for obvious reasons, but that is what I have been told by my professors who actually worked with suicidal people in psych wards for decades and their reports, that girls often report worrying about their appearance and not traumatizing their families after death.  It's not a theory, more a conjecture, but any thoughts on this subject and the gender difference of suicide tend to be conjecture. Either way, it does no one any good to marginalize female suicide because their suicide may be more likely to be ""gestures"" or ""calls for attention"", and it does no good to marginalize male suicide because they attempt it less.   The main takeaway was that your previous statement   Obviously these are overall trends but it's generally it's understood the difference methods each sex uses vary because their true intentions vary.   Is false. We have no idea if their true intentions vary, and it is dishonest to say we know, and unhelpful to say women are just less serious about suicide."

Here's the thing: if men had access to the same support that women did, -surprise- they'd be doing the same thing as women.   Asking for help isn't -just- trying to get attention. It's knowing there's a support structure that will help some real emotional problems.  By refusing to acknowledge this, you're ignoring something that could help men out, namely that they need a support structure like women do."
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,Mork-or-Gork,10,Mon Jul 20 07:29:57 2015 UTC,I've heard sometimes the woman is trying to make it slightly less traumatic on the person who finds their corpse by not leaving behind a lot of visual trauma. That's also supposedly why the bathtub is chosen often by women as the scene of their death (easier cleanup).
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,ptera_tinsel,9,Mon Jul 20 05:16:03 2015 UTC,I always thought it was because cutting your wrists underwater is supposed to sting less.
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,Nylockeee,8,Mon Jul 20 05:30:21 2015 UTC,I've never heard that. But I only volunteered at a suicide hotline for two months before I quit because the regulars were starting to make sense and I don't really discuss suicide methods in my day-to-day life.
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,ptera_tinsel,10,Mon Jul 20 05:41:08 2015 UTC,It's actually because heat is a vasodilator and increases blood flow. Increased blood flow=bleed out faster
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,ThighrannosaurusFlex,7,Mon Jul 20 07:13:44 2015 UTC,Doesn't the blood flow better in a bath?
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,DominoNo-,2,Mon Jul 20 06:04:47 2015 UTC,"Hey-o. When I was feeling like that, that was my exact line of thought. Also the reason why I didn't, because I couldn't bear with the guilt of traumatizing whoever found me/my family/my friends with that, even if it was a ""prettier"" scene than a gunshot or something violent."
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,Laureltess,5,Mon Jul 20 12:07:24 2015 UTC,True but there are other ways of looking at it. Anyone that is having suicidal thoughts believes that there is no way out but death ignoring the reality of the situation.  Having more emotional outlet allows one to stay somewhat grounded. When one bottles it up more they go past depression to psychosis. That is when reality is ignored and the perceived only option is the only option to them.   Less stigma on mental health could make a dent in this. But I am not sure there is any perfect solution to this. I wish there was.
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,Anneal,2,Mon Jul 20 02:38:37 2015 UTC,Exactly. Women attempt suicide as a way of crying out. Men attempt suicide because they want to fucking die.
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,Diarrhea_Van_Frank,9,Mon Jul 20 06:13:21 2015 UTC,Nice inaccurate blanket statement.
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,sunglasses619,7,Mon Jul 20 09:00:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for pointing out the obvious. Let me ask you something: do you really think that I meant that every time a woman attempts suicide it's just a cry for help? Do you really think that I meant to say that every single woman who has ever attempted suicide didn't really mean it? Or do you think it's possible that I may have been generalizing because it's quicker than laying all that out first and because most people aren't complete retards?
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,Diarrhea_Van_Frank,3,Mon Jul 20 13:30:53 2015 UTC,So what you are saying is that men are better at it.  You mysoginist pig

I'm currently heading to work stripping roads and I've considered doing that myself. It could look like an accident (which does happens from time to time).

I don't know you or what your problems are and chances are I'll never speak with you again but your life has value and I really hope that you get yourself out of whatever is troubling you and wish you the best.
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,thekindlyman555,39,Mon Jul 20 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"Yeh, that tends to be the case. Sadly the idea that men shouldn't talk about their feeling is perpetuated by both men and women by and large. There are probably other factors as well, but I'd imagine lack of support can be difficult for those suffering from suicidal thoughts."
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,A_kind_guy,6,Mon Jul 20 01:09:19 2015 UTC,"There are so many other factors involved, I agree. I would like to see more research done in this and wish there was less of a stigma for anyone seeking help from a mental health professional."
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,Anneal,13,Mon Jul 20 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"For men and suicide I think it has more to do with emotional openness. Women on average have a better emotional support network.   You're not wrong about this. This is actually something that has been studied extensively. Sociology major here (wow finally I can put my degree to work for once!), and Emile Durkheim touches upon this.   His studies showed that men commit suicide more than women. Also when you mention that women have a better emotional support network, a lack of an emotional support network can increase the risk of suicide (also known as Egoistic suicide according to Durkheim)."
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,PeachPandaStar,21,Mon Jul 20 06:43:14 2015 UTC,"I've seen that opinion often to explain it and it kind of bothers me. When women have a problem in society, society itself is blamed for it (sexist standards/expectations, laws, etc). When men have a problem in our society, we blame the men themselves (they are not open enough about their emotion, it comes from their own sexist behavior, etc).  It seems like our society has become more feminized in many aspects of it (schooling, workplace, general accepted behavior) and yet male suicides stayed the same/became worst. I have a hard time believing that pushing it further that way will make it better."
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,azertii,3,Mon Jul 20 03:32:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see how thats blaming men. We live in a society where men are told to repress emotions. Girls get princesses and are told to cry, where boys are told to be manly and tough. Thats on society for being fucked up. Blaming women for it doesn't really address the issue...."
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,poondi,3,Mon Jul 20 14:17:45 2015 UTC,"When I say that society is feminized, I'm not blaming women, I'm saying that traits and behavior normally associated with women (learned or programmed, we don't really know) are applied to boys for the last couple of decades.  Emotional openness , zero tolerance to violence, low competitiveness, etc. These have been applied yet we don't see the suicide rate lowering/see it going up."

Women tend to choose less violent ways to kill themselves or others, so they fail more often. Men tend to choose more violent ways to kill them selves or others, so they fail less often (ie, a bottle of aspirin can be puked, a bullet to the head cannot)"

It's easy as a non-scientist to discredit hand-wavy statistics from tumblr and such, but the fact is that transgender teens do in fact have extremely high suicide attempt rates, even by conservative estimates. Here are some relatively trustworthy numbers from Washington State: http://www.yspp.org/about_suicide/statistics.htm  I found this statement particularly surprising: ""More than 50% of Transgender youth will have had at least one suicide attempt by their 20th birthday."""
TumblrInAction,3dvmow,sapientrobot,3,Mon Jul 20 02:06:07 2015 UTC,"yeah another user linked something similar.

Even transgender people at comparatively ""low"" risk were still much more likely to have attempted suicide than the general population, they wrote, with ""lows"" often ranging from 30% to 40%.

TumblrInAction,3dvmow,iamveryoffended,56,Mon Jul 20 01:59:09 2015 UTC,"Well that's the definition of dysphoria.

One of the most common side effects of something like that? Depression, suicidal idealization etc. You toss in the associated mental health diagnoses that can be applied usually to those going through this, and yes, it makes sense there is a high suicide attempt rate/thoughts.   I think that's what bothers me with these studies. Suicidal thoughts/tendencies, depression, they're markers of people with actual body dysphoria. It's part of the diagnosis. It's a high number because it should be affecting them - if it didn't they wouldn't have the diagnosis!"

I went to college with multiple 'Trans' people, and they would say anything for attention. I realize it's entirely anecdotal, but every 'Trans' person is met has been this way. I've put 'Trans' in quotes because there is a high likelihood that these people I've met were just claiming they're Trans for attention to begin with.

TumblrInAction,3dvmow,irbos,7,Mon Jul 20 03:23:26 2015 UTC,"Almost all of what is below is data about suicide it might be best to skip to the TL:DR  Transgender people also have higher rates of depression ~50% where adults in the US have a 6.7% prevalence of depression women are diagnosed 2:1 compared to males. Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the 30,000 reported suicides in the U.S. each year.  For transgendered people suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition. 7% found that this increased during transition.   In the US men account for 78% of all successful suicides, but there are 3 female attempts for each male attempt.  An important thing to look at for that are the methods of suicide that males and females use  Males/Female;   Firearm 56.4/31.2%   Hanging & Suffocation 25.2%/23.5%   Poisoning* 11.1%/36.2%   Those account for over 90% of all suicides  *Of the poisoning Deaths, 81% were ingestion of drugs and 15% were gas inhalation  Each method has its own lethality; Firearm ~95% (depends on where and handgun vs shotgun) Hanging 90% Plastic bag over head 23% Carbon Monoxide 71% Overdose on illegal drugs 49.4% Overdose on prescription drugs 12.3% Overdose on non-prescription drugs 6% Cutting wrists/arm/legs 6%  75% of all suicide attempts are by self-poisoning and that has a lower rate of lethality.   In a study done in Oxford UK, 864 people that attempted suicide (and survived) were asked to rate, on a scale of 1 to 30, how intent they were on killing themselves (where 30 was totally intent, and 1 was hardly at all).   Rating of suicidal intent % of respondents  Low (0-6) 36.9%  Moderate (7-12) 33.9%  High (13-20) 25.0%  Very High (21+) 4.2%  The message here is that two thirds of people that try to kill themselves are not that intent on succeeding.   ^ most of that suicide data is from http://lostallhope.com/ it is a depressingly important website   I couldn't find any data on successful suicides by transgendered people  TL:DR;  There isn't really data on the successfully suicides of transgendered people, just an attempt rate. A high attempt of suicide does not mean that people are intent in actually succeeding. Women have suicide attempt rate 3:1 compared to men, and men successfully complete suicide 4:1.   Edit: I should also clarify that I am not trying to downplay the seriousness of a suicide attempt. They are a cry for help that most definitely needs to be addressed no matter the intent."

Doesn't give info on the age the attempt took place though, since they didn't specify when in life the attempt took place. It's not the best measure for actual suicides, since it's self-reported and covers attempts, but it's the best we've got and the best we can get really, until census data includes trans status."

TumblrInAction,3dvmow,meaderlark,3,Mon Jul 20 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. You would think, if ""acceptance from society"" was really driving these depressingly high statistics (as many on this thread are claiming), transwomen would have the higher rate.  I say this because it's far more acceptable in our society for women to do / dress / act masculine than the reverse. Men/boys are more severely ridiculed for doing anything feminine so I would imagine to become a woman from a man would be less socially acceptable than to become a man from a woman.  Back in college psychology we discussed the theory that the suicide rates among men were significantly higher due to testosterone and being raised that men ""take action."" So women may want to commit suicide but men are far more likely to follow through and actually do it.   I still think that trans-people try to kill themselves because they have extreme mental disorders. The two trans people I know in real life both suffer from crippling bipolar/anxiety on top of dysphoria. I don't attest to know the heart and mind of every transperson but the stats people rattle off paint a VERY bleak picture of mental health for these poor people - no matter what the social currents of ""progressive"" politics say. And it's sad. No one should have to feel this way."

Often found stalking people on facebook and being creepy in bars, the Female Nice Guy, or Nice Girl TM, is a particularly disgusting subset of the Nice People species because most people are unaware (or unwilling to believe) that they exist and worse yet support the way they act by putting it in a sympathetic light, wherein they view her comments about the friendzone as stemming from heartbreak rather than entitlement.   There are 3 main types of Nice Girl: The straight, the lesbian, and the hybrid.   Here we see what may be either the Lesbian Nice Girl or, more likely for the region of the internet on which it was found, the Hybrid Nice Girl.   A hybrid nice girl is what happens when a Straight Nice Girl is rejected by guys and begins instead to prey on girls.   Often a Hybrid Nice Girl will adopt an name containing the word ""misandry"" and take up a twisted version of feminism, but will prey almost exclusively on straight anti-feminist women and lesbians who have no interest in dating girls who are not actually gay. It will refuse others like itself, attempting instead to catch women it cannot hope to get, attempting to bait them by saying such things as ""men will only hurt you"" and ""its your duty to your fellow woman to sleep with them"".

However, lesbian women still seem to have elevated levels over their heterosexual counterpoints in most categories (forcible penetration was an exception, though it seems obvious why that would be).

TumblrInAction,3dx85a,ziekktx,5,Mon Jul 20 17:47:45 2015 UTC,Well with lesbianism I think it's obvious there would be a rise over heterosexual women as they're with a partner who's on the same physical level as they are.  The elevated levels though make it interesting... At the very least I think it shows that men aren't quite as predisposed to violence as is generally pointed out (testosterone and such).

Yearning and loneliness does shitty things to a person. Looking for a romantic connection and never finding it can do a lot of damage. Whether you believe it's ""entitlement"" to want to be loved or not, not getting any affection at all can severely cripple somebody emotionally and mentally.

I don't know how you go about fixing it, but it sucks. I really pity these people their plight."
TumblrInAction,3dx85a,oldirtybaron,11,Mon Jul 20 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree; being emotionally isolated is bad for a person.  However, I think the root problem is a matter of self-esteem, validation, and growth.  It's said that to be loved, you must first love yourself, and there is truth in this.  Many people are constantly questing for romance as a means of filling the void they feel.  They try to reinforce their self-worth or find validation in others finding them valuable, and this makes them fearful in love - and that leads to jealousy, fickleness, dependency, and a constant battle for those in relationships with them.  This is compounded by the social emphasis on being in a relationship that you mention; some folks are taught that their measure is in who they're with, or who they attract (both men and women are subject to this, albeit in different ways).  Yes, humans are social creatures in a broad sense; we crave companionship.  But at the same time every person can be and should be an island; we must be able to exist by and for ourselves.  You should be someone that you like - and failing that, you should make of yourself someone you like.  Loving yourself doesn't mean being perfect, it means recognizing and accepting your flaws and working to correct them.  Solitude leaves you with only yourself for company; it's much less painful if the company is good.  And when you love yourself, it makes it easier for others to love you.  It lets you avoid clinging.  It lets you avoid being a burden, a dependent.  A sound relationship is not a matter of two incomplete people becoming whole, it's two full people (warts and all) being something more together than they are apart.  That's my take on it at least.  So while I agree that it's rough, even piteous to be without love and affection, I think it's more important that people learn to love themselves than that they find romantic fulfillment."

This is no reason to dislike or blame anyone except for those that cause you harm.   Maybe not, but you clearly are.   That's a pretty bad way to start a conversation. Also, it's rather tautological.   When men say this, it has nothing to do with making women feel safer or changing womenâs minds about men.    When women say this, it has nothing to do with making women feel safer or changing menâs minds about women.    It has everything to do with silencing women through insults and fear.   Disagreement is harassment. If I speak after you, I am a monster.   It is an entirely self serving act when a man tells a woman not to fear men.    What else can they say? ""Oh, all men are pigs, you know that. I hate myself more than you hate me."" Or it's assuming it's the man's job to protect women form other men, which is perpetrating stereotypes you'd otherwise be against.   They donât care about womenâs safety or peace; they care how womenâs suspicion going into any interaction with them is affecting a manâs ability to do what he wants with her later.   I assume you mean if a man is conversing with a woman he want to have sex with her? That's assuming quite a lot and a bit projecting.   I have never seen a man say ânot all menâ and come from a place of âI want women to feel safe because I want them to be happyâ.   A person will respond to personal attacks or attacks against their qualities with something actually responding to those attacks.   It always comes from a place of âI want women to feel safe because their fear is inconvenient to me; it prevents them from going on dates with me, it makes them question my intentions when we are alone,   If their fears are unfounded, which they most often are, perpetuating these is a shitty thing to do.    it makes them more apt to notice when they are being treated unfairly, it makes them less likely to leave themselves vulnerable to me emotionally and physically, and it makes me uncomfortable that I may have to tell other men to behave,    It's obviously the man's job to set other men right   so Iâd rather continue to harass the women who are already afraid of me by silencing them.â   Jesus christ."

As someone who is a scientist who studies Asian Giant Hornets, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one says Asian Giant Hornets make nests. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""Asian Giant Hornet"" you're referring to the ground nests, which includes things from holes to snake tunnels to rodent tunnels.  So your reasoning for saying Asian Giant Hornets make nests is because random people ""want to use them as piÃ±atas."" Let's get cicada killers and digger wasps in there, then, too.  Also, calling an Asian Giant Hornet a wasp or a hornet? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. An Asian Giant Hornet is an Asian Giant Hornet and don't build nests. But that's not what you said. You said Asian Giant Hornets have nests, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all underground nests nests, which means you'd call rotted pine roots, snake tunnels, and other underground holes nests, too.

I get really mean and have even gotten violent when I don't have sexual release. Most people would tell you I am the kindest most gentle guy ever, but when I get horny enough I get very irritable and forceful and begin having violent urges. I start fantasizing about rape, FREQUENTLY to the point I sometimes think I might really do it if I went long enough.   I know it's wrong, I know I would regret it, but I don't care, relieving the pressure between my legs becomes all encompassing to the point it would be worth my own life.

Call me a tinfoil hat wearing lizard stomping shill if you want, I'll take my hate mail for this, but there's no factual proof that the NSDAP committed genocide besides the testimony they tortured out of Heinrich Himmler, who was previously stripped of his rank by Hitler for attempting to negotiate with allied forces behind Hitler's back. Knowing this, I find it hard to believe HH's confession. He had no stake left in the organization and would gain absolutely nothing by denying what they wanted to hear, and everything to gain by telling them what they wanted to hear. If 6 million jews did die, it would more the cause of allied bombing and Typhus then the easy bake oven, in which case you can blame the British for starting a war and not accepting requests for peace on multiple occasions.   Antisemitism increasing every year.   Oy vey, I wonder if the increase in antisemitism is directly correlated to the suppression of free speech and opinion regarding WW2. I wonder if after people question the the number of victims or cause of death and are thrown in fucking prison for two years, they come out of prison and blame jewish extremists. Or maybe, people think you're hiding something when you run around silencing anyone's speech who doesn't follow group think to the T.   The media effects our way of thinking.   The irony. The victor writes the history textbooks, his word is taken as law because the mouth's of those who know the truth behind his lies are filled with dirt. The majority of media in the U.S. goes through comcast, newscorp, viacom, time warner, and cbs. All of which are owned by a jew.

TumblrInAction,3dztru,Bothropsatrox,3,Tue Jul 21 01:45:42 2015 UTC,"I can see the pyramids, does that prove aliens built them? I don't know what you mean by ""Go to Auschwitz"". I know it exists. What do you expect me to see when I go to Auschwitz? I think they cleaned the bodies up by now, and being that it's been over half a century they'd have the time to fabricate evidence if they wanted. I accept that it was a camp, and I accept that jews and POWs died. I don't, however, accept without proof that war crimes where committed by Germans. I apologize that I'm not so willing to demonize an entire generation of my people based on evidence that is at the very best circumstantial, and at worse completely falsified.   Fred Leuchter, one of the only men in the world with first hand experience in gas chamber executions, proved through several tests that the ""gas chambers"" used in Auschwitz could not have been used as such and where likely just communal shower rooms used to delouse new arrivals to avoid Typhus. Zyklon B was known to be used as a delousing agent and pesticide, so traces of cyanide aren't proof of anything except for the shocking fact that people had lice during a war. Let's say they did have gas chambers though, or maybe they didn't and used alternate methods of execution, it doesn't matter. It takes roughly an hour to cremate a body, being generous. How many ovens are in the crematorium at Auschwitz? 15, right? Let's say for the sake of math that 1.5 million jews (The high end of the accepted conservative estimate) where Shoah'd at Auschwitz. Based on that math, running ovens around the clock, you'd need 4166 days or 11 years to Shoah that many of god's chosen people. Even if we're generous and double up on each oven, that's 5 and a half years, and it's commonly claimed that 1941 is when the Holocaust really kicked into gear. Math doesn't check out. If they didn't have enough time to cremate them, how did they herd them into chambers (An hour per batch of jews, 50-100 per batch) Kill them, which we won't even take into consideration as a time frame, then drag their dead weight to the crematorium which takes considerable effort, and burn them.   What about the lampshade and the shrunken heads that where ""proof"" and later turned out to be allied propaganda? Once they've proven to be willing to go to such lengths, should everything not be taken with a grain of salt?  Once again, I don't know what you mean by block reality. That doesn't really make any sense whatsoever, because as I stated I believe in the 6 billion for the most part. It might be a little overzealous but I mean it's an estimate, what can you do.  I just don't believe that the Germans had the manpower to run multiple death camps every minute of every day sustainably for years while fighting and then losing a war against the British, French, Soviets, and Americans. I simply believe that typhus starvation and indiscriminate civilian bombing by the British did most of the work for them."
TumblrInAction,3dztru,ScalierLemon1,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:57:11 2015 UTC,"We have Allied soldiers who confirmed that the Holocaust happened. We have pictures.

The more people required for a conspiracy, the less likely it is to be true. Also, if Nazi Germany didn't actually commit these crimes, why has modern Germany tried to get so far away? Is the entire American and German government in on this? The Russians? British? French? Who's in on this conspiracy?"

TumblrInAction,3dztru,Bothropsatrox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:15:43 2015 UTC,"Whoops. My bad.   That's sort of a loaded question. I'm not a part of it nor am I a part of an organization investigating it. It's also less of a conspiracy in my opinion and more of a mutually beneficial lie or coverup. Churchill may have conspired but I don't think the Americans or even the Soviets had any real foreknowledge. The British, Americans, and Soviets all committed war crimes ranging from the British and Americans indiscriminately bombing civilians, freezing German assets which is a violation of international law, all the way to the Soviet's mass execution of POW's and things like the Dresden bombings in 1945 that killed over 100,000 children and 400,000 other civilians as reported by a German newspaper with unbiased estimations ranging anywhere from 250 to 500 thousand dead over a two day span, when the war was essentially already won. In Dresden, military targets in the north of the city where left completely untouched and are still standing to this day. There's also the occupation of Germany as a sovereign nation which arguably hasn't ended or recently ended. Churchill even plotted the war years in advance, hinting at an American Soviet British alliance years before the war even started. That's essentially what I think it's about. Covering up war crimes or I suppose you could argue that some aren't war crimes and are simply immoral acts, is what it's about in my opinion. By exaggerating the crimes or brutality of the enemy, they created a monster that drew focus away from things they did that could potentially destroy their credibility or swing the opinions of the masses away from supporting them. Where it went after western media got a hold on the angle is a different beast all together."
TumblrInAction,3dztru,ScalierLemon1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:17:18 2015 UTC,"I never said they didn't commit crimes. But what did the countries have to gain from covering up this? After WW2, Germany became our ally. Why would the Americans still cover that up? And again, if the Russians knew we covered it up (seeing as they were the ones to liberate Auschwitz, among others), why didn't they reveal that to the world to try and discredit the US? Unless you're saying that the USSR and the US didn't agree on anything, except that nuclear annihilation is bad and they should cover up what really happened during the Holocaust?"
TumblrInAction,3dztru,Mackilroy,4,Tue Jul 21 09:54:16 2015 UTC,"False equivalence. We have Germany's own records that they built the camp system, what they did there, and how they did it.  What I mean is this: go see the mass graves, the gas chambers, the barracks where inmates lived, and write with a straight face that those camps weren't places where tens of thousands (and more) of people were slaughtered for no more reason than the Nazi government didn't like them.  Ah, so what you're concerned about isn't history, but making sure 'your people' don't look bad. You're an American, by your own words--the Germans are not 'your people' any more than they are mine, and I'm also an American of German ancestry.  Looking through your post history it's evident you're already biased against Jewish people, that you consider German sources somehow unbiased compared to American, Soviet, French, and English sources (I'm not saying that either side is unbiased here, note--both the Allies and the Axis were biased in different ways), that you consider the fraud Fred Leuchter (who had neither qualifications nor experience and ignored things that didn't fit what he wanted to portray in his report) a valid source--it's pretty evident that you made up your mind a long time ago.  As you seem to focus solely on the crematoriums as a method of disposing of evidence, let's look at the other ways the Nazis exterminated so-called untermensch: mass executions; starvation; simply working them to death, and then throwing those bodies into mass graves. All of which started before either gas chambers or crematoria and kept going even as the other methods were brought online. Also, the sources I've seen say twenty minutes to die in a gas chamber, not an hour.  Never heard of the lampshade or any shrunken heads, outside of some tribes in South America.  Why do you keep typing six billion? Is it a typo on your part or just an effort to make the Holocaust seem ridiculous?  As far as German manpower goes, it really doesn't matter what you believe. There were roughly 55,000 personnel working in the camp system. Let's compare that to the size of an average infantry division in 1941: roughly 17,000 men. That's three infantry divisions plus a little extra, which is small change when you're dealing with millions of soldiers. For comparison, the Wehrmacht deployed 154 divisions during the invasion into Russia. Not to mention that the camps used prisoners to do much of the work, as well as women (admittedly only a few women, but thousands of them nonetheless) and non-German staff.  If you're near Washington, D.C., you might be interested in going to the National Archives and reading the surveillance protocols of captured German personnel. They knew the Holocaust was going on at the time, that Germany was committing war crimes both at home and especially on the Eastern Front (you've heard of the Commissar Order, yes?), and that Germany is not this innocent, pure warmaker you seem to want to believe it is. If you don't want to go in person, you can even go online."

As for the Norse, I can already hear them screaming rape and colonisation xD"
TumblrInAction,3e00ly,Shutup_Violaine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:04:43 2015 UTC,"However, acknowledging either would show that white people have culture and acknowledging both would show that not all white people have the same culture.  Checkmate either way to what the tumblr poster is saying.   Also, while I can't really think of anything for Arthur (apart from maybe white knights), but for Norse mythology/culture there is something to confuse the SJWs, or at least the feminist part of them:   To quote Snorri Sturluson (a 13th century poet/writer):   The divine gods are twelve in number... The goddesses [who number thirteen] are no less sacred and no less powerful.    So not only is there an equal representation in Norse mythology, but equal power as well. As such, it suggests that equality in some sense was part of Norse culture.  Then again, colonisation, rape and slavery were also things. They just can't really talk about the patriarchy being a thing. Along with the slaves also being white, meaning whites oppressing whites.  Rape? Well, you can't really defend that point, but I'm not sure that they think you can colonise Europe, though Vinland probably counts, I can't remember if there was any 'oppression' in the small amount I know about it. The Vikings weren't all horrid invaders that killed, looted and feasted after all (They're just the ones that went to Valhalla.(SJWs probably have something for that)) but I can't back Vinland up, I still haven't gotten round to read anything about the Vinland Saga and Vikings on the North American continent, although I keep planning to. Then again, I think the people making the claims probably haven't either and even more probably wouldn't even know about the Vikings being the first Europeans to discover America.   All in all, I think SJWs (particularly this person) would probably have to significantly change their strategy, because as it turns out, their 'white culture' was different than US 'white culture' and to this day, Scandinavian, and also national and state culture, is different everywhere.  What they, and in particular this tumblr user, don't seem to understand is that everywhere has different history and as such different culture and that skin colour has very little do with culture."
TumblrInAction,3e00ly,Pancoleon,2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree to all of the above! About Vikings and America + colonization : I remember reading a book that got borrowed and I never got back that explained why South Americans indigenous were supposedly ecstatic at the arrival of European colons. Apparently,  again according to this book, the Vikings had set foot in South America waaay before, and among other traits, the tribes had remembered their horses and the cross on their apparatus, neither of which were known or a common view in SA. So when the Christian colons arrived with horses and crosses left and right... They took it as the long lost Vikings coming back with familiar symbols."

TumblrInAction,3dzysg,drunkjake,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:54 2015 UTC,"I recall one study done in the midwest (albeit in the 80's I think) that took over 9 years of rape claims in one town and out of 110, I believe, 50 of them were found to be outright false and fabricated. Not unfounded, straight up falsified."
TumblrInAction,3dzysg,Grailums,3,Tue Jul 21 05:22:50 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the studies. I prefer the 20% proven by DNA exclusively because it's decently hard science.   But, that means at LEAST 20% of rape claims are false, proven by dna evidence. IE, the DNA found is not the accussed's. Non found dna = inconclusive statistic, which is another 20 odd percent"
TumblrInAction,3dzysg,drunkjake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:31:07 2015 UTC,What I love is when they try to defend the false accusation of a man who was in another country at the time of the rape.

People allow things to be done to them that they really don't want because they think the person will love them, or approve of them, or because they don't feel like they have a choice.  I have been in that situation,  and it fucks you up on a deep level. But regardless of your emotional response, it's still not rape. You can regret consensual sex, and though it is a legitimate problem,  it's something that had to be dealt with at an emotional level, not a legal one"
TumblrInAction,3dzysg,ETERNAL-DAMNATION,9,Tue Jul 21 02:46:01 2015 UTC,"""Unwillingly consented"" is an oxymoron.   I feel bad for people who said yes even though they didn't really want to, but it's untrue to say someone raped them."
TumblrInAction,3dzysg,Eunoic,7,Mon Jul 20 22:50:42 2015 UTC,"As someone else mentioned there are age restrictions on who can actually give consent, and there is also a grey-area involving coercion.  If your husband says something like ""have sex with me or I'll take all your money"" (extreme example) that's coercion. If you consent to sex under these terms, that's probably something that can be defined as ""Unwilling consent"".  Now, if you are just too uncomfortable to say no because you don't as some would say ""have the balls"" to say no, that's different."
TumblrInAction,3dzysg,herp_der_derp,11,Tue Jul 21 04:16:58 2015 UTC,"Sort of. As a kid, I was molested. I agreed to it every time, because I didn't know what this person was doing was wrong. As I got older and realized it was wrong, I also realized I had been compliant, which gave me a ton of guilt. When it comes down to it though, I was raped. It was through coercion and they took advantage of my ignorance, but that doesn't negate the fact it was rape.   I agree the term ""unwillingly consented"" is an oxymoron though."

I never leave my drink unattended or pretty much out of my hands, and these two guys were awfully chummy with me and the bartender, so if I had to guess the bartender was involved somehow, but I could never prove it and I never saw them again.  I do not eat food at someone's house that I don't know well nor have drinks that are opened when I get them, and more often than not I always bring my own. I don't drink alcohol so that's a nonissue.

It's not hugely popular but it was immensely intellectually influential. Leo Tolstoy, a man who is often considered the greatest novelist of all time (Wrote War and Peace), became very religious later in life and wrote several tracts, most especially ""The Kingdom of God is Within You"" espousing Christian Anarchism, directly corresponded with Mahatma Ghandi about it, and was, some have argued, the main reason Ghandi adopted his nonviolence philosophy. Was influential to MLK as well.  Marx was just another academic playing with utopias that became popular because he was in the right place and time. Tolstoy touched people's hearts with his writings because he really fucking understood human nature."

It matters when you watch someone LITERALLY VOMIT UP THEIR OWN SHIT... and scream for hours because they are in so much pain- as much from the withdraws as from the cancer... and you are standing there, crying, unable to help, just wishing she would die already so she wouldn't be in so much pain."

I am FAR from the only kid to be taken from a parent who lost their mind to meth. As for it not affecting you... are you a sociopath? I'm sorry for being mean but goddamn, that's cold.    ou need to understand that they are not your mother,    No, pretty sure I popped out of my mom's vayjayjay. Pretty sure it was her responsibility to raise me. Pretty sure that as humans we all have responsibilities- to ourselves and others.   because you can just walk away from them.   Being taken away is not walking away. And I most definitely did not ""just"" do anything. The panic attacks I have... my agoraphobia, anxiety disorder/panic disorder, and depression?

TumblrInAction,3dxveh,Cuntasaurus--Rex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:11 2015 UTC,"It's true that in the situation where the father doesn't want the kid but the mother does that the child being born plays a part of it.   From a fairness standpoint, however, even if I personally never do it I think other men should have the choice. As it stands now the man can be screwed (no pun intended) in both situations.   If he wants the baby and she doesn't, she can get it aborted. He loses a potential son/daughter. If he doesn't want the baby and she does, she can make him pay child support. He's stuck paying for a child he may never even see or want. Either way the man loses, and it's not fair. Why should men be forced to own up to responsibility when women can make a trip to clinic and sever her responsibility in a few minutes?   I think there should be an option for a man to legally sign away his status and responsibility as father. In addition to not paying support, he would give up his status as father and not be allowed to request time or custody of the child. There may be a few exceptions to this, but basically his status would be like that of a stranger. I also think that taking this option would only be viable during the same time a woman can get an abortion and only if the mother is left in acceptable conditions. So a man can't be a dad for a year and suddenly decide it's too much for him or leave the mother out on the streets.  I know it would have to be much more in depth and documented for it to be made into an option, but it just seems kind of off how people will say a woman is exercising her choice in abortion, but a man who doesn't want a baby is a deadbeat. Or how a man should own up to his actions, but seemingly ignore that women are able to pretty much erase their actions even when the man wants to own up."

TumblrInAction,3dxveh,tradingsexformemes,10,Mon Jul 20 16:45:24 2015 UTC,"Alright, time to refute.  1) Men are more likely to be the victims of pretty much every violent crime other than rape. This isn't a complaint, it's just a fact of life. If you don't feel safe (whether you're a man or a woman) buy a fucking gun.  2) Yeah, it sure as hell is prevalent. Someone I know and love was raped just a few weeks of living on a college campus (the same one as me). Except that self flagellation does fucking nothing. The average guy feeling privileged for not having to worry about rape does jack shit. You wanna teach your boy something that'll actually help people? Teach him to walk girls home. Teach him to keep an eye out for shady looking guys following girls. Teach him to ask girls if someone is bothering her when a guy seems aggressive toward her.  3) I have literally never heard a single person call a rape victim a slut. Ever. And for that matter, I've talked to plenty of pretty old fashioned and conservative guys who think that shit like banging a different girl every other night and cheating on your girlfriend is bad. I hate slut shaming, but I'm pretty sure slut shaming is waning by the day.  4) I'm an open bisexual. I have never been harassed for it in my life. Does that mean that the LGBTQ community doesn't take a whole lot of shit? Absolutely not. But once again, what the fuck does feeling bad because something doesn't happen to you do? Absolutely nothing.  5) In my public school high school, sleeveless shirts were banned for boys. Girls could wear tank tops all they wanted. Yeah, public schools don't want you wearing ridiculously short shorts and shirts that don't even cover your belly button. But if guys were to try to wear anything similar, they would be told to wear something different all the same. Women tend to dress more scantily. That's why the dress codes usually apply to them.  6) We already know that a single woman who is the head of her household makes around 98% of what a man would in his same situation. Stop talking out your ass with misleading statistics that have been disproved time and time again.  7) I'll actually give you this one. Men are disproportionately represented in the media. I was so fucking happy when Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare finally allowed you to play as a woman in multiplayer. We really do need to improve the amount of female representation.  8) ...and at the same time, that's part of the reason much of the schooling system is somewhat biased against boys. Boys act out more, have more energy, and are less complacent. Thus, far more boys are diagnosed with ADD, and far more boys are sent to the office.  9) You pulled that entire first paragraph straight out of your ass.  10) What a privilege it is to constantly have societal pressure put on you to be having lots of sex. It's not like a lot of guys think they're unlovable losers for not getting laid by the time they're 20.  11) Condoms cost 50 cents. Plan B pills cost around $60. Abortion is legal. If a guy refuses to wear a condom? Refuse to have sex with him. Female condoms exist, for that matter.   But above all, feeling bad because a problem doesn't apply to you changes nothing and improves nothing."

The only recognizable minority in Britain are Indian people (Which is why the British Curry war, where British and Indian curry sellers constantly fight over which of their curries truly represent the flavor of curry even remotely happened, and it also explains why there are so many curry shops in Britain) and very tiny Asian populations here and there.

Furthermore, compared with historical actions, Bitcoin and such are more in line with gold ingots than dollar bills.  And finally: Your definition of currency makes literally almost anything currency. It's pretty much worthless as a definition. It's also wrong. For example, buckskin in america was a huge commodity money. It's the reason americans tend to refer to dollars as ""bucks."" For quite a bit more expendable, Cigarettes are a valueable trade commodity in several situations where they are rare, and they tend to be on the perishable side.  I'd argue one of the best definitions for money is: ""Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socioeconomic context""  That first bit however, does disqualify BTC, as the places that accept BTC payment are few and far between."

TumblrInAction,3dy56z,stillnotking,13,Mon Jul 20 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"That is actually a very good question. However, presence or absence of such people on the uni grounds on daily basis shouldn't matter as to whether such policy is reasonable or not. If they happen to be there, they're not 'free to fuck' just because they can't say no.  I might actually have negative perception of humanity, but I'm sure there would be possible to find an idiot or two who'd require the existence of this kind of rules. It doesn't make all disabled people 'institutionally incapable' of giving consent, so the title is a bit of a bait here."
TumblrInAction,3dy56z,Dhuz,16,Mon Jul 20 14:50:13 2015 UTC,"So the policy is, at best, the equivalent of ""Don't hunt wildebeest on school grounds,"" but with more asinine political signaling."

It makes a pretty big difference on whether developing the policy was worthwhile. And another thing: why the fuck does a university have a definition of sexual consent? Last time I checked, that is a matter for the law."
TumblrInAction,3dy56z,tubefox,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Seems like it specifically covers cases of persons unable to give consent at all (in the same vein as an unconscious person). That looks logical.  Besides, the article state that it's a fix of an error in the previous redaction which read:   persons who have a physical and/or mental impairment are unable to give consent   Meaning that one couldn't have sex with, say, a deaf person because they, presumably, couldn't give consent. Which is completely dumb. So, they actually eased the rule.  P.S.  However, I can hardly imagine a conscious person who can't communicate completely due to disability. Something like Stephen Hawking without his voice synthesizer."

Part of  the reason the Mexican government did not want to extradite El Chapo to the US is because they don't want anyone know just how far compromised the Mexican government is by the Sinaloa Cartel.

Bottom line is I shouldn't have to clean my rifle before during and after a firefight to have the piece of mind that it'll go bang when I pull the trigger.

Christians believe in a specific god so obviously it wouldn't make sense to say that everyone that believes in a god is a Christian. That part makes sense... But feminists believe in equal rights for men and women, right? And I'm not talking tumblr ""feminists"" that actually believe women are superior. I mean, to be an actual feminist, at the bare minimum you believe that all sexes should have the same rights. So it does make sense that if you ""believe in equal rights"", feminism falls under that umbrella. As would believing all races should have the same rights. Otherwise, what does ""believing in equal rights"" even mean? I think a better metaphor would be ""If you believe in a god then you're religious"", right?

TumblrInAction,3du2we,Spurioun,4,Mon Jul 20 00:07:49 2015 UTC,Feminists like to use conventional male gender roles to advance their cause while espousing they are trying to get rid of them.  One cornerstone of the male gender role that people tend to forget is that men are supposed to put women's needs before their own.  This is best exemplified in how feminists advocate and legislate domestic violence.    Domestic violence is always treated as a male perpetrator and a female victim even though all non-feminist research shows that domestic violence is equally perpetrated between the sexes.  If men didn't have the conditioning to put women's needs before their own than the Duluth Model and the subsequent primary aggressor laws wouldn't have made it into general society.  If men didn't put women before themselves than the original VAWA wouldn't have been written into law which prohibited shelters getting money that assisted battered men and kept money from researching ways to assist men in abusive relationships.
TumblrInAction,3du2we,ckiemnstr345,2,Mon Jul 20 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"Traditionalism says women are victims of men and require unique treatment and protection.

I'm not really interested in feminism or gender politics, but I think good public policy isn't as simple as splitting a group in some way and then duplicating services exactly.

You need statistical evidence that sometimes men are abused in relationships and need a place to go? You really need facts and figures for that? Do you need facts and figures before you believe that males and rape and they deserve shelters too.   Dear god, maybe you can't see how insane this statement is..but would anyone EVER say this about women who are raped, or abused?

TumblrInAction,3du2we,TheKickboxingGuy,11,Mon Jul 20 01:15:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain about everyone, but I'll use my argument for why I don't want to be called a feminist, and maybe that will help?   I believe in equal rights for races, orientations, sex, and whatever other lines we can draw between people. I don't want to be called a feminist because many of the feminists that I know use their beliefs as a weapon to attack others, to get retribution for perceived slights against themselves. I am certain most feminists aren't like that, but I don't want to associate with a group that has such visible members if I don't have to be to accomplish my goals. We might be allies, but I don't want to say that I am one with them.   As an example of two people who specifically turned me away from feminism: I was at lunch with two female feminists, and they were complaining about guys who leave them unsatisfied. I tried to empathize by sharing a story about a male friend of mine who was, forgive my crudeness, blue balled by his girlfriend. They giggled and told me ""serves him right, because men do that all the time."" Before that day, I assumed Tumblr feminists didn't exist in the real world.   Labels are only useful if you can back them, one hundred percent. I can't back the feminist label, so I don't use it, and I will fight to avoid being called one, no matter what agreements we might have."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,kailrik,5,Sun Jul 19 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"But wouldn't a metaphor for that be ""I don't believe in a god but I don't want to be called an atheist because they tend to act like self righteous jackasses online""? Regardless of how the most vocal members of that group are, that doesn't mean the majority are like that. I'm a man and I believe in and agree with everything you mentioned but I still consider myself a feminist because if all real feminists distance themselves from it then its just left to the nutjobs and it's a self fulfilling prophecy."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,Spurioun,13,Sun Jul 19 21:24:25 2015 UTC,"No, the metaphor difference is a Muslim believes in a god, just as a Christian does. Same god, even. But fairly different approaches in how to go about worship and life and whatnot.   Likewise, the stated goal of ""equality of sexes"" can be approached from tearing down the rights of the higher side, raising up the rights of the lower side, doing both... AND on top of that, could be approached as ""equality of outcome of the sexes"", which can be approached by forcing successful people of one gender to quit so that less successful people of the other gender can participate (such as making men required to lift 300 lbs in firefighting, but women only 125 lbs, effectively reducing the amount of qualifying men but having a cakewalk for women, to get the equality of outcome of 50/50, when if opportunity was equal, the outcome would be very different and heavily male-weighted since the physical job of firefighter better suits stronger upper body strength).  You see, there is a huge variety of ways of doing things. Even for those who are in Feminism, it's full of ""Deep Rifts"": Equity Feminists hate Result-based Feminists, Sex-negative Feminists hate Sex-positive Feminists... To use the religion example, these are the Catholic and Protestant and Mormon Christians. Then you have the MRAs, who also aim for equal rights but by dealing with the male side, not the female side. We'll allocate them to the muslims: Same god, different approach, some Christians really don't like 'em, and they don't like a lot of Christians either, but their prophet did appear in the other scriptures (the foremost MRA to many is a woman who used to open women's shelters before switching upon realizing the need for men's shelters where she lives). And then you have the egalitarians, the jews: No one likes them, but technically their script is the baseline for both of the others."

That argument is constantly parroted by feminists to try to monopolize equality (which is especially shitty when 99.9% of the feminists that will use that argument don't give a single fuck about actual equality). It doesn't take into account egalitarians, humanists, etc etc.   Similarly, ""if you believe in god you're a Christian"" fails to take into account any other monotheistic religion, and by a little stretching any religion."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,Riseagainstyou,2,Sun Jul 19 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"I agree. But I think the analogy touches on a point worth making.  If you ask someone ""do you believe in God"" and they say ""yes"". You don't really learn a lot because belief in God can mean anything from the giant bearded guy in the sky to "" everyone has good in them"" to ""the laws of physics"". And likewise, I don't think feminism is a well defined term and what constitutes feminism is going to be something different to different people who identify as such.  So instead of saying ""feminism sucks because of the definition I have given it"", people would be better off dropping the word all together and focusing on more concrete ideas that suck.  ""I flew up in the sky and there was no giant man"" is a better statement then ""religion is wrong because I flew up in the sky and there is no giant man""."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,captnyoss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:30:59 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, no one has a problem with feminism if it means equal rights for men and women... and the feminists say that's what it means... but the people on here say ""That's not what it means! It means [list of bad things they've heard radical feminists say]! I'm not a feminist because I don't agree with all those things.""  But here's the thing, regardless of what the vocal, militant feminists say, feminism, at it's core, is about equality. Like, I don't like the beliefs of radical Republicans. They're ignorant. But I know that to be a Republican, you don't need to be a gun toting bigot because, at it's core, Republicanism is basically just the belief in small government that does little more than protect the rights of citizens. That's it. You don't have to hate Mexicans or gay people. You don't have to be a Christian. I don't quite agree with Republicanism's core principles but I know they aren't what Fox News wants them to be.  If you believe that the government shouldn't get involved with things like health care and should only exist to protect it's citizens... then you're a republican, whether you agree with the things Fox News says or not.  It's the same with feminism. Yes, there are nuthobs in every group but since, whether you like it or not, if you believe that all sexes and genders should have the same rights, that makes you a feminist. Which means those extremists are the minority. You don't have to agree with the views of the extremists in order to still be pro civil rights."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,Spurioun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"I highly agree.

TumblrInAction,3du2we,CamlinDomino88,20,Sun Jul 19 16:17:31 2015 UTC,"""If you believe in God, you're a Christian no matter what"" is wrong because...  The three Abrahamic religions all believe in the same god, just by a different name. So, believing in God doesn't immediately make me a Christian - theoretically, I could be a Muslim or a Jew.  If I was to say that and couple it with the OP's final point: ""WHAT'S THAT? THIS ARGUMENT IS WRONG/RETARDED/ASININE?!"" Then OP would say ""So are arguments about Feminism when people say 'I'm an egalitarian!'"" - which OP more or less said (without the Egalitarian part).  Another analogy is like when Tumblrinas say ""if you don't like Feminism, then get back in the kitchen."" The proper response to call out the bullshit is to say ""if blacks aren't Republicans, then get back on the cotton farms as slaves!"" Tumblrinas respond to the GOP quip by saying ""THE GOP HAS CHANGED!"" Well, so has the Feminist movement. And that's the point.  It's a slippery slope trap."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,kami232,3,Sun Jul 19 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"Slight nitpick: whether they are all the same god depends on how you look at it. Does the belief in the trinity really mean you are are talking about the same god as the rabbi down the street? From the Christian point of view, the rabbi is talking about God, just not all of him, but the Jewish side could reasobly argue that by adding all those other things which they would view to be false, it stopped being their god and became something else entirely.   As for Muslims, they teach that the god they believe in is the one that talked to the prophets behind the other religions, but that the other religions got it wrong. From their point of view, it's all the same god, but the other side just gets all the details wrong, while from the point of view of the other religions, these guys are essentially inventing a new god that happened to borrow a lot of ideas from them.  To look at it another way, I've heard that some Hindu groups accept the divinity of Christ and the existence of the Christian God. But they do so in the context of Hinduism, where Christ is just an incarnation, much like Krishna, and that God is just one of 330 million. From their point of view, this is sensible. From the Christian point of view, this is a rejection of everything that Christians believe. Saying that all three abrahamic religions believe in the same god despite their differences is kind of like saying that Christians and those Hindus believe in the same god.   At what point do the different understandings of who this god is, what he is like, his history with humans and the cosmology around him become a belief in something else? Can one reject major ascertions about a god, and posit very different ones, and still be talking about the same god? It's not quite so clear cut."

Extremists of certain religions will suicide bomb for their beliefs but the TRUE followers of said religion is going to ignore it and just say ""those are just extremists, they don't represent the whole"". And you should do the same. I'm still calling myself a feminist because I know what feminism is, despite the actions of a few extremists in the media."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,Dark_magician_girl,4,Tue Jul 21 07:43:55 2015 UTC,"If only it were ""a few crazy feminazi's on tumblr"". I wish it was! The problem is that (at least when it comes to ""pop"" feminism) the crazies have taken over. Jessica Valenti has a column in The Guardian. Zerlina Maxwell wrote an op-ed that said, ""In important ways, [the presumption of innocence] is wrong. We should believe, as a matter of default, what an accuser says."" It was published in The Washington Post!. Then there's Jezebel, Huffington Post, ... I could go on and on.  And it's not just non-feminists saying these things. Amanda Marcotte (and I will never stop being amazed that this person is a prominent feminist spokesperson) has said that radical feminism doesn't really exist any more. She didn't mean that the radicals had gone away. She meant they had won."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,PokerAndBeer,3,Sun Jul 19 18:23:41 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, this a counter argument. It's only meant to point out the flaws in the arguments of radical feminists who claim that you either agree with them, or you want to roll back women's rights to where they were a century or two ago. Their argument is based on an inability to distinguish between equality for women and the radical agenda.   That you can call yourself a feminist and not be a radical nutcase is not in dispute. Ths question is, can you believe in equality and yet reject the label of feminism?   I think the only reasonable answer is yes. People can choose to accept or reject whatever labels they wish. The argument that you are automatically a feminist if you believe in equality assumes that we are all using the term in a strictly technical sense, that it has no other connotations, baggage, or alternate definitions which one might wish to avoid, and everyone knows that the word only means equality.  Once we acknowledge that feminism can and often does mean more than just the belief in equality between the sexes, the argument becomes pointless. The believer in equality who rejects the label will obviously agree that, given the strict definition, they would be considered a feminist. That ceases to be a matter of identification and simply a matter of logic. Just as if I went in to the office of my local Democrats and asked them if they like the structure of America's government, and pointed out that those who agreed approve of a republic, and are therefore republicans. Technically true, but not really relevant to the issues and not something that changes the way the label themselves.   Basically, this whole song and dance exists because people don't start their self-identification with a boilerplate statement about ""if by feminism you mean equality and only equality..."""
TumblrInAction,3du2we,MakeltStop,4,Sun Jul 19 20:14:56 2015 UTC,"Think you missed the point, in that ""believing in equal rights for women"" defines a number of groups who all think doing so comes with different connotations on what those rights are and how to achieve them, same as groups believing in a God have different views on what that God is and how to best follow it.  Claiming that there is only one true way to believe in equal rights is quite shortsighted. But that is what is done, and what is being addressed. No All Feminists Are Crazy required."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,HerpthouaDerp,0,Sun Jul 19 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"This is a little better than what others have said. Though, being the person that says ""if you believe in equal rights, you're a feminist"", I always acknowledge and clarify that being a feminist doesn't have to mean being a feminazi.  Edit: I also want to say that there really is only one way to be a christian and one way to be a feminist. People will cherry pick or skew the definitions to fit whatever definition is convenient for them. But it really is stupid to call yourself something if you're just not. If you want to believe in God but not follow the rules of Christianity, then just call yourself something else that actually fits your beliefs. If you want all men to die, then call yourself something other than feminist, because it's not what you are."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,Dark_magician_girl,5,Sun Jul 19 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"Not really. There are plenty of Christian denominations, and plenty of Feminist waves and banners. Their not following your rules doesn't make any more difference than you not following theirs.  Pushing the One True Doctrine gets you holy wars. And nobody wants those. They're dreadfully out of fashion."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,HerpthouaDerp,2,Sun Jul 19 19:18:51 2015 UTC,"A couple decades ago, the Feminist movement was very transphobic. Does that mean they weren't feminists?   A century ago, feminism was defined by women's suffrage, or the right to vote and be elected. Does the fact that they didn't believe in the modern definition of feminism strip them of the feminist title?   Just because someone doesn't fit YOUR definition of something doesn't mean that other people can't do the same. And unfortunately, no feminist in the world is gonna label themselves as a feminazi.   I don't understand why, if someone says that they're not a feminist, but they are for equal rights, or an egalitarian, how that's wrong, or offensive to feminists?"
TumblrInAction,3du2we,brutinator,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:39:07 2015 UTC,"Just like with Christianity there are multiple subgroups of Feminism with ideologies that differ. Not everyone agrees with the subgroups and find it easier to label themselves as egalitarian/humanist.   Side note: I think it's wonderful that feminist fight for equality, but also disheartening that anytime men's issues are brought up, they seem to turn a blind eye or blame it on men."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,BALROGG,2,Sun Jul 19 20:14:07 2015 UTC,"You just said in one post that there are subgroups of Feminism, but that ""they"" are all against men's rights issues, as if they are a homogenous group.

TumblrInAction,3du2we,BALROGG,2,Sun Jul 19 19:38:28 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt that (sure, maybe larger than tumblr but definitely not the majority) but am not sure if I'm right or if it's just wishful thinking. I'd rather say the extremists are the loundest of all the subgroups, just like - and there the metaphor is again very fitting - with christians (or all religious groups for that matter)."

TumblrInAction,3du2we,danniofdoom,0,Sun Jul 19 23:20:07 2015 UTC,"If you acknowledge the extremists' ridiculousness but insist on calling yourself the same thing they do, a 'feminist', you can't possibly blame other people for assuming one meaning when you meant the other, especially if you don't clarify. What you're doing is somewhat akin to a regular Muslim calling himself a terrorist even though he isn't one, and getting defensive when people associate him with terrorists.  If the crazy and the militant are using the word you use to define your thoughts to define theirs, then you should probably find a different word - after all, you have different thoughts. It doesn't matter what the word originally meant or represented, the word has evolved and been adapted to mean something else. Why would you purposefully use a word people could confuse with those crazy people when you could just use something less ambiguous, like ""equalist"" or ""egalitarian""?  I admit, it's not really fair. It's a murky situation created by branching ideologies. At some point we have to start using different words, otherwise nobody's going to have any idea what people are saying about their beliefs, and clarity there is important.  If you don't want to be associated with them, don't call yourself the same thing as them."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,AngryPacman,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:38:16 2015 UTC,"I guess I expected the intelligent people on the subreddit to take half a second to look up the definition of feminist. Or maybe use their brain and not assume things. I understand if the average joe who gets all of his info from the media gets them confused, but surely if you're going to talk so strongly about the subject, perhaps you should know a bit about it first? At least the literal definition?  The word has not evolved to mean something else, it is only the very minority on tumblr that are extremists and you only hear about them because it's what the media thinks is entertaining. It would be absurd to redefine myself or my beliefs because a minority of extremists took the definition too far. This whole new wave of feminism is going to blow over as soon as people stop giving them this ridiculous amount of attention. Until then, I intend to continue telling people to delve into feminism and not be afraid to call themselves feminists if they believe in equal rights for women and men. Egalitarian is extremely pretentious and any time I hear it I'm just picturing a neckbear saying ""ohh hurr hurr I'm an egalitarian i'm too educated to call myself a crazy feminist!""  Why can't people just call the extremists feminazis like they have been and leave it at that?   If I say ""If you believe in equal rights, you're a feminist"" and someone tells me that's not true and they're actually an egalitarian, then fine, but you look like a douche. There's no reason to start bringing your hate onto real feminists because of the actions of few. I shouldn't even have to tell you this.  THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS POST: Ignore the rest if you want to:  The equivalent is a muslim calling himself a muslim. Not a muslim calling himself a terrorist. Because the media only portrays the terrorist-muslims. The equivalent is someone assuming you're a terrorist when you say muslim.  ""If the crazy and the militant are using the word you use to define your thoughts to define theirs, then you should probably find a different word"" Would you tell this to a muslim who has been practicing his religion for decades, but in the recent years extremists going by the same title have been commiting mass murder? No, because that's ridiculous."
TumblrInAction,3du2we,Dark_magician_girl,2,Sun Jul 19 18:53:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you should use the same word to represent two completely different schools of thought just because theirs only exists in society because of media sensations.   It would be absurd to redefine myself or my beliefs because a minority of extremists took the definition too far.   If Martin Luther and his contemporaries had thought the same thing, nobody would be calling themselves a protestant. That movement was born out of a minority stretching a definition to their own benefit, was it absurd of protestants to start calling themselves different things? (I'm not comparing feminism to a religion, just giving an analogy for the way movements branch.)   Egalitarian is extremely pretentious and any time I hear it I'm just picturing a neckbear saying ""ohh hurr hurr I'm an egalitarian i'm too educated to call myself a crazy feminist!""   You're right, 'egalitarian' does seem pretentious (as it's only used by the pretentious and those who avoid the negative connotations of 'feminist'), but 'feminist' is associated with radical people who believe different things. Using either word has a positive and a negative. Also, I am not a neckbear!   There's no reason to start bringing your hate onto real feminists because of the actions of few.   I'm not sure what you're referring to here. I don't hate 'real feminists', I'm pretty sure I never implied that I do. I recognise the two very distinct groups - I sympathise and agree with one group, and hold the other in great disdain.   Would you tell this to a muslim who has been practicing his religion for decades [...]   I wouldn't tell him to call himself something different. However, if he lived in my country, I would tell him to be cautious and clarify his beliefs. People make assumptions, and media sensationalism is real and effective. It is unfair that someone should have to make extra effort to clarify their beliefs, but I certainly wouldn't call it ridiculous."

No, you'll say ""Jenny"" because that's what she is called now and it would be confusing and kinda disrespectful to her current name choice otherwise.

Dogs can't consent, so essentially you're forcing harm upon them. It's no different to kicking a puppy (from a logic of the law standpoint). Also, I'm sure most PoC are against animal fighting. No, an animal rights activist are not racist, they are pretty egalitarian when it comes to their activism. Live sushi is a cultural thing, but to an animal rights activist, it's fucking cruel and the culture is cruel and should change.  The point of privilege is a good point, but to dismiss the movement because it's not ""inclusive of PoC"" is just wrong. Yes white people didn't have to be activists for their own rights. That probably has a major correlation with the demographics of the animal rights activists (if you have to pick a protest to go to, the right to equal education for you and your kids is probably more important to fight for than an animal testing ban). It is a certain privilege to be able to prioritize the advancement of another species, but the movement is completely open to PoC who agree that the exploitation and cruelty towards animals are abominable and should be stamped out."

It talked about how feminism in the last decade or so has said ""hey you keep your name or take your husband's and both are valid choices"" and said that was wrong because it upholds the patriarchy or whatever and feminists shouldn't pussyfoot around questioning women who change their names because it doesn't matter if someone's feelings get hurt (this from the same movement that's obsessed with making sure no one's feelings ever get hurt.)

Yelling at the person triggering you does absolutely nothing to help, and ironically puts the thing that's bothering you in front of your mind.   Let me put it this way. Let's say you're an ex cigarette smoker. You're watching TV and a smoking ad comes on (I know they don't, but bare with me). You then go online and make a post about how upset you are that the ad came on, you say it's making you want to smoke. This isn't addressing the problem, you're effectively making the craving longer (on average a craving lasts 4 minutes), and you are now more likely to smoke.   With serious shit, you would never do this because you wouldn't want to fall into your old ways (or PTSD). You'd handle it the healthy way. My message here is: fuck tumblr. They complain about appropriating culture, well they're actually appropriating rehabilitation culture. This shit effects me, and many people I know. It's disgusting that they want to flaunt their problems because they thinks it gives them an excuse."

It's people who are clinging to heterosexual privilege while having a sexuality that could be described as bisexual/heteromantic or 'bisexual with a preference'.  As I noted in another comment on this thread, without fail the guys (and gals, but girls seem quicker to adopt 'bi' as their label) who identify as ""heteroflexible"" are usually behaving in heavy casual sex with the same sex (I worded it more crudely in the other post :P) but quick to deny bisexuality.

TumblrInAction,3dum5l,TheEmpiresBeer,4,Sun Jul 19 18:01:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Or heterosexual with a slight interest in the same sex, but not nearly enough to be considered bi. Like 95% of the time you like the opposite sex, but there is that 5% that you find someone of the same sex attractive. I guess you could call it bisexual because of the slight interest, but the chances of being attracted to the someone of the same sex are so low that it generally won't happen. On the Kinsey Scale true bisexuality would be close to 50% rather than 75%. I believe the Kinsey Scale calls it Hetero leaning or hetero preference (something like that at least, I'm no expert). Obviously the Kinsey Scale is old and pretty outdated, but like the Myers-Briggs personality test, is still kind of accepted and used today by psychologists."
TumblrInAction,3dum5l,PurityDVoyd,5,Sun Jul 19 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"I'm heteroflexible. For the most part, I'm into women, and not generally attracted to men in the slightest. However, that doesn't keep me from having sex with a man (you don't always have to be physically attracted to someone to enjoy sex with them, after all), and on rare occasions I even find myself attracted to a man... if they're incredibly feminine in appearance.  I am not bisexual. I am not attracted to masculine features, and the only time I've ever been attracted to a man is when they look more like women than men. I just don't let my attraction dictate who I'm willing to have sex with, if the moment is right. Sex is sex, and sex is fun.  I'm ""hetero""... but I'm also ""flexible"".  Hence the term."

That's NOT what bisexuality is.   Oh god cringe. That very well can be how people experience their bisexuality, and that's erasing a huge chunk of the bisexual population by saying that. Most of my bisexual guy and girl friends are currently in opposite gender relationships and all fall between like 2%-10% attracted to their same sex. That's the majority of bisexuality. The ""50/50"" bisexual is a lot less common than people seem to think it is, and it's a simplistic way of breaking down bisexuality anyway. For instance, in terms of attraction I could be considered 50/50 because I'm just fucking happy looking at attractive naked people, but when it comes to who I'm actually attracted to in terms of having sex with? That changes that ""50/50"" number dramatically, more like ""90/10"" in favour of men."
TumblrInAction,3dum5l,Ocisaac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"I never said bisexuality had to be 50/50, but my point is that it shouldn't be used for people who have a curiosity or a passing interest in their non-preferred sex. You're still bisexual because you have more than just an occasional interest in women while being primarily attracted to men."
TumblrInAction,3dum5l,doktormabuse,3,Mon Jul 20 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by ""curiosity"" or ""passing interest"". Nobody should be stuck with the 'bisexual' label because they gave a blowjob one time in college or because they had a sapphic hookup one time. But if you continue to have fantasies, seek out same-sex encounters, all that? What else would that be besides bisexual? I think the issue here might be that the word ""heteroflexible"" has been tainted by truly bisexual people adopting it because it sounds more ""heteronormative"" than ""bisexual"", thus sort of tainting the term. Without fail every ""heteroflexible"" guy I know is actually bisexual. If the word were really used by guys and gals who have like a 1-2% interest in the same sex, in a very select few instances, I'd say ""okay"", but too often I notice it's used by people who just don't want to admit they're actually bisexual, even if their behaviour patterns are pretty much ""classic bisexual""."

I wanna start off by saying that this definition of ""heteroflexible"" is piss poor and isn't the actual definition of heteroflexible. If someone is heteroflexible, they're typically heterosexuals who find the opposite sex extremely appealing, but can also in some special cases find the same sex appealing as well, but no where near as much as they find the opposite sex appealing.  Again, this is about the Kinsey scale. Sexuality isn't always black and white. There are people who fall on the 0 (Exclusively heterosexual) of the Kinsey scale, just like how there are people who fall on the 6 (Exclusively homosexual, aka me) of the Kinsey scale. Someone who is heteroflexible would usually be a 1 (Predominately heterosexual, only incidentally homosexual).   People who are bisexual or pansexual typically end up being a 3 (Equally heterosexual and homosexual) on the Kinsey scale, but can sometimes be a 2 (Predominantly heterosexual, but more than incidentally homosexual) or a 4. (Predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual)  I hate ridiculous sexuality labels as much as the next guy, especially ones like demisexuality and sapiosexuality and all this stupid shit, but I can understand heteroflexible and homoflexible, but I wouldn't consider a heteroflexible person to be part of the LGBT movement.  TL;DR This picture is fucking stupid and gives the wrong definition of heteroflexibility because human sexuality is on a scale and isn't black and white."

TumblrInAction,3dv7vn,AmIACatOrWhat,63,Sun Jul 19 20:12:54 2015 UTC,I think we should engage and interest more people in STEM in general. There are waaaay too many people (of any gender) that don't know the first thing about science and don't care.   Why does it just have to be aimed at women?
TumblrInAction,3dv7vn,imanoctothorpe,36,Sun Jul 19 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"Because engineers recognize the need to reproduce in order to keep the human race from falling apart, but they don't want to fake a social life in order to do so, hence the best option is to have management make more women engineers so the male engineers can judge the fitness of mate easily (because their mate is also an engineer)and so not waste precious time and resources hunting and preforming the mating dance for said mate. They then notified the other STEM departments of this incredibly practical development and the heads of the fields concluded that the STEM initiative would be a great idea to preserve the human race while offering solid fringe benefits such as the prevention of loneliness and allowing the engineer to have a conversation with at least one person outside of work which would result in greater engineer happiness, resulting in better work effort, resulting in more profits.  The engineers win, management win, women win, the human race wins."
TumblrInAction,3dv7vn,DigDux,13,Mon Jul 20 04:30:05 2015 UTC,"I wish women entering STEM did so on their own passions and motivations rather than, to a large extent, some burning desire to prove that they are (=) to or better than men.  Hell I wish people were exposed to feasible and satisfying career paths earlier in their education so that people wouldn't just enter engineering because their parents said so or the $.  It's a good thing they are encouraging women regardless the means because honestly the women youth need good female role models in STEM if we are going to get honest women engineers.  God knows we need a female perspective on engineering solutions so that we can actually make things that satisfy the needs of both sexes.  I dont know how my oppinion will be recieved here  tl;dr: We need more feminine women engineers and a general push to introduce all youth to rewarding career paths."

I mean, diverse opinions are crucial to scientific advancement, and as long as all people in the field are qualified on their own merit, diversity is a good thing. However, we shouldn't have quotas or that sort of nonsense."
TumblrInAction,3dv7vn,imanoctothorpe,5,Mon Jul 20 05:42:22 2015 UTC,"Anyone that goes through the correct steps can be qualified in STEM, it's their personal motivation that often lacks.

I am using the term quota liberally.  Edit: at this point anything further would be circle jerking  preaching to the choir."
TumblrInAction,3dv7vn,Erik618,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:57:41 2015 UTC,"So everything you just said is why i started a GEMS (girls exploring  math and science) program when I was in Girl Scouts. I wanted young girls to see women in hard science fields, engineering, chemistry, biology, ect. Although a success I noticed that sometimes, the parents are the most toxic. Many either push their kid, who doesn't even WANT to do STEM because they want their kid to make money and have job security, other parents who have kids who are interested in it, stress how hard it is, and how its not for everyone (almost trying to deter them from it), instead of giving them to proper tools to foster a learning environment for their child to explore their interests. My favorite one of all time is when a dad told his daughter she should join STEM so she can find a husband to take care of her ( yea i'm from the south).  I've also noticed that even though its STEM everyone still wants it to be girly.. the first year we did it, we got feed back from parents that the model rockets were too ""boyish"" and destructive, they wanted to know if we can do something more ""girly"". All these things confused me, their daughters were getting a look inside a world they were never exposed to but your upset because it wasn't girly?. In a way it seems that even with in the community we're separating.     I wish I could do more to paint it in a better light, because I'm tired of the posts asking if being a girl in engineering is that bad, will I get ignored, will guys constantly hit on me, will teachers or my peers not listen to me because i'm a girl?"

TumblrInAction,3dyidl,TheLeakyBurrito,17,Mon Jul 20 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, the warbonnet is quite a sacred item to several Native American tribes. But other tribes who never historically wore them appropriated them long before whites did. To these tribes, they didn't have the same sacred meaning. I remember a post on TIA about a girl who felt guilty wearing her great-grandfather's warbonnet. Her great-grandfather was treasurer of the Creek Nation, and the Siouan tribes who originated the warbonnet would probably never have given one to a mere treasurer unless they did something absolutely outstanding for the community. The Siouan tribes weren't happy about these Native American outsiders appropriating their culture and now they're not happy about non-natives doing so.  But there are several differences between the traditional Dakota/Lakota/Nakota etc. warbonnet and those used by non-Siouan tribes and those worn by non-natives. The Siouan warbonnet is usually in earthy or warm colours and uses real eagle feathers set out in either a ""halo"" or a ""trail"" shape. The other tribes varied the shapes, sizes and colours yet were still allowed to use real eagle feathers. The ""hipster headdresses"", on the other hand, are a completely different kettle of fish. The makers can't use eagle feathers for legal reasons so they use duck feathers. They make them in all sorts of wild colours, shapes and sizes. The end product is usually distinguishable from the real thing and it's pretty obvious the wearer did not earn it. However, I understand why some Native Americans would be pretty pissed off at non-natives wearing an item unique to some of their cultures. It's a little like someone who isn't a high-ranking church official wearing a mitre."

I get told I'm a masculine gay guy (well, people say a lot ""You don't seem gay."" which I think is a nice way of saying ""You're not flaming stereotype."").   I actually do like somewhat feminine men, but there does come a point for me where if you have more feminine than masculine qualities, I lose attraction. It's crazy, I know, but holy shit, people attracted to men tend to like masculine/male qualities. It's funny how they never seem to jump on straight/bisexual women for wanting masculine men, but if a gay man prefers masculine men, he gets dogpiled by feminazis and LGBT radicals."
TumblrInAction,3dvdn2,multiplesarcasms31,15,Sun Jul 19 23:20:47 2015 UTC,"Part of why I avoid most LGBT groups these days. The ones I've joined have been rather intolerant of gay guys who aren't stereotypes. I remember being told that I shouldn't talk about the issues we face because I could ""pass for a straight guy.""  That was just the most recent one. When I was in the group I joined in early university and the one from high school, I was going through this embarrassing period in my life where I ""gayed"" myself up. Coincidently (or not), that also overlapped with my SJW phase."
TumblrInAction,3dvdn2,overcastwolf,6,Sun Jul 19 23:45:19 2015 UTC,"Same here, luckily I never had that SJW phase (or not one that I was aware of), and that ""straight-passing"" shit pisses me off, because it implies that the stereotype represents the majority and that ""straight-passing"" gay people aren't subjected to homophobia.   The modern LGBT community has a lot of similarities to modern feminism (probably because feminism absorbed in sometime in the late 90's) where there's this need to be ""altruistic"" and find everyone beautiful and wonderful. Unless they're a cis heterosexual white man or they don't live up to the community standards (being a stereotype) and agree with everything the radicals say. In which case it's fine to completely slander them and tell them to go kill themselves."

TumblrInAction,3dvdn2,xplodingminds,4,Mon Jul 20 10:35:00 2015 UTC,"The whole thing is so ironic, as feminists and the LGBT community constantly go on about how gays/lesbians/bisexuals are just like straight people, and how gender identity has nothing to do with your sexuality and blah blah blah. But then if you're a gay or bisexual man they expect to you be feminine and like feminine men or if you're a lesbian or bisexual woman they expect you to be masculine and like masculine women. They pretty much believe being non-heterosexual means you're automatically gender inverted.

What about women who like masculine men - are they misogynists for not being attracted to men with feminine characteristics??  I guess this belief is based on the assumption that men should naturally be attracted to feminine characteristics, and there's something wrong with them if they aren't. Hmmm, that sounds familiar - sort of like the argument that homosexuality is unnatural and wrong, maybe?"

TumblrInAction,3dushl,KnitBrewTimeTravel,2,Sun Jul 19 21:10:20 2015 UTC,An 'unpopular' opinion that will probably be quite popular on this subreddit: I think it's perfectly fine to shame people for being fat - it means that person isn't capable of taking care of themselves and exercising basic self-control. I don't mean someone who's a few pounds overweight or just not in shape but what we all imagine the TiTP mods to look like.

Do we shame them the same way we shame fat people? No.  They could quit smoking but maybe they're not capable of taking care of themselves and exercising basic self-control?

TumblrInAction,3dushl,neptuniumplutonium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:33:49 2015 UTC,"In America, or the state I'm from anyway, overweight people are charged for the extra seat so no one else is inconvenienced.

TumblrInAction,3dushl,Jacks_Girl,3,Mon Jul 20 05:37:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's not clear what I meant by shaming: I don't mean going up to people and insulting them or making snide comments behind their back. I mean making people aware of how they're inconveniencing others when they do (e.g., if they buy one seat but clearly need two and are encroaching on the space of the people next to them) and not treating being overweight as healthy Ã  la those HAES-ers."

I, for example, though not nearly heavy enough to need an extra seat by a long shot, will always give any person beside me the armrests on a plane so I don't inconvenience them by taking up more space than I need to. Maybe that's just me being self conscious about it but I always try to make sure I'm out of everyone else's way."

TumblrInAction,3dushl,lanternsinthesky,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:33:27 2015 UTC,"obligatory: found the fattie.    you think just because someone is fat that they are dumb?    Not necessarily. But it's been proven that obese people have lower cognitive ability. And by your response to my post, I've got a feeling your cognitive ability is on the lower side. Over Half of your argument is putting words into my mouth I never said.    or that only over weight people make shitty decisions about their health?   I literally never made that claim. My only statement was about fat people. I wasn't talking about anyone else so why would I be obligated to add other people's decisions?   if you wana be a nice person   I'll stop you right there. Again, another claim I never made. I am who I am and I'm happy with who I am. If you don't think I'm nice, the number of fucks I give is so small that it's probably negative. I used to be fat, I made the right choice for my body, for my life, and for my family to lose the weight. And I lost 80 pounds. And now I despise fat people who make excuses like ""but it hurts to work out"" or ""I don't want to starve myself"" or ""I don't wana be a skinny bitch, guys like big girls anyways"" or ""I have a slow metabolism"" or even ""I don't have time to lose weight"" and last but not least ""I have a condition"". Everyone of those excuses is a different way of saying ""I have zero will power"" and it disgusts me that I was like that. I've been fat my entire life. I grew up fat because my parents never taught me to eat properly, they were fat too. I found fat people hate, learned about what I was actually doing to my body and the burden I caused other people and how easy it is to lose weight, and I did what I needed to do. And quite frankly, it's been rather easy. For the first time in my life, I'm not overweight.   don't call anyone for fatties, that is just despicable     A fat person is a fattie. You'll be offended if I say anything that has the word fat.  Eating 5000 calories a day is despicable. (Not including mega athletes like the rock who actually use every calorie they eat)."
TumblrInAction,3dushl,__celli,3,Mon Jul 20 22:52:34 2015 UTC,"A fattie is clearly a derogatory term, it is something you use when you want to degrade and belittle people, so yeah that is despicable. And i am reading between the line, that doesn't make me stupid, which basically is your argument.   And the issue is that you didn't talk about anyone else, the original tumblr post was about all forms of bodyshaming, yet you decided to only focus on fat people. My point is that there are more than just overweight people who are unaware of the damage they are doing to their body.  And good for you, but you should still just be nice to people, even if they make decisions you don't agree with. People should not be shamed being unhealthy, it is counter productive.. and even if they are unhealthy doesn't mean that they should feel shitty about themselves.  Also, why is it wrong to be eating that many calories then? If it is not over consumption, then why is it an issue?"
TumblrInAction,3dushl,lanternsinthesky,0,Mon Jul 20 23:01:29 2015 UTC,"Before I make any claims or statements, I will quote exactly what you say. And I'll explain why later.    A fattie is clearly a derogatory term, it is something you use when you want to degrade and belittle people, so yeah that is despicable.   Alright, lets look at it this way. Nigg-r is a derogatory term, yes? Yet black people say it to each other all the time. Using the same line of defense, I was fat for over 9/10 of my life. Therefore, I'm allowed to use a term like fattie because it describes me for almost my entire life.    And i am reading between the line,    A.k.a. you're putting words into my mouth. Youre accusing me of things I never said. And you have no way of knowing if thats the true way I feel. I never said a fat person is dumb just for being fat and I never said only fat people make shitty decisions about their health. You assumed that is what I meant. And you know how that saying goes right?    that doesn't make me stupid,   again, never said you were stupid. But I just might now. ""lower cognitive ability"" is not the same as stupid. It just means you're not as smart as the average person. There's something like 20-30 IQ points between stupid and average.    which basically is your argument.   again putting words into my mouth. At no point in time did my argument ever have anything to do with calling you stupid for reading between the lines. But I might just call you stupid for how terrible your reading comprehension is.    And the issue is that you didn't talk about anyone else, the original tumblr post was about all forms of bodyshaming, yet you decided to only focus on fat people   For starters, I already stated that I have no obligation to include anyone else in my post. In my life, fat shaming is the number one type of body shaming I see (minus that angry fatties who call healthy girls skinny bitches or anorexic just because they have a normal body weight). Therefore, I was catering my response to the events that I am most familiar with. If I knew nothing about math and started making claims about it, that would make me kind of an idiot. I don't know much about other body shaming, so I left it out. And, even if i did know about other parts, i'm still not obligated to include them.    My point is that there are more than just overweight people who are unaware of the damage they are doing to their body.   Finally! You say something that makes sense. However, I am already fully aware of this. Theres smokers, drug users, alcholics, etc. However, the target of my post, again, was towards something that directly affects me.    And good for you, but you should still just be nice to people, .   first off, who the fuck are you to tell me what I should and shouldn't do? I'll have you know, in real life I'm a very giving and caring and nice person. But this is the goddamn internet for motherfucks sake. I come here to anonymously vent the shit I can't, or wont, say in real life. That's what fucking TiA is for, to make fun of stupid people.    even if they make decisions you don't agree with   this goes way more into than I care to explain so I'll try to keep it short. I don't hate fat people. I don't treat them different IRL. However, I have zero sympathy for their fat related struggles. Not to mention, your fat costs the general public (including yourself) 192 billion dollars a year for healthcare. A completely reversible and self inflicted condition costs 20% of our healthcare. So i have every right to be a little upset with fat people. But heres the thing, the only fat people that I truly hate are the ones that do the whole HAES thing. The ones who hate on skinny people. The ones who say being fat isn't unhealthy. The ones who report doctors for telling them they should lose weight. These people are stupid. Every single piece of scientific evidence says that being fat is very very unhealthy. I'm much less inclined to make fun of a person who understands their situation. But the HAES people, i will gladly ridicule them IRL as well as online.    People should not be shamed being unhealthy, it is counter productive.   False. there are countless stories of people who have lost weight becuase they were tired of being made fun of. Fat shaming is what got me to lose my weight and I thank those assholes every day. If it wasn't for them, I might still be huffing and puffing up the stairs instead of doing parkour and training in brazilian jujitsu.    and even if they are unhealthy doesn't mean that they should feel shitty about themselves.   it sure as fuck does! If you willfully make yourself unhealthy, you deserve to feel like shit. People with asthma and cancer and things like that have legitimate reasons. Fat people have zero real excuses for being fat. I only accept one thing. If a person grows up fat because of their parents, that was out of their control. But as an adult, they need to take the steps to lose the weight.    Also, why is it wrong to be eating that many calories then?   Are you aware of what the average human should be eating daily? roughly 2000 calories. Consuming more than you need is gluttony.   If it is not over consumption, then why is it an issue?   Now I'm starting to think you really are stupid. 5000 calories for the average person is more than double what they should be eating. Its way over consumption. So it is an issue. However, there is an exception, like I stated. Super athletes like the Rock and Michael Phelps and Vin Diesel eat ridiculous amounts of calories. However, they burn off every bit of that. Theyre like 5% body fat and they are ripped to shreds with muscle. They work out all day every day and they earn the right to eat that many calories. It's all about calories in>calories out. It's the most basic thermodynamics. Energy in needs to be energy out. a surplus of energy equals fat and a deficiency of energy equals burned fat. It's that simple. Eat less, lose weight."

TumblrInAction,3dud0d,Adreal19d,34,Sun Jul 19 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"No, because prison is an entirely different and very hostile enviroment. Doesn't mean he doesn't care about them, and the statistics are certainly very important, but in prison you're clammed together with a bunch of other convicts (atleast in the US), and you have little to no choice of where you are and who you associate with, so crime rates are going to go up, yet aren't reflective of life in the open.  The prison system is going to have a high rate of rape, assault and murder because it's an enviroment that harbors it, that's not a good thing and an issue I fervently believe that Americans needs to bring up, but living in a prison is very different from living free in the US.  Of course crime rates will go up in different locations in the US, but atleast people who aren't in prison have more freedom of movement and get to decide who they associate with. I really don't feel like the prison system is reflective of national rape or abuse stats in general, so atleast these statistics should note how much is from prison vs free reign society."

TumblrInAction,3dud0d,GenerallyDecent,12,Sun Jul 19 17:19:08 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure those numbers come from the CDC National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence survey.  The only reason why the numbers are pushed forward by feminists is because the standards for men and women are different when it comes to sexual violence.  When the same standard is actually used for both genders the 51% victims being male and the 40% of perpetrators being female is what is found in the data.

Let's say that these are all men, and all of these men are getting raped (not even close to being true).  The population of the United States is over 300 million.  The prison population (if they were all men getting raped) would still account for less than 1% of the total population.  If you think that singular .5% of the US population due to prison rape means that men get raped more than women, you're crazy.  What percentage of women do you realistically think have been raped?  Would the prison rapes make a difference?  It's not even close to 50/50 when it comes to rape.  Women are much more frequently the victims.  I'm not trying to white knight this thing, but I hate when people don't think about the math.  The prison population wouldn't make much of a difference, even if they were just men getting raped all of the time."
TumblrInAction,3dud0d,Linquist,0,Mon Jul 20 13:44:30 2015 UTC,"Depends, if you get raped five times, do we count this as five rapes, or one rape since it only happened to YOU. If we count it as one, your argument as for why even entertaining the notion is persuasive. If we count it as five, then not so much.   Next, what do we count as rape? Am I raping you if I coerce you into sex to protect you from others? After all, you're choosing to submit to me, because me pounding your little punk bitch ass is a slightly less horrific event than half the block pounding your little punk bitch ass.   No man, prison rape skews the numbers badly enough, that I don't find the notion of it skewing the overall numbers into a hair line male majority to be ridiculous.    What percentage of women do you realistically think have been raped?   Not a large one, that's for sure.  But I'm a shitlord and think ""I regretted having sex"" or ""I had two beers that night!"" isn't rape.   Oh, one last thing:   I'm really not trying to be a dick about this, but the prison population of the US is less than 3 million.   That's nice, but there is a turn over rate. The number of people who have served time in prison is MUCH higher, because the US justice system is shit.   Alright, commiting a cardinal sin, but my food is ready and I'm hungry, so I'm being lazy and using some numbers from wikipedia. In 2008, 1 in 31 American's were in prison, probation, or parole. Okay, not a legal expert, so I don't know if you can get on probation without serving a sentence. 92.9% of inmates in 2009 were male, so your assumption of 100% male population doesn't introduce enough error to actually care about in ridiculously rough napkin math.   So no, I'm not entirely sure I'd say the numbers skewing towards more male rape is ridiculous if you count prison rape. I'd find it believable."

I've been seeing this a lot from women saying IM GAY/BI AND IVE NEVER EVER FELT THE NEED TO RAPE OR CATCALL WHY CANT MEN STOP THEMSELVES HUH. Probably because you're not actually gay. I have most definitely seen lesbians catcall, and use cheesy pickup lines on women.

""Middle Eastern"" isn't a race. It isn't even an ethnicity. It's not anything. You, the Turk, the Armenian, and myself, we're all Caucasians. You have to go all the way to India to leave the Caucasian race. Perhaps you ought to google the word.   There's no hard lines, you can't say ""these ethnicities are Caucasian and these are Mongoloid""   I didn't. Other people, quite some time ago, did. Just because race has no biological or other scientific foundation doesn't mean it's not a ""thing"". It's a thing that, if you prefer, someone a long time ago made up based on incorrect science, and it stuck around.   I don't call black people African, because they could be Indian or Carribean.   Indians aren't black, they're brown.

Because the former is at best a geographical grouping, while the latter is a race. It is a race because smart people long ago decided that it was a race. They thought race was a biological grouping, we now know better, but the grouping still has a definition, and under that definition you are as Caucasian as AtatÃ¼rk and Jesus.   Nobody in their right mind would call an Indian man caucasian. Life is not an anthro lecture.   No, of course not. Had you read the link, you would have noticed that people in their right mind consider Indians (which is a nationality, so completely meaningless here, but nevertheless...) mostly Mongoloids.  Nobody in their right mind would be stupid enough to try to assert their knowledge of race to be superior to those who came up with the arbitrary fucking concept in the first place, but hey, here you are...

As someone who is a scientist who studies the Nordic, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls nords Caucasians. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""white family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Coolwhipidoid, which includes things from deer herders to lumberjacks to vikings. So your reasoning for calling a Nord a Caucasian is because random people ""call the white ones caucasian?"" Let's get Italians and Argentinians in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A Nord is a Nord and a member of the Caucasian family. But that's not what you said. You said a Nord is a Caucasian, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Caucasian family caucasian, which means you'd call Indians, Turks, and other ethnicities Caucasian, too.

TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,bmmbooshoot,2,Sun Jul 19 20:11:45 2015 UTC,What sort of history classes did you have where both Vietnam and Korea were skipped? Those are pretty central to the Cold War as the most notable flareups involving American troops.
TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,candycaneforestelf,2,Sun Jul 19 23:32:18 2015 UTC,"If you ask most high school graduates who attended a public school in recent years, I'd venture that less than half know of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.   I was fortunate enough to go to a privet school with a very good history department, but I went to community college for my prerequisites. Talking to my peers in class about things I assumed everyone was taught was an awakening. I remember a lot of students not knowing that in the past century China had closed itself off to the West until Nixon. Unrelated, the beginning of my freshman year was during the Libyan revolution and there were students who didn't know there were Muslims in Africa."
TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,citrus_mystic,4,Mon Jul 20 04:49:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on the public school. I attended a suburban one (class of 2009) and learned a fair bit in the mandatory courses, though some cultural stuff was glazed over.  Community College tends to be a mixed bag of students and isn't always the greatest indicator of what a high school teaches, though."

TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,seulgirv,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:15:02 2015 UTC,"But what if it's spray tan? How is spray tan different from black face?  I mean, other than black face being a very specific sort of racist caricature, while tanning is not meant to imitate a race, let alone demean it. Other than that, how is spray tan different?"
TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,bl1y,39,Mon Jul 20 12:32:08 2015 UTC,The intent behind each action is what makes it different. Black face was used by racists to mock and degrade Black people; spray tanning isn't exactly used to make a political or social point. Just to achieve a certain aesthetic that some people like.

TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,Billlington,21,Sun Jul 19 15:06:54 2015 UTC,To me it seems like she's trying to look like her half-sister (Kim Kardashian).

TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,KnightsoftheNi,26,Sun Jul 19 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah the ""blackface"" accusation is off. Blackface is making fun of black people by dressing up as a caricature. She desperately wants to be black, or at least, not white."

TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,mjigs,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:03 2015 UTC,"SJWs like to call it ""fetishizing black features on white people"" which I like to call bullshit. They're angry because supposedly the media considers those black features to be more beautiful on someone who's white than someone who is actually black, and it ends up in hissy fits that scream blackface/brownface and cultural appropriation. That's where the shit involving typically black hairstyles comes in too which is insanely dumb. Hair is hair."

Black people or whatever people they are talking about, the only ones who see it are those who are outside. This reminded me of Korea and other east asian countries, all those plastic surgeries are done to make them look more western, cause they think we have beautiful features."
TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,mjigs,14,Mon Jul 20 02:34:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm a total heathen but I don't see why everyone slams her. All I see is a typical teen girl who grew up being slammed by the media and ended up drastically changing her appearance to compensate. I don't see how that makes her tasteless or a try hard in any way. She's just known for having a rich girl style, taking a lot of selfies and being the half-sister of Kim."
TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,JacksFrosty,8,Tue Jul 21 18:03:58 2015 UTC,But even so that's just a look she wants. She likes how big lips and darker skin look on her and she is free to look that way. It's not like she's putting on blackface and making fun of people. She just wants to look a certain way. She's not the first girl to tan and use lip plumpers either.

TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,Andhareall,12,Sun Jul 19 17:48:04 2015 UTC,Full lips are attractive. Her lips before were non-existent. She even mentions in the new season of KUWTK that she got lip fillers because she was self-conscious of how thin her lips were.

TumblrInAction,3dtt2x,Whirledleaderpretend,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:07:35 2015 UTC,I think it's because she's 17 and she uses cosmetics like she's 30+ -- it overpowers her. Girl needs a lighter touch in front of the mirror.

No main character, no fanbase, no more show. Killing your main character is your big finisher. Even if you try to keep going, your ratings won't survive, and the studio will have your ass out on the street faster than you can say ""Praise the Sun"".

And then it hit me: the most privileged situations I can think of are because I'm disabled. Legit example: I have had a pizza delivery guy (granted one I'd chatted with before cause they were curious about some things) offer to help me buy groceries or anything like that if I happened to need it because of my disability. How many people can get a random acquiantance to offer that kind of assistance out of their free time by doing absolutely nothing at all? In no way did I ask for that offer or imply I needed it, and of course I politely refused.  With race, I don't think there's all that many privileges you can get as a black person in the USA, but I'll be damned if I can't name an example of a female friend being the subject of female privilege every fucking day of my life. Not ranting mind you; don't wanna come off as bitter about it because I'm not. It's quid pro quo: for every benefit there's a disadvantage, for example I can get people offering me help with physical tasks without even doing anything, but I've once been turned down by a girl because she cited ""genetics"" as a major selling point for her when looking for a partner. (heaven forbid your child be born with one leg and live a completely independent and unhindered lifestyle like me!!) So yeah with female privilege, by all means enjoy it while also having to deal with the downsides that do exist (as with any gender, race, etc), but let's not pretend it doesn't exist. Let's not pretend that women never have to worry about being let into a club, that women get offered free drinks and snacks at clubs all the time, that men typically are expected to and/or volunteer to pay for dinner or other services, or that there aren't employers out there who do surround themselves with women. (once worked for a law firm where the owner was a male, every single other worker was female except myself, which a female coworker was quick to point out to me)  Just insane how selective and bias these people are when I really think about it. Shouldn't act surprised given that wtf this is tumblr and this subreddit sees nonsense daily, and it's fairly obvious that these are bitter people who've been hurt by the world and need some excuse to label the world as wrong and evil so that they can feel better about themselves. Still, even if that's the motivation, you'd expect some of them to at least know what ""logic"" is, how to use it, and how to self-reflect and realize how flawed their arguments or stances are before coming up with another bit."

I'm lucky enough to have gotten decent ACT scores which got me academic scholarships.

This doesn't mean minorities are any less intelligent than white people, but think of it this way:  Bob has 100 apples, John has 30 pears. If you only take the top 10% from each, you'll have 10 flawless apples and 3 flawless pears. But what's that? We want an equal number of both? Well then, lets have 10 flawless apples, 3 flawless pears, and 7 pears that aren't that great. Oh dear, now it looks like the majority of pears aren't that great. Here's hoping the shoppers don't think it represents the whole population.

On a common TV show with, say, four main and eight secondary characters, the average representation of gays would round to zero if accurately portraying reality. (3% of 12 = 0.36) Among the non-bit characters, there would be about one gay every third show.  My experience is that TV shows have a lot more than one gay every third show, not counting possibly-gay passers-by who get one line and are never heard from again.  To put it in perspective against various Christian denominations: for every 10 gay characters, proportional representation would involve roughly 45 Catholics, 30 Baptists, 13 Methodists, 8 Lutherans, 5 Presbyterians, 4 Pentecostals, 3 Mormons, one Jehovah's Witness, and a couple of smaller denominations who maybe have a joint ecumenical representative or two."

Also I can't speak for all crimes but more whites are killed by blacks both by number and rate (especially by rate) than the inverse, we are just reluctant to make it news, in fact, following Michael Brown we had a string of black Americans deliberately attacking and attempting to kill white Americans (there was a rash of them in Baltimore) and the news and police agencies were always reluctant to call them hate crimes, even when survivors testified that they were deliberately singled out due to race.

Everyone was doing intricate gymnastics to change without exposing too much skin, but I wasn't thinking much of it.   I've been in locker rooms after my dance rehearsals since I was a young teen, I pretty much don't have zero modesty when it comes to nudity. I absentmindedly took off my sports clothes while talking to a guy in my class,  slapped a towel over my shoulder and walked towards the shower that was right next to my locker (note that after a 3-hour session of intense badminton, I was the only one to take a shower before going back to class at uni. Ew).   By the time I had put the water on, every single person in the locker room except the guy I was still talking to had taken flight. I am still puzzled to this day. Was it the nonchalant butt exposing? The deep trauma of a glimpse of a limp penis? The fact that I was kinda rubbing it in their face how filthy it is to go back in the world smelling like a bull in heat? After this day, I was always the only one to use the locker room with the shower in it.   I inadvertently asserted dominance over a fucking locker room. Still I don't think this whole thing was about straight guys being uncomfortable in front of my brief dick flaunting. While they never shared the locker room with me anymore, none of them changed their attitude toward me during class.   TL; DR : I call bullshit on this post."

People tend to forget that downvoting is meant to be used on irrelevant comments, not comments that actually stimulate conversation like poor /u/FireWankWithMe 's. First of all, the ant sexism part is a reference to the article linked to in the pic, and clearly a joke. Secondly, based on the pic, the ant has the physique of a queen (comparison in fist pic: Queen and male). So you can discuss all you want on what gender it should have been, the fact is it's a queen in the movie (the one in the movie is a carpenter ant and they have the same characteristics). I haven't seen the movie, but it looks like antman has the same length as workers, and workers are about as large males, while Antoine is a lot larger.    I honestly couldn't care less about what gender it should be, but if you want to discuss these topics then stay true to the facts.

That youâre encouraging 'Nice Guysâ and 'Male Entitlementâ, and telling men their value depends on their ability to fuck girls? Youâre perpetuating rape culture, and thatâs going to lead to women getting hurt when some guy who canât get a girl to sleep with him murders peopleâ¦ Because shitty people like you said, âLol, you canât get laid, so youâre a loser!â, therefore making them believe their worth is tied to how many women they fuck.

TumblrInAction,3dtsiz,garglemesh42,32,Sun Jul 19 13:33:21 2015 UTC,"This is how feminism reinforces traditional gender roles while simultaneously complaining about them.  If its men's responsibility to protect women, then men must be more powerful by default.  If that's the case, then equality of outcome isn't realistically possible, since men will always have certain types of advantages.    (Women have their own advantages as well but that's beside the point that I'm making.)"
TumblrInAction,3dtsiz,Castigale,5,Sun Jul 19 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"The only time a feminism argument ever turned out with my ex, was when I described a bar fight (a la that Snookie incident a few years back). The parable went as such:   In a bar fight situation, I generally won't intervene. At least not immediately. Whether or not the guy ""deserves"" the beating he's about to receive, why would I put my own physical safety in jeopardy for a stranger? As long as it's just a bit of a fight, big deal. Obviously nobody's going to let a guy get killed or sent to the hospital, but we're not going to get our nose broken over it. Why? Because men can take care of themselves, or at least we expect them to. So the calculus is: my safety > their safety, since presumably they're not yet in any real danger.   But now we get a barfight with a woman fighting a man. You are suddenly appalled that I've decided that my safety > her safety. Why? Because you presume that she's immediately in real danger. Why? Because she's a woman. Because she's weaker. She's therefore not equal, and needs my protection. How can someone who needs my protection also be my equal, at least physically? We protect children, because they're small, or incompetent.   The side-effect of total gender equality is that I will no longer prioritize your immediate safety over mine, since clearly you're in the same amount of danger as I would be, rather than in more. So you can't say that violence against women is worse than against men, and still have equality. The root of the argument is that you're weaker than me. And how can I respect that?   She stared at me for like five minutes, and then went ""I'd never thought about how men decide to act or not in those situations. I've always been the one watching."" (She's 5'9, 100 pounds soaking wet). ""It definitely poses an interesting idea that as far as men are concerned that idea stems from women being the weak ones."""

Note how, in your own example, the big brother doesn't turn around and punch himself in the face for being in the same group as they are- they fight the ones that are bullying you. They aren't going on a righteous crusade against all seniors, which is what you want.

That a persons actions fall on them, not on everyone like them   This is the best part of it.  A group is not culpable for the behavior of individuals or a small minority of that group.  It's the exact same reason why, when some ISIS fuckface shoots up a beach, the entirety of the world's Muslim population isn't responsible simply because they're Muslim.  The exact same reason why, when a black person in Baltimore busts up a CVS during a protest, the other protesters are not responsible for the vandalism.  It's why I and other gay people are not responsible for Sandusky's rape of children in the Penn State locker room.  Why all Israeli Jews aren't responsible for the actions of ultra-conservative politicians and IDF members who encourage the displacement and killing of Palestinian minorities, and why all Palestinians aren't responsible for extremists firing rockets into Israel.  All of these are horrible things that need to be dealt with.  It's often the most effective when tangential or similar groups help to deal with those problems.

I really can't sit any other way in a public space,even if I'm trying to sit small my knee or foot will be in the aisle when on the end of a row, I will have to stand up to let you through when in an row seat, I will likely be in your arm space, and on an airplane my knees will be in your back. You think I like that? I don't. Most large men try their best not to take up more space than necessary, in my opinion, and the truth is we really don't have too. What are they going to do move me? Public spaces suck balls and are inconvenient for everyone because capacity not comfort is the prime objective. Manspreading for me is not a choice it's a consequence of my size. Doubly so for men even larger than myself. I am going to sit in a normal way for a man of my size, and they can deal with the space ""dominance"".

I had downed 2 large bottles of wine, a beer and some jack, and i was feeling pretty fucking great.  then i tried to stand.  see, i don't remember fuck all from about halfway into the second bottle of wine, so from this point until i hit the couch part, its all secondhand  apparently, i stood up, fell to my knees, and puked. Then i got up and staggered into the neigbors lawn and fell down face first and decided it was nap time.  this freaked out one of the party goers (it was new years eve) who was convinced if anyone found me face down in my own puke shit drunk in the middle of winter near his apartment, they would haul him off to jail. so he went inside and turned off all the lights, stating ""i aint going back to jail for fucking nobody""  then one of the other party goers, who had been at our house a few days, started puking from the smell of mmy puke, and screaming that it was all my fault he had big mac sauce and egg in his beard, as i had supplied the food before we went drinking.  then after several moments of tugging and cajoling, they convinced me i could not, in fact, roll to my apartment, and managed instead to drag me inside, where my finace, worried sick, tucked a bunch of stuffed animals around me on the couch, and told me, quite drunkenly, that i had to stop crying and sleep it off.  at this point, i become slightly aware and have a blurry recollection of puking pure wine into a bucket and then soaking a spongebob pillow with more pure alcohol vomit.  when i came too fully i was crying and babbling about Rose and The Doctor and how shitty it was that they shitcanned Invader Zim and ruined Jhonen Vasquez's dreams, and crying about all the relationships in shows that never made it to canon, while my puking freind from earlier screamed from the opposite couch ""someone PLEASE shut that bitch the FUCK UP!!!"" in between emptying his gut into a trash can.  after a while i calmed down, but then i had to pee. My fiance told me not to move, the exact quote being ""just piss on the couch its already soaked in vomit don move""  so I crawled to the bathroom.  On the way back i got tired and lay down in the floor, determined to nap.  J was having none of that. ""If you fall asleep now you will drown in puke and die and our future, our dreams of a house and kids and marriage, is over!""  i made it back to the couch and blacked out again.  I woke up in the morning in my bed, having apparently showered.  My friend was downstairs on the couch, still very drunk and convinced that he had died (i woke him up and said ""we did it we made it"" and he groaned and said ""no we didnt, i died, i know i died"").  I was sober and, surprisingly, felt great.  I am no longer allowed to drink."

I see no obviously feminine characteristics about it. They're both in armored skirts, their cuirasses cover roughly the same amount of skin (though the ""female"" one has more room around the neck), etc. The only significant differences in protective quality are that the ""female"" one has sandals rather than boots, and a different piece of headgear.

Being a man from Denmark, here are some men's issues. Not entirely sure that was what you were asking for, but here we go:   Military draft. Men only.  Maternity leave. Women get mandatory 10 weeks, men get 2. This is bad for both genders.  Reproductive rights. Women have full control over whether they want an abortion. Men should be able file for legal abortion where they yield all rights and obligations to the child (within the abortion period).  Men are generally vilified and treated as worse human beings. Also in the legal system.  Women usually get custody over the child, maybe related to 2.  Men getting abused by their female significant others are often neglected.    There are lots of fights for equality for men as well, but they seem a lot harder because some feminists downplay the entire movement (and if you're not in a movement but just have opinions, then you're probably put in the movement anyway.)

Some statistics from a 2013 HuffPo article here.  Edit: Not sure why this got downvoted. I think my opinion is reasonable and I backed it up with stats.

I'd say this is a good thing, statistically speaking. In fact, I'll go on the record right now and state that I am glad that rape is more common than murder, and more common than specific subfactions of murder, besides, such as ""murdered in combat"". Because crime will always exist. Always. Even in 1984-era technology and Brave New Worlds. To wish that murder was more common would be a horrifying thing, though it would certainly help the surface population problem, especially since you think HuffPo is a valid source, so we're talking more than one in five people murdered if it were not the case."

TumblrInAction,3dt3sf,Degnanigans,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:19:32 2015 UTC,"the same number of male rapists   It is quite common for the rapists to assault more than one person, multiple times. Gang rapes are also a thing.  Also, one could argue that the chance of rape would increase as there are not women in every single company right now... they are a very small minority. Some companies may have men within them who would rape a female in the group (and when so much sexual violence occurs during conflict situations, this is not an outlandish thing to say) but we don't know until it happens and obviously you can't assume every man is a rapist. So it's a tough scenario.  The numbers in and of themselves are not the point, though: it's all very well having more women join if they want to, but I can see why plenty of them wouldn't when there are so many horrible stories."

As long as the embryo is not of a certain age it is not seen as a human being, making it a part of the woman's body, which in turn makes abortion legal (because it affects no human being in the legal sense).  Yielding all rights and obligations on the other hand has a direct effect on the future child (in theory) and not only on the period in which the embryo has no legal rights.  Making it able for the man to decide if the woman should abort is also problematic because it has a physical impact on the woman's body.  I don't know how to solve this dilemma but maybe that's where equality between men and women stops because we are not equals biologically."
TumblrInAction,3dt3sf,sakkara,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:30:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe. On the other hand a woman is in her full right to have the child if the father is unknown or deceased, so I don't consider it completely convincing. It's an interesting point though."
TumblrInAction,3dt3sf,gjoel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:21:37 2015 UTC,"The way I interpreted his statement, and the way I would most want to see it happen is a legal abortion instead of a biological abortion. The father would lose all child support obligation in exchange for any sort of visitation rights or similar.  Now this obviously still has some issues - it puts more pressure on mothers to abort and isn't great for the child, but the current situation isn't particularly fair to fathers (especially fathers who are raped and still on the hook for child support.)"
TumblrInAction,3dt3sf,throwaway43000,11,Mon Jul 20 16:36:22 2015 UTC,"Plus you can't really tell the mother what to do with their body :/   Nobody is telling the woman what to do with her body.  The legal abortion is not aborting the fetus.  It would be the father cutting all legal ties to the child.  His name is not on the birth certificate, he has no claims on any level as a parent (no medical decision, no financial decision, no visitation, etc), but he has no financial obligation to the child either, i.e. no child support."

""Did you abandon this fic?"" message I get every two weeks after a chapter is posted I'd have enough to buy the Kingdom Hearts HD remixes.   Its tiresome trying to do something nice for your fandom and having said fandom criticize, or even turn on you, because its not close enough to canon, even if you try and get it as close as possible, or because its a pairing they don't like or just because they're an asshole who feels like leaving you a nasty message."

Why should anyone respect that kind of 'criticism' , criticism that is being half assed because ""they did it first?"". If a shitty fic doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, why should a shitty critique be any different?  If I were a writer getting that kind of response, I wouldn't get mad about it, but I also sure as hell wouldn't listen to it and take it seriously either.    You sound about as mature as the OP here.

TumblrInAction,3dt5lp,Anolis_Gaming,3,Sun Jul 19 16:07:23 2015 UTC,"Funny story about that:  These campus tribunals regularly deny the defendant the right to present evidence, present witnesses, question witnesses, confront their accuser, or have any sort of legal counsel. They get away with doing it because they are a campus disciplinary hearing, and not actually part of the criminal justice system (and thus not bound by its rules).  They are also now required by law to use the ""preponderance of evidence"" standard, such that if they judge that the allegations are more likely true than not -- even if there is room for doubt -- they hold the defendant responsible for the alleged offense.  In California, they also use the ""affirmative consent"" standard, which means that any sexual contact without clear enthusiastic consent is an assault. So if the defendant can't prove that they got consent, they're fucked.  And since they're usually not allowed to present evidence in their defense, they're fucked even if they CAN prove that they got consent.  Since it's a campus hearing, they can expel the student on the basis of this...and since the transcripts become a matter of record, they can be used against a student if this is followed by a criminal rape trial. Neat little loophole for the criminal justice system to partially circumvent Miranda rights, like the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel, by taking all their statements made during these proceedings -- where they do NOT have the right to remain silent OR the right to legal counsel -- and using them here.  And since these standards are now being encouraged across the country and there's talk of making them the law of the land rather than just on college campuses, we really might as well just repeal the Fifth Amendment right now, because it doesn't seem like it's doing anything anymore."

TumblrInAction,3dt5lp,Geocities_SEO_Expert,57,Mon Jul 20 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"I know somebody this happened to. It was a friend of my sister's. They went to high school together and after they graduated we hadn't heard from him for a long time. Some background information: he was the pastor of my church's son and he was following in his father's foot steps by going to school to be a pastor as well. He was also working as a youth pastor for a church nearby wherever he was then.  So one night my mom gets a text from her friend (who also knew him) saying to go look him up on Google and we found out that he had been arrested for statutory rape. The article said he had some after school homework help program for his youth group and he went home with a girl from it one night who was in the 13-15 range. The article plastered him with ""rapist"" all over it even though everything at that point was just allegations and he said, she said. He lost his job at the church and had to drop out of school over this. Lost his dream of becoming a pastor (this wasn't just something he felt like he had to do. He was super religious).   After all of that? After weeks of him getting called rapist and evil? The girl he ""raped"" came out and said she made the whole thing up. It never happened. What actually happened was she wanted to have sex with him and he rejected her. So she just started telling everyone they did and her parents found out and called the police on him. Not that you'd know that though through the news. The article was next to impossible to actually find. It was so buried and minuscule that we could only find it by being sent the link by my mother's friend who somehow already had it. I mean it was ridiculous how hard it was to finally get. It's obvious they had no intentions of actually letting anyone know that the ""rapist"" (ALLEGED ""rapist"") actually did nothing and it was his sweet little ""victim"" that was the real criminal here.  Even after the girl came forward (they never once named her but his name and picture was everywhere) the state was still pursuing the case (I think it was state. Might've been city. Either way higher ups were still going after him). The ""victim"" came out saying the whole thing was a lie and he was still being attacked for it.  The last thing I saw about this was he pleaded guilty for a crime he didn't commit so he wouldn't be labeled as a sex offender. So now he's going to prison for I believe it said 18 months over something he was proven to not do."

Very motivated, mature, tight-knit.  We liked them a lot and planned on initiating all of them.    Two weeks before initiation, our president gets an email from Panhel, the collective council of Sorority presidents on campus, saying that one of their members had come forward with rape accusations on one of our new guys.    This came as a complete shock to us, but we wanted to take this seriously and get to the bottom of it before jumping to any rash decisions.  They responded that if we moved forward with initiation under any circumstances, they would go public with it, tell all of their girls to never come over to our house, never pair with us for Greek Week or any mixer activities, and basically make it their mission to destroy our reputation.  They said they didn't care what anybody had to say, they stood behind their girl, and if we didn't ""do the right thing"" they'd have us branded as rapists.  This kills the fraternity.  We explained the situation to the guy and he was devastated.  He knew exactly who was bringing the allegations, some girl he'd hooked up with first semester that he'd pissed off by not wanting to date, and she'd been trying to make his life hell ever since.  He begged us to believe him.  We all did, but we couldn't initiate him.  Getting blackballed and labeled as rapists by the entire Greek system spells death for a fraternity.  We asked for an open dialogue with Panhel and they refused.    So we told the guy he wouldn't be getting in.  He was a wreck.  He asked us if this is what we meant by brotherhood, nobility, loyalty, all these things we claimed to embody.  He just needed somebody to have his back, and we couldn't give it to him.  It broke my heart and to this day makes me feel sick.  As I said before, he and his pledge class were tight-knit.  After we told him we were dropping him, they all dropped us.  I respect the hell out of them for sticking with their friend.  After the school began investigating the case, she eventually recanted her statement and admitted that he hadn't raped her.  I don't believe she received any consequences.  Once he was cleared, we told him to rush again in the fall, and he pretty much told us to go fuck ourselves.  Can't blame him."

Some also hate that people are lying about something so serious as rape to hurt someone, and wasting lots of people's time and effort.  Seriously, there have been multiple cases of women accusing someone of rape to get out of cab fare. Also, I never said anything about ""real victims"" or what the ""worst part"" was.

At the core of it, falsely accusing someone of raping you isn't seen as much of a huge deal since you most likely won't get in trouble for this false accusation since they say it might discourage real rape victims to come forward which is ludicrous.  I believe that because there is no real punishment for intently falsely accusing someone of rape, people may not take other rape victims who follow as seriously.  If there was some sort of punishment then I believe it would discourage false accusations.  Also, schools should never handle rape cases.  Leave it to the real police.

What really happened is that she accussed her ex of rape with no evidence whatsoever- so little evidence, in fact, that Columbia's judges (or whatever you call them) found the accussed not guilty on a preponderance of evidence standard (ie they side with her 51%) when the accussed wasn't even allowed to present text messages to him after the rape where she says she misses him, she wants to have sex again, etc. She also says that carrying a mattress around for a year would be easier than filing a police report for her alleged rape, which really shows just how much we should believe her claims.  The best part? She went on to reenact the ""rape"" in a sex tape, but that's a can of worms and a half by itself.

Guilty until proven guilty even if proven innocent. Almost certainly financially and career wise ruined. This amazing athlete had a potential multimillion career stolen from him. Finally a lot of people will end up killing themselves rather than fight this sort of impossible battle over their destroyed life.  So .. false rape accusations sort of equals to attempted murder.

TumblrInAction,3dtgy3,idkartist3D,8,Mon Jul 20 22:53:42 2015 UTC,"It's purely because we, in the first world society, have less that really effects us. Social problems will always exist because as we break past one barrier, we open ourselves to seeing so many more. An easy example is time-saving technologies, the washing machine, dryer, oven, these were all things developed to ease our every day lives. But as we grow into a world with these advancements our only perspective is that lifestyle. On the whole we, in the first world, have never had to suffer through the hardships of our ancestors. Foraging in the forest, killing to eat, cleaning clothes in boiling liquid with toxic chemicals, maintaining a fire throughout the day to keep the homestead from failing, living in fear that drought and disease could very well kill us and everyone we know. These are alien ideas to us. Unfortunately these problems still exist in our world, and SJWs will never lift a finger to aid, not while men/whites/whathaveyou still have distinct mannerisms.    So many of us have nothing to rail against. Old world racism towards non-whites, sexism towards women, and many other bigotries still exist, but they are not institutionalized. We cannot tear down a system or organization that is working towards oppressing these groups, as for the most part they can no longer legally exist. We therefore have to create a monster to fight. The Patriarchy TMÂ© is nothing more than a windmill, some intangible group that allows individuals to have purpose. No better than the Illumineighti, New World Order, or the Nazi's secret antarctic Hitler-cloning labs.  Point I'm making is: Live happily in your lives, and help others when you can. There are a load of problems in the world, tearing others down isn't going to stop any of it.  Then again, I could be an idiot talking out my ass, whose to say?"

TumblrInAction,3dtgy3,sryii,2,Mon Jul 20 00:19:07 2015 UTC,"I was gonna put this in part of my original reply, but couldn't find anywhere to really put it, so here. Ebola has actually only killed around 10,000 people. In total. That's it. Compare to my other statistic, malaria kills at least 3,000 people, every day. And a hundred, maybe two hundred years ago, ebola might have been a serious problem. It probably would've turned into a second black plague of sorts, because the medical knowledge and technology just wasn't there. But luckily modern day medicine and technology led to a very small handful of people (from the US, Africa is another story) getting the disease, and an even smaller handful of them actually dying from it (only 2). So should we prepare ourselves better? Couldn't hurt. But the chances that another outbreak will happen (in the US or other modern countries) is so low that it's not really an issue."
TumblrInAction,3dtgy3,idkartist3D,2,Mon Jul 20 06:10:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that 10,000 total doesn't seem like a lot compared to say Malaria. However, there are two main differences between those two diseases. Malaria requires a vector and cannot be transmitted by casual contact. Ebola can be transmitted person to person and potentially from animal to person.  The current ebola death rate is only 40% which is similar to Malaria. This is thankfully low, on average it is 70%.   Modern protection is terrific, however it will not protect the general populace. Our treatment of Ebola is mostly palliative with the exception of transfusion from a recovered patient.  An outbreak will not start in the US but it can VERY easily travel here from somewhere else. This is my very real concern and why I believe that the international community should be Extremely proactive in tackling Ebola outbreaks because Africa is getting better and better infrastructure and will travel with the disease more and more."

Due to the severity of your breach, you have been given a 5 day temporary ban. Another violation after your ban is lifted will result in a permanent ban.    Rule 3: DON'T BE A SCHMUCK.   3A: Don't make fun of people with genuine problems like cancer, autism, or depression, or some medical issue that you might not believe is real, but feel free to make fun of anyone who's self-diagnosed with something and is clearly bullshitting. You know where the line is.  3B: Also, treat your fellow shitlords excellently. Don't tear them down just because they're a proud feminist (or MRA, or libertarian, or communist or whatever). Respectfully disagree, if you do. Personal attacks are dick moves, so don't make them (and that goes for how you respond to the mods as well). Name calling or starting a flamewar/general dickheadness will not be tolerated. Be civil, we are here to laugh.  3C: Also, Try not to post blogs where the blogger is under 16. It is not always going to be apparent, but when it is, don't post it. The rationale here is that 13 year old otherkin is a lot different than a 30 year old one. One is a kid that is likely just going through a phase and the other one is a grown ass adult that has made a choice to be otherkin. That is just an example though and other areas we deal with have the same sort of rationale. There is no need for a ton of people goofing on a dopey kid when there are a ton of dopey adults out there.

But of course, like everyone on the internet, this guy (who probably is just promotional guy in charge of the account, and not actually Takei) already had xis mind made up about the issue and just had to voice xis totally validatable and non-kneejerky wisdom on the inner workings of the male psyche."

The learned of this from Judas, who hung himself, and when his belly burst open over Potter's Field, the undead taint ruined it.

TumblrInAction,3dt7je,Avedas,3,Sun Jul 19 13:18:58 2015 UTC,Hmm.. not in my experience. I love these because every so often you get one that's really hot and it's awesome. I'm love spicy food and am no stranger to it so maybe I had a different batch?
TumblrInAction,3dt7je,Xixii,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:29:49 2015 UTC,Possibly.
TumblrInAction,3dt7je,madsnorlax,2,Sun Jul 19 16:05:02 2015 UTC,It's basically just a Nacho Cheese flavored bag with a fancy cover.
TumblrInAction,3dt7je,digikun,2,Sun Jul 19 17:16:21 2015 UTC,Not the bag we had. The ones I had didn't taste like any other I've ever tasted and we're hot as hell. They had maybe a little cheese flavor but it was hard to tell because they were just nothing but hot. The other ones in the bag tasted like nacho cheese though.

TumblrInAction,3dt7je,madsnorlax,2,Sun Jul 19 17:20:02 2015 UTC,Really? We eat spicy foods all of the time and thought those Doritos in the roulette bag were hot as fuck. It may have been that the bag we got seemed much more seasoned than any other Doritos I've ever had- it was easy to tell which ones were the hot ones because they had seasoning just falling off of them- but no one in my house ended up finishing the bag. It's still in the pantry with just the hot ones left and all the spice in the bottom of the bag.
TumblrInAction,3dt7je,mommy2libras,2,Sun Jul 19 20:03:02 2015 UTC,i figured the spicy powder would just mix around and spread to all the others anyways.

Her parents sued Monster over it.   What they left out though for a little while there was that she was born with a hole in her heart and has had issues stemming from that in the past.   Sure, cutting kids some slack for hurting themselves is reasonable. But if something would have happened to this girl, there would be lawsuits everywhere."
TumblrInAction,3dt7je,cbvenom,5,Sun Jul 19 14:40:28 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but drinking that amount of caffeine in such a short amount of time is dangerous for most people, let alone someone who had heart problems. The cans even have warnings about not drinking more than three a day, that children absolutely shouldn't drink them, nor should people sensitive to caffeine.   The trouble is, we don't know if the girl knew she should limit her caffeine consumption due to her heart problems. Did her parents sit her down and tell her that she had to be careful? Did she know that, and still downed two energy drinks back to back? Or did she genuinely not realise that the drinks contained a high amount of caffeine, and thought they were more like soft drinks.   Either way, no, her parents shouldn't have sued Monster over it. It was a tragic accident that could have been prevented, but it wasn't Monster's fault."
TumblrInAction,3dt7je,Aruu,4,Sun Jul 19 15:37:54 2015 UTC,"That's my point. I'm sure she knew about it. Here's a link saying it: http://www.today.com/news/teen-girl-dies-caffeine-toxicity-after-downing-2-energy-drinks-506441 But yeah, those warnings are there for a reason. I just hate that her parents wanted to sue.   Now having re-read this, it wasn't a hole in her heart but malfunctioning  valves, which everyone knew about and she shouldn't have drank those drinks. The doctor unfortunately didn't think it was a big deal."

TumblrInAction,3dt25j,lxaex1143,45,Sun Jul 19 05:47:29 2015 UTC,"See, this is why I'm liking Reddit more than tumblr these days, because here, you can ask a question like that, and get an actual answer. On tumblr, a lot of times, you could ask a question like that and people crawl out of the woodwork to accuse you of being an ignorant cishet scum who deserves to be killed for asking an honest question about something you were just trying to educate yourself on. People on tumblr forget that not everybody was just born with an encyclopedic knowledge of the ins and outs of sexuality, gender identity, and transgender issues.  Anyway sounds like you've got enough answers, but I'll add one anyway: If you've got someone who's biologically male, but is transgender and they identify as a woman, and this person is attracted to men, so she is a straight transgender person. If she was attracted to women, she'd be gay. That's how I understand it, at least."
TumblrInAction,3dt25j,OneGoodRib,9,Sun Jul 19 08:31:30 2015 UTC,"What Tumblr would answer:   OMG way to be an ingorant, privileged cis white male. its not my job to educate u use google next time. besides, who cares if they are gay or straight. if they identify as gay, they are gay, no matter whom they are attracted to. do the world a favour and kill urself, shitey. This is why I need feminism.   (Last sentence is optional)   IE, they would simply dance around the question and just accuse the asker of being ignorant. Now, why would they avoid the question? Because they don't know, because they don't actually care about trans people. All they care about, is viewing themselves as ""progressive"" and ""inclusive"", and -- of course -- having something to be outraged about for the next 15 minutes. They just want to pat themselves on the back and say ""I did a good thing today, telling a curious and honest man to kill himself"", and they want that pat to resound in the echo chamber."

Here's why: if a pre-transition MtF is in a relationship with a cis male, it's a gay relationship, both participants must be considered gay or bi... When the MtF later transitions, it doesn't make him or his former partner straight, because that would imply that surgery can change a person's sexuality - and not only the person getting the surgery but also the sexuality of the person they have sex with? Yeah nope."

TumblrInAction,3dt25j,flerps,6,Sun Jul 19 11:58:34 2015 UTC,That not only looks like the most meaningless semantics you could find in this whole debate but its not even right. Some people change their 'officially' gender after the surgery but most do it far sooner. As a matter of fact I think it is encouraged by the pre-op therapists if the person does not do so already.
TumblrInAction,3dt25j,Plusisposminusisneg,-19,Sun Jul 19 15:16:08 2015 UTC,"Irrelevant; even when legally recognised, its biologically impossible for a person to change sex or gender... its just wishful thinking and quackery to believe otherwise.  MtF transsexuals arent real women, and any man who knowingly has sex with one is either gay or bi.  This is not a matter of semantics or opinion, but objective fact."
TumblrInAction,3dt25j,T-Husky,7,Sun Jul 19 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"You're right about one thing: people don't change genders (unless you count genderfluid, but I'm not sure I buy into that). An FtM's gender is male. It was male before transitioning, as well. There has been research done about it, showing that certain parts of the brain that differ between the two genders show the opposite gender (their real one, not their sex) for trans folks. Meaning that what they feel has a biological basis and is not merely whimsical.  You do realize that reassignment surgery works, right? I'm not going to claim it's the exact same as being born in the right body from the start, but we've come far.  So, pray tell, what defines a ""real woman""? And, honestly, you're being silly right now. That and close-minded. I'm not saying you have to be willing to be with a trans woman (because it is a difficult situation for some people), but claiming all kinds of moronic things?  People like you are the reason why one of my FtM friends is so insecure about telling the truth to people. When he told me and saw my reaction (pretty much a shrug and me saying ""okay"" and his 'new' name), you could see the tension leaving him. As if it was possible I was about to start insulting him or being a douche about it.  Bah. TiA is mostly full of wonderful people with quite liberal views on these kind of things.

As far as I'm concerned a MtF is a feminine man, but if he still wants to fuck women he's still straight.  Who are the fucknuts that decided gender should have the same name as the sexes?  I guess no one could have seen this tranny shitstorm coming.   You can't change who you biologically are, not even with all the surgery that exists.

The idea is that trans women are actually just gay/bi men who feel guilty about being gay.  What does he propose for these people, rather than transition?

Educated people avoid such mistakes, in spite of common usage, because they don't want to give the impression that they don't know that they are mistakes.  However, the disadvantage does not stop there.  ""Readibility"" is also harmed.  When you make a mistake like that, even though the reader is sure to understand your real meaning, you distract the reader from your subject.  The reader pauses, notices, thinks about the form of expression rather than the content of the expression.  It is similar to the unnecessary use of abbreviation, such as saying ""thru"" for ""through.""  It distracts the reader.  But that abbreviation is not nearly as bad as misuse of ""begging the question,"" because ""thru"" distracts the reader without suggesting to him or her that the author does not know how to spell ""through.""

Yet if you don't believe in correctness at all, then you don't believe in popular usage as a measure of correctness.

In French (mind you, quite an important country in the history of feminism), title rules come and go. For some time, it was Miss for every woman unless you know for sure she's married. Then it was felt as an insinuation that they are too ugly to be married. So back to Mrs for every adult woman... Nope, now they get pissy because Mrs make them feel old. You also can't pull the apostrophe trick in French, because obviously M. (Monsieur) and Mme (Madame), well... it just doesn't work.  So points for trying but if you're intending to paint patriarchy as a worldwide conspiracy, please educate yourself first. That could take some time..."

Yes, he considers himself totally disabled (like Randy Marsh-  I have alcoholism- we are the same, you and I.)    But as a white cishet male from an upper middle class family who had all opportunities he could want, he wasn't oppressed enough and doesn't have the social currency to belong to 3rd wave feminism.

He's now also bipolar, OCD, PTSD, and also thinks he's schizophrenic (I'm a doctor and have known him his whole life and isn't any of these things) but he didn't have enough gender qualifiers to gain any traction.  So he started being biromantic, then bisexual, then asexual, and today on Facebook he changed his gender and his name to the feminine equivalent name.

After whites, Asians are the next largest ethnic group in the country. Of course, Asia is very diverse and there are a lot of different cultures and traditions, but my experience with my Japanese and Indian friends I went to school with is that their parents would never let them marry outside of their race.  This doesn't apply to everyone, of course, but I get the impression a lot of Asian cultures are more traditional in this respect.   Australia has a small African community so I suppose there's an option. There are large Jewish communities but again, very traditional.   I'll marry someone of any racial background, but honestly... White men are the majority regardless of everything else.   That all being said, I'm not American so SJWs don't realise I exist anyway, so who cares."

TumblrInAction,3dtnfp,prince--of,2,Sun Jul 19 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"Demonstrably wrong.  Exhibit A   After the Arab conquest of Iran, the roles were reversed; the Arabs were now the imperial masters, and the Persians their subjects. In this situation, the term ""red people"" acquired a connotation of inferiority and was used in particular reference to the non-Arab converts to Islam. Redness is similarly ascribed to the conquered natives of Spain, to the Greeks, and to other Mediterranean peoples of somewhat lighter skin than the Arabs.   Exhibit B   Black slaves from Africa were treated similarly in elite culture. The Pingzhou ketan, written by Zhu Yu at the beginning of the twelfth century, noted that rich people in Canton used to keep African 'devil slaves' (guinu): >""Their colour is black as ink, their lips are red and their teeth white, their hair is curly and yellow. There are males and females . . . They live in the mountains (or islands) beyond the seas. They eat raw things. If, in captivity, they are fed on cooked food, after several days they get diarrhoea. This is called 'changing the bowels' [huanchang]. For this reason they sometimes fall ill and die; if they do not die one can keep them, and after having been kept a long time they begin to understand human speech [i.e. Chinese], although they themselves cannot speak it."" Whereas popular Daoism held that a human had to change bones (huangu) to become immortal, the black had to change bowels (huanchang) to become half-human. Physical change enhanced intellectual capacity, although the black would never reach the level of inter-human communication.   Exhibit C   Even before Babur, Muslim historians looked down upon the Hindus as an uncivilized race. Abdu-R Razzak, writing toward the end of the fifteenth century describes one of the tribes among the Hindus in the following manner: >A strange kind of tribe, neither man nor demon At the sight of which one's senses were startled; If I had seen anything like them in my dreams, my heart would have been disturbed for years. I have loved a moon-faced beauty, But I cannot fall in love with every black woman.   Exhibit D   As mentioned above, the Tuareg and the Bidan (Saharan Arab) peoples considered themselves white, as opposed to Songhai, Fulbe, and other Sahelian African peoples, whom they regarded as black. Lecocq points out that ""race"" animates discussion of the perception of the Tuareg held by other African peoples as well as the perceptions of other Africans held by the Tuareg...Slavery was historically linked not only to concepts of race, but to Islamization as well. In popular belief, non-Muslim Africans were considered pagans and thus liable for enslavement if captured in war or purchased. As mentioned above, the bringing of Islam was linked in popular perception to the bringing of civilization. Therefore, the slaves of the Muslim pastoral peoples were forever tainted by slavery and unbelief, even after manumission and/or conversion to Islam.   Exhibit E   The Arabs exhibited a powerful sense of caste and racial superiority, demeaning racially inferior ""sons of white women,"" even though those same white women were the ones most greatly desired for Arab harems. Even the Muwalladun (Sp. ""muladies""), the native Spanish converts to Islam, wre sometimes derided for their white complexions, compared with the Arab elite. Muslim society featured widespread slavery, which like the slavery of the Ancient World was multiracial, slaves being drawn from every race and ethnic group not Muslim, but black slaves from Africa normally occupied the lowest position. Andalusi society remained highly segmented, not merely among the religions, but in terms of the different categories of Muslims--the Arab elite divided by lineages, tribes, and districts from the Berbers (and their own internal segments) and the convert majority of native Hispani.   Exhibit F   The mamluk founders of the Delhi sultanate introduced racialism in muslim politics to serve their personal ends: they exercised racial discrimination at higher level with a vengeance--each of the three prominent rulers, Aibek, Iltutmish and Balban, created new classes of the nobility, composed exclusively of their own turkish slave officers.   Exhibit G   The original inhabitants are called tsuchigumo, translated as ""dirt spiders,"" and are killed by the Yamato indiscriminately wherever they are encountered. No attempt is made to bring them into alliance. This is straight genocide as we would call it. There is no sugar coating this. In every instance of early contact between Yamato and the natives who are called ""dirt spiders"", the latter are killed.   I could continue..."

You are defining this large group of people all fighting for a good cause, by the small minority who take that cause too far, and warp it into their own personal and radical view.   All groups of people have that small minority that are extremely radical and whose views are so off based theyre almost going against the original mesaage, yet are extremely vocal. You wouldn't judge your random and nice Christian neighbor as someone whose views are equal to the westboro Baptist Church.

TumblrInAction,3dsubs,MajinAsh,-4,Sun Jul 19 13:55:54 2015 UTC,You idiot. Breasts are not like facial hair or an adams apple. Breasts are a sex organ. They have thousands of nerves whose entire function is to provide pleasure when touched especially during sex.
TumblrInAction,3dsubs,Diablo3RuinedMe,13,Sun Jul 19 03:26:33 2015 UTC,"Breasts are a sex organ. They have thousands of nerves whose entire function is to provide pleasure when touched especially during sex.    Uh, are you sure that's their entire function?"
TumblrInAction,3dsubs,CoquetteClochette,-4,Sun Jul 19 04:19:29 2015 UTC,Yes. The entire function of those nerve endings is to stimulate the brain in the same way sex does.
TumblrInAction,3dsubs,Diablo3RuinedMe,20,Sun Jul 19 04:23:35 2015 UTC,But that's not the only or most important function of the breast or nipple. The primary function is feeding babies. Nipple stimulation plays a role in breastfeeding.
TumblrInAction,3dsubs,CoquetteClochette,5,Sun Jul 19 04:40:14 2015 UTC,"seems like the sexual part of it would be secondary to the feeding part of it, as their sources show that the release of milk is partially stimulated by the hormone that also causes arousal. At this point, the signals and responses from those nerves run together, but I'd wager they've got it backwards: sex stimulates the nerves in the same manner as feeding."
TumblrInAction,3dsubs,adenosine12,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yep. But the nerves still serve only one function: to stimulate the brain in the same manner as sex. Yes, even when the stimulation is being used to help a baby latch on: the animal brain cannot tell the difference and it stimulates the brain in the exact same way.   source 1  Source 2  source 3"
TumblrInAction,3dsubs,Diablo3RuinedMe,9,Sun Jul 19 05:02:43 2015 UTC,But I wouldn't consider it purely sexual if the main function is allowing a baby to latch on. The sexual function of breasts is a consequence of that. Breastfeeding isn't sexual even if it stimulates the brain in a similar way.
TumblrInAction,3dsubs,CoquetteClochette,-2,Sun Jul 19 05:40:36 2015 UTC,"They said the function of the nerves in particular. They don't help a baby latch on, they just happen to be there then, too."

TumblrInAction,3dsubs,adenosine12,-2,Sun Jul 19 03:43:57 2015 UTC,No. It's the entire breast. Pressing or squeezing the breast during sex provides pleasurable stimulation.

There are many erogenous zones, and breasts happen to be one of them. I don't see how you can consider them sex organs, as 1. humans, in a primal aspect, have sex to make babies like any other organism. You only need a penis and a vagina for that. And 2. The breasts are just sacks of fat, nerves, and milk glands. The very definition of ""mammal"" is any animals that have milk-producing mammaries for their young. When two animals have sex, they do not bother with touching the mammaries. They don't even go near them. So how are they sex organs? You do not need breasts to make offspring, rather, they're there to feed them.  Sex organs are, and I quote the dictionary, ""any organ involved in sexual reproduction."" You do not use breasts in reproduction."

TumblrInAction,3dsubs,reaganveg,5,Sun Jul 19 07:18:58 2015 UTC,"Gonna have to disagree with you on that one. As human faces evolved flatter, human breasts evolved to become larger and face outward more so so the child can feed and hold onto the breast without suffocating."
TumblrInAction,3dsubs,tinysuperchef,0,Sun Jul 19 13:31:33 2015 UTC,"That doesn't stand to reason.  Humans don't have flatter faces than all other mammals, and among humans, the populations with the largest breasts don't have the flattest faces.  Since there's a wide variation in human breast size, it would be easily observed if there were a survival advantage to large breasts in breast-feeding; women with smaller breasts would have higher infant mortality, or at least greater need of mechanisms to prevent it."

Basically, that first sentence means that without capitalism, there would be no racism, yet you talk about imperialism, which is based not on capitalism, but mercantilism. In fact, when capitalism was first introduced, Adam Smith was vehemently AGAINST colonization as it usually resulted in a net loss of money for the mother country. As for saying that trans liberation is class liberation, I'm just going to leave it as ""I think you got all your information on what communism is by reading a summary of Das Kapital."" Caitlyn Jenner would really disagree with equating trans people to the working poor.   Trans women die of wage slavery, imperialist wars and institutional abuse and weâre supposed to be thankful for this? Fuck you. In 32 states you need your bosses permission to be trans. This is liberty? This is justice? Itâs all fucking garbage. Your bourgeois âdemocracyâ is authoritarian, reactionary trash.   I find it really really fucking hilarious that communists hate wage slavery. Wage slavery is getting so little money for your job that you can afford basic necessities at the most and nothing more. Communism just cuts out the middleman of money. Saying ""trans women die in imperialist wars"" is also completely fucking dumb because, guess fucking what, the large majority of people that died in imperialist wars are cis men. As for ""institutional abuse,"" I'm going to take that to mean you think that whenever Trailer Park Jim Bob calls Caitlyn Jenner Bruce, the sword of the patriarchy materializes in his hands as he goes on his quest to oppress you all instead of Jim Bob being a halfwit. And yes, you should be thankful for all this. Wanna know why? You're able to live as a trans person here instead of being stoned. Believe it or not, being born in the West really is a sort of privilege, as much as you hate people with privilege. As for your last sentence, calling democracy authoritarian when you are clearly advocating for a system where the very basic definition of it is ""a system where all the means of production are controlled by the state,"" I'm just going to have to reiterate that I'm sure all your knowledge of communism comes from reading a summary of Das Kapital."

TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,tubcat,10,Sat Jul 18 23:42:50 2015 UTC,I've got no problem with folks wanting to have a legitimate open or polygamous relationship. I just always hear of them going sour and one person getting doubtful while the other person gets snappy and defensive about the possibility of losing the open aspect. Most of those sour times it just seems like one person steamrolls the relationship open and is defensive about it despite hurting the person they are in the primary relationship with. Be open if you want. Be cucked if you want and it floats your boat. I just hate seeing folks hurt by people they love.
TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,oldirtybaron,5,Sat Jul 18 23:27:59 2015 UTC,"A truly ""open"" relationship needs a lot of things that most monogamous relationships have, but take for granted. Like the rule of having a threesome (tangentially related I know): if you're having a threesome with your girl and another girl, you ignore the add on. If she wants to lick your balls you let her have at it, but you don't kiss her, you don't make eye contact, and you don't penetrate her before your girlfriend. Preferably you don't penetrate her at all. You need to make it clear to your girlfriend that the add on is just an add on; the important part of the experience is that you're both doing this weird and kinky thing together. Satisfy your partner first, give them all of the love and affection and show the add on none. I'm not saying be cruel or kick the third person in the face or anything, but making sure your spouse is taken care of should be your absolute priority in that kind of scenario.  And an open relationship is really the exact same thing. You need to make sure that your partner understands that you care about them, and that the things you do with them (not necessarily sexual) are important to you. There's a greater need for the little things, for genuine intimacy, because of things like doubt and insecurity. You need to go the extra mile to make sure that your spouse knows that she (or he!) is absolutely the #1 priority. Getting strange on the side is a physical thing. Sometimes you feel like Cherry Garcia, not Maple Walnut. As long as the two of you are truly, completely, committed to each other for love and affection then things should be okay. Also never tell each other about other lovers except to mention how little they measure up to your spouse. That kind of shit does wonders for the self esteem (and it helps if it's actually true) If you do, make sure it's a funny anecdote. Then again, just because it's funny to you doesn't mean it'll be funny to her. Best for both parties to just keep that shit to themselves.  Now the dark side of an open relationship is that more often than not one party is attractive and the other isn't. Or if that isn't the case, one person is introverted and the other is extroverted. This leads to one side getting a whole bunch of strange, taking home the whole damn sample platter, and the other quietly winds up resenting their partner for it. They may also resent themselves because they can't seem to attract anyone, which can also lead to depression and insecurity, a low sense of worth. The reason these things go bad is that, in a lot of cases, one side is too busy having so much fun to understand that they need to pay extra special attention to their spouse. I'm not just talking sexually, of course. I mean holding hands. Cuddling. Asking about their day. Being supportive. All in all it's the same as any other relationship, but the little things matter that much more.   Sadly not everyone understands how to make an open relationship work. A lot of the time it really is just a stealthy way for one party to cheat without the stigma, leaving their partner feeling all manner of inadequate. That's shitty, and it's a dangerous tight rope to walk. The only reason I know any of this is because two of my good friends are in an open relationship, and they walked me through how they handle it without turning on each other, or losing their love for each other. It can work, but it requires specific people. A specific personality. And a specific understanding of love and what they want out of a relationship.  And then some people just get off on watching their spouse satisfy another person. More power to 'em."

TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,poliwrath3,70,Sat Jul 18 13:37:47 2015 UTC,"Feminism as an ideology and the people support it have routinely supported legislation, policies, and ideas which are harmful to men.   The MRM is critical of that, and seeks to solve men's issues outside of the framework of feminism.  Feminists don't like being challenged on their narrative of perpetual female victimhood and male privilege because once their narrative is broken down they cease to be relevant, and as a precaution they have successfully slandered MRAs as everything from misogynists to pedophiles, which the mainstream media, with their outstanding record of integrity, was happy to perpetuate, and once it hit critical mass, it became self-sustaining.  Tldr: the MRM wants to solve men's issues, some of which are caused by feminists. Feminists don't even want the idea of men's issues to be acknowledged."
TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,Ghee_Buttersnaps_,34,Sat Jul 18 16:11:57 2015 UTC,"It's painfully ironic that feminists are so widely accepted and MRAs are so widely hated. While woman face many challenges in society, men are actually discriminated against by law (I'm talking first world countries here), and though women aren't really systemically discriminated against anymore, we still make a point to be for the equality of the sexes.   The fact that the mere thought of men caring about their rights is openly mocked and insulted is proof that we need a rights movement.   Sadly it seems that modern society is only interested in shitting all over men and pretending that women are always right and always victims."
TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,True_Patrician,17,Sat Jul 18 17:31:18 2015 UTC,"(I'm talking first world countries here)   But that's where i see <100% of the focus being though.   Women in countries where they actually suffer heinous rights violations are more or less used a token shield for all the ethnocentric criticism.  I read an article about a woman in Pakistan getting stoned to death for having a cell phone, the same summer as the Blurred Lines shitstorm.   Boko Haram kidnapped those girls around the same time as Ban Bossy, #bringbackourgirls had a two week shelf life from day 1.  Prior to the kidnapping, Boko Haram butchered all the male students at a school, and, to quote an article headline ""Killed all the students at a school"" that was all-male. What's another word for students at an all male school? Boys. Yet we don't hear about Boko Haram until they kidnapped those girls. They attacked a third school afterwards!  I know race plays into it as well, but African Boy is strikes 1, 2, and 3."
TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,OllyforLordCommander,11,Sat Jul 18 17:48:08 2015 UTC,"If not for the outbreak of radical feminism, I think we would be close to equality in first world countries today. But now all our focus is on ""difficulties"" women face in society, which completely overshadows awareness of actual systemic discrimination of men, and no one even considers the conditions of non-first world society (except for feminists who use those societies as ""proof"" that all women are oppressed). Feminism is a shitstorm about problems that do not exist in first world countries (at least not from a legal standpoint, there is obviously still simple sexism), and it has caused more problems for men than it has solved for women (i.e., it has caused us to actually regress in terms of equality). This feminazi shitstorm has taken all the focus off of truly barbaric countries and put it on the poor oppressed first world women. If not for radical feminism, first world countries could work together, men and women, all races, to help reform actually fucked up parts of our world. It's truly a shame.   About the Boko Haram stuff, I remember seeing stories about that on Facebook (only about the girls being kidnapped of course), and the stories basically went on about how horrible the kidnappings are, then halfway down the page they say ""oh yeah also they've massacred a few entire schools of boys, but back to the important stuff"". I wish we could all just work together for the greater good instead of fighting over who gets to be the most oppressed."
TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,True_Patrician,2,Sat Jul 18 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"Don't blanket all of feminism as being one big united goal, there's as much in fighting in Feminism as there is between radfems and MRAs.  All feminism is, is a vague ideology broken up into sub ideologies.  What you see on the internet is still fringe in the real world (outside of San Francisco)."
TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,OllyforLordCommander,9,Sat Jul 18 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that not radical majority is working tirelessly towards discrediting the Duluth model, ensuring equal sentencing between men and women for similar crimes, and making sure fathers and mothers have equal custody of children after a divorce if they're both fit parents.   OR MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT EQUALITY AND NOT ANY BETTER THAN THOSE ""RADFEMS"" THAT ARE ""TARNISHING"" THE NAME OF FEMINISM.   Cut it with the ""not all feminists"" bullshit, nobody buys it and I'll believe it when I see these ""good feminists."" Feminist theory at its core enables and approves of misandrist concepts.  Instead of seeing all those imaginary good feminists taking mass action to reclaim their movement and do some good,  I see reasonable people like Christina Hoff Sommers branded as anti-feminists by other feminists. The good feminists are in the minority and are only feminists to the extent that they want to do something to help the label, and they're failing miserably and completely outnumbered.   At some point you have to see why appealing to a silent and inactive majority doesn't mean shit.  And what you think is only the norm in San Francisco went mainstream in western Europe and college campuses over a decade ago. Maybe it's a fringe ideology in the grand scheme of things, but hardly fringe for feminism."
TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,True_Patrician,0,Sat Jul 18 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"Well of course it's not  ""working tirelessly"" as yes feminism is about equality for women foremost. But if you think that feminists don't care or acknowledge those issues at at all you're entirely wrong you've surrounded yourself with the wrong feminists. If anything, among my active feminist friends I see them discussing awareness for domestic abuse and rape among men more so than women currently with the whole Shia thing.   At the same time the MRM totally has a right to exist as it's entirely true as it creates a space to have a focus and discussion about those issues as it is true when you tried to discuss those issues in a feminist enviroment you got pushed out and got the whole ""wat about da menz?"" meme. Which is entirely understandable, it's basically like if you were talking about Fallout: NV and you're talking about a glitch and someone comes up to you and says ""Hey, don't forget that happens in Fallout 3 too"", and every time you try talking about a feature or issue in Fallout NV you have a guy come up and tells you don't forget that it happens in Fallout 3 too. Sure you still like Fallout 3 but you're talking about Fallout NV and yes, you're very aware Fallout 3 also has that problem as every time you try talking about that problem in Fallout NV you get reminded that it's also a problem in Fallout 3. Of course there's going to be some crazy people who hate Fallout 3 and aren't even that huge of Fallout NV fans but claim to be huge NV fans and say someone wanting to break off and discuss the Fallout 3 issues after being shut out from talking about the issues is directly attacking Fallout NV.  Also like I mentioned the ""good feminists"" are generally mainstream and not aware of the internet fringe and when they do encounter them they think they're false flag or satire or just generally crazy. So yeah of course they're not taking mass action to reclaim the movement if they don't think there's anything to reclaim. As for Sommers, anyone who actually think she's anti-feminist is clearly just crying because she doesn't subscribe to the same feminist ideals as them. Also it's been about 2 decades now actually, but I wouldn't call academics the mainstream at all.  But anyways, shit's all basically a horseshoe with the tip being radfems and redpillers"
TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,Beltox2pointO,3,Sat Jul 18 21:55:03 2015 UTC,"That analogy would make more sense if the Fallout:NV discussion group claimed to be the solution to fallout 3 issues too, but then told the fallout 3 advocates to gtfo and wait their turn because they're privileged. Not only that, but some of the fallout:NV people are actively working to remove fallout 3 mods and make the game more  buggy, while others just sit on the sidelines and keep repeating that they aren't all like that, as if that does anything to help.  Surely those moderate feminists are working to reverse some of that harmful legislation that other ""radical"" feminists put in place... right?   Normal feminists totally didn't make the Duluth model happen, it was those other bad radical feminists /s.  This whole appeal to the silent majority doesn't matter one bit, those silent moderates aren't actively discrediting the people using their movement as a canard for hate, and despite what you think, the core beliefs of feminist theory enable that sort of hate.   The whole concept of privilege and patriarchy is just a not-so-underhanded way of vilifying men.  And last time I checked, even the most extreme redpillers don't advocate for killing or enslaving all women, to even think that TRP is involved in the MRM shows you don't really know what you're talking about.   TRP is an extreme branch of the seduction community, not men's rights."
TumblrInAction,3dqcy3,letsgoiowa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:09:56 2015 UTC,"Like I said before, I think you're honestly just really oversaturated with internet feminism. I do know moderate feminists who actually are trying to bring awareness and change those issues. At my University they actually made it so campus counseling and support for abusive relationships and domestic abuse was also inclusive of men and also had their posters/pamphlet target men also.   As for privilege, it does exist, but if they're trying to make you feel guilty over being privileged or say your opinion is invalid because of privilege they don't understand it at all themselves. Privilege isn't something that's negative or positive, it just is.  I don't entirely doubt there's redpillers out there that all women should become their sex slave. And you can't deny that there's redpillers within the MRM movement. I do actually follow it too and I've seen them, of course they obviously weren't upvoted at all but they exist and try to represent it."

While it is disjointed and there is a big disparity in beliefs in the overall broad group, the ones that wield the most influence are the radical, harmful ones. Plus, there's a bit of confirmation bias on our side. You're not likely to notice a ""good"" feminist because they generally keep their beliefs non-controversial and quiet, but you sure as hell can spot a radfem quickly.
