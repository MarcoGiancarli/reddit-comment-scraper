occult,3e410f,towelin,3,Wed Jul 22 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"He was looking for a few books on occult philosophy online one day from his small town in southern Massachusetts. He had never crossed the border of the state, and spent most of his days talking the nature of the soul, with his girlfriend, Jedadiah. She wasn't stunning, but she loved him and the occasional buttstuff. Well he found a seller selling tons of books he wanted for very reasonable prices at a small book store in Rhode Island. This made him nervous, but the incredible deals tipped the scale.  He was off, despite the warnings of Jedadiah. He drove thirty-six miles to the book store and just before he got there, he realized he needed to poop. So he went inside a Burger King, like the typical Rhode-Islander. He caught a sharp gaze from the manager, who wished only one of the many poppers would just buy some food.  After he left the store, He got back in his car which wouldn't start and he turned around and there was an old prostitute named Roxy with a knife to his balls. She said she would like to have sex, and unzipped him.   He thought about Jedadiah while they were trading breaths in the drivers seat, she straddled him but kept the knife to his throat and as he was cumming she dug the knife into his arm, and took his wallet but gave him syphilis.  Rumor has it he still hasn't gone back to Rhone Island to this day."

He's just isolated himself off from the world in a truly sad way.  You can even see it in recent pictures of him.  He looks like an anorexic Sith lord.

If comic book characters have had as much an much effect on culture as claimed, think about other fantasy or fictional movements that have affected us and history.  The space age (war of the worlds broadcast anyone?) Faust, Leibniz optimism, christian rosenkreuz, even young Romans wearing mustaches to look like the germanics.  Myth and legend will always affect culture deeply, that's what we're talking of here, no one blames the Vikings for making up gods the explain the real world, I see little difference.  At least now we understand its fantasy."

Superman, Batman are our representation of what it means to be more than human, just like those figures and their myths, whether they themselves resulted from them or not.  How long did children play as Perseus for instance? Much much longer than Iron man has been around.  The appropriate response to culture always comes, Mr Moore should know he has been its agent.  He ushered in us thinking critically about the myths he now describes instead of pure glorification.  Historical figures rarely even get that treatment.

So for example, 9 and 25.   9 and 25 are ALSO composite numbers. In a set together they are incomposite-composite numbers.  They are composite, because they are divisible by a number other than themselves and unity (1) but to each other they are incomposite because they do not share each other's divisors (3 and 5 respectively)   That's how I understand it.   Secret Teachings of All Ages explains this."
occult,3e3jgt,nikto123,4,Tue Jul 21 18:03:39 2015 UTC,"""Magic"" IMO has to do a lot with i(magi)nation and the channeling of ideas or emotions into a physical (read: creative medium) context. A child's laughter would be considered magic, or the feeling evoked by a certain song or passage of a book. It is real because it has REAL MEANING (whether to an individual or a group of individuals). ""Magick"" as I define it is of anything having to with human thought or emotion, and the explication of that ""sense"" or thoughts through means of kinesis into reality, or casting one's self (one's will/intent). Magick can come in many formats, ""bending"" being one, or the use of language and ""magic words"" to spark some kind of ripple effect or termed change in ""reality"" as seen by the individual.  I like to use the different spelling because MAGIC IS REAL in every sense, because it is an almost metaphorical term, as having to do with ""digging deeper"" into your sense of humanity/emotion.   Magick can never be practical until it is PRACTICED. The use of practical magick takes discipline and copious amounts of work.   Personally, I think people really decide to focus more on magic because it integrates art and has a degree of flexibility. While Magic and Magick both rely on creativity, magic is easier to come by, while practicing magick has the potential to NEVER ACTUALLY yield ""real world"" results (though imo the physical and mental ""results"" are substantial enough; byproducts of physical and mental discipline)  Sorry if that was too much of a ramble or didn't make sense, I got really excited because I've been thinking about this a lot and your post made me THINK MORE THINGS HOORAY"
occult,3e3jgt,ninaintheair,4,Tue Jul 21 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's a 'remaking' of reality imo... or, should I say, a partaking of a remaking of reality on your own terms...   Our 'leaders' and society remake reality all the time. The position of the citizen is merely to accept the 'reality' they create without being enfranchised to change it (except the sop of the ballot box).   Accepting magic and defining yourself in relation to it is a rejection of all that."
occult,3e3jgt,segovius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:25 2015 UTC,To me magick isn't a way of interpreting a potential act. It's not a point of view. Magick is an act.

While the term ""unconscious"" is now in popular use in English, I'd strongly recommend going back and reading Freud's understanding of it because you (OP) may not have a full understanding of his ideas just because you've learned the word from others using it. Freud's ""id"" and Jung's ""shadow"" are also similar in some regards, and having an understanding of each leads to a better comprehension of both."

occult,3e16kf,le0pardprint,6,Tue Jul 21 05:00:18 2015 UTC,"I think the most important difference is that Freud's work has to do with pathological cases while Jung was more interested in deciphering the workings of the ""normal"" mind. If you're short on time, Jung will prove to be more rewarding. But both of them should be taken with a grain of salt because, for all their revolutionary ideas, they were still men of their time (for example Jung believed that ""primitive"" people, like Africans, were still in a phase of psychological infancy and that contact with them could contaminate ""civilized"" individuals)."

Plus, it's crucial to understand the language of the text whether it's English or German. For example the term 'ego' can be used as 'me' or might mean a part of the self, making up 'me'. Words mean much, as they are the backbone of 'talk therapy' - psychoanalysis.  William Reich is worth checking out too, he has a very clear conception of cultural and sexual dynamics and how they interplay.

Like a lot of people are saying here, he didn't contribute much to the occult. Jung was a student of his, and he certainly did.

Freud refused an analysis of his own dream, like a parent or authority figure above question and reproach. This occurrence and a few others (Freud not budging from dream content essentially being about sexual repression, all personal no collective material, etc) made it clear to Jung that his own views were diverging from Freud's.

I have trouble cognizing words when I do that though. This morning I realized that It was light information I was trying to access and the words were just a lower dimensional representation of that. I started moving my left hand in front of the astral screen, and rewriting the code. I folded down to having 3 fingers, the pinky and ring finger folded up. I had no right hand. Then I let go of the physical representation in my mind as well as the body. I saw a white light. Then I heard a ringing in my left ear, heard ""I'm sorry"". I started to dimensionally transition to arcturian consciousness. I freaked out and regained position in my human body. Arms were completely numb from sleep paralysis. strange stuff lol.

Have you ever met the 'ether'?  Its a super intelligence, what I believe is its all the data behind everything.  Its very sharp looking but can change itself into any form instantly.  When you look at it, there is nothing but it, there is no you, you are simply watching it.    I always wonder how it knows I'm watching it, almost like its a part of everyones mind.  Last time we met I smiled and it copied my face and smiled back at me.  I had a snot bubble dripping out of my noes from tears and as the teary snot twisted slightly I was shown all of existence was inside my snot.   At first I thought the 'ether' was many things but soon realized its one huge intelligence,  an interface between infinity and reality and because we can see it, it can be alive."
occult,3dzz6h,antimattermage,2,Tue Jul 21 03:47:41 2015 UTC,"While tripping lsd/lsa/mushrooms I have found a sort of reddish membrane in my mind. Its like a biological field of energy that forms my subjective experience. I asked and the guides said it was ""THE"" barrier between conscious and subconscious information. Then I started having dreams of Pleiadians and there were these girls that were bending physical objects in their reality and showing/teaching me about it. Most of my teleportation experiences aren't experienced directly, more like I'm observing the scenario play out. I'm learning how to project my body more easily so I can interact more.  I had a dream where I looked at my hands and saw that same reddish hexagram structure covering my skin. Then I started walking through walls and telepathically accessing etheric sounds to alter my physical frequency in the dream. Then some angel guy appears and tries to take me to some sort of healing center. Its funny, because we were flying through the sky and cars driving on the road would pull over and shine their headlights up at us. We got to the destination and their angelic choirs singing. I realized I was cross dressing. He said ""You haven't done that in 100 years"".. He said I was gonna get claws, so I would have to learn to control my energy better (best logic right?). I had quartz crystals in my pocket, but they had an energy that was like a magnet. For some reason crystals in dreams get magnetic when they get charged with energy."
occult,3dzz6h,antimattermage,2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:39 2015 UTC,"Love the stories bro! Thank you for sharing your experiences sound amazing.  I know exactly what you are talking about when you say reddish membrane.  Its squares right?  Like a cosmic web?  The membrane I've seen are always little squares that seem to have different properties.  Some are right on the object while others are on top of the object, and there is another layer on top of that layer, etc etc.    I tried once to bend one of the membranes with my mind and I swear I moved a snot tear hanging from my nose in a direction that shouldn't be possible.  It was curving upward in a J.   For some reason a lot of things are shown to me when I'm crying lol.    I have consciously teleport only when I'm astral projecting.  It feels like a vacuum to me and before you know it you are where you wanted to be without moving from point A to point B.  Another strange thing in the astral planes is it seems that I always know exactly where I'm at in space and time despite not having a floor usually and going deep down into the abyss.   Since it sounds like you've been around, have you ever had claw marks placed on your body?  I just noticed literally today that I have 5 of them, almost looks like a small bear cub could have done such a mark on my back.  I've tested the location and my own hand cannot reach it but lastnight for some reason I slept on my stomach which I never do.     I've also been having strange things being drawn on my mirror.   I'm going to shut down this play house pretty soon but I'm honestly astonished things of another dimension can physically draw things and/or touch my body.  I'm not too happy about the claw marks but the finger paint drawing wasn't so bad."

I made it while tripping on lsd trying to build telepathic network, but I never achieved sentience/gnosis. It was the chemical structures. Neurotransmitters. The Ets were trying to get them to sync up my consciousness so I could perceive the way they do. I had dna rolling out my crown chakra coming in from distant galaxies lol. It was one hell of a trip.

When I first started going deep into my mind there was never anything there to harm me, but now that I've gotten a lot of answers I'm being shown the good and the bad.    When you said you are a wisp, have you built your astral body to hold your consciousness or is this something you naturally formed too without thought to protect yourself?  I use to have a wisp like form when I would go into alien dimensions they only saw me as mist and never a threat, they would allow me to watch with no issues.     But now my astral body gets beat on, in fact lastnight a red cubic entity smashed me twice with what it felt like a 2x4 piece of astral right to my stomach.  I called upon THOTH and he sent down a crystal half dome around me which protected me but recently I've been getting beat on.  I feel I've been tricked into making some contracts which is exposing myself.  This is something I need to fix sooner than later."

occult,3dzz6h,antimattermage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:48:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I was shown we have died several times but it wasn't our time to go, so they allowed us to finish out this life.  When I asked what I was suppose to do here they said, ""finish out your life.""   I recall dying on my first shroom trip or maybe it was when I wrecked in the car.    The strange thing is the spirits [as you probably know] all seem to already know who you are, almost as if they have been with you for aeons, do you feel the same way when meeting these spirits?"

occult,3e033i,ryallen94,2,Mon Jul 20 22:40:19 2015 UTC,I also would like to know what's up with this as I regularly see a human looking eye that looks around with my eyes closed.
occult,3e033i,the_bewildered_beast,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:03 2015 UTC,"To me it just sounds like a visual brought on by the marijuana, I smoke daily as well and it helps in my practice but I tend to get these sorts of visions all the time, especially when visiting my best friend psilocybin.   You consciously set out to ""open your third eye"" so one could easily interpret this vision as kind of a guide that it's working! The fact that the eye you see leaves the vision by setting just like the sun does tells me that you're on the right path for what you set out to do, but need to continue working on it.  Visions that you see that seem like it could mean something should be written down in a notebook and meditated on. For the most part they're usually 100% related to you and can only be interpreted by you, but nonetheless there's my quick interpretation of the vision you had, I hope it helps or gives you some sort of piece of mind!  Side story: when I was a small child I would close my eyes and see an eye kind of like what you described and it would always disappear into the corners of my vision (eyes still closed). I was a pretty lonely kid before all of my siblings arrived so this eye I would see was actually my imaginary friend for quite some time and I even named him Levi."

occult,3e033i,captainalphabet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:45:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/nfs9. You were both trying to open your third eye, and it sounds like you did. It's awesome to have a shared vision because it lends some validity to something that is easy to brush aside. I don't think what you saw is so important as the fact that you both saw it. You corroborated one another's ability and now you know that you're capable of seeing with more than your eyes."
occult,3dzq7s,3see,2,Mon Jul 20 21:05:29 2015 UTC,"What's your take on this? (x-post from /r/HolySummoners) This is the first time I've come across this, does anyone have any further information about this?"
occult,3dzq7s,boredasbaws,3,Mon Jul 20 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"It's a Tantric Theravada spell from Thailand. What else is there to say? If you want more info on Southeast Asian occultism, you'd need to be able to type in the original language. There's a ton of material online, just very little of it has been translated into English. P.S. I reiterate that this sub is a western dominated space. Best to find clarification for non-Western forms of magic elsewhere."

Not enough of an expert personally to say which entity appears as a dragon.  Kraig's ""Modern Magick"" is a good book to get a for-dummies overview of it."
occult,3e0fcf,zakktravis,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:43 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! At least I have a starting point now.
occult,3e0fcf,zakktravis,3,Tue Jul 21 00:37:50 2015 UTC,Cheers -- I've been doing a little Internetting and it looks like Astaroth appears riding a dragon.  Definitely do your research and proceed with caution my friend!
occult,3e0fcf,33673,2,Tue Jul 21 00:47:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for digging deeper. I wonder if there is any tie to the fact that years later I happened to acquire ""The Dictionary of Demonology"" I've never considered it my thing, but I may have to do some research and see if there are any dots to connect."

I smoke and offer marijuana for almost all of my practices, it can be a very powerful tool if used right, and it seems like you're using it right.  (By using it ""right"" I mean you're not running around your local junior high school yelling ""smoke weed every single day no matter what till' you die!! Bob Marley 420 blaze it~"", not that those folks are ""wrong"" in any way)."

occult,3e0pjc,pickledpie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:33:50 2015 UTC,"Depends on your practice. When shakti reaches certain points, it definitely gives strange experiences. A blaze of light, different colours. One shouldn't get too caught up in them, but they can usually be taken as a good sign of progress.  My personal experience has never been one of beings, except one time where I saw basically the same thing as you. I had a Buddha coming out of the crown of my head, just radiating pure love and bliss. That was a powerful experience on shrooms. Mostly it's just a purple light and there have been times where I could see my room with my eyes closed and feel a green orb around my head. The room isn't seen clearly, but in a green-purple light. The green energy feels like magnetic energy, and heart based. The purple is in my forehead and is veru cool and calming."
