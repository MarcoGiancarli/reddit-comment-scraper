Fighters,3e4ive,sinetwo,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:59 2015 UTC,"I would wait a bit with a stick purchase since I am sure that there will be more sticks coming out closer to SF5's release and the venom stick got a huge price increase recently. (Went from 80 to 100 euros) Replacing everything with sanwa would most likely bring you to an overall cost, where you could have just gotten a high quality stick right out of the gate."
Fighters,3e4ive,KB-Warrior,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:57 2015 UTC,I'm putting sanwa buttons in but keeping the joystick. Still slightly cheaper in the end
Fighters,3e4ive,Sabrewylf,2,Wed Jul 22 02:13:30 2015 UTC,"Sanwa buttons are what, 3-4 euro? That means 24-32 plus 70 for the stick. Let's call that €100. And thats with no stick replacement. By comparison, a HRAP4 PS3/PS4 is €130.  So I would agree, better off just to buy the ""real"" stick from the start."
Fighters,3e4ebu,heart-station,2,Tue Jul 21 21:36:30 2015 UTC,Two pieces of fanart you (probably) didn't make on the front page at the same time? Do you really need a karma fix that badly?
Fighters,3e4ebu,notdaveosaur,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:41:22 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you don't know this, but karma literally means nothing. There's no prize for having lots of it."

Fighters,3e0anb,ewic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:19 2015 UTC,"Well, for North America the New England lobby is usually full (64/64) in the evenings and I usually see about 30+ online during the day (everyone in NA seems to play in that lobby cus its the first on the list). I haven't delved into online yet though because I'm new to the FGC and still need to learn a character. It seems decently active, though, for a niche game. You shouldn't have any trouble finding games. For Europe, though, iirc it launched late or there were some difficulties at launch or something? Can't remember, or I may be getting it mixed up with blazblue. For some reason it seems ArcSys games take a while to get over there or something.   BlazBlue ChronoPhantasma Extend has about the same level of activity from what I've seen if you're interested in that game at all."
Fighters,3e0anb,who_took_my_username,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:31 2015 UTC,"West coast LA lobby stays pretty full.  My concern with BBCPE, for anyone looking to get into it, is that people seem to drop BB fast.  And with Revelator, UNIEL 2.0, and maybe a P4AU 2.0 patch on the horizon, I just can't see it lasting.  GG at least keeps some population through other arcsys launches."

Fighters,3dyxfs,thec0re3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"I just picked up the HRAP Hayabusa on One, which is (supposedly, haven't tested it myself) PC compatible. The frame seems well constructed, and button placement is pretty good. The pause button is hidden on the side in an indented area, so it's hard to accidentally hit, though also awkward to hit on purpose at first. I have no complaints with the stick or the cord cabinet.   The main complaint is the buttons. They haven't given me noticeable problems in gameplay, but they don't feel quite as good as the SF4 mad catz TE I have for 360.  It feels like the edge of the button rubs slightly against its case when pressing. The actuation is still light and I haven't had any sticking, but it's something in the back of my mind as a possible problem in the future. Also, I hear it's hard to mod, but that isn't my scene."
Fighters,3dyhta,Sabrewylf,2,Mon Jul 20 15:54:09 2015 UTC,"A classic.  Wait ...  Yeah it sounds dumb but Madcatz policy is to make publicity on sold out items.  You can also try to import, but you will get a high transportation fee.  If you are in France, try Gamespirit, square games, or browse neo arcadia."

It hasn't been ported or emulated AFAIK, so the closest to paying it can get is using one of Ryo's supers in NeoGeo Battle Coliseum, and 2 of its characters, Gai and Silber, are unlockable characters in KoF XI - like Ryo in NGBC, Gai also has a super there where you trigger attacks with directional inputs."
