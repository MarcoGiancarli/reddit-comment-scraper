Plus his weakness literally says ""Beaten by those with long rage weapons"".  Going with Jay again in Jay x Rusty, they both rely upon speed, but Jay ends up being faster, and can have a bit of distance with the long range punch.  Going with Draco in Draco x Akio, just overall seems much more powerful.  Cool of you for doing this! I'll vote in each of them!"

AkameGaKILL,3bnrnb,TheUltimateTeigu,2,Wed Jul 1 08:21:34 2015 UTC,"Made it to the finals? I'm happy with that. :)  As for our final battle I guess I'd like to sell myself(I did enter to win after all). Hopefully that's not in bad taste in these kinds of things...  Her defense is pretty very low and all of her equipment(the daggers were useless beforehand) is negated when Draco uses his trump card. Sneaking up won't work for long because of the heightened senses. Her trump card involves tossing boulders, and one of the descriptions for Draco is the capability to shatter(and carry) boulders while using the trump card. Dragging Draco wouldn't work(for 3 seconds) because he can fly against gravity anyways, unless the pull of gravity is stronger than earth's pull. The fighting style also mentions taking time to prepare the boulders, which could lead to some openings where Draco takes advantage of her low durability.  /u/plasmaX1 would you care to say why you win in the finals? :) One day left.   As for the other battle, I'm voting for Jay."
AkameGaKILL,3bnrnb,plasmaX1,2,Mon Jul 6 04:00:52 2015 UTC,"So since I was asked to sell myself, here I go :)  Before I go into detail, I do think the only Character in this Vote (no offense against you other guys, your chars are also great :D) who could stand a chance to win is indeed Draco, however I do think his chance of doing that is pretty low.  First off, his Occupation is holding him back. He is ""NEUTRAL"", which does not actually make him a Target for the Rev. Army. However would he be chosen as to be eliminated, how high would his chances really be of making it out of her Trump Card, when he actually doesnt expect to be fought. It even says, how her Trump Card is a great Area, so considering a Sneak / Night Attack he might not be able to get out in Time / activate his Trump Card. Also those boulders are not your regular ones, since they are pretty much accelerated to mirror Meteors crushing everything they touch, hence the high Recovery Time.  ""Sneaking up wouldnt work"" - well that is if you arent basically attacked from a long range away, since I guess there are limitations to recognizing hostile intentions on long range..  Now I do recognize that'd be pretty lame. So how would she handle the 1o1 fight?  She technically could produce Gravity strong enough to pull Draco around, but it most likely wouldnt be enough for 3 Minutes. So as long as he isnt in his GodMode, she would just try to drag him into sharp objects or accelerate her daggers to actually make them a threat to Draco. Same with her Sword and other Weaponry. Since its basically useless in his Trump Card Mode, she'd try to position all her Weaponry around the Battlegrounds and force him to use his Trump Card. So now, for 3 Minutes, he is invincible.  As /U/TheUltimateTeigu said absolutely right, Nyx does not stand a single chance in Close Combat, so we are just going to avoid it. Remember her Power? It drains Stamina, but dragging something around on high Speed that doesnt resist, doesnt really take that much. So way to go would be, drag herself.. for 3 Minutes. After that, Draco's as good as dead, since Weapons are all around the Place and she would just focus them all on Draco with a big Force.  That'd be my reasoning, feel free to discuss a bit more with me :)  Other battle I voted for Garrick, since he is a direct counter trough his Speed."
AkameGaKILL,3bnrnb,TheUltimateTeigu,2,Mon Jul 6 06:08:04 2015 UTC,"I do think the only Character in this Vote (no offense against you other guys, your chars are also great :D) who could stand a chance to win is indeed Draco, however I do think his chance of doing that is pretty low.   That's a backhanded compliment if I've ever seen one.  :P   First off, his Occupation is holding him back. He is ""NEUTRAL"", which does not actually make him a Target for the Rev. Army. However would he be chosen as to be eliminated, how high would his chances really be of making it out of her Trump Card, when he actually doesnt expect to be fought.   So a random encounter? I didn't think of that. I always assumed it was like they started off facing each other from a distance and there were obstacles placed throughout which would allow for a sneaky character to get to hide despite starting in plain site. This would change things up.   It even says, how her Trump Card is a great Area, so considering a Sneak / Night Attack he might not be able to get out in Time / activate his Trump Card. Also those boulders are not your regular ones, since they are pretty much accelerated to mirror Meteors crushing everything they touch, hence the high Recovery Time.    ""Her Trump Card will almost always be Mid Fight."" I took this as she wouldn't start off with this, which is what you're implying. I assume neither of the people have knowledge of each other, so there wouldn't be a reason to start off with your best move. They aren't normal boulders? Well I think in his trump card he could take hitting a couple meteors with his maxed out defense. At this moment he could also fly to avoid some of them. While they would still follow him their speed would have to decrease a little to switch direction. Also, how many boulders are we talking about here?   Now I do recognize that'd be pretty lame. So how would she handle the 1o1 fight?  She technically could produce Gravity strong enough to pull Draco around, but it most likely wouldnt be enough for 3 Minutes. So as long as he isnt in his GodMode, she would just try to drag him into sharp objects or accelerate her daggers to actually make them a threat to Draco. Same with her Sword and other Weaponry.

After that, Draco's as good as dead, since Weapons are all around the Place and she would just focus them all on Draco with a big Force.   Remember, Draco still has armour in addition to tougher skin. His head is uncovered, but the torso would be safe for at least a little while and reduce impact should one of the daggers/bullets pierce it. Draco is definitely dead after his trump card ends though. However, CQC isn't the only way Draco can fight. He is capable of breathing fire which can act as a long range projectile, albeit a very visible one. It is enough to melt the katanas, i.e. steel, after the trump card is active. If there are obstacles blocking the normal fire balls, these ones will most likely pass through. Also, being able to tell her position through hearing and smell should Draco not be able to see Nyx, would be a big advantage especially when combined with flying. Draco could catch up to Nyx even if their speed is equal, only because he could ignore terrain should it be there as well as the slight boost flying gives him and being able to jump farther. During this time he would shoot fire balls at Nyx in order hit her. If she could deflect the fireballs in time I'm sure she'd be safe from them, but that would use up some of her stamina(the fire ball is resisting).   Another thing to keep in mind is that although Draco has low stamina, once the trump card is activated, he automatically has three minutes of, as you put it, GodMode. This also means that Draco will probably use his Trump Card relatively quick."
AkameGaKILL,3bnrnb,plasmaX1,2,Mon Jul 6 06:50:18 2015 UTC,"To be honest. I see the Fight being pretty much equal. Since IF Nyx is able to outmanouver him multiple times, she would be able to beat Draco. However I see Draco having the upper hand in new terrain, since Nyx does not know her way around there and where she should position her Gravity Fields.  But again given the Occupation, I guess she would choose the Battlefield for herself, observe the usual Locations Draco goes to. If she is able to hold her stamina long enough for Draco's to run out, she'd win, hence in known terrain Draco probaby would lose, while in new he would probably win. To be honest, it's a bit of luck and skill of whom wins, at least in my opinion"
AkameGaKILL,3bnrnb,TheUltimateTeigu,2,Mon Jul 6 07:21:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, where they start the fight(random meet up, or you've been tracking me) and the terrain decides a lot. If Nyx can outlast my trump card, the win is hers. However, she'd definitely have to be on full defense/offense(depends on how you look at it considering it'd be near impossible to hurt him) during that. I noticed Nyx was definitely a powerful one before even deciding I wanted to make a character. It's nice to see we've both made it to the finals."
AkameGaKILL,3bnrnb,plasmaX1,2,Mon Jul 6 07:29:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you definitly deserved it, i mean i had an advantage through moving up instantly.. Cool Char you got there. But here's another Tactic (probably the best) Nyx could use, regardless of the Terrain: set up multiple Gravity Fields in a Circle and as soon as they are set up activate them with the most power possible thus basically creating a Cage in which even Draco with his Trump Card is severly slowed down so she can outspeed him.. That's basically the strongest Counter i could come up with :D"

AkameGaKILL,3ak9zs,G_Spark233,3,Sun Jun 21 02:56:14 2015 UTC,"See the stickied post at the top of the subreddit for the current chapter. It is chapter 60.  Some stop at 56 because the company that translated them dropped it at 56. Another company eventually picked it up.  The manga wasn't finished being written when the anime aired. The anime holds true to the mange up until a certain issue. It was apparent that the manga would not have an ending by the time the anime would air, so they deviated from the manga to make their own ending.   Not sure what you mean about why so quickly. If you mean why did the anime end, I'm not sure why they decided on 24 episodes."

AkameGaKILL,3a9eni,DeadNames,14,Thu Jun 18 07:21:35 2015 UTC,"Basically what happened was after episode 19 the manga material wasn't finished but the anime caught up. So the anime creators, decided to make their own ending, and boy was it a shitty ass last 5 episodes. I felt exactly the same way. They did a terrible job of killing everyone and for a vast majority of Night Raid to die in so little time is ridiculous. Usually there is sadness/anger over a beloved character dying but by the end, I was only pissed at the anime creators for thinking killing every character in one episode was a great fucking idea."
AkameGaKILL,3a9eni,cyberrdrake,8,Thu Jun 18 10:52:01 2015 UTC,It was just so fucking good up until then. I'm so disappointed. I wanted to love it :(

AkameGaKILL,3a9eni,pmff96,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:44:37 2015 UTC,"The ending is not bad itself, is just the way they did it and how they rushed it. It would be ok if they did the same ending but they split the characters deaths in different episodes and the anime, instead of 25 episodes, having 35 maybe, dunno, that way they could develop it a bit more... I mean, Budo being one of the strongest characters appears in 2 episodes, Shura is almost the same, characters didn't have the development they should."
AkameGaKILL,3a9eni,defend435,2,Thu Jun 18 13:47:43 2015 UTC,Budo still died like a bitch in the manga. He was suppose to be the 2nd best in the empire and yet he died without doing anything.
AkameGaKILL,3a9eni,pmff96,2,Fri Jun 19 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"True, but at least we get to see him in a action a couple more times than in the anime, at least we see a bit more about his true power, plus he is tougher to beat down in the manga."

AkameGaKILL,3a2vok,A_Wild_Beldum,3,Thu Jun 18 21:24:00 2015 UTC,"Character Info:  Name: Nyx Gender: female Age: 19   Appearence: Average Size, Slim Body, Grey Eyes, White Shoulder Length Hair, always wears a Hoodie and Knee Lenght Black Jeans and Black arm warmers. She doesnt wear any Armor, since it would limit her mobility while also draining even more of her Stamina to carry the Weight.       Faction: Revolutionary Army   Teigu: Gravitation Necklace: allows the User to set up Gravity Fields and manipulate the gravitational Characteristics of her Surroundings. It can - for example- be used to drag other People to a Gravity Field or into a Sword. It takes a big toll on the users Stamina to use this Power consecutively. Note that it is up to the User to set which Objects are affected by the set up Gravity Field and the more Objects are getting dragged the more Stamina gets burned.  Other Equipment: Pistol, a Spiked Gauntlet, many Daggers and a Two-Handed Sword  Trump Card: ryūsei arashi (eng.: Meteorshower): The User sets a Gravity Field to a Points and rips Boulders out of the Ground. After all Boulders are dragged out the User shifts the Gravity Field onto his Enemies, while also strenghtening the Gravity onto the Boulders, which turns them into short Range Meteors falling onto their Target Location. Affected Area and Force of Impact are only limited by the Users Stamina and Strenght.  Strength: Extremely versatile and unpredictable Teigu, Powerful both in a even numbered and outnumbered Situation, Sending out Waves of Gravitation to track Enemy Movements is usefull for Preparation   Weakness: Using the Teigu drains the Users Stamina consistently and thus leads to the User not being able to use his Teigu for long, leading to a limited time for fights. Outnumbering the User can lead to her not being able to finish his Enemies off until her Stamina is gone. Features a long Recovery Time after every use of the Trump Card (week ~ month, depending on the Force of ""ryūsei arashi"")  Fighting Style: Nyx will try to get sneak Attacks on Enemies. For example, a simple Strategy is to accelerate some Daggers via her Teigu by setting a Gravity Field onto the Target and thus making the Daggers chase that Target.Often she will try to accelerate Bullets from her Pistol to strike her Targets. Otherwise she will try to use her Power to make the Enemy rush into her Gauntlet to try and fataly wound them.  If she needs to go all out against an Enemy she will start by throwing a big amount of Daggers in the Air and then give them a Boost in Strength and Speed by setting a Gravity Field behind to Enemy and drag both the Enemy and the Daggers to that Location. Her Trump Card will almost always be Mid Fight or to engage an Assault, since she will most likely be too exhausted in Later Stages of the Fight.  Nyx will always try to have a Vanguard protecting her and provide Assistance from the Backlines by dragging Enemies into Attacks from her Allies. However strong her Trump Card is, it does need Time to prepare and leaves Nyx vulnerable while setting up the Components. Also it is basically a big Sign saying ""Hey, maybe you should run?"" when she gathers Boulders in the Air. Thus it can be avoided if predicted properly and is mostly used on e.g. the Imperial Army Camps.  Stats:  Attack Power: 6   Defensive Power: 1  Speed: 5  Intelligence: 6  Stamina: 7"

Wears a black jacket with a sleeve and leather armour over his  arm. Also wears black trousers and a locket. Faction: Empire Teigu: Coil of the unscratched - Golden circlet that grants him the ability to move at high speeds and project forcefields. The speed works like a blink. Other equipment: Pair of daggers. Trump card: Grants even higher movement speed, as well as making Rusty invisible when he is not moving, for about 5-10 minutes. Strengths and Weaknesses: He can only project forcefields around objects that he can see, upon exiting the trump card state he is momentarily blinded. Fighting style (I felt like this was missing): He tries to hit his enemy as fast as possible, keeping them down with a long combo of extremely fast strikes. His trump card is only used when he feels like he would certainly use otherwise, and while like this he will hit his enemy with another barrage before running off and becoming invisible. He will repeat this until he feels like he will drop out of the trump card mode, where he will try to find a way to make sure his temporary blindness won't hinder him.

Also wears a black scarf Faction: Revolutionary Army Teigu: Sword of Afterlife – Double sided sword whose edges have different effects. One edge, thin and sharp, with Heaven written in runic language, grants the user enhanced attack power. The other edge, thick and spiked, with Hell written in runic language, grants the user enhanced defensive power Other Equipment: Nothing Trump Card: Empowers both edges of the sword allowing user to enter a stronger state for a few moments only. During this time the user will also decrease its stamina and speed faster Strength and Weakness: The sword weighs a lot which decreases the user stamina and also affects is speed. He is greatly countered by fast speed enemies and enemies who can stall in a fight for a long period of time. Fighting Style: Combining both edges of the sword during a fight to take his opponent down as fast as he can because his durability is not really good. Using his defensive edge to block a powerful attack and then striking with his powerful edge is the best way to take down his enemies.

AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,G_Spark233,7,Wed Jun 17 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"Kurome's death hit me the hardest, mostly because of Akames scream. Bols death was also rather emotional, the ost was also really powerful."
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,GagOnThis,2,Wed Jun 17 20:03:21 2015 UTC,If only the Soundtrack CDs weren't so expensive xP
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,TheUltimateTeigu,6,Wed Jun 17 23:03:52 2015 UTC,In the anime it was Bols. Loved that OST that played :)
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,BGZB,3,Tue Jun 16 13:24:24 2015 UTC,Man that feeling when you just WISH that bols and some of the others had joined Night Raid so that they wouldn't have to kill each other :c
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,Fsuwatabug23,8,Wed Jun 17 08:47:34 2015 UTC,Idk man something about Chelsea's death hit me hard. I can't pin point it but I couldn't get over it. Leone's death was the one that I think was unfair. She should've lived man. WHYYY.
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,SnowGN,7,Tue Jun 16 10:36:19 2015 UTC,I find it pretty amazing how her death could hit so hard when we barely had time to get to know her.
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,JimtheChicken,3,Wed Jun 17 08:42:45 2015 UTC,Was it maybe because she got her head impaled upon a pole of some sort so everyone could see it?
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,DodgerTinto,3,Wed Jun 17 05:11:55 2015 UTC,"While I was disappointed with how the anime went, they managed to make that one even harder than when I read it. It was beautiful even if it was horrible. Such a good character."
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,DodgerTinto,3,Wed Jun 17 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"Because at the moment she finally decided to let them in, admitting that she cared for everyone, and even taking steps to protect the people she'd come to love, that was the moment she died.  And now i'm salty all over again. She should have lived!"
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,DodgerTinto,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:18:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Leone's death was just petty. It was like sucker punching you after the fight was already over."
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,Dacastus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:47:56 2015 UTC,This exactly. Why did Leone die. And why in such a way. She was one of my favorites.
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,DeadNames,4,Sat Jul 18 15:02:57 2015 UTC,"Chelsea's death was the reason I read the manga. But Bulats death dam, I was close to giving up on Akame Ga Kill because of it."
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,BladeRegalia,2,Tue Jun 16 15:25:17 2015 UTC,Quick question! Did you find the manga really worth reading after watching the anime? Especially how it continues past it right?
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,_BallsDeep69_,2,Wed Jun 17 08:46:23 2015 UTC,"I caught up with the manga before the end of the anime, which was at the time a head of the anime. They then started to change things which ruined the manga for me."
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,DV330,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:59:09 2015 UTC,Which one did you prefer? The manga or the anime?
AkameGaKILL,3a0vb6,SnowGN,4,Wed Jun 17 11:47:17 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the anime until they started changing things, but over all I prefer the manga. The manga isn't finished yet so i'm hoping they don't finish like they did in the anime."

AkameGaKILL,393u7j,BICbOi456,8,Tue Jun 9 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"It was talked about near the beginning, if there was a resurrection Teigu than the king who created all of the Teigu would still be alive."
AkameGaKILL,393u7j,SavageKitty,3,Tue Jun 9 02:30:16 2015 UTC,The reason why the king created the teigus in the first place was because he knew he wouldn't live forever  There can't possibly be a resurrection teigu
AkameGaKILL,393u7j,BrianLai30,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:50:10 2015 UTC,"Tatsumi is fusing with his teigu like Esdese did so I'm sure he won't die. He'll survive like she did and become more powerful. As far as a resurrection teigu, I don't think so, but maybe something that allows you to see them one more time."
AkameGaKILL,393u7j,DrZoey,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"Esdeath didn't  , and that's a spoiler."
AkameGaKILL,393u7j,TheUltimateTeigu,2,Fri Jun 12 15:38:34 2015 UTC,You watched the anime and it's been out for years in the manga. She drank the blood of the teigu = fused with it. Hence why everyone before her died because they failed to fuse with it. It's running in her blood.
AkameGaKILL,393u7j,DrZoey,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:07:05 2015 UTC,"I am completely caught up with the manga and I have completed the anime. Also, the spoiler I was talking about was the Tatsumi one. Not Esdeath. I didn't make that clear.   She was just accepted by it. Teigu reject the users if they aren't a match. Incursio kills someone if they aren't. Bulat didn't   with shit. Just because she was accepted by it, doesn't mean she   with it."
AkameGaKILL,393u7j,TheUltimateTeigu,2,Fri Jun 12 17:21:33 2015 UTC,"Then it's not a spoiler. Lol It wasn't recently released info and who's talking about bulat? OP is talking about whether the manga will follow the anime and I disagreed. Not fusing?The entire concept of that teigu is drinking a danger beast blood, letting it become a part of you, ""fusing."""
AkameGaKILL,393u7j,DrZoey,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:52:02 2015 UTC,"You mentioned   That is a spoiler. The whole point of that Teigu is not being taken over by its madness.   She isn't fusing with it in the sense that she is becoming the Teigu, the Teigu simply resides within her not doing anything more than providing her with abilities."
AkameGaKILL,393u7j,TheUltimateTeigu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:26:10 2015 UTC,"I doubt there is any type of resurrection type teigu. As for who dies vs the anime, I predict that Tatsumi still does and then Mine wakes up and is crushed. No happy ending for the authors favorite loli. Leone will survive. Najenda dies. Akame lives. End of manga."
AkameGaKILL,393u7j,Switch72nd,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"If there is a resurrection Teigu, it isn't gonna be a nice one where ""You're alive! And now you're alive,"" it's only going to be able to resurrect people in a small time frame at the cost of the user's life. Perhaps their bodies too. So it won't be some nice one that revives masses of people, it'll work one person at a time, shortly after they died, at the cost of someone's life. Hell, perhaps it's destroyed afterwards and your body can't be too mangled or it won't revive you."
AkameGaKILL,393u7j,TheUltimateTeigu,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:43:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'm not expecting the manga to finish too differently than the anime (in the terms of who dies, not so much how exactly they occur). Although I would like to see a teigu that could resurrect the dead, I can't see it being introduced, as it would be against everything the writer's have done so far.  The only way, imo, that a resurrection teigu could be introduced is if it's already been in the empire's control, but due to the extreme corruption no one in the empire who's been given a chance is compatible with such a teigu and thus it doesn't work. But even this idea is far fetched as I don't believe that after the great emperor the empire then immediately became corrupt (although I guess it could be possible)."

AkameGaKILL,38emn1,Aeon_Mortuum,4,Wed Jun 3 18:32:44 2015 UTC,"I finished watching the anime today.  It was a really great and emotional anime. One of the most emotional animes I have watched. I found it especially great that the ""evil"" characters like the Jaegers even had own reasons for why they are acting the way they do. In total, it was one of the best animes I have ever watched. But that ending was soo sad :("
AkameGaKILL,38emn1,DV330,2,Thu Jun 4 21:33:24 2015 UTC,"i just finished this and it was awesome!  Am I the only one who wished that Esdeath would eventually have a change of heart and go to the good side and show how much she really loved Tatsumi (LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER ALL)? Oh well, I'm not too sad about it since they kinda died together."
AkameGaKILL,38emn1,fyrieus,2,Sun Jun 7 10:57:44 2015 UTC,"I've had mixed feelings. I wanted her to switch sides, but knew that it was just not going to happen since her views were too different. Would have been great if they were together, but... when Tatsumi dies, she kind of denounces him, and then still decides to die with him instead. Not sure what her final perception of him was."

I also have the feeling that Esdeath was a homage to a certain Jo Jo character there is just to many similarities."
AkameGaKILL,38emn1,pmff96,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"I found your review great!The anime is really good but whenever you start reading the chapters of manga that did not make it into  the anime you will see a gore, darker story, but you will actually feel much closer to the characters. There are just so many scenes in the manga that will make you love or hate so many characters. Plus, the manga doesn't rush things as much as anime so you can enjoy a slower pace and see more from the characters you enjoy with some quality chapters :p"
AkameGaKILL,38emn1,jumpshot22,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:24:31 2015 UTC,"The fact that they showed both - the Jaegers' and NR's - struggles, emotions and determination was fantastic and set it apart from a boring, linear story where there is a clearly-defined “bad” and “good” side where we immediately align ourselves with the protagonists without considering that the Jaegers are composed of people with real feelings, too. It illustrates the battle of opposing ideals and the length one goes to defend them, believing that they chose the best possible path for themselves and will walk along it no matter what.   I really liked this about the anime (I haven't read the mange either btw).  They really do a great job of showcasing how the Jaegers and NR are fighting similar battles and neither one is doing the ""right"" thing."
