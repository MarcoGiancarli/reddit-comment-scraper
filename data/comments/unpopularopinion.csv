They do have a conclusive chain of logic, but some of my strongest beliefs are to debates that don't have a clear cut answer, so my own personal sense of morality takes over.  Ie. When the morality of murder/the death penalty arise, I either get quiet or try to shut it down, unless I know I'm with someone who can handle the complete disregard for the social consensus. The social consensus means nothing to me, which tends to create problems with other people and makes things get personal.

I mean Facts can't be argued, but opinions certainly can.  If I say ""I hate Interstellar, it just sucked"". Then that's not really something to argue. But- If I said ""I hate Interstellar, it was too funny."" then my opinion should be dependent on whether the movie was funny. If someone pointed out that it wasn't really comedic at all, I'd have to rethink my opinion.  Or, I might realize I still hate it, but for different reasons. In which case I'd say ""Ah yeah. I guess it wasn't funny, but it still sucked."" Which is fine I guess.    While we're on the topic, how do you feel about the sentiment ""If you don't like X, then don't look at it.""  I find that lazy in the same way. It's like people can't distinguish between disliking something personally and disliking something because it poses a societal harm.  Like:   Onion Rings. I like them personally, and there's no problem with them existing. But what about eating meat? I love eating meat personally, and do it multiple times a day! But objectively I realize there are all sorts of problems with how animals are kept, the sanitation, and the inhumane conditions.  Or stuff I dislike personally. If there's a TV channel promoting racism for example, I would dislike that personally. BUT I would also dislike it because it would be spreading hateful ideas and promoting ignorance. If someone says ""don't like it? Don't watch it"" that only solves the personal side. But I'm not against it because I'm delicate and offended. I'm against it because of a harm that persists whether I watch or not."

Feminists characterize the apparent ""social dominance"" of males as oppression by men, when in fact its always been the women who have fought to be on the bottom, (intended.)  Men tend to build relationships based on dependability, (because its practical,) if I can rely on a person, then I'll do what I can to keep that person around. This is socially sound and helps stabilize people's lives and build a community. Women tend build their relationships around fantasy, (because... I have no clue, I'm not a woman,) which leads to all kinds of confusion and suffering for everyone.  I love a practical woman. But most contemporary females, (and more and more males,) are still living in a fantasy, believing that sexual discrimination against women in America is still a ""hot topic""...  Ladies!  Life is a piece of rock hard shit. The fact that your daddy isn't around to make it nice and soft for you anymore doesn't mean you're being exploited and oppressed. It means you're ready to take your lumps like a man! Stop whining about how you're being treated unfairly, everyone is exploited and abused by society and the only reason it looks like men get a free pass is because you can't see the sweat that man put in, or the dues he's paid, nor the indignities he's suffered on the label of his suit.

I invite you to think of a future where knowledge like this was kept only for the societal elite, why would some poor janitors kid need to know this knowledge anyway? They are just going to grow up and be a janitor anyway so lets teach them how to be a janitor when they are a kid!  This would cause an even bigger disparity among the classes, where once you are born into a poor family without the means to advance, you stay there permanently.  You lack even the most basic knowledge (because it was never taught to you) to advance beyond being a janitor, and when you have kids, all they are taught is how to be a janitor.  This is not how humans should live, and it would be wrong to deprive anyone of the opportunity to better themselves or their station in life simply because they weren't born to scientist parents."

I'm not sure how accurate this is, but imagine if your brain functioned as if it was in a biologically male/female body but was in reality in a biologically female/male body respectively. This, as I understand it, causes a mismatch and thus gender dysphoria, which is something transgender people have to struggle with. They want it gone and the only way to do that is to 'correct' their body so it matches with their brain. It's not a disorder of the brain, more of a disorder of the stuff other than the brain."

So here are some interesting tidbits:   Many people claiming to be ""trans"" are doing it for attention (particularly true on the internet and especially on Tumblr) Of those who really do feel like they're in the wrong body, most do get treatment on some level by a mental health professional (in fact many sex-change surgeons refuse to perform the operation without the person speaking to a mental health professional)   Do remember that, while you're entitled to your opinion, it is very important to remember that these people are people and that their gender struggle is rooted in a poorly understood neuro condition, and are thus deserving of a level of sympathy."

Trans people are required in many (most?) places to undergo psychological evaluation, therapy, and prove they've been living a certain way for a while before many stages of transition.  More importantly, though, lots of things make us uncomfortable that we don't outlaw and shouldn't stigmatize. Disgust isn't a valid moral argument against something. If people are happy living a certain way and it doesn't hurt anyone, it's a huge uphill battle to prove it's wrong."

Chances are they've probably not bothered to get off their butts to do anything worth mentioning so they bring in their country.  Talking about one country versus the other in terms of feats and accomplishments in history is fine but acting like you're better than someone just because you were born/raised in your country is just as lame as it gets.

unpopularopinion,3dgn3d,-eagle73,4,Thu Jul 16 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"They're proud because historically, they belong to races/orientations that have been oppressed. Being proud of that is an indirect 'fuck you i live a nice life anyway' to the oppressors.  Biggest examples would be black people and gay people, and also gay black people.  There are people on this site that would literally kill black people just for being black, just as there are people that would kill people for being gay, and there's even people on this site willing to kill people because of dwarfism in this very sub. Some people, particularly people that belong to said oppressed groups, care. Because they have undergone oppression, and some still do. Being ashamed of their race or sexual orientation is what generally unpleasant people want for them, so to be proud of it? Infuriates said people and also inspires others to be proud of it. Eventually these people get cheered on and accepted. If they didn't speak up about it, weren't proud of it, would their voices have been heard? I'd doubt it.   This is generally why they're proud of it. If they're proud of it for stupid reasons like pissing off people who aren't them, then they're just being stupid. Generally not a good idea to alienate people who would otherwise support you, especially if they're the majority, though some people don't seem to understand that but that's a different subject entirely.    Also, it's kind of shallow to judge people based on what they identify as. Eh. And to be honest, in the more progressive of the Western nations this probably isn't an unpopular opinion."

His accent isn't great, or even consistent, but if that's the worst you can say about him, I think that's pretty good.  One thing, which doesn't bother me at all, is that many of the accents on the show are inconsistent; family members having different accents, Littlefinger's accent changing all the time (maybe that's intentiontal?), etc."

The only real time you get to see serious acting from a dwarf is in fantasy and sci-fi.

For the dead animal, it's their most basic interest -- their life being taken. For the human it's at most mild offence. And for the human it's an opportunity to learn a new perspective, that animals should be respected and their tortured bodies are not food.  As far as cases which harm industry, well I'm all for harming industry. But not at the expense of perpetuating the idea that animal bodies are for consumption. I won't sell dead humans to raise funds for a good cause either, we mourn them. When the meat industry gives out samples it's because they have determined the small financial hit will ultimately help them sell more meat. Nothing would be better than vegetarians and vegans showing up to prove that they still want/need meat or see meat as food.  If someone hands me a dead animal, a better use is to be the first person to ever really respect that animal and give him or her a proper burial."

Basically, I don't think eating cheese and eggs is inherently bad, it's only bad because of the way things exist today, how animals are treated and how consuming those things makes selling meat more profitable, whereas eating meat (at least from a vegetarian or vegan's perspective) is almost always bad.

unpopularopinion,3d6b1j,llieaay,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:45:44 2015 UTC,"It's not actually possible to reform it meaningfully, here is the egg explanation from the vegan subreddit. It starts from the hens being bred to lay 10x what they naturally would at the expense of their health and well being, to the males being culled at birth because they get aggressive if kept in close quarters and they protect the hens and have no purpose.  Milk is what a cow produces once she has had a calf. So we are breeding animals to kill their babies and take their milk. That is pretty inherently bad. And completely unnecessary.

unpopularopinion,3d6b1j,Omnibeneviolent,0,Tue Jul 14 22:36:48 2015 UTC,"Why not just take free samples and not eat it   For every piece of meat taken, free or otherwise, the demand for animals to be cruelly raised and slaughtered goes up. Let’s say that 100 vegetarians each take a piece of meat throughout the day at a store, equaling 5 packages of whatever the product was. That means that the producer will now have to replace those 5 packages of dead animals with 5 new packages of dead animals.   That is not respecting the dead.   The dead don’t have anything to benefit from our actions. I prefer to respect the living.   but ate it out of respect of the gift-giver, and died from food poisoning. Not to say anyone should eat poisoned food, but that's the kind of thing vegetarians should do.   So you’re saying that vegetarians should eat meat if offered it, even if it jeopardizes safety?   If you go to someone's party or the like, and they have meat pre-prepared for you, saying you refuse to eat it and that they ought to capitulate for you is very disrespectful.   If someone were to say “Hey, I went out and stabbed a defenseless animal for you,” the disrespectful action would be validate their actions by eating it.   If you also constantly make it loud and clear you hate meat, people probably won't invite you to parties to begin with.   If someone is so offended by the fact that someone else doesn’t want to unnecessarily cause other animals to suffer, then I wouldn’t want to go to their parties.   ""Thank you! I will eat this with appreciation, but maybe next time we can have a plain cheese pizza?,""    Again, you’re creating a demand for more animals to be slaughtered. If you don’t eat the meat-pizza then someone else will eat what you would have eaten and not increase the demand for meat by ordering another meat-pizza. How about a “No thank you. I don’t eat meat, but I appreciate you thinking of me.”"

Does porn teach people what to do, or does it trigger them? How do you answer these questions? I don't know if it's possible, but even if you could, does a small minority of fucked up individuals justify us saying that we get to regulate what you're allowed to be aroused and masturbate to? The fact still stands that access to porn either has no effect on the occurrences of, if not reducing, sex crimes. Are we actually responsible for outliers, do 99% of people have to limit their freedom for the very few 1% of people who are unsalvagable?   It's my opinion that we don't.

People shouldn't have to pirate because normal media should be better, but they're rich corporations who alter laws in their favor and make competition difficult, because the incentive to force a monopoly is powerful. So you end up having DRM on video games, crappy versions of movies where original and better versions don't exist anymore, other forms of media that simply aren't in print anymore, etc., all of this combines into saying, ""Well, the pirates simply give a better service,"" and it's not necessarily because it's free. I like to think of Steam in this case, because it's actually a really good example of a superior service that costs money. I get achievements, overlay for chatting with friends, events, groups, discounts, automatic updates, and I can install Steam and those games on any applicable device. That's awesome, that's a lot better than a pirated copy of a game.  Piracy is ""bad,"" but it's only around because greedy corporations want to profit, not to make good products or services."

So, my choices are to either pay an amount far greater than the original value due to the scarcity of the product (assuming the physical form is still available), or find a digital copy that I can acquire through questionable means. Keep in mind that in either case, the original creators of the product are not getting paid. The only reason, at this point, to own a physical item is because of nostalgia.  Another reason is if the owners of the license do not want to release the product because there not enough demand. There is a movie called Nightmares that is currently out of print.

I'm not paying hundreds of dollars to watch 25 episodes of Berserk or thousands of dollars to play King of Fighters 2000. (In fact, fuck anime, it's so goddamn overpriced in general.) If it's not legitimately available in my region and I cannot otherwise use it with my equipment due to region locking. Some video games fall under this. I don't wanna buy a whole PAL Gamecube setup, pay for any mods to use it on an NTSC TV, and exorbitant import fees on games. (I already sank a decent chunk into my GCN component cable...) If, similar to above, it takes way too long to get to my region (I'd say about a year is my cutoff point.) If it's completely out of circulation. (No rereleases, remakes, etc.) Though these items usually fall under the first rule anyway.   I'm not saying this makes it right. At all. I'm just stating where I'm coming from. I never pirate shit that falls outside my rules, because fuck you stop justifying being a crook and start supporting your entertainment providers. Don't like paying? Tough. Go without (unless, again, you have to jump through too many and/or extraordinarily expensive hoops to get it).  Also, the only time I get ROMs/ISOs for games outside of my rules is if I own a legit copy beforehand. I've always been of the mind that it's OK to do so if you own a legit copy and you don't share the ROM/ISO, so it's not true piracy. Genuinely curious, OP: what say you to this situation?"

I'll break the entire thing down for you, step by step. But you gotta hear me out before you label me. At least, owe me that. Here it goes... (I'm not a Christian).  Christianity isn't very reliable, is it?   Jesus wasn't born on Christmas day.  Jesus wasn't born in a barn.  Jesus wasn't born in Bethlehem.  Jesus preached Monotheism, while Christians today preach polytheism.  Jesus never claimed divinity.  Jesus didn't ever state he was the son of God.  Jesus wasn't named ""Jesus"".  Jesus hasn't even heard of Christianity.    Now let me justify why... I promise I won't bore you to sleep. Just keep your eyes open like this. I'll explain what I deem necessary, the roots of origin. Once I clarify the mistakes in the origins, then it will render the idiosyncrasies useless. If you would like to know more, feel free to ask. I'll share what I know, but if I don't know, you'll get a ""I don't know.""   Don't be naive. Christianity isn't the only religion in the world. The new testament was primarily written by someone who hasn't even met their said prophet, Jesus.  So how can St. Paul, the author, convey Jesus' messages if they haven't even met?   There are some truthful elements within Christianity, thanks to the true disciples of Jesus, who were severely punished after he left. But around 90% is all falsehood mixed with partial truthfulness.   Let's not disregard the fact the impact council of Nicaea had on Christianity in the year 325 A.D.   Inaugurating the idea that God had a son, and the concept of Original sin - these are primarily the works of early Christian theologians with much of the effort due to St. Paul, Constantine, Martin Luther... blah blah blah.   If Jesus was truly a Prophet of God, I assure you that if you research into all records that mention him you'd learn that all Christians are actually worshiping stone idols and are misguided.   What better way to refute the scripture than to use it against itself?   Christian says: ""Jesus is God. Jesus is God incarnate. Jesus is the son of God. Jesus is divine. Jesus is this. Jesus is that"".   You tell em... ""No. Your OWN scripture... without going into debate ... negates his divinity. He himself never said so, but it was St. Paul who came up with this nonsense.""   ref. Mark 12:28 (annotated image). This is affirmation of monotheism. The concept of one God. He may say Father, in the verses... but I can assure you that he was speaking English back then, and that Father in Greek or Aramaic, has a different connotation. Or it can be mistranslated.   It's ""Abba"", btw. Father in Aramaic is ""Abba"".   All the synoptical narrations (Mark, Matthew, Luke, John) have some contradictory viewpoints and they differ extremely when it comes to many aspects.   JESUS WASN'T GOD. HE WASN'T THE SON OF GOD  They have no basis for their faith. It's all a series of misinformation. Christians, if you couldn't preserve simple information about Jesus, regarding his real name and place of birth, it's a bit of a stretch to assume that this man died for your sins. You have no knowledge of this man's birth, I question your knowledge about his death. Would't be surprising if he wasn't crucified.   As Christians, themselves, put it... ""If Jesus wasn't Crucified, then there was no Resurrection, if there was no Resurrection, there is no Christianity"".   Is there a God? Is there true guidance?   There is a Creator. Regardless of whether you affirm it or not. This Creator created the universe in it's entirety - the changing of day and night - the placement of the sun, and the orbiting of the earth around the sun. The billions of Galaxy. The sperm and the egg. Genetics. Light. Physics. Rationality. The Human Mind.   You can not say there is no Creator? Every design has a designer.   This Creator has to be eternal. The cause of the finite universe, has to be infinite, scientifically speaking. This Creator (I dislike using the word God because it carries around too much falsehood from Christianity) is extremely powerful and intelligent since he created such a magnificent universe - This Creator created things we know, and things we don't.   For every cause, there is a causation. Things don't just cause themselves, can your mother give birth to herself? Lol. in simpler terms? No. a bit silly, but you understand.   I'm pretty sure Isaac Newton and those nerds put it into perspective with their research about motion, cause and effect and physics and how things work in the universe.   This Creator is beyond our comprehension, but we as mere human beings aren't able to understand the how's. Since our Creator is eternal and we are limited in so many ways, it's understandable that we can't see our Creator. That would limit our Creator - since our comprehension is limited. (sorry for hurting your brain.) That is impossible.  This Creator is indivisible. He is One. He is unlike anything you know of. Since he isn't within his creation, The Creator exists outside the universe. Outside the parameters of the laws of physics. The universe obeys the laws this Creator has set. This Creator isn't subjugated by the laws set within the universe.   No.. I am not entertaining the notion of a christian God, an old man in the sky. Or one that incarnates into a human being and dies for your sin... ????.... neither do I say that God has a son.   But... hear me out before you freak out. One that Created everything in existence. I'm trying to convey such a huge message in summarised paragraphs, an impossible task but very valuable to those who are interested.  If there is truly one God, why are there so many religions?  Why was Jesus' life so prominent and why are so many people influenced by him if we know so little about his existence, birth and death.   The fact is... there aren't that many religions. See... life is a tree. Okay? The original message was the root of this firm tree, and all the religions have branched out into different perspectives of the same Creator.   Let me give you an example... Give me two religions, any religions...   Hinduism and Islam... at first glance, they may seem very different. But once you strip away all the politics that surrounds these religions, you will notice a clear connection between the two.   Islam teaches that there is one God (Allah = Arabic for ""The God"", the ""The"" being there to separate the true Creator from those fake ones). Meaning Islam is extremely monotheistic.   Islam teaches that God has sent a series of Prophets, the last of which being Muhammad. Jesus also being a Prophet. Moses, Abraham, Noah. These 5 are the most significant, and are often mentioned with (peace be upon them) by Muslims.   There is no denying that they didn't exist.   But Islam teaches that there have been over 100,000 thousand Prophets over the course of humanity. Out of the them all, only 25 have been mentioned in the Qur'an. The Creator has sent a Prophet to every nation on earth to remind them when they erred, or to teach them if they diverted from the original path. To teach them what? To teach them to willingly submit to their Creator. Where am I going with this? Be patient.   Hinduism - Hindus believe in a one, all-pervasive Supreme Being who is both immanent and transcendent, both Creator and Unmanifest Reality. Traces of One Creator, but they teach polytheism.  They believe Brahma, Sheva, Vishnu, okay? And if you study Hinduism, you will come to know that they really have a lot of idols.   But what we can deduce is that Brahma, in Hinduism, means ""The Creator""... they view Brahma as their supreme being. Their leader, if you must.   Now... Islam teaches that Abraham was one of the most powerful Prophets, whom the Creator blessed with knowledge, wisdom and guidance.   I picked Abraham because Judaism, Christianity, Islam all agree he was one of the greatest Prophets of God.. and he has accomplished a lot and earned the pleasure of his Creator.   Now get this, yo:  Abraham had a wife named Sara (Sarai in Hebrew)...   Brahma had a wife named Saraswati.   Woah... Am I a university professor? Because I know plagiarism when I see it.  A""brahma"" // Abraham = ?????    Well anyway...   I came here to share this... This. THIS... About homosexuality.   I'm a Muslim. and Islam's view on life is that Life is a test... What about Islam's view on homosexuality? Do homosexuals go to hell in Islam???   I believe Johnathan Brown explains it pretty good. Give it a watch. ;)  Honestly... we are not as Bad as the media makes us out to be. It's just politics.    You ever read Romeo and Juliet? Or you ever watch it?   You see how those two love each other to bits, but there parent's won't let them mix? That's basically Islam and everyone else. (Capulets) America isn't very accepting of Islam since it's the religion of the conflicting side (Montague)....   I'm sorry for this rubbish analogy. But I just want you to give the video a chance, Click it. ;)  Politics is separating so much knowledge from reaching you. They just label Islam (ISIS this, or 7th century that, or Fanatics, or Osama Bin Laden are often synonyms of Islam in the media)...   I assure you that's not the case. Give Jonathan Brown a chance, he'll grow onto you. Islam is peace, Islam is love.   Take Care of yourself, bud. I would like to see you in Paradise. ;) If Allah wills."

To be a Christian though you don't have to follow Torah as Jesus himself violated the laws of Torah on many occasions. Also Paul goes on and on about how you don't have to follow Torah to follow Christ.   The references in the New Testament by Paul about homosexuality are actually referring to temple prostitution. The translation is just bad. Thats why believing the Bible is all 100% the literal word of God is such a dangerous belief in Christianity. There are many errors in the Bible such as this.

unpopularopinion,3cejmx,domfitz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:07:33 2015 UTC,"Shit, dawg, if anything, Fox has been borderline passively supporting him. Have you seen Bill's interview with him? He's a little hard, sure, but it almost seems as if they'd prefer him to take Clinton's popularity down or pull her to the left to make it easier to demonize her later.  Now, cynically, you might be right. Most mainstream media agrees with you, even if Reddit doesn't. Even Sanders has said in various interviews that maybe the country's just too far gone, too corrupt with money in the political process for a real populist like himself to win. If that's the case, though, then in my opinion, democracy is dead in America, and there's no point in voting or even reading most news.

He said I was being racist and he felt offended because he had a black friend. I guess he felt obligated to feel offended on his behalf, given his absence from the situation and complete lack of relevancy to it. When I tried to explain to him that in video game and image board circles and the like that the word has taken a meaning to simply be a catch-all insult that doesn't actually have anything to do with being a racist remark, he said that it's still racist because of its history; context and intent doesn't matter - plus, why not use a word like ""douche"" instead? Because in that case, he's proving that context and intent does matter. ""Douche"" is a made-up non-curse word that I refuse to use, because it's intentionally non-offensive and has no relevant history, it's made to NOT be insulting in any specific way, which is the whole point of cursing in anger.  Besides, saying racist, sexist, or homophobic slurs in that setting is more of a tantrum, like, ""I know I'm losing, but I'm not going to admit it.""  To be more on-point with what you were really talking about, though: There's the case of the KKK, who once wanted to protest in a Jewish town. The ACLU defended their right to do it after the town denied them a permit. Your freedom to say offensive things, at least in my opinion, is near-absolute.

It was not a black and white situation. Both sides did their own goods and bad. For instance, Hitler was a lover of animals. He even made laws under his dictatorship for the fair treatment of animals. And Roosevelt knew about concentration camps, and could've bombed the lines going to-from Auschwitz, or could've bombed Auschwitz itself, but didn't. Theres a bunch of examples of high ranking people in the army hating the Jews as much as Hitler.

It's just inconvenient for everyone else and its not going to do anything.  Plus a bunch of people just got bored and brought their subs back up which shows how shitty the whole thing is.
unpopularopinion,3bzk2d,UnicornFritters,2,Fri Jul 3 12:37:11 2015 UTC,But you have no knowledge of it either... How do you know Victoria was fired for a logical reason? That's assuming just as much as anybody else.
unpopularopinion,3bzk2d,poopsonsheets,2,Fri Jul 3 12:47:35 2015 UTC,"But why would you ever assume someone is fired for an illogical reason? Reddit is a big company, they know how they want to function and how they want to work. A huge goal for a company is to run at max efficiency and the higher-ups at Reddit obviously believed Victorias job could be done better without Victoria."
unpopularopinion,3bzk2d,InWadeTooDeep,2,Fri Jul 3 12:51:38 2015 UTC,Because that shit happens all the time and stupidity knows no bounds.
unpopularopinion,3bzk2d,Vegetable_,2,Fri Jul 3 14:22:44 2015 UTC,All the time? Give me three good examples and I'll shut up.
unpopularopinion,3bzk2d,InWadeTooDeep,2,Fri Jul 3 14:40:14 2015 UTC,You shouldn't really need examples to know that people get fired for dumb reasons sometimes. Sometimes people get fired for no reason at all. California is an at will employment state. They can fire people for any reason.
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,KawaiiBabyJesus,9,Fri Jul 3 05:19:50 2015 UTC,"I am a guy, but everytime I see that sub its always about the same thing. Abortions, contraceptives, stances on rape, and the comments are flooded with hate of people who oppose their subreddits opinions. its pretty pathetic tbh"
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,Shafraz12,4,Fri Jul 3 07:07:19 2015 UTC,"You forgot about period shits, they used to on about period shits 24/7."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,InWadeTooDeep,2,Fri Jul 3 14:23:52 2015 UTC,"That's one thing I can't stand about being a woman: period talk. I get it, it sucks. But good god spare me the details."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,SubDee54,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:47:21 2015 UTC,"And I hate to be ""that guy"", but I really feel like some of the stories there are, erm... exaggerated. Like, as in ""the whole train stood up and applauded"" level."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,ThatsBullocks,6,Fri Jul 10 11:09:50 2015 UTC,Ditto for /r/TheRedPill/
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,emilvikstrom,6,Fri Jul 3 07:35:10 2015 UTC,They never proclaim to not be annoying douchebags.
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,InWadeTooDeep,0,Fri Jul 3 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"What do you mean, ""ditto""? Where do you see whiny entitlement in there? Are we looking at the same red pill, the one that says you should lift heavy weight, work on improving yourself, be independent and practice stoicism?"
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,niczar,2,Fri Jul 3 20:36:46 2015 UTC,"And whining about women and how men in our society are too ""bluepill"". Sorry that sub is just as annoying and cringworthy. If you want subs about lifting and getting motivated visit /r/fitness and /r/bodyweightfitness."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,jupiter78,0,Fri Jul 3 21:58:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't ask what you didn't like, I asked how it was similar to what OP dislikes in 2X.   Also TRP doesn't tell you how to do fitness, it shows you why should do it (i.e. in order not to be a pushover)."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,niczar,2,Sat Jul 4 00:05:52 2015 UTC,"Almost any discussion there ends up stereotyping based on gender, in both ways. And it often turns into misogyny at just a few comments' depth.  Here are two top posts from only this week that at least I find stereotyping already in the OP:   https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3b9fao/woman_cuckolds_husband_becomes_miserable_when_her/?sort=hot https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3bvpns/guy_wont_commit_to_his_plate_she_gets_upset_and/?sort=hot   Everything is the womens fault, men have done nothing wrong, and there is always a clear party that did do something wrong (the woman)."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,emilvikstrom,0,Fri Jul 3 21:59:52 2015 UTC,"You don't like the red pill, that's your absolute right, but how does any of this fit with what OP criticizes in 2X? She complains about whining and entitlement. What you complain about is nothing of the sort."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,niczar,4,Sat Jul 4 00:03:29 2015 UTC,"As a man, I often feel the same way about the /r/mensrights page  And I'm a fucking supporter!"
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,thekarateguy,2,Fri Jul 3 13:23:12 2015 UTC,They're basically gender reversed versions of feminists...and that's not a good thing.
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,Tumblr9gagredditor,2,Fri Jul 3 17:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think they have some good points and a lot of men's rights issues are often ignored because ""privilege"" or something, but it seems like /r/mensrights would rather just bitch about feminism."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,use_xer_name,3,Mon Jul 6 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"but it seems like /r/mensrights would rather just bitch about feminism.   Sadly, r/mensrights is often treated as a place for guys to blow off steam. I understand the need for this, but I think it should be put to better use."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,thekarateguy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:17:49 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, the subreddit as a whole is decent but the amount of bitching is becoming a serious problem."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,InWadeTooDeep,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:25:49 2015 UTC,the problem with giving voice to anything is that it sounds whiny or rather being whiny is stigmatized  i would support fucking too if i got any of it
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,babybelly,2,Fri Jul 3 19:14:38 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, but I'm a pretty conservative female"
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,Purrtuzzi,5,Fri Jul 3 19:41:47 2015 UTC,ME TOO!!!!!  God I felt like I lost 20 pounds when I unsubscribed. What a humorless bunch of boring cunts.
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,Paddington_Fear,3,Sat Jul 4 03:22:04 2015 UTC,"I agree. At least we can just skip over it, unlike having to listen to the stupid bitches in real life."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,dakky68,2,Fri Jul 3 09:10:05 2015 UTC,"God, you think THAT'S awful, check out r/girlgamers.  No, but r/twoxchromosomes is trash. It's really as if the teenage girls on Tumblr migrated and never grew up. ""Sex education sucks!"" You have the Internet. If you still can't find out what you need to know when you have it, that's on you.  Subs like these seem to only reinforce the very stereotypes their users claim to fight (r/girlgamers' being that female gamers are attention-seeking banshees and r/twoxchromosomes' being... well, damn near all female stereotypes)."
unpopularopinion,3byjpp,ThatsBullocks,2,Fri Jul 10 10:29:09 2015 UTC,"I completely agree! I don't see in any way how it is something ""special"" or apparently some ""burden"" to be a girl gamer. I mean, I am female, I enjoy video games too, so what? No one has really treated me differently for it, heck, I can comfortably sit on the couch with 3 other guys to just play some Halo together and have a good time without anyone judging, but also without anyone giving me attention like I'm a goddess for it, too.   Nothing fucking special about that, I think the times where being a female gamer was something rare are long gone by now"
unpopularopinion,3bzrac,rado1212,6,Fri Jul 3 13:51:23 2015 UTC,"Factually wrong, a controller simply cannot match the level of a precision a mouse can easily attain, not that they are not more comfortable and intuitive to use.  Plug your controller into your PC right now and try to use it like a mouse, as a practical expariment."

unpopularopinion,3bzrac,mokoko__,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Depends what the aim is. If I'm moving the crosshairs with the mouse then you're damn right a mouse will always be better.  If however there is a more complex aiming system (like navigation as well as viewpoint controls). Then sometimes having two joy sticks is better. But that's not because the mouse is  isn't accurate, it's just limited in it's functionality."
unpopularopinion,3bzrac,balancedhighs,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:32:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, that is why controllers of various types always beat a mouse and keyboard in driving and flying games."
unpopularopinion,3bzrac,InWadeTooDeep,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:10:26 2015 UTC,I get pretty bad tremors in my hands so a controller is pretty much how I play most slower paced FPS games.
unpopularopinion,3bzrac,keegan112099,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:12:17 2015 UTC,"Its all preference and how much time you put into it. Youll find that most console games have a built in ""aim assist"" because the analog simply isnt as accurate  as a mouse. However, i will still choose a controller everytime because its what im used to and feels more ergonomic."
unpopularopinion,3bzrac,pxystx_anon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:19:05 2015 UTC,Maybe because you are a pleb using a shitty mouse? Or cause you are a filthy casual.
unpopularopinion,3bzrac,Rogue009,0,Sat Jul 4 10:54:32 2015 UTC,"I can understand, because using a cheap optical mouse puts pressure on your thumb due to ergonomics. However, the gaming mice that are often available appear to be biased to right handed users.  I have noticed though that playing Dust 514 with a mouse and keyboard is still buggy, but it gives me the accuracy I want."
