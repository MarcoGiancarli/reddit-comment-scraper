playmygame,3e3jkm,mathyoumore,6,Tue Jul 21 18:04:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, just played through it, my main issues with it were that the jump sound is obnoxious/loud, especially if you jump multiple times. Though it immediately tells me what I'm doing, it's... not necessarily for good reason, considering how quiet this game is otherwise. Could use more subtle hop/land on ground sounds.  It also has no clear indication that the game is over besides the bottom part, which... really isn't a game over screen, and does not give me a way to start over the game besides the refresh button. Otherwise, cool stuff for 24 hours."
playmygame,3e3jkm,gamerkhang,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's been the theme with the critiques I've been getting. The jump sound was supposed be a stand in asset, but the deadline got me in the end. Not really an excuse, but with a 24 hour limit, gameplay beats out most things.   I'll definitely take these crits to the editing table, and I'll be back soon with a better, updated version. Thanks!"
playmygame,3e3jkm,mzrgames,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:38 2015 UTC,"I actually quite liked the sound, I found it rather funny."
playmygame,3e3jkm,gamerkhang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:54 2015 UTC,It wore on me after awhile... so I donno.
playmygame,3e3jkm,2strongtesting,3,Tue Jul 21 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"For 24 hrs, you have yourself a nice 2D tech demo based on a indie hit.   To help assist in driving feedback, what are your plans for this game? Where would you like to see it go? The immediate one I can see is adding in a challenge to gameplay loop, to make this a game rather than a tech demo or experience."
playmygame,3e3jkm,fizzyfrosty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"This started as a tech demo, yeah. I wanted to learn about liner interpolation (terrain generation, color of the sky and sand) and some basic cloth dynamics in 2D. I got attached to the little traveler though, so I'll probably come back to it after some game feel practice.   I never really meant for this to be more than a doofy, tiny game about jumping in the desert, but I might have to see what else I can do with it."
playmygame,3e3jkm,2D_Nate,2,Tue Jul 21 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"Hey, just played it, was mildly interesting hah.   So were you looking for some kind of feedback? If so, maybe add some juice to show yourself developing a longer ribbon after collecting an amulet. Might be cool.  One other thing you might want to consider in the long run is that will you remain only on an endless (maybe finite) plane? Since you can move both left and right, and jump up and down, it may be more fun to add platforms that expand upward and outward as well. That'll give your movement controls more meaning. Otherwise, you may just as well automate the forward movement.   Good things I liked were the tether physics of the ribbon and the hills. The ribbons were fun to look at, and the hills made me feel like jumping was useful (sort of).   Thanks for sharing. Looking forward to your next iteration!"
playmygame,3e3jkm,protestor,2,Tue Jul 21 20:37:01 2015 UTC,Thought it was interesting. It's your game mixtape ;)
playmygame,3e3jkm,Bypie5,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:52:28 2015 UTC,"(spoiler) I made it into space, and I can't move anymore, so.. is the game over? The info says I will eventually win after getting ""all"" amulets, but I can see uncaught amulets in the screen. But they are very hight, barely not visible.  (I've been walking for 64 years)  Is the environment random? (edit: it seems so. I restarted and saw an amulet embedded in the ground, uncatchable. Restarted again and it began with a steep slope, with no amulets)"

playmygame,3e4chi,mzrgames,2,Tue Jul 21 21:23:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks Bartek, and I had a go at Zerdian. I've broken it down into two areas...feedback and bugs. I played on my Motorola Droid Ultra (2013) running Kit Kat 4.4.4.  Feedback * The video preview on the game over screen is low rez and is the of the startup screen. It would be awesome if this was a more interesting image such as a random image of my playthrough.    The share was something different as it was actually through unity sharing feature Everyplay. I don't play a lot of mobile but this is the first time I have seen this. It would be great if there was a sub option between Everyplay and traditional social sharing.  I really liked the space waves that occur on the background layer. Really cool touch.  There is a lot of screen space, but the enemies and player are really tiny. It might feel a lot tighter if things were scaled a bit larger. If you keep them at this size I would recommended removing some of the inner black outlines on the ship design as you can't see the detail and makes it feel pixelated.  The game is really difficult in that enemies are tough to hit and stay alive.     What the is the difference between points and credits other than credits can be used for upgrades? Also am I suppose to receive one credit per point I score or what is the correlation there?   There should be some type of feedback in the shop if I do not have enough credits to purchase something.    Bugs * Pressing the software back button on my phone crashes the game. Occurs on the main menu or any sub-menu.    I was receiving significant hitches every time an enemy blew up. Seems like the particle is massive or the sound it plays is huge."
playmygame,3e4chi,2strongtesting,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:45:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, nice feedback, thanks. • it actually should put a random screenshot there, I'll take a look at the low red thing. • I think you can share it using Facebook, YouTube, etc. Don't really think I can change too much there though. • thanks :) • I actually changed it lately, it was closer before, but I thought the player didn't see enough. I could think about adding a setting for it though. • I fear that might be the case, it gets easier with practice, but it could be putting people off. I'm thinking about making a ship a little better at the beginning. The other idea was to give a fully upgraded ship for the first play through, just so the user wouldn't die that fast. • you get 1 credit per 1 enemy destroyed + bonuses for killing sprees, score is based on enemy value and is used for high scores • you're right, I should add some feedback to other buttons too • I made it so it shows a exit screen during gameplay and closes the app when pushed in menu, it seems, judging on the replies, it's not a best way to do it. • hmm, weird, I've tested it on weaker phones and that didn't happen. I'll check it out.  Thanks for great feedback."
playmygame,3e4chi,2strongtesting,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:45:59 2015 UTC,Weaker phones....:-). I am up for renew in the next month so I will most likely be getting an S6 or S6+. Glad the feedback was useful and let me know if you need any further feedback/testing/support!
playmygame,3e4chi,monsterofcookie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:41:31 2015 UTC,"I meant weaker than yours;) Glad to see so helpful people around here, I just joined reddit and didn't really know what to expect."
playmygame,3e4chi,monsterofcookie,2,Wed Jul 22 09:48:46 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I gave your game a go, here are my thoughts - remember these are just my opinions and you know what they say about people and their opinions! So don't take it personally...  Firstly Play Store Listing   Yey, you have a gameplay video - however it was really low quality for me, might just be my internet connection, I played it through the browser on my desktop. Play defaulted to 144p weird... You description is OK, you list things I am not interested in as a gamer, leaderboard? Replays? pfft - I expect those as standard. I would suggest convert it more to a story - ""You are the legendard Bart the Saviour and you have save your home planet from the swarm of the evil Swerg. In your might ship you take on wave after wave of ship""... well you get the idea.   The Game   Immersive mode and  GPGS - tick The grey pop up from you - cute, but really the average gamer isn't going to care - it isn't part of the story or the game. I would suggest losing it. I am playing on my Nexus 4, 5.1.1 and the buttons seem really close together I found I was hitting things I didn't want to hit. Settings - Lose it as a menu option and have two symbols on the front screen to quick toggle off/on the audio/sfx. The background, why isn't the ship rotating or something on display to the left of the menu options? Give me more of an excitement factor if I could see what I am about to fly. Make the play button more of call to action, like center bottom or something. So it shouts out hey tap here to get going, people follow the path of least resistance you want them into your game as quick as humanly possible. From my experience the average gamer isn't turned on by menu screens. I like your quick guide to playing -  the overlay, however on my display the ""fly around"" and ""aim and shoot"" were offset to the sides a bit. Also it isn't clear what I should do to start the game, I tapped on the screen and it started but then paused right away. I suddenly realized I had to hold onto the screen to play, nice mechanic so people can pause quickly, but confusing to get into. ""Submit Score"" not sure what this should do, it did nothing for me. The shop, very lack lustre I am afraid, not really inspired to buy anything. I would suggest making it more icon orientated - perhaps a picture of the ship that I can tap that will give me the option to upgrade with an image of what I could buy going in. If I hit the back button on the action bar, the game dies. If I send the game to the background, then tap the icon it launches a new instance not the instance I left behind.    Overall, I love the art style and cool wave effects you have on the the go - I must admit I found the controls a bit laggy, but that could be my device! Otherwise this game has great potential  I hope this feedback is useful. As I said, don't take it personally, I know what it is like to work on something and you become blind to certain things. They make sense to you, but not to some who is seeing it for the first time"
playmygame,3e4chi,monsterofcookie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"Hi. Firstly thanks for the comment. Really thorough. • you mean the screenshot or the whole video? It seems that the screenshot is really bad for some reason, but the didn't have any issues with the video • I'm constantly testing different descriptions, will find your suggestion a try • I surely need to work on the menu. Like you say more feedback is needed. Good idea with sound settings. More interesting menu could be nice, but I'll surely try to expose the play button more. I'll try to let the user know about the auto pause, I guess that might be confusing. • you said that the controls seemed laggy, what about the overall performance?  I really appreciate feedback, that's what I was hoping for after all. No point in taking it personally:)"
playmygame,3e3iwj,derekdepenguinman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:10 2015 UTC,"Feedback    Gravity is awesome. I could see big potential here with some well thought out puzzle and platforming.  The one drawback though is with the gravity feature, it creates so weird situations when you miss your platform. Logically it doesn't make sense to have fall damage in a gravity game, unless it is space driven and you just fall into space and the play doesn't know which was is up or down. The biggest one was where I walked to the unside of the large rock you start one and I was walking on its side then I just fell off.  I know your suppose to walk over the gears, but I didn't receive any notification that I had collected or walk through one.    Bugs    The Play Demo shortcut in the files is looking, for what I assume, is your local drive. This doesn't work for me. :-)aaaaa ""C:\Users\Derek\Desktop\Demo\Project Velvet Fox Windows Demo\Files\DemoLevel.exe"" The unity banner image is only 128px, make it 256px to fill out the entire space.  The cursor will travel outside of the game window when running in window mode. The cursor should be locked."
playmygame,3e3iwj,2strongtesting,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:04:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! The player controller is under heavy revision, so a lot of the bugs seen there should be ironed out. The gear scripts don't even exist yet but are high priority. We will have to work on better explaining how the gravity works, the player is only supposed to be influenced by the gravity if the object underfoot bends at most 45 degrees up or down. And thanks for the shortcut catch! Thanks for your time!"

playmygame,3e3ryk,ecesis_llc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"Hey!  First off, I hate to say it. But with my gamer hat on I won't buy this game. Before I continue, these are just my opinions and thoughts I don't mean them to be offence or derogatory I just want to help.  Why won't I spend a measly $2? Is it bad? Is it not worth it? Is it too short? Does it not work?  The straight answer is I don't know, I don't know what I am getting myself into or what I am buying, it isn't an established brand like Sega's Sonic or Team 17's Worms where I know what I am going to get. Perhaps convert to a model call Free-to-Start, let me get excited and hooked before asking me to purchase the game. Or you could go completely freemium, but that is up to you.  From a Play store listing perspective.   You have a gameplay video - Good! You have a bit of a story in the description nice! As a gamer I don't care about the resolution part, I probably don't even know what resolution my phone is. Nor do I care about the bit at the bottom, I haven't even played the game and I don't know what ""seed world aid"" means let alone why I need to wait 60 minutes - I would suggest ditching them in all honestly.   That's as much as I can say really. Good luck with it and I hope it gains traction!"
playmygame,3e2icf,onininja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:42 2015 UTC,"I've booted it up and walked around, but I am very lost on what I am suppose to be achieving. What is the core gameplay loop, that as I player, I should be learning and mastering?  Side note - Is there a recommended resolution as it appears the windowed 1024x768 cuts the side off."
playmygame,3e2icf,2strongtesting,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:01:07 2015 UTC,"Firstly, thanks for taking the time to try Tiresias, we really appreciate it! :)  The ultimate point of the game is to get to the end. Our intention was for the narrators' conversations to help you understand what areas are available to you from the current position and for certain key sounds from neighboring areas (which can be heard from any adjacent area) to guide the player to them. We use 3d sound so it should be possible to discern the direction a sound is coming from by using sound panning. Finally, you have the 'shout' ability which allows you to navigate obstacles in your environment via echo-location. You do all this with limited time and (in the final version) while avoiding danger such as pitfalls and murderous beasts.   What exactly did you have difficulty with? Was the opening monologue not descriptive enough? Where are you getting stuck?  Re the resolution, i'm checking with the programmer and will let you know as soon as i get an answer."

playmygame,3e2j21,Don_Collione,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:46 2015 UTC,"I felt mildly taken advantage of and resentment by the conclusion of the ""game"".   I wonder if the game itself was more interesting if I would have not had such a negative association.  There was no scoring, no feedback, the game was essentially a task or chore.  But that the game was not fun, and the fact that it was an advertisement meant that I wouldn't play a similar game in the future.    Similarly, I wasn't going to post spoilers but in a real life situation people are going to comment about games like this on social media, nobody is going to tolerate a game that's a few minutes long advertisement.  So forget those other guys. Global Boat Insurance all the way. At least they didn't waste my time with a crappy spot the differences game."

playmygame,3e0tw7,2strongtesting,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:10 2015 UTC,"For such a simplistic game, I don't know why it has ads. Really takes away from it.  Add an arrow at the start to let the player know which way they will be jumping.  The first spyk, either left or right, of the start position would sometimes come far enough down that my first jump would hit it.  Audio pops when spamming jump. Most likely the first audio hadn't finished playing before the same one queued again. Kill it or time the audio length to how fast you can jump.  Needs some type of scaling. I don't understand the scoring on either side. Maybe a high score for two people to play against one another."
playmygame,3e0tw7,2strongtesting,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:53:48 2015 UTC,"First of, we are working on putting less ads. It should be up tonight for the Play store and later on iOS!  We will also put the arrow, that is a great idea!  We are aware of the issue about the spike and are working on it!  Same goes for the audio!  What type of scaling are you speaking of?  The score on the upper left is simply your highscore!  Thanks a lot for your time and review, we really appreciate!"
playmygame,3e0tw7,Quibbloboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:09 2015 UTC,"No problem at all. Happy to help any way I can.   In regards to scaling, I am talking about easy, medium, and hard, maybe to include less spikes at lower difficultly levels. It appeared there is scaling once your score reaches a certain point, as the spikes turned orange, but I never got to experience it personally due to lack of skill. :-)"
playmygame,3e0tw7,Zebra-Cakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:14:16 2015 UTC,"I don't want to sound rude or something but when I read the title it's pronounced ""spic"" in my head, and I feel like that wasn't your intention at all...  I don't know if this is the kind of feedback you're looking for but it's the most prominent thing I noticed. Maybe just add an ""E"" at the end or something, so it maintains personality and uniqueness while not initially sounding like a racial slur?  Then again I might also be crazy. You should probably get some more opinions. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
