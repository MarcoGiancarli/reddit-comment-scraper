libs,3dqrxk,anutensil,2,Sat Jul 18 15:34:18 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a step in the right direction.  Another proposal which I find interesting is the idea of splitting the police into traffic, possession/property crimes, and violence prevention. Police often use mundane offences like traffic stops as an excuse for intrusive searches and arrests. I think it puts people on edge, and giving traffic officers only the ability to ticket people could go a long way to prevent things like this from happening.   We also need to get away from retributive justice and toward rehabilitation. It has much lower recidivism rates and I believe it to be much more ethical. For instance, my aunt knows someone from Norway who was caught for possessing drugs and was sentence to 4 years of university and returned to the ""prison"" after classes.  Unarmed community patrols can also give people a good alternative to police for communities in which the police operate as an occupational force. They've had good success reducing crime and gang activities in Chicago and New York in the neighborhoods they've been established in. With >90% of prisoners arrested for non-violent offences, we really don't need heavily armed police for everything. I believe organized community assemblies working plus violence intervention professions is a good middle ground between the ""hue and cry"" community justice of the past and the modern police system. Police forces large enough to have occupational capabilities only usurped the ""hue and cry"" system with the rise of unions. It's better than sending in the army to crush lower class uprisings, but the present system still fulfils that role and there are more egalitarian organization possibilities."

If you ever visit it, China is always a top source of attacks and the US is always a top destination.    I'd expect a hell of a lot more traffic to bring down something like the NYSE.  I'd also expect it to be aimed more towards New York instead of St Louis.    If you visit the Norse website right now, there are still attacks from China to St. Louis going on, yet everything is back up and running."

libs,3bv3e3,anutensil,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:52:28 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right but here is the reality of the situation. There were two parts to the question that SCOTUS posed to both sides. Marriage is a state's right but equality is within SCOTUS to make sure states are ""doing it according to plan"". SO, SCOTUS should not mandate same sex marriage but the can mandate equality. So that is what they did. Legally, the could force states to honor same sex marriage from other states based upon the constitution but states have the right to regulate marriage. So technically, BOTH are correct."
