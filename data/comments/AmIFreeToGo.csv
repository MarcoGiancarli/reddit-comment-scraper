The police have all the advantages and can apply intimidation, and the citizen really has to know all the rules to fight back.  For example, in this case, I don't know if the officer can force the driver to come to the station to post the bond or if the driver could have just insisted on signing right there. The officer implied that the driver had no choice but technically the officer just said ""why don't we do this - you follow me to the station"" and ""maybe that's a little bit better.""

This security guard is under no obligation to tell you the truth or leave you alone. Until he commits an assault or tries to arrest someone, what has he done that is criminal?"

AmIFreeToGo,3e14c8,texanwacko,3,Tue Jul 21 11:29:22 2015 UTC,"Wow the guy has way too much respect for members of the military from his video description. This major was an asshole. First he has no reason to approach the guy and start asking any questions. The military has no authority over civilians and should not be going around asking for ID. Second, the major is a fucking dick for asking if you're driving a motorcycle without a license and then saying he's calling 911 an emergency line to report that. You don't call 911 because someone told you they're driving without a license, that's not a fucking emergency. This man is a major? This man is an embarrassment to the officer ranks of the military. He is acting like a typical cop approaching you for no good reason with no reasonable suspicion of any crime about to be committed whatsoever."
AmIFreeToGo,3e14c8,jollygoo,2,Tue Jul 21 05:47:24 2015 UTC,I agree.  This was a fail.  The cops were called and the guy was harassed.
AmIFreeToGo,3e14c8,Whats_The_Use,2,Tue Jul 21 05:48:21 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the officer interaction was not included in the video, only referenced in the information section. Based on what is written, it is hard to call this a 'fail' though as the first amendment was not impeded. Both the Major and the officer allowed the filming to continue and only made requests and told lies.   It seems like sometimes around this sub we get the impression that individuals (the major and the officer in this case) do not have rights of their own. They made no unlawful demands and took no unlawful action that I can see.  Consider a similar situation say someone was videoing your home from the street and for whatever reason you wanted them to stop. You would be allowed to threaten to call 911 and ask them questions just the same. Ask for their ID, take pictures of them and their license plate, etc... If we take a moment and consider what we would be allowed to do if we were in the same situation some of our criteria for 'fail' might be more reasonable. The ones that are true fails typically involve physical contact, destruction of property (the camera), unlawful ORDERS and detainment/arrests."
AmIFreeToGo,3e14c8,Whats_The_Use,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:37 2015 UTC,"First he has no reason to approach the guy and start asking any questions. The military has no authority over civilians and should not be going around asking for ID.   Really, no reason to approach the guy and ask questions? What if he just felt like it? That's reason enough. Just as you or I could approach someone and ask. He made no unlawful demand.    Second, the major is a fucking dick for asking if you're driving a motorcycle without a license and then saying he's calling 911 an emergency line to report that. You don't call 911 because someone told you they're driving without a license, that's not a fucking emergency.   Yeah, if he actually called 911 that was a bad move, but making hollow 'threats' to someone who is doing something you don't like is something we can all do. I am pretty sure this guy was concerned for the safety of his facility, as many people in these videos are. We can belittle them for their ignorance, but they are indoctrinated to believe that they are under constant siege.    He is acting like a typical cop approaching you for no good reason with no reasonable suspicion of any crime about to be committed whatsoever.   Typically the cops in these videos demand ID and that is when they enter the true FAIL territory. This guy asking for ID and telling lies hasn't violated anything. Not exactly a pass, but there is a grey area between situations where there is no interaction or a quick 'hey you're allowed to do what your doing.' and 'Give me your ID right now or I will arrest you."""
AmIFreeToGo,3e14c8,texanwacko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:55 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? The major was acting hostile, intidimidating and acting like a bully. He should not be walking up to someone and saying ""I recommend you not take any pictures"" and start putting his hand directly in front of the camera. He gave him an order to ""standby so I can call 911."" He has no authority to give a civilian an order to standby. He hasn't violated any laws, but he's not being a professional soldier, he's acting like a quasi-cop. A professional soldier wouldn't approach someone taking pictures of a base from the sidewalk. This major acted out of line and almost everything he said was embarrassing and unwarranted."

I am not a veteran. I am not related to any military that I know of. So I am clearly not familiar with an officer's obligation to be professional and what that might even mean in the context of being a military officer concerned about the safety of your base. I don't like that the major approached the guy and accosted him, but what qualifies you to determine what is professional behavior? Like I alluded to earlier, these guys are trained to believe that their bases are under siege and on some ""heightened threat level."" His superior officer might well thing his actions were perfectly professional considering there was no assault or unlawful orders issued."

Cops know that the moment they put you in cuffs your life as you know it gets suspended. It doesn't matter if you're ultimately vindicated and freed. In that moment all the cop wants in the whole wide world is to make you feel helpless and terrified and lesser than them...which is the rightful, natural order of things in their view.  Only in the mind of a cop is it perfectly acceptable for a sheepdog to piss on, rape, mangle and kill the occasional sheep while still demanding veneration for scaring off an occasional wolf."
AmIFreeToGo,3dyyyg,NeonDisease,2,Tue Jul 21 02:32:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  It's a punitive abuse of authority.  The officer was very likely aware that the ""obstructing"" charge was not going to hold up, but he didn't care. It was about slapping cuffs on Snake in that moment.

The holster I was carrying was this: http://www.comp-tac.com/mtac-holster-10225  It is a Inside the waistband holster that thread through your belt. When used with a small automatic like mine you cannot see the gun  or holster at all. The only reason why I still had the holster on is with that type of holster, you generally wear your pants a size larger to accommodate it, and it is a pain to get off/on without undoing your belt/pants. The next time I will not even carry that though, since it really caused unneeded controversy from people who just heard the word ""holster"".  Therefore the cop didn't even know I had it until he started searching.   I never carry a gun when I am filming the police, I don't want to get shot and then they claim I pulled a gun on them. I am not going to make it that easy for them."

It states in all the news reports that he did identify himself after he was arrested. One of the police's biggest problems is they skipped the whole 'you're being detained' step prior to the arrest. By law, police can only require ID when someone is being detained or under arrested. The cop never legally detained him so he wasn't required to ID himself.  There was no law broken prior to the arrest, and he complied with the ID request after the arrest. This is probably the main reason the case was dropped."

What interests me though is that they went forward with the charge and can even still refile it.  It seems once it went viral, they backed off.

AmIFreeToGo,3dzqf0,SpartanG087,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:38 2015 UTC,This did not occur in a stop and ID state so you are not required to identify yourself if you are detained by police only when under arrest.   The officer didn't skip the detainment.   The officer doesn't have to tell you that you are detained for you to be legally detained.

Unless they see actual evidence of a crime, the hard sell approach will not help them in the eyes of people that understand civil rights.

Look out the peephole or a window to see whos knocking on the door. If it's the cops, turn down any loud noises like music and then ignore them.

They're being employed specifically to uphold the law. And they're protected from their abuses by the state apparatus.

What the cop was doing is called an improper expansion of scope. The cop can only legally do that with the consent of the driver, or reasonable articulable suspicion (RAS) relevant to the expanded scope of the search. No seat belt alone doesn't qualify as RAS for expanding the scope of the search.  The cop is more likely to have second thoughts if you properly label what they are doing wrong. Even if they don't just say you do not consent to the search and that if they wish to do it anyway they will have to demand it under the color of laws. Only then will you cooperate under duress. This then gives you something to take to court, which is the only place your rights have any legal teeth anyway."
AmIFreeToGo,3du8x0,mywan,9,Sun Jul 19 22:48:13 2015 UTC,"Thing about seatbelt, and helmet laws is, while using these devices is a good idea, there wasn't some grass-roots movement where people woke up one day and said, ""OMG!  We need laws to make people use them!"".  No, these laws were lobbied for by the healthcare insurance industry because they wanted to lower the number of injury claims they were paying out on.  So, in effect, this cop is protecting the healthcare insurance industry's interests, not the citizen's safety."
AmIFreeToGo,3du8x0,I0I0I0I,4,Sun Jul 19 19:15:37 2015 UTC,It just so happens that citizen safety and healthcare insurance were for once aligned. Less people filing claims because they're wearing their seat belt is not a bad thing.
AmIFreeToGo,3du8x0,CrashRiot,4,Sun Jul 19 20:34:38 2015 UTC,"it has nothing to do with the health care industry. it has to do with probable cause and the 4th amendment. if you check your history (I lived it I fought against it)  the cops started to get their asses handed to them in courts when judges (who were not corrupt) started to realize so many of these cases had Zero valid probable cause. just hunches or you were here and here is known for that or I know you or just my gut tells me your up to no good.  then they find drugs money guns etc.. you think well what is the big deal? because what you do not hear is for every drug dealer and trafficker they catch dozens and or even hundreds of completely innocent people get stopped and have their lives put at risk for the ""false positives"" from these illegal stops.  so courts started to toss cases without legitimate probable cause.  THIS is when the push for seat belt laws came out. the reason is simple. you are not being stopped for not wearing a seatbelt. your being stopped because the cop can say with a straight face he did not SEE your seatbelt. so whether you are actually wearing it or not is not relevant. you can not defend yourself against it short of the cop openly admitting he lied about his reason.  they KNEW this was unconstitutional which is why it started as a ""secondary offense"" only. ie you had to be stopped for something else first. but I knew the same thing they knew and why I fought it (and failed of course)  eventually people would forget and they would just ""change"" it to a primary offense. which is exactly what they have done.  the 4th amendment ""ceased"" to exist in your car when they did that because they can usurp it with the simple words ""I did not see your seatbelt""  as long as they can say that with a straight face to a judge you lose."

Some of the comments explain that he is 18, was at a party that the police broke up, many people were leaving, he was not allowed to leave, after the encounter he was arrested for hindering, resisting arrest and obstruction. Took place in West Deptford New Jersey. New jersey doesn't appear to be a stop and identify state so even if he was legally detained, he would have no obligation to provide ID. Even if he WAS obligated, him refusing doesn't justify force like that. The officers should have been able to peacefully arrest him. He doesn't appear to be combative or a threat.

Just because people resist arrest doesn't mean they are constitutionalists   Most the videos posted aren't relevant and just bait the idiots on the subs to make poor comments, which in turn make the rest of the more educated people look stupid because they're viewed as on the same team even though they're not.  This weakens the cause dramatically.  I for one am big on my constitutional rights, but I wouldn't be caught dead siding with most these people. They don't educate themselves and say stupid shit to cops and get in trouble then call them pigs...really?  However there are some great videos posted now and then showing people who are standing up for their rights in a respectful and firm manner. I like those videos and that's really the reason I'm here, to see the few that know what they're doings do what they are really standing up for, not just hot heads looking to be martyrs.

AmIFreeToGo,3dwtun,davidverner,2,Mon Jul 20 05:27:15 2015 UTC,My grammar is all over the place.  You should see it when I'm not doing so great and stop caring.  It happens often also because of physical injuries.  I agree on that part that you have a few sides in this area and yes the groups that don't know the laws or unwilling to understand those laws really cause a lot of problems for the rest of us that are active.  I've actually verbally jumped a few of these guys about it every now and then in their comments sections of the their YouTube videos.  Unfortunately a few minor things have a tendency to leak over from the Sovereign Citizen or Freeman of the Land thinking that people don't understand doesn't exist for most of the nation.  The three forms of ID one being the most popular misconception that doesn't exist on the national level and I've only to confirm to exist in one state with very specific way of how they layout what are those forms of ID.  Keep in mind also putting out proper information along with the videos helps a lot in clarifying what those laws are and were the lines are at so others understand whats going on more clearly.

AmIFreeToGo,3dt482,JohnnyLawman,3,Sun Jul 19 11:19:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the kind words and the funny video links as they made me laugh. I would like to clear up the quote you mentioned as I dont think you understand it. Right after I was sentenced I was asked that question by the media. (Would I do it again). The very next day at sentencing and after giving it some more thought out of an emotional state, I changed my mind. Below is the statement I prepared for court and the media and I mention in there that I changed my mind about the previous days question.  Here is the statement i released:  I give glory to God and thank him for all my blessings. I also thank my LOVING wife and son for their unwavering support.  Yesterday in this courtroom another devastating blow was taken by the U.S. Constitution and citizen’s rights. This devastating blow was manufactured by the very same men and women that we are told to rely on and trust to protect the very same freedoms that I was convicted for. The State has maliciously prosecuted me using TWO PROSECUTORS and TENS of THOUSANDS of tax dollars simply because I exercised my First Amendment right.  So let me recap. I,    a supposedly free man,    in a free country,    stand here today as a convicted criminal for simply HOLDING A SIGN CRITICAL of our GOVERNMENT and their AGENCIES all while standing on PUBLIC PROPERTY. This right is clearly protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, yet I was not even allowed to say that in court.   My friend and colleague Jeff Gray of Photography Is Not A Crime was confronted by the very same officers on a separate day and told that he was allowed to hold his sign that read FREEDOM OF SPEECH  and FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION,   yet the Judge would not allow this testimony. Obviously this double standard between favorable speech about the government and that which is critical,   is what resulted in my conviction.  All for what…. refusing to follow an ILLEGAL command from a person we look to protect our rights and not violate them. This person is a person that we call a LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. This person is a person who, like the Judge, and State’s Attorney TOOK an OATH to defend the U.S. Constitution and the Florida Constitution.    I want to take this opportunity to correct a statement that I made yesterday. After giving it a lot of thought, I have changed my mind. The question posed to me was “Would I do it again”. Well, I believe the more appropriate question is “Was it worth it”?  To that question I unequivocally say no. However, let me make this clear. I would do it again for one simple reason, RIGHT and JUST do not change because of the severity of the consequences. I have learned through my life experiences that I cannot control others. If the Judge, States Attorney, and Law Enforcement Officers  want to violate their oaths and punish me for exercising my CONSTITUTIONAL rights, then so be it.  I do not consider this case a loss simply because I was convicted. I consider it a VICTORY and I am not remorseful. I have done my CIVIC duty and clearly exposed the blatant corruption of a system that we pretend is JUSTICE….                            **************FREEDOM IS NOT FREE*******************"

The corruption is so mind blowing.  I think they know this is going to be overturned.  But I'm sure they know the grief this is causing, and the possible fees/costs for trial/lawyer/etc.    I'm curious as to why the ACLU wouldn't have taken this case for free.

AmIFreeToGo,3dsxmi,davidverner,4,Sun Jul 19 03:44:20 2015 UTC,"Due to Garrity, if an officer is under a criminal investigation, there are specific ways that the investigation must be done.  Police officers have Miranda rights just like anyone else who would be accused of a crime and can not be forced to issue statements that could be used against them in a criminal investigation...but at the same time, the state realizes that a necessary part of a police officer's job is to complete reports and make statements that they are required to do.  This is done by having two completely separate investigations.  One internal investigation, and one criminal investigation.  This prevents someone from being fired for exercising their rights.  This line may have been blurred here because the other officers may not have originally been viewed as suspects.  Maryland is also a state that has a Law Enforcement Officer's Bill of Rights.  As I said earlier, a necessary part of a police officer's job is to complete reports and make statements in reference to their job.  An officer who is under suspicion of a crime, due to Garrity and Miranda, does not have to make these statements at the time.  Officers who are witnesses, however, are not protected by Garrity or the LEOBR and are required to make a statement or they can lose their job.  If these officers were told they were witnesses and required to make a statement under threat of termination, those statements may be inadmissible.  This is also where failing to read Miranda rights to the Sgt. may come into play.  People are probably going to say ""she's a police officer, she should know her rights!""  However, she may have believed that she was not free to leave due to her being required to make a statement as a witness, when in reality she was not free to leave because she was being questioned as a suspect.  Reading her Miranda rights would clear that up real quick."

AmIFreeToGo,3dpcdl,megabits,11,Sat Jul 18 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like it should be said that the law Mr. Seim cites-- RCW 46.08.065-- specifically exempts police cars that are used for undercover or CI purposes:   This section shall not apply to vehicles of a sheriff's office, local police department, or any vehicles used by local peace officers under public authority for special undercover or confidential investigative purposes.   The officer stated that he was working with confidential informants, which would probably meet the standard for ""confidential investigative"" purposes. That said, it takes a really special breed of stupid to perform a ""confidential investigation"" while wearing a police uniform.  Idiotic-bordering-on-dangerous fashion choices aside, if the officer really was meeting with CIs-- say, two young gentlemen who are willing to aggressively express their views on copulating with the Constitution-- then there may not be any violation of law, here.  Of course, if the department has been using unmarked vehicles for other purposes (like patrols or traffic enforcement), the officer's comment that the car has ""exempt plates""  (and is thus, presumably, ""marked"") doesn't look like it holds water.  The law requires markings to be:   Present on government-owned vehicles (barring a few exceptional circumstances, like CI or undercover vehicles, or a few medical transport situations) Made in a color that contrasts with the vehicle (so I guess they don't get to do the dark-gray on slightly-darker-black ""subdued"" markings) No smaller than a certain size (at least 1.25 inches) Placed ""in a conspicuous place on the right and left sides"" of the vehicle.    This is clearly not the case for the vehicles shown in the video.  So if those vehicles ARE used for non-undercover, non-CI purposes, that should probably be addressed.  Also, if these vehicles ARE used for undercover or CI purposes, it would make sense to look into obtaining plates that don't immediately signal government affiliation.  But I think the video has established that we're not dealing with the sharpest tools in the shed.  As a side note: I feel like the wording of the law could be a bit clearer.  The wording quoted above looks like it was intended to mean ""the marking requirement doesn't apply to vehicles owned or used by police departments or sheriff offices IF those vehicles are used for undercover or CI purposes"", but another interpretation could be ""the marking requirement doesn't apply to any police department vehicles, OR to any sheriff office vehicles, OR to any vehicles that police or deputies happen to wind up using for undercover/CI purposes"".  I'd like to think that I'm just being a pedantic grammarian asshole about this stuff, but the majority opinion in Heller pretty much boiled down to assessing the legal and grammatical weight of a comma, so I feel like clarification could be a good thing, here."

That doesn't fly in court."
AmIFreeToGo,3dnrxb,CaptainRob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"Many times police officers don't know who the person is.  You can't issue a warrant for someone who's identity you don't know.  In a situation like that, you have to attempt to identify the person, and when you do you can take the appropriate action.  You don't have to identify that person right then.  Have you ever seen the police put out a flyer with a picture or description that says ""do you know this person?""  It's pretty common procedure.  After the person is identified, the normal rules for warrantless arrest procedures apply.  If the identifying officer is the person who witnessed the crime, they can arrest."
AmIFreeToGo,3dnrxb,MuckingFess,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:56 2015 UTC,"Cops can arrest without warrant.  However courts have said time and again, that if there's no hurry by the cops to get the suspect, then they better get a warrant.    Certain courts have ruled that if the officers aren't in pursuit of the suspect, then they have to get a warrant.  Especially when it's a misdemeanor.  And they don't have to know the suspects name to get a warrant:     (A) contain the defendant's name or, if it is unknown, a name or description by which the defendant can be identified with reasonable certainty;   Generally, as I have seen in cases, the courts require that the officer/department be continually searching for the suspect in order to make the arrest without warrant.   ""In order to justify a delay, there should be a continued attempt on the part of the officer or person apprehending the offender to make the arrest; he cannot delay for any purpose which is foreign to the accomplishment of the arrest.""  (Jackson v. Superior Court (1950) 98 Cal.App.2nd 183, 187; next day, arrest illegal.)   And that the cop should make all efforts to receive a warrant in order to effect arrest.     To establish probable cause to arrest, the evidence must show that at the moment of arrest the facts and circumstances within the officer's knowledge and of which he had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the arrested person had committed or was committing an offense. There is a significant difference between (1) probable cause to believe that someone has committed an offense and (2) probable cause to believe that this particular person has committed an offense. Probable cause to arrest must point toward the specific person being arrested. Second, the officer who lacks a warrant to arrest must have statutory authority to make such a warrantless arrest. Parker v State (April 12, 2006, PD-0250-05)"
AmIFreeToGo,3dnrxb,CaptainRob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:42 2015 UTC,"And they don't have to know the suspects name to get a warrant:   While this may be technically true, it does not happen in reality.  I've been at a magistrates office numerous times when someone wants to put a warrant out on a guy they know but don't know his name, or only know his nickname, or something similar.  The courts will not issue a warrant like that.  It would have to be a pretty emergency situation with an extremely distinct and identifiable person for them to issue a warrant based on a description alone.  And I've never once seen an actual warrant without a name on it from any department anywhere.  The cases you linked (although they are lacking in nationwide jurisdiction) are valid and counter some of what I said.  They are, however, for arrests.  My posts were speaking in generalities and I did also mention being cited and following the normal rules for warrantless arrest procedure (which differ from state to state), so my general point still stands.  The officers still have every right to detain, identify, and take the appropriate action (whether it be arrest, citation, summons, or warning) based on an incident that occurred in the past."

Also if a cop saw you rob a bank, but you got away, then the cop can definitely stop you and arrest you the next day. So the same is probably true for a traffic violation.  Bottom line is, if you aren't sure if the reason for the stop is valid, you should just cooperate and find out later."

Police are not allowed to lie about Probable Cause / Reasonable Articulable Suspicion (so far as I know it is coercion if they do) But it is very difficult for a person to prove that an officer did in fact turn to the wheel of bullshit probable cause and just give it a spin then claim it was a mistake, since you have the burden of proving he did it with malice. A judge will find this guy guilty of obstruction. I am a fan of how Jeff does it. Gives the ID but makes it clear he is only doing so under threat of arrest."
AmIFreeToGo,3dnrxb,ProAim,9,Mon Jul 20 18:38:50 2015 UTC,They can lie about (or not tell you) probable cause / RAS. They can lie about anything they want.  They can be wrong about anything they want.

I am saying if they say give me your ID or else I will arrest you. If they didn't have PR/RAS in the eyes of a judge, to arrest you for X, and they did it with malice, they are guilty of coercion. Proving it is a different situation entirely. So, this is an ideal world how law works type thing.

AmIFreeToGo,3dnrxb,jmd_forest,0,Fri Jul 17 22:52:30 2015 UTC,"Well let me correct myself... they can't legally say that they do have RAS/PC if they don't, but if they do they don't need to tell you the exact reason.  If they do not have RAS/PC and tell you that they do, then evidence obtained during the stop would be inadmissable in court because that person believed that they were not free to go when they legally were (even if the officer told the person that they were detained).  Meanwhile, a common tactic is to tell someone they are stopped for something minor when in actuality they are stopped for something more serious.  For example, I once told a person who I knew had a felony warrant out for him by telling him that I was investigating a disorderly man shouting at kids.  I knew that he knew that he didn't do that, so he would be much less willing to fight or run before I got some backup on scene."
AmIFreeToGo,3dnrxb,MuckingFess,3,Fri Jul 17 23:33:00 2015 UTC,"Even with the very low standard for RAS, there are dozens of videos on here, practically every day, where the cops have absolutely zero RAS/PC and still detain/arrrest. The fact that they don't have to articulate the RAS on the spot simply gives them time to manufacture something ""plausable"" after the fact despite Terry v Ohio clearly stating the RAS must be present prior to the stop. Even with the video the courts are deferent to the officers and even when the court rules against them they are rarely held accountable as they would be in the private sector.  The cops  don't call it testilying for nothing."

Meaning, you can’t stop and search someone just to find out if they might be a criminal. You have to have a reason to think they are a criminal before you stop them.

AmIFreeToGo,3dorjm,davidverner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:21:38 2015 UTC,I was wondering if they could be federal police since this is allegedly a VA parking lot?  They could also have some ordinance about working on vehicles but this is also a parking lot. I guess there is a lot to digest.
AmIFreeToGo,3dorjm,davidverner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:07:27 2015 UTC,There isn't really much information here in the first place.

Fixing a shoe lace on your roller skates?  Putting a band aid on your blistered bare foot?
AmIFreeToGo,3dolla,HurricaneSandyHook,7,Fri Jul 17 23:46:16 2015 UTC,All of those girls need to stop talking immediately. Being someone who has dd'ed on multiple occasions nothing is worse then when drunk girls try to take control of the situation  and act like they know what they are talking  about when they are obviously  hammered.
AmIFreeToGo,3dolla,Hju866gku,6,Sat Jul 18 00:08:43 2015 UTC,"That is a tall order for most drunk people.  I didn't like them talking, but I wasn't surprised either.  The driver also should learn that he is required to step out when asked.  I am not 100% sure about every single state, but it is likely you have the right to refuse FST's.  Interestingly, you also may have the right to DEMAND the breathalyzer if you wish to go that route in proving you haven't been drinking."

I just really have a problem with these kind of of police that wait for bars to clear out and go for any vehicle that has a lot of people in it for no other reason than to go on a power trip and take over, anyone can see that the guy had his wits about him and was doing the decent thing in driving home people who shouldn't be driving but all this cop did was want to escalate it.    Units responding for back up sirens blaring, seriously?  These small town suburban cops got nothing better to do.  Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if some of the passengers got arrested on some bs charge for no other reason than they talked back to the cop."

As far as the claim that dropping the case (if that occurs) would add to the damages -- that is wrong and a bit ridiculous.  We WANT police and prosecutors to drop non-meritorious cases.  We do not want to add to any legal liability they may have when they decide, albeit a bit late, to do the right thing and drop the case.  Dropping the case quickly is a good thing because:  (i) it relieves the worry of having to defend oneself in criminal court; and (ii) it allows one to more quickly and effectively bring a civil suit (under section 1983 and/or applicable state law)."

If a case arises where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense, the court can then consider whether the Fifth Amendment privilege applies, whether it has been violated, and what remedy must follow.

Such a settlement is a private contractual deal negotiated between parties and not official court documents. While it may force them to publicly apologize, if it goes to a lawsuit one cannot point to an out of court settlement, even if it does have an Admission of Wrongdoing clause, as proof that they did do something wrong or even that they admitted to doing something wrong.  If you want an actual admission of wrongdoing, you have a Judge or Jury find them guilty of wrongdoing.   Otherwise the next time they pull shit like this, that guy can't point to any documents (because none exist in the legal system, it was OUT OF COURT) to prove that the cops should know better from the previous time it happened."

You post lacks further details such as positioning in the pack and how large the pack was.  Check the ticket for officers involved there is a chance he had a spotter tagging vehicles at a different point.  Also since you don't specify the location I don't know the road make up.  If its a winding road there is a chance he can see you and there is a chance that he could tag your car pack long range should the road curve back into line of sight from a location around there.  Radar detectors work great in these kinds of situations because radar bounces around a lot in this kind of area.  Lastly yes this doesn't really belong here but I'm more then glad to try and answer your questions."
AmIFreeToGo,3dlug7,davidverner,3,Fri Jul 17 10:24:09 2015 UTC,"Also, radar does have a mimimum range and depending on the make and model of radar being used you may have been within the radar's minimum range where readings are unreliable. Each of the points you've mentioned are points that should constitute reasonable doubt in the courtroom if you can PROVE your point. Even then, the cop will lie on the stand and the judge will accept their lie (even knowing it is a lie). Its almost impossible to win in municipal traffic court without proving egregious errors by the police and even then you generally must appeal it since the local judge is being paid with the fines generated in the courtroom and will find you guilty even in the face of overwhemling evidence."
AmIFreeToGo,3dlug7,jmd_forest,2,Fri Jul 17 11:03:50 2015 UTC,"Also radar has a wide sweep compared to lidar so depending on range and how close the cars were together in the car pack you could end up with mixed signals on which car is going what speed.  Then there is also the big killer for small department cops, when was the last time the radar machine calibrated.  They have to be re-calibrated every so many years like most measuring equipment used to maintain accuracy.    Lastly you can always turn a speeding ticket case into a jury case since it is a criminal trial.  Of course this comes at the cost of your time to get this going but then you're also gumming up the system."

There is no point in the road where he could be at the top of the candy cane and see around the edge of the mountain. The first time I saw him is the first chance he'd have to see me.

AmIFreeToGo,3dlug7,davidverner,2,Fri Jul 17 22:59:15 2015 UTC,Well you might have enough to fight the ticket but the issue is you were inside a car pack that was speeding together from your opening post.  Keep in mind there are a lot of factors in play here and you're only able to paint a partial picture with your statements without putting out information that could lead to your identity.

It isn't even an absolute ban on the practice, just that there has to be specific laws describing how one could be quartered if that were to ever happen.

In fact his aggressive tone was indicative of what has resulted in the worst service I have ever encountered as it relates to using professional screening services.

I can only assume given the illegal nature of such business activity, the services must be conducted wiht the intention of being discriminae to avoid being caught by the city authorities.

There was also no video from his body camera for the call, records show.   The police admit his actions were illegal, but he was never arrested or charged.  Criminal cops."
AmIFreeToGo,3de4l0,EatSleepJeep,3,Thu Jul 16 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"Yup.  Doug Rose's looseness with the truth is MORE than enough to get you or me charged with ""filing a false police report"".  Or even-- if the DA is feeling like a real prick that day-- full-on perjury (police reports are sworn statements, usually treated equally with affidavits in court, and filled out ""under penalty of perjury"", after all).  Hell, I've been charged with ""filing a false police report"" because a cop was too fucking stupid to know how to dial long distance-- if that was enough to warrant charges, then what Doug Rose did absolutely merits charges.  But we all know that will never happen.  Why?  Because Doug Rose is a cop.  That means he'll never face any form of real justice.  So WHAT if his behavior was so atrocious and horrible that even his partner felt compelled to cross the ""thin blue line"" and report him?  So what if internal affairs investigators-- a breed of cops famous for the ability to ignore MOUNTAINS of fucking evidence-- found that he illegally entered a woman's home, assaulted her while naked, and tried to cover it up after the fact?  After all, Doug Rose wore a badge while committing those crimes.  That changes everything, you see.  The way our society reacts to a badged criminal like Doug Rose is to give him a gold watch, a gold-plated pension, and our hearty thanks for lecturing a naked woman he just assaulted about how he doesn't give a flying fuck about her rights.  Remember that old pledge of allegiance that was constantly recited in school?  I feel like the last five or six words could use some footnotes these days:  ""...with liberty1  and justice for all2 .""  1 : Liberty subject to the whims and petty emotionalism of guys who never quite outgrew the thrills of high-school bullying  2 : ""Justice"" does not apply to law enforcement officers, prosecutors, or elected officials"

AmIFreeToGo,3ddu1b,SaltyTigerBeef,2,Wed Jul 15 23:39:18 2015 UTC,"Fighting, noise, and offensive words  It is a crime in California .... to purposefully disturb another person with loud and unreasonable noise; and to use offensive words in a public place that are inherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction.  (Cal. Penal Code § 647.)    IMO, his intent wasn't to disturb the people, but to inform that the cops were around.  He was telling people to put away their beers, etc.  And then the curse words said weren't to provoke.    Now, if he would have said, you motherfucking chicken shit faggot, come do something?  I think that would have been different than having said, fuck you.    I forget how the ""disorderly conduct"" was described to me in an ELI5 manner, but I think its something like, you can use cuss words in a descriptive sense, but you can't use them in a noun sense.  I dont think that made any sense but wherever I had read it, it made sense."
AmIFreeToGo,3ddu1b,theenigma31680,2,Thu Jul 16 03:04:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is 100% correct.    To some, being face to face with them and screaming ""Fuck you!"" Is provoking enough.  Doing this to the right person can provoke them to an act of violence.  If the word used could cause provocation, then this could honestly go either way.  And since it was a cop, if Disturbing the peace was used, he would have lost.  But, again, I stand by my massively downvoted post.  Doing this is just a video of that person being a dick.  This guy provoked the officer to arrest him.  So, in this case I guess his words were provoking enough."

I still don't think he provoked the officer.  I mean, its the same as flipping off a cop.  Flipping off a cop or telling him fuck you is still free speech.  Going up to him and yelling it, I think is a different scenario and would merit an arrest by provoking."
AmIFreeToGo,3ddu1b,notacrackheadofficer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:21:19 2015 UTC,"I see your side, but I would have to disagree.  As a parent, if I had my children out for a nice walk and some guy started yelling and cursing around them, I would approach the guy and calmly ask him to watch his language.  Just like the cop did in the video.  When the officer did that, he did it peacefully and with no ill intent.  As I would do as well.  I'm a fairly peaceful guy, but here is where the questionable part arises.  Everything was peaceful until he yelled fuck you in his face.  That caused the cop, as well as myself and many others to react.  This is an act of provocation.  The officer didn't walk up to him and call him any names, lay a hand on him, all he asked was for him to watch his language.  A sensible person would say OK.  The people I have done this to have even apologized for using that language around my kids and others in the area as well.  I once had a kid, trying to act tough for his friends around him say that he will ""do whatever the fuck he wants and that I can come make him quit"".  Cops were involved with that incident as well.  This cop didn't react until he yelled fuck you in his face, which is why I can say that I think this kid and his use of words were an act of provocation.  If this kid would have been a decent person and just said, ""OK, I'll watch my language"" we wouldn't even have been having this chat because that is what a decent person would do.  Instead, he yells in the cops face and then bitches about the reaction.  Again, the cop shouldn't have arrested him unless he was going to press a disturbing the peace charge against him.  I think that the cop arrested him just to shut him up and prove that he was the tougher man, which is why I say that both parties were in the wrong.    Generally, if your gonna be a dick to someone, expect a response.  The cop couldn't hit him because he was on duty, but I would love to see this kid do this to random stranger and see what happens."
AmIFreeToGo,3ddu1b,theenigma31680,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:42:15 2015 UTC,"Provocation doesn't matter. The only thing that actually matters is weather or not the person saying the words should have known the words would provoke a violent response. There is not way that anyone saying ""Fuck you"" should know that there would be immediate violence as a result. This is especially true when cursing at a police officer since they are an arm of the government. Yelling and cursing at the government is the entire purpose of the 1st amendment.   The defendant is not guilty of this crime if (he/she) reasonably and actually believed that the language (he/she) used was not inherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction. The People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not reasonably and actually believe this to be true. If the People have not met this burden, you must find the defendant not guilty of this crime. - CALCRIM 2690  there must be a showing that the words were uttered in a provocative manner, so that there was a clear and present danger violence would erupt. - Jefferson v. Superior Court  ""The First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers."". Along with good judgment, intelligence, alertness, and courage, the job of police officers requires a thick skin. Theirs is not a job for people whose feelings are easily hurt. - Resek v.

I still say that if you feel the need to mess with the police to get a response like this, we shouldn't be standing here only talking about what a dick the officer is.  The guy was a dick.

As I said a hundred times, we should be standing up for and supporting the rights of those that have to invoke their first and fifth amendment rights after doing nothing wrong   Whether you agree with it or not, cursing is a first amendment right and not doing anything wrong. Sure most people consider it to be rude, but police don't get to force someone to not be rude or be arrested. You can't force a police office to be a dick, he should have realized that he had no right to tell him to shut up in the first place. And he definitely should have realized he didn't have the right to arrest him for it. Cops are people, and so they are just as likely as the rest of us to get annoyed or angry, but when you sign up for the job you sign up to swallow that and do the job."

True, he should have not been arrested, but there is a better way to show how easy it is to have your rights violated.  Like the officer that busted in on the naked woman and her home.  Also the officer didn't tell him to shut up, he asked him to watch his language.  Same thing I would have done.

Same thing I would have done   There is a slight difference between what you said and what actually happened. First, he didn't ask him to watch his language, he ordered him to. His exact words were ""You need to watch your language."" Second, unlike you asking, he's a cop, he automatically has an air of authority behind his commands. His commands always end with an implied ""or else""  Also it's rather rude of you to keep calling him a kid and call his videos sad.

Unfortunately, once a citation is being issued, there's not much you can do other than hand over ID and take the ticket.   It's utterly pointless to argue at that point and only serves to create problems for yourself, so I hate to see that happen. You're going to get the ticket anyway.   Even those who staunchly insist on not talking to the police and not answering questions will let loose their lips in a deluge of bantering if they find themselves accused of a minor infraction. Just another tool in the cops arsenal to get you to incriminate yourself or otherwise slip up. And you're legally detained while they cite you. Expedite that process, especially if all you're saying is stuff to shame cops who couldn't care less what you think.  If the goal at that point is provoking gunfire or assault, I don't find that very bright.  That knife snatch was complete BS though, and the little game they're playing when we wants it back."

AmIFreeToGo,3d9e8l,reconditecache,18,Tue Jul 14 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"->Facebook<-, as a private entity, doesn't. But a government entity utilizing Facebook as a public forum may.   Communications made with the public, regardless of medium, may be regulated or bound by Open Records/Sunshine laws, FOIA, Records Retention laws, etc.  If the government entity is using Facebook as an official communications channel and information dissemination tool then it cannot be allowed to ""shape the narrative"" just any ol' way it sees fit. It's still a government entity operating on the public's dime so it must abide by Constitutional protections and guarantees."
AmIFreeToGo,3d9e8l,nspectre,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:57:25 2015 UTC,"Right. And they're absolutely liable for everything they state there, but they aren't then obligated to give every person who posts a platform to speak any more than they have to let somebody at a live press conference blow an airhorn for however long he wants. That guy can be ejected from the press conference and comments can be removed from facebook for even the flimsiest of reasons which effectively means their facebook page isn't a free speech platform and you'd be hard-pressed to argue that it even can be.  Basically assume from the start that you aren't seeing the whole picture.  But also assume a number of those removed posts are verified trolls, so it's not always 100% malicious. It can just very easily become malicious."
AmIFreeToGo,3d9e8l,reconditecache,5,Tue Jul 14 20:10:48 2015 UTC,"1) That is a terrible analogy  2) It most certainly does depend upon State and Federal laws. Not the desires or wishes of the government agency.  For example, in the words of Florida's State Atty General:   Public Records – Social Networking   Social networking sites such as Facebook are becoming increasingly popular in business as well as social contexts.  Many elected officials use Facebook as a method to keep in touch with their constituents.  If a government entity, such as a city, were to choose to maintain a Facebook page, there would be several factors to consider under Florida’s public records and open meetings laws.   First, all contents of the city's page, including information about the city’s friend list, would be subject to disclosure under Florida’s Public Records Act.   Second, the city will be obligated to follow a public records retention schedule as set forth in the State of Florida General Records Schedule for State and Local Government Agencies.  Third, communications on the city's Facebook page regarding city business would be subject to Florida's Government in the Sunshine Law.  Since the city is authorized to exercise powers for a municipal purpose, any material placed on the city’s page would presumably be in furtherance of municipal business. Section 119 of the Florida Statutes defines ""public records"" to include”   ""all documents, papers, letters, maps, books, tapes, photographs, films, sound recordings, data processing software, or other material, regardless of the physical form, characteristics, or means of transmission, made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by any agency.""  The Florida Supreme Court has interpreted this definition to include all materials made or received by an agency in connection with official business which are used to perpetuate, communicate, or formalize knowledge.  It is the content of the record created which determines whether it is a public record. The placement of information on the city's Facebook page would communicate knowledge, and would presumably be in connection with the transaction of official business.  This would subject the contents of the Facebook page to the provisions of Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes.   [...more at link...]   Finally, let’s talk about records retention.  Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes requires the Division of Library and Information Services of the Department of State to adopt rules establishing retention schedules and a disposal process for public records. Each agency must comply with these rules.  To the extent that the information on the city's Facebook page constitutes a public record, the city is under an obligation to follow the public records retention schedules established by law.   [emphasis mine.]"
AmIFreeToGo,3d9e8l,nspectre,0,Tue Jul 14 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"Right. I would have imagined that they had to keep official records of everything posted. So you could totally subpoena the whole thread (after an official request form is submitted), but I can't imagine why they would not be allowed to remove posts (while keeping records of them) that only contained the N-word a dozen times or anything else that they deemed disruptive or inciting. That would be ridiculous.  Basically, having to retain records of all official communication with the office doesn't, in any way, stop them from effectively censoring anything they don't like on their live facebook page since to do so could in some outlandish circumstances make them accessories to other crimes. They would not have written laws that tied there hands in such a way.  Note that I don't believe that gives them the right to censor literally anything they want but I imagine they can come up with all sorts of reasons why they have to take certain posts down and you can only contest it later, in which case the damage is already done. So don't trust it in the first place."
AmIFreeToGo,3d9e8l,reconditecache,2,Tue Jul 14 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"Think about it from the 180 degree angle. There's nothing difficult or expensive about ""retain all teh things!"" The public entity literally has to do nothing.  And the public entity is NOT vested with the authority to arbitrarily decide for itself what should or should not be considered ""disruptive or inciting"". THAT would be ridiculous. THAT's best left to the legislature and judiciary (and, by extension, We The People)."
AmIFreeToGo,3d9e8l,nspectre,0,Tue Jul 14 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"And maybe in a few years when online harassment law and official online conduct policy has been codified in an effective way, nobody will be expected to use their discretion regarding what qualifies as a legitimate reason to remove a comments from their facebook page.  This isn't about perspectives. I'm not saying that I like it. I'm simply explaining what can only be reasonably expected from government entities in situations as relatively new as their responsibilities online through 3rd party organizations to provide just as much of a mouthpiece to everybody who communicates a response using this medium.  Unless you believe that they have zero right to remove anything from their facebook page that was posted there by a user who claims to be from their district, then somebody has to have some discretion in regards to what can be taken down and we don't have machines smart enough to be effective filters so it has to be a fallible/corruptible human."

AmIFreeToGo,3d9e8l,nspectre,3,Tue Jul 14 23:03:52 2015 UTC,"I think the violation would stem from a government agency setting up a space (the FB page) for public commentary, but not allowing all comments that fall under the FB ToS"
AmIFreeToGo,3d9e8l,wei-long,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:30:42 2015 UTC,It wouldn't technically be a violation at all. It's just a dick move.

But if the camera man was correct, that BG got the warrant under false pretenses, then the warrant is invalid anyhow.  Looks like an example of ""This is how we always do it"" doesn't mean that they've been doing it lawfully. Just because they've been getting away with it before now doesn't mean they've been following the proper and lawful process.  Also to note: If this had happened in the US, not only would the camera man have been arrested very shortly into the video... the police themselves would be doing the forced entry and not the utility company. It seems that the UK has some rather unique and strict parameters surrounding this event. (things like not allowed to break the door down, only permitted to drill locks) Everything I see in the video (so far) seems to bolster the camera man's argument...  Edit: British Gas's hired locksmith admits defeat around the 39 minute mark, British Gas tells them the only way they will pay for damages is if the homeowner consents to let them in by opening the door for them.

AmIFreeToGo,3d71bn,803PoliceVideos,2,Tue Jul 14 02:02:15 2015 UTC,I don't have a HUGE problem with this video unlike others posted in this sub.  Freedom is a double edged sword.  There's nothing wrong or illegal with an officer running any plate he sees or attempting to ask any citizens questions (that are entertaining a cooperative encounter).  I don't have to give an officer my ID if it's not a stop and ID state but I don't find anything inherently wrong with an officer asking for it.   The only thing in this video that I think has the chance to be unethical (given the context) is if the officer was following the guy or trying to intimidate him without legal provocation.  If all the cop did was circle back around a store to get a plate number...I really don't see anything inherently wrong with that.  I want police to be suspicious and inquisitive of things.  I just want them to respect the constitution and not infringe on the rights of others.
AmIFreeToGo,3d71bn,CMUpewpewpew,5,Tue Jul 14 17:27:14 2015 UTC,This video is more about the Lt. saying multiple times that filming the police is suspicious because you might be a terrorist.

AmIFreeToGo,3d6j3q,HurricaneSandyHook,5,Mon Jul 13 22:26:36 2015 UTC,"Tax maps are displayed on google maps [use at own risk], if one zooms in all the way. The faint property lines. Tax maps can be viewed at any county clerk's office. Just have an address to give someone at the desk in Real Property Records. You'll be shortly led to the tax map for whatever property you want. The ''Street Dedication Deed'' can also be obtained, but may be more tricky. If the last deed of record can be found, one can see if the property is part of a development, and the relevant development filing info will be printed there. From there one can find the original ''Filed Map'' of said development. Urban and suburban areas will be somewhat easy. Rural areas, good luck. It should be as easy as finding the simple tax map though, which SHOULD show the street width. Cut in half and measure from the middle. Often large bands of ''owner's lawn'' is the street, upon which you may trod at will. To be clear I am talking about local county tax maps, not IRS tax maps, although I suspect they are the same, but cannot say for sure. It should cost less than a dollar to have a print out of the tax map of where ever you plan to chill for a while. An hour or so in the county clerk's is worth the ability to tell the oppressive  ''them''  to fuck off. You might discover amazing swaths of land that is quite public access. Edit: example: http://www2.erie.gov/ecrpts/sites/www2.erie.gov.ecrpts/files/uploads/Digital%20Tax%20Map%20SS%20%232.png Edit 2. On zooming in with google maps, find an area with curbs, or sidewalks, look at satellite maps. Then compare to the tax map lines on regular maps. You will see that the curb is extremely rarely within 5 feet of any property line. It's not an ''easement'' , it's the street or road. Switch back and forth, zoomed in to see. Curb? That is street, anywhere they were put in by a municipality. Private roads are different. The only way to tell a private road, is to see a sign marking it as such."

After the arrest, I would have done a few things differently. I shouldn't have had my wallet on me. that made them identifying me easier, and they were also able to find out where I worked from it.

AmIFreeToGo,3d4h5y,jollygoo,6,Mon Jul 13 14:22:57 2015 UTC,Agreed. It appears the Va. AG document you posted should squash this eventually.
AmIFreeToGo,3d4h5y,badson100,4,Mon Jul 13 14:25:38 2015 UTC,It was clear you were not being detained when you walked away.  The cop even said so.  Did you say anything back at the station?
AmIFreeToGo,3d4h5y,badson100,8,Mon Jul 13 21:59:10 2015 UTC,Never ended up in the station. They released me on a summons after interrogating me for an hour.
AmIFreeToGo,3d4h5y,TatianaWisla,5,Mon Jul 13 22:30:55 2015 UTC,How does that work?  You invoked your 5th amendment right.  Did they still sit you in a room and ask you questions you wouldn't answer for an hour?
AmIFreeToGo,3d4h5y,jollygoo,7,Tue Jul 14 01:04:02 2015 UTC,They held me in handcuffs and made me stand behind a cop car and asked me questions constantly. At one point they told me that if I answered their questions they would let me go. I refused.
AmIFreeToGo,3d4h5y,nspectre,5,Tue Jul 14 01:08:01 2015 UTC,I've been brainwashed by Law and Order to think they just get pissed and storm out when you invoke your rights.

AmIFreeToGo,3d4h5y,heljestrand,9,Tue Jul 14 05:55:57 2015 UTC,"US Supreme Court upheld circuit court holdings: A person can not be required to furnish identification if not reasonably suspected of any criminal conduct. A reasonable suspicion of criminal activity alone is insufficient to justify a patdown search The person stopped is not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest. Vagrancy ordinances cannot turn otherwise innocent conduct into a crime. Personal liberty, which is guaranteed to every citizen under U.S. Constitution and laws, consists of the right of locomotion, to go where one pleases, and when, and to do that which may lead to one's business or pleasure, only so far restrained as the rights of others may make it necessary for the welfare of all other citizens. One may travel along the public highways or in public places; and while conducting themselves in a decent and orderly manner, disturbing no other, and interfering with the rights of no other citizens, there, they will be protected under the law, not only their persons, but in their safe conduct. Any law that would place the keeping and safe conduct of another in the hands of even a conservator of the peace, unless for some breach of the peace committed in his presence, or upon suspicion of felony, would be most oppressive and unjust, and destroy all the rights, which the Constitution guarantees. An innocent person cannot generally know when a police officer has reasonable cause to believe that his behavior warrants further investigation for criminal activity, and therefore cannot know when refusal to identify himself will be a crime. No one may be required under peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. Police knowledge of the identity of an individual they have deemed ""suspicious"" grants the police unfettered discretion to initiate or continue investigation of the person long after the detention has ended. Information concerning the stop, the arrest and the individual's identity may become part of a large scale data bank. The serious intrusion on personal security outweighs the mere possibility that identification may provide a link leading to arrest"

AmIFreeToGo,3d4h5y,heljestrand,0,Mon Jul 13 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"That's what courts are for.  Everything comes out there.  The reason why they proceed is because they only have one side of the story.  The cop's story.  The only time you get to tell your side is in court or maybe a pre-hearing.  And no need to shame them in court, doesn't look good for you in the eyes of the judge.  It's much better to catch them in a lie or have them bring up reasonable doubt in their testimony instead.  Those cops knew exactly what they were doing, they ain't stupid.  They knew they were violating your rights and misapplying the law.  But they don't give a shit.  They figured you'd roll or they would get away with it.  Abuse of authority right there.  Ask any cop if they feel bad when they violate your rights.  All would laugh in your face.  Because in their minds, you are already a criminal and criminals don't have rights.  No doubt these cops needed reasonable suspicion just to detain you, yet alone, arrest you.  A guy holding a camera in a public place and refusing to identify should never be deemed reasonable.  Focus on finding what their ""reasonable suspicion"" was will be enough to make these cops look like idiots without even trying.  Or ask them if invoking your 5th is obstruction.  If they answer yes, they're done for."

Do the police have a legitimate case against you are is this something that is going to be quickly thrown out of court?  Also are your intentions to sue immediately afterwards (assuming a quick not guilty verdict) or are you going to just let this one go?
AmIFreeToGo,3d4h5y,boiling_frogs,20,Mon Jul 13 15:04:14 2015 UTC,"There is no case at all. There is a very high bar for obstruction in Virginia. There is a ton of case law that my attorney and I have dug up that easily supports us, and there is even the AG's opinion that addresses this exact issue which states(backed by case law), that the police cannot do this.  So basically the only way I am going to lose is if my lawyer gets hit by a truck, or if I get railroaded like FTG did.  As far as civil stuff, we will cross that bridge when we get to it.

I'm unfamiliar with the laws in your state, however, most states require an evidentiary hearing  of some kind before a magistrate to determine if probable cause existed for the arrest without warrant.    I remember seeing the summons.  I'm unsure about your state laws but most states say that a summons must issue forth from a court with jurisdiction and must be based upon probable cause.  Does this apply in your state?  Was your summons issued from the court or from the cop who arrested you?    After they arrested you did they take you to jail?    Did they have a hearing before a magistrate to determine if probable cause existed for the arrest without warrant?  If so, what evidence was provided at this hearing?  Were you present at this hearing?  Was the attorney for the commonwealth present at this hearing?    You've apparently already been arraigned.  Did you have counsel present at arraignment?  Did you enter a plea?  There shouldn't be a trial.  The cops had no authority to arrest.  This case should be dismissed by the court.  The judge should recognize that instantly.

AmIFreeToGo,3d4h5y,SamSpoon,5,Mon Jul 13 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"from a Virginia attorney's website as to Obstruction....  ""Obstruct"" means to commit a direct act in order to oppose or resist. For example, refusing to allow a permissible pat down search, refusing to spit out drugs hidden in your mouth, struggling with a law enforcement officer, twisting away from the grip of a law enforcement officer, and/or shouldering yourself into a law enforcement officer is an obstruction because it is a direct act committed in order to oppose or resist the law enforcement officer. However, merely making a law enforcement officer's task more difficult, running away from a law enforcement officer, and/or refusing to identify yourself to a law enforcement officer is not an obstruction because it is not a direct act committed in order to oppose or resist the law enforcement officer – instead – it is merely conduct committed in order to avoid prosecution."

So, when you are stopped, you are detained, with what seem like the usual rules. You can be forced to provide ID, but don't need to answer questions.

AmIFreeToGo,3d2ygh,Myte342,2,Mon Jul 13 11:55:38 2015 UTC,what case is that?
AmIFreeToGo,3d2ygh,Stryker682,2,Mon Jul 13 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"Commonwealth vs Hill (2002) As pointed out by a very well respected attorney who deals with Rights related issues quite often:   There are a couple of problems with this paragraph. First, the creation of an arbitrary distinction between ""detention"" and ""arrest"" that doesn't really exist. The word, ""arrest"", comes to us in the law from Norman French, and simply means, ""stop"". Historically, there are three levels of arrest: consensual stop, investigative stop, and full custody. In a consensual stop, it's by consent because the person stopped agrees to stop and can walk away any time he likes. Reasonable suspicion is required for an investigative stop, and although the individual is not in full custody, he does not have the right to walk away. It is this intermediate level of arrest that Terry v. Ohio applies to; there's really no such thing as a ""Terry stop"", the power to search in the event of a perceived threat (and there has to be one) to ""officer safety"", arises out of the need to detain the individual until a decision whether to place him in custody has been made; that is to determine whether more than reasonable suspicion, i.e., probable cause, exists.  So no real suspicion or cause is necessary for the consensual stop - anyone can stop anyone else at any time to ask a question, for example, ""Where's the nearest bus stop?""; and the cops power, absent reasonable suspicion that ""crime is afoot"" and that the individual stopped is either responsible or a material witness, is limited to chatting. If there is reasonable suspicion, then the cops can detain a person, in handcuffs if necessary. But when I ask you where the bus stop is, I've ""arrested"" you. So the Court's distinction between ""detention"" and ""arrest"" is like a distinction between ""truck"" and ""vehicle"".  So in my opinion, the Court is just plain wrong on the issue of illegal arrests. I think the case could have been decided simply on the basis of reasonable suspicion, without talking about the right to refuse to submit to an illegal arrest, since the cop doesn't actually have to be right in his judgment, only that he have a reasonable basis for thinking there's something that needs investigating that he can talk about (a ""hunch"" is good enough to stop someone to chat, but there has to be reason to think there's crime going on to do more than that). I think the Court confused the standards to be applied, and went where it didn't need to go.  A great deal of the problems created by judicial opinions like Hill are, in my mind, the result of bad lawyering. If an attorney doesn't frame the issues on appeal in such a way as to allow the Court to do something sensible, then it will do something that is, shall we say, less than helpful. I think Hill is open to question and the real kicker is going to be what happens the next time the Court entertains such a case."

I view this similar to Mr. Skidmore striking the court security when the security grabbed him and his camera without cause. He was defending his person from unwanted assault by an armed individual acting under color of law (illegally). EVERYONE has the right to resist unlawful activity, no matter who does that activity."

Best not to ever smoke in your car, and if transporting meds, use a mason jar or other odor proof container. And of course, be polite (but not servile), and above all, keep your mouth shut! An interesting question arises - can a person operating a vehicle, who is not the owner, give consent to search? Couldn't find anything on that. If highwaymen want to search a house, an ""occupant"" can give permission, but the owner's refusal trumps it."

In all cases the owner stayed silent so the search was upheld. The cop can also claim they didn't know the other person in the car was the owner.  GEORGIA v.

AmIFreeToGo,3d0qjj,DILYGAF,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:46:54 2015 UTC,It appears like the guy is filming just fine.  He is in complete control of his own camera.  No one is trying to stop the camera from recording.
AmIFreeToGo,3d0qjj,93_Vector,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:50:56 2015 UTC,Do you think that shining a bright flashlight into a camera has no effect on the filming?   It's comments like these that make me think you are just trying to argue with people.
AmIFreeToGo,3d0qjj,DILYGAF,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"Sure it has an affect, but is it a prior restraint?  No.  What's the firefighter censoring?  His face? What if he puts his air mask on?  Is that a prior restraint now?  What if they block in the scene with fire trucks and ambulances?  Is that a prior restraint because he doesn't get to see the kid on the ground anymore?  A flashlight to the camera sensor is such a stretch it would never stand up as a prior restraint."
AmIFreeToGo,3d0qjj,93_Vector,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:02:13 2015 UTC,"The firefighter is preventing the person operating the camera from filming. I just don't see how you are ignoring this. It doesn't matter if he is preventing filming a little, or preventing filming entirely.  If the purpose of the action is to prevent filming, that is censorship, and it is prior restraint. It doesn't matter if you don't think it is prior restraint."
AmIFreeToGo,3d0qjj,DILYGAF,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:42:07 2015 UTC,He's not preventing any filming at all.  The only reason filming actually stops is because the guy's phone runs out of either memory or battery at the end.

But that being said, there is a proper way to film this sort of thing.  I have been a professional cameraman for over 15 years now working for many large cable networks.  This guy was way to close, there is a reason Electronic News Gathering cameras have a powerful zoom lens.  Stand way back, or risk, like this guy did, becoming part of the story.  Also, people seem to think if paramedics are on the scene, something exciting must be happening.  In fact, the exciting part happened way earlier, this is just the aftermath.  And last, just have a little bit of human decently, this is probably one of the worst moments in someone life.  I'm all for people shoving a camera in a cops face and shouting about the first amendment, but keep in mind that unlike cops, EMTs and firefighters actually do care, and are there to help people."

There are also almost no department policies that compel EMTs to tell someone who they are.  The guy filming is an idiot.  Try walking into a hospital and film doctors talking to their patients.  He's lucky he basically gets to hang onto the stretcher while he's filming this.    If it were my scene he'd be at least 5ft further back so he can't touch my equipment, and even further if he started talking to my patient.  I'd even string up yellow tape if I have to.    When he starts trying to talk to the patient make and medical decisions for him is the most maddening part (you should go to the hospital dude.

So, it's safe to say, he's trying to help as well.  Now....  The EMT's are not at all concerned about his demeanor or his advice. THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS FILMING. And being privileged super-citizens, they feel entitled to tell him to stop. But they are not. We've seen this over and over again."
AmIFreeToGo,3d0qjj,Guy_Dudebro,-3,Sun Jul 12 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"No, seriously, the EMT is trying to talk to the patient, and this guy has no right to stand behind them and give medical advice especially when he's not family or a legal guardian of the patient.  He doesn't know this kid, he doesn't know what this kid's parents want, he doesn't know what the EMT is seeing in his assessment.  Sure he can say whatever he wants, but if he's disrupting patient care, the EMT has every right to move him to a place where he won't be disruptive.  This isn't a public place in this video, it's an incident scene, and the EMTs have every right to control who has access to it.  The people standing around watching?  Sure.

The people standing around watching? Sure. The asshole standing behind them interrupting patient care by shouting medical advice and the demanding names when told to stop? Fuck no, get out of my incident scene.   Please don't be intellectually dishonest. Nobody gave a shit about him while he was speaking to the patient. They only cared about the filming. It's a weird, primal aversion that humans seem to have. Just be honest (while I engage in rhetorical hyperbole): The responders did not want their soul or the patient's soul stolen by the photographer. And they were willing to back up their superstition with something bordering on physical force.  That's what it boils down to: ""Filming people is... I don't know it's icky... you shouldn't be doing it... what if I want to pick my nose?!"" Something something HIPAA. Something something minor. Something something interfering with my scene.  And you? You stick up for them not because you watched the video objectively and you have a problem with people ""shouting medical advice"" (which BTW was in line with their advice, unless they were advising him not to go to the ER), but because they are part of your special tribe who needs to be perceived to have super-duper-special access and control - backed by force - over and any and every public place whenever someone stubs their toe.  Please see this post for more information."
AmIFreeToGo,3d0qjj,Guy_Dudebro,-4,Sun Jul 12 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're being deliberately obtuse.  When I say ""he can say whatever he wants"" I mean it in the sense that he can go scream fire in a crowded theater if he wants, that doesn't mean hems free from any repercussions to those actions.  Sure he can interrupt the patient assessment if he wants, but he can't get all huffy when the EMT turns around and tells him to go away.   Please don't be intellectually dishonest. Nobody gave a shit about him while he was speaking to the patient.   Actually that's exactly when they started ""giving a shit"" about him.  The EMT didn't feel a camera behind him using his Spidey sense.  He turned around because some asshole just started giving unsolicited medical advice to his patient.   You stick up for them not because you watched the video objectively and you have a problem with people ""shouting medical advice"" (which BTW was in line with their advice, unless they were advising him not to go to the ER)   Admittedly you have no idea what the EMTs advice was?  Even after you say the guy shouting ""go to the hospital, I'm sure your parents have insurance if they live here"" is in line with what the EMTs were advising?  As an EMT, I'll tell you what was going on:  the kid was a minor, and not legally allowed to refuse transport, but he didn't want to go to the hospital.  He was calling his parents so that the EMTs could get a legal guardian's consent to transport or not.  Non of this has anything to do with HIPAA (because the guy filming is not a covered entity) and everything to do with an emergency responder's right to deny someone access to their scene, unless you can point to anyone else who was allowed to give unsolicited medical advice and interrupt patient care and was not asked to go away?"
AmIFreeToGo,3d0qjj,93_Vector,4,Sun Jul 12 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"Please. Please stop trying to pretend this had to do with anything other than his camera. PLEASE. You can't be that ""obtuse.""

You typed (all emphasis added):   He [has] literally no right to [...] try and give a complete stranger medical advice.  this guy has no right to stand behind them and give medical advice   Yes. Yes, he does. DO YOU KNOW WHAT ""RIGHT"" MEANS?   that doesn't mean [he's] free from any repercussions to those actions   What repercussions are these? Being told he's an asshole? No, I agree. Being frowned at? No, I agree. Having a strobe light shined in your camera? Debatable, but probably I agree - does color-of-law cover the FD, prolly not. Being pushed around, being compelled by your precious laws and your government!? I absolutely disagree. That is EXACTLY what ""right"" means. Had this person been arrested for what he did (as you imply), it would absolutely be a rights violation.  ""Hey, just because you have a right to do something, doesn't mean you can't face consequences from the government for doing it."" --- Why yes. Yes it does.  As far as the shitheads ""controlling"" the scene, ALL THE EMT's HAD TO DO WAS IGNORE THIS GUY. That's literally all they had to do. Just like they ignored the other bystanders.

Bust into the house, and ignore going AROUND the house to check out the alleged fire for yourself. Makes total sense.   Also... the fire department could not respond to take care of the fires? Every fire department I have seen has at least two fire engines... were they BOTH tied up with major fires? One couldn't peel away to deal with another fire once that fire was reported?  Also... if they were responding to a fire, why bust into the house and start doing what's basically a SWAT raid on the occupants?

Do they notify them after the defendant enters a plea? Before they pay their ticket? When would be the best time to explain to someone that they received a citation from a known liar. I mean, lying is part of an officers job. they are all liars. And so is everyone else in the courtroom, including the defendant. But that doesn't mean they lie all the time.

When that behavior was pointed out to him he should have said ""I'm sorry, I was trying to get a picture of her name tag but I realize now that I got too close.  I apologize."" The security guard should not have grabbed his camera like that. Skidmore should not have started punching him like that. Once they were broken up and three feet apart, skidmore should not have gone back for more. Having gone back for more, the security guard should not have shot a firearm in a room like that.  He could have easily hit the guy in the yellow shirt right in the head. After that it's hard to tell WTF is going on.

Hi I'm <> with the Ohio County Sheriffs department, I'm seizing your camera as I believe it has evidence of a crime on it. Private Security loves to look like they are law enforcement. You have a lawful right in Ohio to protect yourself and your property with non-deadly force. When he moved in it is because the court security person had gone into a bladed stance and was drawing, as you could see by him missing, him going back in is what probably saved his life. It shouldn't have even been a draw situation, if he had the right retention holster, and having him outnumbered, bringing it out of a retention holster was either him A.

Security guard goes hands on with absolutely no proper escalation of force. Security grabs first then photographer raises level of force AGAIN with hard strikes. Sidearm never really needed to come out at all and its amazing that no one was actually hit. Once that sidearm is out now we are in deadly force territory. Absolutely absurd from both parties. Never escalate levels of force unless the other party does so first or you have no other choice. Id say that clearly both parties had several other choices, up until the firearm came out.  In the cameramans defense, the guard was holding and pulling on something around his neck, that can get scary.   In the guards defense repeated blows to the head while you're up against something and can't get away can also be scary.  However if you have the wherewithal to remember that you have a sidearm and pull it. You have the cognizance to yell for help, defend yourself and strike back. All without going deadly. Really seems like the guard had a rambo attitude from the beginning. That's something you can never do when you have deadly capabilities."

The fight to uphold rights and exposure government wrongdoing is oftentimes a long and slow fight and is never, in my experience, won in the heat of the moment.  Skidmore should have kept his hands to himself and then just let the camera footage do the talking.  Let the security officers be the ones acting in an unconstitutional manner.  I can only imagine if he tried to pull this craziness with actual cops, they would have shot him....repeatedly...and the footage would have backed up why it was a ""justified"" shooting.

The gov't will always win a fight that remains long and slow... they have unlimited funds, you don't they have hundreds of staff members following orders without a care in the world how it affects the country, you have yourself and maybe a small group of like minded people who try to speak up against them. Every major Civil Rights change in history had some incident that sparked the revolution off.   Rosa Parks refusing to move. Martin Luther nailing his 93 points to the door of the church. Boston Tea Party The various incidents and wars that spurred the creation of the Magna Carta (which the US Constitution is largely based off of)   The 200 years preceding the fall of the Roman Republic is FULL of major incidents that spurred men off their ass to make a change in their gov't, instead of fighting the long slow fight that history shows the gov't wins every time eventually.

SCOTUS now says that cops, and only cops, are allowed to use a ""reasonable mistake of law"" as a legal defense or a rebuttal to 4th amendment violations.   Yeah, that makes soooooo much sense. A police officer, who already has a heightened understanding of the law compared to a layperson, can use mistake of law, but not the rest of the less educated public. As a lawyer, I have a heightened understanding of the law, so why can't I be afforded the same protections as police since we are both servants to the legal system?

The trooper asked Joseph Lucio Jimenez if he had any weapons on him, and Jimenez said yes, a gun, according to the court's summary of the case. Without being asked, Jimenez then put his arms on the hood of the trooper's car so he could be handcuffed.   Also, this fool was stopped for jaywalking. LO FUCKING L."

His letter stated unequivocally that all citizens have that constitutional right under the 1st amendment and that his department would adhere to the U.S. Constitution and the State Constitution.

IV. Almost all police lie about whether they violated the constitution in order to convict guilty defendants.  V. All prosecutors, judges and defense attorneys are aware of rule IV.  VI. Many prosecutors implicitly encourage police to lie about whether they violated the constitution in order to convict guilty defendants.  VII. All judges are aware of rule VI.  VIII. Most trial judges pretend to believe police officers who they know are lying  IX. All appellate judges are aware of rule viii, yet many pretend to believe the trial judges who pretend to believe the police officers.  X. Most judges disbelieve defendants about whether their constitutional rights have been violated, even if they are telling the truth.  XI. Most judges and prosecutors would not knowingly convict a defendant who they believe to be innocent of the crime charged (or a closely related crime).  XII.

There is no justification for the government barring you from using whatever technology you want just to give them the power to spy on you later if they want to.

I served on a jury once, and it was an amazing experience. I was very lucky to have a number of intelligent, well spoken people in that box with me. Our case was pretty complicated, and we ended up hung up with two of our peers unable to agree after 4 days of deliberations.   I did make a friend from that experience - we still keep in touch. I don't know why so many people dread jury duty. Sure, I have a life, a job and a dog that missed me.

AmIFreeToGo,3cqsz9,davidverner,2,Fri Jul 10 17:43:45 2015 UTC,"David we considered that and almost executed the Motion; however, after extended consideration we decided not to for the following reason. When PINAC filed their appeal with the 1DCA and they kicked it back down to the Circuit Court (Where Chief Judge Mahon presides). So when it got back down to the lower court it was assigned as all cases are to the next Judge in rotation. Well, apparently Chief Judge Mahon did not want that Judge to get the case so he took it from her and re-assigned it to Judge Foster in Nassau who immediately denied the appeal. So, our fear was that although we felt Judge Shore was out of control, we feared that the Chief Judge Mahon was going to make sure any new assignment was even worse.

If you look up the case of Mark Schimdter and judge Melvin Perry, Orlando FL, you will see a case similar to yours.   As far as over ruling a defense lawyers objections and not allowing crucial evidence...a lot of that happened in the Ross Ulbricht trial.

AmIFreeToGo,3cqsz9,deathsmiled,5,Fri Jul 10 19:38:27 2015 UTC,IIRC the judge wouldn't allow the issue brought up of it being public property. There are times when a jury can vote not guilty because they believe the law is bad. It's called jury nullification.

AmIFreeToGo,3cqfrd,rrfan,5,Fri Jul 10 04:23:40 2015 UTC,Not what he did. His right to do so. Two different things.  And I'm talking about the cameraman.
AmIFreeToGo,3cqfrd,rrfan,0,Fri Jul 10 06:10:43 2015 UTC,"The constitution protects personal freedoms so far as they do not harm or infringe upon the rights and freedoms of another. In this case this woman has a right to her privacy, and the cameraman actions are infringing upon that. Quid pro quo, strawman red herring !!! Also I'm Canadian and we have Criminal Voyeurism which means You can not take photos of people who are in circumstances where they believe that they have a reasonable expectation of privacy, for example, a bathroom. This generally extends to include a person inside their own home, or anywhere where they have reason to believe is a private place. If you support this guys right to do what he did, you also support the right that pedophiles can film kids. Hence the constitution only protects rights that don't infringe on another. Freedom of speech does not mean hate propoganda is lawful."
AmIFreeToGo,3cqfrd,U_Gunna_Eat_That,2,Fri Jul 10 13:10:54 2015 UTC,"I've already responded to your similar comment above, but since you put it up again, I'll respond again:   Again, there is no right to privacy in public. I have no idea what ""Quid pro quo, strawman red herring"" means. Translated, would roughly be ""tit for tat, knockdown of false argument irrelevant point"" but I can't make that into anything I can understand. In Canada, this might not have been legal. It didn't happen in Canada. Even so, everything you list is a place where someone would have a reasonable expectation of privacy, pretty much the exact opposite of a public sidewalk.   As for protection of rights only that don't infringe on another, you haven't made the case here that the woman (or girl) had any Constitutional right violated.   And I've already responded to the point about pedophiles filming kids. Assume there is a pedophile in your neighborhood who has yet to be caught. Assume he is outside his home filming fully clothed children. How do you plan to stop this heinous activity?   Assume he's a convicted pedophile and must stay 500 feet away from children. Assume he's 500 feet away filming. How would you stop that?  What is hate propaganda? Run of the mill offensive speech, even if hateful (""Group X is a bunch of ignorant idiots and should be forced to move out of my area, and I hate them because of their skin color."") is not illegal.  According to http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/faq/frequently-asked-questions-speech, the only types of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment are as follows: Obscenity, Fighting words, Defamation (includes libel, slander), Child pornography, Perjury, Blackmail, Incitement to imminent lawless action, True threats, and Solicitations to commit crimes. You'll note that hate propaganda is not one of those categories."
AmIFreeToGo,3cqfrd,rrfan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:42:29 2015 UTC,"As a Canadian I assumed we would have the same rights so I'm completely wrong, sorry. Although she was on a sidewalk and you claim a public sidewalk is pretty much free game, up here we could easily argue that she has a right to privacy considering shes in a gurney and in some form of trauma. I know its not what we were arguing but Doesn't that seem fair? As to answer the question to what I would personally do to stop a pedophiles heinous activity, Id let canadian law figure it out."
AmIFreeToGo,3cqfrd,U_Gunna_Eat_That,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:48:55 2015 UTC,"So I doubt you can make the argument, even in Canada, that a person has an expectation of privacy on a sidewalk. Please note the term ""expectation of privacy"" is really a legal term. Does that person have a desire for privacy? Yes. But in the legal sense, they have no ""expectation of privacy"" even if they expect the situation to be private. That's probably a little bit confusing, but the difference matters.  As for whether it's fair, I suggest you think about the bigger picture here. Here's part of a comment I left elsewhere in this thread:  ""The risk that (insert random family member here) will at some point in their lives possibly be annoyed or embarrassed by a cameraman is so much smaller than the risk we all face if the government can tell us to stop filming things in public. We already see it from cops who demand we stop filming their bad/illegal behavior. If that were the norm, we could not capture things of public interest. And so, this being an imperfect world, we occasionally suffer from use of those rights offending someone else. Fortunately, there is no such thing as the right to not be offended, and so the world continues to spin.""  As for the pedophile, what you would expect Canadian law to do to stop a person performing a perfectly legal activity? Serious question. If you don't know he's a pedophile, you're not going to call the cops on him. So no one is going to stop him. Think about it: there's nothing that can be done."
AmIFreeToGo,3cqfrd,rrfan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:37:51 2015 UTC,"No you can't make that argument thats true but that's not what were talking about. What does reasonable expectation of privacy have to do with the government taking away the right to film in public?  I'd expect cops to check him out, let him know people think his activity is suspicious. If theyre a pedophile then they will most likely think twice about their actions."
AmIFreeToGo,3cqfrd,U_Gunna_Eat_That,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"If someone has a reasonable expectation of privacy on a public sidewalk, then it would be illegal to film them. And so the police could make someone stop filming (or arrest them) for doing so.  You said this:   Although she was on a sidewalk and you claim a public sidewalk is pretty much free game, up here we could easily argue that she has a right to privacy considering shes in a gurney and in some form of trauma.   Which implies that if she has a right to privacy, it would be illegal to film her. If there are situations in public where we can't film what's happening, that is incredibly easy for the police/government to abuse and stop us from filming other things they don't want.  You seem pretty reasonable. Embrace freedom. It's a little scary, but don't be afraid of it. It's way better than the alternative.  But you've missed the point on the pedophile. It's not like they go around with a nametag on that says ""pedophile"". I'm talking about a person walking around, say, an amusement park (maybe with their own kids) and filming. Something that is perfectly normal in that situation. There would be no complaint of anything suspicious, thus no cops going to talk to them, thus no stopping a pedophile from filming. It all started with a statement from you that if I supported the right of this cameraman to film this situation, I was also supporting the right of the pedophile to film children. Since I can't stop that situation, and in my estimation, the risk of that is lower than the risk to society of preventing all filming, I will choose the better of the two options. Neither is perfect, and both have upside and downside. I prefer the one with more upside and less downside."

If you can't detect the difference between someone performing a legal activity and battery, I'm not sure I can say anything that will allow you to see why one is right and one is wrong. Just remember, standing up for his rights protects you as well.  I also don't understand this ""shoving his camera in the woman's face"" bit. By my estimation, he never got closer than 5-6 feet from the woman. You're like the cops we've seen in videos that run up to someone filming and demand the person get the camera out of their face.

Completely illustrating what every cop on reddit denies. A class war. A desire to limit the rights of the public, and a desire to strengthen police power, and insulate them from scrutiny. They want police union officials to oversee all police oversight, They use the word ''overshadow'' in interesting ways. It is wonderful debate fodder to use with anyone who claims that cops are not out to rule with increased force and less oversight. The national FOP is against cameras unless THEY the union are in charge of the storage of data. A non-municipal biased group wants a role in the oversight. This is horrifying.

I also thank my LOVING wife and Son for their unwavering support.  Yesterday in this courtroom another devastating blow was taken by the U.S. Constitution and citizens rights. This devastating blow was manufactured by the very same men and women that we are told to rely on and trust to protect the very same freedoms that I was convicted for. The State has maliciously prosecuted me using TWO PROSECUTORS and TENS of THOUSANDS of tax dollars simply because I exercised my First Amendment right.  So let me recap. I,    a supposedly free man,    in a free country,    stand here today as a convicted criminal for simply HOLDING A SIGN CRITICAL of our GOVERNMENT and their AGENCIES all while standing on PUBLIC PROPERTY. This right is clearly protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, yet I was not even allowed to say that in court.   My friend and colleague Jeff Gray of Photography Is Not A Crime was confronted by the very same officers on a separate day and told that he was allowed to hold his sign that read FREEDOM OF SPEECH  and FREEDOM of EXPRESSION,   yet the Judge would not allow this testimony. Obviously this double standard between favorable speech about the government and that which is critical,   is what resulted in my conviction.  All for what…. refusing to follow an ILLEGAL command from a person we look to protect our rights and not violate them. This person is a person that we call a LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. This person is a person who like the Judge, and States Attorney TOOK an OATH to defend the U.S. Constitution and the Florida Constitution.    I want to take this opportunity to correct a statement that I made yesterday. After giving it a lot of thought, I have changed my mind. The question posed to me was “Would I do it again”. Well, I believe the more appropriate question is “Was it worth it”  To that question I unequivocally say no. However, let me make this clear. I would do it again for one simple reason, RIGHT and JUST do not change because of the severity of the consequences. I have learned through my life experiences that I cannot control others. If the Judge, States Attorney, and Law Enforcement Officers  want to violate their oaths and punish me for exercising my CONSTITUTIONAL rights, then so be it.  I do not consider this case a loss simply because I was convicted. I consider it a VICTORY and I am not remorseful. I have done my CIVIC duty and clearly exposed the blatant corruption of a system that we pretend is JUSTICE….  ***************FREEDOM IS NOT FREE**********************************"

A detective stealing a collar means He gets the arrest, and the vacation bonus, and not the cop who took the arrestee into custody to begin with. There's nothing more corrupt than a big city detective. Your connections have to go back generations to get in there, or you have demonstrated great earning skills and a lack of morals or ethics. So anyway: hidden bonuses for arrests. Border Control feds get them, see?

In just one train station in the Rochester area, the analysis identified 300 people who had a form of legal status and who were arrested and detained for hours before being released including: citizens, legal permanent residents, tourists, students with a visa, people with work visas, you name it.  Moreover, the study found evidence that the NUMBER of arrests is closely monitored by the authorities in the area, including breakdown by sectors and such, as to track who arrested more, etc. Even more interesting, Border Patrol officers are receiving cash bonuses and vacation awards and gift cards of up to 100 dollars.  The sums of this rewards in the area analyzed (Buffalo Sector) grew every year to over 200,000 dollars.'' http://www.pilarmarrero.com/border-patrol-getting-bonuses-and-vacation-awards-as-they-increase-number-of-arrests Found more!:  the North Lauderdale Police Department is engaging in an unusual incentive program that has unpleasant echoes of the past and the potential for abuse. The stated goal is admirable: Encourage greater vigilance and productivity by police officers in an effort to reduce crime. However, the technique - rewarding officers who rack up the most arrests - is questionable.'' ''Four months ago, Public Safety Director Carl Crisp began awarding officers points for each arrest - three for a misdemeanor and five for a felony. The two officers with the most points each month can choose their shifts for the next month. The two top-producing officers at the end of the year will get an extra vacation day and a commendation bar to wear on their uniforms.''

Keith Hughes said at the time the woman used good judgment by not stopping for the man.   He recommended drivers call 911 if they question who is attempting to pull them over and if unable to reach a dispatcher, acknowledge the officer by waving at them and then drive to a well-lit public location before stopping and tell the officer about your concern.    This reddit post has some officers responding in kind: https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1qp7ks/lpt_if_you_get_pulled_over_at_night_immediately/  Example:   Just an FYI, I'd do more than just hitting your hazards. What we always recommended to folks when we went through an imposter phase (they seem to occur about every 3-5 years) was that they activate their hazards, and reduce speed to 5-10 below the posted limit.   Also, make for the nearest PUBLIC space, not the nearest space you consider safe. You family compound may seem logical to you, and is only a block away, but rest assured, LE is going to feel differently about that versus your local Kwik-Sak.   Activate hazards, reduce speed, and head to the nearest public location. If that location is more than a block or two, call 911 and advise the dispatchers of your situation and intent.

How easily could this problem have been solved right on the spot (Sams parking lot) had the cop merely taken the time to assess the situation (i.e. did the kid try and take off or did he maintain a steady speed with his flashers on while signalling to the cop that he was going pull over).   Did the cop check the kids record and find out that he was dangerous criminal or that he was a law abiding citizen?  Was the cop chasing after someone he felt was a danger to society or was he after someone who had (potentially) committed an offense that would have resulted a ticket and a fine?  Did the cop even speak to the young man to get an explanation and then compare that explanation against the circumstances?  It seems to me that anyone with average intelligence and a sense of justice and fair play would have asked these (and possibly other) questions and come to the logical conclusion that a lecture and (at most) a traffic ticket were in order.

My wife has ""the right"" to ask me to stop on the way home to get a gallon of milk. I don't have to do it. You should reframe the question to ""When is a person required to show ID?""  In general, I think we need to get away from asking the question of ""Can cops ask for ID?"" I think we've already established they can ask, under pretty much any circumstance (consensual encounter, Terry stop, arrest, etc.). The real question at hand is ""When am I legally required to provide my identification (either verbally or via physical ID card)?"" (Obviously while driving, the balance leans towards (1) having to show ID rather than state one's name and DOB, and (2) that ID being a driver's license.)   As a more minor point, toward the end, you asked if someone could be arrested for violating 18.2-460. She said ""it depends"". Well, no, it doesn't depend. Not in the sense you were asking. She was answering that whether someone would be arrested depends on the circumstances, which is true. But the simple answer to your question is, yes, someone can be arrested for violating this. If they can be arrested under any set of circumstances, an arrest is possible. Some offenses should never result in an arrest (there are certain laws that state than an arrest is not allowed for violation of that particular law)."

Why not allow what was around from way before, when people just got married and then got a certificate from the state that just says it's a legal marriage.  In other words, common law marriage, or as it's known in some places, an informal marriage.    In Texas, you get married and then go to the county and fill out a declaration of informal marriage and are given a certificate so that you can prove you're married and get all the same benefits as getting a license from the state to do the same thing.  Marriage Licenses in Texas cost $60 and are only good for a certain amount of time.  Declaration of Informal Marriage (common law marriage) costs about $20 something to file and get the same results with no time constraints."

So, my main point is that to get a marriage license, you have to ask permission from the state to marry the person, and then the state has to grant that permission.  Why would anyone think the state should have a say in who they can and can not marry?  I believe it's a throwback to the days of segregation and such, but ultimately, it's all about permission.  I don't understand why people feel the need to have the state grant permission for something that they could do on their own and still have all the same benefits.  Am I wrong here?  Do people just not question this idea?    Here's one example (2009) of marriage licenses being proven to be a tool of the state to deny what should be undeniable.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/15/interracial-couple-denied_n_322784.html  With something like that, I really question the whole concept of marriage licensing in the first place."

(AP) -  Four Kentucky couples are suing a clerk who is refusing to issue gay-marriage licenses — or any marriage licenses at all — following the U.S. Supreme Court decision that same-sex couples have a legal right to marry.  Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis told The Associated Press that her Christian beliefs prevented her from complying with the decision, so she decided to issue no more marriage licenses to any couple, gay or straight.  The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky filed a federal lawsuit against her Thursday afternoon on behalf of four couples: two homosexual and two heterosexual couples who each tried to get licenses from Davis' office this week and were turned away.  Davis is among a handful of judges and clerks across the South who have defied the high court's order.

If victims want compensation, then they need to goto civil court. Therefore it would make more sense to leave the stuff with the criminal, then the victims can sue him in court. If the government takes all his stuff before, that would leave nothing for the victims.

DrHappyFunTime's argument that civil asset forfeiture which routinely targets drug offenders, should be allowed to keep the stuff purchased by selling drugs. For the specific reason that no theft occurred. It would be a typical transaction that both parties find acceptable.

If you want to dispute the merits of those laws that's a whole different subject.   What I'm saying is, if you're legitimately guilty of some crime, and you've profited off it, you shouldn't be allowed to keep said profit.   Cops should definitely not be allowed to just up and take money from people based on in rem jurisdiction, the whole idea of civil asset forfeiture is straight up theft, but the concept of criminal asset forfeiture makes a lot of sense.  So, instead of throwing the baby out with the bath water and abolishing all forfeiture laws, instead there should be specific restrictions on when it can be allowed. ie: There's a conviction, and there's proof the assets are the direct proceeds of the crime they were convicted of. Then, to go further, the funds should probably go to a general fund rather than directly lining the pockets of the police who make the arrest/seizure."

Your hallowed asset forfeiture bullshit is intimately linked to the illegal prohibition on drugs!   if you're legitimately guilty of some crime, and you've profited off it, you shouldn't be allowed to keep said profit...   Not if the crime is bullshit. The government has never had the authority to prohibit drugs. The only exception being alcohol when it had an amendment for it.   There's a conviction, and there's proof the assets are the direct proceeds of the crime they were convicted of. Then, to go further, the funds should probably go to a general fund rather than directly lining the pockets of the police who make the arrest/seizure.   Add that the crime has to be a legitimate crime and you might be onto something. Really, the assets should go directly to the victim(s), not the general fund.

Cops can't steal people's shit, because you need to be convicted of a crime first.

Hell, yes.  If you can prove in court that a LEO should have reasonably known that a law he arrested you for is no longer valid, you will win your court case.   I do agree, however, that most cops don't know the law as well as they should, and not nearly as well as they think they do.

Furthermore, while I don't believe for one moment that any reasonably intelligent U.S. citizen wouldn't be aware of the fact that SCOTUS ruled in Texas v. Johnson that burning the flag was protected under the First Amendment, I wouldn't doubt that a judge or jury would indeed determine that the LEO may not have reasonably known of that decision. Hell, they can't even find LEO's guilty of blatant abuse when it's caught on video.  How would they possibly conclude that the LEO should have reasonably known about the SCOTUS ruling, which was handed down in 1989? Some officers weren't even born yet and it hasn't exactly been headline news. More than likely they've heard their ilk spewing lies that it's illegal, like in this video!  My point is that once a law is determined to be unconstitutional there needs to be a mechanism in place to remove the law from the books without relying upon the legislators that more than likely put the law on the books in the first place. As the Slate article you shared detailed, that just doesn't happen."

AmIFreeToGo,3c8kwc,rondeline,18,Mon Jul 6 00:08:50 2015 UTC,Because the 5th Amendment protects him.  He's not required to say anything at all.  SCOTUS ruled years ago that remaining silent cannot be use for suspicion nor probable cause that a crime has been committed.

(Surely they have such training.  This is such an obvious situation that for it not to be part of standard police training is almost unthinkable.) Police confusion leads to police escalation leads to arrest? Scary!  Some people don't speak English. Other people don't want to speak to the cops. Other people have (stable) conditions where they can't speak. The cops should call an ambulance if they think there's a medical issue. Communication is not required, and escalation because of a lack of it is inappropriate.  Diabetic shock is generally visible.  Strokes are often visible.

The police don't like to be filmed because they're worried it will expose their wrongdoings. So whenever people are filming them, they intimidate or force them to stop. We see this all the time. But the reality is that it is perfectly legal to film in public. So, this guy went out and stood across the street, on a public sidewalk, and filmed police and their activities, until he got a response. And you see what happened next. There are a few reasons to actually go out and do this. 1 is that he's an activist, and wanting to make it aware to as many people as possible that filming is a protected right. 2 he's putting himself in situations to have his rights violated so that he can sue for monetary gain. 3 he realizes that videos like this are sought out for in places like this subreddit, and wants to earn an income through the views and subscriptions on his YouTube channel.

There's a lot of good case law in Virginia that to obstruct an officer you have to go beyond merely failing to cooperate.  Virginia's Attorney General wrote an advisory opinion in 2002 that refusing to identify yourself does not constitute Obstruction. Here's the link.  Here's a quote from the VA Supreme Court case law from the AG's opinion. I think this is from Jones v. Commonwealth but I'm not 100% because they omitted the citation.   [T]here is a broad distinction between avoidance and resistance or obstruction.… To constitute obstruction of an officer in the >performance of his duty, it is not necessary that there be an actual or technical assault upon the officer, but there must be acts clearly indicating an intention on the part of the accused to prevent the officer from performing his duty, as to ‘obstruct’ ordinarily implies opposition or resistance by direct action.… It means to obstruct the officer himself not merely to oppose or impede the process with which the officer is armed."

I had 2 cameras rolling, my cell phone and body camera I was wearing around my neck. I also had an audio recorder in my pocket, but that audio is kind of shoddy. They turned off everything but my body camera as soon as they arrested me, and the A/V from that is terrible because it was sitting on the cop car a ways away from me. Both officers had body and dash cams, so we will see if they conveniently come up missing in discovery.  I have already preserved all the footage from my cameras on multiple DVD's, so it cannot be tampered with. Tomorrow I will distribute them across multiple geographic locations so if there is a fire or something the video isn't lost."

As for the call I'm still practicing my approach in this area and going in with with minor knowledge of the event will help in future calls where I encounter this could happen.

[T]here is a broad distinction between avoidance and resistance or obstruction.… To constitute obstruction of an officer in the performance of his duty, it is not necessary that there be an actual or technical assault upon the officer, but there must be acts clearly indicating an intention on the part of the accused to prevent the officer from performing his duty, as to ‘obstruct’ ordinarily implies opposition or resistance by direct action.… It means to obstruct the officer himself not merely to oppose or impede the process with which the officer is armed."

In the video I saw it starts in the middle of an encounter with an officer asking to see someone's ID. Since it wasn't rolling before this we don't know if the cop had RAS to detain or ask to see ID, but he was asking to ID the person. The cop looked at the name, didn't even have to run it, and pulled out his cuffs seconds after seeing the ID.   I see that situation as the cop was looking for this person for some reason, maybe a warrant, maybe he just committed a crime and was identified, maybe he recently committed a crime and was wanted, we don't know because it started recording in the middle of the encounter. What we see is the officer told him he was under arrest and he resisted. The officer should not have tried to fight him on his own, that was stupid, but so is resisting arrest. You aren't going to win that fight on the side of the street, you win it in court if it is an illegal arrest/detainment.   This is exactly what someone shouldn't do if being arrested. We can't know anything about this situation because all we see is him resisting an arrest. This shouldn't be on this sub imo because I don't see what rule on the sidebar it falls under.

Meaning just staying silent CAN be used against you because the courts will assume that if you didn't defend yourself against accusations against you then there must be some truth to them and therefore your silence is RAS...

I do like Jeff Gray's approach in all instances though... ""I am a journalist gathering content for a story, I have no ill will or intent."" Then start your silent treatment.

Loitering or prowling   (a) A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.  (b) Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this Code section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this Code section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.  (c) A person committing the offense of loitering or prowling shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  (d) This Code section shall not be deemed or construed to affect or limit the powers of counties or municipal corporations to adopt ordinances or resolutions prohibiting loitering or prowling within their respective limits.

AmIFreeToGo,3c4pw3,NeonDisease,6,Sat Jul 4 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"The real crime is someone stole all the paragraphs.    LAFAYETTE – A woman who claims she was falsely arrested by officers of the Crowley Police Department for videotaping them on two occasions claims her civil rights were violated.   Theresa Richard filed suit against Kelly P. Gibson, individually and in his official capacity as police chief of the Crowley Police Department; Scott Fogelman, individually and in his official capacity as a lieutenant for the Crowley Police Department; Skeat Thibodeaux, individually and in his official capacity as a police officer for the Crowley Police Department and the City of Crowley in U.S. District Court Western District of Louisiana on Dec. 12, 2014.   Richard claims that on Dec. 1, 2013 she entered the lobby of the Crowley Police Department located at 426 North Ave. F in Crowley with her camera recording and was told by Lieutenant Fogelman that she should not put the video on Facebook. The plaintiff contends that when asked what would happen if she did post the video Lieutenant Fogelman said “do it and find out what happens.” Richard claims she asked if Lieutenant Fogelman was threatening her and he asked she leave the building, but when she asked why she had to leave she claims her camera was seized and she was placed under arrest for trespassing.   The plaintiff allege that she made a complaint of false arrest and the charge was dismissed on Dec. 23, 2013. Richard alleges this video was captured during and before the Dec. 1, 2013 arrest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-ZBRPUzyGU   In another incident that occurred on May 28, 2014 Richard alleges she was at her neighbor’s home who had called the police to report that he was being harassed from other neighbors and that when officer Thibodeaux arrived she attempted to video record the interaction on her cell phone at which time she was told by Thibodeaux that video taping was prohibited. The plaintiff claims that Thibodeaux told her to get in her car and remain in the vehicle until the interaction was finished. However, Richard contends that she told Thibodeaux she could not adequately record the interaction from her vehicle and that she would exercise her first amendment rights by remaining at a distance so as not to interfere in the interview. However, the plaintiff asserts that Thibodeaux then placed her under false arrest for interfering with a law enforcement investigation and public intimidation, both charges which were later dismissed.   Richard alleges the video below is from the May 28, 2014 arrest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jOBU8_JdNE   Richard further claims that neither Fogelman or Thibodeaux are actually employees of the Crowley Police Department because they were improperly hired and were thus guilty of impersonating police officers when they arrested her. The defendants are accused of violating the plaintiff's constitutional rights as provided by the 1st and 14th amendments, intimidation and engaging in cruel and degrading treatment.   An unspecified amount in damages is sought for civil rights violations, mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, embarrassment, humiliation, negligent issuing of police equipment including firearms and identification, punitive damages and attorney’s fees.   The plaintiff is represented by attorney L. Clayton Burgess of Lafayette. The case has been assigned to U.S. Federal Judge Richard T Haik Sr. Case no. 6:14-cv-03439."

As for picking a parking location to save yourself some trouble park on the public easement which can be part of the drive way.  You will want to learn the easement distance from the road for the areas you plan on stalking around on if you plan on puling into various driveways to do safe filming.  I personally would of just parked on the side of the road.  As for the trespass game generally it has to be owner or manager of the property who trespasses you or have pre-posted signage stating people aren't allowed there.  The only way around this is for the department to have a prearranged agreement with the owner and/or manager of the property.  Keep in mind you will want to check your local and state laws on trespassing because there can be a lot of gotchas in the wording such as only needing one sign that could be in an obscure location.
AmIFreeToGo,3c6d54,davidverner,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:28:00 2015 UTC,"Whenever I see something I film it, but honestly the cops in my county have learned the game when it comes to civil rights. They don't even engage photographers anymore other than saying hello, and people around here don't even bat an eye at open carry. So I don't post 99% of the footage I take. Maybe I'll post a ""how it should happen"" video next time I film something to show how well they handle things here. Henrico got sued a few years back and ever since they wizened up.  There have been some stories out of the surrounding counties about rights violations so I am expanding my work out there.  My intent last night was actually to document some checkpoints and try the ""fair DUI flyer"" here. The problem is that the police don't annouce their checkpoints ahead of time so you have to find them by watching Waze for slowdowns and reports of police, which can be hit or miss.   I posted earlier the statue that regards trespass in cemeteries here. They don't have to be posted apparently, the easement here was a sharp ditch so it was not really safe to park. The way I see it, if they can use the cemetery driveway for revenue generation then I should be able to park their to document it."

AmIFreeToGo,3c2786,DrHappyFunTime,2,Sun Jul 5 20:15:20 2015 UTC,"do you know what the definition of a phobia is?   Yes. Here is what Google.com says and I will highlight the important bits for you:   A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder, usually defined as a persistent fear of an object or situation in which the sufferer commits to great lengths in avoiding, typically disproportional to the actual danger posed, often being recognized as irrational.   Let me reiterate the disproportional to the danger posed and OFTEN recognized as irrational.   why would seeing an armed man carrying a rifle, and wearing a tactical vest stuffed with magazines and being fearful be considered a phobia?   The danger is disproportionate to the danger you feel the situation presents. I say feel it presents because you are obviously confusing your wrong feelings with thought. Why else would you assess the danger incorrectly?   i'd consider it reasonable   And you'd be wrong. That is why they're OFTEN seen as irrational. Idiots like you who let their feelings get in the way of rational thought can't see the truth. Could he up and start shooting people? Sure, if the gun is real and he's a psycho and he wants to kill and that is how he chooses to kill and he chooses that day to kill. Is it wrong to acknowledge that possibility? No. That is why I don't have a problem with it being your first thought. I do have a problem if you think your first thought is the right one simply because it is first. The fact that there are a plethora of more likely scenarios and you're harping on a very unlikely one is what makes you wrong. If you were rational, I would have expected you to realize that from my first comment. That media conditioning and paranoia is pretty strong stuff though. Good luck!"

Edit: It seemed like they weren't sure about having PC to search from the get go... otherwise they would have been tearing the car apart long before the supervisor showed up.

And if they do not leave in a timely manner the cops are to be called and they are to be trespassed. It is sad that many people do not know this. Many people think a parking lot of a business is public property. They can photograph from outside the property, but not on the property if security/management doesnt want it.  Edit: I always explained how it worked to people who I told they had to leave. I believe that it is how it should be done. Too many security and police just shout orders. And not explain to people the law and the reasons why they cannot do this or that (when safe to do so).  That blueshirt (was he security?) didnt handle it right at all.

I suspect that the action was taken with no real thought other than to show support for the other mods.  I believe that shutting down the subreddit with no real consideration was a poor decision.

Because it's becoming glaringly obvious that cops and prosecutors just love to interpret silence as a tacit admission of guilt, and the courts are all too happy to go along with it.   You have the right to refuse to answer any of my questions, but you must explicitly invoke that right.  Any answers you give may be used against you in court.  Absent an explicit invocation of your right to refuse to answer questions, your SILENCE may be used against you in court.  You have the right to consult with an attorney...

In the US, police are actively looking for crime, and because of this, everyone is a potential suspect for some potential crime. We are never given the benefit of the doubt. It's logically fucked up.   Example:  (I had made the following comment earlier on another post, but it applies here and I don't feel like typing much more.)  I used to study in Munich and talked with police almost daily. Being a foreigner who didn't speak German, I'd ask for directions or tips on favorite restaurants.. etc. Even when I was drunk off weisbier, they were always willing to give me a hand or help me find my way home. All that time and not once was I searched or asked for ID.  The job of a police officer is to help people, not actively search for crime."

A lot of the founding fathers were merely kids with a voice.   Cops don't realize the second amendment is not just to defend yourself from a violent criminal, but to defend yourself against tyranny, which is exactly what happens when public entities turn private. How in the fuck does our government not see a major red flag by allowing the police to investigate themselves? It's like if McDonald's hired their own health inspectors.   People need to read more.

He tries every passive-aggressive, good cop-bad cop psychological trick he knows (and he's pretty good) but ultimately he's respectful of the videographer's rights. He even tries to de-escalate the situation when LEO's arrive. The LEO's start to get hyped but he interjects and de-escalates the situation, saving the photographer from a likely detention.

He can issue an arrest warrant pursuant to a case, but he can't create a charge out of thin air relating to people only tangentially connected to a case (ie. media reporting on a court case outside the courthouse).

Let the Judge find out the hard way what happens when he tries to introduce laws (particularly unconstitutional laws) when he doesn't have the authority to do so.   For that matter, he's ""instructing"" the defense to not mention the !st amendment or the fact that the Defenses client was in a public place when filming... why doesnt the Defense ignore this, run the best defense he can for his client and if the Judge takes any BS action, just call for a mistrial (hostile judge not admitting admitable evidence and reasonable defense arguments) ?

You have people like me who are close to the boarder line of nothing left to loose which makes up a very small fraction of the population.  Then you got the rest of the people out their who have something important to them that they have to protect and being in jail jeopardizes their ability to protect whats important to them, namely family.

I mean, I'm a family man with a job and plenty to loose.  I'm also not a lawyer or terribly familiar with a Judges authority within the court room... so I wouldn't try to ""push the point"" when it comes to making a defense the Judge has prohibited even if I ""think"" it's a wrong order.  However if I lived nearby, I'd have no hesitation in walking to the sidewalk across the road, filming, and making them ""either fuck off or arrest me"" when they cite the Judges ""instruction"" that no-one film from that location.  Sure I'd get locked up, loose my job and my Family would have to do without a Father and Husband for a while...

Dennis Hastert (former big shot for republicans, speaker of the house) was just indicted on charges that essentially stem from him hiding that he took out about 3 million dollars, of his own money, and paying someone to keep a secret. He was paying someone hush money. When he was taking out the money he didn't want to draw lots of attention so he kind of ""concealed"" some of his money movements, which is against the law.   You are not allowed to move large amounts of money with the specific intent of keeping it ""hidden"" from the government. When anyone has a transaction that is over 10K dollars, the bank must notify the feds. When the investigators came to question him about all the funny activity, he could have just said ""yup, I took out all that money to pay someone 3.2 million dollars to keep a secret"" and he would have been off the hook, he would have been in no legal trouble. Instead he further tried to conceal his financial transactions and hide what he was doing with what money and was subsequently indicted.   This is less to prevent something from happening if the economy collapses and more to prevent trafficking/illegal monetary gains or material support for illegal activities. Besides, if you think about it logically, if our economy collapsed our money would be worthless anyway so there would be no need to come up with ways of preventing people from moving money that was worthless."

I never thought it was really that big of a deal.   The only thing that ever really surprised me was my first Christmas bonus. It was the same size as my normal check. When he handed it to me, in cash, I thought I was being fired. Couldn't quite figure it out. Dude was a ""devout"" christian. He actually tried to live a good life. He helped me out with lots of things. Even now I stop by to visit him and work for free for an hour or so while visiting with him.   One time we had a foster-father come in to pawn his tools to try and get more presents for the children in his care. The state only provided $12 per child and he needed to do more for the kids than that. The owner just gave him $500 and told him to have a Merry Christmas. Wouldn't take any of his tools on pawn. His wife was another matter. She was very pleasant and nice, but protested non-christian/anti-christian things. Her big cause when I joined the team was trying to get the schools to ban the first three Harry Potter books (Others weren't out yet). I ended up leaving that job to join the ARMY after 9/11.

To put in perspective our shop would only carry $150K cash between the 3 tellers and cash safe at once. The larger shops across the street would carry around $500K between registers and cash safe. Some of the biggest shops in town could generate in a month what we would generate in a year.   Every business has different requirements for entry. Pawnshops have some the craziest requirements. Because of it, it is essentially a rich man's business. Your personal total liquidatable assets, determine how much you are allowed to take in on loan as a business. The shop I was at was only 3 years old when I joined, compared to all the other shops that were around for generations. Hell, one of them had so much gold defaulting each week, it was cheaper for him to get his own 1 kilo bar press. The other shops also had the ability to cater to people much richer than I will ever be. They had certain employees that would drive out to the estates to do transactions at the people's houses. The largest transaction I ever got to see, was for $6M. It was for 3 paintings and an airplane. It was more than what we could afford to give out, and so one of the much larger shops took it."

AmIFreeToGo,3bsx27,HurricaneSandyHook,6,Wed Jul 1 21:52:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, completely legal. That being said; traffic laws are provincial, so it might not necessarily be all of Canada (but I wouldn't be surprised). Ontario definitely allows it.  That being said, this is not practised often, as when you run the plates you'll get some particulars of the owner, as well as their licence status... so the only time anyone really does this is when the driver doesn't really look like the described owner (45 year old male owner... driver looks way younger than that)... at that point it might be necessary to actually pull them over to make sure they're licensed."
AmIFreeToGo,3bsx27,HammerPoPo,3,Wed Jul 1 23:19:46 2015 UTC,this is legal? how does it not violate section 9 of the constitution act?  Detention or imprisonment 9. Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.   (45 year old male owner... driver looks way younger than that)... at that point it might be necessary to actually pull them over to make sure they're licensed.   yeah because no one has ever used some ones car legitimately in the history of the automobile.
AmIFreeToGo,3bsx27,BauxiteBeard,3,Wed Jul 1 23:35:46 2015 UTC,"I can only quote Ontario here (I'm sure the other provinces will be more or less in line)... but the Highway Traffic Act anyone driving a car must have on them a license, registration (or true copy of it), and proof of insurance, and must surrender it to police on request. It also authorizes police to stop vehicle to check for those documents. Having these documents on you is seen as important enough that stopping someone to check for them is not ""arbitrary"".  Unlike the states, driving in Ontario is seen as a huge privilege... you're licensed by the province to drive on the province's roads, so you have to play by the province's rules.  That being said, there is a lot of case law around it. Very few cops will use this as an ""in"" if they're following a car that they suspect of being involved in something major, because you'll get scrutinized in court about whether or not it really was a random check, or if you were targeting someone. The only times I ever do it is when I actually do think the person is unlicensed (they look too young, or if I recognize them as someone who didn't have a license a couple weeks ago, etc).  edit: as for your bit about people using cars legitimately... if I change that statement to the opposite, it can still be true. I can find a suspended driver sitting literally right in front of me at least once a shift without even hunting for it."

Or call him while you're in your car and I'm writing up your ticket. I don't care.  If you completely refuse to identify yourself and instead ask for a lawyer and habeas corpus, I would say ""no"", warn you that if you don't comply you'll be arrested, and if you still refuse, then I'd arrest you under the authority of the Highway traffic act (failing to ID is arrestable) until I can verify who you are. This is not a criminal code arrest though. You can talk to your lawyer when you're back at the station in custody as I can't provide you with the necessary privacy after you've been arrested and placed in the cruiser.

Once I arrest you though, I have to provide you with the privacy to call a lawyer.   And case law already dictates that ""without delay"" is still dependent on several factors. For starters, your call has to be private. I can't provide you with that privacy after I've put you in hand cuffs until we are back at the station. It's also the only way I can make sure you're talking to a lawyer and not just some random friend. If I go to court and the judge asks me ""did you allow him to speak to a lawyer without delay?"", I will answer ""yes, as soon as we were at the station I personally contacted his lawyer, then put him on a private line"". You don't have the right to call a random friend, and I'm allowed to take measures to make sure that you do actually call a lawyer."
AmIFreeToGo,3bsx27,HammerPoPo,3,Thu Jul 2 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"okay but what about the writ? I can't see that one being common at all.  I don't have access to lexisnexis anymore :/ and I can't find applicable case law on canlii.  I love law, spend hours every day reading about it, combing threw case law, most of the things I want to try do not get used in court so I would have to do it myself, and unlike most people I like rides."
AmIFreeToGo,3bsx27,BauxiteBeard,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:37:40 2015 UTC,"the writ, to dumb it down, is basically proof that the person you're dealing with has the authority to do what they're doing. The best way this applies practice is that if you're stopped by someone claiming to be an undercover cop, you have the right to ask for proof of their authority (Police ID, a warrant card).  As a uniformed officer, my shiny car, uniform and badge are my proof. If this isn't good enough for you, then you can challenge it in court,and if whatever I did is deemed to have been outside of my authority, then you can get the case tossed out. But with regards to a traffic stop, this would happen after the stop.  I admire your passion for the law, but I find that the thing that trips most people up (including police officers... we're not all-knowing) is that they memorize law without also paying attention to how case law determines proceedings, and without looking at how their requests would affect the court system. Our justice system is not a machine; it's people who have to work 40 hours a week and make the best of it while being fair and using common sense."

I think most my battles need to be fought in court and likely will all be about semantics, and after the fact, It for example it says    C.    to have the validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful.   says I am to be released, if the detention is not lawful. so lets say you pull me over I ask for my rights as outlined in the constitution, I give you my information then just say nothing else, lets say in this scenario, you say you caught me in a traffic infraction and then write me a ticket and then drive off without allowing me to seek counsel or a writ(as you say their are some requirements such as privacy).  at this point I would indeed fight it, lets say the whole thing is recorded, were my rights not violated then? I have the right to counsel(you said before the judge would ask you to prove that you gave me counsel I could claim/prove you never gave me that right at the side of the road) and I have the right to seek a writ of HC, because those things are not commonly requested during a traffic stop or other detentions should not make them any less effective or valid just because its at the side of the road I still have the right to be released if the detention is invalid, if you just drive off the detention was never proved valid or invalid, I was never able to seek counsel when I had the right to at this point Id feel like it was a constitutional violation but...semantics, I just may have to blaze a few trails."
AmIFreeToGo,3bsx27,BauxiteBeard,2,Thu Jul 2 01:37:28 2015 UTC,"on your edit, so when you are looking at the age of the driver its not a random stop, you are using a hunch or guess that they don't own that car.   how is this not a direct violation of   Proceedings in criminal and penal matters            Any person charged with an offence has the right d.  to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;    arnt you just presuming that they are not legitimately in that car because of age/sex or whatever else the car might be registered to? and now force them to prove they are innocent?"
AmIFreeToGo,3bsx27,BauxiteBeard,2,Thu Jul 2 00:16:05 2015 UTC,"first, keep in mind I said that's just my own personal use of the law... if I wanted to drive down a street and pull over 50 cars one after the other, I can. But I have better things to do. So I save it for something that I think actually needs it.  If someone looks too young to be driving, then yes it's a hunch or a suspicion, or however you want to word it... but for me it's a good reason to check.  Getting pulled over under the Highway traffic act is not a ""criminal"" proceeding. You don't need the same standards on provincial offences (liquor, trespassing, driving, insurance, etc) as you do in criminal offences like assault or theft.   Even if I wasn't allowed to just check every driver's licence, I only need reasonable grounds to charge someone under a Part I Provincial Offence... so, hypothetically speaking, if I saw someone who looks like they're 15 driving a car, that's reasonable grounds to stop them because you can't have a license at 15. But I don't need reasonable grounds to pull you over so it doesn't matter."

That's modern day bastardization of policing. The reason the public is getting fed up with law enforcement, is because of what they've been set up to do in the manner they go about doing it.

AmIFreeToGo,3bpkub,OTSProspect,0,Thu Jul 2 06:01:44 2015 UTC,"I've responded to you numerous times debunking every case you supply each time you post this and you continue to ignore it.   I guess I'll prove you wrong yet again by copying and pasting my last few responses.  Why don't you link relevant, more recent cases?    It's especially interesting since it seems your argument is that there is a difference between ""driving"" and ""traveling"", and you link a RI SC case where they clearly mention your definition of ""driving"" in the quote you linked.  If they are doing it ""as a necessary adjunct to the earning of a livelihood"", then they are a ""driver"" under your logic.  Would that not be regulating commerce?  And would that not be acceptable under your definition?  That case also says:   Whatever may be its nature, the right to use the public highways for travel by motor vehicles is one which properly can be regulated by the legislature in the valid exercise of the police power of the state.   But the most important thing about that case that you linked is here:     It is our opinion that the provisions of the act requiring the registry to suspend licenses and to determine the amount of security to be deposited to avoid suspension does not constitute a delegation of judicial power so as to be repugnant to the constitutional prohibition.  The complainant's appeal is denied and dismissed, the decree appealed from is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings.   So they did not side with the guy who said ""Nah I don't need a license"", they sided with the state who says he does.  I guess you missed that somehow.  You also linked a case that linked a different case last.  Could you not find Adams v. City of Pocatello?  In the case in which you quoted (STATE v. WILDER), he has the same argument that you have:   Before trial, he moved to dismiss the charge, asserting that the Idaho Transportation Department had denied him a driver's license because he would not disclose a social security number.   Wilder argued that the denial of a driver's license deprived him of his right to travel, which he characterized as “an inalienable right given by God.” The magistrate denied the motion.   Wilder thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the charge for lack of jurisdiction, contending that “he is not subject to any Court wherein the Supreme law of the land cannot be argued or applied in his defense.”   The magistrate implicitly denied this motion by proceeding with a jury trial and, following a guilty verdict, entering a judgment of conviction.   Wilder appealed to the district court, which affirmed the conviction.   Wilder now appeals to this Court, asserting that the magistrate court erred in denying his two dismissal motions.    The court's opinion, again, disagrees with the complainant and sides with the state:   The requirement that drivers be licensed before operating motor vehicles on the streets and highways of this state promotes public safety and order by requiring that vehicle operators meet minimal standards for knowledge of the rules of the road and driving competence.   It is reasonable, in furtherance of that objective, for the state to employ means to verify the identity of license applicants, such as the use of social security numbers ... We are likewise of the view that the requirement that an applicant divulge a social security number in order to obtain a driver's license is a legitimate exercise of the state's police power.   We hold that the magistrate did not err by exercising jurisdiction in this misdemeanor proceeding, nor by holding that the requirement that Wilder provide his social security number in order to obtain a driver's license did not violate his right to travel.   The judgment of conviction is therefore affirmed.    So in 2 of your own cited cases you are proven wrong.  I didn't even really review the other two much.  And I could go into actual SCotUS cases like Arizona v. Gant where he was arrested for driving without a license.  If you read it you'll note that the SCotUS had no problem with his arrest for this whatsoever (the search after his arrest was a different story, though).  Now go ahead and link the Chicago Motorcoach case which as far as I can tell is completely fictional since nobody has ever been able to provide a case briefing that is not from a BS sovereign citizen website."

Also, there have been Congressmen to uphold the body of this letter and did their own research into the matter.   Arizona State Senator responds   Pennsylvania State Representative also chimes in    I know many will say ""That's just Sovereign Citizen bullshit"" but the SC movement has many points in which they are completely correct... And this is one of them. By signing the paperwork to get a Drivers License, you are abdicating your Right to travel in an automobile for the Privilege to drive that automobile and allow the gov't to regulate it.  I am not saying that people aren't beholden to safety laws like speed limits or safety inspections on the car, far from it (at this point in the argument at least) I am merely saying that you DO have the Right to drive a car, and cannot be required to get a license to do so.  You know why they allow License/Permits for Conceal Carry of a firearm? Not a single case I know of says you have a Right to conceal, they specifically say that you do NOT have this Right, therefore they are allowed to regulate and ban as they see fit.  But we have TONS and TONS of cases that say you DO have a Right to drive... so how can they justify requiring a license to exercise a Right?

Edit: also, the reason I flipped the argument is that I personally believe that every Right should be held to the same standard... if someone makes an argument against one Right then the test is to apply it equally to all Rights. If the argument can be made successfully when applied to all Rights then it can move forward."

Also, what would there be to stop them from going from never having driven a vehicle in their life, to just deciding to start doing it one day?  There are legal requirements for the purchase of firearms and alcohol because that is also something that must be used responsibly.

AmIFreeToGo,3bpkub,HurricaneSandyHook,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"I understand your arguments, however I believe if you look a little further into them you might reconsider.  Let's take a look starting at the end.   There are legal requirements for the purchase of firearms and alcohol because that is also something that must be used responsibly.   I know of no regulation/legal requirement for me to do anything if I want to sell you a gun, or if I want to buy one from you.     Also, what would there be to stop them from going from never having driven a vehicle in their life, to just deciding to start doing it one day?   The answer is nothing.  But that's how it works anyways.  Everyone starts with zero experience.  And it's a simple skill to learn.     Say the person who doesn't believe they need a DL also doesn't believe they need to insurance.   Well, this is a question about financial responsibility and it only matters when an accident occurs.  And there are major philosophical points within this one.  I've also seen some states have laws which say if you have enough money you don't have to have auto insurance, most people don't fall into that category.... But the point of insurance is to pay someone for whatever damages you might incur on them or their property.     Something like driving can take on a greater and differing meaning though because you are literally using something where you put other peoples lives and well-being at risk every day.   This is true in a sense but I'll try to use an example where licenses are not required like photography, yet rules of the road apply which ties this whole thing together.    Sailing.  There is no law that requires me to have a license to sail a boat.  I can have the biggest boat known to man, and sail it without a license.  And it doesn't have to be a sailboat, it can be a motor boat.  I can take that thing all over the waterways and be just fine and dandy without a license.  I don't have to have insurance either.  And yet there is always the possibility that I can kill multiple people, destroy thousands and thousands of dollars of property, and just be a general nuisance.  Yet still no license required.  I can go very fast in a power boat.  I don't even think there are speed limits for most waterways, definitely not for the oceans.  There are rules of the road for boats, telling you who has right of way, when to pass, no wake areas, etc.  And boaters do fine with these rules without licenses.  I think the laws we have for driving should be more like the ones we have for boating.    Oh, and the only people who have to have licenses for sailing, are those who do it commercially."

If I were to have a team of three working on building a case before I need their help in court will cost about $12,000+ per week to have them work a 40 hour work week on just my research effort."
AmIFreeToGo,3bpkub,Myte342,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:24:05 2015 UTC,"You could, if you wanted, do this right now with VERY little risk.  Keep your license, and next time you get pulled over, just act like you don't have one.  Get the ticket.  You might get taken to jail too, but it'll be easy and low cost to set bail.  Then go to court, and fight it.  I'd probably put in writing something about having the license hidden within some motion to dismiss.   Lower court judges rarely read them.  But that way it's in the record for when you need to appeal and you can point directly to that if you want the higher court to throw it out... but even then, you don't have to. Really though, if you actually didn't have a license, and lost the court case, the fine is pretty small.  It's low risk... unless your black.  Then I wouldn't suggest any of this."

They cannot, they completely skirt around the issue and hope that We, the People, don't realize it...   Except there really aren't.  Nearly every case that the ""right to drive"" is cited for does not state that you can do so without restrictions or licenses.  It is not a fundamental right.  See my response to /u/CaptainRob in this thread for examples of that.  The quotes are antiquated, cherry picked, and there are more recent cases which prove them wrong.    This case is cited in the link you provided:   Case # 1 - ""Even the legislature has no power to deny to a citizen the right to travel upon the highway and transport his property in the ordinary course of his business or pleasure, though this right may be regulated in accordance with the public interest and convenience. -Chicago Motor Coach vChicago 169 NE 22  (""Regulated"" here means traffic safety enforcement, stop lights, signs, etc. NOT a privilege that requires permission i.e.- licensing, mandatory insurance, vehicle registration, etc.)    I've searched far and wide through numerous case briefing databases and all over the internet and the only mention I could ever find of this is this exact quote and show up on sovereign citizen type websites which have no credibility whatsoever.  If the case does exist, I'm wondering who actually added their own definition of ""regulated"" in there because it certainly has no legal justification to it.  It's the same situation with Thompson v Smith 154 SE 579.  Not a single reputable source that I can find.  Meanwhile, if you search for Arizona v. Gant, you'll find dozens of credible sources with links so that you can examine the entire case.  This is important because one quote alone does not mean anything without context behind it.  I can go quote the dissent from any Supreme Court case that says the opposite of what the ruling was, and it will undoubtedly be from that case...but it is not legally binding.  Also, in Arizona v. Gant, you'll note that the Supreme Court allowed the arrest of a man for driving without a license (the search of his vehicle afterwards was not legal, however) and had no issue with it.    The two cases after that:   Case # 3 - ""The right to travel is a part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the 5th Amendment."" -Kent v Dulles, 357U.S. 116, 125.  Case # 4 - ""Undoubtedly the right of locomotion, the right to remove from one place to another according to inclination, is an attribute of personal Iiberty, and the right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the territory of any State is a right secured by the l4th Amendment and by other provisions of the Constitution."" - Schactman v Dulles, 96 App D.C. 287, 293.    Sure, sounds good to me.  But again, out of context.  These cases have absolutely nothing to do with driving.  At least the first one does.  Can't find anything on the second one.     ""A license when granting a privilege, may not, as the terms of its possession, impose conditions which require the abandonment of constitutional rights."" Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Commission, 271, US 583, 589, (1924); Terral v. Burke Construction Company, 257 US 529, 532 (1922).   This concerns a business license.   ""The acceptance of a license, in whatever form, will not impose upon the licensee an obligation to respect or to comply with any provision of the statute or with the regulations prescribed that are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States."" W. W. CARGILL CO. v. STATE OF MINNESOTA, 180 U.S. 452 (1901) 180 U.S. 452    Again, business license.  And this case is from 1901.   The case of Hertado v.California, 110U.S. 516. states very plainly: ""The State cannot diminish rights of the people.""    This quote is not in the case anywhere I can see.  And it concerns the grand jury.    I'm not even going to continue.  There's no point in looking up every case to show that they are irrelevant."

AmIFreeToGo,3bpkub,HurricaneSandyHook,5,Wed Jul 1 10:42:49 2015 UTC,"California specifically has ""dual purpose"" checkpoints.  Sobriety/DL.  It may have something to do with their state Constitution.  Most other states have a specific main scope for the checkpoints they are conducting.  It will usually say sobriety or dui on a sign as you enter it and they don't ask for your DL.  However, more and more videos are popping up of other states employing these multiple point checkpoints and that is of some questionable legality that I imagine will end up in the courts.  Interestingly, some states simply conduct ""safety checkpoints"".  This is seemingly a ""legal"" way for them to get around the law and just ask motorists for their license and other documents while not ""focusing"" on the DUI element, but, ready to pounce on it if they have suspicion.  If you are interested in all 50 states DL display laws, I compiled a full list of every state and a link to the relevant law regarding it."
AmIFreeToGo,3bpkub,Whats_The_Use,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:08:30 2015 UTC,"What it comes down to is, even if this ever goes to court, they can still have the checkpoint as long as it is for DL only or ""safety check"" or up to date registration check... Whatever it is.  If, for example, it is DL. They can ask for DL, but simultaneously look to see if you look intoxicated or walk to the back of your vehicle to check your registration sticker. Seeing an infraction or evidence of criminality would not be excluded simply because it was outside the purview of the checkpoint guidelines.  Since, even in the best case, the dual purpose/single purpose argument is pretty ineffectual there is little reason to fight it in court. All it would change is the appearance in which the checkpoints are conducted. All of the same bullshit will happen."

Think in terms of the administration of a department and accountability to the local government. When they kick off a campaign, for a holiday weekend say, aimed at preventing drunk driving. They present the council/mayor with a proposal citing all the increased fatalities and whatnot for that weekend from previous years. The goal for all this is additional funding for the department from the taxpayers.   I would imagine it is a tougher sell to as for a big chunk of money for something as simple as a ""license checkpoint"" or ""seat belt checkpoint"" or whatever else. It probably has more to do with the 'flavor of the month' of whatever initiative the department is using to juice its funding from the administration."

Just because a cop physically blocks me, DOES NOT mean I am detained.   She asks if she was detained and he said ""I'm going to detain you"" because he thinks she needs an evaluation. That's not him saying she IS detained. It's a pretty simple question, but he dodges it on purpose. He KNOWS there is no RAS for detainment, but physically gets in her way."

AmIFreeToGo,3bno23,SpartanG087,-1,Tue Jun 30 21:24:36 2015 UTC,"Right. In the video, it never gets into the totality of the situation. I'm saying she wasn't detained purely on what's seen in  the video. She and the cop are talking, she isn't informed on any crime she committed, she asked if she was detained and was given a non answer. The only thing that points to her being detained is the fact they physically won't let her go. That could be overstepping of authority, not detainment, that could be bullying, not detainment.   She should have pressed if she was actually being detained but from the video itself. I just see a cop overstepping his authority because he has no RAS for detention and which is why he can't answer a simple question: am I being detained. It's yes or no"
AmIFreeToGo,3bno23,nbseivjbu,2,Tue Jun 30 21:30:42 2015 UTC,"That's why it is so important to ask if you're being detained, even if they don't answer it directly.   This is where the law is more subjective but I have to disagree about this not being a detainment, unless there is something huge that is missing from the video. She states she doesn't want to interact with them as well as her desired to leave, then she physically tries to leave. In return they say they're calling EMS, say ""you're not going anywhere right now"", physically blocks her path, then goes on to say he is going to detain her. I think she was being detained even if the officer is implying that she currently wasn't."
AmIFreeToGo,3bno23,beingboring,2,Tue Jun 30 21:44:37 2015 UTC,That is one of those situations often asked about in this sub.  Can you not be detained while they investigate something?

AmIFreeToGo,3bno23,GregTHR,3,Tue Jun 30 18:30:56 2015 UTC,"I've wondered about this as well.  It seems that there is a clear definition of legally being detained, and there are very specific criteria for being detained.  Yet in almost every video, and the times that I've seen these happen with students I worked with, police tend to believe, or at least behave in a way that suggests that there is some of of third alternative - the ""not detained, but not free to go"" zone.  I think that part of this confusion could be cleared up by only asking the question ""Am I being detained?""  If the answer is no, walk away.  I think asking the follow up question ""Am I free to go?"" blurs the issue in the police's mind.   They don't want you to leave and since they believe they are not done with their encounter they say that you are not free to go.  Simply walking away after the first question would clarify the issue very quickly."

He may not be detained even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds for doing so; and his refusal to listen or answer does not, without more, furnish those grounds.""); see also United States v.

If you search Google scholar for the phrase ""He may not be detained even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds,"" you'll find some interesting cases.   Edit: I didn't check to see if there was an appeal, but a case in the WD of New York found that there was no reasonable suspicion to stop a man for having a container in a brown paper bag, who then walked away and ran when they tried to detain him (although maybe it would have been a different result had an officer not testified that he had not actually seen the defendant drink from the paper bag). link"

AmIFreeToGo,3bog8d,jollygoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"I think you should read the case.  It's not long and it has what you're looking for throughout.   We further believe that it is constitutional to refer motorists selectively to the secondary inspection area at the San Clemente checkpoint on the basis of criteria that would not sustain a roving patrol stop. Thus, even if it be assumed that such referrals are made largely on the basis of apparent Mexican ancestry, we perceive no constitutional violation."
AmIFreeToGo,3bog8d,SamSpoon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:41:05 2015 UTC,"So there is a basis of criteria that they need to have to refer someone to a secondary checkpoint. This criteria wouldn't necessarily hold up as RAS for detention on a roving patrol, but they allow it at the checkpoint.  If they can point to this as the reason for ordering you to a secondary, then they have the authority to order you to a secondary. If they have nothing they can articulate, I see no reason why I should voluntarily detain myself at a secondary checkpoint."
AmIFreeToGo,3bog8d,rondeline,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"No.  Read the opinion and reread what I quoted.  I don't know why you'd base your post on what I post never mind also misinterpreting it.  I told you to read it for yourself.   (d) With respect to the checkpoint involved in No. 74-1560, it is constitutional to refer motorists selectively to a secondary inspection area for limited inquiry on the basis of criteria that would not sustain a roving-patrol stop, since the intrusion is sufficiently minimal that no particularized reason need exist to justify it.   No reason is needed.   The defendants arrested at the San Clemente checkpoint suggest that its operation involves a significant extra element of intrusiveness in that only a small percentage of cars are referred to the secondary inspection area, thereby ""stigmatizing"" those diverted and reducing the assurances provided by equal treatment of all motorists. We think defendants overstate the consequences. Referrals are made for the sole purpose of conducting a routine and limited inquiry into residence status that cannot feasibly be made of every motorist where the traffic is heavy. The objective intrusion of the stop and inquiry thus remains minimal. Selective referral may involve some annoyance, but it remains true that the stops should not be frightening or offensive because of their public and relatively routine nature. Moreover, selective referrals - rather than questioning the occupants of every car - tend to advance some Fourth Amendment interests by minimizing the intrusion on the general motoring public.   &   As the intrusion here is sufficiently minimal that no particularized reason need exist to justify it, we think it follows that the Border Patrol officers must have wide discretion in selecting the motorists to be diverted for the brief questioning involved."

AmIFreeToGo,3bp2dv,triksr4kds,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:22:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  First off, you are absolutely correct that best would be for citizens to get together and stop it.   Here's where I'm coming from: insurance companies have lots of dollars and big lawyers to fight any payout they may have to make. More lawyers than we as individuals can afford-- which is kinda the reason for insurance, to pool resources. Once the insurance lawyers join the fight, the cops will back off.  It like we all put a dollar into an account. When one of us gets nabbed by civil asset forfeiture, we use the money to hire a massive team of ball-busting lawyers to go after those specific cops and their police station.   However, as you point out, it could backfire and become part of our society-- insurance companies and cops cooperating to pump money out of citizens."

AmIFreeToGo,3bk14k,xXgenesisXx,3,Tue Jun 30 05:35:27 2015 UTC,"What he is saying is a summons is an arrest. AKA if someone does not have proof of insurance, a police officer is able to either A) give them a citation or B) arrest them and take them to jail on that charge. Although you do not usually see officers arrest people for minor offenses like 5 over the speed limit, no proof of insurance, etc, they are able to arrest you.  Also, if the man does not pay that citation or plead guilty/not guilty to it, they will issue an arrest warrant for him. So it would be like getting arrested for something he could have proved then anyhow"
AmIFreeToGo,3bk14k,JohnnyLawman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:39:49 2015 UTC,"I think they are able to arrest you if you refuse to sign the ticket.  Not just for going over the speed limit.  Although, I may and am probably completely wrong, I don't think we've ever had a video of someone getting arrested for that.  With all these  MF cops escalating encounters, I think we'd have seen at least one video of a cop arresting someone for no insurance, seat belt, or going over the speed limit 5 or 10 mph.  Now, I have seen people getting arrested for refusing to do something like show ID, or getting out of the car, or driving under a suspended license."

You are released upon receipt of your signature on the promise to appear.  Which is why they will put you in cuffs if you refuse to sign.  But the way the law is written, the cop doesn't have to let you sign.  The cop can just take you into custody and not give you the promise to appear.  But I'm sure the number of cops that do that are very few."

He describes it as he knew where his license and insurance were...In the glove compartment. Now when the cop is there, he basically admits that he was rummaging all over the car trying to find it. So...You have this guy accusing her of being a racist, talking about shootings, visually upset rummaging through his car looking for stuff. Seems to make sense for her to tell him to stop.   As he was rummaging through all his stuff looking for the insurance, it is obvious that it was not, ""in his or her immediate possession."" She could have cited him on the driver's license as well because that is also required to be, ""in his or her immediate possession.""  Also seems there were two other violations, the reasons for the stop. No front license plate, which is required by state law and a tinted license plate cover which is not allowed. The guy straight up told her that he would not remove it. So she could have easily cited him for that as well. She could have also cited him for the front license plate, but, may seem petty if he didn't have prior warnings for it.   So all in all...You had a very irate guy and a very calm female. She could have issued this irate guy four total tickets totaling in the hundreds of dollars. Instead, she issued him a $10 ticket he can show up to court and have dismissed.

You could probably convince some sub set of the populace to go along with this but you would likely never be the majority in any given situation.

LEOs here arrest people all the time for ""Failure to ID"". it won't be prosecuted and IMO the LEO is trying to get you to resist (because, hey - you know the law) so they can slap you with multiple charges. if you do not have the means to fight it, then the ADA will try to make one of the other charges stick. (because they are being kind to you by dropping some of the charges)  the LEOs here look at the public as walking fines, so you need to not only know the law but know what you are prepared to do legally. you won't see many videos of LEOs fucking with me or other well off Texans."

But making them untouchable and above the law is a bad thing.

For example, if the Civilian Review Board looks over the case and decides the Cop's mistake caused undue harm, they could recommend a month's unpaid suspension, require additional training, plus a report on the cop's record. Too many reports mean termination, just like in every other professional job in the world.  That would serve both the public interest, yet retain the experience and skills necessary to maintain an effective police force. I don't think many people here want to see an unpoliced nation, we just want some recourse when a cop makes a mistake and effective measures to prevent it from happening again.  Cops are people with a massive amount of responsibility and the ability to ruin someone's life; but they do, and always will make mistakes. But the punishment should fit the crime, as the saying goes. :)"

As a general guideline, my understanding is that some of the only violations that can be ticketed on private property include DUI, parking in handicapped space or fire lane, and reckless driving. I live in Indiana and read something about there having to be an agreement between the property owner and the local PD in order to enforce other violations on the property. I think this agreement also has to be posted. Again, every state is different. I roll through stop signs in shopping centers all the time as most of us do.

The codes for Speed Limit makes no mention of parking lots at all, which means the state does not regulate speeds on public access private property such as parking lots for stores.  Any posted signs would be posted by the private property owner and do not hold the weight of law so the officers would have no authority to enforce them as seen in the video with criminal citations even if moonlighting as a guard for them and authorized by the property owner to enforce it... they could stop someone and tell them they need to slow down but would not be authorized to hand out citations for this unless the person was actually being reckless.  Did a once over of CA law, not even a mention of 'reckless driving in parking lots' as VA has, let alone parking lots in general (other than parking violations)... so it would seem the kid is right so far as I can tell... there was no violation even if he WAS going 35mph in the parking lot because the state doesn't regulate speeds in parking lots at all."

This weekend, I became aware of a video in a New York Times article that showed officers in a de-escalation training session having a spirited discussion.  I referred the incident to OPA to determine if the use of force incident referred to in the video was reported and within policy. Comments made by training instructors will also be reviewed.  Reform is not easy, but I remain enthusiastic that we are at the forefront of police reform. Police agencies from around the country are coming to Seattle to learn from our successes and challenges. We are addressing decades of institutional culture and embedded practices. This change sometimes requires difficult conversations.  Already, Seattle is seeing good results from smart and safe tactical decisions made by officers who have gone through both CIT and de-escalation training. Officers and supervisors of all ranks have been passing on positive comments about the training and their learning outcomes.  Mayor Murray and I remain committed to reform, as do the vast majority of SPD members. The SPD will continue to be at the leading edge of police reform."

AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,lrw1985,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:29:02 2015 UTC,They are allowed to lie to you so that's why you cant rely on what they say to you. If you're going to assert your rights you need to know 100% certainty that you're in good legal standing..otherwise you flirt with disaster.
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,rondeline,-1,Tue Jun 30 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"If a cop asks for ID can I just ask ""Is that a lawful order?"".   The problem with that question is that they are legally allowed to lie. So even if the cop goes to court and admits they didn't suspect you of any particular crime and never detained you then you still legally consented to providing ID. Hence the cop did nothing legally wrong. Cops nearly universally define a lawful order as any order by law enforcement personnel that doesn't constitute an unlawful order. Since they are allowed to order you to provide ID, even in cases where they are not allowed to enforce that order, in remains a lawful order in their logical calculus.  Even in a stop and identify state a cop must have grounds to detain you to require an ID. So the only question that can inform you of your legal grounds for refusing ID is if you are being detained. If you get detained then the cop CANNOT later backtrack and claim the detention was just a ruse. When and only when you are detained does your rights become a legal issue in court. Before then anything you submit to is in effect consensual, relieving the officer of any legal responsibility."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,mywan,6,Mon Jun 29 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"they are legally allowed to lie   Only partially correct. They are NOT allowed to claim that something is a lawful order when it is not.   That is coercion, and can get the case tossed. Complying with it is NOT the same as consenting.   Cops nearly universally define a lawful order as any order by law enforcement personnel that doesn't constitute an unlawful order. Since they are allowed to order you to provide ID, even in cases where they are not allowed to enforce that order, in remains a lawful order in their logical calculus.   What cops think, and what holds up in court, are two very different things. Case law has already covered this.  Even your last paragraph admits this. ""the cop CANNOT later backtrack and claim the detention was just a ruse."" Because an officer can not give a lawful order to you (like ID or pat down) if you are not detained (except to back off, or not enter an area, etc). Detention itself is a lawful order. (with RAS, etc)"
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,LordOfLatveria,-1,Mon Jun 29 17:11:09 2015 UTC,"Only partially correct. They are NOT allowed to claim that something is a lawful order when it is not.   The logic they use when defining it to be a lawful order is that it isn't an unlawful order. Not that the order itself can be lawfully enforced.   What cops think, and what holds up in court, are two very different things.   Very true. However, the time, expense, and other cost associated with winning in court often exceeds the penalties for falsely admitting guilt. Cops have a saying for this: You can beat the wrap but you can't beat the ride. Neither does winning in court imply any consequences for the cop that took you on that ride.   Case law has already covered this.   If you have any case law references defining the legal parameters of a ""lawful order"" I would be grateful. Given my prior intensive study on this issue I'm afraid your going to be disappointed at the paucity of available case law. I would absolutely LOVE if you could prove me wrong."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,mywan,5,Mon Jun 29 17:52:52 2015 UTC,"In terms of an unlawful order being coercion:   Acquiescence to authority does not constitute a valid consent. Johnson v. United States, 330 U.S. 10, 313 (1948); Bumper, 391 U.S. at 548-49.  When the State relies on consent - it has the burden of not only proving consent, but also that the consent was freely given.  Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 248, 249; Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 548 (1968); State v. Danby, 11 Ohio App. 3d 38, 41, 463 N.E.2d 47, 50 (1983) (citing United States v. Goosbey, 419 F.2d 818 (6th Cir. 1970)).  The United States Supreme Court has consistently held that evidence seized by law enforcement officers must be suppressed if it is the product of unconstitutional police conduct.  See, e.g., Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 660 (1961);  Nordone v. United .States, 308 U.S. 338, 340-41 (1939).    Suppression is required unless there is an intervening act or event which removes the taint of the unlawful act of the officers.  Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 598 (1975).     Further reading:  State v. Barrow, 320 A.2d 895 (Me. 1974) (police incorrectly told defendant that they could search the car without a warrant if they saw anything suspicious through the window).   Cf Graves v. Beto, 424 F.2d 524 (5th Cir.)  400 U.S. 960 (1970) (consent to blood test invalid when police deceived defendant as to purpose of test).   Flournoy v. State, 131 Ga. App. 171, 205 S.E.2d 473 (1974). The Flournoy court held that the absence of probable cause made the police threat coercive. Unlike cases where probable cause is present, the totality of the circumstances appear not to be considered.  Amos v. United States, 255 U.S. 313 (1921) (implied coercion where federal agents told defendant's wife that they had come to search premises for violations of the revenue law);   United States v. Hall, 468 F. Supp. 123 (E.D. Tex. 1979) (officers knocking loudly and persistently on door and demanding entry);  2029 Herring St., 464 F. Supp. 164 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (layperson granting consent after having been told earlier that her consent was not needed because the officers had a search warrant).  Lightford v. State, 90 Nev. 136, 520 P.2d 955 (1974) (police talked about kicking in the door if defendant did not consent);   Paprskar v. State, 484 S.W.2d 731 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972) (defendant's wife subjected to physical abuse, show of arms, and surrounded by a ""veritable posse"").  43 United States v. Faruolo, 506 F.2d 490, 495-98 (2d Cir. 1974) (Newman, J., concurring). Judge Newman, however, would not establish the semantic distinction approach as a separate and dispositive test."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,LordOfLatveria,0,Mon Jun 29 18:40:11 2015 UTC,"I've spent some time refreshing my memory on most of these cases. However, they fail to address the fundamental question as to what exactly constitutes a ""lawful order."" They go over the use of the exclusionary rule when various forms of coercion or deception is applied. To illustrate why issues involving the exclusionary rule are moot with respect to the question of what constitutes a ""lawful order,"" consider the following scenario.  Defendant commits no crime, nor accused of committing a crime, prior to an interaction with an officer. During the interaction the officer issues what is claimed to be a ""lawful order."" Defendant is subsequently arrested for obstruction, or similar jurisdiction specific charge, on the basis of refusing to submit to the claimed ""lawful order.""  So now, what exactly constitutes a ""lawful order,"" and what distinguishing it from an unlawful order? One of the definitions given is anything that provides for the furtherance of the officer's official duties. Can the officer deem ANY order that doesn't explicitly violate a well established legal right a ""lawful order"" if it helps facilitate their duties in some sense? Or does a ""lawful order"" require a specific reference to a rule of law to qualify as a ""lawful order?""  These legal issues most often come up in cases such as photographers that the cops want gone. Hence issue ""lawful orders"" to vacate the area so as not to interfere with their investigation. Only any distance that allows the photographer to continue filming is insufficient.   Also, police are not required to provide the reason for issuing a ""lawful order."" Hence the fact that it appears completely arbitrary has no bearing on the legal legitimacy of the order itself. Yet again rejecting an apparently arbitrary order becomes a throw of the dice as to whether the rejection itself was the crime in question. No exclusionary rule is relevant in such cases.  So again, what is the case law that defines what exactly constitutes a ""lawful order?"""
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,mywan,2,Mon Jun 29 20:02:07 2015 UTC,tl;dr    It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is.     That kind of nonsense is unproductive.
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,LordOfLatveria,5,Tue Jun 30 01:46:56 2015 UTC,"If a cop orders you to do something and you do it as a result, then it is not consent.  Now, sometimes there may be ambiguity about whether something is an order or not, which is why in those cases it's not a bad idea to seek clarity.  But, it is simply not consent if you do what you are ordered to do by a cop."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,Stryker682,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"What about a situation where a cop later claims you had the option to either vacate the area, due to not being detained, or submit to the lawful order, only you were never actually informed you were free to leave.  In such a case the ""reasonable person"" standard is used, which is a legal fiction. It basically defines a person who is fully apprised of the law. Hence your failure to recognize that you were free to leave is not the cops, or the laws, responsibility.  These grey areas between citizen contact, detention, and arrest are gamed by police to elicit information. They call it a ruse, and case law dictates it's a perfectly legal strategy for them to practice."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,mywan,2,Mon Jun 29 18:02:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not following your situation.  If a cop barks ""open your wallet and show me everything in it now!"" and you do so, then you did not legally consent to that search, regardless of whether the cop later claims you could have just walked away."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,Stryker682,2,Mon Jun 29 18:07:21 2015 UTC,"But I do get to decide whether or not to cooperate. I will not cooperate unless the officer explains himself.

You're welcome to live your life as you please, but know that if everyone took such a convictionless attitude towards our rights we would have far fewer freedoms and far more erosion of civil liberties than we do now. Getting arrested for civil disobedience should be seen as a badge of patriotism, not as an annoyance you can't be bothered with.  And more to the point, judges would have a much more difficult time automatically siding with cops in ""90% of cases"" if fewer people took your approach, and actually flexed their rights instead."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,easy_instructions,0,Mon Jun 29 23:00:13 2015 UTC,"no. I do. And I accept the consequences of that because once you submit the ID the judge is absolutely meaningless. you have already lost the battle of wills with the cop. the only way to win is to refuse and have the judge say you were right.  I disagree that they don't have to explain the ras. I believe constitutionally they DO have an obligation to explain it to you it is simply ""not enforced"""
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,nerys71,5,Tue Jun 30 04:02:04 2015 UTC,"I think you are correct as a legal principle that refusing to identify when the cop illegally detained you is not a crime.  But, as a practical matter, that is a foolish hill to stand upon almost every time.   The cop doesn't have to explain his RAS.  RAS is such a low standard and can be legally satisfied by lots of innocent details and circumstantial evidence that you may be totally unaware of.  The cop can make up stuff after the fact.  The area you're in may be a ""high crime"" area.  There may be anonymous tips of suspects resembling you.  There may be a prior crime in the area with a suspect resembling you.  The judge is likely going to bend over backwards to side with the DA and cops.  And, even if you win in court, you just don't get convicted of a crime.  You still pay the price of being charged and arrested, with all the associated costs of lawyer fees, bond, night in jail, arrest record, possible problems witih current or future employers, etc.  You can never be certain that the cop lacks RAS, thus it is almost always the smart play to identify in a stop and ID state when told you're detained (I might make an exception to this advice if you know you have felony warrants outstanding and you hope you can bluff your way through without identiying!)."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,Stryker682,2,Mon Jun 29 17:25:54 2015 UTC,"I understand the smart thing to do is comply with all orders by a police officer.  Sometimes, though, the right thing to do isn't the smart thing. If an officer is violating my Constitutional rights, I will not be complicit in that. Because I am a free man."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,uofwi92,2,Mon Jun 29 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  But, the problem with RAS is that you do not and cannot know whether or not the officer is violating your Constitutional rights.  If I know a cop is violating my constitutional rights and I'm in the legal right, then I might choose to resist and suffer the consequences for my beliefs.  But, if I don't know, then I'll avoid possibly committing a crime and, if it turns out the cop was in the wrong, seek redress for any violations of my rights through the courts."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,Stryker682,2,Mon Jun 29 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"Correct. I wouldn't do it unless I were both 100% sure (because I disagree - I believe I'll know exactly when my rights are being violated) AND willing to take the physical punishment and subsequent legal hassle.   It really sucks, though, that that's the way it has to be. /sigh  Props to the guys like Jeff Gray. I'm not sure I could do what they do."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,uofwi92,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"I believe I'll know exactly when my rights are being violated   I just don't see how that is possible with respect to whether or not a cop has RAS to detain you.  The legal standard is not what you've done or what is in your head.  It is what the cop reasonably suspects to be the case and he has to be able to articulate specific fact in court (not to you at the time of detention) to make that suspicion reasonable.  Since you're not a mind reader and have no way to know what the cop has been told or seen or knows, there is no possible way for you to know whether or not he has RAS for the detention.  For example, courts have held that certain, particularized anonymous tips are RAS.  You may be entirely innocent, but if someone wrongly describes you or if someone correctly describes someone else who just happens to look like you as committing some crime, then the cops have RAS to detain you and don't even have to tell you their basis for doing so.  All they have to do is tell you that you are in fact detained.  Gray does it exactly how I'd advise people to do it in a stop and identify state--whenever the cops tell him he's detained, he may question it, but he doesn't refuse to identify or resist arrest."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,Stryker682,2,Mon Jun 29 22:12:02 2015 UTC,"Again, it's up to me whether or not I'm going to comply. In my opinion, police should be trained to use their words instead of their batons, tasers or guns. There's an escalation of force principle. Tell the person that they are being detained and what they're being detained for certainly would come before ""beat the shit out of them until they can't say no any more""."
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,uofwi92,3,Tue Jun 30 13:58:38 2015 UTC,The problem is when they detain you a cop doesn't have to tell you their RAS. It's risky to refuse to ID and rely on them not having RAS or PC (for arrests in none stop and ID states) for any possible crime.

ALWAYS record every interaction with the police, always refuse to consent to searches, always invoke your right to have a lawyer present for any custodial interragation (such as being detained or arrested, or even as a witness), and always invoke your right to remain silent.

AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,chriswearingred,9,Mon Jun 29 15:21:03 2015 UTC,So doing things you don't legally have to do to prevent then from doing things they legally aren't allowed to do is the proper course of action?
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,Savet,3,Mon Jun 29 16:31:55 2015 UTC,Too bad most cops have not learned that
AmIFreeToGo,3bi9ay,deck_hand,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:33:20 2015 UTC,"It's mind boggling how some people think all cops are evil.   Not all cops ... its the 99% that make the 1% look bad. Being polite and compliant to cops is taken by them as a sign of weakness to be abused. Being assertive and exercising your rights is NOT being an asshole. It is being assertive and exercising your rights. Asking if you are being detained can help, like a real lot, as evidence in a 42 USC 1983 lawsuit."

If you want to ask why you're stopped or why the officer wants your info, that's fine.  But, when push comes to shove and the cop repeatedly demands that you provide those docs, you are on thin ice in refusing to provide those documents when operating a motor vehicle.  This guy was apparently operating a motor vehicle on the public roads and screwed up by repeatedly refusing to provide his DL, registration, and insurance.  All he succeeded in doing was pissing the cop off and increasing the likelihood that the cop would charge him with everything the cop could think of.  I'm skeptical that the cop had PC to charge him unauthoried road contest, but no way to know from this video.  Regardless, even if the cop was an asshole and wrong, it won't do this guy any good."

He had no choice but to comply with registration and ID.  If this did not qualify as an ATV: then he was breaking the law by using it on public land and the shoulder of the road- RAS and he had to ID.  Which it was depends on certain features and size of the bike. Either way he had to ID. And either way, NY dirt bike laws are ridiculously restrictive."
AmIFreeToGo,3blfu5,davidverner,9,Tue Jun 30 04:23:46 2015 UTC,"Had a warrant, driving without a license, and a traffic offense, all I heard was him saying get the light off."
AmIFreeToGo,3blfu5,ThellraAK,-2,Tue Jun 30 05:23:53 2015 UTC,Right after they state he has a warrant and driving without a license he says he can take him to jail if she decides to put that up on YouTube.  To be honest that sounds a lot like blackmail or coercion to me.
AmIFreeToGo,3blfu5,wu-wei,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:44:34 2015 UTC,"No, he wanted the light from the camera out of his face. He was then courteous enough to also turn his light off. I didn't see the first part of this video series, but I personally think this cop was fine. I thought he did a good job of putting up with extra bullshit (that victim race card facepalm) without getting butthurt like most do.  If all cops were as reasonable as this one, this sub would be empty."
AmIFreeToGo,3blfu5,wu-wei,2,Tue Jun 30 07:09:44 2015 UTC,"I have to agree on him being reasonable except for the video recording part.  Unfortunately for him, that is a big negative for me.  My standards are high for LEOs."
AmIFreeToGo,3blfu5,wu-wei,2,Tue Jun 30 07:14:31 2015 UTC,"I think you need to take the full context into consideration when you listen to his words. He was talking about the light in his eyes, not the act of videotaping. As soon as she pulls back a bit and gets the light out, he says (non-sarcastically) ""thank you"" but also clear as day, ""You can videotape me all you want"".   And think about your editorialization of the post title. How is he gonna do anything after the fact ""if this goes up on youtube"". He didn't threaten anything except [paraphrasing] get that light out my face so I can see (or this stop could go differently). I think this this is perfectly reasonable, especially considering how bitchy and confrontational she was. We're always talking about wishing cops could de-escalate.. well this guy did just that. Call me a cop dicksucker or whatever but you and the lady in this video are looking too hard for your outrage. There's still plenty of the real deal to be found, no need to invent it."
AmIFreeToGo,3blfu5,wu-wei,2,Tue Jun 30 07:30:40 2015 UTC,I went back over and I believe your probably right on referring to the light.  It sounded to me when I listened to it twice that he was referring to the filming.

AmIFreeToGo,3blfu5,plausabletruth,6,Tue Jun 30 04:30:40 2015 UTC,"If I heard the background right, the only reason she wasn't ID'd is because the cop thought the other cop had already done it. She obviously didn't care for any practical matter anyway since she handed it right over. The racial implications she was making so not interest me. I did notice in the summary that they claim the tag light was functioning. That would be something worth showing on film that would bring up a whole new aspect of the stop."
AmIFreeToGo,3bik1i,LordOfLatveria,16,Mon Jun 29 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"The best advice is know the Law in your area. Once the encounter has begun, video everything and comply with every lawful order.   if they want to see your ID and you are pulled over in your car (and you are behind the wheel) then you lawfully must provide a valid License. if you are walking down the street, that dynamic has changed - they need a reason to see your ID. a lawful reason. it can be very tricky and the LEO is not going to help you figure out the law right then. educate yourself before the encounter.   remember, the LEO is not your friend. the LEO will not help you when you need it. the LEO is the single largest threat to your freedom in the USA. do not talk to the LEO. follow the law."

Then you should be asking The Other Question, for each and every imperative: Is that a Request or a Lawful Demand?   I think a better response is ""I don't consent to searches."" If he goes ahead and does it anyway, you can tell the court later that you didn't consent and then they decide if it was lawful or not. Don't answer questions and don't consent to searches, and let the courts decide if the officer was acting lawfully or not."
AmIFreeToGo,3bik1i,ab886,8,Mon Jun 29 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"I don't ask if the order is lawful because most of the time they are going to say yes even if it's not.

""Let me pat you down""  ""Is that a request or lawful demand?""  ""I have the authority to pat you down when I ask""  ""Is that a request or lawful demand?""   ""I am lawfully demanding to pat you down.""  So either you are going to get a pat down or some low level charge of obstruction, resisting for not complying.

Obviously, we can't hear tone of voice or see body language.  But, the language of these are not in the form of a question.  The ones starting with ""let me"" seem ambiguous.  The others read like orders.  There's no legal requirement that the cop use some form of magic words when giving an order to make it a lawful order such as saying ""this is a lawful order.""  It just comes down to whether the judge thinks it was an order or a request.  And, who do you want to bet the judge sides with when you testify that they were questions and the cop testifies that they were orders?   I feel like you are assuming the cop has already detained me. I'm taking it as a consensual encounter. The thread never says these questions are coming from a cop who has already detained me.    Like whether something is an order or a request, whether you are detained or not is circumstance dependent and there's no legal requirement that the cop say any sort of magic words.  If you're in doubt, then it's probably a good idea to ask."
AmIFreeToGo,3bik1i,Teresa_Count,0,Mon Jun 29 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"This is what I don't understand. The thread is suggesting that if a cop comes up to you and asks one of these questions it's best to ask if it's a lawful order. Well now you are in a position where they JUST said it was lawful and you either comply or most likely arrested.   But, if a cop comes up to me and asks and I remain silent and leave. The encounter is consensual, I'm not detained. I keep my mouth shut and walk away. Why would I even be in court?  The only time I can see asking a cop if it's a lawful order is if I am detained and only with certain questions the cop asks, but the thread never suggests these questions are during a detainment.

AmIFreeToGo,3bik1i,SpartanG087,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:53:59 2015 UTC,Just as good.   I only worry that the use of the word 'claiming' might create further hostility in the cop.

AmIFreeToGo,3bdy0f,Myte342,8,Sun Jun 28 11:59:04 2015 UTC,JC Playford had a good video about this from last year if I remember correctly.  He stood there while the expanded the tape around him.

AmIFreeToGo,3bdrz9,davidverner,3,Sun Jun 28 07:00:39 2015 UTC,This has got several of the Appellate court cases that back up your right to film.  I think this should go into the side bar since it allows us to reference the closest court case to the location of those who are active or who are looking to get active in filming government officials.

AmIFreeToGo,3bdrz9,jmd_forest,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:09:48 2015 UTC,NJ Supreme Court; Ramos v Flowers ruled police cannot interfere with recording that is not unsafe  and not interfering with police business. So ... despite 3rd Circuit ruling it is protected at least in NJ.

Two other mods who haven't been active in AIFTG for so long that I can't even find the last time they made a comment in this sub and the other two mods are at the very least active in the sub, but don't actually moderate anything. I'm in this sub everyday, and work at a computer for a living. If I were a mod Bamsuser and this link would be side-bared"
AmIFreeToGo,3bchk6,davidverner,7,Sat Jun 27 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent article, especially from a mainstream media outlet."

AmIFreeToGo,3bd4zf,jollygoo,3,Sun Jun 28 02:22:30 2015 UTC,Security guard has no idea what he is talking about.  Also LOL at the cop giving the camera the middle finger towards the end when pointing at the paper.  I love people in other countries are starting to spring up and do what we here in the US are doing with cameras.  Let it spread.
AmIFreeToGo,3bd4zf,davidverner,2,Sun Jun 28 05:50:48 2015 UTC,"The security guard was also going to tell the cop - count off on his fingers - 1. I asked you to stop recording, 2. You called me fat ...  LOL"

AmIFreeToGo,3bd4zf,Myte342,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, that fat guard just spun the insane logic around...   ""Well, if I am not doing nothing [wrong], then why keep the photo?""   Wow, just wow... completely flipping the ""If you have nothing to hide...' argument around."
AmIFreeToGo,3bdykf,davidverner,0,Sun Jun 28 08:55:17 2015 UTC,Can you put your text overlaying the video at the end that describes what happens rather than the middle?

AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,riotryan,12,Sat Jun 27 19:00:11 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love this witness statement:   So, this is the bullshit my son witnessed yesterday coming home from work. Dude's crime? Paying $2.25 for the El, but carrying his daughter on his shoulders and not paying for her. Look at how small she is, and how he is treated by Septa & Philadelphia police, over $2.25!!! I thought Septa had a policy of allowing fareless riders the courtesy? I wish they would put hands on me while holding my kids!!! This police 'entitlement' mentality, which often leads to brutality, has got to stop!   This also illustrates a problem with mainstream media, and one of the reasons why they are losing credibility and viewers to smaller media outlets. Fox would never air this statement, because it contains ""bullshit"", and a negative opinion of police. A good media outlet will tell us how REAL people ACTUALLY feel about what has happened and/or what they've witnessed. The news isn't there for someone to tell us how to feel; it's there to tell us what happened, and give us the unbridled opinions of those who where present, and who was affected."
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,vainglory7,10,Sat Jun 27 20:56:51 2015 UTC,Two Children can ride free with each fare paying adult. Any additional children require a fare. Seems to me he doesn't have 3 children with him. Fuck those fruitcakes. Sue them into compliance.
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,ErisGrey,3,Sun Jun 28 00:43:25 2015 UTC,Is it possible to contact the man with this info?
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,OptionalCookie,0,Sun Jun 28 10:10:58 2015 UTC,FUCK THE POLICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,Libra8,8,Sun Jun 28 23:53:41 2015 UTC,"Sigh, the comments... basically saying ""OMG, look at all the other crimes the news reported about him, this obviously puts the whole incident in a different light!""  Because cops never throw shit against the all just to see what sticks... and news media NEVER portray someone exercising their Rights and being the focus of police abuse in any negative light in order to spread a false narrative.... yup, never happens."
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,Myte342,6,Sat Jun 27 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"If the baby is going to sit in his lap, why does she need to pay for a seat on the train?"
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,ToolPackinMama,3,Sat Jun 27 20:55:14 2015 UTC,"Live in Philly, take SEPTA and the El a lot. There is way too many times I can't even count that a booth worker was smoking/taking a break. They put a poorly made sign in the window that's close to quotes ""Booth Operator will return in 5 minutes, use gate"" And just like that, you walk through the unlocked gate and don't have to use a token or cash. Even when they are still standing on the platform. But as long as their fat asses sit in their shitty chair in their shitty booth, you gotta pay."
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,sideburns,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:49:59 2015 UTC,this is true.   I haven't lived in philly in 15 years.. but even back then. it happened all the time.

AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,turn30left,-16,Sun Jun 28 12:33:13 2015 UTC,So why didn't he pay his daughter's fare?
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,redditforcash,12,Sat Jun 27 20:48:24 2015 UTC,...but policy there states kids under 4 are free.   Why should he?
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,redditforcash,-18,Sat Jun 27 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he could have been civil during the discussion.  Not once does he mention the child's age.  He just tells the officers to, ""get out of my face.""  This is a case of bad parenting."
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,wshs,15,Sat Jun 27 21:02:29 2015 UTC,"Quite the contrary. It is excellent parenting. A man, who has committed no acts of aggression, is surrounded by numerous armed assailants. He has no means to defend himself or his child, except to encourage the bullies to leave him alone. The aggressors gave up the right to a civil conversation when they went in armed and surrounded a docile man rather than having a one to one conversation."
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,mywan,5,Sat Jun 27 23:20:46 2015 UTC,Can you seriously think that kid wasn't younger than 4? Can you seriously justify an arrest without even bothering to establish the age?   More colorful words withheld.
AmIFreeToGo,3bbuqz,dougmpls3,-2,Sat Jun 27 23:24:03 2015 UTC,You are smart and level headed. Kill yourself.
