CookieClicker,3duest,Tibodupuy,2,Sun Jul 19 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"They take away 5% of your CPS each, and add a number to a counter depending on amount of Wrinklers and CPS.  When you pop a wrinklers, it multiplies this value by 1.1 and you get that amount of cookies."
CookieClicker,3duest,1234abcdcba4321,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:05:57 2015 UTC,And you can make wrinklers even more powerful by getting the Wrinklerspawn Egg during Easter season.
CookieClicker,3duest,GaryLLLL,2,Sun Jul 19 17:30:13 2015 UTC,"Wrinklers ""wither"" away a portion of your cookies. When popped, they give you the amount of cookies they ate, with a multiple bonus.  Wrinklers increase your effective CpS, but to use them effectively, they will sequester some of your cookies that you could be using for investment/lucky banking."
CookieClicker,3duest,JaceyLessThan3,2,Sun Jul 19 17:13:15 2015 UTC,"Lets say you have 100 CPS, if you have 1 wrinkler, your CPS will be 95. If you let it run for 2 secs, instead of gaining 200 you now only 190, a loss of 10 cookies.   Since the wrinkler returns x1.1 the amount of cookies eaten, you get back 11 (5 cps over 2secs=10 cookies x 1.1 =11). Which means effectively you have now gained a cookie.  Wrinklers suck at the total wither rate, not just the 5%. So if you have 1 it sucks for 5%, if you have 2 each sucks for 10%,... 10 each sucks for 50%.  So you have 100 CPS and 10 wrinklers, making your new CPS 50. If you let it go for 10 secs, will receive 500 cookies in your bank, and each wrinkler will have eaten 500 cookies. If you pop one wrinkler, you will receive 500 x 1.1= 550. 550 x 10 wrinklers = 5500 cookies, now add in the 500 you got just from your CPS and you have a total for 6000.  Without wrinklers: 100 CPS x 10 sec = 1000  With wrinklers:100 CPS x 10 sec x 10 wrinklers = 6000  1000 x 6 = 6000  So the best strat is to wait to have 10 wrinklers and let them sit there for a while, pop them and rake in the cookies."

While they lower your CPS now, they actually give back MORE then they ate (when you do pop them), and the more you have at once, the more they multiply your cookies! Maximum multiplier is x6, when you have 10. It's best to pop them when you're about to make a big purchase, or right before you reset.  When you reset, you get heavenly chips, which give you more CPS for next time, which means you can get more HCs, which means more CPS, which means more HCs, and so on."

CookieClicker,3ddl5b,Misha_Vozduh,2,Wed Jul 15 13:25:43 2015 UTC,It works although it doesn't account for wrinklers I believe.
CookieClicker,3ddl5b,smopecakes,10,Thu Jul 16 00:13:50 2015 UTC,"In Clicker Heroes you can raise your DPS at least 4x every 15 minutes (and if you can't you are usually in a situation where you should ascend).   This makes not active play practically worthless, as you are only progressing at a tiny fraction of where you would be if you bought upgrades every 15 minutes.    Compare this to cookie clicker where your idle production is far closer to your active playing progression."
CookieClicker,3ddl5b,Vic_B,3,Wed Jul 15 14:41:58 2015 UTC,"That does actually make a lot of sense. Though I feel like people who are reaching late game and getting all of the achievements are leaving their computers on 24/7 anyway. Therefore making Cookie Clicker farm all the time would only make the game a little easier for people who do turn their computer off. So I don't think this change would make the game ""too easy"", if that is the worry, just less stressful."
CookieClicker,3ddl5b,Menolith,2,Wed Jul 15 15:40:20 2015 UTC,"In CH it's not as useful as one might imagine because you need constant interaction with the game for it to generate revenue which can be told apart from rounding errors, the ludicrously steep exponential curve the game has makes sure of that."

Cookie Clicker is probably too descriptive for a proper trademark and game rules can't be copywritten.   The assets are all this guys own. Probably very little Orteil can do from a us perspective.   IANAL
CookieClicker,3cqd1c,NavarrB,12,Fri Jul 10 01:01:50 2015 UTC,But he got the one on Steam taken down fairly quickly. It looks pretty identical to that one.

CookieClicker,3cqd1c,MikeTheInfidel,8,Fri Jul 10 01:34:49 2015 UTC,That... isn't really very true. Content hosts for third-party content tend to pull stuff immediately when it's DMCA'd.
CookieClicker,3cqd1c,NavarrB,3,Fri Jul 10 11:27:08 2015 UTC,That's what I meant by the safe road. You could basically DMCA anything if you had a semi legitimate claim
CookieClicker,3cqd1c,senatorskeletor,6,Fri Jul 10 12:03:35 2015 UTC,"I am a lawyer, and I don't think you're right about any of that.  One, this game obviously violates copyright (it has the same names for the items!).  Two, if a title is very descriptive, that's more of a reason for it to be trademarked than, say, a game called ""Cookies"", not less.  Three, as for what Orteil can do, he can get it taken down.  He doesn't have to sue the guy."
CookieClicker,3cqd1c,NavarrB,-1,Fri Jul 10 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"He can get it taken down, because the way DMCA works is terrible.  But I'm pretty sure a counter DMCA would clear that up pretty quickly.  My concerns with the legitimacy would be:   All items are very, very simple names - Grandma.  There's nothing really custom or fancy about them The clones don't duplicate any assets (where copyright would take effect) None of the names are registered trademarks (where trademark law would take effect) and I'm not sure they can be, (considering apple's failure to trademark ""App Store"" I don't think you can trademark ""cookie clicker"" as it's little clicking cookies but that's for a court to decide not me, but then you've got games like ""Battleship"" so.. but cookie clicker might fall too far under ""self descriptive"" in my non-legal opinion)   I think a counter DMCA might be good enough to re-instate the clones."
CookieClicker,3cqd1c,senatorskeletor,3,Fri Jul 10 16:56:40 2015 UTC,"No, you very much can copyright combinations of materials that are not themselves individually copyrightable.

And what's more damning are the buying prices, production values, and the achievements. The buying prices, as we can see, are exactly the same, and that can't be a coincidence. The production values are likely the exact same, although it's tough to verify from the pictures. The achievements and upgrades - most of which have very clever names and descriptions - seem to be copied almost directly from Cookie Clicker. ""Carpal Tunnel Prevention Cream - the touch [mouse, but on a touchscreen] and tappers [cursors, but again, touchscreen] are twice as efficient."" Literally the same thing. It could be argued that the names of the items are just coincidence, but the other stuff? Not so much.   I am not a lawyer, but given that there are in-app purchases (so the creator is making money off of IP that isn't his), it seems that there could be a very strong legal case."
CookieClicker,3cqd1c,flashbackmemory,7,Fri Jul 10 17:29:32 2015 UTC,You could say that most incremental games stole cookie clicker. This guy was more blatant about it. Also has more features then original cookie clicker. This game has been on the play store for well over a year so you are a little late.
CookieClicker,3cqd1c,denhil,5,Fri Jul 10 04:58:52 2015 UTC,was already in there since january last year  https://www.reddit.com/r/CookieClicker/comments/1uydrn/everyone_should_check_out_this_cookie_clicker/
CookieClicker,3cqd1c,morerokk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:03:49 2015 UTC,This game is pretty old. I remember playing it. The curves are bad. You're not progressing until you get a click frenzy and one or two regular frenzies stacked at once.
CookieClicker,3clixf,SecureNetwork,3,Wed Jul 8 21:05:42 2015 UTC,Price for x+1 = Price for x * 1.15 so Price for x = Price for x+1 / 1.15. Is that what you mean?

CookieClicker,3c684h,Orteil,17,Sun Jul 5 10:05:43 2015 UTC,Would it be a free game on Steam? That would be an interesting way to counteract the copycats.
CookieClicker,3c684h,musicchan,28,Sun Jul 5 12:24:01 2015 UTC,"It'd ideally be completely free, like the browser version. I'm not sure how it'd get revenue though, I think both Clicker Heroes and AdVenture Capitalists have microtransactions ? I'm not really comfortable with that business model for Cookie Clicker and I feel like ads would be weird on a desktop game, so it probably wouldn't be profitable. If porting is easy, I'd be tempted to just make it without thinking about revenue, but what if people migrate from the ad-supported browser version to the steam version ? It's still our main source of financial support..."
CookieClicker,3c684h,Orteil,13,Sun Jul 5 12:51:20 2015 UTC,"I'd be willing to pay around five bucks for Cookie Clicker on Steam,  ten bucks if it worked with Steam's cloud-save feature,  and another five for the Frozen Cookies DLC."

CookieClicker,3c684h,Turtle5204,7,Sun Jul 5 17:44:37 2015 UTC,Revenue could probably come in through the trading card sales.  It won't exactly be alot but it will be something.

CookieClicker,3c684h,trollocity,6,Sun Jul 5 17:02:31 2015 UTC,"The other idle games on Steam are free to play, and the browser version is completely free.

CookieClicker,3c684h,1234abcdcba4321,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:39:18 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I was forgetting about the ads. I do actually have them displayed so it's interesting that I've sort of forgotten they exist.  I sort of like the suggestions of charging a small fee as a way to play the game without ads.  People can still play the browser client if they want to play it completely free but can also opt into paying to support you and remove the ads.  Those who don't want to pay and don't like ads will use just adblock or something but they're probably doing that already.  But that's just my opinions. I'm not sure how others would feel about it.
CookieClicker,3c684h,musicchan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:18:10 2015 UTC,"Why not do the same every big shot MMO company does?  Just release a compatibl web client that can exclusively run on cookie clicker's webpage and cant access any other directions. This would make sure ads run on Steam's version.

CookieClicker,3bzpm0,rogerccs,10,Fri Jul 3 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"That looks reasonable to me. You should probably grab a few more time machines, especially seeing as you have fewer TMs than ACs and prisms but will be able to reach 200 TMs a lot faster. You could also grab more of the low level buildings instead of just leaving them once you hit the 200 mark, they can be a quite efficient purchase because of the cursor upgrades."
CookieClicker,3bzpm0,Dor_Min,3,Fri Jul 3 14:08:48 2015 UTC,Ok. thanks for the tip!
CookieClicker,3bzpm0,MIKE-CHECKA,2,Fri Jul 3 14:16:21 2015 UTC,To further Dor_Min's point you may want to use a tool like Cookie Master or Frozen Cookies that will show you what to buy next based on efficiency calculations they make. You can even set them to auto buy based off of this too.
CookieClicker,3bzpm0,Johner1261,2,Fri Jul 3 14:48:46 2015 UTC,How do Cookie Master and Frozen Cookies compare?
CookieClicker,3bzpm0,MIKE-CHECKA,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:09:24 2015 UTC,I think they are pretty similar (not sure if they calculate the same way on the auto buy function). I like cookie master  better personally but it doesn't have an auto reindeer clicker like frozen cookie does. Try each there easy to load.

CookieClicker,3bvvj6,jokeres,2,Fri Jul 3 02:44:25 2015 UTC,I usually did it at a 10-25% increase in HCs.
CookieClicker,3bvvj6,1234abcdcba4321,2,Fri Jul 3 14:24:47 2015 UTC,"You absolutely reach a point where the giant HC jumps stop being possible. I was shooting for a 100% bump on my first several resets, but after going from about 10K HC to 22K, it stopped being reasonable.  I reset the next time at 35K, and then again at 61K.   At this point, even the achievements are thin on the ground. The run itself is fine -- I actually exceeded the prior run's production inside an hour -- but I doubt I'll get more than a couple achievements this time. I can absolutely imagine having runs where I get ZERO new achievements, and just run to get additional HC to make the bigger numbers easier to get.  Right now, I'm running at just under 400 trillion CPS. I figure I'll end up just over that before I reset (the only meaningful boost left is Kitten Managers, who are many many days away).  Remaining achievements:   400 cursors 10 quint from cursors 10 quint from grandmas 10 quad from shipments <-- perhaps the only viable one on this run 100 quad from labs 1 quint from portals 200 time machines 10 quint from time machines 200 condensers 100 quint from condensers 1 sext from prisms 200 of everything 7777 golden cookies click really, really fast reset with 1 sept reset with 1 oct"

So if you increased your HCs by 1 million, you could have increased them by 1,024,690 instead.  Pretty tiny difference."

CookieClicker,3b7ty8,1234abcdcba4321,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:47:53 2015 UTC,I think the DEV dropped the game and there will be no more upgrades.

CookieClicker,3aycto,AvengingWolf,7,Wed Jun 24 14:16:02 2015 UTC,"If it's your first run you should get all the grandmapacolypse upgrades as well as the elder pact 5 times and the elder covenant for the achievements if nothing else.  Edit: More of an explanation of what they're talking about.  The frenzy+lucky combo is what happens when you get a lucky golden cookie while you have a frenzy going on, which happens very often after you've purchase get lucky. Lucky cookies return either 10% of the cookies in your bank or 20 minutes worth of cookies, whichever is lower. The calculation is based on what your current cps is (but isn't affected by wrinklers) so if you get a lucky cookie during a frenzy, the max you get is the equivalent of a 20 minute frenzy, which is pretty significant.  After you've purchased all the grandmapacolypse upgrades, you only get wrath cookies, which don't have frenzies, so you can't get the frenzy+lucky combo. However, you have wrinklers, which seem like they're bad because they reduce your cps, but they're actually really good because they return more cookies than they've wrinkled, and the return increases exponentially with more wrinklers; so if you have the maximum 10 wrinklers, after you pop them all it's as if you had a 6X multiplier. Additionally, wrath cookies have a small chance of producing an elder frenzy, which is 666X for 6 seconds (12 with get lucky)  The debate is whether it's better to have the frenzy+lucky combo or the wrinklers and elder frenzies. I've been doing what the wiki advises and stopped buying them after exotic nuts, because that way you can get all the wrinklers and you get 67% golden cookies and 33% wrath cookies, so you basically get the benefits of both. For your first run though just focus on getting as many achievements as you reasonably can and building up your heavenly chips for your first reset."
CookieClicker,3aycto,mikeyelvis92,3,Wed Jun 24 17:31:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! This was the most succinct and non-convoluted explanation I've heard on this topic. So I should by Communal Brainsweep just to get the various achievements related to the Grandmapacolypse before I reset? Makes sense :)  Again, much appreciated!"
CookieClicker,3aycto,mikeyelvis92,3,Wed Jun 24 23:17:45 2015 UTC,Yes you should. And no problem. The wiki can sometimes be a little too mathy without explaining it very well. It took me forever to figure out what they meant with the math on the wrinkler page.
CookieClicker,3aycto,DragonDabbles,2,Wed Jun 24 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I am on my third reset and I don't like going past Communial Brainsweep, nor even One Mind since I am actively cooking golden cookies thus I get more benefit than just letting it idle with Wrinkles(Which is what you should be doing if you go One Mind)"
CookieClicker,3aycto,mikeyelvis92,4,Wed Jun 24 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"I actively click golden cookies too. If you go past exotic nuts you get more golden cookies than wrath cookies so you still get the frenzy+lucky combos pretty often, plus occasionally you'll get a frenzy+elder frenzy. I find that those plus the wrinklers outweight the negative effects of the ruin and clot. Also, once you get the season switcher you'll need wrinklers to get all the Easter/Halloween cookies."
CookieClicker,3aycto,DragonDabbles,2,Wed Jun 24 20:23:47 2015 UTC,"When do you get season switcher? I decided to get elder pact, and use elder pledge 5 times to get the achievements this run, the next few runs I will do to get the reset at certain number of cookies baked."

CookieClicker,3aycto,DragonDabbles,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:35:05 2015 UTC,"From what I've read don't buy it if you are idling a lot. Since the wrinklers give a lot of investment when you pop them after a while. But only do so to get an upgrade that will give you more cookies per second than popping them in the long run, the only worth ones are prism and kitten upgrades. If you are more active communial brainsweep and actively clicking golden cookies and wrinkled cookies is better due to getting the lucky Frenzy which gives you x777 cookie click power + lucky upgrades make the cookie stay on the screen six times as long if you get them all and last six times as long."
CookieClicker,3ayrqe,DragonDabbles,2,Wed Jun 24 16:11:17 2015 UTC,"I reset at around 20% CBTG compared to CBAT after around 5k HCs, and also an early reset at 5k-5.1k. Reset A little less often before then."

CookieClicker,3ayrqe,HOLDINtheACES,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:51:44 2015 UTC,"Good point.  Though if you go long enough, the previous cookies baked all time becomes insignificant.  But yeah, I'm just confused and thinking wrong."
CookieClicker,3ayrqe,quarkwright2000,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:24:06 2015 UTC,I have 3.2 quadrillion baked all time. So 10% of 3.2 would be 0.32. So I'd reset when I get to 320 trillion cookies baked this game?
CookieClicker,3ayrqe,quarkwright2000,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:54:15 2015 UTC,"If you had 45 heavenly chips starting this round, you started at about 850 T baked all time.  So if you reset at 3.2 Quad, you'll end up just short of 80 cookies - really good for this round IMHO.  This is a good place to check: http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Heavenly_Chips  It even has a calculator.  At this stage in your game, you may want to aim for 30% or more of your baked-all-time number.  Right now I have over 16 mil HC, 139 Sept baked all-time, and resetting at 10% (around 14 Sept baked this game) still gets me about 1/2 mil HC.  It takes me about 8-10 days between resets. It just depends how long you want to wait between resets and how slow the end-game gets as you wait."

CookieClicker,3a89wf,cadika_orade,2,Fri Jun 19 19:17:46 2015 UTC,I used to have a more mechanical approach. Resize the window so that it is as small as the cookie. Bring the mouse over the cookie. Switch off numlock. Press both the keys for click and double-click together (5 and +). And keep them pressed for a high number of continuous clicks. And then I would way those keys down and leave them pressed overnight.  The resizing of the window allowed any golden cookies to also appear in that window area with a very high chance of getting clicked by the mouse.  Worked perfectly.

CookieClicker,39y5zx,ubermonkey,8,Mon Jun 15 19:21:33 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry too much about trying to optimize the chocolate egg to the level you're worrying about.  The chocolate egg is only 5% returns which is tiny when you consider that heavenly chips grow with the sqrt() of your CBAT.  If you spend 100% of your cookies on buildings and then sell them all at the end and compare that to spending 0% of your cookies or buildings (or a negligible amount) the different is:  sqrt(n*1.05)/sqrt(n*(1+(0.05*0.575))/1) = 1.01027527738   Which is a 1.02% difference in HCs.  So the optimal chocolate cookie strategy versus worst chocolate cookie strategy has only a 1% difference in HCs gained.

CookieClicker,39lilk,bmenrigh,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:02:57 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by ""legitimately"".  2.2 Qi is quite close to the maximum I estimate could have been achieved by now.  I'm at 1.723 Qi and the maximum I think could have realistically been reached by a human playing every day, paying moderate attention 16 hours a day, since the release of the game is around 2.1 to 2.4 Qi.  Basically I'm taking my current CPS and adding in the time between when the game was released and I started playing adding another boost for someone even more dedicated than myself that basically never misses a golden cookie for 16 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Of course I'm assuming zero automation at all.  No autolclicker.  No add-on.  No sound alert when a golden cookie appears.  No automatic golden cookie clicking.  Nothing but the vanilla game (which is what I play).  For the beta my estimate is around 7 nonillion / sec."
CookieClicker,39lilk,TheGhostOfDRMURDER,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:45:34 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that there were several periods where it was significantly easier to make cookies. Heavenly chips used to be significantly more effective, and cookie chains were at one point grossly overpowered, for instance. And then optimal resetting is basically a crap-shoot, so you could wind up with vastly different due to minor variances in reset times over the course of a few years."
CookieClicker,39lilk,bmenrigh,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point about cookie chains.  I started after they'd already been fixed and in extrapolating additional time, I'm assuming no such sources of big improvements over the way the game is currently.  If someone exploited the crap out of early game balance issues they could probably be quite a bit further along.  I disagree about optimal reset times though.  With a basic calculator it's not hard to get pretty close to optimal.  I think two smart people with a calculator and a good understanding of game mechanics are going to end up very close to each other in reset strategy and the difference between them will just be a few % of time played and HCs are basically proportional sqrt(time played) so small percent variations in time played due to different strategies end up being even smaller variations in HCs."

If you reset once with 500 Qu cookies baked, then reset again with another 500 Qu baked, You will have HC based on resetting with 1 Qi baked.    The ideal time to reset is arguable, but generally your first reset you want to get somewhere between 50-200 HC. After that you generally go for at least doubling your HC each run, and as you get farther you will increase HC by a lower and lower percentage up until Kitten Managers. (I never bothered playing past that)    One good way to figure when to reset is to figure out what the last big upgrade you want to go for is and just go a good way past that.    heres a chart and a calculator   http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Heavenly_Chips"

Last I checked Cookie Monster still used a simple production/cost formula to determine best purchase, whereas Frozen Cookies factors in the time it takes to earn enough cookies to buy the building/upgrade. The result is that it will buy less efficient but much cheaper things before saving for the big upgrades, ultimately getting to the big ones sooner."

I hit both during a long con call a couple hours ago, but I've been too busy to finish out the run (sell everything, pop my wrinklers, buy the choco egg, and reset) and start over. Maybe later."
CookieClicker,38xb4e,GaryLLLL,4,Sun Jun 7 17:11:33 2015 UTC,It's hard to respond to all the comments in this post but just about everything is wrong.
CookieClicker,38xb4e,jarluch,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:26:57 2015 UTC,yeah I agree - it's like everyone is talking about Bicentennial and OP asked about Kitten Managers...
CookieClicker,38xb4e,drrhythm2,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:51:34 2015 UTC,"OP - I'll answer just because the thread seems to have gone off topic...  I first got Kitten Managers with somewhere around 50000 Heavenly Cookies, but it took a LONG time. I'm not sure if I would recommend trying for a few more first... Once you do get them, REALLY build up some more HC's before resetting. I think I doubled them to 100k on my first reset and it STILL felt like it took forever to get back to them (Kitten Mangers). Then I went to 130k HC's before reset, and it still felt like it took a long time (a few days of fairly active play) to get back to them. Now I'm waiting until over 200k HC's to see if I can get back to the KM's at least pretty fast.   If it helps I'm 114 hrs into a reset that I started with about 130k HC's, and I just now would be able to reset with about 201k. I'll wait until this afternoon after work and hopefully reset with about 205k and see how that looks for getting back to KM's. Right now I'm at 2.636 quadrillion per second with 167 Prisms. From what most people have said you need over 1 million (maybe 1.5 million) HC's to make a run at 200 prisms and bicentennial.   EDIT: it's also on this run that I got most of the bigger achievements for ""bake at least XXX cookies with whatever buildings - those are all done now)."

CookieClicker,38xb4e,wacker64,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:49:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what any of the add-ons suggest, but what I do is buy up to 130 Prisms, and then buy Kitten Managers.  I feel like that's the magic number where you're better off just storing up cookies and trying to hit golden cookie combos, rather than investing it back into Prisms.  If it's taking you too long to get to 130 Prisms and you feel like you ought to reset instead, go for it.  But if you can get to 130 Prisms and hang out for a while, stop making Prisms and grab KM - it will basically double your income.  If it's your first time getting it, I'd recommend waiting a little longer than normal before resetting, since resetting means you'll have to face the climb to get it again.  The same is true when you eventually get to 200 Prisms: you don't want to get to 200, then immediately buy the upgrade and reset - you can let the virtually-double income set in for a while to boost your HC before restarting."
CookieClicker,38xb4e,RandomPrecision1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:14:22 2015 UTC,"My advice is find the payoff time with wrinklers (cookies for prism/cps of a prism*6) and multiply that by your current cps*6 (the *6 is for when you don't have any wrinklers, and it approximates the cookie multiplier for wrinklers). If the payoff time*cps*6 is less than 829 quintillion, that means that it'll be better to by prisms as they will pay off before you will get kitten managers."
CookieClicker,38xb4e,ShadowNinja002,-2,Tue Jun 9 15:13:10 2015 UTC,"DON'T get the elder covenant, stick too one mind always. Elder covenant removes over 600% cps. 150 of everything past portals will be absolutely fine. 200 prisms is wayyyyy out of reach, dont worry bout it. that is my advice for you."
CookieClicker,38xb4e,wacker64,2,Mon Jun 8 01:39:17 2015 UTC,"Elder covenant only removes 5% of your Cps, and having 200 prisms is important to get the achievement Bicentennial, and unlocks a new upgrade that doubles the prism efficiency, which does a number on your Cps. I once went from 3 Quintilian Cps to 7 Quintilian Cps from that upgrade alone. I then went on to get 1 septillion cookies."
CookieClicker,38xb4e,aadesousa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:59:17 2015 UTC,"Well now I'm getting conflicting advice from you and /u/aadesousa.   Particularly when idling, my understanding was to NOT get the elder covenant, and let the Wrinklers do their thing. As when you eventually click them, you get significantly more cookies than if they weren't there.  But aadesousa is claiming they somehow do more harm than good?"
CookieClicker,38xb4e,aadesousa,2,Mon Jun 8 02:13:05 2015 UTC,"It is my personal belief that what i said was true, I welcome any correction by /u/wacker64 or anybody else. You could probably look in the wiki, but i am lazy and going to bed soon."
CookieClicker,38xb4e,Beat93,2,Mon Jun 8 02:49:29 2015 UTC,"/u/wacker64 is right. You've misunderstood the way Wrinklers work. They only ""eat"" cookies as far as the game's flavour is concerned. In practice, it's more accurate to say that they store cookies. When you pop a Wrinkler, all the cookies it stored up until then are immediately added to your bank with interest. The bonus upgrade you mentioned in another post is a boost to the interest rate.  The above - combined with the way Wrinklers work whenever there's more than one attached to the big cookie at the same time - means that letting 10 Wrinklers be active at the same time effectively provides a 6x boost (more if you have Wrinklerspawn) to your CPS. In other words, the Grandmapocalypse blows Elder Covenant out of the water for idling.  Elder Covenant should only be purchased once (for the achievement) and then never again after that."
CookieClicker,38xb4e,aadesousa,2,Mon Jun 8 10:57:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for clearing that up!
CookieClicker,38xb4e,ForlornSpirit,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:07:16 2015 UTC,"Trust this guy hes right. You definately dont want to get 200 before managers. I dont think i got to 150 before managers my last run. Im not sure about CPS, however im vaguely remembering being in the 70,000-80,000 Heavenly Chip range. hope that helps.    Also, yeah never use elder covenant. Even if you hate Grandmacalypse for being creepy and depressing, you are still better off just using pledge over and over.    Edit - I found an old save file and checked it, I was at 72,000 HC when I decided to save for Managers."
CookieClicker,38xb4e,aadesousa,-2,Mon Jun 8 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"try to get 200 of everything, and get the upgrades for them that double their efficiency, until it takes too long to upgrade them. You might also want to reset until your Cps is a few quadrillion, than idle overnight, and buy it when you wake up. Also, if you are in grandmapocolypse, get elder covenant, 5% of your Cps isnt that much. and it is better for idling in the long run. You will make back that Cps with all the upgrade you can get after when you get two hundred of everything. When you get 200 prisms, and unlock the upgrade that doubles their efficiency, you are home free, and this basically triples you Cps."
CookieClicker,38xb4e,aadesousa,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:29:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. But maybe I'm misunderstanding something major about the game -- why would I want to buy the Elder Covenant for idling? I thought you end up getting way more cookies if you let all the wrigglers do their thing, because they each give you a 10% bonus when you finally click them."
CookieClicker,38xb4e,bmenrigh,-2,Sun Jun 7 22:22:14 2015 UTC,"I think (I may be wrong) wrinklers still ""eat"" some of the cookies. So i think they just take 10% less, but still take some."

CookieClicker,38mouo,ubermonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:03:16 2015 UTC,"I'm only a few runs in compared to some of you, but I've been resetting when Cookie Monster tells me my new HC income bonus is > 100%, i.e. when I'll double my output. By this point, I'm usually out of viable upgrades while still being a long way from building-count achievements, so I reset.  When I've done this in the past, I've been able to get to very nearly my prior endgame output within a few hours, which is nice.  I get that this won't be viable for much longer but so far I've reset at:   250 HC 642 HC (reached 500 billion CPS) 2,003 HC (3 trillion) 4,486 HC (7.9 trillion) 10,311 HC (17 trillion)   My current run is reaching the end, though, well before reaching this prior milestone. Since this run was the first to qualify for both Season Switcher and the Macarons, I had more upgrades to buy, too. Consequently, right now I have fewer buildings as on my last run, but way more upgrades (187 vs 144), so my output is nearly 3x as high: 50.946 trillion cps vs. 17.  However, even though I'm just about out of upgrades (I have 16 Easter cookies to go, and Kitten Managers are still too far away, but everything else I have), my expected HC bonus is still under 40%. I reckon I'll let it idle a few more days.   My thought was that, in doing so, I might pick up more achievements, but I think I may be tapped on that front this time around. The building output ones (except for farm) are really far out there -- I might get the factory one if I idle a for another two weeks, but the rest are out of reach.   The building count ones are even more insane. I still need 200 time machines, and 150 & 200 condensers and prisms, but the only one of those worth entertaining at all is 150 condensers.   If my math is right, from 135 I need a little under 30 quint for that, which is doable. Getting to 200 from 150 will require 37 sextillion, so LOLNO.  200 time machines (I have 150 now) will cost me more cookies than I've ever baked (1.1x1021). 150 prisms -- I have 129 -- is a little less (6x1020), but obviously 200 prisms is crazypants (6.9x1023)."

On my previous run, I reset with 125 prisms, producing 17.156 trillion per second, after 11 days. At that point, I had no upgrades left to buy that would materially impact output (except, of course, Kitten Managers, which were absurdly out of reach).

With the wrinklers it would take about 40 (Estimation is just a guess, if someone would like to correct me on this) Now this is still out of reach and if you are not clicking any cookies so maybe one or two more resets would be useful if you are resetting when your CPS doubles (at that point it might take a week) Clicking GC will help, but omnipotent went into that so I won't mention it."

In this stage it might be smart to slow down on resetting, and stay on the same session with managers for longer, because the time it takes to get the managers isn't generammy worth it yet. Try to boost your HCs while you have them, since it should go pretty fast like that.  For active play, go all the way in grandmacolypse, get all seasonal upgrades, and keep pledging. No covenant, pledes. The increasing cost of pledges stays irrelevant, since it caps at a couple of trillion, which is way below your cps. This way you won't have to rely on eldeer luck, and gives you a better chance at x7 + x777 clicking power, with the added bonus that almost every reindeer will be x7. Especially with frequent clicking/autoclicker this'll be worth  it even more."
CookieClicker,382luy,HairyOreoFilling,3,Mon Jun 1 12:10:08 2015 UTC,"A good way to look at it early game, is looking at achievements. Achievements will stay when you reset, so the more you can get before resetting, the quicker your cps will go up when you reach the kitten upgrades.  Before the first reset, it might be an interesting idea to get 100 of every building, except for prisms. That way you get a nice base of achievements, without it taking too long to reset. That's how I did it, and ended up resetting at about 600 HCs.  Do note though that when to reset is a very subjective question, there is no absolute ""right"" answer to it."
CookieClicker,382luy,NuestroTiempo,2,Mon Jun 1 13:27:11 2015 UTC,Where do I see how much HC I will get?
CookieClicker,382luy,FirstTribute,3,Mon Jun 1 15:38:20 2015 UTC,"You can do the math on the wiki, use an addon like Cookie Monster, or export your savegame string into the Cookies Calculator (on the sidebar) and look at the ""prestige"" button/tab at the bottom.

CookieClicker,382luy,FirstTribute,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:56:06 2015 UTC,"before you reset, make a note of the CPS you're currently getting, then find out how long it takes you to get back up to that cps after resetting.   take that amount of time into concideration when you decide to reset again."
CookieClicker,382luy,LXicon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"I reset the first time at about 250 HC, which made for a pretty spirited second run.   I reset the second time at 642, the third at 2003, and the fourth at 4486.  Each of those produced AT LEAST a 100% bump in post-reset output, which is a fine goal until you reach a point where acquiring HC takes too long for that to be viable.  In any case, though, you'll reach a stage of your given runthrough where meaningful additional progress in CPS is basically impossible without very, very long periods of idling or insanely attentive active play. At this stage, you're probably pretty close to your HC goal, and should focus on bagging additional achievements.  Right now, I've got 122, counting 3 shadow achievements (so 119 base game achievements). I can't really go much farther in a reasonable amount of time, so when I get some time later today I'll reset it again. Cookie Monster says that, at my new HC level, I'll be at nearly 120% of my current output, which will make a few more later-game achievements possible.  If you filter out seasonals (which I can't get on this run) and building-output ones (which require higher output), then what I have left are pretty much all out of reach short of many more days of idle play at my current 17-and-change trillion per second output:   300 & 400 cursors 200 time machines 150 condensors 200 condensors 150 prisms 200 prisms 150 upgrades 150 of everything 200 of everything 7777 golden cookies click really, really fast   plus the last 3 ""reset with..."" achievements, about which WAT."

CookieClicker,37yvjf,ral315,5,Sun May 31 16:50:11 2015 UTC,"There is a limit, but not in the way you're probably thinking. The limit is defined by how high the number of cookies made goes. Since it's created by a computer there is a limit to how precise a certain variable can go and a limit to how high the number can go because of this precision. The number would then be the maximum number of cookies that can be made plugged into the HC equation. I assume since doubles (a type of variable in computer science) is 8 bytes, so that means it's 64 bits and every bit is a binary number 0 or 1. Then the range of minimum to max number of cookies made is 0 to (264)-1. This is a guess based on my knowledge of computer science but I would need to know more about the type of code and variables that are used to give a more precise answer. Probably no human will ever reach the cap though so you can assume there is no cap unless you cheat in cookies."
CookieClicker,37yvjf,rohtarozer,3,Sun May 31 23:02:55 2015 UTC,Doubles don't store numbers the same way integers do.  Doubles have sign and exponant bits and can store integers exactly up to about 256 and then start losing integer precision all the way up to about 21024

Even Prisms, above a certain level, increase your output by less than 1%.  For me, at that point, all I have left to buy is whatever-comes-after-One-Mind (which I won't buy because I'm playing at least somewhat actively) and Kitten Managers (which are so expensive they're way way out of reach).  When I get there, I take stock of what achievements I can realistically get on the run, and go for those and/or an HC count before resetting.   Early on, it's reasonable to look for a 100% HC bonus (which takes more than 2x your prior HC, because of the complex math involved). I've done that so far (my fifth run, started yesterday, involves 4486 HC, up from 2003 on the 4th run), but I see why I won't be able to use that as a rule forever: the HC get harder and harder to get.

CookieClicker,36wcow,ubermonkey,1 point,Fri May 22 19:36:43 2015 UTC,"The right time to reset is highly dependant on where in the game you are.  The two big bumps to production are Kitten Managers and 200 Prisms.  If you can't reach them then you can reset more often to boost production with HCs.  Once you can reach them, you have to think about how long it would take you after resetting to re-get them.  I'm very far into the game so I'm approaching a point where the Century Egg boosts my production faster than gaining HCs.  In my current game it has taken me 35 days of gameplay for a 10.8% increase in HCs if I were to reset.  Eventually it will take me more than 100 days to increase my HCs by 10% so the optimal strategy will be to do 100+ day runs to get the full benefit from the Century Egg."

CookieClicker,36wcow,09jtherrien,1 point,Sat May 23 04:58:31 2015 UTC,"In the Live version, I reset when buying things is too difficult to wait or achievements are too out of reach, but I let it run in the background a while before resetting to accumulate as much as I possibly can. I'm also currently semi-holding out for the beta version to go live, but also willing to consider a reset if it seems too far out.  In the Beta version, very similar, except much faster to produce results (yes, I'm running both versions of the game at the same time). It didn't take long after importing my live save to beta to where I've got 400 cursors/grandma's and 200 of everything else, all the upgrades I can (one bank upgrade won't show), achievements (except black cats paw), and am just letting it ride for a bit (I'm waiting an extra day few hours to get negative void (the nonillion shadow achievement), after saving and buying the chocolate egg). After I ascend again, I'll have to set goals to work for since I can easily get everything else in less than a day."
CookieClicker,36wcow,VashTS240,1 point,Sun May 24 11:26:14 2015 UTC,"I usually wait until I'll have 2number of resets so far HC upon reset before I do until I reach 1 million upon reset.  Then I just reset every million or when the current run is a week old, whichever comes first."

CookieClicker,36m9fa,jarluch,6,Wed May 20 13:28:50 2015 UTC,"Obliterate is the end goal for pretty much everyone I think. Personally I'm currently working on bicentennial, but that's just a stepping stone. I don't play beta because it feels too easy to me."
CookieClicker,36m9fa,sgtpeppers508,4,Wed May 20 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"I'm playing both live and beta too.  For live my goal is kinda to get Obliterate but realistically it isn't going to happen.  For beta my medium-term goals are for 600 grandmas and 10 nonillion cookies / sec.  I probably won't reach this before Orteil releases the new version or new beta.  I suppose if I'm being honest with myself, I'm just playing to play."
CookieClicker,36m9fa,bmenrigh,3,Wed May 20 13:41:26 2015 UTC,No goal for me. It just gives me something to do when I'm doing something else. Although I will say my overall goal is to discover all the reincarnation upgrades (I'm playing in beta)

CookieClicker,36m9fa,smopecakes,2,Thu May 21 00:12:41 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely achievement hunting now - Walk the Planck is next, for sure. I don't know if Black Cat's Paw (5/7 of the way there!), Transcendence, or Rise and Shine + Bicentennial will come after that. After those three... I mean, geez. Dr T. and Obliterate, I guess. Those will take a very long time, though."

CookieClicker,36m9fa,Menolith,2,Thu May 21 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"I'm just trying to clear the achievement list and have all the upgrades in a run. It's easy enough to do in the Beta, because the Beta is broken as hell, and manageable in the dungeon beta with patience because all the thresholds are lower (you don't need 7,777 golden cookies, nor do you need more than a hundred of most , so you can hit those caps much earlier).  As for vanilla, I need about eleven more prisms, the 400 cursors, and reseting with a Septillion and an Octillion (which will be a long while when I'm only making around 16Quadrillion per second). Not really worried about the Shadow achievements (Nonillion can do one, and I've tried and tried to no avail to get the third speed run badge without any luck)."
CookieClicker,36m9fa,Nambot,2,Fri May 22 06:46:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I need Dr. T, Octillion, and Nonillion. After that, I'll take a screenshot, and a save file. Then I'll start on beta. That's my goal."
CookieClicker,36m9fa,Magnamune,1 point,Tue May 26 10:59:26 2015 UTC,What's the difference between live and beta?
CookieClicker,36m9fa,09jtherrien,2,Sat May 23 01:02:49 2015 UTC,"Live is the official release, version 1.0466. The beta, version 1.0501, has vastly different (and unintentionally overpowered) heavenly chips, as well as a few other changes that haven't made it into the live version yet. You can look on your stats screen to see which version you're playing."
CookieClicker,36mm9a,Fluffy_ribbit,13,Wed May 20 14:24:38 2015 UTC,Click the cookie 999 sextillion more times.
CookieClicker,36mm9a,cards_dot_dll,2,Thu May 21 00:33:52 2015 UTC,Sure. I'll see you something like a quadrillion years after the heat death of the universe.
CookieClicker,36mm9a,grayrocks,2,Sat May 23 08:11:59 2015 UTC,I usually reset whenever my new heavenly chip count would be double what it is now.
CookieClicker,36mm9a,DreamGirly_,3,Wed May 20 14:42:38 2015 UTC,"So that's like, once every half year? I'm at 554,778 HC right now, and when I reset I will gain 158,213. This session has been running for 1,343 hours (that's about 56 full days), and I have only baked 100 sextillion cookies this game, 250 all time. It would take 721 more days to reach 1 septillion cookies baked in this game, and although I would have 712,991 HC if I reset now and I get a new one every 50 seconds or so, it would still take me about 1257 hours to make the remaining 87009 HC to get to 800k (at 1 chip every 52 seconds). That's again about 52 days.  The new update prolly is supposed to make it easier, I have had a beta game running for a long time without doing anything with it and it's at 500 sextillion cookies baked right now (in 6115 hours! That's 255 days... I do have the 200 time machines and antimatter condensers though.  I read here that we should maybe get to 1,4M HC before getting 200 prisms and (although I have no idea how many HC YellowOnion has) that we should aim for a 25% increase in chips.   With almost 555k HC I am now at almost 14,5 quadrillion cookies a second, I have wrinklers active and I have every upgrade (also the ones unlockable in specific seasons) except for the chocolate egg. I got both 200 time machines and 200 antimatter condensers a long time ago though... I might have gotten 200 time machines over 9 months ago, and antimatter condensers a while after that."
CookieClicker,36mm9a,drrhythm2,2,Wed May 20 16:17:32 2015 UTC,So you think reset when you can gain 25% HC? I've been trying for more than that but the game slows down so much at the end...
CookieClicker,36mm9a,smopecakes,2,Wed May 20 22:29:28 2015 UTC,"Around a half million I'd say reset for between 10 to 25% more. Usually the more actively you play the more often you can reset (ie: at 10%) but it's also about how long you want to go - I just wouldn't go for less than 10%. I like to go more like 20 or even a third but that's kind of marathoning it.  I also know of one player who keeps three games open and resets every week, you could use that style to try out resetting at different levels: http://www.reddit.com/r/CookieClicker/comments/346d6s/am_i_the_only_1_left_here_who_think_my_cookies/cqrvb6z"
CookieClicker,36mm9a,V3NOM06,1 point,Thu May 21 00:28:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That's what I was thinking. I mean, you could get lucky with golden cookies. That's really the only way out I can see.  I only have 10% of the HC you have, though."
CookieClicker,36mm9a,jermanis,2,Wed May 20 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"I am in a similar position with 7 sextillion all time, so I am curious to read responses."
CookieClicker,36mm9a,DreamGirly_,2,Wed May 20 16:43:08 2015 UTC,"Frame of reference: I'm at 12 septillion all-time.  I say that not to pat myself on the back, but to make it clear that at the stage of the game I'm at, some things may be different.   How many cursors have you built?  Or, more to the point, which of the ""fingers"" upgrades have you purchased?  In the later game, when you get more and more of the finger upgrades, you will make many more cookies from the Farm through the ""The mouse and cursors gain +800 cookies for every non-cursor object owned"" upgrade than you do from the farms directly.  Not a huge point, but something to do if you want to be optimal.  At the point I'm at in the game, everything from Farm to Alchemy Lab costs about the same... and the Portal is close. I think resetting when your HCs would double should be the longest time that you should wait.  For me, I'm resetting when my HCs would increase by 20-30%... that takes about a month.  The way I look at it, the fundamental principle for when to reset is when are you costing yourself money by not resetting?"
CookieClicker,36mm9a,jermanis,1 point,Wed May 20 17:04:29 2015 UTC,Is there a calculator for HCs up somewhere?  I have 251 cursors. I want to get my 200 time machines up before I push for the upgrade at 280 and the achievement at 300.
CookieClicker,36mm9a,autowikiabot,3,Wed May 20 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"I use this (calculator patsy made) https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/73817062/cookies/cookies.html for everything. It also calculates in how long you'll earn your next Heavenly Chip and how many you would gain / have if you reset at that very moment (provided you freshly imported a save) and if you fill out ""desired chips"" it will tell you how much more you need and how long that is going to take. (save for buildings, except it doesn't tell you how long it will take to get that amount, just how much)"
CookieClicker,36mm9a,DreamGirly_,2,Wed May 20 19:47:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a Cookie Clicker wiki that has this: http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Heavenly_Chips You might find other content on the wiki useful as well.  They go into quite a bit of detail on many aspects of CC."
CookieClicker,36mm9a,jermanis,1 point,Wed May 20 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"Heavenly Chips (from Cookieclicker wikia):       HeavenlyÂ Chips is a ""new game plus"" or ""prestige"" mechanic introduced in Cookie Clicker version 1.035. If you reset your game (via the Reset command on the Menu tab, formerly called Soft Reset) you will gain Heavenly Chips. The amount of Heavenly Chips is dependent on your forfeited cookies of all games. Every reset, the amount of forfeited cookies is incremented by 'cookies baked (this game)', and will match 'cookies baked (all time)' until new cookies are baked. The easiest way to determine how many Heavenly Chips will be earned after a single reset is therefore by taking the difference of the amount of Heavenly Chips before and after the reset. Every Heavenly Chip you own increases your CpS rate by a maximum of +2%. The percentage gained is determined based on your Heavenly Chip potential (increased by 5 ""Heavenly Upgrades"" added in v1.038). Wiping your save (formerly called hard reset) does not activate the Prestige System, and will also wipe your current amount of forfeited cookies and Heavenly Chips. Currently, there is no limit on how many Heavenly Chips you can have.Â   Image i Interesting: Heavenly Calc | Heavenly Cookies | Chip | Crazed chip-spurter    Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Yes, but when is that? I have no way of calculating it, I just start over every now and then and start buying everything and collecting all seasonal upgrades. When that's done, just buy more buildings now and just leave it running until I want to reset again... (which is after a long period of time). I just reset and got 28,5% of my HC, which took me one and a half month. How much HC are you at, now you have reached over a septillion? (I'm at about 740k now)"

And the 'Here you go' Achievement is brilliant xD I just can't wait til it's fixed and goes live
CookieClicker,365z13,morerokk,3,Sat May 16 13:53:45 2015 UTC,Beta does seem slightly slower for the first game but it shouldn't have taken you anywhere near 40 hours of active gameplay to just get ACs.  Do you know about the big boost Grandmas give you?  You should be dumping a ton of cookies in grandmas because each one increases your CPS by 1%
CookieClicker,365z13,bmenrigh,2,Sat May 16 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, I made sure to get lots of grandmas. I have around 180 now, as well as all the grandma building upgrades up to Portals, currently saving up to reach 15 time machines.  Also I'm not actively playing those 40 hours, I'm essentially just browsing, and checking in on the game every 10 minutes or so. I do get plenty of Frenzies."
CookieClicker,365z13,bmenrigh,2,Sat May 16 17:10:57 2015 UTC,Ah good.  I think you should target for resetting at about 100 HCs and on your next game you'll get back up to ACs and beyond much faster.

CookieClicker,365z13,ForlornSpirit,2,Sat May 16 17:05:11 2015 UTC,My comment was much more than a criticism.  I tried to identify a likely overlooked aspect of the gameplay that can increase production a lot.
CookieClicker,365z13,bmenrigh,1 point,Sat May 16 17:31:45 2015 UTC,"I said that I played around 70 hours, 30 of which were AFK. So it's only natural to assume that I actively played for 40 hours total."
CookieClicker,365z13,ForlornSpirit,2,Sat May 16 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"Around 200-250 HC is good for first reset. You might go higher depending on how patient you are, generally you want 100 if you can to get your best pointer upgrade permanent, get the +5% golden cookie upgrade (its something like 5 hc, then dump 100+ into Heavenly Cookies."
CookieClicker,365z13,bmenrigh,2,Sat May 16 16:27:34 2015 UTC,"Heavenly cookies are a poor initial investment.  You can increase your production rate a lot more unlocking the boxes of biscuits and the season switcher.  With 87 chips you can unlock the three boxes, season switcher, and golden cookie upgrade.  The permanent upgrade slots sound great but rapidly become nearly useless.  The only upgrade I benefit from now is Omelet."
CookieClicker,365z13,ForlornSpirit,3,Sat May 16 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"At the point the upgrade slot becomes useless it really doesnt matter anyway since you are resetting every hour or so. After a few resets the perm is great as a free persistent memory. Since Quintillion Fingers gets you 3/4 to prisms in something like 15 minutes i really dont see any way you could argue against it.    As for Seasons vs Cookies you are probably right, but it shouldnt be that big of a deal. Biscuits on the other hand seems dubious."
CookieClicker,365z13,bmenrigh,2,Sat May 16 17:17:34 2015 UTC,"I forgot about the the faster research and faster golden cookie upgrade slots.  You're right, those help too.   Since Quintillion Fingers gets you 3/4 to prisms in something like 15 minutes i really dont see any way you could argue against it.    I just did a test ascend.  I bought a bunch of upgrades for a  few seconds, bought 1 wizard tower, and then bought 1 prism.  Total time was about 10 seconds without clicking the cookie once.   Biscuits on the other hand seems dubious.   In the beta cookie upgrades stack multiplicatively. For the cost of 10 HCs you could bake one Heavenly Cookie (10% additive bonus to prestige multiplier) or unlock a bunch of cookies that all stack multiplicatively.  The 30 HCs are much better spent unlocking the boxes of biscuits than on 3 baking Heavenly Cookies.   At the point the upgrade slot becomes useless it really doesnt matter anyway since you are resetting every hour or so.   At no point in the beta did I ever feel like resetting this rapidly was a good idea.  Usually the time spent to buy one more grandma (a 1% production bonus) is far less than the time you'd have to spend to increase your total HCs by 1%.  If you're resetting too quickly you're never getting your production rate very high which will end up being slower than the bonus from prestige."

I havent played Beta since the few runs I did when it came out. I dont remember how long runs took, I just remember them being very fast.     I just did a test ascend (bought 2 buildings) and immediately was at prism     I'm sorry are you saying you did a test run from a save file you had which had 200-250 hc and no other prestige bonuses, cause that doesnt sound like what you are describing. Of course when you have a metric ton of prestige QF isnt going to be usefull we are talking about a second run here.     Beta upgrade stack Multiplicatively     This seems unlikely to me, got a source?    If you have a save file with 200-250 hc uplaod it to mega and ill do a test run"

Yeah you're right after your first few beta runs you do ascend quite frequently for a while.   Of course when you have a metric ton of prestige QF isnt going to be usefull we are talking about a second run here   Yeah my game has a metric ton (5.885 trillion heavenly cookies) of prestige.  I wasn't talking about the second run either.  I initially said ""The permanent upgrade slots sound great but rapidly become nearly useless."".  I don't think the second run is the time to get a permanent upgrade slot but they are quite useful for a few runs.  I wouldn't go for a permanent slot for octillion fingers over a number of the other upgrades I've already mentioned.  It is a good idea to get it in your first ~500 HCs though.  There just aren't that many resets before octillion fingers is irrelevant because you have so many other upgrades that increase production rapidly.   This seems unlikely to me, got a source?   Check the info tab on beta.  It says ""CpS calculations revamped; cookie upgrades now stack multiplicatively"".  I think this, along with the 1%-per-grandma bonus, are the main reasons beta is so overpowered / unbalanced."

CookieClicker,35sdyc,computerwow,3,Wed May 13 03:28:22 2015 UTC,"As it seems to me:  You'll plateau on reasonable upgrades at a reasonably predictable point. On my first run, I got to about 250 HC and reset, and then reset again with 642, which is the run I'm on now.   I reset the first time because going from 0 HC to 250 is huge.   I reset the second time, having earned 642HC, because I was stalled out. There were no more unlocked upgrades to buy except Kitten Managers, which cost 900 quintillion, and I was only at about 500 billion per second. Do the math.  This time, running with 642HC instead of 250HC, everything's bigger. I'm at that ""nothing but Kitten Managers left"" point, but my rate is now 2.5 trillion per second instead of 500 billion. (About 50% of that is the bump I got from the Prism upgrade that only unlocks when you get the 100th prism.)  900 quint is still too far away, but at 2.5T I can bag a few more achievements -- and therefore more HC and more power from Kittens -- before I reset.  I should have 200 Shipments later this afternoon.   Anyway, the main point is that, as you approach the endgame for your current run, buying buildings becomes more about achievements than about the output gain the building represents. Right now, a single prism is less than 1% of my output, but the next one costs 88 quad. Other buildings are a better buy on a cost-per-output basis, but produce so little extra output that they're hardly worth it except in pursuit of achievements.   Here's a view of my current status, if that's interesting to you."
CookieClicker,35sdyc,ubermonkey,1 point,Thu May 14 20:08:55 2015 UTC,So I'm on my first run with 0 HC and the calculator on the wikia says i'll get 406 when I reset. Should I reset now?
CookieClicker,35sdyc,TheTitanTosser,1 point,Mon May 18 14:39:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say so, depending on your goals and time.  I had about 250 when I reset the first time. Until you're over 1K HC, the answer to ""should I reset now?"" is ""yes"" about 90% of the time, because so many achievements are completely out of your reach. You'll never (essentially) get to 100 prisms without lots of HC, for example.  Once you reset, keep your eye on your achievements, and target them. You'll want more achievements going into each subsequent reset.   Right now, I'm at 6+ Trillion cps, and the only upgrade left is Kitten Managers -- which are, at best, years away. Consequently, my endgame goal now is (a) get more HC and (b) bag more achievements (I'm at 117 now).  I'm running with just over 2,000 HC now, and this run has produced about 900 more. That's useful, but isn't a giant upgrade, so I'll definitely let this run cook a while longer.  Which makes sense, because even though I'm deep into the run I still haven't actually bagged any new achievements yet (well, that's not entirely true; I got Neverclick at the beginning of this run, but you get the idea). I'm on target for 200 labs by tomorrow, and after that probably 150 time machines. Once I get those two things, I'll take stock of where I am HC-wise and consider whether to reset again or just let it roll for a few more days."

I read somewhere that resetting every time you double your HCs is a good ball park figure, and now that I'm approaching 1.6M % multiplier it's working quite nicely but I would highly recommend not reseting too often early as building to an acceptable speed takes quite a while and cuts in to profits."

Ruin is only loses half the cookies you get with a Lucky and it has the same probability as Lucky so the expected value is still positive.  But, where wrath cookies really pay off is the increased chance of a cookie chain, and the x666 elder frenzy.  So stop paying attention to the individual golden/wrath cookie clicks and know that in the long run the wrath cookies are still great.  Also, you probably shouldn't play in full blown grandmapocalypse because 100% wrath cookies isn't so great unless you're syncing with reindeer.

CookieClicker,35n31k,ubermonkey,4,Mon May 11 21:21:20 2015 UTC,I don't remember my HC count when I got it but I do remember Kitten Managers seeming impossibly far away.  Slowly but surely you'll get to a point where it's affordable.  Now when I reset I get Kitten Managers within 30 minutes.  Be sure to bank enough cookies that you can max out your Frenzy + Lucky combos.  That will be your main cookie production method to get you up to Kitten Managers.
CookieClicker,35n31k,bmenrigh,1 point,Mon May 11 21:35:04 2015 UTC,"it seems impossible far away for me,  managed to get to 100 prisms on my 3rd reset though it was slow..... on the add on it says my base is going to go up by 1 tri, to me this doesn't seem good just going up that amount."
CookieClicker,35n31k,GeooooKL,1 point,Mon May 11 21:38:58 2015 UTC,I just imported my game into a different browser and reset to figure out when you get Kitten Managers in relation to Prisms.  It took me 21 minutes to get Kitten Managers.  Once I got to 150 Prisms I banked cookies until I could afford the Kitten upgrade.  At 150 Prisms the cost of Prisms will be 93 qi which is roughly 1/10th of Kitten Managers.  So aim for 150 Prisms and then bank cookies for a few days getting as many Frenzy + Lucky combos as possible until you reach Kitten Managers.

Grinding golden cookies is probably faster, but I was never much of a grinder.  I've picked up 350 additional HC since my reset yesterday (now at 991). I'm increasingly convinced that the job of THIS run is to bag achievements and HC, not necessarily to buy output, because meaningful output gains are getting really expensive.  In the last little bit, I picked up 3 more achievements, starting with 200 factories and 100 ACs. I also bought the upgrades those allowed, which pushed me over 1T cps.  I don't see much ahead at this multiplier other than HC. 4 quad an hour ought to work out to 20+ quad per hour with wrinklers, so I should have a nice pile to spend chasing additional achievements in the morning.

CookieClicker,35n31k,GeooooKL,0,Thu May 14 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"Hi, I am a new guy here too, on my 3rd reset, basically on my first reset I had  like 900 CHIPS, what was a nice boost, in terms of what was happening before took me over 40 hours to get, upon resetting.. my first time, it was a nice boost, and took less time for me to get to my last location took only 2-3 hours then, alot less, anyway to your question, many people will give you different idea's some people say you should reset at 100 HC THEN MAYBE at 200, then 500, then 1000, so on, but others say do it when  double your intake.. so many people have different ways to do it, as I am new like you, I am not someone who can give you so much advice, but basically, only way to reach high end stuff, is to get HC and reset, and basically repeat till you are producing enough, to help you get  what you want.  AND AS FOR THE KM upgrade, I see all the kitten upgrades, but KM is pretty high tier item, as you increase your HC your cookies will increase, and will be quicker to get them."

Playing the same pace I have since the last reset, I should be able to get 400 cursors in a little under a year (need to bake a little over 184 septillion more) so maybe just hit more Golden Cookies to speed it up, and fewer resets... unless there's some shortcut I don't know about. 1 nonillion is about five and a quarter years away, at this pace.  I calculated getting to 300 prisms too. That's 4413 years if I play with the same speed that I have since the last reset... might not be able to finish that one."

From the looks of it, I click golden cookies much more actively than you do so it'll take you longer.  I'd say your ready for a run as long as you can focus on golden cookies better.  Nobody has gotten 1 Octillion cookies baked all time yet (without cheating), much less in a single game.  I estimate Paulygon104 probably has between 700 and 900 sp cookies baked all time.  I'm at 443 sp baked all time.  Getting 1 oct in a single game would take me around 1.5 years."

CookieClicker,35g8ll,Vic_B,1 point,Mon May 11 22:06:35 2015 UTC,"If you haven't cheated at all (no automation, click bots, building buying, etc.) then your game is probably in the top 5 completely vanilla non-cheating games.  I see you have the ""Cheated Cookies"" shadow achievement.  What did you do to get that? Whether someone has cheated or not is somewhat based on trust so nobody can be certain who is or isn't cheating / using automation.  That said, there is one person I know (Paulygon104) with a game ahead of mine that I believe is completely vanilla.  I haven't seen anyone else with a game as far along as you that looks to be playing completely vanilla."
CookieClicker,35g8ll,targumon,1 point,Mon May 11 22:30:51 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are a few quiet players out there like me. A friend of mine started around the same time and he is about 60 quad cps ahead of me last time I asked him. We've both been playing since the day it came out, but then we did a hard reset both of us shortly after. My PC stopped working for a while and he got way ahead of me, and I don't think I've caught up with him ever again :). We both play completely without anything other than the game and our mouse. :) However, we did do quick cheats just to get those shadow (non-milk) achievements right at the beginning. I don't even remember exactly what it was we did, probably some console cheat to spawn a cookie or something. That was like a year and a half ago now."
CookieClicker,35g8ll,targumon,1 point,Tue May 12 06:12:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone has gotten the 1 nonillion reset achievement without add ons yet.  There is no real secret other than clicking more golden cookies.  My own rule of thumb is that actively clicking those cookies is a 50-60 times multiplier over idling.  Also, don't reset too often.  Many people optimize raising their CPS as high as possible, but most achievements and especially the last two are based off cookies baked.  It does not make sense to run 10% of a marathon, then go back to the starting line for in exchange for a 5% speed increase.  The big wrinkle to that analysis is how valuable is Christmas season?  If you accept the last two achievements will be multiple month marathons, you probably will not be able afford to buy Christmas each time it expires if you idle while it is active."
CookieClicker,35g8ll,Vic_B,1 point,Sun May 10 09:36:12 2015 UTC,"Why would I need to buy Christmas season several times? Have I missed something strategical?  The resets gave me a huge boost in cps up until a few weeks ago, so I think it was wise to keep doing it until then. The last reset took much longer (I reset when it gives me 1M extra HC) so I think that it's probably about time to stop them."

For the two perm upgrades, I suggest selecting: 1. Prism - grandma upgrade (an extreme boost when you buy the first prism). 2. Octillion fingers (+5mil per object) to kickstart every future run.    It's smooth sailing from there.  Once you get the 3rd unlockable - put the most expensive prism upgrade you've unlocked, and for the 4th - faster research."

Is it worth playing throught the pain or prestiging?   Also side question cause i'm a scrubbadoodle like that <3  Lets say i prestige once and get 1 heavenly chip, and then prestige again and get 1 for that will i end up with 2? Or does it just ""fully"" reset everytime? :3"
CookieClicker,34u5os,Archerofyail,8,Mon May 4 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"It surely can't have too much of an impact   An add-on I'm using says that it'll increase my CPS by 50%, and it's the last milk upgrade. As for prestige, it does add on, it's based on your total cookies baked, though the amount of cookies you need for each heavenly chip increases the more you get."

CookieClicker,34w80f,smopecakes,1 point,Tue May 5 02:56:09 2015 UTC,soo what one is the most recent? beta or normal?
CookieClicker,34w80f,RandomPrecision1,1 point,Tue May 5 03:39:54 2015 UTC,The actual game has been updated more recently than the beta.
CookieClicker,34w80f,Dor_Min,2,Tue May 5 03:49:41 2015 UTC,"No it hasn't. The live game is v.1.0466, the beta is v.1.0501. I would always strongly recommend sticking to the live game, however, as the beta has some balance issues that result in far too many cookies spoiling the fun."
CookieClicker,34w80f,RandomPrecision1,2,Tue May 5 22:12:25 2015 UTC,"1.0466 came out after 1.0501.  1.0501 has been on the beta page for ~8 months - the live version was on 1.0465 at that time.  The last patch to live was mostly just a fix to automatically switch seasons, but it came out a few months after the last beta update."
CookieClicker,34w80f,genericJohn,1 point,Tue May 5 22:29:26 2015 UTC,They are really two different games v 1.0466 is last version that will play like you are used to. Beta has serious bugs -- new upgrades and features that are currently off by orders of magnitude -- and you can readily amass cookie amounts that exceed Octillions of cookies.
