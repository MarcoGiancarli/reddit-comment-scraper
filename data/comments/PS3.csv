PS3,3e0goo,anh86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:54 2015 UTC,Used a DS4 for about a week and returned it. I may be a minority but I don't care for it I like my DS3 much better. But I also don't have big hands which from what I read those are the ones who benefit from it the most.
PS3,3e0goo,lazav000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:20:57 2015 UTC,I try to use my ds4 on the ps3 as much as possible but then I run into a game like fallout new Vegas that doesn't fully support it and its back to the ds3 which is actually still okay
PS3,3e0goo,IcyWolfosKelsos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:10:56 2015 UTC,"Is there a way to get it to work completely? I tried to use it, some games seemed to work beautiful (like Far Cry 3) and others didn't work at all. After using the DS4 for 6-7 months I just can't go back to the DS3, the difference is night and day."
PS3,3e0goo,3vyn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:33:51 2015 UTC,"It's gimmicky sort of, tried to play Dirt 3 with the DS4 and it appeared that the triggers work only digitally (fully on/off) which was a bummer. Will try it in GT6 and check if it's really digital only.   Short story: it's a barely supported gimmick in my opinion, not worth it"
PS3,3e0goo,IcyWolfosKelsos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:54:49 2015 UTC,I still use the DS3 since it's fully supported in every game. The DS4 is a better controller in every way except battery life but I still use the DS3 when playing the PS3.
PS3,3e3dfw,Muldoon713,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:54 2015 UTC,Hold up? not bad actually. One of the few movie licensed games that actually is pretty good. Graphics of course are ps2 level but it actually has aged pretty nicely. Rockstar did a good job trying to implement different missions and gameplay into it. I'd say not grabbing it at that price is foolish. This and Manhunt are among my favorite older RS classics. It definitely captures the feel of the movie and doesn't feel like a cheap cash-in as it immerses you in being one of the warriors.
PS3,3e3dfw,peterkozmd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:09 2015 UTC,"Excellent! Thank you, just picked it up. Really looking forward to some couch co-op with it.  I only vaguely remember playing Manhunt when it first came out. I'll have to give it a revisit."
PS3,3e3dfw,peterkozmd,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:57 2015 UTC,wasn't it single player only? been awhile since i played it  regardless nice game and worth grabbing
PS3,3e0odn,gomer11,2,Tue Jul 21 01:31:48 2015 UTC,I would like to get a copy but it is more than I would pay.  Endless ocean was quite good.
PS3,3e0odn,philbertagain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:47 2015 UTC,I enjoyed Endless Ocean too but I no longer have a Wii. Maybe I'll look into getting one used for cheap.
PS3,3e0odn,Pyramat,2,Tue Jul 21 12:49:51 2015 UTC,I have a copy that I bought on eBay a few years ago for $150. I personally loved the game but I'm really into marine life and wildlife in general so take that for what it's worth. I doubt you'll be able to find it anywhere for less than $150 as it's been out of print for a long time now and not many copies were made to begin with. If anything it's only going to get more expensive.
PS3,3e0odn,philbertagain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:49:45 2015 UTC,"Can you offer a comparion between this and the earlier games in the series,endless ocean 1 or 2,everblue , tresures of the deep, b.l.u.e or even Ecco? Really any other scuba/sub adventue game."
PS3,3e0odn,Billybobbean,2,Tue Jul 21 20:18:37 2015 UTC,Unfortunately its fairly well know that its a rare variant of the game so it'll be very hard to find it for a decent price. The only luck I've found in getting foreign games cheaper is to use sites based in the region where the games were originally released.   In this case I'd see if you can use some of the sites that can purchase items from Asian auction sites and forward them to you.   EDIT: www.taobao.com is one of the bigger auction sites and there are plenty of agents who can buy from there and send the item to you
PS3,3e0odn,SeeminglyRacist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:33:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for that info. I will give that website a look.
PS3,3e0odn,SeeminglyRacist,2,Tue Jul 21 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"I have played the English version. I spent more than I'd like to admit, but I did play through quite a bit of it. The English is very readable, although there are some engrish type of mistakes. The game is very slow paced which gives it a relaxing feel. The music is relaxing. The atmosphere is relaxing. More than half of the gameplay is you searching for certain fish to advance, but you can also take screenshots in game and save them to your PS3. The other part of the gameplay is communicating with the fish. Yup, took me for surprise, but you actually get to play a Simon says type of game with the fish.   The story is a type of mystery, and there only seemed to be 3 characters including yourself. One of the biologist disappeared in his submarine, and that is part of the mystery. I never actually finished the game so I don't know if it had a satisfying ending. There is a lot of reading.   As for the price, good luck finding a cheap copy online. Everyone seems to know its value because of its rarity."
PS3,3e0odn,Citadel_97E,2,Tue Jul 21 09:39:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it sounds exactly like what I am looking for. Basically Endless Ocean for the PS3. Thanks for sharing your experience and thoughts. You say you never finished it. Did you end up selling it?"
PS3,3e0odn,Billybobbean,2,Tue Jul 21 12:52:35 2015 UTC,"No, I still own it. It's still part of my collection. :) One day I'll get back to it. There is some DLC available for it, although it's only available on the Japanese PlayStation store."
PS3,3dzcus,antftw1,9,Mon Jul 20 19:31:25 2015 UTC,"I snagged a refurb off of newegg last year for $99. As others have said, as a 24'' monitor and especially for a ps3, it has vibrant colors and is nice and bright. For the few 3D games, it works with the glasses, and supports the split screen-less local multiplayer for the handful of games that released that can do it. The speakers are about average for built in ones compared to a cheaper small TV (if you have a proper audio system, I'd recommend using that, I have the video going to it, and output audio via the multi-AV connector to a stereo speaker system via RCA) , and there's a setting that will turn it on if you have the system hooked up via HDMI. (Not at home and can't remember the name in the menu). Note that the buttons are on the back, and I'd recommend making sure it has a remote because of that."
PS3,3dzcus,scsnse,5,Mon Jul 20 21:33:12 2015 UTC,"I own it. It's a great 24"" display. The HDMI ports are very tight and the screen is susceptible to glare.  For a 24"" screen it's great."
PS3,3dzcus,Tricyclopes,5,Mon Jul 20 20:13:05 2015 UTC,"I have two. One for 4 years and my second one for 2 years and they're awesome! The colors are vibrant and speakers are okay. It starts to crack at higher volume. I had monitors from Dell, LG, Samsung, and Acer and honestly this one is my favorite. and looking to eventually get another one. One bad thing is that the display is a bit lower compared to other monitors. Like the stand that holds up the display is short. It bothers me since I'm 6'3""."
PS3,3dzcus,Konnoke,5,Mon Jul 20 23:21:10 2015 UTC,"There was a lot of issues with the display that it would no longer power on. Is it new in box? Used? Refurb?  Overall, it is really just a monitor. Not a TV. You can't do cable and there's little to no adjustments you can do to it. Otherwise, it's a really high quality screen from what I remember. You'd be better off buying a 24"" computer monitor new for around $150.  Like this one, although this is a refurb."
PS3,3dzcus,wellitwasastart,4,Mon Jul 20 19:54:59 2015 UTC,"I've got limited desk space, so I need something either with speakers or with audio out so that I can use the speakers I already have."

It is one of three monitors on my main PC setup. Honestly, I got it because it was the right size and dirt cheap, considering it is a good (enough) monitor. All in all, I'd say get it.   By the way, mine was refurbished."
PS3,3dzcus,project23,2,Mon Jul 20 22:02:37 2015 UTC,I got mine about 2 years ago and it still works great. I now use it for my PS4.
PS3,3dzcus,spoonard,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"To say there were ""lots"" of issues is not really true when you compare the amount that DIDN'T have issues to the number that did. It seems like more than it is because the buyers that did have issues were more vocal about it on the internet. I have one and I have never had any problems with mine and it works great. Solid 24"" monitor. I'm using it for one of my PS4's now. Though in a couple weeks it's likely going to be replaced by a newer 32"" Vizio display."
PS3,3dzcus,Manjoume,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:34:01 2015 UTC,"It has 2 hdmi ports,  a component set, and a 3.5 mm jack port. That said no cable isn't bad considering even cable is going digital (a box that outputs to hdmi).  Sound is fine but at higher levels sounds tin-y. Visuals look great. My original one had a blinking light of death but I got it replaced and has been working for a couple years perfectly."
PS3,3dzcus,Catawamoctopus,2,Tue Jul 21 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"I have had one for a few years now. It works great, frankly, just make sure you but a PS3 remote for the tv as well. The only problem I have ever had is that every now and then. the display goes black for a second and comes back. Also the 3D on it is pretty shit. For 3D, the bigger the screen, the better the 3D since the 3D effect can't exist beyond the edge of the monitor/screen. It's why IMAX is badass for 3D."
PS3,3dzcus,lowbrowhijinks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:30 2015 UTC,"I loved mine but it started having issues. I don't know the exact specifics but I seem to remember there was an issue with the HDMI connection- it would lose the connection. People have tried to find fixes but they never worked for me.  It's a great (if shiny) screen, but the problem I had (others too) is that the screen just goes black for a few seconds.   Again, my understanding is that it was an HDMI issue. Lots of people say they never had issues. I believe them- especially if they were using component cables."

It's also not a TV, it's a monitor, and there are other monitors now around that price without issues. Unless you need the component input, which is hard to find in a monitor, I'd recommend not taking your chances unless you get a long warranty without a deductible with it."
PS3,3dzcus,philbertagain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:23:12 2015 UTC,"I have one of these and the picture is great.  It was my main ps3 tv untill a few months ago.   It was used in conjuncture with a Cecha this model ps3 does not have HDMIcec but the TV does.  My TV is 4 years old, when I bought it a friend bought one too; his died inside 3 weeks and the retailer was sold out so he took a refund instead of replacment.  Since I owned mine it occasionally displays a black screen for 1 or 2 seconds like it has lost signal (now that ots mentioned sounds like caps).  The TV port sensing is bad enough that sometimes the tv will shut off before the PS3 boots up or when switching modes (ps2 mode for instance).  The speakers are not the loudest.  The 3D/Simulvision makes me sick.    The TV does not come with a remote and the official PS3 remote does not work with it but other remotes do.  Despite all its faults I have found it to be a wonderful companion for my ps3 but I am not sure I would recommend it."

PS3,3dzcus,BigRedDrake,0,Tue Jul 21 07:39:09 2015 UTC,"I got one a couple years ago (new) exclusively for my PS3.. and I really wasn't happy with the resulting picture.  Muddy, dark/smudgy... games actually looked MORE aliased (jaggy) than normal.. I was never able to confirm that was how the image looked for everyone, but the set itself has a VERY limited settings-capability for tweaking things, so there's only so many things one can try to improve the picture.  Television didn't look that great on it, either (though not as 'dark').  During live or taped (and therefore super sharp) HD TV content, any rapid movement resulted in a smearing effect, leaving behind a kind of brief, reddish/ruddy ghosting.  Very distracting.  Nearly every game I tried (over 30 titles) looked MUCH clearer and sharper (of all things..) on my aging Sony 42"" 720p/1080i set than on this one @ 1080p.  I still wish I could figure it out, because it's gathering dust and not being used.  I had it swapped out for another new one just in case it was bad, and had the same results with the second set."
PS3,3e0hv1,FprtuneREX,6,Tue Jul 21 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"for wired, plug it in. for wireless, you need to hit share+PS button for the ps3 to find the controller under bluetooth devices.   the XMB will work, but not all games will work with the controller. others are spotty or just dont work. the vibration and motion control will not work, and the PS button will not take you to the XMB when you are in a game or app.   choosing a ps4 controller over the ps3 one will be giving you a half assed experience. sorry to tell you."

I have it and play on the original Slim, and it isn't bad, but if a new console is in your future then I would wait.   A different recommendation would be Dragon's Crown or Diablo III. Both are just action packed, lootful RPG's. And if you ever have someone that is willing to play, co-op is great. Just know Dragon's Crown is less suitable for kids due to some depictions of female characters. No nudity, just young children shouldn't see it. It's fine otherwise."

Also have you not played the Uncharted games? They are wonderful, and you could knock all three out in a week.  If you think a trip to post-war Los Angeles might be fun, L.A. Noire is worth playing. I really liked the character development. Sometimes the interrogations can be a chore though, so it might be more fun to play it with a guide handy.   I liked all three Borderlands games, but for me they were more fun when playing with others. Playing solo would still be worth it though.   Similarly, Portal 2 is great single-player fun, and shines in co-op too.  Also, Fallout 3 seems like a natural choice, if you haven't already played it."
PS3,3dxwgy,lotsuvroadkill,3,Mon Jul 20 14:29:00 2015 UTC,I finished the trilogy. I've played unchartered 2 which I really liked. Started the third but didn't find the love... might give it another go.  finished borderlands 2. I loved it but would like something less grindy for this exclusive time for myself.   Made it half way through LA Noir which I actually played together with my wife but then we got out of it. It's pretty cool but not sure I can get back into it...  Portal 2 is a grea tip! I loved the first and simply forgott about the sequel.
PS3,3dxwgy,tearlock,5,Mon Jul 20 16:37:46 2015 UTC,Portal 2 is amazing you should check it out.
PS3,3dxwgy,GoshDarnBlast,4,Mon Jul 20 17:09:31 2015 UTC,All DLC:   Braid Limbo Hotline Miami FEZ Ico Shadow of the Colossus   Those games each were much more satisfying once beaten than most of the bigger titles.

PS3,3dxwgy,greenriver572,2,Mon Jul 20 13:27:01 2015 UTC,I've played bioshock. Great games. I played dragons dogma an purchased the dlc but never got around to play it. That's on my list now. Thanks!

PS3,3dvotb,BearyHandsome,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:30:26 2015 UTC,"He is correct. At this point you would need to have it reflowed to fix it and that's not always a permanent fix. In the future, though if you ever do change the thermal paste go with noctua or Arctic Cooling mx4. don'D go with Arctic Silver 5 it takes way too long to cure and it still doesn't perform better than the other two once it cures."
PS3,3dvotb,joellapit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:09:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I fixed mine a couple times just by redoing the thermal paste with Arctic 5 and it would work for a couple weeks and break again. I recommend just getting a new one, it was a huge pain in the ass after the 3rd time and just became not worth it.   I got my current one for $60 on eBay. A fat 80gb.

Is it similar to Nintendo games where they know the fans will buy them anyways without having to drop the price below 20 (that seems to be the low point for most JRPG prices)
PS3,3duhmg,dangerdangle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:03:09 2015 UTC,"There's FF 13 :P  These deals are usually just stuff Gamestop has tons of from trade ins.

Each PS3 encrypts the HDD data with a key tied to the console, and can only be used on the console it was encrypted on.  So even if you wanted to access the data, the computer would be able to see it as it doesn't know the decryption key. Putting the HDD in another PS3 wouldn't be possible either without formatting the drive first."

PS3,3dvj48,Thatzionoverthere,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"I bought my PS3 in December and haven't regretted it. There are a lot of good games for the system most of which you can get for $20 or less baring a few JRPGs. There are some that are getting ported to PS4 and look ""nicer"" on the PS4 but it really depends on if you want to pay $20-$30 more for the prettier version of games like The Last of Us.  Eventually I plan to upgrade to a PS4, but right now there aren't any titles that interest me that I can't already play on this system or on my Husband's gaming PC (dirty console peasants represent!).  Ninja edit for clarity."

PS3,3dvj48,frogsocks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:14:37 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the slim or the super slim? I bought myself a 120GB slim. Some people recommend buying the ps3s with the smallest amount of space and then replacing the hard drive with a larger one since apparently it's cheaper. I've heard it's pretty easy, but I have no experience with it myself.  If you don't want to mess with that stuff though I've heard there are good deals on ebay.    edit: One benefit of the slim is that apparently the fat does have overheating issues. if you plan to do a lot of gaming with your ps3 this may become an issue. Replacing the thermal paste seems to fix the issue for a lot of people though."
PS3,3dvj48,frogsocks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"Super slim probably. In i think i might replace the HDD does not look hard, kind of like the old 360 replacement of hard-drive."

Get a SATA to USB cable and plug it in to your PC. Navigate to the user save games folder and copy the entire contents. Each game will have its unique ID. Something like BLU153201. Now create the folder structure on a USB drive PS3 > SAVEDATA. Drag and drop every game save folder to it.  This is the exact method I used when my console decided to YLOD on me.

PS3,3dqnfu,HossCartwright,3,Sun Jul 19 02:08:40 2015 UTC,"Katamari Forever would be a good choice.  Another thing to consider is that the ESRB ratings are really not consistent with Movie Ratings.  With the exception of some ultraviolent games like GTA V, most ""M"" rated games are generally like a PG-13 movie.  Godzilla and Spiderman 2 both got ""T"" ratings and they are pretty tame. Assasin's Creed III (which is esssentially a historical simulation game and not titillating, got an M. Even something made by Rockstar Games like Red Dead Redemption (rated M) is really on the level of a PG13 action movie- not to mention the game is much more fun to be the good guy than the bad guy.  Meanwhile there are other games that are M rated that are much worse and equivalent to a very 'hard R' movie, first of which is GTA V.  I would have no problem having a 10-11 year old boy playing Assassin's Creed 3 or Red Dead Redemption but I wouldn't allow them to play GTA V.  They are very quick to give the M rating to games.  With Redbox, you can just rent the game yourself and play it for a day or two to figure out if it is appropriate.  It also depends on the maturity level of your kid.  You know as a parent what games he can handle."

PS3,3dr6ou,NikePikey,25,Sat Jul 18 17:49:21 2015 UTC,I only collect moving trophies.

I dont think boosting sounds fun at all.  There are also many ps3 games (and ps1 or ps2)with no trophy support that are still good games, I dont understand the ""no platnium/trophy, no purchase"" mentality."
PS3,3dr6ou,philbertagain,3,Sat Jul 18 19:51:28 2015 UTC,I do if it's something I think is reasonable. Multiplayer trophies are pretty much a no go for me because a lot of them are huge grinds. I go for platinums when they seem reasonable. I do like getting trophies though.
PS3,3dr6ou,Cardboard_Waffle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"Same here, I try to avoid trophies that are just grinding but always go after the ones I think will be fun. One example is Dishonored. Doing a no-detection/non-lethal run on the highest difficult was very awesome. But killing 20 or so enemies on the same manner in a stealth game is a bore so I never went for Platinum."

PS3,3dr6ou,Dangld,3,Sat Jul 18 22:05:51 2015 UTC,"I do it to get more out of a game.  Turns a 20-30 hr game into at two to three times as much.  I don't bother going for Platinum if it has an online portion.  My faves are similar to the Uncharted ones.  Do one meticulous run on average difficulty,  then one on highest setting,  worrying about nothing but the game play.  TLOU is a good example (except for the online portion)"

PS3,3dr6ou,marsatomic,2,Sat Jul 18 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say 'collect' but I rarely feel like I've challenged a game until I've reached 30% of the trophies... my average is around 40% and it's become somewhat of a goal to keep it above 40% lol. The other number I care about is my national ranking (psnprofiles.com lists it, but I use a local site with message board and so on) because it's not too hard to climb that (international is too much to bother)  It's not that I compete or anything, it's just some weird self-esteem thing where I feel like if I'm gonna play a console, I'm gonna put some effort into it. I guess it trains my general attitude to try a disciplined approach to games.  I enjoy reaching 100% trophies for a game, but it's acceptable to me when I kept aiming towards full completion and the last few trophies are just too much of a hassle. It's more important to have fun and move in that direction."

PS3,3dr60d,Complexity114,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"You can't install game data to USB drives. It has to be installed in the console itself (officially you also need a mounting bracket to secure the drive safely). Existing filesystem is irrelevant as all data on it will get erased and reformatted in an encrypted filesystem unique to your particular console.    Pretty much any old 2.5"" SATA laptop drive will work if you have any spare computers you no longer use.  If the WD external drive you have is one of the slim types that run purely off USB then chances are it has one of these inside it if you are willing to sacrifice it.  What you can do if you have a USB hard disk or memory stick is make backups of saves, media files and system data. This is the bit where FAT32 applies."

PS3,3do4dp,ltcuetf,3,Fri Jul 17 21:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd love to have the DLC, but when you can buy all 3 games for the price of about 1.5 of the DLC, there's an issue in value."
PS3,3do4dp,LocarionStorm,2,Fri Jul 17 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can understand that. I think I played through each of them twice or so. They are well made and add to the story, I had purchased ME3 at retail so the DLC was a bargain when it was on sale. When you can get ME3 for next to nothing it begins to matter, cost vs content."

It's mostly just go here and kill these guys and then go there and do the same thing. BL2 improved on the storytelling a great deal and feels much more like you are in the middle of an adventure. You can play it without playing BL1 and not feel like you are missing anything. I enjoyed both games a lot but, because of the improved story, I liked BL2 more."
PS3,3do4dp,gomer11,2,Sat Jul 18 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"The main campaign story is serviceable, but the DLC is way better, story-wise. I would recommend picking this up and playing it first. Besides, you'll appreciate the added mechanics in BL2 a whole lot better if you play through the first one."

Like full blown visual novel amounts of reading, the battles and story isn't bad but you'll be reading more than actually exploring and fighting"
PS3,3do1if,rockityroll,4,Fri Jul 17 20:59:57 2015 UTC,"Resonance of Fate really isn't like any other JRPG out there. It's a lot more about strategy than grinding.  The combat mechanics are difficult to pick up, but you NEED to understand them in order to advance. Battles quickly turn south if you've no idea what you're doing.  Having said that, it really is rewarding. Seeing as grinding doesn't really help that much, when you DO get past a bit that you're stuck in, it's a great feeling. It's a fun but difficult game.  I'd suggest looking at some gameplay videos online. I really loved it, but it's not for everyone."
PS3,3do1if,Vaccus,2,Fri Jul 17 21:17:48 2015 UTC,thanks for the response. i decided to pass on it. it looks and sounds a bit too unforgiving. i enjoy a challenge from time to time but not really in this type of game
PS3,3do1if,GreasyMechanic,-2,Fri Jul 17 23:01:20 2015 UTC,Sounds like ffxiii.  Edit: watched battle footage. Looks even more involving than ffxiii
PS3,3do1if,WeWereInfinite,3,Sat Jul 18 03:13:35 2015 UTC,It's better than FFXIII in almost every way.   Unfortunately they were released a week apart and Final Fantasy's popularity absolutely destroyed RoF's chances of being successful.
PS3,3do1if,GreasyMechanic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:22:45 2015 UTC,Haven't tried RoF yet but I for one loved both the story and gameplay of ffxiii.
PS3,3do1if,Teh_akod,4,Sat Jul 18 18:18:01 2015 UTC,"This is a hard game. Not punishing hard ala Dark Souls but a more ""you better be very patient"" hard. It has its moments where you will probably be obliterated by the game only to realize it was most likely your fault (save often!) but when you do get how the game works it will suck you in.  Besides, Vashyron is such a fucking Pimp, he makes the whole game worth it."
PS3,3do1if,B504,2,Sat Jul 18 06:49:01 2015 UTC,"if it has a good story    No, it doesn't. Story is told in chapters. You get a scene here or there, but it's largely mission based. I rather liked that, because it felt more grounded than the usual RPG fare. There is an overall story arc, but it doesn't factor into the game all that much.  Scenes are well done. Characters are solid, well scripted and voice acted. I really like the cast, small as it is. While the dialogue is excellent, the story is rather forgettable and can be difficult to follow. I don't hold it against the game though, because I appreciate the change of pace.   has good customization   Yes, your customize your guns, and that system is really fun. Unfortunately, it takes forever to open up. I want to say you really won't get into customizing the guns until chapter 4, and the game is 13 (?) chapters long. It takes a while for the parts and cash to open up. You'll struggle until then, too, cause the game is tough. Like, common enemies will kill you tough.   if it's fun or a grind   You'll hate it at first. It really is so very different than any RPG you've played. There's nothing like it. The lack of bezels early on will limit your strategy. You run out of bezels, you die. So, early on, be cautious, and don't go flipping everywhere (which eats your bezels), because it'll leave you helpless and staring at a Game Over screen more than you're used to seeing in an RPG.  There's no real grind unless you want to do/get everything, and even then it's not as bad as Ni no Kuni, Tales of Vesperia, and other typical JRPGs. For what it's worth, I 1000/1000ed it on 360. I bought it at launch, played it for a few days that March, and then sat on it frustrated for a long time. Nearly a year or more later, I revisited the game after abandoning it on chapter 2 or 3. I pushed through and once I got to and completed chapter 4, it finally clicked, and I learned to love the game.  Again, it's not like anything out there. It's not perfect, but it's amazing all the same. Just be patient with it. Understand that you will die and die often while you adjust to the game. You'll get better, and you'll come to love the game, too."
PS3,3do1if,breathsavers,2,Sat Jul 18 08:55:21 2015 UTC,It's really not that challenging. It ramps up fairly slowly and gives you time to upgrade weapons and figure things out. One of my favorite PS3 dogs even though the story is near impossible to understand. There's a really cool world exploration system and the battle system is fast paced and fun.
PS3,3dotsl,Zarotu,3,Sat Jul 18 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"I've had one since it came out and it's a really good device. It's terribly easy to transport, especially since it uses the same cables as my PS4, so I can just swap them between rooms whenever I feel like (and the super slim is a really good weight as well).  I do dislike the disk drive though, it just feels really flimsy compared to the previous PS3s with the slot-loading drive (especially since you have to manually close the disc drive with your hand; pain in the ass if you have it vertical). The build quality is probably a step down from previous PS3s. It's not too bad though, and it's worth it for the size reduction.  It's also only got two USB ports, which I can live with, but it'd be nice if we had even just one more. That's about all the complaints I'm coming up with. The PS3's a great device. I sold my Xbox two weeks after getting one."

PS3,3dotsl,Demon_Marionette,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:34:02 2015 UTC,"Common problems for all PS3s:   Slow browser (there's a neat Youtube app for vids though, and Netflix runs impressively smoothly)  Slow trophy sync (impacts how long it takes to display any trophy list while online, and it's slow as f***)  PSN store can sometimes crash (like half the time)  No support for document files (PDF, txt, rtf, epub etc)  12gb model lacks a HDD 'caddy' which is a metal thing that fits an eventual HDD if you install one    Overall, it's a 9/10 console though. Can't blame the PS3 that most of its games are similar genres (action, platforming, sports)"

I found it very linear with little challenge.  Very simplistic platforming.  I have only started the second play to pick up the memories but after 3 levels am not sure it I will pick it back up.  Even as a stylized game there was not much to it.  The story was vauge and mostly pointless.  This game is somewhat like Papo & Yo, Lost in Shadow and  Ico but is out classed by all of them."

Mousecraft is the kind of thing that holds up there, but not so much on the larger screen. Good one for wasting time on a plane and stuff.  My kids like Rain, but they're pretty little. Entwined is OK, but I don't really get the point. I'll probably load it on the Vita as well, just for kicks- but this is like three months in a row where one of the Vita offerings was some kind of weird, arty flying game (race the sun, futuridium, entwined, hohokum, etc.)- they need to come up with a different style to push."

PS3,3doro4,philbertagain,0,Sat Jul 18 03:10:18 2015 UTC,:( oh well it comes out on Xbox in 6 days
PS3,3do0ob,Nazgarmar,3,Fri Jul 17 20:52:54 2015 UTC,I picked up Warhawk the other day for 99¢... To my surprise there are still lobbies up and running after almost a decade.
PS3,3do0ob,Dudemanbroski,4,Fri Jul 17 21:16:54 2015 UTC,We the players can host the servers. Hopefully it should never die.
PS3,3do0ob,Black_Swords_Man,3,Sat Jul 18 01:57:24 2015 UTC,"I hope so, that game is so bad-ass. I just don't think I'll ever be able to level past 2nd lieutenant!"
PS3,3do0ob,Dudemanbroski,2,Sat Jul 18 02:03:26 2015 UTC,"Without the need of PSN? If so, I may just need to get it just because it is ensured to stay up for years."
PS3,3do0ob,GeneralChaz9,2,Sat Jul 18 03:58:33 2015 UTC,"You probably still need the PSN to get the server list, but the server could be hosted by the player. There is a trophy for doing so."
PS3,3do0ob,Black_Swords_Man,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:51:39 2015 UTC,"I was so upset two years ago when I was kicked in a capture the flag match for ""hacking"" which I'm totally incapable of doing.  Haven't played the game since. But man, those days were golden. Best 99 cents used for you."
PS3,3do0ob,JeffrFitz,2,Sun Jul 19 02:05:36 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the single player, but the multiplayer is a graveyard."
PS3,3do0ob,Desert_Templar,2,Fri Jul 17 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"There are always people playing, but be prepared to go against a community that is highly skilled and experienced. You can jump in, but highly recommend playing all the single player content first and doing some of the co-op mode."
PS3,3dp1ix,todd_thevegan,2,Sat Jul 18 02:11:16 2015 UTC,Definitely Guerilla
PS3,3dp1ix,shadowgunner200,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:40:05 2015 UTC,Guerilla
PS3,3dp1ix,mastermeatlock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:21:34 2015 UTC,Guerilla is the more enjoyable of the two. I just finished playing Guerilla for the second time. The gameplay drives the game very well. The destruction and open world gameplay are very fun. Armageddon maintains the destructive elements but on a smaller scale and the gameplay is now linear. Armageddon is just a big step backwards but still has its moments. But definitely check out Red Faction Guerilla it is one of my favorites from this past generation.
PS3,3dp1ix,generalozzman,0,Sun Jul 19 05:49:31 2015 UTC,Armageddon sucked. It's a bullshit FPS on rails. Guerrilla was far better.
PS3,3domer,cooper212,2,Fri Jul 17 23:53:33 2015 UTC,I think only bethesda games and games 2008 and earlier. After 2008 or 09 third party support wasn't as controversial on ps3. At least that has been my personal experience.
PS3,3domer,quien,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:31:56 2015 UTC,"I get kinda confused because people talk about how buggy bethesda games are but reviewers i see for ps3 goty editions of skyrim, fallout 3 and nv all seem very positive."

They're under $5  I love that they have LA Noire along with the season pass for around $10.50"
PS3,3dkhi5,cheezyrabiolee,2,Fri Jul 17 03:55:15 2015 UTC,"Sweet. The cheapo ports of older GTA games for my Vita will be great. I hope. If they're terrible, I guess I'm only out $2.50. :D"
PS3,3dkhi5,wrigh003,13,Sat Jul 18 18:09:01 2015 UTC,Nearly dirt cheap - the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and 2.5 games are under $20 each used at Gamestop. I'm heavily considering them as I never got to play any of them before (didn't have a PS2) and really want to see what all the hype was about.
PS3,3dkhi5,Arch27,7,Fri Jul 17 13:12:05 2015 UTC,"Go for it, I played the originals back then and have absolutely no regrets about getting the remasters."
PS3,3dkhi5,NunoM,2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:49 2015 UTC,"Are the remasters substantial graphic updates?  Also, didn't one of them add in the ability to adjust the camera with the right stick? That would be huge!"
PS3,3dkhi5,cjcolt,2,Fri Jul 17 15:24:15 2015 UTC,"As far as I could recall, the camera was already movable 360º in the original versions, albeit the rotation was a bit slow. And yes, much like FFX, the remasters are remarkably better-looking and overall more polished and fluid. I actually own both versions and had them running simultaneously on the same television, and not taking away from the original charm, I don't think I'll be playing the old versions again ever."
PS3,3dkhi5,NunoM,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:28:43 2015 UTC,"Well, you were still able to move the camera, but it was mapped to r2 and l2, not the right stick."
PS3,3dkhi5,LeprosySucks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"So, in the remasters is it full control? Like can you also adjust the y-axis now?"
PS3,3dkhi5,cjcolt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"It's been a little while since I've played it, but I believe so. The 2nd you can and I think they just made the 1st control like it."
PS3,3dkhi5,LeprosySucks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, there's also secret bosses, more content, more abilities, more difficulty options, new keyblades, etc. It feels a lot more fluent than the original game."
PS3,3dkhi5,gamefreak9199,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:33:58 2015 UTC,I'm sold
PS3,3dkhi5,cjcolt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"It's my favorite game series by far, KH1 is extremely nostalgic for me, and Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix is amazing, it has I believe 17-18 new bosses that are all extremely fun and challenging, a new difficulty (Critical, take 2x damage, deal 2x damage, and you have half the normal health.), and it has a new drive form that gives you the Kingdom Hearts 1 outfit and (some) abilities back."
PS3,3dkhi5,gamefreak9199,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:39:45 2015 UTC,I heard somewhere that the ps3 version is only final mix. Is that true? Because if it doesn't have the regular difficulty I don't want to buy it.
PS3,3dkhi5,mmazurr,7,Fri Jul 17 20:05:44 2015 UTC,"Get them. Those are some seriously fantastic games if you like RPGs and Disney.   Scratch that, they're phenomenal."
PS3,3dkhi5,guillotine20,5,Fri Jul 17 13:28:06 2015 UTC,"For a long time I wasn't sure if they were remastered versions of the original games, as everything I could find on them just spouted on and on about all the included (3DS? PSP?) stuff.  So - they are the full KH 1 and 2 games in there along with some other stuff?"
PS3,3dkhi5,Arch27,7,Fri Jul 17 13:36:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. The KH series has 2 main games (KH 1 and KH 2) that were on PS2 and 5 games on handheld consoles that still tie into the overall story. Only the most recent handheld game, the one for 3DS, is not included in any way in one of these two collections.  KH 1.5 has:    The full KH 1 game, remastered, with bonus content previously only in the Japanese version. Full PS2 port of a KH GBA game that's also remastered. HD cutscenes of a DS KH game (so pretty much a movie of the DS one).   KH 2.5 has:    The full KH 2 game, remastered with bonus content previously only in the Japanese version. A full PS3 port of a PSP game that's also remastered and also has bonus content previously only in the Japanese version. HD cutscenes of a different DS KH game (again, pretty much a movie of it).   Honestly, you're not missing much with just the cutscenes of the DS games, cause gameplay-wise they were pretty terrible. KH has been known for having a bit of a complicated story past the first game, so these HD collections are perfect so you can get the full story in a neat package.  Sorry for the wall of text, I'm just a really huge fan of these games haha."
PS3,3dkhi5,dsaltz,4,Fri Jul 17 15:09:18 2015 UTC,"Wall of text completely appreciated. I've been looking for someone to explain fully what is in these compilations without all the nostalgia fluff bogging down the info. I think what was really throwing me off was that it's called ""Remix"" or ""Final Mix"" in some places, and I didn't understand what that meant.  Usually when a game is remastered for the PS3 it just gets called ""GAME TITLE HD"" but the 1.5/2.5 and the other words in the titles were throwing me off."
PS3,3dkhi5,Arch27,3,Fri Jul 17 15:19:38 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, ""Final Mix"" is the moniker used for the Japanese updated version with bonus content. They weren't released outside of Japan until these collections included them.  I'm not entirely sure why they chose ""1.5"" and ""2.5."" Maybe cause of where they fit in the story? Either way, rest assured you'll be getting pretty much everything KH has every produced with these collections."
PS3,3dkhi5,dsaltz,2,Fri Jul 17 15:38:57 2015 UTC,Sounds like I'll be spending about $3.50 -- er $35 later today :D
PS3,3dkhi5,Arch27,3,Fri Jul 17 15:39:51 2015 UTC,"Kingdom Hearts 1.5 contains KH: Final Mix, KH: RE:Chain of Memories and KH: 358/2 Days (in the form of cinematics. Kingdom Hearst 2.5 contains KH: Final Mix+, KH: Birth by Sleep Final Mix and KH: RE:Coded (in the form of cinematics).  If it's <$20 each, get them. Totally amazing price for totally amazing games."
PS3,3dkhi5,guillotine20,3,Fri Jul 17 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"So you get 4 beautifully remastered, fun games to play, and two to watch!"
PS3,3dkhi5,guillotine20,12,Fri Jul 17 16:18:20 2015 UTC,Ni no kuni.  I've seen it under $10. Ghibli the rpg

PS3,3dkhi5,01314150,19,Fri Jul 17 12:48:51 2015 UTC,"I actually got dishonored a couple of weeks ago for 5 bucks at game stop. It was pre-owned, but the case and game disc are practically brand new and spotless."
PS3,3dkhi5,3vyn,3,Fri Jul 17 01:45:45 2015 UTC,Did you like it? I've found it for 10 bucks and almost bought it
PS3,3dkhi5,macman156,6,Fri Jul 17 02:21:34 2015 UTC,"I really do. It's like Assassins creed, but with cool super powers."
PS3,3dkhi5,3vyn,5,Fri Jul 17 03:22:50 2015 UTC,"I'm playing it right now, it's pretty fun! I like how there are many different ways to go about doing a level."
PS3,3dkhi5,Cardboard_Waffle,5,Fri Jul 17 06:17:36 2015 UTC,I think it's a lot cooler than assassin's Creed.
PS3,3dkhi5,weclock,2,Fri Jul 17 06:45:23 2015 UTC,That's the last game I'd compare it with.
PS3,3dkhi5,darthmarticus,2,Fri Jul 17 15:49:19 2015 UTC,I'm playing it now and it's great. The game mechanics are the same as Bioshock Infinite and the game play is pretty awesome. I'd suggest get it.
PS3,3dkhi5,Magnum40oz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:16:28 2015 UTC,"dishonored and the DLC is one of the best of the last gen games, easily. Its super re-playable ."

PS3,3dkhi5,AgusDima,2,Fri Jul 17 11:50:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say definitely worth it, Especially for that price."
PS3,3dkhi5,3vyn,8,Fri Jul 17 15:39:30 2015 UTC,I recommend checking out second hand stores and pawn shops... I found a hard copy of destiny for $10 yesterday

PS3,3dkhi5,MarshMarlou,3,Fri Jul 17 09:43:54 2015 UTC,"Basically all of these, but I will say I wasn't much a fan of the Yakuza series.   I would also add Skyrim and the God of War collection, both are available fairly cheaply and come with a ton of content. Be warned, GoW comes with redemption codes for 2/5 games included so beware buying used."

PS3,3dkhi5,StaticzAvenger,4,Fri Jul 17 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on the kind of games you enjoy:  FPS   Resistance 1, 2 & 3. This is a great series, just a shame the online never took off as the co-op online was such fun  older COD and Battlefield games    RTS/strategy   RUSE - a new take on an old genre. Not amazing, but certainly fun. Seen this going for as little as £2 before  Red Alert 3: Uprising - is a stripped down version of the PC game with just challenge maps. Not bad if you can get it cheap.  X-COM Enemy Unknown/Within - I got the former for £5, the latter is a little more expensive but TOTALLY worth it if it's no more than £10 Valkyria Chronicles. - one of my all time favourite games.  Definitely in my top 5 PS3 games. Hard to find it cheap, but I've seem some places selling it for £13   JRPG   Disgaea 4 and D2 - these 2 games will give you hundreds of hours of fun if you like strategy RPGs with a focus on comedy and game mechanics . Both are about £10-15 Can't really avoid the obvious FFXIII trilogy. I've seen the first 2 for under £10 each  Tales Of Xillia 1 & 2 - these are hard to come by cheap, but I have been in some 2nd hand game shops and seen the first for £15 before    3rd person/not sure how to categorise   Heavenly Sword - very fun, albeit short, launch title that I've seen going for peanuts  (like 50p) Rachet & Clank Future: Series - I did see somewhere that you could get Tools of Destruction and Crack in Time for about £20. So worth it. R&C main series games never fail to be fun    Hope this helps :)"
PS3,3dkhi5,dude2dudette,3,Fri Jul 17 08:13:36 2015 UTC,"Heavenly Sword   Such a good game, but turn off the Sixaxis controls (unless you're familiar with it). There was a part where a character was hobbling across a bridge and I needed to shoot oncoming enemies with a crossbow using the Sixaxis controls (adjusts the flight of the bolt) and boy did that suck."

PS3,3dkhi5,Ace1h,0,Sat Jul 18 20:57:48 2015 UTC,I got xcom enemy within for 3€ NEW. Got Red dead redemption for 7€ used. Stores sell MGR for 4€ new.
PS3,3dml57,peterkozmd,5,Fri Jul 17 14:22:02 2015 UTC,Full disclosure: I came here to find out why you would want to ask about Gears of War in the PS3 sub. I feel like a complete idiot now.
PS3,3dml57,AlmightyShizz,2,Fri Jul 17 15:06:17 2015 UTC,Full disclosure: I came here to find out why you would want to ask about Gears of War in the PS3 sub. I feel like a complete idiot now.   I actually thought we were talking about Gears of War until I read your comment.
PS3,3dml57,DocMcNinja,2,Fri Jul 17 17:15:38 2015 UTC,I had the same experience with it when I got the god of war legacy ps3. It just seemed like my inputs weren't registering when you had to continually mash a button.
PS3,3dml57,Hestkuk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:43:29 2015 UTC,thats the version I'm using the ps3 legacy collection of the older ps2 games. Why is there a known problem with it not working like it should?  in any case its really annoying. I don't normally mind qte's but this has about the worst i've ever experienced in terms of response. Pounding on the buttons barely seems to work. It really sucks because in this game if you don't register the right moves properly you are stuck in an endless loop of going back fighting ad infinium until the qte so you can finish the fight. If it responded like it should i wouldn't mind it  Here i'm pounding like no one's business and its not even moving. Then you start to question your method of pounding? do i just slam hard as fast as possible or do i put it to a rhythm   don't wanna have to pull out a rapid fire controller and cheat in essence to play through this game.
PS3,3dml57,AlexxJoshee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:48:20 2015 UTC,Meant minotaurs still these qte's are seriously a bitch
PS3,3dml57,Limekiller,2,Fri Jul 17 14:33:50 2015 UTC,I loved quick time events in God of War series. The interesting thing is when you play other games having QTEs you feel like the prompts are taking too much time to show up!
PS3,3dkkgq,Ryno555,15,Fri Jul 17 00:46:57 2015 UTC,"If you're buying a ps4, I would see if amazon still has the system, PS plus for a year, Witcher 3 and batman arkam knight of 400. Like stat."
PS3,3dkkgq,imtalkintou,10,Fri Jul 17 01:00:11 2015 UTC,I still have to get my fix of Mass Effect every few months. Won't get rid of my PS3 for the sake of playing ME.
PS3,3dkkgq,lAbstractedl,8,Fri Jul 17 02:13:26 2015 UTC,I have a ton of psn games that are only ps3 playable so I have mine connected all the time.
PS3,3dkkgq,Kukijiro,5,Fri Jul 17 01:49:22 2015 UTC,"Man, I never get rid of my consoles. I still have my original Xbox, my ps3, and 360 even though I have the ps4 and xbox one as well as a pc. It really depends on how much those exclusives are worth to you, alongside how much the trade in value is worth to you. I would personally say keep it...you may miss it when it's gone. You can always buy another but it will still cost more than you sold yours for most likely.   And even though you didn't mention it, Playstation Now is neat, but even with good Internet the quality isn't quite as good and the input lag is unavoidable...including the fact that it doesn't have every game.   Just my two cents."
PS3,3dkkgq,BearyHandsome,4,Fri Jul 17 02:52:56 2015 UTC,"That's what i'm talking about. I still have a SNES, GBA, GBA SP, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS Vita, 360, XBOX ONE, Wii, Wii U, and a PC. I still play almost all of them except handhelds since I be driving most of the time. My sister and I still play our SNES trying to beat Batman Forever, which we still cant after 30+ tries."

PS3,3dkkgq,BearyHandsome,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:51:32 2015 UTC,I gave my Gameboy Color to my sister and just disappeared after that. I didn't understand nostalgia either but i just never happen to lose things. Grew up learning how to take care of things.
PS3,3dkkgq,Blackzro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:06:45 2015 UTC,"Well I never lost them, I just sold them when I was younger. I think that makes it worse than losing it because I intentionally got rid of them haha."
PS3,3dkkgq,BearyHandsome,2,Sat Jul 18 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"Haha just think of it as upgrading if you at least used that money to be a new gaming handheld or console. From one of those $1 scratch offs, I won $200 and used it to buy the PS One (the one with the screen and portable). It got stolen and the money they gave me for it by the insurance was used for a PS2. Oh how i missed playing PS1 games on the road."
PS3,3dkkgq,Blackzro,4,Sat Jul 18 02:03:10 2015 UTC,"The only reason I still played my PS3 was for the borderlands pre-sequel as it hadn't come out for next gen at the time, though it looks like it may be part of the flash sale this weekend, so I'll have no games I spend time with on that system anymore.  My gf likes to play Black Ops sometimes still, so we keep it hooked up, but yes, I pretty much only play on the PS4.  The responsiveness of the menu, the great free games (and killer sales) on PS+, there is plenty to play.  I got my PS4 at thanksgiving last year, FYI and love it."
PS3,3dkkgq,bscotchcummerbunds,4,Fri Jul 17 05:00:11 2015 UTC,"I never get rid of my consoles. I still have my ps1 and ps2 (shit, I still have my genesis and snes hooked up which I still play).  To answer your question, I still game a lot on my PS3."
PS3,3dkkgq,_heisenberg__,6,Fri Jul 17 13:24:48 2015 UTC,"75% PS3, 25% PS4. New games are too expensive, don't care about graphics, I refuse to pay for PS+, and I have yet to find anything that the PS4 does better than PS3 (besides the controller, and that works on both systems). That said, there are a huge number of old titles that I haven't touched yet, so finding fresh material isn't a concern for me."
PS3,3dkkgq,Block-Head,2,Fri Jul 17 04:09:09 2015 UTC,"PS+ has saved me quite a bit of money over the years due to the free games.  For example, both Tomb Raider, Arkham City, and X-Com: Enemy Unknown have all been free games, which I would have bought anyway."

PS3,3dkkgq,marblepebble,2,Fri Jul 17 08:12:04 2015 UTC,"I have so many games on my PS3 that it would be retarded to get rid of it. I still play a lot of those games as well; at first it might feel odd to go back to a lower resolution and framerate, but the games are still the same great games they were back then. I'm playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution on my PS3, and I'll probably play some BioShock Infinite again later on."
PS3,3dkkgq,ArtakhaPrime,2,Fri Jul 17 10:55:12 2015 UTC,I rarely play my PS3.  Only a Netflix machine for my wife who likes the PS3 video controller better than using the DS4.
PS3,3dkkgq,WreckerCrew,2,Fri Jul 17 10:57:53 2015 UTC,I use both everyday sometimes at the same time when I'm watching anime or YouTube on one tv and playing a game on the other
PS3,3dkkgq,tachyonicbrane,2,Fri Jul 17 11:14:02 2015 UTC,Definitely keep it! I play both systems about equally. There's a lot of PS3 games I never got to play that are  cheap used now.
PS3,3dkkgq,Sulinder711,2,Fri Jul 17 11:16:25 2015 UTC,"I bought mine specifically for Arkham Knight, and that's the only thing I've been playing since. I'm still perfectly happy to keep my ps3 around, though, since I've still got a pretty big back log to work my way through."
PS3,3dkkgq,scootation,2,Fri Jul 17 12:55:46 2015 UTC,I made the switch from Xbox 360 to PS4 when the current generation was released. About 2 months later I went out and bought a PS3 for two reasons. 1. I feel like I should appreciate some of the games I didn't get to play when I was an Xbox fanbox. And 2. I need those trophies and what better reason to replay all your old favourite games? I don't sell consoles since there might be a day where I crave a game.
PS3,3dkkgq,monarch444,2,Fri Jul 17 13:37:25 2015 UTC,"well i'm still playing my ps3... free online.. and sometimes i wonder why i got a ps4 at all?  played some of the few good games out.. shadow of mordor was good, but i felt incredibly ripped-off by the very short length and masses of DLC (lots of day 1 DLC, goddamn that shits me).. GOTY ed. might be ok, but i'm going to wait for a price drop..  same with batman... waiting for GOTY ed.  i'd get elder scrolls online, but that's $80 for the game + $80-90 for a year of PS online... (yeah, australia)   after fallout 4 comes out (and the others at end of year) i think my ps4 will get more use."
PS3,3dkkgq,anth13,2,Fri Jul 17 14:35:30 2015 UTC,"It's honestly about 50/50 for me. I use PS4 for Netflix and The Witcher, and PS3 for Black Ops 2."
PS3,3dkkgq,King_Stannis,2,Fri Jul 17 14:42:15 2015 UTC,"There isn't much overlap in games worth playing on both systems aside from more indie titles. Due to this both systems are well worth keeping and having at the same time because they offer different things.  Having PS+ overlap for both systems is nice as well, especially if you throw a Vita in the mix.  You may also find out about other PS3 titles worth playing to go back and try.  Bottom line keep your PS3 especially if you have to ask. You will only end up regretting it down the line if you sell it. You won't regret not selling it for not much money years later."
PS3,3dkkgq,Toysoldier34,2,Fri Jul 17 15:21:26 2015 UTC,I have both. They're played at a daily basis pretty much.
PS3,3dkkgq,JebusOfEagles,2,Fri Jul 17 16:06:05 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat. Got the ps4 bundle from Prime day. I still have games to play on the PS3: ME2 and 3 and Max Payne 3. I'll definitely come back to finish them.
PS3,3dkkgq,ShinobiZilla,2,Fri Jul 17 16:11:10 2015 UTC,"I have a PS4, PS3, Gaming PC, Wii U and a 3DS as far as current systems. Of those, the PS4 gets the least amount of playing time.

PS3,3dkkgq,Rickrogue,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:53 2015 UTC,"I use the PS3 as my video player for applications like Netflix, HBO and Hulu.   I use my PS4 for gaming."
PS3,3dkkgq,beatlesbright,2,Fri Jul 17 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"I actually bought a PS3 a year after buying a ps4. I've been playing through a lot of games I missed last generation. The speed of the PS3 nav and startup make me play the ps4 when I can only jump on for a quick gaming session, but otherwise I am on the PS3. I also like to wait for games to come down in price to the $20-$30 range, so I have plenty of down time between games."
PS3,3dkkgq,bellmounte,2,Sat Jul 18 03:35:57 2015 UTC,"I'll probably play PS4 if it's an exclusive like Bloodborne. PS3 still has great games. I have yet to pick up the Legacy collection of Metal Gear. I still want that, and the remastered trilogies like Killzone."
PS3,3dkkgq,InigoMarz,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:41 2015 UTC,"I'm taking the leap on Monday to PS4. My Question to the sub is, how many of you guys have both PS3 & PS4, and how often do you use your PS3 if you have both?   Had a PS3 1 year ago. Sold it, bought a PS4. Since then I have played exactly 2 PS4 games, and last week bought a PS3 to find games worth playing.  The selection of titles for the PS4 is, honestly, pretty shit.  But then again, I play a lot of the 'must have' titles on my computer because they look better, run better, and are cheaper (steam, gog, gmg, etc.).  Ergo my answer is, if you have a gaming computer, don't buy a ps4 at all. If you do not, buy a PS4 but keep the PS3 because of title selection."
PS3,3dkkgq,shiftygopher,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:01:13 2015 UTC,"I'm in the middle of getting a PS3 again. I make the mistake of selling mine because I couldn't wait to get a PS4. Here are some of the games I have waiting for me to download once I get a PS3 again: Fight Night Champion, Mirrors Edge, Bioshock 1, Bioshock 2, Bioshock Infinite, Deus Ex: Human Revolution Directors Cut, Metal Gear Rising, God Of War Series, Siren, Counter Strike: GO, Fat Princess, Shadow of the Colossus, Max Payne 3, Resident Evil 4, Devil May Cry HD Collection, etc...

PS3,3dkkgq,LiquidFootie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:03:09 2015 UTC,When I got my PS4 I used it as a way to say goodbye to the last generation. I had a ridiculous backlog of PS3 games that I was never going to get to. I took it as an opportunity to hit the reset button on my gaming queue.

PS3,3djqlz,UnfriendlySoloutions,3,Thu Jul 16 20:48:55 2015 UTC,"This has been a problem for myself as well as other people, I believe what the game is doing is installing itself without actually telling you. What I did was delete it off my ps3 and re install it. Then I turned it on and let the medallion spin for about 3 hours.   When I came back it was on the title screen and I never had another problem. Hopefully yours is the same issue. Good luck."
PS3,3djqlz,wheatle,2,Thu Jul 16 21:53:03 2015 UTC,It freezes on the medallion. I just looked at my disc and noticed a very small hole on the outside of the disk. I can see through it if I put it right up against my eye. Maybe that is the problem?
PS3,3djqlz,sauseman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:55:46 2015 UTC,Yea it is. All the data is written on the back of the game disc label. If thats scratched you game is fucked.

PS3,3djqlz,condorbiker900,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:00:09 2015 UTC,"Different game but hear me out: i had a similar problem with Borderlands 2 about a year ago. I could not load into one of the areas at the beginning of the game. Turns out that there were a few spots missing on the label side of the disc (a few were pinhole size and one was about 10 times bigger). Believe it or not, all i did was color in the spots with a black marker where the label was missing and it started working again. Was able to load the problem area and continued on to beat the game with that character.  Not sure if this could help but i would try to color over the holes with a black marker."

PS3,3djhqq,philbertagain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:37:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, great idea.  I have a CECHK fat 80GB that I had reballed by a guy on eBay who has been a member for a long time and has %100 positive feedback. I was getting ylod after having rlod for a while which is why I sent it to him.  Anyway, I get it back and it works for a week then starts with rlod again. I send it back and he tests it and finds nothing wrong. So he sends it back and that's where I'm at currently.  He's offering me a CECHG model for free which he says is the best fat 80GB model in terms of how the interior of the console was designed and how it works. I'd have to send mine back to him though and that costs me $35 shipping.   So, for my 6 year old ps3 I've spent $105 + $35 + another $35 to ship it to him the second time. So $175 and I'd have to spend another $35 to ship him my broke one. This is crazy. I know it's not my power supply or fan. I found a way to test both by turning it off then turning it on holding the eject button I think.   Does anyone know what could possibly be wrong on my ps3 to keep getting rlod after I had all new solder and thermal paste installed??? Thanks"
PS3,3djhqq,macd753,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:59:52 2015 UTC,"It was YloD so you sent back, he said it was fine sent to you, you rereceived it and it was stoll YloD?  Sounds shady. If he wont fix it I personaly would ask for a refund on the repair fee and not deal with this person again. I certainly wouldn't buy a system from him.  Did he show his equipment? IR table, reball station ect or is you PS3 oven baked now?"
PS3,3djhqq,philbertagain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. Right now it is extremely random rlod. Sometimes it will rlod right after I turn it on. Other times it will rlod when streaming(I haven't tried playing an online fps since I got it back the second time). But as of right now I can just turn it back on and it works fine while streaming. I still haven't got a ylod since I got it repaired by him, just completely random rlod.  He does show pictures of his equipment on eBay and he has a really informative description. He even goes into why he uses lead-free solder(it lasts longer). He has a 1 year warranty too. In the messages with him he has made me think he knows what he's talking about.  I asked for a refund because I was really aggrevated that he couldn't fix everything that was wrong. He said he would give me a CECHG model for free and said it should last for years because it had been refurbished by him and he uses better solder and thermal paste than sony. He said the CECHG model was the best one of the fat 80gb models. I think I'm going to have to do that and spend another $35 to ship mine to him. I've already spent $175 total on this so what's another $35."
PS3,3djhqq,philbertagain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"The Cechg will be a equivelent model to the Cechk... internal could be better but features are the same. This maybe the easiest option if you trust the guy.  The only reballers near me only do the RSX and not the cell, did he do both? Other than that YloD is caused by other less common issues too.  Its possible the mosfats need reballing... I dont think they are commonly done. Power suply and blueray can cause YloD too, just far less common.  If you can often play ps3 for awhile before YloD it is probable a hairline crack that is exacerbated from heating up.  There is a error code light mode that tells where the issue is but I cannot find a link just now."

PS3,3dh7xv,hemag,3,Thu Jul 16 06:35:08 2015 UTC,"Disgaea is amongst the most grindy games series out there. You don't have to do that much to progress through the story, but I'd you want to do any of the extra quests etc, be prepared to spend long hours grinding away."
PS3,3dh7xv,Vaccus,2,Thu Jul 16 11:00:32 2015 UTC,"Disgaea is a joy to play.  It's fun, smart, and interesting for the most part.  It is, however, the grindiest game of all time.  However, you can probably plow through the main story if you don't have any interest in the other parts.  It is, probably, less than 1/20th of the game though.  Watching the enemies scale crazily and figuring how to counter it/make wild dashes to the exit/die piteously is a large part of what makes it great."
PS3,3dh7xv,modix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"Played them all, and you should too. Played them forever and would go back and do it again in a heart beat. There's something about doing billions in damage."
PS3,3dh7xv,kenxzero,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:10:08 2015 UTC,"(i hear it's very hard and complicated though).   The main gameplay of Disgaea is one of the clearer games in which the solution to everything is just ""more leveling"". In a lot of ways, the game itself is easy, almost too easy... all the challenge comes from how far you can get on how little rather than whether you can finish, or how optimally you can complete the postgame (since simply blundering around and fighting whatever seems to be present itself won't get you all that far, you need a plan)."
PS3,3dh7xv,jerf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:45:40 2015 UTC,"the solution to everything is just ""more leveling""   I think you hit it right in saying it's more about how to get from point a to point b level-wise.  Grinding inefficiently is near infinite time in this game.  Planning out which characters and which weapons and which specialists to collect is a large part of the planning.  The leveling part is just the byproduct for the most part (especially in the later games, with all the further other things to grind)."
PS3,3dh7xv,modix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:07:13 2015 UTC,"so basically what everyone here is saying is that the games are good, but the stories are short, and most of the game is about the after game completionist mentality.    well i think i'll give it a pass for the moment, but may get it later down the line."
PS3,3dh7xv,modix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:19:31 2015 UTC,"after game completionist mentality   It's probably a bit different than you think.  This isn't about collecting all the stars or OCD number crunching.  You're given challenges that are fun, interesting, and are still voiced/acted/etc.  It's not some boring sit through for those that love seeing higher numbers (though that is a part of it).  It's a polished part of the game.  They know this is part of it and treat it with more care than some people treat the main game."

PS3,3df08b,Calisthenickid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:25:51 2015 UTC,"A must have list has so many variables.  Instead why not say 5 or 6 games you enjoyed in the past?  Do you living in a gaming vacuum were your last system was a atari or did you have a PC or 360 and play some of the cross plaforms already? If you only want exclusives the side bar has a list.  From the list you posted I think you like stylized action horror with cool protagonists,  also South Park.  God of War, Dantes Inferno, Devil May Cry, Bioshock 1 or 2 may all work for you.  If you like Suda 51 killer is dead and short (short) piece are available.  If you chose south park cause its an RPG Ni No Kuni or Tales of Symphonia are both good. If for humor Deadpool and Portal 1 and 2 are funny, though neither is South Park. Borderlands 1, 2, P may scratch both those itches at once.  If cheap is the primary concern PSN has some great sales from time to time or I think game stop has a 4 for 10 sale in the US periodically.   Also you can download all sorts of demos (timed trials if you are ps+ too)  I don't mean to rag on you but these   ""Tell me what I want"" posts are very common and mostly unanswerable with out more insight in to the asker."

Sorry for not being more specific, I do like Suda 51 and Grasshopper Manufacture games the best, heard Killer is Dead was only OK but if I find it cheap enough than I'll get it.   I bought South Park Stick of Truth not because it was an RPG (It's actually the first and only RPG I've played) but because it's a GOOD South Park game and I'm a pretty big fan of the show. I liked it because it's a pretty simplistic RPG I'm not really into all of the really complex RPGs.   I'm also going to download some of the older PSOne games because they're pretty cheap and I can't be bothered digging through my house trying to find the old PSOne discs.  God of War, and Devil May Cry from what I've heard are pretty tough games, I like games with a bit of a challenge but not brutally difficult."

PS3,3de5cu,anh86,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:26:27 2015 UTC,So I'm screwed for 6 months?
PS3,3dee8q,TheCuriousArtist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"sounds like your laser died, your ps3 and your brother's ps3 do they have the same serial/model number ? if not it won't work if you change the drive, i had the same problem with my ps3 laser it didn't load games anymore so i changed it with a new laser and now it's working fine"
PS3,3dee8q,ThePain1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:29:44 2015 UTC,It quit functioning at all. It won't take discs in. I can get a new drive for ~$60 online. Do you think it would be worth it?
PS3,3dee8q,ThePain1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:16:38 2015 UTC,you can't buy random laser's/drive's online that don't match your ps3 model number. look what number your ps3 has and look online for a new drive/laser with the same model number. if you want to play ps3 sure it is worth it. i paid around 40 for a new laser.
PS3,3dcnh8,spirit32,-1,Wed Jul 15 05:54:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Undead Nightmare is included.  I'm wrong. It shows up on the menu as an option but the bundle only comes with the Deadly Assassin Outfit, Warhorse, Golden Guns and Compliments of the House addons."

I bought it because someone before also said Undead Nightmare would be included. I was very dissapointed, kind of strange to see someone saying false shit again though."
PS3,3dcnh8,freezerburn666,2,Wed Jul 15 13:38:08 2015 UTC,I was going to make the same mistake thanks god you showed up
PS3,3dcnh8,freezerburn666,2,Wed Jul 15 17:07:44 2015 UTC,It's is still a pretty good deal but not as good as I was hoping it was going to be.
PS3,3dcnh8,NoiseTherapy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:51:34 2015 UTC,You know I need so much justification to buy a game specially a digital version :/
PS3,3dcnh8,specterofthepast,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:02:09 2015 UTC,I did the exact same thing the last time they had this deal. I wound up purchasing the undead nightmare.

PS3,3de1k7,TenTonneMackerel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:23:30 2015 UTC,So...jailbreak?
PS3,3de1k7,TenTonneMackerel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:24:51 2015 UTC,"Basically the only method, unless you get one of those fancy things that allow you to map a 360 controller to a PS3 and vice versa, because the you would be able to map your own buttons."
PS3,3de1k7,misturcheef,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:27:25 2015 UTC,Another complication - Im using my DS4. Will that cause any issues?
PS3,3de1k7,KingOfSomeThings,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:09:06 2015 UTC,Probably. I would say unless you really want to play the game it's not worth it. As devices like those I suggested are generally expensive.
PS3,3dfben,overslept-,2,Wed Jul 15 20:42:20 2015 UTC,You must be confused because PS3 doesn't even play mkv files at all.
PS3,3dfben,dvd_sandwich,2,Thu Jul 16 08:52:36 2015 UTC,"MKV is just a container, not a format in and of itself. Some MKV files will play on PS3 if they are encoded as standard MP4, but if not you'll have to re-encode to get them to play. There's plenty of software that will do it, but expect a marginal loss in quality and gain in file size. Your laptop is an easier case, since you can just download the codecs you need to play the videos. These kinds of operations get kind of technical though--not sure how tech savvy you consider yourself."
PS3,3dfben,LukeLC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:16:04 2015 UTC,thanks for the detailed answer! im not very tech savy but what you said made sense.
PS3,3dfben,LukeLC,2,Wed Jul 15 21:33:55 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! Forgot to mention before, you might check out this video converter. It's free and has presets for converting your MKV files into files your PS3 can play. It's not the best solution but if you don't want to dive into the nitty-gritty of video formats to get the best possible quality and lowest possible filesize it's definitely the easiest option."
PS3,3dfac9,Spydurr117,3,Wed Jul 15 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"I believe it has to do with connecting to your phone for spotify, youtube, etc,"

PS3,3dfac9,MrSnoozen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:15:10 2015 UTC,Is there any way I can connect to it
PS3,3dfac9,z3kr0m,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:34:48 2015 UTC,It is designed for remote play for the PSP and Vita to directly connect to it. We can't connect to it at all.
PS3,3dfac9,desentizised,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:39:03 2015 UTC,This is the right answer. It has nothing to do with a Media Server or phone connectivity.

PS3,3dahyd,novembr,2,Wed Jul 15 02:03:40 2015 UTC,Did they ever add the 'no teams' (or whatever it was called) function to the DLC maps? I thought it was a bummer back when I was playing that they didn't have this feature when I just wanted to play a quick pug match and not get annihilated by a dedicated team.
PS3,3dahyd,doitforthelolz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:55:14 2015 UTC,Unfortunately they did not.

PS3,3dahyd,zgrove,2,Wed Jul 15 05:46:11 2015 UTC,"One match it just clicked for me (no pun intended) and I went from the guy that was holding back the team to the one that was carrying it. It was a couple weeks into me playing, but it felt so good for it to go from frustrating (and still fun) to something just amazing."
PS3,3dahyd,TheHawks819,3,Wed Jul 15 05:55:17 2015 UTC,Do you guys think with the maps free that player count will increase on the DLC?
PS3,3dahyd,Kosooki_mrav,3,Tue Jul 14 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"Well, let's hope they make this free for good , make it mandatory download and merge the playlists. That would be awesome."
PS3,3dahyd,noobalert,3,Wed Jul 15 04:28:21 2015 UTC,Do the maps usually cost money?
PS3,3dahyd,PS3s,9,Tue Jul 14 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"yup. they were available as part of the season pass (which is no longer available), but other than that, they have as far as I know always cost money. also the online pass still costs money, which is a shame. Uncharted 3 got rid of the online pass requirement on PS3."

PS3,3dahyd,HawkinsDB,5,Tue Jul 14 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"TLOU remastered already includes all of these things, this is just stuff listed for PS3 version.  Except for The left behind stand alone, which can be bought seperately on both systems.  I think this Naughty Dog Deal is something that is being tied in with episode 2 of ""Conversations with creators with Wil Wheaton"" that they have going on."

If he starts to break free, just throw him then pick him up again.  You can also lure them closer to the circle before killing them so you don't have as big a distance to travel before they disintegrate."
PS3,3df3mc,Vaccus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:07:51 2015 UTC,Tried luring but my pawns are bloodthirsty when they aren't getting in my way or saying annoying things over and over.  I finally hopscotched a corpse into the circle but it took forever.  There are a lot of little annoying issues with this game.  Like I have a quest I can't complete because I picked it up after I completed it and lord what I would do for a mount/4 player drop in drop out co-op/better fast travel.

I can't really attribute its longevity to anything besides luck. I take good care of my things, but I haven't done anything extraordinary to take care of it. Hell, when I was in college, I would pack it up in my carry on traveling from DC to LA many times and it withstood all that even. I  dust it every now and then..."
PS3,3dcjp0,FlowDeluxe,2,Wed Jul 15 05:49:12 2015 UTC,Heck yeah my fat boy is still by my side going strong
PS3,3dcjp0,thejussman,2,Wed Jul 15 13:21:20 2015 UTC,I do. I did have it reballed about 2 years ago. Best $100 I ever spent.
PS3,3dcjp0,cheviot,2,Wed Jul 15 13:51:51 2015 UTC,"Launch 60gb here she turns on everyday to update itself , no issues at all here , upgraded PSU , and thermal paste ."

PS3,3dcjp0,philbertagain,2,Wed Jul 15 16:19:29 2015 UTC,"It's not a launch unit but it is a fat model (originally a PAL 40GB). No modifications besides a hard drive change and it's still working fine, other than being loud as fuck. It did have some issues for a while where it would freeze at random, but I pinned that down to  a bad hard drive connection. Due to a stripped screw the HDD caddy is not in the best state anymore (I had to twist one of the metal tabs until it broke to get the original drive out), but a little bending and forcing got everything working again. I looked for a replacement caddy but I couldn't find one for the fat PS3 anywhere.    I've done nothing special to keep it going; I got it used for £60 and have been prepared to replace it with a new unit basically since I got it, but it still keeps on trucking. I'm quite happy to be honest because the original fatty is by far the nicest looking unit. It's huge, heavy, and loud, but there's something special about it."
PS3,3dcm9n,alcoholaddict,3,Wed Jul 15 05:40:35 2015 UTC,"After reading your post, I don't think thermal paste would help, and that's just my opinion.  Recently, I've been having a problem too. But it's quite different than yours. If I had to give any advice, I would give you these few things that might help.  - 1. Turn your PS3 off but don't unplug it.  - 2. Press and hold the power button, keep holding until you hear about three beeps, soon it will turn off. - 3. Press and hold again, wait for a beep, then wait for 2 quick beeps. Then take your finger off the power button. Your PS3 should have now entered Safe Mode. You will be given some options once you connect your Sony PS3 controller with the wire to your system.  - 4. We don't want to restore your playstation, we just want to rebuild database. Select 'rebuild database'.       By what I read, I think this will help. If it doesn't, it might be a hardware problem. I wish you the best of luck."

PS3,3daqs0,Teh_akod,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:40:47 2015 UTC,No. They don't price match physical goods to the prices of digital goods - they are different products.

PS3,3daqs0,fidelityastro,0,Tue Jul 14 22:07:53 2015 UTC,I really liked Bully and normally find rockstar's open world games to be dull. Lots to do and the unusual setting makes the plot more interesting than it should be.

PS3,3daqs0,Calisthenickid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:10:20 2015 UTC,This! I remember the old midnight club on ps2 it was awesome and when you play midnight club Los Angeles you'll realise it looks similar to gta v's map same city dude but smaller scale. Worth it.

PS3,3dbcj5,sony4life,3,Tue Jul 14 23:16:42 2015 UTC,Thank god!  I would never go into the store to check it because it loads slowly and each version of a game is listed separately. A plain-text list is so much nicer.
PS3,3dayfd,biil5,8,Tue Jul 14 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"I have it on my account mostly from my PS4, so its on both systems. Honestly, unless there's a Indy game you're really interested in, I wouldn't get it. Not worth it anymore."
PS3,3dayfd,JebusOfEagles,4,Tue Jul 14 21:51:24 2015 UTC,If you have a ps4 as well it's definitely worth it
PS3,3dayfd,invaluableimp,3,Tue Jul 14 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"I keep mine active for when AAA PS4 games start droping. I don't own a PS4 and dont think I will in the next year or two but when I final get one the backlog will keep me entertained for quite some time. The same it true of the vita titles if I get a PStv, they should be hitting clearance bins soon enough as no one seems to be buying them.  While indie fever is getting a bit long in the tooth, many of the AAA games will have been played/bought. I can say the month we got Dishonoered I had just purchased it at retail. Oddworld was a nice one with retroactive crossbuy. My backlog is so huge I have not touched Juarez, Theif or Yakuza.  This month I was happy to receive Rain, I had considered buying it often and am glad I did not.  I was also suprised by Rogue Legacy and Race the Sun.  It does feel like Sony is crapping out a bit when games that were recently 90 cents are included but I dont think we have seen the last AAAs... just dont be suprised if they are games you already played.  In the meantime, running a phat, the added protection of cloud saves makes me feel better."
PS3,3dayfd,philbertagain,3,Wed Jul 15 00:45:59 2015 UTC,Hasn't really been  worth it on ps4.
PS3,3dayfd,plumpasaurus,5,Wed Jul 15 01:24:01 2015 UTC,Mine was expired for about 2 months before I realized it. Have no desire to renew it. They haven't had a big name title in a while.
PS3,3dayfd,z9nine,5,Tue Jul 14 21:59:33 2015 UTC,"Don't... if the last 2 months are something to go by, they will most likely give shitty games for ps3. I still have 2 months left and i completely regret getting it.."
PS3,3dayfd,Issune91,2,Tue Jul 14 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with others. If you're a fan of indies, or still making your way through some PS+ games you haven't yet finished then resub. Otherwise, meh. As of late though it seems to mostly be indie titles. I've been pretty disappointed with PS+ these last few months. It's not that there's anything wrong with indie titles, but honestly I don't seem to enjoy them as much as other titles despite trying to, and there are so many (AAA type games that is) on the PS3 now that it should be fine to give out one every couple of months instead of sticking with the indies regularly. That said the automatic updates and cloud storage would still be a good reason to resub, as well as if you're planning to get a PS4 later so you can build up your library of PS4 games in advance. A friend suggested to me to enjoy PS+ for the other benefits, and not the monthly games, and honestly that seems to be a better way of going about it."
PS3,3dayfd,snowbell55,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:10:04 2015 UTC,That's why I renewed this past month for a year. I just like the auto updates and cloud storage. I did like Gunslinger last month through not sure why so many either disliked it or just didn't care for it. May was by far the worst month through.
PS3,3dayfd,unknownone32,4,Wed Jul 15 03:11:10 2015 UTC,"I let mine lapse about 3 months ago, and couldn't be happier. I only have a PS3, and for those who only have one console, I don't think PS+ has as great a value as it used to have. Even the PS+ discounts are pitiful. I look at sales and flash sales and play my backlog. I'm very happy with my decision."
PS3,3dayfd,bd31,3,Tue Jul 14 22:31:38 2015 UTC,"Not really; I'd recomend finding a friend with a ps4 and trying to piggyback of their account, if they're hesitant you could offer them like 15 bucks.  What I mean by this, is if someone ""activates"" their account on your ps3, you can play their plus games; they can do this on 2 in the case of ps3 so if you have a friend with a ps3 and ps4 you can still get his ps3 games without taking them away from him."

PS3,3dayfd,rand486,-2,Fri Jul 17 20:32:39 2015 UTC,You get free games. Discounts on new games.  Also you can continue to get PS4/Vita games on your account for when you buy one in the future. It was really nice to buy a PS4 and after putting in a bigger hard drive I already had about 40 games for it on the system that I had got for free or on offer with PS+ previously.

My guess is it's on the disc since you can't buy it on the PS store.

PS3,3da41t,NuclearPeanuts,3,Wed Jul 15 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"In Fallout 3 there is very easy, easy, normal, hard and very hard. The higher the dificulty the more experience you get. No hardcore mode.  In New Vegas there are the same difficulties but if you turn on Hardcore it will be locked to very hard I believe, the difficulty doesn't affect xp gain in this Fallout."
PS3,3da41t,TranceZero,3,Wed Jul 15 04:01:41 2015 UTC,"I remember playing ""The Pitt"", and wondering why Bethesda even bothered releasing it. It was short, puny on quests (one was just ""collect the hidden iron bars), and had no memorable characters. What happened there?  I remember ""Mothership Zeta"" being really difficult, I think I'd started it before the recommended level range. Those aliens could tank damage better than some WoW players.  ""Broken Steel"" was basically the ""Mass Effect 3 Ending"" situation, Bethesda swooping in to fix a bad close to the story. It was alright, pretty much was just an extension of the main story, like it needed to be.  My favorite was ""Point Lookout"". This felt like an actual DLC pack. New island, trippy story sequences, new enemies, and an engaging story. It was definitely a high point.  ""Operation: Anchorage"" was okay. Pre-War Fallout is neat."
PS3,3da41t,NuclearPeanuts,2,Wed Jul 15 00:23:23 2015 UTC,Yeah! Frickin' bullet sponge aliens. Especially those who could go invisible or some shi like that.
PS3,3da41t,MrGMinor,2,Wed Jul 15 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"I liked point lookout a lot, but for me it was the buggiest one. Froze constantly and for a while I gave up on it. Came back later to truck through, and it got a lil better. Anchorage was my least favorite, preferred Pitt over it greatly.  As for Broken Steel, no one should play this game without it."
PS3,3da41t,celticfan008,5,Wed Jul 15 13:55:32 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3 is probably in my top 5 favourite games ever, maybe even top 3. My first tattoo was the 101 vault door, with ""war never changes"" under it.  So maybe I'll go into why.  First and foremost is the world. The capital wasteland is amazing, its like a massive playground to me, full of twists and turns and unexpected finds. Often when I'm in between missions I'll just pick a direction and go until I can't go anymore. Or I'll see radio towers, power stations, or small settlements in the distance to distract me from my current mission. Yes it's colour palette is a bit bland, but there is more than enough variety of content to make it just as interesting in hour 300 as it was stepping out of the vault for the first time.  Second would be the tone. At times I really felt connected or invested in some characters, Amata, Agatha, and my father. Some people didn't like the story of 3 compared to NV. but I thought it was solid, simple, and straightforward, whereas in NV I just felt like some rando with no motivation to do anything, and with too many factions to keep track of and having to choose one over the other I didn't like either.  While the player may not have had as much of an impact as in NV, it still allowed them to play it at there own pace and style, and never felt forced, with maybe the exception of Raven rock. But at times it could be ridiculous, the bloody mess perk, the rock-it launcher, and all of the little nods to pop culture are so fresh and lighthearted that I never went more than 15min without having a moment to laugh about. Don't even get me started on mothership zeta, best dlc ever.  Next is gameplay. And I'll start by talking about NV. Everything they added I liked; ads, hardcore mode, building unique ammunition, I'm sure there are more but I can't remember them. That being said, I think 3 is just a better game. Things are far simpler and I liked getting perks every level rather than alternating, gives a better sense of progression and power for every level. I did however really like the faction system, as it could be used to expand on the stealth aspect by using disguises, on the other hand, having to worry about what you looked like to a certain factions could be tedious. Plus with broken steel you got to keep going, something vital to open world games imo, and something that really soured me about NV."
PS3,3da41t,Janderson2494,4,Tue Jul 14 21:09:48 2015 UTC,Wasn't this game near unplayable on ps3?

Still a great base game."

PS3,3da41t,Karo2theG,2,Tue Jul 14 18:49:57 2015 UTC,The GOTY. I just played it. It already ran poorly on the console and it would slow down the longer you had the game on. Transitioning to vats mode was alright sometimes and other times it literally took a full minute to show the percentage hit chances (it happened a couple times for me. I had the game running for a few hours)

PS3,3da41t,Cardboard_Waffle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:37:09 2015 UTC,Currently playing this for the first time. There is a lot I like about it. I played Skyrim first which might have skewed my opinion as I kept comparing the two. The first few hours were slow for me. As soon as I hit the wasteland I started having a blast. The VATS is one of my favorite parts of the game. I like targeting the weapons of a group to disarm them.

Everything was so underwhelming. Graphics, writing, sounds, animations. Everything. The final ""climactic"" battle had awful production values, and was pathetic tbh. I wouldn't be suprised if 3 is even worse, being older, and always being referred to as the worse of the two. 6/10"

The combat is responsive and the controls are good, which is what I'm looking for.   I actually recently picked this game up for £2 I'd say it is worth more than that. I'm not going to complain about that though.  It is a good thing that they decided give Skyrim a familiar interface as it would take less time to learn.  The game also runs well on the PS3 which is to be expected.    Also, in the game, where can I find health? I'm finding it really difficult as I have only one bar of health left. Most places are too risky to visit. My character is too vulnerable. Any suggestions? Should I just start over?"

PS3,3d9w74,SinisterIntent,6,Tue Jul 14 18:56:03 2015 UTC,"It could be a problem with your hard-drive, if I recall correctly most big new games install part of the game onto the hard-drive and play the rest off of the disk (if I recall correctly LBP1 didn't have an install but I could be wrong) - there's probably something going wrong with the connection there.   Have you replaced the hard-drive at all for a bigger one in the past? You could try putting the old one back and playing a game and if it works that'd single out the problem.   You could also test how download-only games play as that would be exclusively the hard-drive at work.   Do Blu-rays/DVDs play fine? If they do then you can rule-out there being a problem with the disk-drive/laser.   If you're able to play LBP 1 with NO problems then you can probably rule out Graphics problems.   It could also be that newer games are forcing your system to over-heat and shut-down, but I believe that the PS3 has an inbuilt way of showing this as an error (i.e. it wouldn't become unresponsive and would turn itself off and beep a number of times)."

PS3,3d9w74,Chance_Giguiere,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:47:31 2015 UTC,I would think it would be hard drive too. Especially since nothing downloaded works.

However, the situation is more complicated. It's possible that you're still right about it being good to run the fans. If you immediately shut down, the heat will spread from the chips to the attached parts, instead of mostly going out heatsinks into the moving air.

PS3,3d6m4o,one80oneday,2,Tue Jul 14 02:35:06 2015 UTC,Ain't nobody got time for that  /s  Nice tip!
PS3,3d6m4o,Aram_Fingal,2,Tue Jul 14 15:03:32 2015 UTC,"When you are done with a heavy gaming session, leave your PS3 on the XMB for 15-20 minutes. This allows your PS3 to slowly cool itself off at a rate that doesn't cause extreme contracting.   This may be intuitive, but I'm not sure it's correct.  I have an embarrassingly long background in home theater using front projectors.  What many people in this field have discovered is that it may cause a slower, more gentle cool down phase in a projector if, after you turn it off, you unplug it, thereby not allowing the projector's fan to cool it down.   The fan on after power off strategy was actually devised to allow the projector to be started again as soon as possible and not as a protective measure for the bulb and projector.  Now, the difference with a PS3 is that sitting at XMB still uses some CPU/GPU and thus still produces some heat.  It may be that going from game -> XMB with fan on causes a faster cool down (to baseline XMB levels) than simply shutting the system off."

PS3,3d4rt1,Cardboard_Waffle,4,Mon Jul 13 14:57:06 2015 UTC,It's not even going to have split screen. I feel like it will be a far inferior version to the ps4 one.

PS3,3d4rt1,typebar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:26:07 2015 UTC,THPS is more of an arcade skateboarding game. So the physics are exaggerated.
PS3,3d4rt1,XavandSo,-1,Tue Jul 14 03:11:27 2015 UTC,"Looking forward to this, even though it does look a bit rough. Going to buy the PS3 version even though I have a PS4. I don't care for online multiplayer and being $25 (AUD) cheaper is always good.  THPS 4 was my favourite. Still cheesed it wasn't represented in the HD collection a few years back."
PS3,3d4rt1,novembr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"I urge you to not even feel compelled to buy even the PS3 version. Wait for reviews. Robomodo has not made a name for themselves and even developed the awful THPS HD game. It's not a good sign. My guess is that it'll be a pale imitation of even the worst of the original Tony Hawk games and will only be fit for buying in a flash sale. I hope I'm wrong, though..."
PS3,3d4rt1,XavandSo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:43:49 2015 UTC,I'm definitely waiting for reviews. I'll have Fallout 4 and Metal Gear Solid V at least to make me wait. I'm probably going to buy it on Boxing Day (26th of December) for cheap.

PS3,3d4arr,dotisinjail,6,Mon Jul 13 12:16:52 2015 UTC,"Unless you're using a local media server, or something of that ilk, no.  UPnP stands for Universal Plug 'n' Play. It's the ability for devices within your network to discover each other. If you're not trying to use a service which requires devices to discover each other (e.g. Plex Media Server), then you don't need UPnP."
PS3,3d4arr,Oni_Kami,5,Mon Jul 13 15:03:55 2015 UTC,"mine always says that too, regardless of whether or not it is enabled on my router. doesn't seem to affect my online gameplay though."
PS3,3d4arr,PS3s,2,Mon Jul 13 12:55:12 2015 UTC,"There are two different Upnp implementations that can be talked about. One is for updating information in your home router, the other is for streaming media on your network.   I am guessing your message is related to your router's upnp settings."
PS3,3d4arr,btreecat,2,Mon Jul 13 15:49:46 2015 UTC,"in the context your PS3 is complaining its wanting to use UPNP to tell your router what ports to forward back to itself in order to easily connect with Internet services (multiplayer and voice) while UPnP makes for easy broadcasting of services and servers on your local network segment, it's heavy lifting job was/is to not force people that lack router/TCP/IP knowledge inside of the router configuration page. UPnP is not required it's just one option of serval to get your PS3 online.   tldr: enable upnp on your router if it supports it. just make sure you're using the latest firmware for said router."
PS3,3d4arr,klybn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:30:02 2015 UTC,I enabled it and it's still says not available.
PS3,3d4arr,klybn,2,Tue Jul 14 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"make sure you're running the latest firmware on your router. upnp isn't bull it proof and depending on the care taken by the people who wrote the upnp proxy and network stack you could be in the precarious position of having a half functional implementation. if the firmware update doesn't address it you may just need to ignore the message and relay on NAT, which according to the above seems to imply you're functional online via your routers more basic functions."

PS3,3d7dyl,youwakjoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:30:08 2015 UTC,"Well first do your research of what size data storage you want, check CL,  BUT check pawn shops. I've been a Sony guy for a long time, but last weekend bought an xbox 360,  500 g,  two controllers (1 matching)  for 195, plus the chic added 6 month warranty at no cost!! And I saw many ps3, a ps4 available!!  So call around the pawn shops. (i negotiated $5 off one controller and got both hdmi and rbg cords!)"
PS3,3d7dyl,lvav68,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:18:10 2015 UTC,I bought a PS3 just last week actually. I went for the original 60GB one so that I could play my PS2 games. The 60GB is a bit small and mine is already quite low because there are so many updates for games nowadays. I'd say go for at least an 80GB or the space will be gone quickly. Also if you don't need/want backwards compatibility then get either the slim or super slim. The original ones are prone to overheating and YLOD.
PS3,3d7dyl,Poodwaddle999,0,Tue Jul 14 16:13:42 2015 UTC,"you want a ps4? if you not, mandatory buy the uncharted trilogy have ps2? no? buy shadow of the colossus. do you like movies? Metal gear solid 4 I've 500gb and thats ok (buyed more digital). and I remomend de ultra slim model, its fine."
PS3,3d4wbb,RoneDriver,7,Mon Jul 13 15:29:24 2015 UTC,"That seems a bit extreme. I imagine we'll get plenty of warning before Sony shuts down their servers. And when the time comes, I'll probably just put everything onto an external hard drive. Your way is definitely the safest, though."
PS3,3d4wbb,galber,4,Mon Jul 13 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"The thought occurred to me that some day in the future we won't be able to download our purchases from the PSN store any more as Sony will surely close down the servers eventually. I've downloaded everything I've ever bought and intend to use it as a backup for when the servers shut down and if my primary console fails.   there is no good answer for this. Downloaded games need to be licensed and PS3s need to be activated for games to work. you can't do that without the PSN. Even if you have multiple PS3s, you can only have your games activated on two at a time. You can make backups to an external hard drive, but when you restore them to a different PS3, you'll still need to be able to log in and license them.  When you buy a downloaded game on a console, you don't own it in the traditional sense. You are licensing the game. If Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo decide to not let you play the game in the future, there is little you can do, beyond not plugging your console into the internet, and hoping it never breaks. When the time comes for Sony to shut down the PSN or end support for the PS3, the only thing that will save downloaded games is some kind of patch that removes or otherwise circumvents DRM. In all of the times Sony has shut down an online service (and they have done it more than once), they have never offered a patch to remove DRM.   It is not a perfect solution, but if you want to be able to play games indefinitely, you need to buy physical copies. Of course not all games have physical releases, and some games require patches to work right, so even physical copies don't solve the problem.   can I just use a HDD clone tool to copy in windows to copy data or does it need to be done    PS3 hard drives are encrypted. You can clone them, but they will only work in the original PS3. However if you are using the same hardware, you don't even need to clone them, you can just install a hard drive, have the PS3 format it, load it up, remove it, install a new one, and repeat as often as you like. all the drives will work in said hardware, as long as the PS3 firmware doesn't change."
PS3,3d4wbb,PS3s,3,Mon Jul 13 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"So the only way to increase chances of replayability in the future is to copy a HDD a few times when it's filled with installed games, and keep them safe. But that will only cover HDD failure.  To cover console failure the only way is to kind of stock up, if the hardware were to die 10 years after the PSN is taken down you wouldn't be able to download any of your purchases to a new second hand console. The only solution to this is to activate the games on more than the two consoles that are allowed, and since Sony also has in place a deactivation limit of once every 6 months this process gets long winded.   It's kind of ridiculous really, you'd need to buy two PS3's and activate them, download everything onto the hard drives of them, then keep a clone of those drives somewhere safe, preferably multiple backups.  Then you'd deactivate those PS3 systems and buy two more, activate them and repeat the process  outlined above, keeping backups safe.   Even this doesn't get round the fact (IIRC) that some games have lifetime activation limits, once they run out and your console dies and the PSN is down, unless Sony offer a solution you are boned. Fingers crossed for decent emulation in the future, and that somebody finds a way to rip the non-physical games from the encrypted HDD's in the course of time.  There comes a point I suppose, when it's not worth it. We'll have to accept that in the future, with physical media degradation, and the PSNs inevitable closure, some games will just be really difficult to play."
PS3,3d4wbb,PS3s,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:31:46 2015 UTC,"not too many games from the PS3 era will ever truly be lost, at least not anything decent. First of all, most PS3 games are available on other platforms. The Xbox 360 may not be much better in terms of downloaded games, but PC games are covered pretty well for future generations. Second, all the good exclusives seem to get ported forward sooner or later. The Last of Us came out on PS4 pretty quickly, and the Uncharted series is on the way. Of course this means you will have to re-buy your games, but this is nothing new. People have been re-buying media for new platforms since the dawn of analog recording. You might have loved your turn-of-the-twentieth-century wax cylinders, but by 1915, it was clear disc records were the way of the future, so if your cylinder phonograph broke beyond repair, you were out of luck."
PS3,3d4wbb,IsThisMeQM,2,Mon Jul 13 19:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Having to purchase media for a second time sucks. If it comes down to it there will always be LP's of Red Dead Redemption to show the grandkids. At least Microsoft is almost doing something about it with the 360 backwards compatibility on the X1, but even that is only downloading a re coded version that is available to run on the new hardware."
PS3,3d4wbb,yaktoast,2,Mon Jul 13 19:19:55 2015 UTC,And this is why I buy disks when I can
PS3,3d4wbb,LukeLC,2,Mon Jul 13 22:04:16 2015 UTC,"Your best bet would be to put the 2nd PS3 on Custom Firmware (now or later) so you can install any PSN game, DLC, Game Patches, or System Updates as you please. You can download the games, updates, and DLC simply from your web browser and then back it up somewhere for safe keeping. Or you can download them via your backup manager on the PS3. So for now you could just grab your PSN games, DLC, and patches and store them on an external drive for if or when they become unavailable in the future. At that point you could put the PS3 on Custom Firmware and still have fully operational games. Although by that point, if Sony isn't making these things available in the distant future then someone may have an official firmware solution to use."
PS3,3d4wbb,twistytwisted,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:10:00 2015 UTC,"Occasionally I wonder about this myself, but a) it likely won't happen for literally decades, and b) by that time you'll be able to emulate PS3 games on your PC or play actual PC ports of pretty much everything. So my recommendation would be don't spend a lot of money on making backups now. Heck, by the time it becomes necessary, you may not even be interested in replaying any of them.  Just look at the Playstation Classics section of the store--PS1 games released a full 20 years ago are still accessible today, and some developers are still releasing their PS1 and PS2 games on the store. There's a market for old games, and that's not going to change.  And if all else fails, the community will keep the PS3 alive. PS3 emulation is already taking huge strides, so just keep your controllers around. I completely stand for buying your games, so don't get the wrong idea when I talk about emulation. It's for preserving the past."
PS3,3d4wbb,twistytwisted,0,Wed Jul 15 01:16:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people keep freaking out about this. The PSP still works on PSN. PSN hasn't cut support for any device yet, and the PS3 won't be the first."

It is loads of fun, can be challenging especially when it comes to ship battles, an overall great experience, this far... have not beaten it yet, but I am taking my time, enjoying it.

PS3,3d4yxt,PS3s,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:04:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for this!  Did I read somewhere on this sub that ps3 has a summer sale usually? Maybe I'll grab it then.
PS3,3d4yxt,novembr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:30:58 2015 UTC,"It has in the past, but I wouldn't count on seeing it go on sale very often. It was critically acclaimed, so it probably hasn't needed to lower its price in order to gain sales. The PS4 version is coming out soon and since it's crossbuy I wouldn't count on it being on sale since you'd be able to pick up the newer version cheap when they might be looking to maximize profits (though if they really wanted to do that they wouldn't have made it cross buy). Hard to say.  Note that crossbuy isn't valid for the physical version of the game, though, so don't go buying the disc and expecting to get the PS4 version along with it."
PS3,3d4yxt,matrixifyme,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:02:47 2015 UTC,"I actually bought it without thinking twice because the developer (that game company) is a small team and I've loved all their games, so I'm giving them my full support, and hope for more games from them on PS4. Whereas usually I'm pretty cheap and only buy games on sale. Journey and Fez were the only 2 games I paid full price for, so to support the little guys, and it also made me real warm inside when both games are cross play."
PS3,3d24ce,rehsarht,6,Sun Jul 12 22:23:08 2015 UTC,Yes. Import only.
PS3,3d24ce,al_ien5000,2,Sun Jul 12 22:45:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, no biggie. My first console in years, so not clear on a lot of stuff. If I buy this I should be able to play it no problem, am I right?"
PS3,3d24ce,al_ien5000,3,Sun Jul 12 23:01:45 2015 UTC,That is what I bought and it works fine.
PS3,3d24ce,Dahpu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:48:57 2015 UTC,"Right on, thanks a ton, going to order now."
PS3,3d24ce,ShadowStrikerPL,2,Mon Jul 13 03:10:21 2015 UTC,Yes AFAIK are all PS3 games region free.
PS3,3d24ce,Not_a_Zaku,4,Sun Jul 12 23:39:48 2015 UTC,Only Persona 4 Arena is region locked
PS3,3d24ce,Potat4o,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:09:43 2015 UTC,Reverse importation fears because the US version of the game had all the Japanese language options.
PS3,3d24ce,mzupeman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:43:01 2015 UTC,Just FYI. The disc version just contains the digital download. Which you then install like any other download. Except you need the disc any time you want to play.
PS3,3d24ce,mzupeman,2,Mon Jul 13 07:00:53 2015 UTC,I did actually import Okami HD from Japan. Worth it.
PS3,3d24ce,myrkvid,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:41:56 2015 UTC,"Did it play straight off the disc or did you have to download it still, like /u/Potat4o said above?"
PS3,3d1ywa,StratoLion,13,Sun Jul 12 21:39:52 2015 UTC,"Is it ffxiv or ffxiv a realm reborn? Realm reborn is a relaunch of the original (as of 2013) and just released its first expansion a couple of weeks ago.   The ps3 version is less in demand, though. Most players play ps4 or PC. And, as others have said, it's a monthly sub game so the base doesn't have to be too expensive."
PS3,3d1ywa,Matriss,2,Sun Jul 12 22:42:03 2015 UTC,Only ARR was available on PS3.
PS3,3d1ywa,Broward,2,Mon Jul 13 00:50:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, there you go. I play FFXIV but I never touched 1.0 so I did not know that."
PS3,3d1ywa,Matriss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:41:50 2015 UTC,"its ARR, just a different box art"
PS3,3d1ywa,sony4life,10,Mon Jul 13 00:17:10 2015 UTC,You still have to pay for the monthly sub fee and expansions
PS3,3d1ywa,3-cheese,2,Mon Jul 13 01:31:42 2015 UTC,Thank you!
PS3,3d1ywa,robotiod,3,Mon Jul 13 11:40:38 2015 UTC,"As someone that bought the PS3 version in January for £2.50 on amazon let me tell you it isn't cheap. I have since bought a PS4 (just for FF14) bought the collectors edition (on PS4), Bought the Heavensward collectors edition, and paid for the subscription every month.  Believe me the cheap price is like a drug dealer giving out tasters."
PS3,3d1ywa,Mship2,3,Mon Jul 13 06:27:38 2015 UTC,because its on ebay and the probably used the first month code that came with the game?  All the other listing show the game at about the regular price.
PS3,3d1ywa,sony4life,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:09:45 2015 UTC,"it says Brand New though, so you would assume they're sealed copies"
PS3,3d1ywa,bringmethestone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:15:44 2015 UTC,I got it about that cheap off amazon a while back
PS3,3d1ywa,Gaffeire,2,Mon Jul 13 11:12:07 2015 UTC,"It's cheap because you're basically getting a month trial for that price, after that it's a monthly payment. There's also a 2 week free trial on the store, which probably made the retail version drop in price. EU Store link"
PS3,3d1ywa,themoondog,2,Mon Jul 13 02:02:57 2015 UTC,Are the servers still online? What's the catch?
PS3,3d1ywa,403UsernameForbidden,18,Sun Jul 12 21:40:19 2015 UTC,monthly sub
PS3,3d1ywa,sony4life,4,Sun Jul 12 21:53:38 2015 UTC,"Plus an expansion that costs around 40 USD.  Edit:  I'm not sure if the new expansion also includes the base game.  Either way, I'm not a fan of the idea of paid expansions on a subscription based MMO."
PS3,3d1ywa,shadowstreak,5,Sun Jul 12 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"new expansion (Heavensward) does not include base game, though there are bundles available"
PS3,3d1ywa,kovensky,3,Mon Jul 13 00:16:19 2015 UTC,I wouldn't buy the expansion until you actually beat the main story quest though. If you're a light gamer like me it took roughly two months and playing 1-3 hours a day.
PS3,3d1ywa,herodrink,2,Mon Jul 13 00:41:08 2015 UTC,"It's worth it getting it right after reaching level 50, as it'll allow you to gain experience past that. By the time you unlock the expansion content you'll have a nice head start in the leveling."
PS3,3d1ywa,kovensky,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:05:49 2015 UTC,is this true? I have tried completing quests on my 50 since im behind in the story quest and i am not getting any EXP.
PS3,3d1ywa,Zaeh,3,Mon Jul 13 05:14:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, they rebalanced all level 50 story quests to reward experience. The level 50 dungeons you have to do, though, give no experience (to avoid having high item level players speedrun-farm them)."
PS3,3d1ywa,Tonydiediedie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:57:45 2015 UTC,"The expansion has the same amount of content as a normal RPG would have on its own, rivaling the content that came with the base game.  So I'd say it's worth it."
PS3,3d1ywa,Tezasaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:34:24 2015 UTC,how much is it monthly?
PS3,3d1ywa,Recklesshavoc,-4,Tue Jul 14 17:32:23 2015 UTC,"Probably because it's the worst version of the game so there's lots of copies of it on shelves. Also, the game is a monthly sub with expansions. First taste is free/cheap, etc.."
PS3,3d1ywa,Tezasaurus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:24:35 2015 UTC,Worst Version?..wut
PS3,3d1ywa,Recklesshavoc,4,Mon Jul 13 01:42:40 2015 UTC,"The PS3 version is objectively the worst, PC and PS4 both look and perform much better."
PS3,3d1ywa,miles197,3,Mon Jul 13 02:02:05 2015 UTC,Ooooooh! I thought you were comparing base and expansion.. but hey.. maybe they're selling cheap b/c before the next expansion SE won't support PS3 anymore
PS3,3d1ywa,kuury,-4,Mon Jul 13 02:05:31 2015 UTC,"Because its an MMORPG on a console maybe? Fuck. That. Trust me. I've played it. It is near impossible to play without a mouse and keyboard which, thankfully, for this game, you can plug in and use. Still better to just buy MMOs on PC, but if you don't have one and want the game, grab a mouse and keyboard too. Also it's because it's relatively old and there's a subscription fee."
PS3,3d1ywa,AdmiralFrosty,3,Mon Jul 13 07:46:11 2015 UTC,"You can't really use the keyboard to play the game on PS3. You can move around with WASD if you mess with the settings, but you can't activate skills.  It plays just fine on a controller. The only thing you really need a keyboard for is is chatting."
PS3,3d1ywa,kuury,-2,Mon Jul 13 12:02:51 2015 UTC,"Wait, no skills? If you're using keyboard and mouse, they expect you to click on everything on the interface? That's insane."
PS3,3d1ywa,Dragon_Yeti,3,Mon Jul 13 14:08:03 2015 UTC,"No, they expect you to use a controller. The controller works fine."
PS3,3d1ywa,Zaeh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"I play a Scholar, one of the most micro managing classes in the game on just a PS4 controller. The game was designed with a controller in mind and works really well. I've logged over 2,000 hours on one."
PS3,3d1ywa,miles197,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:43:44 2015 UTC,Then you did not play the game.  Playing with a controller is just as easy as playing with a keyboard and a mouse. Not to mention that you can't play with a keyboard and a mouse on the PS3 version of the game.
PS3,3d1ywa,Zaeh,0,Tue Jul 14 03:36:41 2015 UTC,"I own the game and I HAVE played with a keyboard and mouse, and no, a controller on an MMORPG is a living nightmare"
PS3,3d1ywa,miles197,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"If you only own it on the PS3, then no, you haven't.  Except that FF XIV is concrete proof that that's not the case. Again, playing with a controller is just as efficient as playing with a keyboard and a mouse. The sole difference being typing."
PS3,3d1ywa,Zaeh,0,Tue Jul 14 03:51:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Maybe they patched it and took out keyboard/mouse support but I know I played with a keyboard and mouse. And personally, I think its atrocious playing an MMO with a controller, but I guess, considering I'm on /r/ps3, the fanboys will deny this."
PS3,3d1ywa,miles197,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:12:19 2015 UTC,"The controls while playing with a controller are like they've always been. They haven't changed or haven't been patched at all. The PS3 version never had keyboard and mouse support for playing. If you actually played the game with a keyboard and a mouse, then that was not the PS3 version, simple as that.  You'd think so, but again, FF XIV makes playing with a controller just as easy and just as efficient as playing with a keyboard and a mouse. It's not uncommon for people on PC to play with a controller as well.  Considering that you are literally the only person to claim this, it seems that you are trying to be some reverse-fanboy yourself."
PS3,3d1ywa,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:19:44 2015 UTC,"I know what I did, I literally took a keyboard from another room so I remember it but whatever"
PS3,3d1ywa,miles197,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"You clearly don't, as it's easily provable that the PS3 version has never had the support for actually playing with a keyboard and a mouse."
PS3,3d1ywa,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:43:03 2015 UTC,Haha I did it though
PS3,3d1ywa,jm2445,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:14:54 2015 UTC,"Except for the very reason stated, you didn't.  Either you're not remembering it right, misunderstanding something about it, or just flat out lying or trolling. Those are the options, so pick whichever you prefer."
PS3,3d1vya,ToxicBronson,8,Sun Jul 12 21:15:57 2015 UTC,It seems to work fine now in my experience.
PS3,3d1vya,ipissedinyourpool,7,Sun Jul 12 22:28:43 2015 UTC,Started using HBOGo since the beginning of the year and haven't run into any issues.
PS3,3d1vya,Eye360,5,Sun Jul 12 22:52:19 2015 UTC,Seems to work alright for me as well. Try it again and hopefully you'll have better results.
PS3,3d1vya,Ryno555,5,Sun Jul 12 23:20:21 2015 UTC,"HBO seems to be fairly shit everywhere when compared to industry leaders like Netflix.  PC HBO go drops frames and freezes when switching between full screen and in-browser sometimes.  HBO go on Chromecast has ""unknown error"" messages pop up completely failing playback all the time.  And it's not even allowed on Playstation by Comcast, so that's as bad as it can get.  If they didn't have such fantastic content, I would have quit using their streaming service long ago."
PS3,3d1vya,withoutapaddle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:41:24 2015 UTC,I never used it. Pc worked much better. Luckily the ps4 app is amazong. I think they just don't care as much about older devices.
PS3,3d1vya,gimpyjosh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:10:12 2015 UTC,Works well for me. Only had one night of unbearable buffering/low definition.
