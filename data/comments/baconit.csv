Log on to www.reddit.com via a desktop/laptop computer and see what the experience is like for you. Then compare this to your experience on Baconit. You could also use the mobile-specific website version (www.reddit.com/.compact) and compare that as well.   Try the different versions out and see which one you like best.

I was surprised to note a few differences since I'd only ever used it on 7.8. It does quit frequently as it had in 7.8. I've been trying to force myself to get used to Readit and you know what? It quits and does weird shit too. Maybe it's the nature of Reddit itself that makes it hard for any app to ""keep up"". Who knows, I'm no kind of developer. I'll most likely go back to Baconit."

baconit,3a03f1,anonymous6366,6,Tue Jun 16 17:20:31 2015 UTC,"It looks prettier, but it's not nearly as simple as Baconit imo"
baconit,3a03f1,treefitty350,3,Tue Jun 16 18:46:48 2015 UTC,Really? I used to use baconit but stopped cause I always had problems with it. Red it has worked pretty flawlessly for me and I think its pretty intuitive..
baconit,3a03f1,anonymous6366,3,Tue Jun 16 18:58:01 2015 UTC,"Readit has quite a few problems for me. First of all the startup. It takes the app like 20 second to load my massive list of subscribed subreddits. Until then, the app is unresponsive and the bottom bar doesn't show up. Another annoyance are the custom animations and the custom app bar which lag and delay my work a lot."
baconit,3a03f1,Type-21,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:08:07 2015 UTC,What phones do you guys have? I have an icon and this app runs perfectly on here.. Starts in about 2-4s only ever crashed once and super smooth. Maybe a slower phone causes problems with it?
baconit,3a03f1,anonymous6366,2,Wed Jun 17 03:59:00 2015 UTC,"Lumia 830. I really think it's because readit tries to load my list of subscribed subreddits at each start. I'm subscribed to 662 subreddits at the moment, so it takes like half a minute for readit to download the list and display it. baconit doesn't do that, it caches the list and loads it in the background, not interrupting my experience.  Also: today I tried changing settings and the app lagged a lot then crashed."
baconit,3a03f1,Type-21,2,Wed Jun 17 12:59:02 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I bet the number of subreddits is why. I have like 30 or so and everything is pretty fast
baconit,3a03f1,anonymous6366,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:25:41 2015 UTC,"I never have problems with Baconit and I think Readit tries too hard to be a good app, whereas Baconit was made to be as simple as possible, and I like that."
baconit,3a03f1,treefitty350,2,Tue Jun 16 19:14:59 2015 UTC,"I might start some OS war but imo, baconit is like WP os (or apple os, I not sure) where it compose and moderate the functions for the user,  whereas Readit is like Android, having all different settings here and there which might be good for modifications. I had two of them installed with different accounts, so each works for different functions. Though I spend more time on Baconit for some quick procrastination."
baconit,37gz66,Toomper,25,Wed May 27 15:45:33 2015 UTC,"Try swiping left or right to the next page, then back to the failed to load imgur page. Should work after that."
baconit,37gz66,bazookatooth27,5,Wed May 27 16:00:03 2015 UTC,I found this fix by accident.
baconit,37gz66,RedditingMyLifeAway,3,Thu May 28 01:27:53 2015 UTC,I just found out about it myself! Someone posted this helpful little tip a few weeks ago. Saved me from switching to another reddit app.
baconit,37gz66,bazookatooth27,9,Thu May 28 01:32:08 2015 UTC,"Tap on the story, which brings you to comments, and then tap the story again and tap 'Open Story Link.' Should work!"
baconit,37gz66,Jmaneldub,11,Wed May 27 16:45:07 2015 UTC,It get's really anotting having to do this for EVERY. SINGLE. GIF.  Switched over to Readit once it became free
baconit,37gz66,allisslothed,2,Wed May 27 19:27:29 2015 UTC,How is it?
baconit,37gz66,eskEMO_iwl,3,Wed May 27 21:43:50 2015 UTC,"No complaints so far.. Gifs load quickly, YouTube videos are embedded, no crashing (as of day 4, was a 2-3x a day thing on baconit).  The one thing I miss are gestures for voting. Have to click an arrow for up/down votes.."
baconit,37gz66,allisslothed,3,Wed May 27 21:51:29 2015 UTC,I don't even use the gestures. Sounds like I'll be checking out Readit lol
baconit,37gz66,eskEMO_iwl,1 point,Wed May 27 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"When you have a larger number of subscribed subreddits, the performance is horrible. On my Lumia 830 the app takes about 30 seconds to load & respond. Often it reacts very slowly, for example after pressing the back button it takes 3 second to actually respond. Sometimes the app simply crashes (closes). I assume this happens because I'm subscribed to about 600 subreddits. However baconit has absolutely no problem with that."
baconit,37gz66,Type-21,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:38:53 2015 UTC,"I have the same story. Currently have both apps and I'm slowly falling in love with Readit, which is what I'm using right now. The multi-tap thing for just watching a gif was getting on my nerves for Baconit, unfortunately. I love Baconit so I'm on the fence."
baconit,37gz66,lapetitejasmine,2,Fri Jun 19 06:53:00 2015 UTC,I get this now and again too and this works every time.
baconit,37gz66,trouzy,8,Wed May 27 19:00:27 2015 UTC,I switched to readit now that its free. Give it a try. It is actually pretty good.
baconit,37gz66,geared4war,1 point,Wed May 27 16:40:41 2015 UTC,Readit's free? Nice.
baconit,37gz66,DoctorJohnZoidbergMD,6,Wed May 27 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I still have Baconit on my phone, but after giving Readit a try I haven't gone back. I really enjoyed Baconit."
baconit,37gz66,geared4war,1 point,Wed May 27 19:31:25 2015 UTC,Same here. It's a shame because Baconit is a great app. But Readit is just a bit better.
baconit,37gz66,lapetitejasmine,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:54:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks. After seeing all these comments recommending it, I installed it. It really is a nice replacement. I purchased BaconIt, but think I will use Readit permanently now."
baconit,37gz66,xp3ll3d,7,Thu May 28 13:04:19 2015 UTC,"Switch to Readit. I gave Quinn plenty of time to FI his Baconit app - he blew it. Besides, once you get used to the Readit controls, it's better."
baconit,37gz66,allisslothed,2,Wed May 27 19:26:26 2015 UTC,same with my HTC 8X
baconit,37gz66,idma,3,Wed May 27 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"Switch to Readit, why so many people are still on Baconit posting this exact post every week amazes me."
baconit,37gz66,skizztle,2,Wed May 27 17:28:33 2015 UTC,Readit is so much slower it feels like I'm using Windows 98. It also crashes every third time I use it.
baconit,37gz66,Type-21,2,Thu Jun 4 18:12:14 2015 UTC,Switch to readit!
baconit,37gz66,EXCITED_BY_STARWARS,1 point,Thu May 28 00:29:20 2015 UTC,Download Readit.
baconit,37gz66,spydud22,1 point,Thu May 28 01:14:14 2015 UTC,Stop using baconit. This is what it does.
baconit,36hf3y,RXT00,3,Tue May 19 12:24:43 2015 UTC,"I still prefer baconit, way more faster and elegant in my opinion."
baconit,36hf3y,mass1v3,3,Thu Jun 4 06:29:38 2015 UTC,"Installed readit for five minutes, uninstalled it.  Completely prefer the look and feel of Baconit even if it's quasi-abandoned.  Will give readit another chance after Windows 10 and landscape view."
baconit,36hf3y,ralyons,6,Fri Jun 5 16:23:05 2015 UTC,To me Baconit •is• Reddit. I prefer it even to desktop PC.
baconit,36hf3y,latebird,2,Sun Jun 21 18:01:25 2015 UTC,Works for me thx
baconit,36hf3y,Trioseven7,2,Tue May 19 15:14:15 2015 UTC,Really love the interface compared to other clients..will buy the full version soon to support developers..keep the updates coming!
baconit,36hf3y,samderpinson,1 point,Wed May 20 08:06:25 2015 UTC,What's better ? Those landscapes always make me happy everytime I open the app and the dark background works well too. This is why I had this account tribute to it....
baconit,36hf3y,iamusingbaconit,9,Tue May 19 19:17:53 2015 UTC,"Readit has over ten times the features, hands down."
baconit,36hf3y,onedrummer2401,6,Wed May 20 00:56:46 2015 UTC,"And it actually works. Baconit, on the other hand, can't even play gifs on my phone..."
baconit,36hf3y,giulianosse,2,Wed May 20 21:15:47 2015 UTC,"I've had just enough of the random crashes on Baconit.  We're all very happy Quinn got a job with MS and now its time to leave back it, forever."
baconit,36hf3y,thesynod,3,Tue May 26 14:00:58 2015 UTC,Well I prefer baconit's design atm but the readit developer said he'll add landscape browsing and more when Windows 10 comes out.
baconit,36hf3y,egbertincognito,1 point,Tue May 19 22:09:30 2015 UTC,Well I've used it all day and it hasn't crashed once. I'm sold.
baconit,36hf3y,cbhem,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:04:43 2015 UTC,Uninstalled baconit to get rid of the cached data (it was using more than 450 mb). Tried installing readit. I don't think I'm going back to baconit.
baconit,366b87,mayank27tiwary,2,Sat May 16 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's more customization we need to come with Windows 10 Mobile!"
baconit,366b87,toskeee14,1 point,Sun May 24 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"I think ""on"" and ""off"" are the only options the OS allows when it comes to keyboard sounds."
baconit,366b87,nat_r,1 point,Sat May 16 17:27:11 2015 UTC,Yaa
baconit,3635sj,natchroll,2,Fri May 15 18:31:21 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you took a picture vertically and imgur removed the exif data so it wasn't auto rotated? Try taking pictures in landscape next time and see if it still happens.
baconit,3635sj,Darathin,1 point,Fri May 15 22:02:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll try that out."
baconit,3635sj,password1067,1 point,Fri May 15 22:58:36 2015 UTC,Rotate it 270° then when its posted it'll be right
baconit,3635sj,password1067,1 point,Fri May 15 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"I've already thought about that. I'm looking for a better solution, considering this only started happening recently."
baconit,3635sj,vishnupv,1 point,Fri May 15 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"I wish you luck, uninstall and reinstall."
baconit,35ua6a,lurker_2008,19,Wed May 13 15:49:45 2015 UTC,Because the app is nice and I prefer it to Readit?
baconit,35ua6a,pcweber111,22,Thu May 14 00:24:50 2015 UTC,"Well, personally, I just don't like Readit. I've tried and tried and tried... and keep going back to baconit"
baconit,35ua6a,TrentGoToBed,5,Wed May 13 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"That is how I felt at first too. I was partial to Baconit for a few reasons. Mainly I think I just wanted to support Quinn. He was one of the first to support us and was quite active in the community. Baconit just became more frustrating to use, even as a moderate redditor. I tried Readit a few times through my frustrations and disliked it every time. Then one day I just got fed up and decided I was going to make the switch. I enjoy Readit a lot, It is a much better running app. I have gotten used to the ui and find it nice to use now.   I hope Quinn is doing well (for some reason I want to say he works for MS now, but I don't remember where I read that) and will support him again in the future if he decides to get back to it. But for right now, I am a Readitor as well."
baconit,35ua6a,Xtrap,0,Thu May 14 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"With more Reddit apps coming to WP you are going to have much more choices. With that being said, you will eventually switch: I guarantee it.   Edit: Guys I'm sorry I came off as a Douche. That was not my intention. I really tried to say that with so many options you will eventually find one that you like."
baconit,35ua6a,treefitty350,5,Wed May 13 19:55:24 2015 UTC,That's not true. I'm much more happy with this simple minimalist design and the ease of browsing is fantastic. I can find my subs easily and nothing is cluttered.
baconit,35ua6a,Rpbns4ever,3,Wed May 13 21:42:52 2015 UTC,Why be a douche about it
baconit,35ua6a,backstept,16,Wed May 13 21:18:23 2015 UTC,I prefer Baconit because I can't stand Readit's UI. it's like they designed the app for android instead of WP . . .
baconit,35ua6a,SettleAsRobin,3,Wed May 13 17:08:02 2015 UTC,How? It doesn't have any top menu at all. I use readit over baconit because boconit is dead. The developer hasn't done a thing and the app isnt good anymore for me.
baconit,35ua6a,USxMARINE,-7,Wed May 13 17:26:42 2015 UTC,We are going to get a lot more Android like ports soon. So you might have to get used to it.
baconit,35ua6a,weedybix,2,Wed May 13 19:58:47 2015 UTC,"GOD DAMN IT I JUST PAID.  Whatever, guys deserves it."
baconit,35ua6a,nat_r,3,Wed May 13 21:22:21 2015 UTC,If you paid you won't have ads in it! It was definitely worth the money. Those guys put in a lot of work into that app.
baconit,35ua6a,tattooedjenny,4,Wed May 13 22:34:00 2015 UTC,"It's good there will be more choice once apps are ported over from other OS's.  Hopefully everyone will be able to find one that works for them.  Baconit is pretty stable for me, so I imagine I'll stick with it until something comes along that feels as light and as graphically compact."
baconit,35ua6a,nat_r,1 point,Wed May 13 16:28:21 2015 UTC,almost all imgur links are broken for me. I have to open the link for it to actually work.
baconit,35ua6a,joeyfjj,2,Wed May 13 19:57:22 2015 UTC,Try swiping left then swiping right when you get a 'zoinks!' Imgur error.
baconit,35ua6a,Saotik,1 point,Thu May 14 00:20:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one of the best things about more choices is that a lot of users who for reasons that often seem a mystery just can't reddit using one of the existing apps might have the issue solved."
baconit,35ua6a,KetoSaiba,2,Wed May 13 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"I paid for both Readit and Baconit (via the Early Access app). Baconit is lean, clean, fast, snappy. Readit is more feature-rich, but sometimes feels sluggish.   Also: Baconit is fully-featured and free. Readit is free but will have ads. Not to say that you should not buy either apps, they're both made by great people and deserve it.  Honestly the only reason I switched to Readit is HTTPS support."
baconit,35ua6a,Citko76,1 point,Thu May 14 05:38:20 2015 UTC,"Because readit simply doesn't work for me. I want to like it, but it's literally unusable."
baconit,35ua6a,jwalamukhibavandar,1 point,Thu May 14 09:55:52 2015 UTC,"A problem i've had with baconit for about a month now is that it will not display the text in a self post. I've tried resetting my phone, uninstalling, and unfortunately nothing has fixed it. As a result, I'll probably be switching over once this free release happens. Nokia lumia 822 for anyone who is curious."

baconit,35krqb,MrRektid,1 point,Mon May 11 23:52:36 2015 UTC,For WP 8.1 yeah.  I'm not sure about Android.
baconit,35krqb,MrRektid,1 point,Mon May 11 23:54:29 2015 UTC,Is there a tutorial on how to do this?
baconit,35krqb,windowsphoneguy,1 point,Tue May 12 04:29:47 2015 UTC,If you're not familiar with IFTTT just go to the website @ https://ifttt.com/ and if you're using WP 8.1 d/l Pushalot.  It's pretty straightforward as far as adding existing recipes.  Even creating new ones is pretty easy.  I set up a few for reddit myself.
baconit,35krqb,Type-21,1 point,Tue May 12 13:06:10 2015 UTC,Readit does this

I have no idea what is going on.  It is a popup I added recently due to popularity and people looking to get in contact. Could have made it more 'user friendly' but that is one of those next version things (no longer have a flash compiler to update app). The app should load after clicking OK although I have never tested it on a mobile; Again, flash based."

Not sure what you're talking about, as I'm way tech illiterate compared to you, but why would your flash pop-up app start without someone clicking it? Serious question."
baconit,33moap,GabberMate,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:44:32 2015 UTC,The app starts when navigating to the html page that contains it. The popup is not integrated in the app. It is just a standard JS message.

baconit,33k04e,corex02,8,Thu Apr 23 13:31:28 2015 UTC,well the app IS broken. crashes constantly. and that is the paid version. It's like funding a kickstarter and the devs released an alpha to early founders and then just stopped caring.

baconit,32dzmo,Darathin,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:01:27 2015 UTC,"""Donated"" does not imply he ""made off like a bandit."""
baconit,32dzmo,c4rp3,4,Mon Apr 13 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"It does when there is the understanding that the money would be used for upkeep of the app. But he didn't upkeep it, he just left. That isn't right."
baconit,32dzmo,Darathin,6,Mon Apr 13 14:46:06 2015 UTC,"Where did you get that understanding? This app was provided for free, and the donations seem to be more of a ""thanks"" than ""you owe me updates now"" kind of thing. To put it in perspective, a dev making the equivalent of $60/hr at their day job chooses to work on a donation-based project for only a couple reasons: It interests them and they find it fun, or the project is a secondary source of supplemental income, in which case even a $20 donation might be worth about an hour of their time.  It seems that the former reason is no longer the case for Quinn for whatever reason. However, he stole nothing from you. He gave you an ad-free app for no demanded money. You chose to donate some money because the option was there. Does that make him beholden to you?"
baconit,32dzmo,c4rp3,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:22:56 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way. When the request for donations came up, the reason given was so that he could dedicate more time and resources to upkeeping it. With that in mind, I decided to donate, because I like the app, I thought he did a good job, and I wanted the app to continue to be supported. If I had known that he'd be abandoning the app when I received the donation request, I wouldn't have donated.   But technically, yeah, you're right, he doesn't owe me anything, at least not in the legal sense. In terms of honesty, though, he damn rights owes us something if for no other reason than a bunch of us gave money to upkeep the product, which he isn't doing anymore. If I told you that I'd cut your grass all summer long for, say, a hundred bucks, and you gave me that money, you'd expect me to cut your lawn over the summer, right? And I'm not even asking for him to upkeep it himself, just to give us the chance to do so."
baconit,32dzmo,Darathin,3,Mon Apr 13 21:38:09 2015 UTC,"I'd love to know the actual numbers in terms of dollars donated versus hours spent. If you've fallen out of love with a project or are just busy with your day job, you weigh things differently than if you're in college/don't have other sources of income. When you consider the estimate of $60+/hr for work, $x/hr to do baconit, and $y/hr relative value of taking some time off/doing other stuff, there may very well be good reasons the program isn't getting updated.   That said, I've reached out to him a few times trying to get source access. Even if he's not willing to open source it, he may let another developer at his same company work on it in their own free time. As I stated in another comment, I think I'll swing by his office this week and bring a bottle of wine or beer by. At the least, it'll be my way of saying ""thanks"", but also bugging him again to see if he'll answer affirmatively to my request to get source access so I can help with baconit. IMed him about it just now, we'll see if he responds (or if I'm just going to have to go over there) :)."

Pretty much for me it boils down to him asking for money for something he didn't want to upkeep. That doesn't sit right with me. It was unfair of me to say that he made off like a bandit, because I'm sure that wasn't his intention, but I do stand by the disappointment in his actions.   Regarding the other side there, if you took over, I would be extremely excited!"
baconit,32dzmo,Darathin,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:28:40 2015 UTC,"He made the app while he was in college. Pretty sure the donate stuff was created then, but shrug. I'm glad to see the reasonable change from something like ""out for blood"" to the more reasonable ""very disappointed."" Creating a popular app or working on a big project is often disheartening. As excited as you are about it, the most vocal people are those who are unhappy with you, and when the primary form of feedback you get is negative, comments about your intelligence, skills, work, etc, or even outright statements that bad things should happen to you, it becomes very disheartening. Trust me about that, I worked on Win8 and certainly have taken enough abuse related to last a lifetime. Given the content of /r/baconit (generally misposts or complaints), I could see another dev feeling beleaguered by user demands. Doubly so since Quinn is on the Windows Phone team, so going home to work on a WP app can be like work on top of work.  I'd be excited to do what I can, but he's clearly quite busy based on our brief conversation after I said I was IMing him. At least if I get access, there's a nicely populated backlog on uservoice to check out ;). If and when I have something worth mentioning (beyond the general me contacting him saying ""I'd love to help where I can""), I'll be certain to communicate it in the subreddit."

baconit,2zjder,illQualmOnYourFace,4,Thu Mar 19 02:32:21 2015 UTC,"Menus look much nicer. In responding to this message, I found it under my inbox and was given several options in a more pleasing sequence than the isolated menu you get with baconit. Gifs load consistently and quickly, rather than the weird, zoomed-in, do-you-want-html5-or-GIF buttons-involved thing I always got on baconit. Images always load in full resolution without having to do so manually. Moving between the link and the comments is more smooth, you just take the title card and move it up/down the screen to switch. You never skip links by swiping through links rather than scrolling. Downloaded it 30 minutes ago and I have nothing but things to like. The only problem is YouTube links don't always load properly, but then again, this app has current support from its developer, obviously has no ads to deal with, and there are east ways around that problem with more menu options than are available thru baconit. Come make the switch with me."
baconit,2zjder,illQualmOnYourFace,5,Thu Mar 19 03:00:35 2015 UTC,My friend*...you have successfully sold a Readit download. Congratulations.   *We aren't friends^  Yet

baconit,2zjder,gandalf_alpha,2,Tue Mar 24 01:58:01 2015 UTC,I switched a couple of weeks ago to readit. I love it. I do also sometimes switch between the 2 but readit is better to me. I like that I can change my flair in app. I just like the overall layout better.

But I believe that Baconit takes the pictures from /r/EarthPorn (or some other sub that has nice photos), downloads them as usual (like it downloads them for flip-view in full resolution) and then just sets them as the background picture. Or that I would do it that way."

baconit,2yrlcb,achiever666,2,Thu Mar 12 14:48:13 2015 UTC,The app completely shit the bed after the last big round of reddit server troubles. I had to uninstall and reinstall it. Works fine again. For now.

baconit,2wdv24,ochsenschaedel,2,Thu Feb 19 20:10:06 2015 UTC,"You can just swipe right, then left and it will load correctly.  It's a little better than going to ""open story link"""
baconit,2wdtod,Vision86,2,Thu Feb 19 02:03:47 2015 UTC,Definitely. Haven't heard or seen anything yet.
baconit,2wdtod,IPlayRaunchyMusic,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:25:09 2015 UTC,Just got it for the Lumia 1520
baconit,2w3hkp,Muzical84,2,Mon Feb 16 17:51:49 2015 UTC,I'm still seeing this issue.
baconit,2vy2dk,ZOMAX1,1 point,Sun Feb 15 05:04:34 2015 UTC,"Under the Reddits list go to ""Saved"" then tap on it."
baconit,2vy2dk,killrage,1 point,Sun Feb 15 07:00:19 2015 UTC,"Next to the top category bar, default is ""what's hot"", select it, ""saved"" should be an option."
baconit,2vy2dk,Lord_Fodder,1 point,Sun Feb 15 07:01:22 2015 UTC,What about only upvoted stories?

baconit,2vrw3c,newcoolnow,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:50:40 2015 UTC,This is beautiful. I really fancy whipping up a batch of chobacon now!
baconit,2vrw3c,callumrulz09,2,Fri Feb 13 18:02:45 2015 UTC,This song has inspired my students to make chobacon.  I plan on trying it this weekend.  I'm trying to convince my wife that this is all I need for Valentine's Day:  bacon and cookies.  :)
baconit,2vj70z,Kolsteer,7,Wed Feb 11 13:23:10 2015 UTC,"No one knows but quinn, and we don't get any news from there anymore."
baconit,2vj70z,TheSwarre,6,Wed Feb 11 16:47:04 2015 UTC,"This app is begging for an update. I cannot view most imgur links and in order to refresh the hot page I have to press the button and reboot the app. Please, someone, anyone, update. Please!"
baconit,2vj70z,deadjane,3,Wed Feb 11 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"Sadly,i fear he has given up on this app, or even the WP phone all together. I don't think he has posted for ages"
baconit,2vj70z,cLIntTheBearded,3,Thu Feb 12 08:38:04 2015 UTC,I have no source but I heard Quinn abandoned this app.
baconit,2vj70z,shillsgonnashill,2,Sun Feb 15 07:10:19 2015 UTC,"I gave up on this app. Try Readit instead. Yeah it costs $1.99 but it's such a great app. The interface is beautiful, you can use multi-reddits, and gyfcat works properly in it."
baconit,2vj70z,xjimbojonesx,1 point,Tue Feb 17 19:42:37 2015 UTC,Quinn got a job at Microsoft. He has abandoned the app.
baconit,2vg1q8,daniel_hilburn,8,Tue Feb 10 18:59:22 2015 UTC,Are you guys seriously exepcting that baconit is still in development? I'm pretty sure quinbd has abandoned it...
baconit,2vg1q8,geschtonkenflapped,2,Wed Feb 11 07:49:11 2015 UTC,Second. Please do this.  It is really cbersome when you can't read comments and have to aume what they are saying..  I just don't want random gore or sex images to pop up when I'm browsing in public/work etc
baconit,2vanoa,mahoodie,16,Mon Feb 9 13:02:49 2015 UTC,Are you kidding me baconit...  Posted this in the wrong sub AGAIN
baconit,2vanoa,chem_dog,3,Mon Feb 9 13:08:27 2015 UTC,The country is beautiful. Why shouldn't I be in Somalia?
baconit,2vanoa,chem_dog,5,Mon Feb 9 22:12:33 2015 UTC,Only if your in the wrong places.  Imagine it like the state of Michigan and it has a really big Detroit.
baconit,2vanoa,chem_dog,1 point,Mon Feb 9 22:45:50 2015 UTC,Is Somalia really the undisputed #1 dangerous country? There's a pretty big war going on in Syria right now
baconit,2vanoa,TFresh1499,1 point,Tue Feb 10 02:02:18 2015 UTC,"Jokes aside, Aleppo has been fought over since 2011. So much of the city is now rubble, there are snipers on rooftops killing indiscriminately, helicopters dropping bombs. Obviously Mog has the tribal stuff going on but Syria is a major warzone."
baconit,2vanoa,FiatMortem,1 point,Tue Feb 10 02:14:20 2015 UTC,Do you have a link to this list?
baconit,2vanoa,BrainJar,4,Tue Feb 10 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"That looks delicious!  Wrong sub, though"
baconit,2vanoa,prince_fufu,3,Tue Feb 10 03:53:18 2015 UTC,You know you're not in the USA when all your meat is just whacked with a meat cleaver.
baconit,2vanoa,tall_asian,3,Tue Feb 10 04:24:32 2015 UTC,"You don't even want to know where they catch the majority of the fish that they eat, but since this is Reddit, I'm going to tell you anyway.  The run off from their city sewage goes directly into the ocean.  Less than a mile from there, there used to be a meat packing plant, where they used to dump the unused parts into the ocean...fun fact, don't swim there, because the sharks happen to LOVE that area...anyway, back to the fishing.  The shark infested water drove the fish down the beach to the sewage...and now that's where the fishing is done.  bummer...the food ""looks"" good.  And, if you happen to want a straw with your drink, check for bite marks, it's probably recycled.  Source: Was there in '93 and '94."
baconit,2vanoa,mickydonavan417,3,Tue Feb 10 06:45:47 2015 UTC,So its changed since then. The fishing is done where dozens of countries illegally dump their toxic waste now.
baconit,2vbcm4,pajamabot,4,Mon Feb 9 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"Most people on there were actually pretty nice to you,  I just went and checked.    Don't take it personally.  I get pms all the time that I'm dumb for getting pregnant whenever I venture out of my pregnancy subreddit,  it's just the nature of the beast.    To be fair,  I also use my phone for reddit (not baconit anymore ) and it never asks me if I am female.    However,  that sub is kind of a sanctuary for moms who want to bitch anonymously on the Internet. The whole ""no men"" thing isn't because they're sexist nazis, it's because of what has happened when men infiltrate that sub.  Every post gets down voted,  lots of comments about how everyone is evil and trolls posting frequently,  ect.  The posters get a lot of flack for being ""evil shewitches who should be had abortions"" but there is also a sub for dad's,  too,  that is the same thing.  It's better to anonymously bitch to a screen than to take it out on your family,  sometimes.    Like I said,  don't take it personally.  It was an honest mistake, but it's also okay to not want men on a subreddit for moms who need to bitch about life,  yknow? Maybe check out the dad version of that sub, if you're interested. But you're dealing with a lot of frustrated ladies at brmom."
baconit,2vbcm4,wake_and_vape,1 point,Mon Feb 9 22:07:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right I shouldn't take it personally. I think the thing that got to me was just that they accused me of lying."
baconit,2vbcm4,13inchmushroommaker,6,Mon Feb 9 22:59:19 2015 UTC,I got banned from r/bras because I asked for photos for clarification. They thought I was being a perv. Go fig
baconit,2vbcm4,bemidjifisher,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:26:45 2015 UTC,Does it ask if you have a vagina and rage?
baconit,2ud9sg,richardboucher,11,Sun Feb 1 02:29:09 2015 UTC,"I was a long time Baconit user from the WP7 days. I finally bailed on it 4 days ago to give the readit beta a shot. It is amazing. I'm still getting adjusted to a few things, but the stability of it is a game changer. It offers flair display, proper vote visibility, in-app gfycat support, allows loading of all comments at different tree levels  Baconit was never saving my high resolution setting, lagged and crashed many times daily, never adopted the new voting system that reddit implemented months ago, gives up loading comments after you scroll far enough.  Do not buy it. Developer has been afk for a long time. Last time he was around, he started offering an early access version that he charged money for. He was active for about a month and then dropped off the grid again."
baconit,2ud9sg,PeterFnet,2,Sun Feb 1 11:52:39 2015 UTC,Have they fixed the font? The only reason I'm not buying readit is that ugly font.
baconit,2ud9sg,RXT00,1 point,Sat Feb 14 09:39:44 2015 UTC,"Unsure about those schedules. What's differs, with tbr font?"
baconit,2ud9sg,PeterFnet,4,Sat Feb 14 10:08:41 2015 UTC,Love it. Crashes every once in a while.
baconit,2ud9sg,imnohero22,2,Sun Feb 1 08:24:59 2015 UTC,"For me (Lumia 920), it's actually a bit slower than the regular app."
baconit,2ud9sg,OsmanW,1 point,Sun Feb 1 10:51:49 2015 UTC,"I use it all the time but I don't like it. The UI and workflow is just too goofy.  I like that it has a dark theme, but that's about it."
baconit,2ud9sg,robaxx,1 point,Sun Feb 1 13:48:23 2015 UTC,"I use the regular Baconit and I like it fine. I wish the developer would reappear though, as he could make it better. I emailed him a few days ago but I think he's out of the game just now."
baconit,2ud9sg,Citko76,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:42:11 2015 UTC,Videos run weird
baconit,2ud9sg,idma,2,Sat Feb 14 16:53:22 2015 UTC,"I've been using it for quite a while, it rarely crashes for me. A lot of people are haven't issues with it but I honestly think this is the better reddit app for windows phone. I love it!"
baconit,2ud9sg,odog_,0,Sun Feb 1 06:12:40 2015 UTC,"much better than the free app. after i bought it it hasnt crashed once, while the regular crashed 5-6 times / h when using it in school"
baconit,2u6zkk,BreakingFuse,8,Fri Jan 30 13:12:34 2015 UTC,"Dude, I always thought that they were the same thing. I never knew why my phone was always telling me that Baconit was running in the background."
baconit,2u6zkk,Smooovies,3,Fri Jan 30 14:18:48 2015 UTC,I never knew why my phone was always telling me that Baconit was running in the background.    We used to answer that question all the damn time.
