There is a cover version still on YouTube, which is essentially the same as listening to the original track because neither are Als voice. And I can confirm they are the exact same lyrics"

weirdal,3cdoq9,opiesgirl1994,4,Tue Jul 7 03:28:24 2015 UTC,I often like Weird Al's parody better than the original version.  For example Word Crimes I can listen to all day but never Blurred Lines.

weirdal,3cdoq9,AnghellicKarma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"I always go and listen to the song Al parodied so I can understand some of his subtle humor.  For example, in ""Perform This Way"", Al sings ""I'll wear a porcupine on my head on a W-H-I-M"".  Early in ""Born This Way"", Lady Gaga says, ""It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M""."

But, using my process of individualizing each song and thinking of if I would skip that ONE song as it came up randomly in my music player rather than thinking of the album as a whole, that's how it ended up."
weirdal,3c6wp1,captainp42,4,Sun Jul 5 14:15:47 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.   Everyone has their own reasoning.   Maybe later, I will come back on here with my own list...but D2BS is strong contender for #1."
weirdal,3c6wp1,Chlemtil,5,Sun Jul 5 14:18:31 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, the song ""Dare to be Stupid"" is my favorite Al song ever :)"
weirdal,3c6wp1,zutroy,3,Sun Jul 5 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting list. Al is pretty timeless and appeals to folks of all ages... I wonder how much age (which parodies are to songs you like/know) and ""first album"" matter.  For example, as a 32-year-old I would put Alapalooza toward the top of my list, but a lot of that is because how much I loved Jurassic park when it first came out and because I think Living on the Edge (and therefore Living in the Fridge) is such an amazing song."
weirdal,3c6wp1,zutroy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"I remember when ""Eat It"" came out. In 3-D was my introduction to Al and it wasn't until probably ""Dare To Be Stupid"" that I also got/listened to ""Weird Al Yankovic"". So, I've been a fan for a LONG time, pretty much since the beginning.   Nostalgia defiinitely plays a big part in my (or anybody's) list. It was interesting going through and deciding which are the skippable songs as most of them were the parodies. Very few original songs I consider skippable. And I also tried to consider if I thought the song was skippable because I just don't like the song or because I've heard it so many times over the years.   It was an interesting little project that killed a bit of time at work this morning :)"

weirdal,3c6wp1,minnick27,3,Sun Jul 5 13:24:38 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to Al since pretty much the beginning. ""Eat It"" and ""In 3-D"" was my first introduction to him. ""Even Worse"" was the first album I ever bought with my own money. I definitely hold those two albums, along with ""Dare to be Stupid"", in high regards and full of nostalgia. But since the day it came out, I've always considered ""Running With Scissors"" to be his best top to bottom album with zero skippable songs (possibly Grapefruit Diet, depending on how I'm feeling that day)"
weirdal,3c6wp1,spaghetti_hitchens,2,Sun Jul 5 13:58:10 2015 UTC,I think Running With Scissors was my first Al CD. I'd put it #2 for me.

The entire thing is planned out and pre-scripted. What I saw in the videos taken early in the tour were pretty much what I saw a couple of weeks ago...just at a different venue."

weirdal,3bal8e,JQuick,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:59:50 2015 UTC,"A fan at a VIP Meet & Greet asked him about the origins of the Yoda Chant. Time was short so Al couldn't elaborate, but essentially it was influenced by some tribal chants he'd heard. He couldn't recall when he started doing it, but said he was going to get the info together and put it on his site.  I wanted to point out that a section of it is directly taken from Spike Jones' ""Hawaiian War Chant"" but figured I'd let it go - the fan was having a moment with Al and I didn't want to do anything to ruin it.  EDIT: Of course I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that he uses the Grim Grinning Ghosts from the Haunted Mansion, the Man Show beer chant, Dinosaur Jr's Walk The Dinosaur, and Frère Jacques lyrics (among many other small bits like a Jerry Lewis ""Hey LADY!"" quote).  Wikipedia says he started doing it in 1991."

Plus it was pouring rain that night so I doubt they would have been out that late in the storm. But I've seen Amish Paradise performed in at least 20 cities, and the biggest reaction I've ever seen to any song ever is AP in Lancaster. It's truly magical"
weirdal,3apa9t,thezapzupnz,10,Mon Jun 22 11:55:35 2015 UTC,"He has mentioned before that he's not a fan of his early singing voice before he really learned to sing/control his voice and how nasally it was. In most of the songs you mentioned, they are parodies or style parodies, in which case he does usually try to take on the closer singing voice of the artist he's parodying, such as Dog Eat Dog as you mentioned. I'd say the other songs mentioned - Midnight Star, Melanie, Ball of Twine - are more of his natural singing voice at the time rather than him putting on any sort of ""voice"". One great thing about Al's career and having been around for so long is that we can really track his progress as a singer, writer, and producer over the course of his 12 Al-bums and 30+ years and see just how far he's really come. I can barely listen to Girls Just Want To Have Lunch anymore because his singing in that is honestly quite grating. But then you listen to something like Pancreas where he does several layers of vocal harmonies with himself and realize how great of a singer he really is."
weirdal,3apa9t,OoklaIsMyHomeboy,4,Mon Jun 22 12:12:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, now that first bit (about him mentioning how nasally his voice sounded) is interesting, I hadn't heard about that.  Though, about his style parodies, it seems (to me, at least) that he doesn't so much go for the voices anymore. That can be seen as a good thing, because it makes it a mixture of what's great about modern Al plus the technical wizardry of his band ... but I do miss the voices.  Oh, and you're right, Girls Just Want To Have Lunch is a song best forgotten about... though even that voice is ... a voice. Reminds me of how he sang My Bologna.  What sparked me thinking about this, if you're interested, is that I can't imagine Al being physically able to sing UHF anymore. Not like on the album, anyway."
weirdal,3apa9t,minnick27,6,Mon Jun 22 12:29:14 2015 UTC,Girls is a big exception though. He was forced to record a Cyndi Lauper parody because they were on the same label. I believe at one point he said that if he were to do it again he would sing in a normal voice
weirdal,3apa9t,knightguy04,11,Mon Jun 22 12:47:16 2015 UTC,"The other evolution, I think, is the reduction of the fart noises during the musical parts of the parodies.  Even Worse is full of them, as if he knew he had to try hard to distinguish his song from the original.  But then you listen to the newer stuff and it's played straight just like (or better) than the originals."
weirdal,3apa9t,esjay,3,Mon Jun 22 12:39:14 2015 UTC,"Regarding the absence of manualism in newer songs, I thought Mike Kieffer just got out of the music business."
weirdal,3apa9t,minnick27,6,Tue Jun 23 03:17:56 2015 UTC,He has mentioned that he took singing lessons with Lisa Popeil after the second album. He also started to take the presentation more serious than before which lead to the accordion only being used on originals and not using Mike Kieffer anymore.
weirdal,3apa9t,ZachsMind,3,Mon Jun 22 12:44:42 2015 UTC,"From a comedic perspective, in his youth he was intentionally trying really hard to sell the comedy of the song, but as he's progressed more as an artist both comedically and musically, he's learned to let the material sell itself. He doesn't try to force the gag as much anymore, trusting that the audience will get it.   And it's also just sheer experience. The more you do something, the better you get at it, and he's had a grand run with no end in sight. I like that he's found his voice, in more ways than one. I've watched and listened to this guy since the Doctor Demento days with My Bologna and I Love Rocky Road. To go from there to Tacky and Word Crimes it's just a joy as an audience member to see him grow like a beautiful fungus into an amazing fungi."
weirdal,3apa9t,esjay,3,Tue Jun 23 02:47:30 2015 UTC,I think about this from time to time. King of Suede and Hey Ricky are other examples that comes to mind.
