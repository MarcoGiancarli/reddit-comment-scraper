Help me doctor, I've got For the watch in my butt!  Hi, this is Jim from accounting. We noticed a $1,200 charge labeled ""For the watch."" Can you explain?  2 AM in the city that never sleeps. The door swings open and she walks in, legs up to here. Something in her eyes tells me she's looking for For the watch.  For the watch It's a trap!  This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with For the watch.  In his new action comedy, Jackie Chan must fend off ninjas while also dealing with For the watch.  Everybody join hands and close your eyes. Do you sense that? That's the presence of For the watch in this room.  Life for American Indians was forever changed when the White Man introduced them to For the watch.  For the watch That's how I want to die."

I'm up all night for A costly mistake.  In his new self-produced album, Kanye West raps over the sounds of A costly mistake.  My grandfather worked his way up from nothing. When he came to this country, all he had was the shoes on his feet and A costly mistake.  The six things I could never do without: oxygen, facebook, chocolate, netflix, friends, and A costly mistake LOL!  A successful job interview begins with a firm handshake and ends with A costly mistake.  Honey, Mommy and Daddy love you very much. But apparently Mommy loves A costly mistake more than she loves Daddy.  Next time on Dr. Phil: How to talk to your child about A costly mistake.  Now in bookstores: ""The Audacity of A costly mistake."" by Barack Obama.  I'm pretty sure I'm high right now, because I""m absolutely mesmerized by A costly mistake."
