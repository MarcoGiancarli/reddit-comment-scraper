badparking,3acfax,FatherStorm,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:20:48 2015 UTC,In a perfect world...   ... you backed in... and have a bullbar...  with spikes...
badparking,3ab8gz,tynamite,6,Thu Jun 18 18:15:11 2015 UTC,Only people with kinda shit cars can do this. Or if you simply don't care if they key your car.
badparking,3ab8gz,Enroberman,2,Thu Jun 18 18:39:36 2015 UTC,One of the benefits of driving a beater.  Wish I could call that a beater. Does look too bad.

badparking,3afvii,amdewstow,6,Fri Jun 19 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"Considering that each truck is longer and wider than a single space they could have taken 4 each, for a total of 12"
badparking,3abmwa,woja111,2,Thu Jun 18 19:59:23 2015 UTC,so are you

badparking,3abmwa,malv0,2,Sat Jun 20 00:28:40 2015 UTC,"It's from Victoria, Australia.  Unfortunately this person can still get into the drivers seat easily."
badparking,3abmwa,Becksta21,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:36:13 2015 UTC,I like sitting in my car and drinking a coffee while waiting for them to come back. I'm not moving anytime soon.

Kinda thought I used it in wrong context.  But yes guy in picture, total asshat."
badparking,3a36x2,Bigingreen,2,Wed Jun 17 13:42:32 2015 UTC,The downforce made him do it.

badparking,3a36x2,RayLomas,0,Wed Jun 17 17:23:22 2015 UTC,"Well... the parking job is far from perfect, but considering that the whole lot looks quite empty, and other spots next to him seem reasonably useable, I'd say it's passable."
badparking,3a36x2,CheckYourLights,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:29:52 2015 UTC,Why would the adjacent space or location give the driver a free pass to park like a jerk?
badparking,3a2dfw,BILLD0E,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:10:55 2015 UTC,Can you explain what's happening? Is that a pull-through they parked in? Or shitty parking spot parking? Hard to tell in this photo.
badparking,3a2dfw,JustCallMeEro,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:42:35 2015 UTC,It's a traffic circle in front of an office building the lady decided to park in the middle of the circle facing the wrong direction.

badparking,39wmpx,ashowofhands,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:15:40 2015 UTC,"Ooh, even better!  We never got a WRX version of the 1st-gen in the US, and with the 25 year import law they're still too new to import, so I often forget that such a thing existed.  Given that there's still a clear abundance of full-sized pickups, I'm guessing this must be in Canada?"
badparking,39wmpx,MmmmPingas,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:21:01 2015 UTC,Yes sir! :)
badparking,39wmpx,Mastercb419,-2,Tue Jun 16 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't condone parking incorrectly due to laziness, but those handicap spots look massive and how far back the curb goes, I don't think he's necessarily in anybody's way..."
badparking,39wmpx,somecrazybroad,5,Mon Jun 15 20:25:57 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make room an excuse for laziness, you can see in the picture where everyone else has to park, he doesn't deserve to park right out front. He's no better than all of us."

badparking,39u4ml,wheresmychippy93,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:19:15 2015 UTC,She porbably didn't manage to pull out.
badparking,39u4ml,MayhemCha0s,2,Mon Jun 22 21:24:08 2015 UTC,yeah you're right. looked like they're had to have been a little paint swap on the back fenders right? risky
