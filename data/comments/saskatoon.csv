saskatoon,3e5ali,SlyPlatypus,5,Wed Jul 22 01:50:10 2015 UTC,"Good, we don't have ball or rogers for internet.  Your choices are Sasktel or Shaw.  Sasktel has no limit cap, FibreOptic Network, and decent price if you bundle with other services. Shaw has a limit cap, but pricing is pretty much the same.  For internet it doesn't honestly matter much, unless you are moving into a Infinet area, then go with Sasktel and that. Otherwise flip a coin."
saskatoon,3e5ali,Karbinger,3,Wed Jul 22 02:02:39 2015 UTC,"Jump.ca won't get you a better price than SaskTel, their prices are ""as low as"" which means you get a small discount if you have other SaskTel services. Shaw's pricing is similarly deceptive, they advertise the 6-month promotional pricing that typically doubles after the promo period. They get you in the door with the idea of cancelling after 6 months but nobody ever does.  VMedia looks interesting: their cable plans advertise no data caps, I don't understand how they can offer that if they're just re-selling Shaw. I tried to order Cable 60 and it made me bundle VoIP phone service, as well as phone equipment that I'll never use. Also note that you're on the hook for cable modem rental/purchase, as well as an install fee, neither of which Shaw make you do. All in all it looks like VMedia is trying to drum up support for their VoIP products by forcing you to bundle it with their cheap internet plans."

When you buy any bike from them they keep records of everything including serial number for their tune up policy. Go talk to Jeff or Von and explain to them what happened and they should be able to provide you with all the information you need and can probably reproduce a receipt if you don't have yours.

saskatoon,3e1fjc,AssistingJarl,14,Tue Jul 21 05:36:29 2015 UTC,"I biked to work in the summer for years.  I only had a couple issues with vehicles but nothing major.  1) Take up your whole lane.  Riding against the sidewalk or parked cars is ridiculously dangerous as vehicles try to squeeze by you.  Pick streets where it's safer.  Don't ride down 8th street, ride down 7th etc.  2) DO NOT sneak up the side of all the cars at a red light right to the front of the line and then ride down the side of the street and make them all pass you AGAIN after it's green.  You seriously deserve to get squeezed off the road if you do this.  Total dick move.    3) Cross walks are for pedestrians.  You want to take your bike over it, get off and walk across.    If you ride really slow and want to ride on the sidewalk I have no issues with that as a pedestrian as long as you understand that the sidewalk is not where you belong, so it's your job to get out of the way of all/any pedestrians.  It's not a pedestrians job to make room for you on the sidewalk.  The biggest issue I had with cars was people passing me and then immediately pulling in front of me and hammering the brakes to turn right because staying behind me for that extra 2 seconds before their turn would have just been unbearable...  As for getting rear-ended, hit, etc, that sucks, but it happens when you're driving a car too...  People that aren't paying attention will run in to anything."
saskatoon,3e1fjc,mdchris,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:05 2015 UTC,"I think the going advice is to take the lane only when there is some obstruction, like a massive series of potholes or loose gravel, or when the street is too narrow to allow parallel traffic. Some of those are actually signmarked, but since putting up signs on every narrow street is obviously impractical I really think what we need is some kind of awareness campaign."
saskatoon,3e1fjc,psailing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"Sadly, your first point about taking the lane is illegal. The current bylaw require cyclists to hug the shoulder as much as possible. This needs to be changed. Like you, I also try and take the lane otherwise cars try and lane split with me to pass. Nothing worse than legally riding your bike and be passed by a 60kmph vehicle that is literally inches away from you.  I agree with the sidewalk thing as well, but use common sense. Sidewalks downtown and Broadway are generally full of people. Just don't bike on them. It's annoying as a pedestrian. Sure, if you feel comfortable using the sidewalk in Varsity View, you're probably bothering very few people, but downtown is much different. Also, people should be aware that you're statistically likelier to be hit by a car on the sidewalk vs the road. Cars aren't watching or expecting fast moving objects on sidewalks. On the road, you should be visible and motorists should be paying attention."
saskatoon,3e1fjc,mdchris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that's true regarding being illegal to take up a lane, but honestly too lazy to find more proof than this quote from the OP link ""Bicycles must travel in the same manner as motorists and obey the same rules of the road as motorists.""  Motorists take up the lane, so I travel like them and take up the lane.  I drive my bicycle following the same rules/guidelines as if I was on a motorcycle regarding lane blocking.  Holding up traffic isn't good either, you need to pick your streets, and move at a good clip, pull over to let vehicles by when it makes sense etc."

Don't do me any favors, follow the rules of the road and we'll all be fine.  Sadly many cyclists don't follow the rules themselves which can result in anarchy. Especially those that seem to think its okay to ride down the wrong side of the street with all disregard for everybody. They are what give cyclists a bad rap."

That all lasted until I was going along properly and completely legally in my lane and a car just ran into me.  I missed having my head driven over by another car by inches and spent a whole summer recovering.  The only excuse from the driver who nearly killed me?  ""He should've been on the sidewalk.""  And I learned I can obey the laws in Saskatoon and be 100% in the right when they explain to the car driver why he was wrong when he killed me.... Or I can break the law, drive on the sidewalk and be alive.  Yes, occasionally cyclists scowl at me, but as long as the drivers in Saskatoon are morons, I'm not sharing the road with them."

He was completely in the wrong and he just paid a fine of a couple hundred bucks.  He didn't even get his license suspended.

I don't know what I said that provoked you to do so.   I understood your comment just fine. I'll ask you again, more specifically this time, do you really think that people would drive in the same manner as they do today if there were no licenses and plates?   In other words, licensing (to ensure there is a baseline skill level) and plating (to make vehicles identifiable to police) does nothing to ensure that drivers are less asshole-ish?"
saskatoon,3e1fjc,bosphotos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, no need for personal attacks.  As for licensing and plating, I disagree that it would lead to more lawful riding. Of course, that is just my opinion and I have no data to confirm that so it is completely subjective, but I don't think it solves the problem.  Licensing forces people to know the law, but I disagree that understanding of the law is the problem in the first place. Almost everyone knows it's illegal to bike on the sidewalk. In terms of baseline skill, most children have a fully functioning understanding of how to operate a bike.  As for plating, I don't think identifying unlawful cyclists is necessarily a major concern.   A greater police presence in terms of ticketing may help with the problem and, as a cyclist, I'm not necessarily against it. I don't think either a license or 'plates' are required for police to hand a ticket to a cyclist for riding on the sidewalk or wildly weaving in and out of traffic.  To me, greater education through different means is the correct answer, combined with perhaps greater police presence in the forms of warnings or tickets."

I was just lamenting that you were arguing on such a simplistic level that the fact that licenses can be good for some things, but not the thing you were saying was too complex for you to understand.  I prefer to discuss things on a higher level, and I was just sad that you couldn't do so... That's all.  And I already answered your question... If you think that plates have insured no car drivers are assholes?  Because that's the statement you're making, simplistically implying that plates will cure biking issues.  No offense... But your insistence that plates are the answer... Such as simple answer to a complex problem... Implies you are just a little simple.  Because plates on bikes have been done in lots of places.

saskatoon,3e1fjc,psailing,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"That's a really shallow answer, can I ask why you don't think that's a good idea? If people need to take a paper test to learn the rules of the road to drive a car on the road, why don't people need to take a paper exam to get a license to ride a bike on the road and a plate to quickly and easily visually prove that you've got that license?    Cyclists and motorists are expected to know and follow the exact same rules but one group is taught and tested the other group is not.  If safety and having people follow the rules were really a concern, cost of implementing an additional license letter and making plates shouldn't be that big of a problem.  I'm willing to bet, if you want people to really follow the rules, a good place to start is teaching them the rules. I don't see hardcore bikers on sidewalks, it's the fair-weather riders that are out for their first time or a leisurely ride on their cruiser that are on the sidewalks.   I'd hazard a guess that people like me that bike commute everyday tend to follow the rules more often than new riders. Of course i'm not saying daily commuters are perfect, far from it but a plate would discourage those who are in a ""rush"" from running 4-way stops and magically turning into pedestrians at crosswalks since it's no longer anonymous."
saskatoon,3e1fjc,geebs,7,Tue Jul 21 15:29:13 2015 UTC,Well the fact that I'm not going to kill people on my 19lb bike vs a 18yr old new driver in his dad's 5000lb Dodge 1500 truck. If you run 4 ways that are full of stopped vehicles then you will get hurt. I get that a driver shouldn't be responsible to pay for damages you cause while on your bike but get the police involved if that happens just like any other vehicle accident and make them pay for your new hood out of pocket.
saskatoon,3e1fjc,psailing,4,Tue Jul 21 15:38:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's pretty much like requiring a license for pedestrians. So many of them j-walk, cross when it's unsafe, jog on the road, etc. so why not force them to obtain a license and plate their asses? Because it's a stupid reactionary idea."
saskatoon,3e1fjc,geebs,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's reactionary...  I don't know what about what I said would make you think that.   I genuinely think that a lot of people who ride on sidewalks, or cut into crosswalks to magically turn into pedestrians don't know they're breaking the law. Whereas people who are j-walking, jogging on the road, or plain walking down the middle of 22nd ave just don't care. You won't ever solve that problem without super strict policing. Those things really aren't alike at all, if pedestrians were expected to walk like a car down the street and follow all the rules of the road, then yes, I would advocate for licensing pedestrians!   I think a problem we can solve is education of the rules, and that by itself would go a long way towards getting people to ride safer. So how would you make sure everyone who is riding on the road knows the rules?   licensing and tagging bikes with an identifier is my idea...  what's yours?"
saskatoon,3e1fjc,psailing,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"I consider it reactionary because licensing doesn't solve anything, as detailed by /u/bosphotos above.   If education is the issue, then focus on that. I know for a fact that drivers education speaks about cycling laws (and has for quite sometime). Similarly, police were going to my elementary school back in the 90s speaking about cycling laws and hand signaling. We spend money on advertising for things like zipper merging, speed limits, drunk driving, etc. so we could extend that to cycling education. Perhaps we need more of all the above?  Also, all sidewalks downtown have a ""Walk your bike"" symbol at the corners. I think 99% of people are aware they're breaking the law, but choose to do so anyways....which brings me to the point that it's not education thats necessarily the problem, it's safety. I think the majority of cyclists who ride on sidewalks have been made aware that it's illegal, but continue to do so for their own safety. In that regard, I think providing safe cycling infrastructure is probably the best option to prevent sidewalk cycling."
saskatoon,3e1fjc,geebs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:13:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right, and we just need a shit-ton more advertizing. The one thing that has been effectively lowered by education and advertising campaigns is drunk driving. (On the other hand, I don't think people are even aware that zipper merging and using both lanes until it's necessary to merge is proper in construction zones... and everyone speeds...).  I definitely agree that better infrastructure is probably the best option; however, I don't think realistic to have 100% coverage.   still, if knowing the rules is so damn important to everyone's safety, why not have licensing for riding a bike on the road. Literally every other mode of transportation that uses the roads requires licensing."
saskatoon,3e1fjc,photogjs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:59:26 2015 UTC,"It takes a skill to operate a car and/or motorcycle that you must obtain a license to show you have obtained. Furthermore, car accidents are costly to repair and dangerous which require insurance. That explains the license and plates.  For bikes, most children can operate it so I don't think a license is required to show SGI how you can drive a bike. Insurance isn't really required either as bike accidents are not so expensive. You don't see bikes veering into people's garages and houses or destroying thousands of dollars of property."
saskatoon,3e1fjc,BleauMe,2,Tue Jul 21 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"So, are you saying that it's not as important for a cyclist to follow the rules of the road compared to a driver because they're less likely to cause injury?  But I thought that this whole thread was about how it IS important for cyclists to follow the rules of the road so that THEY don't get hurt by cars when a cyclist breaks the rule of the road.   If it is important that cyclists follow the rules of the road then maybe we should ensure that they understand the rules of the road by making them take a course and write a test. We could use a plate or tag as a quick way for police to see if a cyclist has done that so they can enforce it.   I realise after reading your comment that I needed to make the distinction that i'm not saying people need insurance...  i'm saying they need a little taggy on their bike showing that they took some course or online test about the rules of the road.    Sorry, I lived in Alberta the majority of my life where plates are seperate from insurance."

See, what you don't get is that an asshole in a vehicle can kill people.  Whereas an asshole on a cycle can get themselves killed.  So that's why you first need to get drivers to not be assholes before you worry about anyone on a bike."
saskatoon,3e1fjc,robstoon,7,Tue Jul 21 16:05:54 2015 UTC,"I think we just need to stop this car vs cycle attitude. We're going through a movement right now where cycling has increased dramatically over the years and there is some tension, but nothing that needs to be adversarial.  The problem is that, unlike sidewalks for pedestrians, our roads werent designed to accommodate cycling. They're in no-mans land - not fit for either the road or the sidewalk. Until we start getting separated infrastructure that you see in many other major cities and particularly Europe, there's going to be a problem. But it doesn't have to be hatred.  As a cyclist, I drive a car as well and understand the need to be able to move throughout the city. I understand biking isnt for everyone and we need to respect vehicles. With that said, I more than understand the benefits of cycling, including that cycling is one less car on the road for other motorists to have less congestion. We're one less parking space being used downtown for you to find. We're saving public money on health care by exercising. Our bikes are much less taxing on our roads than large, heavy vehicles.   It may sound douche-hippy-like, but we need to stop the car vs bike attitude and just allow for both parties to move around the city safely and easily."
saskatoon,3e1fjc,Skyline969,4,Tue Jul 21 17:45:19 2015 UTC,There's gonna be some major investment in separated bike facilities in the next couple of years. 23rd Street this year. 4th Avenue next. The university wants to do Cumberland. The City is looking at 19th in Riversdale and more downtown. By 2020 we could very well have an extra 10 km of dedicated bike lanes in the core.

saskatoon,3dzzam,tonyarkles,20,Mon Jul 20 23:07:43 2015 UTC,Everyone merges better in a two lane drive thru than on a public road.
saskatoon,3dzzam,Titanium_Ty,2,Mon Jul 20 23:13:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, tonyarkles. This is a great place to start, people.   If you get anxious about merging, you should watch videos on youtube, watch/ride along with a confident friend who can show you how to do it, and/or, drive around a heavy merging zone and do it 3-4x for practice until you feel confident yourself. It really is easy. Please take the time to learn this."
saskatoon,3dzzam,Benniwannamarijuana,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:16 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced that driving anxiety produces sub-optimal traffic patterns. For example, when turning left from Warman Rd. onto Circle Dr. northbound, there are 2 left turning lanes. The queue for the leftmost lane is typically twice as long as the one beside it. Many people choose the perceived safety of the leftmost lane, because then they don't have to negotiate a merge when the lane ends, they can stay in it all the way until Preston/Attridge. Whereas if you take the rightmost turning lane, you have to watch out for idiots who blow the Yield sign turning from Warman northbound, and have to negotiate a merge before the bridge.  Similar to how some drivers leave a huge buffer, two or three carlengths empty in front of them when they're stopped in traffic. They're convinced they'll be able to dart forward to avert disaster if someone's coming in hot behind them, which is ridiculous: having your foot off the brake when someone is split seconds away from plowing into your rear is one of the dumbest things you can do. But some remnant of driving-PTSD convinces them they're safer. My rule of thumb is to leave enough space in front of your car that you can safely maneuver around the car in front of you if it breaks down.  My last example: The left lane of College when leaving the city to the east. There are 2 classes of drivers: drivers going to Willowgrove/Erindale who need to turn left (class A), and people leaving the city for parts unknown (class B), who will either continue on Highway 5 or hit the 41. Class A sees no need to speed: he's going to be stuck at that red light at McOrmand for a few minutes unless he times it perfectly. But driving 100 in the right lane means there will be a constant stream of out-of-towner Class B's blowing by him in the left lane, making negotiation into the left turning lanes to McOrmand dicey. He might actually have to Pay Attention instead of driving on Auto-pilot. Safer for him (in his eyes) to just stay in the left lane for that last kilometer and pay no mind to the out of towners blowing by him in the right lane.  It's all about the auto-pilot. Shitty drivers will take a longer route with 3 rights rather than the direct route with 1 left. I have a certain amount of sympathy: there is less that can go wrong. But all these hyper-defensive driving maneuvers make traffic worse and driving more unpredictable."
saskatoon,3dzzam,bzealer,2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"If you (not you in particular) have a true case of driving PTSD, then please please PLEASE go seek councilling and safe driving courses. I firmly believe that the general public is far better off without white-knuckle drivers fearing every time they meet traffic that something bad might happen. In most cases, they might, and honestly I would not be surprised to find them at fault. I mean no offense, but if you are afraid to be on the road, then why the hell are you? Councilling and safe driving courses are great ways of boosting confidence. Confidence being the first major point I made in my previous post.  As to the hyper-defensive driving patterns you mentioned...I'm really not sure which you are referring to. The wiki-how link? Or the practice merging suggestion? If anything, I would be far more concerned about PTSD drivers hyper-defensive driving patterns than anything I had mentioned. Those people should honestly just stay off the road for everyones sake."

saskatoon,3dzzam,snoop37,4,Tue Jul 21 15:17:39 2015 UTC,That's because idiots in this city think its acceptable to get into the turning lane as soon as they arrive at it. With no signal lights. Circle Drive going South turning right onto Clancy Drive is the worst for this. People facing North will turn left directly into the right lane because they need to turn right onto Fairmont Drive.

On the other hand you really seem to misunderstand how police radar cars. In this case, one police officer would stand in the 40 km/h construction zone with a laser gun, probably dressed as a construction worker with a vest and hat. Then he'd radio to his colleagues on the other side of the overpass, who would motion speeders to pull over where it's safe. Easy.   My complaint is that they used a very similar technique on a road that quickly turns into a highway as it leaves the city. I doubt there's been a single accident a under the McKercher overpass because somebody is driving 100+ km/h, meanwhile actual road workers are complaining about their safety a few km away."

saskatoon,3dzzam,skilless,21,Tue Jul 21 05:39:39 2015 UTC,I have noticed this problem in Saskatoon and have come up with something I believe would help. If ALL construction signs were removed/covered when nobody is on site then people would (hopefully) be more likely to care and slow down.   I think having the signs present at all times is problematic because people aren't sure whether workers are present so they are less likely to slow down when they see the signs.

It can be abnormal re-routing, narrow lanes, sharp drop-offs, etc.  I do believe they need to be better at tarping the signs when no personnel AND no danger exists."

saskatoon,3dzzam,skilless,3,Tue Jul 21 03:55:09 2015 UTC,"It may not be enforced, but this is the rule. Call the city if you see them uncovered. Some contractors are very lax about them.

saskatoon,3dzzam,blazedwang,3,Tue Jul 21 05:21:36 2015 UTC,Except they can remain up if there is still an unsafe condition present that would warrant going 60km instead of 90km.

saskatoon,3dzzam,Bullshit_To_Go,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:20 2015 UTC,"Yeeeup.  Plus it is hard to tell whether anybody is actually working until you make it to the top of the overpass.  Additionally, it is equally frustrating when driving between Clarence and Preston and everybody slows down to 80 for the fake speed camera, which during rush hour is like 60.  You just get going again and voila, construction.  OPs point is definitely valid, just very frustrating as a driver.  Suggestion to OP: get the cops to enforce it!"
saskatoon,3dzzam,circuittr33,0,Tue Jul 21 01:11:25 2015 UTC,"If OP really does work there: seriously, take the time to cover speed signs when no one is working so that drivers take them seriously when they're out."

They don't have to cover or remove the signs if there is still any present reason as to why people should be going 40-60 as opposed to 90.   Like the fact that in this particular area, it's a winding ass corner."
saskatoon,3dzzam,RubeusShagrid,2,Tue Jul 21 05:25:56 2015 UTC,"In this case, the corner could just be too sharp for higher speeds.  In general, construction signs should be covered when no one is working. A tangent to this discussion, perhaps."
saskatoon,3dzzam,skilless,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:37:51 2015 UTC,"If it's the same as it was the last time I was over that way, I'd definitely say it's too much of a winding corner to take going the regular speed limit there for sure.   But in general, yeah, if there's no danger to resume going the speed limit when workers aren't there, the signs should be covered.   Highway 7 out to vanscoy has been super good about that while they've been redoing the highway.   If the road is still torn up, signs are still up even if there are no workers.   If the road is paved, and no workers, signs are covered every time."

saskatoon,3dzzam,bobnojio,22,Mon Jul 20 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"I used to work road construction in the summer and couldn't disagree more.  Cars ride so much better than they used to. They handle great and the suspension has improved so much that 40km/h doesn't seem that fast, but when you're standing there working and a vehicle passes you at 40 within a couple feet of you, it's quicker than you think.  The chance of death from a pedestrian hit from a vehicle @ 30kmph is <10%. It's about 50% at 50kmph and >80% at 60kmph."
saskatoon,3dzzam,psailing,8,Mon Jul 20 22:42:29 2015 UTC,"Not to mention it's a road that winds.  Slowing to 40 for all of half a minute is hardly a sacrifice in the grand scheme of things.

However I'd still prefer 40 like Regina has.   There it's 40 for like 14 hours a day when there might actually be kids out, and not just during school hours when they are primarily inside  I would actually prefer however simply putting a chain link fence beside the road so kids can't possibly run into traffic no matter what the speed limit is."

Everyone used to complain about how stupid it was to put the arena downtown.  Downtown used to be impassable around game times.  You couldn't find any parking if you wanted to go downtown to shop, traffic snarls were so horrible it could take an hour to get out of downtown after a game.  When they announced the new arena was going to be on the outskirts of town, everyone cheered.  Finally, downtown wouldn't be choked on a game night.  Finally you'd be able to find parking.  So I find it hilarious twenty years later, you can actually say putting it downtown is a good idea with a straight face.  The grass is always greener on the other side...    EDIT:  I will mention that part of the reason it was cheered was that there were also promised interchanges and changes to access to 'Saskatchewan Place' that, twenty years on, have not happened."

To compare, I took a suit to Rays a couple years ago to be altered and fitted, and they just suggested moving the buttons (?!) .. Downtown Tailor stood me up, marked it out, went very detailed -- and when I came back to pick it up a few days later, it felt and looked like a custom-made suit."
saskatoon,3e21hz,BangBangControl,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"I had a terrible experience with Downtown Tailor and Shoe Repair.  Granted it was a shoe repair and not clothing alteration, but I'll never set foot in their store again after that experience.  I needed to get a pair of shoes resoled.  I supplied the new soles.  They took my shoes, outsourced the job to another shoe repair place and had them do it for $30, then charged me $80!  Then the new soles started to fall off after a few weeks.  When I took the shoes back to them, their solution was awful and they basically ruined my shoes trying to reattach the soles.  The woman who runs the place was very unpleasant.  Her assistant was nice but that doesn't make up for the owner's attitude or the fact that they ripped me off and then ruined my shoes.  As for Ray's tailor, I had a shirt altered there a few weeks ago.  He did an amazing job and the cost was surprisingly low.  I suspect that he didn't understand what you were asking him to do when he recommended moving the buttons.  If you can communicate what you want done I have no doubt that he'll do it perfectly.  I was extremely impressed with the work he did for me, and Ray's will get all of my future business.  And for shoes, Quality Shoe Repair is the place to go.  Stay away from Downtown Tailor and Dishonest Overcharging Bad Attitude Shoe Repair."

Probably the most I've seen in an airport.  Beautiful.  Lots of leather chairs to sit in (actual chairs, not the typical airport chairs.  Tons of gates.  Waaaaay more than they need.  Lots of room to hide and not be surrounded by people.  The Bad:  width is a bit tight.  Line up for flights boarding spill out into main corridor.   Confusing space where security used to be.  Just a dusty blank spot that looks like a warzone.   You see it as you arrive & go down the escalators and thru the arrival doors.  The ugly: CATSA lines can get crazy long.  So can CBSA lines.  As I fly several times a month my Nexus card gets me thru no line.  For everyone else it sucks.  The baggage carrousels have 0 signage as to what flight baggage is where.  It's a complete clusterfuck when more than one flight has arrived. It's just a guessing game.   The new baggage carrousels (furthest from the cabline/street) feel like a dungeon.

saskatoon,3dsm0x,TroyEdmund,4,Sun Jul 19 13:47:37 2015 UTC,I've been fostering and working rescue for 8 years now. They are not thought of very well by other rescues and I've had my own experience with them. I delivered a dog back to them that was being returned from a different city as they contacted other rescues looking for help to transport.  I knew nothing about them so I just thought they worked like other rescues. I didn't bring the dog to a foster home but to a facility that has since been shut down. This rescue brings chihuahuas and pitbulls up from the states. (There was even an episode of border patrol where they needed another trailer as there were too many dogs. Also the trailer that flipped coming into Canada that was horrific for those dogs)  The pit bulls were in these make shift built kennels not proper ones. Small dogs were kept in those cat kennels like at humane societies. I felt sick leaving the dog I brought there and even offered to surrender him to my rescue since they didn't have a foster. They never got back to me.   The facility was really small too. I reported them to the SPCA and they were aware of the rescue and the facility for some time.
saskatoon,3dsm0x,recyclethat,3,Sun Jul 19 14:42:03 2015 UTC,"That's really unfortunate to hear, I'm sure their heart is in the right place but if they don't have the facility and equipment to do it right, they should be leaving it up to better shelters.

Hopefully they make some changes and get their organization running better."

saskatoon,3dsm0x,slowy,2,Mon Jul 20 23:04:02 2015 UTC,"I'll try to keep it simple/short.  This was in 2012 when I was looking for a dog to adopt. Me and the head of the rescue organized to meet at about 4 or 5pm on a Friday night, at the house I was moving into, to do an introduction with the dog I was interested in, with the dog living there. She had my address, phone number etc beforehand.  She simply didn't show up. Any attempts to contact didn't work. Found her on Facebook and discovered dog had an health-issue that went unmentioned - it wasn't a huge deal for me, but I would to have liked to have known. Waited quite a few hours with my friend until I finally got a text at 2am Saturday morning saying her phone had died and couldn't charge it so she couldn't come - despite having my address already.  I was pretty pissed, but I really wanted to see this dog. So we organized to meet at 3pm the next day. She's 3.5 hours late, walks into the house with her boyfriend (?) and apologizes for the dog being so energetic... As it had been in the car all day. Dog was a Pit Bull mix who was quite in shape and she had it quite literally on a leash meant for dogs the size of a Shih Tsu.   Dog was reactive with the residential dog. Leash broke, obviously. She just tells us to take the two for a walk, spend the night and see how it goes. Leaves a can of food, says we can feed the dog as it hadn't eaten yet. Then just leaves. She didn't even look past our living room/yard (home checks??) Like she must have been there 10 minutes and left, there was no real opportunity to even elaborate on things if the dogs didn't get along. She just left a dog with someone she just met and knew nothing of.  Dogs didn't get along, took for walk (the dog was absolutely nuts, needed a lot of exercise and obviously didn't get any that day) and so forth. Eventually I had to call her and get her to come back for the dog. I didn't want to take a risk of the two dogs fighting. Took her a bit, but she came thankfully.  Also worked in a (shitty) west-side pet store for about 4 months. Met tons of guys who would come in and literally ask me how to get ""their pit bull real beefy"" (what kinds of food would help) When I would show them the good brands of dog food, they'd be considered too expensive. One couple came in, girl was pregnant, with a little red pit bull mix who was skin and bones. They were walking it on a frayed leash wrapped around its neck and were trying to find it the cheapest harness we had. I remember they mentioned the dog didn't like kids either. All these people told me they got the dogs from Adopt A Paw, so it appears they hand off dogs to anyone who's interested. People who can't afford dog food or even a collar/harness for their animal might not be the best candidates, in my opinion.  Later I got a dog from a different rescue who handled things wonderfully.   Things might have changed since then, but who knows. People from other rescues don't seem all too thrilled with Adopt A Paw but no one says anything outright, because of how small the community is, I think."
saskatoon,3dsm0x,ParrotWithParkinsons,3,Tue Jul 21 00:51:43 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea to consider. One thing that I kind of wish I had done before I adopted my dog, get on the foster home list for several shelters and just start taking in dogs/pups one or two at a time. This way you'll maybe get to see what types of dogs you and your boyfriend like the most or their energy levels. Meeting a dog once or twice at a shelter doesn't always give you the best idea of what they will be like, plus you'll be helping the shelters too!"

As far as I know, you can trim the branches as long as it doesn't stop the tree from growing in the future or ""hurt"" the tree's future growth.   Now I'm no lawyer, but if you contact the city and ask about the ""The Property Maintenance & Nuisance Abatement Bylaw, 2003"" you can ask if the tree sap falling onto your car falls under the ""Untidy and Unsightly Property"", ""Duty to Maintain"", or ""Maintenance of Yards (f) dead or hazardous trees"" sections.

saskatoon,3dr0i7,harmfuladam,8,Sat Jul 18 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"I've gone through PA, Waskesiu (taking Hwy 263, nice and twisty), then on to La Ronge, and then back, taking a variety of secondary highways south from PA and coming back through North Battleford.  This was in November a few years back, when we had that freakish warm weekend and it got to 17 degrees.  The highway north of Waskesiu was in perfect condition and utterly deserted.  I've also done Drumheller as a day trip; I spent my time there taking every paved road I could find through the canyons, but you could skip that and do the Tyrell museum instead.  Also went home by a different route.  Both trips were a little over 1200 km; a bit longer than some people would consider for a day trip, but nothing a sport-touring bike with a big fuel tank and a Corbin seat can't handle.  Especially if you plan the route so there's usually no one else on the road for miles around, and you don't have to pay too much attention to speed limits.  I wouldn't try it on a naked bike (too fatiguing) or anything with a short cruising range (too annoying).  I hear Flin Flon is a great road trip, but you'd need at least 2 days.  Maybe a bit more if you wanted to take the road that comes back south through Manitoba, which is what I would do if possible.  Nothing more boring than going for a ride and then having to turn around and retrace your route back . . . which is why even a short ride out from Saskatoon ends up being 300 km if you want to avoid backtracking."

The knock offs will typically work with the exception of hardware acceleration, which is very important when dealing with these processors, which were designed for cell phones. The programming community will concentrate on the most popular chipsets, which means that even similar chipsets won't work very well.   Even when I did get a well supported one, I was still having issues streaming 1080p content (I did not want to use transcoding like Plex). I made sure that the hardware acceleration was working.   I decided to give up on the Arm based stuff and built an htpc using a laptop with an AMD A8 processor that I wasn't using. Completely solved all of the issues I was having. Way better performance all around.   If you definitely need a small footprint, or if you don't mind using a transcoder, then it should work for you.

Picked up a smart TV that supported Netflix and Plex. Never used MINIX again. Plex sucks and is cumbersome. Buddy who is least computer savy person I know installed XBMC  and streams everything free off the net somehow (haven't delved deeper). Isn't technically legal but your not downloading so you won't get a letter. So I'd say get a smart TV skip the MINIX sign up for Netflix and setup xbmc. One thing that sucks though is if you watch any sports. I don't except riders, but its easy to find a bar or friends house with it on. Good luck and have fun. Also if you are set on a MINIX like device check out somecooltech on YouTube. Lots of good info."

All we had to do was pick what food we wanted and get a liquor license. The prices were very reasonable. They supply all bar staff complete with ice and mix. All linens, plates, glasses and utensils also included. We even had our ceremony in the museum itself. They will set up chairs at the train platform and you can get married at the Boomtown train station. It makes for very cool pictures. Also all of your guests will get free admission to the museum for the day. That worked out great for us because it gave people something to do while the bridal party was off getting pictures done. The kids loved it. The only thing is you can't supply your own food for the midnight lunch. You can however supply the desserts for the midnight lunch. I believe the rule was as long as it is baked it's ok. This place is definitely worth looking into. The level of service you get for the price is a real good deal."

saskatoon,3dfjag,pimpintuna,10,Thu Jul 16 04:15:08 2015 UTC,"People are crying censorship, but the reality is that's it's just an inappropriate venue.  If I went to a political rally and the politician started a burlesque routine, my response would be ""Put your clothes back on, stop wasting our time with the dancing, and talk about why we're here!""  If 'Rosie Bitts' really wanted to talk politics, then her burlesque show should've explicitly said ""A burlesque show with some political commentary"" or the like.  The irony is that I actually agree with her cause.  I just think it's stupid to advertise a burlesque show, then use it as a political pulpit unless you warn the audience first."
saskatoon,3dfjag,anargumentclinic,16,Wed Jul 15 22:34:33 2015 UTC,"The article strongly suggests the politics she was talking about were the politics surrounding burlesque, and the description also makes it sound it like her intent was to be funny.  I don't know if you've been to many burlesque shows but there is often a fair bit of chatting with the audience and humour. They generally aim for titillating entertainment, which is one of the big differences between it and strip clubs (which I also support). I've been at a Burlesque show where they introduced a trans-gendered performer and did a little speech about trans-rights and etc that was filled with comedy and more than a few saucy flashes of skin. Trans-rights are currently a hot political topic, but I certainly felt it was fair game in the context of the event I was attending.   If she started talking about electoral districts or resource rights or something I'd be right with you. But talking about tits and nipples is totally par for the course, even if that means talking about the rules surrounding tits and nipples and how the government keeps going back and forth.  Ironically, if she was allowed to strip during the performance I actually think it would have been way funnier, as she probably could have used her own ample assets to highlight and tease out her points in a more entertaining/burlesquey way."
saskatoon,3dfjag,beeblez,10,Thu Jul 16 05:52:04 2015 UTC,Art can have all kinds of messages. Sometimes the messages are political.
saskatoon,3dfjag,AlienStephanie,4,Thu Jul 16 00:47:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what a burlesque show is. You are probably thinking strip tease. I agree with beeblez, that there is a humourous interchange of dialogue involved in all the burlesque shows I've seen. See Absinthe in Vegas, or Treasure Tavern in Orlando. Both shows have presented humourous dialogue and audience participation, and inherhently challenge the politics surrounding issues such as gender, homosexuality, nudity (of course), and racism.   This is censorship. This is typical of our staunch moralistic ferver. She was doing the show the hired her to do. And they blushed."
saskatoon,3dfjag,whyyousuchababy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:14:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with beeblez, that there is a humourous interchange of dialogue   Yes!  Humorous!  That's burlesque.  Serious political commentary?  No thank you!  EDIT:  Just to clarify, burlesque is a performance.  By definition, burlesque is ""a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.""  If people are not laughing, and telling you to get off the stage, that's not censorship, that's poor burlesque."
saskatoon,3dfjag,anargumentclinic,3,Thu Jul 16 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the video, but the article reads it was a ""gentle ribbing"" and ""Bitts’s show had gone over well with the audiences during its run at Swift Current’s Chautauqua Theatre Festival [...] When she was tapped to be an opener for a different show Friday night, she figured some topical, regional humour would be appropriate"". It doesn't sound like ""serious political commentary"" to me.   She was censored for commenting on the government at a performance where one of the sponsors is a government lottery, Saskatchewan lotteries. Ironic that they would have asked a burlesque show to perform anywhere that a government affilated sponser would be. It's their own damn fault in that case. They blundered, not her."
saskatoon,3dfjag,whyyousuchababy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:15:47 2015 UTC,"They blundered, not her.   And that's where we differ.  Because, my understanding is that if you are an entertainer, if the crowd doesn't 'get you', it means you blundered.  It's not ""the audience's blunder"", like you're saying.  I'm a comic.  I stand up and do a bunch of jokes about how funny it is that ISIS is beheading innocent children.  I get taken off the stage.  That's not censorship, that's being an awful comedian.  A good entertainer needs to learn how to read the room.  Things that might get me booed off the stage in New York might be cheered in California.  But if I advertise a comedy routine and do the same routine in both places, I'm the one that sucks.    Here's the simple facts:  Burlesque is a form of entertainment ""intended to cause laughter"".  That's the very definition.  As Rosie Butts clearly stated, she did the same show for a corporate crowd that she'd done for the fringe audiences.  And then she cried censorship when they didn't find it funny and asked her to stop.  As I said at the beginning, I support the message Rosie was trying to spread.  But even I know that the way I phrase myself for a fringe audience needs to be different from how I phrase myself for a corporate audience if I want to be successful in making them laugh and making them think.  Instead, Rosie just performed the same routine.  That's her blunder, not her audience."
saskatoon,3dfjag,anargumentclinic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I wasn't clearly stating the pronoun ""they"". I am referring to the organizers of the event, the one in the article who stopped they show and pulls her off stage. I'm saying the organizer blundered by pulling her off stage and censoring her. I don't think the audience had anything to do with it. Take for example, you go to see a comedic movie, and for a scene it get's political. The projectionist doesn't turn off the movie and apologize to the audience saying ""I'm sorry this was not what we were intending for you to see tonight"" just because it wavers from the genre for 5 minutes. It's your own right and responsibility to stand up and walk away if you don't want to hear it. The projectionist doesn't speak for the whole audience’s opinion. How can they? They are one person. How can the projectionist assume they know everyone in the audience isn't enjoying the show? The projectionist would literally have to stop the show and take a poll and decide what percentage warrants shutting it down. And what would that be? 10% 25%, 51%?   With this example in mind, you can see it's clear that the organizer is in the wrong, not the performer. The organizer doesn't speak for its audience, and to give the audience their due credit, they are smart enough to know what burlesque is and if they want to continue watching or get up and walk away. Also note, “a nervous woman from the Lyric Theatre quickly pulled the plug”. It seems the one exception to the organizer being in the wrong, is that it is possible the performer included content in her act that wasn’t included in a previous performance which decidedly got her the spot at the Lyric Theatre. However, It is a theatre, and it prides itself on their website in their diversity of art including ‘hardcore and punk shows’. They have a stage for the freedom of expression and art, but when it comes to upsetting the hand that feeds them because a woman farcically points out how obviously ridiculous the laws around nudity for women are, they lose the courage of their conviction and censor the artist, “a nervous woman from the Lyric Theatre quickly pulled the plug”. It is indeed unfortunate the Lyric Theatre used to be a Vaudeville theatre, and it now it appears that its spirit is broken.   TLDR; it's because there were government sponsors involved, not poor audience reception that the organizer decided they had to stop the show. Censorship in the name of continuing sponsor support (as opposed to censoring freedom of speech to maintain an audiences ideology)."
saskatoon,3dfjag,whyyousuchababy,2,Thu Jul 16 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're implying the organizer pulled the plug against the wishes of the crowd.  If that's true, that is indeed censorship.  But the article says   Bitts was essentially told to shut up and dance. ""That killed me,"" she says. ""Let us just sexualize you, but we don’t want to actually hear from you.""   It was not the organizer who told her to shut up and dance... (at worst the organizer just acted to stop the performance)  That sounds like it came from the audience.  If that's the case, then I respectfully disagree."
saskatoon,3dfjag,anargumentclinic,0,Thu Jul 16 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"I don’t think you are understanding the article’s retelling of what happened that night. The article states, “The woman [this being the woman who is from the Lyric Theatre, to wit, an organizer of the event] is hard to hear on the recording but, after thanking Rosie for her dance [implying this was the interruption of Rosie’s gentle political ribbing] and asking if she had another [dance], she said something like, ""We have support from different areas, and I didn’t realize we’d be doing this tonight."" One of those supporters is Saskatchewan Lotteries, which the woman thanked after promptly moving on to the raffle”. That unnamed woman is an organizer of the event. Why would an audience member get up and thank the sponsors and move on to a raffle. It is clearly the organizer here who is trying to save her sponsorship.  I’ve tried to steer you to see the topic of my argument is centered on the idea that the organizer blundered for censoring a show because of their neglect to properly vet the show for their venue given their sponsors, and for assuming art couldn’t be challenging. This is an example of censorship for the sake of profits or gains, and may also include ideologies, but not necessarily in this case. Whether you agree or not, and please continue to engage in me in this dialogue, this is historically why the performance was stopped at the Lyric Theatre in Swift Current as indicated by the details of the article of the Winnipeg Free press.  You are arguing that a show should either change mid-performance or be shut down depending on the audiences’ enjoyment. That is another topic entirely, and doesn’t appear to be the reason for why the performance was stopped at the Lyric Theatre in Swift Current. To your statement that the performer blundered, it’s her fault she got shut down because she wasn’t entertaining enough. I agree that can be true for comedians, but that isn’t true for movies or live theatre. They have a script, or a set of scenes that they will stick to, even when ad-libbing and improvisation are allowed. The show goes on regardless of the audience’s enjoyment. That would be censorship for the sake of the audiences’ enjoyment. I don’t think that was the case here, and also isn’t the case very much anywhere. I will use the Saskatoon Soaps, god bless them, as an example. They sometimes suck hard, but very few if any of the audience leaves before the end. And certainly, the owner of the Broadway theatre doesn’t come up and shut it down because they aren’t being funny. Finally, even when they improvise around a challenging or political topic, nobody shuts them down. It would be wrong to do so."
saskatoon,3dfjag,whyyousuchababy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:27:50 2015 UTC,"You are arguing that a show should either change mid-performance or be shut down depending on the audiences’ enjoyment.   Nope.  Never said that, never implied it, never even hinted at it in all my writings.  Just the fact you said that implies you aren't reading what I wrote and I find that a bit disheartening because I've extended you the courtesy of actually reading what you wrote.  No, the way I understand the article is that she, Rosie, started some heavy, absolutely not funny like burlesque is supposed to be, political discussion.  The audience told her to ""shut up and dance"" as Rosie herself says.  Then the organizer, seeking to prevent things from getting ugly, jumped up and ended the performance.  And, as I have been saying all along, that's not censorship.  That's a lousy performance."
saskatoon,3dfjag,anargumentclinic,2,Thu Jul 16 22:33:03 2015 UTC,"“Nope. Never said that, never implied it, never even hinted at it in all my writings.”  What does this imply then?:  “I'm a comic.

I read that as you implying that you are being taken off the stage by the club owners for the sake of the audiences enjoyment. And that you support and back that idea up.   You said all of that. I’m beginning to get disheartened at your lack of commitment to your own words. Don’t get offended. I am reading what you are writing and honestly trying to understand your position. I’ve spent much more time composing my messages to you, than you have spent composing your messages to me. Perhaps you should be clearer with your examples, or make more effort to crystallize your position.  I am committed to this conversation, as is evident with the propensity and number of my words. Please don’t feel belittled; this is a great discourse.  To continue the conversation, I believe you are in fact misinterpreting the night of the performance. We do have different perspectives on the subject. I think it would be a good idea to get the video involved. However, I’m not sure where that is. Let’s find that video, and see how things play out."

If women really made 83 cents for every dollar a man makes why wouldn't companies just hire women?  They don't because that statistic is just a myth.  Women make 83 cents to the dollar when you take the median earnings of every women and compare them to the median earnings of every man, this doesn't take into account hours worked, time off, job title or even employment status.  Basically what you're doing is you're taking the average salary of a bunch of rig-pigs and engineers and comparing it to the salary of a bunch of stay-at-home moms and school teachers.  A woman in the same position as a man who works the same amount of time will make the same amount of money.  If she isn't making the same amount of money for the same amount of work in the same position, there are laws against it and she has every right to complain."

saskatoon,3dcsb4,BaronVonHugenSchlong,5,Wed Jul 15 06:51:28 2015 UTC,"It depends what kind of software you want to be writing.  A CST diploma is a great starting point because if you can't get a job that you want afterwards they have a deal with the U of S so you can jump straight in to 3rd year computer science with it (or close, i'm not familiar with the specifics)  University is more theoretical with less practical experience.  You will have a deeper understanding of the reasoning behind more subjects, but you will have very nearly no practical experience putting that knowledge to use.  It also takes 2 extra years.  It does however open the door in the future to getting an MBA etc if you are so inclined.  It also makes moving to another country easier when you have limited experience.  From Sask Polytech doing CST you will have a limited understanding of why things are done the way they are, but you will have far more practical experience ""doing work"".  In general people from CST take less time become productive on a team.  I happen to do a lot of hiring for a tech company and I don't give any preference to candidates with one or the other.  I've hired great people from both programs.  My personal recommendation would be to look in to the details of the CST --> comp sci 3rd year program.  That way you can potentially get the best of both.  The only caveat is i'm not sure what the pitfalls are of trying to jump straight in to 3rd year comp sci classes."

saskatoon,3dcsb4,notz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:03:19 2015 UTC,"University might have less practical experience but it I would definitely not say it gives very nearly none, after having gone through the degree myself. There's plenty enough actual coding - much more than many other universities that focus almost entirely on the theoretical.  The university also has more specialized classes, such as machine learning, image processing, AI, graphics, etc, that you can choose what you like from. I'm not sure how SPT is in that regard."
saskatoon,3dcsb4,mdchris,2,Wed Jul 15 21:16:23 2015 UTC,"Coding and practical application of knowledge as you would in the real world are not the same thing though, and that is specifically what I was talking about.  CST definitely does not give you choices related to machine learning, AI, etc.  That's part of the trade off you make for 2 years vs 4.  Depending what you want from your career that may be relevant but it may not."
saskatoon,3dcsb4,cacheerio,3,Wed Jul 15 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"Lots have already mentioned going straight from Sask Polytech to University. Another great option is to get a job straight out of Sask Polytech and have your employer pay for your degree, often there is strings attached to this. But, you can work full time and get your degree if that is something that might appeal to you. It definitely would save on student loans if the employer pays for the majority of your university credits.  The CST is well respected across the province and will get your foot in the door at most companies.   I have been out of the program 8 years now, the only reason I can now see to get my degree is to move into management."

In either case they would prefer probably 5 years experience.  Diploma = 2 years, + 5 years experience = 7 years.  Degree = 4 years, + 5 years experience  = 9 years.  I have seen people from both. The amount of salary increase from one to the other.. Degree comes out making more right out of school, but if you factor in doing Siast in 2 years, and having 2 years experience, they are the same salary. And doing the Siast route, you don't have 2 more years of student loan debt, and no more part time junk job to carry you through those last two years.  My opinion, there are lots of jobs. I would go CST route. Go for a degree if you want to work at somewhere that requires it, ex the university itself."

I can't remember if foot traffic is currently allowed to cross."

saskatoon,3d9s57,Old_James,17,Tue Jul 14 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"Can we please stop with the ""Shine on!"" headlines. Bad/stupid/mentally ill people are not unique to Saskatoon. I don't mind people sharing this content but to imply that this kind of behavior is due to the location is ridiculous.  Just a minor gripe but I'm sure some people agree. Vote me up or down."
saskatoon,3d9s57,red914,2,Tue Jul 14 20:43:55 2015 UTC,"And the suspect is from PA, and not Saskatoon."
saskatoon,3d9s57,ducksarewet,8,Wed Jul 15 20:33:58 2015 UTC,At least it's not Winnipeg!
saskatoon,3d9s57,wapimaskwa,9,Tue Jul 14 20:57:45 2015 UTC,Saskatoon: At least its not Winnipeg. That is a better city slogan.
saskatoon,3d9s57,BrockYXE,4,Tue Jul 14 22:10:56 2015 UTC,Saskatoon: Winnipeg lite

saskatoon,3d9s57,photogjs,4,Tue Jul 14 21:06:38 2015 UTC,The suspect is a 17-year-old from PA that has TWO outstanding warrants.
saskatoon,3d9s57,bwrbe,5,Wed Jul 15 01:39:50 2015 UTC,The cbc's lack of ability to proof read their stories and provide meaningful quotes that don't make people sound like hicks is quite depressing
saskatoon,3d9s57,pmf1985,6,Tue Jul 14 17:41:42 2015 UTC,I imagine that is how Tal actually speaks.
saskatoon,3d9s57,AS14K,4,Tue Jul 14 18:19:40 2015 UTC,Went to the same high school as this guy. I would agree lol.
saskatoon,3d9s57,JimmyTheWhaler,7,Tue Jul 14 18:58:20 2015 UTC,You'd be surprised how many random interviews you would have to give in Saskatoon before you found someone who DIDN'T sound like a hick.

saskatoon,3ddypx,AbruptlyBlue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:24:21 2015 UTC,sure? but he's got a long run to number one... think you can get him back into the game?
saskatoon,3ddypx,red914,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:30:12 2015 UTC,I have to admit his video was really well done. You have to watch until the end. Too bad you have to use Facebook to vote.
saskatoon,3ddypx,MrsPrairielily,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:56:02 2015 UTC,I had the same response.
saskatoon,3db0i7,mylesandtheblanks,3,Tue Jul 14 21:47:37 2015 UTC,"I would say wander around the University. I think there was Boffins Garden? This looks familiar. http://www.boffins.ca/weddedbliss/tc.html#0  There is also a tree farm? off collage and preston?  The Bes is usually a famous spot, with the fountain and the stand on the other side. Other than that, there may be some ghost towns to visit, but those are usually too far for wedding day pictures."
saskatoon,3db0i7,-SubZer000z,2,Tue Jul 14 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I've definitely seen more than one group take pictures at both cemeteries."
saskatoon,3db0i7,BrockYXE,2,Wed Jul 15 00:16:52 2015 UTC,"The Willows has a ""big"" red barn that you may be able to use for photos."

saskatoon,3db0i7,upboatugboat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:34:50 2015 UTC,"an ex had grad pictures taken around the bez. theres obv good spots by the river, but what u should do is walk a good radius around there, not so much the river, but the old buildings 2-3 blocks from. theres like a old metal fire escape on this one that takes great photos, near that ice cream bus, and by the 711 is an alley with lots of stone. the building is stone and it has brick planters coming off the side. oh, also under the bridges take great photos, especially the one by the bez"
saskatoon,3db0i7,JoeDwarf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:16:31 2015 UTC,"We had ours taken by the old stone schoolhouse on campus. Lots use Innovation Place, there is the fountain/plaza and the garden/pond outside Boffins.   I saw one couple who took some photos right on Sask Cres, the shot was them in the middle of the street, framed by the rows of elms on either side. Cool idea for a shot."

saskatoon,3d7cmd,Bullshit_To_Go,14,Tue Jul 14 02:42:27 2015 UTC,It's the dreaded Dihydrogen Monoxide!
saskatoon,3d7cmd,Styrak,2,Tue Jul 14 02:51:02 2015 UTC,It has killed every human it's come in contact with.

saskatoon,3d7cmd,amillions,5,Tue Jul 14 03:03:06 2015 UTC,Monohydrogen dioxide is hydroxic acid.  That would be bad.
