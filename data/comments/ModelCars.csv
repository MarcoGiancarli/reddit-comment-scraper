ModelCars,3e2izv,iShieldy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure what Kobra spray paint is. (EDIT: Just read up, it's an acrylic indoor/outdoor spray paint, probably not good for models; if anyone's used it, please speak up).  For spray, you can go with Testor's Model Master lacquer or Tamiya.  Use a primer coat, then 2 coats of color, then 2 coats of clear.  If you want to give it a scale-like smooth high-gloss finish, I recently posted the steps to go from clearcoat to mirror-finish."
ModelCars,3e2izv,disgustipated,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:01 2015 UTC,How long does each 100ml spray can last roughly on a 1:32 model and how many it can do on a 1:24 model? In addition how long does the primar and clear coats last for ?
ModelCars,3e2izv,disgustipated,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:13 2015 UTC,"I can do one 1/24 scale car with one 3oz (88ml) can each of primer, color, and clear."

ModelCars,3duoag,CivicSiGuy,8,Sun Jul 19 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"The greatest thing since sliced bread, a window mask. Clear pieces from some kits, I don't know about this one, have a very smooth clear portion that mimics the actual glass and a rough portion that you can paint black. Just lay it onto the glass as best and as accurately as so you can paint around it without worrying about about ruining the glass."
ModelCars,3duoag,DarqueChocolade,7,Sun Jul 19 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"If you go the spray route, or even solvent-based brush paint, I suggest a coat of clear before the black. That way if anything seeps underneath it'll be the clear."

If you're referring to aftertmarket wheels I don't agree with that either. The only problem with those is the availability, in Japan Aoshima and Fujimi wheels are a lot more available domestically obviously. It's greedy suppliers importing genuine wheel sets marking them up to 200% of what they are in Japan."
ModelCars,3dpkox,5yj,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:07:44 2015 UTC,"Revells donk kits were actually really late to the party because during that time the squat movement was already established as more people figured out you dont need super lifts to fit wheels. Availability is a big issue still Jada and Maisto diecast were the only source and it seems theyve pulled back so little by little that market is shrinking aside from the 5 set 19.99 wheels which 90% of big wheel modelers already have. In the donk game your wheels set the standard if your wheels arent up to date you wont get laughed at but you wont also get anyones attention which is why the brand matters, Forgiato, Amani, Savini, Dub, and Asanti are the most requested wheels. I work with 3 of those to put out wheels for models with their design."

Novus Polish Mates - cloth-like paper, works great for application of all Novus compounds.

Received 3 fronts and 1 rear tire, sent an email to Revell and they sent a new rear.

The glue doesn't look thick or deep. Try rubbing it off first. Maybe some toothpaste. Try nail polish remover or isopropyl alcohol. I don't remember if that works or not.

Sometimes, I've taken on making composites of two models to make another one that just isn't made (I'm still working on a 2013 60th Anniv. Corvette 427 Roadster) and I made a working steering rack for a Revell 2010 Mustang (as the build was supposed to be based off of a drift car; still working on that too.) Recently, I've started ordering parts to turn the Revell 2015 Mustang into a race car, but it's still in mockup stage with parts (over fenders, grille mesh, etc.) on order."

They can strip the paint without compromising the integrity of the plastic. Just soak it, covered, in a foil cake tin for about a day and then scrub clean with a toothbrush (er, not the one you actually use, obviously). Do not use paint thinner--like, ever--as it will degrade the plastic.  Likewise, if you have the same problem with Lacquer paint, simple isopropyl alcohol will work.

ModelCars,3cka3w,Turbojett,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:40:04 2015 UTC,I should ask how many coats of paint/how thick have you been doing them?

I should say I'm not inexperienced with rattle cans and have used them for many years on multiple model cars, but I've always used tamiya acrylics and only moved to enamel recently, last model was blue and enamel covered quicker and more evenly than the tamiya but this time with white neither the tamiya or the enamel seem to be doing a decent job."

For both our benefits, really, because I just got a '68  Volkswagen that I plan to paint white (you might see where I'm going with that), which is a color I've always avoided, because most clearcoats give it a yellowish tinge.  What color primer are you using? Maybe if it were a white primer, I bet you might be able to get away with it after clearcoating it."

As the brush empties the drops become smaller. When they become very small they make good brake dust.   Also,  is not really marbles that build up,  it's more like tire turd skid marks.  I road raced with nasa for a few years so I got used to wiping these off the car.  The marbles tend to build up inside the car though."

It had a foam backing with a thin layer of this suede-like material on the front, so I figured it was perfect. I ripped off the foam on the back and used my X-acto knife to cut it perfectly to size for the trunk area, and used some extra pieces for the floorboards."

ModelCars,3beh9f,just_trollin_around,4,Sun Jun 28 13:56:48 2015 UTC,"This is by no means what  you have to buy to get started, but these are the things that make it much easier to build, and give you the confidence to take your skills to the next level.  Tools:   X-Acto knife with extra blades Really good pair of tweezers. Seriously, a $20 pair of fine-point titanium tweezers makes a world of difference when handling parts. I got mine from a jewelry supply store. Helping hands type vise Small bamboo skewers, popsicle sticks, various grocery store items make it easier to hold parts when painting. Alligator clips on sticks can be bought or made. The Tamiya Spray-Work Painting Stand Set is awesome. Rubber bands, small spring clamps Sandpaper or sanding sticks in varying grits, starting at 600. Assortment of glues - Testor's ""model master"" with the needle tip works much better than the squeeze tubes. White glue for clear parts, superglue for photo-etch and other non-plastic. Brushes - a variety pack is fine for getting started, you'll basically want extra fine, fine, and regular. As you get better, brushes will become a personal choice. Also, get some disposable mixing cups or use a plastic watercolor palette to thin your bottle paints. Paints - the Testor's model car starter sets will give you basic colors in enamel; these are great for everything small; not the body or chassis. For those, you'll want to spray, either with cans or an airbrush. There are also specialty paints like Alclad II for simulating metal finishes. Testor's Model Master has a factory color matching series, so you can get Hemi Orange, Plum Crazy, etc. As you gain experience, you might want to consider using acrylics; they're extremely popular with the pro modelmakers who do tanks, planes, etc. Oh, and don't forget thinner. You'll need it for not only thinning paints, but cleaning brushes and mistakes as well.   Pitfalls:   WAIT FOR THE GLUE TO DRY!  Nothing ruins an assembly like handling it before the glue is fully dry. If you're the impatient type like me, then plan three or four subassemblies in advance, so you have something to do while stuff dries. The less you mess with something, the better it comes out. Seriously, avoid the temptation to nudge that piece a hair before the glue dries. It'll just go too far and smear glue everywhere. The ""zen"" goal of modeling is to futz with it as little as possible. When you paint with brushes, thin your bottle paints. It takes practice to determine how much based on the surface, desired effect, etc. If you have a junk model or bargain bin kit you don't care about, use that for testing. When you paint with spray cans, start 8-10 inches away, start and finish your passes off the model, and apply thin coats until it just starts to shine, then stop. The paint will flatten and look better as it cures, but if you spray more coats after the surface is covered, you'll get runs and bumps. Paint does best in a cool, dry, dust-free environment. Get an $89 paint booth if you can afford it, or make one out of tupperware containers and a fan. Just be sure to use brushless fans only; paint fumes are highly flammable.   A few more thoughts:  The level of satisfaction you receive from this hobby is proportional to what you put into it. From, ""Hey, look what I did over the weekend"" to First Place at the Nationals, there's a wide variety of talents and skills, and all of them can make you sit back and smile (or throw it against the wall!) Be happy with your creations, and don't let anyone tell you they suck, unless you're at a master's/competitive level.   As you learn, decide what you want to improve on. Paint? Removing seams and manufacturing marks? Ultra-realistic details? It's all up to you. Hell, I could go on for another 3 paragraphs just on surface prep and sanding.  Don't mean to overwhelm, just had the time to type out a bunch to help a new guy.  Oh, the best advice I ever heard: When you finish your model, set aside time and reflect. Put on some music, grab a coke or a beer, put the finished model in front of you and give it a good gawking while thinking about the build. Admire your successes, admit your failures, and plan for the next one.  These are the two websites where I spend most of my modeling money:  Jack's Model Roundup - Great guy, excellent service, deep inventory.  Scale Model Hobbyist - Great selection, seem to always have stuff in stock that's sold out elsewhere.  There are many more out there, and as you learn more, you'll find Amazon a decent source as well."

Wash parts with soap & water before painting, IF you are going to paint. Use white glue like Elmers for clear parts so you can fix any mistakes with water. If you are going to build something for keeps and it has decals, you have got to clear coat it. I have some great builds that I was very proud of from 40 years ago that are now ruined because the decals peeled and flaked off. Clear coat would have sealed them in. But I didn't know the effect time would have on 'em."

Anyway, the box said it was a snap-together. It most definitely was not. Many parts required glue to stay in place, such as the frame, which was seperate from the rest of the platform, The carbs/air cleaners (yey, Tri-Power 389!), and the windows. The Pontiac Beak between the grilles required modification to fit halfway decently, and I think it's still crooked. The hood is also crooked and may need some minor tweaking (cutting off the snap-in pins on the underside of the hood. She needed hinges and she didn't get 'em.) Also, the back end of the body seems to be sitting crooked on the chassis (I hate that!), but that's probably my fault so I'll try to fix that later.

If you really like the molded colors, maybe just shoot some clear to make it look more like paint? Of course, it's your car, so do whatever looks right to you."
ModelCars,3b9ee8,6ft_2inch_bat,2,Sat Jun 27 03:56:49 2015 UTC,"Something like the wheels I'll usually leave as they are with minor alterations:  I will usually do a black wash in the crevices of wire-wheels that are molded as solid. (Makes it look open)  I scuff the wheel tread with an emory board to make the tread pattern look more realistic.  As for body parts, I always paint them because the kits I've gotten were never molded in the color I wanted them. And like the other response says it looks to plastic-like leaving it unpainted. Every kit I've gotten also had surface blemishes too so I had to cover then with something."
ModelCars,3b9ee8,Stoga,2,Sat Jun 27 04:21:55 2015 UTC,I usually use a base coat of Testors Metallic Silver #1246. It dries quick and it's thin. Just don't use it under hot paint. Silver generally makes a good barrier coat.
ModelCars,3b9ee8,blither,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:29:24 2015 UTC,colored plastic has no visual depth. Painting allows you to create visual depth to the parts.
ModelCars,3b9ee8,2oonhed,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:17:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. Always. Polystyrene is slightly translucent, no matter how thick it is.  It's got that ""plasticy"" look some of us don't want. However, in my younger years I remember liking the yellow color of the plastic on my Pisano & Matsubara funny car. My work around, I found out, was to coat the inside of the body with flat black and flat red fire walls to simulate the fireproof coatings, and a gloss coat on the outside after decals. I found that a silver coating on the insides of other builds could achieve the same light-blocking effect, making the body pieces look more solid. I also did this with the Revell BMW R75 kit molded in a wonderful blue plastic. In all cases, a clear gloss really made the plastic pop and gave it depth."

The biggest thing to me was the less paint, the better.  I would use a 10/0 brush, barely dab it in the paint, and spread as much area as I could.  Of course, this looks like a shotty paint job at first.  I would then lightly sand it, and do another coat.  Repeat until the desired 'flatness' of paint is obtained.  Also, I never thin my paints.  I'll probably get flak for that, but it just works for me."

ModelCars,3akdjg,notaspookorgook,2,Sun Jun 21 17:52:00 2015 UTC,"-wash parts before hand.  -what kind of paint? enamel, or lacquer? i noticed enamel bubbles easier. make sure you arent spraying too far, or too close. about a foot is what you want. start the can before the model, end the can after the model. never start/stop ON the model.  -let your can sit in a bowl of warm water for about 10 minutes. it goes on easier. and also, shake the can..a lot.   light coats first. do 3-6 light coats, do NOT worry about even coats. do a side of the car with a light mist, do the next, do the next. wait 15 minutes (if lacquer..dries much faster than enamel. another plus), and repeat. after your light coats, and the car is mostly the color you picked, do 2-4 heavy coats.   if you go straight up heavy coats from the beginning, you get paint drips, bubbles, or orange peel (look up an orange peel and youll know exactly what i mean)  -i only brush interior parts or engine parts. most of my work is spray can   use elmers glue for windows or headlights/taillights--dries on clear, and easy to remove if you fuck up   next thing i should mention is, in an ideal situation, you primer before you paint. priming are the same steps as above.   after you feel confident in your painting skills, but want an even better finish, then you start getting into sanding your paint coats. dont worry about that at the moment though."

The paints by Testors alls it says is acrylic, i will definitely be washing before starting on my next project, what brand of pain paint world you suggest? Or does the type only matters?"
ModelCars,3akdjg,notaspookorgook,2,Tue Jun 23 01:09:22 2015 UTC,"wait, did you paint the body of the car with the testors acrylic paint? i use spray cans. others use airbrush. but dont use brushes to paint your car.  i personally use tamiya lacquer paints. (find in hobby stores or model shops, or order online) its about 7-11 bucks per can, and itll last one car. you'll notice a huge difference.   overall, for your first it could be worse. your second model will probably look 1.5-2x better than the first. itll just take some time to learn good technique apart from bad. all that matters is, 1) you like it, and 2) you're improving.  heres some of mine:  http://imgur.com/a/SM8eM  (im no pro either)"

ModelCars,3ajvun,Jbr2015,3,Sat Jun 20 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"If youre painting the body or large parts like the chassis underbody, you should use the spray can (spray it from the can) or you can use an air brush (you will have to thin the paint depending on the flow). Using the paint from a spray can to paintbrush or airbrush with is called decanting I believe, I havent used it like that.  Here is what I do, I primer and paint the body areas with can paint, scribe the body lines with your razor and sand any casting imperfections. Primer the body, then let it dry and sand so the body is smooth (I just started using my airbrush and primered my '09 challenger with it, I wasted a bit getting to the right consistency and ran out) other large areas i just spray with a can no primer (chassis, interior etc).  Smaller parts like the engine, transmission, rear end, brakes and hoses things like that I use a paintbrush on.  It helps to have different size brushes to paint with so you can add detail to your chassis and engine bay.  Also try to find some pictures online of the interior, engine bay and chassis and body if you want to add some detail. hope this helps, good luck!"

ModelCars,3aawha,Tnfishdaddy,2,Thu Jun 18 16:48:17 2015 UTC,"You're gonna get a dozen varied opinions on this, but I'll throw my two cents in anyway.  I use Testors' Model Master Acryl when brush-painting and for some tasks when airbrushing, but I stick with Model Master enamels for most airbrushing.  Testors square bottles are great for some detail painting or small jobs, or when you can't find a color elsewhere.    Model Master Acryl tends to level out better and hide strokes when brush-painted, though it usually takes more than one coat.  The water washup makes it easy to clean brushes and go from color to color as well.    Enamels tend to atomize finer when airbrushing, so it can be more forgiving, and it bonds to plastic faster.  The serious downside to this is the fumes and the difficult cleanup process.  Enamels also tend to have a more reflective gloss.  Granted, these aren't hard and fast rules - Vallejo Model Air acrylic sprays like an enamel, for instance, and Tamiya acrylics have quite an awful odor for being acrylic.    I don't bother with rattle cans, because quite frankly, I suck at using them.    There's no hard and fast rule that you can't overlay with different types of paint, for the most part, but it's always worth testing on some scrap or a spare bit."
ModelCars,3aawha,screamingcheese,2,Thu Jun 18 17:26:12 2015 UTC,"I hate Testors' Enamel Spray. The nozzles clog and they take forever to dry. I'm fine with the bottle paints for brush painting, but for spray I try to buy Tamiya Lacquer whenever possible."
ModelCars,3aawha,RobSpires,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:16:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. Tamiya spray all the way. I generally use testors enamel for brush work but have been slowly converting to tamiya acrylics

I use Tamiya fine white primer, followed by 2 coats of Model Master lacquer color, then 2 coats of Model Master lacquer gloss clear.  Here are a couple of examples:   1970 Cuda 1966 GTO   Both were done with Testor's lacquers and Tamiya primer as described above.  EDIT: Here's an insanely detailed build log for the GTO."
ModelCars,3aawha,disgustipated,2,Thu Jun 18 21:36:17 2015 UTC,"Do the model master lacquers have the same nozzles as the Testors' Enamels? If so, do they clog up as bad? In my experience, the Testors' nozzles are fine for the first use, but make the paint orange peel really badly on every use after that. If the lacquers are better, that would be really good news as my closest hobby shop with Tamiya is almost an hour away..."

ModelCars,39srw0,usernameZero,3,Sun Jun 14 12:18:44 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed this build. What I really need to learn to do is wait between coats of primer/paint/clear though.
ModelCars,39srw0,notaspookorgook,3,Sun Jun 14 12:33:16 2015 UTC,"heres an album of some of my models! im no pro, clearly. but to a person who doesnt work on models, they are always impressed. i can never get my models to show quality, and i dont think ill ever be able to. but i dont mind too much. theres always a big fuckup, or a part that doesnt fit right. like my green mustang, you can see elmers glue on the windows. my red mercedez doesnt fit right on the chassis, so it sits a little high. also, i dropped the front bumper so theres marks in the paint, and i ran out of paint so i said fuck it. UGH. some of these models i link in my imgur album i did when i was like 17 (25 now). the lambo, skyline, benz, and green mustang are the newest.  http://imgur.com/a/SM8eM  for your torn decal, fill in the tear with a black sharpie or some black glass paint. it will help blend in more (hopefully)  as far as your paint... i was going to ask. what kind of paint did you use? for your first build, its incredible. so definitely respect to that. but the paint job isnt very good. its clean, and consistant. thats not the problem. the problem is the orange peel  for a long time i always used enamel paint. crap took FOREVER to dry, and it was so thick and heavy. i finally switched over to lacquer. its really light, and dries incredibly fast. are you using model-specific paint? i know you can go to home depot/lowes and find paint that will work just fine..but i personally, stick to tamiya. tamiya rattle cans are the absolute best, in my opinion (i dont air brush-only rattle can). the paint just goes on SOO easily.  heres my regime:   wash all parts in soapy water. i sand the body for any defects. i prime. again, i use tamiya primer. i lay a thin coat. /dry. /sand any hair or dust that got caught, and lay another. i repeat this until the primer is uniform and all on.  gently sand the primer so its super smooth. this really makes a difference. paint the car. the biggest mistake i did when i started this hobby is not doing small light coats.    i light mist the car. a TON of primer is still showing up everywhere. i wait 15 minutes. i light mist again. i wait 15 minutes. i light mist again. now, the whole car should be primarily green. maybe some spots lighter or darker, or some spots still show a little primer. -that is ok. the whole point of light misting is to help build uniformity across the car. you NEVER want to just do heavy coats right off the bat. you'll lose mold lines, and it will just look thick and crappy.  at this point, if i dont need to sand away any dust/hair/crap from the body, i will do my heavy coats. i do one heavy coat. take a look, if it looks debris-less, i do another. i usually do 2-4 heavy coats, depending on the color.   with the tamiya lacquer, its just so easy. i suggest you try it. sanding is also very important. before your paint was so deep on your car, you could have sanded away all that orange peel to create a more glossy and smooth surface.  it took me like 10 models to finally tell myself to SLOW DOWN. ive had models take me a few months, just cause i pick it up, do something small, put it back down. when i was younger, i was so impatient i was handling the car when it was still wet. now my big problem is, no matter what build..there is always ONE major problem that goes wrong. pisses me off so much!!!!  edit: also very important: shake your cans a LOT. also!!! a hidden secret is to soak your cans in warm water for about 10 minutes. warm-ish paint cans go on smoother and easier over cold cans."
ModelCars,39srw0,notaspookorgook,2,Sun Jun 14 20:14:03 2015 UTC,Everything you said about painting mistakes is dead on. I did heavy coats and didn't give things nearly enough time to dry. I used the Tamiya lacquers.
ModelCars,39srw0,anustart221,3,Mon Jun 15 00:03:48 2015 UTC,"oh wow. ok, yea. definitely light mist coats first then man. i seriously just give a side/spot a spray for a second. you can always go back and give it more. think about it like that. just to give it some sort of grasp how much i use of the paint. my can will be almost half gone by the time im done with my light mist coats. after my light mists, i like to give it a good soft wet sanding, to make those coats super smooth. then i lay down my heavy coats. also, make sure you paint correctly too. dont spray 5 inches from the body, dont spray 24 inches from the body. about a foot away, and start before one end, and then release the can after the other side. never stop/start spraying ON the model. your orange peel was due to partly the weather (which you mentioned) and from heavy sprays for too long.  also, read this. i personally dont polish, but the rest is still helpful  http://www.modelcarsmag.com/perfect-paint/  also, if you ever get more serious into model building- revell and amc make great kits (assuming your kit you used was the revell one). but a lot of them can be iffy too. at 15-25 bucks a box though, its a deal. but the tamiya, and aoshima model kits are far better. the molds look better, pieces fit better, and the directions are a lot more clear. revell has the good ol' classics locked down. with aoshima, tamiya, and fujishima, those kits will be more imports or tuners, like the models i showed you. theyll also be a lot more money. my benz, lambo, and skyline were all in the 50-70 dollar range. buy from online instead to save 25-75 percent, though (i didnt do that- couldnt wait :D)  another tip: i saw you used blue painters tape. for what you used it for, it seems to have worked just fine. but if you ever paint outside the body a different color, you'll really want to use tamiyas tape. if you're taping in a creased line, use something that will dig the tape into the line to prevent bleed thru...an end off of nail clippers, your finger nail, a butterknife, etc. then, spray that tape line with a coat of clear. it prevents bleed-thru from the next paint color. this is what i did on my skyline. the paint was pearl white, but the bottom was lined with gun metal grey. i still messed up in some spots cause it was my first time doing it, but it really helps.  https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=tamiya%20tape&es_th=1"

ModelCars,38qv46,evilHamsterzZz,3,Sat Jun 6 05:48:10 2015 UTC,It's a bit more involved. Sometimes you have to make sure that parts fit together nicely and may involve sanding or modifying parts. You'll need some kind of glue or plastic cement to join the parts together since they don't just snap together. Most of the time you'll need to paint everything too. You should probably check out some tutorials or do a little more research if its gonna be your first model car.
ModelCars,38qv46,evilHamsterzZz,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:55:13 2015 UTC,"I have some plastic glue left from my 40k set, so that should work.  I didn't know that you had to paint it, that should be fun.

A spray can puts out a much larger volume than an airbrush, so you want to stay at least 8-10 inches away from the surface, and make sure you don't hesitate or linger on a spot as you make your passes.  I wrote up a series of posts on how to get a mirror-finish with spray cans. Links to the threads below, there's plenty of text describing the process in posts, feel free to ask questions.  First post, body prep  GTO Engine & Body getting started  Chassis & Interior  Interior Part 2  Engine/Carb detail  Paint & Bodywork  Trim & Polish  Finished Album"
ModelCars,361qcc,disgustipated,2,Fri May 15 14:12:36 2015 UTC,I remember seeing your DIY post. I think that's what got me interested again in model cars.
ModelCars,361qcc,labelsk8er85,1 point,Fri May 15 23:24:15 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'll have to look at this when I have more time.
ModelCars,361qcc,6ft_2inch_bat,2,Fri May 15 14:30:00 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you, give or take a couple models.  I have yet to break down to purchase an airbrush.  I use spray cans (Tamiya specifically for me) and brush-applied enamels only.  As you mentioned, there are many different painting techniques.    If you utilize spray cans, make sure you buy at least 2 cans (from my past experience, one was not enough).  Also, get a can of surface primer that is applied after you clean the parts you are going to spray.  When spraying using a can, I like to do 2 light coats, about an hour in between.  Then I wait about 6 hours and start to do some thicker coats.  All told, my bodies have about 4-5 coats, depending on how much I like it.  After this, I wait about 48 hours and then use Tamiya's clear coat spray can.  It gets 2 light coats.  After waiting an additional 48-72 hours, I would start the polishing/waxing.  For the rest of the parts not on the body, I had paint.  Very, very light coats; everything takes at least 2-3 coats (depends on the coverage of the colour I am using).  Also, ensure that you prime everything as it will help the paint adhere to the item you are painting.  I have yet to master the art of polishing the body, so if anybody can provide some tips here, it would be greatly appreciated."

ModelCars,35xyat,6ft_2inch_bat,7,Thu May 14 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"For my airbrush I use the small ModelMasters and Testors glass jars, thinned about 1:1.  The biggest improvement I had was going from a tiny nonadjustable compressor to a small airbrush specific compressor with tank. I don't mix many custom colors. When I am thinning paint to use with my airbrush, I use a pippette to move the paint and thinner to a 1oz plastic bottle then shake to mix. I'll label the bottle with a sharpie."
ModelCars,35xyat,tn3239,1 point,Thu May 14 13:43:06 2015 UTC,"That is great to hear, thank you! Those have been my go-to paints for detail work by hand brush. They are also readily  available in my area as well as affordable.  Thank you for the thinning ratio as well, that was a challenge for me in the past. It might have been the airbrush I was using but I usually found I had to shoot at 25-30 psi and I wondered if I wasn't thinning my paints enough.  I do have an adjustable air compressor and you are right, I used to use the canned air and having that flexibility is key.  I think I'll get some pipettes and paint this weekend, thanks again for the advice!"
ModelCars,35xyat,CrtureBlckMacaroons,2,Thu May 14 15:22:39 2015 UTC,"You can get like 500 disposable pipettes on amazon for like $6. I also bought 100 disposable cuppies (like the kind you get when you buy medicine) for around the same price. I like to use those to mix and thin paints, and then pipette the paint onto my airbrush."
ModelCars,35xyat,CrtureBlckMacaroons,2,Thu May 14 20:17:34 2015 UTC,"Sweet! Thanks for the tip! I saw a video where a guy poured paint and thinner straight into the brush, put his thumb over the tip and triggered the brush at low pressure. It backed the air up and bubbled up through the cup mixing it. Obviously he was experienced, I like your method MUCH better."

ModelCars,34qifk,SoundMerc,3,Thu May 7 21:09:32 2015 UTC,"I would skip the first sanding of the base plastic.  You may be roughing it up too much and that's what causing all your orange Peel.  I usually scrub them with a toothbrush and some dish soap.   I even lightly sand the primer once it's dry.   Imagine painting a wall with a heavy/thick/rough section of plaster patch on it. So matter how much paint you throw on it, it'll look clumpy. If your base layers are rough it will show in the rest of the paint. Also I wouldn't use those square pads.  Just get some 1500-2000 WET sand paper.   Using it wet greatly reduces scratches cause the water rolls the sanded paint off instead of rubbing it back into the model.   And with the paper sheets you can fold/conform it to fit any shape to really get into tight spots. That paint job can be saved, just don't go so heavy and hard,  it's not a lotto scratch off.   Also try to keep the paper somewhat flat as you work with it,  heavy finger pressure will cause grooves that the clear will only help stand out more.   Try more of a very light rubbing instead of an actual hard back and forth.  Let the sandpaper do it's job slowly it won't require much force at all. I've worked in a body shop in the past and working on real cars isn't that different than a model car as far as sanding prep goes. Last tip I can give is practice on some scrap plastic just to get a feel for it. You'll pick it up and be fine in no time."
ModelCars,34qifk,Low718,1 point,Mon May 4 04:46:15 2015 UTC,Thank you for your comment. How much pressure should I apply and how long should I spend on each grit/tell if it's working?
ModelCars,34qifk,Low718,2,Thu May 7 01:45:33 2015 UTC,"There's no specific amount of time it depends on how rough/bumpy the paint Is.  I usually tell once the sandpaper starts slipping and I don't feel the paper dragging across any rough spots.   As far as pressure just light finger pressure is enough. less is more in this case, and keep an eye on it if you think your going to deep, stop! And move to another spot"
ModelCars,34qifk,TheJohnnyWombat,2,Thu May 7 05:06:53 2015 UTC,"I sanded the body, primed it, sprayed white paint over the primer and then a few main coats then a few coats of clear coat after that. The finish was glossy but still rough so I tried wet sanding it with a tooth brush then using revell's monogram sanding pads on the hood.   What should I do to get that polished surface I see on professional models?"
ModelCars,34qifk,6ft_2inch_bat,1 point,Sun May 3 17:56:08 2015 UTC,this helped me
ModelCars,34qifk,6ft_2inch_bat,2,Mon May 25 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"It looks like you may have applied a bit too much pressure to go down through all the layers like that.  I find it works well to spray in light mist coats building up your color.  Then, sand lightly with nothing coarser than 2000 grit. You're just trying to level out the paint before you gloss coat it. Your paint will look dulled but don't worry, gloss will take care of that.  From the looks of it, those pads might be a little stiff and hard to conform to the curves and contours of the car. That plus too much pressure left you with no paint on the flatter parts. I use the sanding films so I can roll them and apply smaller surfaces to the car.  But definitely lighten up on the pressure. Note: not trying to sound like a critical jackass, I've made the same mistakes as you and then some.   Edit: The paint job can be saved on this car, maybe strip it and start over bit dinner give up.

ModelCars,34qifk,DrCockenstein,2,Thu May 7 01:45:03 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'm pretty sure this is the same set I've used. I'm just getting back into this after a five year break but this looks exactly like the Testors hobby films I had. Another site says the hobby films had the ultra fine as 600 grit not 2000 so maybe there was a disparity between these and ""real car"" sandpaper.  http://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=9SIA3NE2464351&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleMKP-Mobile&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleMKP-Mobile-_-pla-_-General+Crafts+%26+Accessories-_-9SIA3NE2464351&gclid=COnF0dbEr8UCFYgSHwodu0EASg&gclsrc=aw.ds  Also, I am really sorry if I came off as a condescending douchenozzle, the last thing I want to do is discourage a fellow hobbyist!"
ModelCars,34qifk,DrCockenstein,2,Thu May 7 11:41:27 2015 UTC,"You need a polishing kit, it comes with pads that range from 2,000 to 15,000 grit for removing the orange peel and then you finish up with polishing compound like Novus #2 or Mequiar's finishing wax and an old cotton tee shirt."
ModelCars,34qifk,SoundMerc,2,Sun May 3 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"You need to sand in stages. Start by getting the body clean and removing any flaws in the plastic. Maybe lightly sand it with 2000 grit if the plastic is really shiny or rough. After that:    lightly prime it with a fog coat let it dry sand 1500 wet fog it again let it dry sand 1800 wet fog it let it dry sand at 2000 wet   Do the same process for your color coat then clear coat. Don't sand so hard you go through the paint, just hard enough to knock it down. This takes practice so try it on junk plastic before you do it on a model. Eventually you should get a good feel for how much paint you need to spray in order to be able to sand without going through. It is a lot of trial and error.  When sanding use erasers as sanding blocks. You can cut them to any shape you need and you can staple the paper to the eraser to keep it from moving around. Avoid sanding without a block since you'll never get even pressure. Good, flat, even pressure on the paper gives the best results.  When you paint try to paint all parts separate if you can. It looks a lot better and it's easier to get to the hard to reach places if everything is separate. Blue tack and toothpicks are great for holding stuff and you can even glue toothpicks to not obvious areas to make stands for painting. Try to shoot everything at the same time to avoid mismatches in the paint. Multiple light to medium coats are always better than one heavy coat. Give gloss 24 hours to dry between coats, primer can be sanded after a few hours.  With this car if it's really bad I'd get some 1500 wet and sand everything down until the peel is gone and start again. The hood is getting there but you still need to remove any patches where the red still looks like orange peel. After you have it knocked down even start the pant process all over again."

I'm not sure if you can adapt one that will fit in a 1/24 scale trunk (I assume you're working in that scale). Have you considered building one into a diorama base, and ducting it to the back of the car?

For best results,  Use the Alclad black base coat, chrome, and clear. If you're rechroming parts, you won't be spraying over enamel.   Here are a couple of images of the Enzo I'm working on - these show the exhaust that was chromed with Alclad.

First, I'd strip off the old paint using oven cleaner or something like that.

Also, shoot a thin layer of gloss clear on the masked edges to prevent paint bleed, and start in light passes on those edges.  You might want to run an exacto blade across the edge of the tape after the paint dries, to keep the freshly painted stripe from peeling up with the tape when you remove it."
ModelCars,31k4j7,screamingcheese,1 point,Sun Apr 5 22:02:34 2015 UTC,Thanks! A semi related question. I bought some Testors metallic flake red paint and some neon blue paint.

ModelCars,31k4j7,RYDSLO,3,Sun Apr 5 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"Most likely, the cause was that you were applying a lacquer paint on top of an enamel paint, which is a no-no. The solvents in the lacquer paint do a great job of 'dissolving' an enamel coat."

He sells two types of paint. The basecoats, which require a clear coat over them to achieve a shine, and gloss acrylic enamels that go on glossy, no clear needed to be shiny. However, I've only worked with the basecoat styles. They're pretty easy to get good results with, provided you practice a bit. The clear coat will provide the final, smooth finish.   For the gloss acrylic enamels, you'll need to get a very smooth application to get a glossy finish, which I find to be more difficult. You can, of course, apply a clear coat over this as well to help with the final finish, perhaps after doing very light wet sanding to fix any small mistakes, etc.  In Gloss Acrylic Enamels (does not require a clear coat), they have two options. They have the 1969 Chevy Rallye Green Metallic (code 79). It's at the bottom of the page: http://www.scalefinishes.com/60chevy.html That page also has 1968 code J Rallye Green, but I think they are the same colors.

For instance, take the Ferrari California kits.  Their kit wheel measures out to be a 20"" rim (factory size is 19""), and the tires are both a bit narrow and too tall of profile, and it looks like they tooled the hub carriers to fit, making the car sit too high.

ModelCars,30r7n8,RobSpires,2,Mon Mar 30 00:42:08 2015 UTC,"Most people are familiar with the #3 Corvette C5-R shared by Dale Earnhardt and Dale Earnhardt Jr. amongst others in the 2001 Rolex 24 at Daytona. That car would go on to finish 4th overall. Its teammate, however, driven by Johnny O'Connell, Franck Freon, Chris Kneifel, and Ron Fellows took the overall victory by over eight laps. This win was especially impressive because it is one of the few times that a GT car has defeated a field of Prototypes to take the overall victory.   I've had this kit on my build list since it came out in 2002. I finally decided to take the plunge, and had planned on completing the build during this year's Rolex 24. Unfortunately, I ran into a number of setbacks that took me some time to find the motivation to overcome...   As I was working my way through the sub-assemblies and chassis, I was planning the praise I was going to give this kit. Everything fit very well and the build style was a departure from what I am used to from Revell. Unfortunately, when it was time for everything to go together in final assembly, nothing wanted to fit. The splitter was molded to the chassis pan, and when I went to put it together there was a huge gap between the body and splitter. It really ruined the look of the kit, so I cut the splitter loose from the chassis and glued it to the body.   Once I got that problem solved, I realized that the chassis didn't fit under the body. The result was a huge gap between the tops of the front tires and the bottom of the wheel wells. It almost looked like a gasser. Once again, unacceptable. To remedy this, I cut the mounting pins off the back of the rotors and mounted the tires much higher on the front spindle. This brought the front end back down to where I wanted it.   The body is finished in Tamiya Chrome Yellow with the kit decals (which were printed by Cartograf, but not as nice as their modern offerings). Some of you that are more familiar with the car might notice that I accidentally got the door numbers reversed. They are supposed to lean forward, not backward like the roof and hood numbers. I thought about trying to obtain another decal sheet to correct my mistake but I think I'm just going to live with it. All in all, I'm pretty happy with this build – especially considering the severity of the problems that came up. Now, on to the next one!  tl;dr: good kit, but part fit on final assembly sucks. Took some time to fix, but now I'm happy."

ModelCars,30ru7a,nlpnt,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:19:04 2015 UTC,Very nice!   I'd suggest stripping the chrome from the bumper/grille and wheels; I've never seen a C-series with chrome that wasn't either a fire truck or a Ford publicity photo.
ModelCars,30rg82,anustart221,2,Mon Mar 30 01:58:20 2015 UTC,Yeah.....removing mold lines is a basic. You also need flat black paint....for under the hood and stuff that should NOT be glossy. Take the flat blat black and finish painting the inside of the wheels. Also challenge your self and learn to use Bare Metal Foil. You are getting there! Keep on modelin'!!
ModelCars,30rg82,Gumderwear,2,Mon Mar 30 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"I just found out about the foil thing, looks pretty cool. I might try it next time"
ModelCars,30rg82,DrCockenstein,2,Tue Mar 31 04:29:20 2015 UTC,What kind of metallic red paint are you using? That color looks like what I need for a current project.
ModelCars,30rg82,DrCockenstein,2,Mon Mar 30 16:41:51 2015 UTC,I used Testor's Candy Apple Red spray paint over gold metallic.
ModelCars,30rg82,DrCockenstein,2,Tue Mar 31 04:17:58 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm working on a Snake Bite monster truck and have been trying to figure out how they got the gold/red look of the paint. This looks like a valid method. Did you clear it afterwards?
ModelCars,30rg82,2oonhed,2,Tue Mar 31 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"I did, but since I'm not into sanding and stuff yet it didn't have an amazing effect. The color layers were rougher so it didn't have a smooth finish to do the clear."
ModelCars,30rg82,Gumderwear,2,Wed Apr 1 04:14:35 2015 UTC,"Ya metallic is hard. I've done it on wheels and you basically get the prime smooth, put the metallic down, then cover it with a good coat of gloss if you want to sand it smooth."
ModelCars,30rg82,2oonhed,2,Wed Apr 1 04:19:40 2015 UTC,I thought all the Sunoco sponsored Penske cars were blue. And file that mold line off the exhaust pipe.
ModelCars,30rg82,Gumderwear,2,Mon Mar 30 08:27:37 2015 UTC,you got dv'd for this comment??
ModelCars,30rg82,2oonhed,2,Mon Mar 30 20:32:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I don't keep track of all the downvotes I collect from those that have not mastered their grownup words to express themselves. It's a lot, though. But was I wrong? Did the Penske group ever have a red 66 Corvette?"
ModelCars,30qpr5,RYDSLO,3,Sun Mar 29 22:04:22 2015 UTC,"How do you get the center portions black while retaining the chrome cross-hatch?   Use black acrylic paint and cover the whole piece, then wipe off the highest chrome to highlight. Like this:  '41 Chevy grille, before...  and after."
ModelCars,30qpr5,disgustipated,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:16:33 2015 UTC,What do you wipe with? Mineral spirits?
ModelCars,30qpr5,disgustipated,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:28:56 2015 UTC,"On the Chevy, I used acrylic and wiped it while it was still wet, then touched up any small goofs.  If you wait until it dries, just use a thinner that's compatible with your paint.  Here's an enamel job on photo-etch: before, after."
ModelCars,30qpr5,Gumderwear,2,Sun Mar 29 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"Disgusti is correct. If you have never done it before, I'd suggest you use a water based paint. If you use anything that can strip the chrome off....and you have any trouble getting it right.....you WILL strip some of the chrome plating off.  There is another way....but much more advanced. If you have a Dremel with a mini sanding drum bit....you can slowly and carefully sand the back side down to achieve a more realistic look. It actually becomes a ""grill""."
ModelCars,30qpr5,screamingcheese,2,Mon Mar 30 17:03:40 2015 UTC,"A good water-based option for something like disgustipated's suggestion is artist's watercolor, cut with a little bit of rubbing alcohol to break the surface tension."

ModelCars,30njtm,r1chard3,2,Sun Mar 29 07:10:41 2015 UTC,Yep. I use duplicolor automotive base and clear from spray cans. It would be even smoother if I polished it but I havent made that step with my builds yet.

ModelCars,30mbmv,RYDSLO,6,Sat Mar 28 18:11:31 2015 UTC,"If you want to put some effort into it, then pick up some Alclad II gloss black, chrome, and clear.  Spray a couple of coats of gloss black until it has a wet look shine, then lightly mist the chrome over it. When it starts getting reflective, you've sprayed enough.  A light buffing with a soft cloth will give it a mirror finish, and the clear will protect it.  Here's a recent post showing the Alclad process.  I don't have  pic of just the chrome - the headers were sprayed with transparent blue and transparent yellow after chroming them to simulate heat discoloration."

ModelCars,30mbmv,kirbyforlife69,2,Mon Mar 30 07:32:59 2015 UTC,"I think it looks better than chrome plating from the kit, if you do it right.   You have to be very careful to get a good chrome finish. These pointers might help:   After spraying gloss black and before the chrome, make sure it's perfect. Any imperfection will show through - fingerprints, tiniest bit of dust, anything. If it isn't a perfect gloss, it'll show. Spray light coats of chrome, very light mist coats over and over until it starts to reflect like a mirror - give it one more then stop. Let it dry overnight, then buff with a soft cloth. It will look like real chrome."
ModelCars,30mbmv,disgustipated,2,Mon Mar 30 13:37:23 2015 UTC,thanks you this will help me out. im into lowriders and these lowrider cars are full of chrome
ModelCars,30mbmv,kirbyforlife69,3,Tue Mar 31 10:10:44 2015 UTC,I'm no expert for car models but I hear that people like to airbrush Alclad or apply Bare Metal Foil. I've never tried them but they might be worth a look if you are into perfection. Good luck
ModelCars,30mbmv,trevticks,2,Sat Mar 28 18:24:14 2015 UTC,"I have the bare metal foil, but it isn't nearly as shiny as the chrome plating. Thanks for the input though, I likely just leave it as is."
ModelCars,30mbmv,trevticks,1 point,Sat Mar 28 18:34:53 2015 UTC,It looks pretty good just the way it is.  How do you like using the Bare Metal? I usually build WW2 Armour but I've been playing with cars
ModelCars,30mbmv,Gumderwear,2,Sat Mar 28 23:12:48 2015 UTC,"TBH, I've never used it. I just bought some today to do some detailing on this model, but I haven't actually used it yet, since I'm just starting on this one."
ModelCars,30mbmv,Gumderwear,2,Sat Mar 28 23:58:39 2015 UTC,Long time modeler here. I am always commenting on people leaving mold lines on their awesome finished kits. My eye ALWAYS goes to the mold lines.......so we do have a quandary with your question. I am pretty damn good with an Xacto to be able to remove that type of line on a chrome bumper and touch it up with paint or a small strip of Bare Metal Foil......but it still doesn't look all that good. In my experience you are better off leaving it alone and curse the model kit company that didn't think of a better way to mold that part.
ModelCars,30mbmv,clapforthewolfman420,2,Sat Mar 28 18:50:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Great to hear from someone who's tried it. This is my first model in a long time, so I'll likely take your suggestion and leave it be."
ModelCars,30mbmv,Grundy9137,2,Sat Mar 28 21:17:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah.....once the model is all done, it wont be that noticable. I once set some stuff out to be re-chromed due to issues like that and old parts that needed a sprucing up. Looked awesome, not worth the money involved though. Keep on Modelin'!"
ModelCars,30mbmv,kirbyforlife69,2,Sat Mar 28 21:36:21 2015 UTC,"The bumper above has a pretty apparent seam from the mold on the side. Clearly, sanding this down is not an option if I want to keep it chrome (which I do). I've already gotten it down a little bit with an xacto knife as best I can without making the chrome coating peel off too noticeably, but as you can see, the seam is still apparent. What do you guys do in these cases (or do you just live with it)?"

ModelCars,2z1xfc,anustart221,3,Sat Mar 14 20:30:30 2015 UTC,It looks like your laying it on too heavy.  Building up light coats with wet sanding in between will work.
ModelCars,2z1xfc,Low718,3,Sat Mar 14 23:34:05 2015 UTC,"Are you using enamel or lacquer?  There's definitely too much paint on the surface in your picture. That can be from holding the can too close, moving the can too slowly, or spraying too many wet coats.  Next time you paint, try first spraying a mist coat. The can should be at least 8 inches away from the surface. Shake it real good, and just spray a speckled pattern, not enough to cover the part.  Let this sit for 2-3 minutes, then spray your coats. The parts you've shown like the door panel would take about one second per pass, and three or maybe four passes to completely coat the part. Just keep spraying light, 1-2 second passes until the part is evenly covered, then stop.  Make sure you start and finish the pass off the part; if you push the nozzle while the can's pointed directly at the part, you'll get nasty results.  If you're using Testor's enamel - the ones with the crappy nozzles - then soak them in thinner to clean them. After soaking and putting it back on the can, hold the can upside down and press the nozzle for a couple seconds to help keep it clear."

ModelCars,2z1xfc,budra477,2,Sun Mar 15 00:40:45 2015 UTC,"Wow that looks terrible, have you primered the pieces before painting?  And you should rinse all your parts with soapy dishwater also before priming.  I agree with the light coats at first, just enough to cover it in a light coat.  Using a well lit area will help, you can use the reflection of the light to gauge how much paint your putting on.  You should also sand after each coat as well."
ModelCars,2z1xfc,cybexg,2,Sun Mar 15 00:17:55 2015 UTC,"You gotta use primer and hold the can way back from what your painting. Use dust coats, like for your first pass of color if you don't see primer still, that was too much paint. Gotta put on small amounts, let it dry, then add more.  Doing so also let's you fix mistakes in between coats."
ModelCars,2z1xfc,StuBeck,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:25:59 2015 UTC,so like a white primer before the silver? I try to do the dust coat thing but in this case I had to put on three coats because the paint didn't cover too well.

Accent peices are Flat Black.    This is the first model ive built in many years, I was hoping for a better turnout.  But this was the first time i tried to actually do a good job with the paint.  There was definitely a learning curve to the process.  I had lots of trouble with many things about this kit.  It always seemed like i was going forward and then took two steps back, because during final assembly a lot of peices did not want to fit like they were suppose to.    I ran into an issue where the fan clutch wanted to occupy the same space as the radiator.  Near as i could tell the motor was where it was suppose to be and the radiator was where it was suppose to be but it just didnt want to go together.  My solution was to drill out the back side of the radiator  enough for the fan clutch to have room.  Since you are never gonna see it i was ok with it.    The body was fun to paint, even though it took forever.  I learned a lot about what i can and cant do with an airbrush and that it is ok to use rattle cans.  The hood had to be redone three times, the first two times when i cleared it, when it dried the hood scoops looked like a dry lake bed, and i couldnt sand it out with haveing to redo the hood anyway.  The last attempt turned out pretty good i thought, much better then the body.  Lastly during final assembly, when the body was mated with the chassis, something was keeping the front of the chassis from mating with the body and i was damned if i was gonna pull it all apart again.  the result was that the front lower valance did not sit flush with the body because the chassis was protruding too far.  All in all, not bad for first attempt in a about 10 years.  Hopefully my next one will be better.  Hope you enjoyed! Thanks for looking!"

Regarding the Scotch-brite pads, they're just too coarse for plastic work - not sure which grade you're using, but the Maroon 7447 pad is about 320 grit. That's really coarse, the type of stuff you'd use for removing mold lines. Even the white pad at 1000 grit is the minimum you'd use on a finish.  For a glossy finish, you want to start at no coarser than 1500 grit for the surface, working your way through 2000-5000 grit before getting to the polishing stages that go up to 12,000 grit."

Any point I would be making is....anything with ""pad"" as it's description might not be the best choice. A cloth sanding sheet or a sheet of wet sand paper would be something to consider. It's a mini car. Treat it as such. I would think toothpaste would end up being a smoother finish over a ""pad"".   Glueing windows: Super glue will leave a white cloud ( look up fingerprints/superglue for all that info). Thin model glue CAN work with practise....but have patience and use an Elmers White Glue in moderate application.  The only problem with Elmers is: it doesn't really have staying power. I use tiny dots of Model Master thin model glue to hold clear parts.   Wheels and tires: eBay is a good source. Asking on Reddit subs is a good place.

ModelCars,2y5qlh,tryingtofindanswers,8,Fri Mar 6 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"I had the rare honor of touring the Tamiya factory many years ago as an exchange student in Japan.  The experience really stands out to me.  They had a showroom full of real cars including F1 and a Paris Dakar rallye Toyota that was still dirty and dripping oil on their carpet.  I remember the intricacies of their molding equipment and how modern the place was (1993).  One thing that stands out is our tour guide explained that sometime cars in real life don't scale down very gracefully and the designers sometimes have to take artistic license with the proportions to make the model look correct.  I don't know how any of this relates to your question but it's been a long time since I thought of Tamiya and I took a little trip down memory lane.  Also, their headquarters has dozens of flagpoles in front.  When we arrived they were flying the flags of many different nations.  As we departed they had gone out and taken down all of the flags except for the US and Japanese flags flying dead center next to each other.  It was a neat little bit of diplomacy."

ModelCars,2xkon1,Akira2007,4,Sun Mar 1 17:05:40 2015 UTC,one of my first completed builds with detail kits where I went all out. built in about one month on lots of evenings.  Found this subreddit and I thought I share it. :-)
ModelCars,2xkon1,stfurtfm,1 point,Sun Mar 1 17:08:15 2015 UTC,"Good work.. that's stellar.  When you want to glue something you've painted over, do you scrape with a knife or sand it off?    /r/gunpla would love to see your Gundams. ;)"
ModelCars,2xkon1,ceis_r,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:49:24 2015 UTC,depends on the size of the area to be glued. i use both ways small and thin I scrape big and wide I sand

ModelCars,2xkon1,Joey92LX,1 point,Sun Mar 1 21:36:54 2015 UTC,"You did an excellent job n should be very proud of your work.  I built this model also about 2 years ago after finding it on sale for $10.  Tamiya kits are great and all the parts fit perfectly with very minimal sanding or fitment issues.  Those decals were a headache but I took my time and used decal softener to help with the curves especially the front end area.  I was pretty happy with my build until I just saw yours.  Yours looks like it can actually be driven, I ended up making my own seat belts from bread twist ties, and added a few bits of wire to the inside here and there to make it look busy.  The only modification I made to the model was opening up the windows on the side (I used a Hotwire foam cutter to cleanly cut the plastic) , because I wanted the interior details to be seen better. I like this kid so much I went out and found the Ford Focus rally car kit and I'm almost done building that.  Once again you did an outstanding job post up more of your build ups please."

It is awesome from the box to the all of the sprues down to multiple angles of the finished product. Really well done! 2. What did you use to polish the metal paint and give it that steel polished look? I would definitely like to know a little more. If that would be too much work could you provide a link on how to get this effect. It looks marvelous on your model! Thank you for sharing your great work, it is really impressive!"

ModelCars,2xkelz,i_did_ur_mom,2,Sun Mar 1 15:47:48 2015 UTC,this one wasn't easy I took several firebird kits to get the parts I wanted. I wanted and 83 kit but there wasn't one with T-tops so I found an other kits that had the T-top plastic glass as a unit and cut the 83 kit to fit them. Then I used the TPI engine and rims from a 91 firebird kit to finish off the details I wanted.

ModelCars,2xlc1m,fmmike,5,Sun Mar 1 20:16:46 2015 UTC,I bought a jug of Super Clean at walmart. I soaked my parts in it for a few days. ( three I think). Then with an a good scrub with an old toothbrush and all the old paint came right off.  Here is the website I got the how to from http://www.dakkadakka.com/wiki/en/Dakka_Modeling_FAQ:_How_to_Strip...
ModelCars,2xlc1m,nowak1981,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"Super Clean is the way to go! I used it and it does not harm plastic, just let it soak for a couple days then take a tooth brush to it, might have to let it soak for another day after that.  If the item has clear coat on it, it will def take much longer, the Super Clean does not react with clear coat that well, but it will eventually seep into the paint underneath and let you get it cleaned up!"
ModelCars,2xlc1m,wolfencopter,2,Thu Mar 12 08:07:15 2015 UTC,Not sure if this has been mentioned (I'm new) DO NOT use brake fluid! It only works on lexan and will make styrene brittle and broken.
ModelCars,2xlc1m,wolfencopter,1 point,Thu Mar 5 12:53:25 2015 UTC,"It has not, but I'm glad you did because if there is anything I have plenty of its brake fluid."
ModelCars,2xlc1m,2oonhed,2,Thu Mar 5 17:54:18 2015 UTC,"In the event you need to remove paint from lexan, DOT4 or higher works very well. I mistakenly used it on a pretty rare Nissan hardbody and it just broke apart everywhere it could."
ModelCars,2xlc1m,rhs856,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:01:03 2015 UTC,Brake fluid is one of the few things I have around that I'll never use for off label purposes.
ModelCars,2xlc1m,Carlen67,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:23:11 2015 UTC,That's too bad. It worked great on some 1/25 scale polystyrene wheels I had. But wasn't the new DOT. It was Dot 3 or 4. Maybe there was a contaminant in your brake fluid that attacks plastics.
ModelCars,2xhk3i,disgustipated,3,Sat Feb 28 19:33:58 2015 UTC,Absolutely stunning! I've really enjoyed watching your build progress.

ModelCars,2xhk3i,labelsk8er85,1 point,Fri May 15 22:28:59 2015 UTC,Bare Metal Foil. Probably trashed 3x as much as I used.
ModelCars,2xhk3i,labelsk8er85,2,Fri May 15 22:30:08 2015 UTC,Oh yeah.   I've only attempted it once and gave up.  I will attempt again sometime.

ModelCars,2xjl9a,z71patt,2,Sun Mar 1 08:07:52 2015 UTC,Aoshima produces a line of pre-painted model kits that you have to assemble yourself. Here's Hobby Search listings for their pre painted models.
ModelCars,2xjl9a,ratchet050,2,Sun Mar 1 08:30:26 2015 UTC,"AMT puts out pre-painted bodies, and Lindberg has a line of kits with pre-painted bodies. Here's a link that should help."

ModelCars,2xiqk1,disgustipated,1 point,Mon Mar 2 09:40:23 2015 UTC,"Stagger your wire cuts like this and you'll find them much easier to work with. Other than that, yeah, it's tiny detail work that takes patience and a good set of tweezers... I mean a damn good pair, that can pick up a human hair. I use a pair of #10 titanium tweezers that I picked up from a jewelry/prospector's supply store. Here's a similar pair."
ModelCars,2xgacj,achimon,2,Sat Feb 28 10:52:36 2015 UTC,"Fujimi are decent, go with Tamiya if you can."
ModelCars,2xgacj,El_Suavador,4,Sat Feb 28 11:19:43 2015 UTC,"This, depending on what category you're looking for. Tamiya ranks #1 for me. Fujimi and Aoshima are good for Japanese imports.  If you're looking for hot rods or muscle cars, Revell and AMT are your best options, but quality is hit or miss.  It usually depends on the age of the mold used and if it's been re-tooled recently."
ModelCars,2xgacj,smashdupsanity,2,Sat Feb 28 12:10:21 2015 UTC,"Yup.  All the Japanese ones will be your best bet for quality.   Tamiya is kind of the benchmark for the average modeler, IMHO.  Aoshima and Fujimi will be your next probable options, and will give you a slightly wider range of cars.   Aoshima often will have more detailed kits with a greater number of parts.  Hasegawa may be slightly simpler in build.  The newer Revell kits are usually pretty good.   If you're looking for a much more detailed kit with a much higher price point, Model Factory Hiro.   Stay away from all the US kits - often of lesser quality."
ModelCars,2xgacj,blumenfe,1 point,Tue Mar 3 06:25:07 2015 UTC,"If you are only talking about fit, any one of the Japanese companies will be better than an American one, for the most part. I have also heard that Revell Germany puts out good stuff.   That being said, I could never build only Japanese models because there are car genres that interest me that are not in their catalog."
ModelCars,2xgacj,rhs856,1 point,Sat Feb 28 12:09:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe the Revell kits are from old tooling/molds, and that's why you had issues. I like AMT kits, but they really aren't in business anymore. I prefer 60's/70's American cars for the most part, so Revell and AMT....maybe old Lindberg kits are your only options. Tamiya and Fujimi kits are great....but pricey and limited with their selection. Revell Germany is also in that same boat....pricey and limited."

ModelCars,2xbh7n,SecondhandUsername,2,Fri Feb 27 13:10:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The trick to the badges is to wipe off all the glue after dabbing it on. I use a toothpick tip to put a teeny (smaller than tiny) drop of glue on the badge, then use the edge of the toothpick to sweep across the back of the badge essentially wiping it all off except a thin layer. This keeps it from oozing out the sides.  And the most important way to keep from screwing up - you only get one shot at application. I use a pair of titanium tweezers to position the badge, then drop it in place. If I mess with it after that, it screws up and gets goopy."
ModelCars,2xbh7n,SecondhandUsername,2,Fri Feb 27 14:41:25 2015 UTC,I am truly amazed at the skill that you demonstrate. I've seen very impressive builds at shows and I am often taken aback at the precision.
ModelCars,2xbh7n,DrCockenstein,2,Fri Feb 27 14:43:49 2015 UTC,"The thing that gets me is how tiny this crap is, especially the photo-etch. I try not to use magnifiers (they screw with my depth perception), so there's this ""quantum fuzziness"" level I hit when working on the extremely small - a point where I'm just guessing, or any screwups are going to be too tiny to see."

ModelCars,2x16bl,tryingtofindanswers,2,Tue Feb 24 21:07:37 2015 UTC,"More parts and smaller parts, mostly."
ModelCars,2x16bl,cdsbigsby,2,Wed Feb 25 01:36:16 2015 UTC,"There is no real consistent difference, sometimes the same kit will be rated differently one issue to the next. The difficulty of a kit has far more to do with fit than parts count. I've built Tamiya kits with a ton of parts and it basically feel together and fought a simple but dated kit every step of the way. Just get whatever kit you like and if it looks too challenging shelve it until you feel more confident in your skills, or give it a shot and push yourself. Don't be afraid to mess up a kit, they'll make more."
ModelCars,2x16bl,showmethebiggirls,2,Wed Feb 25 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I ignore the whole 'skill level' system, except to avoid any basic snap-together kits.  Some models are inherently harder to build due to their overall design, the age and treatment of the molds, et cetera.  Best bet is, look for reviews of the kit online, ask here about specific kits and see who's done one, and so on."

ModelCars,2wwf8r,TurnLeftRepeat,2,Mon Feb 23 22:28:44 2015 UTC,"My oldest brother[passed away in 2001] taught me from about 6-7 yrs old. By the time I was 14 I had built over 150 kits. I'm about to get back in soon. I saw a post in modelcars from a guy who was building a GTO. He has incredible skill...I'm going to have to knock a LOT of cobwebs off to even come close to him. He informed me MIchael's sometimes has 40% off coupons. Good place for kits in his age/skill set.  Help him all you can, teach him about cars later."
ModelCars,2wwf8r,TurnLeftRepeat,2,Tue Feb 24 00:04:27 2015 UTC,It was really fun working with him on it.  I am going to do a number of the snap together ones maybe one a month until he gets the hang of it and then he should be able to start doing some on his own.  Then we will move up to the next step.  Not only is it good for later and teaching about cars for now it is also really good at teaching patience and reading instructions.

ModelCars,2ws3uh,pastanazgul,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:59:02 2015 UTC,Would you suggest regular spray paint and clear coat in a spray bottle?
ModelCars,2ws3uh,Shock_and_Awwwwww,2,Sun Feb 22 21:01:24 2015 UTC,"Well, personally I use an airbrush, but the idea is the same. On the cheap, I'd do a rattle can primer, then sand, then rattle can main color, sand, main color, sand, then a coating of Future Floor Polish. It will give that glossy paint look. Test on some sprue first and see what works for you."

ModelCars,2ws3uh,z71patt,2,Sun Feb 22 21:05:16 2015 UTC,You'll be a lot happier with the result if you return the blue bottle paint and get spray primer and spray blue. Brush painting is fine for small parts but stick with the spray cans for the body.
ModelCars,2ws3uh,automatic_shark,1 point,Sun Feb 22 20:47:55 2015 UTC,So do you think I should get regular spray paint and use that to paint the body? I would clear coat that after.
ModelCars,2ws3uh,z71patt,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely, way easier than brush obtaining and the finished product will look a thousand times better. Google a little bit about spray painting models... There is definitely a technique and procedure to follow and you will need to get some fine sandpaper (check the auto part stores) but the result will make it worthwhile. It takes some finesse and practice but even the worst spray job will look better than your best brush job."
ModelCars,2ws3uh,NoGoddamnNamesLeft,2,Mon Feb 23 05:40:45 2015 UTC,Wait that kit comes with engine stand? Guess I know what I'm getting next. Also I personally dislike testors glue. I use Mercury M300M glue. ALSO glue doesn't work well on paint. Make sure you scrape paint off areas you want to glue together
ModelCars,2ws3uh,Shock_and_Awwwwww,2,Sun Feb 22 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, and judging from the directions, it seems to come with a second engine so one can be in the car and the other can be displayed.   I was also wondering if you have to glue every part together or if some don't need glue. Does every part you put on need to be glued, or do some stay in place without it?"
ModelCars,2ws3uh,NoGoddamnNamesLeft,2,Sun Feb 22 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure about AMT models in particular, but most instructions well tell you if it shouldn't be glued, otherwise, glue it up. Before you apply glue though, always test fit the pieces dry, just to make sure it fits properly, and if you need to sand down or fill in some pieces."

ModelCars,2ws3uh,DarqueChocolade,1 point,Sun Feb 22 22:39:24 2015 UTC,You'll need glue. I think Revell makes a couple semi truck kits that mostly snap together which is cool. But yeah the car you have is an old kit you can find the mold date on the chassis somewhere. Most of them are 20/30 years old.
ModelCars,2ws3uh,darahia,2,Sun Feb 22 23:38:46 2015 UTC,"I built this not too long ago. Its typical T, a lot of flash and cleanup and.poor fit with a lot of pieces, but i t can make a really nice model with patience. The particular issues I had was with the headers and the position of the engine. TEST FIT BEFORE PAINTING. Use super glue to tack pieces together for test fitting, or tape where you can. Make sure the engine fits properly in the engine bay with the headers on, and make sure it is positioned correctly so the hood closes all the way  As for the paint, I cant tell if its lacquer or enamel. Enamel takes a week or so to completely dry, lacquer will dry overnight.  I.forget the rules, but there are rules to painting. No lacquer over enamel..so if you paont the body with enamel, then use a lacquer clearcoat, you'll ruin it"

ModelCars,2w5er0,RobSpires,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:58:55 2015 UTC,Thanks! It was a Revell kit that I found at Michael's. I have some Testors spray cans that I use. I got them from my grandfather after he passed away in 2010 so they might be old or something. Here's some pics: http://imgur.com/a/GQCGo
ModelCars,2w5er0,RobSpires,2,Tue Feb 17 03:08:57 2015 UTC,"I suspected you were using Testors. I don't think the age of the paint is the problem as much as Testors' nozzles. They seem to get clogged and ""spit"" paint once you've used the can a time or two. That creates pretty bad orange peel. I've had some luck laying down thicker coats of paint, but then you get into runs or drying time issues... I've thought about popping the nozzles off and putting them in a Tupperware of thinner after each use, but I've never tried it.  I would recommend trying to find cans of Tamiya paint if possible. It is a little more expensive, but the quality is much, much better. Any well-stocked hobby shop should have it, or you can google it.  If you're stuck with the Testors, you can try wet sanding/polishing to get a smoother finish. /u/disgustipated posted an excellent tutorial here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ModelCars/comments/2w0wmf/wip_revell_125_1966_pontiac_gto_chassis_and_part/"
ModelCars,2w5er0,RobSpires,2,Tue Feb 17 03:24:10 2015 UTC,I also just noticed that you used flat red paint. Starting with a gloss paint should help your clear coat shine a little better.

ModelCars,2w0wmf,TurnLeftRepeat,4,Mon Feb 16 15:10:53 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Here's the rest of the WIP thread:   First Post Engine and Body Prep Engine Detail Body Paintwork   Let me know if you have any questions.
ModelCars,2w0wmf,DrCockenstein,3,Mon Feb 16 15:24:20 2015 UTC,"Your paint looks like real paint?!?!? Do you only sand in one direction, then apply clear, then sand in the other, then apply clear, then polish? It would be nice to know your steps to get that finish."
ModelCars,2w0wmf,DrCockenstein,6,Mon Feb 16 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"Here it is, in excruciating detail:  After prepping the body (fixing seams, etc, then washing), I spray with Tamiya fine coat primer, then lightly sand with 2000 grit, sanding the length of the body.  Then, I spray a speckled mist coat, let it sit for about 2 minutes, then an even color coat. I use the Testor's Model Master spray cans for all body paint.  I let the coat sit for a day, then I spray a second coat of color. After several day's worth of drying time, I sand the color coat lightly with 3000 and 5000 grit 3M Trizact (it's a foam-backed auto body sanding pad) - Each sanding pass is 90 degrees from the last - so if the first pass is the length of the body with 3000, then the second is across the body with 5000. This levels out the paint and removes the orange peel. I don't get carried away with the color coat - it's the clear coat polishing that gives it the shine. In fact, the color looks dull when I'm done.  After washing off the dust with an 90/10 mix of water/iso alcohol (this also helps reduce static), I hit it with a coat of clear, as heavy as I can without getting drips or pools. I let this dry for a day, then do it again (btw, I don't sand at all between 1st and 2nd coats, except to remove booboos and dust).  With 2 thick coats of clear, it's time to level it and polish. Again, I hit it with 3000 & 5000 trizact (next time I'll add 2000 grit - I didn't get the surface as level as I wanted).  And yes, again I offset subsequent passes 90 degrees. The idea is that you'll spend less time sandng if you go across the previous scratches instead of with them.  A note on sanding - I look at it like there's 3 stages: Cutting, Leveling, and Polishing - cutting is fixing surface features, done before any paint. Leveling is to remove texture from the paint surface, and polishing is just sanding with smaller and smaller scratches until things start to shine.  After the sanding/leveling passes, I start to polish, using polishing pads of 4000, 6000, 8000, and 12000 grit.  By the time I've made all the passes (again, 90 deg offset after each one), the body takes on a nice shine.  From there, I use the Novus polishing system, starting with #3 for heavy scratches, which is done directionally. The #2 polish for fine scratches is then applied, first against the scratches from #3, then a second time in a wax-type swirl pattern.  Finally (and you don't see this in the GTO shots - I haven't reached this stage yet), I use Novus #1, which is a silicone-based wax. That gives it the super-slick surface, like wax on a 1:1 car.  I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions."
ModelCars,2w0wmf,TurnLeftRepeat,2,Mon Feb 16 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"That's perfect, thank you. I'm using Model Master spray cans for color as well so this is super helpful."
ModelCars,2w0wmf,TurnLeftRepeat,2,Mon Feb 16 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"If you're not getting paid by model companies to build, you should be. I have built around 2-300 cars in my life. I consider my skills really good...but your work is truly awesome. My last finished build was about 5-6 yrs ago. Built a 3rd Dragula, I'm about 40% done with the Munsters Coach...lost motivation on the interior. Had plasma cell leukemia [bone cancer] a couple years ago, thankfully been clear for over a year[knock on head] but some of the meds left me with a teeny bit of hand tremor. Which as you know is incredibly frustrating doing detail work. But I'm going back in. Got AMT Ohio George's '33 Willys Malco Gasser last year. Need to get a couple paints and get the cobwebs off.

ModelCars,2w0wmf,TurnLeftRepeat,1 point,Mon Feb 16 16:36:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, really.  I just got back into it last year, this is my second ""serious"" build, where I'm customizing the engine and interior to this level.  I grew up in the 60's/70's and built tons of funny cars, dragsters, and customs like the Cherry Bomb, but they were covered with glue drips, crappy paint and torn decals. Didn't matter much, since most ended up on the wrong end of a firecracker attack. :)  Most of what I've learned in the last year came from this forum, /r/modelmakers and Scale Auto magazine. I'm looking forward to finishing the GTO so I can contemplate the next build.  And, if there are any model companies hiring, I'm interested. :)"
ModelCars,2w0wmf,TurnLeftRepeat,2,Mon Feb 16 16:43:36 2015 UTC,"Send them photos of the GTO build. If they don't ask to pay you, they're retarded. I too did my majority of my building during the 70's. All of Tom Daniels' customs, funny, drag, stock car, F1, etc.  My mom used to work for monogram, which sadly didn't benefit me[too little then] but was seriously great for my oldest brother. Luckily he passed that skill set to me. [he is gone now]  Firecracker attack...lmao. You're killing me. If it's okay, can I ask how you'd go about painting the Munster's Coach interior/exterior? Mainly I'd like an opinion on which area to paint sequentially in regards to the actual body. Not the tub portion. I can send a more detailed inquiry."
ModelCars,2w0wmf,Djprotege,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm.... regarding the body, based on the images I found, it looks like the interior body panels were red, like the seats. After priming everything, I'd first mask everything that's not going to be red - the entire body except the interior - then spray the red on the interior panels. If it's too glossy, a coat of dullcoat will soften the look.  Give it a couple of days to dry, then reverse the masking, covering up all the red and leaving the soon-to-be black portion exposed.  From there, a couple of coats of gloss black, sanded level, followed by two coats of gloss clear, then sanded and polished. It's pretty much the same steps (and colors!) I did on the GTO.  I left the interior masked until I was past sanding and polishing the exterior, in order to keep dust/polishing compound, etc from screwing up the red.  If you want, start a new post in /r/modelcars, and we can go back and forth discussing technique there. :)"
ModelCars,2w0wmf,RobSpires,2,Mon Feb 16 17:30:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the 'which steps, in what order' that took my motivation last time.

Here's one example, showing the yellow, window frames, etc. The only thing omitted will be the door decal/painting.

The engine in this build is box-stock. All detail was done with paint.  If you google the car, and look for specific pictures, you can get an idea as to the color and placement of the under-hood components.

Also you need to make sure any glossy paint sets up for a full 24 hours @ 75 degrees before you handle it. If your room is cooler it needs more setup time.  The paint should be very, very hard to wipe off once it's applied so I'm worried you're using the wrong sort of paint or not prepping correctly. Make sure everything is washed, sand and prime large areas, wipe everything down with a tack cloth between coats, and use gloves to stop finger oils and paint should work fine.

ModelCars,2tknuk,dino123,1 point,Thu Jan 29 14:00:12 2015 UTC,"Yep - I use it to keep the dust off while the paint dries. I live in a very dry climate and constantly battle dust due to static electricity. Sometimes it get so bad I've seen glue jump an inch off a toothpick and stick to the nearest plastic body part.  Best remedy I've found so far is an 80/20 mix of water/alcohol in a spray bottle. After rubbing the plastic with sandpaper, it's built up quite a charge (like rubbing a balloon), a few squirts of the anti-static spray and a wipedown with a microfiber cloth reduces the static to a tolerable level.  I'm just getting back into the hobby as well. Hit me up if you have any more questions."
ModelCars,2tef95,Gavin_S,7,Fri Jan 23 13:16:59 2015 UTC,"Bare Metal Foil: welcome to the world of frustration and hate. Then love once you figure it out. First, it will tear when you first learn. As /u/screamingcheese mentioned, your x-acto blade needs to be sharp sharp sharp. Don't push down; let the weight of the blade do the cutting (that's how sharp it needs to be).  It's easier at first to cut straight strips instead of trying to match complex curves, but at the same time, don't try to do an entire window opening with one piece. I'd do the bottom first, then the sides, then the top, blending the foil but not layering more than you need to cover the seam. I'm at a 2:1 ratio - two attempts for every one good piece I lay down. Used to be 4:1 but I'm getting better. At some point I'll get it right the first time and call myself an expert, but until then, I plan on waste and cussing.  As for paint, this is what I've put most of my time into when it comes to learning technique.  First, you can get an awesome finish from a spray can - airbrush not needed yet. Here's how I'd approach it:   Purchase 3 spray cans for your body: one each of primer, color, and clear coats. I prefer the Testor's Model Master Lacquer paints and Tamiya Fine Surface Primer. Purchase sandpaper - you'll need it for three purposes: shaping, leveling, and polishing. Shaping is the coarse stuff, 150 - 600 grit. Leveling is taking out the scratches from shaping (pre-paint) and leveling out the orange peel (post-paint). Polishing is 4000-6000 grit and above, and is used to remove the scratches from leveling until your finish shines. At that point, you can move to polishing creams and waxes if you wish. You can get ""kits"" of sandpaper, such as 150, 320, 600 for shaping, or 4000, 6000, 8000, 12000 for polishing (yes, there's some overlap in the grits - practice and experimentation will tell you what works best for you). Have a place to paint that's as dust-free as possible. Room temperature is best. You can build a cheap paint booth out of a cardboard box, a vent fan, and dryer exhaust hose, or pick up an $80 booth off Amazon. Have a place for your parts to dry that's also dust free and covered. I use an upside-down big plastic tub, and set it on blocks so it can vent.  When you finish painting, put it under the cover and don't touch it for twice as long as it takes to dry! Seriously. If it's a 2-hour lacquer, wait 4 hours before handling. If you have white cotton gloves, even better. Don't touch the flat surfaces of a freshly painted piece with bare hands, it will leave fingerprints, and you'll have to deal with those before your clear coat. If you have a problem with static electricity causing dust to stick to the model, don't worry, it's normal in dry climates. I've had drops of glue jump a full inch off a toothpick from static. It sucks. If you think about it, what we do to prepare a surface creates tons of static, rubbing back and forth like it was a balloon on your little brother's head. :)  Never fear, there's a great solution, literally: mix 80% alcohol (I use isopropyl, some recommend rubbing) and 20% water, put it in a spray bottle, and mist both sides of the part, then wipe dry with a microfiber cloth. That should eliminate most of the static without affecting the finish.   Okay, now it's time to sand and paint (we're talking about the body now; small parts are similar and easier usually). Sanding is progressive;  you start with the coarse grits and work towards fine. Use the shaping grits to remove flash, parting lines, and other molding errors in the body, then use the leveling grits to smooth out the scratches. I use 1500, 3000, and 5000 for leveling. I just started using the 3M Trizact Foam Sheet. Whatever you use, cut the sheets into small squares, and sand back and forth (not circular, that's for buffing).   So, you take the body, sand down imperfections, then sand smooth the areas you sanded, then sand the entire body with 3000/5000 for a uniform surface. Wash and dry the body to remove the sanding dust. Now it's time to apply the primer. Shake well, apply an even coat over the entire body, and let dry. Spraying tip: if you get a speckled, uneven finish you're holding the can too far away; if you get fisheyes and bubbling, and details disappear, you're holding it too close. Optimum is about 8-10 inches, but it takes practice to get it right. And, different colors require minor technique adjustments.  Once the primer has dried, give it a light sanding with 3000-5000 grit to level out any rough places in the primer. Now apply your color coat (after wiping down/washing the model again - always clean after sanding). You want to hit it with ""mist coats"" first, intentionally spraying from too far away to get a light speckled mist on the body. Let this dry for 2-3 minutes, then give it normal coats from 8-10 inches. Always, ALWAYS, start and stop spraying off the surface, never push the nozzle when it's pointing at the part.  Give it two passes, make sure everything's covered, put it in your drying rig and let it sit overnight, then give it a second coat (no mist coat this time). Now, let it sit for at least 3 days in your drying rig. You want it to cure as much as possible before sanding.  If you look at it in the light, you'll notice a texture to the surface. You want to smooth it out like glass. Lightly use 3000-5000 grit to level the paint. You'll have some minor scratches, and the whole body will have a matte finish when you're done. This is okay, that's what the clear is for. Apply the clear using the same technique, 8-10 inches, full coverage, no mist coat. Let it sit for a day, give it a second coat, let that dry, then it's time to level one more time, then polish.  Gently sand until the imperfections are smoothed down with the rest of the paint. Wash/dry, then start with at least 4000 or 6000 grit, and work the entire body. From there, you'll go to 8000 and 12000 grit. By the time you're done, the finish should be pretty reflective. Now, you can be happy with it, or go for polishing compounds to really give it a mirror finish.  Be careful about sanding through the paint. If you're polishing the clear coat, watch your media for the appearance of color - that means you sanded completely through the clear. Don't sand corners and edges; they'll get enough abuse as you sand the adjacent surface area. If you do sand through the paint, touch it up with a paint pen or tiny brush and let dry before continuing.  Finally, a nice model wax (carnauba or silicone) can be applied.  I'm sure I left some things out, so if you have any questions, let me know."
ModelCars,2tef95,disgustipated,2,Fri Jan 23 15:38:58 2015 UTC,Most impressive reply thanks pal. Lots of good info there. Have just purchased an airbrush from ebay this morning lol. Had to get a water trap and adaptor cable for my compressor. Got a big beasty in my garage I use for working my car's air tools. Not sure on what paints to get but I do have a big model fair close to me this weekend so will be able to pick up shed loads for pretty cheap.  Also got a dremmel I hope to use for polishing. Love car detailing so got a load of polish and a random orbit machine so hoping a little experience in this area may help me.  Would also like to learn how to use foam for making things like the seats for wrapping in felt and little additional bits like radio etc. The little details seem to make the best cars.  What glue's should I be picking up. Only used poly cement or super glue and seem to get a lot of over gluing areas. Possible due to big brush in my glue tub.
ModelCars,2tef95,disgustipated,1 point,Fri Jan 23 15:51:42 2015 UTC,"I like this glue because of the tiny applicator, it's like a syringe needle. But you have to scrape any paint or finish off the mating surfaces. Superglue works for most everything else, but apply with a toothpick, and put on less than you think you'll need.  For details, check out the various photo-etch kits available. You can get generic ones like this seat belt hardware or radio faces, or ones specific to a model kit, like this Camaro upgrade kit."

ModelCars,2tc101,kers_equipped_prius,5,Thu Jan 22 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"First, I'd pick up that and one or two more models. Start with the others for practice. You'll find by your third model, you'll have mastered techniques that screwed up the first couple.  In a nutshell, you'll first prep all your parts by removing manufacturing defects like parting lines (seams) and pin marks. Then you prime everything to be painted, then you paint and assemble. Sometimes it's better to build in subassemblies before painting; depends on the kit.  Key things - take your time, test fit, have rubber bands or clamps to hold your parts together while they dry (and don't mess with them until dry!), thin your paints (a little for brush painting, a lot for airbrush), you can get really good finish results from spray cans, old VGA cables make great sources for tiny wire (for spark plugs, brake lines, etc), etc.  You'll want a #11 X-Acto hobby knife and spare blades, Tenax or Testor's Model Master glue, a good CA glue (superglue), maybe some putty for fixing and filling in parts, sandpaper in grits from 150-2000 for shaping/cutting/leveling and 2400-12000 for polishing, a pair of good tweezers - REALLY good tweezers (look at these - the bottom pair are $20 titaniums, the top $4 steel - that tip difference means I can pick up a human hair with the titanium ones, something you'll do as soon as you find that dog/cat hair in your fresh paint!), some paint brushes and paint (you can start with a Testor's or Tamiya selection, they sell some as kits with the basic colors), an airbrush if you want to get serious (they can be had for <$200 with brush and compressor), some small clamps and alligator clips, masking tape, white glue (for clear pieces), etc etc etc.  Digest this and come back with questions, we'll be glad to help!"

ModelCars,2tc101,Kiz74,2,Fri Jan 23 00:55:27 2015 UTC,Gonna stop you right there bud.  VGA cable is good for bigger tubes on 1/24 1/25 for sparks /ht leads you will need thinner wire.
ModelCars,2tc101,disgustipated,1 point,Thu Jan 22 23:28:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on the gauge of the wire in the cable, Kiz. This is what I'm referring to - on the left is a Parts by Parks pre-wired distributor, sitting next to one wire from a VGA cable. I did have to go through a box of old cables and find the right brand that uses the thinner gauge wire."

ModelCars,2tb2d9,Kiz74,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm... so, you need something like this?  Do you have any local hobby shops? They can often special order things like this as part of their regular orders so you don't get hit with exorbitant shipping charges.  Another option is to find a kit or dig out an old kit that has a battery molded to the car. Dress it up and paint it, even the stock battery can look real."

ModelCars,2tb2d9,disgustipated,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:23:47 2015 UTC,"Get a battery dress up kit if you can - the stock 'cuda battery in the previous pic uses terminal post connectors as well as positive and negative cables.  For carpet, you'll want flocking. You can get it in many different colors, both from model/hobby shops as well as craft shops. I used Martha Stewart flocking in Chestnut to do this carpet.  Color-wise, what color are you doing for the body? Here's a chart of exterior and interior colors for 1968 Mustangs. Looks like the interior was only Black or Saddle."
ModelCars,2tb2d9,disgustipated,1 point,Thu Jan 22 22:24:45 2015 UTC,I can get the flocking but as i said I seem to be drawing a big blank on the battery.  If anyone can point me in the direction of a European supplier as the only ones I can find with it in stock are in the us and a set of 2 resin battery kit will set me back about £25.

ModelCars,2t7j1g,cggzilla,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:25:16 2015 UTC,Pictures say a thousand words. If it's anything like other Japanese car kits it'll have pretty simple front shock/brake setups. If you cuts off where the wheels mounts on to that and glue it a bit further up the shock assembly youll get it lower.
ModelCars,2t7j1g,5yj,0,Thu Jan 22 00:46:55 2015 UTC,"I do not believe that is possible for this kit as the suspension and brakes are separate parts, where the brake connects to the sub frame or whatever and the shock is connected to the same part, here is a thread on a build of the same model for reference if it helps; http://scaleplasticcars.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=13120&view=previous"

ModelCars,2t36n7,Djprotege,3,Tue Jan 20 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"I made a spray box out of a plastic box/tub from home Depot ($7) and a washroom box fan ($18 or so)  and see extendable metal vent tubing (maybe $10,it can be extended). I also threw in a furnace filter to pick up all the paint particles. I then cut a hole in the bottom of the box and put the fan there. It works extremely well, the suction power is pro ably 10x better than the expensive spray boxes you buy elsewhere.

Unless it's something rare or special, most model kits won't fetch anywhere near their original retail price. For example, the Revell Enzo Ferrari on Amazon is $22, but this one sold on eBay for $15 ($7.99 + shipping).  Rare and vintage kits, however, can bring in a pretty penny. This MPC 1971 Dodge Demon sold for $250. This MPC Sox & Martin Duster sold for $150.  BTW, if you happen to have an original MPC Arlen Vanke Pro Stock Duster, I'll give you $3.50 for it. :)"

I have facepalmed many times from people asking crazy high prices for kits that build into ugly models, just because they have a fancy decal set which makes them rare. Ebay and amazon is a good place to start. if the kits are fairly new and still available from stores as new kits, use that as a good guide, since noone want to pay more for a pre-owned kit, even if it's unopened, when you have an option to buy it from a store, brand new"

ModelCars,2sjyso,notaspookorgook,1 point,Fri Jan 16 02:26:18 2015 UTC,Did you have to sand the mold lines down on the Revell?
ModelCars,2sfne7,Kiz74,3,Wed Jan 14 20:00:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, micro set is for initial application, and micro sol is for softening the decal.  You can use the water that you softened the decal with for setting (instead of micro set); helps to add a drop of dish detergent like Dawn to reduce the water's surface tension do the decal doesn't ""float"" on top.  Micro Sol is the stuff, boy. After you position your decal, use the corner of a paper towel to suck the excess water off (capillary action FTW), then use a brush to dab Micro Sol on the decal. Don't wipe it off, the decal can/will tear if messed with at this point. Let it dry, and apply again if necessary to get the decal to lay across any uneven surfaces. The woodgrain decals in these shots took about five applications of Micro Sol to get them to conform to the surfaces. Just takes patience and a soft touch with the brush so you don't push the decal around."
ModelCars,2sfne7,disgustipated,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:00:53 2015 UTC,"Don't mean to high jack this fellows post, but I was wondering if the dash gauges were decals also, and if not, what method did you use to paint them. Excellent work BTW"
ModelCars,2sfne7,MyKarmaKilledURDogma,2,Thu Jan 15 16:27:34 2015 UTC,"They're decals that go on the back of a clear piece of plastic, which is then glued from behind the dash."
ModelCars,2sfne7,disgustipated,2,Thu Jan 15 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I figure they were either decals, or you had the hands of a surgeon, and the eyes of an eagle."
ModelCars,2sfne7,MyKarmaKilledURDogma,2,Thu Jan 15 17:29:20 2015 UTC,"Yes and yes. One softens the decals more than the other (I think Sol is the stronger one), but you can reapply as much as you need to get the look you want.  Edit: I seem to remember hearing that you can use a vinegar solution to do essentially the same thing, but I haven't tried it."
ModelCars,2sf7pg,Murva,5,Wed Jan 14 18:01:27 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to remove paint or plating from parts before gluing is to scrape the spot with an X-Acto #11 razor knife. Be patient and take your time, you can get all the paint off.  Second, when you use your Testor's cement, apply it with a toothpick, and use less than you think you'll need. Amazing that it won't hold two painted parts together, but if you get it on paint it'll take that right off. :)  You can use CA (superglue) as well. I use Testor's Model Master cement (love the applicator) for most plastic-to-plastic, and CA for plastic to metal or rubber, as well as for when I need a faster drying time or if I just can't scrape off the finish.  Finally, you have to leave it be while it cures. Model cement works by melting the styrene. Cover the surface of one part with glue, attach the other part, wipe away any excess that squeezes out, then clamp it or wrap it with a rubber band and don't touch it for at least 5-10 minutes.  Moving the parts during curing will ruin the bond."
ModelCars,2sf7pg,disgustipated,3,Wed Jan 14 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"That was really informative, thank you for the response. I'm gonna try some of this out and see how it goes"
ModelCars,2sf7pg,datcivicdoe,1 point,Wed Jan 14 23:04:18 2015 UTC,I use superglue almost exclusively.  It doesn't take much and it's a real strong bond.  The cement never worked for me.
ModelCars,2sf7pg,RobSpires,2,Thu Jan 15 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"I always use a liquid glue (Tanax is preferred) for sub-assemblies where I glue bare plastic to bare plastic. I use cheap dollar store super glue for gluing painted together, and I use Elmer's white glue to glue windows in.  The super glue is cheap and strong. Just be careful not to stick yourself to your part."
ModelCars,2sf7pg,Stoga,1 point,Wed Jan 14 19:41:02 2015 UTC,"I'll give super glue a chance tomorrow, I was considering it, but didn't know how it would go"
ModelCars,2sf7pg,rhs856,3,Wed Jan 14 23:03:20 2015 UTC,"Have to be careful what you use super glue on, it can leave a mist on clear or chromed plastic."
ModelCars,2sf7pg,blumenfe,2,Thu Jan 15 04:46:06 2015 UTC,May I recommend finding some applicator tips to help limit the amount of glue. You can also find them on amazon or in most hobby stores.
ModelCars,2s7q7a,Djprotege,4,Mon Jan 12 22:30:43 2015 UTC,"I honestly think you'd be better off to buy a subscription to Scale Auto Magazine and a couple of models. The book may have some good tips, but you're still going to have to learn by doing, and a book can't teach you that."

ModelCars,2s7q7a,Gumderwear,2,Mon Jan 12 23:58:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, save yourself the $60. I recently picked up the hobby 2 years ago (currently not to active due to a recent move and haven't set up my new workbench yet) but learned everything from researching on the internet, picking up a copy of Scale Auto Mag every now and again, and would ask questions at local hobby shops. They love to talk about bettering your builds and from my experience, seem to be quite happy to share their personal tips and tricks. Don't get me wrong I'm sure the book is probably a great read, but you could also buy 3-5 models for that price and learn on your own. Isn't that what's it's all about?!"

For example, one of the many other projects I would love to do is I have this Transformer that I got from somewhere and I want to disassemble it and strip it and repaint it as a Chicago police car (I'm from chicago) but it's also some weird scale lamborghini that I'd have to make custom labels for and different tires and rims, it's all a bit of a pain-BUT if I were building a 1/8 model, I'd be fine.

ModelCars,2r0smn,disgustipated,1 point,Fri Jan 2 02:09:22 2015 UTC,"Really, really nice work. Are the doors/trunk functional, or did you scribe them?  Bare Metal Foil is my favorite thing to hate in modeling right now, but I'm learning."
ModelCars,2r0smn,NueDumaz,2,Thu Jan 1 18:44:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The trunk is a separate piece. The doors just have a deep scribe line. I didn't do anything to it.  I build primarily modern stock cars, so I don't get to use a lot of Bare Metal Foil in my building. I've always seemed to have a knack for it though. Someday I'm going to build a 57 Chevy or something just so I can foil it out! :)"
ModelCars,2r0smn,peedeearr,1 point,Thu Jan 1 20:32:46 2015 UTC,"What color/type of blue did you use? Is it the light or are the wheels a different shade? Nice job, by the way."
ModelCars,2r0smn,NueDumaz,2,Thu Jan 1 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's Model Master 2964 Grabber Blue. I think it's a little too dark though. The wheels are painted the same color, though Petty often painted ""bolt-ons"" (Suspension, engine parts, wheels) a dark blue, so it's possible that the car may have run that way. I decided to go by the box art."
ModelCars,2r0smn,peedeearr,1 point,Thu Jan 1 23:29:26 2015 UTC,"The cars changed often, even week-to-week in those days due to damage/local sponsors/contingencies, so there's no real 'right' replica of the Petty car or any short track car."

ModelCars,2r0smn,alexx138,1 point,Thu Jan 1 22:57:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's a cool kit but it has some shortcomings. There is a lack of positive mounting points for most pieces, so you just have to use your best guess. I especially had trouble with the rear bumper and roll pan. I finally got it all stuck together, but it is a bit unsightly in spots. Also, the treadwidth on the front wheels is wider than the rears. They will need to be brought in a tough to look even. I wish I had fixed that on mine. You can kind of see it in the overhead pic."

Also, press <ENTER> twice to define paragraphs. Great post! I hope someone has more answers than me. :)]  Hello fellow model car builders and collectors!  I had three questions. I'm into modifying 1:18 scale cars and had a few questions involving the hobby. I've seen really nicely modified 1:18 scale die casts. I was wondering where do people get custom 1:18 scale wheels? I've found some online, but they're usually drag racing and muscle car wheels. I'd like something that's more of European or Japanese. I'm really into the whole stanced car and hellaflush scene and was wondering where I could get nice wheels like that?   My next question; how do people make custom decals? From my understanding, people simply get the design or whatever they want as a decal, and re-size it, then print onto label paper or vinyl. Is that pretty much it?   Lastly, how do people make custom parts such as roof racks for cars?   Thank you for your time! If you have anything to help, please comment!"
ModelCars,2qvldq,disgustipated,3,Wed Dec 31 16:12:22 2014 UTC,So that's why... My apologies and thank you for fixing it. Never knew why that would happen.
ModelCars,2qvldq,disgustipated,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:16:20 2014 UTC,"1) Man, good luck. I did some quick searching but didn't find anything. You might try contacting Pegasus Hobbies (the company that makes the sweet modern 1/24 rims) and see if they have anything in different scales.  2) Ah, custom decals. Get yourself some of this stuff (that's white background, they also sell clear - remember, 99% of printers don't print white), it works great. Make sure you apply a fixative over the decal after printing. And yes, you get your art ready in photoshop or another image editor, size it correctly, print it out, and decals!  3) Custom parts are usually made from styrene stock, brass stock, or scrap parts. It's pretty amazing what you can do with a flame and some scrap sprue. Take a look at the recent Scale Auto magazine, where they built a pair of Revell 'cudas. The builder made a custom luggage rack for the trunk out of styrene rod; really nice work."
ModelCars,2qvldq,NueDumaz,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:18:28 2014 UTC,"Sweet, thanks a lot for the help. Kinda sucks, I find a lot of the stuff I'm looking for, but it's always for muscle/NASCAR/american cars. Never euro or Japanese. But thanks for the help!"
ModelCars,2qvldq,cggzilla,1 point,Wed Dec 31 17:25:43 2014 UTC,"I've had the same problem with 1/18 scale wheels and tires. Lots of stuff for off road RC buggies, but none for scale classic race cars.  You might consider looking into resin casting. I have successfully cast small parts in epoxy too.      Your other option is to turn your own wheels on a mini lathe or drill press out of aluminum or resin blanks.     Nothing is impossible."

ModelCars,2qdxbx,disgustipated,3,Thu Dec 25 20:05:29 2014 UTC,That's some of the best paint I've seen. What is your process and how much do all your materials cost? What do you use for the wood grain on the interior?
ModelCars,2qdxbx,peedeearr,2,Thu Dec 25 21:27:49 2014 UTC,"It's really nothing out of the ordinary. All paint is Testor's Model Master spray cans: clear, Go Mango, and primer. Most of the work is in the sanding/polishing of the top coat.   I used the 3 cans of paint, 2000 grit wet-dry from Autozone, and a set of polishing pads like these, along with the Novus 3-step system. Less than $50 in the finish, counting everything (pads are reusable, Novus will last forever).  Process was: 1 coat primer, dry overnight, 2 coats color (3 hours between coats), dry a couple of days, sand level with 2000, 2 coats clear (3 hours between), gave it several days to cure then progressively polished with 4000, 6000, 8000, 12,000 grit, Novus 3, Novus 2, and a final polish with Novus 1.  Just takes time and patience. The biggest lesson I learned is, ""Don't mess with it!"" - minimize the number of times you do something like trying to fix a bad spot when sanding. The more you mess with it, the more chances of screwing up. :)"
ModelCars,2qdxbx,peedeearr,2,Fri Dec 26 00:23:47 2014 UTC,"Ah, woodgrain, just saw your question. Those were actually decals in the kit. I had to apply several coats of Micro Sol to get the dash decal to settle."

I wouldn't think that it would be thick enough for polishing.  The last thing I apply after polishing creams is Novus 1; it's a silicone ""wax"" that leaves the finish slippery as hell."

ModelCars,2p2h9z,ScaryAngryTurtle,3,Fri Dec 12 10:37:04 2014 UTC,"1: Yes they will  2: use some sprue from the kit, heat it up and strech it, then snip it in half (where you streched it thin), glue it into place, cut off the excess and sand it a bit. it will give you a better seal, and wont shrink over time and make dents in the paint job  3: yes, it will make the paint stick to the body, aswell as eliminate the ""transparency"" from the plastic, which looks like a toy car if not used. A thin primer coat is more than enough, if you don't have different ""colors"" on the car when you prime it, it should look superb when painted and clear coated.   Bonus: As for clear coat, i use tamiya TS13 from the can, and then polish it up with a polishing stick and tamiya compound for a very nice shine"

ModelCars,2ozi0g,MinatoP3,4,Thu Dec 11 16:49:06 2014 UTC,"Are you talking about painting the body and other large parts? If so, you really need to learn how to properly spray paint. There's no way to get a quality finish with a brush.  On smaller pieces, and for painting detail on large pieces, the brush is the way to go.  Get 2 or 3 decent brushes (Testor's sells a nice starter 3-pack).  Get something like this to mix/thin your paint. Don't paint directly out of the bottle unless you know the paint's not too thick (most all paints in the little Testor's bottles are pretty thick; certain colors are okay - never had to thin their silver - experimenting will show you which are too think for brushing).  The biggest trick to getting good brush paint is once you cover a part, don't touch it or brush over it again and again until it's completely dry.  If you're going to paint a body, here's an easy way to get a finish you'll be proud to show off:    Get 3 cans of spray paint, and all of the same type: White Lacquer Primer, Body Color Lacquer, and Gloss Clear Coat Lacquer. Wash the body in warm soapy water, rinse thoroughly, blow dry (or blot and let air dry; if you have hard water, watch out for spotting). Find a place to paint that's room temperature, no wind, no dust, no humidity. This can range from the back porch to a garage to a paint booth. If you absolutely have to spray outside, plan on letting the parts dry inside. Have a drying setup - a large plastic bin turned upside-down with something to let air flow underneath, like propping it up on blocks. This way it can outgas and vent without getting dust on it. Have a secure method of holding the body - anything from a bent coathanger to a spring-loaded body holder. If you have access to compressed air, use that at the last minute before you paint to blow the dust off the model. Otherwise, a lint-free cloth will do, just make sure there's no dust or hair. First coat: primer: Shake the can per instructions, hold the model 10 inches from the can or more. Start and stop your spray passes OFF the model - point the can in front of it, press the nozzle down, take 1-2  seconds to make the pass across the surface, then release the nozzle after it passes the entire body/part. Never start or stop on the part.  Do this in overlapping passes until the entire body has a uniform coat of primer. Put it in the drying station, leave it alone for 1-2 days. Second and 3rd coats - body color: same technique as above, except you want to spray a light mist-coat first. This is a uniformly ""speckled"" coat, not a thick coat of color. You do this by staying even farther back with the can and spraying much more quickly on the part than a steady coat. Spray the mist coat (remember, at least 10-12 inches between body and spray can), give it 2 minutes to dry, then  spray an even coat of body color, again starting and stopping off the part, and keeping the can at the proper distance (might be 8"", might be 10"", just be consistent).  Depending on the paint, you can usually paint the second coat within 10-15 minutes. If you can't, then let the part sit in the drying station for 2-3 days before giving it the second coat. Clear Coats - after you're done with the color coats, let it sit for a couple of days, then cover it with clear using the same techniques as above (but no mist-coat). Some paints recommend clear coating after 2 hours, but I always wait at least a day for the paint to cure. This avoids the funky finishes like crazing, cracking, running, etc.  1-2 clear coats should do the trick. That's it. You now have a fantastic finish.   What I didn't include: sanding - a thorough pass with 1500-2000 grit prior to primer will help with adhesion.  Also, sanding the primer with 2000 grit will give it a smoother appearance, just do it lightly so you don't sand the primer off.  Polishing - you can polish the final coats but make sure you know what you're doing. Nothing ruins a finish quicker than polishing through the top coat into the primer.  Paints: I use Testor's Model Master Lacquer spray cans. Wear a big rubber glove on the hand holding the part so you don't have to clean yourself after.  Examples: This is the basic technique I used to paint these two models: 1968 Dodge Charger, 1970 Plymouth 'cuda (work-in-progress).  The Charger's clear coat was left as-is, not polished. The Cuda's clear coat was polished using 6 different grits from 4000 to 12,000, then 2 polishing creams.   Let me know if anything's unclear or if you have any questions."
ModelCars,2ozi0g,disgustipated,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:21:55 2014 UTC,"I was talking about doing the body and the motor by hand, yes. So is there really no way to do the whole thing by hand?

ModelCars,2ozi0g,disgustipated,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:56:15 2014 UTC,"Well, using a spray can is like doing it by hand, especially if you consider that you could've used an airbrush. :)  I really don't know of any way to use a brush and get a smooth finish. I guess you could brush paint, then sand to level the paint, then polish the color coat, but you're talking much more time, much more potential for error than getting a few rattle cans and carefully coating the plastic.  The brush is great for detail, which really gives it a personal touch. I build a classic pickup truck model for a friend and got a great brush finish simulating wood in the bed. For a personal touch, I got some decal paper, and put his business logo on the truck."

ModelCars,2ogvia,disgustipated,2,Sat Dec 6 16:30:11 2014 UTC,"Finally got a nice finish after really screwing it up. :) All body paint came from spray cans (no airbrushing). You're looking at 1 coat of Model Master Lacquer white primer, 2 coats ""Go Mango"" Model Master lacquer, and 2 coats Model Master Ultra-Gloss clear.  As for the screwup, I played with sanding/polishing the roof area prior to the clearcoat, and went right through the finish into the primer. Argh. To make things worse, after sanding and prepping for repainting the roof, I had the can too close and was rewarded with huge blotches, bubbles, and orange peel.  More sanding and prep, then a light feathering coat of color to even things up.  After that, I sanded color with 2000 grit very carefully, and applied 2 coats clear. The clear was polished with 4000, 6000, 8000, and 12000 grit pads, then got a good going over with Novus #3 (heavy scratch polish) and #2 (fine scratch polish).  After I get the foil trim done, I'll go over it with the Novus #1 polish/protectant.

ModelCars,2oco0m,ScaryAngryTurtle,6,Fri Dec 5 09:42:50 2014 UTC,"Rules to remember:   Your first paint job will probably suck.  Now that your expectations are lowered, you'll be happier with how it turns out!  If it's a dual action airbrush, remember this golden rule - start with air, end with air.  If you don't, the 'brush will fling blobs of paint on your work. You should aim for the consistency of whole milk when thinning paint, but only as a starting point.  Thin paint levels out better, thick paint coats quicker and runs less.  You'll find a happy medium as time goes on.  Any talk of 'ratios' is useless.  Testors Model Master paint is a great example of this - RLM02 gray requires more thinner than RLM66 gray, for instance.  Same paint, same line, totally different performance.  Floquil enamel (if you can still get it), manufactured by the same company as Model Master, can often be sprayed straight from the bottle though.   If you use lacquer or enamel, do yourself a favor and get one of those big 3M masks that filter out organic chemicals and such.  Even with good ventilation, you're bound to get a bit loopy without it.   For every minute you paint, expect 20 minutes of prep.  Seriously.  The cleaner and smoother the surface, the more your masking tape is carefully burnished, the more you've thought out how you'll hold the piece and let it dry and cure, the better your work will look.   You will struggle, you will screw up. But you're learning, so don't give up - you're just one mistake closer to perfection!   Clearcoats redeem many sins, and prevent many future ones."
ModelCars,2oco0m,screamingcheese,4,Fri Dec 5 14:25:42 2014 UTC,"I love all this advice, but let me add:   Every time you use your airbrush, make sure it's clean before you put it away.  No exceptions.  I have used many airbrushes in the past and this seems to be a very universal truth.  If you start with a dirty tool, you'll end up with a poorly performing project.   Check out the cleaning tutorial here:  http://www.aeroscale.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=features&file=view&artid=5090"
ModelCars,2oco0m,NSX_guy,3,Fri Dec 5 19:02:35 2014 UTC,"For every minute you paint, expect 20 minutes of prep.   Can't stress this one enough.  Painting is just one step in making a part look good. After you've scraped the parting lines, sanded the part smooth, carefully masked it, mixed your paints, prepped your paint area, etc... you'll spend just a few seconds going whoosh over the part with paint.  Then you let it cure, remove masking etc."

In fact, if you can, do more than one job on a kit by painting one side one way and then the other. Use different colors, effects, and types of paint. Don't worry about messing up, the idea is to get used to messing up.  Do all the maintenance and clean up as you should.  Only then can you start to do your 'first' paint up. Expect that job to finish up with you wanting to do a better job.  There is no better way to get practice and experience."

ModelCars,2oco0m,disgustipated,1 point,Sat Dec 6 04:33:34 2014 UTC,"If you can find something that's not absorbent, go with that. Cardboard's okay, but won't give the same results as a solid surface.  Old scrap from models, anything made with polystyrene like an old plastic chair, but avoid the ""slick"" feeling (HDPE) plastics.  Something plastic that already has a finish is great - also, use it to learn to sand the surface for painting. Play with different grits, then spray to see the results.  One of my best ""practice"" pieces was a back cover from an old LCD monitor."

Right now the car I've got it on has the windshield all scuffed and scraped as a junker, so I'm not sure it's a good example any longer. :)  Will post some soon when I dig out my '59 Impala and start working on that.  EDIT - totally understandable downvote(s). Sorry guys, I got excited about my early results and then realized that I don't actually have any photos that show off the effect very well despite what I said in OP... in person it looks great when held up in good light. Looking through the windshield gives you a nice subtle sea-green tint that mimics real glass, but yeah, I can't prove it until the next model now..."

ModelCars,2nh0sh,Givuz,2,Wed Nov 26 12:25:09 2014 UTC,"Hi fellow modeler, hopefully I can help -   Revell produces a decent Shelby mustang in 1/24 - you can expect zero extras but the kit is easily available and cheap.   Duplicolor, which is available at Autozone where I live is available in real car colors  is a good albeit expensive choice - I use the scratch filler primer they produce under their paints and the results are beautiful - and best yet they come in rattle cans so with plenty of elbow grease and practice you can produce beautiful paint jobs."
ModelCars,2nh0sh,wolfamongyou,2,Wed Nov 26 14:14:22 2014 UTC,"3. Hobby Lobby has a nice set of sand papers in grits 600, 1k, 2k, 4k, 6k, and 12k. Spend some time with either the 600 or a knife to help get rid of mold lines. Between paint layers, wetsand to help make the paint look more scale"
ModelCars,2nh0sh,Grundy9137,2,Wed Nov 26 15:42:43 2014 UTC,"1966 Shelby GT350  Paint - Since you're brush and can only, I'd go with the Testor's Model Master series. I use enamels for brushing the parts, and lacquers for the body.  They have a 2-step process (color and clear coat) that really puts out a great finish.  Painting tips - Get a primer! Use the same type as the surface. If you're painting the body with lacquer, use a lacquer primer.  Spray one even coat, give it a couple days to cure, then sand down the texture with 2000 grit (use 600 to take out any imperfections/dust, then smooth that with 2000). You can get 3M wet/dry sandpaper in 2000 grit at your local auto parts store.  When you have an even, smooth primer coat, time to lay on your color. Make sure you have somewhere dust-free to store the parts while the paint dries. I use an upside-down plastic tub, but I place it on small blocks so there's airflow underneath for the paint curing process.  The biggest issue folks have is too much paint, which is usually caused by spraying too close to the part. Start 10-12 inches away, and spray past the item - don't start or stop on the part.  Put a couple of light ""mist coats"" (more spotted, not full coverage) on first, give them a few minutes to tack up, then smoothly and evenly spray your body color. Apply a second coat if necessary. Let it dry per instructions, then give it a coat of clear using the same techniques.  If you screw up, take the nasty parts, put them in a freezer bag, and give it a generous spray of Easy Off oven cleaner in the bag. Shake it, make sure all bad paint gets a dose of Easy Off. Depending on the paint, it will take 10 minutes to 2 hours for the stuff to remove all paint, and it won't hurt the plastic.  Assembly - I usually remove all the subassembly parts from the sprue, so I can clean up the nubs and flash and other crap before assembling and painting. You can pre-assemble like colors - for example, engine block halves, before painting.    Interior - There are many techniques to getting an accurate looking interior. You can mix a bit of silver with a semi-gloss black to give it that vinyl shine - if you'd rather have it dull, then a layer of Testor's Dullcote over a gloss or semi-gloss gives a nice effect.  Visit YouTube and watch some vids on dry brushing technique. This is great for getting the detail on dashboard features (radio, vents, etc). Also, if you're brave, go for the Bare Metal Foil - the stuff is hard to work with but gives amazing results.  Use it for the chrome trim  around windows, stuff like that.  Good luck!"
ModelCars,2nh0sh,disgustipated,2,Wed Nov 26 15:55:23 2014 UTC,"Thank you very much for this it is very helpful! 1 question, for the interior would it be best to paint the parts on the sprue then glue them together because as I understand some car interior parts can get quite small and fiddly. Usually I would never paint parts on the sprue but it seems like it might be the better option."
ModelCars,2nh0sh,disgustipated,1 point,Thu Nov 27 07:31:55 2014 UTC,"I've stopped painting on sprue pretty much completely.  For the tiniest parts, I'll stick them on the end of a toothpick, either by drilling a tiny hole, or by using a drop of adhesive on the back/bottom.  The only time I'd leave it on the sprue is if the attachment point is on the bottom/glue side.  Even then, after you get a nice paint job on it, removing from the sprue and handling increases the chance of doing something stupid, which I'm really good at. :)"

ModelCars,2ncktn,againstliam,1 point,Wed Nov 26 02:44:11 2014 UTC,"I believe I got that around $25? I think it's a great deal because it allows you to choose between the JDM or USADM form which allows you to choose either left or right hand drive and has both exterior and interior parts to accommodate your choice(also for USADM it uses California license plate decals)! This one is actually fully detailed just like the R32 except it has hinges on the hood so you can show of the engine bay properly :D   It's a WIP right now. I've been trying some painting techniques on the body and I had it just right; however, I didn't realize I used a matte clear coat instead of a shiny one :( I'm going to strip the paint to the base as much as possible, but as right now I'm not too motivated to do so.

ModelCars,2n5wpl,Lorbe_Wabo,2,Sun Nov 23 17:22:19 2014 UTC,I think I kinda figured it out on my lowrider build  http://i.imgur.com/5Nw58T0.jpg
ModelCars,2n5wpl,Gumderwear,2,Tue Nov 25 12:42:24 2014 UTC,"yup......that's the answer. Once you have been doing it a while, you'll build up your ""parts bin/box"". Some kits come with extra parts. You can pick up kits or parts or ""built-ups"" even, at yard sales, thrift shops or if you are lucky a swap meet. Real car shows often have vendors....there's usually a model seller or 2. Ebay too....buy a lot of started kits and go from there."

Shocks and springs were fabricated from 12 gauge copper electrical wire that I had sitting around. Front end was a lot more difficult as it is a TTB suspension setup and required some pretty sketchy lift bracket construction from Evergreen stock, I'm not happy with it though and will probably just convert to a solid axle using the rear housing from another kit. There is no ""kit"" to my knowledge, if you are going to lift a project you are going to have to do some scratch building."

One thing I've noticed lately with model car engines, not just yours, but most that I see, it the fan blades always look too thick. Some flat photoetch fan blades or fan assemblies that you can twist you own pitch would be just the thing."

ModelCars,2mu3t7,peedeearr,2,Mon Nov 24 11:26:36 2014 UTC,"yes moddl cars are getting more expensive i remember when they were $5 to $10 was the most expensive ones!  painting the part: once u have painted the parts do a ""dry"" fit to see where u will have to add clue, clue and paint dont mix well if u painted a section of the part that needs to be clues just use an x-acto nife to remove the paint.  painting the body and adding decal: make sure you paint in a well ventilated area. they sell spray paint for models. use light coats when painting let it dry about one or 2 days. for the paint to dry much fast place the car somewhere warm like on top of ur cable box but elevate the model over the box or in front of ur tv! the heat of the those can help u out if ur house is to cold!   after the car is dry add decals if u are using them soak the decal in warm water check out youtube to get a more detail visual way to add decals  once ur done use gloss clear coat spray (AutoZone or WalMart) to spray over the car this will help with the decals not come off"

ModelCars,2mfud8,GatorStateTrash,3,Sun Nov 16 04:11:00 2014 UTC,"From someone who learned the hard way, here are a few tips - see this post for my results... which I wasn't sure about, but based on the comments... ;)  First, get all those exterior body-color parts together. Wash and dry them, then spray with a coat of primer. This seals the part and gives a great surface for the paint to adhere to.  Sand out any imperfections, and give all the parts a light sanding with 2000 grit paper (I use automotive sanding paper for this). Learn to wet-sand. It's really simple, the idea is to use the flow of water to keep particles from building up between your sandpaper and the body, which leads to scratches and clogged paper.  You don't want a mirror-smooth surface on your primer - the paint adheres better if there's some texture. A ""scuffing"" with the 2000 grit should be all it takes.  Next, you want to shoot your mist coats. If you don't have an airbrush, by all means use something like Testor's Model Master Lacquer in spray cans (that's what I used on the '68 Charger, I think it was called ""Mythic Maroon"").  A mist coat is just that - a very light, fog applied to the body, not a full coverage coat. This will help the main coat adhere better and will help avoid runs and drips.  Give the mist about 2 minutes, then spray your first main coat (the Testor's ""One Coat Lacquer"" that I used - I applied 2 main coats total).  You want to keep the spray head the same distance from the model as you work back and forth. Make sure to start your spray before the model, and let it spray until after your pass - never start or stop the spray directly on the part being sprayed.  After a good coat (use something like a coat hanger or spring-loaded body holder so you can get it from all sides/direction), put the model in/under something (I use an overturned plastic tub but I ""lift"" it with blocks about an inch so there's air circulation for the drying process).  I usually waith 45 minutes to an hour to spray the second coat (read the paint's instructions), then it's back under the tub for 3 days to cure before I spray the clear coat.  The Charger model has 3 coats of ""wet look"" clear and no buffing. I got a great finish so I didn't sand between coats, but some would recommend sanding with at least 2000 grit before moving to the clear coat.  That's about it - probably most important is to keep it dust-free. This is nearly impossible for me - I'm in very dry cold air, and static electricity makes the model a dust magnet.  To clean before painting, I first brush it off with a lint-free cloth, then hit it with compressed air from my airbrush compressor. If anything remains (hold at an angle to a light to see), I'll use a soft 1"" clean paintbrush to get the last pieces of lint off.  And nothing helps you learn like practice - get an old crappy kit to practice on, and try different techniques to see what works best for you.  If you don't have a subscription to Scale Auto Magazine, you might want to sign up - they have great tutorials, plus you can get a ""Build Better Models"" type guide as a gift when you subscribe.  One word about clear coats - I will try this on my next model: Apply 7 or 8 coats of clear, then use a polishing system like Novus to create an amazing finish."
ModelCars,2mfud8,disgustipated,3,Sun Nov 16 16:41:32 2014 UTC,"I do most of what you explained other than primer and clear coat.I'll give them a try. I normally set mine to dry fr 12-4 8 hours before applying another coat. Thank you, very much and that Charger is bad ass."
ModelCars,2mfud8,screamingcheese,2,Mon Nov 17 03:56:40 2014 UTC,"You'll wanna clearcoat everything once you see how great it looks, especially metallic and pearl paints.  The most important thing to consider is PATIENCE.  Never rush your work, never try to work on a model before the paint has fully cured.  It's agonizing when it's dry to the touch and you want to slam that together and see that model in it's full glory."
ModelCars,2mfud8,screamingcheese,2,Tue Nov 18 13:37:54 2014 UTC,"Novus is dangerous on softer paints, like enamel or acrylic color coats.  I've burned through the finish without even trying numerous times.  On harder clearcoats though, the result can be spectacular.   A word of warning - Around coat 4-5 of the Testors clear gloss lacquer, it starts becoming opaque and cloudy! I've got a urethane clearcoat kit coming from Spotmodel.com (I think the brand was Number 5), and it claims you'll get the same look from a single coat, without adding a lot of thickness, and will be dry and workable within 24 hours.  It's supposedly derived from the same stuff used in the automotive industry, but formulated so it won't melt the plastic.  If that's the case, I can believe it - my car's bumper was replaced, and the shop that did it had it painted, clearcoated, and installed within a two-day span, where I can't seem to get a body painted and off my workbench in less than a month!"

ModelCars,2meoko,rhs856,2,Sun Nov 16 06:01:59 2014 UTC,"There are two issues involved - how and with what. I started thinking about the how part and had an idea: why not do this like a chalk line? You hold a painted line or string taut and place it on the car to make the pinstripe. This will work well for flat sided cars, but not curvy complicated ones. For curvy ones, you could use the line or string as a single-hair paint brush if you are steady enough.  Now the with what piece.   This randomly chosen company sells wire and the thinnest piece they make is .002 in - 3.8x what you are looking for.  Berkley Nanofil is the thinnest commercially available fishing line I found (in 1-lb test). It is .001 inches thick - 1.9x thicker than your line. (I also found this 1/4lb test line for magic applications, but it doesn't list its diameter.)  The human hair ranges from 0.00067 to 0.00709 in. This is 1.2-13.6x thicker than your line. If you know someone with long, thin hair who won't think you are a creep for wanting some of it, this is your cheapest option.  Medical sutures come in many sizes, and I figured they would make it pretty thin to be able to tie off very small blood vessels. According to this table, you could use either 10-0 (1.5x thicker than your line)  or 11-0 (1.3x thinner than your line) suture monofilament, used for eye surgery. This comes in boxes of 12 for $400+. This is your most expensive option, but also the one that is closest to the size you need. And just think of the money you'll save the next time you go in for eye surgery with your own sutures.  Do you have a friend with a laser engraving machine?"
ModelCars,2meoko,disgustipated,1 point,Sun Nov 16 15:18:42 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful and serious reply!  I've done some thinking too... The wire/suture thing came across my mind, but I could not think of a way to get the paint to stick to it evenly. so I thought of the 'other' way... paint the car in the stripe color, attach the wire/suture/hair somehow and then paint the car the body color. Then remove the mask leaving the pinstripe on the car.  The laser is another idea... What about getting some photosensitive film and use that as a mask? I don't know enough about the physics of exposing the film or the chemistry of washing it off, but it is used for making circuit boards and can make paths as small as 40 micrometers!"
ModelCars,2meoko,disgustipated,2,Sun Nov 16 15:29:58 2014 UTC,"Another possibility is to create the pinstripe as an art file on your PC, then using decal paper, print it, and apply as a decal. Not sure how it would turn out, but it's worthy of experimentation."
ModelCars,2meoko,screamingcheese,1 point,Sun Nov 16 16:45:28 2014 UTC,"I agree. I was looking into this.  To expand on that thought: I thought of putting the car body on a scanner bed, using the scan as a template background for the graphic, and making the graphic from that.  It just might work."

I used a new x-acto blade and a straight edge to cut narrow strips. Ended up using 4 strips per window opening. Using a q-tip, hold one end of the strip in place with your finger, then slowly work it along with the q-tip (a toothpick will also work, but be careful not to tear the foil).  I didn't have much luck applying it like I would masking tape - holding it with my fingers and working along the part - the stuff just tears too easily at the slightest pull.  That's about it - once you get it looking decent, don't mess with it. I always try to work out that last wrinkle or bubble and end up screwing the whole thing up.  Just more practice, I guess. :)"

ModelCars,2lxwql,Wired_Wrong,2,Wed Nov 26 16:11:44 2014 UTC,Bare Metal Foil
ModelCars,2lxwql,Wired_Wrong,1 point,Wed Nov 26 16:13:56 2014 UTC,"As the title says, this is my first real build since getting back into the hobby. The build is box-stock, added a bit of Bare Metal foil, and learned many things along the way.  Paint is Testor's semi-gloss primer, 2 coats of Testors Model Master Mythic Maroon, and 2 coats of clear lacquer. Much of the little stuff is brush painted Testor's enamel. I haven't buffed or polished anything yet. The stance is how it builds - if I did it again, I'd definitely try to get the front a bit lower.  There are alignment problems with the hood, glue smudges, I screwed up the redline decals... the list of failures to correct on the next model is quite long, but I had an absolute blast building this.  So, what do you guys think of my first real build in 30+ years?  Constructive criticism welcome. :)"
ModelCars,2lxwql,Lorbe_Wabo,4,Tue Nov 11 06:14:42 2014 UTC,"Very nicely done dude. Super clean and I love the shine.  Future Protip - Use anything but testors enamel, for being so bloody thick the stuff covers like garbage.  Where'd ya use the foil? I can't even tell that's how well it turned out.  Edit - Sorry I forgot to welcome you back to this fine hobby. Welcome :)"
ModelCars,2lxwql,SecondhandUsername,1 point,Tue Nov 11 15:05:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I typically put about 10 drops of thinner in the Testor's bottles, that seems to help. I'm slowly moving over to the Model Master stuff, it seems to flow much better.  The foil was on the trim line between the trunk and tail lights, the windshield and side window frames. If there is one thing that teaches patience in model building, it's working with that foil."
ModelCars,2lxwql,WaddleWaddleMofo,5,Tue Nov 11 15:08:44 2014 UTC,Nice work!   You know it's funny getting older in this hobby. When you're a kid you have nothing but time and no patience then you get to be our age and your left with nothing but patience and no time. I used to build because I was bored and now I build because I hope it makes life less complicated for a while. It's a great thing when 1 hobby hits you at 2 points in life for different reasons each time.

ModelCars,2l745u,Caudburns11,2,Mon Nov 3 21:44:01 2014 UTC,"Besides doing small detail work, any reason you are brushing paint onto parts? I've always had better luck and a more professional finish by prepping each part (cut from the mold tree, sand, file, etc) and tape to a skewer and use spray paint.  It is a bit more wasteful of paint, but the end result is so smooth that it's hard to go any other way."
ModelCars,2l745u,costanza_vandelay,2,Tue Nov 4 03:47:21 2014 UTC,That's what I'm doing for most of the parts but I was going to do the little things like detail stuff with by brushing. I will probably try the all spray paint on my next one. Like I said this is my first one.
ModelCars,2l745u,costanza_vandelay,2,Tue Nov 4 04:41:54 2014 UTC,"For small detail painting, you can use Testors acrylic if you remember to stir it really well so it isn't as watery, or you can use their enamels but make sure you're painting on already dry paint."
ModelCars,2l745u,rhs856,1 point,Tue Nov 4 04:58:24 2014 UTC,Are they acrylic?
ModelCars,2l745u,rhs856,2,Tue Nov 4 00:14:55 2014 UTC,I believe so
ModelCars,2l745u,Lorbe_Wabo,2,Tue Nov 4 00:17:17 2014 UTC,Testor's acrylics are really watery and it takes several coats (if you are brushing it on). Get some enamels and you will be much happier.
ModelCars,2l745u,rhs856,2,Tue Nov 4 00:19:24 2014 UTC,Enamels do require a certain technique though... try not to go over an area you've just painted with more paint. It will turn out splotchy and look messy.
ModelCars,2l745u,lunacy95,2,Tue Nov 4 02:55:12 2014 UTC,okay thanks. This is my first one and I'm still learning as I'm going but unfortunately I don't have enough money to buy new paints for this project so I will attempt to do my best with the acrylics. Is there much of a price difference between acrylics and enamels?

It depends... but it seems like a hobby I can enjoy in the future. I know the box recommends the ModelMaster gloss and primer... but I was able to find those in spray can form on amazon from another maker. That should be fine right?   I couldn't find the ""mist gray"" spray color so I am not sure how to substitute. Any ideas?"
ModelCars,2kj7q9,t25torx,1 point,Wed Oct 29 03:26:35 2014 UTC,"Yep I just use dollar store primer, primer is primer.   On the color side of it, if I do use a spray can I generally go with a lacquer paint, enamel takes too long to dry. And I use whatever color/brand I like. I don't stick to Testors stuff on that.   If you have an Autozone or Advanced Auto nearby you can get the Duplicolor spray paint in a color that matches what you are going for. You'll also need to get a can of gloss clear coat if you go that route. Just remember you don't have to stick with the box art color.   *Edit: Try and spray paint as many parts as you can, brush painting is really hard to do right and get it without brush strokes showing through."

ModelCars,2kbvea,peedeearr,1 point,Sun Oct 26 01:35:19 2014 UTC,I only prime the small stuff if it's a light color going over red plastic to prevent bleed through. Most hobby paint is designed to stick to bare plastic. Just make sure you wash it with some dish soap first to get the oils off.
ModelCars,2k9o04,Caudburns11,2,Sat Oct 25 06:28:07 2014 UTC,"Depends on the kit.  For the most part, most kits will come in body colour, similar to the box art, and sometimes the interior and stuff comes in another colour.  In the end though, you'll want to transition into just painting the body anyway, as the bare plastic doesn't look great."
ModelCars,2k9o04,scrapedknuckles,2,Sat Oct 25 08:41:08 2014 UTC,"That's not a stupid question buddy. Most models of road cars will be white, but if the model is of a race car that had a pretty specific colour, some manufacturers mould the body in coloured plastic that at least closely resembles the original. For example , the body of Tamiya's recent recent release of the Porsche 934 Jaegermeister sponsored car is a pretty good approximation of the fairly unique orange that the real cars had. It does pay to paint the bodies though, because a well painted body will almost always look better than bare plastic. And of course that gives you more variety to paint it the way you like. It's worth it to find specific model paints rather than trying to use any other type of paint though."

ModelCars,2jiel4,Smithhon,1 point,Fri Oct 17 18:51:56 2014 UTC,You mind telling how you did the paint?
ModelCars,2jiel4,joker151,1 point,Fri Oct 17 18:56:47 2014 UTC,Brushed on testors enamel rust. Then I dip my brush in testors acrylic burnt umber then water then coat sections of the model. I then keep brushing on water to get the burnt umber to run off. It streaks and leaves a sort of even wash. Another way is to have the burnt umber kind of thin when brushed on them pat it down with paper towels. After the wash I use testors enamel flat light brown and dry brush light rust streaks wherever. Flat clear coat to top it all off

ModelCars,2hgj2u,Jahria,7,Thu Sep 25 21:45:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks, the fit is excellent. Aoshima kits are on par with tamiya, and miles ahead of fujimi and revell etc.   The paint is actually Krylon cherry red, and was terrible out of the can. I spent  a ton of time sanding and polishing the surface.   I should mention that you have to cut the fenders yourself though, the wing is a bit of a pain of alight perfectly. Otherwise everything is really good and it comes with a large amount of extra parts (from the regular frs)"
ModelCars,2hgj2u,WaddleWaddleMofo,2,Thu Sep 25 22:33:27 2014 UTC,What did you use for the polish?  Edit: Also any tips on methods for said polishing?
ModelCars,2hgj2u,WaddleWaddleMofo,3,Tue Oct 14 05:26:29 2014 UTC,"I'm really lazy and this is probably unorthodox, but for this model I did:  2000grit - 3000 grit -  turtle wax rubbing compound - turtle wax platinum finish   You could probably go straight to a higher grit if your clear coat is decent. The rubbing compound and wax are just the cheap stuff for cars (maybe $6 each bottle which will last you forever).     The rubbing compound is probably somewhere around 5000 grit or so, and actually still leaves visible scratches if you are rough with it."
ModelCars,2hgj2u,datcivicdoe,1 point,Tue Oct 14 06:14:13 2014 UTC,Sorry if this is a common question and I'm just starting to get back into modeling but what is the benefits of clear coating the body? But thank you for answering my first question I'll give it a try!
ModelCars,2hgj2u,AkinaSuns,3,Tue Oct 14 06:36:10 2014 UTC,"I'm no pro either, but I believe it helps give your paint that nice shine. You can buff out a model without a clear coat, but the clear coat helps a lot and gives the paint depth (both visually and physically).  When you polish a model, you can take off quite a bit of paint. There's nothing worse than sanding down to your primer/ raw plastic.   Some gloss coats prevent fade, and can also prevent your paint from scratching. You also need it if you are doing metallic coats since you cannot stand or buff them (it turns out badly).     Have you ever seen a car without a clearcoat? It looks very dull and the paint starts to chip and fade.     With all that said, I would definitely clear coat your exterior car bodies. Maybe someone can chime in and add some more points to this subject"

Don't worry, and don't mess with it. As it dries, it will lay down smoothly. I've found it's best to walk away for a few hours after applying. For me the temptation to mess with it is too great, but I always end up ruining the decal. Just walk away and let it do its magic... lol"

ModelCars,2gcag3,screamingcheese,1 point,Sun Sep 14 13:50:58 2014 UTC,"Many folks have mentioned Scale Motorsport's carbon decals.  In the past, I've had mixed luck with getting them to lay down properly over really complex surfaces, like vents and louvers.  You can use a hairdryer an MicroSol, and that does a pretty good job, but the decals are still brittle and unpredictable.  I believe this to be because of the decal's printing itself, rather than the carrier film.    Long story short, look for Scale Motorsport's (or any other brand's) clear carbon decal material.  Instead of being a solid print of the pattern, it's only the highlight color.  In these cases, paint the part a gunmetal-like, or metallic black color, then apply this decal material.  It'll be much more forgiving, and if you goof, then it's only a tiny screw-up in the pattern and not the overall color.  Edit: clarity."

ModelCars,2dnx5o,shlerm,1 point,Sat Aug 16 04:11:17 2014 UTC,None of the new bikes have exhausts like these.  highly tuned 2 strokes need an expansion chamber for each cylinder so that the bike can breathe properly. So each exhaust you can see comes from a different cylinder (V4 = 4 Exhausts) and each needs it's expansion chamber.  The new bikes carry Catalytic Converters now which is what you see on those bikes you listed.  I've seen a 6 cylinder 2 stroke before with some narly exhaust arrangments I'll try and find a picture.

I would mist a coat, then do a wet coat.  Typically, I'll then sand that coat with 2000+ grit, and then do one last clear coat.  I've had many paint jobs come out after that without any additional polishing needed.  If there are still any imperfections left, i'll use Tamiya's polishing compound in ""Polish"" grit.  Finally, Tamiya has a model wax that really brings out the shine.  There is one caveat, however.  Tamiya's TS gloss clear just went through a reformulation, and can be hard to find recently - especially in local hobby stores.  It can be found through the internet, though.

ModelCars,2cmnpu,Ilikeseahorses,2,Mon Aug 4 21:56:47 2014 UTC,"I usually paint small parts on the tree, then touch up as necessary. Depends. If you're putting together sub-assemblies that will all be the same color, paint after you've glued them together. If you're working with parts that are different colors, paint then glue. Use very little glue and make sure the paint is fully dry. I prefer to use super glue. It's cheap and gets the job done. Wet sanding is not vital. It is an advanced technique, but will help your finished product. Basically, it is what it sounds like. Instead of sanding ""dry,"" keep the area you are sanding wet. This is a good tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW_e9WOMO6s I do not generally prime small parts. Others may tell you differently. Model shows are a great place to find inexpensive kits and meet others involved in the hobby around your area. My biggest advise is to treat each part as a model itself.

IF you prep the body/primer properly, you shouldn't need to wet sand. Paint is a coating, NOT a filler.  5) I prime pretty much everything. Helps paints adhere.  6) I'm not made of money and on Disability, but I prefer quality paints/primers/glue/cements. MUCH less frustration than dealing with cheaper products.

I stick these into Styrofoam from boxes. You can hold the toothpick while painting, then stick it in the foam to put it down I prime almost everything. Certainly everything I plan on handling more than once. Especially if it's a light color and the plastic is red or dark.  sand the primer for surfaces that need to be smooth paint wet sand texture out of paint.    If I had parts sit for days or weeks after washing, before painting, I blow them off then give them a quick wipe with a tack cloth to get any residue or dust off.   I know some of this stuff is overkill for a beginner, but as time goes on you'll want to improve your skills, and parts prep is so critical.   I just went completely nuts and bought a spray booth (I built my own in the past) and am modifying it to be completely sealed and dust proof. Not economical, but that's where I'm at now."

ModelCars,2a5qrl,Rhyzo,2,Tue Jul 8 17:20:50 2014 UTC,"depends on how far you want to take it....and how much you want to spend. Preparation is the key. It is VERY similar to painting real cars, and not at all similar to painting real cars. You really have to learn the art of it.....just enough primer, just enough paint and just enough clear coat to be able to wet sand without going through the clear, paint down to the primer....or worse. Orange peel is from not prepping the surface you are going to paint, or maybe a paint compatibility issue. Sometimes the paint can be too hot for the primer, or the clear is too hot. I've had hot primer eat the plastic before on a rare occasion. I have ( somewhere ) an awesome wet sanding kit for car models. it has about 8 sheets of sanding cloth that goes all the up to 12,000 grit...yes- 12k!! The few times I've used that, the model looks smoother than glass. Wax and grease remover is most definitely not needed...unless you have greasy, waxy hands while doing this....and why would you do that??"
ModelCars,2a5qrl,Gumderwear,2,Tue Jul 8 18:34:38 2014 UTC,"I use wax and grease remover with a tack cloth just as a precaution on real body panels to remove any dust, finger prints, not having the paint stick properly in some areas to cause chipping, and really just to get rid of any microscopic things that can get in the way of a nice finish. It is all in the preparation, so why not add a little extra insurance?  I'm aware that spraypaint has a tendency to not come out evenly, so how warm should the water be to place the cans in? Ever had experience with any Krylon x-metals or silver paint?"
ModelCars,2a5qrl,Gumderwear,-4,Tue Jul 8 18:53:56 2014 UTC,"dude.....where did you ever learn what you do know???? it sounds counter-productive to plastic??

And who said anything about soaking paint can in water??? Are you in the Antarctic?? I only do that in Jan./Feb. if I have zero other choices.

Will some ruin the decal prints?  What about if there's a part that's black on the real car, and so is the molded plastic. Do you paint it or leave it alone? The car I plan on doing has black wing mirrors and I feel like it'd be a waste to just paint them black.  Edit: Also, could I use black and chrome gundam markers for window trims?"
ModelCars,2a3b2t,Brettfarve4,2,Mon Jul 7 22:47:31 2014 UTC,I know there was a tutorial in Car Modeler way back in the 90's. If I remember correctly you use aluminum tubing that fits into another to make  something like a bearing and affix the bigger size to the axle and the smaller onto the wheel.

ModelCars,29d91e,k24jose,3,Sun Jun 29 03:10:45 2014 UTC,"Hand painting looks better if you lay a layer of rattle can primer down before painting. What I do is assemble pieces into sections that are easy to paint (engine block, seats, wheels, etc), prime them, then come back and hand paint them. The paint sticks well and goes on nice and even.  Also try thinning your gloss colors down a bit if they're going on clumpy. You won't have as much control of the paint but it's more likely to self level due to it being thinner.  Your detail looks really good here so don't give up on hand painting yet."
ModelCars,29d91e,DrCockenstein,2,Sun Jun 29 16:03:08 2014 UTC,I agree. If you thin the paint down and do a few layers it goes on super smooth. I just got an airbrush and it's a game changer. I would suggest investing if at all possible.
ModelCars,29d91e,whistlndixie,2,Sun Jun 29 16:07:21 2014 UTC,How useful is an airbrush for small stuff? I'd think you'd still need to drop down to brushes for details. Being able to spray in an indoor paint box would be nice.
ModelCars,29d91e,DrCockenstein,4,Sun Jun 29 16:13:05 2014 UTC,I use it for covering damn near everything. Super small details will require a brush. I'm sure with lots of practice you could get pretty fine detail with an airbrush. I have only had mine a week so i'm not a pro with it yet. The paint is atomized so small with an airbrush that it looks great. Much better than a brush or rattle can.
ModelCars,29d91e,whistlndixie,2,Sun Jun 29 16:17:41 2014 UTC,Thanks for kind words. Yea I just recently found out about thinning the paints and using the rattle can for primer. Never was really into painting or trying to make the car so real but this time around I've actually tried to put a lot of effort into it. This is my 3rd car and certainly one of the best imo. As for now that airbrush kits are at least over a buck gonna be using the hand painting method and will be thinning a lot more. Thanks again.
ModelCars,29d91e,smedema,1 point,Sun Jun 29 22:03:09 2014 UTC,Do what I did and get a cheap airbrush kit. It works fine for a beginner and gives you something to work off and upgrade.

ModelCars,28vekh,t25torx,-3,Mon Jun 23 16:19:14 2014 UTC,"wrong........buy a cheap airbrush set up from Harbor Freight first, see if that's what you want......learn a few things first so when you do spend a good sized chunk of change, you'll know what you want and what to look for.  If you just got your drivers license, would you go out and buy an F1 racing car?? I think you did a fine job rattle canning that Firebird."
ModelCars,28vekh,Gumderwear,3,Mon Jun 23 18:08:26 2014 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, Harbor Freight can and does have some good deals and good tools. I however cannot recommend any airbrush from them since I have never had the chance to try one. The Paasche however is hands down the best airbrush I have ever had, and if I need to get parts for it, it's a known brand and easy to get replacement needles and other stuff for.   And your analogy is a little off, It's actually more like buying a Honda vs. a Daewoo. You'll pay more up front, but it's something that will last you a looong long time if you take care of it.  So right now the cheapest airbrush at Harbor Freight is about $20 and the Paasche is right at $60 so I guess you could buy 3 of the HF units and keep 2 for spare parts, since you'll never be able to buy replacment parts for them once they go out of stock there."

ModelCars,28vekh,SecondhandUsername,1 point,Tue Jun 24 01:57:32 2014 UTC,I recommend the Master airbrushes from TCPGlobal http://www.tcpglobal.com/AirbrushDepot. You can pick up a good quality airbrush for not much more than the el cheapo Harbor Freight kit.  They carry rebuild kits and individual parts for all their airbrushes.
ModelCars,28nzrc,MohnJaddenPowers,2,Fri Jun 20 19:29:47 2014 UTC,"Plug wires, intake ducting, radiator hoses, anything you see when you open the hood of a car that's missing on your kit should be added help recreate a more authentic model. Also, search for images of the engine of the kit you are building so you get an idea of what it should look like."
ModelCars,28nzrc,2manyProjects,1 point,Sat Jun 21 20:54:16 2014 UTC,"Shame no one answered. One technique I heard of was to wash in some very thinned dark water color then lock it in after it dries with some Future floor wax, or clear, or flat clear coat. Some of the detailers also use those, (i forget what they call em) artist paints that come in tubes. Myself, I've been thinking about getting black and other pastels, chalk, and sprinkle that around and maybe move it around with a soft brush. If it looks right I'll lock it in with some clear. Try stuff....necessity is the mother of invention. Shoot, I once threw a hand full of dirt at a model and then it look right."
ModelCars,28d8qi,robo555,2,Tue Jun 17 13:40:53 2014 UTC,"Angus99 left a great reply there and I just wanted to add ""use a dremel if you have access to one"" it really does make the cutting process easier. Other than that - mask well and paint darker colors before lighter ones. I'd actually recommend silver before white but that's just me."
ModelCars,28d8qi,Wired_Wrong,1 point,Tue Jun 17 16:36:52 2014 UTC,"Fair point and good advice.  Also, I should have pointed to r/rccars rather than r/radiocontrol, which is more plane, heli, and multicopter focused."
ModelCars,28d8qi,Angus99,1 point,Tue Jun 17 22:52:21 2014 UTC,"I used a dremel sanding drum to get the gentle curves of the wheel wells and edges rounded off, once I had trimmed the bottom edges by scoring with a new #11 and snapping them off, and used Lexan scissors to get the rough shape.  Check out Excel, (http://excelhobbyblades.com/en) for the scissors."
ModelCars,28d8qi,screamingcheese,1 point,Thu Jun 19 15:49:33 2014 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnlAULx33fw  There's a lot of great youtube videos that show the process, end to end.  This is just one I found with a quick search - be warned, the music is annoying as hell, but it's pretty well shot and step by step.  Also, you might want to go to r/radiocontrol for this question - there's a lot of experienced body painters there.  They make specialty scissors, that are curved, for lexan:  http://www.hobbylinc.com/cgi-bin/s8.cgi?cat_s=RAY&mfg_s=ofn&str_s=dumas%20racing  Any really sharp set will work, the curve is very useful when managing wheel wells, for example.  Perhaps more important is the tool for boring the body mount holes:  http://www.hobbylinc.com/htm/dtx/dtxdtxr1157.htm  You need a really, sharp, finely pointed instrument - lexan will crack, easily, if you are using something too blunt or too wide.   These reamers allow you to slowly expand the hole diameter by carefully turning them as needed.  Yes, you clean up rough edges with a fine file - go slow, and take your time.   Or, for a wheel well, you can take a wooden round dowel, wrap it in sandpaper, and use that to clean them up.  Of the paints you list, PS-2 is probably the deepest, as opposed to the brightest, red.  Regarding the painting process - remember you're painting the inside of the body, so you have to be very careful how you mask.  My two cents would be mask off the white panels and the silver first (very first, of course, would be the windows using the Tamiya provided masks), then spray the red body.   Remove the white masks, spray the white sections, and overspray the red body you've already done.  White behind red tends to help bring out the luster of the red shade.  Finally, remove the silver masking, and spray chrome.   Ideally, you should use chrome, not silver.  Spazsticks makes an excellent chrome.  Chrome is typically backed, finally, with gloss black."

ModelCars,28bgd6,Gumderwear,3,Mon Jun 16 22:18:52 2014 UTC,"There are a couple of things to consider about this stuff (all US based observations):  1) AMT/Ertl is no more.  They became Racing Champs, then RC2, and then sold a bunch of Thomas the Tank Engine toys with lead paint a few years ago if you recall (they did...).  They got bought out by Japan's Tomy company after the lead paint thing.  However, at some point, one of these companies divested the models and diecast to/into Round 2, known as Round 2 Models, which now includes molds and brands from AMT, Polar Lights, Hawk, Lindburg along with diecast cars.  This is all to say, it's not the same company doing it, even though it's the ""same brand.""  I believe that Round 2 is a pretty pro-hobby company, and that they really try to make the products customers want, but they do end up charging a premium for them.  Their 1/350 Enterprises are a great example.  They're certainly not the near Mattel competitor that Ertl once was, and this likely drives their production costs way up.  They also had to finance and purchase these molds, start up their company, etc.  2) Revell USA was bought out by a large company a few years ago (which just bought Revell of Germany as well).  There have been a great number of complaints that their practices are a bit on the profiteering side.  Basically non-hobbyist MBAs are doing what they do to make big money, and don't care about the hobby beyond the fact that they can make money off of it. The same company, by all reports, took over US importation of Hasegawa kits and jacked the prices up quite a bit.  In fact, I can almost guarantee you that it's cheaper to buy and ship a new release Hasegawa kit from HobbyLink Japan than to go buy it at your local hobby shop.  From my understanding, both companies, pro-hobby or not, have admitted to looking at the prices of old molds on eBay in planning re-releases.  It's smart business to use whatever market research is out there.  You'll see high-dollar used-market kits (Revell/Monogram B-52/X-15, 1/72 Shuttle Stack, Atomic Cannon, etc.) reproduced when they're topping $100 on eBay.   I know the prices can be ridiculous, but also know that at least Round 2 is trying to do good.  Your repop Vette probably has better quality tires, redone decals, etc."
ModelCars,28bgd6,240ZED,1 point,Mon Jun 16 23:36:20 2014 UTC,This is really great information! Thank you!  What is your opinion of Tamiya? (Out of curiosity!)
ModelCars,28bgd6,datcivicdoe,3,Tue Jun 17 00:23:05 2014 UTC,"I didn't think to mention, but most of the ""domestic"" kits can be found cheaper at the craft stores.  AC Moore, Hobby Lobby and Michael's run perpetual 40-50% off a single item coupon sales, so a $25 kit is more realistically $13-15.  I also looked at the 63 Vette kit on eBay, and realistically, both the new and the old kit go for about $20 dollars with shipping added, over the last couple months.  You'll always find it cheaper at shows if you really look and hunt, but I'd guess not much cheaper than $10.  Well, Tamiya is fun to talk about as well. Tamiya America, which seems to still be controlled by the Japanese company, on average seems to marked prices up about 75-90% over a straight Yen to USD Conversion. All of the Japanese companies have a ""secret code"" on their packages.  For example, a Tamiya Nissan 370Z will have the part number printed on the package as:  24315*3400  The portion after the star is the MSRP in Yen.  Right now, 100 yen almost $1 US.  So, the Japanese MSRP is under $34 USD.  You'll probably see the kit in a hobby shop at $60 USD - the Tamiya America listed MSRP.  That's about a 75% markup.  If you buy that through HLJ, they discount it 20% to 2720 Yen, but you'll pay 880 Yen shipping, so about $36 USD total and 7-10 days.  I looked at a couple of US websites, and it can be had for $41 fulfilled by Amazon with free shipping (2-7 days).  So there is a lot of room for shopping around and discounts if you're serious.  It's easy to hate on the super high US market Tamiya prices. Smart shopping can get you much closer to the Japanese prices, but I'd wager that if the online US hobby shops are selling at $40-45 on a $60 kit, and I can buy and ship one from Japan for $36, that Tamiya is not making a huge killing off it.  They can ship at a cheaper rate (100s of kits in a single container, not just one in a postal package), but still, how much markup could there be?  Shipped to the US, with any sort of duties they may be charged, with fluctuations in the Yen, etc., they probably end up on our shore just below the Yen MSRP price, and they still have to make their money from wholesaling, while setting a USD MSRP that allows a hobby shop to have a sustainable profit margin.  Just remember, at one point in the not too distant past Tamiya kits (and other Japanese kits) would have been much harder to source from Japan directly (both quickly and safely - i.e., not from an unknown fly-by-night company), and the pricing scheme is probably a throwback to those golden times.  It's no longer as high of a percentage of the import business as the RC stuff, so it's likely not going to be adjusted to be an aggressive money-maker; it's just not their bread and butter, just an also ran.  Tamiya also has said pretty clearly that their business is all about the Japanese market.  They make choices and kits that will appeal to that market, and have limited concern about the international side of things. (Recently they released an aircraft kit without the weapons that they had already designed and made the mold for, just to keep the price at 1800 Yen in Japan, despite the fact that it's a $36 USD-ish MSRP kit here and that extra dollar or two in cost would have added a lot of value in the US market.)  I'm not an expert at all or involved in the business, but I pay attention, and these are the sort of trends I see."

I don't think 27 bucks for a kit is geared to newbs. If you eff it up and get salty, you might just give up as being too expensive and move onto something else without ever really giving it a chance."
ModelCars,28bgd6,dino123,2,Tue Jun 17 00:50:30 2014 UTC,"One thing of note, when AMT/Ertle became RC2, their molding quality dropped dramatically.  Even their newest-tooled kits were absolutely dreadful with flash, mis-aligned tooling, short-shot molds, poor packaging leading to damaged parts, etc.  I've not bothered buying any of their kits since, with the exception of the rare Round 2 vintage kits like the Model T double-kit.  Whenever I can, I get an early-release kit, or just find the same subject matter from Revell-Monogram."

ModelCars,271fqy,FLHKE,2,Sun Jun 1 16:50:05 2014 UTC,"Hiya.....there are lots of Q's with lot's of A's in this sub Reddit. Just search and poke around....but to start you off:  Models are getting more spendy and getting less selection. Pick something you are interested in. Some kits have a skill level number that might help. Don't get something super spendy or something crazy like a Tamiya F-1 car...save that for later. Say you went and picked up a '65 Malibu SS from Revell, that'll run you about 18-25 bucks. That's about the normal price for a basic American made model kit. Ebay is a good place too, but as a newb, just stick with SEALED kits. Over time you will collect extra parts and bits. That can help with customizing and ""kit-bashing"".  Tools and Supplies: Just get the basics for now and work your way up to an airbrush and Dremmel tool....the wait shouldn't be too long. Get an X-acto knife and a few extra #11 blades, a few DECENT paint brushes for the detail work. Maybe a pair of flush snippers for cutting parts off the sprue tree ( nail clippers sorta work, and an X-acto works too ), a bottle of Testors Model Master glue....it's in like a little triangle black plastic bottle with a long tip on it. And a cutting mat/ work surface so you don't scar up the table.   Spray Paint: Spray paint is the best way to paint the body and other large surfaces. I buy a can of the cheapo flat or semi-flat black for all the stuff that should be black. I'd get Testors/Model Master/Tamiya spray paint for the body. I'd suggest you look up a video tutorial on You Tube for some visuals on that process. Just go slow, practice on something else, take your time, build up the paint- don't try to get it all in one go....LET IT DRY!! I paint my body and then build the kit so the body wont get finger prints and scuffs.  I could go on for hours but I don't want to overwhelm you.......ask me anything you need. I can hook you up with some models too if you wish ( I'm thinning down my collection by over half and I have WAAAAAYYYY TOOOO MUUUUUCCCHHH!!!) Good Luck-----we are here for you!"

ModelCars,271fqy,LegalizeGayPot,2,Sun Jun 1 18:24:37 2014 UTC,"well.......if you just picked up the stuff I listed....and maybe did a little shopping a little there ( craft stores have cheaper blades and stuff over hobby shops....tho- keep your hobby shop alive ) I say you are looking at 50-75 bucks. You can use a piece of plywood instead of a cutting mat for now. The other stuff can come later...however a cheap airbrush and Dremmel tool knock off can be found at Harbor Freight tools. The quality isn't as good, but it get's your feet wet. I have to reiterate: a Dremmel and airbrush are not necessary right off the bat.  75 bucks sounds like a lot but you wont have to purchase that stuff again when you go get your next model."

ModelCars,26phxp,screamingcheese,1 point,Thu May 29 02:59:46 2014 UTC,"Thanks  I've looked into bare metal foil but it seems really expensive, like $7 a sheet and the sheet can probably only be used on one model. I think I'll just use lacquer or enamel paint next time unless there's a knockoff alternative or something like that.  On second thought, maybe silver leaf or aluminum leaf would work? Apply a little white glue to the part you want chromed, wait for it to get tacky and then apply a little leaf and use an exacto knife to cut out the rest? Perhaps a heavier gauge leaf so it doesn't rub off very easily, but perhaps that could work."
ModelCars,26phxp,rhs856,2,Thu May 29 04:06:22 2014 UTC,"I've had a sheet for five years, that I'm still using!  I even use it as masking tape for situations that call for really close, highly sensitive areas, or if I need to mask off an area that's hard to see and trace with an Xacto otherwise."
ModelCars,26phxp,z71patt,1 point,Thu May 29 13:52:23 2014 UTC,You will get way more than one model out of a sheet. The trick is cutting it into strips as you use it so less is wasted. I probably get (depending on the decade of car) 6 or more cars out of one sheet.
ModelCars,26phxp,z71patt,1 point,Thu May 29 10:31:50 2014 UTC,"Looking good. I recommend scuffing the tires with light sandpaper like 1000 grit to give them a more rubber look, especially on the treads. Also try a paint by testers called Burnt Umber. I get a bottle of the acrylic one. I dip my brush in it and then in water and brush it over the model, in this case the engine and undercarriage. Gently pat down the areas before they dry to give it a dirty look. I've done it to several models which you can see on my 41 Chevy and my recent jeep project"

ModelCars,25r04x,Joshuadude,2,Fri May 16 22:41:18 2014 UTC,"Acrylic over enamel is fine. If that primer is unopened I get it's also fine, I would use it. Sand with something around 600 to 1200 grit after primer to make sure everything is nice and flat."
ModelCars,25r04x,Shock_and_Awwwwww,1 point,Sat May 17 00:15:06 2014 UTC,"As a general rule, from order of 'hot' to 'benign' paint types, you've got lacquers and urethanes, oil-based enamels, acrylics, then watercolors (had to throw that in, odds are you might try it for washes someday).  When overcoating a 'hot' paint with acrylic, just give it time to finish gassing out it's solvents, which can take 24 hours to a week, depending on paint, how thick it was applied, and even humidity.  That Model Master primer will definitely be enamel.    Going gray before you go white is actually a very good idea! If the plastic is already white, you'll never be able to clearly see exactly how much paint you've put down unless you get some contrast in there.  Also, don't be afraid to tint that white, very few cars were ever truly white, because it masks subtle curves.  I'd just tint the whole bottle, and label that sucker for the tint you used (tan or brown to give it a slightly warmer tone works nicely).  Primer corrects body issues because it's a very heavy bodied paint that acts as a filler for tiny defects, like scratches and minute rippling.  Block sanding it with 1200 grit or higher makes sure to knock down it's tendency to have a slight texture.  You know you're ready for paint when you don't see any issues that would show up if you had painted it in it's color coat already.  Usually, I work over the plastic very thoroughly to remove molding seams and clean up shape issues, and then polish out the scratches as best I can, using up to 4000-grit sanding cloth.  Then, I use flat aluminum as a primer.  It's great, for a number of reasons - it blocks light passing through the plastic, so no risk of interior paint causing the outside to look weird, it's really thin so it doesn't 'swamp' any detail like trim, it gives depth to many metallic finishes (more on that in a sec), and it shows off imperfections like crazy, so I know where I need to fix problems before they get worse.  Metallics, pearls, and candies are translucent, so choose your 'prime' coat wisely.  While not technically primers, you can use flat paint to undercoat, either in a similar shade to the color coat (flat bright blue for blue pearl, for instance), aluminum/silver, or gold.  Sticking with a similar color under it will give richness to the finish, silver is good for 'cool' colors (blues, purples, and greens) because it makes them 'colder,' and gold 'warms' up the warm colors (reds, yellows, oranges).  By block sanding, I mean place a hunk of foam rubber with a flat face behind the sandpaper to make sure your paper is on a consistent plane, so it levels out any imperfections.  When painting bodies, always sand wet, by constantly applying water, and when you need to check your work, wipe down with a microfiber cloth (don't expect that cloth to ever look pretty again).  If the paper seems to 'snag' or 'grab' a lot, the primer hasn't finished curing and gassing, so give it another day.  Wash that body extra well, dry it even better (using lint-free towels only), and paint your color coat on anytime afterwards.   This might seem like a complicated and time-consuming process, but this is the process I use, and you may find with time that you can adapt this or someone else's method to suit your needs more appropriately, and you seem pretty gung-ho to take your work to the next level, I like that.  A lot of folks can get acceptable results from grabbing a rattle can and shooting it in one session, but the step from 'good' to 'great' often requires much more effort than might seem obvious right off the bat.  Once you get it though, that's a high you won't believe.    I used this process on a Cobra that I'm about to post, to give you an idea of the results - the exception with it is, I used flat red as a color coat, polished it smooth with a flannel cloth, then used seven layers of lacquer clearcoat to give it gloss and depth, block-sanding at 4000 and 6000 grit between every other coat.     Needless to say, I start painting the body before putting any other parts together, and by the time I'm done with it, I'll have had the frame assembled and ready for days, if not weeks!"
ModelCars,25r04x,screamingcheese,1 point,Sat May 17 11:55:41 2014 UTC,"Man you are a freakin' book full of knowledge aren't you? I greatly appreciate all of the info. I have another question in regards to sanding and priming -  You said that priming is good for removing tiny defects such as scratches and minute rippling.. I just inspected my Tamiya Nissan GTR body last night and it has a few slight swirls in it a lot like this plane has. (Cant take a photo of it because it's still in the plastic - but I can remove it if need be) Will priming and sanding work for removing something such as this? I remember somewhere (or maybe you told me, cant remember haha) that you would start with around 600 grit and go up from there stopping at around 10000.. following the block sanding process you explained, would this be the proper way to remove such a defect?  Also when you say I should tint my white - I currently have a Tamiya rattle can that I was going to use - do you mean I should tint that? If so, I am ignorant as to how. If you are referring to tinting a bottle though, no further explanation is needed! I have the TS 26 white, but I can also go get their pearl white if that would be better.. it looked a little more off white.  Edit: Also when sanding, how do I know when I am finished with the process/how do I know how hard to sand? Do I completely sand off the first coat of primer, down to the white body? Or do I just kind of sand it until I can no longer see the imperfection with the primer on? I am assuming the block sanding will create that level surface between the ripple and the rest of the body?  Edit #2: I am pretty much using you as a guide for my model by the way haha. I used to build models often, but I never really got too detailed with them. I always wanted to build amazing models but I never really had the capital to do it correctly, but now I have the money and the time so I want to start producing what my mind envisions!"
ModelCars,25r04x,screamingcheese,1 point,Sat May 17 23:22:00 2014 UTC,"Those are flow marks, created when the plastic injected from more than one place meets - the 'particulate,' or whatever you might call it, creates a grain, which faces different directions due to flowing into the mold from different places.  Even a light coat of paint will cover that without issue.  It's a common thing to see, especially when you're working with models molded in silver plastic.    TS-26 is actually already tinted from pure white, actually, so you're good to go there.  It's REALLY subtle, but still won't hide little nuances in a car's shape.    When sanding, start light, otherwise you'll create deep grooves in the surface that are hard to remove.  Only sand through when you need to correct serious shape issues.  I'd be shocked if you ever find a Tamiya model that needs that sort of treatment!  Their kits have some of the highest quality bodies, most of which can be painted straight out of the box with hardly a moment's cleanup.  I hope I'm not overwhelming you, keep in mind that the only truly wrong way to do things is when you don't like the results.  Above all, the important thing is, do it, see it through, all the way to the end.  Even if you think it's not coming out like you wanted, just keep going.  You'll be glad you did."

ModelCars,25nzup,smedema,2,Fri May 16 17:03:39 2014 UTC,"IMO enamels suck. I have found that they take forever to dry and they are a pain to clean up. I know they are more durable and last longer but IMO it isn't worth it. With this said, I use as many acrylic paints I can when building models (when I don't I use lacquers). Now that I just bought an airbrush it makes it a lot easier because hand painting sucks. If you do hand paint prime your pieces before painting and thin out the paints (with distilled water, alcohol or windex). Also they are way more forgiving. All you have to do is wet a paper towel with water and wipe it off. The only drawback I have found with acrylics is that they don't stick to the plastic as well as enamels or lacquer but it should cause any problems. So yeah make the switch. It will save you tons of pain and frustration."
ModelCars,25nzup,smedema,1 point,Fri May 16 01:41:15 2014 UTC,Yeah I think I definitely will. Do you have any recommendation for like an acrylic bundle?

You can get model masters at any Hobby Lobby. I think they are great and you don't have thin them. I tend to only get Tamiya paints online and for specific colors. Also if you get serious about this hobby, I would highly recommend getting an airbrush. I just got a cheap one off ebay for $90 and I get a great finish."

ModelCars,25ki79,_Hank_Scorpio,1 point,Wed May 14 21:32:25 2014 UTC,"I personally never wear gloves, I feel they would get in the way. However solvents can seriously hurt your hands so take precautions when using things like paint thinner. I once cleaned a motorcycle air filter with castrol super clean and my bare hands, they felt waxy the next day, and my skin peeled off and was sore for about a week after.   Also I think putting BBs in paint is a great idea- I've never heard of it effecting the paint either. They do this from the factory with metal ball bearings in nail polishes."
ModelCars,25ki79,Mschultz33c,1 point,Wed May 14 21:17:22 2014 UTC,I use latex gloves when handling painted and chrome parts. I also clear coat the chrome parts (Krylon acrylic crystal clear) before removing any from the trees.  Usually assemble sub-assemblies then clean them.

ModelCars,24tr7w,peedeearr,2,Tue May 6 02:44:22 2014 UTC,Thanks will give that a shot.
ModelCars,24tr7w,Mschultz33c,2,Tue May 6 03:06:34 2014 UTC,I have actually always been told that superglue eventually deteriorates. May not be true and I haven't exactly been using it long enough to know myself but just what I've been told.
ModelCars,24tr7w,peedeearr,2,Tue May 6 04:24:27 2014 UTC,I've been using it for 20+ years now with little problem. Being a glue rather than a cement could possibly be the issue you've heard about.
ModelCars,24tr7w,screamingcheese,2,Tue May 6 11:08:31 2014 UTC,"I use multiple kinds of adhesives, depending on the application.  My go-to plastic cement is the Tamiya liquid cement, in the little square bottle.  For CA, in applications where quick hold or 'easy removal' is necessary, I use medium-viscosity CA glue, so I don't glue my fingers to the part.    Other modelers in my club like Tenax as well, and the armor guys say that the easiest way to apply individual-link tracks is to line them all up in a jig and apply Testors liquid cement to them, since it has a longer working time.    Super glue (or CA)'s reputation for deteriorating may be due to lack of surface prep.  Since it's not a 'weld' bond, but rather a 'glue,' it does require something to bite into.  It's not expressly required to clean or rough up the surface, but it will help.  slightly rough textures tend to bond better than smooth ones, and using accelerator chemicals on them will make for weaker bonds as well.  When I paint model cars, I usually build a stand out of spare bits of sprue, then CA glue them to the inside of the body and kick it off with CA accelerator.  Then, when the painting is done, I just break it off!"

ModelCars,22kzqf,Teddy_Westside7,5,Wed Apr 9 04:45:44 2014 UTC,"To paint a body the number one thing you don't want to do is use brush paint. Be sure you have spray paint or an airbrush.   No matter what anybody else tells you, the key is VERY thin coats of paint until you get the coverage you want. Never try to totally cover a body on the first pass. Spray painting isn't as simple as pressing the nozzle and spraying away. When painting bodies be sure to keep the nozzle's distance from the work as consistent as possible, working back and forth or up and down. Never a combination of the two. If you run into a deep corner or curve in the body NEVER try to get closer to the work to get paint in it, just change your angle and keep the layers thin.  The way I usually paint a body is. Use some sort of de greaser and hot water to get any oil and crap off of the plastic body. Making sure to get into all the cracks and corners. Make sure you dry it well and then let it air dry even more. (hickies in a paint job really bother me.) Then spray on a few thin coats of white or primer to get a neutral color underneath your body color. Let that dry for quite awhile. I usually go a whole day.  Then I go and spray the actual body color, getting at the cracks and corners and edges first with as thin a coat of paint as I can get. (Getting really thin coats is a matter of how far you hold your spray can from your work and how fast you move across it, the farther/faster the thinner). I let that dry for at least 4 hours.  After that I continue to spray on multiple thin coats but I make them slightly heavier each time. Letting them dry for at least 4 hours each. sometimes I even let them go a full 24 hours before spraying again.   When you use spray paint, streaks and ""bumps""/drops form from the paint being too heavy. The idea behind the thin coats is to make sure that the paint is so light that it can't run. Don't be afraid to lay down like ten coats if you need to. So long as they are thin you should get a really nice, smooth looking paint job.   Just remember that many thin coats are better than one thick one.  EDIT: Spraying bodies is mostly a matter of personal experience and preferences as to how it's done. This is just the way I do it and what I find to work for me."
ModelCars,22kzqf,ImTheNewishGuy,1 point,Wed Apr 9 05:16:45 2014 UTC,"Thank you for such a detailed response.   So if I wanted to paint something red, I should pick up a can of spray paint?"
ModelCars,22kzqf,ImTheNewishGuy,2,Wed Apr 9 05:38:23 2014 UTC,Yup. I would go specifically for model paint. Not just any old spray paint. Testors makes the little shorty cans but they are kind of expensive. Though they have specific colors that you wouldn't normally find like metallics and matte colors.

ModelCars,22a6s4,outrider2400,2,Sun Apr 6 19:41:58 2014 UTC,I'm curious as to how you did the weathering on the exhaust.  Any tips?
ModelCars,22a6s4,Joshuadude,2,Sun Apr 6 19:23:45 2014 UTC,"I got the method from one of Adam Savage's tested videos on Youtube. He was weathering a case for an old microscope but I figured that it would work all the same for model car parts.  He said to just take nasty, dirty colors, water them down and dab them into cracks and corners, then quickly, before they dry, wipe off as much as possible (I used Q-tips). It's next to impossible to get all of it off so whats left over adds a bit of age to the work. Depending on what colors you use and how you mix them, you can end up with a pretty convincing paint job. I have also thought about scrapping rust off the bottom of my real car and trying to find a way to make that work.  There is also this guy,   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhSDcIRUQM0  He uses salt and rubber cement and multiple layers of paint to rust car bodies.

ModelCars,22a6s4,JabbaTheWhat01,1 point,Sun Apr 6 19:54:47 2014 UTC,"One tip I've heard fairly consistently is to paint a base layer of whatever color rust or undercoat you want to show up, and then put some water on that coat (the water should be where you want the chipping effect to be) after it has dried and then put some salt where the water is and then paint over it. Give it some time to dry and then chip the salt away to reveal your ""rust!"" Google the salt weathering method for a more detailed explanation."

ModelCars,21s9oz,dj-almondcrunch,1 point,Sun Mar 30 23:40:13 2014 UTC,the Ferrari F1 kits by tamiya are pretty good.    I built the f2001.   was very happy with the details and quality of the kit
ModelCars,21s9oz,Jbx1,1 point,Mon Mar 31 01:05:17 2014 UTC,"Hello, I just started making model F1 cars too. I have done 3 so far and for the most part the last two have turned out alright. It seems that model companies don't make kits for the new cars like they used to. The most recent car I have found is a 2013 Ferrari F138 by Fujimi. They also make a couple Saubers too and a Red Bull RB6. Cars from the 70's, 80's, and 90's are the most abundant by far. All of the ones I have done have been from the late 80's and early 90's.    In addition I would strongly recommend Tamiya's lotus 99t. It's a great and beautiful car to start with partly because it has a pretty simple paint scheme."
ModelCars,21s9oz,smedema,1 point,Mon Mar 31 01:20:30 2014 UTC,"There's only one '13 car out and that's a Fujimi F138. So my guess is there won't be that many 14 cars available for a while. I started with a Tamiya Honda 272 RA (I think?) from the mid 60s. I think it took maybe 20 hours to complete. I'd suggest sticking with the older cars until you get a feel for how well developed these things can be. I just finished an Ebbro Lotus 72C from 1970 and while it took me forever to complete, it was a fairly simple kit, it was just the details that killed me. That one took about 8 months to do, and a lot of time off.     I decided to take an F1 breather and built a Skyline R32. Took about 5 hours max.   That should give you an idea on the details involved in these things. Stick with Tamiya for now till you get your feet wet. You'll be fine after that."
ModelCars,21s9oz,Corz69,1 point,Mon Mar 31 02:26:37 2014 UTC,Ya I just got into modeling just a few months ago and thought they came out with new kits more often than what they do but they don't.   Which I understand I can only imagine the engineering that goes into some of these kits. Then the tooling is another story. I'm a toolmaker for a living and it's a very long process. And even after it's built there might be some troubleshooting.   Tamiya has quite a few cool f1 kits. But they can be pretty daunting to a beginner with some of the paint schemes and they have a lot of graphics for the most part.
ModelCars,21s9oz,Bdj531,1 point,Mon Mar 31 23:38:39 2014 UTC,Ya Tamiya's FW13B was the third model I had ever made and I only wanted to shoot myself 17 times.

I was made the ""team leader"" for those who got to work with it.   It's a damn nice car but they are just terrible to work on. They have a really primitive fuel injection system and to get the spark plugs out you had to remove every piece of the FIS. I would have loved to have actually driven that car, if it wasn't for dumbass high schoolers screwing around with all the parts and letting them go missing. I can honestly say that XJ's are beautiful cars and I didn't know what I had my hands all over until I finally looked up Jaguar XJS's and saw that they are pretty valuable cars. Sadly enough the car was rolled into Hell the second it was driven through our shop door and parked.  Moral of the story: Don't give classic European cars to high school auto shops."

ModelCars,21n177,schwack,2,Sat Mar 29 06:27:32 2014 UTC,"Thanks! The interior was a lot of work, I sprayed all the seats, but then decided on the flat read instead. I also had to carve ~1mm of of each side of the base to get them to fit. On the engine, I had to cut a bunch out of the oil pan and the front suspension to fit the GT500 engine, and cut a bunch off the blower body for it all to fit. Luckily there was already a hole in the hood so I could just Dremel it bigger. The other challenge was the light system, it was a real pain but I think I've got the hang if it now. With LEDs the lights can only connect to the battery one way, not like incandescent Christmas lights. But it seems pretty solid. Overall I'm pretty happy with it - call it the FireFord :D"
ModelCars,21n177,schwack,2,Sat Mar 29 14:26:37 2014 UTC,"You did a great job!  I'm in the middle of a 67 Shelby GT-500, had to get the engine custom molded from a resin caster.  Perfect mold of all the parts.  Was my first experience with resin.  Used Bleche White to prep the resin parts for painting.  Even  went so far as to drill holes below the headers, insert small spark plug boots, and ran wires to the distributor.  It came out OK.  I'm fairly new to modeling, did it as a kid, now back in it for the last 8 months or so, and I love it.  Anyhow the Shelby is a gift for my sister, painted in Tamiya Pearlescent Purple, with a dark gray interior.  I've laid down flocking after painting the floorboard and base of the chassis dark grey, to give it a carpeting look.  I think it came out pretty well.  Still much more to do on it, got sidetracked on another truck I was working on, but I switched back.  Perhaps one day I'll post the Shelby on here when she's done."
ModelCars,21cx3e,smedema,5,Tue Mar 25 21:44:08 2014 UTC,"I assume the lettering is raised, if not, this won't do, but dry brushing would likely be your best bet. It will paint only raised surfaces. Dip the brush in the paint lightly, wipe on the inside of the jar lip, then drag across a napkin or paper towel until there is hardly any paint when you wipe, then gently drag across the raised surface. Repeat until the desired color heaviness is reached. Tamiya paints are difficult to work with, like this, so I would recommend polyscale or model masters."

ModelCars,20iwb3,smedema,3,Sun Mar 16 02:18:57 2014 UTC,"Oh hellz yes.....no, really...you can use other rattle can paint. I recommend staying away from Rustoleum products. I know that most of their stuff has an additive that actually prevents a full cure on the paint. Somehow that makes it more impervious to water and rust...hence the name. For primers I use cheapo 3 dollar flat black or white. I use cheapo semi-gloss black for all chassis and wheels...etc. I tend to stick with the same brand of primer as color to avoid issues, but that's not carved in stone. ALWAYS test paint a piece before committing. I used to use rattle can of lacquer for AMAZING finishes, but you can't buy it anymore......That stuff will eat plastic models if NOT properly primed. Stay away form OUTDOOR paint, PLASTIC paint and use enamels. Krylon rules. I use it for NERF guns, Models, Guitars..it's all good. YES-save yourself some dough. YES- do test pieces. YES- use other paint. You can even end up using REAL car paint for models with your new airbrush you just graduated to......though, that's a nice learning curve. EDIT: I also recommend sticking with a Tamiya or Testors Silver paint. Most other silver has curing issues. You paint it...you wait 3 weeks....you pick it up and STILL get silver on your hands. That crappy silver also shows imperfections more that the small cans. I think the model stuff IS geared for models and it's a better quality than most big cans of ANY brand name. ( sorry...spray paint is my life......wear a respirator!)"
ModelCars,20iwb3,Gumderwear,1 point,Sun Mar 16 04:53:21 2014 UTC,So is krylon color masters line alright. It is acrylic not enamel.
ModelCars,20iwb3,Gumderwear,1 point,Tue Mar 18 00:35:37 2014 UTC,"Should be.....always test, especially if you clear coat. You don't wanna mix acrylic with enamels I would think. Like a gloss clear coat of enamel over acrylic. That might eat the paint. Might not."
ModelCars,20iwb3,peedeearr,1 point,Tue Mar 18 02:29:52 2014 UTC,Ya I know what you mean. I just like to stay away from enamels because they take so damn long to cure (at least model masters does).

ModelCars,20iwb3,Gumderwear,1 point,Sun Mar 16 10:44:50 2014 UTC,The short answer is yes. The longer answer has already been addressed by /u/Gumderwear. I will add that it seems that the paint in the Krylon type rattle cans is thicker and it is easy to get runs and orange peel when used on a small model kit. Remember that these products are made for painting 'life-size' items and will throw more paint than is needed for a scale car body. Just make quicker passes with the can.

ModelCars,20aci2,rhs856,1 point,Thu Mar 13 13:45:43 2014 UTC,"I think I found the problem - if you're using this, it's oil-based. I don't know what you put on top of it, but if it wasn't oil-based (I would guess it to be enamel, lacquer, or acrylic) it was destined to cause a reaction.  Here's my $.02:  The primers I use are Krylon(any color, but I usually use white or gray), and Model Masters Metalizer line (use a light touch with this, a little goes a long way). I don't use anything that says ""sandable"" or ""automotive"" because those tend to cure hotter and could melt plastic.  Can you paint over the bare plastic? Hell, yes. You need to prep the body the same way you normally would with primer, though. Clean up any lines/problems, carefully sand it up to a couple thousand grit to make it nice and smooth, and then use a lacquer or enamel based paint (I have not used acrylic on bare plastic, it may work). This was painted with enamel on bare white plastic metalizer."
ModelCars,20aci2,rhs856,1 point,Thu Mar 13 17:03:02 2014 UTC,I used both lacquer and enamels. The enamels were fine just the lacquer bubbled. I also heard that white primers are bad. Is that true?

ModelCars,1z4yb4,kirbyforlife69,2,Fri Feb 28 10:07:12 2014 UTC,"A tip i wish i would have been told when i started: Less paint is better, You can always go back and add a second coat or touch up later.   Much harder to take paint off.  nice paintbrushes of varying sizes are always good. a SHARP blade I like to used toothpicks to apply the glue,  makes it easy to place small amount exactly where i want it."
ModelCars,1z4yb4,Jbx1,1 point,Fri Feb 28 22:41:55 2014 UTC,"First off, good on you for trying again. The main thing is learning from what went wrong on your previous attempts so you don't have repeats.   The main tools in my arsenal when building a model is an X-Acto knife, some Ambroid Pro Weld or Tenax 7R cement, a set of paint brushes, some super glue and some 320 grit sandpaper.   For painting I like to use spray cans for as much of the model as I can, you'll get a much more even coating than brushing.   Main thing is just to take your time and have fun with it, if you get frustrated take a break and step back from it. Take a look at as many photos of the real car as possible so you can get a good idea of how you want to paint your model."
ModelCars,1ykddc,Joegran,2,Fri Feb 21 20:38:33 2014 UTC,"I have not done this, but I have heard of people doing it and getting decent results. Here are the tips I remember:   Thin the paint a bit if you need to. Make sure it's warm. Many thin coats. Brush strokes are the enemy. Brush the paint on and let it settle. Don't keep brushing it around.   Will it look terrible? Possibly, the first time you do it. But it has been done and with some practice you could get it down.  Option B: Do you have access to a balcony or the outside at all? If so, I would put the car on a bent coat hanger, warm up some spray paint and paint it outside anyway. Put a coat of paint on the car, and come inside. Repeat as necessary. Downside is your apartment will stink like paint.  Option C is to work on the rest of the model (if you haven't already) and save the body for spring. Then, spend your summer painting a bunch of extra bodies so you can finish them in the winter.  Hope this helps."
ModelCars,1ykddc,rhs856,2,Fri Feb 21 21:31:02 2014 UTC,"I've heard of people using brush paint and then sanding it down and eventually polishing it.  It will be a lot of work, but if you buff it out you could eventually get it to look good I would imagine."
ModelCars,1ykddc,Mrslinger85,2,Fri Feb 21 22:17:30 2014 UTC,"I made my own paint booth that vents outside. Poster board, duct taped together in a spray paint booth configuration. Cut a hole in the back and stick a $30 bathroom ceiling fan in there. Make a wood panel to fit in the window when it's open. Cut a hole for the ducting. Have the ducting go from the fan, through the board in the window. This will vent all the fumes outside, and the board will keep some of the cold out."
ModelCars,1ykddc,NoGoddamnNamesLeft,1 point,Thu Feb 27 00:25:18 2014 UTC,"This is what I would do. You will never be able to get a  smooth paint job with a brush, period.

ModelCars,1y469x,schwack,2,Mon Feb 17 20:40:53 2014 UTC,"Heres my process First I painted everything flat rust (Testor's enamel). I mixed sugar with water and brushed it on where I wanted rust. I usually don't give it time to dry so around 10 minutes after I have that on there I spray on my color (2 coats). After half an hour I take like a toothpick or something to scrap with and scrap off the mounds of sugar. I rinse off the model to get off any left over sugar. This process allows the paint to look flaky around the rust areas. After that I dip my brush in Burnt Umber (Testors acrylic) and then into water. I brush it all over the model (I do it a section at a time IE top then side then back etc). I then immediately pat down the model with a paper towel. I do not remember the other color I use, but it is some kind of yellow or something. I use this color for streaking (where rust runs down the paint). That's all I've mastered so far. I also found some cheap fabric for the seats and smeared Goop (kind of a rubbery glue) all over the seat and massaged the fabric onto it"

ModelCars,1xkjdp,zwashburn,3,Tue Feb 11 01:08:12 2014 UTC,"I use aluminum tubing from the hobby store. You can sacrifice an X-acto blade to cut them. There is an art to that, so practice. I make distributors out of aluminum tubing and wire and a dab of glue. As for any detail painting, you need to invest in a decent brush for fine detail work. Keep it cleaner than clean, treat it well and it will treat you well. Then pop the hood on the family car and look at the battery. Or hit the interwebs on a car parts store web page and look at batteries there. I have seen photoetched fan assembly's that work, but they are spendy and somewhat pointless unless you are doing an open engine bay motor. You can teach yourself a new trick with the kits fan blade, a micro drill bit and some of that aluminum tubing. You can then make fan belts from masking tape painted black, or a rubber band...or?? Hinges are tricky but not impossible. The difficult part would be to explain it to you in text. That is also what I would call a more advance detailing. You have to fit the interior tub and the hood together and make sure there's room to play. Then bend some wire shapes....blah blah blah.....I will tell you this. You need this 1991 issue of Car Modeler. It taught me all that stuff and more. It actually led me into a career building models for a living.

ModelCars,1xdu20,zwashburn,3,Sat Feb 8 21:33:49 2014 UTC,"Michael's crafts, if you have one nearby.  You don't need the fancy stuff yet, just some glue a few bottles of Testor's enamel (they sell starter kits), some cheap paintbrushes, and a couple of rattle cans. Also, get a foam core board - they have one for $2.99 - they make great work surfaces. They have a selection of X-Acto knives and sandpapers too.  Alligator clips, coathangers and other stuff lying around the house can be useful for holding parts while the paint dries. Toothpicks have 1001 uses, from dabbing glue to holding up parts.  You can build a ""paint booth"" out of a cardboard box. Make sure you have something to put over your parts while they dry to keep dust off (I use an upside plastic storage tub).  The most important thing is to have fun, enjoy, and relax. Some folks like to listen to music when they work, some like the quiet solace.   The other most important thing is don't get mad when you screw up. I just ruined a pristine paint finish with an accidental drop of glue. For about 2 seconds I wanted to throw it across the room; instead I laughed, cleaned it up with sandpaper and resprayed it.  Depending on your age, you might want to get tips about working with the hazardous stuff - razors, paints, etc.  If you're experienced, then you'll know about cutting away from flesh, not inhaling fumes, etc."

I took the photo of the logo, reduced to about 1.5"" in length and printed it on the decal sheet.  I gave the ink about 2 hours to dry, then I coated the images with Testor's spray clear gloss lacquer.  Gave that a day, then snipped and put the decals on with Micro-Sol.  Without the Micro-Sol, the edges would curl up, so I dabbed the MS onto the decal liberally with a brush, working from the center to the edges.  Came out really nice.

ModelCars,1wrvj9,disgustipated,7,Sun Feb 2 02:06:26 2014 UTC,"OK...easy peasy. Get some WATER based craft paint.....Flat Black. Usually about a dollar. You want it thin enough to slow flow but not too thin. Get the paint down in that grill....down in the crevasses. Now with a tissue, paper towel, soft rag or Q-tip you want to wipe away the black from the raised part of the grill while the paint is still wet, taking care NOT to get the part you want black. By using water based paint you can wash it and dry it and do it over if there is a kerfuffle. You need to make sure the paint is dry to put a second coat on. A hair dryer speeds this up.  I am a pro and I can do this with flat enamel model paint but you can fugg stuff up....the solvents in the black enamel with take the chrome off if you do it too many times. Good luck, matey."
ModelCars,1wrvj9,Gumderwear,3,Sun Feb 2 02:56:25 2014 UTC,"Came here to say exactly this. Also if it's testors flat black acryl, you can just scratch any paint off you might miss while it's wet.

I use double-sided tape to stick them to bamboo skewers which I can stick into foam blocks to hold them upright.  Then it's easy to spray and paint everything quickly.  http://i.imgur.com/lAxo2Mj.jpg"
ModelCars,1v1704,blumenfe,2,Tue Feb 18 00:23:35 2014 UTC,This method looks great I'll have to try it on my next model!
ModelCars,1v1704,uncleawesome,1 point,Mon Mar 17 22:12:00 2014 UTC,I usually prime and paint everything while still on the sprue. Except car bodies or airplane exteriors. I scrape the paint off where the glue goes to let it bond well.
ModelCars,1v1704,uncleawesome,1 point,Mon Jan 13 06:20:52 2014 UTC,Do you touch up where you cut off the sprue?
ModelCars,1v1704,Mschultz33c,1 point,Mon Jan 13 13:06:02 2014 UTC,Yup.
ModelCars,1v1704,Turbojett,1 point,Mon Jan 13 13:07:03 2014 UTC,"I usually cut the parts seperate but leave them on the tree so it's easier to paint them. Then I glue them together and if the 2 parts are the same colour I might even paint over the joint just in case any glue is visible. Also if it's something like a frame and underside and a multitude of parts need to be the exact same colour I might use a rattle can for appearance and time. That way it's guaranteed they all have the same finish. Also with bodies if the bumpers or something need to be glued on, I'd probably glue and sand them before spray painting."
ModelCars,1ulsro,notaspookorgook,1 point,Tue Jan 7 06:00:07 2014 UTC,"One is really shiny, like wet paint, and one is between flat and gloss, sorta like leather. Gloss black would be something like the frame or chassis and semi would be something like a leather interior."
ModelCars,1u8sof,oloshan,1 point,Thu Jan 2 18:11:06 2014 UTC,I saw this bit of creativity in a shop window in Philly on NYE. Nice detail on the attachments of the megaphone!
ModelCars,1u8sof,schwack,1 point,Thu Jan 2 18:11:49 2014 UTC,This is awesome.  I'd love to build this and have it in a diorama.
ModelCars,1tx83c,notaspookorgook,3,Sun Dec 29 04:43:35 2013 UTC,"Well you've definitely identified 1 area that will result in much better models. Priming not only makes painting easier, it lets you use less paint which also results in a more detailed surface. Everyone has their own preferences but for primers Im using ""Mr White Surface 1000"" with Tamiya TS series paints. When priming over black plastic I usually use some grey primer first, then white.. the white doesn't like to cover black on its own.   Sandpaper - from 3400 to 12000 grit - don't think, just buy it...  I used this:  http://italianhorses.net/Tutorials/PerfectPaint/paint.htm  tutorial for the polishing process, except I actually use tooth paste for the final polishing step followed by NU-Finish automotive wax, works like a charm.   Another trick I've picked up since I started taking models more seriously in my old age, is proper decal application techniques. Again  Micro-Sol and Micro-Set products - don't think, buy them.  The Set solution will soften a decal to conform to the surface better, while the Sol solution will dissolve the gel from the decal and leave the color behind. This single trick made me stop fearing large decals.   The most important skill should come more easily now at 23 than it did when you were a kid, patience.. Take your time, build systematically, allow things to dry before working with them... etc. Google can be a tremendous help as I guarantee there isn't anything you'd do to a model that someone else hasn't done and documented before you.   Good Building..  EDIT: You can see my Tamiya GTR on the main page if your interested."
ModelCars,1tx83c,Wired_Wrong,1 point,Sun Dec 29 17:11:50 2013 UTC,Thanks for all the advice. Where could I pick up sandpaper in those grits? Btw that gtr is amazing. The one I have is the recent gtr
ModelCars,1tx83c,rhs856,2,Sun Dec 29 17:48:04 2013 UTC,Hobby store or online for the sand paper. Look for a polishing kit that had the grits you need.
ModelCars,1tx83c,fattyfatkid02,1 point,Sun Dec 29 21:02:47 2013 UTC,"Do you set decals after the last wetcoat of paint, and then spray a coat of clear over the decals then final polish? Or is there a wetsand between final color coat and decals? I guess this tutorial doesnt include clear or decals, what is the right order?"
ModelCars,1tx83c,LotusOplenty,1 point,Wed Jan 22 01:16:48 2014 UTC,I've had good luck just checking out youtube. A neat trick was to use the top lid of a spray can and tape the models inner roof to that. Then you can hit all the lower parts of the body.
ModelCars,1tx83c,Wired_Wrong,1 point,Sun Dec 29 14:52:29 2013 UTC,"I use toothpicks pressed into a cardboard box, same idea.. I've also seen coat hanger wire stands that people with more time than me have built for that."

RIDICULOUSLY WELL.  if you can find the episode with the build of a tamiya ft86, you'll look at model cars in a whole new way."

I saw many models in those pics that I built as a child/teen in the '60s and '70s.  Somewhere I have a picture of 7-year-old me in the Silhouette Show Car.  My main interest in your collection would be any 1970's era NHRA Funny Cars and Dragsters, as well as those sweet Can Am cars like the McLaren and Chapparal. Oh, and the Cherry Bomb. And Silhouette.

ModelCars,1snn0e,kirbyforlife69,1 point,Thu Dec 12 12:01:32 2013 UTC,I'm eyeballing that part and I think some plexi or lexan plastic thats as thick as the light is tall would work. He'd have to polish the plastic after making the cuts then use clear blue paint on it.

ModelCars,1pv6ic,kirbyforlife69,2,Mon Nov 4 08:50:26 2013 UTC,"A food dehydrator is an invaluable investment. Ones with temp controls are the best, because you want to keep it on low. I've heard the Ronco one is fine if you keep the vents open, but I would test something you don't care about ruining before putting your pride and joy in there. At the minimum, put a thermometer in there and assess the situation.  My models go from being airbrushed (enamel) straight into the dehydrator and are rock hard in 6-12 hours.  As a side note, be very careful of the oven. Only use it for the pilot heat - do not turn it on. My dehydrator runs at 95 degrees, and the low in my oven is 170 degrees. That is a huge difference and can result in warping."

ModelCars,1oo3b7,MisterLaz,4,Thu Oct 17 20:40:00 2013 UTC,"Welcome to the subreddit!  I think I can answer a couple of your questions about paint.  Some people swear by doing it outside when the weather is nice, especially in the cooler months, where humidity and dust aren't as prevalent.  I personally paint indoors.  I picked up a paint booth from Amazon for under 80 bucks and it works great!  I just vent the fumes outside through a partially opened window with the vent the booth comes with.  Paint booth from Amazon  As for preparing the body.  I've always been told to wash and dry the parts involved first with soap and water, then allow to dry completely.  You can accelerate this with a dust free cloth or hair dryer, pick your poison.  Then sand the body with a 600 grit grade of sandpaper, rinse again, and wet sand (body and paper are wet with 1000-1200 grit)  Once that's done, you're ready for priming.  Model builders who are way better at this than me typically recommend 1-2 coats of primer, the color depends on the body color.  So for bright colors, use a white primer.  For darker colors, use a grey primer.  After you've primed a couple times, its time to take the body and sand it again, with 1200 grit.  Get it all smooth, then shoot the color.  First three coats are mist coats, sprayed 10-12 inches from the model, very light coats.  After that comes 2 or 3 wet coats, sprayed closer to the model, careful not to overpaint or you'll get dripping or pooling in some spots.  There are lots of forums for modelers, including this one.  The mods here put together a painting FAQ you can see on the right side of this page.  I like your truck!  Looks great!  I hope some of these answers help."
ModelCars,1oo3b7,schwack,2,Thu Oct 17 21:36:11 2013 UTC,"1) Either go outside or try to make your own paintbooth if its inside.  I've seen people go as far as to make paint booths with fans that direct air out windows.  2.  I would always use primer 3. I usually sand after primer to smooth it out.  Coats really are up to you.  I usually do 3 or so, but I also polish the paint after I apply it, so I need to have thick enough to paint so that I don't polish through.  Clear is a personal preference.  I hardly ever use the stuff.   Looking at that photo, I think what would help would be to sand it with higher grit sandpaper like, 600 or so lightly.  Then, go back and up it to like 1000 grit.  After that, if its pretty smooth, I would try rubbing compound or polish.  Your paint just looks too thick.  When you are sparying, don't try to have the spray go in one spot for too long or it will build up.  Instead, what I do is almost like whisping it, I move it over quickly and kinda do that until its got a good amount of paint. At about 0:44 this video demonstrates a bit of what I mean."

TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN PAINTING DO NOT RUSH IT!  Tips: Use Testors clear window glue for all your windows DO NOT USE CRAZY GLUE or TESTORS glue cuz it will make your windows look nasty  if u are going to use crazy glue for extra gluing power i suggest you use Brush crazy clue or Gel crazy glue   if u live in a place where there is lots of dirt i suggest you buy an airbrush kits to paint inside. at one point if u use can spray your going to have health issues, getting high off the paint  just like schwack said get an paint both or make one yourself theres take a look in YouTube and you can find how to make one!  hope this helps PM me is u need tips"

ModelCars,1nvn4t,JZagor,1 point,Mon Oct 7 01:18:16 2013 UTC,"Do this first: make a spreadsheet of each car, (make, model, toy manufacturer, condition, scale, stock numbers, colors, etc.) then, hate to tell you, but your best bet is to find each car on eBay, check the completed and sold auctions, and see what's got any value.  Record this in your spreadsheet for you only.  Post your your spreadsheet as a list of what you have (but not the prices, save that for your information only) to forums for diecast or collectible toy cars, etc.  Offer your list, explain where you got them from, see if anyone will make offers or buy the whole collection.  These guys are in it for their own collections, and will likely offer the best prices.  If they demand you list asking prices (some forums require this), take your eBay values, add 20-30% and let people know you're motivated and you'll take offers and make discounts for large purchases.  Again, be honest you're trying to move a collection that you inherited, but also do some homework on what similar/same items are going for  I'd move on to eBay if you get no responses.  Also consider flea markets, toy shows, etc at this stage.  Finally, if you get no bites at all or eBay is too much work (it's easier than college...), send the list to various collectibles dealers.  If they're mostly NASCAR cars, focus on those guys, Hot Wheels, focus on those dealers, more general toys, find collectible toy dealers.  You're just sending an email asking if they have any interest in anything, so send a lot to anyone that might be a seller.  Just remember it's like Pawn Stars to these guys - oh, a $5000 one of a kind item, I'll give you $1500, I have to make a profit... See what sort of offers you get, judge the values based on what you've seen on eBay.    There are price guides, but I've never been impressed with them, out of date day one.  Depending on what you have exactly, you might be able to attend a toy an collectibles auction. Many of the big car auctions (Barrett-Jackson, Mecum) also auction collectibles, but are likely looking for amazing/rare/valuable stuff.  Long ago, http://www.gomotorbids.com/ use to buy collections, but they seem to have been bought out and are somehting else now.  Do a bit of sleuthing on Google and you might find forum discussions about what has replaced that company in the buying niche.  Also, for specific places to start once you make your list, I use to frequent a 1/18 scale diecast message forum, diecastxchange.com, and you might want to contact Joe Kelly Jr., editor of  http://www.diecastxmagazine.com, through the magazine or other social media for a recommendation on dealers, auctions, toy shows, these are the best I can offer off the top of my head.

ModelCars,1nl1od,rhs856,1 point,Wed Oct 2 15:44:02 2013 UTC,"Lacquers dry through evaporation, enamels dry through oxidation and I've never understood ""acrylic"" that just mean plastic. I don't trust water based paints. In general, lacquer dries fast, but the solvents eat plastic. Enamels dry slow and that is why they have nice gloss. If you put lacquer over enamel the solvents will lift the enamel. Since we are modeling cars, I would expect you want the best gloss, and enamels will give that.   In general, it's not good to mix paint types. A good example of this, is peelers. All makes have had them, we did hundreds of mopar white failures. This was caused because some bean counter bought undercoats from one company and paint from another, they were incompatible and when old the paint blew off."
ModelCars,1nke7c,thaitea,1 point,Wed Oct 2 05:26:09 2013 UTC,"First off, with any paint, including clears and glosses, always test it on something before spraying your whole car with it. Crazing could happen to you.  I have used 2 paints to get a successful gloss finish: Testor's Wet Look Clear (3 oz spray can) and Model Masters Clear Enamel Top Coat (1 oz jars). Both require a smooth paint job underneath, which can be obtained by successively finer grits of sandpaper. I usually wet sand up to 600-800 grit on the actual color before applying the clear.  If spray painting is what you are comfortable with, Testor's Wet Look will work well. I have used it over acrylics, enamels, and lacquers without any issues. It is a lacquer, so it will dry very quickly. Do two light coats and 1 medium one.   If you have an airbrush, Model Master Top Coat Clear Enamel is one of the easiest ways to get a great, deep clear coat. I usually mix up 2 oz of it to paint a body, but I do not use it all. To mix it up for airbrushing, get the cheapest lacquer thinner (yes, we are mixing lacquer thinner with enamel paint) and do 2 parts clear to 1 part lacquer thinner. Trust me. Then, apply in very thin coats directly to the white plastic until you get decent coverage (probably 7-12 very thin coats). You will not need a primer. Then put your parts somewhere where no dust or bugs can get at them for a few days if you are curing the paint naturally. I like to put mine in a dehydrator overnight.  When the paint is completely dry, wet sand it some more with a good set of ultra fine grits (think 1000-10,000 grit). Your hobby store should have these. after you get up to the 6000-10,000 region, use wax or a scratch removal compound (I use Scratch-X) as a last polisher. The sanding/polishing will take the most time, but is the second secret to a great looking clear (after the prep work).  As an example, I dug up this picture. On the left is a 49 Merc that I used Wet Look on, followed by about 3 hours of sanding and polishing. On the right is a Tamiya Beetle that I sprayed Model Masters on out of a dirty airbrush. I did not polish or sand the Beetle. The enamel dries so slowly that it smooths itself out.  Edit: After rereading your question, I found that I forgot to answer your actual question. Gloss is the shine level, clear is the color. As a top coat, I am sure both terms are referring to the same thing - a glossy Clear Coat."
ModelCars,1nke7c,rhs856,1 point,Wed Oct 2 13:19:18 2013 UTC,Thank you for the tips and the picture examples! I plan on using a paint with some metallic flakes in it and I hear that I'm not suppose to polish or sand it as it can move the particles around and produce a bad finish.   Do you have any experience with metallic paints?
ModelCars,1nke7c,rhs856,1 point,Wed Oct 2 14:55:47 2013 UTC,"Yeah, with metal flakes, what happens is this:Some of the flakes will be submerged in the paint and some will be sticking out. If you sand the flakes down to the level of the level, the ones under the paint will be left alone, but the ones sticking out will have their ends ground down, leaving bent/flat spots. These flakes will have a uniformity that looks weird in the randomness of the other flakes, which is why people say don't sand it.  With flakes, do your best to get a smooth coat, and just lay the clear on it. Then, sand and polish the clear. If the color coat is smooth enough, you won't even notice any imperfections below.  Edit: I started an analogy about corn flakes, but I got too hungry, so I went back to paint."

ModelCars,1n5d7r,Azorian77,1 point,Thu Sep 26 02:01:35 2013 UTC,Are those the wheels that came with the model? Doesn't seem like something that would have been on a WRC car.  The model is looking great! I picked up two WRC models when I was recently in Tokyo. Almost done with one of them.
ModelCars,1n2aj3,kirbyforlife69,2,Tue Sep 24 23:05:03 2013 UTC,"Most decals these days go on great with just water and a drop of soap (to break the surface tension of the water).  If you do come across stubborn ones, try microsol or microset (available from the hobby shop or online).  Also, apply the decals BEFORE doing the gloss clear coat, this will make them look like part of the paint job rather than look like stickers."
ModelCars,1n2aj3,H2Sbass,1 point,Wed Sep 25 20:18:56 2013 UTC,ok i will try that thanks
ModelCars,1n2aj3,t25torx,1 point,Thu Sep 26 08:09:26 2013 UTC,"Well most of the ones I have used are from Tamiya kits, so they go on pretty flawlessly. I drop them in a bowl of lukewarm water, let them sit for about 10-15 seconds, then pick them out with tweezers. I then drop a  little water onto the car where I'm putting the decal, take the decal and slide it off with a toothpick, then dab up the extra water with a paper towel. If I have to re-position the decal I'll just put a drop of water on it and re-position. Hope this helps."
ModelCars,1n2aj3,t25torx,1 point,Wed Sep 25 01:26:39 2013 UTC,i do the same thing but i dont add water onto the car where I'm putting the decal but i will try this and will see it it works thanks

A story I posted in /r/modelmakers:   I ordered a model from them once that was later found to be out of stock. Glen found it at another shop, bought it, and sent it to me.   This was all taken care of before I even knew it was out of stock or there was a problem at all. Glen just emailed me to say he solved it and the model would be on it's way. :)"

ModelCars,1muzzt,mating_toe_nail,1 point,Sun Sep 22 12:19:03 2013 UTC,Are you going to make an engine belt and spark plug wires? The wires add so much to the look of the engine(provided the engine has wires).
ModelCars,1muzzt,mating_toe_nail,1 point,Sun Sep 22 14:05:26 2013 UTC,"I've been thinking about making wires, but I probably won't do it on this car. Any good tutorials on how to do it?"
ModelCars,1muzzt,rhs856,1 point,Sun Sep 22 14:14:11 2013 UTC,I don't know off the top of my head but I've done them before. The main thing is to have a small drill bit to drill into the engine. Then you just cut the wires and stick them in the hole. Radio shack usually carries small spools of wire that are of the right scale size and come in many colors. The drill bits I've only ever seen in hobby shops.

TL:DR - patience and time is key"
ModelCars,1mpatd,gam8it,1 point,Thu Sep 19 11:57:46 2013 UTC,"sorry i was talking about the 1/4 oz paint bottle not the can spray paint  but yes patience and time is key i take my time painting with white, one coat wait for it to dry, add another then wait and so on until i get what i was looking for"
ModelCars,1mpatd,schwack,1 point,Fri Sep 20 08:58:23 2013 UTC,"In my limited experience with Testors, I had a similar problem with gloss black.  I've used white primers depending on the color of the paint I'll be using.  I'm not trying to knock testors, but I've found a couple of their rattle cans to have either poor paint coverage, or spotty results.  You might consider another rattle can like Tamiya or some other reputable brand."

I don't know if its just white paints in general that can be problematic.  I'm too new to the modeling scene to be of any judgement.

It really turned out better than anything I could have hoped for when I started this car 14 years ago and I'm kinda glad it took me this long to get it done. I know this car wouldn't have turned out this nice had I finished it back when I started. Thanks for all the comments on the WIP pictures encouraging me to keep up the build.

None of the hobby shops around me had another kit, and I tried to repair the part with styrene but could never get it right. So it got shelved, I lost interest in models because I started messing around with real cars.

The interior was going to be white with blue speckled seat and door inserts. I managed to screwed up the paint on it, stripped it down and during that process I broke the fragile drivers side a-pillar. After that I lost interest in it, moved on to other things and forgot about it.   About 2 years ago I was browsing ebay and found a new in box kit for super cheap and bought it, intending to finally fix my mistake and finish the kit. I wanted to change direction and make it stock looking, no funky white interior and graphics on the body. Well now that I'm finally settled into my new house I figured it was time to finish it up. I'll be painting the body this week and hope to have it done by next weekend. so stay tuned!"

ModelCars,1k8jxs,jwei92,6,Mon Aug 12 22:21:39 2013 UTC,"Honestly, I usually buy from my local hobby store, even if they aren't the cheapest.    After not having a hobby store in town for a number of years, I realized that there is value in having a local store.  I can look through all the models they have in stock, swing by after work to pick up a bottle of paint or something small, and talk with owners and other customers.  Having them in town is worth the few extra bucks in my opinion."
ModelCars,1k8jxs,cacheflow,2,Tue Aug 13 02:56:11 2013 UTC,I would love this but the closest one to me is about 10 miles.
ModelCars,1k8jxs,cacheflow,2,Tue Aug 13 03:01:54 2013 UTC,"Agreed, but in the grand scheme of things, 10 miles is not that bad.  Mine is about 6 miles away, but before they opened a few months ago, the closest store was almost 50 miles away.  Especially when starting, I would often realize I needed something small, like a particular paint color or some sanding sticks, etc.  Sure I could order them from Amazon or eBay, but with the local place, I can stop on the way home from work, not delay my project 2 days.  That's a huge benefit for me."

ModelCars,1k8jxs,CrtureBlckMacaroons,1 point,Tue Aug 13 07:54:24 2013 UTC,"I have just moved back to Sydney for a while. Seems there are now about only three hobby shops here, all RC specialists. In a city of about 3.5 million. I feel, while your support for your local is honourable, physical shops just aren't a viable way to market hobby kits. Any hobby shop that has a good range of kits- and of course I go into any I pass- is unlikely to have anything that interests me. I really have all the Spitfires and Mustangs I need, and no hobby shop can park a Lavochkin La7 or Boulton-Paul Defiant on the shelves waiting for some freak to buy it. This shows in brands, too: you see the same Airfix and Academy kits in every shop.  And prices are at least 50% higher than online retailers. This could be in part because of the Australian market, where retail prices are notoriously high and wholesalers take a fat cut that the retailer has to pass on.  There is one good hobby shop in Melbourne that parallel imports so it is cheap, and it's a warehouse so the owner bulk buys and has a massive range, but I can't help but notice he does not look like a very wealthy man! Also the shop is in an industrial unit, miles from anywhere.  I feel, at least in the Australian market, the physical hobby shop selling plastic models is a thing of the past. I don't mind too much: online businesses are also employers, they support the hobby, and all I have dealt with are professional and provide good service.

Place the offending parts in a sealed container with enough brake fluid to submerge it completely, and let soak for a day or 2. (I have let model plastic parts soak this way for months with no softening of the plastic what so ever) Most of the enamel paint will bubble and fall off, and you can use an old tooth brush for any stubborn areas. Any paint that resists this process can be lightly sanded off, but before any sanding or re-painting, make sure to wash everything thoroughly with soap and water.   P.S. never use lacquer paint on bare plastic, as it will wrinkle the surface, and make a hell of a mess out of a nice model"

ModelCars,1k43l5,t25torx,1 point,Sun Aug 11 02:14:24 2013 UTC,Simple green or purple power (our whatever color you have) works well too. PP is at my local auto parts store for pretty cheap.

ModelCars,1k43l5,theeleventhguest,1 point,Mon Aug 12 23:11:30 2013 UTC,Can anyone recommend a good semi gloss black paint for the body?
ModelCars,1k43l5,Turbojett,1 point,Sun Aug 11 04:31:05 2013 UTC,"Just regular old Krylon works good for me when I use it on interior parts. Three or four light coats and it's usually good to go. Alternately, they make semi-gloss clear if you want to use a flat or gloss black as a base, then you would be able to sand out any spots and get it nice and smooth before clearing it."
ModelCars,1k2chy,jwei92,1 point,Sat Aug 10 01:34:18 2013 UTC,Congrats in getting back in. Maybe just put it together with out paint just to get your hands in it and also see what should be painted when and how. I use spray paint for almost every. Also I use the testors paint markers or for the colors they don't make I go to the craft store and buy there paint markers. unless its a super fine detail that needs s super fine tip them markers work great. As far as painting everything with spray paint I go I to the instructions and figure out what needs to be what color then and try to keep as much on the trees as I can and spray the parts there colors. Then when I cut them off the tree I touch then up with the markers. With the gluing use sparingly and be patient. I use super glue instead of model glue. Any hobby shop should sell good super glues. And last but not least be very careful putting the glass in just a little glue can ruin the whole glass. They sell special glue for putting in the glass. Good luck and if you enjoy it don't give up!
ModelCars,1k2chy,Bugga18,1 point,Sat Aug 10 02:59:11 2013 UTC,I've always enjoyed them - called them stencil models as a kid. The painting was always the hard part for me since I never could find the right colors.
ModelCars,1k2chy,t25torx,1 point,Sat Aug 10 03:01:17 2013 UTC,"Hey welcome back to the party. I've been building models off and on for the last 12 years, so here's some (hopefully) useful information.  For gluing things together I prefer Tenax 7R, but unfortunately it was discontinued last year. I am now using Ambroid ProWeld and it's working great. I only use superglue on parts that have to stick to something already painted. Don't forget to scrape any paint or chrome from the two surfaces your gluing. As far as painting before assembly is concerned, it all depends on the parts. On something like an engine block or a rear axle housing, I always glue them together first, that way I can sand any mold lines off them, then paint them.   For the paints, I use Testors, mostly due to availability. I usually purchase them from a hobby store like Hobby Lobby or Michaels. I'll use spray paints for pretty much all the the interior, chassis, and body. Oh and when it says Body Color, it's talking about whatever color you decide to paint the body of the car, not the name of an actual color.  If you need any more help just let us know. There's a ton more stuff I didn't touch on."
ModelCars,1k2chy,uncleawesome,2,Sat Aug 10 13:56:18 2013 UTC,What color paint so I have a model that shines like your typical car? Semi gloss?
ModelCars,1k2chy,uncleawesome,1 point,Sat Aug 10 16:06:12 2013 UTC,Paint it any color you like but then put a couple of light coats of clear gloss.
ModelCars,1k2chy,uncleawesome,1 point,Sat Aug 10 17:49:09 2013 UTC,So I can paint it with the flat black I have then go buy some clear Testors gloss to put on?  As for sanding down before painting - is that reccomended?
ModelCars,1k2chy,uncleawesome,1 point,Sat Aug 10 17:51:52 2013 UTC,"Doesn't have to be flat colors, the gloss makes the paint very glossy. You can sand with fine sandpaper."
ModelCars,1k2chy,t25torx,1 point,Sat Aug 10 17:58:52 2013 UTC,Is it required though? I'm still a beginner so...
ModelCars,1k2chy,t25torx,1 point,Sat Aug 10 18:26:23 2013 UTC,Not required to sand or clear coat but one good idea is to wash all the parts before you do anything to them. Washing gets all the oils and releases agents off from the casting machines. It helps the paints stick. Priming all the parts while still on the sprue is a good idea also.
ModelCars,1k2chy,t25torx,1 point,Sat Aug 10 18:33:29 2013 UTC,"Primer?   Do I need a specific? And after, do I just spray it on? Or paint? I always used to skip the painting step of my models as a kid."
ModelCars,1k2chy,t25torx,1 point,Sat Aug 10 18:58:09 2013 UTC,Spray on type is easier. Just some light coats.

ModelCars,1k2gjy,MisterLaz,2,Sat Aug 10 02:39:31 2013 UTC,i use washing up liquid and a toothbrush. it worked for me but i'm no expert so don't rely on it 100%
ModelCars,1k2gjy,Dinahmoe,2,Sat Aug 10 03:56:45 2013 UTC,"Dish soap or any soap really will work. They are looking to get the mold release agents off. Dawn has been the gold standard for removing grease. Laundry soap is more harsh then dish soap, like if you wash your hands with tide it gets warm."
ModelCars,1k2gjy,jjnjfih,1 point,Sat Aug 10 04:30:40 2013 UTC,"Cool, went with some dish soap!"
ModelCars,1k2gjy,t25torx,2,Sat Aug 10 05:28:20 2013 UTC,"I've used whatever liquid dish soap the wife bought that week and haven't had a problem.  What you're trying to do is get rid of the mold release agent that they spray on the mold so that things don't stick. The agent transfers to your model parts and this is what deters paint adhesion.  Testors sells a bottle of ""plastic prep"" which I am sure works fine but it's an added expense.  Now, I know some modelers who have said that they never wash parts and have never had a problem. This is probably true but the small amount of time it takes to wash and let the parts air-dry is worth it if prevents my custom paint job on that '49 Merc from peeling off."

I kind of hate the boso-style pipes, but that's more an indictment of those kinds of pipes in general vs. the pipes in the build -- stays true to its subject, which I can get behind.  Very neat!  Also, sent me down a brief google rabbit hole learning about shakotan-style cars -- I recognize the style, but never knew there was a specific term or scene involved there.

ModelCars,1ipzg4,schwack,2,Sat Jul 20 23:27:58 2013 UTC,I always used an Xacto blade to scrape away the plating ONLY on the surfaces that would be adhered to each other. I think sand paper is to clumsy.
ModelCars,1ipzg4,ed8020,1 point,Sun Jul 21 04:06:06 2013 UTC,excellent point!  I had never thought of using an Xacto for scraping.
ModelCars,1ipzg4,Mschultz33c,1 point,Sun Jul 21 04:09:26 2013 UTC,"I also use Xactos to scrape plating, and sometimes for a round peg or something I use sandpaper. The best way to use it is to cut a small piece and then fold it really small so it only gets where it needs to. Also round molding bumps or pegs that sometimes show up in areas that aren't seen, they sometimes need to be removed to get a flush fit for two parts. If its in a situation where you can't use sandpaper or a knife to remove something with actual plastic strength, a Dremel is what I use. Or a power drill with a small sanding bit works to."
ModelCars,1ipzg4,Mschultz33c,1 point,Mon Jul 22 04:37:43 2013 UTC,The thing I worry about it the dremel can take too much off.  Sanding or cutting.  I guess the lesson there is just to take your time.

My small house literally has a small pathway maybe two people can squeeze by while the ends are littered with boxes that I need to sell. Luckily most of the kits are in storage bins.  I also have boxes and boxes of actual metal model cars (are they called diecast or is that another material?). I'd wager about 50% or more of the metal models have broken pieces since they were packed with more speed than care. As it stands, I know more about model kits than I do actual cars so it is a little tough to figure out those are worth, especially since the majority of them don't have their original boxes.  I haven't attempted to sell any of these yet.  I also have several kits (mostly planes) which have been sanded and my father carved in more detail with dental picks, if I remember right. It may be impossible to tell whether those kits are worth anything as well. I haven't attempted to sell any of these either."

After washing the model, I dry it with a microfibre cloth then blow it off with a compresser. Then I paint it. I don't build consistantly so I've only done it about 6 times, but it seems to work fine. I only worry about the body for dust to."

ModelCars,1gsj1h,Nihilistic945,2,Fri Jun 21 23:52:10 2013 UTC,"I have a paint booth I made from poster board and a bathroom fan. It works well, but the mistake I made was making it too deep. It's 20"" deep and what happens is the paint has time to dry and turn to dust by the time it reaches the fan at the back of the box. So I get a lot of overspray and dust buildup. When I spray the airbrush it stirs this up over time. I have to trim the depth to about 12"" or so, so the fan is sucking wet paint fumes through the filter and not dust.   Also, a lot of guys use food dehydrators. I just bought one and tried it once, it's amazing. You cut the centers out of a few of the multiple layer trays. Paint the part, put it in the Dehydrator and put the top on. For enamel, you turn it on overnight and it will cure it to the point of the paint not being tacky any more, enough to handle it in the morning.   Lacquer should dry rather quickly."

I've been eyeing this particular compressor and a nice airbrush set, but the total cost was over 600.  The compressor is from what I understand top of the line, ultra quiet and ideal for a home or professional airbrush setup.  When I saw the markdown from $375 to $253 I ordered one.  Then I thought, maybe.. just maybe, someone here might have an interest as well.  I agree, its not exactly a modest solution, and there are far cheaper alternatives.  I supposed in my newly found excitement for model making, I'm willing to drop some coin for some shiny new tools.  Cheers!"

I use a Grex compressor, and being able to airbrush at any time of day (or night in my case) gives you a LOT more flexibility with your hobby.  And for ~$250, the size and apparent power of the unit being advertised here looks to be worth it."

ModelCars,1fkqfh,gam8it,3,Mon Jun 3 11:45:51 2013 UTC,"... my wife bought me this kit for my birthday   Ooh, that looks awesome.   I knew I needed to practice being a complete newbie so bought this model to try out...   I like this, too. I have one I've been meaning to turn into Mr. Bean's car.   here it is so far - I've taken a few short-cuts and think the inside floor should be a different colour but can't see what on the instructions, I guess racing green but it's too late now.. few bits need touching up I know :)   That looks really good.   A few questions:  I've read that the thinning ratio for airbrushing acrylics is 2 parts paint to 1 part thinner, is this right?   That's the ratio I use for enamels. Some acrylics can be airbrushed right out of the bottle (I've done this with Testor's acrylics). Someone will tell you about the ""consistency of milk"" thing, but I say experiment.   I've got the compressor on about 30PSI (2 BAR) - is this right? It seemed the best from experimentation   That seems right.   Masking - how do people go about masking off difficult areas? Especially curved bits where the tape doesn't really stick - is there a product I'm missing?   Have you tried liquid mask? Something like this. You could also try painting on some thinned white glue and let it dry. I have not done this, but it seems like it may work.   I'm painting parts prior to glueing, what do people generally do - scrape/sand areas for cementing after painting or mask them off before?   There are people in both camps. I generally glue parts that will end up being the same colors before painting. Paint parts separately that will be different colors, sand the mating areas and glue (or just superglue paint to paint, depending on the part - naughty, I know).   What's best for polishing/smoothing out paint jobs, I doubt I'll do it with this model but for the Lotus I want to do my best.   Start here.  Then go here if you are spray painting. There's some good advice.  Go here if you are airbrushing, which it sounds like you are. There are a few videos, but they do a good job of explaining how it all works. You should try enamels if you are looking for incredible shine - read about that here.  Have a booboo? Check this out.   I have a Dremel and was thinking of getting polishing attachments for that?   No. The Dremel runs too fast and will ruin your paint job. Wet sand by hand and polish by hand. Read about that here. Get some polishing pads/cloths that go up to 10,000 or higher grit and some of this.    I made a fundamental error with the dashboard and didn't read the paint colour instructions properly, ended up having to re-paint the inside and it looks pretty bad to me - So any tips for sorting this out? I seem to be stuck in a loop trying to paint the inside then tidy up the details and have to re-paint ... etc :(   That's a tough one. If starting over is a necessity, read this for advice on how to take the paint off. If you are just looking for cleaner lines, try tape or liquid masking. Also, a really steady hand and some really fine brushes go a long way."

ModelCars,1fkqfh,douchebaghater,3,Mon Jun 3 18:06:43 2013 UTC,These are all great questions for which I have no answers. BUT you've got me excited about making models again so you've got that going for you!    ;)
ModelCars,1fkqfh,schwack,3,Mon Jun 3 18:22:54 2013 UTC,"Wow.  Where to start.. first, the kit the wife gave you looks delicious.  Notably the photo of a previously finished project.  The Mini Cooper you are working on looks awesome as well.  I am a beginner too and only have a couple of models behind me so far; in truth I am learning from you.  I can tell you from my experience, it is best to either not paint, or sand post paint, the glue joints as I've learned paint and glue don't play together nicely.  As for smoothing out paint jobs, I am learning there too.  But I have discovered several things which come to mind:  Letting the paint dry.  I have been told 10-14 days of drying time after the wet coats have been applied.  This can be accelerated by having a food dehydrator, which I learned about from the model wizards in this sub.  You can actually dry the paint overnight with one of those guys.  Next up is a good spray clear coat, then after that dries, use ""The Treatment"" or some similar Caranuba (sp?) solution.  The treatment includes the wax, the polish, and then a wet polishing cloth for afterwords.  I'll stop there cause I'm really just a rookie here.  But thanks for your post and your work, great looking stuff!"

ModelCars,1f0hnf,schwack,3,Sat May 25 03:55:00 2013 UTC,"So as the story goes: This car was one my Mother had bought and owned before I was born. When I came along, she and my Dad had to sell it to take care of me. She always loved this car. Since I got back into modeling, I thought, why not see if I can't find the model and build it for her as a surprise for Mother's day? So I set upon my mission.  My first challenge was finding the car itself. I was able to locate the very vehicle I needed at my local hobby shop, a 66 stock hardtop made by AMT. Hobby store had only one, so I snagged it. My next challenge was matching the color. I asked my Father to try and find a picture of the actual car. He was able to, and said that was the color of Mom's. My dilemma was this: Finding a metallic blue rattle can that would match. This was quite the rub. No matter how hard I looked, even ordering from Tamiya direct, I couldn't match the color. I spent nearly 2 weeks just getting the color right. The last thing I wanted to do as a novice model builder, was paint this thing by hand. But it seemed increasingly like I would have little choice. Fortunately for me, I befriended the guys at the hobby store and I emailed them a pic of the car. The manager was able to find two paints he believed would give me the result I was looking for. A Model Master Pontiac Engine Blue, and a bottle of Tamiya Clear Blue.  I took these home and set about to mixing. After some serious sweat , and adding a little clear blue at a time, I believed I had it. Of course the parts were already washed, dried, sanded, and primed. So it was go time. I was so worried I would mess up the paint job. The paint ended up looking pretty good all things considered, but there are certainly some imperfections. I figured I had done my best. Then it was time to put all the pieces together. Lots of sanding, cleaning, fitting, detailing, and days of work on the interior, and it started to come together. Leaving the body and hood alone, I wanted the paint to cure so that when I wet sanded it, it wouldn't be ruined. I was smart to wait. I only wish I had gotten the paint job by hand done better. But I digress, it was a lot of fun to build, and the only way I'm going to get better is by learning as I go with my mistakes.  I wanted to say a thank you to all the other model makers here in /r/modelcars who helped me with tips and tricks along the way. You guys really made a difference, and I've learned so much being a part of this group. I hope you enjoy the photos, and I look forward to presenting you my next couple of models once they're underway!  Cheers!"
ModelCars,1f0hnf,FCSFCS,2,Sat May 25 03:56:14 2013 UTC,Beautiful car- great effort for a novice mode builder! How did you finish the paint - sanding and buffing - in the detail-laden areas without accidentally removing them?   Sounds like you live near a first-rate shop - a valuable resource.
ModelCars,1evg7u,schwack,3,Thu May 23 00:54:59 2013 UTC,"depends on the type of paint or clear coat. I am struggling with painting bodies myself, but enamels will typically take a week or two. I am going to get a food dehydrator to cure paints faster. A lot of guys recommend it.   The clear coat should be fine after a week. Check on the lower part of a fender or more obscure area and give it a quick wet sand with 4000 grit or something to see how it acts. If it seems soft at all, then let it sit for a few more days an try again."
ModelCars,1evg7u,Nihilistic945,3,Thu May 23 03:24:32 2013 UTC,"A dehydrator is a big investment, but is one of the best things I ever did to improve my paint jobs. The bodies and parts are protected from dust and they dry overnight or while I'm at work. A dehydrator combined with Donn Yost's enamel airbrush technique (discussed here) makes for some wonderful results.  To answer a part of OP's question, if you use acrylics, they dry almost immediately. Enamels take different amounts of time depending on humidity and color (Testor's Gloss Black takes forever to dry). I usually give them an hour or so for parts that will be handled lightly, and longer for the ones that are larger or will be handled a bit more. I will usually scratch off the paint at the glue joint (if I can) so the parts will adhere better - paint on paint gluing doesn't work so well."
ModelCars,1evg7u,rhs856,3,Thu May 23 13:41:14 2013 UTC,"+1 for Don(n?) Yost's techniques / videos.  I read his site a bit a while back -- I coincidentally found myself in Pittsburgh for work a short time later, and met up with him at his house to shoot the shit about models, painting, and so on.  Wound up buying his DVDs (there were 2 or 3 at the time) right from him, and he showed off his model collection -- his cars look damned good in person.  Super nice guy, and very good at his work."

ModelCars,1evppe,Acurus_Cow,3,Thu May 23 03:03:12 2013 UTC,"I have a home made paint booth in my basement that I do most of my painting in. It is vented out a window with PVC pipe. Before I had that, I used a booth made out of a Rubbermaid container and a PC fan, and before that I painted outside. I still do some painting (priming and black parts) outside, if the weather is nice.  As for the tub, try a Magic Eraser (as long as it is safe on your tub, check first!). They do wonders. And while you have it out, take the Kool Aid ring off of your kitchen counter, too.  You could also try thinner, but again, make certain that it is safe on your tub (especially if it is plastic). Try on a very small area that will not be seen before you rub down the whole tub. I'd rather have a blue tub than no tub."
ModelCars,1evppe,rhs856,1 point,Thu May 23 13:50:35 2013 UTC,"If you have a balcony, get yourself a big box and cut off the top and/or one side and just spray in the box outside.  To get the blue off your tub, use baking soda and hydrogen peroxide. Let it become a paste for about a half hour and that should do the trick."
ModelCars,1evppe,REBELYELLoz,1 point,Thu May 23 14:42:46 2013 UTC,"Initially, I tried spraying outside, I even fashioned a cardboard paint box, but my design was a fail, since the wind dropped lawn clippings, pollen and dust on my paint job.  That really sucked.  Upon the advice of a fellow redditor, I invested in this guy.  This is much more expensive than making your own, but my advantage is I can do all my painting, and cementing in the house, dust free.  The suction vents it all outside, and it has a replaceable filter.  IF you do decide on one of these, take the time to protect the booth itself with saran wrap and masking tape, changing it every model or two.  This way the plastic booth parts stay intact, and they don't get sticky at the hinges."

ModelCars,1el1u2,strang3r_08,1 point,Sat May 18 17:16:09 2013 UTC,"Just like in real life. Can't tell, but is it hitting the scoop? There is always a chance of plastic warping, you can form plastic with gentle heat, like a hair dryer, but it's trick working with thin plastics. Be sure it's not hitting anywhere, take a piece of single kleenex and put it anywhere you want to check the fit, close and try to pull the tissue out. If it sticks, there is interference. If not, you might need to bend a bit."
ModelCars,1el1u2,Dinahmoe,1 point,Sat May 18 21:54:51 2013 UTC,Check the hinges. They might have some flash or need to be sanded down.
ModelCars,1el1u2,uncleawesome,1 point,Sun May 19 03:36:20 2013 UTC,"I had the same problem with a model recently, but mine was an engine clearance issue.  I sanded down the oilpan mount on the chassis which dropped the motor enough for me, but that may not be your problem.  If the plastic is warped, you can use heat like mentioned, or I've seen some people compensate with putty masking."
ModelCars,1el1u2,schwack,1 point,Sun May 19 20:54:00 2013 UTC,First thoughts on trouble shooting.  Take the hood and drop it on the flattest surface you can find. If it sits flat without rocking you know it's probably not warped.  Step two. Coat the bottom side of the hood with something like flour then put the hood on and see where the flour scrapes off. There's your high point.
ModelCars,1ejlgm,strang3r_08,2,Fri May 17 22:02:09 2013 UTC,I do a little of both. It depends on how detailed I feel like being and how much will be seen when I'm done.
ModelCars,1ehuht,schwack,2,Fri May 17 03:05:22 2013 UTC,"BMF is awesome, but not easy!  Here is my latest attempt: http://imgur.com/a/rniay#2  I put the foil on after final coat of paint and after clear coat (and after a couple of weeks of drying).  I feel this method is much cleaner.  It is more difficult to get the thin strips of BMF to stick (The raised ribs on the front fender and deck lid, the trim around the swoosh were particularly difficult).   The 3 keys to successful BMF are (for me):   A SUPER sharp blade A method of holding down and ""pushing back"" on the BMF - I only use toothpicks, round ones, some cut on an angle for larger surface The proper mindset   3 can't be overstated, you must be patient, if it isn't working, don't force it - walk away and come back to it later."
ModelCars,1ehuht,Smithers66,1 point,Tue May 21 15:27:32 2013 UTC,"Wow!!  Your work is incredible!  Do you really let the paint and clear coat dry for two weeks??  I've not heard of that previously.  And when you say ""pushing back"" on the BMF, are you referring to keeping the BMF in place you've already molded to the part as you cut and remove excess around it?  What also can't be overstated is what an incredible job you did on that vette!"
ModelCars,1ehuht,Smithers66,1 point,Wed May 22 00:47:17 2013 UTC,"Thanks!  Yes, I do let paint and clear coats dry for at least a week.  That way when gripping the model you don't worry about leaving impressions.  I also use the sleeve of a short sleeve plain white tee shirt as a wrap while holding my model towards the end of the build.    When you get to really thin strips like on the vette I have found that the BMF will start to move around while being cut or pulling off the cut piece.

ModelCars,1eb9k8,Corz69,2,Tue May 14 13:31:50 2013 UTC,This build was amazingly easy save for one drawback (wheels).  The yellow paint just would not stick no matter what I tried.  Otherwise everything went smooth.  I did have trouble with the 8 velocity stacks and getting them to sit even. I eventually gave up on that and just focused on getting the multi layered decals perfect.   Hope you enjoy.
ModelCars,1eb9k8,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Tue May 14 13:34:33 2013 UTC,It looks very nice. Is the suspension made out of metal? And how did you apply those multi-layer decals? To me that seems a bit tricky to get right.
ModelCars,1eb9k8,jonthedoors,1 point,Tue May 14 15:25:18 2013 UTC,"The suspension is plastic, just with the chrome coating, similar to chrome bumpers or wheels.  The multi layer decals were actually quite simple.  It was the pinstriping decals that were the hardest.  Once you put down the base decal, let it dry for a few days, then apply the second layer on top of the first, pat it down and you're done."
ModelCars,1eb9k8,jonthedoors,1 point,Tue May 14 15:30:52 2013 UTC,I had that exact same problem with mine. Don't ever do the Newman Porsche 956!!! It took two cans of the yellow rattlecan paint to get a fairly even coat.  I'm just looking now though; did you not paint the engine or the interior?

ModelCars,1d8woh,schwack,4,Sun Apr 28 01:00:41 2013 UTC,"Basically, your only option is to sand it off until it's level with the rest of the glass. Start with 320 or 400 grit and work up to 800 or 1000 grit once it's level. Then use something like Scratch X (or toothpaste in a pinch) to polish it some more. Once it's as good as you can get it, dip it in Future floor polish and let it dry. The floor polish will fill in the tiny scratches and make it transparent again.  I'm sure you've learned it by now, but Elmer's is my go-to for windows. Water based cleanup and it dries clear. Welcome to the sub, BTW!"

ModelCars,1d8woh,Dinahmoe,1 point,Sun Apr 28 06:51:25 2013 UTC,"I am going to suggest something I have not tried, but in practice should work. I wouldn't start sanding with anything less than 600 grit wet. Now to preface where this comes from, I'm a car guy, and I have been refinishing plastic for very many years. This is not styrene, but more durable thermoplastics used for exterior lighting on cars. I sandblast old weather beaten parts, sand and clean them and shoot them with clear, they come out excellent. You could even make tinted windshields like this. (models, you can paint glass, but not on windshields) Now, if you can find a sprayable clear that won't fog styrene, you are in business. Keys would be to clean the hell out of the plastic to be sure there are no mold release agents or finger prints, sand thoroughly and shoot away. We don't have to use waterbased paints here yet, I wonder if those will work? I have a friend in NJ and he is using them, I'll have to find out sometime. Anyway, by sanding the surface uniform, the clear will fill in the scratches and should look pretty good when it dries. Again, the key is the solvent in the clear, as to if this will work or not.   Here is an example from my 122  http://i.imgur.com/Lkd5PR6.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/UBylke2.jpg  BTW, my first car was a 69 mach 1!"

ModelCars,1cuct8,Mschultz33c,9,Mon Apr 22 03:41:03 2013 UTC,"Welcome to the world of modelling. There is plenty of advice to be had, but here are some basics.  Take your time - read the instructions until you understand them thoroughly. I write notes on mine about what parts might need changes or replacing. Think about the changes you want to make to kit and where it needs to happen.  Test fit everything before gluing. Trim all the parts carefully. Invest in a good quality knife for modelling, one that uses surgical steel scalpel blades - hence the word 'carefully' back there.   Look for gaps and fill 'em - use a good quality modelling putty.  Get a selection of tools - the knife I mentioned, some small sprue cutting pliers, files of various cuts, some emery boards (nail sanding paper stick things), a small hand held pin vice and a selection of drill bits, a cutting mat, the best paint brushes you can afford (and know how to look after 'em).  If you want to do mods, think ahead about the cuts you need to make and how things are going to be attached. Plan ahead - this is where writing notes on your instruction sheet helps.  Sometimes, it's necessary to paint as you go. Plan ahead for that too - you can often see from the instructions where painting needs to happen.  Know that different glues have different effects on different sorts of materials. If you're gluing canopies or windshields with polystyrene cement, sometimes they go foggy - sometimes it's better to use white glue like PVA.  Finally, this is on me... heaps of videos here"
ModelCars,1cuct8,munky_g,2,Mon Apr 22 04:09:53 2013 UTC,"This is a ton of advice! Some is new to me and some isn't. I've recently started writing notes on my instructions because I sometimes forget decals and then it could be too late to put them on. I also try to test fit my parts and I do have a good quality exacto knife, but it's old and I don't doubt the blades are dull (ill look into that). I've never used filler putty, and now that I know of it I can see some areas I could use it, especially on my current build-2010 Shelby GT500 (which will be entered in the revell contest:)). Luckily my father is a snowmobile racer, mechanic and drywaller/finisher, so I have access to the all types of the worlds finest sanding equipment, paint thinners, pliers, cutters, etc. I do paint as I go, and do each assembly separately. I will probably try doing all painting before assembly on my next build. Lastly, I do use testors clear parts cement for windows and such, and sometimes super glue for other assemblies, but mostly regular testors blue or red tube cement. I suppose it's just that I often use too much.   Probably the best advice for me here is PATIENCE, I know it's something I need to work on, but I get to eloped in building and painting and usually screw up.  Maybe I need another hobby to distract me from my  hobby ;)  In closing, thanks a ton for all your info, especially the link!"
ModelCars,1cuct8,uncleawesome,3,Tue Apr 23 03:46:02 2013 UTC,Use Elmer's glue for the windows or other clear parts.
ModelCars,1cuct8,Dinahmoe,3,Mon Apr 22 04:05:45 2013 UTC,"I'll address the paint as most of the other tips here are solid. Patience is something I'd guess you get as you age, looking back.   I have over 40 years in auto paint, and if you are brushing bodies, it's just isn't going to work, too much surface area. You need to get an airbrush or spray cans to do the body. It's really tough to sand little parts and not screw them up, and by fine paper talking like 1500 to 2000 grit for the finish. You need to clean the parts with like dawn and hot water to be sure they are clean and grease free. Tape the body and parts on something to stabilize them and so you don't have to touch them when painting. If you do get an air brush, thinning the paint is pretty crucial, too thick and it won't atomize well, too thin and you won't get coverage and it will run off. If it doesn't have the gloss you would like, clear coat it.   For small parts and detailing, patience is really key, that and a lot of colors and brush types. BTW, you can get some cool brushes cheap at beauty palaces, they will be by the nail polish. And you can use nail polish for parts too, it's cheaper than model paint. (always test paint before using it on good stuff!)"
ModelCars,1cuct8,theeleventhguest,1 point,Mon Apr 22 15:41:56 2013 UTC,"This is great advice! The overall look of a model is the finish of the body, it's the first thing you see when it's on the shelf and that is where it's going to be for the rest of it's life."
ModelCars,1cuct8,MyKarmaKilledURDogma,1 point,Mon Apr 22 21:34:16 2013 UTC,"Thanks a ton for your advice! I have I only once brushed on a finish body coat, and I've never done it since then. Currently I have 2 cheaper but so far excellent working airbrushes, a regular one and a quick change. However I have never used either on a model body except for a demolition derby style dodge I once made. I do have a shitton of sandpaper, from the coarsest to the finest. Which I do use a lot. I just invested 35$ in paintbrushes, and so far they seem good. I use testors paint for about 90% of my parts, and if I have a lot of a certain color like semi-gloss black I will often spray them, but otherwise I only spray the body. Also, I have recently started using clear coat, and a local model shop owner just told me that some people use Future brand floor wax on their models instead of clear coat because it is really thin and can be brushed on and still be perfectly smooth. I tried it today, but. Ihh. Not perfect if I'm doing it right.  Overall, I will definitely start using my airbrush soon and use all the tips you've provided here. Again, thanks a million."

ModelCars,1cuct8,jeepdave,2,Mon Apr 22 04:42:03 2013 UTC,"For smooth paint, the key is prepping the body well.  Also, if you get orange peel, use really fine grit sand paper or polish to buff it out.  Glue is practice.  Windows are tough, avoid super glue, that will make the windows ""fog""  Also, look into magazines like Scale Auto and Model Cars.  I learned a ton from those."

You don't want to mess around with a cheap one. Here's my $100 recommendation:    Model - $25  Hobby knife and spare blades - $10  Bottle paints - $20 will get you a dozen or so Testors paints.  Spray paint for body (color and clear) - $10  Assorted brushes - $5  Assorted sandpaper (220-1000 grit) - $10  Snips for removing parts from trees - $5  A decent set of tweezers - $5  Elmer's glue $1  Medium cure CA glue - $5  CA applicator tips - $4   Sum = $100  I over estimated some of the prices, but that should just leave a little more padding at the end.  These (and toothpicks) are the bare essentials I would recommend that will give you a completed model."

ModelCars,18pdne,rhs856,1 point,Sun Feb 17 23:49:35 2013 UTC,should I dilute the degreaser or leave it at full strength?
ModelCars,18pdne,rhs856,2,Thu Feb 21 18:39:43 2013 UTC,I have used purple power and simple green at full strength. It also can be used multiple times before getting rid of it.
ModelCars,18pdne,Jahria,3,Thu Feb 21 19:22:54 2013 UTC,"In the Netherlands we use Mr.Muscle, it's a strong degreaser for burnt out black stains in microwaves etc. It removes the paint but leaves the plastic and glue.  You could try a similar product and test it out on small parts that you won't use. Put it in to a small container with the degreaser for about 30 mins to 4 hours, this probably depends on the concentration of the degreaser. leave it in to long and it can damage the plastic."

ModelCars,18dh0n,DNaB,3,Tue Feb 12 12:21:22 2013 UTC,"Most kit manufacturers have their gems and duds. That being said, Tamiya and Revell of Germany make fantastic kits that have incredible fit and detail - but you will pay for it. I have had good luck with most modern Revell/Monogram and Round 2 (not including MPC!) kits. Most kits designed from the 90s on are made well and will go together without a lot of trouble.  Most of the kits I build are skill 2 or 3 (the only difference being part count, not difficulty). You may see higher skill numbers, but that only means more parts - I mean, how much more difficult can it get past painting and gluing? ;) I would say start with something you're interested in, and build it straight out of the box - focus on making sure the parts are free of mold marks and painted well. Don't worry about opening doors, flocking, or wiring. Just try to do your best with the basics.  As for scale, I build in 1/24 or 1/25. They are a nice balance of detail and price for me. On the other hand, what works for me, may not work for you.  Welcome to the hobby, again! You will find so many resources online and a great community of builders wherever you go. If you have any questions or want advice, just ask. I don't think I've come across anyone in this hobby that was secretive of their techniques or unwilling to help."
ModelCars,18dh0n,rhs856,1 point,Tue Feb 12 13:44:57 2013 UTC,"Ahh, I didn't realise that the only real difference in difficulty was the number of parts!  I'm going to start off with a pretty easy kit (but one that still requires gluing), and take it from there.  Thanks for replying - it's greatly appreciated!"
ModelCars,18dh0n,peedeearr,1 point,Wed Feb 13 08:59:55 2013 UTC,What Richard said. He pretty much covered it.
ModelCars,18dh0n,t25torx,4,Wed Feb 13 12:08:18 2013 UTC,"I haven't had a bad Tamiya kit yet. The last one I built was the 350z, it was a joy to put together and detail. Like rhs856 said, most anything 90's and newer will be a pretty well made kit with minimal flashing and mold seams. Parts will fit good and line up correctly for most all manufacturers. I prefer 1/25-1/24 scale kits, big enough to detail up if you want to and small enough to display and store them once built.   If you have a Hobby Lobby in your area I would go online and get the 40% off coupons they have and get a Tamiya kit for about the same price as a regular Revell kit."
ModelCars,18dh0n,danowar,5,Tue Feb 12 13:59:13 2013 UTC,"You can never go wrong with Tamiya -- fit and detail of every Tamiya kit I've ever worked on is impeccable.  Also, their primers and paints are very good (as an interesting bonus, their acrylic paint smells nice, though obviously you should only paint in a well ventilated area and preferably with a respirator or mask of some kind).  I've heard good things about Revell Germany, but have never had one; Revell / Monogram USA kits are typically 'meh'.  Detail tends to be just okay, fit leaves something to be desired in my experience.  Fujimi has a lot of pretty good kits -- they have a great selection of Japanese cars, and their newer kits are excellent (some of the older ones weren't that great, but their manuacturing processes have improved greatly over the last sveral years I think).  Hasegawa kits are pretty good too I've heard, but I don't know much about them -- I think they're mostly airplanes.  AMT is crap.  Tower Hobbies, Squadron, Hobbylinc, and Hobbylink Japan are all pretty good online sources of kits, tools, and supplies.  If you're into sci-fi models, also, Para Grafix has awesome photo-etch detail sets (I'm working on a Moebius Viper Mk 2 from Battlestar Galactia right now, and the photo etch cockpit detail kit from Para is really nice).  The 'standard' size of most model cars is 1/24 or 1/25 -- there's oodles of options in those scales.  If you just want a simple, cheap kit to get started with, just pick any Revell kit and have at it!  They are widely available, and fairly inexpensive.  Tamiya kits tend to have more detail parts, and might be a little too fiddly if you're just getting into it, but check for a 'curbside' kit of something that appeals to you -- these usually have less engine detail (if the hood opens at all), and might be better to get started with.  As for tools, invest in an array of sandpaper grits and a good sharp hobby knife (a lot of hobby shops have surgical scalpels, these are fantastic).  If you're in it for the long haul, you should definitely get an airbrush -- Paasche airbrushes are pretty good and fairly cheap, and you can use can propellant if you don't want to get an air compressor.  Badger airbrushes are also great for starting off with.  Rattlecans are fine too, but an airbrush is the only way to go for getting good finishes in the long run, IMO."
ModelCars,18dh0n,danowar,3,Tue Feb 12 17:52:56 2013 UTC,"Thanks so much for the advice!  I had a look at my local hobby shops, and they seem to have a great selection of Tamiya kits available, so I think I'll pick one of those up to get started as they're just as cheap as their Revell models.  I've read a lot about airbrushes, but I think for now I'm going to pick up the bare minimum equipment so I can get a taste for it without spending a chunk load of cash on it up front.  Great advice, thanks again!"
ModelCars,18dh0n,danowar,2,Wed Feb 13 09:07:45 2013 UTC,"No problem at all!  Aside from whatever paints you wind up needing for the kit you get, as far as tools go, a good sandpaper set and polishing cloth set (240 through 1500 grit for sandpaper, and 3200 through 10000 grit for polishing -- these are often sold as a single set of sandpapers and a single set of polishing cloths), an xacto knife and a few spare blades, a few brushes of varying sizes, some sanding sticks, and glue.  For glue, honestly that black triangular Testors thing is pretty decent for an all purpose glue, but I would suggest also getting a pack of disposable micro-applicators (these are little white plastic sticks with a tiny brush on the end).  Microset / microsol are nice-to-haves for applying decals, but are unnecessary if you don't plan on applying them.  Make sure to get an extra bottle or two of thinner for whatever type of paint you get, and keep one solely for brush cleaning.  As for airbrushes, FWIW, you can get a simple Badger airbrush for like $25 or so."

On the topic of paints, when I first bought some paints, I saw all of the metallic colors and thought, ""Why do I need all of these? Aluminum, steel, and silver all look the same!""

ModelCars,183wlq,oh_fuckit,2,Sat Feb 9 21:27:07 2013 UTC,"I would agree with oh_fuckit; you'd just be wasting resin to recreate the entire sprue, as you'd be throwing away most of what you cast.  However, if you're looking to mold parts, then I know there exists sets with both molding and casting resin compounds. you could just cast entire parts--or even assemblies--in two-piece molds; depending on how much casting resin you have, you can do it as many times as you need."

ModelCars,16yx7y,Dinahmoe,1 point,Tue Jan 22 02:42:54 2013 UTC,"From my experience, most people never notice the sidebars. I however think they are an invaluable tool for subs. Take /r/vinyl for example, they get the same questions over and over, no one checks the sidebar for clues. Same goes for /r/motorcycles. I can't stand either sub btw, I tried, but they are awful.   So, what I would like over there, links to helpful sites or blogs. Links to shopping, everyone loves a bargain! The getting started section is good and can be expanded, perhaps a note in the header or submit page reminding that it is there for help? They have really improved the search here in the last year, maybe remind them to search first before posting, although, that does diminish community a bit, in a large sub, that would keep the ""hey, what airbrush do I get?"" to a minimum.   My 2¢ and the only thing I've built in the past months is some lego and things for the garden."

ModelCars,16r9nh,I_Am_TheSnuggler,3,Thu Jan 17 16:15:37 2013 UTC,"Pics?  From what I've read, I would try touching up the spot with a teenie-tiny bit of paint (using a small brush) and then wet sanding it until it blends in before clear coating it (what clear are you planning to use?). Two things to consider:   The paint that you are touching up with cannot be thick. Thin it a little if you have to - put a glob on an old CD and mix it around with a drop of thinner. Put very light coats on. Multiple coats is ok. When you wet sand, start with 400 grit or so and work your way up to your highest. If you need sand paper, try an auto parts store. They usually have sheets that go from 400-1000.   Oh, and take your time with this correction and make sure you are clear with what you are doing before you do it. Asking questions and reading up on a technique before you try it won't make the paint situation any worse. ;)"

ModelCars,16r9nh,peedeearr,3,Fri Jan 18 15:50:43 2013 UTC,Looks like a light sanding (careful to not burn through) and a re-coat SHOULD fixit right up.

ModelCars,16nnil,peedeearr,2,Wed Jan 16 14:05:34 2013 UTC,I'm getting to 'close enough' territory myself. What brand of yellow?
ModelCars,16nnil,peedeearr,2,Wed Jan 16 14:15:57 2013 UTC,It's Tamiya TS-16 I think.  It's a spray can and it just rolls right off the wheels high spots and collects into the valleys.

ModelCars,15urpq,Turbojett,3,Wed Jan 2 23:38:32 2013 UTC,"Sorry my phone's camera sucks.  Even more sorry I didn't have the presence of mind to take pics of how I attached the wheels, as that seems to be a topic of discussion among modelers.  The RS Wats came with brake discs, and seperate hubs. All I had to do was sand down the hubs, attach them to the braks disks backwards (so as to allow a little niche for the wheel pins to go into) and attach them to the car's kingpins in the front. the backs of the Skyline's OE brake drums were still fitted to the rear suspension but only to serve as a mounting point for the new discs. Yes, the wheels still roll quite well. and while sanding, it was a happy accident that the hubs sanded down at a slight diagonal, so it allowed me to ""dial in"" a little bit of negative camber, allowing for that tuner look.  As for the color, I know they were only offered in White or Silver, but I always wanted one in black, with Wats.  Now I just have to find a '73 C110 GTR, and the collection will be complete!"

ModelCars,14vxa4,emenhiser,5,Sat Dec 15 07:17:10 2012 UTC,LOTS of cutting of the body. You're probably taking an inch out of the middle of the body between the sides. TONS of re-shaping.
ModelCars,14vxa4,peedeearr,2,Sat Dec 15 11:46:20 2012 UTC,"The most important thing is keeping things square. Draw your lines with pencil and triple check everything (like will the engine fit? how about the interior?). Cut the body in half with a razor saw, taking your time (don't forget about bumpers, the hood, and the grille, too). When you glue the halves back together, you'll want to add some structure to the seam where it won't be seen.  Next you have to do the same to the frame to make sure it fits. Same advice here, including bracing.  Now you have to chop up the dash, floor, front and rear ends, and make sure it all fits. If it were me, I wouldn't worry too much about the underside of the car (axles, suspension, front steering parts). I would just do enough so that it looks good from a normal viewing angle. On the other hand, if you are putting this much time into making something unique, why not go all the way? ;)  If you want an easy way to make sure you're taking the same amount out of each piece, find some tape that is the same width as what you want to cut out. That way, you can put the tape where you want to cut away, and use the edge as a guide for the saw."

ModelCars,14q7xo,goforce5,1 point,Thu Dec 13 04:10:43 2012 UTC,"Hobby Lobby and Michael's carry a decent selection of car models, and a limited selection of planes, ships and tanks.   Both usually have a 40% off coupon on one item, on their website, almost every single week.    You can also get paints, airbrushes, glues, brushes, sandpaper, files, x-acto knives, etc, at these places.  A lot of scale modelers turn their nose up because of the ""craft"" stuff at these places, but I hit at least one every damn week.    Last week, I scored a bunch of Model Master spraypaints at $2/can, because they were being closed out.   If you're a model builder, these places are definitely worth your time to check out.  Bring your smartphone, show them the coupon at the register, and save bucks."

ModelCars,13qotv,HeCantFindOut,1 point,Sun Nov 25 02:11:40 2012 UTC,"I can answer part of your question, but I will leave the important part to someone more knowledgeable. Yes models were made of Corvairs from that period. To quote a post on this page,   AMT made annual kits for every year of Corvair. The 1960 was the only time a Corvair sedan was kitted. The 1961 was weird in that it was molded as a convertible, but the kit included a top that you could glue onthat looked pretty much like the factory coupe roof, but without the B-pillar! The '62 was a Spyder coupe, 1963 was a Spyder convertible, and back to a Spyder coupe for '64. 1965 and '66 were both Corsa coupes, and 1967-'69 were all Monza coupes. Every year had the year of the model molded into the license plates front and rear EXCEPT for the 1968 and '69 - These had blank license plates. Those two annual kits couldn't be built stock - they didn't have a stock engine lid or wheels.   Unfortunately, most, if not all, of these kits are rare ($$$) and all of them will need to be built (assembled and painted).  What I think you are looking for is either a built model of one of these kits (even more $$$) or a diecast. I did find a few diecast Corvairs, but not in the color you are looking for or not convertible (this is where I will open it up to the diecast collectors). As a side note, if he likes the 62, he'll probably be fine with anything from 1960-1964, as there were few external changes.  Good luck!"
ModelCars,13qotv,rhs856,2,Mon Nov 26 17:04:47 2012 UTC,"Thank you so much for your help!! If I can find a model I would need to assemble, it would also work, but from what you're saying it seems like that may not be an option.  I have no experience with models, but would it be possible if I found a model between '60-'64 that I could paint it again with the appropriate paint and materials? He's not a collector of any sort, I just thought it would be a cute Christmas gift to ""buy him a car"" for Christmas.  Again, thank you for your help!!"
ModelCars,13qotv,rhs856,1 point,Mon Nov 26 17:21:21 2012 UTC,You're welcome! You may find that repainting a diecast (or plastic model) is a bit of a job. I'm still on the hunt.  Why not just buy him the real Corvair? It might be easier! ;)
ModelCars,13qotv,Dinahmoe,1 point,Mon Nov 26 17:27:39 2012 UTC,"Haha, it might have! It was a really nice car, pretty much original everything and in great condition for like $5000. Sadly, broke college students.  I'm going to check out a couple of hobby stores in town this week, so maybe I can find something similar. I just think it would be kind of awesome because its like a thing between us, trying to find a way to get that car and imagining being all classy in it and such."

Throttle linkage and cable. A lot of time went into this. There are a lot of details, although not as clean as they should be. The bare metal foil on the trim is pretty bad.   sorry about the poor pictures, I was having trouble and the sun was going down. The hood and rear view mirror are not done, just like on the last model I completed (1970 BOSS 429). This is the second completed model  I have built. I have many others near completed.

The Tamiya kits can be a bit scary what with the amount of detail and number of pieces, but you simply cannot get better looking kits. They go together so well, and with patience, come out amazingly. Definitely worth the extra money over some other kits.  As for the glue, I usually use Elmer's for clear stuff, but in my case it isn't a structural piece (like the whole body) so I could get away with a weaker glue. I have no clue what to recommend for a model like this."

It dries through evaporation, you might try and put a clip light and a fan on it. That will give a little heat in case you trapped solvents (top layer drying before lower layers) and needed air flow. Your paint may be old too and in need of some thinner. If it's been in stock for a while good chance the volatile solvents escaped."

For a car this specific, you have a couple of options. There are dozens of resin casters, and there may be one that makes a version of this. It could be difficult to find, and probably expensive. I would put a post up on a model car forum with a larger reader base (MCM, or Scale Auto come to mind) and see if anyone knows where you can get it.  Your other option is to see if you can find a diecast.

ModelCars,wyps0,MyKarmaKilledURDogma,2,Sun Jul 22 11:57:01 2012 UTC,You have me tempted with that Cadillac Tractor. where did the finished build pics come from?
ModelCars,wyps0,rhs856,2,Mon Jul 23 15:59:29 2012 UTC,"That is the prototype I started probably 20 years ago, after the Cadillac took a dive from a 6 foot shelf onto a concrete floor. I had noticed the wheelbase was very close to the puller, and decided to build a hybrid. I made some mistakes cutting the body, and a lot of the Caddy's detail was killed in the crash."
ModelCars,wy3ms,Littl3Bastrd,1 point,Sun Jul 22 00:53:55 2012 UTC,"yes, the base for your graphite should probably be the same as a factory paint job for that vehicle. platinum gray most likely, or hell it could be carbon fiber for that matter I don't recognize the car. I use DOT automotive brake fluid to remove most enamels. carbon fiber transfers might look killer too, just sayin.  the blue is lookin good tho"
ModelCars,wy3ms,MyKarmaKilledURDogma,1 point,Sun Jul 22 09:50:29 2012 UTC,"I would say you are better off taking off all of the paint rather than trying to just get it off of one panel. You need to do this in stages, because it's a 2 tone paint job. Prime the car, tape it off, and lay down the lighter color. Let it dry and repeat for the darker one. If you look up ""2 tone painting"" on Model Cars Magazine's forum, there are some great tutorials with tons more pictures than my comment (I would link, but multi tasking on my phone is ridiculous). Good luck! :)"

ModelCars,wy5x5,Littl3Bastrd,7,Sun Jul 22 01:43:59 2012 UTC,They want you to cut it out to that shape and put it in the hole. Set the mesh on the illustration and trace the shape then cut it out.
ModelCars,wy5x5,uncleawesome,1 point,Sun Jul 22 03:32:12 2012 UTC,Yep but be careful about the size of the cut and take a look at it. You may want to make it better so it is easier to work with a glue inside the body better.
ModelCars,wy5x5,altrdgenetics,2,Sun Jul 22 06:13:33 2012 UTC,I think the plastic vent cover should be open and the mesh should be on the inside of it creating a realistic air vent look.

ModelCars,wcqnj,mikebdesign,1 point,Wed Jul 11 02:03:29 2012 UTC,"I love your builds. I especially like the Countach.   As for the reason I started building again is that work has been slow and I have been going out of my mind with boredom. So I needed a new hobby. I figured I will give models a shot again. I remember being a kid and every grocery stores had a wide selection of models, but now I have to really hunt to find any store the even sales them. It sad to think kids aren't building them as much anymore. I remember many summer days spent building my dream cars.   I am starting out with simple models I can complete quickly so I can get a feel for it again. Then hopefully I can move on to something more challenging."

There is supposed to be chrome down the side and above the seats and there were no decals for the dash. I'm pretty good with a detail brush and I wanted to add some detail to it by hand, but with it being a convertible and the dash being white, I was afraid of it looking sloppy. For the chrome, I'm not sure what BMF means and I'm not good enough to do something like fabricate my own or whatever. Any advice would be appreciated!"

He had all the parts in bins set up on shelves against the wall. I think i still have parts from those trips i haven't used yet. He had two women who worked with him.

I've seen beautiful work done with brushed enamels, although it is difficult to do without leaving ugly brush marks..  Spray paint has an easier learning curve and produces nice work with some practice. Always test on some spare plastic before spraying a body.    Airbrushing has the highest cost to get into and the highest learning curve, but can produce gorgeous and unique paint jobs that are difficult or impossible to get any other way."

ModelCars,sxd38,rhs856,1 point,Tue May 1 19:21:28 2012 UTC,"Just patience and practice. Mostly practice ive found.  Take your time and focus on one thing at a time and try not to get overwhelmed and finish it faster by taking shortcuts. This always gets me. Ive started 30 models at least and have yet to finish more than 5, none of which im 100% happy with :( But im getting better :P  Use or buy an airbrush. Biggest tip i can give. The more you can save by not using a brush, the better.  Test fit the parts before and after you undercoat. The undercoat makes a big difference sometimes.   Shake your paint can VERY well and often when your using them.  Put your freshly painted parts in a microwave once done, obviously dont turn it on but its dust free.

ModelCars,sr6vl,jonthedoors,2,Wed Apr 25 16:41:23 2012 UTC,"Lots of fabrication work. It's not a job for the light hearted! I Definitely think it might be possible though. As for the Chevy block - is there really an easier engine to acquire for model making? ;)  The Tamiya Racing Mini Cooper kit also has those exact seats.  Man, it's begging to be done. The only thing I can see a problem with is getting the lights, and the back end."
ModelCars,sr6vl,rhs856,1 point,Wed Apr 25 16:47:30 2012 UTC,"The headlights shouldn't be hard. Any round lights should work. The back end will need some extensive sculpting. The tail lights could be made from clear red rod, or probably taken from a hot rod kit.  Why stop at a big block? Cram one of these in there. XD"

I'd use some solvaset to hold down the edges of the decal. If the bowtie had a little bit more defined edges I might consider painting but with those rounded edges it could get sloppy quick.

ModelCars,rpsgj,altrdgenetics,3,Mon Apr 2 18:27:14 2012 UTC,I don't have the link on me but they make printable decal sheets in white so you can use your computer to make the custom plates. If you have a scanner and the ability to remove the plate from her car you can make that incredibility easy on yourself. if not a well placed picture and some photoshop would solve it.

Now that you have the body painted and fixed up all nice.  How do you go about painting all the details like the windshield wipers without messing up the body.  I know the trim you use some BMF and for the panel lines I'm assuming a combination of a wash and a steady hand mixing in some cotton swabs or something along the way.

ModelCars,qru55,Littl3Bastrd,5,Sun Mar 11 19:45:24 2012 UTC,"With the one coat lacquer, no priming is necessary - so no worries. Uberdeath322 will tell you to make sure to completely wash (dish soap is fine) and dry the body and parts before you paint them - generally, I don't and I haven't been punished by the modelling gods... yet.  First, you may have other things that need to be painted the body's color. Hood? Mirrors? Scoops? Check the instructions twice to make sure that you have all the parts you need. I would glue things to the body that need to be glued (like mirrors, fascia, and hood scoops) before painting. If you are into sanding off mold lines, do that, too. Make sure that you go up to at least 1000 grit sandpaper with any sanding you do. The lacquer will not cover up the sand marks. If you don't sand it, however, then don't worry about it.  You may want to make something like this to hold your car.  Just make sure that it will hold your particular car and it is stable, or you may find it tipping over and ruining your beautiful new paint job.  Hold the can about 8-10 inches away from the body and make light passes. Be sure to start spraying before you get to the body and stop spraying after you are past it - this will keep the paint from building up on the sides.  With the one-coat lacquer, I usually do a couple (or three) passes over the car to ensure coverage. Make sure to get to the lower parts of the body. I find that when I spray paint, those areas are the ones to get the least coverage, as I am usually standing over the model.  If you need to paint the interior, Make sure that the outside has had time to dry completely before you attempt to touch/handle/fondle/kiss your car. I know the can says something like 20 minutes - give it an hour. Or two. You do not want to have to take off the lacquer to fix a thumbprint, 91% alcohol is expensive. When the paint is dry, Lay a piece of paper towel over your hanger stand and lay the car down on top (this will keep the metal hanger from scratching your car). You may want to put a piece of painters tape or two on it to keep the car attached to the stand. Spray the inside like you did the outside and, voila! You have a beautiful car that you can proudly post on /r/ModelCars. Good luck!"

ModelCars,qgetf,rhs856,1 point,Sun Mar 4 13:42:55 2012 UTC,"At some point.  I keep thinking that I should stop and weather it, but that would pretty much halt build progress for now.  My weathering paints are enamels and I have been building using Mr. Color and super glue, so it has been moving along quite quickly."
ModelCars,qdw52,rhs856,2,Fri Mar 2 02:37:25 2012 UTC,"It's not quite done, but there's enough here to get people started. This uses an aftermarket distributor, but you can definitely use a kit distributor instead. This will be added on to as I finish it!  Edit: 3/28/12 The tutorial has been finished and added to the sidebar!"
ModelCars,qdw52,Uberdeath322,2,Fri Mar 2 02:39:08 2012 UTC,"Thanks!  My hope is that YOU do this, too! It really isn't as crazy as it looks, and with a little practice and the right tools, could easily be done in an hour or less. There are varying degrees of detailing that could be done or left out - I tried to pick the ones that really make a difference and don't cause me to pull out my hair.  Get yourself some wire and give it a go!"
ModelCars,qdw52,Uberdeath322,2,Fri Mar 2 03:19:11 2012 UTC,Haha! I'm the same way. I'm so glad I made the switch to CA glue. It really cut down my waiting time.  Happy building!
ModelCars,qdqae,MD_in_training,3,Fri Mar 2 00:34:41 2012 UTC,You could take some super fine grit sand paper or just a rubbing cloth and take off the rough edge while retaining the flatness of the paint.
ModelCars,qdqae,jeepdave,3,Fri Mar 2 01:40:35 2012 UTC,"Agreed, sandpaper should knock down the texture. Sand it smooth and give it another coat of black. It sounds like the can was either held too far away from the car, or it was cold. Remember to warm up your can in some warm water for best results. As a side note, I've used Krylon Flat Black with much success. It's considerably cheaper than the Tamiya stuff and you get a ton.  You don't want to spray anything over it to try to smooth it out. I've been there. It will only get worse. :)  What is this flat black car you're building? Pics or it didn't happen!!"
ModelCars,qdqae,rhs856,2,Fri Mar 2 02:35:53 2012 UTC,i'll post a few pics soon!  the kit is sl63 amg.  this wasnt a can; it was acrylic tamiya paint from an airbrush.  any specifics on the grit on the sandpaper?  There's some detailing on the bumpers and such that I would think would be too hard to sand =/
ModelCars,qdqae,rhs856,3,Fri Mar 2 03:57:36 2012 UTC,Ahh. Then too far away I imagine.  I would start at 600-800 depending on how bad the texture is.  Work up to 1000 or 1200. Go around the details.  Just try to smooth down the big stuff.
ModelCars,qdqae,uncleawesome,2,Fri Mar 2 04:08:48 2012 UTC,Wet sand it.
ModelCars,q6cyf,Angus99,5,Sun Feb 26 04:57:48 2012 UTC,"This won't be step by step, but a few rules of thumb - the prime/paint/sand/paint sequence is generally just for the body, and any attachments (fascias, air damns, wings, etc) that are going to be body color.   You're trying to get the best possible (i.e. smooth, glass-like) finish.   The other parts that require painting are typically going to be simpler.   You'll clean those parts up, assemble them, sand them if necessary to remove molding lines and possibly have to fill gaps with either putty or a gap filling super glue, then sand as necessary to get a straight, clean part.  Then, they just need a simple prime and paint.   You don't typically have to sand between multiple coats of paint on engines, undercarriages, and interiors.  You may want to overcoat those parts with a flat, gloss, or semi gloss clear depending on what part and where it's located, but that's not going to be strictly necessary in most cases.   I hope this helps, let me know if it's not making sense."
ModelCars,q6cyf,Angus99,2,Sun Feb 26 05:58:14 2012 UTC,It makes sense but I have a question. Those engine parts are fairly small and would it look bad if I didn't sand the small parts and I just painted them right away? Should I use spray paint?
ModelCars,q6cyf,rhs856,3,Sun Feb 26 06:30:42 2012 UTC,"I would clean them first (all the plastic in the kit should get a bath in warm soapy water before you start to build, and be allowed to dry - make sure you rinse well - this gets read of mold release agents that can remain on the plastic from the manufacturer), do any necessary sanding to make sure that the part is straight and eliminate any lines or gaps, prime it, then paint it with either a brush or spray.   I try to use a spray wherever possible, but you cand also do a very nice job brush painting small parts."
ModelCars,q6cyf,rhs856,2,Sun Feb 26 13:34:58 2012 UTC,That really helps. I appreciate it.
ModelCars,q6cyf,rhs856,2,Sun Feb 26 22:18:29 2012 UTC,"If by sanding, you mean cleaning up mold lines, sink marks, and flash (extra plastic left over from the molding process), I sand nearly every part in a kit. Necessary? Probably not for everyone.   If you mean sanding paint to smooth it, Angus99 has good advice.  What was your first kit, BTW?"
ModelCars,q6cyf,Uberdeath322,2,Sun Feb 26 21:07:33 2012 UTC,It was a Tamiya Ferrari Formula 1 car. The parts were already painted so I am new to this.
ModelCars,q4f9w,rhs856,2,Fri Feb 24 19:17:59 2012 UTC,I bought a couple of kits this last weekend and one of them came with these lowrider wheels. I threw them on a 51 Chevy to see what it would look like...
ModelCars,q4f9w,Uberdeath322,1 point,Fri Feb 24 19:20:58 2012 UTC,"Ha ha, I think the title says it all.  I don't think those wheels work on that car at all.  They barely go with the kit that they came with by the picture on the box."
ModelCars,q4f9w,jonthedoors,2,Fri Feb 24 19:47:08 2012 UTC,"Well, they had better start working! They've got to go somewhere. =-D"
ModelCars,q4f9w,jonthedoors,2,Fri Feb 24 19:52:59 2012 UTC,Something tells me that'd look actually pretty cool on a heavily modded Beetle
ModelCars,q4f9w,Uberdeath322,3,Fri Feb 24 19:50:06 2012 UTC,Agreed! Something with a ton of gold BMF.
ModelCars,q4f9w,Uberdeath322,2,Fri Feb 24 19:51:48 2012 UTC,rat rod bro
ModelCars,q3m93,Uberdeath322,2,Fri Feb 24 04:24:43 2012 UTC,"That came out great! I can't see the smudge you're talking about, so I'll pretend I don't know about it. ;)  The stance makes this car. Is that the way it came, or did you raise the rear/lower the front?  Is that BMF for the trim or is it painted? Either way, it looks good.  What's next? The Personnel carrier?"
ModelCars,q3m93,rhs856,1 point,Fri Feb 24 16:23:46 2012 UTC,The car comes as like a 3 in 1 or 2 in 1 kit and provides what they called street options.  Thus the stacks on the engine and the raised suspension.  I thought it would look better like that.  The trim is all Alclad II chrome metallizer paint that I dry brushed on.  It looks better in the pictures at some spots and better in person in others.  It really depends upon how the light hits it.   Sometimes (being colorblind) I can't even see it without shining a strong light on it.  I think I am going to focus on the Personnel carrier next as I get the time.  I have been very busy with work and don't think I will be able to get a model done for that revell contest.  I will however build the dodge that I picked up either alongside the personnel carrier or after it.  Edit: Forgot to say thanks. Thanks!
ModelCars,q3m93,rhs856,2,Fri Feb 24 16:38:23 2012 UTC,Brushed on chrome! Excellent! It looks fantastic.  Also - Colorblind? Jeezum. I have a hard enough time doing detail work without being colorblind.
ModelCars,q3m93,rhs856,1 point,Fri Feb 24 19:16:56 2012 UTC,Yeah it makes it fun!  Add in some bad lighting and you got yourself a great building experience.  I enjoy this hobby too much to let the little things stop me. =)
ModelCars,q3m93,rhs856,2,Fri Feb 24 19:35:12 2012 UTC,"What kind of color blindness do you have? I was playing around with a color blind ""simulator"" to see what the car looks like to you and I was going to ask if it looked yellow to you, but then I realized that our perception of what is ""yellow"" isn't comparable. I'm like everyone who has ever pointed at something and asked you what color it is.  :-)"
ModelCars,prb5f,rhs856,2,Wed Feb 15 21:58:59 2012 UTC,"These pictures were taken as I opened this kit for the first time. Copyright date on the box is 1968, but I think this is a rerelease from later on (the internets haven't been too helpful on that one).   Very minimal; engine molded into the hood and chassis, interior is bare, and the surfboards are detailed on one side only. That being said, the details that are present are very crisp. The sides of the bin look great as do the figures that party inside.   The kit does not build into a 1/24 scale garbage truck by far, but that isn't why I liked it. I love its uniqueness. I love the extras (surfboards, horns, and trash cans for gas tanks?!?!). I LOVE that it's a GARBAGE TRUCK! It will be a fun slump breaker (I'm sure I'll need one after this Firebird project) that shouldn't take more than a few days to build."
ModelCars,prb5f,Uberdeath322,1 point,Wed Feb 15 22:10:26 2012 UTC,Well that is without a doubt a very unique kit.  Looks fun!
ModelCars,prb5f,altrdgenetics,2,Thu Feb 16 03:01:25 2012 UTC,That looks awesome. I wish there was more kits like this. I know that there are the Indian decked out lorries but this just looks plain fun.

ModelCars,pliao,rhs856,2,Tue Feb 14 19:44:51 2012 UTC,It's looking good... Too good. Time for some weathering. :)
ModelCars,pliao,rhs856,1 point,Sun Feb 12 13:54:20 2012 UTC,"Yeah, I have never done weathering before, so I am a little scared to start.  I will be playing around some today with what I have and see if I can find something I like for the engine."
ModelCars,pliao,rhs856,2,Sun Feb 12 14:56:30 2012 UTC,"The good news is, if you're going for weathered, you have the freedom to not have everything look ""good"". Here are my secrets for a gunky engine.   Gloss Black wash for oil Put a plop of petroleum jelly on a paper plate. With a toothpick, mix in a teeny bit of transparent red paint until you get a nice pink/red. Voila! Grease! Apply with a pin or toothpick in VERY small amounts. Dirt. Get real dirt, let it dry out, and put it everywhere. The finer the better. I've used this as dirt and for texture. You want mud? Mix it thick with gloss coat and plop it on."
ModelCars,pliao,rhs856,1 point,Sun Feb 12 16:09:02 2012 UTC,Here is my attempt at weathering.  I used a light brown and rust mix and a gloss black wash.
ModelCars,pk3ic,rhs856,1 point,Fri Feb 10 23:54:43 2012 UTC,"This looks really good.  Can we compile a list of common paints and determine what they are, and what kinds of cleaners will work on them (for cleaning brushes and airbrushes alike)?  I don't have an airbrush and don't know if they require different/special cleaners.  The only ones that I have experience with are:   testors enamels - paint thinner Model Masters enamels - paint thinner Model Masters acrylics - water AlcLad II Lacquer - Lacquer thinner Mr.Color Solvent based acrylics - Lacquer thinner   Edit: Found what can clean brushes of Mr. Color"
ModelCars,pk3ic,Uberdeath322,1 point,Sun Feb 12 01:11:58 2012 UTC,"Best paint stripper ever for styrene plastic, is automotive brake fluid. it will soften about 90% of the paint commonly used  (Lacquer or enamel), and I have literally left model parts soaking for months without the slightest softening of the plastic. Light brushing with an old toothbrush for the difficult places, and a good soap and water wash afterwards"
ModelCars,pg9si,Willum,5,Wed Feb 8 14:47:36 2012 UTC,"I don't mean to jack thread - but i've gotten some kits as gifts and i've been meaning to get into this.  I've some tamiya paint; i've just been painting it onto the kit with a brush.  What is the point of primer and how important is it that I have it?  Also, can I prime + paint and then glue the kit together?  I seem to think that the glue does not work on primer (I have the tamiya plastic melting glue)"
ModelCars,pg9si,MD_in_training,4,Thu Feb 9 23:22:37 2012 UTC,"I'm really not an expert, but primer is important because modelling paint is quite thin. The bare plastic will show through easily, and some paints may not actually set on the plastic and run off - that's why a primer is essential. I believe the priming and painting is done first, it depends on the kit though.  Perhaps the might want to leave a small part unpainted for the glue?  I've invested in an airbrush and a can of propellant - leaves a nicer finish than brushing. We'll see how that goes."
ModelCars,pg9si,MD_in_training,4,Fri Feb 10 00:17:03 2012 UTC,I actually have an airbrush as well.  i simply do not like how i pretty much have to go outside to do it =/.  massive annoyance...  I'll probably put in an order for the primer.
ModelCars,pg9si,rhs856,3,Fri Feb 10 00:57:45 2012 UTC,"Feel free to start a thread whenever. :) Primer gives a good base for the paint to stick to. You can prime, paint, then glue, but if you are using the glue you have, you'll need to scrape the paint away from the surfaces being glued.  Edit: I just remembered, be sure that your paint it's nice and warm (not hot) when you brush it. It will reduce brush strokes."
ModelCars,pg9si,Uberdeath322,3,Fri Feb 10 03:08:57 2012 UTC,"The type of glue you have works as a chemical bond.  It actually melts the plastic on both pieces and as the glue evaporates, the plastic settles and the two pieces become 'welded' together.  Primer on plastics is only really to give a better surface for the paint to adhere and smooth out tiny defects in the plastic.  I don't tend to prime because I don't have any need to.  My paint sticks on just fine, and I don't sand or scratch up my models too much, so I don't need to smooth out any imperfections that I introduce.  If you have to put multiple layers of paint on without primer, you will have to do the same with primer (maybe a little less, I have never had the need to use it).  If you get a different type of glue, then you can prime + paint then glue, otherwise you will have to follow what rhs856 said about scraping off the paint where you will have to glue (this sucks, so I suggest maybe using a small piece of tape or something to keep the areas you are going to glue clean)."
ModelCars,pg9si,MD_in_training,3,Fri Feb 10 03:33:41 2012 UTC,what kind of paint do you use?  I've got tamiya acrylics.
ModelCars,pg9si,Uberdeath322,2,Fri Feb 10 03:46:20 2012 UTC,"I have several types.  I use testors enamels.  Model Masters acrylics and enamels.  And I just got a shipment of Mr. Color acrylics (they are nice, but I need to get some mineral spirits so I can clean my brushes properly).  The testors are okay, they aren't great, but they aren't bad either.  The model masters enamels are about the same.  Their acrylics vary, or at least the ones I have do.  A few are extremely thin (mostly the lighter colors), but the darker colors and not so thinned down ones are good.  The Mr. Color paints are amazing (they smell really weird though).  As I mentioned though, I need mineral spirits to clean my brushes.  This is due to them being a solvent based acrylic rather than a water based acrylic.  I also have a bottle of Alclad II chrome Lacquer.  That stuff is REALLY hard to paint.  About the only way I can do it is by sort of dry brushing it on, but it does a pretty good job.  Unfortunately, it shows the flaws in my paint job really well.  I think a clear coat before application of it will fix that, or use it right after a primer.  You can look up lots of details about paint, by just going to the wiki page for the type of paint you have (acrylic, enamel, lacquer)."

ModelCars,pg9si,rhs856,3,Fri Feb 10 20:41:54 2012 UTC,"This should help some. There are many things that make modeling easier, but all are not necessary.  I second getting a hobby knife (and a few blades) and a sprue cutter. The sprue cutter will cut the parts off of the trees a lot better than a knife, and it will cut off the delicate parts without harming them. I would say that the minimum I would need to build a decent model would be:   A hobby knife (with replacement blades) Slow-drying super glue with small applicator tips Sand paper (400, 600, 800, 1000) Assorted paints for parts Paint for body (primer and color) Clear coat (not necessarily needed, but it makes things look nice) Tooth picks White glue   For primers, Tamiya and Testor's primers work well, and I have used Krylon Gray without trouble. I've also used Model Masters Aluminum Metalizer and really like it. Be cautious with primers that fill scratches or ""build up,"" as they could warp the plastic.  Zero Paints are solvent based acrylics. Here is the info I found about it - I hope you have ultra-zoom.  Have you airbrushed before? If not, you'll want to practice on something that isn't this model. Pick up some styrene sheets and cut them into business card sized pieces. Try some primers and shoot some paint on them.

To answer the question on his post, he was asking ""watcha building?"" I am currently building an 1982 Datsun 4x4. Now, for the second pic- look at my actual thumbnail my thumb is resting against a chrome valve cover and to the left of my thumb is the actual pic/box. How the hell do you paint stripes on a valve cover? How did rhs856 get such damn good detail?  Old man here, been doing this as best I could for past 35 years, but trying to get better. What are your paint secrets? Yes, I do use paper clips and toothpics for brushes sometimes, thats about advanced as I have ever got creatively. Take care and Merry Christmas/happy holidays/merry kwanza/happy hannuka- well wishes to you and yours."
ModelCars,ngvhl,rhs856,2,Sun Dec 18 01:27:25 2011 UTC,"Here's how I would do the valve covers: Carefully (or with tape to mask it off, this is probably the route I would take so I could be sure to get straight lines) paint the top of each valve cover red. The whole thing, letters and all. Then, you can do one of two things:  1) Get a q-tip. Soak it in thinner, dab the excess off on a tissue, then lightly rub the paint off the letters, or  2) Use a sanding stick to carefully sand the tops of the letters to take the paint off, but not the chrome.  To be honest, most of the detail on that Merc is in the plastic. I just painted it red, masked off the ribbing, and painted the rest black. The dash is decals and a little flat black paint on the knobs (tiny brushes and magnifiers are my friends, too). The seatbelts are ribbon and aluminum foil buckles that I cut out with a hobby knife. :)  I think one awesome thing that can happen in this subreddit is conversation about methods and trading of secrets. I know some modelers that compete are secretive of their ways, but I don't feel that way and I don't think others on here feel that way either. I would love to have conversations start up about methods that we notice on here.  By the way, awesome subject - I've never seen that model and I can't wait to see the finished product. If you have questions about how to make something look a certain way or how to do achieve a certain effect, make a post. As a matter of fact, can you take a picture of the interior pieces (dash, doors, and seats) and tell us what you want to do with them?"
ModelCars,ngvhl,rhs856,2,Sun Dec 18 03:13:42 2011 UTC,"THANK YOU! for that reply...Yes, here we go the dash pic + instructions are here  -no decals to put on.

Give me a few minutes, and I'll throw up pics of toyota 4x4's that I've done in past 10 years, trying to replicate my real life Toyota."
ModelCars,ngvhl,Angus99,2,Sun Dec 18 03:33:38 2011 UTC,"The dash in your kit is a little different that your 1:1 (which looks gorgeous for an 84!), but here's what I would try -   Without decals, I would try to drybrush the details. Here's how: Take your smallest brush, dip it in white, and then paint on a tissue until you don't see paint on it anymore. Pretend like you are painting on paper. The brush will still have some paint on it. Then, lightly, brush over the rised areas that you want to be painted white (gauges, radio, etc). Take your time and it may take more than one time. Make sure that you dip your brush and wipe almost all of the paint off on a tissue each time. This will keep the paint from rubbing off on things that aren't raised.  For the woodgrain, paint the base the lighter color of wood. Find a testors ""wood"" color or maybe ""tan"". After that dries, use a darker ""brown"" color with a thin brush to simulate woodgrain. Let your hands do the magic; a line here, a spot there. Woodgrain has a little pattern, but at this scale, if you put a few random lines on there, it will look like wood.  To answer your comment about washes, a wash is a very thinned down color. For example, on chrome parts (because enamel thinner won't affect them), I thinned down flat black with enamel thinner (about 1 parts black to 8-10 parts thinner) in an old paint jar. When I want to use it, I shake it up, and let the brush ""wick "" into areas that I want to be darker (like grilles or fins on valve covers). After it dries, it looks like this. On a chrome grille, this is the only way to fill in the areas that you would normally see through, and since it's so thin, it sinks into the cracks without painting the raised bars. If you use gloss paint, it comes out with a ""wet"" look, like water stains(the roof). If I want to wash something that I painted with enamels, I have another wash that I made with acryllic paint and water (same ratios), so the thinner doesn't mess with my paint. The great thing about washes is that when used sparingly, add a level of depth that you wouldn't normally achieve.  In my own life, patience is something that I work for. I teach high school math. :D I try to do hobbies that help me learn and practice this - homebrewing beer and modeling are the two I have right now. With homebrewing, I need to be patient if I want to enjoy the work I put into a beer. With modeling, I know that if I rush something, I am more likely to screw it up. Something that I have to keep reminding myself is that every model that I build is practice for the next. Every mistake that I make, no matter how small it is, is something that I can improve upon when I build my next model. I die a little bit each time something small messes up - the red lacquer on the seats peeled when I took off the masking tape, but instead of stripping the whole thing, I touched it up with an enamel that was close (but not the same) and told myself, ""The only person that will see this is you. It's ok.""  Long story short - let's see those toyotas! ;)"
ModelCars,ngvhl,Angus99,3,Sun Dec 18 04:13:36 2011 UTC,"Well, as one old man (I'm 48) to another, there's a couple of things I can share - and first is there's nothing wrong with paper clips and toothpicks if they work for the situation you're trying to address.  A couple of suggestions - I use a visor; the magnification helps tremendously, and works to give you much better detail vision (although not as good as being 20 again!).   Being able to see what you're doing, and clearly, is key.   Plus you can pretend you're an android from the future and scare the shit out of the cats.  Second, you have to be black belt with tape and masks.   You can mask to produce a tremendous amount of excellent detail if you're practiced, have multiple types and kinds and widths.   I work in a hobby shop - tape is not expensive, and you can make use plain blue painter's tape from places like Walmart for a lot of things.  You can also be very creative with liquid mask to apply multiple colors to all kinds of surfaces.  Third, you have to be comfortable with washes and highlighting.  Being able to whip up a wash to bring out dark detail in things like grill recesses and valve covers is very important, but you have to practice the technique.   Also, highlighting and drybrushing can make detail pop.  Neither are expensive techniques, just take time to get comfortable with.  Finally, you have to have quality brushes for detail, if you're not a ninja with an airbrush (which I'm not - I use the airbrush for painting the large surfaces, but I need a bunch more practice with it before I can freehand detail of any kind), then you'll be doing detail work with brushes.  When you do, cheap brushes mean cheap results.  Finally, for inspiration - you're as old as you feel.   I visited a place that builds horse drawn coaches using original tools.   I got to see the painter, painting the wheels.   The guy had to be pushing seventy, and he could free hand a pinstrip around the circumference of a wagon wheel that would blow you mind.   Laser straight, perfect width, perfect color - all of a sudden, I felt like Kwai Chang Caine sitting at the feet of Master Po (ha! also dating myself there, too)."
ModelCars,ngvhl,rhs856,2,Sun Dec 18 02:35:08 2011 UTC,"Thank you for that reply, and believe it or not, I'm 47, LOL. I am mechanically/electronically inclined, but I swear, whenever I watch TV shows about building/painting cars and bikes, I'm just blown away, because I AM NOT creative. To see them on TV saying ""well if you throw this color down, then tape this off, it brings out point A"". I honestly just don't get it. Same with detailing example valve cover.   Third, you have to be comfortable with washes and highlighting. Being able to whip up a wash to bring out dark detail in things like grill recesses and valve covers is very important, but you have to practice the technique. Also, highlighting and drybrushing can make detail pop. Neither are expensive techniques, just take time to get comfortable with.   I can try this, but seriously, I have NO CLUE what it actually means. I know ""wash""...nope, no I don't, I just re-read paragraph. Are there any good youtube videos about painting/having patience?

Are you planning on customising the Beetle you're building?  I remember from a few days ago you've given it a bit of a rod paintjob, so I get the impression you've got some tricks up your sleeve for it."

Hopefully santa will be able to fit that mosquito down the chimney. ;)  I'm going to repaint the Beetle (it's never good enough, you know!), but I have no crazy plans for it. Tamiya kits are so nice, I don't have the heart to do too much to it. Green metallic exterior, light green interior.  I'm really pumped about using enamels to airbrush, so I think I'm going to paint and finish a few bodies. That way, the hard part is over."

Its my first model car in over a decade and last time I was a young boy with the aid of his father, so I'm kinda rusty. I never really looked up what to do first and just kinda jumped in. Many mistakes were made but I feel like I learned a lot and will do much better next time.   I'm trying to get my hands on another kit as well as some paint and supplies I didn't even consider on the first run. But student life leaves me pretty broke.   Ill probably post pictures here sometime, I've been putting it off since I found this subreddit."

The interior will be cradled by the frame/chassis, firewall and body, and shouldn't go anywhere.  Also, I have found this tight fit issue to be especially common with 60s-70s muscle cars.

They've suddenly got a lot of repackaged older McLaren models coming out.  Scale Motorsport & Tabu sell the West decals for this kit if you're interested.  They're not allowed to come with the kit since they're a cigarette brand.  Apparently the kit also doesn't come with the Bridgestone decals for the tyres because of some copyright reason.  There are also aftermarket decals for those.  I look forward to seeing it finished.  You've motivated me to give that Martini Porsche 935 a try.

Or go one further and do the Le Mans 'Moby Dick' version, because it looks hardcore. I found it a really satisfying build, very simple and very quick!

ModelCars,kdyxi,El_Suavador,3,Tue Sep 13 06:15:24 2011 UTC,"Conventional wisdom regarding resin generally is that it needs a light wash to remove any mould release agents - a light detergent solution is suitable, apparently...  Be extremely cautious about flying resin dust - that stuff is extremely harmful when inhaled; wear a filter mask, wet sand when you have to, and I used to cut over the mouth of a handy vaccuum cleaner hose (I taped a piece of old pantyhose over the mouth of the tube, just in case I overcooked the cutting and lost a bit of detail).   Small holes/air bubbles can be filled with superglue gel, larger holes can be plugged with plastic scrap superglued in place and sanded back to size/shape.  Don't breathe the resin dust.  Painting should proceed in the normal manner - a few light passes with a primer coat to give a binding coat across the whole model and away you go.  Did I mention about breathing the resin dust..? It's not advisable.  Heaps of references available online, most of which suggest not breathing the resin dust."

That's not to say you can't get good results with (often cheaper and bigger) non-model spray cans, but generally there are some rules to follow...  Spray in a ventilated, dust-free environment - a spray booth does not have to have a full-on fume extraction system and layers of charcoal filtering, but it's always handy to use a respirator or filter mask when using aerosols of any kind.  Mount the parts you're spraying on a turn table - I bought a cake decorating turntable from a secondhand shop for a couple of bucks, doesn't matter that it's now covered in every colour in the cammo rainbow... Rotate the model as you spray and you 'll get more even coverage.  Spray in several passes - it's better to do several light passes than one heavy coat (which may be why you're getting the 'runs'...). And let each light pass dry properly before spraying again.  Finally, make sure to 'warm' the cans up - because the propellant is 'cold', this can cause the paint to thicken; to warm the cans up, just immerse them in warm water for ten minutes or so (you might have to weight them down if they start floating).  Hope this all helps - it's worked for me..."
ModelCars,jfybp,munky_g,1 point,Fri Aug 12 00:38:33 2011 UTC,"Thank you for the insight! Yes, I am using Testors brand lacquer. The turn table seems like a ridiculously easy solution and now I'm wondering why I never thought of using one. Having a surface to set the body on while painting was a problem I ran into, I ended up just hanging it outside.   Also, did not know about warming the cans up. Obvious now I'm brand new to all of this! Not being able to paint the body perfectly has set me back from continuing the model, but now I'm pretty sure I'll be able to start it up again with the help of this friendly subreddit!   Thanks again"
ModelCars,jfybp,rhs856,2,Fri Aug 12 01:25:02 2011 UTC,I've had good luck with testors lacquers. Any WIP photos?
ModelCars,jfybp,rhs856,2,Fri Aug 12 01:27:42 2011 UTC,"I could take some tonight and get them on! I could also take photos of the body to to show the damage done, but currently I have only completed the engine."
ModelCars,jfybp,rhs856,2,Fri Aug 12 01:33:45 2011 UTC,"It doesnt sound like any damage was done that cant be fixed. :-) If you want to take the lacquer off to start over, rubbing alcohol in a little tub will get it off in a few days. Sorry for the multiple orangereds!"

ModelCars,jfybp,mating_toe_nail,2,Fri Aug 12 02:53:48 2011 UTC,"Other things to consider:  Primer will definitely help in adhesion. If you're getting runs, you may be spraying too much or too close. Munky_g is right about light passes, with your first couple coats, you should still see the primer through the paint layers.  Test your paint first. Some paints will react with the plastic and/or other paints they touch. What paint are you using?   PS Absolutely you can get a great paint job with a rattle can! Don't give up!"
ModelCars,jfybp,mating_toe_nail,2,Fri Aug 12 00:52:22 2011 UTC,"you may be spraying too much or too close   Yeah, I couldn't keep the distance from the can to the body consistent because of the weird angle I had to spray from. Munky_g suggested using a turntable, which is going to be my next purchase tomorrow.   I will use primer next time, and if I get it perfect this second attempt, I shall post photos so you can see the results! I would post some now, but sadly to say all I have completed was the engine (426 Hemi)."
ModelCars,jfybp,rhs856,2,Fri Aug 12 01:32:23 2011 UTC,"You could also make a stand out of a wire coat hanger ;-) but a turntable is a good investment. When you post your pics, make a new post and I'll add it to the WIP section of the sidebar."

ModelCars,jfybp,rhs856,2,Fri Aug 12 01:41:21 2011 UTC,I found that painting with Testors enamels was a hit or miss. Even after weeks of drying I found the paint too soft to easily polish to a high luster.  Thoroughly priming the body and painting with regular car lacquer rattle cans yielded the much better results for me.  However I remember doing LOTS of sanding and polishing afterwards with super fine sandpaper(>2000grit) and rubbing compound in order to get a super shiney paint job.  PS: I haven't painted a body in over 12 years so I might have just been a shitty painter.

ModelCars,iu2ok,rhs856,1 point,Tue Jul 19 19:00:36 2011 UTC,"Here is a tutorial (with pics) on how to use Rustall. Granted, there are many ways to ""rust"" a car, but this brings up some interesting techniques.   For the poverty stricken modeler, you could substitute this:  1) Rust colored paint  2) Blackwash (1 part flat black, 5-9 parts thinner (I lean toward the 9))  3) Some dirt. Let it dry in the sun, and then filter out the big stuff. I picked up a fish net from my local pet store and this does an outstanding job; just make sure that the mesh is really fine or else you will have scale boulders in your paint. =-)  4) Dullcoat  The Rustall system runs about $17-$20. With the net and if you buy the little jars of testors paint and thinner, you are looking at $10 or less depending on what you have in your arsenal already."

For the 283 smallblock, there are a few kits that have them, including the 57 Chevrolet. ""Black Widow"" and the 65 Chevy Stepside.  Jon is right about practice.

ModelCars,iqute,jonthedoors,1 point,Sat Jul 16 10:02:36 2011 UTC,"The guys have given you the best advice on making a model - I just wanted to add your Dad was right!  I'm 48 (not ""coot"" territory just yet I hope) but I had a '67 Malibu when I was 18, and it was a sweet car.   It had the 283 with 2 speed Powerglide automatic.   Mine was a hardtop.    The challenge you're going to have is that nobody wants to model the Malibu, it was the entry level kind of trim.   Most of the models are for the SS/396 version, which was the real performance model.   So, most everything off the shelf has the SS hood and bigger engine, which means you have to go the resin replacement route jonthedoors and rhs856 advise.  That's not trivial if you're new to making models; you'll have some fiddly work and painting you'll need to cover.   If you don't want to mess with that, go to Ebay and browse the diecast section - you can find finished models there, although none will be a Malibu match - but if you got him an Ertl 1/18 scale SS version, I'm betting he wouldn't mind too much.   Good luck, and let us know how it goes!   And let him know he's not the only one that looks back fondly at that car!"

Here's a sneak peek.  I may need to do another coat on the top half of the body, and possibly the cowling, and I'm still tossing and turning over leaving the yellow stripe to decals or to spray it on. I know I'll get a better finish with the spray, but masking will be tricky and I really don't want to mess things up! Not only that, the decals are already the right size and shape, making it that much more authentic... not to mention it's a hell of alot easier, not having to worry about the green acting under the yellow spray, which if it messes up I think I'll have to strip and start over!

To get dark colors in the panel lines I use a sludge wash or preshade the area finely with my airbrush.  Look around the net for Finescale Magazine and Scale Auto Magazine.  Goodluck."
ModelCars,gznpv,jonthedoors,1 point,Thu Apr 28 22:00:45 2011 UTC,"Tamiya makes very detailed and very clean kits (meaning that you can paint and glue nearly everything without worrying about flash or mold lines). What I've seen has been as beautiful in the box as it was put together. :-)  If you like exotics, you chose a good brand.  1) Car kit axels are usually one or two pieces with the rear end. If a model comes with rotors, they will attach on the end behind the wheel, or are a piece that fits into the back of the wheel. Engines can be anywhere from 10-20 pieces (or more) depending on the detail and the type.   2) I know that spray paint is pricey where you are, so really just spray the body. It will make a big difference, and you'll be happy. I mostly brush engines and detail pieces, and spray bomb everything that's black all at once to save time.  3) Every tip or technique I find, I post here. Some good ones, though - use toothpicks to apply little bits of glue, glue and paint things as a unit if they're all the same color (likes engine halves), and prefit everything. If you have questions, take a picture and send a message. Best piece of advice I know is patience. When I rush, I mess something up every time."
ModelCars,gznpv,rhs856,2,Thu Apr 28 23:47:55 2011 UTC,"That's great, thanks for the tips! I was definitely going to spray the bodywork. There's no other way around it.   I'll be sure to let you know how it comes along! :D"
ModelCars,gznpv,rhs856,1 point,Fri Apr 29 02:35:08 2011 UTC,Awesome. Have fun!
ModelCars,gznpv,rhs856,1 point,Fri Apr 29 20:54:32 2011 UTC,"Before I start - any tips on spray paint? I know to start off the part, go over and finish off the part - but is there any special way/best way to apply it, and get the best possible finish?"
ModelCars,gznpv,rhs856,1 point,Mon May 2 12:26:55 2011 UTC,Everything you need. :-)
ModelCars,gznpv,rhs856,1 point,Mon May 2 22:38:05 2011 UTC,Fantastic! Cheers!
ModelCars,gvg0h,jonthedoors,1 point,Sat Apr 23 01:43:38 2011 UTC,"Awesome review! The decals sound like they need some dull coat - like clear coat, but not shiny. It may also hide some of the edge.  I think about my mistakes in the same way, ""This will serve as a reminder to not do that again!"" Every model we build is practice for our next.  Nice work on the Apache!"
ModelCars,gsypo,rhs856,1 point,Mon Apr 18 18:57:20 2011 UTC,Looks like a nice kit! Can't wait to see it finished
ModelCars,gsypo,jonthedoors,1 point,Sat Apr 23 01:47:00 2011 UTC,"It may be awhile, I'm in the middle of three right now! 57 Chevy, 64 Fairlane, and a 55 Nomad. ;-)"
ModelCars,gs2s9,rhs856,1 point,Sun Apr 17 15:04:08 2011 UTC,"Available: Unmarked, North Carolina SP, Illinois SP, Florida SP, Texas SP, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. All they need is a 1/24 shotgun. ;-)"

ModelCars,gqhb7,technolizzard,1 point,Wed May 4 05:36:24 2011 UTC,"All i know is its harder and more brittle than styrene. I have an article somewhere, when I find it, I'll send it to you."
ModelCars,gpv2s,rhs856,1 point,Thu Apr 14 12:47:20 2011 UTC,"The decals aren't my cup of tea, but I bet they would look good on an old pickup!"
ModelCars,go6pf,rhs856,1 point,Tue Apr 12 13:13:47 2011 UTC,Great tip! :D
ModelCars,go6pf,jonthedoors,1 point,Wed Apr 13 01:38:40 2011 UTC,"Thanks. On your next paint job, use 3 spoons. Prime one grey, one black,  and leave one white. Use your paint on all three and compare. You may find that one primer works better than another."

ModelCars,glj10,AtomicYeti,1 point,Fri Apr 8 15:44:22 2011 UTC,Nice--your personal paint job?  The details are great.
ModelCars,glj10,metamorphaze,1 point,Fri Apr 8 15:57:45 2011 UTC,"This is really cool. I found more Revell Star Wars kits here. What's next? A TIE Fighter, perhaps? ;-)"
ModelCars,gkxkn,metamorphaze,1 point,Thu Apr 7 18:39:26 2011 UTC,"Go right ahead, pal. ;-) This was done in Word and Paint, believe it or not."
ModelCars,gj966,rhs856,1 point,Tue Apr 5 17:54:46 2011 UTC,This will definitely be happening on the Torino.   adds 2 hours to the build time
ModelCars,gj64f,rhs856,1 point,Tue Apr 5 16:04:11 2011 UTC,Finished! Click on link for photos.
