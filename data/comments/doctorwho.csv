I know the hivemind is going to downvote me to oblivion, but every time I see the word tasteful or hear it, it pisses me off. Who is anyone to decide what is tasteful or not?  Art is a personal thing, and if someone wants to see completely naked women doing whatever, then let it be their thing. Judging them for their taste in art is right up there with judging a person for their fetishes.   The worst part is that this has been a constant problem throughout history and is still ongoing. Time and time again, people or groups always try to decide what art is ""lewd"" or not, or tries to censor art based off of some other nonsensical standard.  Art causes emotional reactions, and again, who is anyone to judge another for the emotions that are elicited? Especially if said emotions are nothing but sexual. Sexuality is a positive thing for anyone to explore, and a negative thing to withold from them, with the exception of when said sexuality will harm others.  Always remember the foremost rule of freedom, if it doesn't directly harm another person, there is nothing wrong with it."

One day, you're going to want adult things. Obviously OP already has a wife - what if you wanted to have people you've just met over for dinner? Do you think explaining to them that Doctor Who is your favourite show so you themed your house with pictures is going to make a good conversation? You've invited them into your house and if you want to be a good host it's your job to entertain. Halo is my favourite game series but if I went to someone's house for the first time and made a slight Halo reference and someone spent the rest of the night trying to only talk about Halo, I'd be bored to death. This happened.   Adult things means not putting your favourite TV shows on display to invite other people's views on it by presenting it and it's about having the social skills to work in getting these adult things.

doctorwho,3dzunm,Mobius6432,3,Mon Jul 20 22:07:20 2015 UTC,"1) Nah, I don't think so. It's usually referred to as the Gauntlet of Rassilon, like everything else belonging to Rassilon. Plus the Resurrection Gauntlet seems to do just one thing and that's bringing people back to life. But the GoR seems to disintegrate people, send objects through time and can magically alter the biology of an entire race. I would say it was connected to the Hand of Omega in some way, but there's nothing to really say that.  2) It's pretty much anyone you want it to be at this point. Romana, Susan, the Doctor's mother, Ace, Patience, there's been no evidence or deliberate implication of who it is meant to be so take your pick and run with it. RTD said he thought it would the Doctor's mum, so there's that.  EDIT: Oops, didn't notice someone had answered it already."

doctorwho,3dzunm,ProtoKun7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"I think the fourth Doc is a good starting point. He's one of the most popular Doctors ever for a reason. His first episodes are still up on that sub. The first one is ""Robot"" which is not that great tbh but maybe worth watching to see his personality emerge out of the regen crazies.  If you want though you can watch the start of Robot and then skip to ""Ark in Space"" and continue from there.   The classic stuff has a much slower pace but that means that some of the stories get to do a lot more world building and there are waaay less deus ex machina moments where something comes out of nowhere and saves the day. There's a bigger emphasis on the Doctor doing detective work and problem solving than there is in much of the new stuff. Also, there's less drama around the companions and adventures sometimes feel almost like low key hang outs on alien planets. This can take some getting used to but give it a shot for sure, there's some really great stuff in the first few Tom Baler seasons."

Fortunately the eighth Doctor has lots of great jumping on points:    Storm Warning - the first eighth Doctor story for Big Finish, begins a series that basically goes up to The Girl that Never Was Blood of the Daleks - the start of the Eighth Doctor Adventures, featuring Lucie bleedin' Miller. This series was basically a relaunch in partnership with BBC radio and stylistically is modelled a little closer to the 2005 series (longer, self contained episodes, modern working class companion).  Dark Eyes - first of four connected releases telling the story of the eighth Doctor and Molly O'Sullivan in an epic battle against the Daleks, the Master and new baddie the Eminence.  coming soon Doom Coalition - first of four connected releases with the eighth Doctor, Liv Tyler (from Dark Eyes 2) and River Song. Big Finish promises that this will be a new jumping on point for fans.    There's also a few releases featuring Mary Shelley and I think they sort of stand alone if you want something more affordable."

doctorwho,3dz227,KITTvsKARR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:50 2015 UTC,Matt filmed them out of sequence.  If you watch his doctor in the first few weeping angel episodes and Churchill episode he is noticeably  different in style as he was finding the character.  The 11th hour was filmed later and he is MUCH more grounded and it shows as a better episode.  Peter did his first episode first but he is a MUCH more experienced mature actor.  He doesn't change much from the first to later episodes aside from the post regeneration confusion.

Possibly sooner than you think if you haven't watched ANY of season 8.  All the old Doctors are still alive and having their adventures. The show just focuses on the latest at the time, with the occasional multi-Doctor special. But in novels and audio dramas and comics and such, every incarnation still lives on. 8 only had one crappy movie and one pre-50th short, yet I've spent enough time listening to his audio dramas that he's the Doctor I've invested the most time in.  The show changes, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. Just don't think of it as a replacement, since they're all still around doing their timey wimey things :)"

doctorwho,3dz227,I_4m_4w3s0m3,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:58 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, the first episode of the season was specifically tailored to viewers such as yourself. I think you'll really appreciate the end :)"
doctorwho,3dz227,TheGallifreyan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:30 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind a major point of season 8 is very much that the Doctor needs to figure himself out again after changing his history to erase the destruction of Gallifrey (which has motivated a lot of his character development), being stuck fighting a war watching people grow up and die fighting for 900 years and living past the point he thought he was going to die for sure after all of that. The Doctor doesn't have to try to hide who he is anymore but that means he has to figure out who he really is after all of that too.   All of this is to say, where he starts out at the beginning of the season as a character is noticeably different than where he is at the end so don't panic if you don't have him figured out after the first few episodes like you probably did with Matt. That's kind of the point.  Oh and for what it's worth, I actually think Capaldi brings back a lot of gravitas that Tennant had but Smith struggled with at times. Tennant is still my favorite overall but Capaldi does a really good job of embodying the character in all these little subtle expressions and vocal inflections. It seems like they focus more on what he conveys with his face rather than showing Smith waving his arms around all the time. I think he has the potential to beat Tennant for me after another series or two and after series 8 he's ahead of Smith in my book."
doctorwho,3dz227,TheGallifreyan,4,Mon Jul 20 20:42:36 2015 UTC,"I knew I wasn't going to like Capaldi at first (and i didn't). But by the end of the first episode of series 8 he was awesome, and the rest of series 8 was just as awesome. Give it a try, there's been many faces of the doctor, and I think they're all great"
doctorwho,3dz227,janisthorn2,2,Mon Jul 20 21:03:30 2015 UTC,"I thought it was decent for a first season. I feel like this season will be much better.  For me, every Doctor takes about a season for the actor and writers to really know who that Doctor is. With Capaldi, I feel like they embraced that. The Doctor himself didn't know who he is now, and stuggled with it all season, figuring it out in the finale.   I can't wait to see him fleshed out personality he has is series 9."

doctorwho,3dz227,Leecannon_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"I think a better plan would be to rewatch his first season. See how much he changes in his second season. With Matt, it think it's a case of him understanding the subtleties of The Doctor better. However, he pretty much seems to have known what his Doctor was like.   In Capaldi's case, he already understands who The Doctor is. I think he needed a season for him and his to understand who his Doctor is.   It's sort of the same case with Tennant. Maybe his first season would be the best thing to rewatch."

The whole ""David just broke down and said that and it was actually him talking, not the character!"" is some weird fan invention from fans who can't accept that he wanted to leave the role.  It's the same as the fans who insist his speech to the Fifth Doctor in Time Crash was either unscripted or Tennant himself talking (when Tennant's always said Tom Baker was ""his"" and his favourite Doctor). Or the story about how the scene at the end of Stolen Earth when the Doctor sees Rose was the first time Tennant had actually laid eyes on Billie Piper since she left, that he didn't even know she was going to be in that episode, so it's actually his real reaction you're seeing, and not acting. It's just weird, some fans can't accept that what they're seeing on screen is acting."

doctorwho,3dtr6o,Jackuita,19,Sun Jul 19 11:16:32 2015 UTC,"Actual cracks in an actual wall that were originally intended to be connected to that arc? No.  However, in The Next Doctor Ten wonders why no-one remembers the Cyberking in Victorian London, which seems to be hinting that that event is connected to the cracks. To be more specific, that the Cyber's return to London from the void was possible because of some event - the cracks - weakening the walls of the universe. This is never spelled out explicitly though, so is open to interpretation.  Additionally, once the Cracks arc had completed, RTD mentioned that he thought that the Cardiff Rift - which originally appeared in Series 1, of course, had probably closed along with the cracks.   So overall, with one interpretation of a hint, and a bit of out-of-universe retconning, you could say that they were around during Tennant time, and before.  Indeed, if you look back into Classic Who, you can find cracks, rifts and other similar sounding things right the way back to Two's time at least if you really want to interpret them that way."
doctorwho,3dtr6o,GreyShuck,2,Sun Jul 19 12:11:08 2015 UTC,I always thought that the reason nobody remembered the Cyberking was because of the Silence wiping everyone's memory of it.
doctorwho,3dtr6o,TheIronTARDIS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that sounds like a perfectly good interpretation too.   Of course the Silence were ultimately responsible for the cracks, so it is just one more step to add the same chain of events, I suppose, if you look at it in that light.  Were you thinking that they removed memories of this event particularly or that they have been doing this with most or all alien  incursions?  I suppose that if we imagine that they have been doing this as a matter of course throughout the Post-Time-War version of human history (so for all Nu-Who stories) all the way up to 1969 then it would make quite a bit of sense. They must have missed the werewolf attack on Queen Victoria that led to Torchwood being set up, but otherwise it would account for why the other historical events don't seem to get much mention.  Exactly why they would want to is another matter for conjecture, I suppose."

Lots of episodes (especially early on) are pretty bad - really contrived plots and deus ex machina endings. Every once in a while, there's one that's absolutely incredible, like ""Blink"" (season 3, episode 10). There had been a few others before it, but after ""Blink"", I wondered if they had just figured it out, and was anxious to watch the next one.   Next one was terrible.   Here's what I wish someone would have told me early on. It sounds obvious, but most of it is the writer. Davies deserves the credit for bringing the show back, but Steven Moffat episodes really stand out. He was behind the series Sherlock - those were great, right?   Starting with season 5, with the 11th doctor, Moffat takes over as the head writer. The show (to my eye) is completely different. It's more moody and story-driven than fun and whimsical.   Anyway, so, get excited when you see Steven Moffat in the opening credits, and welcome!  Edit: I realized I forgot to mention how amazing David Tennant (10th Doctor, seasons 2-4) is. He carries a lot of the ""meh"" scripts. That guy is incredible."

I live in America and getting ahold of Classic Who when I was younger was impossible. The show became a memory. Fast forward to 2008 and I'm able to start watching the 2005 Series, starting with the 9th Doctor. Somewhere during 11's reign I managed to get ahold of all of Classic Who that is in existence from someone else. Because the way BBC stores their film reels back then, some episodes (more than one episode constituded an adventure) are missing. Some have audio only, some still only, some have a mix. I have since started from ""An UnEarthly Child"" - Serial (That's what they call them there.) all the way to the end of Season 8 of the 'reboot'. I have the 1996 movie and the Peter Cushing 1965 movie (mixed on how it relates or if it's even part of Doctor Who.) You can start with the reboot. However, there are many, many references to the Doctors past incarnactions, times, locations, monsters, etc. throughout. You'd have to go to the wiki: http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Who_Wiki (which is the best place for info) to find out about Classic Who and other references from it you'll miss from not watching those episodes. I won't ruin it for you. It took me a long time to go through all the episodes. A GREAT journey through time and space with the world's oldest 5-year old! :P"

My dad was terrified of the original Cybermen as a kid, but thinks they're a joke now.  It must be pretty difficult being a writer for Dr Who these days. If you use something old, even with a new twist, people call it boring, tired and overused. Use something new and people bitch that it's not keeping to the spirit of the show.  Even with that, as you point out poorly written episodes and kill anything. For example I kinda liked recent episode, Flatline, with the two dimensional beings. They're in part an old-timey sci-fi trope, but also an antithesis to Timelord tech. But there just felt something...off I guess, about the whole thing. I seemed like it was half thought through."

Delgado's was great but he was supposed to be on a redemption arc and was more just ""the Doctor but power hungry"" than anything else. I wouldn't describe him as ""scary"" really.   The cybermen have had it the worst, but that was happening during classic who as well. They really should be used sparingly and focused on the idea of body horror and people agreeing to be turned into them out of necessity. I think the series 8 finale was one of the better uses of them, but it still had major flaws.   I think the cybermen work the best when they are clearly a disturbing mishmash of technology and biology. The old effects actually did this better because the fact that they looked like normal people in bizarre costumes drove home the idea they were normal people underneath."

A Death in the Family and Lucie Miller/To the Death are a couple of my favourites, but part of what makes them so great are the stories and character development leading into them.  EDIT:  It's usually a good place to start when they introduce a new companion or reinvent a team.  Examples:  5/Nyssa/Tegan/Turlough: Cobwebs (listen to Circular Time first)  5/Peri/Erimem: The Eye of the Scorpion  6/Evelyn: The Marian Conspiracy  6/Jamie: City of Spires (these are very stand-alone)  7/Ace/Hex: The Harvest  7/Klein: A Thousand Tiny Wings (listen to Colditz first)  8/Charley: Storm Warning  8/Lucie: Blood of the Daleks"

doctorwho,3dp5ri,medes24,2,Sat Jul 18 06:10:31 2015 UTC,And those are just the ones involving The Doctor.  I think almost all of the spin-offs have 1 hour stories.
doctorwho,3dn1wz,JackFate,9,Fri Jul 17 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  The show critiques blind faith, but not faith itself.  I don't think it's anti or pro religion."
doctorwho,3dn1wz,JuanPedia,2,Fri Jul 17 23:31:23 2015 UTC,Indeed - Faith in the Doctor is pretty important in some episodes
doctorwho,3dn1wz,ChronaMewX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"Right. In the episode ""God Complex"" 11 and a Muslim woman are talking and she says she's Muslim before jokingly saying ""Don't be scared."" And 11 just chuckles and moves on with the conversation.  I think it's a good distinction to make, critiquing blind faith but not faith itself. When held by a good heart and an open mind faith can be a powerfully enriching, fulfilling thing. It is for me."
doctorwho,3dn1wz,Avatar_Yung-Thug,5,Sat Jul 18 05:46:31 2015 UTC,"""Can you hear them? All these people who lived in terror of you and your judgment. All these people whose ancestors devoted themselves, sacrificed themselves, to you. Can you hear them singing? Oh, you like to think you’re a god. Well, you’re not a god, you’re just a parasite, eaten out with jealousy and envy, and longing for the lives of others. You feed on them. On the memory of love, and loss, and birth, and death, and joy, and sorrow.""  I kind of think this is the Doctor's opinion on all religions. There's always a man behind the curtain, and those beings don't make things good or evil, people think that those beings make things good or evil. I think the Doctor knows that behind every religion was once some individual or story, and people can believe what they like, as long as it doesn't harm them or anyone else, but everything has an explanation, from, ""The god is a robot in a cape"" to, ""The god is a fairytale."" I don't think he believes that gods are real, he's come across enough bodiless, formless, ethereal beings with matter-bending abilities in his time to know everything's made of something. Especially, 'gods.'"

doctorwho,3dn1wz,Anonymous--Rex,3,Sat Jul 18 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"I've thought the same at times. But 11's regeneration speech gave me a new perspective: ""We all change, when you think about it. We are all different people all through our lives and that's okay, that's good you've got to keep moving so long as you remember all the people that you used to be.""  Rather than think about the Doctor's many regenerations as akin to the reincarnation of specific souls after death, I think it's even more interesting to consider how it mirrors our lifelong evolution as individuals. Am I really the ""SAME"" ""ME"" as I was ten or twenty years ago? I've got a different face, a different body, a different view of the world, a different sense of humor...and yes, considering that every cell in my body has since been replaced, even different kidneys."
doctorwho,3dn1wz,Anonymous--Rex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"I think ""Last of the Time Lords"" makes perfect sense in a universe that already has psychic abilities.  It wasn't exactly explained as such, but it's not much of a stretch to think an entire planet's population focusing their mental aptitude on a single point could do what we saw there.  ""Magic is just science we don't understand yet."" - Arthur C. Clarke.  Anyway, I don't think your observations are anything unique to Who.  Those are just typical scifi tropes.  It's a running theme in Who only because it's a running theme in all of science fiction.  In turn, that's merely because it's an extension of what we've been doing as a species for quite some time.  We like to understand why things work, but sometimes we don't have the means of finding it out, so we create explanations.  Later, we develop those means and overturn what we thought was true.  This isn't just confined to folkore and religion, but also science and observation.  The Rebel Flesh, Time of the Angels, Silence in the Library, Waters of Mars, and The Doctor Dances, all show this type of thing happen in different ways while not being about religion."
doctorwho,3dn1wz,ChronaMewX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:37:31 2015 UTC,"Very good points Rex. The Clarke quote is an extremely succinct and accurate version of what I was getting at with this post. As to the general sci-fi trope you mentioned, I thought about that the other day after ruminating on this post. And yes, it's seen in SO MUCH of the best sci-fi out there, which is probably one of the reasons I've always been so drawn to the genre. That being said, some stories/shows/films/franchises seem to embrace it more wholeheartedly and unapologetically than others. In Who there is virtually no room whatsoever for the ""mysteries"" of magic or unknowable supernatural forces (I'm at a loss to think of any, and if you can point me in the direction of some I'd be happy to get you thoughts). EVERYTHING has an explanation, and finding that explanation is often the Doctor's primary goal in a given story.  This leads me to think of a friend who loves sci-fi but could never fully embrace Star Trek TNG solely because of Q (who I personally happen to love). He feels like Q's unexplained omniscience and omnipotence is too close to some sort of god-like conception, which threw a real wrench in the SCI half of the FI whole. And when you think about it, a character like Q has never—and most likely will never—exist in Who, because the show just doesn't meddle in the unexplained (or, at the very least, unexplainable).   This also makes me think of Battlestar, and while I consider it one of the greatest sci-fi franchises in recent history it REALLY goes off the rails whenever it tries to incorporate thoughts on ""GOD"" or spirituality (oh how dreadfully rotten were the fruits those branches produced).  Anyhow, thoughtful input!"

doctorwho,3dmyb9,TheEmpiresBeer,3,Fri Jul 17 17:13:38 2015 UTC,"I would caution you to not make it overly theme-y. I mean, it's your wedding so do what you want, but remember that it is also about your families who might not know anything about DW. Having tardis blue as a color and small details are cool, but having everything incredibly DW comes across as a theme party and not a wedding (unless you want a theme party as a wedding! Nothing wrong with that!) I guess what I'm saying is my suggestion is to incorporate your love of DW in classy hints rather than in-your-face props everywhere.    So some ideas would be use subtle DW quotes in your vows or on the invitations, use gallifrean writing on things (it's a pretty design to non-who fans), bowties and converse are cool as are the tardis blue dresses, stars/spacey galaxy stuff (little sprigs of stars in your bouquet, swirly galaxy patterns on tables or as chair backs, etc) suggest the space travel of DW, you can read your vows out of River's journal or use it as a guest book, etc. And congrats!"

doctorwho,3dksgy,Kargor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:03:24 2015 UTC,"Posters on the other subreddits may be able to give more eloquent recommendations for viewing the Classic Doctors. Until then:  You didn't indicate if you had watched any New Who so if you have a favorite Classic Who Doctor that might be a good starting point. For most of us that will be the first Doctor that we watched (for me its #3 – Pertwee). Or you can start with the best rated episodes/story arcs for each Classic Doctor.  You can put something like “where to start watching Classic Who” or “watch Classic Who” or “best episodes of Classic Who” in the search box for /r/doctorwho and for /r/gallifrey. You’ll find various posts asking about where to find classic episode, what to watch/not watch, and in what order to watch them. You will find much more in-depth discussion of Classic Who on /r/gallifrey and /r/classicwho than on /r/doctorwho.  As already noted, you can go /r/gallifreylive and look at the various discussion threads. Each one has the 4-5 episodes of a story arc for a particular Doctor that can be viewed online.  A listing of which episodes are rated best to watch can also be found in the FAQ section of /r/doctorwho. Check out the Related Reddits/FAQ link under the New Users Must Read header on the right side of the main page (and the similar subreddits link on the /r/gallifrey main page).  There are a lot of episodes on YouTube. BBC Classic Doctor Who on YouTube has playlists for the Classic Doctors. https://www.youtube.com/BBCClassicDoctorWho  ITunes and myretrotv.com have classic episodes available through subscription. Amazon and eBay should have (or used to have) complete seasons/series sets for all of the Doctors on DVD (minus the missing episodes for Doctors #1 and #2). There are a lot of Doctor Who related online sites that can be googled for subscription service or DVD sets purchase. With DVD's check for zone compatibility and ensure they are official recordings not re-recorded products.  Edit: While the BBC Classic Doctor Who link above works it has ""regenerated"" into the BBC Offical Doctor Who YouTube link. It's has Classic and New Who but seems to be have more features about events, podcasts and video clips than full episodes. https://www.youtube.com/DoctorWho"

Their marriage wasn't really a marriage, their relationship was very shortlived, and it's a story about how obsession clouds your judgement from both perspectives - she was brainwashed and thus doomed to obsess, he became obsessed as he tried to play up to her own spoiler-filled existence.  I'd have preferred it if they had her as a fulltime companion and went better into how she, supposedly, knew the Doctor's other faces, but she learned from the best, and Rule Number One always applies. She taught us never to take anything at face value, when all we could see was Amy's fairytale ideal Raggedy-Man.   I'm still not sure if I want to see more of her now that she is confirmed, canonically, as Dead and gone. I wasn't keen on her interacting with Clara from beyond the grave. But I do miss her."

She was too perfect.  I didn't dislike her or anything, I just found her a bit boring.  She just got worse from there.  I tolerated her up until Lets Kill Hitler and that almost killed my interest in finishing the season.  She was rarely written as a person so much as this mary sue plot device.  Really, it's not the character so much as the writing that did it.  I would have loved to see more of the little Melody Pond (How cool would a Doctor lite episode featuring child River have been?) and explore that ""new timelord"" angle.  Instead we got more romance.  I don't think romance ever works with the Doctor.  Not with Rose.  Not with Madame de Pompadour.  Not with Grace.  Not with River.

But honestly I don't think the Doctor has any real concept of just how old he is and I think in reality he is much, much, much older. I think time gets lost when you travel in the TARDIS. Days aren't coherent or consecutive. There's no base point or constant with which to calculate age. So I think he stopped counting a long time ago. I even think 10 was just guessing. I think he gave himself a number and just added years because they felt better than saying he didn't know how old he is."
doctorwho,3dikc5,Jarrrp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:15:54 2015 UTC,"I doubt the concept of ""time"" as a unit of meassure is the same as ours. Time lords probably just life in time rather than count it. Since they travel throught space too, they probably don't need to measure distances at all .   On the other hand if you picture time as a paper and you bend the paper until two points touch then try to measure the distance in time or centimeters etc between both you will see that you just can't tell, because they are happening in the same time and space. Now if you get the lifespan of the doctor and say ok this point is his future and that one his past and bend the paper, you can see how a timelord sees time. Its all happening for them at the same spot.   For example: if he is in London in his 1st regeneration in 1980 and his 12th regeneration is in the same time but not the same space, how old are both of his regenerations at that time since they are happening at the same time? Probably the have the same age at that point, right? so if he is in Gallifrey before he was the Doctor, and he is in Trenzalor as he dies for the last time and both ""points"" of his lifespan are happening at the same time in two different ""points"" of history (lets say one in 1980 and the other at 5000 in our local ""time"") since they are happening at the same time in two different points of ""time"" and ""space"", is he older in Trenzalor or younger?  Wouldn't be easier for time lords to use a different concept of ""time"" or unit of meassure to tell how old they are, like counting the regenerations?   So if it is that complicated, either the Doctor doesn't bother to keep track or he just uses something else to keep track, like a guide or a dairy or history, to know where or when he is to measure his ""age"", rather than how many times a planet has make a turn around a sun.  And as a traveler he is likely to use the locals concept of time or distance/space just to make it easier to communicate rather than having to explain that is ""wobly timey wyme o'clock"" every time that someone asks him which time is it.  Also the TARDIS has a sun in it so, he probably uses the TARDIS as his ""clock"" or point of reference. Maybe?"

Or even where in London you'll be   But I doubt you'll find many Doctor Who t-shirts outside of themed shops as normal clothes shops tend to just sell normal clothes. You'll probably get them at Forbidden Planet, though.  As for the Doctor Who toys, I'm guessing you are referring to the 5"" and 3"" Character Options toys. These are fairly common in most toy shops, as are the Character Options Screwdrivers. Toys'R'Us would have them, for example, and as would some of the big supermarket chains.  I've never seen a 4th Doctor scarf for sale in a shop, so that's probably something you would only find in a specialist shop."

Would it really be so unlikely for a sonic to back itself up to the TARDIS when a lot of time is spent in there? Hell, he's talked about batteries a lot.

doctorwho,3dgvxr,Lurking_Grue,20,Thu Jul 16 22:41:44 2015 UTC,"It's obviously the same answer as most questions... But seriously, I'd go with the explanation of: The War Doc mentions that the calculation is a ""permanent subroutine in the software architecture"" meaning that each next iteration/replacement of the screwdriver can continue to calculate if they are still running the same software. And since the screwdriver is made by the TARDIS, I think that's a safe assumption. And even if the calculations themselves are being performed on the screwdriver, there's nothing to say that the data isn't stored away from the screwdriver (like in a server in the TARDIS). So it would be like continuously editing a word document stored on dropbox. As long as each new computer you have runs Word and Dropbox, you can continue to update the data to completion."

However, Thor (the Supreme Commander of the Asgard Fleet) admitted that the Asgard are simply to advanced to think of something as simple as a weapon which uses chimcals to propel a piece of metal at the target. They needed someone less advanced (humans) to give them the idea in order to have a chance in battle.  In the same way the Doctor is so used to complex scientific problems that he could not imagine that someone would not lock the door."

doctorwho,3dgvxr,ElliottpReddit,5,Thu Jul 16 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"Well hello there.  The sonic screwdriver is an original creation of The Doctor. However it needs ""charging"" from the TARDIS. The screwdriver can be docked into the TARDIS and/or connected wirelessly simply by being inside the TARDIS. This connection is not only to ""charge"" the screwdriver but also facilitates a transfer of data.  How did this happen? Well the doctor may have designed the screwdriver but much like his swimming pool, ball room or apiary anything he desires is manufactured by the TARDIS. The TARDIS as we know is sentient and is interested in The Doctors life and adventures. Unfortunately, he is thoughtless sometimes and wanders too far away from the TARDIS and they lose communication. The TARDIS when creating the Sonic Screwdriver imbued it with some of its own technology. This is how the sonic can regenerate and modify itself so easily. In reality its just very very clever engineering but to those of us who don't understand the science we may think its magic. If it helps you can think of it as a kind of AI that adapts to the personality of its user (that's completely wrong by the way but if it helps...).  The TARDIS uses the sonic as a way to ""record"" the adventures of The Doctor and experience moments of his life ""she"" may otherwise miss. During these data transfers the sonics ""operating system"" is captured as a snapshot (in case of destruction). When a new sonic must be created the last snapshot is used.  The Doctor simply added a calculation hidden in the depths of the sonic's OS that would keep running. The software is backed up. ""Same Software. Different Case""  However he was silly and didnt start the process so it never calculated anything. Luckily the door was unlocked."

doctorwho,3dgvxr,thisiscanonintheEU,3,Thu Jul 16 12:31:19 2015 UTC,"Clara. She was there for the first doctor when he 'borrowed' the TARDIS, I think it's unlikely that the the TARDIS isn't aware of this relationship. Since she was there from the beginning the TARDIS could tell why she was there. From there the TARDIS would know her entire timeline including this moment. (And there was no explanation for that incarnation of Clara to know he should take that specific TARDIS instead of any other one.)  The scenes show them inside the TARDIS making calculation but the TARDIS is devoid of windows so they could have been helping while not knowing the TARDIS was doing what she was doing. The doctor never really passed his drivers test for it.   This gave the TARDIS a way to find itself, I mean it can make backup of rooms that haven't been made yet.  This is the time vortex where the whole of time and space crashes into itself.   OR  It was the 'moment'. I always had a theory that the moment was the choice, it showed the exact future he needed to see. And gave its power to the TARDIS to make this happen throughout its own timeline. Obviously with time altering powers.   I'm not completely sure the moment is a weapon. Maybe it was designed to do what it did, not to blow up a galaxy but to show the user the way to fix the problem, so if it needed to blow something up it would bring the user to a weapons shop and have the user buy a bomb. It's not something that directly causes the action but indirectly leads the user to a solution that wouldn't have occurred to him any other way. In the end the moment stop the three doctors from pressing the button just before they were going to do it, maybe the whole button thing didn't do anything."

doctorwho,3dj3oa,calkinsc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:51:48 2015 UTC,I think I can answer this: the actors don't know a huge amount of future plot detail. Gomez said in an interview during this last week that she was series 8 and 9 spoilers  I think this is standard on a lot of shows as the actors can react better if they don't know much about more about a character's future than the characters do.

(The Time Meddler)  Type 44 - The first to be fitted with with a charger vacuum resonator. (Harvest of Time)  Type 45 - Well, it was the Master's TARDIS, but I can't remember what it did. (The Dark Path)  Type 50 - Was owned by the Doctor before he left Gallifrey. (Prisoners of Fate)  Type 57 - It seemed to be more reliable than the Type 40, if the Fifth Doctor's comment is anything to go by. (*Warriors of the Deep)  Type 70 - Could break through a Temporal Distortion Grid, was voice controlled, and could pause materialisation mid-way through. (Singularity, Assassins of the Limelight and some others but I can't remember)  Type 97 - Had no telepathic connection to the pilot. (World Game)  Type 98 - Had a holographic scanner. (Shadows of Avalon)  Type 102 - First sentient TARDIS, made from Compassion. (Shadows of Avalon)  Type 103 - Humanoid in shape. (Alien Bodies)  Type 105 - Was also humanoid (Alien Bodies)  Battle TARDIS - The exterior was made of living metal that could create any weapon needed, primary weapons were time torpedoes. (Neverland, Engines of War)  Bull TARDIS - Presumably was humanoid as Romana wanted Compassion, a Type 102, to mate with it(him?) to create Type 103s. Also controlled the War TARDISes. (Shadows of Avalon, Taking of Planet 5)  War TARDIS - Could map their interior to their exterior. (Ancestor Cell)  I think these are the right sources, I had a quick check before hand on a couple.   As for what I think, I like to imagine that a TARDIS, say Type 200, was capable of going side-ways in time only, and that then the successor, Type 201, was capable of going anywhere in time, including side-ways."

In that, the Ninth Doctor (voiced by Richard E. Grant AKA Great Intelligence related guy in series 7) traveled with the Master as a sort of companion. When the show restarted this got thrown out but the point is, the idea has been around for ages and it's not surprising they might start using Missy that way a bit considering how great her chemistry is with 12.   Heck, the original plan was to have the Master sacrifice himself to save the Doctor which is why the first Master was stated to be on his last life when he showed up."

doctorwho,3degqg,Mamsies,8,Wed Jul 15 17:11:18 2015 UTC,"Just went back to check ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"" and, you're right, I forgot how amazing the effects were.  On a technical level, Jurassic World's visuals are more advanced than Doctor Who's, but ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"" has a few things going for it that helps sell the visuals:  All the dinosaur scenes are dark and dimly-lit, with only the Pterodactyl scene featuring daylight, but on a dark, cloudy day.  GCI dinosaurs are more convincing at night in both works, but Doctor Who gets more dark scenes.  Doctor Who used practical effects for many of its dinosaur shots, so the effects team's efforts were divided among fewer CGI dinosaur shots.  The behind-the-scenes story on Jurassic World's lighter use of animatronics was not fully disclosed, but the effects team has said director Colin Trevorrow had to fight for the inclusion of animatronics in the movie.  Finally, our expectations are lower for Doctor Who's visuals, making the CGI more impressive for that reason alone.  Also, the same effects team did the CGI for both ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"" and Primeval."
doctorwho,3degqg,JuanPedia,2,Thu Jul 16 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"but the effects team has said director Colin Trevorrow had to fight for the inclusion of animatronics in the movie   You know, this really doesn't seem like something a director should have to fight for.  Isn't their entire job to make choices about how the script will be filmed?  Maybe I'm just ignorant of what a director does, but as long as they're in-budget, who are they fighting with about how the special effects will be done?"
doctorwho,3degqg,Alaira314,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:11:27 2015 UTC,"Really good question.  We don't know exactly what ""[the director] really fought for [animatronics]"" means.  It could've meant he was passionate about it, just wanted the 1 animatronic, or it could indicate a deeper story of a compromise.  We don't know.  Either way, for studio-produced films, the studio has control of the money and how it's spent, and it's not unheard of for studios to do some back-seat-driving with the money.  No idea if that happened with Jurassic World, though."
doctorwho,3degqg,JuanPedia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:50:30 2015 UTC,"Isn't their entire job to make choices about how the script will be filmed?   Actually, not always, and not even in most cases. They get to be in charge of direction, and, many times, that's it. They might usually get a say, but, quite often, it's not up to them. There are so many people in charge of what goes on in a film that the decision about whether something is animatronic or animated could belong anyone from prop master to producer to art director to the production company. Films are extremely complicated works of art, and epic films like Jurassic World are even more so. It's no wonder the director had to fight for something like that.  Besides, animatronics are way more expensive than computer animation. That decision was likely left to the production companies, a.k.a. Amblin Entertainment/Steven Spielberg, Legendary Pictures, and Universal/Comcast."

So Rose and the Doctor go back so they're only 12 days later, thus nobody freaks out.  Since nobody was freaking out 12 months later there was no need for them to go back.  So they didn't go back, so therefore they arrive 12 months late, everyone's freaking out.  So Rose and the Doctor go back so they're only 12 days later, thus nobody freaks out.

The paradox only comes into play if, when they go 12 months in the future, they don't decide to come back.  It would be tricky and dangerous, sure, but since they've already experienced it, they know what they seen so they know what they need to prepare. I'm pretty sure a hidden Rose/Doc, few hundred missing posters and a shocked/lying Jackie/Mickey would do the trick.  ...and if all else fails, time is in flux. Simply telling them, changing the history in the process, what to do to ensure they stick to the course of events can be a good backup.  Of course, this would probably make for some shitty TV when there's another story involved and really isn't RTD's sort of thing. Moffat on the other hand.....And I'm sure they've actually done this at some point in the show but I can't put my finger on it."
doctorwho,3dfr2h,pcjonathan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:01:55 2015 UTC,"Thats not how time paradoxes seems to work in the doctor universe, if you go back in time and alter time, then the future from that time on changes, but you still remember the timeline which you previously experienced, no paradox arises.  But the quesiton is, why should the doctor change that timeline? Is it important?  As a side note:  Fixed points in time are simply just things that are not bound to happen, but that will change the future in an undesirable way (I hypothise that they change the future very drastically not allowing for many important future events to happen at all)."

Doctor Who is a show that has lasted this long partly because there's a built-in plot excuse to replace any major actor who decides to leave, even the one playing the Doctor."
doctorwho,3d8msz,Quazifuji,5,Tue Jul 14 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, Clarkson apparently hit one of the producers for the show, and despite people defending clarkson, the BBC dropped him from the show because he'd had do many warnings before.

doctorwho,3d8msz,pcjonathan,12,Tue Jul 14 22:38:53 2015 UTC,"More like for the sake of personal grudges and petty disputes. Clarkson thought he might have cancer at that time, but couldn't get it checked out till after the incident (cause a biopsy would ruin the filming). What he did was wrong and stupid, but he apologized, he was the one to report the incident, and he was quickly forgiven by the person he hit.   He SHOULD have been suspended, while it was being sorted out, that I agree with, but after they found out the details, and there were no more hard feelings between the parties involved it should have been settled with another public apology.   Though Clarkson did piss off quite a bit of higher ups, plenty of times. That's why he got fired, because they got an excuse. It wasn't done for the benefit of the company, it wasn't done for a moral standpoint. It was done because Clarkson is a dick, and he pissed off people who fired him when they found a reason."
doctorwho,3d8msz,Dog-Person,17,Tue Jul 14 17:29:58 2015 UTC,He SHOULD have been suspended   And what do you do to an employee who has been suspended multiple times already and on their final warning? Suspend them again?
doctorwho,3d8msz,pcjonathan,5,Tue Jul 14 17:51:03 2015 UTC,"Assess his value. See if his actions and behaviour outweigh the benefit the employee brings to the company. If the benefit the employee brings to the company   A. Outweigh the harm, and B. Cannot be easily replaced by someone who would bring a similar value  You keep him. You reevaluate him at every incident until his value is at an economic negative."
doctorwho,3d8msz,Dog-Person,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:47:14 2015 UTC,"And so you've just lost the respect of at least some of your employees for saying but not doing. Anyone can tell you an organisation that doesn't respect their boss is going to suffer. He helped give a lot to the BBC but that doesn't put him above the rules and regulations set out.   Besides, they already have replaced Clarkson. The show can go on without any of the original hosts or producers. We're Doctor Who fans. We're entirely used to this. It's all down to how the audience, most of whom are stuck in their mindset, will react. As to how many of them will give it a go. As well as the strategy the BBC will go for."
doctorwho,3d8msz,pcjonathan,0,Tue Jul 14 19:08:01 2015 UTC,"That loss of respect is part of the equation. I'd argue someone valuable enough can be above the rules (within reason). As much as I hate them, this is how unions get stuff done too, they strike (something that if a lone employee did he'd get fried for), but since they have value (numbers) they are put above the normal rules and are not all instantly fired.  Honestly I don't see the next show working out for them, they probably lost over 100 million pounds annually for firing him. Though I can see where they came from. It was the wrong decision from a business point of view. Probably the ""fair"" decision though.   The only big difference between this and doctor who is that they're changing both the cast and format. Which is akin to changing everything but the name.   It'll be like if they brought doctor who back with a completely new story, all the history is now gone. It'll be if Doctor Who now focused on a new timelord never been seen or mentioned, and it's now a sitcom, or a full on romance.    At that point it may as well be a new show, they're only using the name to get viewers."
doctorwho,3d8msz,Dog-Person,2,Tue Jul 14 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"Your argument for it being a whole different show with the same name is a little ironic considering the Top Gear as we know it, with Clarkson/Hammond/May/Wilman is, in itself, a revival and a massive change from the original Top Gear run of 24 years.  But I wouldn't say they're changing the format just yet. I'm not keeping up to date with it so correct me if I'm wrong but AFAIK, they've not said a single thing yet on what the format will be."
doctorwho,3d8msz,Dashrider,0,Tue Jul 14 20:18:10 2015 UTC,"Well Clarkson was involved in the original, but yeah. Though to be fair most of the fan base is completely different from the original show.  It's been confirmed the format will change, they just haven't announced how much. It's also been announced that there'll be a female co-host. Which I had mixed feelings about. To me it'll be like changing the doctors gender or making him gay. I don't have anything against women or gay people, I just don't see it working great in the show. I'm now completely over it as it's official that Hammond and May are gone too.

A theory is that TG have never been trendy or had a vocal fanbase. It was a show of the common, everyday man and some peoples guilty pleasure. Doctor Who, Sherlock, Downtown Abbey and everything that Netflix put out for that matter get a lot of exposure from their ""young and hip"" fantasy whereas the Top Gear is greatly less organised."

I doubt it, myself.  Haters gonna hate.     People have been commenting on the ""cinematic"" (i.e., expensive and highly polished) look of the S9 trailer, and by extension (we hope) S9 itself.  Management at BBC must have had, you know, an inkling of how successful S8 was, to have freed up the $ to produce this newly polished look, plus shooting in some far-flung locations, for S9.   Whup -- there it is!  Thank you, OnSpeakerCrab, (no longer -- OnSpeakerCrab's post, below, was deleted; as I recall, it was a typical hater whine about how the show must have such a high rating because of a push by its large number of ""rabid fans"").  I replied that the core fandom has been of moderate size and UK based, and it's the winning of lots of new young fans in new countries that's helped push the show into the top spot, not the old core; and that the only ""rabid fans"" I've sen around here are the haters, who can't stop sniping and complaining about the show that they purport to ""love"".

(I love Matt's Doctor, I don't mean to say he's less 'serious' or 'for children', but his stories and personality were exploring the fairy tale side of the Doctor which made it innately more friendly to children than Capaldi who is being more focussed on the dark and gritty sci-fi alien aspects.)"

If you like intelligent-looking men more than excited-looking boys, Capaldi is just the ""heart-throb"" that he said he doesn't expect to be.  Expect the unexpected, old man . . ."

doctorwho,3d8msz,elevendayempire,4,Wed Jul 15 05:04:31 2015 UTC,"The obvious question is why are so few episodes being made. The average US tv show is 22 episodes a season, yearly. We get 8. And don't give me that quality crap, with the supposed talent writing for the show there should be no problem with producing enough decent scripts for at least 1 UK season a year [13 episodes]  More episodes would mean being able to sell it for more money, which would help the Beeb out in it's cash-strapped status, so the question remains, why so few episodes?"
doctorwho,3d8msz,PSBlake,19,Wed Jul 15 02:02:42 2015 UTC,"It's logistics as much as anything else. US shows have a larger ensemble cast, meaning that filming can be spread out among the actors over the course of a longer season.   The Doctor and his companion have to be in (pretty much) every scene of every episode – indeed, the workload's so heavy that the production team has double-banked ""Doctor-lite"" and ""companion-lite"" episodes to enable them to complete filming on schedule."
doctorwho,3d8msz,Karma9999,9,Tue Jul 14 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"Also, Doctor Who takes place in a different location every week! That makes it much more difficult to film than a crime procedural for example."

doctorwho,3d8msz,Karma9999,4,Tue Jul 14 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"The other big issue is that British actors, writers & showrunners are less keen on being tied down to one TV show a year. They often have a decent chunk of the year set aside to act on stage, or write a different TV show or whatever. It's just part of the culture I think."

doctorwho,3d8msz,Dashrider,8,Wed Jul 15 05:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my bad, I was thinking back to season 7 which was 13 episodes over 2 years.   There are still plenty of US shows that have over 20 episodes yearly, Agents of Shield, Person of Interest, Elementary to name a few I watch."
doctorwho,3d8msz,OpticalData,8,Tue Jul 14 14:22:59 2015 UTC,Those are also much easier to film a lot of episodes in a short time because so many of the same sets get used over and over. The only one that gets consistently reused in Doctor Who is the TARDIS.

Also, even if people dislike certain episodes, story arcs, showrunners and whatnot, they still keep watching just because Doctor Who is on again and they've been waiting for it for so long.

Expensive and fancy: Prop replicas. Made by various workshops or individuals so you have to purchase them on their schedule, and they usually  run in the hundreds of dollars.

Additionally, as mentioned in another comment, a popular theory is that he has those adventures between when Rose turns down traveling in space with him and when he pops back a second later to say its also a time machine, causing her to say yes."
doctorwho,3dbmzq,2561FIRST,3,Wed Jul 15 04:48:44 2015 UTC,I agree with you that is most likely the reason.  Just like how the Doctor with the first episode with Martha he travels back in time to proof to her he's a time traveler.

doctorwho,3dbmzq,2561FIRST,2,Wed Jul 15 03:46:59 2015 UTC,"That's after Amy and Rory stop living on the TARDIS though, so it makes sense for him to travel without them.  As far as we know, Rose was constantly on the TARDIS with them."

doctorwho,3dbmzq,stop___grammar_time,3,Wed Jul 15 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"Well, the original idea was that we're supposed to have no idea where in 9's life we are. The idea was to give the impression that the Doctor always was and is. But as the timeline has come together, it's clear that after regenerating, 9 goes on a sort of post-regeneration mania, similar to 3, 6, 8, 11 and 12 where they have almost a burst of energy about them in their post regeneration state(as opposed to sleeping) and an unpredictableness to their actions. As such, 9 has had some adventures, but its almost as if he landed, did stuff then ran away without rest or sleep. That's why when he finally takes the time to look in the mirror in Rose, he's amazed. I like to imagine that Nine's prerose life was a man running away from himself, every second focusing on the next adventure so thoroughly that he hasn't taken the time to look in the mirror for fear of seeing the war doctor. I like to imagine he went on for years. It'd be a beautiful saddness that way."
doctorwho,3dbmzq,rob__v,2,Wed Jul 15 01:02:21 2015 UTC,"100 years since War is 400 years younger than 11 (Roughly 1200 at the time, with 9 being 900 in 'Rose'"". There is a belief that 9 is freshly regenerated in 'Rose' due to him checking out his ""new"" face in the mirror, but RTD himself disproved this theory in Doctor Who Magazine."
doctorwho,3dbmzq,SpocksBrainLLAP,2,Wed Jul 15 01:46:30 2015 UTC,"How much time had passed between when the War Doctor regenerated and 'Rose'?    Strictly from numbers given in the show: About a century, give or take (In Day of the Doctor the War Doctor gives his age as around 800, in Rose the 9th Doctor says he's 900 years old)."

doctorwho,3dce20,Narconis,6,Wed Jul 15 04:18:03 2015 UTC,"In the Classic Series in the credits the character was ""Dr. Who"" and ""Doctor Who"" until the 5th doctor where it was changed to ""The Doctor"". This happened again with the 9th Doctor being credited as ""Doctor Who"" until they changed it back to The Doctor. Plus he is the titular character anyway.  So both are acceptable and any fan that gets upset over it needs to think about what they are doing with their life. Capaldi is a life time fan and back then the character was called Doctor Who."

doctorwho,3dce20,timms5000,4,Wed Jul 15 09:26:38 2015 UTC,"The creators of the show referred to him as ""Dr. Who"". For clarity that is the name of the character outside the universe of the show because saying ""the Doctor"" in the rest of life can be confusing whereas ""Doctor Who"" immediately makes it clear you are talking about this character. Anyone who complains about it is not only being a pedant but they are showing their own ignorance  because, as mentioned almost half of the actors to play the character have been credited as ""Dr. Who"" or ""Doctor Who"" at the end of episodes. The ones Peter watched as a kid were all been credited this way.  It's a weird quirk of the show but there you have it."
doctorwho,3dce20,timms5000,2,Wed Jul 15 09:21:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you :). I honestly didn't think I'd like show but was surprised when I finally checked it out. I've still never seen an episode prior to Eccleston, but that's a bit more commitment than I can muster"
doctorwho,3dce20,Kittridge,2,Wed Jul 15 09:28:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, the pacing is a lot slower in the older stuff. If you watch one classic story before the show comes back checkout Genesis of the Daleks it's a pretty big part of the lore for the show, a good 4th Doctor episode and, if the rumors are true, it might be closely related to some of the plot in series 9.   There's a few good episodes on Netflix but the collection there is super random."

I've played it with some people who didn't read too much into Doctor Who, and even simple questions like ""Is your character 'good'?"" leaves so much to interpretation. One of the core principles of the show is that good and evil are not so diametrically opposed, and that the Doctor(s) cannot be considered one or the other; it's not black and white.  How about ""Is it a Time Lord?"" Well, is The Tardis (as represented in personified form) a Time Lord? It is Time Lord technology, no? How about River Song?

They were both released on disc individually and in a special boxset http://www.amazon.co.uk/Doctor-Who-Anniversary-Collectors-Blu-ray/dp/B00M40FCY8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1436898144&sr=8-3&keywords=doctor+who+50th+anniversary which is currently out of print. I'd wager they will release a non limited edition in the future.   Hope that answers your question.

I was wondering if I needed to buy the stand alone Last Christmas, I'm glad I don't, though I wish it was on the season 8 box set.   Still wish they'd put TDOTD and TTOTD on the season 8 set, nice to be complete, I do own the stand alones though so I'm ok.   Thanks again Migeman."
doctorwho,3d9w0f,JuanPedia,2,Tue Jul 14 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"It's because the box sets are released before the Christmas season, so ""The Time of the Doctor"" couldn't be included in the Series 7 box set.  It was released as a single and part of the ""Name/Night/Day/Time of the Doctor"" box set.  ""Last Christmas"" is out as a single, but maybe it will be on the Series 9 box set."
doctorwho,3d9w0f,LegoK9,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:36:42 2015 UTC,I think the TDOTD and TDOTD should have been on the season 8 box set then. Thanks for the info.

doctorwho,3d8bcy,YYGC,2,Tue Jul 14 08:06:07 2015 UTC,"Well, you said it yourself, that's not really how time works. Probably. There is no one point where time only splits into two lines, it would be a huge web of infinite divergent universes branching off everywhere.  But for A) You could time lock the past, so that everything involving the Doctor prior to the fracture. Or tine lock the fork itself so that no tine travelling can enter it and meddle with the events, and therefore the person is always destined to take the path of time that they are meant to.  B) The people on one side of the fork would be locked into their one time line unless they either went sideways in time or back to the fork and into the other dimension. Again, some sort of time lock around the event that created the fork would ensure that events always played as they were meant to for the people who arrive there.  C) Doing any action at all would create a divergent universe. But if you wanted to make a major difference then killing any major world leader at critical times most likely result in a different enough universe. That is, if you are looking for one event as a point of divergence.  Pete's World, for instance, is a parallel universe rather than a divergent one. There is no single point in which history changed, history has played out differently the entire time.  I hope these ideas helped and I hope that you don't take them and say you came up with then."

doctorwho,3d2cx8,suzych,5,Mon Jul 13 11:58:17 2015 UTC,"Being put in situations designed to have the cast talk to the fans about the show, but having them primed with only a few actual things that they're allowed to say about S9, must be awkward for them -- even if Steven M. weren't on stage with them all the time to make sure they don't say anything more.  The actors end up sounding a bit like trained parrots, repeatedly saying the same things in the same words (which, to their credit, they managed to do without steam coming out of their ears -- their patience and calmness under these circumstances was remarkable, IMO).  Of course we all understand the necessity for a sort of playbook + gag order (you can say this and this and this about S9, but THAT'S ALL). If there were a major revelation on a panel, some fans would swamp the net with anger that ""Moffat deliberately afflicted us with spoilers!  S9 is ruined!  I'll never watch DW again!""  It amazes me that Moffat-haters constantly blame him for lying, teasing, ""playing games"" with the fans' expectations, etc.  I look at it this way: ""spoiling"" the next season means spoiling the delight most viewers get from being surprised by the show. But DW fans are mostly (by all appearances) brighter than the general run of TV watchers, the way people who read SF tend to be sharper (if nerdier) than the average.  So some of us take it as a personal challenge to figure stuff out before anyone else does.  Steven M., in turn, has to take extra precautions to fend off fan inquisitiveness -- to protect the pleasure that the greater portion of fans look forward to in being surprised by the show (for which effort he gets constant stick).  It's hardly a pleasant position to be in -- and if he can turn it into a game, with some rewards in it for himself, I don't see why he gets blamed (in certain quarters) for it.  As for Capaldi or Coleman or Gomez, playing along is part of the publicity aspect of their work on the show, and I admire them for being able to keep it fresh, funny, and interesting despite the limited ""script"" they were confined to with regard to the Secrets of S9.  It was brilliant to have the season trailer on hand to give the fans something to dissect among themselves."

doctorwho,3d2cx8,cowbellhero81,6,Mon Jul 13 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"Well, a ""mid-season regeneration"" is not happening, because we saw Capaldi film the finale already.   ""Last season"" in general is not happening because of all the reasons in the world. Have you seen the Comic-Con footage? That man is going nowhere for at least two more years.   The thing is, people really seem to have problems determining what a ""large amount of dislike"" is. Colin Baker's Doctor, for example. McCoy was extremely unpopular with the general audience as well. Capaldi on the other hand has received almost the exact same mixture of good and bad feelings during his first year as any other Doctor. Yeah, he was a bit scruffy at the beginning, but that was a very intentional development to make the audience feel less at ease. The mere fact that the team were allowed the casting of the second-oldest Doctor ever and making him into such an unreliable and untransparent character says a lot what they can get away with and that Capaldi will absolutely not leave the role anytime soon."
doctorwho,3d692d,Willowwinds,5,Mon Jul 13 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"The coat that the Doctor wears in series 8 is a custom made Crombie-style coat made from dark navy blue wool from Harrisons. Unfortunately, I've long forgotten what the product code for the fabric is but if you route around for a while you should ne able to find it, unless it is out if stock (I'd do it myself but I'm on mobile).  I don't think it's ridiculously expensive as far as fabrics go, but it may still too expensive for the average cosplayer. Really, any dark blue wool will probably work, however.  The alternative is to buy a replica, or one in a similar style from Crombie themselves. But you're probably looking at £700ish for one from Crombie and £100ish for a replica on eBay.  The lining of the coat is not solid red but rather a red and black pattern that from a distance can look solid red. It's made from silk by an Italian company that has long since stopped making it, the production team probably bought one of the last bolts available. But you would be looking for something like this. To be honest, I have no idea where you'd find something like this, so maybe solid red silk would be both easier and cheaper to find.  The trousers I think were G-Star RAW, the same as those worn by the Eleventh Doctor. I'm actually not sure if I am right here, but I'm fairly sure that's were they come from.   The white shirt is by Bud, the purple by Paul Smith, the cardigan by Smeedly (I think it's called) and I still haven't found the holey jumper from The Caretaker yet, nor of anything official about the waistcoat in Dark Water.  The boots he wears are not Doc Martens. But they are accurate enough however and Doc Martens are cool and you should be them.   If you are wanting to save money, then there are a couple things you could do. You could cosplay as the 12th Doctor in The Caretaker as a warehouse coat is a lot less expensive to buy.  Or Minor costume spoilers for series 9  Be sure to check out this blog, since this guy seems to be the most knowledge fan concerning costumes. I haven't checked it in a while, though, so I don't know if he's updated it recently.  Hope this helps."
doctorwho,3d692d,Mobius6432,2,Mon Jul 13 23:26:35 2015 UTC,"Thank for the great information! This has already helped a ton. I don't want to spend any more then about $250 (US) on this outfit. The only thing that has me a bit worried is the fabric. The wool might be pricy, and there's no way I can afford silk, so I might have to get a blend.   The first thing I needed to find was some kind of pattern to go off of. Obviously I won't find the exact coat pattern from the show, but I think I came across one that is pretty darn close.  The next task is to find the buttons. They are made of horn, which is typical of higher-end men's suits and coats. These are a little pricy, and are going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 for a full set (vest, coat, arms). After a couple hours of searching, the closest I could find to the actual buttons used are here. I ordered 10 small, 5 medium, and three large buttons. They should do the trick!  I'll let you all know more soon."
doctorwho,3d692d,OpticalData,2,Tue Jul 14 02:53:39 2015 UTC,Just to correct a few things the inner lining is a navy/red pattern if you're going to go for complete accuracy.   The trousers were Paul Smith I believe as were most of the shirts and the holey jumper.   The hoodie is an All Saints   The boots are Loakes.   The Waistcoat was a custom.

In my mind, they are only vulnerable when moving around unobserved, but no person in their right mind is going to stick around and experiment in that situation.  I think it's also likely that their composition only looks like stone, as an evolutionary adaption, and that whilst they might be silicon-based, they are even tougher than they look."

doctorwho,3d3e5f,positive_electron42,4,Mon Jul 13 12:00:01 2015 UTC,"I got from the second Angel episode that they naturally decay due to starvation. Barring that, just because no one's looking doesn't mean there isn't an automatic hammer or whatnot swinging towards them when the lights are off.  Of course, to understand when they're vulnerable or invulnerable, one must first better define 'looking' at them, which I imagine is a much more abstract concept than just whether or not they're emitting photons in the human visible spectrum which are also being picked up by the eyes of humans. And if you're aware of them but not watching them, does it count as being seen? What about on security camera? Can other species perceive them, and if so, what about those that don't see in the human spectrum? What about bugs? Amoebas? Do they have to be sentient? Can something that 'sees' with echolocation 'see' them? If you touch them and are therefor aware of them, will they be stone?

You've hit on the fact that the whole ""quantum lock"" mechanic of the monster is more of a play on the word ""observation"" than anything to do with actual QM. From the quantum mechanics standpoint, every single interaction they have with even the air itself counts as an observation and it has nothing to do with sentience at all. That's one of the reasons it's really difficult to have stranger QM effects show up in the macroscopic world; as you have more and more things interacting the angel never gets to be ""unobserved."""
doctorwho,3d3e5f,timms5000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:32:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but on that level, it isn't even possible for two things, no matter what they are or what separates them (including empty space and vast distances), to both exist in a defined universe without affecting each other and thus being observable to each other in some way. So it must be tied to perception of the angel by a sentient being."
doctorwho,3d3e5f,Farren246,2,Wed Jul 15 11:14:40 2015 UTC,"Oh in the show it is, it's just interesting to see someone organically stumble on the issues with the science like that."
doctorwho,3d3e5f,timms5000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:06:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, it wasn't organic... it's just how my brain works with fucking everything I encounter. Let us define 'encounter'..."

doctorwho,3d3e5f,timms5000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:14:11 2015 UTC,Actually I'm 30...
doctorwho,3d3e5f,Farren246,2,Wed Jul 15 19:30:37 2015 UTC,oh Well then congratulations on maintaining such a... uh... youthful personality.
doctorwho,3d3e5f,timms5000,3,Wed Jul 15 19:56:20 2015 UTC,Where's Ace with her nitro-9 when you need it?
doctorwho,3d3e5f,Andronius3,4,Mon Jul 13 19:07:15 2015 UTC,"If you were to experiment with trying to break the angel, you would have the consider the composition of the hammer.  If the hammer is metal you may want to consider the season 7 angels.  In season 7 the angels had the ability to send anyone they touch back in time.  They did this to feed off your time energy.  Energy can be transferred through various ways but a relating one is conduction through metal.  So attempting this with a metal hammer would mostly result in, but not constrained to, going back in time or being overwhelmed by time energy."
doctorwho,3d3e5f,2561FIRST,7,Mon Jul 13 09:53:39 2015 UTC,But with them being quantum locked they would not be able to interact with anything while being hit.  As long as you don't blink while you're hitting them.
doctorwho,3d3e5f,tunaktu86,3,Mon Jul 13 12:33:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but have you ever tried to hammer something and keep your eyes open with the blow? I can't, similar to keeping your eyes open when you sneeze. [edit] if I were ever faced with an actual weeping angel and had a hammer I would totally go out swinging!"
doctorwho,3d3e5f,Andronius3,3,Mon Jul 13 16:55:31 2015 UTC,"You're conflating energy with electricity, which can be conducted through metal.   The only energy ever mentioned in reference to the angels is ""time energy"", whatever that is."

doctorwho,3d3e5f,KITTvsKARR,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"Ah, but then you wouldn't be able to see it and you'd be a in real trouble ;)"
doctorwho,3d3e5f,wallaby_al,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:45:35 2015 UTC,I wonder if they can take advantage of tunneling effects... That'd be a really cool way for them to add to the quantum mechanics oriented lore around the monster. Give it the ability to spontaneously pass through impassable barriers like an electron.
doctorwho,3d3e5f,timms5000,3,Wed Jul 15 10:36:14 2015 UTC,The impact would make you blink  Dont blink.....
doctorwho,3d3e5f,Yourponydied,3,Mon Jul 13 12:20:53 2015 UTC,Get someone else to watch at the same time.   Or several of them
doctorwho,3d3e5f,JancariusSeiryujinn,2,Mon Jul 13 16:45:49 2015 UTC,There are lots of well thought out answerson this thread.   I like this the best.     You're not gonna do anything with just one swing.   But you will blink.   And they just need one blink.
doctorwho,3d3e5f,DarkPoppies,2,Mon Jul 13 14:01:58 2015 UTC,"Because they're incredibly resilient. Grayle tortured one and there were only some surface scratches.  There's also the fact that they will restore their image by absorbing any background radiation, plus are you able to hit something with a sledgehammer without flinching or looking away?"
doctorwho,3d3e5f,ProtoKun7,3,Mon Jul 13 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"You know me and my boyfriend were discussing a similar idea. Armor piercing amo should be able to break them, but the only dying ones I saw were the ones in the library of death. With Amelia, the Doctor and river. So honestly I don't think it was ever explained unless I missed something. Could also have something to do with touching them sends you away"
doctorwho,3d3e5f,Frankiesweetcheeks,3,Mon Jul 13 05:16:40 2015 UTC,Oh gosh....can you imagine if that power still applied to the miniscule chunks of angel pounded off with a sledgehammer?
doctorwho,3d3e5f,katiedid05,9,Mon Jul 13 05:25:13 2015 UTC,"I love this idea, the Weeping Angels work like starfishes.  You break them, and they multiply.  I mean.... why not?  Beaches full of sand comprised of mini 'Wee'ping Angels."
doctorwho,3d3e5f,BadWolf42_,6,Mon Jul 13 06:26:53 2015 UTC,mini 'Wee'ping Angels.    I think that may be the most adorable terrifying thing ever.

doctorwho,3d3e5f,katiedid05,7,Mon Jul 13 06:33:44 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Moffat wrote about this in a tweet once.  EDIT: Found it
doctorwho,3d3e5f,onetruepurple,3,Mon Jul 13 12:06:05 2015 UTC,"That tweet explains it then, you break the angel, you breath in the dust and then become the angel, like looking at it through a screen."
doctorwho,3d3e5f,BadWoolf_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:54:10 2015 UTC,That which contains the image if an angel becomes itself am angel...  The angel came thru the screen. Amy's problem was that there was a speck of dust in her eye. Imagine breathing in many specks...
doctorwho,3d3e5f,hashiro86,2,Mon Jul 13 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"Could also have something to do with touching them sends you away   That's probably the most relevant fact, TBH."
doctorwho,3d3e5f,Castun,3,Mon Jul 13 05:35:34 2015 UTC,Except that isn't always true.  iirc the cleric on the ship was touched and he didn't go away. Heck Amy had one in her eyes and she didn't go away then.
doctorwho,3d3e5f,DeathByFarts,2,Mon Jul 13 09:30:20 2015 UTC,"Its explained in the episode that those angels are not at full strength so they don't have the power to send people back in time. Though not specifically stated, the same can probably be said for the angel that grabbed Clara during The Time of the Doctor. It was likely weakened by being buried in the snow."
doctorwho,3d3e5f,-Mitthrawnuruodo-,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:05:46 2015 UTC,"Well, they'd gained more power by then, but they were feeding on the Byzantium's radiation; they didn't need to displace people."
doctorwho,3d3e5f,ProtoKun7,3,Mon Jul 13 15:16:34 2015 UTC,"The Doctor explains they are ""Quantum-Locked"" and whilst he doesn't go into full details, it's at the least implied that this makes them literally invincible whilst they're being observed. They are Not made of stone, and no-one really knows how fleshy they are. They can't just be smashed with a sledgehammer in the same way that you can't just smash an Angel-sized Diamond with a sledgehammer."
doctorwho,3d3e5f,GildasMagnus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:43:04 2015 UTC,"Swing the sledge and close your eyes before impact. Could unlock them, but they also are extremely fast. Just sounds like it would be cool to see"
doctorwho,3d3e5f,TheFishb0y,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:16:09 2015 UTC,Why can't you destroy a TRADIS with a sledgehammer...  Not everything is as it appears...
doctorwho,3d3e5f,johnturkey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"I sort of hoped after the Angel took Amy, the Doctor would flip out, point his screwdriver at the angel, and sonic it into rubble."
doctorwho,3d3e5f,Cern_Stormrunner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:37:25 2015 UTC,Because Peter Gabriel isn't as powerful as most would believe.
doctorwho,3d3e5f,timelordvictorious,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:15:24 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that the pieces of the angel would rebuild itself, so the angel can't be destroyed because the leftovers always rebuild another angel. Another feeling is that the pieces will also have the abilities of an angel, so instead of trying to keep a statue in your vision without blinking, you have to keep dozens of pieces of stone in your vision without blinking."
