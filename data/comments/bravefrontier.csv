bravefrontier,3e35oq,NA_Edxu,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:01 2015 UTC,New unit. The amount of salt from Diemos being Ultor's evo mat with rust the Heavens.
bravefrontier,3e35oq,akaieevee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're legally allowed to do that, due to the ""compu gacha"" law in Japan.

That said, I still have claimed but unused the Rinon and Yura UBB compensation summon ticket, and my brother has 2 summon tickets to spare. As soon as he arrives I will try luck with my summon ticket and he will try luck with both. Whatever happens will be fine, as God Rare Summon will probably come with 3 gem per summon seeing the new batch in JP also comes with 3 gem per summon, and it would be less wort the summon tickets there.

bravefrontier,3e2vps,jh2481,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:16 2015 UTC,their LS average out around the same damage. zenia is way better damage wise and buff wise for SBB. Her BB is trash though... making her kinda shit for arena.   She's the best spark/bb buffer in all versions of the game as a nonleader.
bravefrontier,3e2vps,chickdigger802,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:11 2015 UTC,"Her bb is trash for the arena, but it is godly in trials and other single target fights."
bravefrontier,3e2vps,IshadTX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"She has 78 drop checks base. With a bit of work you can put together a squad that'll get her to SBB consistently.  Her BB manages to be weaker than her SBB against a single target, so you might want to save for her SBB to get the buffs up consistently during such a fight anyway. BB is more of a convenience thing for emergency filling your mitigators most of the time, unless you can't kill a specific target/have to kill one target first (e.g. Balmedia's tail, Zurg in the Afla Dilith trial)."
bravefrontier,3e2vps,Xerte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:32 2015 UTC,78 drop checks? so that means she has the highest normal drop checks?
bravefrontier,3e2vps,RubyDraco,0,Tue Jul 21 16:28:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 39 drop checks and x2 for her ES. She doesn't benefit quite as much from spheres as those few units with more than 40 base, but I don't think it's feasible for them to overtake her DC total in a general scenario, considering equal spheres."

Zenia's gonna be an insta imp max once I get a few miracle totems. In terms of pulls, I pulled shit. One unit worthy of note was Tridon (A). Got a Guardian one so I'm gonna wait and see if he's worth going the whole 9 yards with or not.  Overall, rate up is pretty much a lie. Terrible as per usual but it could have been worse... which is a terrible thing unto itself..."

bravefrontier,3e2vps,PrismoBF,3,Tue Jul 21 16:07:17 2015 UTC,So I assume this is a shit rate up and 10 plus are needed unless ur really lucky
bravefrontier,3e2vps,lllNerif,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"Kind of. The data collected for 7 star rate ups so far has been around 4-5% percent for each unit....so the success rate for a rate up on just two new 7 star units would only be around 8-10%, which appears to be what we are seeing. The same rate up applied to the recent popular units rate up, but since there were 6 units in each rate up, it figured out to be 24-30% chance of getting one of those 6 units. While that appears to be better odds, it only works in your favor if you want most or all of those 6 units. Otherwise, your chances of getting the one or two units you want are exactly the same as today, except that the 10 summons deal guarantees you get one of these units. Long story short, if you want one or both of these units, now is probably your best chance. Otherwise you have to wait for a popular unit rate up and hope that its not the only unit in the group you are after."

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Deathmax,54,Tue Jul 21 07:03:41 2015 UTC,"Time for a quick review! If these guys don't get the nerfhammer, then we're looking at what Gumi think JPBF will have in a couple weeks...    Deimos Thunderborn   Quite frankly, this guy has everything I'd want to give Ultor and more. LS may be a meta option for a lot of content - people already run Griel because she provides 30% HP alongside a low 10% BC drop rate and status immunity. Deimos has 40% HP and an average 4 BC fill when attacked.   Not to mention, on a taunt unit - his own LS means he'll be hit by every attack ever to keep his buff up. This kind of strategy means his LS' BC gen won't help other units much, though - you'll need to support it with a spark BC gen, BC regen or BC drop rate LS/buffs  ES takes Deimos up to 11. Elemental immunity as well? 40% more HP and DEF? He's looking at 15880 HP as anima with imps and his LS/ES alone... and gives no fucks when it comes to earth dungeons. It needs a specific sphere, but it's expected that their spheres will be Raid X2 rewards... hopefully there's not another Draegar.   Frankly, the sphere doesn't even need to be that good. He'll have awesome stat bonuses from his ES with it equipped. Sphere not required for elemental weakness damage immunity, only stats.  Arena-wise, he's a beast. Ultor's biggest weakness was lack of AoE and fairly low drop checks; Deimos has AoE and 36 drop checks. He'll always have massive HP with his ES, ignores silly little Quaids and their earth damage, and has an arguably viable LS along the same lines as people running Griel. Good stuff. BB is an AoE attack with taunt. To help people soak that in, Ultor's BB was only single target and bad for BC gen. Additionally, Deimos' Taunt buff gives him 40% more DEF than 6* Ultor's, though that may be what Ultor gets as well.   I'll mention here that Taunt has incredible synergy with DEF -> ATK buffs. This guy doesn't have any buff timing issues. It works.  SBB adds an AoE 100% all-stats buff, for just one turn. However, Gumi got the buff timing right, so it'll be included with his damage, and... that 100% DEF stacks with his taunt DEF bonus. He'll have +390% DEF. More if his sphere gives DEF. As a one-turn stat buff, you have to use him first within the turn if you want to use the ATK buff for other units, which is a small weakness.   That totals 16929 DEF as an imped Anima/Lord. 5643 damage reduction, when this guy is going to be absorbing all single target attacks - we're yet to encounter an enemy that deals that much damage with non-skill attacks. Normally having a non-top-tier DEF buff would make people dislike him, but I think the fact that he absorbs all normal attacks means it'll be forgiven in Deimos' case. The other units may have 40% less DEF than normal, but they'll be taking 50% less hits. Or more. You can buff him further with a dedicated DEF buffer after his SBB activates. If he can't maintain SBB you're going to need to have one to cover the turn after, anyways.  UBB is ok, I guess. He can't taunt on the turn you use it or the turn before that (right now), and 50% mitigation/200% DEF doesn't really compare to 75% mitigation seen on other units for trial purposes. Insta-filling the rest of your unts is nice - means his UBB will always have a fulll background of SBB to spark against. Oh, and we don't have the UBB stacking change yet, but when we do...    When it does stack, it will be something to write home about. He'll be sitting at 690% total DEF while taunting for 2 turns after it, with up to 75% mitigation to boot, and he'll be providing 300% DEF to your other units... against HP%/Fixed Damage Nukes I'd prefer something like Elimo, but you can't declare this guy bad once UBB stacking hits global.  His BB/SBB drop checks are a little low, but I think it's a fair trade-off. His LS will still give him enough BC with the taunt mechanic, anyways.   Overall I have no complaints with Deimos other than the possibility he's overpowered, but if Gumi's balance target was an unknown JPBF batch release coming in the near future and they want us to still think he's viable in the future, then it could be ok. His strength is specifically from his combination of all factors, so if he gets nerfed, it'd have to be balanced over everything.     Obsidian Seraph Zenia   The new overpowered waifu of our day? Her stats have a very strong lean towards ATK - I think she's going to be the highest damaging spark buffer to date (bar Loch's SBB/UBB, whose buffs don't match up). Her HP's a little low for a 7* unit as the counterbalance, with slightly below average HP imps as well, but she gets a 20% ES - hopefully the sphere it needs has HP as well. Her LS gives a lot of bonus damage, and BC gen when sparking. Half of it's useful in arena (80% ATK is good for turn 1 though not the best, 230% total damage added to BB is great for turn 2) and the spark BC gen, as we all know by now, is very strong in general. Not sure I'd use it over Roa for difficult content, though... maybe with Deimos giving 40% HP we don't need more.   Overall, it's strong, but not perfect. I don't mind that, but it's not an option everywhere. You can use her anywhere you'd consider using Raaga. As we've seen, not having %HP isn't always a dealbreaker.  Her ES is pretty nice. +1 hit per hit on normals with that kind of ATK means she's going to tear through things in the arena. 20% all stats is always nice, though we don't know much about the sphere it needs.   Same stuff I mentioned about Deimos' sphere applies. She doesn't need it for the increased hit count, so until we know what the sphere is, I can't say if it'll be a good one to use.  Arena-wise, she's strong in most ways, but her single target BB is a glaring fault. She's got type 3 AI, ridiculous damage on normals thanks to hit count ES and 3.3k ATK when imped as non-breaker (if she uses Sky Harbinger, she'll hit for 21400~ish unresisted dark damage on turn 1, and should be able to one-shot almost anything - without even including an ATK leader...), and 39 normal attack drop checks, plus her LS if you want to use it. Her HP can be a little low, but with that kind of damage output, it might not matter. Her BB is single target, which is hard to use for arena, but it'll do a decent amount of damage. Her SBB has a higher admage mod, though. The BB gives 9 BC fill instantly, which is good for perking up your mitigator or taunt buffer when you don't need her SBB buffs to reactivate. DEF ignore is kinda just... there. She falls for Gumi's old buff timing problems here, so don't expect her BB to ignore DEF on the turn you use it. Not much else to say here. Her SBB is AoE (better), has 24 drop checks total (we're back up to decent drop checks after a slew of lower ones recently), and gives two major buffs - 80% spark damage and 200% BB modifier buff. Unfortunately, she has a BB timing issue preventing her from benefiting from the BB modifier buff on the first turn, which I'd like to see fixed. Thankfully this kind of error doesn't mess with spark damage, however. Oh, and her SBB has pseudo-nuke base modifier (620%) which would push her up to Loch SBB-levels of damage if the buff was timed properly due to her stat advantage over him (minus the one-hit count advantage he has).   Regardless, 80% spark damage and 200% BB modifier increase is huge. One of the most powerful offensive buff combinations outside of critical chance in a crit squad.  UBB is a ridiculous damage booster, again. 250% ATK, 500% BB modifier, +2 hit count? Your squad's gonna be hitting hard no matter how they decide to attack for the next 3 turns. Normal attacks will be at 1050% damage before considering other boosts from LS and spheres, and 7* SBB will be at 1350% minimum damage ('cept Melchio, his SBB damage mod sucks)   Unfortunately the UBB doesn't benefit from its own buffs, so it only hits at 1200% damage instead of 1950% damage. There goes her chance to outdamage Rize :(    Overall, Zenia's another very strong unit. I wouldn't say she's as ridiculous as Deimos (massive damage buffs aren't a game breaker) but she's definitely at the top end of the scale. Gumi need to fix her buff timings unless they consider not benefitting from the DEF ignore/BB mod/UBB buffs when activated a necessary measure to keep her down (frankly JPBF will powercreep this within 2 months easily), but nobody likes having buff timings inconsistent with other units in the game.  For anybody looking to use her in the future, remember that you won't be finding her as useful if you want to use Roa for his LS; however her LS is comparable and acceptable considered against Raaga's.   Necessary fix: Fix buff timing on all tiers of BB     These two are incredibly strong and I wouldn't be surprised if they get toned down a little before release, so before pulling check that they haven't been changed. However, Gumi probably won't touch them after that unless we find a bug with Taunt that lets us autobattle Xie'Jing.  Oh, and I really love Zenia's art. Please don't screw up with the sprite, Gumi."

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Floire,2,Tue Jul 21 10:34:41 2015 UTC,"Dual Deimos leads with his ES sphere and Fallacy Orb  +135% HP each (hell we don't even know if Forgebreaker gves him any more), regen any damage you take, status immunity, alternating taunts so you can maintain SBB off his LS even in single target content. As long as the enemy doesn't LS lock, buff remove or ignore DEF, you're pretty much untouchable, and buff removal generally assumes it's specifically timed and you can guard through it, or it's not going to be enough damage to kill and Deimos will keep on trucking with his massive bulk.  Or you could mix him with DEF -> ATK buffers. 50% DEF -> ATK would give him 245% damage on SBB, 195% damage on BB. Well, more - his DEF is way higher than his ATK. If you use him in a full squad, though, you'll want a lot of BC support for your other units and to make sure he pushes to SBB every turn to maintain that 1-turn buff."

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,blackrobe199,3,Tue Jul 21 11:46:05 2015 UTC,"Lessee...

They have a 140 ATK difference, so 6228/140 = 44.48, or 4448% damage modifier increase required for Zenia to outdamage Mifune.  We'll assume they can both benefit from equivalent buffs, and there's no buff total that comes close to bringing Zenia to an additional 4448% damage modifier.  Now, I can see you using her as one of the units that's buffing Mifune in the first place... seeing as you'd be doing dual Kira vs a light unit, it'd be pretty awesome. But Mifune would deal more damage in almost any scenario where the two have equal typings."
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Xerte,2,Tue Jul 21 11:56:19 2015 UTC,"ay, you included Zenia's broken ""buff timing"". Assume that is fixed then.  I meant to do it like this,  Zenia:  100% base + 620% SBB + 150% from LS + 200% from SBB + 80% ATK from LS = 1150%  With Kira friend, if she crits : 1150% * 3 = 3450%  against light units: 3450% * 275% = 9487.5%  if sparking: 9487.5% * (150% + 80% from her SBB) = 21821.25%    Mifune, let's say double Kira lead with Zenia accompanying Mifune.  100% base + 800% SBB + 200% from Zenia's SBB = 1100%  With double Kira friend, if he crits : 1100% * 4.5 = 4950%  against light units: 4950 * 4 = 19800%  if sparking: 19800% * (150% + 80% from Zenia's SBB) = 45540%  eh, comparing 21821.25% to 45540%.

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,yokai_tamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:02:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like this was made specifically for incoming content that will produce 0 BC just like eriole's trial in jp. If you look at the thunder unit's ubb it's insta fill 500bc with his leader skill bc fill on hit, and the dark's leader skill is fill on spark. I feel the hit modifier will help spark and be useful for units that didn't spark enough or get hit enough (if using fill on hit) to be able to do more damage and have a chance to spark. Just looking at these 2 units make me think that the incoming global content will include something where you will receive 0bc or the bc resist is extremely high like seria's trial"

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,saggyfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:03:05 2015 UTC,The UBB would appear to give you the ultimate flexibility in your offensive options. +250% ATK and +2 Hitcount = regular attacks become complete Nukes.   So you can do BB's or regular attacks and they both will be doing massive extra damage.
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,xJusteezy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:07:19 2015 UTC,I didn't say it's not powerful. It's just odd that they'd add 2 hit count.

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Alxion_BF,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:44 2015 UTC,"Holy motherflipping cow.  These 2 new units are really really good O.O  The hammer guy has one of the (or the) best LS for Trials. 40% HP + Status immunity + BB on hit? Give me please!  Luckily, as a sub unit he is not incredible, so grabbing a friend one will suffice.  The dark unit, on the other side, is the most perfect Raid unit in existence. 80% spark + 200% BB mod buff + nuke class SBB modifier + ST BB for material parts that needs to be focused?  12/10 for Raid units. best unit by far in that department.  I'm really hesitant wether to pull for them, honestly. I want to save all my gems for God Rare Summon but I do want that dark unit for Raids. However, Roa + Will makes her very redundant, so I'm really torn wether to summon or not... Let's see how high is the actual rate before deciding..."
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Ashencroix,2,Tue Jul 21 08:08:14 2015 UTC,"Right now, Zenia fills the role of Raaga and Lava combined in global. Compared to Roa + Will, they take 2 unit spaces but have better utility and buff variation. Roa also has the advantage of HP buff on LS. Decisions, decisions."
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Alxion_BF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:15:35 2015 UTC,"I really really want that dark unit. He's the most perfect Raid unit in existence, and I love Raid.   But at the moment, she can be used fine as a Leader, until we need the dual HP leads, and then Roa would be need as a Leader. I'm really torn wether Roa + Blades or Roa + Will would be better. Torn towards Roa + Blades, but you would need to bring a healer of sorts while Will heal are usually sufficient so you can bring a nuker in that place...   Ahhhhhhhhh! Not sure if I'll summon or not. I have to stay rationale xD Decisions everywhere!"
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Ashencroix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:23:37 2015 UTC,Roa and Zenia unfortunately will bring spark buff overlap which is a slight waste. Lets just hope that the next batch will feature a unit that is a better partner to Zenia than Roa.
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Alxion_BF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:46:33 2015 UTC,"Yup! The major problem rigth now is that we have a major lack of offensive HP leaders. Crits are nice but not for crit resistant content, Roa is by far the best 'universally' as spark is unresisted and it LS is exceptional for BB managenent (this is the main reason why I doubt about summoning Zenia :-( ) and I guess Michelle with its atk buff could be considered offensive, although imho its pretty weak both in the offensive and the bb management category (froma raid perspective. From arena is godly)  Lets hope next batch improves this situation (although the rate up will have ended by then :-( )"

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Alxion_BF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:03:47 2015 UTC,"Not the only one. She's the best Raid unit to ever see ligth in any version of BF. Very tempted to pull for her, surely will do if there is 5+1 featured instead of 10+1 featured.  If it's 10+1 and with no or very sligth rate up I'll pass though. I'll try in the future in the new God Rare Summon Door (or if global exclusives are in the normal in a tier /popular unit rate up featured there)"
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,KeikoCute,2,Tue Jul 21 10:04:13 2015 UTC,the UBB on Dark Unit has a feel for the UBB for Ruby interms of add hit count +2(both have the same) Ruby converts 100% rec to ATK while this one has a modifier of 250% on ATK and 500% BB modifier....  There would be a good competition for comparing normal attack nukes brought about by using the UBB on both. I hope global updates the UBB buffs to stack with the regular buffs to see the true power of this dark unit.

BB/SBB was what I expected from 7* Ultor. AND FILL 500 BC on UBB?! Is this a typo or is this real life. Overall, super tanky unit imo.  Obsidian Seraph Zenia  Purely damage based unit. On paper, it looks like she outright outclasses Raaga. She has better ES than Raaga since she has hit count +1 and status raise 20%. Also, pretty good SBB damage modifier and very similar to Loch's SBB. As someone who maxed imped anima Raaga, this is slightly depressing.   Side note: None of these new units require raid drop from Raid X2, so I am guessing Ultor and Tridon will be needing them instead?"

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,saggyfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:13:07 2015 UTC,Gumi might have looked at the data and found that friggin' nobody evolved their Elaina/Grandt because they weren't good enough units to justify the work of farming Raid just to evolve them (especially since it was needed for 7 AND 6 star versions).   Grandt is actually decent but I have Colt so there's not a lot of appeal. Elaina honestly isn't bad either but she has stiff competition from units that do stuff just a tad better and her LS was surprisingly bad for a 7* when you consider Tridon's 6* was substantially better. They could have at least given her a 30% HP  boost for God's sake.
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,john903kr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:22:13 2015 UTC,I think they realized their mistake. That's why they made these units much more appealing.

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,cmc_serith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:31:33 2015 UTC,Yeah but who cares about BC gen in arena these days?  Practically every 7 star unit has insane hitcounts now so there's hardly any reason to use a unit specifically for a high hitcount.

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,blackrobe199,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:49:39 2015 UTC,"At first glance, a lead Deimos pounds Griel hard, repeatedly, tirelessly, and mercilessly. On trials, he is arguably more useful as a leader and as a sub. Basically stronger Ultor alternative -- just like everyone said.  At first glance, Zenia got all the attention. With skills like that, well... she beats Dion, his crit chance+ BB being the only thing she doesn't have. Her BB has instant +9 BC, compare with Aaron's +8 BC. I guess I should stop here, because those interested will be itchy to post unit review momentarily."
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Alxion_BF,2,Tue Jul 21 09:03:55 2015 UTC,"Well, Zenia is basically the best unit in existence for Raids by heaps.   Nuke modifier on SBB, dual top or very close to top tier damaging buffs (spark + BB mod), ST BB with a very high modifier for hard part farming (Balmedia tail), +9 BB will come handy for single target Raid bosses, good hitcount, nice BC cost requirement, amazing UBB, awesome stats and imp cap...

bravefrontier,3e1n0i,MathError89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:14:49 2015 UTC,Is it me or the dark unit completely outclasses raaga and ruby as a subunit? maybe not leader because raaga still got the 100% spark buff though. The UBB and SBB seems OP. o.0
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Lucassius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:01:33 2015 UTC,"UBB is redundant though. 3 turns x3 hit+ 250% ATK means you will normal ATK most of the time (except your mitigator), why add that BB mod buff?"
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Alxion_BF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:12:18 2015 UTC,"Do you have your SBB ready? Aim for that 1250% SBB (500 base + 500 UBB + 250 atk buff) or 1450% SBB when UBB and SBB stacks.  Don't have full SBB ready? normal attack for 1000%+ damage and get your SBB ready for next turn. Also, enemy HP pool management (ie: killing Afla without touching Zurg HP)"
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,MathError89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:22:38 2015 UTC,"This dark unit is all-in-one package. And the ubb makes nuking so much easier ; either by normal attack or by SBB. So, i guess it's safe to assume that he completely outclasses raaga and ruby then as subunit then?"
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Alxion_BF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:33:16 2015 UTC,"As a sub unit by far. The only doubt would be as leader, as I'm not really sure 80% at + 150% bb modifier would improve the 100% spark damage on Raaga LS.  Anyway, I would still choose Zemia over Raaga as she offers way more outside the LS.  The real problem for Zemia, imho, and where she may get competition is Roa. Dual HP leaders are everytime more needed, and when that happens, Roa will be on 95%+ of the ocasions where you would be proned to use a Zemia. With, that, the spark buff is already covered and Zemia ""only"" has the BB modifier and nuke class SBB. The first part can be covered by Will which also offers healing, so the thing finally would result in:  Will + Roa + free unit  versus  Roa + Zemia + healer/pseudohealer of sort  Not sure which one would do more damage but I'm inclined to believe the first option overall has more potential for damage...  Anyway, Zemia is amazing (both those new units are) so having one would be incredible. Waiting to see the rates and if by any chance Gumi pulls a 5+1 with one of them featured before deciding to summon  And for dual Kira FG teams she's beyond amazing"
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Lucassius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:41:00 2015 UTC,"Eh I guess so... would be cool if she had an ATK convert buff or something though, pushing the normal ATK damage even further. But that's just me nitpicking, they're all OP. Hope they won't get nerfed. By the way, the Thunder guy is exactly like 7* Ultor. Is there any chance that this guy will be better than the original Ultor? lol."
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Alxion_BF,2,Tue Jul 21 11:35:40 2015 UTC,"In fact I'm really really scared of tomorrow after seeing this units info.  They are OP as hell, so I have expectations that the original SBS are at this level of OPness, which is great.  But releasing just the day before another taunter, and broken as hell? If Ultor is that good, why would anyone (that has Ultor) summon for Demios? I'm really afraid they make Ultor lose quite heavily in the comparison to avoid this scenario :-("
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,Lucassius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:44:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly. When that happens, imagine the salt from those who spent it all on Ultor... Maybe they will give Ultor some other niche? Either way, we'll see tomorrow."
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,zaunfink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:49:21 2015 UTC,"I hate my resolve not to spend on this game. Crap. Hopefully Ultors 7* will make me less salty, because I already have him. Oh well, no more pulling for Tridon then."
bravefrontier,3e1n0i,mangoshakekouhai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:28:59 2015 UTC,"So basically...   Blade Lady semi-murders Raaga in terms of damage, especially when UBB stacking with normal stuff update comes out. If she had HP boost rather than Atk boost on her LS, she would've killed powercreeped Roa too. Hammer dude is bulky Ultor- the LS is practically designed for Trials. Not much to say. Oh, he also has all stat boost, so those Alices actually boost atk decently for once. As of time I'm writing this, Deathmax's still datamining, so no idea about Ultor and Tridon 7 star uwu. But the two new units Gumi seems to have made look promising."

Result: they never summon again."
bravefrontier,3e1hq7,jevans774,5,Tue Jul 21 06:14:37 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's not like we won't summon until we have the most meta/powercreep batch, it's just that as we know what the future departs us, we can plan the most efficient gem cost route for us.  In that sense, out of Vestie batch the only ""meta"" unit is Vestie. She can be used fine as a friend, so there's no need to pull now, and with the reduced pool in God Rare Summon it will not be that hard to get her if there is the 3 gem promo (should be, the new rare summons in JP are confirmed to come with 3 gem promo so it seems from now on every new batch will have no rate up but will come with 3 gem cost). All the other units are nothing stellar and have at much 1 month of life before getting outclassed, so from a Return of Profit perspective, summoning in Vestie batch ia a horrible inversion.  With that said, the smart thing to do is wait until Summoners of Old + God Rare Summon, that batch really defines the meta. Maybe this new batch will be even more ""powercreeper"" (which I doubt, unless they raise the cost past 42), but with summoners of Old and whatever you can snatch from the God summon dood, you should more than be able to complete any content in a few months.  From there, if any of these units result stellar, you go for them 1 per 1 in the popular unit rate up / tier rate up. But as a batch, the smartest decision will be going for Summoner of Old (this batch is the new Zelnite batch for 7* )"

bravefrontier,3e1hq7,EPIC_Deer,2,Tue Jul 21 09:04:03 2015 UTC,"Nemeth Gear meta? Where? Imp farming? Its main niche is its UBB for FG2 and FH Middle (now End) nuke teams, and there are quite a few equally viable alternatives (Dual Dion teams, for example).  And Toutetsu? Ok, Arena meta. So what? I have lost 4 times maximum in the past 3k matches, and any decent team has a 95%+ ratio easily so the improvement would be ridiculously low if there is. Another time his main niche is nuke teams (more concretely Dual Dion teams for FG1 farming on Auto). Not the best niche to have, covered by other units, and not worth summoning specifically, imho."

bravefrontier,3e1hq7,EPIC_Deer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:49 2015 UTC,"When you can do one thing perfectly, doing it even better than perfectly gives absolute 0 benefit. This is exactly Toutetsu case.  Toutetsu unique niche is being able to 1 turn KO on Arena with a very specific setup (Bestie, Selena, Raaga, Iris, Zenia on Global).   Other than that, there are ton of units that does the same as Toutetsu, which is winning Arenas: Michelle, Quaid, Selena, Kikuri, Magress, Atro, Sefia, Griel, Ultor, and the list is so long we would not end. Even Zelnite/Elza 6* guarantee 98% wins with the eyes closed  And Nemeth Gear does have one of the best UBB in the game, and as you say is key as of maximizing FH points in last Terminus. Does that make him meta? Not in the slightest. Being best at one and only one particular thing is the definition of niche. The only difference between Nemeth and Zerafalga is that Nemeth niche is more useful than Zerafalgar. Summoning specifically for it seems a waste, but that's everyone decision (I would much rather go ham on Gliph, Roa, Ribera, Bestie, Zemia / Deimios, Elimo, Zeldeus, Melchio, Will, etc. those units really define the meta and are worth every single pence of inversion)"
bravefrontier,3e1hq7,Alxion_BF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you'd ever run Raaga in the Arena, and Totetsu lead in Arena is better for 1TKO than Bestie anyway. Either way he's still in the Arena lead meta, which is all I was trying to make clear. And Arena isn't a mechanic specific enough to consider him niche.  Nemeth Gear being godlike for FH still makes him not niche in my opinion. As people get better squads at farming points for higher rank, as is the case in JP's recent FH, being able to optimize for higher scores and in turn higher ranks and +5s is what causes me to see him as ""worth pulling for"". Maybe not specifically, but in their rate up batch. Even then pulling for specifically on Global has caused me a lot of disappointment."
bravefrontier,3e1hq7,EPIC_Deer,2,Tue Jul 21 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"Raaga, Bestie, Iris and Selena are used as a sub units on Toutetsu arena teams, as they are the only units with double hitcount and can easily achieve a 1 turn KO thanks to Toutetsu Leader Skill. As you saif, no point on using Raaga in Arena for anything else (well, nice DC drops but who cares with so many better options :-P)  Other than this particular team Toutetsu serves no purpose in the Arena metagame (yes, it is better than Bestie, but does it really matter turning 1 defeat per 700 victories to 1 defeat per 1200 victories? total and brutal waste of gems imho).  Nemeth is good for FH, yes, however JP and GLBF situations are totally different. In Global most veterans have already HR41 or will get it easily by the time JPBF increases rewards. JPBF has a MASSIVE influx of (mostly Global) players due to the awesome 2nd anniverary (veterans that want all the rewards as soon as possible). They also have a ton of gem giveaways so the competition is fierce to say the least.  When you can easily get a +4 on auto with a subpar team, you don't need to maximize points on FH. Even less if you are already on HR41 and only do once each stage for the rewards. And summoning him is a very bad idea when by the time you will really need him it will be severely outclassed (Nemia today already has a better UBB. In 4/5 months it will be totally obsolete).  Also, even if you really wanted Nemeth, pulling for a specific batch is pretty bad in investment terms, unless like Summoners of Old, 4 out of the batch are totally meta and the other 2 almost. Out of Nemeth batch the only worthwhile is Bestie. For explaining purposes lets say also Nemeth, although I differ. Getting any of the other 4 units which are less than desirable is like not getting anything, and that's the most probable thing to happen.  Compare it to save it for God Rare Summon and its 3 gem cost, with 150 gems you are pretty much guaranteed to have every single unit minus 3 or 4 (50 summons, 36 possible units). And every non desired unit will be a 7* , not a random Lemia (for example). And as you said, Global rate ups are pretty bad, so anything that you can do to improve your chances is awesome.  With that I am not meaning they are bad, but if you want the best return of profit for your gems, waiting for God rare Summon is much much better."
bravefrontier,3e1hq7,Alxion_BF,3,Tue Jul 21 20:34:11 2015 UTC,"I just gave up waiting for Besti. Got a Ruby and Ultor now, so yeah, I'm okay with this.  Hoarding gems is nice, and so is having a bunch of summons for a specific rate up, but I just don't have that kind of patience."

So the princess join another faction and throw away Inaho and Slaine to stop the war, Slaine want to do suicide but it failed, Slaine comrades somehow killed and then Slaine fight Inaho (which should be epic last battle but none of this scene stuck in my head), while the other princess fate is unknown, happy end ... what the fuck? * there's some other but really, I want to forget this show    Totally disappointing.

Regardless of how powerful it was , it would have been useless if Inaho didn't have the eye and attention for detail to focus upon. Also keep in mind that S1 had pretty much 1 Aldnoah Unit at a time, while S2 was multiple Aldnoah Units coming in so the ""power creep"" in Inaho's capabilities would have to be scaled up, otherwise S2 would have ended short.      Almost all of the episode are like soap drama (S1 got it too, but it's only at some point), it really annoys me how an epic mecha battle setting ruined by half assed love story that (supposedly) emphasized the tragedy,    Well given the protags are a bunch of kids(albeit miltary trained) thrown into the middle of a war between planets, so drama happens.As for the half-assed love story, I kinda liked it since it wasn't the typical protag gets the girl, and it underlines the reality of war and necessity over personal wants.      Inaho and Slaine of S2 are stupid (even I don't like Inaho S1), it's almost like Slaine got Inaho's dark personality+revenge while Inaho somehow become Slaine's good side+love for the princess (I still hate the fact that Inaho shot down Slaine in S1 which should be their advantage and end the war efficiently, but yep it's soap drama),    Not really soap drama per se, but I do agree the 180 in Slaine's character with really no motivation or development as to his motivations in S2 was a sore point. On the flip side Inaho, didn't really change, S2 jsut kinda saw him change to the point of being able to articulate his feelings for Asseylum.      The last one is the forced ending. So the princess join another faction and throw away Inaho and Slaine to stop the war, Slaine want to do suicide but it failed, Slaine comrades somehow killed and then Slaine fight Inaho (which should be epic last battle but none of this scene stuck in my head), while the other princess fate is unknown, happy end ... what the fuck? Again, I'd touch on my earlier points of necessity overweighing the needs and wants of the individual in reality. At that point Slaine had fucked up shit so badly, the only way for Asseylum to achieve any semblance of peace was to establish her position as the supreme ruler of Mars, choosing a consort that would carry credibility with the Martian Nobility (ie. Not Inaho) and impose her will.    That said, I enjoyed the fact that it didn't end in the usual happy family ending that people seem to enjoy, sure it's nice but it usually doesn't work like that. Onto the Mecha part, designs were VERY good, and the Aldnoah units had interesting abilities that made them a force to be reckoned with but not OP."

It's happened both times I've tried to clear the fight for the gold achiefvement.  I can get Mashreed down to about < 5% HP and it runs.  I then get a cutscene where Grah says he should go after him.  Next thing I know I get the cutscene where you first encounter Mashreed and am asked to select team order again (both times I've had the same thing happen 3-5 times before giving up).    Am I doing something wrong?  If anyone has any suggestions, please share, as it is getting incredibly frustrating (Grah's GQ isn't the longest, but I don't want to throw away another 50 energy without more information).  I'm level 270 and I've used each of my squads 1-3 to take it down but am getting the same loop.  Do you have to nuke it down from > 5%?  Anything would be helpful.  EDIT: I tried nuking Mashreed down from over its threshold where it runs, and I definitely depleted all of its HP and still had the same problem.

bravefrontier,3e1rim,Bottlecap_Prophet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"Generally a mitigator, a status nuller, and some form of BB regen is good. Depending on your team, you may also find a healer helpful.  BB regen could be passive (Lilly Matah, Diana, Kikuri) or via BBs like Zelnite's.  Which means, I guess that Aaron could be pretty helpful.  Also, if you're having trouble maintaining mitigation, what I did was bring two mitigators."

bravefrontier,3e1rim,JnRc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:50 2015 UTC,no content in global requires double hp leads. raaga + hp lead is generally the best combo atm for pretty much all global content. Being able to blast past hp thresholds is way better than trying to tank with elimo ubb or w/e.

The above squad can be used for clearing quests and to increase your level and cost.
bravefrontier,3e1rim,JnRc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll try out this team once I can level and evolve zelnite. So Selena not worth it till I get her 7*S?"
bravefrontier,3e1rim,TheWoif,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:31 2015 UTC,"For now, you can focus on your Selena/Darvanshel (assuming you made a typo).   Reason being Selena is a pretty solid unit in the arena with her unique sphere, and you will need Darvanshel's damage mitigation abilities to clear the trials at a later time. Unless a better 7* mitigator comes along such as Edea/Aaron  Selling of units is not really advisable as they are currently revamping some of the old units, so you might wanna keep them around.  P.S. :My opinion may differ from others, you have the choice of whether to follow my advice or not :D"

I pulled lodin (A) and azael (A) and have two kira (B)s lying around. Then pulled Alpha (B) and Rowgen (G).  Today I pulled Arus (O), Zenia (L), Ivris (A). From my understanding all these are good?

bravefrontier,3e1rim,SeventhVeil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:08 2015 UTC,i just got the new summon Zenia and i took a look at her 7 star form how does the hit increase work? it says +2 each normal hit count am i to understand it as it is normal 13 + ES = 15 hit counts and if thats the case is Lexida the only sphere with a double in hit count?
bravefrontier,3e1rim,AlbertKartoffel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"1)It doesn't work that way bud, maybe it's worded badly. Anyway, it increase hit per hit. If it's her Extra skill, just imagine that her hits are doubled. Same with her UBB, imagine that all her hits are tripled. Take note that this only apply to her normal atk. But normal atk can be very powerful if it's buffed properly.  2) There are other 2 spheres iirc, one from arena and the other is hallowed skull, the one from halloween dungeon"
bravefrontier,3e1rim,IAmViruz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"No her ES is also double but yes I'm pretty sure Lexida is the only sphere that doubles hit count, but a lot of Extra Skills do as well"
bravefrontier,3e1rim,Relnish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:01 2015 UTC,Its +1/hit. So 13 * 2 (hits) * 3 (drop checks).   Adding Lexida to the mix is 13 * 3 * 3.
bravefrontier,3e1rim,3RDxCharm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:21 2015 UTC,"It's +2 hits per hit, So if it's 13 + 2*13 = 39 hits So Zenia's ES is +1hit/hit, so 13 + 1*13 = 26  Hallowed Skull & Sinister Orb double hit count as well. Some high Arena Rewards double as well. Those are +1hit/hit."

Does this only make BC Drop Rate Bonuses less effective, or does the resistance apply to the base 35% BC drop chance as well?    If it applies to the base BC drop chance, I don't see the effectiveness of the drop buffs being decreased unless the resistance is higher than 35%.      Ares type multipliers, since they depend on the amount of BC dropped, will see a drop in relative value regardless of of how resistance works."

bravefrontier,3e1ojc,Waynebts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:44 2015 UTC,"For me it was spam sbb for the first stage, second stage was killing golem before lira with ark bb, then making sure to time leorone's buff removal with guard. Third stage was honestly just spamming sbb, got a little unlucky towards the end when it was lira+oulu, but I think I was pretty lucky for the majority of the run.

bravefrontier,3e1jtr,JeremyBF,2,Tue Jul 21 06:42:22 2015 UTC,"Any damage over the shield within the same attack will hit the unit's HP but use the shield's defence and earth typing. The next attack (even within the same turn) will then use the units defence. The problem is that threshold type attacks tend to be a single attack for massive damage meaning that the shield makes you way weaker, but those are basically the only attacks where you need more sirvivability so Tridon is essentially useless."

bravefrontier,3e1jtr,randylin26,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:09:11 2015 UTC,Go look at the new Global exclusives...... Ultor and Tridon is really going to have to get into their level now DX
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Alxion_BF,3,Tue Jul 21 12:43:41 2015 UTC,"At first sight Tridon is the more ""promising"" unit as he needs very little to be amazing.   Just buffing its numbers and more than anything, buffing the shield defense to an actual useful number would already make it top tier 7* . If by any chance he passes from 10% LS to 15% LS mitigation at the same time, he will shit on Grah 6* which is still used for almost every single Trial/hard content.  As for Ultor, he is on a hard position, as he can cover quite a few roles and it's very difficult that its 7* buffs all of them. In that sense, buffing a bit its LS, making its BB AOE + Angel Idol ES would return him to the Arena top tier.   The same Angel Idol ES or BB on hit ES + buffed self defense buff + maybe >50% mitigation on self would reinforce its taunt capabilities.  And his 6* form has an amazing atack stat + a top tier attack buff at the time of release. Increasing it to 140% or higher + lasting more than one turn and maybe giving him another offensive buff or nuke tier BB multiplier (620% for example) would make him a nuke (his 7* forms looks brute and menacing as hell, so could see it happenning).  Of course, it's impossible they buff all of this at the same time and they could even go a different route, so it's a matter of waiting to see what happens.  Personally, I could not care less for Arena having lost 3 or 4 times in the last 2750 matches or so, so I would much rather have him buffed in  the other areas..."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Alxion_BF,2,Tue Jul 21 07:55:22 2015 UTC,"Unless they fix the shield mechanic, Tridon's still gonna be dead weight I think. But having a universal mit buff would be amazing with the HP boost LS. Grah's still a nice free alternative, particularly for light/dark content.  With Ultor, since he also has that Atk buff, stacking all those buffs is unlikely, but something like the Angel Idol ES and a slight mitigation would give him huge edge in Trials and GGC imo. BB on hit not that much because all it does is basically make him a walking target forever, because even if he does BB again, nobody else will really get hit and he's just going to take massive damage. It'd be hilarious if he effectively became the next Haradon though with the potential ability to absorb all hits with potential Angel Idol/BB on hit ES (preferrably BB on damage) and twin 7* Tridon leads with their boosted LS and Shields xD Only unit to get hit outside of AOE, infinite BB and never dying would be broken but hilarious. Then would come the nerfing"
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,jevans774,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:03:48 2015 UTC,"Ultor with Paris GQ sphere, Fallacy Orb, an Angel Idol + BB on hit ES would definitively be ""nerf-worthy"" xDDD  But looking at the new RS units I really doubt they are not OPas hell, so I'm happy in that regard as I have 2 of each ^^  About Tridon shield, I think a lot of people undervalue it. I've been using it anywhere lately (Trial X3, Trial 06, Lugina GQ) and the shield is more than able to absorb a nice chunk of damage of their Ultimate attacks without being deadweight. It's only against single hit attacks that its actually dead weight, but those are really few for now"
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Alxion_BF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:33:58 2015 UTC,"Tridon's shield just needs to match the Def of the unit it is on and it'll be fine. And I've been saying for a while now that Ultor's 7* should have self mitigation (probably with a different buff no. too, so it isn't overwritten by normal mitigators)."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,cmc_serith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:29:38 2015 UTC,"The problem with Ultor self mitigation would be that in GLBF there is no stacking process yet (UBB, LS, SBB) so unless it's overwritten it would result in a total broken unit.  Also, after Demios having also Taunt but without self mitigation, I don't see it happening, truth to be told :-(  That said, it would be awesome if it happens!  Totally agree with Tridon. Using the unit defense would convert the shield effectively into an extra HP bar, which would be beyond awesome :-)  Hyped as fuck for tomorrow, more after seeing those 2 units from today (really hoping Gumi don't fuck with us and make Tridon and Ultor garbage so we pull for these 2 new units, that scares me a lot as I see them capables)"
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,jevans774,2,Tue Jul 21 09:39:49 2015 UTC,"50% mitigation on self for Ultor would be nifty.  It wouldn't be major, of course, since you'd need a regular mitigator still anyways, but it might help Ultor cover for your mitigator for a turn in some content.  Of course, with the way mitigation stacks, anything stronger would be way overpowered.  (A 60% self mitigation buff, for instance, would suddenly make it really easy to make him immune or near immune to most boss damage.)"
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Dericwadleigh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:47 2015 UTC,"the lack of BB/UBB stacking is why I say to give it a different buff ID. then they could drop the Def buffs. They could even just make it his ES (that, or a BC fill on hit).  But yes I was very worried too when I saw that Demios has taunt. The timing is too convenient to be innocent."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,BionicMexican,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:46:46 2015 UTC,"Actually, there is some buff stacking, just not much yet. I routinely stack aurelia and atro's def buffs. Hers gives def according to rec and he gives 100%. I know they stack because if you look in the character info during battle, it shows two def buffs."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,akaieevee,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"I want Ultor to have a BB or SBB with a selfish 50% Damage Mitigation to himself with Taunt, that way if you have a damage mitigation unit that doesn't have their BB filled then let Ultor use his BB or SBB and guard or attack with the other units knowing Ultor can take the hits.  As for Tridon, a stronger shield and 30% chance to regain 20%  health upon getting attacked.  An improved leader skill for both will also be great."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,BlueW0lv,2,Tue Jul 21 06:48:25 2015 UTC,"Ultor already has that though basically. His Def buff acts as enough mitigation under most circumstances for me, strangely enough"

bravefrontier,3e1jtr,IshadTX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:05:19 2015 UTC,"If Ultor's 6* abilities are augmented slightly for 7* and he gets a crit buff on SBB, I'll be happy. Mitigation would be nice too."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,IshadTX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:35:05 2015 UTC,"I for one wouldn't want tridon to get a 15% mitigation across the board. That would seriously make all the units with - 15% elemental mitigation useless and that's supposed to be their niche. Granted some would still have their uses and other LS but with double tridon thats at the minimum +60% hp and rec and - 30% mitigation to EVERY attack, even the scripted HP attacks. Thats really broken. Then again this is Gumi were talking about. I just want tridon and ultor to hace decent bc fill rates or at least increased drop checks."

bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Jasiwel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:43:00 2015 UTC,"I will only focus on SBB, Ls and ES since I always auto everything  Ultor7*  LS: a buffed version of his 6*  SBB: taunt + self def 250+% + 140+%attack + another damage buffing like BB mod/crit damage/param to attack.  Es: either angel idol or 3-5 bb on hit(any of these two would suffice) but i think a 50-75% chance to reduce taken damage by 25? Would be good also.  Tridon 7*  Ls: same as above  Sbb: a fixed shield + bb regen+ 140%def + 50% mitigation  Es: bb each turn or bb on hit or x2 hits?"

bravefrontier,3e1jtr,hergumbules,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:05 2015 UTC,why not XD zenia and deimos are already on par with current bfjp units...so why not ultor and tridon too?
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,psytrac77,0,Tue Jul 21 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"tridon. fix shields... or better yet, get rid of shield mechanic and make it a max hp buff for 3 turns so you will benefit from def buffs.  ultor... no clue. feel like deimo took the title of taunt king. maybe if he goes full offensive in terms of buffs?"
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,saggyfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:19:44 2015 UTC,"Well, we can't say that about Deimos until we see Ultor's build. Deimos uses it exceptionally well in defensive purposes and just gains massive defenses and HP. But Ultor is and always has been a more offensively oriented unit, and I feel like it's like looking at two sides of the coin. Due to this, I feel like again, if he gains an Angel Idol buff on his ES, then he'll have his place alongside Deimos in different usages. However, with the chances of that actually happening, it's reasonable to say that for standardised use, and particularly as a leader, Deimos is probably going to be better outside of arena."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,JackWarran,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:55 2015 UTC,"Ultor is basically guaranteed to be a disappointment. His leader skill likely won't outclass quiad/Michelle for the arena, and Deimos will likely be better as a sub for content, as well as a much better lead for content."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,N0xSolace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, you say that, but what they have is a massive ATK boost and that's pretty much it, with Michelle getting a slight crit boost. Ultor has a crit boost on his LS, an Atk boost that with hopefully, if not likely outshine Michelles on his 7* and an elemental weakness buff on that LS too. If he were on a rainbow arena team, whether or not he's better would probably depend on the opponents team composition more than your own.  As for content, Deimos is a more defensively oriented unit. IF and pretty much only IF they give Ultor that Angel Idol ES, he'd be much better offensively as a sub unit. But as Ultor has a more offensive LS, he'll be better for arena whereas Deimos will be better for things such as Raid or Trials"
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,shammikaze,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:48 2015 UTC,Michelle has a bc boost and a hp boost which is far more valuable than 3 dmg modifiers. Basically if ultor doesn't get ares or bb cost reduced on his leader skill he won't be worth leading over quaid/Michelle/krantz/lugina
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,JeremyBF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:41 2015 UTC,"Stats and Leader Skills that make them not obsolete after Bestie's batch. They already have unique mechanics, but if their stats aren't good then Bestie's batch will completely outshine them."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,xMatttard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:55 2015 UTC,Dont worry about stats. SBS 6 star unit stats is the best in the game and their 7 star will likely follow
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Hououin_KyoumaSG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly concerned about Stat Modifiers in their abilities over Base Stats. Tridon's shield has a weak defense modifier, alongside being buggy half of the time still. Ultor is going to need a stronger Defense modifier too if he is to take a lot of the single-target hits that future bosses have. It's mostly cost-effectiveness and streamlining. Neither provide any form of BC generation/manipulation and that becomes exceptionally important in future content. If they don't provide BC manipulation, then their Stat Modifiers need to be quite stellar."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Mitch_Twd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:47 2015 UTC,15% fix miti and angel idol buff for ultor es is sounds op.   For tridon I hope he have bc reduce for his bb/sbb and other that can make him spam his shield also he fixed his shield mechanic.
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Hououin_KyoumaSG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:28 2015 UTC,For SBS to be at least nearly as good as the new cash grabbers...
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Mitch_Twd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"For Ultor, a boost all across the board probably. It was the best o its kind then so likely similar trends. Sbb should probably add self mitigation to taunt.   Tridon, ls boost with mitigation up for thunder while other elements at 10%. Shield probably same but add ls negation prevention while shield is up ;)"
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Hououin_KyoumaSG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:41 2015 UTC,"Really it's simple for Ultor and Tridon.   Ultor    Decent damage modifiers to go with that excellent ATK stat, none of this 350% AOE bullcrap.  Something unique added to his Taunt mechanic (How about Increases max HP by 20% or Self-Mitigation? Or maybe a Fire Shield?)   Tridon   More/Different Shield Elements. Unless they start releasing more units with shields it's lame that the ONLY two shields available to us are non-elemental (Egg Item) or Earth-Elemental.  Healing or BB Generation besides just a BC drop buff. Aurelia is really the only one with any type of healing and Tridon has his REC/HP LS so I don't see why he has a BC buff instead of some form of healing. Maybe something similar to Alyut's 7* SBB except instead of the DEF->ATK buff he has the shield.    Their leader skills are honestly pretty good already so there's room for improvement but as long as they give them great stats and usable moves, I don't think we'll be too disappointed. I might like to see an interesting tidbit added like Ultor can nullify Weak Elements and Tridon could Nullify Criticals. That would add value but also considering the other aspects of their leader skills, wouldn't be overdoing it."
bravefrontier,3e1jtr,Mitch_Twd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"Look at the thunderborn, how could you be satisfied? So take that thunder ultor into consideration, I need my 7* tridon to have at least 40% hp LS, better if 45%, plus a 15% mitigation, and a better-than-nothing small BB buff would be ideal,I'm not dreaming for status immu because that's literally OP. Aside from the LS, I need a ES for tridon to take care of his insane bb cost, sphere can be required. Others, just increase his statistics, reduce the cost of bb and give him a acceptable UBB is okay for me.  Ultor needs to be identified as the father of that thunderborn! And his mother must be identified! Please tell me what girl can have a thunder baby with a fire father, and her element Ultor will be a good tank if he has the same ES to null elemental attack as his son. Ultor's dual role as both elemental attack buff and taunt/DEF buff is good and now he needs his SBB to have high DC to taunt every turn."

bravefrontier,3dycm9,chickdigger802,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:34 2015 UTC,Elimo and Aaron seem pretty darn good and we have Edea in 2 days. Plus Shera is still rocking it for the content currently available in global.
bravefrontier,3dycm9,saggyfire,0,Tue Jul 21 01:28:50 2015 UTC,Lacking exclusive one. We got like all the other buffs. That vocaloid has mitigation but only sbb.
bravefrontier,3dycm9,chickdigger802,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:37 2015 UTC,Yeah but he has a pretty amazing leader skill if you happen to have 6 unique elements and still touts a DEF buff with his BB. He's a great complement to a mitigator who needs to waste a turn doing overdrive.   The red one royally sucked but Keito (However it's spelled) is a pretty cool unit.   It is strange that SBS didn't have any and they decided to go half-cocked with Andaria's BB spam LS but give Aurelia an Amazing BB spam LS that basically outclasses Rin in every way. And ... well I could go one for days.   Maybe one of them will get mitigation added for their 7*. Elimo and Edea were hardly worthy of being considered mitigation units with only 25% and only on their SBB; now they're full-fledged mitigators.

bravefrontier,3dycde,Wailordfan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"we'll be getting the guardian buff soon enough, in which case G>L hands down."
bravefrontier,3dycde,Sethowar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"Not for 3 months at the least, I'm saying that for now, lord would be preferred imo. Besides, even two raagas is overkill sometimes, I can't think of any content that would use two raagas, except for maybe trials or GQ for using them as leaders for multiple squads, but it isn't completely necessary.  Besides, survivability is used more often (or at least is a smarter move) for hard end game content, and bb maintenance comes from bb gain on hit/instant regeneration, so raaga isn't always the best choice as leader in those cases either"
bravefrontier,3dycde,Wailordfan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:35:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't disagree on the Raaga front, just making the point about the whole 'guardian is crap' point.  If somebody pulled a G and B unit which is still relevant in 2-3 months (of which raaga is one such unit, still being one of the better spark buffers) then I would be suggesting G>B(L)"
bravefrontier,3dycde,Sethowar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:10 2015 UTC,"I was never saying guardian is a crap type, I just prefer lord because of a more balanced stat set. I never said Gaurdian is crap."
bravefrontier,3dycde,Wailordfan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"Even with the revamp in typing, i still personally prefer Lord type over Guardian for balanced stats. least would be Breaker and Oracle as survivability is a priority right now and in the coming updates/new contents."
bravefrontier,3dycde,JnRc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:39 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think that   2864 3000 2340 is far more useful in a trial/GGC situation, in which Raaga is quite useful!  3102 2524 2459 is a bit of a REC overload.  So yeah... idk, you're in a bit of a position of power here telling people which units to use after summons, and I don't think Lord > Guardian is really the best advice :P but w/e, its your choice"
bravefrontier,3dycde,Sethowar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:39:47 2015 UTC,"It isn't my choice.   My word, you are manipulating everything I say. I said I preferred lord over guardian, and I am giving him advice based on the current game. I'm not going to apply changed that won't occur for at least three months, so if this person waits three months, then yes, guardian becomes more balanced, but right now, I prefer lord typing. I'm not in any type of power, someone could give current data and prove me wrong, but in a case like this, it is a matter of personal opinion. (BTW, I didn't say raaga wasn't useful in ggcs and trials, I said that 2-3 wasn't really useful, as there are other units that could replace the second and third raaga to cover other bases.)"

bravefrontier,3dxs29,agent_87,2,Mon Jul 20 13:25:17 2015 UTC,"I'm on the verge about Loch. As it is right now I would not use him in any foreseeable team and would be a waste of legend stone, but if in the future I manage to snatch a Dion out of the God Rare Summon it woul be incredible for completing FG2 and FG1 farming (that and evolving Griel which is in the same boat for FG1 farming)...  I guess the smartest thing to do in my case would be to have them at 6* lvl max and ready to evolve during this SHS...  On the other side, Edea is a no brainer for me, as I will be able to get rid of 2 6* (Shera + Exvehl) to make space for Edea and any 7* of choice ^^  BTW, I don't see anything wrong in evolving your favourite units (Alice in this case). Even if she's not meta, there are so many OP units that you can still find a space for her for almost everything :-)"
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Alxion_BF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:37 2015 UTC,"As a person with Griel, Loch and Dion, what makes them so useful for that content?"
bravefrontier,3dxs29,MeniteTom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:39:03 2015 UTC,"FG2 is all about nuking power and getting heaps and heaps of attack points. The 2 most used strategies are dual Kira teams with Nemeth Gear UBB and Dual Dion with electric or earth nukers (where Loch fits perfectly if you learn to spark him).  As for FG1, the prioritary goal should be complete it, but afer that is done, you need to farm 1 million esteem points to get every rewards (including a Divine Vessel for Will ES).  Typical run completing the 30 levels with a survival team nets about 2k, while dual Dion teams with Griel as BC buffer and offensive buffers / nukers can earn 4k+ in 10 minutes while playing on Auto. Quite a jump in the speed process when you have to do it hundreds of times"
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Alxion_BF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:48:35 2015 UTC,hundreds of times     Alim why
bravefrontier,3dxs29,CBSU,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:16:59 2015 UTC,I have a loch 6* anima griel 7* half maxed imp anima and a maxed dion 7* u think evolving loch would be good? I have 2 legends stones was thinking edea and alice
bravefrontier,3dxs29,iaredragon,2,Mon Jul 20 13:39:58 2015 UTC,"Rigth now probably it won't make much difference, but whenever Frontier Gate 2 is released Loch would help immensely in reaching the 1.3M points when max imped for attack.  As for farming FG1 I don't value Loch very high because he is very dependant on sparking its single hit. On manual you can do that with relatively succes but on Auto it's totally out of control, and when you have to do anything 100's of times, I would much rather get consistent results on Auto, to be honest.  In any case, I personally wouldn't evolve Alice unless she's one of your favourite units or something like this. She's not very useful to be frank :-("
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Alxion_BF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:28 2015 UTC,Yeah alice is a bae since I started bf (she stuck with me from lvl 30 to lvl 132) but I would prefer evolving units I need (as u see Grand quest demands us to have multiple squad rdy units) so ild value benefit over love. She will eventually be a 7 star in my unit list someday but yeah I guess I'll evolve edea 1st then loch a bit after
bravefrontier,3dxs29,iaredragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:12:44 2015 UTC,"I'm currently running a team with Griel, Oguro, Aaron, Kikuri, and Fadahl. Freeing up a space for another nuker or maybe an attack buffer (all I have in that regard is Atro) wouldn't be the worst thing in the world."
bravefrontier,3dxs29,agent_87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:40:52 2015 UTC,I just want Alice 7 star because she's my favorite. I'm most definitely going to use her on my Arena team to replace Kuda with my rainbow Quaid lead.  Don't know if she's good for arena tho
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Katsuaki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:11 2015 UTC,Question: What makes Dion such a good unit?
bravefrontier,3dxs29,kakumeigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:34 2015 UTC,"Imho it is not that good of a unit. Personally I don't like having to change manually between BB and SBB to use Dion in any content... except on nuke teams.   To put it bluntly, what makes Dion so good for nuke teams is his Leader Skill and having a top BB modifier buff (the buff alone is not even close to enough, Velnir or Will are much better for this role, imho).  That said, his LS is godly for nuke teams on FG1 farming and Fg2 (and Middle farming whe it was a thing)"
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Alxion_BF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:31 2015 UTC,"depends, It's cheaper in terms of MP to fuse since unless it's a 6* you will get less than 1k points with it. If you have lots frogs on the other hand, fire away."

Guess that as you say we will have to wait to see how its 7* forms becomes (tempted to wish nothing spectacular so I don't have to summon for him :-P)"
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Alxion_BF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:59:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, I just had another look at him, and his 7* could make Michele absurdly overpowered.  (potential 7*)  LS: 60% Spark DMG+ (ALL) / 150% CRIT DMG+ (ALL) / 20% CRIT (ALL)  SBB: Thunder (AOE) / 90% Spark DMG+ (ALL) 3Turns / 50% Chance -50% Enemy ATK 1Turns / 50% Chance -50% Enemy DEF 1Turns  Combine one of those with a Michele, suddenly her 40% Crit buff is top tier and you have an utterly twosome, easily displacing Glyph as number 1 crit buffer.  Thankfully for us non-zedus owners, I doubt he'll be really needed outside of max-damage Raid situations unless they give him a super special ES, UBB or new param. As you will always want an Owen or something in one leader slot for the health you can just grab a friends one.  Wow... just thinking about that has breathed life into michele, one of my favourite all time characters and first ever 6* :D"
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Sethowar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Michelle under Zedus LS has all the numbers to potentially be the best crit sub unit by a fair margin (140 atk + crit cap + 2 element buffs? Yes please!) and even Signas can be a really good sub crittbuffer + nuker under that LS!  My only concern, as you said, though, would be the loss of HP on LS which seems to be more impotant than never. I would even prefer Zedus not touching it's numbers and receiving a +30% HP on LS (its actual numbers are already top tier, combining both spark and crit modifier, and even with a 55% (5% short of the cap) crit buff Michelle would be better than Glyph, imho, even more if you bring Melchio for its atk->def buff)"
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Alxion_BF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:27:09 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about mentioning the chance of them throwing the 30% HP on Zedus... we'll have to see what they do with SBS, but for JP at least throwing an errant HP buff onto an existing 6* is would be unprecedented to say the least.   Owen/Grah Lead? Michele Melchio Aaron Bestie? idk Zedus   BC generation is a legitimate issue though, with none of it on LS and crappy drop checks on Zedus. Also healing is kind of an issue :S Maybe Elimo instead of Aaron... though you do lose out on the damage that way :("
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Sethowar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:33:42 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I mean Zedus may have crap normal DC, but he has 24 on SBB (<-- more than many 7*s), and given that that's what you're using most of the time, you'll be fine."
bravefrontier,3dxs29,jevans774,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"If energy is a problem, Zedus + Roa leads would pretty much take care of BC management for everyone minus Zedus (Zeldeus would be out of the picture also, 2 low hit units with Roa would be hard to manage) while keeping the offensive power at sky high levels. A pity the spark buff collides, but for BC management I think that would be the best  Zedus + Roa Leads - Michelle, Aaron, Melchio, Will sounds incredible to me and cover so many bases. The high count hits, Roa LS + Aaron BB fill would probaby cover BC management, althoug I would put a secondary BB sphere on Zedus just in case (a pity because he really wants a Geldnite (Global) with that setup, but I can't come with anything better :-( )  Another option would be Zedus + Gliph. Spark and Crit buffer + a bit of BB management on LS. That would open also a slot for Zeldeus as low hits would not matter and I would personally skip Melchio in favour of Lunaris as of not having to bring a dedicated atk buffer because the team slots would be expensive (healing, BB management, etc. Ribera covers to some extent most of the problems of the team though). Sadly Michelle would be redundant on this setup, though :-(  PS: Those teams would be focused for Raid. For trials Zedus has little relevance and more defensive setups are prefered, imho"
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Alxion_BF,2,Mon Jul 20 14:50:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah... idk, for the most part trial teams are pretty boring and samey. Also, its a bit of - either you get there, or you don't.  So much more room for optimising Raid squads. Shame it isn't a little more beneficial :P"

bravefrontier,3dxs29,jevans774,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"Yup, but with Raids I would pretty much prefer Roa / Glyph LS for the extra damage and using Michelle as a sub unit. Michelle is a good option, though and would free a slot. Then we could try to see if with that extra spot we can deal more general damage that with Roa LS and the spark overlapping.   Anyway, Zedus, on paper, seems like a potentially great 7* unit for Raids"

bravefrontier,3dxs29,JnRc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:56:19 2015 UTC,Edea is the tankiest mitigator out there with 50% defense boost with her sphere equipped and her ES is aoe remove debuff from team when BB/SBB used; very much unit slot efficient.    Griel is kinda defensive lead with Hp boost and anti debuff LS but if you take offensive ones like Raaga lead plus Colt friend Edea might be better.

bravefrontier,3dxs29,lkoiuj_II,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"There isn't much reason you would use Edea as a lead.  No word on Ultor or Tridon, no doubt we won't know until Wednesday. Aaron is just like the Elimo comparison, just depends on the content. Aaron is nice because he gives an instant BB gauge boost, but his defense buff is pretty weak. If you are fighting content that requires a good def boost, Aaron won't cut it. Edea is nice with her status inflict and has added utility with her extra skill that adds status clear on her BB/SBB. She is probably a bit more generally useful than Aaron."
bravefrontier,3dxs29,PrismoBF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, would you suggest using her on Maxwell?  And Wednesday is a long time for me now, that suspense is killing me, haha"

bravefrontier,3dxs29,Rilak_kuma,0,Mon Jul 20 13:58:25 2015 UTC,"No it isn't.  Again, you just don't like how it works."
bravefrontier,3dxs29,HeroponKoe,2,Mon Jul 20 15:02:09 2015 UTC,"There is one bug with the shield, the last time I tested: Guarding doesn't function on shielded units.  This was after the latest client update, so it hasn't changed since then, but hopefully the 1.3.4 update on the 22nd will fix it."
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Xerte,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:42 2015 UTC,"is 'bleeding damage' from the shield intended? as in, the unit takes damage that was calculated by the shield DEF?"
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Heer0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:10 2015 UTC,"It's a natural result of the game's core programming (damage is pre-calculated except for spark modifiers and cannot otherwise change once the attack has begun), and would require Gumi to intentionally code a new system to make damage calculate per hit or recalculate the remaining damage when the shield breaks instead if they wanted to make the shield DEF not carry over to remaining hits.  The fact that no such system exists means that they chose not to implement it. It's arguably an intentional weakness in the shield.  Though when the shield first became available, attacks just stopped dealing damage when it broke, which at the time was intentional as well (it was designed that way to be the mechanic players used to survive a couple unique bosses in Trial of the Gods). That was OP - it would've allowed us to, for example, tank Zevalhua's 500% HP damage attack without any other buffs - so it got nerfed to its current state.  Well, actually, it got nerfed a little further, then rebuffed - mitigation and guarding stopped working when you had a shield up, but now it's just guarding that doesn't work, and it's the only thing that needs to be fixed. I can live with the DEF and elemental damage bleed over."
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Xerte,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:22:15 2015 UTC,I take it from the last sentence that every unit is treated as 'earth' type when the damage bleeds over.  Would it be possible for Gumi to implement a system that uses the unit DEF for the shield instead of a preset DEF?
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Heer0,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"It'd be plenty possible, but again, it's something they chose to do.  Unless you have some pretty incredible DEF boosts pushing your units to around 10k DEF, the DEF bleed over isn't actually that much of a problem. It takes a lot for it to actively harm your units - the element is a much bigger problem.  Anywho, Tridon 7* releases at the same time as version 1.3.4, which may mean functionality changes to the shield buff. I'm not going to rate him on it until we know how it works following the update."
bravefrontier,3dxs29,Xerte,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"I thought the bug is that you get wreck for the same element (Earth) even when the shield is completely depleted for that turn. That is how it is currently working.  How it should work is after the shield depleted, the rest of the damage to be calculated according to the unit's original element."

bravefrontier,3dxrg6,Draek97,2,Mon Jul 20 13:26:41 2015 UTC,"Eh why not? Yuri is a good name.     Russian and Ukrainian form of George. Although often associated with the Russian name, Yuri is also a Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, and Korean name as well. In Hebrew, Yuri or Uri means ""the light of God"". In Japanese, depending on the characters used to spell the name, it could also mean ""abundant ideals"". (Pronounced: YOO-ree), other possible combinations of characters include ""tenderness; superiority"" (yu) and ""reason; justice; truth"" (ri).     Also seems many JP player don't like typical name."
bravefrontier,3dxrg6,kanadde_v2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:18 2015 UTC,"Its just cause, well, in Japanese, to my knowledge that would mean lily flower, which I cant exactly picture the hero as..."
bravefrontier,3dxrg6,Draek97,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:05 2015 UTC,"Eh I know that Yuri is also means 'lily flower' with different kanji than 'abundant ideals' one. It's almost like when girl says 'chin chin' near a dog which actually means 'beg' but if you know the 'other word' then you'll feel awkward.  Japan got too many words with similar reading but diferent meaning, so we have to expand our knowledge (or just ignore the meaning and just let them be without meaning since it's in Katakana form). Or do you still prefer his name become ユウシャ？"

No.  They do not work as burst frogs for the unit that needs them for evolution. Cyclaw would work as a burst frog for Cyclaw. Hydraloid for Hydraloid. Stormwing for Stormwing. And so on.  If it does in fact work as a burst frog. Then GG Gimu you done fucked up. It shouldn't though, I'm pretty sure I've fused my excess Hydraloids into my Tridon with no BB ups at all."

bravefrontier,3dzcwy,Overlander1954,6,Tue Jul 21 02:34:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's really not a big deal to keep 1 of every possible evo-unit on the back-log in case you pull an SBS.

bravefrontier,3dzcwy,Feregrin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"I would do that, honestly. But I'm short on space as a f2p. Sitting at 120 space.

bravefrontier,3dzcwy,CBSU,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:46 2015 UTC,"Even as f2p you should spend more gems on unit space, imo. You never know if 5 gems will equal a good unit, but on the flip side that's 25 more units you can keep around permanently."
bravefrontier,3dzcwy,Overlander1954,3,Mon Jul 20 21:00:06 2015 UTC,I have 555 unit spaces F2P and it's been significantly better than most of my summons.

bravefrontier,3dzcwy,JeremyBF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:48 2015 UTC,I think someone suggested making it a vortex key gate back when 7* SBS was first being talked about. This would allow better drop rates as well. When they do a SBS summon rate ups they can just give everyone a key.
bravefrontier,3dzcwy,top_kench,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:41:10 2015 UTC,"I rather farm them in vortex. Putting SBS materials in AS, I don't think its going to work. Mainly because their materials for ''specific'' or even one could say ''strict'' units as compared to other materials in AS, those are ''universal'' and apply to all units. If they do then I guess those who didn't obtain their materials from vortex now have to spend AS points to get them. But like I said, I don't think they'll do that or work."
bravefrontier,3dzcwy,top_kench,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:11:58 2015 UTC,"didnt they add a new thing a while ago, a new dungeon image, of all the SBS evo mats in one dungeon? meaning it might have it's own special spot, like how the GGC are handled?"
bravefrontier,3dzcwy,Alsinus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm, or they could just take us to Athenosphere being its own quest map with these guys as the bosses for each region, flesh out the story already in place and BE YOUR OWN MAN FOR ONCE GLOBAL!"
bravefrontier,3dzcwy,fAEth_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:20:21 2015 UTC,I want Gumi to just run through dungeons like this and Fei's(along with other vortex units) monthly.
bravefrontier,3dzcwy,Roketsu86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:24:01 2015 UTC,Didn't we already download an SBS banner? That suggests they will eventually be a permanent thing like GGC (like they should have been all along).

bravefrontier,3dyo6f,Keldy123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:35:52 2015 UTC,Idea and premise is good; haven't seen a fic take on this scene.   Execution was a little lack-luster.  Follow grammar and spelling rules(please space paragraphs when someone starts talking).   Also Alice was never consumed by a demonic force(THE SOULS OF DARKNESSSS 3SPOOKY5ME) she was mentally broken(way past the point of someone calling out to her would make her sane again.)  Just my two cents.

bravefrontier,3dymep,Katsuaki,3,Mon Jul 20 16:26:43 2015 UTC,"I did it with Rowgen and Lin, though once Lin died instantly and he survived.  He really makes it faster."
bravefrontier,3dymep,CBSU,2,Mon Jul 20 16:34:58 2015 UTC,I did the first one with Exhvel and Rowgen then I heard this method was easier. I'll just redo the whole thing then with them.
bravefrontier,3dymep,DarthHaul,3,Mon Jul 20 16:47:58 2015 UTC,"I ran Exhvel and Rowgen for each branch successfully, no other team combo really worked for me.

bravefrontier,3dymep,CBSU,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"It's not.  Rowgen maintains large amounts of damage, heals himself instantly, while Lin heals every turn (even if only slightly when she is dead).

bravefrontier,3dymep,cmc_serith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:12:25 2015 UTC,Not sure where you have the issue there.  I had it happen a couple times maybe but after three full runs for 100% it wasn't a big issue for me at all; as long as she was guarding she was fine.  Personally I used Aurelia lead + Rowgen sub and ran it 3 times.  As long as I could keep Seria's hp full (doable easily with Aurelia's regen) she wasn't really in danger.

Griel with Virtue + Urias  Lucana with Lexida  Urias is super key because it allows Griel to SBB every 2-3 turns, which is the only time the final boss takes any lasting damage. Lexida is also super helpful for producing much needed BC drops. It's still a grind, but you don't fail (always always guard the two NPCs). It takes 20-30 minutes per run."

Anything else is just extra although I really do hope they make his ATK buff last at least for 2 turns so I can stop swiping him first every turn. A 2 turn taunt would open up a lot of possibilities for taunt guarding.  As for Tridon, I can't seem to hype up about him cuz Global will sooner or later get the additive→multiplicative mitigation stacking nerf (50% BB mitigation + 10% LS mitigation = 55% mitigation). Also his shield seems situational since it does more bad than good in some cases where you need that DEF to survive (Hopefully the 7* version will have it incude the unit's DEF in the formula).  Edit: Also Frontier Gate is coming out on the same day. Nirvana + Ultor combo is OP, maybe add in a fallacy orb? xD"

I can't believe I found this out on /r/bravefrontier of all places."
bravefrontier,3dwpgn,protomayne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, apparently they didn't do a good job advertising what it actually is? One of my friends didn't know either. I figured it was pretty common knowledge at this point.  Anyway, in case anyone else is wondering... Win7 & Win8 users get a free upgrade to Win10 if they upgrade within two years (using their old product keys to register). If they wait until after that, they'll have to pay full price.  A lot of people thought it was like a two-year trial or something or just straight up didn't know about it."
bravefrontier,3dwpgn,iDerpTooMuchx3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:47:52 2015 UTC,None of my units die but that's mainly because of Elimos 140% DEF buff.  Only one comes close and that's Rize but she's fine always.  I'm mainly running one HP lead and that's Griel and have a Raaga friend.
bravefrontier,3dwpgn,lordoftheaxes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:22:08 2015 UTC,Maybe it's a good thing im too lazy to try to get BF to work with non-emulated version

bravefrontier,3dwpgn,protomayne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:30:46 2015 UTC,Would this be why I'm getting completely fucking smashed on the Michelle GGC?  Like I've tried every combination of every relevant unit I have and even copied multiple teams of other people who had success and I'm getting demolished.   I was pretty close using my phone (and a weaker team...) last week so this would explain a lot.

bravefrontier,3dwpgn,Garconcl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:11:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's the intended damage, I remember people saying that Rc3 needed mitigation and Def, then that RC4 needed HP leads and that RC5 was hell. I used a Raaga/Quaid lead to clear from RC3 to Rc5 in windows version and I didn't have any problems until like half Rc4 quests where damage just sky rocket and I was forced to use Colt leads.   Now on Trial 006, it's definately harder on windows version, in android I could survive Zurg's part easily, on windows I can barely survive the first wave lol."
bravefrontier,3dwpgn,woiester,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:36:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's intended.  If you see JP players do RC5, they only revive one or twice. Something is glitchy with the Windows version, which is understandable, since the game just launched."
bravefrontier,3dwpgn,TheVainestsafe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:26 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if this is isolated to being a Windows BF issue. I've been having the same issue on mobile.

bravefrontier,3dx6fv,alphakennyone123,2,Mon Jul 20 10:47:52 2015 UTC,When it's available there's a temporary raid that gives a lot of medals.  On RC4 it was giving me between 27-32 medals solo.
bravefrontier,3dx6fv,Schwertkreuz,3,Mon Jul 20 11:31:41 2015 UTC,"It's a limited time special raid quest where you fight a light element boss and you get a lot of medals for the slots, there are 2 main ways to kill him easily, double Kira dark team or with poison."
bravefrontier,3dx6fv,Mabangyan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:31:44 2015 UTC,"Wait, is the rush suppose to be hard? I just used my 7*s Griel as lead then Atro, Magress, Sefia, and Aaron.

bravefrontier,3dx6fv,Mabangyan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"When I went mono Dark with double Kira, I'd usually lose Semira or Ardin. But Feeva, KKR, and Afla Dillith would finish the fight pretty quickly (4 turns max). With 3 atk down units, it almost always procced so no need for a mitigator.   I could see it being problematic if you tried mono dark, no kira/maxwell, no atk down, and no poison/weak w/o a mitigator. And this is at RC4. Any decent 6 star squad can clear RC3 Medal Rush."
bravefrontier,3dx6fv,Selphii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:50:48 2015 UTC,"It's not that it's difficult it's that the boss has a ridiculous amount of HP, so the only ways to quickly clear it are poison (10% hp per tick ezpz) or massive crit/elemental weakness (Kira teams)."

I used Oboro + Tora (Oboro could easily die with his elements/stats) and Hadaron/Nalmika on my other phone. I had no problem getting 29-32 Medals on each run—well worth it for those who don't have Kira.   At least Medal Rush was really easy to solo/duo."

bravefrontier,3dx6fv,Karma_Turret,3,Mon Jul 20 11:09:32 2015 UTC,Equipping Melchio's white armor or Edea's GGC sphere would probably be helpful for that. Or maybe even Karl's EX sphere.
bravefrontier,3dx6fv,Floire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:37:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't spare a sphere frog on him since he doesn't have confirmed 7*, so i'll just equip him with white armor and see if he can survive"

bravefrontier,3dx6fv,rugalck,2,Mon Jul 20 09:24:10 2015 UTC,"Not quite. If a unit has 45% more HP, it still has the base DEF (which in the end, is the one that makes you take less damage)."
bravefrontier,3dx6fv,xsilr,0,Mon Jul 20 11:29:55 2015 UTC,Yes that would work fine with mitigation

bravefrontier,3dx6fv,lordoftheaxes,2,Mon Jul 20 18:10:12 2015 UTC,Just a reminder that it's better to use Double Kira or Kira + Maxwell instead of using poison and being cucked by people with stronger leads
bravefrontier,3dx6fv,Heer0,-4,Mon Jul 20 16:40:37 2015 UTC,nah fam just let poisonfags enter kira rooms and whine about not getting medals...because the boss is already dead by the time they process the quest data.

bravefrontier,3e281m,PuddingJello,5,Tue Jul 21 14:15:51 2015 UTC,With 7* units it's indeed easy. You just have to be carefully reducing Vanilla's HP along with Serin's HP so both of them won't nuke you with unsurvivable 150% + 150% HP attacks at the same time.

bravefrontier,3e281m,fAEth_,-4,Tue Jul 21 19:09:05 2015 UTC,well basically the item usage was needed after i accidentally bombed vanille under 50%. i used the fujins every once in a wile cause i thought why not sbb with qiid right now...  and considering that i had a really hard time with a full 7* team on trial 4 and x1 with 50+ trys each i am more than happy that i made this trial on first attempt with a random squad and without even looking into a guide or asking people thousands of times with squads. considering these facts it is a quite big achievement to me personally and this is what this post is all about.  i am sorry if you only hate and dont grant me this personal success.  also the small things in life make the difference ;)

bravefrontier,3dx9dz,XIV-Questions,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:09 2015 UTC,"Anima: Great b/c anima is just super good, though Ultor does have v low rec, would need imping.  Breaker: Huge base attack and massive attack buff makes him an insane sweeper  Guardian: Great with his absurd self-targeted defence buff + taunt to let him soak up hits.  All three types have their perks, but with the guardian buff coming I'd say guardian is at least his second best type, overtaking anima in any situation where you struggle to heal to full health every turn"
bravefrontier,3dx9dz,Sethowar,2,Tue Jul 21 05:37:34 2015 UTC,Yeah. Mixes well with his Taunt mechanic and tank role.  Of course. That's the only way to evolve him to 6* anyway.
bravefrontier,3dx9dz,SefiaUmi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:17:49 2015 UTC,Oh I understand. In order to make him 6 star I must find a cyclaw? I have finished the first two cyclaw dungeons. No drop. Not sure I can complete the third. Is the drop rate better as you go up or does he only drop from the last one?  Can I get cyclaw from any of them?
bravefrontier,3dx9dz,XIV-Questions,2,Tue Jul 21 05:39:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. You first evolve the Cyclaw into Turbo Cyclaw, then use it as material to evolve 5* Ultor to 6*.  Generally, as the Dungeon Level goes up, the drop rate increases. You can still get him from lower levels, but at lower rates."
bravefrontier,3dx9dz,SefiaUmi,2,Tue Jul 21 05:43:17 2015 UTC,"He has such high attack that guardian isn't a bad type for him, keep him, evolve him into 7*, most likely typing won't even matter, but either way with the new guardian revamp (yet to come to Global, implemented in JP) guardian is a great typing"

bravefrontier,3dz29f,psytrac77,3,Mon Jul 20 19:48:14 2015 UTC,"Much ado about nothing. Quaid lead here with 633+ streak (busted when i used my status infliction team on arena by accident) but could go back to ultor and find no difference. The thing woth quaid is that he himself is just an insane unit, especially with spirit tiara that makes him really difficult to kill in the first round and with his multi element bb/sbb, will kill pretty much everything afterwards, esp if he is at 51% hp or above.   Lugina will be a better choice if you want a shot at defensive wins. But not sure if that will help much; my experience was that offense oriented leaders were more dangerous as i cant do anything about my units all hitting different units and not killing anyone (happens with bad elemental matchups across the board)."
bravefrontier,3dz29f,_waltersobchak,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"I prefer Quaid because he grants more flexibility on his ls, even with empty gauge you do not need any bc support at all to fill.  No need for any drop spheres which lets you either add additional offense like Death Axe or status coverage.  He is also better able to cover the no sphere effects random rule as well.  Lugina is likely better for non-threatening scenarios like standard arena and atk parameter halved but they aren't a concern to begin with."
bravefrontier,3dz29f,Anfini,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:47 2015 UTC,"That's a good point with the spheres!  I haven't really played around with secondary-attack spheres, but being able to put a few extra status-null spheres would be nice.  Though, just of note, Lugina's LS still ensures that, at minimum, I get 5 BB gauges filled on turn 2 even with no spheres.  I only say this based on the four or five times it's happened since I switched in Lugi but...so far his LS is still good enough for BB management even with no spheres/empty BB gauges."
bravefrontier,3dz29f,akaieevee,2,Mon Jul 20 18:52:05 2015 UTC,"Personally, I prefer some survivability for my units over BB gauge boost considering the match is decided on the turn. What's the most important factor for the win is how many units on your team is left standing after getting attacked so that the odds of one of them landing a BB/SBB to end the match. I don't think you really need SBB to win.   That's why I'd rather use Lugina and place him at the bottom because those units rarely land their BB anyway. The rare problem I had with Quaid lead is when RNG gets bad and my units kept attacking dead units instead of ones that are still alive on the first round. It almost always comes back to get me with the enemy team killing two or three of my units in return. Granted you can still win, but the odds gets lower when it happens. This is why I think survivability is more stable to win in arena than BB boost."
bravefrontier,3dz29f,Trisagion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:57:14 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much my mentality.

bravefrontier,3dz29f,psytrac77,2,Mon Jul 20 20:21:00 2015 UTC,Never used lugina for arena lead yet because i always use quaid team  (currently at 850+ win streak).  Survivability is not a problem at all for me because i usually ends up killing 2 - 4 enemy units on the first turn.  My concerns with lugina lead are the bc production when you got empty bb gauge or no sphere effect random rule since his ls provides no bc boost at all and his SBB is single target. Could be fatal sometimes IMO.
bravefrontier,3dz29f,magogi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:06 2015 UTC,"His LS reduces the BB required for BB gauges.  Definitely not as potent as Quaid, but I've yet to have less than 5 full BBs.  I keep him at BB9 due to his STSBB.  Not that big a deal.  Nice streak!"

I see people saying that no sphere effects or empty bb gauge start could screw Lugina over, but for me they don't. The only BB gauge sphere I'm using is Shiny Anklet and Virtue Stone on one of my Selenas (My other Selena has Lexida and Star of Hope). I'm using Demon Sickle and Geldnite Axe as sub spheres for other units for more damage and I can get 2-4 kills on the first turn and still get SBB on normal arena matches. Empty gauge and no sphere effects only gets me five BB's but it's enough. My only regret is I got Lugina to SBB 10 without realizing he had a single target SBB -_-"

With a Quaid lead, selena and atro (starters have good drop checks) the other two slots just have to be decent to win all fights (ai must be considered as well as st/mt bb).

It also didn't help that all of my units targeted the same opponent in the first round. It was sad. Wish it was just a little less random."

bravefrontier,3dz29f,Itchyy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"I think it is all pretty moot at this point anyway since even with Zurg lead I rarely lost at all in the past. I run Quaid now and it is nearly impossible for me to lose. I imagine Lugina is the same way, or Ultor, or Zergel, or any mono-colored team with 100% ATK leads.  Going 1st is such a huge advantage that it probably doesn't matter much who you use at this point. Even if you lose it will be maybe once in hundreds of matches.  With Zurg then Quaid I got up to 1000 win streak, and I don't even remember why I lost when it happened. Even now I'm back up to 143 win streak. Overall I'm 4,892W - 206L, ~96% win rate.  I don't avoid any leaders and just play whoever, except when the daily makes me look for specific elements. And keep random on at all times."
bravefrontier,3dz29f,grandygon,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"Lets put it this way. The only thing that is ever an issue in arena is the no BB rule (say what you like about empty bb gauge and no sphere effects, but with a decent team composition it should be no problem and status rarely effects enough units to be an issue). In a No BB situation you want to be able to deal as much damage as possible. Being able to take hits is less important, because dead units can't attack (who'd have though). Lugina is less useful in my opinion because in those situations his LS becomes useless near the start, whereas Quaid stays strong. That is the only real difference I can find (even have same chance of BB in ideal conditions AND DC) and it only makes a slight difference, so really there is not much room for debate in it.  Edit: and I didn't mention not BBing when they should because in < 300 matches it hasn't happened to me so I kinda forgot about it."
bravefrontier,3dz29f,PMmeYourEyewear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"All of my witnessed arena losses since the random-rule effect came about were a result of my units failing to bb on turn two despite full gauges, despite preferable arena AI, and then getting wiped by the enemy bb.  These were usually accompanied with a unit or two of mine dead, reducing my chance to BB. Since I put in Lugina I've never had more than one unit dead by turn 2, and I'm dealing much greater damage than when I was running Grah.  Lugina's LS is only invalid on turn 3, and I've yet to get to turn 3 with more than two enemy units remaining, while all 5 of mine remained.  With the ES's of my units all activated, it was hardly an issue cleaning up after the fact.  You're right, there really isn't that much a difference, I'm just curious what people think.  Thanks!"
bravefrontier,3dz29f,grandygon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:45:49 2015 UTC,I find the only time I lose in arena is when my units don't BB when they can BB and the enemy just BBs me on their second turn.

bravefrontier,3dz29f,PMmeYourEyewear,2,Tue Jul 21 02:30:32 2015 UTC,I'm currently rank 315 at arena (Celestial God) or could be higher... Arena is currently bugged it's showing that I'm rank 0... At my current rank I've only seen 3 people use Lugina lead... Most people still prefer Quaid... I personally ran a Quaid team for arena...  Quaid - Sky Harbringer + Fallacy Orb  Atro - Urias + Refined Gem  Magress - Leomurg + Refined Gem  Vargas - Dandelga + Twinkle Gem  Selena - Lexida + Star of Hope  My personal best arena streak is 965 or something that was broken because there was a day when system was glitchy and didn't register that I switched spheres... Running into Lugina Leads is no different from running into an Ultor lead the +100% defense is not noticeable... With Quaid Lead it helps me adjust to any Random arena rule like no BB...

bravefrontier,3dz29f,Trisagion,2,Tue Jul 21 05:57:09 2015 UTC,"As someone who has beat down a few Lugina leads recently, not really. The 100% DEF seems like it would be great but honestly, it doesn't make a huge difference. You still win mostly by using BB's on Turn 2 and Quaid's Multi-Element BB and Elemental-Buff SBB are far superior to what Lugina has to offer.   They're both great Arena leads but Quaid is so vastly superior as an Arena unit that I feel it outweigh's Lugina's LS having a nice DEF buff. I still have no problem taking out at least 2 units on Turn 1 against Lugina leads so that 100% DEF isn't doing enough. And the only way to use Lugina is at BB9 because his SBB won't do jack for you and you can't risk bringing units with bad drop checks because the Empty BB Gauge random rule will destroy you."
bravefrontier,3dz29f,VoidWrighter,2,Mon Jul 20 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"I don't really mean from the perspective of an enemy lead, just your own.  It's...kinda silly testing a leader skill through opponents.  By your logic, Quaid is an inferior arena lead because I tend to one-shot units on their squads.  5 units with an atk LS will obviously be able to kill off two or three opponents no matter their LS.  It still takes two or three units with an atk LS to kill any one of my units with a Lugi-lead, and when there are only two or three units left...well...I'm just saying that the wrath of RNGesus has yet to be as unusually kind.  With Lugina's LS, turn 2 BB is still the enemy killer, but you've got a better chance of all 5 of your units surviving with the added survivability.  I rarely have any of my units die in arena compared to when I was using an attack lead, the def buff is working fairly well on offense.  As for the BB9 thing, it is a little silly keeping him there forever, but he has still one-shot any opponent except for HP boosted fire units (sometimes), and it's not like I'd be using him for his SBB when I have a max-imped breaker Tazer.  It's the same reason I have a dual-sphered Breaker Len at BB9.  As for the empty BBgauge rule thing, Lugina 'does' have a very nice BB skill attached to his LS.  Claire and Colt aren't exactly breaking the drop-check mold, and I still regularly get two or more SBBs going.  Having to choose units without 'bad drop checks' is less restricting than having to build a rainbow for Quaid.  I'm not saying that a rainbow team necessity is a negative for Quaid, I'm just saying that neither LS is all that restrictive in composition."
bravefrontier,3dz29f,wp2000,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"It's...kinda silly testing a leader skill through opponents.    How is the opponent's ability to withstand your first attack not a legitimate metric to assess their leader skill in the context of you taking your opponent's first attack?    With Lugina's LS, turn 2 BB is still the enemy killer, but you've got a better chance of all 5 of your units surviving with the added survivability.   Not much better, that's  my point.  The 100% DEF doesn't suddenly make it so that  none of your units die. I have a pure 7* Arena team and generally if someone dies it's because they got focused by 2 units or took a strong element—100% DEF or even 30% HP doesn't protect you from those two scenarios most of the time.   Really it doesn't matter that much because the Arena doesn't require much skill in Global (allegedly it does in Japan, I'll have to take others' word on it).  The mono HP/ATK Leads are great because they combine survivability and turn 1 Damage and take the ""No Brave Burst"" rule with stride but are very susceptible to the ""Empty BB Gauge Start"" rules and don't benefit from 5/6 Elemental Advantage rules.   The Mono ATK/Ares Leaders are the opposite: they fall completely flat during the ""No Brave Burst"" rule but have no problem with the ""Empty BB Gauge Start"" rule. Otherwise they're the same.   Quaid basically behaves like the Mono ATK/Ares Leader except Quaid Teams always benefit very slightly from 5/6 Elemental Buff rules so he has a potential advantage.   Lugina does offer the best attributes of these, being able to deal with all of the mentioned rules potentially but just in a less potent way. I can definitely see the appeal; his DEF boost makes the ""No Brave Burst"" rule easier to chew on and his BB Cost reduction lessens the sting of ""Empty BB Gauge Start"". However Lugina's primary weakness is actually the ""No Leader Skills"" rule, because he's basically dead weight without his LS whereas the other leaders are perfectly capable Arena units in their own rights with 7* stats, great drop checks and powerful BB/SBB moves.   So everyone has their ""thing"" that makes them unique but they're all just fine. I like the popularity of Quaid because you can safely go against him with a Mono Dark/Light team and not have to worry about possibly getting an Element Buff rule that doesn't work in your favor (I never go against other Mono teams with my Kikuri arena team except Dark, on the off chance their rule comes up)."

bravefrontier,3dvy2p,iXanier,4,Mon Jul 20 01:42:50 2015 UTC,It's actually easy. I've only gotten rekt cuz of her spamming Blighted Harvest and my lack of DEF buffer.
bravefrontier,3dvy2p,Shikuro,2,Mon Jul 20 02:06:28 2015 UTC,Same. I got rekt because I failed to have enough damage and not timing killing Fei and the shield expiry right.

bravefrontier,3e09kt,ToFurkie,7,Mon Jul 20 23:30:39 2015 UTC,"They purposely lowered DEF, because players did not want ATK lowered (it's why guardian now lowers REC instead of ATK), since the actual stat ends up being more important than the sphere'd one, when calculating dmg.   Losing like 300 def is nothing."
bravefrontier,3e09kt,mellyoz,3,Mon Jul 20 23:35:04 2015 UTC,You actually only lose around 100 defense for 350 recovery.
bravefrontier,3e09kt,Ale_Matest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:20:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, really?   Then even more reasons not to hate the change~"
bravefrontier,3e09kt,mellyoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:13 2015 UTC,Yep. And guardian gains 240 defense for 240 recovery deduction which is 100 rec more than anima.
bravefrontier,3e09kt,Ale_Matest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:29:02 2015 UTC,"It's usually the case that people don't want to lose out on damage. I still would rather have 300 DEF on a healer should they roll Oracle. At this point, I feel defeated whenever I get an Oracle no matter what unit it is. At least with this, I can feel okay should a healer get it"
bravefrontier,3e09kt,mellyoz,7,Mon Jul 20 23:40:01 2015 UTC,"Frankly, if your units are getting killed because they have 300 less defense, you lack: buffs and good spheres.   300 less def barely matters, with the current available buffs."
bravefrontier,3e09kt,Nesyaj0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:42:20 2015 UTC,"I was going to agree with the lower atk suggestion, but considering I recently pulled an Oracle Alpha I'm okay with what it is now.  Also some of my best units are Guardians and changing it so they lose REC instead is a fair change as well, I don't think my first Lily Matah or Fei and Fang will care all that much. Rowgen will be thrilled too."
bravefrontier,3e09kt,Greenman284,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:03:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, I would almost be just as angry if I was losing attack instead of HP on Oracle's.  It's why I actually prefer Lord over Guardian for most units pre-change."

bravefrontier,3e09kt,RikkaJPBF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:57:07 2015 UTC,"If you change this just to benefit healers. What about attacking units? Like others said, 300 def lost is nothing."

bravefrontier,3e09kt,bfghost,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:40 2015 UTC,Alim's change to Oracle is already reasonable IMO. This is coming from a guy with max imped Oracle versions of Quaid and Lava.. in Global.

bravefrontier,3e09kt,iBakeMuffins,-2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:13 2015 UTC,Anima is better for all. That's not really what I'm highlighting. Oracle benefits healers most but the Oracle typing is still undesirable because survivability is still lost.

bravefrontier,3e09kt,Azalen,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:11:31 2015 UTC,It's simple anima wins all cuz alim/Gumi are too lazy to nerf HP. And since healing dedication is not a thing (except elimo) ppl won't agree to losing att because I'd ur bb/sbb doesn't have dmg it's a shit unit in many ppl opinion.

bravefrontier,3e0630,saggyfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:20:10 2015 UTC,Could this be the highest arena damage in game yet?
bravefrontier,3e0630,akaieevee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:59 2015 UTC,Probably Crit/Spark with Mifune and I'm guessing at least Kuda and Kikuri fired off their SBB's.   Kikuri and Kuda can massively spark off each other with the right timing and they both have pretty slow animations.   In fact all of your units except Mifune have pretty slow animations so actually ... I would almost assume that Mifune wasn't even involved because I'd think his BB/SBB would kill the enemies instantly and prevent Feeva/Selena from going off. You may have just hit the perfect timing with everyone but Mifune because they all have a bit of a delay.

It is a shame that it isn't coming back, that sphere is super useful and it sucks that newer players won't be able to get it  X&E should get 6☆ forms, and make them somewhat valueable. Their characters are pretty cool, I think they should be reintroduced"
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,SeeZee21,4,Mon Jul 20 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"What I liked about TotG during it's initial release was the amount of discussion by the people here over its exact mechanics. Unlike other dungeons from JP, this was new for everyone playing Global and no one knew what to expect. The amount of team building tips during the first few days while everyone was figuring strategies was pretty awesome :D"
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,Traxgen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. It was more fun to figure out than the current enemy skillset of BB drain and LS lock...qhich literally takes 2/3 of the game out of the fight.   I hate both of those mechanics. We pull units for their LS and (S)BB...so Gumi makes it so we don't really get to use either.
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,SeeZee21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"I don't mind Alim / Gumi giving us mechanics like that as long as we have the means to mitigate it. At least for bb drain we have bc on hit, which works well on things like trial X2, for instance.   As for ls lock... Yeah, gotta agree with you on that one. They took out half the fun of squad building all in the name of making challenging content for the player. I think making ls lock a debuff that can be cleansed to be too trivial; Perhaps give our units an innate resistance to ls lock?"
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,Traxgen,2,Mon Jul 20 23:54:03 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily an innate resistance, just make the LS lock expire. None of the 999 turn bullshit. 2 or 3 turns is challenging, 999 turns is literally 1/3 if the game put of the window. Or change the way the lock functions. Something like, when the lock is in effect passive abilities don't go away (HP boosts, fill rates etc) but event based part (BC on hit, damage buffs and so fourth) don't work while the lock is in effect.   There are lots of ways to make it fair, but they are generally too complex to expect from Gumi."
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,SeeZee21,3,Tue Jul 21 00:43:25 2015 UTC,"It was fun in its gimmicks.  Instead of the same crit team/BB spam/mitigate every turn meta it relied on the player figuring out what each enemy did (or reading a Reddit post). It'd probably be really easy now, though."
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,CBSU,2,Mon Jul 20 14:27:39 2015 UTC,"ToTG I believe is done forever now, or at least they aren't making new trials. I'm not sure if they ever plan on re releasing, but I highly doubt it. Xenon and Estia are probably done for a while too, I think they might have been reopened when their X1 trial was released? (I think, don't hold me on it though).   I think at this point they won't be re released due to them not having a direct benefit for Gumi, as they won't have a great sales increase now with 7*s for ToTG, and Xenon and Estia aren't meta in any way shape or form."
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,Wailordfan,2,Mon Jul 20 13:40:43 2015 UTC,"ToTG I believe is done forever now, or at least they aren't making new trials.   Yeah I remember having this declared in a Twitch session earlier this year. Good thing I got the Ishr's when they've decided to open the dungeon again."

bravefrontier,3dxsz7,saggyfire,0,Mon Jul 20 18:32:10 2015 UTC,I never said it wasnt useful. Just that there are better options.
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,ATC007,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:08 2015 UTC,"What? TotG reward gave Ihsir's Guise, a BB sphere that also boosted stats. There's only a handful of those, it is the meta."
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,GMNightmare,0,Mon Jul 20 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Ihsirs guise is ouclassed by all of them"
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,ATC007,0,Mon Jul 20 15:15:24 2015 UTC,"Since my team is not made up of one unit, that's not an issue, even if it was true."
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,GMNightmare,0,Mon Jul 20 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"There are two spheres currently available. 4 eventually.  You dont want them for all your sub spheres depending on the situation. And once we get eriole and karl ex, ishers guise will be even worse. It's fine early game, but late game it's a pretty mediocre  sphere. Especially when all the different options are considered"
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,ATC007,2,Mon Jul 20 17:50:57 2015 UTC,"I have a team greater than two. I also have a team greater than four. In fact, I might even have multiple teams if I so wish.  I'll decide when I want to use them, thank you very much. Ishir's Guise is great late game. You're not even correct, Karl Ex sphere doesn't outclass it, they play different roles as it doesn't touch bb.  Furthermore, you're in lategame if you're even doing Karl Ex type missions. Your comment is once you beat lategame, content that hasn't even come out, that a sphere is outclassed thus it's not worthwhile is ludicrous on its face. Early game apparently to you is 99.9% of the game.  But you're even wrong at that. Even after getting spheres that haven't been released yet, Ihsir's Guise can still easily find a role on lategame teams without any trouble at all. And why wouldn't it? It's a marvelous secondary sphere is a space where the competition is low. Being not the best doesn't mean it's worthless."
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,GMNightmare,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"I play BOTH JP and Global and in JP, I have beaten all the major content there ( outside of the last map which is just autobattling ). JP has so many better sphere options that Ishers guise wouldnt even have a place if it was there.  Am I saying it's a bad sphere? No! It's fine. But if you play Jp, which I doubt you do, you'll know there are better options. Depending on what youre fighting, you can use the RC5 sphere, Celgrads, 4 different EX sphere, GGC sphere, Loch's GQ sphere, soon Vermillions will be getting a type change which makes them even better, FG spheres, and even more that are craftable for Raid.  My pont is, the sphere is fine, but it loses luster when you have so many better spheres at your disposal. Even if it was in JP, I wouldnt use it because I have so many better options."
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,ATC007,0,Mon Jul 20 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"Depending on what youre fighting   I get it. You don't know what's happening here. Ishir's Guise STACKS with other stat increasing spheres.  So when you say, you can use a GGC sphere... well, if that GGC sphere is a stat sphere, you can use both!  Celgrads don't even increase stats. Sure, they're nice, they don't outclass Ishir's Guise in even the slightest. The same deal with raid craftables. Ishir's Guise gives stats and bb benefits, if you don't have something directly doing both better, and at least 5 different ones, there is absolutely no room for you to claim it's worthless.  ""But I can use others!"" I never said you couldn't. Doesn't mean diddly.  At best, at best, you're saying something is worthless based upon content not even released in global. Which is insane. You don't apparently know what you're talking about. And I don't even know why you are so crazed about this, either."
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,GMNightmare,0,Mon Jul 20 20:12:15 2015 UTC,"I know that Ishers stacks but I still wouldnt use it. My team can be 4 15% spheres that ALSO STACK and the last spot can be the 10bc sphere on my mitigator. Exactly where would I put Ishers? You could make the argument of multiple squads, but honestly, the only content where multiple squads are required is Gq, and honestly, usually only one good team is required. Even in Grah's GQ, Besti can solo 3 of the 4 bosses need to progress to the final one. You say it's based on content global doesnt have yet, but do understand it will come eventually.    And I dont even know why you are so crazed about this, either.   FYI, you started the argument. Im just stating the facts. You dont agree? That's absolutely fine, and I respect your opinion, but I can't say I agree."
bravefrontier,3dxsz7,ATC007,0,Mon Jul 20 20:18:45 2015 UTC,"My team can be 4 15%   My team is bigger than 4.  Also, again, just like Karl Ex sphere, if it doesn't also focus on bb then it's not outclassed.  By the way, if I have multiple teams setup for different things, say, an arena team, and don't want to swap spheres every single time I switch activities then...   Im just stating the facts   The part where it becomes apparent you don't know what you're talking about, is that you think your subjective opinion is a fact.  Even more, that you pretend content unreleased makes something worthless.  Even further, that you think spheres pretty much at the very, very end of the game invalidate it. Like 99.9% of the game doesn't matter."

bravefrontier,3dzgn9,Marlon195,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:21 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it's Alim who is releasing old unit 7stars and not Gumi. The pic shows a Gumi employee HOPING for a 7star narza. Nothing is confirmed.

bravefrontier,3dus2m,Vega_IRon,11,Mon Jul 20 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think everyone in the thread understands what's been going on lately.   The new PC Frontier hype isn't about using emulators, but rather it's about the fact that Brave Frontier is available in the App Market for Windows and so you can natively play Brave Frontier on your computer without any need for an emulator.   It runs almost perfectly well with no lag and 60fps all the time, even when sparking (according to a lot of the people here). Furthermore, it'd feel nice to have your phone free and just have BF in the back in Windows doing its thing. It runs super fast and it looks and feels nice. That's what the allure is more or less.   I mean, obviously not everyone has their computer with them all the time, but it's extremely easy to switch between the two, so if you're out you can use your phone and once you get home you can start running it on your computer again."

bravefrontier,3dus2m,Ylvina,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think this meant bluestacks or any emulators, since recently its been said you can play on Windows 10 as is, without any emulators and all, just download from Microsoft app store or something."

In Windows 8.1 it will NOT play minimized and HAS to be in the foreground for it to run at all, while with Windows 10 you can apparently run it in the background.  When you go to install it it will say you don't have the hardware required, but it still runs fine without a touchscreen, though the menus can be a it touchy.  I tried with both bluestacks and 8.1 and I will say that with bluestacks you might as well play on a phone, while with 8.1 raids last about half as long, though there's a noticeable absence of music."

Elimo needs 16BC for her BB so only 6BC if using that sphere. If you have Dandelga +a Medina Leader there's your 6BC/turn right there (or Dandelga + Buff from almost any BC/Turn Buffer).   Elimo could very easily have guaranteed BB even if everyone else guards. It doesn't protect her against BB Gauge drain but it's pretty cool."

bravefrontier,3du28h,akaieevee,4,Sun Jul 19 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"I love Quaid's ES. It works amazingly well with Spirit Tiara, so he basically has at least a permanent 75% boost to his stats. Couple that with a Fallacy Orb and he becomes a monster"

bravefrontier,3du28h,Garconcl,-4,Sun Jul 19 14:04:54 2015 UTC,Just too OP IMO. I wish Alim nerf it to 40% or so. Makes it more balanced. After all it is an ES ._.  note: I have a Glyph too.
bravefrontier,3du28h,juubz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:56:43 2015 UTC,then why would you want it nerfed lol?
bravefrontier,3du28h,Maomiao,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as ""too op"" for glyph"
bravefrontier,3du28h,Gunnarguy,2,Sun Jul 19 17:13:51 2015 UTC,Selena originated the meta in ES.  Colt and Claire created the super stats meta with ES.
bravefrontier,3du28h,Mecopersona,2,Sun Jul 19 14:25:35 2015 UTC,"Any unit with ""Angel Idol"" buff in their ES, so currently Selena/Ivris. Moreso selena due to being amazing in the arena.   Others would be Melchio/Edea for clearing status, Elimo for reducing her BB cost (hello cheap heal + clear + mitigation BB), Potentially Kanon for preventing all status ever (except stat downs), and Glyph for his Crit buff.   Notable mentions are Will: Light buff to all units on his BB/SBB, which CAN be useful for certain quests, Altri for negating his elemental weakness, and... that's it really."
bravefrontier,3du28h,XBattousaiX,2,Sun Jul 19 16:00:31 2015 UTC,Elimo She can Spam BB for mitigate or heal and if you need def use the SBB (Gumi give me 1 anima elimo at the start of a new account :v )
bravefrontier,3du28h,Omegaforce1803,2,Sun Jul 19 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"Glyph, without it he is less than inspirational, with it he is absurd.  The ES is a reason a lot of those more recent units are so OP, instead of being dinky little sorta pointless things like a lot of the early 7*'s they become almost as good as some units SBBs"
bravefrontier,3du28h,Sethowar,4,Mon Jul 20 01:24:16 2015 UTC,"Selena, still the Lebron James of Arena Meta"

bravefrontier,3du28h,agent_87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:28:44 2015 UTC,Colt and claire was top tier if you had em both
bravefrontier,3du28h,xsilr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:56:28 2015 UTC,"I do like the combo. As dual Leaders you get 30% to all stats, increased Crit/Spark damage and Claire/Colt get +60%  to all stats, +90% if you slap a Malice on each one. Really it's an excellent combination but for newer stuff it only really works if you have every single BB generating buff in your team (specifically BB Fill on Hit and BC/turn) because the utter lack of BC Generation in their LS combo makes it hard to sustain against a single boss."
bravefrontier,3du28h,saggyfire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"well don't have to have claire/colt as leader; can only have one lead & it's less likely somebody is leading an ""ice blade""less sphere or whatever.  but yea I agree completely.

bravefrontier,3du28h,Simhacantus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:33:06 2015 UTC,"Elimo/Aaron (I feel biased about Aaron XD) making them primiere mitigators.  Edea due to her status clear, Slena due to her Angel Idol ES in Arena, Glyph/Griff due to the crit buff, Colt + Claire for ridiculous stats...there's a long list. ES is truly powerful."
bravefrontier,3du28h,mangoshakekouhai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:01:24 2015 UTC,"Elimo and Edea, even with lesser ESs, would still be in the meta as they are mitigators.  The ESs just make them even more OP.  But if you think about Dion, without his 100% boost to crit damage, he would have no place, or at best a tiny elemental niche, in the meta.  It is worth trying to slot him in a team because he's a legit nuker who offers the team added benefits (unlike, say, Alpha or Rize)."

bravefrontier,3du28h,TheMagicalCoffin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:12:43 2015 UTC,"Aaron's is amazing.   BC on hit for a mitigator that is also a BB battery is great.  In many cases, you don't need the bc on hit buff because he basically gives it to everyone.  Give him a demon core or other bc on hit sphere and even after most large BB drains he is ready to mitigate and recharge everyone else."
bravefrontier,3du28h,BFBooger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:54:01 2015 UTC,you should probably put 'aside from Selena' in your post's text.
bravefrontier,3du28h,jevans774,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:24:24 2015 UTC,Kanon's ES is 40% the reason why hes the best def buffer/debuff nullifier in the game  The rest is his actual def buff and heavilly defensive stats for hard content.

bravefrontier,3du30j,Supra_Mayro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"I dont think it is a bug. If you have a decent good computer. The game will run faster and smooth. With faster FPS and everyone using their brave burst without lag (ex. phone getting hot and/or not having enough memeory/processor)  it makes everyone's brave burst spark alot easier and alot more since there is alot more smooth, no lag game play.  So if you say you 2-3 turning a mob is because you are sparking alot more because the game is running better with alot better specs. If the game is not running smooth and lag free or is running worse than your phone, then that means your phone has better specs than your PC.   I do agree that it needs to fix sound and music. But over all i dont think the BC and HC is bugged but rather the game runs alot smooth and lag free so the chance of sparking goes up considerably which produces more HC and BC. I have no issues of crashing and playing WoW and the game at the same time. Just have to split the screen and good specs :P"

bravefrontier,3dtgms,mizucario,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:40:09 2015 UTC,"Final form Graham isn't too hard. Just remember to guard on the turn where he doesn't attack, because he's charging up to hit you with a buff removing AOE.  If you already get that far on your own, then you shouldn't have too much trouble beating him.  For Seria's GQ, if you happen to have the Thunder Vortex Arena reward unit, Cerise, or a 4* Lucana, they pair very well with a Griel leader. Otherwise, Tridon (leader) + Rowgen should do decently well (although I don't know if Tridon's shield will screw with certain attacks).  For Grah's GQ, you only really need one or two good teams. Selena (friend) can solo the Fire boss, Oguro (friend) with a HP recovery Sphere can solo the Thunder one."

If you are fighting a bc resist boss or one boss and you need bc, the attacking normaly with +2 will be your bet.     From ushi's computation, normal attack with this buff is stonger the sbb.  The negative side is you wont get the buff you need when you sbb and it only targets one enemy.    Don't get me wrong.  They are life savers. Most of the times make more damage than when i sbb my full team.   Just rember to put in buff first so hits are powerful.   Also don't forget to mitigate.

Ulkina &co who were killed by the six heroes in their 6* Zergel that was killed by his own weapon in his 6* form Rina & Luly who was killed by Farlon rampage(Grybe was also killed by Farlon but he also killed Farlon, meaning that he may have 7* to match Farlon 7*) Lucina that was killed by Ulkina to help Selena escape Sodis was killed by Alyut Duel gx who blew itself up because of failing its mission   Note that every rs unit can get their 7* because of the 7* jpbf voting"

bravefrontier,3dtgms,Etro_Script,2,Mon Jul 20 00:01:21 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Some bosses are crit resistant, and >60% crit buff can make a difference."
bravefrontier,3dv7bn,Raigeko13,2,Sun Jul 19 20:08:14 2015 UTC,Some of your item stacks have a negative value. You'll have to go through each stack and figure out which one(s) are negative and then gather enough materials to make them positive again. The stacks won't go away no matter how many times you sell them if they're at a negative value.

Ideally look for damage + BC help.  Or in Ultor's case, damage,damage, and some tankiness.  The less BC help your leader has, the more you'll need to sphere for it.  Quaid is fantastic because he negates most of the random rules.  BB starting at 0?  I still get SBBs.   No BBs?  I still have plenty of damage and kill in 2 turns without BB.  No sphere support?

Interestingly, this will also probably double as my Metal Parade squad just because of Lugina's infinite SBB that gives an ignore defense buff.

bravefrontier,3dtujx,AzayakaAsahi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:25:21 2015 UTC,"Your win streak is not high because your leader does not add damage.  You need a leader that adds attack and ether does BB support or adds bulk on the side, or else random rules will cause you trouble.  Ardin is a better leader than Feeva, if you can get the rainbow requirement.  Also, the order they are, top to bottom, can affect their BB chances a lot.  Currently a  My squad, top (goes first) to bottom (goes last):   Orna (blighted seal, death axe) Quaid lead (varies, I also use him for raid and the spheres don't matter much) Ardin (DUEL fragment, geldnite, max imp) Atro (urias, sol creator) Selena (lexida, sol creator)   Most turns 4 or 5 units have SBB after the first turn.   Four of five units have unresisted BBs, lots of element adding or strong buffs at the top of the order.  Selena cleans up the mess in the rare event nobody BBs.  I typically kill 2 to 4 of the enemy units on turn 1 as well.  Death axe is a very good arena sphere, it makes a unit near the crit cap on turn 1.  Combine it with something like Blighted seal and that unit will insta-gib any unit if they crit -- which happens most of the time.  Currently at 457 consecutive wins but would easily be at 1000 if I didn't bring my imp parade squad to the arena by accident a while back.  My best streak is currently at 800+ (that was with my Ardin lead before random rules came about)."

Try and find ways to get your defense buff on Elimo active more often--use a status cleanser or another mitigator instead of just Elimo by herself. If you have him, Balgran can debuff the enemy with injury and a whole other slew of ailments while giving a defense conversion buff that stack with other defense buffs.  7 star Melchio is a fair bit away, but he cleanses and nulls status ailments instead of inflicting them on the enemy while giving the same attack--> defense conversion buff as Balgran's.  1 Mitigation LS + 1 HP LS is better than Dual HP leads if you're facing one or two types of enemies. For Lugina's (and Seria's) trial for example, bringing Magnazorda is good so you can reduce the really high damage attacks into something more manageable even with regular mitigation. Some combinations of leads leads work and some don't work so well, so experiment and see what gives you the most success."

bravefrontier,3dsy9z,Dan_Ugore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:42:40 2015 UTC,"Personally for me I think 14k HP is the ""safe"" threshold for HP before you can even start risking not mitigating (assuming you somehow can't mitigate, or don't want to). It's not too difficult with any form of defense buff and your units are not taking elemental weakness.   6* units will really be taking a heavy beating from seria's trial onwards, making them impractical for clearing trials with. I believe eventually RC5 and the like will also suffer the same fate.   For most of my hard content I go with double HP leads (although I didn't do Lugina ex with any and seria ex I only had 1) nowadays and make sure the whole squad is as pimped as possible especially in HP and defense.   Typing doesn't matter, but if you use any oracle units it's a must to have hp leads. Even oracle 7* with 6k base hp can hit 14k hp with proper imping, 2 HP leads, plus any 30% hp sphere and an ex sphere."

bravefrontier,3dwix8,Vlykeron,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:30 2015 UTC,Took me like around 25 tries to beat her!! Lily Matah FTW!!

bravefrontier,3dwix8,gameboymania,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:51:07 2015 UTC,"Congrats, getting a trial clear is always a nice feeling, and I wouldn't blame you for seeing it as a personal achievement... but posting about pre 7* (and even 6* in some cases) era trial clears with 7* units is going to get you more downvotes than congratulations >_<"
bravefrontier,3dwix8,gameboymania,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:27:13 2015 UTC,"Lol, I saw that coming a mile away and that's fine. I've been trying to beat this thing for months on end and gave up about a month ago. Finally got back into trying it."

bravefrontier,3dwix8,juubs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:56:20 2015 UTC,"Just keep a team that can sustain zebra, he's not so hard. After that just use semira to curse phee and paralyze luther. After that it's just being fucked in the ass by constant healing"
bravefrontier,3dwix8,aIIeviate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:29:32 2015 UTC,"Tried the fight earlier today with the same team I used on Maxwell. Got pretty damn far, so I think I can beat Cardes easily if I mix the team up a bit."
bravefrontier,3dwix8,Garconcl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:14:48 2015 UTC,"Also, would Tia or Rigness be better on the first team? Rigness gets rid of status ailment, but Tia I think heals more. And my Tia is already 6 star."
bravefrontier,3dwix8,_fulgrator_,0,Tue Jul 21 14:00:34 2015 UTC,"Ignore the other dicks. If it makes you excited, good. Congrats on beating Maxwell, onto Cardes!"
bravefrontier,3dwix8,CBSU,-2,Mon Jul 20 03:31:54 2015 UTC,I'm sure that was super hard /s
bravefrontier,3dwix8,thortilla27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"Up until now, it was extremely hard."
bravefrontier,3dwix8,Garconcl,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:42:13 2015 UTC,"Not in an objective sense? When she came out we had up to Zelnite and Darvanshel batch 6*. So saying that it's hard using some 7* units is just wrong. I mean congrats on beating it and stuff, but it's not what I'd call an achievement within the scheme of the game anymore."
bravefrontier,3dwix8,thortilla27,3,Mon Jul 20 03:52:00 2015 UTC,"he means before this point and time, it was difficult until now"
bravefrontier,3dwix8,Garconcl,0,Mon Jul 20 04:07:42 2015 UTC,"Tridon is probably the worst unit in the game right now, even eric has possitive numbers unlike tridon with negative defense and mitigation negation. Lilith is quite weak compared to current meta units but I cleared the trial with her and with imps and sphere frogs it could have been easier.  Tridon was your problem, I hope they fix his shield with his 7*, right now he is negative, not even useless, because useless is a word too gentle for him."
bravefrontier,3dwix8,thortilla27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:23:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after I stopped using Tridon, I noticed was I getting further with more ease. It just sucked to toss him out because I really like him."
bravefrontier,3dwix8,Garconcl,0,Mon Jul 20 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"um no tridon is extremely used in Afla Dillith, and I used him for my GGCs. Maybe you don't have one, that's why you're saying that. He has possibly one of the best defensive leader skills in the game, and he was my go-to leader for everything. I tested him on the Cardes stage, and he worked perfectly. Motivations stacks with the shields."
bravefrontier,3dwix8,SeeZee21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:44:41 2015 UTC,"There was (is?) a bug that caused his shield's defense to persist even after it was gone, leading to abnormally large damage taken.  You wouldn't notice it in most cases, but during Gravion's ultimate attack the shield would be extremely detrimental in that it essentially negates mitigation causing any unit with it to die instantly. This was during the Green Trial's first release and it may have been fixed."
bravefrontier,3dqf0s,Ivris-the-Gentle,2,Sat Jul 18 13:11:00 2015 UTC,This fan art is months old but it it was so good.  I liked Edea's design before her 7* was announced but fan art for her was rare and this one was the one I really liked a lot

bravefrontier,3dqf0s,Horizonset,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:12:00 2015 UTC,I upvoted but just because of the fact that with armor edea you could imagine the plot.
