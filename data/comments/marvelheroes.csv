marvelheroes,3e4ads,Halaku,2,Tue Jul 21 21:09:38 2015 UTC,I think so ya. None have been FULLY confirmed. Gaz has said that at least 1 has dropped. But they gotta check for legitimacy. If both are legit this makes 2. It's possible though that this is a picture of the first one too... so could just be one dropped.

marvelheroes,3e1d9n,Rug_d,6,Tue Jul 21 09:18:54 2015 UTC,"If you keep the video as a fairly basic outline of what the character does and what is generally beneficial, not a lot changes really.  A melee tree of powers might have all sorts of changes but that doesn't typically change the basics of how melee works and what type of items are best for it for example.  I'd love to see more vids like this that give a basic character background (even many Marvel fans may be very unfamiliar with some of the characters since we have so many) and basic outline of power trees and abilities.  I think it would be a good way to generate hype for the characters, particularly lesser-known heroes, and possibly boost sales a little.  Though...  It would definitely cost a lot to produce.  In my mind I am picturing the extra publicity that the ""Meet the <character>"" videos for TF2 produced."

However, heroes and costumes often go on sale (sometimes for up to 50% off), and fortune cards can be had for cheaper in bundles as well as on sale, so you can get just the parts of the bundle that you really want for roughly the same value if you're willing to wait for sales (but that could take months).    As to whether or not the Doom bundle is worth it.  You can only answer that for yourself.  It isn't a bad deal, but whether or not it's worth $20 is entirely subjective."

As for OP's question, IMO no - the hero packs are not worth it, because I'm not into the cosmetics (costumes, fortune cards, etc.) as much as I am into the gameplay.  I'd pay $ for a hero, but not for a costume or for cards.  Obviously, it comes down to what you like.  If you like collecting costumes and opening cards (which many do), then the hero bundles are a great deal, and you should go for it."
marvelheroes,3e3v7z,leroyyrogers,2,Tue Jul 21 23:14:02 2015 UTC,i was a newcomer when this happened.When Dr. Strange was released i bought bundle just because of the defenders costume.At first i tought was a great afterall a 1350G hero + 750G costume and extra stash and MK cards for 2000G is a great deal.After some days i had a little regret at that time. The MK cards turned into nomal boosts. the especific stash had no utility and weeks later started a bogo sale and i regreted even more. Now i buy the hero with Splinters and wait for a bogo or discount sale to buy cards or costumes.

With the addition of the Cosmic Trial mission, we've added a new tier of these modes to make the progression jump less drastic from normal to Cosmic.  Normal Patrol modes - which will be reclassified as Green in an upcoming build - should be slightly easier than the normal modes that currently exist on the live servers, while Red Patrol modes should feel like a step between the normal mode and Cosmic mode.

marvelheroes,3e2dx9,cp24eva,16,Tue Jul 21 12:48:38 2015 UTC,"It's more ""what defensive items can I take for the least loss"" you should think about, than what stats to focus on.  Everyone will tell you health - that's a given, the more health you have, the larger a buffer between you and death. Defense is actually quite important, and a lot of people who haven't actually thought the math through will spout things like 'useless past 10k' or somesuch. The fact is, defense maintains it's effective value regardless of how much you have, although I wouldn't go out of my way to get more unless it's worthwhile. Allow me to explain:  Going from 50% damage mitigation to 52% is approximately a 4% damage reduction gain (1-.48 / 1-.5 = 1.04), whereas going from 58% to 60% results in 5% damage reduction gain. Obviously you'll need more defense to make that jump, but it demonstrates how defense keeps it's value regardless of how much you have.  The only stats I generally don't view as favorable are dodge, projectile deflection, and health regen. The two formers are simply chances to take half damage (and projectile deflect only works on projectiles!), but regen can be debatably useful, but it doesn't really increase your ability to take those hits that one or two shot you. Items that provide life-on-hit (Lemuria, costume core, Fragment of Twilight, etc) are often infinitely better than health regen items.  To tl;dr it - only items I'd go out of my way to use for defense is a defensive Uru (800 defense vs 200 damage rating, c'mon), Advanced Mandroid Armor to rank 14 if you can use it (most damage rating / omega point breakpoint), and Blob (stupidly cost efficient for TTL).  For weighing defense vs offense, that's usually just a matter of taste. I geared my Juggernaut out in a balanced fashion... so I could support Brutally Awesome Summer Shades (pure offense item in slot 5, although mathematically it's great defensively with it's block proc... mathematically great) without much sacrifice. Iron Legion Armor Sheathe is also a great item that's essentially, for most characters, a weaker Hand of Doom with an extra 2k health slapped on.  EDIT: I forgot Luke Cage's synergy. Stupidly good if you're physical, usually 300-ish defense and 80 damage rating."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,4,Tue Jul 21 13:09:02 2015 UTC,"Regarding the effectiveness of defense - people don't say defense is worthless because of the percentages, they say it sucks because of the defense rating diminishing returns curve.  We start very high in the curve already just from the defense on our slot 2-5 gear so it makes optional defense rating in other slots less valuable than it could be compared to health.  To the point that when doing effective health calculations, which is how much defense adjusted damage you can take without healing, or health / (1-((1-defense%) * (1-dmg_reduction%))), defense rating doesn't need to be raised any until you hit around 80,000 28000 health (80k was taking item budget into account).  This is further compounded by the item budgeting for health versus defense rating.  Health is often budgeted at ~3 times the rate of defense rating and health is already the superior defensive stat as far as effective health goes due to the curve.  Of course just using effective health isn't perfect because it doesn't address sustain and since we don't have big heals like in MMOs, defense isn't as bad as effective health implies.  You do need enough defense + regen to be able to recover from the last big hit while also covering ongoing damage from ground effects and what not.  But considering the curve, it's usually better to take hp over defense and only take defense in slots where hp isn't available."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,zeCrazyEye,4,Tue Jul 21 14:23:45 2015 UTC,"We start very high in the curve   You had me to here. Here's a table of the % reductions at values from 10 to 20k, along with the net gain in total damage reduction:    Defense Value Total % Reduction % Reduction gained from prior rank    10000 42.8041 4.1204   11000 44.9468 3.8921   12000 46.9035 3.6850   13000 48.6972 3.4963   14000 50.3476 3.3238   15000 51.8712 3.1656   16000 53.2820 3.0198   17000 54.5921 2.8852   18000 55.8120 2.7606   19000 56.9506 2.6448   20000 58.0158 2.5371    Are there diminishing returns? Yes. Are they bad? God no, especially with any realistic values we can achieve in-game. Health is definitely important, but % mitigation becomes incredibly useful once you get above 20k-ish health (value goes higher with less passive reductions built into character kits, but fluctuates regardless).  Edit: /u/TheRealBattlePope called me out on my idiocy. Reading is hard, updated the table with correct values."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:03 2015 UTC,21000 hp at 10000 defense = 37433 eHP  20000 hp at 11000 defense = 37067 eHP  1000 hp > 1000 defense  and HP is allocated much higher than defense and things get much worse for defense if the hero has any damage reduction already built into kit.  Sorry it's hard to make a thorough argument on mobile but if you check the trend with effective hp it takes forever for 1 defense to equal 1 hp (I believe it breaks even around 28k hp) and then hp is allocated almost 3x higher on top of that..  Again this is discounting the need for defense in sustain and ability to recover which is where things start to get pretty complicated but generally the big hits are separated by enough time that you can get healed back to full hp at any attainable hp level anyway.
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,zeCrazyEye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:22 2015 UTC,"You're looking at it from a burst perspective, which is great when you're only concerned about one-shot abilities.

Factor in regeneration over time (say, 10 second or 20 second window of taking X damage per second, while recovering health from LOH procs, medkits, and health regeneration), and the defense becomes infinitely more attractive."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"Yep I've qualified it by saying it doesn't take sustainability into account.  There is a huge disparity between hp and defense in hp's favor though (and medkits do heal off % so it doesn't completely ignore sustainability).  It's much harder to quantify sustainability compared to just going into the axis raid and seeing if you live though.  I guess the easier test is to see if you can get back to near max hp during the raid, if you are near max hp a lot just add more max hp, otherwise if you are dying to attrition your defense/regen is too low."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,zeCrazyEye,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:18 2015 UTC,"TTL is the combination of EHP and EHR. In most cases, EHP is your total health divided by your total damage reduction (which you've done), while EHR is your health recovery per second divided by your damage reduction (or multiplied, it works either way as long as you do it appropriately - the point is that defense makes your healing worth more). TTL is primarily EHR, the only reason health becomes a factor is so you can eat one-shot abilities more frequently and have a larger threshold for mistakes when the damage you're taking exceeds your EHR."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"Yea, but the complicated part is applying it to the content and your player ability.  If you're forced to stand in a field that does constant damage, it's easy, if you're forced to take a big hit every 10s, it's easy, but if both those things are optional or aren't consistent then sustainability loses some value."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,zeCrazyEye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:12 2015 UTC,"The safest thing is to focus on TTL, given the hardest content in the game is mostly damage over time from medium-level impact hits that won't one-shot you. That, along with all the new cosmic affixes and the upcoming red axis raid, would be a solid indication of what to focus on. The reason people cried about Sentinels being so damn hard at their release was because they only stacked health and neglected defense. Of course Gazillion nerfed the boss anyway despite multiple groups doing it, but my point still stands."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:56 2015 UTC,"The diminishing return curve exists to make defense not the absolute best stat in the game, period.  Just because it takes more defense rating to achieve an extra 1% damage reduction doesn't mean that 1% is the same as the previous 1%.  Adding 5% damage reduction when you are at 20% is not equivalent to 5% damage reduction when you are already at 70%.  The diminshing return curve on defense rating means that each point of defense is exactly as useful as the previous point of defense, even if it's not the same percentage."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,HuggableBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"That would be true only if the defense rating curve exactly lined up with the % effectiveness you are describing, which it does not."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,zeCrazyEye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:57 2015 UTC,This is super helpful! Is there a clearly understood method for calculating damage mitigation from defense?
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,unsettlingideologies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:37:04 2015 UTC,"For once the stat sheet is non-sarcastically useful on this front. Take the typed defenses % reduction, multiply them with your character's own (for example, Juggernaut gets 10% reduction from one passive, and 15% from another), and then multiply any extra ones you have.  For the actual defense value though, it's    90D/(D+175L+1)   Where D is defense rating and L is the mob's level."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:40 2015 UTC,Isn't it the mobs level?

marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,2,Tue Jul 21 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"if your enemies are dead, they can't hurt you.    Focus on offensive only.  Just learn to dodge glowing red arrows and don't stand in the fire."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,avatarofshadow,2,Tue Jul 21 14:02:19 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem you'll run into with questions like this is too many people assume end game gear, end game gameplay (raids), very high omega points, tons of synergies unlocked, all recipes unlocked, etc. But because you're so new you don't even have access to many of these and some you don't do for a while  Once you get a massive number of omega points defense seems to be pretty trivial since you can load up on all sorts of stats and benefits.  Personally I would say a must have is the ability to resurrect on death with cool down.  Most likely I've just been spoiled by the SW power that offers this and don't need to depend on gear for it.  There is also an omega node that offers this skill but its expensive (I think 250 points, 30 minute cool down).   I know this is more survivability then defense, but I think they go hand in hand."

marvelheroes,3e2dx9,leroyyrogers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:13:00 2015 UTC,One minor point to make - the Hela blessing is also based on your HP.  So HP gives you that small amount of extra DPS if you have Hela blessings.
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,Capnpicard,0,Tue Jul 21 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"None. If anything Health(you got that bit), but otherwise generally you are focusing on DPS stats such as Critical Damage Rating, Critical Hit Rating, Brutal Damage Rating, Brutal Hit Rating, and Damage Rating.  Edit: So generally more CDR/DR is going to be better over your higher defensive item."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:05:27 2015 UTC,So I have an uru forges for 400 defense and an uru forges for 100 damage and one for 200 damage. I should prioritize damage?
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,HuggableBear,4,Tue Jul 21 13:07:06 2015 UTC,"No. The uru slot gives disproportionately more defense, the devs literally asked ""How much defense would it take to make people consider this?"" and then they doubled that number. People still say take damage, and that's sad."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:02 2015 UTC,"People still say take damage, and that's sad.   They say that because 80% of the damage in this game is avoidable one-shots.  There aren't a whole lot of pulsing AoE's or DoT's being thrown out there.  When no amount of defense is going to keep you alive through most of the game's damage, there's no reason not to build glass cannon.  Don't get me wrong, this is beyond stupid design, but that's why we take damage instead of defense."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,droid327,5,Tue Jul 21 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"No, they say it because they just zone in on damage and then gripe when they can't handle cosmic patrol zones or even the joke of a cosmic gate they're adding (the QQ on the forums is ridiculously amusing given most people I know who actually have a grasp of itemization breezed through the gate). It's 200 DR vs 800 defense. If the defensive uru said 'Take 2% less damage' instead, I guarantee a lot more people would take it without a thought. The sad thing is, that's pretty much what it says (more for most player defense values, actually, but you get my point)."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:43 2015 UTC,"Er most of my endgame-capable heroes don't die, even with offensive Urus.  What, then, is the point of taking 2% less damage if you don't die either way?  Damage only matters if you die, anything less than that is indistinguishable.  You can never have too much offense, but you can have too much defense."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,droid327,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"If you're saying you have enough defense for cosmic IC/MM/Genosha and you're not using a defensive uru, then I'd assume you're taking an overly defensive item in other slots. Meaning you could gain damage elsewhere for a small sacrifice."
marvelheroes,3e2dx9,KamahlFoK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:34 2015 UTC,"No, I dont have any slots where I've ""traded off"" defense for offense, except I use Lemuria on Iceman, but that's a much bigger TTL gain for less of a DR loss.    I don't raid so maybe its only necessary there.  But in CPZs, I don't have a problem dying because I can mitigate damage through playing well.  I cant increase my DPS through playing well, your rotation is your rotation.  The only way to increase your DPS is through itemization."

marvelheroes,3e2uz2,Barrab,5,Tue Jul 21 15:13:40 2015 UTC,a lot of people say not to buy teamups with splinters. they are more expensive to buy with splinters as opposed to heroes. ex: a 450g hero costs 200 es but a 450g teamup costs 400 es (not exact numbers but you get the idea).  i believe clea has some damage negation abilities so she should already be helping you. i use magik on active mode for her heals and summons. i found magneto quite squishy while leveling him so it's possible that a teamup won't help as much as getting better gear.
marvelheroes,3e2uz2,hugeboxofporn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:26 2015 UTC,Your roster is more important than your team-ups.  There's just not a lot of difference in power level or usability in team ups right now.

I tried switching it out for a Lizard's Formula, but LF doesn't give as much healing, so I'm using both right now.  If you don't have a quiox or don't want to lose a  dps artifact, switch to Lemuria as your relic.  That should keep his health up once you have a nice stack."

marvelheroes,3e1hxg,iDoorNail,5,Tue Jul 21 07:28:07 2015 UTC,I can play but just barely.  About 2 weeks ago after a patch I started to notice much longer loading times for areas.  Before I would have 2 - 4 seconds wait for a terminal to load or most maps.  Now the load times are 10+ seconds.  By the time it finally loads everyone in my party is already at the boss.  Same with MM or other  large areas.  Much longer wait times and area lag for the first 15+/- seconds.  And if I portal though an area too fast I'll hit areas still loading.  I know I didn't change anything besides updating my video card driver a week after noticing these issues (didn't help). Before I could play at high graphic settings with no problem.  Now it's barley playable at lowest.

Some others are reporting very high memory usage after short periods of time as well, though they have good enough comps that it isn't affecting them.  Some folks on the forums are saying it's the memory leak bug making a return. I'm not tech savvy enough to say either way, but at the very least it seems like there was some sort of change that has been negatively affecting users. It affects everyone probably, but its effects seem to be most noticeable on mid to lower end PC's while higher end PC's can likely just ignore it, or at least deal with it for longer periods of time."

Fortune card and 1 avengers assemble boost.  Is it worth it?  Thats a minimum VALUE of 1000 G for 450 G.  Or you could look at it this way, random hero unlock costs 400 G.  So its very superior to a random hero unlock.  That being said, its a gamble and you could get things you don't value.  Even so, better odds than poker."

Wolverine costume Deadpool costume Giant Ant pet  The Rogue box alone gave me her and the deadpool costume, 5 packs of cards, the ant, and tons of boosts.   All in all I'll say it was worth it."
marvelheroes,3e1ul8,notorious98,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:04 2015 UTC,"if you buy the box of 10, you've got  a very good chance of getting both ants.  you're still gambling, though.  But you'll get some really useful boosts, and fortune cards with more boosts.  And each box will either have a character token or a random costume.  The costumes could be frustrating if you don't have many heroes, of course, but it's still really fun to see what random things you get.    I buy them all the time.    Boxes come back all the time, in slightly different variants.  If the ant pets are something you're interested in, then you should get THESE before they disappear.  If it's just boxes you're interested in, they do the cosmic boxes often enough, and we've seen the Avengers boxes twice already.  Maybe three times."

If there is no info box, it's usually something that can drop from anywhere.

There's also event-specific loot, but those are available from the Event Vendors at any time, if you have enough Event currency.  Everything else is just a matter of playing the game.  Obviously, bosses have a better chance to drop loot overall, so boss fighting (ie Terminals) is still your best chance for a non-specific drop."

marvelheroes,3e38vo,accaris,5,Tue Jul 21 16:58:18 2015 UTC,"There's a substantial increase in gear drops and XP for Red terminals over Green.  You should always be attempting to run Reds (or Cosmic at 60) unless that character simply can't run them without dying.  Add to this, some of the most valuable gear in the game (some boss-specific artifacts) are incapable of dropping in Green terminals."
marvelheroes,3e38vo,LineNoise54,4,Tue Jul 21 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"Red terminals are nearly effortless. Only Cosmic ones offer any real challenge. You can also probably do the One-shots well enough, although they get harder when you hit 60."
marvelheroes,3e38vo,ohoni,3,Tue Jul 21 17:00:15 2015 UTC,i find red terms doable while leveling once i get to level 30-40. why not just try an easier one like doc oc to find out? the loot and xp is much better in red vs. green.
marvelheroes,3e38vo,hugeboxofporn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:00 2015 UTC,"Reds can be more difficult when you're lower level if you enter on the lowest end of the bracket, like level 25 in a 25-29 terminal, where the bosses are several levels above you, other than that there's not too much of a difference.  Definitely try cosmic terminals on your level 60s, it'll provide a challenge, if you want to be humbled try a cosmic patrol."
marvelheroes,3e38vo,Dirk_8,0,Tue Jul 21 18:14:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, except for a rare few characters, cosmic patrols are just deathfields. I tend to avoid them unless I have the right characters for it or I've already got the character geared up in level 69 stuff."

marvelheroes,3e27y2,AlienError,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:56 2015 UTC,"Not really, you just have learn that 90% of the stolen powers are a waste. Rogue could really benefit from a power revamp, specifically losing the boss-killer stat on Crushing Blows so her other powers can be strengthened to compare and have more viable options. Crushing Blows and Fangs being it for a hero with so many powers to choose from is kind of sad."

When you finally find one you really like, you can unlock them using ES, Gs or buy them from either the Webstore or Steam.  Most of the more ""fun-to-use"" powers unlock way after level ten."

marvelheroes,3e10nu,McBoognish,7,Tue Jul 21 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"Scarlet Witch is awesome, and at 200 ES she is an absolute steal.  You should definitely buy her.  If you don't have a team up yet the other 400 can be used for that.  Sure, you can buy Groot for 200, but Groot's really not that good.  Actually, out of all the teamups, he is hands down the worst.  As soon as you get ANY other teamup you will not use Groot ever again, so he is literally a waste of ES.  Anyone saying they still use him endgame is either terrible, only has Groot, or a troll trying to make you waste ES.  I'd suggest Clea, at 400 ES she will take the rest of your splinters but she is well worth it.  She puts down a large AoE that buffs the damage of all friendlies standing in it.  She also spams a 25% damage reduction shield on all friendlies.  On top of that her damage output and survivability are awesome.  She is also equally viable for every single hero in the game."
marvelheroes,3e10nu,ProfJackAss,2,Tue Jul 21 03:19:44 2015 UTC,"I would leverage the random gear boxes while they are still great odds.    If you are in love with a particular character, then get that one.  If you are in dire need of a team up, then pirate deadpool doesn't look too hard to get via an achievment, and should hopefully be available next patch."
marvelheroes,3e10nu,TheLordBear,3,Tue Jul 21 19:27:03 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend buying Scarlett Witch and then Clea Team-UP.  Clea is the best ""general use"" team-up in the game right now and Scarlett Witch is not only strong, but she's fun to play and she's relatively cheap to gear."
marvelheroes,3e10nu,Quexana,2,Tue Jul 21 07:36:56 2015 UTC,"Scarlet Witch and Thing are great to start off with. Both are fun and easy. Daredevil and X-23 are also really solid choices at the 200 ES marker. I would recommend not worrying about Team-Ups right now. They're helpful, but not so massively helpful they'd change the game for you, and it's better to have 10 synergies than Team-Up bonuses.   I'd recommend grabbing Scarlet, Thing, X-23, or DD (Thing would be my most recommended) and 2 random boxes. You're more likely to get more bang for it, honestly. You could get a 600 ES character, and it's more likely you get 2 400 ES characters. Save you time and effort. You may end up hating them, but right now, there aren't too many characters who are such awful spots as to be unplayable. But just in case you are unlucky, you'll have a solid 200 ES character as well."
marvelheroes,3e10nu,TheSaintDennis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:24:31 2015 UTC,"I'll jump on the Scarlett Witch / Clea team-up bandwagon as well in recommendation.

marvelheroes,3dz9ue,UndilutedZealot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:18 2015 UTC,Any advice on these moves that kill bosses fast? I can't figure him out
marvelheroes,3dz9ue,Arillious,2,Mon Jul 20 23:48:59 2015 UTC,"Start with Vehicular Manslaughter (If you're a high enough level.)  Use  his belt buckle basic or his crowbar basic, whichever you have unlocked.  For leveling, I go with Demspey roll at max combo points since it does more damage, but the animation is a bit long so if they move, you'll miss.  If you feel like you're missing too much, drop dempsey roll and go with harlem dropkick.  Max his passive thats like combo fighting mastery or something like that.  It's a passive in his middle tree sort of towards the bottom.  I ignore his signature and the heroes for hire tree.  I like Iron fists healing, the extra credit drop passive, and the defensive passive, but those are all 1 point wonders."
marvelheroes,3dz9ue,UndilutedZealot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:15:34 2015 UTC,i like the crowbar/harlem dropkick routine for leveling. 1 pt. Misty Knight. everything else is optional (but max his passives). max combo harlem dropkick does a huge amount of damage while leveling
marvelheroes,3dz9ue,thug_politics,2,Tue Jul 21 13:14:17 2015 UTC,"the 1 point in the follower is really just whoever you like.  I just like Iron's Fist's regen.  If you have a gungnir and a +3 fighting pet and get lucky with a brut while leveling, you probably could 1 shot a boss with a dropkick."

marvelheroes,3dz9ue,GrapeMousse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:31 2015 UTC,Thing definitely got me started on Jugs when i realized they had some major things in common.   He takes some getting used to.    The most important distinction is how he builds toward a single spender that can whiff heavily and his builders aren't that awe inspiring damage wise.   It's sort of all or nothing and whether you like Big Elbow Drop or hate it will largely determine if you enjoy the character.  Where as Thing has lots and lots of large hitting moves and doesn't blow his resource all at once.
marvelheroes,3dz9ue,The_Keto_Warrior,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:00 2015 UTC,"i play thing often, and when I get bored of him I jump on she hulk, daredevil, colossus. Not quite the same but i like the combo system of she hulk and DD with the occasional big hits while staying fairly tanky. with colossus, it's a little similar but he's more tanky and less dps."
marvelheroes,3dz9ue,asylum101,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"Everyone overlooks Gambit because he's not top-tier for raiding, but if you want a durable, mobile, melee for leveling, he's crazy fun.  He has a jump attack like Hulk, a charge up wave clear, a ground effect AoE, a boss killer that hits pretty freaking hard, solid enough defense where he's not gonna die until cosmics, and great voice over.  His only weakness is that he's spirit hungry early, but as soon as you get his unique boots, that goes away."
marvelheroes,3dz9ue,HuggableBear,2,Tue Jul 21 12:06:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you enjoy about Thing. If its his call in abilities like lets roll Suzie and such, give Reed a look.  He's got some fun non standard sigs and moves"

marvelheroes,3dzinl,Sleepy_StormTrooper,4,Mon Jul 20 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"Critical Hit, Critical Damage, +skills, Health. Basically."
marvelheroes,3dzinl,Stelcio,3,Mon Jul 20 21:02:39 2015 UTC,"Because this game has no ""roles"" like tank, healer, dps, etc, everyone is essentially a ""dps"" hero, and that obviously makes the highest damage possible your priority. The most important stats are, Damage Rating, Critical Damage Rating, Crititcal Hit Rating, Brutal Strike Damage, Brutal Strike Rating, Attack Speed in basically that order.   If the numbers haven't changed, then 250 Damage Rating is equal to 500 Critical Damage Rating which is equal to 1000 Brutal Damage Rating, this is because a higher damage rating results naturally in a bigger crit, and a bigger crit naturally results in a bigger brutal. One rank of a skill is equivalent to (if I remember correctly) 400 DR (damage rating) to that particular skill. Getting to >45% CHR and BHR (Critical hit rating and Brutal Hit Rating) is very important, but easy, then it is vital to stack as much damage as possible. If you're playing a hero like X-23 who deals only Physical Damage, then Physical DR/CHR/BHR/etc are the important values. Skills are important to get to 50 for maximum DPS. Attack Speed is also relevant to everyone because a higher attack speed also speeds up cast animations not only attacks, but isn't always necessary or important to every hero. Finally, health gives your survivability to not get insta-gibbed in Cosmic or Raid instances, but honestly should come naturally with top tier gear and high skill ranks in passives for alot of heros.  If you mean actual ""stats"" like Durability, Strength, Fighting, etc, then stack as much Fighting as you possibly can on almost every single hero, because fighting gives base damage just like Energy/Strength, but also gives CHR and CDR, which again, are very important. The only heros who don't want to stack Fighting, would be summoner heros because they want to stack Intelligence, which also gives good offensive stats for the hero, and alot of damage to the summons.  That should about cover it."
marvelheroes,3dzinl,Falsum,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:53 2015 UTC,"You forgot to mention that Attack Speed hit heavy diminishing returns after >20-25% (IIRC). Everything else is spot on.  Also, Dodge and Tenacity aren't important."
marvelheroes,3dzinl,ProtonixChaos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:10 2015 UTC,"Fighting is BHR/BDR, not crit.  Intelligence is CHR/CDR, but the returns are much lower because it lacks the 3% base damage that you get for Fighting.  Energy/Strength is slightly lower overall in DPS than Fighting, but for some heroes the -Spirit% can more than make up for the slight damage loss, if it means you spend more time casting heavy hitters and less time using lower power skills to build spirit."
marvelheroes,3dzinl,LineNoise54,2,Mon Jul 20 22:48:17 2015 UTC,"You can give this a try. I haven't watched this particular video, but he's a great source of information for Marvel Heroes in general. Now this does focus on damage, so it probably won't go over stats related to survival. But the general consensus is to get just enough survivability so that you aren't constantly dying and then focus on damage. More life/defenses if you're getting one shot and more regen if you can take some punishment but can't last in a sustained fight."
marvelheroes,3dzinl,AtomicCandy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:25 2015 UTC,"To add to that, survival stats aren't really worth making a video about because so many of them are plain worthless and/or scale horribly.  TTL stats are basically stack enough health to survive hits, get invul/medkit on core, and maybe pick up some LoH somewhere.  Defense/Dodge/Deflect/Tenacity are all not worth bothering with."
marvelheroes,3dzinl,LineNoise54,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:45:51 2015 UTC,"if your enemy is dead, he can't hit you.  if you can do enough damage, and do it quickly enough, you could have 1 point of health, and you're still alive and he's still dead.    This is why most people look at critical hit and critical damage and ignore things like dodge, tenacity, and such.    Although everybody seems to get ""Life on Hit"" so they don't have to worry about the occasional bump."

marvelheroes,3dx30q,Blade_Omega,3,Mon Jul 20 14:02:43 2015 UTC,Dude... Not gonna lie as soon as I noticed how much XP was dropping from them yellow orbs in MM... It took me about an hour and a half to level a toon from 0-60 and I got over 100 Omega Orbs per hour running around in the 55-59 zone... My only regret is I lacked the constitution to grind it all weekend.
marvelheroes,3dx30q,QuorumOf4,5,Mon Jul 20 14:29:07 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm... while I'm not going to say I didn't benefit from the yellow orb bug (leveling Ant-man was basically power-leveling), isn't this the wrong way to go about it?  By disabling the yellow orbs, they aren't fixing anything and for the people who weren't abusing it they're actually taking away the XP that they should be getting if there wasn't a bug."
marvelheroes,3dx30q,matlockheed,11,Mon Jul 20 11:15:47 2015 UTC,"It's an easily-exploitable bug, folks.

marvelheroes,3dx30q,airfoam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:11 2015 UTC,Except that history shows things like this don't get nerfed until some asshat goes posting it everywhere on forums and reddit.  Remember exp from Midtown boxes?  Didn't get nerfed until Nullrage made a thread about it here.
marvelheroes,3dx30q,Xenosaj,0,Tue Jul 21 01:18:28 2015 UTC,"They just found out about it today. Most people didn't know about it until last night and today. You think if they knew about this on Thursday, they wouldn't have fixed it by Friday? They rushed someone into their office on a late Sunday night just to turn off the yellow XP orbs.  It's not even a game-breaking bug. It just affects their boost sales negatively because people can level much faster either without boosts or requiring a lot less boosts than they normally would be using to get to 60, so they needed to put an end to this asap."
marvelheroes,3dx30q,C_L_I_C_K,2,Mon Jul 20 09:45:39 2015 UTC,"Well, everyone was talking about it in social by Friday afternoon so no. They also probably saw people getting 30+ characters 1-60 in one day. They knew about it long before yesterday."

marvelheroes,3dx30q,bingcognito,3,Mon Jul 20 14:00:11 2015 UTC,"Basically any champion pack, cop event, or side event in MM dropped its normal 2-6 exp orbs, however they were giving massive exp (with 500% boost they were ~750k/orb at level 50). In addition the chests from the 3 mini events in Bronx Zoo were giving 3.5million/orb so if you did MM for a minute -> Zoo (50-54 bracket), bodyslide after the events, Zoo (55-59) , MM for another minute you went 50-60 in under 10 minutes."

That's not simply a ""fun"" bug, its a gamebreaking one.  It'd be ""fun"" if hero tokens started dropping like pure elements, too, but obviously they're not going to let that happen.  The yellow orb bug, if they ""just let it go"", would fundamentally change the way people play the game, once word had spread around.  And they always move quickly to squash gamebreaking bugs, positive or negative.  It has very little to do with protecting the Store, and almost everything to do with protecting the game experience.

marvelheroes,3dzy6a,ProfJackAss,4,Mon Jul 20 22:07:10 2015 UTC,This. Omegas will come with time invested. I've been playing for 2 months or so and I'm just at 2k. I have never Tasky farmed during events. I play normally and when I get one I usually pay it no mind.

marvelheroes,3dzy6a,KiFirE,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:17:31 2015 UTC,Right.  Omega points are rewards for playing a game you enjoy playing.  They are not the game themselves.

marvelheroes,3dzy6a,Ishakaru,3,Mon Jul 20 23:13:52 2015 UTC,"let's not blizzard-ify every game known to man.   i like the fact that omegas are capped and that every point takes same ammount of xp, that way you'll catch up with the hardcore players eventually."
marvelheroes,3dzy6a,kestenovski,0,Mon Jul 20 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"I definitely think a scaling XP system would have worked nicely for Omegas but I've accepted the system as it is and honestly it's not so bad.

marvelheroes,3dzy6a,HandsUpDontBan,0,Tue Jul 21 04:06:28 2015 UTC,I have been playing for a year and I gave 400. My only gameplay is leveling heroes though so take that as you will
marvelheroes,3dzy6a,sappycap,0,Tue Jul 21 05:50:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say no to something like that but at the same time don't really care. Omegas come very slowly for me as I like to level a hero to 60, play them for a few hours there, then move on to the next hero and at low levels it can take hours between each Omega point. I'm at about 1100 points now which seems very low since Gaz said the average player would take 1 year to get 7.5k points.  On the other hand it's not like I really need them with this playstyle and I can certainly understand that it should be considered an end-game activity."
marvelheroes,3dzy6a,tarrach,-7,Tue Jul 21 13:00:17 2015 UTC,"I agree.  As a seasonal player(I work in a school related field, thus I have WAY more free time to play in the summer), this system really irks me.  I'm one of the better Black Widow players in Marvel Heroes.  Last summer, before the omega system, I was able to set a new Black Widow ttk record.  This summer, I've completely geared with BiS level gear, and most of my items are high rolled(90% in all offensive stats).  However, I'm 5k omega behind the curve.  The time required to catch up those 5k points is pretty significant.  Short of buying a bunch of xp boosts during the next big 10(assuming it actually happens when I have time off), I probably won't even get close.  Ultimately, I'll have to accept I won't be able to be top tier in this game again.  That's really disappointing though, because this ridiculous time investment didn't exist when I started playing.  I've proven I've got the skills, but I don't have the time for what the game has become."

marvelheroes,3dvwr1,capt_action94552,5,Mon Jul 20 00:16:44 2015 UTC,that number uses your inventory total for splinters and cube shards. So you now have 202 cube shards. Means you probably got 5 shards from the daily gift.
marvelheroes,3dvwr1,notsam57,3,Mon Jul 20 00:48:13 2015 UTC,"its weird.  on initial pick up, it'll show the total count.  subsequent pick ups, it'll show the picked up amount only."

marvelheroes,3dwaiz,droid327,4,Mon Jul 20 01:47:42 2015 UTC,My main is Scarlet witch and I would have to say the most enjoyable characters i've unlocked to play and level were rocket racoon and Juggernaut which was surprising to me be cause I normally hate melee characters.  Both characters leveled up really fast and were overall lots of fun to play during that time.
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,urbn,4,Mon Jul 20 03:18:04 2015 UTC,"My mains right now are SW and RR too :)  I have Juggs too, I like the simplicity of his ED build and his spirit-to-dmg mechanic."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,urbn,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:06 2015 UTC,"I think I like Juggs because his sig is so dependent on timing and skill.  Screw up and you're not going to do much damage, but if you get the right position, no lag, and proper timing the amount of damage you can do seems to be insane.  I also use a trackball though so I can control his sig really well."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,GreatMadWombat,4,Mon Jul 20 03:38:14 2015 UTC,"I've got no idea how SS will raid, but for leveling/clearing things, he is STUPID-fun.  Turn on the toggles, WHOOSH! you fly about leaving death trails, then hit things, and then fly about more, then shoot things. His movement build just...feels well designed.  Not sure about EMF though.  Also, they went for quality for his costumes over quantity(the Silver Savage one is absurdly detailed and looks fantastic, and the Exiles one uses a dark red for his energy powers, and sports a fancy new board)"
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,Ishakaru,7,Mon Jul 20 05:36:25 2015 UTC,Deadpool!  He's got a review in the near future! He's going to be so OP that the servers will go down for a week! (while he eats chimichangas)
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,Ishakaru,4,Mon Jul 20 04:51:31 2015 UTC,"I've had both DP and Cable insanely geared out for how much they relatively suck right now since like January, in anticipation of their respective 52s and becoming the best heroes in the game :)  I cant wait to see what they're like, with a full true teleport and awesome ranged skillsets including actual sigs.  Either one of them might bump SW out of some of her roles on my roster depending how powerful and survivable they prove...I'm wagering they're hands-down going to be the best terminal runners if nothing else"
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,CommissarSCV,2,Mon Jul 20 05:17:52 2015 UTC,"I have both at cosmic 60. Just finished deadpool like last week. Ding 60, swap to a different hero. I think that's when I started on doom. Cable on the other hand has been my work horse for most of my 6k omega."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,jordan13542,2,Mon Jul 20 12:05:01 2015 UTC,"To back up the Cap support his mobility is really fluid as well.  His dash is really quick, he has airborne assault, meteor kick, and his sig that get you back into melee range after you dash out of a red circle(if you even need to)."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,bullintheheather,2,Mon Jul 20 07:04:02 2015 UTC,"I love Nova to death, but I suggest you steer clear. He's pretty bugged."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,mattinva,2,Mon Jul 20 11:31:23 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Cap from your list.  He is kind of easy mode, but also satisfying.  They really worked hard to make his combat flow and feel right.  His mobility is also OK, his On Your Left is a good sprint, and he has his flip to navigate obstacles if you're ok with swapping macros."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,ledbetterus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:17:50 2015 UTC,"Just hit 60 with Nova and while I was playing mostly pulsar builds I had a blast.  One of my easier, more fun leveling experiences so far, although not as easy as Cap."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,ledbetterus,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:32:03 2015 UTC,"In my personal experience I hated leveling Cap and Punisher.  I enjoyed Nova a bit but of those four listed heroes I enjoyed Surfer the most.  Dashing around MM is all you need to do to clear most packs (at max level with gear, that is).  He took a bit of a hit since the EMF nerf a long while back but from what I hear he's pretty viable.  Although I don't know for sure.  Again this is a personal preference of mine.  I know a lot of people who love Cap and Punisher, they just weren't for me."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,upvotesforeverything,2,Mon Jul 20 02:02:51 2015 UTC,"Well EMF is supposedly back up to snuff as far as a single target spender, so that'd help with bosses etc.  What didn't you like about Cap and Punisher, specifically?"
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,upvotesforeverything,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:27:52 2015 UTC,I thought Caps rotation was overly complicated for no reason and I never found a good build for Punisher that I enjoyed using.
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,suniis,2,Mon Jul 20 02:37:19 2015 UTC,"His rotation is ""hit the abilities off CD"". A lot of people found him boring because of how simplistic his rotation is."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,bullintheheather,2,Mon Jul 20 02:55:45 2015 UTC,"So its kinda just hotbar whackamole?  I had the same thing with Strange...not necessarily bad, but it is better if I can watch the bad guy instead of babysitting cooldowns."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,ledbetterus,4,Mon Jul 20 03:28:46 2015 UTC,Yep. That's pretty much it. The serum bar is so unnecessary and trivial in terms of management in the grand scheme of things that it might as well not even be there.
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,upvotesforeverything,3,Mon Jul 20 03:39:55 2015 UTC,"^ This. Forget the serum bar. Cap is really fun and fluid to play. It actually feels like Cap in the movies: Throw shield, jump over enemy, kick him and send him flying, punch a couple more guys while your shield is still bouncing around hitting dudes in the face, catch your shield and look cool while you stare at a room full of dead bodies...  Surfer is really powerful IMO and fun to play if you like movement based builds.  Punisher is really fun IMO. It really feels like you are using a bunch of weapons for different situations, and the reload mechanic is quite fun yet simple. His DPS took a bit of a dive it seems, but not enough to suck the fun out of it. He was the last guy I thought I would enjoy and he surprised the hell out of me.  I only played Nova for like 10 mins, got him to level 7-8 or something. Didn't really dig. I would have to give him another go at some point..."
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,Dirk_8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:13:16 2015 UTC,It's like a smaller version of Dr. Strange.  You aren't going to be trying to keep as many abilities on cooldown.  I think it's like 4 + Vibranium Bash as your spender + signature when mana is low.
marvelheroes,3dwaiz,NarcolepticWiener,-2,Mon Jul 20 14:19:33 2015 UTC,"Meh, I took it as more than that.  ""Wait for full whateverpowerbarthingiscalled hit this once, then this 3x then this once back to this 2x over here to this.""  I know that's not what it is but his gameplay didn't feel fluid at all."

marvelheroes,3dt3k5,KleptoBot,3,Sun Jul 19 05:39:19 2015 UTC,its their design philosophy.
marvelheroes,3dt3k5,notsam57,14,Sun Jul 19 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"It used to be like that, but once all the characters became playable until 10 you ""owned"" them but had to unlock them they were all there. But scroll to the bottom and you'll see Ant-Man and Doctor Doom grayed out. I imagine all the new characters like War Machine and Kitty Pride will be grayed out till you buy them."
marvelheroes,3dt3k5,SugarBeef,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:07:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my bet is every anniversary they will do the last year's heroes up to 10. Seems like a solid plan tbh. I do wish we could organize as we want though... If we could I would organize by teams though, maybe even use folders to group more effeciently... I like order though"
marvelheroes,3dt3k5,Mosskiller96,9,Mon Jul 20 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"It was like this, but then we got the whole ""try every hero to 10"" thing so the UI got confused. Honestly after you get a bunch of heroes the same issue exists anyways, so I'd really like to see some more comprehensive changes. Grid view/small icons/list or some such, or even just making the little tiny window bigger would all go a decent way to helping."
marvelheroes,3dt3k5,Uler,3,Sun Jul 19 06:25:37 2015 UTC,"Yup.  As a player who has bought all of the advance packs (Ultimate, Adv.1, Adv.2) and has all heroes... dear god yes.

marvelheroes,3dt3k5,RandomNPC15,2,Sun Jul 19 06:49:51 2015 UTC,"I imagine (and this is totally uninformed speculation) the way it is now encourages impulse buys. Heroes are probably a significantly larger portion of sales compared to team ups, so that's my guess for why heroes are like that when team up aren't.  edit: derp didn't even remember it used to be like that before the level 10 trials"
marvelheroes,3dt3k5,Rhodair,2,Sun Jul 19 05:12:06 2015 UTC,They really need to redo that whole interface.  Seeing only 6 at a time makes for a lot of scrolling with the problem compounding as the roster grows.

marvelheroes,3dt3k5,droid327,-2,Mon Jul 20 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"They do.  You just own every hero except Ant Man and Doom.  You can only play most till 10, but they're still unlocked."
marvelheroes,3dt3k5,Pinkasso,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"nope, they made this change when they expanded the starter roster for aou. i wish they would revert this change, but it's no biggie.  but i would like to show team up levels like they're displayed in the hero tab, so i can have an overview of the team-ups i've got at 60 and below."
marvelheroes,3dt3k5,droid327,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"The team up and hero rosters work exactly the same, though, is my point.  Its your unlocked heroes on top alphabetically, and the locked heroes on bottom alphabetically.  When they started the play-to-10 model, all the old starters suddenly jumped up among your other unlocked heroes, alphabetically (which was annoying). When they added the Avengers as starters for AOU, they jumped up too.  Then they opened it up to every hero except newly released ones, and so only Victor and Scott are down there lonely and gray at the bottom of your roster.  The game doesn't differentiate between fully unlocked and unlocked-to-10 heroes, they're all still just ""unlocked""  That's exactly how the TU roster works too, except there aren't ""starter"" teamups, just locked and unlocked.   So I don't see what you're suggesting they change about the Hero roster."
marvelheroes,3dw8ig,Zukuto,9,Mon Jul 20 01:29:36 2015 UTC,"Which client are you using?  I've been using steam since pre launch and its been a static 16gb for months now.  Most of what you're downloading is overwriting old files.  I've seen it leave patching data and sometimes even duplicate files though, which is a big issue that can(but shouldn't need to be) manually removed."
marvelheroes,3dw8ig,CommissarSCV,3,Mon Jul 20 02:05:23 2015 UTC,Yeah this had bugged me too in games. Some of the files overwrite other files so just because you download 2gb does not mean you get 2gb more of files in the game install location folder. You can try this trick. uninstall and reinstall game. I did this with a few games and it trimmed down the size. The reason was because I had extra art files that the game did not need anymore.

marvelheroes,3dw8ig,Xenosaj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:42 2015 UTC,"You guys, realize this game needs to be on a SSD to run decently on some (most?) configs.   You have no idea what you're talking about.  I'm playing MH on a computer that's at least five years old--a lifetime as far as upgrading is concerned--and it runs fine on pretty much max settings for me.  I have some things turned off, like max body count, but that's more personal preference for a lack of visual clutter onscreen.  The game itself can only run so well due to Gaz using a very old engine they didn't create and the inability to really optimize the code, not to mention near-constant additions of content.  An SSD can only counter so much of the inherent code-related problems this game has."
marvelheroes,3dw8ig,suspectprime,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:09:12 2015 UTC,"So you admit a SSD helps improving the performance of the game, but i have no idea what im talking about when i say the same. Good reasoning. Keep up the good work!"
marvelheroes,3dw8ig,Xenosaj,0,Mon Jul 20 21:15:45 2015 UTC,You're a moron.  The only thing an SSD improves over an HDD is load times.

Dude, get it? You aren't the only 1 playing MH! There are tons of people out there who got their perf boost because they installed MH on a SSD. And im 1 of them when i had MH on HDD the game engine couldn't load in textures/assets fast enough so my game was laggy as hell every time i moved fast or arrived into a big fight where i had to wait for 3-4 sec on a freezed screen so the game can load in what's going on not to mention horrible fps drops everywhere. Installed it on SSD all  of this problems solved. So you say your version and you think that's God's words which we should abide no matter what. Grow up and try to accept that others are not you. And next time (when you achieved the accept others part) try to look it up if somebody says something otherwise so you wont look like a dumb tryhard."
marvelheroes,3dwhyb,ghettochipmunk,11,Mon Jul 20 02:54:42 2015 UTC,"Some people have awful luck with those, but they are not rigged or skewed. I recently went through a set of 3 emma frosts in a row, so I know your pain. Best of luck, and if you really want a specific hero, it'll be worth saving the ES up to buy them outright. Definitely look at the 200 ES heroes, since those take almost the same amount as the random."
marvelheroes,3dwhyb,Mosskiller96,6,Mon Jul 20 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"Personally i recommend against picking up 200 ES heroes with splinters.  Save those cheap ones for the BOGO (buy one, get one random) sales.  Unless spending cash isn't an option at all, then disregard."

marvelheroes,3dwhyb,Cypher_86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though - the odds of getting the same hero three times in a row is over 1 in a hundred thousand.  Im not saying it's rigged, but Id be curious to see how they set up their RNG. Id wager that there's something in there that skews the results."
marvelheroes,3dwhyb,Elgand,3,Mon Jul 20 13:24:12 2015 UTC,"Commonly RNG is seeded by the current time, to a certain level of precision.   From what I have read, Gaz seems to not be very precise. If you purchase three boxes in sequence the RNG could functionally roll the same number 3 times due to the same seeded time.   We know that boxes roll when they enter your inventory and not when you open them.   It is always a good rule to purchase random hero boxes with at least a few minutes between their purchase. This is how you gain a bit of control over the RNG system and avoid 4x back-to-back Daredevil hero tokens like one person reported months ago."
marvelheroes,3dwhyb,ProfJackAss,2,Mon Jul 20 13:44:26 2015 UTC,This seems like useful advice.  Thank you sir!
marvelheroes,3dwhyb,indigoINKS,6,Mon Jul 20 21:34:24 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why I tell people to save for a hero they actually want to play.  Sure, you can feasibly save time with random boxes to a point, but random is still random.  I'd rather save for a hero I actually want to play than go random and get screwed over with a dupe or a hero I don't care for."
marvelheroes,3dwhyb,ProfJackAss,2,Mon Jul 20 05:02:51 2015 UTC,"I have been telling people this since I started playing the game. I own every hero, and never once did I buy a random hero box. I always figured that the time I would spend wasting on dupe heroes or ones I didnt want (which I knew I would eventually grab anyways) would be worse than the little bit of extra time it takes to farm the splinters for the hero(es) I want."
marvelheroes,3dwhyb,llleTownlll,0,Mon Jul 20 12:05:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, yeah.  Plus it's just more appealing to play a hero you actually want to play instead of getting randomed into something you don't.  My first random was black widow, I never randomed again."

Sure, the odds are in your favor of getting a hero you don't already own, but there's always the possibility that it will be one you do, and subsequent boxes have no effect on each other.  It's not like your chances of getting a hero you don't have go up as you open more boxes, yet it always seems like that's how people think it works.  I understand the frustration, but if you wanted a new hero, you should've stopped after the first random box and just saved for a specific hero."

marvelheroes,3dwhyb,stondius,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"Asking if Gaz is purposely skewing RNG is not a legitimate question.  As for him being a new player, that's supposed to excuse his lack of thinking it through before buying that second and third box?  How hard is it to go, ""Hmm, do I want to be cheap and risk getting a dupe, or is it more important to me to get a new hero?""  The first box, sure, he doesn't own a lot of heroes, it's only 175 splinters, odds are in his favor.  Whoops, got a dupe, guess I'd better keep buying random boxes because I don't understand how RNG and statistics work.  Every time someone comes to the forums or this subreddit crying about how the random box gave them a dupe, this is how it comes across.  Yep, getting a dupe sucks, but it says on the damn box that you can get one you already own.  Neither Gaz nor any other player is responsible for you making the choice to gamble and taking the risk of not getting a new hero.  It's the player's fault for not thinking through their actions logically and realizing that getting a new hero is more important to them than a quick and cheap gamble.  Suck it up, save up the splinters, and just buy the specific hero you want.  Or put some actual money into this game you enjoy for free to show some support and buy an entire pack of heroes all at once and get the bonus of costumes and stash spaces.  But don't go gambling and then come crying here looking for sympathy when you don't get your way."

marvelheroes,3dw0fl,Sensaround,4,Mon Jul 20 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"It's a sales tactic.  Just like the sausage and hotdog bun thing.  Sausages come in packs of ten but buns come either in half a dozen or a dozen.  This makes you either buy more sausages than you need or more buns than you need.  They make you buy more Gs than you need to buy items.  You have Gs left over after buying the item. However, the Gs you have left over might not be enough to buy another item.  You have to buy more Gs to buy that item, leaving you with more Gs left over and the cycle continues.  It may not seem ethical to some but it is common practice with a lot of establishments."

marvelheroes,3dw0fl,Uniqron,2,Mon Jul 20 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"Because people rather buy a hero for 900G than for $8.99. And now they can sell you 1000G instead for $9.99, after which you have 100G leftover which is hard to spend, so you add some more G later on, etc.  It's just a tactic to keep you spending a bit more than if the prices where in $/€, etc as explained in the gamasutra article above.  Chips are spend more easily in casino's then you would bills. Even when the conversion is simple or if it has the value on the face of the chip.  I'd really like to specify my own amount of G's to buy, but it is not there for a reason. (not that it would be technically difficult...)"
marvelheroes,3dw0fl,Atrumentis,2,Mon Jul 20 10:46:57 2015 UTC,"If it was an actual currency it would be subject to real world currency exchange and get a lot more complicated.

marvelheroes,3dw0fl,OriginmanOne,0,Mon Jul 20 00:20:33 2015 UTC,The game shouldn't have to calculate exchange rates etc.  The universal currency is pretty necessary given the online nature of the game.

The main reason Cosmic patrol bosses take so long are the number of undergeared fluff players scaling the bosses to begin with. If you're constantly dying either eat the return and travel back or stay dead so you don't miss drops. It takes no more than 10 seconds to get to any given point in both Patrol zones regardless of character.   Ziggurats are not rare. If your main hero has bad movement, use one."

At that point it takes longer to rez than to walk back with out a travel power.  Most times I'll try and get the rez if it's in a back corner or something. But only if the flow of battle allows it. You know the person isn't dead in a pool of fire.
marvelheroes,3dwgjf,Ishakaru,3,Mon Jul 20 03:20:28 2015 UTC,"Well during the fight, especially in cosmic patrols, you probably don't want to be rooted for that long.  Plus it might be hard to actually click you.  After the fight, its not necessarily elitism either.  Everyone's playing inventory management and sorting all their own loot.  And then by the time everyone's done, other mobs might have spawned and, again, you don't want to root yourself.  Or maybe they're worried about making it to a side boss before they die.  Or maybe they got tired of going to rez someone and they respawn halfway through.  Its happened to me more than once.  It'd be nice if there was an indication someone was rezzing you so you could wait for it...just because someone's standing next to you doesn't necessarily mean anything."
marvelheroes,3dwgjf,droid327,2,Mon Jul 20 03:26:46 2015 UTC,"My general rule is I run unless I know I can't make it back before a boss dies. Since the ""tag"" on an enemies disappears when you respawn, I have to choose to be useless for 10-15 seconds sometimes. Either people ressing (which can be deadly in CMM/CICP) or Gaz keeping your tag even when you revive and are running back would go a long way to making patrols healthier."

Unless somebody said something, I doubt most people are looking down on you or anything for dying. Everybody gets hits by a Rhino charge every now and then.  I think most people just usually don't see reviving as efficient. If there were actually a respawn timer, people would probably be more willing to revive, but respawns are instant. That combined with the fact that you don't really get anything for reviving other than an achievement is why I figure why most don't bother. That's why I usually don't at least."
marvelheroes,3dwgjf,LyleShnub,10,Tue Jul 21 00:31:08 2015 UTC,Maybe its not about ego? Maybe its about the fact that people repeatedly die to shit they shouldn't be dying from and people are tired of resurrecting you?  It's not about being a snob. With the way travel powers work with most heroes you can res and be back in the fight within 10 seconds. Don't assume its people being an ass.

marvelheroes,3dwgjf,BeardOfWonder20,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:15 2015 UTC,"I res if I can but usually just wait until the fight is over, especially in cosmic patrol, just one hit from a trash mob can interrupt the process and that's time wasted fighting the bosses. Also, it's incredibly hard to see a downed player in the midst of all the loot and other stuff sometimes.  Instead of waiting for someone to res you, you can respawn yourself. If you get downed during a boss fight, once all of the bosses are dead, you can respawn and all of your loot will still be there."

marvelheroes,3dwgjf,Snoosnoo89,2,Mon Jul 20 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"It being so difficult to rez people is patrols is why i would spam invite people as soon as i got in the zone. I'd hit O, set to nearby, and invite anyone who was in Super heroic. I'd keep that window open until i had a full party.  It's too difficult to spot downed players, especially in cosmic patrols, even if you do notice them on the mini map. Plus, i dont think voice emotes work when dead, so you cant spam 'help' when downed. Alot of people play with the chat closed as well.  It's faster, but not always safer, to just rez and teleport to a (preferably ranged) party member. If you sit there, the game may think you are AFK and not give credit on boss kills. But if you keep an eye on the HP and number of bosses alive, you can make the right call with some practice.  Don't be a snob? Don't be so entitled."
marvelheroes,3dwgjf,hugeboxofporn,-7,Mon Jul 20 12:44:22 2015 UTC,"it's not about ego. it's about the community self-policing. refusing to rez someone who shouldn't be in the zone sends that message pretty clearly.  i will rez people who i see were actively contributing to boss battle, but only if the flow of battle allows for it and it wouldn't make more sense for them just to respawn and run back."
marvelheroes,3dwgjf,ProfJackAss,6,Mon Jul 20 03:40:14 2015 UTC,"refusing to rez someone who shouldn't be in the zone sends that message pretty clearly.   I could see your point if it were possible that every person at the fight inspects the persons gear before starting to rez.  But lets be realistic, that is not happening.  And I don't care how elite you think you are, anyone can die in CMM or CICP very easily."
marvelheroes,3dwgjf,notorious98,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:46:10 2015 UTC,"That's not self-policing.  It would be self-policing if you were yelling at them while not rezzing them.  In which case, it would be the yelling.  Not throwing somebody a rez when it's not necessarily common to get one to begin with sends no message at all.  Just that rezzing isn't a common occurrence."

I'm still baffled by the existence of the movie, over all the other characters Marvel could have gone with. When you stick him next to recent releases like Doom, Vision, Iceman... It just seems underwhelming.   And... If I'm going to play Hank Pym (and I'm not over the moon about him if that wasn't obvious), I want to see some Giant Man action. That wouldn't really have been feasible in an MMORPG setting with all the other characters normal sized, which is why I think they should have given this a pass.  I have Ant-Man as part of the Advanced Pack 2, but I haven't touched him and I don't know when I will."

marvelheroes,3dqtmj,Susarian,3,Sat Jul 18 20:48:29 2015 UTC,Most likely the Steam package is already in the works as an add-in to the co-marketing effort MCU affiliated software vendors. Remember the article about all the AoU game updates? Same thing with Antman. Co-marketing with the MCU garners free publicity.   As to why not pre-announce the Steam package? Either someone was late with the paperwork or someone else decided it would undermine a more profitable Gaz direct sales pipeline. An Antman package exists solely to drive new customers to MH. Existing players who didn't pre-order will simply use splinters to pick him up. I don't know anyone who buys individual heroes. Its all pre-ordered or splinters.
marvelheroes,3dqtmj,capt_action94552,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:14:21 2015 UTC,Spot on.  The idea that they were using sales metrics from 2-3 days then suddenly created a Steam Pack is ridiculous.  It being based more around MCU related properties is a much more sound theory.

marvelheroes,3dqtmj,4cibtr,-13,Sat Jul 18 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"It's you who's wrong:   Pre-order for Ant-Man was up since a couple weeks ago I think, hence, they only bothered to do it on Steam NOW, where people that wanted Ant-Man probably spent their money already since they only had ONE option. And options should always be provided to customers. I'm talking about Steam achievements, you know, the little thing that pops-up whenever you complete an achievement on most games on Steam? Warframe, another F2P MMO has tons of them. It's insignificant because a 15% sale is insignificant on itself (as other reddit user mentioned too) - but that's the norm with Gazillion overall sales, though, not only on Steam.

marvelheroes,3dqtmj,TheWiseMountain,2,Sat Jul 18 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"if you wanted the second costume, the pre-order was probably a better deal.  Otherwise, you can get this deal, and spend that 500gs on an Pym box and get some really cool stuff from it."

You could have gotten him a few other ways. Achievements are in game. If you want steam achievements then like you said, there are plenty of other games for you to play. Maybe you should play something like Warframe, which is another F2P MMO that has tons of them. You might be happy that a new hero who came out 2 days ago is even at 15% right now. Yay for you not buying things unless they are 50% off but I guess that means you wont be getting ant-man anytime soon unless you use splinters. Which again is what they are for. So I don't see why you are complaining about 15% since you obviously wont purchase it. If you are so unhappy with the game. Uninstall it and move on. This subreddit would be much more happy without all the vitriol that is constantly surrounding it."

marvelheroes,3dr7lt,asianorange,7,Sat Jul 18 17:57:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit of a hoarder too but I've recently cleared out some space.  Don't hang on to ANY non-unique gear for characters you aren't playing.  Waste of space!  You don't need those Urus either.  Unless they are 60 rating they aren't worth keeping for the most part.  You'll always get more in drops.  You may want to consider getting rid of event items if you are a far ways off from being able to craft them into something useful.  It may be a whole year of waiting.  I've also been pawning off a bunch of artifacts as well.  Some really aren't worth keeping.  Good rule of thumb is that if it isn't highly sought after, and isn't something that you plan on using on a level 60 hero, then junk it.  Don't hoard Team-Up Gear either.  If you find an epic, compare it with one that you already have and if it's better, then switch it and junk the other.  Don't hang on to it unless it's cosmic.  Oh, and cosmics.  Junk 'em 99% of the time once you get uniques.  Hang on to duplicate uniques and trade them for the 50 - 100k chests from the crafter.  Use those to finish leveling your crafters.  Don't hang on to too many elements.  Collect them as you need them and craft them upward as much as possible.  You can always break them down later if you need to.  Be sure you aren't also leaving stray bits of stackable items unstacked.  Wasted space.  Don't hang on to too many costume cores, just one for the hero you're playing at the moment.  If you find another that you think is better, trade it out.  Costume drops are mega-rare (I've gotten two I think with under 200 hours put in and that's apparently unheard of?) so you will be hanging to to cores FOREVER unless you plan on buying new costumes yourself.  Don't hoard Team Insignias.  Again, just hang on to one that benefits your active character and trade it with better ones.  Don't hang on to an insignia just because you might think it will be good on another character - unless it's top rated and very awesome.  You're just gonna find more when you play other characters anyway.  Lastly, if you plan on playing long term, it's worth it to simply just pay up for another stash or two.  Gaz gives out a lot of shit for free (too much shit, as we can see!) and it'll give you warm fuzzies to throw some coinage their way!"
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,Nekryyd,6,Sat Jul 18 18:53:39 2015 UTC,Anyone who's played this game past level 60 has a hoarding problem. This is the stereotypical game for gamer/hoarders. Be proud of what you are.
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,smokeyzulu,-12,Sat Jul 18 20:49:55 2015 UTC,Anyone? Dont think so. Only stupid people does imo
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,Novars,8,Sun Jul 19 01:39:05 2015 UTC,Only stupid people does  does   Nice work there.
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,JayPag,3,Sun Jul 19 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"Most important thing here is that you're not even level 60 on anyone, which means that you can probably throw away EVERYTHING.  Ok, not really. Keep uniques so you can exchange them for credit chests/relic stacks when your crafter is a high enough level. Other than that, keep very useful + BiS artifacts and trash everything else (this list is not that accurate, you could prob only save the BiS ones from that list and be fine).   You could keep one of each level 50 uru, just so you got one, but no real need for more than that (I keep 2 of each, and since you pretty much only use the defense one and sometimes the damage one if the hero has plenty of defense, I haven't touched some of them... ever).  Only reason you'd keep an item below-60 is if you plan on prestiging (cosmic) and you've found some great lower level gear you wanna re-use later. But at level 60, if any item is below level 60 (except artifacts and ICP ring) it's probably trash and non-applicable as the level 60 gear will always win out."
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,bigbadVuk,2,Sun Jul 19 01:03:43 2015 UTC,"For the Uru-Forged items I just keep the +800 defense ones in my Stash nowadays. For Costume Cores the Regenerate 25% of your Health (up to 3,000) and +100 Spirit when you use a medkit Become invulnerable for 2s when you use a medkit are the most ideal ones worth keeping. You can't always get that for cores so I try to get at least one of that or the +400 Life on hit.    For medallions use this link: http://jm.shost.ca/useful-medallions/  For artifacts: http://jm.shost.ca/useful-artifacts/ For uniques: http://jm.shost.ca/any-heroe-uniques/   Note: where applicable I am talking about item grade 63 items also for the medallions I am talking about the Cosmic versions worth keeping in your Stash for the purple ones you either wear it on one of your heroes or ditch it.   Also getting more heroes to 60 (Legendary Quests help level you up quickly) means you can dress them up and free up some more space. For example more heroes at 60 means you can put the +800 defense Uru Forged Items on them and free up some extra stash space."

marvelheroes,3dr7lt,rainbowstrangler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"This is just how I play based on 8 months experience and being taught some helpful hints by my best friend who has played since the game released. Initially I was overwhelmed but perhaps you'll find this helps cut the clutter in some way,  I keep one of each max level Uru at any given time in stash, no more. They drop with enough frequency that I have never lacked one by the time my character has reached level to equip their first and final piece. I don't stash or equip level 25 Uru forged.  The only costume cores I keep, or equip, on anyone are max level and have at least one of these but ideally both -- Become Invulnerable for 2 seconds when using a medkit (more important), or Become invisible for 3 seconds when using medkit. Great if they have additional bonuses but those are the main features I'm looking for.  I bought a stash page for runes only, and I keep all runes I find on a single page. I never leave a rune behind and have yet to hit 99 count of a single one before I used some amount, so a single page holds all of my runes, rare and common. Because enchantments are so useful/powerful I figured $5 to smooth the process of harvesting those sweet powers by having dedicated rune space was a good investment.   Old uniques and artifacts. Aside from equipping unique items and artifacts during the leveling process -- I feed anything less than a level 60 unique to my pets, and reset the Unique Cybernetic Bonus if it isn't the best one. If I find a level 60 unique and am unsure whether it would be useful in some way, I search Marvelheroes.info for the item and see how many character builds it is tagged in. If it is not many, I feed the item to pet.  Relics - I keep all relics in my Team-up Hero's inventory. I have given some relic stacks of over 200 to my end game mains like Psylocke and Cyclops. Some relics I have yet to place on anyone, and the stack is pretty big but I want the right hero first.   Happy hunting!"
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,ccthibault,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:43:35 2015 UTC,I would only keep hero specifc uniques because once your crafter is lvl 18(I believe) you can trade 5 of the same for a credit chest or 4 for a stack of 50 relics. Urus and the rest is pretty easy to get.
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,hugeboxofporn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"uru: i keep a handful of each type (including 25s and 50s) to use on future heroes. these can be stored in any hero stash tab.  costume cores: i have a crafting tab full of these. only keep level 60 cores. only keep those that have (at least) health/spirit on medkit or invuln on medkit. better than that are cores that have one of those AND 400 life on hit.   relics: keep 'em all until you get 1000 of each. store in standard stash tab.  artifacts: cruise the item and item trading subforums at the official forums. you'll start to get a feel for what is actually valuable. when in doubt, look up the item at marvelheroes.info to see how many builds it is used in. i keep a couple of stash tabs full of useful artifacts. all the less useful ones i sell or throw on the ground in hubs for newer players.  any hero uniques: pretty much the same as artifacts. always save the extras until you have 4 of them and then trade in for a stack of 50 relics. store them in a hero stash tab.  hero uniques: same as any hero.  insignias: learn (from the item trading forums) what good insignias are. press alt over the item to see if it is well rolled. keep good ones in a hero stash tab.  rings: i have a couple of hero stash tabs full of rings. as i find new ones that i want to keep, i throw away a lesser one from stash.  runes: one crafting tab dedicated to these. throw away or sell them once you have a stack of 100 for a type.  elements: keep 1 or 2 stacks of 10 pure elements only, break them down as needed."
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,MutatedSpleen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"I store any hero uniques until I have 5 of the same kind, then trade them for a 500k box.  Relics, I keep all of them in my active inventory (on the bottom row ish) because they are common pickups, and stack, then distribute them to heroes as needed.  I do keep bad relics (like the thorns damage one), but I probably shouldn't.  I have one stash for urus, although I don't know why, since all of my heroes (which is everyone) has a 25 and a 50 enchanted Uru, and some have two sets.  I only keep costume cores that are good.  They have to have life on hit and another useful stat, and I only keep level 60 cores.  I keep all artifacts except really, obviously bad ones.  I'll keep several of the common ones I give to my heroes while leveling (I pretty much give everyone a Xerogen Crystal while leveling, for example).  And obviously, I hold on to any valuable or rare boss artifacts.  Maybe I'm not so helpful though, since I have like 12 stash tabs <_<"
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,LilacMoon9,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:36:29 2015 UTC,"I, too, suffer from this. In every game I play, I hoard materials and/or gear...because you never know! I quickly filled up my bank in this game (and I just started again, no max levels either), so what I do is make some tough decisions; if it's not something super rare or something for a character I might play sooner rather than later, I sell it. Good luck and have fun! :)"
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,Phenotype99,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:41:13 2015 UTC,"My real question is what to do with all the damn Starktech Cubes. Every time I work on a new 60 I collect a fuckton of them, and I never want to use them because I don't know what skills I'll end up not being able to max with gear, and I don't have the best-in-slot artifacts I want them to go into, and hell, I don't know which skills will be good after a rework or change of build, and so I end up wanting to hold onto them literally forever. I've only sold the ones that are obviously useless, like movement skills or Cyclops Punch Combo, and literally the only one I've ever slotted is Visor Off on a good Advanced Metasensory Array."
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,droid327,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"Here's some basic rules you can just blindly follow for now:  Urus: equip them if you have an empty slot, sell them if not.  They drop very commonly, you can always get another one if you need it.  Cores: Under 60, if you're not going to use it right away, sell it.  At 60, only keep ones that have two or three out of 25% Medkit, 400 LOH, and 2s Invul.  Relics: Sell damage-on-hit and defense.  All the others, I keep a stack of each in my team up inventory and just move them over there whenever I find/craft them.  You'll want 1 stack of 1000 of each.  Artifacts: If you're not going to use it right now, then sell/donate it.  Anything you're finding at 50 isn't going to be worth saving, really.  Anything that doesn't drop from a boss is also safe to donate if you're not going to use it, because those ones are all common.  Uniques: Save the ones that are specific to your main (the level 50 one).  Try to match up sets of identical ones, which you can take your Crafter and Exchange for relics or credits, once you level your crafter to 15.  Any others (ie, any-heroes and other hero's uniques) can be donated or fed to a pet."
marvelheroes,3dr7lt,monkeybiziu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:12:17 2015 UTC,"Urus are easy: one STASH tab at most. That's enough for 8 of each uru. That's more than enough.  Costume cores: invul/25% on medkit, 400 LoH (all three is a trifecta). +1 Fighting, Energy, Strength, or Intelligence. Everything else is garbage.  Uniques: keep ones for heroes you don't have/haven't levelled. For heroes you have levelled, stack them up to 3, 4, or 5 then trade them in for credit chests."

marvelheroes,3dr7lt,moonsong99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:59 2015 UTC,"Sell, or donate uru.   Costume cores. Keep level 60's if they have at least 2 of the 3 following:  Heal on medkit(max 3000hp)  Invulnerability on medkit use  400 health per hit.  Sell/donate anything else.  Old uniques... uhm... I keep all uniques and turn them into more relics. That requires several pages to store them in though.   I keep all relics in my hero inventory. so that I don't have random stuff all over the place.  On other things, grind out those last 10 levels on your 50. Right now you get 3% extra xp. 10 more levels, and you get a large xp bonus bump.  chart:  1 hero at level 60 = +30% xp bonus. 2 heroes at level 60 = +20% xp bonus (50% total). 3 heroes at level 60 = +15% xp bonus (65% total). 4 heroes at level 60 = +10% xp bonus (75% total). 5+ heroes at Level 60 = +5% xp bonus for each hero (in addition to the 75% bonus from the first 4 heroes you have at level 60).

marvelheroes,3dqfzs,ejester,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:28:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I am so disappointed with this. I mean, we've waited mo ths for what exactly?  A reskinned Halloween event buff and flavor items that are utterly useless?  I mean, even getting 1....ONE token upgrade per event is laughable.  We should, at the minimum, be able to receive 1 ult token per day. That's 7 total per event. There are 50 heroes and counting in the game. I don't really think that's too much to ask for.  And the new uniques/artifacts....seriously? They're worthless. They will not be part of any top tier build. They're not even great for a casual player.  Again, we waited months for what is currently a giant let down.  I'm beginning to doubt Danger Room will be anything to be excited about and that I've wasted over $1k on a game that has no sustainable gameplay and leaving for greener pastures when Lost Ark or one of the other 10 games in waiting to release this year come out."

marvelheroes,3dqfzs,Drag0nthrax,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"No doubt. I don't regret it. I'd just like to see the game improve and steadily increase in popularity, which means more money for gaz, which then means more improvements to the game for us.

marvelheroes,3dqfzs,CosmonautDrifter,-2,Sun Jul 19 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"The reskinned Halloween Event Buff is one of the best aspects of the new A.R.M.O.R. event. Those events that used that design were a lot of fun to play. Especially as it gets people out of their ""Grind Midtown or ICP"" comfort zones.   I think one Ultimate Upgrade Token is more than fine per event. Most people only have one or two mains they play. And you do not need a maxed Ultimate to play normal content or even raid. Plus the primary means of getting Ult Upgrades is Eternity Splinters. That's not going to change. And likely has to remain that way most likely to prevent salt. Especially when you have some players wailing for Ult Upgrade refunds cause their main gets some sort of power tweak.  As for the event items... people had fits over putting BIS stuff behind event currency. So they designed some quirky items that are a bit fun... and could be good with certain builds and people complain they're not BIS. Mixed messages here.   And lastly, the Duck Gun quacks!! It's automatically the most awesome thing ever."
marvelheroes,3dqfzs,MHDarkBeast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:24:51 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with ARMOR being a reskinned Halloween event.  My problem lies with the fact it took them MONTHS just to do that? There's literally nothing added to this event that really pulls me in to play more than I already do. I haven't played a game this much since d2, so I'm obviously a fan. I have never spent the kind of cash I have on any other virtual game like I have here...so I'm invested and want to see this game and Gaz succeed.  But there's nothing here for me. There's nothing for players like me.  True, you don't need your ult maxed to do well in the game. However, for the min/maxers it's what we are after.  At the current rate you can farm enough splinters in a week to buy one ult token if you grind at it. So every 20 weeks you can max a heroes ult. So that's 2 heroes per year. Now if you get lucky with odin blessings or if you buy a bunch of the Mark 1(?) cards that have the chance to give them you can get more like me.  What it comes down to is ults are hiding behind a pay wall, that's just not right. It's one thing to hide stash behind it, but a game mechanic....not so much.  The items....to each their own. Some people enjoy having quirky flavor items that don't really do much. Some don't. I fall in the latter category. Unless I can rip that quack affect and put it on one of my items I see no point in having it.  But my main concern, again, is the time it took to implement this ""NEW FANTASTIC EVENT!! HYPE HYPE!!!"" and it ultimately was a reskinned event with some lackluster rewards. This has me concerned about Danger Room.  Danger Room is what I believe will make or break the game. If they pull it off correctly and it mirrors the map system in PoE and gives great rewards for reaching certain levels....then I think we have a winner.  If it's another Xdef/Holosim type of bs system...well...I hate to be pessimistic but I think the game will be dead within the next 2 years."

marvelheroes,3dqfzs,MHDarkBeast,2,Sat Jul 18 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"And a good example why they shouldn't be.  Too easy to acquire for how powerful they are, it just ends up being a ""vet check"" where new players are gated from it until the event rolls around again."
marvelheroes,3dqfzs,droid327,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:21:47 2015 UTC,"But its not a timesink to just wait for Cosmic Chaos to come back so you can spend 2 hours and acquire a Power Cosmic for your hybrid hero.  There's nothing a new player can do in game to make Cosmic (or ARMOR) happen faster for them, but once it does happen, the amount of time it actually takes to acquire your BIS items is trivial compared to the power those items contribute."
marvelheroes,3dqfzs,droid327,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:00:45 2015 UTC,"You just contradicted yourself.  If its trivial, then its not a timesink, and you end up with nothing to play for.  Other BIS items like artifacts and uniques take months of actual play to get a good one to drop/roll.  They represent a significant investment of playtime, which is what justifies them being better than anything else in slot.    PC/Power Doop/Doop Insp. represent waiting for Cosmic Chaos to happen and running terminal bosses for a day, especially since Doop runes themselves also became purchaseable.  They aren't justified for how powerful they are.    If you're a new hybrid character, you don't spend any time investing in your legendary or runeword slot.  There's no playtime to be gleaned from improving them.  You just wait until Cosmic, then those slots are done.  Other BIS event items would risk extending that to unique and artifact slots if they were clear, unequivocal BIS items."

All I really wanted to hear was an apology for it and a nugget of an explanation. Even if that is vague as well.  With this, it seems like they have this at a much higher priority than ""Next Week"".

By this you will support gaz and they will have more resources to get the game running smoothly and you will have a full roster waiting for you when you come back online ;) as well as u get 43 heroes at the price of 20. more then 50% heroes free plus their stash tabs and a lot of fortune cards!! How can anyone miss this deal ;)
marvelheroes,3dsazd,avatarofshadow,7,Sun Jul 19 00:01:40 2015 UTC,I've seen you advertising that pack about 200 times by now.  I'm really curious as to the sex act per post arrangement you're getting.

I guess its my own fault gettin carried away and have some extra money to spend but thinking about it, I have spent 75 euros so far. I'm not planning to spend anymore money soon but the MKII pack is 160 euros and I have already spend almost half of it...now considering I have 15 champions(not even half the ones the pack offers), 3 extra slot tabs and I still miss some champions that I would like. Now assuming I will keep playing the game for months/years I will end up spending some more money eventually, so ye...I should had bought that pack and the only thing I would miss is the skins I have and I could live without, specially with more champs from the MKII :p  My advice from now on if som1 asks me it will be: if you are sure you are here to stay and you have some money to spend buy the pack."

Then another month passes and you're all of a sudden at 10-15 heroes, 100$+ into it, and it's too late to go back since you've come too far and the $200 deal isn't that great anymore.

marvelheroes,3dqoby,Voykid,2,Sat Jul 18 14:58:17 2015 UTC,"Fun is subjective, so i recommend downloading Test Center and try to find a hero you'll like before obtaining him/her on the live server.   Join a SG. You will find raids there more easily. You can also do shared quests, one shots, glf daily and glf weekley for commendations. this method is slower than raids, but it's a start.  Omegas play a huge roll in damage. Farm them.  http://marvelheroes.info/ -here you can look for builds and bis artifacts/gear for your character. That will also help you a lot."
marvelheroes,3dqoby,AgentOrange7,2,Sat Jul 18 15:23:35 2015 UTC,"If you like leveling different heroes, why not keep doing it? Progression wise, it's not a loss--you get hero synergy bonuses, and an experience bonus per character. Eventually you will find someone you like, or go back to someone you already leveled.   I tend to swap around between heroes a lot, it's one of the major pluses of this game. Tons of different playable character styles."
marvelheroes,3dqoby,gaalia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"Other folks are giving great advice about heroes, so I'm gonna focus on the larger question of progressing to the next stage.  Raids are the absolute fastest way to acquire commendations, which are used to by the unique upgrade recipes, so they can really help you break through that wall. (You can also do the weekly and daily Influence missions and One Shots to get commendations, but it's at a much slower rate.)  Super Groups are a great way to find people to raid (and do SQs, one shots, etc.) with. I was skeptical at first, but I've had a blast hanging out with my SG, so maybe give it a try? (You can always leave with no penalty or anything if you don't like it. Find another, or just go back to playing solo.)  That being said, if you're not interested in joining an SG, the LFG channel tends to have a lot more folks looking for raids on Wednesday and Thursday, because the weekly raid rewards reset on Wednesday. So keeping it open while playing on those days is a good way to find a group. You could also ask on LFG if anyone wants to do a raid. Often people will bite if you're willing to initiate it.  Finally, there's a supergroup (The Immortals I believe?) who does weekly public green (and red) raids. It's a fantastic way to get your feet wet, because they explain the mechanics of each fight as you go along. You could do one or two with them, and then start running your own through LFG or just raid with them on a regular basis.   If you want something else to do instead of raiding, you can try to find folks to run Bovinheim with. You get a guaranteed 7 uniques, including at least one with a challenge bonus. Even if you have all of the appropriate items for a given build, you may not have particularly high rolls on those items. And the best way to get higher rolls is often just to farms tons of uniques and swap out each time you get a better one. (Plus, gathering lots of uniques gives you fodder for creating stacks of relics and credits--both of which are important for progressing to higher levels of the game.)  Finally, keep in mind that even as you're leveling and gearing alts, you're racking up Omega points. These Omega points will start to make a difference in how powerful your characters feel. You'll also slowly come across better artifacts, so your gear will get progressively better. (Just don't be afraid to take top tier gear off of an alt you don't use anymore to put it on a new one.)"
marvelheroes,3dqoby,unsettlingideologies,2,Sat Jul 18 17:19:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the Immortals that run public green and red raids on Sunday nights. Green raids have no reqs and red raids have pretty lenient reqs. They all go pretty smoothly as we have a good number of well geared folks that help out. I got my start raiding with them and ended up joining up with them cause they're a great crew and run great raids.

marvelheroes,3dqoby,PersonaJXT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:27:15 2015 UTC,"focus on a main character, gear him, do most sq with him and farm with him, because that character will be the fastest way to do these quests. if you want someone who can take a punch and is melee(ish) like cap (essentially brawlers), then try: moon knight, wolverine, hulk, thing, thor (hybrid), ms marvel (obviously the melee build), she-hulk or venom. there are other brawlers which i've left out, but in the end you'll play them all anyways. get your other heroes to level 30 and 50 for synergies and bonus xp to your heroes.  if you die too often, then you're simply not good enough and lack the gear to survive. get decent costume cores, relics (the only way to get decent numbers of relics is by playing lots and lots). go for the easier cosmic terminals (tm, ock, maybe shocker, certainly not doom), get yourself to use medkits and run away form danger if you're close to death. and don't bother much with raiding, maybe except of green muspelheim in a premade group (a guild would be helpful here). and you have to get the recipes for rank 66 and 69 plus decent rolls on your unique items.  also, this game doesn't really focus on endgame, it lets you decide what you want to focus on. clearly you'll need a decent pool of synergies, but it doesn't force you to do cosmics or raids. however you'll need stash :p"

Most people just buy Cyke for the synergy boost, but his Bouncing Beams is really fun for taking out huge groups of MOBs at once. Check them both out, I believe they're both 400 ES each or 900 Gs. I've always heard Ghost Rider is really fun to play with, but I don't have him unlocked yet."

I notice a scarcity of the big-time melee heroes, so perhaps that is the direction you want to follow. of those types, I have played and enjoyed Hulk and Juggernaut. I especially enjoy the Thing, but that's a personal preference for the character (which SHOULD be a big contributor to which hero you pick.)  There are also a couple of hybrids that I like. There is the Vision who can do both ranged and melee with fairly good effect; and Thor is the same. I like them both too.  Once you get a hero to 60 who you enjoy, check out the guilds, or raid suggestions. Trust me; if you ask for help online in-game, you'll get it!"
marvelheroes,3dqoby,elsofer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:14:59 2015 UTC,"My advice is to stop gearing your level 60's. Focus on that 200% xp synergy bonus. Once you get that, you should have 25 heroes at 60. Then you can look back at what characters you liked the most. Do SQ's, one shots, and influence quests every time you can. You should be close at least to full 66/69 gear by the time you hit 200%.   Other than that, get a SG (forum banned is currently recruiting).  Get in on green raids, take your best geared hero. Don't stress to much about taking your favorite hero. The raids are very short. Red raids, and Axis raids typically have omega req's (3k, and 5k in my SG at least and even then it's waved more often than not).   This game is setup for alt-holics. Take advantage of that. Stop grinding at 60 =-)"

Ghost Rider was so much fun but I had so many exp boosts because I popped everything I was hoarding and got him to 60 in 2 hours.  I didn't really enjoy him at 60 though.  Storm/Magneto is fun due to their aoe but I hate how squishy they are.  I can't stop playing Venom though.  I really enjoy playing him compared to any others.  I've decked him out with all top end artifacts, hela blessings and his legendary.  I've been told Spider Man is very similar to Venom so if you're not liking him you may not like venom.  What playstyle are you looking for exactly?  What other classes/specs did you play from other games that you really enjoyed?  As for raids I've heard that trying to queue for them does not work.  Sometimes you'll have to sit in LFG for 1-2 hours before finding a green raid.  I've yet to run across anyone rude/mean in this game.  I've done 3 green raids.  The 1st one I straight told the leader (I've never done this before but I know how to play my class give me a quick rundown for each boss and I'm good).  2nd one I told the leader that still a little uncomfortable with mechanics so give me a run down and i'll be good.  3rd one just went in and pwned face.  Now I may just be lucky I came across 2 raid leaders that were nice.  Look for a supergroup too... That'll help you raid.  There are plenty of them out there looking for someone like you to help fill their roster so they don't have to pug people."

People started farming for it hardcore when the contest started thinking that it worked like that, and literally nobody got one until today, 10 days after the contest started.   At that pace, if its that rare of a random drop, they might not even find 5 winners before the contest ends, so its a lot more likely they're on a time-release to ensure the contest will last most of the month."

If its the latter, then  actually 'farming' for it (as in trying to farm high density areas to maximize drop chances) is a waste of time, and it would seem there's no reason to do anything out of the ordinary since it will just be randomly ""gifted"" to you if you're online and the lucky chosen one."

Only times I knowingly bought two costumes was when I first started playing this game and got two Emma Frost costumes hoping that she'd be my favorite character to play, (Alas, I can barely manage to play her at all.) and when I bought an Invisible Woman skin and accidentally blended it and had to buy another.

As far as cores go, I usually just use the Swap Affixes function to transfer the core and affixes over to whatever costume I'm using.  Ultimately my goal is to have a trifecta core (25% Health/Spirit on Medkit, 400 LoH, Invuln on Medkit) for every character I 'main,' so I'm not really particular about this core or that because the core is inherently temporary until I score a trifecta and apply it to that hero.  For me, the only real time I'll place individual cores on different costumes for the same hero is when visual effects come into play.  Basically, red X-Men spotlight would look weird on a blue Cyclops costume, and a blue X-Men spotlight would look weird on a red Cyclops costume, so my Cyclops has a 'red costume' set of affixes and a 'blue costume' set of affixes to match the corresponding visual effect.  Other than the...one or two heroes I do that for, though?

marvelheroes,3dt8q5,voidsong,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:56:26 2015 UTC,"I own multiple costumes for each hero.  Generally though there is one specifically I like for each hero.  Black Widow I use the Fear Itself, but while I would prestige each time I swapped to the White Chase Costume because I liked it to and to change things up.  Any hero that was released in Advance Pack 1 & 2 that had more costumes released I sometimes go with them as well.  With the packs you get the additional costumes, which I like at the time but sometimes they'll come out with another costume I like more.  Such as Female Loki, Psylocke Mandarin, various other ones as well.  I like Rogue's extra she came with originally, but been heavily debating on getting Savage Land / Age.  Another example is I got Spidey Big Time Green Variant that I liked, but then Spider-Girl came out and I had to get it.  Once Spider-Gwen comes out (that I get from AP Teamup Pack) I'll be swapping to it.  Other than that most of the costumes I own for multiple heroes is because I got them in the grinder/bundles and like having each one in case I ever decide to go with that specific one."

marvelheroes,3dt8q5,Shiniholum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:00:30 2015 UTC,i have multiple costumes for Jean and my dream about that would be the following :  split costumes and core in 2 item slots   core keep the bonuses and kinda stay the same costumes become some sort of token once you click on it it adds to the costume wardrobe and you can change it from the gear page in 1 click without having it taking space in the inventory ( like costumes n the game Wakfu )   this way i could switch between my costumes when and where i want without having to transfer bonus and shit :)  can't use twice the same token this way you can't have twice the same in wardrobe ( in the most amazing world you would have the possibility to turn the costume back into a token if you wanna blender it but imo that would be too much to ask )  this way i could switch between my costumes when and where i want without hving to transfer bonus or having to have the costumes in my inventory that would be amazing  as for the reason why i have multiple costumes well amazing costumes keep getting release for Jean even the upcoming one is awesome so i ll have to buy it too lol that will be my fourth jean costume
marvelheroes,3dt8q5,evnstranger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:34:13 2015 UTC,I do for a few heroes. If I dedicate a lot of time to a hero i reward myself with a costume. If I dedicate insane time (cosmic prestige+) then I get a few and swap it up from time to time. Also I have many many costumes from trading in costumes for free random ones but I know that's not what you meant.
marvelheroes,3dt8q5,Drag0nthrax,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:00:28 2015 UTC,"I do have multiple costumes for some heroes because I want the classic/original costumes (e.g., Thor, Iron Man, Magneto, etc.) I don't have any of the enhanced, but I'm thinking about Ant-Man's. But I'm an old comic fan, so I LIKE the original costumes, for the most part. And of course, I got the Hulk's holiday outfit last X-Mas back one, so I use that.  Usually, I pick one costume that I really like best, and just buff that up. If I truly can't decide, then I just gear up two costumes; it's not that hard to find goodies. I suppose that's not the endgame/raid efficient method... but I'm playing for fun as much as for farming, so there you go. Again... I'm a very old comics guy, so I make funny decisions.

marvelheroes,3dpye1,gtuffli,3,Sat Jul 18 21:37:28 2015 UTC,"The Cosmic Trial must be completed on each hero you wish to enter into Cosmic Midtown or Cosmic Industry City.  A particular hero only needs to complete it once.  There is no discrete gear check - if you have mad skillz and can pass it with suboptimal gear, more power to you.  In the shipped version, you won't be able to swap heroes either in the Cosmic Trial itself or either of the Cosmic Patrols.  Regarding the difficulty, right now, due to hero balancing, it is set fairly low - you aren't supposed to be going into it with a fresh 60 of any kind, in other words.  We are, however, also working on Red level 60 versions of Midtown and Industry City."
marvelheroes,3dpye1,gtuffli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:13:47 2015 UTC,Red versions of MM and ICP? That seems...unnecessary. Wouldnt fresh 60's just use that for a few hours in total? I'd rather they finally tune X-def/holosim loot.
marvelheroes,3dpye1,gtuffli,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"Depends very much on your playstyle, hero played, skill, play pattern.  There was, actually, a fair amount of feedback originally requesting this, so we looked at the number of instances and from that determined we could comfortably support it.  As for X-Defense/Holo-Sim loot, that is still happening, but it's a much more complicated proposition since we want to do more than just turn up the amount of loot, but see if we can possibly get some loot specific to those modes in there."
marvelheroes,3dpye1,holderup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"If Red patrols happen, i hope its a viable gearing option to getting ready to try the Cosmic Gate trial. My first thought was adding 2 more difficulties to patrols would spread us out thinner and make patrols less fun, but then i realized that that may be a good thing if it reduces lag in general.   Thanks for the bit of insight into the Xdef/holosim loot changes. Usually when i lurk on the forums and a dev mentions it, it's just to say that it's still on the table."
marvelheroes,3dpye1,Arcath_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"On the issue of gearing, yes, that's the main reason for it.  On the issue of spreading people out, it won't likely, since there are a LOT of instances of Midtown and ICP running at pretty much any time of the day, so any number less than full is something else, not people not playing those bands."

marvelheroes,3dsxw9,presidenttrex,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:04:26 2015 UTC,"Couple of things at work with her:  The biggest market for digital comic sales has been young women who are already accustomed to reading manga and webcomics on tablets. It's been important to push growth on Kindles and iPads to show publishers and buyers to take a long look at that market.  She's a teen outsider discovering her powers (a la the original X-Men, Spiderman, Young Avengers) and historically, without the decades of associated back story to get caught up on, those kind of characters tend to be a hit with Marvel. Her costume was specifically designed for cosplay opportunities (Much like the new Batgirl, Carol Danvers).  Honestly, it's a fun read. I was a DC guy forever and I didn't know or understand a lot of the Inhumans stuff until I started with that event. It's been easy to follow and everything from the lettering to the characters feel like stuff from an indie title rather than anything from the big two.  It's not everyone's cup of tea, and I wonder if her comic popularity will translate to the game (which are two different audiences) but I would kill to have her out as a team up, nerding out everytime I walk past Captain America or Hulk."
marvelheroes,3dsxw9,WhatImMike,3,Sun Jul 19 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"That's cool. Seems like a money grab ""let's get a character to appeal to a new market"" type of character. I see. She still needs her own name though. Ms. Marvel to me is Carol Danvers."

But I still really wished they voted in a different way. One that showed what everyone wanted, rather than what a majority of what people wanted. Basically like this. It still wouldn't have been too much different, I imagine, Magik likely would have won, but like many people speculated, there are two kinds of votes in that poll: votes and X-votes. I'm happy with Magik, so I don't feel like there was a great injustice, but I'm also just unhappy with inefficient voting."
marvelheroes,3dsxw9,Burracka,-1,Sun Jul 19 04:49:20 2015 UTC,i feel that the poll was already stacked. Gaz knew already that that a majority of people wanted Magik and so they threw in some heroes that would barley make a voting challenge to her.   Milers Morales ? yes he got some votes but we all know he was not going to win. Now if they put in Carnage then it would for playable then it would be a challenge.
marvelheroes,3dsxw9,mirrorell,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:05:34 2015 UTC,"Magik shouldn't even have been in that poll -- after being hinted and teased so much, it was surprising that she wasn't a dedicated surprise or the 12th hero for AP2.  Nick Fury, on the other hand, should have been this year's surprise hero. If not him, it should be Beast. -- although I speculate that we won't have a surprise hero this year.  GG was a solid nominee for the poll; it just happened that they included Magik who, for the reasons stated above, was an obvious winner.   It was also surprising to not see Jubilee and Beast as nominees since they've also been asked for so much and have a real fan cult in the playerbase.  The rest were obviously executively meddled by Marvel to promote their upcoming new series.    Of course, I voted for Magik(since I've been pitching for her since Colossus was released) but it just wasn't satisfying to see such a horribly implemented lineup when 2-3 of the hero choices shouldn't have been a choice at all."
marvelheroes,3dsxw9,TheSaintDennis,-3,Sun Jul 19 05:19:46 2015 UTC,"It also feels in-genuine to have such polls, honestly. I get why they have them, but it's not really showing what the community as a whole wants, but what a majority standing group wants. Same with the Enhanced Skin poll. I think the addition of Beast or Jubilee would have broken up some of the X-Votes and shown how fickle single vote polls are.   But I like the sentiment that they went with characters who were more longshots. I'd rather that the whole point of the poll was that, honestly. Instead of being characters who would obviously be in AP3, they went with characters like Kamala or Miles, who are newer or esoteric and less likely to be characters entirely championed by the community, like Black Bolt, Magik, Jubilee, and Beast.   Either way, I expect Black Bolt, Jubilee, Beast, and the other characters in the poll to be in AP3. Gaz certainly seems to understand they're wanted. Now, just to get enough support for Robbie Reyes and Fantomex."

marvelheroes,3dr4kx,AJMickna2014,0,Sat Jul 18 22:29:30 2015 UTC,you're not using all your synergies... twitch
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,RocaW,5,Sat Jul 18 11:22:30 2015 UTC,"In the video, Iron Man is already in the instance. He fights Green Hydra, then Madame Hydra, then Red Hydra, then Red Skull. The video ends before the fight with Red Skull ends.  So I still wonder what happens if you pass or fail the cosmic gate test. Do you get an achievement? A passport into Cosmic Midtown? A handshake and a smile?"
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,ElectricZee,7,Sat Jul 18 12:21:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe an achievement, but it's basically a way to qualify for Cosmic MM.  Also it may get annoying doing it on every character but just think about what the trial is doing.   It's keeping cosmic MM from being what it is right now.. a bunch of completely under geared people jacking up your enemy's HP and contributing almost nothing.  I'll take solace in that."
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,ledbetterus,2,Sat Jul 18 17:54:05 2015 UTC,"1376 suit power :(  i'm like 400 short of that. also my repulsor barrage brutes for less than 90k, his is 170k+  is this what omegas do for your character? i assume he's capped where i'm sitting at 850 or so."
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,kestenovski,3,Sat Jul 18 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, its a big boost having maxed omegas. Keep working on them."
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,EMFCK,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:15 2015 UTC,Yes and it's the main reason people shouldn't be doing content they are not equipped to handle.
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,CosmonautDrifter,0,Sat Jul 18 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"well i'm sorry but i don't think the entrance ""fee"" should be 7500 omegas, more like proper uniques, well ranked and suitable legendary as well with proper and blessed artifacts.   i don't think anyone should be excluded from doing the cosmic patrols because they didn't play the game for a year (time estimated by the developers for a casual player to reach omega cap)."
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,kestenovski,5,Sat Jul 18 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't say 7500 omegas...more like 2.5k. The other thing is that omegas don't really do anything for defensive stats, they are for the most part pure offense. The thing that is getting people on shot is that they are not min/maxing the stats on their uniques and they don't know how to dodge attacks. So yes, I do agree with you that for the most part people really only need proper BiS items, but they also need to not be bad.  Also, this is END GAME modes. So yes, it should take you a while and people should be excluded because...you know...this is what you do once you've been there and done that with everything else in the game."
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,CosmonautDrifter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:43:14 2015 UTC,fair enough... 2.5k omegas sounds fair for it cosmic patrols.
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,kestenovski,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:04:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I imagine it being 2.5-4k maybe. Not too bad.
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,Kirilli,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:37:17 2015 UTC,So how does this work?  If I go to the training room inbetween waves to save on buffs like odin or ES pots I would have to do a 5 min trial before I can go back into cosmic MM?  Does doing the trial tick down on my buffs?
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,gertymoon,0,Sat Jul 18 14:56:20 2015 UTC,"I hope this is harder than it seemed.  I get you have pretty much max gear on TC but aside from the Hulkbusters, nothing seemed threatening.  Even the HBs are just meh.  I hope they get the timer tuned right if mobs don't hit that hard."
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,ledbetterus,-11,Sat Jul 18 17:57:03 2015 UTC,This seems really pointless.
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,easypeasy6,8,Sat Jul 18 13:09:55 2015 UTC,No it seems awesome.  I'm tired of seeing 6-7 people dead on a boss wave just sitting around.  Under geared players are unnecessarily scaling up the HP of cosmic MM mobs and contributing nothing.  A trial is perfect.  I hope it's harder than it seemed TBH.
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,ledbetterus,2,Sat Jul 18 17:56:03 2015 UTC,Wrong.  This will stop the undergeared leaches from ruining people's gaming experience.
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,CosmonautDrifter,0,Sat Jul 18 18:34:25 2015 UTC,Do we have to do this trial every time we want to play cosmic because if so count me out.
marvelheroes,3dq7nh,easypeasy6,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:02:05 2015 UTC,"You have to do it per character. Once you pass it with a hero, you never have to do it again on that hero."

marvelheroes,3dqmeo,asylum101,2,Sat Jul 18 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"So pretty much identical to the actual poll, except that Magik's votes shift over to Wasp."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ohoni,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:27:29 2015 UTC,Ms Marvel or Wasp
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,FTL2410,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:30:37 2015 UTC,I guess a lot of people want Wasp after playing Ant-man
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,TheWiseMountain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:21:44 2015 UTC,Looks like most people who voted for Magik switched to Wasp - Sexist! (J/k)  I tried to vote said server error btw.
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,TRenegade,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:21:15 2015 UTC,guess fans are those atrocious characters are in denial that they really think a poll is skewed by magik. Its still pretty much. thank fk
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,Valexexe,0,Sat Jul 18 17:48:25 2015 UTC,"Magik will probably never be in a Marvel movie, but it looks like the Wasp will. I'm not saying the voting was tampered with, but the cynic in me thinks maybe."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,Shermer_Punt,3,Sat Jul 18 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"It's not a conspiracy. Magik does very well in every poll fan made or otherwise. If this poll included Magik and took place in some vacuum far away from Gaz's prying eyes she would still place at the top.   People like her. They like her teleportation, they like her spells, they like that she's Russian, they like her big ass sword, they like her demons, they like her story."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,MonzcarroMurcatto,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:10:37 2015 UTC,"Magik has a non-zero chance to be in the New Mutants movie from Fox.  (the reason I'm not saying no chance is that the Director apparently is a huge fan of the original comics and has said that the movie will be grounded in the supernatural and horror which increases the odds of Magik a bit. You know, in addition to her being the most prominent non-Cable hero to have been on the New Mutants.)"
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,Hohohahahihi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"Nah, Magik is genuinely significantly more popular than Wasp on every comic book related forum I frequent.  A more relevant thing to say however is that Gaz must have known that Magik would win a poll like this, so they essentially 'rigged' it themselves just by adding her to it."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,Anshardina,0,Sat Jul 18 18:02:14 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, why do you think so many people are voting for characters with very similar powers to what currently exist (as playable) in game? Is it just love/excitement for those individual characters?  I just saw Ant man and I thought the Wasp bit was pretty cool, but my limited knowledge of her character thinks of her as having powers very similar to his. Same with Miles Morales, having very similiar (though not identical) powers to spiderman, and I've seen it mentioned elsewhere that Kamala Khan has similar powers to Mr. Fantastic. I know variations would inevitably be made, but I just wonder why people are voting for things so similar to what we already have. Thoughts?"
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ShitShowHernandez,3,Sat Jul 18 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"Wasp would be significantly different. Not a complete overhaul, there would be some similarities, but at least as different as between the various ""strong and tough"" characters.   For one thing, no ants. She does have some insect control, but almost never uses it, so Ant Man's entire ant tree would be gone. The flipside to this is that she would have a lot more ranged attacks, similar to those Black Widow has. I would also give her an ability based off when she flew into Hulk's ear, where she charges an enemy, vanishes, and then they get hit really hard. ;)  She can also fly on her own, and should be far more mobile in combat, whipping around the field. Her movement powers should ignore elevation.   Also, she uses her growth powers far more than Lang does, so I would expect an entire tree that includes giant sized attacks (although I would wager that they haven't yet figured out how to let a character be giant sized at will).   As for Miles, he definitely needs to be his own character, but he should be a ""cheapy"" character like X-23 or Taskmaster, since he can borrow at least two trees worth of abilities from Parker. He should definitely have a third though, that includes stealth-based abilities and bio-shock abilties, at the cost of some of Parker's web-based options (since Miles is not as experienced with the webbing).  And Kamala can definitely use most of Mr. Fantastic's abilties, but obviously summoning other FF members or using fancy gadgets makes no sense for her. So again, they can make her fairly cheaply, borrowing what they can from Mr. F, but splicing in some Inhumans summons, or maybe Spidey, Carol, and Wolverine if they don't have the Inhumans models ready, and maybe adding a few more stretchy powers. She also grows to giant sized more often, so could borrow from Ant Man/Wasp.  Ultimately though, players want to play the characters they want to play, even if they are functionally identical to some other character, and in all these cases, the characters have abilities that make them different enough from the existing ones that they deserve their own character slot. Gazillion just needs to get faster at pumping them out.   For the Ant Man movie, Gaz released. . . Ant Man. The mobile Future Fight game, on the other hand, released Ant Man (Scott), Giant Man (Pym), Wasp, Yellow Jacket (the villain), and several unrelated characters. Now gameplay-wise they are much simpler characters than MH ones, but the models and animations are as good or better than anything in this game. I wish Gaz would take some lessons."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ohoni,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:46:10 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense, thanks for all the info! Would you think these ""cheap"" characters would come out at the 200ES level since they can be created so much cheaper?  I want to be clear that I don't think there's anything wrong with the way people are voting, I just noticed that my logic when voting was mostly for the more ""unique"" power sets (I voted for Goblin in the most recent poll), and wanted to better understand different voting strategies.   At the end of the day, I'm going to be excited to play the new characters no matter who they are."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ShitShowHernandez,2,Sat Jul 18 20:52:02 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense, thanks for all the info! Would you think these ""cheap"" characters would come out at the 200ES level since they can be created so much cheaper?   I would hope so, that's how I'd do it, but you can never overestimate Gaz's greed. ;)    I want to be clear that I don't think there's anything wrong with the way people are voting, I just noticed that my logic when voting was mostly for the more ""unique"" power sets (I voted for Goblin in the most recent poll), and wanted to better understand different voting strategies.    Well, different people come to the game for different things. Some come as ""Diablo heads"" and just view it as a game, just want unique gameplay experiences and the skins attached to those experiences are inconsequential. Some come at it as ""Marvel junkies,"" and just want to play as their favorite characters, regardless of gameplay. I'm a bit in between, but definitely lean towards the ""Marvel"" side. I appreciate unique gameplay mechanics, it makes the game more fun for me, but I still want to play as my favorite Marvel characters even if they had identical powersets to existing ones.   Gaz has to do their best to please both camps, even when characters are mostly similar, which is why they made Thing, Hulk, and Colossus in their initial release, even though the characters could have almost identical powersets, but they've taken the effort over time to try and make each as distinct as possible."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ohoni,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"I fall in between as well, but I'm not as in-depth into the Marvel Universe as I'd like to be. I'd much prefer playing the characters I like, but I get frustrated when they don't fit my playstyle for this type of game, or if they're just objectively not very good. I'm sure it's tough from a development perspective to please everyone."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ShitShowHernandez,3,Sat Jul 18 22:45:21 2015 UTC,"Wasp, Magik and Ms. Marvel are the most original out of the poll. Miles is pretty similar to Peter (obviously some differences), Goblin and Fury both have weapons and stuff = Black Widow, Winter Soldier, Punisher etc.   Ms. Marvel would HAVE to have like an entire tree devoted to growing (we don't have in game yet). Also...she would be stretching AND growing which is definitely not in game (she's definitely the most original out of all of them). I voted for Kamala on the forum poll, but I regret it because I like Wasp a lot more. I just voted for Kamala because I felt it was more worth it because she already had more."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ashtonknapp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:33:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize Goblin was so similar to existing characters (I just unlocked BW but haven't played her yet, and don't have those others). Now I'm even more excited to play her!  I voted Magik originally because I knew the least about her, and because she sounded like the most fun and original to me, but went Goblin after because of my own familiarity and the idea of a ranged+movement build with the glider."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ShitShowHernandez,2,Sat Jul 18 22:44:55 2015 UTC,I mean....Goblin uses weapons and stuff which we have seen in this game already. He's obviously going to be a little different but still.
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ashtonknapp,4,Sat Jul 18 22:48:12 2015 UTC,"That's easy isn't it? They like the character. It's the hero they want to play, not the power set. A Kamala Khan fan isn't going to be satisfied playing Reed Richards just because they both stretch."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,MonzcarroMurcatto,2,Sat Jul 18 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"That's completely fair and totally understandable, but in some cases couldn't these just be costumes, or enhanced costumes rather than new heroes? Like in the Miles Morales case for example.   I totally love this game for that reason: I like finding the balance between the heroes whose stories I enjoy and the mechanics that I actively enjoy playing"
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ShitShowHernandez,2,Sat Jul 18 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"Gaz wouldn't include Ms. Marvel and Miles in the poll unless they had radically different ideas for them, I imagine."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,amator7,2,Sun Jul 19 00:38:39 2015 UTC,I don't know why people think goblin would be similar to any existing character. Especially black widow (who I currently main). His whole premise is that he flys around on a hoverpad and throws exploding pumpkins at people. I imagine him having some sort of movement based build out of anything.
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,tramium2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:41:14 2015 UTC,So do you imagine him more like a Silver Surfer or Juggs with primarily movement builds? (Disclaimer: I don't have and haven't played either SS or Juggs)
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ShitShowHernandez,2,Sun Jul 19 00:43:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I sort of imagine a punisher on a surfboard if anything.  His hover thing has had various launchers and missles at times.  His pumpkins are grenades.  But he should definitely have cheap fast movement ability that hurts.
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,The_Keto_Warrior,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:13:41 2015 UTC,And that big slow movement AOE he always does in MM
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ShitShowHernandez,-2,Sun Jul 19 01:23:47 2015 UTC,"there's a notable amount of players in the vocal minority (aka the active forum people who actually bother voting, but which don't 1:1 reflect the opinions of the whole userbase at large) who only care about female heroes, and would vote for whatever the coolest looking female hero on the poll is no matter what. they could put some heavy hitters (as in popular) like carnage, agent venom, goblin, and put a single female hero in the list. no matter how unpopular the one female hero is, she'd still pull at least 30% because the subset of ""i only play girls"" players would mass vote her like they did with magik.  this is also why wasp would have easily won if the female vote wasn't split between her and magik (a more popular hero). you see a LOT of ""well wasp would have been my 2nd choice"" comments among magik voters.   i would be interested in seeing them hold a second poll between the two finalists"
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,shilfee,2,Sat Jul 18 19:11:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know that this is true. I play heroes of both genders, but of that list provided, my personal preferences would be Magik>Wasp>Miles>Fury>Kamalah>Goblin. If Agent Venom had been an option I would still put him just under Wasp.   It's not really a male/female thing though, it really has more to do with most of my favorite male heroes already being in the game. Spidey, Nightcrawler, Nova, Star Lord, Rocket, Cap, Iron Man, etc., while a lot of interesting female heroes aren't yet."
marvelheroes,3dqmeo,ohoni,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:31:57 2015 UTC,Wasp definitely would've won if Magik hadn't been included.

I wrote to support and Jeff (looks to be the same one you got) told me it was because I got it out of a fortune card.  Funny thing is I didn't open any fortune cards till after I opened all the boxes.  Not to mention no Fortune Card gives it.  Only the Avenger's Mystery Boxes did.  So I had to reply back with what happened, there's no FC with it and where it only comes from.  Just waiting on them to respond back.  Though I wish they'd fix my missing boost ticket first :p"
marvelheroes,3do9us,evnstranger,3,Fri Jul 17 23:13:48 2015 UTC,It's insane to me that someone downvoted you (but I righted the wrong.) Do they really expect you to buy more from Gaz after they failed to deliver a solution to a pretty serious issue?
marvelheroes,3do9us,DurdensWrath,4,Sat Jul 18 03:33:20 2015 UTC,"I was would summit a new ticket, dont mention the box, just your purchased costume being missing. Your account keeps track of all your purchases, and they can see what was added at their end. Companies get tons of tickets during times like a crash, and some times they rush through them.

marvelheroes,3drqen,dkphxcyke,3,Sat Jul 18 20:38:59 2015 UTC,I get that the XP displays differently but is it actually bugged?  It's always displayed like that AFAIK but everything else levels normally.  I know my Team-Ups level fine on a cosmic character at least.
marvelheroes,3drqen,ledbetterus,3,Sat Jul 18 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"It still gives you the full amount afaik, it just shows up as less, just like how you get a bunch omega orbs each level while leveling your cosmic prestige character, while a regular char will get a few per level due to how much exp is needed."
marvelheroes,3drqen,kiyouri,2,Sat Jul 18 21:34:42 2015 UTC,Just opened 3 boxes on my cosmic 60 MK and got full xp.
marvelheroes,3drqen,WhatImMike,2,Sat Jul 18 21:40:26 2015 UTC,Nope Not bugged.  Working fine. XP Display from Odin Box 900-5000 an orb.  XP gained on legendary ~1.3 million.
marvelheroes,3drqen,tadhgadams,2,Sat Jul 18 21:52:09 2015 UTC,"Has been working like this for months, the exp shown is only for character exp. Omega, legendary or teamup exp isnt affected by the cosmic exp penalty to begin with."
marvelheroes,3drqen,Klont86,3,Sat Jul 18 21:58:32 2015 UTC,This was a big concern when cosmic prestige came out and again when omegas came out.   Watch the actual exp counter on your legendary.  It should earn full exp even though the orbs are reporting 1/25th exp when picked up.  If you verify the legendary counter is not earning the non-reduced rate then there is a problem but it should be working.
marvelheroes,3dmxgg,BelGareth,3,Fri Jul 17 15:59:11 2015 UTC,Yep.  The specializations are looking good.  Also being able to aim Cable's ultimate ala the Hammer of Dawn (from Gears of War) sounds amazing.  My rank 20 ultimate has been waiting for this.

With MH not working on his system, I'm not going to play either.  This definitely affects more than just those with 32bit systems.  Not to mention, he's missing events and daily logins because of the issue.  It has really bummed us out."

If the situation were reversed and this were happening to people running 64 bit (like me) I would probably quit this game.

marvelheroes,3dodnn,wasdy1,3,Fri Jul 17 23:00:57 2015 UTC,I would expect some sort of bonus happening to make up for it. Gaz has a pretty decent track record for making up for things. Its not like they lose money when they up drop rates or something.

Unless you or anyone else fully understand the issue it is safe to say it might be a bit of a complicated fix and/or they need to do testing to make sure it is fully fixed.  In all seriousness though, why is anyone actually using a 32 bit system anymore?"
marvelheroes,3dodnn,mjac1017,6,Sat Jul 18 01:27:28 2015 UTC,Lots of 32-bit systems out there still I'd imagine. Hell there's even gonna be a 32-bit version of Windows 10.

Finding the bug and fixing it internally is good and all but you can easily screw things up by rushing a patch out without properly testing it.  Now he could have worded it and/or explained things better sure, and you might not get to play for a few days but it's not like they are just waiting to patch because it's the weekend or anything.  It has happened before. They rush out a patch and it screws something up and whoops... time for a rollback.   I know it sucks to hear, but you need to be patient, step back for a few and calm down.  Or quit and delete the game. Either way, it wont get fixed any quicker."

marvelheroes,3dodnn,alkanshel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"This was my 1st thought as a programmer.  You have no idea if the code that fixes the problem correlates with other code completed just this week and the fix appears to work but the rest of the code is unstable.  Unless you're familiar with every single line of their code and can point out why they could simply release this tonight, it's best to assume they're not ""being lazy"" (which is a very lazy and ignorant assessment), and they would have pushed the code the moment it was done if they were able to.  I get that you're upset, but I also have no doubt Gaz are just as upset it happened."
marvelheroes,3dodnn,Rhodair,8,Sat Jul 18 01:50:43 2015 UTC,"As a programmer, I think they apparently don't ever test their own code."

marvelheroes,3dodnn,SpyderBite36,7,Sat Jul 18 03:19:15 2015 UTC,A bug like massively increased memory consumption is something the devs should be catching well before it gets to QA.

However, they also have a much more frantic release, so I expect some small bugs to make it through compared to games that patch every few months and grant extra time to harden their code.  I'm certainly not excusing this.  Game breaking bugs need to be caught, and I do also they need to refine their testing.  I've noticed a big improvement in patches over the years, so it's disheartening to see them stumble like this."

It's quite obvious they'd rather focus their resources on marketing and business than actually developing a game. Downvote and flame me all you want, but these are the facts. You're all blind if you can't see it. Save your money for developers that deserve it, as they would make much better quality games. Marvel Heroes is not a bad game (very far from it), the issue is the developer behind it. Gazillion is doing what any developer is capable of, they're just doing it worse.

marvelheroes,3dqors,zeCrazyEye,7,Sat Jul 18 16:02:23 2015 UTC,"Why would they need the 2015 tag? is a better question.   It was essentially a relaunch.  When it first came out, Marvel Heroes was a pretty awful game, and the reviews reflected that. So, after they had fixed those problems, they renamed and relaunched (essentially the same thing that other games do whenever they release an expansion), which meant that the game got a new entry in Metacritic with reviews that reflected the updated version. And this time around, the reviews were much more positive."
marvelheroes,3dqors,WhatImMike,5,Sat Jul 18 16:21:34 2015 UTC,It was a way to get review sites to re-review the game and differentiate itself from the deservedly poor reviews it got at launch.
marvelheroes,3dqors,Zukuto,7,Sat Jul 18 16:29:12 2015 UTC,Because the game now and the game at launch are almost polar opposites.   I'm also pretty sure you don't understand the use of the word hipster.
marvelheroes,3dqors,DementedJ23,-2,Sat Jul 18 16:18:45 2015 UTC,actually using Hipster to describe the 2015 tag would be apropos.  Marvel Heroes 2015 = cool game  Marvel heroes = uncool game.   people around long enough to comment on the state of the game at launch = i played the game before it was cool 'hipster'  hence 2015 = hipster   QED

EDIT: According to /u/Frankthebank22 red gives the same as cosmic.  EDIT again: I don't level in midtown or ICP like.. ever, so I didn't consider those places.

marvelheroes,3dmlg9,WilliamTellAll,16,Fri Jul 17 14:24:33 2015 UTC,"The affix range is determined by the level of costume core which determines the equippable level of the costume itself. If you don't see ""requires level 60"" then your rolls will be limited. Slotting a higher level core will scale up the affixes you already have, so something that's 99% of max will remain so."
marvelheroes,3dmlg9,carthoris26,7,Fri Jul 17 14:59:26 2015 UTC,"Hold down the alt key to see what the affix range is. Pick your percentage of satisfaction. I usually am ok with 90% of max. Then start rerolling. This can get expensive especially if you pick 95% or better goal.   Also, I believe the game assigns a percentage to your roll, so it does not matter what level the costume is at when you reroll affixes. Just use the alt key to see the affix range. It scales with level of the core."

marvelheroes,3dmlg9,EMFCK,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:02:04 2015 UTC,"Well there are a couple ways people attack it. My personal way is to use a Prestiged costume. Throw a random lv 60 core in it, and just roll it when i collect some Elements / Spare cash. I find it easy to roll a couple between waves in CMM or regular MM. Then when i get it to my liking, swap the affixes to my main costume, and use the old costume in the blender :P"
marvelheroes,3dmlg9,ThanosBuster,6,Fri Jul 17 22:07:55 2015 UTC,"This is inaccurate.  The way that rolls are calculated uses two factors, a raw score and a scaling factor (most often affected by the level of the item)  In this case, you are rolling the raw score, and while at the lower level there are fewer outcomes possible, it means that each number that can show at a lower level corresponds to more than one outcome at a higher level.  I just tested this again in game, rolled myself a perfect cdr at lvl 1, then attached a lvl 60 core. The affix is no longer perfect, but is in the top range."
marvelheroes,3dmlg9,jowshie,5,Fri Jul 17 14:49:46 2015 UTC,"This is a very common argument which uses some form of math of which I am not aware.  Your raw score is your raw score is your raw score. More raw scores will give you a shown value of the maximum at lvl 1 than at lvl 60, however that has no impact on what the value will be once leveled up to 60.   The easiest way to think of it is rather than a number, you roll a percentile. Using the values from your first comment, lets say that at lvl 30 you have a range from 50-100. No matter what level the core is, upgraded to, your percentile will remain the same. At lvl 30, to use your example, you have a range from 50-100, and you roll a 99%. That 99% gets rounded up to 100, and that is your shown value. If you then upgrade your core to lvl 60, you will get a value of 5970, which is a 99% roll in the range from 3000-6000.  It does not matter when you upgrade the level of the core, your roll is still going to range between 0-100%, the only thing you do by rolling the affixes at lvl 1 vs. lvl 60 is limit the information you have, since a wider range of raw scores corresponds to a single shown value."
marvelheroes,3dmlg9,jowshie,3,Fri Jul 17 15:11:53 2015 UTC,This is correct.   The fallacy of rolling affixes on a low level core needs to die. Much like the poison level of Daddy Long Legs.
marvelheroes,3dmlg9,Marv_the_hero,0,Fri Jul 17 15:17:17 2015 UTC,Yep. I believe the items at lower than 60 core contain hidden decimals resulting in what you pointed out.
marvelheroes,3dmlg9,Doomgrin75,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:33:43 2015 UTC,"Unless the roll is weighted differently at 60 (or the scaling algorithms are strange), it shouldn't be true that it's easier to roll high on a lower level affix. If your goal is a max roll, then you're absolutely correct, but if your goal is to get something high, but not max it's generally roughly equal.  Let's use your numbers to demonstrate. (I'm assuming equal weighting for all possible rolls.) At L30, if you're going for a max roll you've got a 1 in 51 chance and at L60 you've got a 1 in 3001 roll. Okay, definitely easier to get a max roll at L30. But what about a ""high"" roll? Let's say your goal is a roll in the top 10% of the max. At L30 you could roll any number from 91 to 100, so you've got 10/51 or roughly 1/5 chance. At L60 you need 5401-6000, so a 600/3001 or still roughly 1/5 chance. So with a top 10% roll, you're looking at almost identical odds. This will generally be true when you're trying to roll within a % range rather than hit a single number. The big exception is when the initial possible range is too small for the level of refinement you are using for your goal range. E.g., L30 is 3-4, L60 is 75-100 and your goal is top 10%. Your odds in that case are 1/2 vs 2/5.  TL;DR For most people who are aiming for an affix within a given range, it's probably equally easy to successfully reroll with low level affixes and high level ones. The smaller your range is for an acceptable roll, however, the more likely it is that you'll benefit from rolling low level affixes then scaling them up. If you want max, definitely re-roll then scale."

marvelheroes,3dla4w,Worworen,2,Fri Jul 17 06:23:53 2015 UTC,"True but before the story revamp, you occasionally run into 60s in lower chapters.  Right now, there are a whole lot more 60s in the lower levels.  I remember when I just started playing and saw a 60 single hit clear a mob I was struggling to fight.  I was in awe.  I can imagine the reaction of players who just started playing recently.  ""Where the hell are all the mobs?"" and eventually ""Why the hell is everyone else so powerful?"""
marvelheroes,3dla4w,twosmokes,3,Fri Jul 17 06:30:43 2015 UTC,It's definitely because of the legendary quests. There is nothing in chapter 1 story quests that requires being in the open areas.

This is from memory so the wordings might be wrong.  These below are from chapter one.   Subdue Electro Clear a certain number of Elites Draw the Hand from the sewers Discover Midtown Clear a wave in midtown   After you clear that, you get a few more.   Save a police officer.  Can't remember the name Prevent a kidnapping of someone. Stop the no-good someone. And one more just like the ones above.   Other than Electro, the four above is also hard to achieve because they seem to be on an invisible timer.

Another group of 60s waits at the centre of the map and races to the objective as soon as it pops up.

marvelheroes,3dn5as,ingen1,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:02:13 2015 UTC,Are you saying I don't actually have to buy him from the game store to pick him as a starter? This is what I am talking about FYI:  https://store.marvelheroes.com/wsstore_en_us/captain-america-hero-pack.html  Thanks for the help!
marvelheroes,3dn5as,Krythus,3,Fri Jul 17 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"You won't get the bundle itself, but you'll get him in his entirety from level 1 to 60 as your starter, yes. And then you'll also get 400 splinters to choose a secondary character with."
marvelheroes,3dn5as,Krythus,0,Fri Jul 17 17:16:47 2015 UTC,"So if I buy the bundle ahead of time, will I be able to start with any of those costumes? Thanks!"
marvelheroes,3dn5as,SurrealSam,6,Fri Jul 17 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"If you buy the bundle ahead of time, you'll get everything in the bundle, so you'd get the costumes, the stash, and Cap, meaning you'll be able to choose another starting hero because you'll already own Cap through the bundle.  But yes, you'll have the costumes as soon as you buy the bundle and you can equip them at any level."
marvelheroes,3dn5as,ingen1,2,Fri Jul 17 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"If you buy the bundle, you'll be able to swap between any of those costumes on Cap.   Then you'll still have a free hero to level to 60, and anyone else you can buy with splinters."
marvelheroes,3dn5as,QuorumOf4,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:00 2015 UTC,Hmm... I haven't started a new account. Last I heard you could pick one starter hero out of 10 to level all the way to 60. After the second day of playing you get enough eternity splinters to pick a second character should you want to spend them on that. Last month they gave everyone the ability to play any character to level 10 to see if you were going to enjoy playing as them.
marvelheroes,3dn5as,Chucklebuck,3,Fri Jul 17 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"They give to 10 heroes to start with to keep from overloading you, but you aren't actually limited to unlocking one of the 10. If you play until it gives you the roster tooltip, you can switch to pretty much everybody but doom, and unlock whoever you want as your first free hero."
marvelheroes,3dn5as,WhatImMike,0,Fri Jul 17 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"Apart from Doom, Magneto and Ant-Man."
marvelheroes,3dn5as,gaalia,6,Fri Jul 17 23:23:40 2015 UTC,"You can play everyone except Antman and Doom to level 10. If you buy them from the ingame store, they unlock immediately."

marvelheroes,3dn5as,droid327,0,Fri Jul 17 17:07:01 2015 UTC,Is there any way to start a new character with the Age of Ultron costume?
marvelheroes,3dn5as,Supra93,4,Fri Jul 17 17:11:03 2015 UTC,"all heroes start with a default costume. if you want a different costume, you must buy it*  *technically, you can put 3 costumes in to the crafter and get a random costume out. However this doesn't apply to you because you can't do that starting out, and the chance of getting a particular costume is essentially nonexistant"
marvelheroes,3dlj61,avatarofshadow,5,Fri Jul 17 06:27:16 2015 UTC,I don't know what was causing the rollback crap but were you using Odin or ES pots?  Every time I popped one of those I got DC'd/rolled back.  Took all of 3 times to figure out what it was and it never happened again.. or I just got really lucky.
marvelheroes,3dlj61,ledbetterus,3,Fri Jul 17 06:40:25 2015 UTC,"I've only DC'd from switching characters, but I did have one of those credit boosts popped so maybe that was why?"
marvelheroes,3dlj61,SnakePlizkin,3,Fri Jul 17 06:44:23 2015 UTC,"Dunno, boosts in general were all messed up, but I think it came down to mostly Odin/ES, especially since neither were working at the time.  I probably just got lucky in not DCing again anyway."
marvelheroes,3dlj61,ledbetterus,6,Fri Jul 17 07:02:16 2015 UTC,"I still can't connect, so GG Gaz."
marvelheroes,3dlj61,AnansiNeon,3,Fri Jul 17 06:55:13 2015 UTC,I took advantage of the downtime to watch Ant-Man!
marvelheroes,3dlj61,TheRamJammer,2,Fri Jul 17 10:35:56 2015 UTC,I had no problems and played for about 2 hours leveling winter soldier through story mode. Why is it only affecting some people and not everyone?
marvelheroes,3dlj61,SplendidRS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:06:35 2015 UTC,"Same.  I played from about 10 pm EST until the servers came down and didn't get DC'd once.  The boosts I was using were two different SIF and RIF along with a Penta Cosmic boost (or whatever potion gives 4 hour SIF, RIF, and XP at 100%)."
marvelheroes,3dlj61,notorious98,2,Fri Jul 17 17:35:02 2015 UTC,I got DCd and rolled back for picking up an Omega orb. The day I decided to use my rarest boost also. :/

marvelheroes,3dlj61,khrucible,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:19:57 2015 UTC,I DC by returning to base from a Cosmic Terminal run.  Game is unplayable in this state.
marvelheroes,3dndmx,brendamn,6,Fri Jul 17 18:00:43 2015 UTC,"I won't speak on matters of balance or tuning.  I haven't pushed his limits enough to have any strong opinions there.  For all I know, someone could come along and add ""died in CMM; 0/10 would not pym again"".  This is purely from a play-feel point of view.  I find him reasonably entertaining, but I'm not sure I foresee putting a lot of hours into him.  As far as pure-melee goes, he seems decently put together.  I say ""pure melee"" because while he has a lot of area and range, you'll still need fisticuffs for your primary source of damage and maintaining a healthy pile of ants.  I was sad to see that his dash-leap doesn't clear terrain.  While he does have a no-spirit fly power, I was really hoping his dash would work like Spider-Man's Agile Attack in that it can clear some walls and slight altitude differences.  The animation kind of looks like it should, but I get why it doesn't.  On TC, it was actually two tiny hops.  People felt it was too slow and so they reanimated it to be one large hop.  It's ultimately a very well animated but bog-standard dash and brings him down a peg from what he could've been for me.  The ant-resource isn't overly involved, for better and worse.  It builds and spends a little like a combo system, but works more fluidly.  For people who don't want to interact with it much, the ants also work as a fairly functional DoT, much like Squirrel Girl's squirrels.  As you hit things, you get pips of ants (up to 10), each also spawning as a swarm that attacks enemies.  This mostly works fine, but has caused me the occasional headache.  Each pip/swarm has its own duration.  Sometimes I'll get up to 10 pips, go to fire off my big ant tsunami (a massive, slow-moving, super-satisfying wave of ant death that costs all 10 pips), only to have a pip expire right after a hit 10 pips and just before I hit the attack button.  The expiration also means you can't lead into a fight with your dots like you would on a lot of characters, needing to either build up a few swings first or pop your cooldown that summons 10 pips first.  His spirit management feels pretty good thanks to his sig.  It refills about a third of your spirit and has a deliciously short 20 second cooldown.  Add to that that his ant attacks don't cost spirit and it becomes fairly easy to maintain.  He also comes bundled with a fair bit of utility.  Wall powers are powerful tools in the game right now.  He's got a stealth with a short cooldown and infinite duration (until you attack) and a taunt-summon.  His area coverage is pretty good and he's capable of quite a few dot layers.  His melee feels good with an insane attack speed (I hate sluggish melee spenders, so this makes me happy); the uppercut combo powers offer a forgiving but rewarding burst of damage.  On the whole, it's an interesting kit."
marvelheroes,3dndmx,axelnight,2,Fri Jul 17 19:17:32 2015 UTC,Sounds like he will be useful in Danger Room scenarios
marvelheroes,3dndmx,axelnight,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"I think if you can juggle a second action bar to make use of all his various utilities, he definitely has that potential to solo above his weight-class and avoid a lot of damage other melee characters can't.  Whether it'll be what's needed for Danger Room will have to wait until DR comes out.  For example, I don't know that he'll be best for a ""no med kits"" Danger Room scenario.  He gets improved passive healing over time, but no active/burst healing that can substitute for a med kit."
marvelheroes,3dndmx,WhatImMike,2,Fri Jul 17 19:52:33 2015 UTC,This 100%. I feel like I need more TTL to be able to compete in any cosmic content.
marvelheroes,3dndmx,axelnight,3,Fri Jul 17 21:24:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel his survivability is decidedly middle of the road for a melee character.  He's perfectly serviceable in most content.  His layer damage is very melee friendly, allowing you to dash in and out of danger without sacrificing as much DPS as many others.  But he doesn't have the raw TTL to stand in the flurry of particle effect death that is cosmic patrol zones.  Unavoidable raid damage probably isn't particularly kind to him either.  Hopefully they get around to revamping the game's mitigation system sooner rather than later.  I think it can only benefit him."
marvelheroes,3dndmx,WhatImMike,3,Fri Jul 17 21:53:03 2015 UTC,"I main MK so it's hard for me to understand why most melee aren't as tanky as he is. I know in MM on Lang, if I dashed in and pulled too much I was dead. Ranged ate me alive.   I'll probably throw some Lemuria on him and see if that helps his TTL a bit."
marvelheroes,3dndmx,axelnight,2,Fri Jul 17 22:00:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed.  His utilities like his stealth, wall and decoy are handy for bailing on a bad situation.  Unfortunately, that undeniably turns him into a two-bar hero if you want to exploit those (a second bar is not exactly where you want to keep your ""oh sh** buttons, I know).  And you have to live long enough to actually get those off, which... mhm, CMM generally doesn't let that happen.  In a contest of burst damage survival between Scott and Marc, it's no contest."
marvelheroes,3dndmx,WhatImMike,2,Fri Jul 17 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah Marc hands down. Right now Lang feels like a synergy hero at best, which sucks because he has a lot of potential to be really good.   I read on the official forums his uniques and GOM aren't giving him 50 points in skills."
marvelheroes,3dndmx,Gul_Ducat,4,Fri Jul 17 22:35:29 2015 UTC,"I very much enjoyed getting him to 60, and because I'm a sucker for thematic prestiges, I'll probably eventually get him to red prestige.  I can't tell you if he's worth a level 80 legendary. I'm short on Odin marks, so I've not even popped a level 60 legendary on him. I will say that, unlike the past few releases, I don't get the feeling that there's more than one really solid rotation for him, and that rotation is pretty simple: Tiny Takedown as your spender; Red Hots, Drone Strike, or both to boost Tiny Takedown's damage; Friends In Low Places to pump up your ants to 10,000; use Inch-High Good-bye+Fistful of Ants, The Definite Particle, and Big Foot Sighting off of cooldown. His ant generation feels low, so preserving his ant supply is usually my biggest concern; with Big Foot Sighting restoring spirit, I've not had any major spirit problems, even without a health/spirit costume core. And you don't keep your ants when you move to another map, so Friends In Low Places is usually the first thing I pop.  Oh, and his travel power doesn't spend spirit! So that's something.  tl;dr -- I found him fun and his damage output solid. He's got your conventional white guy voice, but his lines are pretty good; the earnest single father, ex-con turned hero really comes through. (But Gaz had never really had a problem with the lines they write!) I enjoy watching his gimmick of shrinking to punch people, and I like using his Bouncing Bullet ability far more than I ought to. But if you haven't unlocked all the heroes you want to play, then you might have 'better' choices to go with, first."
marvelheroes,3dndmx,SurrealSam,2,Fri Jul 17 19:09:12 2015 UTC,"Great review , thanks! He does look like a hero that could be surprisingly fun!"
marvelheroes,3dndmx,Dysc,2,Fri Jul 17 19:13:54 2015 UTC,Teleports are so nice.
marvelheroes,3dndmx,TheLordBear,2,Fri Jul 17 18:26:44 2015 UTC,Not using up all your spirit to get across the map is nice too!
marvelheroes,3dndmx,FatLute94,2,Fri Jul 17 19:05:37 2015 UTC,"I haven't used him extensively, but I have had a blast with his abilities and his theme. I was never a fan comic wise, so I was expecting a meh experience, but Gaz's effort to make him a fun character was not wasted. I have no clue if he is end game viable but he is fun and that goes a long way."
marvelheroes,3dndmx,ProtonixChaos,2,Fri Jul 17 19:54:07 2015 UTC,"I played him to level 45 or so yesterday.  He's pretty fun so far.  The grow/shrink animations make him stand out a bit from most heroes.  His damage output seems ok, but I need to get him to 60 to really be sure.  His travel power doesn't use sprit, which puts him above a lot of heroes that way.  Hes fun to level.  Not sure yet how he stacks up endgame."

marvelheroes,3dli5l,ShuQi,11,Fri Jul 17 06:15:01 2015 UTC,"All difficulty setting did before was actually set the level range for the story mode.  It didn't actually change the difficulty of the enemies, it just set their level, and a lvl 25 enemy is the same as any other level 25 enemy.  The way it was before:    Normal = Level 1-25  (Prologue = Lvl 1 ... Ch 9 = lvl 25)  Heroic = Level 25-45 (Prologue = Lvl 25 ... Ch 9 = lvl 45)  SuperHeroic = Level 45-60 (Prologue = lvl 45 ... Ch 9 = lvl 60)   Now, there is just:    Story mode = Level 1-60 (Prologue = Lvl 1 ... Ch 9 = lvl 60)   So if you were on Heroic Prologue before (lvl 25-26) then now, level-wise, you should be working on Chapter 4 (lvl 23-28).  So there may be a mismatch between where you were on the Heroic story before since the story was repeated 3 times, and where you are now since the story is just one playthrough.  If you mouse over the Chapter # in the waypoint list a tooltip will pop up with the level range for that area btw."
marvelheroes,3dli5l,zeCrazyEye,6,Fri Jul 17 09:20:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed explanation! It looks like it was just a lower level zone, as it became a bit more difficult again once I continued with the story in the next zone."
marvelheroes,3dli5l,SurrealSam,2,Fri Jul 17 10:21:44 2015 UTC,"It's a pity it doesn't just scale by groups of 5, because I now have characters that can't get to the end of the story mode because they're too low-level."

It just mentions that they are consolidated now, so that I assumed it would be somewhere in between those 3 difficulties or it would scale the difficulty automatically in the background, but at the moment it feels like it's similar to the previous normal difficulty - at least that's what I noticed while playing my character shortly before & after patch was released."

marvelheroes,3ditcz,castanets,10,Thu Jul 16 18:08:36 2015 UTC,"ANT-MAN Ant-Man has arrived in Marvel Heroes 2015!  Here are some highlights:  GET SMALL  Just like the new Ant-Man feature film and comics, Marvel Heroes 2015's Ant-Man has a number of powers that allow him to rapidly shrink in size. From tiny uppercuts that knock opponents up to amazingly fast punches and kicks, Ant-Man hits far harder than his tiny size. He also changes dynamically when using his powers, so you get the feel of Ant-Man's rapid size-changing capabilities.  GET STRONG  We spent a long time trying to figure out what to do with Ant-Man's synergies. As a commander of ants we toyed around with stats to do with summoning, but we ultimately came up with an entirely new level 50 synergy that we hope you'll love: +1 Strength. That's right, if you level up Ant-Man to 50 you get +1 Strength for all your heroes if you take his synergy. Tap into the hidden strength of the ant!  GET LEGIONS OF FOLLOWERS  Ant-Man wouldn't be worthy of the name if he didn't have the ability to command his insect legions. To this end players can summon up to 10,000 ants just by fighting, and then ""spend"" the ants on powers such as ""Fistful of Ants,"" which creates a giant fist of ants and smashes your opponents. One by one they may not be powerful, but under your command these insects really ruin the bad guys' day.  CONSOLIDATED DIFFICULTY MODES The Story section of the game has had difficulty modes consolidated such that players will level from 1 through 60 by completing the story.  To make grouping easier, there is no longer the concept of Normal/Heroic/Superheroic difficulties during Story Mode.  See the FAQ here for more information:  http://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/217042/difficulty-mode-consolidation-faq-in-progress/p1  MINOR CHANGES AND BUG FIXES A few client performance improvements are in this patch. Depending on your GPU and CPU, you may notice a difference (especially on mid-spec machines).  Fixed an issue preventing some movement powers (such as Juggernaut's Stride) from passing through certain destructible environmental objects. Interactable objects that can be picked up will still prevent powers that do not destroy environmental objects (such as Captain America's On Your Left) from passing through them.  Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause Doctor Doom's Primary Resource texture not to appear after changing Specialization Powers.  Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Specializations to turn off when transitioning between combat areas.  Removed tooltip for +50% effects on next rank for Silver Surfer's Power Unconquered since it doesn't scale for next rank.  Increased Wolverine Furious Assault Knock Up duration slightly to allow it time to actually play most of the time.  Comparison Tooltips for Items higher than your hero’s level are now displayed again.  Two more STASH tabs are available for purchase.  Team-Up Heroes no longer display an empty Spirit Bar in their overhead info.  The S.H.I.E.L.D. Rooftop Checkpoint Waypoint has been renamed to ""Crumbling Brownstones"" to help clear up travel confusion.  Fixed a bug that would cause Achievement Unlocked chat notifications to only appear while the Achievements window is open.  Fixed a bug with the Achievements Panel which would sometimes cause progress updates not to appear until the next time you logged in.  All in Doom's Time Achievement should now function correctly. He was using some mystic power to force failure upon us, but we sorted him out.  Iceman's ""Chill Out"" achievement should no longer count destructible objects.  Iron Man's ""You Know... For Kids!"" achievement should no longer count destructible objects.  Fixed an issue which would prevent clicking on some elements in the Cinematics Panel on the Login screen after viewing a Fullscreen Movie.  Windows Operating Systems: While running the game in a window, pressing the maximize window button should expand the window to the full extent of the desktop workspace.  Fixed a bug where audio wasn't muted when the game window loses focus.  Added checkbox in audio settings which lets player choose whether losing input focus causes game audio to mute or not.  Fixed an issue that caused defeated enemies to vanish instantly when ""Max Defeated Enemies"" is at its minimum setting.  THE TUNING CORNER Loki and Emma Frost uniques have been buffed to fit current item budgets and design.  Jean Grey tuning changes are in progress, coming next week.  Expect another round of tuning upgrades in August as we prepare for the release of Cosmic Ultron Mode and Red-difficulty AXIS Raid.  Rogue  Rogue's Electromagnetic Flux has been modified to match the changes to Silver Surfer's power as follows:  There is a 5s window after channeling stops in which Rogue may resume channeling at full strength Power gains 20% increased damage to enemies affected by her Attrition powers (stacks up to 40%) Spirit cost reduced by 50% Base damage adjusted to account for above changes Rogue's Accursed Beam has been modified so that the health cost is no longer modified by her own stats. The power's damage and health cost have been increased  ACHIEVEMENT HINTS The policy is the secret achievements are not mentioned, confirmed or provided hints of any kind. However, we do have some small hints for a few of the secret achievements.  First Achievement Hint:  Stay awhile and listen. The wind blowing through the sand and leaves carries tales of mysteries and bounties that would stir any pirate’s curiosity.  Second Achievement Hint:  Smith, Goldblum & Pullman.  Third Achievement Hint:  Maple Syrup, Back Bacon & Poutine.  KNOWN ISSUES Ant-Man’s Think Small power tooltip is slightly inaccurate, and does not specify that the Vulnerability applied by this power only affects the damage of your Ants powers (ant swarms or powers that spend Ant Pool resource such as Red Hots). This tooltip will be clarified in an upcoming patch.  Despite ongoing diplomatic negotiations, Dr. Doom has declined to relinquish Dr. Strange’s Classic Costume icon for his own classic costume, as he claims he finds our frustrations “amusing”. We will insist Latverian representatives correct this error in an upcoming patch.  Edit: Marvel Heroes 1.62a Patch Notes  Bug Fixes  Fixed multiple causes of disconnects and 'error saving character'.  Fixed an issue with the chat filter.  Fixed an issue where some boosts were not working as intended.  Fixed an issue where the GLF buff was not giving Influence.  Level caps for story mode Legendary Quests have been reinstated which will prevent you from being sent to lower level zones.  Discoveries and certain types of missions will now drop the correct level rewards.  https://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/219382/marvel-heroes-1-62a-patch-notes"

marvelheroes,3ditcz,Zukuto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:30:59 2015 UTC,"good thought, however its missing some flavour i think.  let me show you what i think.  lets start with Will Smith. he played Captain Hiller in Independence day. a role he says was based on Han Solo, from Star Wars.  Bill Pullman, a role he had was Lone Starr, in Spaceballs. a spoof of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker and other Scifi roles.  Jeff Goldblum has the most strained connection to han solo however. he was in Jurrassic park; the new jurrassic park movie was written by Colin Trevorrow, rumored to be the Director for Star wars Episode IX (based on IMDB)  So my assumption is this has something to do with Han Solo, or Harrison Ford; to that end Harrison Ford also played Indiana Jones. the newest Indiana Jones film is rumored to star Chris Pratt (star of Jurrassic World, connection to earlier) as the new Indy, who in the Marvel Universe is Star Lord.  so kill Brood Matriarchs X times as Star Lord.  ?  i am so in need of sleep."
marvelheroes,3ditcz,Zukuto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"to back that up, Lawrence Kasdan is one of the writers for the new Star wars movie; he also wrote Wyatt Earp (Bill Pullman) and in others frequently casts Kevin Kline - a tenuous connection to Will Smith in Wild Wild West, and wrote the screenplay for SW: ep. V. and Raiders of the lost Ark."
marvelheroes,3ditcz,Wizzle-Stick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"alternatively, all 3 of them (Will, Bill, and Jeff) are all said to be reprising their roles in Independence day 2. but theres no connection to Marvel here, other than the appearance of Broods.  lets try a different approach:  Will Smith acted alongside Paul Rudd (Ant Man) in Anchorman2  Jeff Goldblum acted alongside Willem Dafoe (Green Goblin) in Grand Budapest Hotel  Bill Pullman acted alongside Topher Grace (Venom) in American Ultra (not yet released?)  so strained connections. the search continues!"

Steam has my download taking about 5 hours from start to finish and, while much slower than most people here I'm sure, isn't all that bad in the grand scheme of things. I don't get to play content as soon as its released for sure, but I don't think waiting a day is a reason to stop playing MMOs.  I wasn't trying to complain about the size of the patch, I was just confused when Steam told me 5 hours to download it since I had never ran into a Marvel Heroes patch of that size yet and wanted to know if that was the size the standalone client users were experiencing as well.

marvelheroes,3ditcz,Doomsaw-Gazillion,3,Fri Jul 17 13:06:37 2015 UTC,Gazillion always bloats the crap out of their patch notes. I don't know why. It's terrible for me because I download patches at 120kbs.  I wish they'd fix it but maybe it's the engine their using.

marvelheroes,3ditcz,ElectricZee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"Patch notes copied here:  Ant-Man  Ant-Man has arrived in Marvel Heroes 2015!  Here are some highlights:   GET SMALL   Just like the new Ant-Man feature film and comics, Marvel Heroes 2015's Ant-Man has a number of powers that allow him to rapidly shrink in size. From tiny uppercuts that knock opponents up to amazingly fast punches and kicks, Ant-Man hits far harder than his tiny size. He also changes dynamically when using his powers, so you get the feel of Ant-Man's rapid size-changing capabilities.   GET STRONG   We spent a long time trying to figure out what to do with Ant-Man's synergies. As a commander of ants we toyed around with stats to do with summoning, but we ultimately came up with an entirely new level 50 synergy that we hope you'll love: +1 Strength. That's right, if you level up Ant-Man to 50 you get +1 Strength for all your heroes if you take his synergy. Tap into the hidden strength of the ant!   GET LEGIONS OF FOLLOWERS   Ant-Man wouldn't be worthy of the name if he didn't have the ability to command his insect legions. To this end players can summon up to 10,000 ants just by fighting, and then ""spend"" the ants on powers such as ""Fistful of Ants,"" which creates a giant fist of ants and smashes your opponents. One by one they may not be powerful, but under your command these insects really ruin the bad guys' day. Consolidated Difficulty Modes  The Story section of the game has had difficulty modes consolidated such that players will level from 1 through 60 by completing the story.  To make grouping easier, there is no longer the concept of Normal/Heroic/Superheroic difficulties during Story Mode.  See the FAQ here for more information: http://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/217042/difficulty-mode-consolidation-faq-in-progress/p1   Minor Changes and Bug Fixes   A few client performance improvements are in this patch. Depending on your GPU and CPU, you may notice a difference (especially on mid-spec machines).  Fixed an issue preventing some movement powers (such as Juggernaut's Stride) from passing through certain destructible environmental objects. Interactable objects that can be picked up will still prevent powers that do not destroy environmental objects (such as Captain America's On Your Left) from passing through them.  Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause Doctor Doom's Primary Resource texture not to appear after changing Specialization Powers.  Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Specializations to turn off when transitioning between combat areas.  Removed tooltip for +50% effects on next rank for Silver Surfer's Power Unconquered since it doesn't scale for next rank.  Increased Wolverine Furious Assault Knock Up duration slightly to allow it time to actually play most of the time.  Comparison Tooltips for Items higher than your hero’s level are now displayed again.  Two more STASH tabs are available for purchase.  Team-Up Heroes no longer display an empty Spirit Bar in their overhead info.  The S.H.I.E.L.D. Rooftop Checkpoint Waypoint has been renamed to ""Crumbling Brownstones"" to help clear up travel confusion.  Fixed a bug that would cause Achievement Unlocked chat notifications to only appear while the Achievements window is open.  Fixed a bug with the Achievements Panel which would sometimes cause progress updates not to appear until the next time you logged in.  All in Doom's Time Achievement should now function correctly. He was using some mystic power to force failure upon us, but we sorted him out.  Iceman's ""Chill Out"" achievement should no longer count destructible objects.  Iron Man's ""You Know... For Kids!"" achievement should no longer count destructible objects.  Fixed an issue which would prevent clicking on some elements in the Cinematics Panel on the Login screen after viewing a Fullscreen Movie.  Windows Operating Systems: While running the game in a window, pressing the maximize window button should expand the window to the full extent of the desktop workspace.  Fixed a bug where audio wasn't muted when the game window loses focus.  Added checkbox in audio settings which lets player choose whether losing input focus causes game audio to mute or not.  Fixed an issue that caused defeated enemies to vanish instantly when ""Max Defeated Enemies"" is at its minimum setting.   The Tuning Corner   Loki and Emma Frost uniques have been buffed to fit current item budgets and design.  Jean Grey tuning changes are in progress, coming next week.  Expect another round of tuning upgrades in August as we prepare for the release of Cosmic Ultron Mode and Red-difficulty AXIS Raid.  Rogue  Rogue's Electromagnetic Flux has been modified to match the changes to Silver Surfer's power as follows:         There is a 5s window after channeling stops in which Rogue may resume channeling at full strength         Power gains 20% increased damage to enemies affected by her Attrition powers (stacks up to 40%)         Spirit cost reduced by 50%         Base damage adjusted to account for above changes  Rogue's Accursed Beam has been modified so that the health cost is no longer modified by her own stats. The power's damage and health cost have been increased   Achievement Hints   The policy is the secret achievements are not mentioned, confirmed or provided hints of any kind. However, we do have some small hints for a few of the secret achievements.   First Achievement Hint:   Stay awhile and listen. The wind blowing through the sand and leaves carries tales of mysteries and bounties that would stir any pirate’s curiosity.  Second Achievement Hint:  Smith, Goldblum & Pullman.  Third Achievement Hint:  Maple Syrup, Back Bacon & Poutine.   Known Issues   Ant-Man’s Think Small power tooltip is slightly inaccurate, and does not specify that the Vulnerability applied by this power only affects the damage of your Ants powers (ant swarms or powers that spend Ant Pool resource such as Red Hots). This tooltip will be clarified in an upcoming patch.  Despite ongoing diplomatic negotiations, Dr. Doom has declined to relinquish Dr. Strange’s Classic Costume icon for his own classic costume, as he claims he finds our frustrations “amusing”. We will insist Latverian representatives correct this error in an upcoming patch."

marvelheroes,3ditcz,doomsdayforte,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:55:10 2015 UTC,Will we be able to play with our friends in story mode now? (if we are different levels)
marvelheroes,3ditcz,apochrist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, that's not in yet.  You're thinking of the upcoming Mentor feature where your levels scale down if you're too high for the content.  All that's changed is that you should reasonably be able to get from 1-60 in Story Mode with no boosts, so the difficulty curve should be much higher.  Like, Doom and Loki should be like fighting the old Superheroic versions and around the middle of the game should be like old Heroic."

marvelheroes,3dl5xt,ElNutimo,4,Fri Jul 17 04:07:03 2015 UTC,I'm seeing a lot of Antman with Wasp team-ups.  Hank can't be too happy about that.
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,Reaver_01,2,Fri Jul 17 04:20:35 2015 UTC,It just felt like the thing to do.....
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,ElNutimo,5,Fri Jul 17 06:30:46 2015 UTC,"Feels like Cyclops with ricochet bullet thing.  However, since there's a slight delay before he regains full size after using the power, you spend a couple of seconds trying to find where he will pop-up.  I like it though.  It allows you to hit multiple enemies while being in the thick of things.  Unlike Cyclops where you just blast from a safe distance.  His ant constructs are interesting.  His Ant meter will take a while to get used to but I foresee it being very advantageous once you get used to juggling that and the spirit meter.  It's basically a second spirit meter with it's own set of powers.  Should be useful in late and endgame.  I read some people mentioning him to be squishy at low levels but I don't seem to have that problem yet.  Maybe it's because I'm taking my time in story mode where enemies don't really swarm you and they are using him in Terminals and Challenges where you get an orgy of grunts charging at you."
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,Reaver_01,3,Fri Jul 17 04:27:49 2015 UTC,"Didn't put anything into ricochet bullet. How is it?  I have been using his moves that combo up and I am loving him so far. At work and don't remember names, but basically this rotation: Summon tons of ants > flying red ant cloud > attack with move powered up by flying red ant cloud > use punch that powers up ant punch > ant punch within 4 seconds.  He clears trash fairly quick and at least did some work on midtown bosses and the terminals I was doing for legendary quests.  I got him to 30 last night and didn't get a chance to try out his sig, but I see that maybe going towards the end of his move rotation maybe when you start running out of ants?  IDK."
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,ElNutimo,2,Fri Jul 17 06:36:00 2015 UTC,"Ricochet Bullet feels OP in the first few levels.  I was one hit clearing 4-5 grunts at level one or two in the prologue.  It gets more fun later on though.  Ricochet Bullet to end up in the middle of the mob followed by whatever flavor you fancy.  IIRC, his basic and some of his spirit powers power up the ant meter and I think he has an ant or basic power that powers up the spirit meter.citation needed.  Cycle between basic/ant/spirit and you've got never-ending spirit/ant meters.  Edit: words."
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,Reaver_01,2,Fri Jul 17 06:48:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah. pretty much any of his punching moves generate ants, so I have been using his powered punch as main move.  I may have to stick a few points into ricochet to try it out."
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,Ishakaru,2,Fri Jul 17 07:01:37 2015 UTC,"The ability that fills his ant meter has a passive that states any non ant power will give ants. Not 100% on the specifics atm, because at work."
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,ElNutimo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:29:42 2015 UTC,Do u think that he will be really good in late game?
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,ProfJackAss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:38:32 2015 UTC,"I'm only level fifteen and haven't played endgame with my other characters yet but I do feel that having basically two spirit meters will be a big advantage late and end-game.  IIRC, he has hits that charge the ant meter and hits that charge the spirit meter.  Find the right combination cycle and you're basically playing the piano non-stop going through mobs and bosses."
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,eccentrickd,3,Fri Jul 17 04:46:09 2015 UTC,"Im finding him pretty enjoyable.  Hit 40 before I logged off.  Kills fast, has decent survivability.  I'm not a big melee fan though so I don't know if I will continue playing him at 60."
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,matlockheed,2,Fri Jul 17 05:10:25 2015 UTC,I think he's a blast. Quicker than a hiccup. Gets all big and stompy. I wish he had a Godzilla mode like Loki's ultimate but it's all good. I will probably get the Pym skin someday too. Haven't gotten much of his unique gear yet.
marvelheroes,3dl5xt,TheGreatZeus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:44:12 2015 UTC,"I'm closing on level 60 with him now and he's been a fun level.  In the first few levels, he felt super-squishy, but in the later levels I haven't dipped until 50% health.  He feels to me like a combination of Squirrel Girl (because a lot of the time you're just looking to keep the ants in a specific place) and Daredevil (because of the Ricochet Bullet bouncing you everywhere).  The two meter thing is cool because you never really run out of things to do.  Usually you end up using Ant powers until you run out of them and then start bouncing around until your Ants are on recharge and then you start sending them out again.  He's definitely been one of the more enjoyable levelings I've needed to do in a while (a few of them felt like a chore)."

She has ok survivability IMO because she is very easily one hit killed in many situations, or teleporting down a road and instantly dying from 1 - 2 seconds of lag but for the most part as long as you don't suffer from lag she doesn't die unless you start playing reckless.

marvelheroes,3dj0ib,emdeemcd,3,Thu Jul 16 17:40:45 2015 UTC,Pretty much there are no more difficulty modes. Before you'd run the story 3 times on your way to 60. Now it's scaled to level you to 60 with one pass through the story mode.   They did say they added a couple side missions in. Maybe that's why you lost your check marks.
marvelheroes,3dj0ib,nimieties,3,Thu Jul 16 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"The changes to story mode have been a long time coming and I am seriously happy they are finally here.   Story mode initially had no difficulty modes and everyone would complete it by level 30. Levels 30-60 were fluff, with the only thing unlocking beyond level 30 being the cow level. Farming cows at level 50+ was largely the only end game content, with group terminals and limbo kind of fitting in to the end game content category as well. Limbo and Group terminals were available at level 30 though, so there wasn't much beyond level 30 to look forward to.  Difficulty modes were then introduced to story mode with the intent of adding story content that could progress you nearly all of the way to level 60. It worked pretty well, but since then the design philosophy has changed so much that this recent update was necessary.  Now rather than levels 1-30 being the meat of the game, levels 1-60 are the meat of the game. Where before level 31-60 were fluff, now prestige 1-6 are fluff. It certainly makes more sense this way, before people still felt they needed to hit level 60 to complete a hero. Now people may want to prestige, but they don't feel forced to.  Since everything has been expanded out to 1-60, the normal (1-30) heroic (30-45) and superheroic (45-60) modes needed to be consolidated and the entire story mode expanded to match the 1-60 philosophy.   Today's update is largely the last key change they needed to make in order for a more understandable experience for new players."
marvelheroes,3dj0ib,Elgand,2,Thu Jul 16 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah each world zone in Chapter 1-6 now has a progressing series of side-missions which require you, mostly, to just go chasing yellow pointers on your minimap and kill or click on whatever is there.  Its just whack-a-mole.  Each completed side-quest will grant you a box that contains a bunch of pet food and 1-2 Splinters, so its actually kinda awesome since its the first way to deliberately farm Splinters.    Unfortunately, though, only Chapters 1-6 are updated, so most of your characters are going to be critically over-level for it and thus wont get normal splinter drops...so might be worthwhile to wait until the next set of Story Mode updates, when there will be ""full 60 story mode"" or something like that, where L60 chars can do all chapters with level-appropriate mobs and drops.  Then you'll be getting normal Splinter drop rate PLUS the bonus from the Story Boxes."
marvelheroes,3diyjl,DixonYamouf,7,Thu Jul 16 17:26:15 2015 UTC,"When you first log into the game, there will be a system message (mine show up in pink font) that will tell you where the bounty is currently (terminals, midtown, industry city). Whatever is mentioned, go there (if you are geared well and level 60, do the Cosmic versions for more reward) and whenever you kill a boss, an Odin's Chest will drop. Once you fill you inventory, go to a non HUB area (anywhere that is not Avenger's Tower, X-Mansion, Hammer Bay, etc) and open them up. Lots of goodies come out like runes, uniques, Crimson Boxes (random boss specific artifact), and Odin Marks. Odin Marks can be used to buy a legendary item for your hero off of the Legendary Item Vendor in the top left area of Odin's Palace HUB.   Hope that helps."

He summons a random boss from the game (kind of like she-hulk's surprise witness, but bosses instead of heroes) that tries to kill both Boomerang, and anyone else in the area. Boomerang's goal is to dodge the boss' attacks while the boss kills all of Boomerang's enemies for him.  Yes, I know its practically impossible to balance properly. Doesn't stop me from wanting it."

His mechanic is that whenever he dies, he goes into a fit of rage, meaning that in order to optimize your damage output, you need to kill yourself every minute or so.

If you're looking for C-list, unlikely heroes, that guy would be it.  No powers, no SHIELD training, no superheroic career - just a regular dude who still somehow manages to get involved in nearly every area of the Marvel superhero community.

Easily the most Mark Millar character to ever be written by Millar, but filtered through Morrison, so it's just straight-up 2000AD.  He's a neo-nazi skinhead with shapeshifting skrull powers, and his skrully version of mad cow disease makes it so whenever he gets a seizure, patches of his skin become black.  I just want a horrible ""oh god, why is this in 616"" pile of ""I'm going to Mark Millar something just past the point where it's uncomfortable"" piece of filthyness added to the game continuity.

His three trees would be something like Kinetic Conversion, Bodyguard (summons with Lila Cheney and maybe Dazzler), and Funny Guy (not sure what this would exactly entail -- enemy debuffs?).  They may not be C-list (B-list?), but I'd love to see Amadeus Cho, Jubilee, and the Stepford Cuckoos as Team-ups.  Also, Goldballs Team-up, because it'd be hilarious.

marvelheroes,3dg86x,Scorpsan,18,Thu Jul 16 00:54:33 2015 UTC,"Find a supergroup (guild) and join it for questions/answers. Marvelheroes.info is an amazing database to lookup builds, items, and research with. Currencies are all received through certain events the developers turn on, so if you don't have any right now, keep playing and the event will be recycled so you can acquire some to purchase special items. Eternity splinters drop from killing mobs and can be used to purchase more heroes, team-ups (like followers you can keep active, summon for a short term damage burst, or put in a passive bonus mode) There are tiered difficulties, Green, Red, Cosmic in this game.  Get your feet wet in Green on the different game modes.  Heroes are not perfectly balanced, some are stronger at content then others.  Finding a play style and a hero that matches that is more important than playing someone you love that you are not happy with how they work.  Since it's the Marvel universe there's no shortage of awesome heroes to choose from. Knowledge in this game is power.  Seek to acquire that first before you try to min-max your gear.  If you feel weak, you need more gear.  That comes from farming, joining a patrol zone means that the damage of all players gets reduced so avoid Cosmic zones out of respect for other players.  This game has one shots and no hardcore mode.  Expect that eventually you WILL die.  Bosses have tell tale indicators when they are winding up a power.   Turn off Allied/Player Power Particles in the video options.  You can better see ground effects, boss powers, this way from gfx clutter.  Thank me later. Enable health bars and boss pointers/indicators in the options.    Rebind your power 1 through 6 keys to those you feel most comfortable with.  Donate unused items to the crafter don't sell them.  Crafter gives you access to better recipes and things you need after you hit 60 and they take a lot of gear to level at first. Your loot is your own.  If you are disconnected in a group and able to sign back in while the group is in the instance, your loot is still there on the ground for you. The official forums are a good place to get info on heroes and builds.  Use Google to look for a list of promo codes you can add to your account for free boost potions/buffs.  These don't expire when you are in a major hub (town/city)."

NullRage has been advertising his giveaways (which use Rafflecopter) on the forums so it's probably okay, but you should definitely try to get a more official answer if possible so you don't have to worry about the Gaz Agents banning you."

marvelheroes,3dhr7a,tezzyh,3,Thu Jul 16 11:12:20 2015 UTC,"Hopefully i can summarise vendors for you.  There is 4 different vendors: Crafter, Enchanter, Weapon Vendor, Gear Vendor.  At this point the weapon vendor and the gear vendor are pretty much useless don not  worry about them.   Your first goal should be to donate to your crafter till he reach level 18 which will unlock the option ""trade 5 duplicate uniques for 500k credit chest""   (On that note: please hoard all ""hero specific"" uniques in your bank (regardless of level) as they will be worth 100k each to you later. ""any hero"" uniques are not worth hoarding as they will rape your bank space before you obtain 5 of the same kind.)   Your 2nd goal will to be upgrade your Enchanter to level 17 so they have all the enchants. This can be easily achieved by donating 1 of these 500k credit chest.  Your 3rd goal will be to max your crafter to level 20 (a 200k Credit chest should be enough) to unlock the last important recipes (reroll unique etc)"
marvelheroes,3dhr7a,madusaxxvii,2,Thu Jul 16 12:17:17 2015 UTC,Added bit of advice: if you are enjoying Marvel heroes id suggest buying 1 or 2 bank stashes early. The added space to keep items of value is very nice to have and $10 isnt much for a F2P game (and supports the developers!)
marvelheroes,3dhr7a,madusaxxvii,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:20:24 2015 UTC,thanks for the help
marvelheroes,3dhr7a,TheRamJammer,2,Thu Jul 16 12:28:50 2015 UTC,"Pick everything up and use it to level your crafter up first. Once you get the recipes to trade uniques for credit chests, level up your enchanter. Gear vendors are optional but I leveled up everything.  Common items that give the most credit are useless artifacts. If you're finding that you don't have the STASH space for multiple uniques while you level up, feed them to pets instead of donating."
marvelheroes,3dhr7a,Ishakaru,2,Thu Jul 16 11:29:03 2015 UTC,"srry for the noob question but what is ""my crafter"" are they just the crafters from the hubs? or is there someone specific?"
marvelheroes,3dhr7a,arcdevil,2,Thu Jul 16 11:31:50 2015 UTC,"Hank Pym(ant man) in avengers tower. ""Your"" is used because the crafter has different levels depending on the account. So for you, the crafter is 1. For me, the crafter is 20.  Tips on leveling up: use the auto vacuum(options->gameplay) to have your pet(pet not actually needed) auto pick up colors of gear you don't need. Newish account would be anything less than cosmic, older would include cosmic as well, donate cosmic items you don't need/out grow. Never donate uniques.  It could be argued that that you get more cash from selling the items rather than the vacuum, and they would be right. Except for the time you're not spending killing things because you're back in town selling the items for 20th time that day.  The money maker items that you want to donate are artifacts and cores. There are only a handful of artifacts that are worth keeping, and all of them are rare drops from bosses you will most likely never see these unless you are specifically farming for them. Check trade forums for a list of valuable artifacts."

marvelheroes,3dhr7a,jongiplane,2,Thu Jul 16 12:39:16 2015 UTC,"You'll want to max your crafter first, as the things you unlock at level 17-20 make leveling the others much easier.  Donate all gear to crafters that you do not use, except for hero specific uniques. Save those for later, as they are used in the lvl 17-20 crafting recipes."

marvelheroes,3di3iz,bullintheheather,5,Thu Jul 16 14:56:30 2015 UTC,The opening in Asgard thing was patched out around 4-5 patches ago.
marvelheroes,3di3iz,Chaos5061,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:31:23 2015 UTC,"Actually it wasnt, in a sense. You could still open them in asgard as long as youre in Super Heroic difficulty (moot now with the story revamp) but you could also open it anywhere else in the story as long as you were in Super Heroic difficulty you would have received 2-3x the amount of xp. The only thing patched was the fact that it didnt require you to be in the furthest most story quest.  Source: In game test that took 30 seconds to find out."
marvelheroes,3di3iz,dkphxcyke,2,Thu Jul 16 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"asgard probably won't work anymore after story revamp. idk for sure though.  boosts, make sure you have odins boost running, very important if you want odin marks. don't bother with ICP, imo. Terms are best, MM is second best.  For terms just run an easy term over and over for maximum box farmage. something like taskmaster, Fisk, hood, or whatever you want if you want a chance at a boss artifact/unique as well."
marvelheroes,3di3iz,asylum101,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:31:15 2015 UTC,"Well, you can always keep an eye where they spawn and collect them as many as possible before opening them all at once. :D"

marvelheroes,3di3iz,ManchurianCandycane,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"Actually... The only thing that got patched was the fact that you didnt need to be in Asgard to receive the 2-3x XP. You could be anywhere in the story mode except for the training room, as long as you were in SUPERHEROIC, and receive the bonus experience in the same vein as if you were in Asgard. But it's possibly going to be moot now that there is no longer difficulties -- but im sure someone will find out if its still a viable thing once servers are up.  Source: I tested it."
marvelheroes,3dhtwg,ElNutimo,4,Thu Jul 16 11:46:35 2015 UTC,"From memory:hood, kurse, King Pin don't change at all  Dr doom changes a tiny bit but is mostly the same.

marvelheroes,3dhtwg,Ishakaru,2,Thu Jul 16 12:07:17 2015 UTC,"No you aren't crazy, there is a bit of randomness involved. Most (if not all) locations outside of hubs randomize to be different."
marvelheroes,3dhtwg,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,2,Thu Jul 16 11:53:45 2015 UTC,"There are 3-4 possible layouts for most zones.  They aren't actually randomly generated just randomly selected.

marvelheroes,3dhtwg,zeCrazyEye,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:31:46 2015 UTC,Ah.  That makes sense.  It explains why I kept on getting lost even though I've went through story mode a few times.  Thanks for the confirmation.  Yay! I'm not crazy!
marvelheroes,3dhtwg,zeCrazyEye,2,Thu Jul 16 15:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yea Chapter 7 is the most annoying place with the random map, other chapters mostly confine you to where you need to go anyway but chapter 7 I waste so much time running around looking for places."
marvelheroes,3dhtwg,The_Keto_Warrior,2,Thu Jul 16 15:42:40 2015 UTC,They doubled down on Hydra base as well.  It seems to have some set maps where the boss is north but also recently mirror versions and rotated maps where he can be south west and requires a U-turn.
marvelheroes,3dhtwg,notorious98,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:20:17 2015 UTC,"It's called ""procedural"".  They ""remake"" the map whenever you go into it.  For example, the dungeons in Diablo would change layouts after it ""reset"".  It's for exploration.  This game has it to a slightly lesser degree.  Personally, I don't run Manderan or MODOK terminals (unless I have to) because their procedural area is annoying as all hell."
marvelheroes,3de44h,cp24eva,10,Wed Jul 15 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on your level of commitment, Short term I'd probably start with who you think would be the most fun. If you enjoy the game and want to level a bunch of heroes, then Cyclops is great for the 10% Xp bonus going forward.  Long term, Cyclops pays off well if you get him early, but the first 3 heroes already give pretty large XP boosts for getting them to 60 before diminishing returns sets in. (So it's not critically important, just nice to have)"
marvelheroes,3de44h,QuorumOf4,3,Wed Jul 15 15:44:19 2015 UTC,"Would be nice to run around with her and not have only red beams be our means of destruction. On a similar note, just how good or bad is Cyclops melee? I've only touch his roll and ride off. Maybe a build with melee attacks, shotgun beam, and various team drop ins?"
marvelheroes,3de44h,asylum101,3,Wed Jul 15 15:49:07 2015 UTC,"My brother says it's not nearly as bad as it seems but it's not like hulk or even daredevil level of power. But he manages a 1:10 ttk, which is pretty decent considering punch clops"
marvelheroes,3de44h,RustyJoe89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:09:16 2015 UTC,Can you brief me on why punch clops is a thing?
marvelheroes,3de44h,asylum101,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:24:32 2015 UTC,"he has a unique specifically catered to a melee build, and I THINK that unique was created as a joke (because really who would name an item legacy of punchclops, that can't be from the comics can it?). But yea anyway, Cyclops as a character spends most of his time training to combat mutant haters, sentinels, bad mutants, and wolverine. (battle buddies) Because of this, he knows a few moves and he's in good shape, but he's by no means a super human like Cap or Colossus.  I can't tell you the exact history behind it, but maybe someone else can do better than me."
marvelheroes,3de44h,The_Keto_Warrior,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:34:13 2015 UTC,So Punchclops was a player in the early beta days of the game who before there were uniques in the game did a little mini fan comic and built cyclops with items that supported his melee build.  The unique was named after the player \ joke as far as I know
marvelheroes,3de44h,arcdevil,-1,Thu Jul 16 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"kind of that  on beta people found his underwhelming melee tree and his overabundance of simply punching things hilarious(in a so-bad-its-good kind of way), so they dubbed his melee build punchclops  then someone took ""punchclops"" as username, declared his unrelenting love for the melee build and started a (fairly lame and unfunny if you ask me, not exactly c&h or xkcd material) comic series based on the punchclops joke  somehow it gained traction for a while (no idea why, it was so-bad-its-BAD) and the punchclops joke became widespread even to those who didnt own nor cared for cyclops  and then devs took the joke and ran with it...hence, the legacy of punchclops unique  at least the comic guy realized he didnt have an atom of funny in his entire body and dropped it"

marvelheroes,3de44h,fader48080,-4,Thu Jul 16 01:26:31 2015 UTC,common mistake but I tend to find the common mistakes are sometimes the most irksome
marvelheroes,3de44h,selfpossessed,3,Thu Jul 16 02:01:07 2015 UTC,"For me, I started with Rocket Raccoon because the Guardians movie had just come out and he seemed like a lot of fun. Because i had so much fun with him, I got sucked into the game and decided to level cyclops et al next. That was 40 something heroes ago and that's what I'd recommend to anyone just starting out."
marvelheroes,3de44h,GreatMadWombat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Heroes 1-5 are each going to give an above average amount of bonus xp. Hero 6+though? If she's enjoying the game so much she wants six heroes available to her, THAT'S the moment when it's worth it to start leveling Cyclops, imo.   Honestly though? She should play a bunch of heroes that interest her to 10, choose one of THOSE as her starter hero, then if there's another hero she loves, spend the 2nd day ES gift on that one.   Elsewise, get a random hero box or two, and just enjoy the game, imo."
marvelheroes,3de44h,QuorumOf4,18,Wed Jul 15 23:32:39 2015 UTC,"Also, it depends how ""into"" games your wife is. If she is finicky like my GF, then I'd start here with somebody she will think is cool. Otherwise you risk her deciding she doesn't like the game before she actually plays it."
marvelheroes,3de44h,QuorumOf4,2,Wed Jul 15 15:46:19 2015 UTC,And that's what I am afraid of. I don't want her to get bored with clops. She like women characters like storm and psylocke. And gambit would be of interest to her too.
marvelheroes,3de44h,Galyndean,9,Wed Jul 15 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"Then have her play one of those. Your worst case scenario is she decides the game isn't for her because she wants to play a girl and doesn't think it's worth investing the time to grind cyclops before she can play.  I'm having trouble getting my GF to play GW2 with me because she is disappointed she can't get any cool looking gear at level 30/80. Level 80 just feels too far away for her to justify playing.  If she's into it, it may even be worth your time to play her account and Grind a Cyclops to 60 for her in when she isn't playing with you."
marvelheroes,3de44h,wuzzywuz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:55:43 2015 UTC,Can't she just get the skin and apply it to her low level gear?  o.O  Or does she want specific dungeon gear or something?
marvelheroes,3de44h,gaalia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:04:47 2015 UTC,In theory you could but her some higher level skins to transmute on lower level gear in gw2.
marvelheroes,3de44h,Yakobo15,8,Thu Jul 16 08:29:42 2015 UTC,"On a cost note--Both Storm and Scarlet Witch are fun, easy, powerful female characters. Both are also only 200 ES.

marvelheroes,3de44h,presidenttrex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:07:35 2015 UTC,Agree with Quorum. Unless she's into games a lot you should ease her into it with She Hulk or some other fun female hero.
marvelheroes,3de44h,Gul_Ducat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:19:49 2015 UTC,Both of those (Storm and Psylocke) are very good and fun to play as. X-23 is badass too. Cyclops is smart to start as because it'll make everyone else level up faster. Tell her to try him second.
marvelheroes,3de44h,Johnsu,2,Wed Jul 15 20:36:02 2015 UTC,Came in to say exactly this. Wife loves the latest She-Hulk run and started out with her.  She's still elbow dropping bad guys on the weekends with me.

marvelheroes,3de44h,ElectricZee,22,Wed Jul 15 19:49:03 2015 UTC,I recommend against Cyclops for a few reasons.     He's slow. A fast hero with a cheap dash is good for noobs. He's not difficult but I wouldn't call him easiest tier. 10% xp is really not that big a deal.   Picking someone she'll enjoy with a cheap dash is what I recommend.

I've been playing two years, have over 4k Omega, IL69 in all slots, half the roster maxed, and still have Cyclops at 10.  His synergy is good, don't get me wrong, but you're better off playing characters you like to 60 for the much-larger XP bonus than risk burning out on a character you don't like."
marvelheroes,3de44h,Susarian,4,Wed Jul 15 19:30:11 2015 UTC,"Getting your first hero to 60 already gives you a 30% bonus exp. While another 10% is obviously better, it's not enough of a reason to not play whomever you enjoy most first."

marvelheroes,3de44h,TheLordBear,5,Wed Jul 15 16:42:09 2015 UTC,Get her hooked on whatever she wants to play first. She can pick up Cyclops later if she wants.
marvelheroes,3de44h,Manifest,7,Wed Jul 15 17:11:51 2015 UTC,You can start with whoever you like. But the 10%xp will help you in the long run if you decide to level more toons.

You get 25% extra for getting your first character to 60.  As with any game, play what you enjoy and don't stress the numbers."
marvelheroes,3de44h,Supra93,3,Wed Jul 15 17:02:27 2015 UTC,I found Cyclops to be boring as shit.  Let her start with whoever she likes.  She'll be more likely to keep playing that way.
marvelheroes,3de44h,LikeIFuckingCare,3,Wed Jul 15 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"It's really not. My advice is always always always always start with a character you want to play. Its not fun to play characters you don't want as some kind of preparation to play the character you do like.   Same thing goes for random hero boxes. Yes, it may be more economical to get the most heroes by doing randoms and hoping you get one you want and not 3 Things in a row. But if all you want to do is play Invisible Woman, it makes more sense to me to just get Invisible Woman."
marvelheroes,3de44h,MutatedSpleen,3,Wed Jul 15 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"You have already received the answer on synergies and extra exp for each 60 you have.

Additionally, each level 30 hero grants a 1% XP bonus and each level 50 hero grants a 3% XP bonus.  You can achieve a max of a 200% XP bonus with this system.""  In my opinion, choosing your favorite heroes will lead to more experience bonuses because you'll want to play the game more.  Fun leads to experience, pun intended.  I'm starting my 12th character to take to 60 and Cyclops isn't one of them, even though he's unlocked from getting a starter pack/bundle."
marvelheroes,3de44h,Quexana,2,Thu Jul 16 02:40:06 2015 UTC,"No, Cyclops is never a must have, 10% is nothing, you better start off with someone you like"
marvelheroes,3de44h,Galyndean,2,Wed Jul 15 17:53:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's just 10% exp.  Not that big of a deal unless you have a raging desire to level fast.  If she's going to play casually and just enjoy the game, pick whoever."
marvelheroes,3de44h,Rhodair,4,Wed Jul 15 19:11:07 2015 UTC,A good husband would level Cyclops for her and let her play whatever she wants.
marvelheroes,3de44h,SuperSaiyanFlash,3,Wed Jul 15 21:39:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on the wife.  If my husband did that for me without my specifically asking him to, I would be upset, especially since Cyke was my first real main."
marvelheroes,3de44h,92843GG,3,Wed Jul 15 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"Aye, Cyclops is still my main to this day, so I cringe whenever I see people saying he's boring or doesn't kill things as fast.  It really comes down to who fits your play-style best and you don't mind staring at for hours."

marvelheroes,3de44h,akathebebop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:08:23 2015 UTC,Maybe you should also explain the benefits of leveling cyclops and let her make the decision?
marvelheroes,3de44h,smittyphi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"Yes Cyclops is an excellent starter hero for beginners.  Not only do you get the 10% XP buff for all future hero leveling, but Cyclops is also a very easy character to play.  He's a great choice for getting used to the game before moving into a hero that uses more buttons or button alting to use 2 action bars.  Highly recommend starting with him.   Scarlet Witch and Storm are also excellent starter heroes too, but they won't give you the extra 10% xp buff."
marvelheroes,3de44h,ProfJackAss,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't start with cyclops and I'm glad because I find him pretty boring. Eventually I picked him up for the synergy, and because I was lucky enough to get his 90s costume as a drop lol. But at no point did I ever wish I had him earlier for the bonus exp over playing characters I enjoyed more. She won't have fun if she feels like she's just leveling cyclops as a chore before playing someone she has more interest in"
marvelheroes,3de44h,axelnight,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:18:12 2015 UTC,"You could let your wife play with some of your characters to let her get her feet wet.  Or let her start with Scarlet Witch if she is casual.  You get an endgame skill when you start, and she can teleport."
marvelheroes,3de44h,Creovex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:26:32 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  His level 50 synergy is +10% experience gain.  If your wife wants to level more heroes faster then it is a pretty solid option.  If she doesn't really care about how quickly she levels it's much less of a big deal.  In my experience a lot of casuals care more for fun than efficiency, so for your wife the exp gain may not be a deciding factor.  Just give her the info straight and let her make her own decision."
marvelheroes,3de44h,Deeviant,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"Cyclops is a solid suggestion to someone undecided on a starter, but should never be suggested in an exclusionary manner.  He's easy to play and 10% extra XP on future characters is nice for a new player, but neither are a good enough reason to not play something else someone would rather play.  Cyclops is only worth pushing if someone is already on the fence and unable to pick a starter."
marvelheroes,3de44h,rybackstun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:45:28 2015 UTC,"Let her choose whatever she wants...  If she gets hooked... then drop the Cyclops (10% XP) info.  You have better odds of getting her playing long term if you don't push her into ""grind over fun"" early on..."
marvelheroes,3de44h,gzyzwc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:01:35 2015 UTC,"Really, the starting with cyclops thing is a bit overblown, unless:   You never will buy any experience boosters AND you care about how fast you level up.   If you buy a boost, the 10% bonus from the cyclops bonus is basically noise at that point and makes very little difference.  If you don't buy boosts, there's at least a chance that you don't care how fast you level. If you don't want to buy boosts and want to level as fast as you can, then by all means, start cyclops."
marvelheroes,3de44h,ClockworkCaravan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:27:35 2015 UTC,"Since just about every character is available to play up to level 10 for free, have her try out a couple characters she likes and include Cyke in that group. Once she finds someone she likes there, unlock that character and play to level 60 with her.   Focus on fun more than efficiency."
marvelheroes,3de44h,CloudNine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely she does not.  Normally people say to do it, because if asked for advice the best ROI for time is Cyclops. It is just a knee jerk reaction because the other answer is to play what you want and people want guidance, but if she knows the characters she likes the looks of and that is more important to her let her pick the pretty characters.   The Cyclops recommendation is after all for min/max grinding everything.  I always say the first 3 characters should be a mix of range/melee/Summoners so that you really identify which playstyle you like. So in this vein she could do Storm/Ms Marvel/Squirrel Girl and be fine, at no point will you really miss the cyclops synergy, it may take her 1 extra legendary quest to level but really in the grand scheme of things it is not that big of a deal."
marvelheroes,3de44h,grinr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:30:06 2015 UTC,"10% xp really isn't that huge a deal overall. Have her play whatever interests her the most first and then if she gets into the game recommend Cyclops as her second, third, or fourth hero."
marvelheroes,3de44h,shard135,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"He was alright to play,  and everyone likes the exp synergy but I'd go with whatever character she thinks is cool and maybe get cyclops later. Especially on the first play thru with story I'd think it's be easier to get into the game just playing the character that feels right rather than the strategically best starter."
marvelheroes,3de44h,Sirmalta,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:31:10 2015 UTC,"No, it's definitely not.  The best introduction to this game is to find the hero you enjoy playing, period.  Long-time players forget this because they've already had that experience, but if you aren't having fun at the very beginning you are not going to care about XP or boosts or events or anything else past that.  I would encourage her to try different heroes and help her set up her controls to be consistent (left mouse attack, right mouse move-attack, or the like) for all her heroes.  The defaults are not often the best.  Let her see how they look and feel and decide for herself what's fun.  If she gets INTO it, then I would encourage her to invest in Cyclops as the XP bonus is definitely worth it as long-term it's a huge jump in advancement."
marvelheroes,3de44h,Drag0nthrax,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:02:20 2015 UTC,if she's a casual she should rather pick a character she enjoy i am playing the game for 1 year and a half and still haven't leveled cyclop cuz i hate the hero and i'm totally fine.
marvelheroes,3de44h,Galyndean,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:12:58 2015 UTC,"naw, the XP boost from Cyclops isnt that big of a deal."
marvelheroes,3de44h,Hellknightx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"I'd tell her to pick the character most appealing to her & enjoy the first play through. If she picks it up & is interested, looking to settle in for the long-haul, then you can get Cyclops.  Playing him because you feel like you need to just makes the game feel like a grind and a chore from the jump. Don't do that."
marvelheroes,3de44h,TastyClown,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:01:37 2015 UTC,Let her play what she wants.  It will be more fun for her that way.  She can lvl every character to ten except for Doom.  Let her try a few and see if there's one she likes.
marvelheroes,3de44h,fader48080,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:09:00 2015 UTC,"With the new story mode changes, Gaz is actually recommending against new players aiming for XP bonuses so that you don't outlevel the story content.  And, like others have said, Cyclops is good, but not amazing. And 10% XP is more than compensated for with a single boost, if you feel like spending money. I'd just say pick whatever character you think is most fun and is reasonably strong. Generally, you'll want a character that can teleport as one of your mains."
marvelheroes,3de44h,upvotesforeverything,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Cyke as 2nd or 3rd.  First pick the hero she likes the most outside the game. Second, pick the hero that sounds the most fun to play once she has learned a bit about the game. If she's still into the game and thinks she might want to play a ton of heroes, that's the time to get Cyclops.   Especially with the story mode revamp coming tomorrow (fingers crossed!), casual players shouldn't have any trouble leveling to their hearts content. Cyclops is really best for people into doing prestiging or capping their Omegas."
marvelheroes,3de44h,tipurbartender,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:50:43 2015 UTC,Cyclops is NOT the be all end all of starting characters. the fact of the matter is with the various other buffs and events the cyclops buff kind of gets lost on the sea of XP buffs.  I firmly belive you should only play characters you enjoy. this is a game not your job if you don't like the way a character plays or just can't stand someone don't play them. if there is someone you love for any reason and have already prestiged them to cosmic play them anyway.  I when they first released the deal of every hero you get to 60 giving you an XP buff. I played hunk until I was literally bored to tears and almost quit playing all together it was such a slog I would never do it again still haven't been able to bring my self to play hulk despite the rave reviews on his 52 review.  I will say this for cyclops he is easy to use. he is primarily ranged so he is out of trouble more often than not. his ult and his signature are good and I find anyone with a bounce power has the leg up on most everyone else when it comes to dealing with trash or dealing with any boss that summons anything to fight with them.  but at the end of the day play who you love and then try to branch out.

marvelheroes,3de44h,Xtulu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:30:53 2015 UTC,"My advice, is dont worry to much about exp synergy right now, as you want to earn splinters anyways and if the point is to max a character and reroll then it will be fine by then they will have a new story mode which makes leveling faster and much better paced.   Pick what you want, also ms marvel is really fun to start with because she has survivablity she can do melee or range or both, and she isnt slower like some other melee characters, not to mention flashy you can try them all to level 10. Psyclocke is good to start with 2 as she has melee and aoes she can drop down while enemies get hurt in them."
marvelheroes,3de44h,Doomgrin75,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:51:40 2015 UTC,I will tell you what i tell others.... If she knows someone that plays and would like to try a character then let her watch you play the character she wants and see if its her style. I have 25+ characters at 60 or prestiged and i didnt do cyclops till 20 characters in. Does his synergy help lvl...absolutely but if ya just wanna have fun use who ya want :)
marvelheroes,3de44h,MrStealYourDanish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:37:44 2015 UTC,Don't risk it obsessing over the details of optimum playing efficiency.  Best to be casual and understanding of what she wants out of her playing experience.  She should try all the characters she is curious about to lvl 10 and then decide on a main and you could give her some input.
marvelheroes,3de81o,zman2596,4,Wed Jul 15 16:09:04 2015 UTC,"If you're not concerned about the costumes and the hero specific STASH tabs, buy the Age of Ultron pack off of Steam for $40.  It comes with Hulk, Iron Man, Cap, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Thor.  It only comes with their 6 AoU costumes.  However, it also comes with 1,000 G currency.  Use the $20 you're saving to buy 2,100 G and buy Scarlet Witch off of the G store.  With the G you have left over (probably somewhere around 2,000), you can purchase the tabs that you'd prefer to buy."
marvelheroes,3de81o,notorious98,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:48 2015 UTC,Nice.  Didn't realize steam had packs. I downloaded native game client and didn't go through steam.  Do I have to redo the steam client of the game for this to work?
marvelheroes,3de81o,ArborDaze,2,Wed Jul 15 18:23:18 2015 UTC,"No. If you buy the thing on steam, what it does is give you a code to redeem on marvelheroes.com. You just right click the game in steams library, and click Show CD Key, and it should list any codes for stuff you bought off Steam for the game there.  At least, that's what it did when I bought Rogue off Steam."

A week+ of crazy currency grinding is too much to walk away from for me. I have to get the red raid currency the hard and slow way. There's no pugs for that in the LFP system it seem.

marvelheroes,3dcrw3,Yakobo15,2,Wed Jul 15 10:30:04 2015 UTC,"Spirit and health I'd say are dumps, too.  You really want 2 damage stats. And then you want high roll ranges for both (hold Alt and mouse over).  Anything that doesn't have 2 damage stats with 50%+ roll on both is probably not tradeworthy.  And obviously +powers is good too.  As for the insigs themselves, again you want ones that give DR and/or CR, along with CDR and/or BR.  Really, I think any other stat or combination of stats isn't going to be very much in demand.  Insigs like Wasp and Iceman are a good example, DR+a big chunk of CDR."
marvelheroes,3dcrw3,droid327,3,Wed Jul 15 15:31:28 2015 UTC,"Just remember that if you unlock Ms. Marvel and Luke Cage's stash tabs, you can store every current insignia in one or the other.  You could also use them for storing any-hero uniques, uru-forged items, and rings.  I don't know what your money situation is, but you can unlock both tabs for the price of a meal at Taco Bell.  Food for thought."

marvelheroes,3dcrw3,iaro,5,Wed Jul 15 11:13:29 2015 UTC,Ms Marvel does.
marvelheroes,3dcrw3,Dirk_8,3,Wed Jul 15 11:24:47 2015 UTC,"no, but Ms. Marvel was one of the few non-mutants in the X-Men.  She can equip their insig in MH2015."
marvelheroes,3dcrw3,avatarofshadow,3,Wed Jul 15 14:26:44 2015 UTC,"my opinion:   +ranks is generally a keeper no matter what it may be paired with crit damage is excellent, especially 1k+ crit hit is great, especially 300+ brut strike is decent high health is decent high dmg rating variations is decent, especially 400+   Generally you want a combo with two of the above.  The type of insig also matters.  For example, MK is less valuable than Shield because so many fewer can use it.  Similarly, Doop is less valuable than taskmaster because of the dps difference in the base stats.  Ask yourself...if I offered a blessing in trade could I pick up an insig with similar or better stats?  If the answer is yes, I generally wouldn't bother stashing it."
marvelheroes,3dcrw3,petermesmer,2,Wed Jul 15 08:14:42 2015 UTC,keep high roll CDR/BDR  try to trade high roll CDR + high roll melee/ranged DR. check trade chat in case anyone bites.  trash rest while you thank Gaz for designing a game with so many useful stats...
marvelheroes,3dcrw3,arcdevil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:00:39 2015 UTC,"I'd drop anything with spirit unless it has high spirit and high CR/CDR/BDR.  Only 2 heroes I know benefit from spirit (Iron Man and Juggernaut).  Anything not over 900 CDR/BDR can be expendable too, although I weeded a lot of the 800ish CDR/BDR insigs out and put them on level 60 heroes that I don't play.  Ghetto stash!  Also if you have a hero stash that you don't play you can drop them in there if you wanted to, although it's likely you'd have to equip them first (you can always unbind them later).  Lastly you can put up a list of insigs on the trade forums and sell them on the cheap, it's a bit annoying but in a week or so you can get rid of a bunch of them and have something to show for it in return.  I'm in the same position though, 2.5 Stash tabs full of insigs that are all pretty solid."
marvelheroes,3dcrw3,ledbetterus,4,Wed Jul 15 06:54:39 2015 UTC,"Don't need to first equip insignias to store them in Hero stash, just need to be of a kind that hero can equip."

marvelheroes,3d9tvo,zakary3888,2,Tue Jul 14 19:01:22 2015 UTC,I made a silly joke I forgot to put a smiley in sorry just ignore it.   In origins he was a healthy merc taking part in an assault on the base and got captured but this preview says he was dying of cancer and they offered him a cure so I reckon they're just ignoring origins and rebooting deadpool.
marvelheroes,3d9tvo,Kweeg10,3,Tue Jul 14 19:25:51 2015 UTC,Timey Wimey stuff fixed it after DofP :D
marvelheroes,3d9tvo,zakary3888,3,Tue Jul 14 19:27:21 2015 UTC,"They basically retconned everything with DoFP, they definitely want everyone to forget X3 and Origins. The original leaked script even made fun of Barakapool in the intro, so we will see how they go about it.  One thing for sure is thank god he's at least entering a program hoping for a cancer cure - true to his actual origins."
marvelheroes,3d9tvo,C_L_I_C_K,2,Wed Jul 15 08:25:29 2015 UTC,I think they want everyone to forget Origins. They're bringing back Deadpool and Gambit because they're fan favs and potential money makers. Origins fucked those 2 heroes up... though I would argue they fucked up DP a lot more than Gambit (I actually kinda liked Gambit in that movie but thought he needed a bigger role and not just a cameo).

As for Tatum, I still don't like the casting, but at least he's a well-known actor with a (mainly female) fanbase that will check out the movie just for him. He also has potential, as seen in the movie Foxcatcher. If they can give him a great script and plot, he may be able to turn the Gambit movie into a sleeper hit.   Tatum wanted this role and opportunity bad. Fox wants him to replace Hugh Jackman bad. Hopefully they both want the movie to succeed bad enough to make it good."

marvelheroes,3d9tvo,vadersdemise,3,Tue Jul 14 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"I would guess Marvel just wouldn't make a Deadpool movie to avoid the question.

marvelheroes,3d9tvo,cooldrew,2,Tue Jul 14 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"He also does next to nothing for the family friendly MCU they've created. It's all about the big picture and DP, while we love him, isn't much of a factor on the grand scale of things (infinity wars).

marvelheroes,3d9tvo,dragonsroc,2,Wed Jul 15 08:27:23 2015 UTC,"The thing with Marvel is they want all their movies to have a specific tone and feel like each movie feels like it fits within the same universe while still being unique in its own way.  Directors still have a lot of control but there are still those keys beats they have to hit, and I don't think that would work with the unchained, off-the-rails style this Deadpool movie looks to have."

marvelheroes,3dalmn,darth_infamous,0,Wed Jul 15 15:33:02 2015 UTC,So they are removing the xp boosts from Sinister story mode because people are either over-leveling or leveling too fast. But you can spend you money and buy as many boosts as you please if you spend your money. That is a huge double standard. Saying things like that start to turn me off about the game.
marvelheroes,3dalmn,Ishakaru,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i don't understand the whole not wanting people to over level story content thing.

Everything else can be gotten through earned in-game currency, drops and special event giveaways.  However, the game is made such that you'll be overwhelmed with loot and run out of inventory space real quick especially in the beginning when you don't know what to keep and what to drop.  Even so, you can still play through the whole story and endgame without having to pay a single cent.  Just do a bit of research on what to keep and what to drop and you'll be fine.  Try to play through the story mode once through.  At the end of it, you'll know yourself if the game is worth spending money on.  IMO, spending money on this game only speeds up what you are going to eventually get through by playing the game.    Not everyone has the luxury to grind ten hours a day and not everyone has the luxury to spend hundreds, even thousands of dollars on a game.  Find your own balance.

marvelheroes,3ddy1d,ashtonknapp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:27:16 2015 UTC,"All of the game is free to play.  You can try out all heroes except the most recently released on to level 10 before choosing who to 'unlock' .    You earn currency in-game to unlock heroes free of charge.  Costumes are only cosmetic and give you no in-game advantage, but they are an extremely rare drop and you can also 'blender' costumes you don't want for a random one.  Pets and Team-Ups can also be earned over time through event currencies , splinters or rewards.  The only thing you probably NEED to spend money on is inventory space.  But if you only want to play one single hero, you can get away with just the one free stash.  It'll be difficult but you can do it."

I have 10+ stash pages and it's still not enough since I like to hoard.  if you enjoy the game I'd suggest supporting it via your wallet to keep it going, some of the higher dollar packs have some real good value in them.  if i could go back I would have bought that mega pack when I first started.  good luck."

marvelheroes,3d9zuw,smittyphi,3,Tue Jul 14 17:40:30 2015 UTC,Donate everything to level up the crafter   Don't do this with hero-specific uniques if you're just focusing on one hero.  Hoard them until you get your crafter high enough to exchange  5 dupe uniques for credit boxes and leveling the others will be a breeze.  something something old-timers something something uphill both ways something something whipper snappers
marvelheroes,3d9zuw,HuggableBear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:29:07 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  I highly recommend all new players read the Readme up top, or right here http://redd.it/2uo5it"
marvelheroes,3d9zuw,smittyphi,5,Wed Jul 15 00:34:07 2015 UTC,"Here are a few tips:  While levelling, its really not worth keeping any gear, as soon as you outlevel something, sell or donate the old one.  I generally re-gear every 5 levels or so, usually by popping some ICP, midtown, odin or cosmic boxes, depending on what events are running that day.   I focus on the main stat, unless I notice a lack or spirit or health, then I look for items that add those stats.  Do not hoard any slot 1-5 items that are not unique.  Uniques can be kept while levelling for exchanging with the crafter or feeding to a pet when you get one.  Don't keep any crafting ingredients under 'pure' unless you are about to add some costume stats.    Most artifacts are not worth keeping, equip them or get rid of them.  The valuable ones are in the 50-60 range.  Most costume cores, rings and insigs are not worth keeping.  Gear that is not level 60 is not generally worth keeping.  Things to keep: Level 60 rings/insigs/cores with desirable stats Certain boss artifacts and uniques that are difficult to get.  There are several posts around on things to keep.  Other tips: If you enjoy the game, a crafting stash is one of the better investments you can do.  It will hold runes and crafting materials for you, freeing up a lot of space.   General stash tabs are great too.  Getting a pet to feed items to is a good way of getting rid of stuff.  During cosmic week, don't bother picking up anything other than cosmic items and worldstone cashes.  Donate everything else to your pet or crafter.  Upgrade your crafter first, as he will get you the exchange recipes to get rid of your excess uniques.  Hope that helps."
marvelheroes,3d9zuw,TheLordBear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"My advice for under 55  As you're leveling I wouldn't really save anything that you're not currently going to equip or use.   The artifacts most people use are boss specific drops starting at lvl 55 + versions of the terminals + challenges.    Flip through marvelheroes.info  and the builds for the character you want to familiarize yourself with what your guy will need.  Sell or donate everything else.  Rune wise.  Picture runes are keepers mostly for trades.  There's a handful of others. Serpent and Tyr are the ones that come to mind along with Zod that hold value.  Most everyone now is using Days which aren't tradable and Doop which mostly drop during events.  Until you have a character specific tab I'd also sell your uniques.  If you find a character you like enough, get his 350G tab.  And keep the uniques up to 5.  Once you get 5 of the same one which is easy to do on Midtown Mondays,  trade them in for 500k credit boxes to use for rerolling stats and quests.  I'd suggest if you're short on space to sell any hero uniques for the most part as well.  There are some common ones, but its tougher to accumulate 5 of a like one than with hero specific.  Outside of that, any uniques you pick up are worthless if you can't wear them right away.  You'll get so many of the hero specific ones that there's no need to hold onto them for later use.   If there's an event currency that takes up inventory space. Keep it in your active inventory.  You'll be picking up 1 and they usually stack to 1000. No sense in using both a bank slot and a inventory slot for the same items.  Toss /sell all crafting mats until you feel like spending some time doing affixes. When you do, you can pick up the highest one and break it down into lower ones.  But before then it's a waste of space.  Things to keep always: Unstable Molecules.  Matrix of Unbinding.  Hero Upgrade Tokens (occasionally get these from fortune cards), Costumes.   This all changes a little at 55+.  But until you get there,  not really worth cramming up your space."

marvelheroes,3d9zuw,Quidfacis_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"There's really no need to hoard items in this game.  Pretty much everything (except some rare runes) can be easily farmed.  Even rare artifacts (Gem of the Kursed, Doom's Hand) are pretty easy to obtain.  By ""easy"" I mean they take far less time than farming, say, Stones of Jordan in Diablo 2 or epic WoW gear.  This isn't a game where you need to closely monitor every drop and compare it with some online list.  Just play to 60, then check http://marvelheroes.info/ for your hero's Best in Slot items, and farm those."
marvelheroes,3d9zuw,ATrav,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:17:32 2015 UTC,Only keep some uniques until you hit max level. Mainly hero specific ones. Reason why if you chose to prestige. It helps with the leveling process.
marvelheroes,3d9nzd,QuorumOf4,2,Tue Jul 14 16:15:45 2015 UTC,"For rolls, I go by the 80% rule for the most part. Basically if all ranges averaged together >80%. I call it a day.

Why 90%?  Because I gear to succeed at content rather than waste my time/resources to gear max.  For cores rolling crit damage, I go for 330+, 700+, 1100+, 1600+ aiming for a combined 3575-3773/3972 (that is 90-95% depending on how much I like the character).  As for other gear, I usually max stat bonuses (such as +str) and the rest I go for 90%+ as well.

marvelheroes,3d9nzd,CosmonautDrifter,2,Wed Jul 15 00:51:45 2015 UTC,"It depends on how many layers of RNG you're willing to fight through, honestly.  For Costume affixes, you're fishing for type and range.  One of those is 1 out of 5 possibilities, the other is a 1-100% range type.  So to get a 90%+ roll on the affix you want, you have a (1/5) x (1/10) = 2% chance.  On average, you're looking at 50 rerolls to get what you want.  For that GotK, though, you have four stats that you want high.  To get a 90%+ roll on all 4, you have a (1/10)4 chance, or 1 in 10,000 chance of getting them all rolled 90+%.  You are probably going to have to prioritize which ones matter or set your threshold lower.  There is no magic rule, you just have to use a little math and make some decisions as to how much frustration you're willing to put up with to get what you want.  Most people will prioritize Attributes first and foremost, then skill ranks, then crit and brut rating, then crit and brut damage, and the rest are per-hero for the most part.  If you have a hero that gets a guaranteed crit or brut as part of his skill set, then CDR and BDR may rank higher for them.  You see like a pretty smart guy and I'm sure you can do this math on your own.  it sounds like what you really want to know is if you're going to get kicked out of raids or whatever for not having good enough rolls, and the answer is almost universally no.  most people are simply looking to see if you have blessings, a legendary, and the right choices of artifacts, not looking at the rolls to see if they're top-tier."

They're 90-95% perfect, in my opinion, but in fairness I've basically massacred the one I use to account for several other factors. Here's my shorthand guide:  1) Take list of all the possible nodes that benefit your damage output.  2) Find the most gain to your overall damage output for the least points spent. You'll have to do math here, sorry. Easier for some heroes than others.  3) Spend points.  4) Re-update list of possible nodes (namely ranks).  5) Repeat until out of points, then possibly adjust last node or two taken to get most damage for overall points (example - you spent 20 points on a rank of Deathlok Program, but still have 50 leftover you can't spend anywhere useful - refund Deathlok and buy that juicy 70 point node)."
marvelheroes,3d9ej2,droid327,2,Tue Jul 14 15:15:10 2015 UTC,"Basically if you know your weightings for DPS stats, you can convert all offensive nodes to a generic ""DPS stat"", and then simply take whatever gives you the most ""DPS"" for the least Omega cost.  I think DR=6 CR=8 CDR=3 BR=3 BDR=1 was the last weightings I calculated, to give you a ballpark idea, but its unique to each hero.  However, that also means you have to evaluate uptime on procs like Xero and Dazzler, you have to evaluate situational damage like Rorschach and SPIN, and you have to weigh multiple damage types on hybrid heroes.  All those require you to basically just make up percentages with no real data to support it."

To slightly expand on /u/droid327 's expansion of my post, if you want a more accurate weighting of things like uptime nodes, strip down in training room EXCEPT FOR POWER DURATION GEAR and beat on the TTK dummy for a bit with one point in these nodes. Note the uptime, and then try to ballpark your uptime on those procs. Since Power Duration affects Xerogenesis, Dazzler, etc, some players have a much easier time and benefit more from them than others."

You leave Midtown, it automatically takes you out of the party.

If I choose to leave the option on am I being forced to group with people?  It's not an opinion that grouping together makes grinding the various shared dailies, Genosha weeklies/dailies faster. Now I get that some people (including me sometimes) just prefer solo play or that some people might take advantage and just leech - so turn it off.   Also, you don't queue for terminals either but the option is there to automatically group so..  One last thing, this kind of feature would solve an issue with what we have now. The people that run around spamming party invites wouldn't need to do that anymore, and people that don't want to party would only need to turn it off and not be spammed by party invites."

In the story aspect, I want to see hero/team specific missions in future. What about Weapon X missions or an Avenger mission etc"
marvelheroes,3d6as7,satyanjoy,6,Tue Jul 14 01:33:51 2015 UTC,"I'm lookign forward to the unified story, I only ever ran it to get my power points/health/spirit rewards.  Glad I'll just need to roll through it once instead of 3 times now.  IT's not all positive though.  The removal of the XP pot reward and not being able to reset instances by changing difficulties are among the casualties."

marvelheroes,3d6as7,arcdevil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:44:12 2015 UTC,Has this been confirmed?  I know people were being encouraged to finish off Sinister in all difficulties for the pots.  Did they say anywhere that the item quest rewards would be given out when the difficulties were merged?
marvelheroes,3d6as7,matlockheed,2,Tue Jul 14 18:13:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, but this should have been this way since day 1 of the game. I honestly think they were too slow to implement this. It hurt grouping immensely."
marvelheroes,3d6as7,ProtonixChaos,5,Tue Jul 14 02:16:33 2015 UTC,There wasn't enough content day 1. Now that there's more content they can do this.
marvelheroes,3d6as7,ilion,2,Tue Jul 14 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"This is, in fact, the exact reason.  When we launched, we added in Heroic and Superheroic to make progression over the course of an individual map feel about right while at the same time still having 60 levels.  Now that we have a lot more content, we can do this, and in the process remove a number of irritating side effects.  Note, as well, that this is only the first of several large structural improvements to make it easier for people to play with each other and to play lower level content in a challenging and rewarded manner."
marvelheroes,3d6as7,gtuffli,2,Wed Jul 15 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"I'm glad this change is happening, and not having to run story mode three times per hero is good.  I just don't like the way it's happening, unfortunately.  One story mode from level 1 to level 60 is great for exactly one playthrough, then it's just a useless game mode.  I was hoping for a scaling story mode, similar to how MM and ICP work.  Every zone you enter is based off your own level.  If you're level 13 and you enter chapter 8, the mobs there are going to be 13-15.  If you are level 59 and enter chapter 1, mobs there will be 57-80, etc.  I guess this means there will be less story mode LQs in the pool to draw from now, though...so that's good."

And, actually, this is probably a good thing for LQs.  Story mode LQs will probably now be worth it, since those mobs will be your level, and will give much higher exp than they would have in the past.  I don't think they were expecting people to start leveling in story mode from now on or anything like that."

Loot is still better than in Holosim, there's usually people around to help down bosses, and you don't have to deal with annoying waves.

Also, it may be worth running Sinister in Story Mode a few times. You can earn a potion from him that gives +50% xp for 2 hrs. You can earn one per difficulty level per hero."

marvelheroes,3d8tgm,iBadgerRCM,3,Tue Jul 14 16:38:11 2015 UTC,"I've been using red terminals to level my alts recently. I don't know if it's because of the boosts to DPS/Survivability from synergies (although that doesn't seem to add very much), but since they scale with your level they don't seem too too difficult."
marvelheroes,3d8tgm,unsettlingideologies,2,Tue Jul 14 17:34:23 2015 UTC,Grab Cyclops asap. +10% exp from his level 50 synergy is so useful for levelling out a roster.
marvelheroes,3d8tgm,FullMetalCOS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:17:52 2015 UTC,"Well, he's not worse. Numerically, he's exactly the same. He's just less noticeable because your personal expectations have grown."
marvelheroes,3d8tgm,cronotose,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:24:58 2015 UTC,"You're referring to the bonus derived from leveling ANY hero, not Cyclops specifically. Cyclops' +10% hero synergy will be the same yesterday, today, and forever. Since you're going to be leveling SOME hero next, you get the same account bonus no matter who that is, Cyclops or not. The reason to do Cyclops specifically is the extra 10% which stays 10% no matter how many other heroes you've leveled before him. The only reason to do him earlier is so that you have that 10% active working for you earlier."
marvelheroes,3d8tgm,cronotose,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:23:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, my mistake.  Though what you refer to applies not only after you've fully leveled 10 heroes' synergies, but fully leveled 10 heroes that specifically apply to your main's build. By the time you have selective access to that many characters, the question itself becomes of very minor importance as a 10% bonus won't mean much to you anymore.  (edit: shoot, by the time I had that I was almost to 200% bonus anyway)Similarly, by the time you've gotten that far down the path of gearing out a hero, most content will fall pretty easy regardless of one non-dps synergy. I still use Cyke's synergy anytime I'm farming terminals as it really doesn't effect my completion times."
marvelheroes,3d8tgm,cronotose,2,Tue Jul 14 22:19:22 2015 UTC,"As stated here, get cyclops to 50 asap. Also you will want to look into getting a 20ish mole man medallion.   As for leveling, LQ's are the best way to level post 20. I would like to point out that you should do the shard quests, the daily influence quest, and hit each of the one shots every day before you settle into spamming LQ's. Granted, it's not as efficient as only spamming LQ's, but it's better to do it like this in the long run."

marvelheroes,3d8tgm,theankh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:04:34 2015 UTC,The fastest way to level other heroes up is to level cyclops first. His synergy will cut 10% off the time.
marvelheroes,3d8tgm,_ReclaimeR_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:16:41 2015 UTC,"Well... not exactly.  If we're leveling cyclops first, then we get 1 + .30 + .10, and 40% exp bonus will give you .71 the amount of time.  Second character will give you .625  200% exp synergy + cyclops will give you .32  so each bonus is worth incrementally less for exp to level.  But each bonus does make grinding omegas incrementally faster."

marvelheroes,3dbktn,RushlockTwitch,-9,Wed Jul 15 05:10:07 2015 UTC,So you actually think being robbed is a viable punishment for telling a tasteless joke? That's unheard of in virtually all MMOs.
marvelheroes,3dbktn,leroyyrogers,3,Wed Jul 15 05:48:24 2015 UTC,Again no one was robbed. It specifically states in the ToS if you violate any rules set by Gaz they have the right to permanently ban your account. By clicking agree on these terms your friend agreed to follow said rules. Nobody forced him to make this silly guild name he did so on his own accord because he thought it would be funny. Which in turn broke the ToS and to the surprise of no one but you and your buddy he was banned.
marvelheroes,3dbktn,avatarofshadow,-2,Wed Jul 15 05:53:16 2015 UTC,The senses of humor of those posting on this reddit are not what is being called into question.  How could it be obvious to anyone on here what your friend was or was not aware of?  His awareness isn't related to the issue.  Making a bad choice thru ignorance has no different result than a bad choice thru intent.  Your OP was asking if there was a way to be unbanned.  The only option posted is to submit a ticket and hope for the best.  That you think it is unfair/unjust or others posting that he deserved it are irrelevant.

The devs have evolved into absolute masters of fun gameplay and have created a highly addictive and satisfying rewards system.  On the other hand, they wave the banhammer with reckless abandon.  It's pretty extreme.  I was a founder and had sunk about $200 and about 300 hours (including beta testing) into the game, and was banned without warning, and without explanation.  To this day I can't even begin to guess why I was banned.  I got no responses on the forums or from appeals@marvelheroes.com.  It borders on criminal the way they ban people who have paid money, with no actual appeals, warning, or explanation process to speak of.    Honestly, fuck them - I'm disappointed they are still pulling this kind of shit.  Fun fact: Gaz has an F on BBB and doesn't seem to give a shit: http://www.bbb.org/greater-san-francisco/business-reviews/internet-gaming/gazillion-entertainment-in-san-mateo-ca-372205  They conduct themselves like amateurs on the business side, which is very sad, given that the game is incredible."

Gaz is almost certainly not going to unban you and if I were them I'd actually laugh at the appeal filed. Next time try actually thinking about stuff before you go ahead and do it. The ban was completely justified Gaz doesn't care if you are sorry you chose to maliciously break the ToS (that big long thing you click yes or agree on without reading in pretty much every online game ever) which you agreed to adhere by."

So no, I wouldn't say it's working perfectly when you can get banned for using offensive language in a private conversation."
marvelheroes,3dbktn,mvmtproductions,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:13:46 2015 UTC,It's their servers and chat channels. You're just using them.
marvelheroes,3dbktn,EMFCK,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:17:52 2015 UTC,"Who was being hurt by our conversation?  Why does it warrant a ban?  How is that ""working perfectly?""  Honestly it drives my suspicions that if a GM sees you say something they disagree with in a public channel (an opinion they don't like), they will just sift through all of your chat logs to find any sort of pretense to ban you.  I see people say worse things in social chat than we said in a private conversation, and I've seen worse in my supergroup chat which is also a semi-private channel but those people don't receive bans either.    So it doesn't seem to be an automated system finding all swear words.  A GM had to have actively looked through my chat logs, and I can't think of a reason to need to do that in my case since I don't swear in public channels.  Therefore I can only come up with the explanation above.  What makes matters worse is, as stated above, usually the person reviewing your ban is the one who enacted it.  So there is no real appeals process.  Maybe it's pointless even trying to debate this with you since clearly your opinion is set in stone."

The support system is a joke with Gaz and they don't give a shit about you basically if you get banned that is it!  I spoke to @Doomsaw and after the conversation got to so why is my girl banned I got no response back and support never emailed me back... I am well established in the game many moneys spent and been playing for two years so ya again no email back just straight silence.

In this case four accounts had the same password as my four accounts honestly having a system is better then no system at all so I can't judge them on that error however from my dealing with support and a rollback issue that costed me 5 es boosts has been terrible.
marvelheroes,3daxip,Drevs,23,Tue Jul 14 21:26:05 2015 UTC,"For some reason, a ton of people playing this game have a huge problem with there being tier lists of the heroes. I don't know why, because it's a totally valid thing to have, considering that no matter what Gaz does, some characters are going to be stronger and some weaker. It's not like we're saying ""you can't keep playing Loki because Scarlet Witch might be better""."
marvelheroes,3daxip,swescrane,9,Tue Jul 14 21:45:39 2015 UTC,"A large majority of the player base is casual. Most casuals don't like tier lists because they either don't like being told their hero sucks, or don't like being told the hero they play is OP. The ones that don't mind tier lists and try to contribute don't fully understand the entire roster and under/overvalue heroes, which with a roster this large is understandable if you don't play much. You can see how this creates massive disagreement and much arguing when a collaborative tier list is trying to be construed by the general public. And if more experienced and hardcore players make the list, everyone not included in the process feels butthurt and immediately dismisses the list 'because it's your opinion.'"
marvelheroes,3daxip,dragonsroc,2,Tue Jul 14 22:11:46 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think tier lists really add a whole lot to the game or the community.  There are, obviously, some heroes who are better than others in some or all situations, but having that list published and easily found doesn't really help anyone.  It encourages people to stay away from lower tier heroes because they ""aren't good enough"", and points those players instead towards the current top tier heroes.  There is, of course, the personal aspect of it as well.  Someone who loves Spider-Man isn't going to like being told that Spidey is lower tier (for example, don't jump on me Spider-fans), and there will also always be people who get mad because they are the one person who can solo red raids on Human Torch, a certifiably lower tier hero.  The casual aspect is really big here too.  This game makes no bones about it being casual, and that's wonderful.  We have a million games that are primarily for hardcore gamers and so on...but this isn't one of them.  Anyone can do pretty much any of the content with pretty much any hero.  Obvious exceptions aside (pre-review heroes), you can make it work if you want to.  So...the tier list is unnecessary."
marvelheroes,3daxip,MutatedSpleen,10,Tue Jul 14 22:25:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter regardless of whether or not a tier list exists. People will always gravitate towards the FotM. We don't have a tier list and people still understand that Doom and Scarlet Witch were ridiculously overpowered on release. We don't have a tier list and people still understand that Colossus is a terrible hero. In actuality, no tier list hurts some characters more than if it did exist. For example, people still believe Cable to be a bad hero because he's not reviewed when in actuality he's in a pretty solid spot. I can't count the number of people that say they would play him if he was good. If a tier list existed, they may realize that Cable is actually not bad and play him.  On another point, you yourself think Spider-Man is low tier right now. He's not. He is very much a solid hero after his unique rework and a tier list would reflect that. Up to date tier lists aren't meant to deter people from playing low tier heroes. They are meant to keep casual players up to date on the current meta if they miss hero changes or something. It's also useful to the devs as it can help pinpoint heroes that need help and those that don't. Tier lists have existed for decades and they don't deter people from playing low tiers any more than if the list didn't exist. If anything, it deters people from playing top tiers and instead play lower tiers to not appear a bandwagoner. It is a made up sentiment by casuals that don't want to be told their hero is low tier that hate tier lists.  A tier list is made by the hardcore, for the hardcore. A casual gains or loses nothing from the existence of one or not. If you casually play Smash, do you care whether or not Diddy is top tier? Does that affect how you play the game? To the majority of casuals, no it does not."

marvelheroes,3daxip,dragonsroc,2,Wed Jul 15 04:25:41 2015 UTC,"Thats a shame!  This post accomplished nothing that I intended, that was something of "" I rank this hero at ""X"" tier cause he does this and this but dont have that"". The few tier lists posted were standard top 4s or just trolling ones complaining about OP characters.  As you said in one of  your posts above, not having a concise tier list sometimes turns into having a pseudo tier list thats all messed up and a tier list could help some of unpopular champs to be played because even without a tier list even I that play this game since friday already realized that Cap, SW and Doom are the best ones so a tier list as some people say wont make those champions the go to cause they already are...it would make some mid tier or even low mid tier ones being noticed cause maybe they are not that bad as people think.  I was also curious about the state/gameplay/potential of some champions which I thought it would be discuss on this thread, cause being new there are champions I rarely or never have seen(Mr. Fantastic, X-23, Emma Frost, Dr. Strange, Invisible Woman, Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, Psyloche, etc) and I would like to get some intel on them, but the post turned out disappointing."
marvelheroes,3daxip,dragonsroc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:35:23 2015 UTC,"Well I can tell you about them.  Mr. F has always been in a good place dps-wise. His problem is that his kit roots him in place with long animations. His main dps skill is a 2s channeled beam that offers no damage reduction so he's basically a sitting duck for 2s while using it and he uses it every 2 or 3 seconds.  X-23 is in a good spot. She's got two viable builds with a varying degree of hybrids in between. Her bleed build is slightly better than her movement, but both are solid. She isn't a tanky melee which is why she's unpopular. But if you aren't incompetent and actually know how to use dashes to avoid things, then you will be fine.  Emma is just getting a unique QoL this patch. Can't say much about her.  Strange is OK. His damage is fine. His survivability is hard as it relies on positioning and a good use of his taunt. His kit revolves around layering a ton of DoTs and he requires two hotbars to play which is why he's not as popular.  IW is a mom.  MK is solid. He's got a cool playstyle that revolves around being as low health and spirit as possible. You see people think he's immortal at low health and stand in every attack and die. They get frustrated and so they don't play him. If you understand that even if your tankiness goes way up at low health that you're not immortal, you will be fine.  MsM is solid. Her damage is good and her tankiness is one of the best in the game. Her problem is that her kit is just kind of boring.  Psylocke is good. If you like high mobility, and moving around like a ninja, she's for you. Her problem is that the newer heroes deal the same damage (or better) as her and don't have a difficult rotation. Psylocke is a very hard hero to master her rotation for optimal dps."

marvelheroes,3daxip,HuggableBear,2,Tue Jul 14 23:53:12 2015 UTC,"Basically a tier list is most often useless/ a lot of work. The patches come and go and the updates sometime bring buff, sometimes being nerfs and sometimes being small or big bugs.  Personally, I think a valide tier list would focus on heroes viability and why.  For example, you'd need a tier for DP and cable for their 52. you'd also need another tier for strange and whoever else still needs their hero uniques reviews.  You'd need a tier for heroes that need ""more gear"" to be/feel viable for end game content.  A list for viable end game plays, in this case a list for cosmic terms, another for CMM and finally for raids. A list for levelling experience.   Finally youd need a link to subpoena's ttk thread for people who value that in a tier list.  (There was an old list way back when on the MH forum that englobed a lot of that)  Examples of what I mean Strange still need his unique hero review so he's need for any/boss uniques to obtain optimal numbers for dpsing are high so he requires a bit more gearing than say SW or Iron man.  Jean Grey while fun to level, is not necessarily super fun to raid with. (now keep in mind this list would suck as this is most likely based off personnal opinions)  Anyway, if you want to make A tier list, that's a bad idea.  If you want to make multiple tier list with the objective to outline critical information to help out newcomers pick a hero that is viable and they won't regret playing, to help people's biaised opinion on certain heroes or simply to orient hero playstyles and get people interested in certain heroes because they match their playstyles, go for it, that has the potential to be awesome...but to also take a lot of work. Either way, good luck with your project"

Basically, bad uniques? Lower tier. Slow Animations/Clunky Skills? Lower tier. Low health with good uniques? Lower tier.  Something like Juggernaut with smooth animations, good uniques, high health and pretty great damage will be a higher tier, but not on a ""god"" tier. Someone like Luke Cage, who has terrible uniques, clunky animations, and a skill tree that is almost completely worthless, will be on one of the lowest tiers. (though he will be separate from cable/dp) That is not to say that LC is unplayable, with the perfect setup he can be really tanky and have some HUGE brutals, but again... that sets him lower than the others in a tier list because difficulty to gear/to play/do well is a contributing factor in these types of tier lists."

marvelheroes,3d6itr,BattleBra,6,Mon Jul 13 22:24:29 2015 UTC,I support this gate.  CMM is the most difficult content out side of red raid and axis. A fresh 60 with less than 100 omega's has better things to do. Their presence in CMM hurts them and everyone else. It has nothing to do with who's better. It has everything to do with pulling your own weight.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Ishakaru,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:23:30 2015 UTC,The problem is that a fresh 60 doesn't have anything better to do. Once you get your uniques and buy your legendary there's no place that will give you omegas or gear anywhere nearly as quick as CMM. Every other aspect of the game is a waste of time comparatively.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,twosmokes,5,Tue Jul 14 14:52:44 2015 UTC,"As a new player I'd been playing Venom, went in CMM and got stomped. Then I took in the winter soldier and had to play smart 100% of the time staying stealthed, picking my fights, and dodging every hit. I made 400 Omega Points in 3 days. Some of the most fun I had with the game. Now I go back and the rest of the game seems bland by comparison.  I'd be very disappointed if I was gated out of CMM. Seems like a great place to take friends and gear them. I was hoping to take all my fresh 60's in once I had omega points to gear them with uniques.  hopefully it's not too restrictive."

marvelheroes,3d6itr,okramv,0,Wed Jul 15 11:44:06 2015 UTC,"The idea is to have the gate set up so that each character, through a combination of gear, omegas, and good gameplay, has to earn the right to enter cosmic patrols. The last I heard this gate was going to require defeating difficult enemies within a set amount of time without dying.   It's hard to tell exactly where they'll set that bar, but as long as your Winter Soldier can deal enough damage in that gate it sounds like you'd be OK. Maybe not (yet) with Venom, but as you gear Venom up and earn more omegas you'd be able to clear the gate."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,fefzero,6,Tue Jul 14 16:20:11 2015 UTC,"One shots, Shared quests, influence quests, getting drops from cosmic bosses.  All of these are important things to do, and consume at least a couple hours a day. At the same time, gear will drop while doing these things.  Then there's leveling up other heroes for synergies.   As for /r/QuorumOf4 , if the gate is done right he won't be left out of CMM. Where he lacks in gear he makes up in skill. I don't approve of a simple ""all 69 gear? go ahead"" check as that doesn't weed out bad players.  Risk vrs reward dictates that CMM should give better every thing. But to say that you shouldn't have to do anything other than be 60 to get in? Now you're putting all the extra risk you can't handle onto other people and reaping a reward for their extra effort.  I don't give 2 hoots about who's better, who's played longer. It doesn't matter. But if someone can't pull their own weight, they don't deserve to be in there. They need to do the stuff needed to pull their own weight and stop expecting people to give them everything."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Ishakaru,3,Tue Jul 14 16:15:57 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem - You'll get more useful loot from 30 minutes of CMM than you will in 20 hours of farming cosmic instances, or doing shared quests, doing one shots.   And while I realize that synergies are important, it's completely counter-intuitive that the way to improve a character you like is to not play him.  I could understand gating if we were talking about some third tier of MM that consistently dropped items with challenge bonuses or had a higher ilvl, but the problem is that Gaz has setup a situation where the best place (and therefore only if you want to be efficient) to get the base level gear a fresh 60 needs is in the one place where nobody wants fresh 60s."

This is the real problem.  Loot everywhere else is pretty awful by comparison.  I'm OK with a gate, as long as they improve drops somewhere else to at least make other areas an option.  Why not start with one shots?"
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Gilaim11,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"As a new player, meaning I've put in 400 hours marathon style into the game in the last x days than I want to reveal..  20sec Cosmic Juggernaut term runs on Nightcrawler (or slow 45sec Cosmic Kurse runs) 3min to clear all boss wave+all optional boss clears in normal midtown patrol on Juggernaut...  ...Makes me disagree with the useful loot of 20 hours worth of cosmic terminal farming.  You could easily farm zoo for the achievements doing it 80 times, same with Axis in this time.  And leave time for raids, cosmic terminal farming.  People may not get a single ACOC from Juggernaut in the 400 runs to obtain their first Black Tom's, but the way to get good is to focus on improving your game knowledge before you dump in a bunch of time farming inefficiently. Some players are there to just have a good time and get free loot, luckily I have a drive to do the best with ample available time. :)  I wish I was turned onto Top Tier heroes sooner and encouraged to stick with them to reduce the loot curve early on.  These two heroes I quoted are the only cosmic patrol capable ones I have with two getting close in a roster of 11 60s which each sucked up their own time leveling slowly without the benefit of more than their own poorly rolled uniques and moving around 5 level 70 legendaries to a new hero to conserve odin marks.   The more you know, the more fun the game is opening up the variety of ways you can get powerful quickly.  If I ever want to turn on the loot wagon, I'll hit up Juggernaut on a 20-25sec start to finish rotation and trade Black Tom's and ACOCs away for GOKs and other currency to acquire the things that are difficult to get due to # of attempts like SCS, ILAS, etc or not soloable."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Supra93,-1,Wed Jul 15 03:18:17 2015 UTC,"To get the base gear, it would take 2-3 hours... I think that's how long it took me on a hero that I leveled a couple weeks ago. I then proceeded to level the items to i69, blessed my artifacts, and by this time my i80 legendary had already hit a couple levels. Then, still sub geared as far as I was concerned, walked into cMM. A hero that was less than 5 hours old at 60. But I have 5k omega, and the resources to bring my gear to a minimum level.   Now I don't expect people to be at my level of resources/omega, but I do expect people to be able to.... here's that statement again... carry their own weight.   I just don't see how you're alright with someone that created their account last weekend, has their first 60 ever and comes strolling into cMM with one or two uniques, a couple cosmics, artifacts that might not be total junk (not blessed of course), no legendary and a grand total of 25 omega. Requiring anything above that is a gate, and the gate might as well be put at a level that matches up with the content behind it."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Ishakaru,2,Tue Jul 14 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that CMM is where fresh 60s should go. I'm saying, as it stands, it's the only place for them to go. It takes far more than 2-3 hours to bring items to i69 and get blessed artifiacts. If you were to try to get there from scratch you're looking at weeks if not months to bring a character to a level where you deign them sufficient to be allowed into CMM.  We're forcing people (in an MMO remember) to play a solo instanced game for a couple of months until they're allowed to play with other players.   The person who strolls into CMM with one or two uniques, an unleveled legendary and 0 omega will have full uniques, a half leveled legendary, potentially some artifact upgrades, enough omega to get started,  and the credits to start rerolling after 20-60 minutes. Why wouldn't they want to go in there and how is anyone going to convince them it's not where they want to be?"

I honestly don't know how geared they would need to be in order to hit that mark. I doubt it's anywhere near my level, or the top geared people. Hence the gate.

Omegas take time...nothing else.  CMM will give you some gear, but not always BiS for every slot.    Hell, go achievement hunting and burn the Coffers you acquire for gear.  There are options, use them."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,stondius,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:48:54 2015 UTC,I know there are ways to do things outside of cosmic MM. Cosmic MM speeds everything up substantially. Omegas come rolling in in CMM unlike everywhere else in the game.  What takes an hour in CMM takes 4 hours outside. It's why people want to be in there. If they didn't nobody would care about gating because nobody would want to go.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,twosmokes,2,Tue Jul 14 18:56:00 2015 UTC,"It only speeds it up substantially if you aren't doing well enough outside of it. Do you know why this is? It's because you're not doing well enough in cosmic terminals to reap the rewards. The only exception to this is Midtown Mondays, for obvious reasons. I don't bother with cMM/cICP anymore unless my Supergroup has a ""private"" instance running, because there are too many undergeared people dragging down the speed at which boss waves can be cleared. I know what I'm saying seems harsh, but it's painfully true."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,KamahlFoK,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"So true.  The shortcut to use cosmic patrols is to leverage the strength of other heroes, so instead of fast 1min boss wave clears, we have zerg fests.  That might be fun for some if their goal is to beat the wave timer.    Arguments that leverage time often fail to consider the gaming experience of well geared heroes who have to sustain a longer fight for everyone to get loot.  The wave timer might not expire, but it doesn't require math genius to calculate how many additional waves that could be completed without a prolonged fight."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Supra93,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't agree on speeding it up.  Cosmic = best rewards, as long as I am there to collect it for dying repeatedly it's a path to better gear.  It's not a substitute for understanding the loot system and targeting a particular item for a build.  I could beat my face against the cosmic patrol wall and not become better at the game, only better at how to survive and not become a contributor until specific artifacts and gear drop that take hours, days, weeks of farming to obtain.  What's faster for some is slower for others."

marvelheroes,3d6itr,rewtamus,3,Tue Jul 14 07:37:00 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time understanding the purpose of Cosmic MM with gating. Any loot it drops are items that fresh 60s need. It drops tons of XP that new players with low Omega points need. Once you get geared, what's the point of doing MM anymore? Why setup a gate to keep out the only players who actually need loot from it?  As an aside, I think part of the problem is that they called it ""Cosmic"". The cosmic instances become ridiculously easy even for an undergeared player. A player moves on from farming green/reds to cosmics at 60. So players think ""Why not move from MM to cosmic MM at 60?"""

It is a mini-boss you have to solo per character to enter the Cosmic MM/ICP versions of those zones.

You are spouting elitist BS without even understanding the mechanics of the gate.  It is not a numerical gear/OMEGA check, it is a trial solo instance to see if you are deemed ready.  The gate also provides some metrics for Gaz on characters that may need some help; i.e. if 100 venoms can get in but only 3 emmas, then Emma either needs better powers, better gear, or something to make her more interesting to end-game players."

The intent is not to set some crazy high elite bar, but rather is mostly there to communicate to players when they are ready for the cosmic version.  Will it address all problems?  Obviously, no, but if it alleviates some of them, it has a discernible benefit to the game.

The balancing necessary on the gating has to be so fine that I don't know if I have faith that Gaz can pull it off: they aren't known for their balancing prowess in particular.

Comment:   Refined gear - Check Acquired Omegas - Check Higher risk/reward - Check   The only thing I think missing from this is:   Experience with the variety of hero powers available. If your gear loadout compliments your power selection, awesome.    Why is it such an insult to folks from those that want to run in this zone efficiently?  Leech all you want, just don't penalize my game time until the system is improved to make it balanced.  We all want the same thing, to kill faster and get more loot.    You invest the time to solo this content, we invest the time together to farm it.   That's a reasonable request, let's give Gaz time to deliver on that starting with the gate and see what happens next."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Supra93,0,Tue Jul 14 00:05:26 2015 UTC,It will be interesting to see what they do. I can't see it being enough to placate the players that are going crazy over it taking 10-20 seconds longer to kill a boss.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Dirk_8,5,Tue Jul 14 01:32:34 2015 UTC,"Leechers also make it harder to survive, not just kill faster."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Naurhir,6,Tue Jul 14 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"It's much more than 10-20sec.  When I inspected 8 of the people who were around me during a boss wave, all of them looked like they were fresh lvl60s with undergeared artifacts, uniques, no blessings, no relics, and sometimes no legendary."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,CosmonautDrifter,0,Tue Jul 14 09:38:52 2015 UTC,I feel like I've read this more than once. Perhaps the fights would have gone more quickly if you weren't taking the time to inspect everyone?
marvelheroes,3d6itr,HandsUpDontBan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"Usually when a fight as been going on for more than 5 minutes and not a single boss is below 75% I take a step back and do a quick check. Usually only takes 10-30 seconds dependung on the amount of people.... then I endure for the next 5-10 minutes as the boss don't die. While its not always that extreme, more often than not there's only 1-2 people attacking said bosses with the rest chilling on the side... so yes, sometimes it'll take a while"
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Mandroll,-3,Wed Jul 15 01:24:30 2015 UTC,Don't the bosses generally despawn after a few minutes? Pretty sure its 5. To my knowledge I've never had a boss wave last longer than that (even a 6 pack with a bunch of cosmic balls of doom floating around). And the only times I've seen bosses despawn was in an underpopulated instance at a wacky time of day. So due respect but I don't buy your story.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,HandsUpDontBan,-5,Mon Jul 13 22:42:20 2015 UTC,"They do, I was expecting you to just call it out so I could point out how whiny you were and pointing out how said the bosses didnt die... but then you wrote a paragraph and mentionned you had a hard time sometimed in underpopulated instances... so I feel kinda bad for baiting you. Sorry"

marvelheroes,3d6itr,marlokow,0,Tue Jul 14 02:19:24 2015 UTC,How about we just keep the people who are not geared out of content they obviously cannot handle. You know..like the devs plan on doing.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,CosmonautDrifter,-3,Tue Jul 14 03:49:28 2015 UTC,Or how about you don't be an elitist asshole about it? Want to avoid people get your own gear checked raid going.   You can get together and have a nice circle jerk about your gears.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,HandsUpDontBan,-1,Tue Jul 14 05:11:13 2015 UTC,Forming raids isn't for CMM you dunce. Maybe if you knew jack shit about the game you wouldn't sound like a fucking clueless clown.  I'm sorry you're not competent enough to understand your noob ass shouldn't be in CMM. You'd think getting rekt by the bosses and white mobs would be an indication in and of itself... but apparently you and the rest of the undergeared clowns are too damn dense.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,CosmonautDrifter,0,Tue Jul 14 05:21:17 2015 UTC,"AHAHAHHAHAHAHA ""gear shame""? Wtf....I bet you're an avid user of tumblr and use such words such as, ""man splanning"", ""man spreading"", ""white privileged"", etc...  Raids would not help weeding out the leechers in CMM, that's what we are talking about here...or are you too stupid to read and comprehend that?"
marvelheroes,3d6itr,CosmonautDrifter,3,Tue Jul 14 05:46:00 2015 UTC,"10-20 seconds longer... lol, good one. If it only took 10-20 seconds longer to kill bosses with leechers around, nobody would complain."
marvelheroes,3d6itr,C_L_I_C_K,3,Tue Jul 14 10:53:36 2015 UTC,Its not 10 - 20 seconds. If I can kill the entire boss wave myself solo ( I am not super top tier geared) faster than 5 people there is something wrong and that is how cMM is half the time. If you had the option to have you own instance sure they could not gate it but you can't.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Morphoo,-4,Tue Jul 14 14:41:14 2015 UTC,Yes. Yes they would.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,HandsUpDontBan,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:39:53 2015 UTC,YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Less leeches in CMM.  I will actually bother to play CMM on Mondays again.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,ProfJackAss,-4,Tue Jul 14 22:21:13 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people are hating on 'leechers'.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,Kirilli,2,Tue Jul 14 23:21:19 2015 UTC,Because that spot in the zone could instead have been filled by a player that does something helpful.
marvelheroes,3d6itr,tarrach,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:03:06 2015 UTC,Its not hating on leechers. Its that if there are 4+ in the zone the bosses won't die as the scaling on the health per person is crazy. I was in cMM yesterday and two of us were clearing bosses faster than 6+ due to the fact we were both geared. It was quite refreshing

marvelheroes,3d71qe,Voykid,6,Tue Jul 14 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"He's very good endgame and also very fun to play. Lots of zipping around (one of the best dashes in the game IMO), chucking grenades, lining up mobs and popping off skillshots, swooping in for daring kills with Close Quarters (massive damage melee/assassinate attack but kind of finicky to use). He's squishy but not too squishy. Basically your standard glass cannon. His voice acting is pretty good, too. He's also got one of the coolest costumes in the game (headphones variant).  Even if you don't care for him he's worth it just for his synergies (+4% crit to energy attacks)."

marvelheroes,3d71qe,ajs427,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:59:08 2015 UTC,I see him more than before in CMM and he seems to hold is own. Plus is synergy can be good for you now and in the futur for other characters
marvelheroes,3d71qe,ccthibault,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:33:21 2015 UTC,He's my main main right now. Really good late game. Awesome damage and decent survivability. Stupid easy to gear (all his uniques are bis). I say go for it.
marvelheroes,3d71qe,EvilAdolf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:01:00 2015 UTC,He's fun. I leveled him to 60 in a weekend. I'm not a fan of ranged so I can't speak for endgame but he does get better
marvelheroes,3d71qe,WhatImMike,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:23:35 2015 UTC,"He can hold his own.  His damage is actually quite respectable, though he's fairly squishy.  If you like him as a character, or like his gameplay, he's absolutely good enough to properly gear.  Take my opinion for what it's worth though, I'm a Cable/Luke Cage main."
marvelheroes,3d71qe,Quexana,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:03:31 2015 UTC,"With a legendary for spirit issues, he's easier to deal with.  He's not in my top 20, but I play him to get use out of the variant costume I bought.    And now I have my movie Groot team-up."
marvelheroes,3d71qe,avatarofshadow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:36:17 2015 UTC,"spirit issues   You're doing it wrong.  His elemental gun skills don't take spirit unless you're out of elemental ammo, and you should never run out of elemental ammo.  Use Fire and Air ammo.  Stack up the fire DoT, dump your ammo with Blast, then switch to air and dump your ammo with barrage.  Rinse and repeat while weaving starship powers in between to make sure you're never using your gun when out of ammo.  Spirit should never be an issue with Star Lord (Who?).  His costs are intentionally high to punish you for not using his elemental gun the way it was designed."
marvelheroes,3d71qe,HuggableBear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:03:26 2015 UTC,yes he gets pretty good in full starlord uniques. took me a while to get them all. i will say its good to avoid the stupid energy gun tree. very underpowered and pretty terrible. focus on your cryo nade and ship powers.
marvelheroes,3d71qe,Zukuto,9,Tue Jul 14 23:35:20 2015 UTC,"That is just incorrect. Currently his ""Elemental Gun"" build has his best TTK, it does require a bit more management of DoTs from Fire Ammo, and you have to be careful not to stack too much Attack Speed. But its definitely more effective then his ""EoC"" build, and requires far less spirit management as you can always fall back on Air ammo."
marvelheroes,3d71qe,ThanosBuster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:10:08 2015 UTC,"really? i always felt it was poor damage and took too long to kill anything, required a lot of dodging. how did u distribute points in this tree? i had 20 earth ammo and 20 in the first gun skill, so load earth ammo and hold down the other skill and wait too long. was i doing it wrong?"
marvelheroes,3d71qe,Zukuto,2,Tue Jul 14 01:13:28 2015 UTC,"http://marvelheroes.info/build/1889/  That's the starting point to the build, however there is plenty of customization you can do. But essentially Fire Blast brutes pretty damn hard and is very spammable. I also tend to avoid CQ like this build because of how squishy SL is (not to mention if you spam it too quickly it tends to bug out). Earth is just pretty bad IMO, I played around with Water and it was fun in cMM, but didn't do as much damage. I would also suggest throwing something in Cyronade just as a fallback if you need to kite or help keep some trash off of you."
marvelheroes,3d71qe,ThanosBuster,3,Tue Jul 14 01:16:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Fire/Air is the better damage output. You want to open with Fire, Barragex5 for stacks to then hit with Blast, throw in an cluster or strafe, one more barrage to refresh DoT and throw another blast, one more barrage if you still have energy but then swap to Air, barrage until blast, cluster or strafe (whichever you didn't use in fire), barrage until blast. Put in the sig when possible (with refresh, typically between blast CDs).  It's a fair bit more effort than a lot of builds, but I find it fun and it definitely has pretty good damage.  For OP, pre-late game, just throw 20 points into Elemental Shot/Air/Earth and murder trash with chain bouncing shot, and enjoy that his elemental skills use ammo instead of spirit."
marvelheroes,3d71qe,Uler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:06:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's only marginally more difficult because of Ammo management, but I completely agree. I think SL is very fun to play and I would suggest you give him a try if your at all interested in him. Leveling is easy, he has plenty of trash clearning / boss focus."

When there's disagreement between Gaz and Marvel on which version of a hero to use, they usually just release one as an Enhanced Costume at release - see Nova and Ant-Man.  EDIT: Pretty sure the Advance Pack page had an image of male Blade, but I can't find it now."
marvelheroes,3d6ui5,FullMetalCOS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"it does have male Blade.  I mostly posted this for fun, and people went INSANE about it.  Agent Venom had a teenage sidekick, and nobody noticed her.  I hope she gets to be an enhanced costume, too."
marvelheroes,3d6ui5,Galyndean,6,Wed Jul 15 00:09:22 2015 UTC,"Why do they have to keep taking male characters and stuffing a girl into it?  Why can't they just create female characters that are actually their own character and not just 'the female x.'  I understand that they're trying to use brand recognition to sell, but seriously, it's just fucking insulting at this point."
marvelheroes,3d6ui5,MutatedSpleen,4,Tue Jul 14 11:20:30 2015 UTC,"Why does it always have to be a man who follows a man? Isn't that MORE insulting? At this point, how many different heroes have worn the Captain America persona (or Spiderman, or one of a hundred different heroes)? Why does it always have to be a man that takes on that persona? More importantly, why does it matter what race/sex/religion they are, when in uniform they will still be Captain America(or whoever), just a fresh take on it, another example is the new Wolverine, its still Laura wearing her ""mentor's"" costume, she is just carrying on his legacy, they are not saying she IS Logan.  I'm struggling to remember this much fuss being kicked about when Kate Bishop took on the Hawkeye mantle, yet suddenly having someone follow in the footsteps of an existing hero is a massive offence, even though comic books have been doing it for years.   Isn't the true insult the fact that people find this offensive?"
marvelheroes,3d6ui5,Galyndean,4,Tue Jul 14 11:46:36 2015 UTC,"Well, if you want explanation from me personally, I didn't like characters like She-Hulk when I was a kid.  I mean, she couldn't even have her own name, she's just the 'female Hulk.'  I do realize that she is her own character, but to me, she was just another character who couldn't have a personality without a guy, whereas Jean Grey, Rogue, Jubilee, etc were all much cooler because they could be characters in their own right.  Look, I don't have an issue with Blade having a daughter and training her to hunt vampires.  That's fine and dandy.  I have an issue with someone who is not Blade being called Blade in yet another attempt to 'diversify' by shoehorning in a female character with a non-identity.  As for Kate Bishop, I can't speak to that since I wasn't going into the young avengers.  Maybe guys are more okay with gender swapping."
marvelheroes,3d6ui5,shawnomega,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:15:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what a fucking asshole.  How dare Blade train his daughter to hunt vampires and then bestow his mantle upon her.  What a prick.  That shit doesn't make any sense at all."

marvelheroes,3d6ui5,jabroni_jim,3,Tue Jul 14 03:09:39 2015 UTC,"It's not a gender swap. She's being trained by Blade she isn't Blade, well not yet anyway. She's Blade's daughter."
marvelheroes,3d6ui5,MutatedSpleen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:10:46 2015 UTC,"But Blade is actually in the book. She's Blade's daughter, so if you go into this series expecting Blade you'll get him. To what extent I have no idea but you'll get him and her.   I really don't see the problem. I mean we weren't even getting a Blade series before, now we are. And there is potential for a new and interesting character to come along with it.   My favorite character in comics is Hawkeye (Clint Barton) but I love Hawkeye (Kate Bishop) as well. There is also Ms Marvel which is an amazing series and character. So the thought of this isn't really something that deters me from checking out. If the book is terrible then I drop it and chances are Blade will be back at some point.   That's the great things about comics if you don't like one run the next might be something you're into.   There is also the fact that I don't think they ever actually called her Blade anywhere again that may change in the book but as of now the writer has been saying it's a book about both Blade and his daughter who is a new hunter."
marvelheroes,3d6ui5,jabroni_jim,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:12:47 2015 UTC,"This was a poor title for the post, then:  ""There's a New 'BLADE' Coming to the Marvel Universe"".  I saw that and figured we were getting another gender swap.    It's not just the gender swapping I don't care for, though.  I don't like the idea that various superhero identities are just roles/mantles for whomever they want to step into the role at the time.  Captain America is Steve Rogers, period.  Do we really need ten other people to play Captain America?  This isn't a James Bond flick.  There's Cap and there are other guys.  Same for all the Mrs Marvels, Spider-Mans, etc.  As long as they're not calling the new girl, ""Blade"", I've got to give them credit for at least attempting to put a new character out there with their own identity rather than a Kamala Khan = Mrs Marvel situation."

That's a totally serious question, and I don't mean it in a demeaning or offensive way.  But there have been numerous people (at least 11) to wear the Captain America suit and call themselves (and be called by others) Captain America.  Steve Rogers is the original and, possibly, the greatest.  But he's not the only one.  Iron Man is the same story.  James Rhodes was Iron Man for over two years.  Furthermore, how come we don't get all mad when they repurpose popular heroes for spinoff series like 2099?  These spinoffs change hero identities constantly, and nobody bats an eye-lash.  But when we start talking about the mantle of a well-known hero passing on to a female character, holy shit, whoah, slow down!  That's too far!  To actually answer your question though...do we really need ten people to play Captain America?  In a word: yes.  Unless we want a comic canon where nobody ages, gets injured, dies, or changes in any way at all."

It doesn't matter if the new person is a woman, dinosaur, Muslim, or purple dude.  As to the comic canon with regard to people not aging or dying... well... uh... are you saying that people age and die in comics?  Because last I checked, these people tend to not age (ok, yeah, once in a while you'll have a story where you get something like Old Man Logan.  In general, which of the X-Men, for example, have aged since their inception in the 60s?) and death is only a setback."

There's a very easy and simple answer, and I want to see if you can figure it out (note: you could easily just search my name in this thread and see where I explained this to someone else).  I find it kind of interesting...the whole ""why can't they..."" argument is literally the only argument you guys can come up with.  I haven't seen an even half-way reasonable argument besides this one about why well established hero mantles shouldn't be passed on to female characters.  Not one.

Maybe women simply don't like being considered nothing more than a lesser version of a male who already exists for the sake of ticking a box to say 'we're more diverse than before?!?!@!?!?!?!!?'.  I know I don't.  I'm not a fan of seeing women starting off as marginalized and degrading characters that I've grown up with by making them replaceable.  It's not my thing.  Maybe it's yours.

You're going into this assuming that the female heroes carrying these mantles are going to be worse for no reason other than it makes you uncomfortable that a name you are familiar with is being piloted by a gender you apparently can't stand to read.  As for the ""degrading characters that I've grown up with""...that's your own problem, buddy.  Logan isn't going anywhere, he's just not wearing the yellow and blue spandex anywhere.  This isn't replacement, this is character evolution.  He's not gone, he's different.  You're only hurting yourself by refusing to see this."

I don't even understand that line of thinking.  I'm upset because I want to read stories with characters of my own gender that are actual characters and not derivatives checking a box of another character already done.  If you can't understand why a woman would want that, then I don't know what to tell you.    I can tell you that I'm done with this conversation."

As for the rest, I (apparently) wrongly assumed you were one of the nigh infinite men throwing a hissy fit about these female characters.  Reddit has a dramatic overpopulation of men, and I made a common assumption based off of that.  My apologies.  I understand not wanting bastardized derivations of female characters - I get that.  What I don't get is how you can consider these well established B-tier female characters (Kitty Pryde, X-23, Jane Foster) being promoted to A-tier lead roles as a bastardized derivation.  I don't understand how Kitty Pryde calling herself Star-Lord is any different than when she called herself Ariel, or Sprite, or Shadowcat.  It's literally just a name and an outfit.  I hope you choose to address that before you are officially done with the conversation."

marvelheroes,3d6ui5,Aurunz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:31:19 2015 UTC,"But they're doing it already. It's like promoting existing female characters or creating new heroes is nigh impossible   Name the most recent genuinely new hero with a large following you can think of.  Go ahead, look it up, I'll wait.  While you're there, go ahead and list off a few female heroes who aren't part of a team primarily led by and made up of men, or aren't female versions of male heroes to begin with.  Here, I'll help you with that second one by going through the current heroes available in MH:  Black Widow (Avengers) Emma Frost (X-Men) Invisible Woman (Fantastic Four) Jean Grey (X-Men) Ms. Marvel Psylocke (X-Men) Rogue (X-Men) Scarlet Witch (Avengers) She-Hulk (Hulk) Squirrel Girl (X-Men/Avengers) Storm (X-Men) X-23 (X-Men)    Of the female characters in this game, there is literally one who started out as her own lead character.  The rest were either team-members (not leaders), or villains (e.g., Black Widow) before turning good and joining a team.  So...what you said though, that creating new heroes or promoting existing heroes being nigh impossible, yes, you're right.  It's exactly that.  The Marvelverse is so flooded with characters that they can't seriously bring more in and expect anybody to give a fuck since they already have these well-established heroes to read.  I suppose you could launch some of the members of various teams into their own solo roles, but again, we're just looking at more clutter in an already cluttered canon.  Is Storm popular enough to marquee her own book against books like X-Men and Avengers?  Personally, I doubt it would work.

Do not listen to those people. If you do, you will regret it because you will want Coulson eventually and there's a cap on earning Omega files.   he wont want Coulson eventually, because he eventually will get Clea, which has nearly the same DPS as Coulson, while providing a barrage of utility (+health, +defense, +25% mitigation shield) which Coulson does not.   once you get Clea, there's literally zero reason to ever look at another TU unless you want them purely for the looks"
marvelheroes,3d52tu,avatarofshadow,-2,Mon Jul 13 23:30:31 2015 UTC,"^ @OP, this is the shortsighted advice I'm talking about.   it isnt shortsighted in the very least. Its a reality that Clea is bounds and leaps better than any other TU right now, and thats after a balance pass, so they deem her ""fair and square"" atm. We dont know the future, they might aswell consider her balanced forever even tho she's glaringly not...They do that a lot for the heroes roster.  If your gonna offer the OP advices, a good starting point is telling him what works now, not driving him away from it.  And even if you were somehow right and Gaz, for the first time ever, actually strived for a real balance and bothered to make all TUs factually equal, then that begs the question...if Coulson was the same as everyone else, why would I want him specifically when any other would make me the exact same service?  So basically, unless someone wants Coulson for the only reason of being...well...Coulson....there is absolutly no reason to get him with the files when they could use those to get better items for their main heroes which actually are the focus of the game, then get the TU they prefer with ES  basically you are wrong in all acounts, and too damn stubborn to admit it.

marvelheroes,3d52tu,unsettlingideologies,2,Tue Jul 14 15:35:24 2015 UTC,Depends on what you want more really. Myself I don't need the team up so I always buy the blue boxes.  For worldstones I mainly play summoners so I got the recipes first for the runewords then I got the recipe for the cosmic upgrade for insignias. Now the only thing I purchase is the doop runes.  Armor drives will depend on what new items come with the revamped event this month. If nothing new grabs my attention I'll be getting the artifacts as a starting point.
marvelheroes,3d52tu,Zukuto,4,Wed Jul 15 06:52:26 2015 UTC,"Everyone will tell you to save up for Coulson. However, unless you are particularly fond of Coulson or want to collect everything, I disagree. There are other team-ups who are strictly better than Coulson, and you can get team-ups for eternity splinters. Plus, depending on when you started playing during the Anniversary, you may have gotten the free Iron Man team-up.  The Blue Boxes, on the other hand, will give you boss uniques, including some of the BIS gear in the game. Some of the gear in there is ludicrously good and it's great to not have to spend hours/days/weeks farming for it.  As for the cosmic worldstones, it doesn't sound like you have any hybrid heroes yet so the things you'll get won't be super important right away. That being said, the Power Cosmic legendary is BIS for many hybrid characters as is the Power Doop Runeword. I think the Doop Inspiration recipe is maybe BIS for summoners, but I don't think SG's summons work the same way."

There's no reason to invest all that in creating entirely new resources (tilesets, bosses and enemies, art and sound and animation assets, etc.) and then not use it to make non-story content.  I bet the motion comics are a big PITA for them too.  Not the actual animation, which is just Flash or whatever, but getting people in to do more VA for a 10-second clip that can only be used for that one thing."

The latter patrol is based off of an existing tile set, but the cells are actually all new.

marvelheroes,3d3391,tarrach,9,Mon Jul 13 10:55:17 2015 UTC,"unless they plan to remove story mode lqs, there's a good chance to outlevel the content.  also, it penalizes play through of story mode with new characters by removing free sample of the only type of boost that clearly works."
marvelheroes,3d3391,notsam57,0,Mon Jul 13 06:59:48 2015 UTC,"A brand new player is unlikely to reroll lqs to only get story mode lqs and seasoned players know how to handle outleveling areas if they reroll.  As the new story mode will likely be much faster to level in, the practical effect the XP pot has for a veteran player is to speed up the accumulation of omega points / levelling your legendary (and the more hero synergy you have, the less impact each XP boost has anyway). So yes, you could say it's a penalty compared to before, but it's fairly small imo. Would I have liked it left as a reward? Sure, but it's not a big deal to me."

Tech which wouldn't even solve their original problem because a new player might try to choose between ""something that gives me more xp"" and ""this other item i don't understand the importance of yet"" and i'd bet 8/10 would choose the XP boost."

It's not like Gaz or the people working there are new to arpg/mmo, sometimes I just scratch my head wondering how they can overlook such common features, or maybe it's just their way of doing things to make sure they give us little by little to make the game last."
marvelheroes,3d3391,Bubblegum31,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:19:02 2015 UTC,"They're dealing with three things in particular that make it very hard to just turn out UI improvements when they realize something isn't working well   The combo of ARPG/MMO doesn't exactly have a fixed or set formula, there weren't enough players in the space to have a very very very clear idea of what worked and what didn't, so they experimented and fell flat in some areas They have to deal with lengthy approval processes from marvel for well, almost everything they have to create entirely new character classes once a month while also generating new content, new items, and rebalancing the 50 character roster   None of that leaves a lot of time for really hardcore working through UI concerns and rearchitecting the underlying infrastructure unless it's driving some other feature.  I think they'll improve the UI eventually, which may or may not include improving some of the tech underlying other game modes and rewards, but I can't see why choosing between rewards in story should be a necessary or helpful addition to the game beyond this one situation."

It takes an hour or two of terms, challenges, LQs, or almost anything not story related to get ""messed up"" and overlevel the story content.  Hell, if you participate in any of the numerous special events with a low-to-mid level character, you can't not mess up.  I think it makes more sense to say that they want to sell more XP bonuses.  Which is totally cool and understandable.  More money/power to them, since MH gives away an insane amount of content for nothing.  I'd love it if story content simply just leveled with the player, and the harder difficulty settings just included more/more powerful (think Borderlands higher difficulties where badass enemies will have a combination of deadly attributes instead of just one or two) blues and yellows and ramped up bosses."

I'm not going to pretend I know what the recent active player numbers are for MH. All I know is, most of the players I know have either quit the game entirely or have stopped logging on a consistent, daily basis.

With character synergy, cyclops, real event pots, constant server side bonuses, this loss amount to just about nothing.

I think a simple and easy compromise would be to add a hidden achievement for each hero, ""Defeat Sinister in Story Mode at Level 60"", that rewards you with 3 XP pots.  That keeps new players in the more guided progression, but still leaves vets a way to farm pots for Omega farming, etc.  Its encouraging you to play critically under-leveled content, which is not preferable, but I think making it a hidden achievement makes it so its less deliberate."

Plus, if you're critically over level then you're losing out on drops, too.  Lastly, if you're over level then the natural instinct is to rush ahead until you're ""caught up"" with the level range.  That means missing out on content, plus if they're revamping Story Mode to be a OSFA 1-60 experience, it doesn't make much sense they engineer it so you express-lane past a big chunk after Sinister every time."

Its just a smack in the face when they remove small rewards like this for bs reasons when they can easily implement it a different way to make it work.

marvelheroes,3d3391,arcdevil,4,Mon Jul 13 05:02:02 2015 UTC,True. Who knows what the reward will end up as. The Bullseye quest which was originally a Retcon Device got removed with the removal of retcons and replaced with fortune card mark 1 for a few weeks and then they replace the fortune card mark 1 with Matrix of unbindings as the reward instead. Some people might value some of those rewards over others and the same thing could happen here.

marvelheroes,3d6ml3,nimieties,4,Tue Jul 14 15:17:36 2015 UTC,"According to their logic about removing xp boosts, which is to prevent players from overleveling story mode content, it shouldn't affect rif/sif boosts since it has nothing to do with this.  As for revamping story mode in hope of bringing back players to level up their new/prestiged heroes, my bet is that it's going to be a total failure, only new players will possibly enjoy the ride, since they will want to discover the story."
marvelheroes,3d6ml3,Bubblegum31,0,Tue Jul 14 00:32:26 2015 UTC,"As i already pointed out, its a marketing move just to remove the boosters, has nothing to do with over-leveling and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  These boosters are worth 1$ each which means that its a possible net loss per player of 150$ due to the boosters they gave out.  Given that not every player would buy these boosters to start with but atleast 10% of them probably would ,means that they still net back a good 15$ out of each head per average.  If they really wanted to remove boosters out of the play, they would have disabled anykind of exp boost in story mode maps, which would be retarded.  There are other ways of attaining boosters other than the ones they gave out on sinister, so its already a pretty flawed arguement , that excuse of ""preventing players from overleveling story mode""  But this has already been pointed out on the marvel heroes forums aswell, i'm merely quoting from there."
marvelheroes,3d6ml3,unsettlingideologies,3,Tue Jul 14 00:41:40 2015 UTC,You think at least 10% of players would spend $150 on exp boost potions?
marvelheroes,3d6ml3,FullMetalCOS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:39:19 2015 UTC,"The bigger suprise I get from this is that people think +50% exp for 2 hours is actually that big of a deal. Given that most times Omega farming is mentioned the advice is to try and stack between 800% - 1200% total exp boost, suddenly 50% seems pretty insignificant, especially given the ease of obtaining MK1 card with cube shards, which regularly provide both 50% for 2 hours and stacking 100/150/170/190/200 boost bars for an hour (not sure on the 170 and 190 numbers, I usually only use 1-2 at once).  Oh and if you are getting them from cube shards through MK1 cards, you are still getting free boosts, its just less efficient time-wise."

marvelheroes,3d6ml3,unsettlingideologies,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:05:46 2015 UTC,"I suppose I should rephrase that. You really think that at least 10% of players would spend $150 MORE once they remove these free boosts? Because that's the part that seems unlikely to me. Maybe people will spend more on boosts, but I doubt this change will drive almost anyone to spend significantly more money. They'll just spend a little bit less on something else.  Besides, this is all assuming that a significant number of people actually complete Sinister 3x for all heroes. Maybe some folks do, but I doubt it's anywhere near 10%. I doubt 10% even has all the heroes. And those who do that are also interested in getting all the free boosts likely have already done it.  I understand the upset. I really do. I like knowing I can get those boosts for free (even if I don't ever actually get around to getting them). So do most people, I imagine. And maybe you are one of the few people who wants to run it 3x for every hero and hasn't yet for a significant number of the roster. But the claim that it's going to net GAZ an average of $15/player is based on some pretty dubious assumptions."
marvelheroes,3d6ml3,FullMetalCOS,0,Tue Jul 14 13:14:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't doubt that assumption much because most US players spend money on costumes and stuff with a light hand.  Do you think that 10% of those players won't buy boosters if needed for events such as omega or to level up a hero quickly? I don't doubt, i know a ton of people who run 500% boosts just to speed things up and spend much more than 15$ on them weekly."
marvelheroes,3d6ml3,unsettlingideologies,3,Tue Jul 14 14:48:31 2015 UTC,"You keep just pulling numbers/estimates out of nowhere. Every single bit of research I've seen on how F2P games make their money suggests that the vast majority of their income comes from a teeny, tiny minority of their player base. (I've seen numbers ranging from .15% to <10%. The one that said <10% specifically said that most folks in the industry said a company would be lucky to see double digit numbers of players who spend any significant amount of money.)  That being the case, I don't believe for a second that ""most US players spend money on costumes and stuff with a light hand."" The problem is that without doing some sort of rigorous study, your sample is going to be skewed. Yes, most of the people who are active on this sub and the forums might spend money freely, or maybe even most of the people in your SG and social circles. But most of the player base isn't active on here or the forums, isn't in your SG, and isn't in your social circles.  And it stands to reason that the people who do spend lots of money on the game are more likely to 1) have maxed omegas, 2) have many heroes already at max level, and 3) have already grabbed the free pots they were going to grab (either because they grabbed them all ASAP, or because they would rather just spend the money than run that mission over and over). In other words, it seems like the ones who are likely to spend lots of money on boosts,  the least likely to be impacted by the removal of the free pots.  All this is to say that if this is a planned maneuver to make more money on the part of Gaz, it's a silly and likely inconsequential one. They mentioned that it takes something like $100,000 to develop a hero, which gives us some vague idea of the size of their budget. This can't possibly translate into anything more than a drop in the bucket. Could it be just another way to make money? Absolutely. But it seems more likely that either a) it's part of a larger strategy of moving away from giving as many things away for free (like the drug dealer who gets you hooked then jacks up the price) or b) it's really is an attempt to make the story mode leveling process smoother for new folks (although maybe a misguided one).  Either way, focusing on so much energy on complaining about this particular change seems pointless. If you're worried it's part of a bigger shift (tied in with fewer giveaway codes, etc.), then rally people around that and demand answers about Gaz's longterm strategy."

Big companies like that always make moves to screw their costumers and squeeze just a little bit extra out of them.

And not you deciding for them that you should remove them entirely.

Most F2P models don't give character skins/costumes for free, yet Gazillion have the blender, most F2P models dont give boosts for free, yet we have MK1 fortune cards. The ONLY things in game that you have to buy if you want them are higher level fortune cards (and we even got some of those free during the aniversary), stash (and there is talk of stash for splinters) and the more effective boosts, which lets face it, you don't NEED, they are just a convenience.

It is in no way a huge upset to me. If I should feel like I need XP boosts I'll run green/red terminals and I'm bound to get a few XP boosts every week. Omega farming is not a huge part of my experience, nor is it for most people if I should make a guess. XP boosts will at best cut your omega farming by a third, assuming you only play one single hero or have hero synergy off. Granted, that is significant, but most people won't play a single hero exclusively, so they'll have varying degrees of hero synergy. Worst case, ie full synergy, other boosts, etc, it'll cut your time by maybe 1%, which is, what, an hour from 0 to max omegas. Odin Marks I'll grant you, having all those points ready when you're level 60 is nice and would otherwise take some time to get."
marvelheroes,3d6ml3,SupaTrooper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:03:53 2015 UTC,Its a good 20% actually.  50% from 275% with synergies is 19% boost lost and it doesn't only apply to omega farming but to everything.  Even leveling that same hero from 1 to 60 with that 50% extra XP boost is going to make a considerable speedup but they choose to take it away and instead force you to do shitty story at an even slower pace than LQ's probably.
marvelheroes,3d6ml3,SupaTrooper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:36:02 2015 UTC,"Like I said, worst case is all kinds of boosts, max INT, other +XP sources etc so you're looking at 1000+% XP (unless there's a cap I'm not aware of).

I'm also curious what percentage of people upset about the xp pot change were actually running through story to get those xp pots and whether or not these people are also running cube shards daily for mk 1 fortune cards. They offer a very easy and quick way to earn a reasonable chance at free boosts and there's no limit besides a timer, it's not like they've wiped out every free boost and even if they did it's not like you deserve it or anything; it's merely a nice bonus."

marvelheroes,3d4daa,unsettlingideologies,2,Mon Jul 13 17:01:06 2015 UTC,"When I was new, the best advice save all legandaries, only donate stuff to the crafter forget about leveling the others, at level 16 or 18 you get a recipe to turn in 3,4,5 uniques for credits. that helps get you started to reroll on your next few toons.  Play the story and watch the animations your first time through no need to rush and it is actually pretty good. but you really only need to do it 1 time.  figure out what you enjoy by trying a melee, ranged, summoner and concentrate your first toons on those.  I suggest leveling cyclopes as your first ranged, ms marvel as a first melee and racoon as a summoner. those are pretty basic and let you form what style you enjoy (unless of course you have a favorite you really want to play then play them!)  Don't worry about saving artifacts or what is best early on, if you can use it and it looks ok put it on, otherwise donate it. the only thing you need to save is 10 of each highest level crafting mat, boosts and legendaries to save up and craft into credits. (and relics probably)  Early on if you decide to spend real $$ on G, the best thing you can do is buy a stash tab!!!  take advantage of the events as they go on, level somebody if related to a bonus exp.  Personally I would not use splinters for randm hero's I would rather buy whom I want, but dont spend them early on for anything but hero's  after your crafter is level 20 get a pet. set vacuum to suck up stuff unless you are gearing up a new toon, get a pet leveled pretty early on. those bonus on each toon are nice you can swap them without unbinding them. (they dont bind)  don't stress over what is the ""best"" build, the build online are usually for max level characters and the gear are usually pretty generic as the best gear is the best gear no matter what character, just as leveling since you can free respec try everything if you don't like it change it up.  Min/Maxing a toon comes much later.   I like doing legendary quests early to level cuz that first legendary item is huge. you can pass it on to all your toons."

marvelheroes,3d4daa,MK43,0,Mon Jul 13 14:18:31 2015 UTC,"That is not advice I would give to a brand new player. Getting to level 60 should not be the main focus of your first character, it's just something that happens along the way."

marvelheroes,3d4daa,MK43,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not sure. It's hard to know if I would even understand if someone had told me some of the tricks when I first started.  With this game, you have to get your feet wet by just playing so you have a base to build from.  There are SO many places to actually go and kill stuff in this game that it can easily be confusing.  Story mode, terminals, which are different, yet the same as the story, Midtown and ICP, Holo-Sim and X-Defense, One Shots, Raids.  I wish I would've understood when I first started but I know now, I would not have been able to grasp it all on the first play-through.  But, if I can give ONE piece of advice, I would tell people to use Cyclops as their starter and buy Cap on the second day.  Cyclops to aid in all of the other leveling and Cap because he's a 400 hero that is fairly easy and still can hit like a truck."
marvelheroes,3d4daa,smittyphi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:35:36 2015 UTC,"As for your second question, yes there is a HUGELY varying degree of difficulty. Some of the stuff you won't get to for a very long time. And that's okay."

marvelheroes,3d4daa,TexasAndroid,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:22:41 2015 UTC,What exactly is prestiging? I know I need to prestige to lvl 1 so I can buy the Iron Buddies pet but I'm not sure how to do that.
marvelheroes,3d4daa,Sleepy_StormTrooper,2,Mon Jul 13 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"Buy a Gourd of Prestige from Clea (the cube shards vendor).   It resets your character back to level 1 so you can re-level said character.   All your gear goes into inventory/stash since you're too low level to equip them. Since your legendary can be equipped at level 1, you'll still have that in.  You'll get a free default costume, which is why some people prestige. Exchange 3 costumes with the Crafter for a random one.  You'll also get a name colour change, which goes like this: Normal white - green - purple - blue - orange - red - cosmic (yellow)  The cosmic/yellow name requires 25x the normal XP to level and that's when you really learn what grinding in this game really means. Highly recommended for masochists."
marvelheroes,3d4daa,hungryjar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:42:48 2015 UTC,Thanks! The cosmic prestige sounds absolutely brutal.   Do you have to hit 60 on a character before you can reset and prestige?

Max money is 3 mil, you will hit this semi early, dont wory about spending cash, you will get back quick.  Crafting materials, wish I didn't bother with them at first since they can take up a lot of space, later you can get ""Pures"" often which can be downgraded into other materials later.  TTK = Time to kill, there is no damage meter to really gauge your characters performance there so thats what is used, not something to worry about too much early on but was confusing to me for a while.    Mole Man's medallion gives XP% boost and intelligence which is more xp% boost.  He spawns often in midtown.  Get a team up ASAP, makes life a lot easier, my favorite generalist is Magik but any are all fine you can math out what is best for you later, just get one.  non-combat pets, they give you stats!, you level them by essentially donating items to them but vaccuming items up or i think alt+ right clicking them in your bag.

marvelheroes,3d2e67,ShadowGearX,-8,Thu Jul 16 21:19:02 2015 UTC,"Wrong, and No."
marvelheroes,3d2e67,ShadowGearX,4,Mon Jul 13 00:18:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for your thoughtful and engaging feedback.
marvelheroes,3d2e67,Wafzig,2,Mon Jul 13 00:47:54 2015 UTC,"Ok.  Sure.  I'll be happy to elaborate on that.  So it would change the supply for any given player but not always have an effect on demand.  For example GoK is pretty much a BiS artifact for everybody, as is HoD.   So if people get a max roll on one then thats fantastic.  Now for like one out of every 10,000 that drops, it'll be within 1% of max rolls theoretically, so if everybody could get a max roll one then it would probably have a negative effect on the associated value of a max rolled artifact.  Which is to say, you might be able to get a high rolled lizard for 1-2 GoK cheaper than you would now.  NOW, if this is a heavy effect or not is a matter of perspective.  If somebody is just trying to deck out the single character they enjoy playing, then that would remove them from the potential buyers pool if they got the max roll one.  But if they're just playing one character anyway, they probably wouldn't be looking for a max rolled one for quite some time as they probably wouldn't have enough wealth to afford a bid on a GoK for quite some time.    The people that WOULD be buying them are probably still going to be buying them, and some portion of THAT market are RMT players anyway.  RMT exists in this game, its a thing.  Now I'm VERY comfortable doing something solely to negatively effect the RMT market, and as an added bonus players get to reach SOME of their tail goals sooner than they otherwise would.    If anything I'd say add another tier or in some cases tiers of takedown achievements so that players CAN have those long tail goals fulfilled without having to spam trade for months on end.  Also, most of the trade market VOLUME is made up by insignias and costume cores.  Which is to say that a good insignia and a good costume core would retain their value in that change, and probably even be worth a bit more comparatively.   Again, a win/win in my book.  Doesn't effect the majority of the market, takes an easy shot against the RMT market, and people get loot.    If you agree or disagree with that, thats your prerogative but at least I've given you the thoughtful and engaging feedback you were looking for."

marvelheroes,3d2e67,dragonsroc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:16:47 2015 UTC,The Robot Dispenser is NOT from a Takedown. That is the main difference.
marvelheroes,3d2e67,mrmojoz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:47:13 2015 UTC,"Also, the Dispenser isn't exactly top-tier like most of the BSAs.  Even a max-roll isn't going to be BIS once you get better options.  And its a lot more common, in any case.  If the Dispenser was random-rolled, it would be competing for the worst achievement reward.  Only the fact that its guaranteed max makes it even worthwhile, since you can at least slot it on benchwarmer heroes or ones you're just running up to 60 for the synergy."

marvelheroes,3d2xkr,avatarofshadow,3,Mon Jul 13 03:11:44 2015 UTC,"50% off Costumes is actually semi-newer. Prior it was only BOGO. The first one to my knowledge was Halloween last year. Unless there's a large event it seems to only come around for special occasions. I would say late October for Hallow's Eve may be the next time we see it. Also, they'll bring back a few costumes you currently can't get for it too!"
marvelheroes,3d2xkr,UnlikeClockwork,3,Mon Jul 13 04:04:39 2015 UTC,"If I recall, the last big costume sale (40% off) sale came around the first week of the 2nd anniversary, to match up with a previous week sale of 40% off all xmen stuff. If you go through the news articles on the home page, you will see how infrequent the 50% off sales are.   Marvel Knights characters were 50% off when the DD Netflix show debuted.   Before that, the last 50% off costume sale was Christmas starting on Dec 17th, 2014.    So if you are patient, there are two or three big 50% off costume sales each year. Last Black Friday, I think Gaz went as far as 25% off costumes + BOGO. Happy shopping!"

marvelheroes,3d66m4,ohoni,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"It's generally worth rerolling any legendaries that are not in Midtown, Especially on Mondays. Just do a midtown Legendary, and then start rerolling until you get another. Even on other days of the week I typically reroll any Legendary that isn't in Midtown or Industry City.   As for the fortune cards, yeah, you can do that, but I think all you can get out of the cube shard cards is a few costumes and minipets, not full characters."

Good luck on your random pulls. I've had reasonably good luck with them myself, sometimes getting characters I really wanted, and only rarely getting dupes or ones I really didn't want. I had some really bad luck with them early on though, getting a bunch of unwanted dupes out of the 3-4 I used. RNG, man."

marvelheroes,3d66m4,ohoni,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:55:50 2015 UTC,"The fortune cards that drop from Midtown Madness are equippable items.  The fortune cards you buy with Cube Shards give you boosts, costumes, pets, and decorative artifacts (i.e. artifacts that have no stats, just cosmetic).  They are not the same.  Also, the boosts that you receive from the Cube Shard cards shouldn't really affect the drop rate of Eternity Splinters.  In Cosmic Midtown Madness, there is a chance for a cosmic version of the fortune card that typically drops during this Monday event.  That has the potential to contain Odin Marks, a random costume, etc.  However, the most common items you'll get are equippable."

And on top of it all, you /will/ eventually have to sort it out and then you miss a wave of enemies (and of course, if you had joined in that wave, the unique item you are looking for would've of dropped, but oh well) and is great for leveling characters.

marvelheroes,3d66m4,sappycap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"Well the minigun is single target though, so if there's a crowd, spraying them with BFG is more efficient. For large packs of weak enemies I typically plasma launcher, then sweep the crowd with the BFG, then take down the stragglers with the minigun. Also don't forget that the charge-up attack buffs your gun damage, so while it might be a waste of time to fully charge the thing, just tap-firing it whenever it's off cooldown should help buff your other attacks.   I mostly just use the minigun against boss type enemies and other hardened targets. Also, since BFG is a DoT power itself, you can tap it every coupe seconds to add a little extra damage and then go back to mini-gunning."
marvelheroes,3d66m4,BelGareth,0,Mon Jul 13 23:14:22 2015 UTC,"It's popular due to the boxes that are dropped by bosses, which are better than odins bounty and ICP boxes, so it's very popular game mode on Monday evenings."

marvelheroes,3d59d7,Batman0483,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:42:18 2015 UTC,That's really harsh considering they're not even done shooting this movie yet. It's experimental footage and it's important to realize that this isn't the final cut. All video games and movies have trailers or footage leaked that can often look really terrible as opposed to the finished product. Also only a leaked teaser in bad quality. Hate to bring up DC in this thread but the teaser for Batman v Superman? Not interesting to me at all. Trailer from the other day? Pretty great. :)

marvelheroes,3d09g4,droid327,2,Tue Jul 14 08:56:12 2015 UTC,"or a variant on their default costume would be nice.  just a simple color swap of their defaults.  I don't know how hard that would be, but it would give people a REASON to do the achieves.  Cyclops, Rocket, and Deadpool have achieves with uniques as rewards, but most of them only offer Omega orbs.   The kind of player who would do all the achieves on characters is the kind of player who probably has max omegas right now.  So, their reward is just a stack of orb chests that will sit in their bank for a long time, and then give us one more point in something when you raise the cap.  Not very exciting."
marvelheroes,3d09g4,soulteddy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:48:10 2015 UTC,I can see the color swap working if the resulting costume is still canon. I'm pretty sure Marvel wouldn't allow color swapped versions of their costumes to come out without their approval.

Other than his camouflage and venom punch his powers are identical to peter's, and those two differences can be done via animations.  Miles doesn't behave differently than Peter like Laura did from Logan (X-23 and Wolverine are different enough to warrant a separate kit)."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,theswerto,11,Sun Jul 12 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly, a lot of people are like ""well he has really different powers!"" No, not really. He fights in exactly the same way and he still has webs and all that.   Tons of enhanced heroes have animation swaps on certain powers. Fear Itself Thing uses his hammer on some attacks. Kate Bishop rocks the battle staves for melee Hawkeye moves.   You could easily just have Enhanced Miles have a unique Spider Brawl animation where he uses venom punches, or shoots venom blasts as a replacement for some of the web blast powers Spidey has. You could even do the camoflauge by having him disappear and reappear at different points in the animation.   I get they're trying to push Miles as his own thing but I'd really hate to see him take up an advanced pack slot, even though I like the character and think he deserves to be in the game."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,jmarFTL,2,Sun Jul 12 20:09:44 2015 UTC,I wish Gambit as Death had different animations. QQ
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,C_L_I_C_K,-3,Sun Jul 12 21:45:39 2015 UTC,If you want to be technical about it. Miles doesn't have webbing. The web shooters were a gift (taken back by Peter) and Miles doesn't know how to make the web fluid. I'd say that warrants a totally different power set.
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,Emizzon,6,Sun Jul 12 21:05:58 2015 UTC,"He does use webbing in the comics, all the fucking time. Just because he doesn't know how to make more doesn't mean he lacks the ability to use it. In fact, shield was giving him replacements prior to his arrival on 616."

marvelheroes,3d0r2m,Emizzon,5,Sun Jul 12 21:31:30 2015 UTC,"Foot claws are not what separate X-23, it's the way she's been presented in comics.   X-23 has always been a quicker, smaller, more stealthy wolverine. She was in this way in the comics, she was this way in the cartoon, she was this way in Marvel vs Capcom 3 (MVC3 even gave her a stealth).   Miles is not that different from Peter.   He swings on webs just like peter, he mocks his opponents just like peter. His venom punch is nothing but a punch that has an extra oomph to it in the form of lightning (which is just fine as an animation, you can't just give him the identical kit and give him better punches because 'his power set says so'). His camouflage is also nothing that unique considering it isn't a full invisibility like other heroes have, which means it could be handled just fine as an animation on agile attack, etc.   Black Suit spidey and superior spiderman had a more unique powerset from normal peter than Miles, and those were just fine as an enhanced."

Don't get me wrong, I'm quite happy Laura is a playable character, I had my fist full of cash to give Gaz for when she went on sale. I just feel the same consideration should be given for Miles as well."

marvelheroes,3d0r2m,Dirk_8,9,Sun Jul 12 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"Spider-woman (original jessica drew, not the ultimate one), Agent Venom, and Spider-man 2099 are really the one spider-heroes left that have a big difference in skills and weapons compared to the original spider-heroes.  Miles is just peter parker, but with camo (which peter parker has made a camo suit, but gave it up), and a venom blast (which is just a lackluster version of spider-woman).  Miles at most should just be an enhanced costume with slighty different visuals.  I'm just disappointed that they are trying to force the new ms.marvel and miles onto the game because Marvel is pushing for them to have bigger roles.  They are just bland versions of their counterparts (mr.fantastic and peter parker).  I've said it before and I'll say it again, if miles morales get to be a full hero before agent venom in this game, I'll be pissed off.  Also, I wish Marvel would stick to adding diversity to marvel universe by making new heroes with new powers instead of just rebranding our favorites as a female or different colored skin version."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,dominicgetdown,4,Sun Jul 12 20:54:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest I would like to see Miles as his own character rather than an enhanced costume.  He could get a new moveset too, just like X-23.    I remember when Juggernaut came out everyone was saying he was just going to be a Colossus/Thing clone.  And look what happened there.  I believe that could happen for Miles too."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,TondaGossa,2,Sun Jul 12 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right, your juggernaut analogy makes an excellent point."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,ashtonknapp,19,Sun Jul 12 23:01:02 2015 UTC,"Really, the only Spider-Hero that NEEDS to be playable is Spider-Woman. Almost all of the other Spider-People are just derivatives of Spider-Man and would play very closely to him therefore they could just be enhanced costumes. I'd like to see a Silk enhanced costume after the Spider-Gwen costume.   Edit: Everyone on the poll would've had significantly more votes if Magik hadn't been included. It was annoying that they even did that. They knew she was the one that a lot of people want. I am going to be so angry if Ms. Marvel and Wasp aren't in AP3 though. They're the most original out of the entire poll."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,UnlikeClockwork,15,Sun Jul 12 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"Green Goblin isn't original?  Well, I never!"
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,ashtonknapp,0,Sun Jul 12 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that his gameplay wouldn't be that original. Shooting bombs and stuff. Ms. Marvel would be stretching and growing simultaneously, which hasn't been done in game. Wasp would be shrunken down (which is obviously the same as Ant-Man but he's not out yet so). Nick Fury is in the same realm as Black Widow, Punisher and Winter Soldier. I don't know what they could do that would actually be new/innovative/interesting."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,UnlikeClockwork,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:14:52 2015 UTC,"I can give you that on the account of a few things. He'd definitely be a layering hero. Bombs, boomerangs and gliding are already in the game. However, I feel like his playstyle would be wildly popular due to being part Silver Surfer and part Hawkeye.  Also, from what I gather Nick Fury would be largely summoner here. Other than our current three-tree'd releases, the only true summoner we have still is Squirrel Girl. He could be interesting.  And did we forget about the stretching and growing of Mr. Fantastic? He could do so much more than his current animations too. I'd be interested in Ms. M if they decided to revamp him a bit too."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,ashtonknapp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:44:14 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they already shot down Nick Fury being a summoner didn't they?  And yes Mr. Fantastic probably needs a QoL because literally no one plays him. But also he doesn't GROW like she does. Like Ms. Marvel could be as big as a Frost Giant and make her leg stretch out and just swing it around or something. Honestly her potential is limitless and she would be AMAZING in game.
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,cronotose,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""bombs and stuff"" is a fair characterization. He has an extremely wide array not just of weapons, but types of weapons. He has the bombs (many different types), gasses(many different types), razor bats, glove blasts, the glider, goblin subordinates, etc. If they wanted they could give him the battle van he designed (but the hobgoblin actually used, making it work for an enhanced costume), Iron Patriot weapons, or use insanity mechanics in gameplay (not unlike the goblin formula omega node).  This isn't to downplay Kamala's quality. She's a fine choice to be in the game. But it isn't like she has this totally new and unique set of abilities that would change the way you play. She would stretch (like Mr. Fantastic) and she could grow while doing it (which other than a visual effect, wouldn't actually change the way you play)."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,ashtonknapp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"No but I'm just saying that we've seen ranged weapon heroes already in game. Like everyone was hyped for Doom, which is cool, but it's not like his powers were anything new. Do you understand what I mean?"
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,cronotose,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:09:39 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely get what you're saying. Frankly, there are only so many ways you can do variations on ""click the bad guy to hurt it"". I think GG and Kamala were the best picks imho. I was always going to pick GG based on personal character bias though. I imagine Kamala would do a lot better in the poll if more people had gotten around to reading her book. Its just still so new. Shoot, I've heard nothing but amazing things about it, have them all, and haven't gotten around to it myself."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,ashtonknapp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:16:09 2015 UTC,"And most of the people that voted for Magik commented and said that if they didn't vote for Magik they would've voted for Kamala or Wasp. To me, they should've just went ahead and used Magik. It's annoying to get our hopes up and then ruin them."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,Galyndean,8,Tue Jul 14 00:15:58 2015 UTC,"Well, if a lot of people want Magik, shouldn't that be the character that they release before characters that fewer people want?  I mean, I didn't really care for any of the choices myself (and voted for Wasp), but I don't think it's all that strange to include a character that they know people want to see how they gauge against other characters that have been requested."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,ashtonknapp,2,Sun Jul 12 16:33:10 2015 UTC,But they already knew how many people wanted Magik based on other polls. Should've just been the guaranteed hero and not gotten our hopes up.
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,RareshRus,6,Mon Jul 13 03:15:46 2015 UTC,"About the ""Almost all of the other Spider-People are just derivatives of Spider-Man and would play very closely to him therefore they could just be enhanced costumes"", Miles and Miguel (2099) have indeed some common powers with Peter to some degree, there are still notable differences: Miles has Venom Blast, Spider-Camouflage, and most recently, Energy Burst (and Immortality, but I don't know if it will stick); Miguel, on the other side, has Accelerated Vision, being kind of like Bullet-Time Matrix style (demonstrated in Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions), Talons and Fangs with paralyzing venom and Accelerated Decoy. Making them Enhanced Costumes instead of separate heroes would obviously prevent these powers from being used in-game. With there two, it's not exactly like with Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker), since she has only one additional power when compared to her father (""magnetizing"" and repelling objects in contact with her, directly or otherwise) and different scales (she is faster, but slightly less strong than Peter).  I'm not saying that Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew) shouldn't have priority, on the contrary, her power-set is very different from the other Spiders mentioned and would benefit the game's variety. Also, sorry for the wall of text."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,theswerto,6,Sun Jul 12 16:42:22 2015 UTC,"Mile's differences can be shown via animations. Camouflage can be a separate animation for agile attack, venom bite for spider-brawl, energy blast for one of his web shots."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,ashtonknapp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:44:52 2015 UTC,No I believe that they should be their own characters too. I'm just saying that Spider-Woman is the only Spider character who is completely different from the others.

She really has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the Spider-franchise and has always been her own thing. Her recent inclusion in Spider-Verse and the like haven't made a whole lot of sense.  Miles, Miguel, Ben, and Kaine all have their own value as characters, and I would be happy to see them in game. It just doesn't make sense to prioritize any of them over more prominent characters, who's franchises aren't yet properly represented in the game."

There are people who voted for Magik simply because she's an X-Men character. Also... there are like 15 playable X-Men currently and another one is coming soon. It's not like they're being ignored.   Also...Beast (I do want him in game though) would just be like melee and gadgets and what would Bishop even do? Some ranged energy powers and maybe some guns and stuff?

marvelheroes,3d0r2m,GorgonGirl,2,Mon Jul 13 03:13:06 2015 UTC,I think the independant hero vs. enhanced costume should come down to how different their power sets are. Like Jane Foster as Thor uses Mjolnir in some different ways than Odinson did. But I don't really know if it's enough to justify her being a unique hero vs an enhanced costume.
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,Valexexe,2,Sun Jul 12 20:36:37 2015 UTC,The only basis that Miles has to be a unique hero is that Marvel is pushing him so hard.
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,soulteddy,2,Sun Jul 12 22:36:21 2015 UTC,Agree! Spider 2099 make more senses than Miles but I guess Gaz's  decide about Miles because of his Venom Blast Power.

marvelheroes,3d0r2m,mirrorell,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:36:19 2015 UTC,"@topic of nominees:  Goblin was called for for the Villain Pack last year; his inclusion in the list was the most fair one. The only reason Goblin lost was because(see Magik below):  Magik shouldn't even have been in that list since they've teased her for so long that everyone expected her to be the ""surprise hero of 2015.""  Fury could have been the ""surprise hero of 2015"" and should not have been a nominee, in place of Magik.  Miles and Kamala were promotional heroes from Marvel's decision; ie. they were placed there to promote their own series. ie. Miles will be the new Spider-Man for 616(or something like that) and his promotion will be a seller for Marvel.  Wasp was fair to be in that list; we just all knew she wasn't going to win it even if the list was changed.  Spider-Man 2099 is going to be an ENHANCED -- there was already a poll about it and it's the next ENHANCED costume to be released after Symbiote Rocket.  The real shocker was the non-inclusion of long wanted heroes such as Beast and Jubilee, both of whom could have given Magik a run for her money."
marvelheroes,3d0r2m,Elzam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:38:04 2015 UTC,"I think Miles makes for a better standalone hero since he has powers that Peter Parker doesn't. The only unique features that 2099 has is his poison bite, which he doesn't really even use while he's in the suit."

They're both more like each other with stealth capabilities and their stings than either of them are like Spider-man's powerset.

marvelheroes,3d0r2m,Valexexe,5,Sun Jul 12 19:36:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think the method of voting is what caused the commotion but rather the notion that Magik be voted on at all. A lot of people on the official forums and here on the subreddit have been calling for her inclusion for a very long time. Had she been listed as a potential candidate for release against any other heroes she was sure to win.  What I think most people are upset about is that Magik wasn't just given her inclusion in the pack by default, instead we had this vote that was always going to result in Magik being the nominee rather than voting for other characters that haven't been as rabidly supported by the community."

So i think a high end i5 processor (4690k) would be great for gaming, also the boards for those CPUs (LGA1150) should be coming down in price as soon as the new Intel CPUs come out into the market.   *Edit : For GPUs keep an eye out for the GeForce 980, they have been coming down in price, and also keep an eye out for prices on the R9 290x, and if you are an enthusiast the R9 295x2. *Edit2 : https://pcpartpicker.com/parts/partlist/ example build, but you can opt for a lower card if you would like.  Such as an R9 280 ($150) or a GTX 960 ($170)"
marvelheroes,3d2eth,CptJamesTAsscrack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:14:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed description on the cards! I would love to play Marvel Heroes on max settings and I think my budget for a card is around $300-$350.
marvelheroes,3d2eth,AnimeJ,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"My friend has a 760 and can still run this game at maximum settings but if your budget is truly $350 for just the card, I'd say shoot for a 970. That would make it so you can run any game you'd very well please on at least High, for the foreseeable future.   Though, personally, I would wait until this upcoming Wednesday if you're an Amazon Prime member. They're going to have tons of sales for Prime Day and you'll likely get some of your components for quite the discount."
marvelheroes,3d2eth,satyanjoy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:36:51 2015 UTC,I am a prime member and I can't wait. I hope I'm not setting myself up for disappointment.  Is the 760 more powerful than the 970? I can alays bump up the budget if it means I get at least 3 years out of it.

marvelheroes,3d2ymw,smittyphi,5,Mon Jul 13 12:51:57 2015 UTC,You get an upgrade token for said hero.
marvelheroes,3d2ymw,vadersdemise,2,Mon Jul 13 02:45:57 2015 UTC,which is useful for?
marvelheroes,3d2ymw,bigbadVuk,2,Mon Jul 13 02:48:35 2015 UTC,Upgrading that hero's Ultimate power by 1 (goes up to 20 and can only be leveled with ultimate upgrade tokens (200 ES) or by having the dupe hero token).
marvelheroes,3d2ymw,_ReclaimeR_,3,Mon Jul 13 02:52:18 2015 UTC,okay useful answers guys i appriciate thanks
marvelheroes,3d2ymw,avatarofshadow,-4,Mon Jul 13 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"No problem, everyone's here to be your personal Google since apparently you're inept."
marvelheroes,3d2ymw,ProfJackAss,2,Tue Jul 14 07:12:54 2015 UTC,"one downside to the ultimate token is that it has to sit in your stash until level 52.  Unless you're on Cable or Deadpool, who still get their Ultimates at 30 until their ""52 Reviews.""    at some point, your crafter will gain the ability to exchange those tokens for a random unique item that will be level 60, but most players feel that's a big waste.    It would be nice if they let you exchange the hero tokens for the misc. Ultimate tokens, so you could focus on upgrading specific heroes.    maybe at some point they'll add this."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,zman2596,8,Sun Jul 12 18:35:47 2015 UTC,Buy Scarlet Witch and Storm. both 200 splinter heroes and pretty good to boot.
marvelheroes,3d1ced,darin617,3,Sun Jul 12 19:08:19 2015 UTC,I was interested in black widow and hawkeye initially for 200 ES cost.  Hawkeye any good?
marvelheroes,3d1ced,ElNutimo,2,Sun Jul 12 23:45:47 2015 UTC,He is fun to play.  A bit squishy but his range taunt takes care of that.  Levelling Hawkeye to 60 was way more fun for me compared to levelling Cyclops to 60.
marvelheroes,3d1ced,Galyndean,5,Mon Jul 13 00:18:16 2015 UTC,"Getting Hawkeye to 60 was the greatest day, because it meant never playing him again.  Ironically, I mained Cyke until Mags release."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,ElNutimo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"How do you do it.  I got irritated at playing dodgeball with him the whole time.  Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge 24/7."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,Galyndean,3,Mon Jul 13 17:23:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not interested in raiding and thus don't always have the most min/maxed dps build, so maybe that's a difference?  Most mobs get cleared with ricochet blast pretty easy, maybe a dodge or two here and there, more with cosmic bosses, obv.  Never much had issues with dying a whole lot.  I do believe I have health on hit affix though and maybe it's on my core too.  It's been a little while since I looked.  I also didn't see a play style change after his review.  Same old Cyke, but less passives to put points in.  Conversely, with Hawkeye, I died constantly, could never keep enemies off of me even with the taunt arrow.  I ended up just power lvling him from 50-60 during an omega event or something with extra xp boosts just so I could shelve him permanently."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,Tallyrph,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:42:56 2015 UTC,"Spot on, man.  Both are great heroes, and SW right now is top tier"
marvelheroes,3d1ced,MK43,3,Mon Jul 13 13:26:46 2015 UTC,"If I were you I would buy my favorite hero and begin to get max gear for them. If you don't have a favorite, buy a random hero box because theres a really high chance to get a hero you don't have(you CAN get a dupe though).   On the Omega event begin to save up omega files for Agent Coulson who's a very solid teamup(for free!).   If you are satisfied with you're heroes and want to peruse endgame buy your favorite team up and get them to 60."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,ProfJackAss,3,Sun Jul 12 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a teamup I would suggest saving 2k omega files during omega events for Coulson, he really is very good.  If you don't want to go that route I highly suggest getting Clea with ES as she is probably the best all around teamup regardless of hero.  Do not waste splinters on Groot, he sucks, and anyone who disagrees is trolling you into wasting your ES.  If you go the route of saving omega files and want to get heroes with your ES I believe scarlet witch is 200ES and she is top tier right now.  Extremely durable and brutally bad ass.    You can also go with random hero boxes, but remember, random is random.  You can end up with a duplicate regardless of how many heroes you already have.  Honestly, I would rather buy a hero I know I want than go random and get a duplicate or a hero I have no interest in."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,Quexana,2,Sun Jul 12 20:25:29 2015 UTC,"I think Groot is amazing while you're leveling a character.  I agree completely with your assessment of him in end game.  In short, he's the perfect team-up for beginners."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,ProfJackAss,3,Sun Jul 12 22:35:39 2015 UTC,"In short, he's the perfect team-up for beginners.   I am going to disagree solely because he costs 200es.  If he was free I would be right there with you.  As far as being useful while leveling, I won't disagree with that, but then again any teamup will be useful while leveling.    Personally though, I would always go back to Clea as a first teamup option.  She might not heal you but the DPS buff AoE and the spammed 25% dmg reduction shield is too good while leveling.  Her damage output is also pretty nuts, as is her survivability.  Thank you for being able to intelligently state your case though.  :)"
marvelheroes,3d1ced,Novars,-5,Sun Jul 12 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"Jackass is actually the troll. Groot is not really that bad. He can tank for you, he can heal you. Its everything you need as a beginner. I can do cosmic terminal early because of him. But if youre planning to get any other team up anytime soon, better not buy him with your splinter gifts because there are other team ups thats better. And dont buy pets like i did. Worst invesment ever. All in all, groot is great. Get him!"
marvelheroes,3d1ced,ProfJackAss,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:50:29 2015 UTC,I don't see him as my team up for long term but for the cost now I thought he would be good for a beginner.
marvelheroes,3d1ced,ProfJackAss,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:47:57 2015 UTC,"Jackass is actually the troll.    Oh look, it is Novars here to talk more shit and troll.   Groot is not really that bad. He can tank for you, he can heal you.   Groot sucks, he has no taunt, and OMG a little hp/sec is sooo strong compared to other options.  No.  Groot is hands down the worse teamup option in the game.  The only reason you see him used is because they gave away a free Groot at xmas (because he sucks) and because he is only 200ES (because he sucks).  @OP: All novars does is badmouth Gaz and this game.  Don't take anything out of his mouth seriously."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,Quexana,0,Sun Jul 12 21:58:35 2015 UTC,So saying a product from Gaz sucks = being a fanboy now huh?  You can't even get your insults straight.
marvelheroes,3d1ced,h0tmess,3,Sun Jul 12 23:11:57 2015 UTC,"With how good and fun she is to play and relatively cheap to gear, I'd recommend using 200ES on Scarlet Witch.  Then save the rest for the Clea Team-Up.  Cap,SW, and the Clea Team-Up should serve you well for a good long while."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,168523,3,Mon Jul 13 00:35:28 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it's smart to look into characters you generally have an interest in and find out how they play. You can also try them out on the Test Center as well!  Saving the splinters to get exactly who you want is just more pleasing to me than maybe getting someone you really want for a cheaper price.   My starter was Storm. I unlocked Jean with my 400 splinters. My BF gifted me Emma. I was so excited to get my first random hero box..aaand it's Jean. My next hero box was Emma. So I'm a little biased against that damn random box.  Just remember something: It might be nice to get a character like Rogue for 175 splinters (vs 600), but if you get her with splinters it's going to be free anyway, so might as well try and get who you want :)"
marvelheroes,3d1ced,GrnArmadillo,4,Sun Jul 12 22:31:11 2015 UTC,"Buy one random box and open it— worst possible case, you'll get another Cap. Second worst would be a character you absolutely hate, if there is any in the roster— so pick the box first, open it, and decide it from there.  If you want to play it safe, and you like the characters, you can go with a 200 splinter hero (like Widow, or Thing for example), and play a while with those. You don't have to use the splinters all at once, so get one (either from a box or straight up) and go from there.  Team-ups are nice, but aren't really a requirement. I'd say that starting out you might be better off getting a new hero to play around with, rather than a team-up that just sits there and does some damage for you."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,yomjoseki,7,Mon Jul 13 03:20:47 2015 UTC,"If the original poster is prepared to live with Groot and his single line of dialog, I disagree with this statement.  The difference between zero team-ups and one team-up is a major difference post team-up 2.0, and that one team-up can be used on every hero you unlock in the future.  If you're willing to spend money then it's probably worth splurging on a team-up you actually want, but if it's primarily ES I'd argue strongly for a team-up relatively early in the process."
marvelheroes,3d1ced,WhatImMike,2,Sun Jul 12 18:56:02 2015 UTC,SW and Thing would be a great way to spend 400 ES.
marvelheroes,3d1ced,TheWiseMountain,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:11:14 2015 UTC,I would honestly get what will make your experience in MH more fun. Just remember the more heroes you have at 60 makes leveling the rest a lot easier. Cyclops has a 10% xp synergy as well.   Just stuff to mull over.
marvelheroes,3d1ced,talient,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:39:38 2015 UTC,"Ant-Man is coming out for 400, SW is 200 though"
marvelheroes,3d1ced,LawfuI,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"There are two ways to do this.   Go the 3-hero approach with your initial unlock + 2x 200-pt heroes. Others have posted suggestions on the 200-pointers. Max your experience with a good team-up. This route may be good if your free unlock isn't very tanky. Again, there are suggestions for tanky team-ups elsewhere. (I went this route with Magick.)   Don't sweat it; pick one or the other. Worst case you hate the decision and everything you picked. Start over with another account if that happens. (Not sure if multiple accounts are frowned upon but I've not read anything that suggests it to be so.)  Splinters are not super hard to accumulate. If you like the game a lot, you'll get another 175 soon enough to get a random."
marvelheroes,3czudm,AnnieIsMyGirl,2,Sun Jul 12 07:39:46 2015 UTC,"This is great, I love it"
marvelheroes,3czudm,BelGareth,2,Sun Jul 12 16:52:45 2015 UTC,I use havok as away-energy.  Works fantastic with my Gambit and Phoenix.
marvelheroes,3czudm,Naurhir,2,Sun Jul 12 17:24:23 2015 UTC,"I use the login-reward Wolverine as my main for Melee/Phys heroes.  Away passive is Brut/BrutDmg.  With proc'd Regen/Move/Crit, no damage.  But he's way better in Companion mode, with multiple AoE/Bleed and +50% damage against bleeding.  So there's the last line you're missing."
marvelheroes,3czudm,LineNoise54,3,Sun Jul 12 19:17:37 2015 UTC,"Groot is 0.5% health per second, not 0.5 health per second.  And IM Mk II also has a shield as an away buff, you listed for Clea but not for him.  And its worth mentioning that everyone with a ""none"" in the last column generally just does 2 damage procs on a 30s CD while away, they're more or less all the same.  Otherwise its good to have it all listed in one place, thanks.  My experience so far with TUs is that they still don't do a whole lot of DPS, even max level fully geared - less than a typical DOT layer, anyway, so I don't think they're reducing TTKs that much.  So the choice between out and away comes down to ""do I need 10% damage reduction and a meat shield, and do I think they'll stay alive?"" or ""do I want their away passive and buffs?"""

marvelheroes,3d0508,Voykid,8,Sun Jul 12 10:47:00 2015 UTC,"Many things I think.  The playstyle is not what people expect lore wise.   I play a hybrid dark Phoenix build that requires toggle dancing.  You have to switch between mental and Energy to proc the power Cosmic legendary for example and the mental damage is less.  In dark Phoenix you transform and your power are different, like rocket Raccoon ultimate. I forgot the term, but people don't like that in general.   I like her and green Raid without problem and clear Cosmic terms.  Being mostly Ranged I assume cmm and cicp should be fine too,  don't recall trying.   Also, I'm at full omega, it helps, not sure without a minimum how she is for end game stuff."
marvelheroes,3d0508,UltraMat_MH,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:05:51 2015 UTC,People don't like that her builds aren't like Jean in the comics. And then go and play Rocket summoner. The hypocrisy of people is mind blowing. Just in general I feel like people hoot and holler when a hero isn't 'lore-appropriate' in the slightest bit yet they all feel fine with turrets on Rocket. It really annoys the crap out of me.
marvelheroes,3d0508,dragonsroc,9,Tue Jul 14 06:19:26 2015 UTC,"My buddy has mained her since beta. She really needs high end gear to get above average damage, I believe her BiS slot 5 is either a perfect cosmic or jinn, neither of which is easy to get, and to really max her ttk you need to do a stance swap from mental to energy.   That said there is nothing wrong with her, he clears all content using her no problem, she just isn't great at anything, and makes you work a bit more. Personally, I really don't like her movement lunge in Phoenix form at all. Gaz has stated they want to move away from stance dancing and I think that includes aoe toggle stuff so she might get a good touch sometime soon, but I have no links to share about that right now.   Fun fact:  Back in the day Jean, Storm, and Wanda were the only big ranged aoe chars. Jean was top in dps by a lot (she was the first or second op hero to get a skill nerf outside beta), Storm was top in pure aoe, and Wanda was the cc master."
marvelheroes,3d0508,lopeztein,5,Sun Jul 12 11:21:04 2015 UTC,because neither of her playstyles works so you have to make a stance dance hybrid which the character hasn't really be made to so it's a boring to play really.  they should buff overall dammages of both stances and add some wave clear to the mental version cuz she really lack this kind of power
marvelheroes,3d0508,shard135,8,Sun Jul 12 11:39:46 2015 UTC,"I main Jean and see her quite often, maybe you're just unlucky? Jean is average/a tad above when it comes to everything endgame. She is getting new costumes, new default/Phoenix costumes, a tuning pass, and unique updates within the next few weeks. We'll be seeing a lot of Jean soon."

marvelheroes,3d0508,Edeen,3,Sun Jul 12 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"Shes considered one of the weaker heroes currently, although very soon she is getting some updates to her abilities and mechanics. Not sure if that's the Antman patch or just after but devs are collecting feedback on it currently if you check Jean forums.  Shes fun, you should stick with her and reap the benefits once she gets her updates."
marvelheroes,3d0508,khrucible,2,Sun Jul 12 11:07:31 2015 UTC,"She would be my main but I don't like her powers. The constant damage  aura is too flashy so I usually have it off, and she has no real telekinetic powers.  All I want to do is knockback enemies with an invisible force but I can't even get that."
marvelheroes,3d0508,Atrumentis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:02:26 2015 UTC,My issue with her currently is her uniques are quite bad.  Regardless if you go mental or phoenix you need powers from all 3 trees which means getting them all above 40 is impossible.
marvelheroes,3d0508,Valiantheart,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:19:45 2015 UTC,"if you go for a phoenix build its not that bad. you really only need TK and Phoenix trees, and with her current itemization you can easily hit 50 in most/all relevant skills.  you'd have low points (in the 30-ish) in the telepathy tree, but that isnt a problem for phoenix builds .   Jean can get cr/cdr up to silly levels so telepathic detection can be low without hurting your dps much.  mind crush is a 1 point wonder and for lethargy the damage scaling isnt impressive anyway, so you can easily miss the points there againt without hurting your dps that bad. Actually i'd argue Lethargy is more useful for the slow (and kickstarting Loki's synergy) than the damage of the dot layer itself.   the rest of the tree is entirely forgettable for phoenix builds."
marvelheroes,3d0508,arcdevil,2,Mon Jul 13 07:46:40 2015 UTC,I think you may be using 'relevant' a bit loosely.  Most of her crowd clearing powers are in her telepath tree.
marvelheroes,3d0508,Valiantheart,2,Mon Jul 13 18:39:59 2015 UTC,"and I think you might have skipped the part where I said "" for a phoenix build"".  You are gonna max Telekinetic Throw (or Phoenix Drain if they tweak it into a worthy skill), Kinetic Wave, Dark Phoenix, Unleash Phoenix, Phoenix Inferno, Telepathic Detection and Crushing Telekinesis.  Those skills are all no brainers, there ist much room for juggling around.  thats 140 points right there. with the 1-point wonders going into mind crush, phoenix corona and exhilarating aura, that leaves you with 19 points and a bunch of skills left: hammer, lethargy, neural, implosion...one way or the other, there isnt room to get ""Most of her crowd clearing powers in the telepathy tree"", its just 19 points, not even enough to max one more skill.  many people dump in psychic lethargy. Im fine with that, another dot layer, that also slows, its nothing to call home about in terms of dps but serviceable in terms of funtionality.  personally I prefer to dump those points into Psychokinetic Implosion. Its another average-low damage skill, and yes, I'll admit that on the paper its very likely a net dps loss........but Im not a fan of overusing DoT layers in most chars because they are annoying to time perfectly with all the snapshotting, so they always end up performing worse that ""on the paper""  and PI does exactly what I want it to do when Im in phoenix build...bring the enemies to me. its funtionality greatly outweights the possible dps loss.  and anyway, even without investing heavily into telepathy Phoenix build isnt exactly short on AoE damage.  Nearly her entire kit has crowd clearing capabilities. TK pierces, KW, inferno and implosion are pbAoE, CT is almost screen-wide AoE, and in DP the inferno gets buffed and her basic bolt also pierces.  honestly, I dont need neural or hammer for anything, and lethargy is ok as a 1-pointer just for the loki synergy.... I rather get myself a moderately decent damage in implosion to go with its added funtionality, than splitting 19 points into 2 or 3 more skills that will end up mediocre, and which I dont really need anyway.  YMMV of course."

I plan to use her for the cosmic terminal grind once I get her to 60 (just a couple levels),   Not sure why everyone is saying she requires the ""stance dance.""

marvelheroes,3d0508,tobiasosor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:42:55 2015 UTC,"This post is in stark contrast to the ""clone war saga"" posts near release. We have 40 some odd heroes now?   It has alot to do with relative power level and popularity.  Given average power, then popularity will determine how often that hero will be used.   I would guess that movie watchers are most of the player base. Higher/lower power levels will make a hero more/less common. This is not considering: 1) fans ""x is my favorite because [reason]"" 2) public saturation outside the comics. Most people (if not everyone that plays) know about the heroes in the avengers, but few know about squirrel girl. 3)random box rewards.  Jean grey has fallen off with the public awareness due to the age of the x-men movies. Add on her power level being sub par (from what I understand in this thread), and you end up with a lower percentage of people playing her.  At least this is the way it looks to me."

marvelheroes,3d00hq,NocturnalG,3,Sun Jul 12 09:25:42 2015 UTC,"Venom is pretty similar to Spidey but more powerful and updated than Spidey. My main is Spidey and I just prefer his look and overall simplicity, hes very easy to gear and a very easy hero to start with.  GR is a bit more advanced, his end game gear is harder to come by with various hybrid items you can only buy during specific events and his playstyle involves juggling your hp levels which can be dangerous for newer players."
marvelheroes,3d00hq,khrucible,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:26:24 2015 UTC,"This is very important information. I have not heard about these events but now I am seeing it's this cosmic thing going on. How frequent do they occur?  While I am confident I will be able to learn the playstyle, perhaps GR wouldn't be ideal for gearing out a first character.   Maybe I'll just finish the characters I already have and make this decision in the future. Do you know if Doom or venom is easier to gear?"
marvelheroes,3d00hq,lopeztein,2,Sun Jul 12 10:42:10 2015 UTC,"The real thing to juggle with gr is that he is a hybrid mental/physical damage type. That's why all these other itemization options open up for heroes like him where doing one damage type will proc boosts for other damage types by a lot.   Spidey is pure physical and will be able to share artifacts with venom easily. That said, spidey's synergy (right-most tab in ""powers"" ui) is rubbish no one uses, while gr's is a must have for any mental hero as it adds a flat 4% crit chance to mental at lv 50.  If you really feel like you're going to commit to this game for a while you might consider cyclops purely for his 10% bonus xp synergy which does make a big diff especially early on. He has some melee skills but truthfully he is a ranged glass canon and really easy to level that way.   If anything, this isn't a choice between right and wrong, it's more about different grades of fun, and small efficiencies. Go with your gut on this one, if you make a mistake you'll still be able to get the heroes you want with splinters or $ in a few more weeks of playing."
marvelheroes,3d00hq,khrucible,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:49:06 2015 UTC,"Cosmic Chaos is every couple of weeks, when its up there is still alot of farming required to get the stones for Power Doop enchant, Power Cosmic legendary, doop runes. For GR you'll likely want all of these and you may also want a Grenade Artifact from the ARMOR event(soon to be updated so might be easier to acquire)  Venom uses his own uniques for the most part so he would be easier to gear similar to Spidey but he does also have some HP spend and HP gain mechanics though.  Doom is really hard to gear for as a summoner, multiple boss specific uniques and hard to farm artifacts. His Caster specs are easier to gear by comparison but also use hybrid items from events.  Aside from hero specific gearing, do note that Cosmic Chaos is useful to most heroes. Firstly the Power Doop URU enchant is very strong for multiple heroes(even non-hybrid) so its worth farming anyway. Secondly the recipie for upgrading insignias from epic(purple) to cosmic(yellow) is from the event and also very worth farming anyway."
marvelheroes,3d00hq,Andromansis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:00:39 2015 UTC,"Events of that nature are ALMOST weekly.  One time there wasn't an event for a week and everybody was confused.    Sorcery Doom and GR are similar.    Everybody is going to say ""Go summoner doom"" but I say... Sorcery Doom is just as, if not more effective and probably a bit easier to gear.  Also you could go tri-doom with Power Cosmic, but not a lot of people recommend that.    Doom is a very versatile character. His tech tree might be getting some buffs here soon to bring them in line with the other two."
marvelheroes,3d00hq,Teddou93,2,Mon Jul 13 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"About TC account, you're right, you need to wait until your account is transfered to the TC server.  First of all, Ghost rider isn't really a ""melee"", he has a power tagged as Melee (his chains) but it actually hits from range.   Spidey can be played both melee and ranged, but his melee build is the ""best"".  Between the 2 I'd choose Ghost Rider for 2 reasons :   Ghost is way more viable in endgame content (he is very strong), eventhough Spidey can do all content aswell. Spidey's kit is a bit outdated, you don't use many powers, and the one you use have very old animations, whereas Ghost have really shinny power (HELLFIRE !!!!!)   Moreover, Spidey is actually a bit similar to Venom (not super close tho), and Ghost has a very unique playstyle so I'd recommend him.  IMO, if you're new and only have 2-3 heroes and you don't actually NEED a specific hero, I'd HIGHLY recommend you to buy random hero boxes. The chances to get a duplicate is VERY low, and you might end up with a 600 ES hero that you paid only 175 ES for."
marvelheroes,3d00hq,Mgtl,3,Sun Jul 12 09:44:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. Yeah my current 2 heroes I have are from the random boxes. Got doom/venom for 175. I plan to continue doing that for awhile as I collect splinters. I do believe I still have a choice of one 'free' starter unlock I guess? I was considering  GR or Spiderman for that choice.  Appreciate the insight. GR is looking more appealing.

marvelheroes,3d2zb3,makone222,9,Mon Jul 13 03:49:16 2015 UTC,I hit 7500 by accident.  Not once did I ever grind for exp with the thought of leveling omegas.  I played the game the way I found it fun and 7500 just happened.
marvelheroes,3d2zb3,ProfJackAss,2,Mon Jul 13 05:04:29 2015 UTC,I have never grinded for anything in the game. I just log in go about my business been omega capped for awhile now also have lots BIS gearing. Have only used daily/event boost gifts. It's like watching to toaster it seems to take much longer when you are looking at it
marvelheroes,3d2zb3,wotrick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:52:12 2015 UTC,"Its worthy of note, that at least for a while on the Thursday that the server side exp didn't seem to be working (at least according to my maths) with over 800% exp from synergies and boosts I was getting 1 Orb per run (about 1.2 bars per kill), when, if the serverside exp was active I should have been getting around 3 per run. This was annoying because I'm at about 2.5k Omegas by just playing the game as you both suggest and the one time I sit down to grind some, I cant. Guess I'll go back to ignoring them and letting them happen again."
marvelheroes,3d2zb3,FullMetalCOS,12,Mon Jul 13 10:57:14 2015 UTC,"It's been stated by devs that the average player will take around a year to get 7500 Omegas.    I don't know what playtime the average player plays.  It took me about 5 months total, I think (after a few months off here and there).  I didn't ever specifically grind Omegas at any point except for maybe the last 1000.  It's a tough grind if you're specifically grinding Omega points.  It's a drain for sure.  The best advice I can give is to just play the game the way you want.  If you want to bust your ass for Omegas, go ahead.  Otherwise just chill, do term rushes when you want.  Level more stuff.  You'll end up with a bunch of Omegas just from leveling and it puts you in a different mindset.  As for people requiring a certain number of Omegas for Genosha.. all I can say is: lie.  No one can tell how many Omegas you have.  As long as your gear is up to par you should have no problems."

marvelheroes,3d2zb3,Galyndean,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"Leveling new heroes doesn't do much for omegas, as the XP required for an omega point doesn't scale with level. At level 60 they come reasonably fast, but at lower levels you could play for hours without gaining any points.  I've played around 1 hour per day since launch and just got over 1000 points during the anniversary, as I mostly level new heroes. I guess I don't fit the profile for the average player."

marvelheroes,3d2zb3,t--,2,Mon Jul 13 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"It took me about 3 months without buying any boosts from the store to reach max omegas. The best advice I can give you is to dedicate a night or 2 to simply farming for ~6 hours straight on the tail end of an omega week/decent exp event. I personally liked to spent the last 2 days of the omega events doing just that (when I was still under the omega cap). Owning a lot of heroes to get the passive exp synergy up is very helpful. Cosmic Midtown on a Monday is also great for omega farming. Being in a party is 10% or 15% more exp, I can't remember, and I recommend having a dedicated runner (fast teleporter), and 2-3 boss killers (Hulk,Doom,Cap,Sw,Etc.) for your cosmic terminal farming party. You can also wear a moleman medallion (12% more exp) and spec into Int omega nodes with an int pet IF you are the runner for your party (can get like 10-25% more exp from int stacking).  I was really hungry for omegas, just like you, to get into red raiding and genosha when it first came out. You don't have to do any of this, and you will get the omegas naturally for simply playing the game. Honestly all I wish now is that exp orbs did something, other than just block my view of items on the ground.  On the other side of this topic, I had a friend who started playing about a month after me and capped a month before I did. He was able to farm all 7500 omegas in a little over one month boosting (1200% bonus exp) and farming like mad. I think he must have dropped over $150 just on boosts for that."
marvelheroes,3d2zb3,Jephbro,4,Mon Jul 13 02:58:55 2015 UTC,"cosmic taskmaster? I suspect the 72% missing hero synergy xp is hurting a bit. Also note that omega farming in cosmics is pretty good during the cosmic event too, because you get 42% server side boost combined with the double xp orb drops.   With that said, if you have a fast hero, taskmaster takes about 30 seconds. Getting 70~100 omegas an hour is pretty good imo. A humungous variant in how fast you get omegas is how quick you are. If you are gambit rolling through the terminal and/or take a long time on the boss, you will be getting 20 omegas an hour. A super rough yardstick is do you get back on the next boss (and probably kill him) before your sig is off cooldown. If not, maybe you need a better hero/better gear/spend zero time on his loot.  Buffwise: They have given away various pot boosts that stack with the green pot and bar. Avengers boost was the last one(?), but they've given a lot out from various ""Redeem Key"" codes. [although they seemed to have slowed down, or stopped the redeem codes entirely] Odin's boosts can come out of Asgard fortune cards which can drop from Odin boxes during an Odin event, although this is rare. Play long term. Save any big buffs and use them when it is maximal to do so.  Omega pointwise: You get boxes of 5 omega points from various login rewards. You get them from shared quests. You get them during omega week. You get them from some achievements. I'd personally recommend just playing the game, with a slight bent towards omegas if that is your penchant. Farming Taskmaster is great and all, but I've been omega capped before genosha even came out, well before achievements. Farming those 500 cosmic doc ocs for the pity octobot (and at least another 500 after that, and still never seen it actually drop) and getting zero omega points makes me regret most of the taskmaster runs."
marvelheroes,3d2zb3,Marv_the_hero,2,Mon Jul 13 04:03:14 2015 UTC,"Upvoted for ""pity octobot."" :D"
marvelheroes,3d2zb3,ElectricZee,2,Mon Jul 13 03:16:13 2015 UTC,"First of all, get to 200% synergy before trowing in that much boosts. You really cannot make up for it any other way. Make sure you have a completely Tasky Smasher to do this with. A toon that is simply top tier DPS, that can get to Tasky in under 10 seconds every time.  Then, pop a few boosts and have at it. You can do 250 Points an hour that way. I suggest doing it with a Mental Hero, spec all your Omega into Intelligence for the XP boost. Get an XP% boosting Uru.  I was at 160% Synergy during Big 10, had just a green pot / bar, and gained 175 omega's in the boost hour. That is subpar, and was about 105 Tasky Runs. You can hit ""the last 5000 Omega's"", around when you passively gained 2500 and have 200% synergy in about 2200-2600 runs during the right event. This takes people on average 3 Omega events in which they can participate fully.  Boosts are pay-to-skip, since they speed things up, it's not straight up pay-to-win, you can still get max omega without buying boosts!!!"
marvelheroes,3d2zb3,Uniqron,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:36:20 2015 UTC,"""That much in boosts""?  Its just the ones you get from FCs.  I pop that every time I'm leveling a new hero from 50-60, let alone when I'm hardcore Omega farming"
marvelheroes,3d2zb3,droid327,2,Mon Jul 13 14:14:03 2015 UTC,"Ok well here's a few things to consider:   You don't have 200% hero synergy yet. Omegas were meant to be something end game players could grind out and keep a certain level of progression on their accounts (Reasons to log in a play some when you have everything leveled to 60 and a ton of blessings and stuff) One of the major reason the omega event is awesome is because it redices the cost of omega points by 24% (17 mill to much lower) If you want to push them hardcore with what you have right now you will most likely burn yourself out. Do you have a lvl 80 leg for your main yet as well as 4 blessings? (Something else to grind for and which gives decent xp).   Otherwise, other people have posted awesome stuff in this thread so good advice all around. But you're probably better off not rushing your omegas."

marvelheroes,3cyg25,Doomsaw-Gazillion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:01:33 2015 UTC,"Great news. I too think it will be the most important content to come out. The thing this game is lacking is a real end game mode such as danger room.  If done well, it will easily make MH the best ARPG currently out. Maps in PoE are amazing.  My only concern is how the reward system will work. Itemization in this game is really funky when compared to PoE. Most hero unqiues are BiS. PoE doesn't really suffer from this as there can be rare items that surpass most uniques, making map mode the best way to hopefully find such items or orbs(currency).  Either way, I'm really looking forward to this."

I can't imagine this screwing with the market, and they could add the generic 100,000c price tag to make it less spammable.  Thoughts? Ideas?"

I would love to be able to mix and match different effects from artifacts normally not used on a character beyond using only one on a costume. It would also be nice to then be able to use visuals that you might only get one of thru a special event or super rare artifact.

marvelheroes,3cy4jm,unsettlingideologies,2,Sat Jul 11 23:20:40 2015 UTC,"For direct defense, you can try Kraven (very minor damage negation, health, defense), Tombstone (health, defense, Toughness buff), and possibly Sabretooth (health regen, HP on hit, melee dmg+).  Those are your three Passives.  Take Colossus' support power (defense, minor damage negation) and perhaps She-Hulk's support (recover 20% maxHP on use, buffs damage, attack/move speed, small chance to completely ignore damage).  And those are your two Supports.  As for attacks, you still have Impacts (max of 2) and Attritions (also max of 2) to play with, along with a bunch of Core moves.  I'd suggest swiping Kirigi's teleport ASAP simply because it's useful and could be handy for making quick escapes from enemy AoE spots.  Since you're already using Sabretooth to buff melee attacks, you might look into Wolverine's Bone Claws for a basic that also boosts crit rate for a few seconds.  I like using Cyclops' Ricochet Blast basic to clear out trash mobs and for a light ranged attack.  Most people use Gambit's Ragin' Cajun for heavy burst damage with a quarter-second cooldown on hit, which really shines with RB or anything that hits quickly.    Good luck!"

marvelheroes,3cvlde,WideLight,0,Sat Jul 11 20:08:44 2015 UTC,because a costume certainly will fix the game play!
marvelheroes,3cvlde,SecretAvenger420,5,Sun Jul 12 22:35:40 2015 UTC,"So are the visual upgrades separate costumes or do they replace the existing ones?  Yay pics, though, thank you for posting them."
marvelheroes,3cvlde,pamkhat,5,Sat Jul 11 04:16:13 2015 UTC,"If they do it like they did the Spider-man one, it'll be separate costumes (BOOOOOOO!!). Hopefully it'll be visual updates to the existing ones."
marvelheroes,3cvlde,cnostrand,3,Sat Jul 11 04:58:22 2015 UTC,"That Spider-Man one also features a different voice actor (the guy from the 90s cartoon). It was an ""enhanced"" costume in terms of voice."
marvelheroes,3cvlde,KnowNothingNerd,4,Sat Jul 11 06:22:04 2015 UTC,"The voice was already used for other costumes before though right? As in, it wasn't an entirely new voice."
marvelheroes,3cvlde,reygis01,3,Sat Jul 11 06:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's used for the Symbiote costumes."
marvelheroes,3cvlde,_Valisk,2,Sat Jul 11 08:56:30 2015 UTC,"The costumes Symbiote, Superior, Amazing, and Back in Black are all voiced by CDB, but he uses different lines for each."

marvelheroes,3cvlde,Valexexe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:20:41 2015 UTC,I believe the Amazing costume is a different voice than the other non-enhanced Spider costumes.  Edit: Nevermind. His voice is used for a few others. I wasn't aware of that.
marvelheroes,3cvlde,KnowNothingNerd,3,Sat Jul 11 13:51:09 2015 UTC,From what they said these visual upgrades will overwrite the existing ones in game.  Meaning if you own the costume you'll get the upgraded and the older version won't exist anymore.

marvelheroes,3cvlde,boscoist23,2,Sat Jul 11 07:23:00 2015 UTC,"The last one is probably Super-Skrull (showing off both fire and rock powers), while the one above it are regular male/female Skrulls."

marvelheroes,3cvlde,aspergillus01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:08:03 2015 UTC,Well the Skrulls could make a captain mar-vell..
marvelheroes,3cvlde,Ed-Zero,2,Sat Jul 11 14:20:47 2015 UTC,"They're Skrulls.  The Skrulls can shapeshift and assume the appearance of anyone. Their biggest storyline in Marvel is Secret Invasion where they slowly, over many years, replaced a bunch of heroes/supporting characters as sleeper agents and invaded Earth.  Gaz has been teasing that they're coming for a long time. In X-Defense, when you beat Kingpin, his body would turn into a Skrull, and Prof. X would comment that this ""needs to be looked into."" Technically, all the cows you fight in Bovineheim are actually shapeshifted Skrulls. And last year, Gaz teased a Secret Invasion-esque storyline by showing a picture of a Skrull Captain America.  So, it'll likely be some kind of new content based on that."
marvelheroes,3cvlde,jmarFTL,3,Sat Jul 11 06:18:04 2015 UTC,They flat out show a skrull in the Ultron mode cinematic.
marvelheroes,3cvlde,CptJamesTAsscrack,2,Sat Jul 11 07:58:23 2015 UTC,"God Emperor Doom, sweet."
marvelheroes,3cvlde,Valexexe,2,Sat Jul 11 09:20:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, very impressed with the Jean Grey Redesign.  It might be worth picking up her White Phoenix costume now that it's on sale.  I'm so glad they went with the Gatling Gun on War Machine.  It looks butter than the new turret they changed it to.  Jane Foster Thor looks good, but I still really like the Earth X costume.  Maybe if the voice acting in the new costume was different and better, it would make me switch."

He's just pointing out, and I'm agreeing with him, that Gaz was giving out a lot of codes for a long time, and then it just mostly stopped.  Last year, at SDCC, there were like a dozen codes.  I'm not sure on the number, I was just surprised because there were a lot, but they were only good for a brief time.  We're not saying we're ""entitled"" to codes.  We're just saying it's surprising that they aren't doing it anymore.  If White Knights want to donvote this to oblivion because it's the only way they can get an erection, that's on them.  You do what you need to do, kids."
marvelheroes,3cx02p,avatarofshadow,10,Sat Jul 11 18:10:36 2015 UTC,"Most of the recent freebies have just been automatically given to people, instead of requiring promo codes. Personally, I'm okay with this, because it means you can't miss one by accident."

There was no codes given out with each e-mail Gaz sends like they have for a year... which is what this entire thread is about. Nice try.
marvelheroes,3cx02p,C_L_I_C_K,-3,Sun Jul 12 09:17:35 2015 UTC,"3 major freebies and you want more? Lol. Maybe you should start a thread at free axis uniques at login.

LOL  Again, this thread was about how Gaz has stopped giving out codes as part of their marketing promotions. They did this for a better part of a year and suddenly stopped doing so the past 2 months. Ignorant whiteknight man-childs like you refuse to acknowledge that fact. But but anniversary event!"
marvelheroes,3cx02p,C_L_I_C_K,-6,Sun Jul 12 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe, just maybe, they got fed up with spoiled ass kids whining about codes not giving them enough.  ""omg this code only gave me x, gaz plz wtf is this!""    It doesn't really matter what gaz does they will get flamed for not doing enough and its really kind of annoying to see the bullshit they have to put up with.  I know I'm tired of it."
marvelheroes,3cx02p,jasonrawr,2,Sun Jul 12 22:19:19 2015 UTC,"Link me to any thread where anyone was whining about not getting enough free stuff from codes.   Another whiteknight making shit up, acting like this game has a bunch of whiny, spoiled, entitled kids."
marvelheroes,3cx02p,C_L_I_C_K,-4,Sun Jul 12 22:43:43 2015 UTC,You see it all the time in game chat.  Social chat.  I don't lurk the forums looking for shitheads complaining about codes.  If you think there aren't people complaining about the stupidest shit.  When the birthday event was around within the first day there were people complaining because it didn't seem special enough.  Then what did gaz do they doubled the loot drops.  People complain all the fucking time dude please tell me you aren't that fucking blind.  There are too many spoiled rotten little shits running around in this game.  Go ahead get your entitled buddies to downvote me into oblivion.  You know I am right.    People might not complain nearly as much about codes as they do other shit.  The other day I called out someone in my SG because they were acting like an entitled little shit and I was the one who got reprimanded so don't even think I am white-knighting.    I'll link you to the thread starting from this page on you will see salt domes forming because rewards are going away.  or  have changed because these people don't read patch notes.  So they complain to gaz when it was indeed their own damn fault.
marvelheroes,3cx02p,jasonrawr,2,Sun Jul 12 23:02:31 2015 UTC,"You're talking about other complaints not relating to this thread. There are plenty of complaints to be had about this game. Some are legit, others not so much. The anniversary event did suck until Gaz decided to listen to the playerbase and up the droprates.  The thread you linked has nothing to do with this thread's topic or codes in general. Again, you can't link me to any thread either on this subreddit or on forums where you see ""spoiled ass kids whining about codes not giving them enough."" That is your whole argument in the first place and now, you're changing topics because you can't back up your claims with actual evidence."

Kind of a slap in the face.  So talk all the shit you want kiddos.  Apparently the trolls and cry babies have free reign over the forums. Too much politics and drama on the forums.  I should have never even gotten involved.  Try to open peoples eyes and you get disagreed into oblivion.  Edit:  Yah apparently its a bad thing to point out to people that they are fucking retarded.  It's ok for people to call gaz on every mistake they make but the minute you turn it back around on them they get the downvote brigade on you, or flag your post then gaz takes action against you and doesn't see that the person flagging your post is shitting down gaz's throat.  keep crying kids its working."
marvelheroes,3cx02p,jasonrawr,2,Sun Jul 12 00:17:00 2015 UTC,Calling people out is in fact also against the forums rules. You use the report button

It doesn't matter anymore.  I'm honestly so fed up with the politics in this game.  There are a select few that have gaz by the balls.  They can say whatever the fuck they want and nothing is ever done about it.  they are simply appeased and they shut up for a little bit til something else comes up.  The forums are nothing but grown ass people acting like fucking children and crying because some obscure as fuck marvel character isn't playable in the game yet.  ""omg gaz plz why isn't xxxxx playable yet?!?!? imma go kill myself if this hero doesn't become playable next month""    I guess I am just more frustrated that our society has become a baby back bitch association."
marvelheroes,3cx02p,jasonrawr,-8,Sun Jul 12 05:38:43 2015 UTC,I thought the kids were the ones making posts about being entitled?  So many contradictions here.  The OP clearly asks if we are not getting codes ever again because they didn't get one from SDCC...yet. ;)

marvelheroes,3cwfnb,TheWiseMountain,41,Sat Jul 11 10:20:04 2015 UTC,"In the Marvel Heroes community?  Because she was one of the first 4 teamups and was probably the best one of them (she granted life leech abilities at first).  In the comics?  Because she's a distinct and interesting character.  She's been around for the longest time as Colossus's little sister and (probably more importantly) Kitty Pryde's best friend.  In the more recent comics, she's been established as the ""untrustworthy hero"" archetype.  Basically, the pseudo-villainous hero that personally I don't think has ever been done as well in the X-books.  Mystique always seemed fully villainous.  Sabretooth was always too redemptive.  Emma... I never understood why they trust her in the first place.  But Magik (Illyana) was never fully a villain aside from brief things (Inferno) but she often makes ""morally objectionable"" choices to get the win.  One of the more recent scenes that I've personally really liked involved the New Mutants fighting Legion, but realizing that if they start lashing out and killing his personalities, they're going to damage him permanently and they get overwhelmed.  And then when the rest of the team is defeated, Magik shows up and Legion starts gloating to her about how her hands are tied.  And then she explains to him that she doesn't care about him and she starts slaughtering his personalities and making his condition even worse.  So TL:DR - Good implementation of anti-hero.  I know I voted for her over Green Goblin and Nick Fury because I've never been a fan of either.  But Magik, I've read books specifically for."
marvelheroes,3cwfnb,matlockheed,10,Sat Jul 11 10:57:45 2015 UTC,"Another questionable judgement she made was trapping a bunch of Japanese guns-for-hire inside of a volcano on a little island of rock to soften them up before questioning, fully aware that the fumes would kill most of them."
marvelheroes,3cwfnb,jongiplane,4,Sat Jul 11 11:40:02 2015 UTC,Or the fact she ATE LIMBO and has it and everyone else living inside her shes a beast a mutant with teleport powers and a master of magic who has trained with some of the most powerful magic users including Dr. Strange
marvelheroes,3cwfnb,makone222,5,Sat Jul 11 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"Considering how many times she has been shafted by fate, she's still a pretty good person.  Plus, depth... on the surface she seems like a fan-service character, but her actual backstory and relationships with other characters are pretty interesting.   She's one of the X-family's only magic/mutant double-threats.   Many comic characters die and come back, but her's was one you actually felt really sad for. Someone like Punisher or Wolverine being brutal is just macho bullshit, she actually had her soul ripped out by demons, so when she's being brutal she's actually trying to restrain herself. Her relationships with everyone are varied and great. She awkwardly tries to be normal in her own broken way around Peter or Kitty. She's partners in crime with Emma.

marvelheroes,3cwfnb,MonzcarroMurcatto,7,Sat Jul 11 19:28:41 2015 UTC,She's a teenage mutant demon queen.
marvelheroes,3cwfnb,Teragrym,3,Sat Jul 11 16:46:58 2015 UTC,I can't speak for everyone but she was my favorite instantly when I started reading comics.  She has a trenendously powerful and fun teleportation mutant power. Has had part of her soul corrupted to make a blood stone pendant which allows her the use of magic and creation of her Soulsword.  She is currently the ruler of the hell ish limbo dimension and can summon demons.  I'm a huge original new mutants fan boy so I may be biased but for these and other reasons she gets my vote.
marvelheroes,3cwfnb,Andromansis,3,Sat Jul 11 17:33:33 2015 UTC,"A) She's already in the game and has some neat powers and sustainability.  B) Her backstory is... more interesting than most.    C) She is a mutant, and a sorceress.  She is as powerful with magic as Brother Voodoo and Doctor Strange, and probably even Doctor Doom.  I forget which run it was where scott and emma and a few other x-men picked out new junior teams, but that one had quite a lot of exposition regarding her on top of being a pretty solid run."

marvelheroes,3cwfnb,unsettlingideologies,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:50:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, I can see that. The play style might be fun. I guess I'm just surprised that GG is such a fan favorite.

I honestly just didn't realize that he was as popular as he is. I guess I was wondering if there's something particular I'm missing. (I haven't read that many spider-man comics. I focused on other stuff in comics, and got my Spidey fix from the cartoons growing up.)"

marvelheroes,3cwfnb,Elzam,0,Sat Jul 11 22:57:12 2015 UTC,"Magik is honestly one of the longest-lasting X-Men characters that exists. The daughter of Colossus, she is the iconic little girl that he saved from a runaway tractor on his collective farm.  Due to some other-dimension chicanery which you can find on the Marvel wiki, Illyana is aged to 16 and knows both white and black sorcery, swordsmanship, and hand-to-hand combat. On top of that, she has her mutant power which are ""stepping discs"" which let her and others transport not just wherever they want in the world, but wherever in time.   Magik's just all around a great girl, and someone that's unfortunately cut out of most major X-media despite playing a huge part in the X-Men from the Claremont days to today. She's constantly having to watch herself and how she uses her sorcery, else she lose her soul forever and become the Darkchilde (her evil persona).  So, what else... well, as we said she's a Sorceress. On Earth she's a  bit more limited in power, but she's been training with Dr. Strange and is very capable now to the point she's considered a candidate for the next Sorcerer Supreme. She's got a kickass Soulsword which originally only wrecked magic when it cut it, but since coming back to life and post-AvX, it can cut physical things as well.  She's pretty kickass. Like Kitty Pryde for me, she means a whole lot to many people who were either young when New Mutants had its first run or read them later. Many readers were hesitant with the New Mutants at first, and including Magik who they recognized from the earlier X-Men (Uncanny) and her own miniseries did quite a bit to legitimize the series.   Now if I could only get people on the Warlock bandwagon... I mean seriously, who wouldn't want to play a guy who when he turns into the Blackbird he gives it little bird talons?"

(Yes, I know she is a very different character, but in terms of the character's super powers she's just a weaker female version of Hulk.) Obviously she deserves to be her own pc and her power set looks very different.

marvelheroes,3cwchc,sirius017,6,Sat Jul 11 09:24:22 2015 UTC,"Making a boss unique have a cool affix, better rolls or bis wuod be in the spirit of and ARPG - they don't have to outshine the hero unique by too much. Good topic op!"
marvelheroes,3cwchc,brendamn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:38:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Brevik said they will be doing something with Any Hero unqiues. He said it won't be a pass over them...meaning current ones will not be getting buffs.  So what they have in store for them, who knows. This may or may not affect raid boss uniques or term boss uniques.  I still think that boss uniques should be bis for certain heroes and builds. It's cool that for most you only have to use their own for the most part, but then we are left with a lot of useless items.  They shoukd add unique affixes and visuals and auras. I think that would really make them shine."
marvelheroes,3cwchc,CosmonautDrifter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"Considering what a huge grind-fest this game is, I'm disappointed that current uniques will not be affected by future buffs.

marvelheroes,3cwchc,Sensaround,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:35:20 2015 UTC,Agreed. Hopefully boss uniques will get some actual buffs. He could have been referring to the regular any hero uniques as far as no buffs.
marvelheroes,3cwchc,CosmonautDrifter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:17:24 2015 UTC,Good point.
marvelheroes,3cwchc,Sensaround,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:27:27 2015 UTC,What I think might happen is that they'll add a separate gear slot where you can put a single Any Hero unique.
marvelheroes,3cwchc,Muspel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I care far more about a rebalance of Any Hero uniques, as boss ones can at least be actively farmed, and many are still pretty damn good, but I can't count how many Any Hero uniques I have that are complete trash for every hero that could theoretically use them. Granted, I don't want to go to the old days where stuff like Spring Shoes were basically required for Storm, but would be nice if they were good enough to compare to modern hero uniques or allow niche builds."
marvelheroes,3cwchc,OgreSamanosuke,2,Sat Jul 11 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"Problem is if you review them then they either become BiS or they're trash, people will use whats BiS and therefore the work required to review all boss uniques would be a waste if they are not better than hero uniques.  With hero reviews they're own uniques are becoming BiS which means heroes are easier to gear and also ""slightly"" removes some of the boss farming(good and bad thing) so reviewing boss uniques just does the opposite. There is no happy medium in a gear focused game like this."
marvelheroes,3cwchc,khrucible,3,Sat Jul 11 10:25:23 2015 UTC,"This is what I also deem to be the problem as of now. The uniques that are getting reviews are doing so because they suck and the boss specific are better.  But then I also think that the problem is that they were TOO bad. So in fact I do think that you could buff boss uniques so they still are BiS (if you can obtain them), while opting for the easier obtainable specific hero uniques you are still ""mid-top tier"" in terms of damage/survivability. There's room for both, imo."
marvelheroes,3cwchc,bigbadVuk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"Then the next issue is, if you make boss uniques better than hero uniques now then you are creating more power creep."
marvelheroes,3cwchc,khrucible,2,Sat Jul 11 13:32:16 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day, as long as the gear's value is based entirely on a small set of stats, we're going to have BiS shenanigans.  Right now, DR, Crit, and CDR are the only stats worth anything for TTK.  Health and LoH are the only stats worth anything for TTL.  Yes, some builds mess about with attack speed and there are other certainly edge cases, but 95% of the builds rely entirely on these basic stats.  Weave in skill bonuses and that's all she wrote.  I would love to see some interesting gear.  Gear that has new procs that are worth having.  Something like:   % chance to summon minion on hit (up to 3 or more depending on damage,health,etc.) for X period of time % chance to make dodge reduce damage by 100% for X period of time % chance to reset all CDs (or just one) Death heals all allies to 100% and resets their CDs (For Coulson!) Hit gives enemy explosive/fire/frost debuff - on death, mob AoE explodes for X% of their health % chance for damage on hit to become AoE for X seconds +% damage per nearby ally (I work better in a group) When under % health, automatic AoE paralyze/freeze for 2 seconds   You get the idea.  Right now the only thing that matters is straight TTK and TTL.  I'd love to see some variables shake that up a little."
marvelheroes,3cwchc,grinr,3,Sat Jul 11 10:26:02 2015 UTC,"Right now, Gaz's approach to fixing heroes and items is to just go with what currently works instead of fixing the underlying problems. So all the defensive stats in the game are pretty much worthless when you can just band-aid the problem away with in-built passive damage mitigation and LOH/regen. Defense? Dodge? Projectile Deflection? Tenacity? All worthless.  Damage stats like crit/brut rating/damage are just overwhelmingly better than anything else. Attack speed is scales very poorly, and diminishing returns are incredibly harsh.  Summoners went through a rough patch because their stats are generally very undertuned, and the only way to make them better was to just buff their base heroes and hope the problem goes away.  So really, there's a limit to how far Gaz can fix itemization before they'll be forced to actually go back and fix the core problems with the game itself.  There are too many unbalanced or broken game mechanics that don't get attention because Gaz prioritizes new mechanics and content instead. It's just how F2P markets work. It's cheaper and more profitable to just keep releasing new content than it is to go back and fix all the old broken content."
marvelheroes,3cwchc,Hellknightx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:17:42 2015 UTC,"Any hero uniques should be more important, and they're crap now... Not sure what the priorities are. They are making a mess indeed."
marvelheroes,3cwchc,ProtonixChaos,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:19:41 2015 UTC,"Only certain ones. Some are still really good, like Nisanti, White Gorilla Pelt, Kraven's Lion Vest, Octobot Controller, Batroc's, Coat of the Skull, Fragment of Twilight, a few of Onslaught's uniques, and Spear of the Gorilla are all solid in certain builds. I admit some other options aren't quite up to snuff anymore, but I'm fine with the current state. When min/maxing Jugglenuts, for example, I only use one of his uniques. I know other characters aren't quite the same (given Juggs scales with spirit, so some items are more valuable to him than others), and some of the reviewed uniques are REALLY strong... but some are also quite mediocre, which leaves them open for alternatives."
marvelheroes,3cwchc,KamahlFoK,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:48:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like hero specific uniques should be where you get all of your ability ranks, while boss uniques are a lot more offensive/defensive in the stat department.    The DR/CR/CDR/BR/BDR/HP/regen(/defense/dodge, if they ever become desirable) on hero uniques shouldn't be as high as raid uniques.  In-turn the raid uniques should never have more than +2 to powers.  Stuff mostly follows these rules now, but some specific hero uniques are way over budgeted.  I also feel boss uniques should come with some really cool procs.  Some crazy procs that make them earn the name ""unique"".  Some already have decent procs, but could go further.  There should be a choice to make.  Do you get your abilities to rank 50 or do you up your offensive stats?  (Maybe there's an obvious choice, I don't know.)"
marvelheroes,3cwchc,ledbetterus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yea, not like every hero with a less favorable affix on their slot 1, 3 or 4 isnt already using a fragment, coat or batrocs...."

marvelheroes,3cv8zx,_Impulse,15,Sat Jul 11 01:46:55 2015 UTC,"One thing you gotta understand, the X-Men have a pretty rabid fanbase. Many people only read X-Men comics are only care about X-Men. Don't believe me, go through the ""AP3"" fan poll and read how many entries are just a list of 12 mutants.  I'm pretty sure that if you put ANY mutant in here, without another mutant to split the vote, they'd be winning. That said, people like Magik because she's hot and has a magic sword. Psylocke is also crazy popular. And when Magik gets in the game, you can bet people will then start clamoring for Dazzler or Jubilee.   I do think she deserves to be in the game. That being said, we're still missing some major characters from Marvel history like Beast, Namor, Angel, Wasp, Black Bolt, Nick Fury, all of whom I'd consider bigger players in the universe than Magik. On the other hand, a lot of people think Magik will have a cool playstyle, so she may end up more fun to play than some of those I listed."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,jmarFTL,2,Sat Jul 11 01:57:37 2015 UTC,Namor   And Namor isn't going to happen due to licensing issues.
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,Gravskin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:59:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I voted for Magik because I really like her character.  You are right, I am a huge fan of X-Men and I only read X-Men titles and Inhumans, so when it comes to voting, mutant or inhuman will have my vote.  But subjectivity aside, Magik has the potential to have extremely cool powers in game!"
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,TheRuinedKing1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"As I said in the official thread, this is a terrible way to run the vote at all.

marvelheroes,3cv8zx,swescrane,5,Sat Jul 11 01:49:02 2015 UTC,"As a huge Illyana fan, I love her origin story of how her soul was corrupted by Belasco and then her trying to fir in with New Mutants and the rest of mutantkind. Plus, her powers are pretty amazing, Soulsword is so cool (imo) and she's probably the ""best"" teleporter in Marvel world since she can move in space and time."

Kamala Khan would be cool, but she seems like more of a rehash of Mr. F, though she can embiggen and stuff.."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,boscoist23,3,Sat Jul 11 07:27:03 2015 UTC,"Miles has the same basic power set as Pete, with the addition of camouflage and a venom sting thingy. Not really enough to make a whole new character out of but hey, we're also getting War Machine."

marvelheroes,3cv8zx,swescrane,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:59:08 2015 UTC,"For me it comes down to her having the most potential for a unique kit between her teleporting, magic spells, big honking sword, and demon summoning. She would easily be the most visually interesting as well as have a lot of different build options.  Nick Fury is a close runner up if he goes necromancer but his abilities still won't be as visually interesting as Magik.  Green Goblin = Silver Surfer  Miles = Spider-man  Wasp = ranged Ant-Man  Ms. Marvel = Mr. Fantastic"

marvelheroes,3cv8zx,ninjivitis,2,Sat Jul 11 10:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  When they were talking about him last year, they were calling him ""Nickromancer"".  They were saying that his whole schtick was gonna be summoning other SHIELD agents."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,Soske,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:38:50 2015 UTC,Oh. That's definitely different that being a necromancer.
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,ninjivitis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they were referring to the Diablo 2 class since at that point the only summoners we had were Squirrel Girl and Rocket Raccoon, whereas Nick supposedly was gonna be closer to the D2 Necromancer by comparison."

marvelheroes,3cv8zx,arcdevil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:42:06 2015 UTC,"Magik and Kitty were the two favorites of mine growing up.  We already have Magik as a team-up, and Kitty's coming as a hero, so I went for Miles. Magik is safely in the lead as of time of posting, with Fury in 2nd."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,Halaku,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:01:50 2015 UTC,A conflux of things.  I personally voted for her because her powers will work well in game.    Her huge sword should allow real cleave attacks.  Assuming Gaz doesn't suck it up and give her tiny melee range. She has some interesting transformation possibilities.  She's a magic type and we don't have enough of those.
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,dorn3,5,Sat Jul 11 03:02:19 2015 UTC,"It's a shame that no one else even has a chance because of Magik. I hope that everyone else in the poll will be in AP3, Ms. Marvel and Wasp are just too original to not be included in the game. If they do Nick Fury I want Maria Hill as one of his costumes."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,ashtonknapp,14,Sat Jul 11 05:04:13 2015 UTC,"Looks like Magik is running away with it already.  Personally I'd rather have Nick Fury. I think it's cool he has a chance to get in because there was a lot of talk about him at one point having a playstyle similar to a necromancer from Diablo (and fans dubbed him ""Nickromancer."") But the word was Marvel scrapped that idea and the devs stopped talking about him completely.   Hopefully if he does eventually get in, they do Coulson/Maria Hill/Nick Fury Sr. enhanced costumes."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,jmarFTL,3,Sat Jul 11 01:41:46 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be so depressed when it's not my Nickromancer. Hopefully this will mean he'll be in one day, though."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,Figgots,3,Sat Jul 11 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"Marvel already killed the whole ""Nickromancer"" thing, this would presumably be a different concept."

marvelheroes,3cv8zx,NightmareDJK,2,Sat Jul 11 03:26:24 2015 UTC,"I voted Nick Fury.  I expect his voice commentary would be very entertaining, based on how they've developed the character in the movies and recent comics.  To be honest, I would prefer to have heroes as heroes. I have spent far too much time attacking invulnerable doombots when a horde of doombots invades a boss scrum in CMM."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,ElectricZee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:08:09 2015 UTC,"Hopefully if he does eventually get in, they do Coulson/Maria Hill/Nick Fury Sr. enhanced costumes.   They have said that they could do Coulson himself as a hero and have Maria Hill be a costume."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,_Valisk,12,Sat Jul 11 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"Why is Miles even an option? His only power he has peter does not is the venom strike, which can just be added as a visual option to an enhanced costume to one of his abilities (even rename it 'venom strike' in said costume).   Just fix spiderman."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,theswerto,4,Sat Jul 11 02:51:32 2015 UTC,"He can also turn invisible. X-23 is nearly identical to Wolverine.  Also, Spider-man rework is already planned. It's coming out around the same time as the Spider-Gwen teamup and costume."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,cnostrand,7,Sat Jul 11 05:07:02 2015 UTC,"He can't turn invisible, he can camouflage - which could just be added as an animation to agile attack.   X-23 being different to wolverine is because she is different than Wolverine (She is not a perfect clone). Wolverine tends to use his strength and raw ferocity to his advantage, whereas X-23 is a quick stealthy fighter in the comics and other games.   Miles does more or less what peter does, he doesn't need a unique kit.   Fix Peter's kit, give him an enhanced Miles costume. The end."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,theswerto,2,Sat Jul 11 05:09:38 2015 UTC,"One major consideration could be what Marvel allows them to do with Miles. They're going way out of their way to establish Miles as being a major character, and NOT ""the black Spider-Man"". It wouldn't surprise me too terribly much if they said no to Miles being a costume swap of Pete."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,cronotose,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"But that makes no sense - he is 'the black spiderman, with a little extra'.  Dude got bit by a radioactive spider.  He swings on webs from a web shooter.  He's a smartass.  He just has the ability to change the color of his suit to camouflage, and he can punch you with electrofied punches that stun you."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,theswerto,3,Sat Jul 11 21:08:29 2015 UTC,"Not to sound salty or anything, but I'm really not surprised to see Magik taking the lead so fast, given the community hype over the last year. I'm actually surprised they're leaving it up to a vote, and not as a sure thing. I'll be happy to see her playable regardless.  The good thing to me is hopefully this means they have a fair amount of base work done for the heroes that are votable. I wouldn't be shocked to see them in the next advance pack."

I have no idea how these options were chosen, but it feels like the left over scraps of whatever wouldn't be put in Advance Pack 3."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,Rhodair,4,Sat Jul 11 02:11:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's looking at the future. In digital sales, Ms. Marvel out sells Uncanny X-Men. She has a dedicated fan base that might be enticed to trying the game out if the character they adore is in it."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,CyclopsDoesNotCare,3,Sat Jul 11 16:31:42 2015 UTC,"Not to sound entitled (or to imply you are) but I'm kind of surprised at the more obscure choices, too.. especially for no Beast, Blackbolt, or Jubilee/Dazzler. The only reason I say that is because I feel like the community demand for them has been so high, just as high as Nick Fury, and Nick Fury made it into the poll (which I'm happy about) and they've been just as silent about him as the others.  The only thing that doesn't take me by surprise is Magik, because I feel like the voices for her have been the loudest."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,Brianthedoon,2,Sat Jul 11 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"Aye, I tried not to sound like I was complaining or disappointed.  I'll be playing this game for a long, long time, and I already expect the heroes I want most (which aren't the 2 I mentioned; that would be Spiral, Medusa, and Tigra) won't be added for several years.  It gives me more to look forward to :)  I simply found it surprising how much their 5 choices differed from this post.  I totally understand it wasn't unofficial.  Again, I found it interesting and really makes me believe there's several already locked in for the next advance pack but will require more work.  This is also an interesting read on who might make it in the next pack."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,Rhodair,3,Sat Jul 11 02:47:15 2015 UTC,"I'm more shocked that Morales is getting to be a separate hero, they made Wiccan an enhanced for Wanda but Miles is up to be voted for as an entirely separate hero instead of an enhanced costume? I don't follow that logic at all."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,Portablelephant,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:13:32 2015 UTC,Miles has his own comic. Wiccan does not. I adore Billy but Miles is far more popular.
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,CyclopsDoesNotCare,2,Sat Jul 11 16:27:41 2015 UTC,"Sure that's true but Miles is still just a Spider-man, Wiccan is a separate hero entirely."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,Portablelephant,4,Sat Jul 11 20:07:57 2015 UTC,"Kamala Khan is vastly interesting though. Like Beast would just be a melee guy with some tech maybe? Blackbolt would be cool and I'm surprised as well. Also surprised at no Medusa. Anyways, Kamala can grow AND stretch. Plus she has a healing factor and can shape-shift. I think she has a way more interesting powerset than a lot of other heroes."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,ashtonknapp,2,Sat Jul 11 05:07:07 2015 UTC,Beast   Beast has been said to be a side/weekend project that the devs are working on when they feel like it. He will get here when he gets here like X-23. And like X-23 he is meant to be a 200ES hero so they won't chuck him in to a pack like this one.
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,Gravskin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:04:03 2015 UTC,Probably these are the only approved choices by Marvel.  I bet we only got Magik because the player base has been rabid for her.

marvelheroes,3cv8zx,FearlessHero,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:11:22 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it is, the longer they take at making a character I like, the better they'll be at character design at that point in time. Which is why we had 52 Reviews. They can take their sweet time with Nick Fury, because it means more lessons learned and more technology added that they can utilize."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,SoulEroder,3,Sat Jul 11 12:39:22 2015 UTC,"I have a question, wouldn't the Spider-man and Ms. Marvel votes make more sense as enhanced costumes? Are they that different in powers from the ones already in the game?"

She's more in line with Mr. Fantastic, but that's still kind of a stretch (haha).  Miles has a few differences, but he's way closer to Peter's powers than Kamala is to Carol's."
marvelheroes,3cv8zx,cronotose,2,Sat Jul 11 03:18:41 2015 UTC,I imagine Marvel doesn't want to promote Miles as a secondary character or a copy. They've gone out of their way to try and establish the character as being on equal footing with the original.

She's closer to Reed Richards than Carol and would make zero sense as an enhanced. As for Miles, he's a bit closer to Peter ability-wise, but he does have additional powers and it would be pretty unfair to the character to just make him a costume."

marvelheroes,3cv8zx,_Valisk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:28:07 2015 UTC,"Well, Miles does have three powers that Peter doesn't have, so there's a lot of potential there. Web-based powers aside, there's still a lot they can do with camouflage and venom strike."

marvelheroes,3cwf2w,tramium2,0,Sat Jul 11 10:53:40 2015 UTC,I'd add black widow in there.  I'm consistently bruting  for 3 to 4 million with a little over 1k omegas.
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,asylum101,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:31:06 2015 UTC,"Not sure black widow has the highest numbers, but she does well. Hulk and Mk can easily hit over 10 million so.... With the perfect setup, juggernaut can hit over 7 million regularly. Vision with his bot detonation and signature can hit around 10 million."
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,WhatImMike,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:15:07 2015 UTC,I'm sub 2k omegas and my MK sig last hit crits for 17mil at times.
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,asylum101,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:01:36 2015 UTC,Yeah like I said... Easily over 10 million
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,tramium2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:19:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah your right, she has consistent high numbers though as opposed to just big chunks which is more what OP was asking for."
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,trendwitlasers,3,Sat Jul 11 21:50:19 2015 UTC,Captain America's stuff is all big hits
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,Cruthu,2,Sat Jul 11 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"My Captain America has 1 piece 69 and one piece 66 with starter artifacts and I think I'm up to around 600 omegas.  Cheap legendary and power doop.  I average over 6 million with his sig brutes and 1.5-2.5 brutes with the rest of the main rotation.    Level 80 artifact, endgame artifacts, full 69s and capping some of the main skills would get it even higher.  Plus he is surprisingly fun (maybe not surprising for many, but I didn't think throwing a shield around would be that fun so he was my 14th to level I think)."
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,lazyboy715,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:57:08 2015 UTC,I may try Cap next
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,Uniqron,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:18:26 2015 UTC,End-game geared Cap's signature can easily brut for 20m and that's without any cheesing.
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,EMFCK,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:28:09 2015 UTC,"A good choice. The thing with Cap is that you can easily get a LOT of crit and brut rating. Without effort on 63 gear I reached 47% crit and 30% brut! Add some blessings and now 69 gear and there you have it, 55% crit and 52% brut.  With the default rotation, you'll pound away with 1-2 m crits all the time and yes, Cap works great in Raids like this. Now I've taken the time to perfect it, but I've seen Captains around that were 60-60%.  Great hero to use Nullifier on for the legendary. Really worth it!"
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,EMFCK,2,Sun Jul 12 01:13:08 2015 UTC,"If we are talking single hit, if you layer it correctly (team buffs, item buffs, the statue, the active of gift, target low HP) Moon Knight's finishing signature hit can brut for A LOT, my personal record was 17+ million, with each of the 13 ""normal"" signature hits bruting around 1,5 mil. My main, SW, is more geared and only thing that reaches that number is the last hit of her lvl 6 ult. On the other hand, her sig kills everything non-boss, even Hulkbuster."
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,WhatImMike,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:16:15 2015 UTC,"I leveled nmoonknight to 60, but wasn't seeming to get results like that! Maybe I ought to try him again and get better at landing his hits"

But that brut was just my best ever, generally is ""only"" 10 million that last hit, on raids, for solo and CMM I use SW."
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,ProfJackAss,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:09:38 2015 UTC,"It's also build, gear, and circumstance. You won't always hit for that much.  If you're looking for constant crits that large I'd look elsewhere."

marvelheroes,3cwf2w,Quexana,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:53:43 2015 UTC,Hulk is probably the biggest hitter in the game.  Followed closely by Juggernaut and Wolverine(bleed build w/Eviscerate).
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,People_Are_Savages,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"In terms of who can achieve the single largest number?  I think someone posted that Emma can get her minion-detonate skill to brut for some crazy high numbers, and that's AOE too.  But I don't think she's exactly top-tier right now, and I don't know if she's even that viable if you build her just for BDR.  Don't have any experience playing her myself.  Other than that, other people have covered the big ones.  Basically anyone with a really high-damage attack, naturally, can brut for insane numbers with it.  But those are typically on long cooldowns, so if you're looking for someone that can put out big numbers sustainably, rather than just one insanely huge number every 30s, you probably want to find a heavily CD-oriented hero like Hulk or Strange.  Also, summoner RR can fire 4 shots every 25 seconds that can get up to 1M+ tooltip damage.  Wont do a whole lot in the meantime since summons do lots of small hits, but that's a fairly steady stream of Big Red for you."
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,sirius017,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:01:47 2015 UTC,"One of my mains is Luke Cage.  It's hella expensive to gear him (and I'm still missing a couple of pieces, FUCK YOU MAN-APE!), but with ~2000 Omegas I'm at 59% crit rtg (with Buff from Dropkick/Combo Fighter and Misty May) and 49% brut rtg and hitting brutes of 900K-1.3M on his AOE move ""Cage was Here"" and hitting over 4mil on his Dropkick finisher and 2.7m-2.9mil brutes on ""Cage Fighting""."
marvelheroes,3cwf2w,ProtonixChaos,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:27:34 2015 UTC,"I'll post because even though Punisher isn't up to Juggernaut/Hulk/Moonknight levels, she can hit almost seven million with Head Shot on the right target, and her signature gets up over three million on a pretty wide area, along with RPG up around two million. It's fun that, with a little luck, you can headshot for seven million, rapid reload, and immediately headshot again for seven million. Or alternatively, RPG->Davy->RPG to drop a lot of angry on a big crowd. Again, obviously Juggernaut or Moonknight win the big prize (haven't played MK), but Punisher can do big big burst numbers too, and is a lot of fun. I mean, assuming a perfect situation, on a single target you could burst out 2m->7m->reload->3m->7m->2m for 20 million-ish+high burn dot in as fast a time as the global cooldown will let you go, and Punisher's crit and brut chance are both well over 50%. Sorry for rambling."
marvelheroes,3cxp56,Loedkane,3,Sat Jul 11 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"As others have said, NC is on the squishier side. That being said, if you're willing to be patient, I think that he can be a great character to learn on. Because he isn't super durable, you'll have to find ways to avoid taking as much damage. Here are some ways to do that:   His stealth mechanic will be a huge help. You can use it to get the mobs/bosses to stop attacking you, even if only for a few seconds.  Some boss attacks are telegraphed with a big red circle or arrow. If you see one of those pointed at you, teleport out of the way quick. These attacks do lots of damage and will kill a character like NC. There are things called ""cores"" you can add to your costumes at the crafter (starting at level 30 I believe?). They add boosts to your character. You'll want to look for one that gives you 2s of invulnerability when you use a medkit. You can use that when you find yourself in trouble in a fight to survive long enough to retreat or kill whatever's trying to kill you. Similarly, keep an eye out for a Crimson Crystal of Cyttorak (equipable at level 27) which will give you a chance of getting an invulnerability shield in fights. Or really any item that says it gives a bonus to invulnerability.   I may have some low level artifacts I could give you in-game if you're around later. My in-game name is ""Unset"". Feel free to add me and I'm glad to answer any questions or throw you a little gear that might help. I love Nightcrawler, but I understand that he can be difficult to level."
marvelheroes,3cxp56,unsettlingideologies,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:19:20 2015 UTC,"Also, don't hesitate to play around with different powers. You can reassign your power points as often as you want for free, so play around and see what combinations work best for you. (I tend to like making him into a teleporting machine, but some folks prefer to focus on his swashbuckling skills. It's really up to you.)"
marvelheroes,3cxp56,unsettlingideologies,2,Sat Jul 11 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"If I may add, try maxing a basic that gives spirit back, it helps a LOT !"
marvelheroes,3cxp56,Teddou93,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:31:22 2015 UTC,Good call. It's SUPER easy to run out of spirit with NC.
marvelheroes,3cxp56,unsettlingideologies,2,Sat Jul 11 23:15:15 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, leveling NC as a new player is a freaking pain !  I leveled him when I had 3/4 of my heroes (I have all of them) lvl 60, and he still was a pain to level !  I died SOOOO many times with him, had lots of spirit problems, and my damage were very average.  He isn't, IMO, a newbie friendly hero at all.  You have 2 choices :   Stick with him, have a painful leveling but at least you'll have a hero that you find fun max level (and once geared NC is actually good). Make a new account (If you're new I don't think you'll lose much) and chose an easier hero.   Good luck mate !"
marvelheroes,3cxp56,Teddou93,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:56:39 2015 UTC,Are you upgrading your gear as you go along?  Cheap vendor items are all you need to replace every few levels.  Are you staying out of the boss' AOE damage?
marvelheroes,3cxp56,emdeemcd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"I have nightcrawler and I love him, he's gotten a lot of survivability boost recently. I can rock regular MM and ICP but haven't tried cosmic, terminals are fine as well, I've been farming juggy with no issues.  What stance are you using? What is your build?"
marvelheroes,3cxp56,BelGareth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"He is level 20, I don't think stances are even available at that point?  And NC was one of the worst leveling experiences for me. He was brutal until about level 40 or so, after that he got easier/stronger."
marvelheroes,3cxp56,bigbadVuk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:21:16 2015 UTC,"NC is still among the squishiest of heroes, and at lower levels you'll lack much of the gear options to counteract that, particularly on a new account.  Bottom line, don't worry too much about comparing yourself to other players yet.  Even other chars at your level are going to have advantages you don't have yet. It's ok for you to take it slower and just focus on the content you can handle...green terms should be in play for you if nothing else but story mode. It gets a lot better, yes.  Also on your second day you'll get 400 bonus splinters, which you can use to buy new heroes.  NC isn't really ideal for new players right now, he's kinda ""advanced"".  I'd recommend Scarlet Witch, Iceman, or Rocket Raccoon as much more forgiving heroes to add to your roster.  SW being the best there since she's half as cheap and teleports natively.  There's a thread stickied here somewhere for new players, check that out it tells you everything you need. But right now just prioritize gearing and leveling your Crafter."
marvelheroes,3cxp56,droid327,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"Agree with SW (eventho she might spoil his other leveling experiences because she's just TOO good), but I think there are better choices than Iceman or RR because they might have some spirit issues while leveling.  I'd recommend Hulk/Captain America/Cyclops they aren't OP enough to spoil his leveling, but great enough to have an easy leveling and be completely viable end-game."
marvelheroes,3cxp56,Teddou93,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Hulk or Cap, but I was not that impressed with Cyke for leveling.  If nothing else, he has serious mobility issues.  And I found him a little squish, too.  Iceman might have some Spirit issues, but you can always just sit back and let your golems do the work.  And he's got a spirit restore ability.    RR, you must not have played him since the Doom patch, because he has no spirit problems at all anymore.  Summoner spec gets free summons, Assault spec gets huge spirit recharge with his sig, and Explosives is built around a free basic."
marvelheroes,3cxp56,droid327,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:16:07 2015 UTC,"NC is a lot of fun! Idk I loved leveling him and now hes my main and really to me hes amazing. As others said, try to grab a defensive arti and also I would recommend the uru breastplate  Like other people said hes pretty squisy so you need to hit hard fast then run around using shadowmeld (at least until you can take a hit)  I would keep playing him also for thr fact that you will learn a lot about dodging AOEs and it will make your leveling experience much more enjoyable when you take on another hero!   Have fun and good luck!"

marvelheroes,3cuqq6,akusb,2,Sat Jul 11 00:32:19 2015 UTC,Very nice insight & well constructed post. Will make rerolling future artefacts easier.
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,Edeen,2,Fri Jul 10 23:13:39 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for this!  I'm not sure how you go from the relative values (12:3:1:1) to the relative weights (46:36:4:12). Could you clarify what that calculation looks like by any chance?
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,unsettlingideologies,3,Fri Jul 10 23:22:39 2015 UTC,"Oh that's easy.  You just set all the stats on an item to minimum (so total weighted value 0%) and then increase one to maximum, and see what weighted % such an artifact would have.  The weights always add up to 100%, of course, though I chopped some decimals off there."
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,ledbetterus,2,Fri Jul 10 23:38:30 2015 UTC,Where are you getting the stat weights from?  What are they based on?  This is a good post but I'd like to see more numbers.  Especially when you hit certain levels of Crit Rating.  CDR would obviously be weighted higher than it is when you have higher levels of CR.  The same can be said of BR and BDR at high levels of CR.
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,ledbetterus,3,Fri Jul 10 23:33:17 2015 UTC,"From plugging my various ratings into a little program I wrote that sticks them into the damage formulas and then calculates how much effect adding more of each rating would yield.  I don't think finding your weightings is that tough an exercise, lots of programs/spreadsheets/etc. can find those for you  The actual numbers I fed into that program: DR=6375 + 127.2% CR=4034 CDR=11672 BR=2901 BDR=6603  That's my stat sheet values in the Training Room, anyway."
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,pHDantas,2,Fri Jul 10 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, so you made something lol.  I get it.  I thought you were generalizing the weights.  Thanks."
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,jmarFTL,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:49:34 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about the ratio though? Serious question here, since by my estimates (which can be the wrong one, hence the question) it's more like 1 CR = 2 BR = 3 CDR = 5.5 BDR (approximately ofc). I know the ratios scales are different, I just used a more direct one (i.e. to get the same amount of DPS that 1 CR gives, you'll need 2 BR, 3 CDR or 5.5 BDR), but still."
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,makone222,0,Sat Jul 11 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"OK I checked again and I had a problem in my formulas.  I corrected that and now my ratios are a little closer to yours...1 CR= 3.5 CDR=3 BR=6.6 BDR, to be precise"
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,makone222,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:08:59 2015 UTC,"It seems that the stat weights are based on the stats of his personal Scarlet Witch and he gives the numbers here. Generally speaking he's right that crit and CDR are going to far outweigh brute/BDR. That being said, if your brutal is a certain percentage below your crit that isn't necessarily true.   More numbers won't help you, because it's really going to end up different for every hero based on what their stats are and what other stuff they have equipped. What will help you is this: https://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/153077/item-comparison-tool-unsupported . Basically this allows you to input the stats of your character, and then put in the stats of a hypothetical item and see what your DPS increase is. So playing around with that, you can figure out how much impact you're getting from an item (for example, you could compare the roll on your GoK to a max-roll GOK and see how close your roll is in terms of practical numbers)."
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,makone222,2,Fri Jul 10 23:45:07 2015 UTC,while i agree with the sentiment of your post and it is informative to people that bs/bdr is worth way less than chr/cdr  the outcome is still flawed yes it is perfectly okay to settle for less on the brute stats but at a certain gear point bdr does actually become a bit more relevant. not to mention bottom line is 859 bdr is still better than 550 and ergo has 0 impact on trade value
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,makone222,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:49:21 2015 UTC,"Flawed why?  Just the problem with the weightings, or did you see something else?  You like my numbers in the OP better now?  And sure, 859 is always better than 550.  But if it comes down to taking 550 on an otherwise good one, or rerolling it trying to hit 200/200/800/800 (even if it ends up being a worse weighted % overall), then you should stop while you're ahead :)    You have better odds of getting a good weighted roll than a good raw roll for every variable.  80%+ weighted roll is a 4.5% chance....80% raw roll on 4 variables is 0.16% chance.  Or another way to quantify it, you have a 0.7% chance to roll a 200/200/800/800 or better, but you have a 23% chance to roll one that's just as good or better as a 200/200/800/800.  That means people are rerolling a lot of perfectly good GOKs just because of, essentially, cosmetic defects.    If you want to be fatalistic and say that traders are dumb and stubborn and wont ever look past the ""common wisdom"", I cant really argue with that...but I'm hoping to change some minds here so that people start to reconsider what's considered ""good"" and ""bad"" for artifact rolls.  Unique rolls, too, for that matter.    Or at least find some diamonds in the rough to buy for yourself to use, if others don't appreciate their true value."
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,makone222,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:52:33 2015 UTC,the issue with the number is yes your bdr= 6 but what your failing to take into your account is that number is additive to your cdr because of the way bdr = cdr+bdr because of the way it double dips. so the actual value of it may be closer to 20 per point  not 6  edit: ill post my sw numbers in a second
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,makone222,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:00:03 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/DZmoCij.png  as you can see with my numbers 1% bdr = 18 dr and just for the sake of math were talking about a 1k/1k insig  which will give 25% more brute damage 12.5 from cdr + 12.5 from bdr  so 1k bdr actually = 450 damage rating because it is equally match with cdr.
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,makone222,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:15:41 2015 UTC,now back to goks because you can have equal parts cdr/ bdr the bdr is very relevant compared to bdr on its own which is in fact worthless because it doesn't double dip into the stats. hence why your argument that bdr/br on a gok is flawed
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,mvmtGameing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:18:47 2015 UTC,"No, my math does take the ""double dip"" into account.  My formula (now correct) uses the same formulas posted in the Post Patch 2.1 threads, those are the formulas currently in use and the BDR formula considers your CDR as well.  Plus, I verified everything against my stat sheet tooltips for confirmation, and they all savvy.  I'm also unsure what you're trying to say....BDR does not ""double dip"", only CDR does, which is why CDR is weighted so much more than BDR, and why BR/BDR can tolerate such lower rolls on a GOK without making it ""bad"", which was my original point.  Also your numbers suggest that a 1k/1k insig should be equivalent to 371+227=598 DR, not 450."
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,mvmtGameing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:03:56 2015 UTC,yeah i did get the double dip a backwards the way i phrased it and in turn fudged some of my numbers  it would be 387+225 for the 1k cdr and then another 225 from the 1k bdr totaling at 837 so yeah bdr  is not very great. however this still comes back to you saying that 112.5 dr isnt that much to worry about which in your opinion is negligible other might not see it that way because you are just choosing to ignore a stat you can change for the better
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,ProtonixChaos,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:16:05 2015 UTC,also id like to throw in that if your using the 2.1 numbers they are fairly out of date instead i would suggest using this  http://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/115096/a-mostly-complete-min-maxers-spreadsheet-to-the-omega-system-now-with-automatic-planner/p1
marvelheroes,3cuqq6,mvmtGameing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:19:40 2015 UTC,"Hmp...I think you may be misunderstanding some things about the game.  The 2.1 formulas are still the way things are calculated.  Everything they predict matches what's on my stat sheet, those numbers are good.  That thread you linked just talks about omega, it also uses the same formulas I used to calculate its weightings.  And you're double-dipping on your double-dipping.  The spreadsheet you used also uses the 2.1 formulas, which already account for the double-dip in Brutal Damage.  So you cant double it again, or you're triple-dipping.   you are just choosing to ignore a stat you can change for the better   If there was a way to target a specific stat on a GOK and only reroll that stat, then of course you're absolutely right.  But you can only reroll all the stats together.  So you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater...you don't want to look at a GOK you rerolled, and qualitatively say ""oh the BR is junk, back in the blender"" even though in terms of net DPS increase, it was actually quite good.

marvelheroes,3cva8j,shawnomega,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:22:51 2015 UTC,The Emperor is dead! Long live Chaos!
marvelheroes,3cva8j,GreatMadWombat,2,Sat Jul 11 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"I dunno, let's compare resumes...  Emperor of Man has limitless psychic power fed by human sacrifice that he uses to...keep the space lanes free from nasty monsters, and facilitate FTL travel.  Useful I guess but he kinds just makes stuff up as he goes along.  Leto II harnessed the power of prescience to achieve immortality and ensure he could guide humanity towards the proper future.  Not bad either but we're still just talking about one galaxy.  Doom set in motion a plan that destroyed the entire multiverse and recreated it with him as the supreme being.  I gotta give edge to Doom on that one.  Plus he did all that AND can still walk around, he's not a worm-man or a skeleton in a chair :)"
marvelheroes,3cva8j,Halaku,2,Sat Jul 11 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I love doom, but they should have waited a bit for this one. It's too close to the default I think they should've done something vastly different from the current costumes."
marvelheroes,3cva8j,asqwzx12,2,Sat Jul 11 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"Everything but the loincloth on this is amazing, but the loincloth itself is like they took a frontcape, and a backcape(and by cape, I mean ""large rectangle of material that doesn't bend at the sides, and inexplicably floats up), tied them to his waist, and drew on the lines that bending fabric would have.  The Armor? Top notch.  The Cape? Looks pretty great. All the other dooms are in non-shadowed white, or single-color green. Here? it's visually distinctive while still being Doom.  The loincloth? You'll be happier if you can bring attention AWAY from that area.  Personally, I'm using Dazzler Sparklers on my GED, and he looks AMAZING"
marvelheroes,3cttzs,fctd,12,Fri Jul 10 18:51:48 2015 UTC,This would be cool but I would like to be able to grab the stash tab and drag it to another spot. When I first started I didn't have any extra spots. Then I bought two more so one was dedicated for medallions and the next is artifacts. Well then I bought two more and added another medallions and artifacts page but they are out of order now.  So my stash tab looks like this: Crafting.   Uniques Runes.    Medallions Artifacts.  Uniques Medallions.  Artifacts  I want to drag it so the same stashes are side by side
marvelheroes,3cttzs,Currencyy,4,Fri Jul 10 19:56:13 2015 UTC,And icons please. And permanent filters per stash tab so auto sort puts them in the appropriate stashes.
marvelheroes,3cttzs,iBadgerRCM,5,Fri Jul 10 20:16:57 2015 UTC,"One of my mottos is ""Something is better than nothing."" That applies here. It will be nice to have some type of sorting available.  ""@MiketheHoly said:     I want to be able to Name my Tabs is a pretty big issue.""  ""Doomsaw said: That's included, yes.""  This alone will save me thousands of microseconds of clicking through different tabs. Hurrah!"
marvelheroes,3cttzs,ElectricZee,3,Fri Jul 10 20:43:32 2015 UTC,Useful sorting is actually nontrivial.  Don't get your hopes up TOO much.  Inevitably this is the sort of thing where end users expect it to do X when it does Y.
marvelheroes,3cttzs,dorn3,2,Fri Jul 10 20:41:01 2015 UTC,"You should be able to designate specific tabs to specific things, then sort so things go to their respective tabs.  The way it is explained seems like things will just sort one after another ignoring tab separation."
marvelheroes,3cttzs,ProfJackAss,2,Fri Jul 10 20:17:20 2015 UTC,"would request that we could have a lock available on STASH's to stop choice ones from sorting, while i look forward to this, I would like to keep my more pricy items together in the STASH I already have them in and wouldn't want to track them down when they get mix into the low roll versions."

Additionally, this will also help if you decide to implement search functionality later on as it will be much easier to highlight the item being searched if it is in just one tab."

It's the other one, useful in some recipes. It looks like a blue marble."

marvelheroes,3cxehn,WhatImMike,0,Sat Jul 11 17:21:39 2015 UTC,All the heroes have the same problem after the Achievements starts  one month ago. In heroe stat spirit reg is still 0/sec . Its not my problem only a lot of my friends have the same. I have try gear medalion synergies but still not working.
marvelheroes,3cwq97,Drevs,2,Sat Jul 11 12:59:25 2015 UTC,Grab Clea.  She gives you amazing dmg and survival buffs and is the best general purpose team up in the game.  Her damage output is also no joke and her survival is pretty top notch.  If you're only buying one then Clea is the only one you should be looking at as she is equally useful regardless of the hero you are playing.  She is hands down the best bang for your buck.  Teamups have their own gear and can be used regardless of group.
marvelheroes,3cwq97,ProfJackAss,2,Sat Jul 11 16:45:28 2015 UTC,"Hello! Before you buy it, please watch all the videos in this playlist, and this will help you pick the best team up for you! Here you can see how NullRage explained how team ups work and also all 3 modes for each team up. Since you're playing as melee, I would recommend ranged team up, Havok and Wasp are pretty cool!

marvelheroes,3cwq97,TheRuinedKing1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:05:20 2015 UTC,"Yes similar to Diablo in many ways, can gear them, spec them etc.  Team Ups are almost indestructible in anything but the very very endgame content where they might die so melee vs ranged isn't really that important.  It doesn't matter what hero you play if you plan on using the team up in active mode(Like Diablo), all team ups are effective and there is just a few who either do more dps or provide supportive effects like healing/buffs/CC/debuffs etc.  Popular choices are Clea/Magik for dmg and heals, Wolverine for pure dmg or Arachne for Vulnerability and Weakness so you don't have to apply them."

marvelheroes,3cu2qo,superfli31,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:03:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they should've at least gave him some gear, max Omegas, and the keybinds he's normally used to using.

marvelheroes,3cr6qz,ProfJackAss,5,Fri Jul 10 06:29:31 2015 UTC,Honestly the part I'm looking forward to the most is being able to hear the large amount of voice lines recorded specifically for story mode without wasting a huge amount of time

marvelheroes,3cr6qz,bigbadVuk,9,Fri Jul 10 17:49:08 2015 UTC,"DIFFICULTY MODE CONSOLIDATION - FAQ With the Ant-Man patch, difficulty modes have been removed and consolidated!  The goal of this consolidation is to make grouping simplified, but it has several side benefits and lays the groundwork for further changes and new features for the future.  Difficulty Modes  There is no longer a “Normal”, “Heroic” and “Superheroic” difficulty for story mode.  All references to difficulty modes in the Story have been removed throughout the game. There is now simply ""Story Mode""  Grouping  Grouping is now simplified. You do not have to switch difficulties at any time in order to join another player’s group, you simply join them.  Story Mode Experience and Missions  Experience rewards for story mode have been greatly increased.  Players can level from 1 to 60 in story mode alone, at a brisk pace, if they wish.  Several new optional story missions have been added in various chapters, with experience awards, to aid in leveling. More may be added in the future, as needed.  Those new missions will be reflected in your mission log, if you wish to complete them for fun, but there are no new “must have” rewards.  Achievements  Several achievements related to difficulty modes have been simplified or moved in the ""Retired"" section within the Feats achievement category. They will remain on a player’s record for posterity, but no longer contribute to achievement point totals. This applies to the Heroic and Superheroic versions of the ""Defeat the Brotherhood"" achievements.  Achievements which required an objective to be completed in a specific difficulty mode have been adjusted to simply require that task to be completed in ""story mode"" and not reference a difficulty. This affects nine achievements in total. If you've previously completed those achievement, you will of course keep your credit.  The set of achievements requiring a defeat of Doctor Doom in Superheroic mode now simply require the defeat occur in story mode. (Since Doom is towards the end of the revised story, it's roughly the same difficulty). These are the ""... vs. Doctor Doom"" achievements. If you've completed them already, you'll keep your credit.  Treasure Rooms  Whenever a story region spawns, it usually randomly creates two of the three possible treasure rooms in the area. For achievement hunters, it will no longer be possible to simply change difficulty modes to try and respawn treasure rooms. It will require either a relog or joining a different party.  However, we are going to increase the spawn rate of Treasure Rooms to the maximum possible per region (resulting in ~50% more treasure rooms in any given story region), which will be exciting.  Consider this if you want to complete certain achievements in an easier fashion before this change happens.  Mission Awards  Story-mode mission awards have been consolidated whenever appropriate, essentially resulting in “triple” rewards for many missions.  If a mission awards health, spirit or power points, completing the mission will now combine the awards for Normal, Heroic and Superheroic into one award.  A player who completed any of these missions, on any difficulty, prior to the patch will receive full credit for completing all three of them.  If you have not completed any difficulty of these prior to the difficulty consolidation patch, they can simply complete it afterwards and receive the full “triple” credit.  If you've already completed ANY difficulty of these missions in the past, you don't need to do anything - everything will be handled automatically.  Story Mode Artifacts  Three artifacts awarded for quests are no consolidated to award only the Superheroic version, with a name change and lowered level requirement. Details:  Maht's Arrowhead (Normal) and (Heroic) are no longer available. Maht's Arrowhead (Superheroic) version will now be awarded as the quest reward, with a reduced level requirement of 19 and the item name officially changed to Maht's Bladed Arrowhead. Image: http://i.imgur.com/n8kkhM2.jpg  S.H.I.E.L.D. Motion Tracker (Normal) and (Heroic) are no longer available. S.H.I.E.L.D. Motion Tracker (Superheroic) version will now be awarded as the quest reward, with a reduced level requirement of 19 and the item name officially changed to S.H.I.E.L.D. Motion Analyzer. Image: http://imgur.com/JJWMbE8  Yukio's Charm (Normal) and (Heroic) are no longer available. Yukio's Charm (Superheroic) version will now be awarded as the quest reward, with a reduced level requirement of 15 and the item name officially changed to Yukio's Lucky Charm. Image: http://imgur.com/Q1T92NF  If you are interested in collecting specific versions of these 3 artifacts, be sure to complete the appropriate difficulty missions before July 16th if you haven't already. The normal and heroic versions of these artifacts won't be available once the Ant-Man patch goes live and you will not receive the revised Superheroic version once the change is made if you've already completed the missions on normal or heroic previously.  What To Do Now  If you want to acquire the Normal or Superheroic versions of the 3 artifacts listed above, you should complete the appropriate missions now.  If you are an achievement hunter and want to quickly reset treasure rooms by changing difficulty modes, you may want to do that in the next week.  If you want to have some achievements in the ""Retired"" category of X-traordinary Feats, you may want to complete the Heroic and Superheroic versions of the ""Defeat the Brotherhood"" achievements.  Otherwise, you don't have much to do.  Future Plans  The consolidation of difficulty modes is a fine step to making grouping easier and has lots of benefits for new players, but it also lays the groundwork for additional features for the future.  We are planning a ""Mentor Mode"" which will allow you to auto-magically scale yourself down and group with lower level friends in story zones (and possibly other zones) while still gaining gear for your level. This is planned for later in the year.  We would like to eventually create a level 60 Cosmic Story ""terminal"", with appropriate rewards, achievements, etc.  We are working on designs for self-selected scaling difficulty and other features that will be used with the upcoming ""Leaderboard"" tech.  Let me know if anything here is unclear so I can clean it up or add more info.  The beta version of this Difficult Mode Consolidation work will be on test center tomorrow night and will launch with the Ant-Man patch."

Blade is popular of course.  I don't even think he's a bad choice.  Just that the players aren't getting many of the heroes they actually want.  Half go to tie-ins media.

marvelheroes,3cul0a,emdeemcd,6,Fri Jul 10 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"Rogue is the one character that specs really don't work well with yet. Gas has stated that to allow her different specs to have different powers would mean a much deeper, more complex, and more time-consuming rewriting of code. I believe they said they're open to doing it one day, but it is far from a priority right now.  That being the case, her specs can still be (somewhat) useful because most builds won't use all of her stolen and borrowed powers at once. So you can steal the ones you want for multiple builds/specs, especially if there's any overlap."
marvelheroes,3cul0a,unsettlingideologies,2,Fri Jul 10 22:30:24 2015 UTC,"U/unsettlingideologies is the only correct answer. OP is asking why Rogues powers aren't changing. He sapped the powers of people for 1 spec. Then for spec 2, chose to forget all powers assuming they'd stay for spec 1 and sapped new ones.  Rogue doesn't work like that, you can only have the same powers you sapped across all specs"

marvelheroes,3crx3d,Jeenz5,10,Fri Jul 10 07:39:41 2015 UTC,"The crafting system definitely needs to be blown up. I'm less concerned about credits and molecules and more concerned about the tediousness of the crafting mats themselves.  The Double RNG of the Costume Affix Machine is made significantly worse by the fact that you have to break down mats and click each one individually for each roll.   I'm not normally a fan of artificial barriers (especially when they're barriers to fun rather than barriers to advancement) but there definitely needs to be a system to keep you from having everything immediately. Molecules, mats, and credits perform that function well, they just need to be streamlined so it's less awful to deal with."
marvelheroes,3crx3d,HandsUpDontBan,3,Fri Jul 10 10:55:51 2015 UTC,I wish they would even do something like let you use higher level molecules in a recipe.  Of course you would lose some value on those but when I'm starting a new character I have to go through a tedious downgrade spiral just to set up their costume.  Let me use pures that I can farm up with my 60 instead of breaking one of them down three different ways.

It's super tedious to pre-stock, but once it's all there and organized it's much easier and quicker to use and do upkeep imo. The glyph system is also super annoying to deal with as well. I use my team-ups inventory for most of them, organized by letter or shape similarities-ish  (BCFFFFMPPR/etc); definitely not perfect, but much less headache imo. imgur"

Credits serve their purpose as mostly a low level currency and one that can be quickly sunk into things. The cost to LQ reroll is absolutely necessary, otherwise people would just reroll constantly until they got the quickest one, and it allows for large numbers of reroll but it eats resources so it's not in your best interest to go for a particular one. If it didn't cost anything it'd likely be only a couple attempts at rerolling and then you'dbe stuck with what you got."
marvelheroes,3crx3d,JareDave,6,Fri Jul 10 07:56:37 2015 UTC,"Credits are a currency.  Molecules are a crafting material.  They are 2 completely different things.

marvelheroes,3crx3d,ProfJackAss,2,Fri Jul 10 08:02:11 2015 UTC,I agree that the OP's argument would apply to all other materials as well. But I also think it's reasonable to think of each as a currency. Most modern games have more than one type of currency. It's a way of creating more complex progression systems.

Maybe any-hero uniques require some new item, kinda like a matrix of unbinding. An ""inheritance token"" that you need to craft to the item to make it a tradeable version.  Credits need to have a bigger use too. A credit shop for purchasing pets, boost potions, medkits. Maybe, just maybe, the ability to sell credits at a rate of 1 million = 100 Gs. Im sure Gaz could figure out a way to break even on that transaction"
marvelheroes,3crx3d,SplendidRS,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:35:42 2015 UTC,"Credits are essentially meaningless in this game, but requiring recipes to only use unstable molecules is a horrible idea.

I have yet to see a game that isn't easier to play after 100 hours of playing than it is in the first hour, and that includes most MOBAs that start you at level 1 with no items in every match.     That would be like saying boss specific uniques/artifacts, hero synergies and omega points, and leveling in general is an artificial barrier.    I'd say a bigger barrier would be making all the OTHER crafting materials only stack to 10 AND making it so that there are 9 different levels of them.  But thats a convenience thing."

I agree but their implementation of said barriers regarding crafting is awful.

This topic has come up time and time again over the last couple years, and the developers' response is always the same: ""Yeah, we agree it sucks. We're working on it."" It's frustrating as hell because it's not like you can just ignore the crafting element of the game. You need to jump through the ridiculously tedious and resource-draining hoops to improve your gear. I really wish the devs would devote a good solid month or two to revamping the crafting system, because as it stands it is easily the worst aspect of an otherwise excellent game."

Then you need to buy a Power Cosmic legendary (This is true only if you play a hybrid build aka do both damage types (phys + ener)). Why? Because math shows it to be quite ahead of both Gungnir and M'kraan at level70. If you can afford a level 80 (1000 odin marks), then get the level80 m'kraan, it's the best one. Another reason you should get the PC is: It costs 750 Worldstones, waaaay easier to come by than 300 odin marks. Get the best level 70 legendary (PC) AND save the 300 marks so that you're faster at 1000 marks. Win-win. Then you need to buy the recipe for ""The Power Doop"" runeword (that same math shows it to be waaay ahead of the other runewords, not to mention it's very useful on many many heroes). To apply this, you need 7 Day runes and a Doop rune. Then you should think about maybe getting the ""upgrade insignia to cosmic"" recipe as well . For applying this recipe you need a Doop rune and a Cosmic Upgrade Token (also bought with Worldstones).   That alone will cost you 750 (thePC) + 400 (TPD recipe) + 500 (Doop rune) + 400 (Up insig) + 500 (Doop rune) + 100 (upg token) = 2650 Cosmic Worldstones. And by now you're only set on one hero. ALSO The Power Doop runeword is a roll, so you might get a real shit roll and wanna re-roll it, so you'll never get enough Doop runes (500 Worldstones each), aka you'll prob need at least 2 more doop runes, to be sure. That puts you at 3650 Worldstones.   So my question is... why are you still reading this? GET TO FARMING! (yah, I know it starts tomorrow)"

marvelheroes,3cpqqt,bigbadVuk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:22:47 2015 UTC,"Kinda hard to justify turning the damage types all into one. The lore just isn't there. If anything, with the addition of melee attacks, they may be adding physical damage into the mix."
marvelheroes,3cpqqt,Ishakaru,0,Fri Jul 10 06:26:09 2015 UTC,"for completeness' sake, Its also BiS on the best TTK build for JG right now  But that will probably change in the close future, as Gaz wants to remove the stance dancing so she might not be a hybrid hero anymore."
marvelheroes,3cpqqt,arcdevil,3,Fri Jul 10 07:46:22 2015 UTC,Doop recipes first. Then stockpile for doop runes and recipe mats.
marvelheroes,3cpqqt,WhatImMike,2,Fri Jul 10 13:02:37 2015 UTC,"Some good suggestions here...but I'm going to go against the grain and suggest you level more heroes instead of farm with Ironman.    Each new hero can increase your exp gain to a final bonus of 200% (so 300% of the starting rate).  I'd personally hold off on farming omega orbs until you have a few more lvl 50s or 60s under you belt, as you'd essentially be grinding at a half to a third of the rate others are if you start this early.  New characters will level better this week in stuff like low level midtown, especially on Monday, and they will probably benefit your Ironman more right now overall if you pick a few that synergize well such as cyclops or cable.  You'll still be picking up shards for your necessary purchasables.  Just my 2c."
marvelheroes,3cpqqt,petermesmer,2,Fri Jul 10 10:10:36 2015 UTC,Not sure what Hero you're playing but one thing to consider would be the power cosmic legendary item which you can buy for 750 world stones. It is a great item for hybrid heroes(heroes that do multiple types of damage).
marvelheroes,3cpqqt,Lekks,7,Thu Jul 9 20:23:53 2015 UTC,TLDR; Somewhere in his huge wall of text OP mentioned he plans to play with a fresh lvl 60 Iron Man.

marvelheroes,3cpqqt,KiFirE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:56:40 2015 UTC,"I play ironman a lot, does he use the cosmic legendary?"
marvelheroes,3cpqqt,meowmixjinx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:46:24 2015 UTC,"he can, but with the level 80 legendaries, be sure to be ranking up your influence to be able to purchase them with odinmarks. Those will be better than the cosmic on ironman."
marvelheroes,3cpqqt,Lekks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:47:10 2015 UTC,he can most people prefer the m'krann crystal or and the legendary version as arc reactor enhancement gives 3 damage per suit power and on the 300 suit power on the mkrann thats a ton of damage.
marvelheroes,3cpqqt,Stelcio,0,Thu Jul 9 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"Ironman can technically use it as he has repulsers that do energy damage and missiles that do physical damage. However, his unique mechanics get so much out of extra spirit that the M'Kraan crystal is ideal for him in most cases. So if you have the 300 Odin marks I'd head to Odin's palace and get it from the vendor there."
marvelheroes,3cpqqt,Quexana,9,Thu Jul 9 21:39:22 2015 UTC,True only for grade 80 M'Kraan. Grade 70 M'Kraan is way behind The Power Cosmic.
marvelheroes,3cpqqt,robomatticus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"If you are farming for Iron Man specifically, get these items in this order.   The Power Doop runeword recipe (400 Worldstones) 2X Gifted Doop Rune (500 Worldstones each) Cosmic Upgrade Token (100 Worldstones)   That will cost you 1500 Worldstones and is a pretty big goal to shoot for in one week.  However, it will give you everything that Iron Man needs from the Cosmic Chaos event.  If you get all of that and have a few days to spare, farm up a Power Cosmic, it's very useful on Iron Man and will hold you over until you can farm up 1000 Odin Marks for a lvl 80 Legendary.  And even after that, you can put it on a secondary hybrid hero."

marvelheroes,3cp2ky,Zukuto,2,Thu Jul 9 17:18:19 2015 UTC,"I took ol'green machine to 10 yesterday in Midtown.  That jump straight up and down attack made me laugh.  The running to build anger was nice, I'd show up at bosses ready to go for a change.   But i was curious about +anger, doesn't that just mean it takes longer to go hulky?   Or does having more anger mean he does more damage?"
marvelheroes,3cp2ky,SurrealSam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:29:10 2015 UTC,"+Anger for hulk can be good or bad, max anger doesnt affect your damage however some skills are enhanced by getting to max anger, and some uniques employ a +1/2 to your stats like strength when at max anger.  however its not like having a high anger pool makes it hard to reach max anger to get those bonuses. most of your generators get you there in like 5 skill uses. just keep hitting your target to stay at max anger.  that really does mean you must employ some escape skills in order to survive, because as hulk i've been one shot to rhino and juggs and loki before. using Hulk Fast to get out of danger also means keeping up your anger, other skills like Demolishing charge actually hit a bit of AOE damage as you move, making it my skill of choice for getting out of danger and moving through a cluster at the same time. in my experience its difficult to get hulk to Avalanche leap accross the screen. short distance is fine, but that's not enough."
marvelheroes,3cp2ky,Zukuto,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:13:41 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I'm getting used to using movement powers to get the heck out of the way of some attacks.  Just need to tweak it a little for different heroes.

marvelheroes,3cp2ky,specialaok,3,Thu Jul 9 19:01:34 2015 UTC,Interesting- so based on this and the other responses- his travel power actually GIVES him resource?
marvelheroes,3cp2ky,superfli31,4,Thu Jul 9 21:56:04 2015 UTC,his resource is momentum. keep moving = keep getting resource
marvelheroes,3cp2ky,superfli31,2,Thu Jul 9 21:59:23 2015 UTC,Hmmm cool. Since your signature pic is Nightcrawler- how is he? I definitely like teleporters and not having to have a Ziggurat for terminal farms.
marvelheroes,3cp2ky,Supra93,3,Thu Jul 9 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"He is on the weaker side imo. He is definitely the fastest character I've played and is my best cosmic kurse farmer, but it took a lot of time and effort to get him to that point."
marvelheroes,3cp2ky,Lekks,2,Thu Jul 9 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"Funny you mention this, Nightcrawler and Juggernaut are the two characters I main.  Nightcrawler is an amazing terminal farmer but he is rotation based and needs to be built to manage spirit.  He is very quick, agile, with an aggro dump (stealth) but he actually takes work to use effectively.  Nightcrawler is more effective the harder you work.    Juggernaut is my patrol tank when I just want to smash things.  You could easily get away with 4 buttons or less using Juggernaut and he has incredible survival potential.  Just point him towards the enemy.  You are the one doing the damage though so it requires some attention.  Doom is the closest hero to full auto as you'll get using his summon build.  Not only does it throw up a meat wall against mobs, but they do great damage collectively when boosted by artifacts and gear.  Doom is precisely why I tried Nightcrawler for that engagement aspect and Juggernaut because they play so differently and harder to master."

marvelheroes,3cp2ky,ElNutimo,3,Thu Jul 9 17:23:45 2015 UTC,I just got Cyclops to 60 as my first guy. Just ricochet beam all day. and focus beam when down to one guy and unleash when you can. simple.
marvelheroes,3cp2ky,Roeltjow,2,Thu Jul 9 18:59:22 2015 UTC,I'm levelling Cyclops right now.  Already 50ish.  Ricochet blast is great but I hate having to dodge and run away all the time.  He's squishy and lacks a range taunt.  IMO best to play him with a brawler team-up or summon.

It's important to not treat her like a melee character and just stay a little bit back from the action. I've got one of those cores that gives life and spirit on using a medkit (not a trifecta or bifecta), and I rarely die with her except in Cosmic Patrols (where she has a bad habit of drawing mob aggro with her tempest powers). If you're soloing a boss, she's not the strongest. But for anything where you need to kill lots of mobs, she's pretty unbelievable."

marvelheroes,3cp2ky,IcemanSR,4,Thu Jul 9 21:38:06 2015 UTC,"I know you said you're not super interested in summoners, but I honestly feel like summoner Doom is what you're looking for. Summon your Doombots once at the start of an instance and maybe once in a while when you're thinking about it -- they last until they're destroyed -- and summon your Flame/Aero/Shield trio at the start of engagements, and then you really don't have to do much besides port yourself around the instance. On Vibranium Mines, for instance, I will watch TV and press my trio button every ten or fifteen seconds, and my signature summons whenever it's up, and then I don't have to do ANYTHING else while the robots protect the Vibranium minecarts for me. On bosses, just mash your summons when they come up and hold down LMB to fire your sorcery basic nonstop...and even the basics isn't really necessary if you don't mind waiting a bit longer on your minions.   edit: I literally just got up and talked to my roommate for a minute while doing the first minecarts. When I came back, I was on 1/3 hp, so I popped a medpack, hit the trio button again, and went back to finish my conversation while the robots finished the battle for me. During the second minecarts, I'm writing this post and watching them own all the Jabari."

I had the best of the best gear for my demon hunter after two weeks of leveling with nearly perfect gear.  Personally I like games with crazy rare items because it gives you a reason to play and when you finally get the item it makes your day.  Personally for me the perfect mmo is a game with insanely rare items and a proper trading system (very few account bound items).  I wish Marvel Heroes had more items that were trade-able, but at least there are some items."

I asked my friend who is already near end game in the expansion what keeps him playing after max gear and its basically just playing with the FC for others to get their end game gear.

marvelheroes,3cmc2l,VR46,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:16:42 2015 UTC,"I played Eve Online for about 4-5 years (taking a break because it consumed me) and that game  has a wonderful system for people who love loot, collecting, etc.  The game has a random loot system like you expect but what makes it great is the risk vs reward.  The rewards you can get increase based off the risk.  There is Highsec (relatively safe from other players) that has pretty sub-par rewards for PVE.  Then you have lowsec, nullsec and wormholes all of which is PVP.  Nullsec for the most part can be owned/controlled by players (well very large groups, one group has 45,000 members) so you can risk going into others space to benefit from the better loot.  Wormholes have some of the greatest rewards but at great risk.  Players  can make wormholes their ""homes"" or bases for groups and there is no local listing of players so there the chances of losing your ship / eq raise considerably."

Not because you cannot directly monetize any of that. no, no, no, noooo. because its complicated  and coincidently, the only system you have revamped (...because it was very easy, right?......) was the TU system.   but Im sure the fact that TUs sell for the same cost as fully fledged heroes (when they actually arent even 20% of that) didnt have any weight.  .........  Im curious. at what point did you threw in the towel and decided that the game itself was no longer a priority, and that you'd focus on making a ""marvel pokemon, gotta sell them all"" instead?"

marvelheroes,3cnx8t,Zurtard,3,Thu Jul 9 20:10:22 2015 UTC,"USA, East Coast. I believe it is something to deal with 900 series cards and drivers. Every driver update has been slightly better. From comments, it seems older cards work fine. I am getting the same FPS I did with my old 480 GTX on an i7 920. So my best guess is a mixture of the engine not able to handle the newer cards, and drivers of nVidia. Regardless, it still is horribly optimized.  Witcher 3 60+ FPS constant on ultra/high hybrid with my setup. My setup is configured just fine thank you, before anyone starts trying to give me on advice on where I am having issues."
marvelheroes,3cnx8t,Uniqron,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"That's helpful information for everyone.  It might just be that older cards are more stable due to more mature drivers and lack of enough current driver development.      I would expect nothing less from Witcher 3, which runs multiple NVIDIA engines and has an entire engineer team at NVIDIA developing drivers specifically for that one game.  They have deep pockets and AAA games are a big business."

marvelheroes,3cnx8t,Oshiba,3,Thu Jul 9 11:22:24 2015 UTC,"A few tips from someone who has been a budget pc gamer for ~15 years.  Your CPU will last along time, get a mid-high end one that has good cost to performance ratio. Don't buy deluxe motherboards/latest ones unless you need a specific future tech, chances are by the time the hardware is affordable all standard motherboards will have it. CPU coolers are worth the investment. a cheap ~£30 coolermaster one will allow you to overclock when needed and are vastly superior the stock one.  Graphics card is what you will have to replace the most, i have always bought around the ~£175-200 mark. Usually gives the highest price/performance. Check benchmark sites to see, if a card benchmarks 15% higher but costs £100+ more its not for a budget build.  Dont try to play on a high resolution (e.g 1440/4k)/ higher than 60 framerate on a budget, you wont get it without highend graphics cards or replacing more often. 1080p/60fps is perfectly fine for games imo.  Shop around, you can get some parts like graphics card on a special sale deal elsewhere."

marvelheroes,3cnx8t,Oshiba,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:30:02 2015 UTC,If the budget is a firm 500 then your best bet may to space out the purchase and look for deals and buy the parts over time instead of just buying it all at once.  If you live near a microcenter do check out their mobo / CPU combos as they have extra discounts if bundled.  In fact if you can live with the onboard gpu and save up for a gpu at a later date that might be another option.  Just be creative and bargain hunt for pieces that make sense.

marvelheroes,3cnx8t,Oshiba,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:29:02 2015 UTC,"It depends if you are paying in Canadian $ or US$. AMD and Ati is the cheaper way to go and still get great performance. 8gigs RAM is as low as I would go. Make sure you get a power supply that is high enough for your video card. As for a laptop, maybe a used one. Laptops are pricey and out date fast."

You could easily get by with a less robust GPU than what I'm using.  8GB of memory is the minimum I would use.  Finally, only build for what you need at this time (from a storage/memory/GPU/CPU/PS perspective). Hardware always gets better for the same price point. I would ensure that your mobo will support expansions you are considering (hate messing w/ the mobo too much). My case is 8 years old at this point as are some of the hard drives and the power supply.  Be prepared to troubleshoot. I had memory that had the wrong voltage and ended up causing a few re-installs. I had a bad SSD that I had to RMA and caused a few re-installs. If you do not want to get technical, do not build your own computer.

marvelheroes,3cnx8t,Lulizarti,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:30:31 2015 UTC,"What I found in testing: - 4GB is enough, if you don't have a bunch of background applications running. 8GB might be better bang / buck in general though. Don't look at the BS mhz ratings on DDR3, just get 1.35V 1600mhz ram and be done with it.   This game can get CPU intensive. But in general nothing (any gen) Core i5 can't handle when it runs over 3Ghz. Pretty sure AMD makes cheaper chips if you want to keep budget, but I deliberately ignored them for the last 3 years so I cannot help there. My life is better for it though. (Backaccount probably isn't)   Seems that for 1080 or even 1440p, 2GB suffices. Played on 4K as well, a GTX970 4GB will do, but as always, some scenes just lag. Again, been ignoring the Red company in favor of the Green, but I would strongly recommend looking into used hardware, this is not a good time to buy NEW hardware, given upcoming introductions / recent introductions. 2nd hand last gen will do great for MH15. A GTX760 2GB works fine at maxed settings on 1440P for me.  In general; skimp on the Case, but buy something from a respectable manufacturer. Those $28 Cooler Master cases are fine. Don't skimp on powersupplies. I rather have a quality 300W PSU than some rubbish el cheapo brand ""580W superstrong-no-really"" deal. People tend to get megapixel hyped with PSU's for no reason...

Moon Knight is simply more versatile and can tag a lot of enemies, he's more Area based. Wolverine is better for single target, and since this game is moslty Area, he can be somewhat annoying.

Can sustain at 100 stacks on axis as long as you aren't on fire.  best ttks are in the 30-40s range some even lower.  Very easy to gear all of his uniques are top tier if not BiS for him now.  once axis raid uniques come out he might need one of them to be able to clear red axis.  very easy to play.  see mob kill mob.  uses basics in both of the top rated builds.  He does well in axis as I said before.  CMM you just gotta watch your positioning for the big hits, like man ape spear, other than that he does well.

Just that while it does suck in the meta of this game, it's still specialized enough to make it useful if you choose to build tanky.  Just because one hero has a tankier item in that slot doesn't change anything."
marvelheroes,3cr9mw,khrucible,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:15:20 2015 UTC,That item is an 'Any Hero' unique. The slab is just a relic of a bygone era of the game before they really figured out the direction they wanted itemization to go and before months of power creep. There's tons of garbage uniques just like it.  Maybe once they finish all of the 52-reviews they'll update them to be competitive.

marvelheroes,3crzg9,SurrealSam,4,Fri Jul 10 12:15:51 2015 UTC,"You make some excellent points about the relationship mechanics between giveaways like this and MMOs.  But you're making them a week after the the 2 year anniversary festivities, which, as a new player, were pretty impressive and included all the participation mechanics you feel are lacking with the 25k giveaway.   Then there's the cosmic thing starting today.  I think Gazillion has the participation thing down, but I think you're a bit over-concerned about them using additional marketing tools to hype the game... to a demographic that is possibly not you.  Also, some of the other people who disagree with you also seem overly vehement about it."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,RLGGZA,0,Fri Jul 10 14:59:55 2015 UTC,Yep. You summarized it very nicely.
marvelheroes,3crzg9,aceso2896,5,Fri Jul 10 17:33:51 2015 UTC,"What im thinking after reading your post is that you used the word participation several times. The thing about this event is that you participate simply by playing the game and killing stuff. Everyone that plays the game is participating, whether they choose to or not.  However I love the idea of making something like the DoTA compendium. It was awesome."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,santi_clauz,8,Fri Jul 10 08:25:50 2015 UTC,"Basically going to echo this person and agree with them.  You say that they aren't really marketing, but if you think about it in a round about way they are marketing.  It will cause new people to join and play for a chance to win and perhaps get them to stick around and spend some money.  It brings back some old people etc.  Their goal is to get you to play the game and then hope they have stuff you'll be interested in."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,arsonall,-3,Fri Jul 10 08:28:52 2015 UTC,"Ehhhhhh, I mean I get the point your making, and it feels like a semantic distinction but I'm going to address it in the literal sense rather than the semantic sense.  Cosmic Event : Go kill cosmic bosses, cosmic bosses drop double loot, they drop worldstone caches, and we get exp/sif/rif buff for the duration of the event.  So I log in and kills stuff and I'm like ""This is nice.  Double loot.  More worldstones.  Great EXP.  I can play with friends and get stuff.""  Omega Event : group up for SQs and holosim, get those omega tickets, and I can get like 2-3 blue boxes or save up for a team up and its good.  I can play with friends or I can play solo and achieve a goal by playing.  Odin's Bounty : I really, really, really like Odin's bounty.  Those chests have dropped me like 2000 odin marks in the past two events.  The target rotates to break up the monotony, and you can play with friends and get stuff done :)  Vibranium Ticket : It feels like a raffle.  Stadium full of people and only 5 people get anything at all.    I suppose a better phrasing may have been ""Be effected by"" instead of ""participating"" as there is no drive to accomplish anything associated with the event.  Knowing my luck, even if I did manage to beat the odds and find one I'd be playing the hulk and it'd get brittle and break before I could contact support (because gamma).  Which is to say,  the majority of people participating in the event will get less than Charlie Brown did on Halloween, as at least Charlie Brown got a rock."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,avatarofshadow,2,Fri Jul 10 08:35:23 2015 UTC,"This is just a different type of event. Cosmic, Omega, Odin's are like playing a specific game at a casino to win, and the vibranium ticket is like buying a lottery ticket by simply playing. Why complain that they are giving out large sums of money and adding variety to different types of events just because ""I have bad luck; I probably won't win."""

So don't participate, you make it sound like someone's got a gun to your head.  You don't like it, and no one cares that you don't.  And certainly no one thinks you have any weight in an opinion of authority with all the logical fallacies you're throwing around.  It's hard this day an age for people like you to feel validated:  you had an idea, and a smarter person would have proposed an idea and be open to logical discussion, but all you've done is dug yourself further into the patronized zone dye you your feeling that all things must be your way.  You're selfish, you're stubborn, and you feel that you have no errors in your thought, and that makes you completely dismiss able.  Your idea is bad and you should feel bad, including your attempt to break up discussions with injections of shitty references like ""squirrel girls bow"" ""hulks gamma"""

I'm sure 25k is nothing in comparison to any other marketing campaign for a video game of this scale.  If it brings in 250 people who all spend $100 they will make there money back. I'm sure it will bring much more then that into the game.

The other option is buying $25,000 of banner ads which get dismissed or ad blocked more readily.

marvelheroes,3crzg9,MarvelHero,-8,Fri Jul 10 08:41:03 2015 UTC,"Alright, lets argue the facts here.  You've asserted that your entire clan of 1 to N people came over from diablo 3 to participate, thats great.  More people to play with and I hope they're enjoying the game and stick around.  Now if we keep 25% of them playing for 90 days, fantastic, the promotion worked.    My problem is that you're arguing that its working from a marketing stand point and I'm arguing that it wasn't well conceived and could have been MUCH MUCH more awesome with just bit more thought and time and asked that they take my feedback into account for the future.  Part of my feedback was crowdfunding a bigger prize pool if they decide to do it again using something similar to DoTA2 compendium as a basis for comparison.  If you or any reader isn't familiar with that then here is a basic overview.  People buy a grab bag of stuff, it starts out small and as more people buy it the prize pool gets bigger and more stuff gets added to the grab bag.    So, basically, your insults aside, you're against the idea of them altering the promotion if they run it in the future or perhaps you just didn't read that far into it?  (my guess is you stopped at Squirrel Girl's bow)"
marvelheroes,3crzg9,jasonrawr,5,Fri Jul 10 08:56:44 2015 UTC,"That's a faulty comparison. DoTA 2 is an entirely different game and genre in which all of those grab bags are bought for entirely different uses in the game. Then, the compendium money is used for a huge prize that is used for a professional competition. Doesn't really translate well in an ARPG where there aren't any real competitions going on.  Edit: Even if they use this method of crowd-funding, how would it change how the event is carried out? By your argument, wouldn't it only change the amount of money being given out?"
marvelheroes,3crzg9,Dysc,-7,Fri Jul 10 09:12:20 2015 UTC,"Its really not, and I'd contend that they a good model basis for what rewards would be in those grab bags already with the fortune card mk 6.    http://marvelheroes.info/item/1441/  As you can see, you get a couple costumes, a bunch of buffs, a team up, a pet, and two costumes, and some other niceties.   So if you arranged them in descending order of rarity with a reasonable cap on the unlocks they could probably reach a modest or immodest goal rather quickly, and treat it like a prepurchase for a fortune card that funds the prize pool.  Not the most rediculous idea, and a lot of people don't like gambling, a lot of you really like the event, cognitive dissonance aside I think the idea is worth at least as much of a shot as the current event.  Once the funding is over, launch the card or keep the card in the event roster for the fortune card bonanzas like they had on the anniversary so that anybody that joined after or missed out on the initial buyin for it isn't completely boned.   how would it change how the event is carried out?    Well for starters it could keep the event running for a longer period of time, which according to some people would be great for the overall health of the game.  Also it wouldn't come out of the marketing budget, which would allow them other opportunities to spend their marketing money on marketing the fact that they're giving away 52 or more vibranium tickets in 2016.  Also I'd point out that the model I just pitched allows for everybody that plays the game to get something at least potentially (even if its getting gifted a vibranium fortune card months later) whereas the sum total of potential effected players by this event is 5 winners  and potentially some very disappointed people from other regions.  So I'm going to ask, do you see how all those moving parts are fitting together now?"
marvelheroes,3crzg9,vodkawater,2,Fri Jul 10 09:37:46 2015 UTC,"No, because my points still stand. The grab bag, the crowd-funding, and the prize money are all used, distributed, and function in completely different ways in a completely different game in a completely different genre. So, it is still a faulty comparison.  In DoTA, the bags have a much different impact on the game then would items you get from a fortune card. Thus, incentives for buying fortune cards will not be there like it is for dota. Also, because of this, the idea of simply playing for a chance to win 5k will be a greater pull for many people than spending a bunch of money on fortune cards (which you can already do) for a chance for anyone in the game to win a larger sum of money (even those who didn't buy fortune cards). So you may pay 5k in fortune cards to raise the prize money, but someone who played 2 minutes of the game can win all that money. And this results because in dota, the money goes into a prize competition, while in MH the money can go to anybody."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,MoonTrap44,-4,Fri Jul 10 09:46:22 2015 UTC,"I can't buy vibranium fortune cards :(  Also, small point of distinction, while you could have the grab bag exclusively have the fortune cards what I was suggesting was a presell of the (potentially) entire contents of the fortune card and then having said fortune card available after the presale /finalized prize pool (possibly a month after the fact).  Bigger point of distinction, was not suggesting that they have a larger sum of money but rather more tickets distributed over a longer period of time.  So if they raise the prize pool to $260000 that would be 52 weeks of  vibranium tickets, which would be arguably more effect than 5 weeks of vibranium tickets.  So with that structuring of it you provide the players that contributed via the presale with : the satisfaction of an exclusive reward, as well as all the buffs and bonuses that come along with the usual contents of a fortune card, as well as satisfaction of having participated in some small way in a community event.  But mainly the swag bag.  I will point out that you are correct in regards to the bags having a much different impact, as people will buy them on multiple accounts so that they have multiples to sell via the steam market.  Its also purely cosmetic.  The competitive prize pool is just sort of a bonus after the fact of those two factors, as people like the cosmetics and they like selling the stuff on the steam market and that is where a lot of the value comes from.  I'm not saying ""Look at that $15,000,000 prize pool, we can totally do that"" what I'm saying is ""Well, if we do this again, maybe try something like that and see what you get as a longer event would be better""  it would build excitement for it.  it would have an impact on the community.  Those are two things I feel are completely lacking from this event."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,absynthe7,0,Fri Jul 10 09:59:50 2015 UTC,"But really, it is different.  In DotA people fund a prize pool.  Where a skilled team wins it at the end of a tournament.  As in, a contest of skill.    Basically what you want Gaz to do is have everyone put their money into a pot and randomly just give it to 5 people.  That is literally just online gambling at it's lowest common denominator, and will run into a whole slew of different types of laws than just a giveaway."

marvelheroes,3crzg9,fctd,-6,Fri Jul 10 08:58:37 2015 UTC,"Part of the point I'm making is that they could have kept the marketing department's money, put together a swag bag to presell in order to fund the prize pool, sold those things to satisfied customers, had a bigger prize pool, and still have 25,000 dollars to market the game or put that as seed money in the prize pool or something.    If its attracting new players, great.  I just hope they try something a bit different next time.  I'd be quite satisfied with that guy with the vibranium tattoos (Gentle) as a team up for example, and other vibranium themed things in the grab bag could be fantastic."

I'd maybe add a ""tl;dr"" with this exact/similar wording, to your post.  My counter: This is definitely something diff't. This is just the 1st run of something like this possibly. I'm sure they're listening and gathering feedback for future similar scenarios. Personally, I like the non-event feel of this."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,Drimsdale,7,Fri Jul 10 09:47:35 2015 UTC,"The only thing I gathered from this post was that you are passively dissatisfied with the idea of 5k dropping your lap because it doesn't have an ""event"" feel to it.  They did not have to do this giveaway at all.  They would continue to grow even without it.  The one thing I can appreciate about Gaz (and part of the reason I have given a lot of money to them) is their desire to make the community happy.  They have bent over backwards on many occasions to do so.  It disgusts me when I see criticism about giveaways.  It didn't cost you anything but your time.    As far as drop rate is concerned I've heard it was slightly more rare than a Zod Rune.  I've played since launch and never had a Zod drop.  so what, that's not going to stop me from playing the game.  Just play the game and don't even think about the giveaway, if it happens it happens.  Focus on gearing and progressing your mains/alts and if the vibranium gods themselves will you to have their ticket then so be it."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,RLGGZA,-5,Fri Jul 10 12:55:00 2015 UTC,"I think it was more of an examination of the monolithic nature and binary effect of the event.  What I mean by that is that the event itself feels very isolated from any of the goings on in the game.  Also, at the end of the day, you either win or your don't and there is nothing besides either of those two things.  I feel the event could have been more and just wasn't.  It might be having a positive effect on player adoption of the game, but we won't know that for certain until months down the line, and the feedback stands.  I'm going to quote the last sentence from the main post, as I get the feeling you stopped reading some time before that :    It is my hope that if you do choose to run a similar event in the future that you will take this feedback into account and rethink the event scheme so that it is a lot more inclusive.   That's it really.  They could have done a lot more but didn't.  Is it an effective marketing tool?  Well...  The question is if there is a level of customer engagement that keeps the new players coming back.  I'd argue no, but the marketing team will have the finaliized data maybe a month after the event.  If it increases the population by 25% and keeps it at those levels, great.    I still think there are some great ideas in this thread."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,unsettlingideologies,6,Fri Jul 10 09:10:33 2015 UTC,"""Lets talk about the prize pool as well. You guys put of $25,000 of your budget up for the event. I think you guys forgot the point of marketing. Its to get us to give you money.""  Completely disagree. The goal of marketing is to elevate the brand. Point of sales and special deals on skins is not marketing. That's just business. If a grocery store put a brand of cookies on sale, it's not really marketing although it may seem like a deal to you to spend money. It's a sale. If a grocery store spends 50 dollars on a newspaper ad for the sale, then it's marketing. Is the 50 dollars worth the ad space per cookie sales? Did people come in and buy more than the discounted cookies? Marketing is not a quantitative discipline. Your ROI may not be apparent for some time.   The idea behind this type of give away marketing scheme is to generate interest from people who do not play. It's also a large sum of money to an average individual but not in terms of how expensive marketing can be. I am sure it's a small percentage of their marketing budget. I think the better question to ask is, is this general marketing campaign effective?  Are  vibranium tickets cool -  does it resonate well? How much publicity was picked up outside the general community etc. To date I haven't seen a giveaway like this. Sure it doesn't affect me and my spending habits but it may affect someone else differently.  Personally I do not think 25k is a lot of money. I will save my 1 in 171 million chance on 250,000,000 plus powerball (generally the threshold when I start wasting cash on lottery). I will not be adding extra game time to farm a slim chance.  If it drops cool if not, no biggie."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,MonzcarroMurcatto,2,Fri Jul 10 10:11:33 2015 UTC,"I think it is important to remember that the game is free to play.  Although I love when they do fun events that I can participate in as a casual player who likes to level heroes and that is the extent of my game play as I don't really know anyone else in the game.  I feel as though this event might not include me, but it wont stop me from playing and I wont be playing to win a golden ticket.  Rightfully so they did not have to do any event right now and you'd still be playing, so the fact that there is a passively RNG chance to win $5000 for playing might bring people to put in more hours in the game but ultimately, I play because I have fun and not because there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, only on pretty much every damn hero I own though.  :)  Anyways, have a good Friday, a good Weekend and I wish you all the best of luck of winning that $5000.  Even if you are more likely to be struck by lightning while riding a shark and finding a sunken treasure at the bottom of the sea, all while winning the lottery from a ticket you found in a bottle floating through the ocean.  Take care."

No flashy in-store items, no exp potions, no offer packs, etc. Now the promotion is supposed to last til August 31st, so you can't do anything too crazy, but yeah, maybe a once a week thing like a costume or a potion sale, or vibranium based heroes being discounted would have made sense."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,sappycap,2,Fri Jul 10 12:42:04 2015 UTC,"On participation and inclusion/exclusion: It would be cool if they offered more types of tickets, so that more people could win something. Have only 5 tickets for the big cash prize, but maybe also add... 500 tickets that are a free hero box and/or free G's? 50,000 tickets for a free loot explosion or birthday cake?  Assuming the tech works as intended, there are a lot of things they could do."

marvelheroes,3crzg9,absynthe7,2,Fri Jul 10 10:51:15 2015 UTC,I read everything you typed and have absolutely zero idea what your point is. They already spent a month giving away premium prizes with almost no requirement to obtain (log in) to anyone who. If your point (which could have been written in one sentence) was: 'I'd like to be guaranteed something nifty at least due to probability'... they already did that.
marvelheroes,3crzg9,shard135,3,Fri Jul 10 10:32:58 2015 UTC,"The tickets aren't the event.  There was an Omega File event, and now we're on the Cosmic Worldstones event.  Both of which i'm sure you could write a wall of text about.  And I'd downvote those posts, too."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,MarvelHero,3,Fri Jul 10 15:37:29 2015 UTC,"So if I read this correctly, your main ""point"" (which you repeated at the top and the bottom of your post) is that this giveaway will ""exclud[e] 99.99% of the community from any form of participation"". How exactly does it do that? It's basically a raffle where the cost of entry is simply playing the game. If I'm at a party and there's a free raffle that I enter simply by putting my name in a hat, I'm participating, regardless of whether I win or lose.  http://i.imgur.com/bjQoual.png  We can't all be winners, otherwise there's no point. You're just butthurt because there are few prizes and you probably won't get one."
marvelheroes,3crzg9,shard135,-2,Fri Jul 10 13:21:47 2015 UTC,Nope.  I added a TL:DR to the post at the suggestion of another user.
marvelheroes,3crzg9,shard135,4,Fri Jul 10 14:37:40 2015 UTC,You do spend a lot of time in the OP saying 99.99% of the community is excluded which is clearly wrong.
marvelheroes,3crzg9,firydragon,3,Fri Jul 10 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"It seems to me the event's been quite good in generating hype so far. Pretty much every time I've logged in, people have been talking and joking about it in chat. Everyone who's playing is participating. I haven't felt excluded at all.  Would I like free stuff? Sure, I wouldn't turn down free stuff. But we've just come out of a month of everyone-gets-a-bunch-of-free-stuff. This is different, and, dare I say it, exciting because of it."

marvelheroes,3cjxuv,Susarian,5,Wed Jul 8 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"Hero Tuning  This week’s small patch focuses on buffs for Loki’s damage output, with the goal of moving him towards the top tier tuning bracket for end-game content. Similarly, Human Torch, Ice Man, Moon Knight, Rocket Raccoon and Thing have small targeted buffs in this patch, while Dr. Doom receives an overall nerf.  The upcoming Ant-Man patch will include targeted buffs to Emma Frost and Jean Grey, along with other small adjustments as needed. In addition, Rogue’s EMF power will be buffed to match it closer to the recent Silver Surfer EMF buff.  The tuning process will continue, primarily focused on targeted buffs wherever possible, until all heroes comfortably share “top tier” status for end-game activities.  Loki      Winter's Breath now deals 1% more damage per 1% attack speed.    Lay Waste bonuses increased to 50% per debuff on enemy.   Cold Snap base damage slightly increased, bonus damage against frozen targets increased to 200%.    Arcane Binding damage over time duration increased from 4 seconds to 8 seconds.    Illusion melee damage increased.    Arcane Illusion damage increased.    Meteoric Illusion damage increased.    Arcane Ruin now fully inherits Summoned Ally Damage (was previously partially inheriting it).   Dr. Doom      Dr. Doom's Doom Bots now have reduced health and defense. Explosion damage only occurs when they are defeated, and not if their lifespan expires or you replace them.    Latverian Blockade, War Drums, and Inferno damage reduced.    Worthless Cretin bonus damage when over 75% Magic/Power scaling decreased.   Human Torch      Human Torch's Flame On now reduces spirit costs by 50% while active. Power duration no longer affects this Signature power.   Iceman      Iceman will now direct his Ice Golems to attack the target of Flash Freeze.   Moon Knight      Moon Knight's Tripwire Bolas, Crescent Fan, and Crescent Dart Throw damage over time durations changed to 8 seconds.    Explosive Crescent Dart vulnerability duration increased to 8 seconds.   Rocket Raccoon      Assault Specialization now grants 25% increased damage to Gun powers.   Thing      Hammer Time, Stretch! power now generates a significant amount of Hard Knocks."
marvelheroes,3cjxuv,EvenMind,7,Wed Jul 8 14:27:01 2015 UTC,"Bug Fixes  Fixed an issue that prevented power usage when very close to certain level geometry.  Fixed an issue that prevented the Unbind Armor, Insignia, Artifact or Team-Up gear recipe in the Misc crafting tab from unbinding Unique slot 1-5 items.  Rocket Raccoon's H7 Fleetslayer was granting bonus damage from Summoned Ally Damage regardless of specialization. This is now corrected to Battery Specialization, as listed on the tooltip.  Rocket Raccoon’s Battery Specialization H7 Fleetslayer bonus corrected to 25% of Summoned Ally Damage as written in tooltip (was applying 50%).  Captain America's Ultimate synergy once again applies to Star-Spangled Strike.  Luke Cage's Cold Shoulder will now have its Spirit cost reduced by Strength.  Doctor Strange's Demons of Denak tooltip corrected to match the amount actually healed by the power (which is unchanged).  Rogue's Final Form Nightcrawler power will now be able to be activated 5 times before going on cooldown (at Ultimate Rank 1).  Known Issues  Doctor Doom’s classic costume is displaying Doctor Strange’s classic costume icon. This will be corrected in the next patch."

marvelheroes,3ckmu3,merkabish,2,Wed Jul 8 20:17:30 2015 UTC,I'd keep the hero specific ones in the team up inventory and vendor the least useful of the other ones.  However that is just a thought.
marvelheroes,3ckmu3,Advacar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:31:16 2015 UTC,Why? Hero specific uniques are super easy to get if you want them.
marvelheroes,3ckmu3,merkabish,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:12:21 2015 UTC,"That's why you keep them so you can get sets of 3, 4, and 5 together for your crafter. They come quickly so you can get relics and credit chests."
marvelheroes,3ckmu3,EliseNic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:35:55 2015 UTC,Might want to re-read the thread. We're talking about what to do with all the off-hero uniques you find and I'm responding to a guy who says you should keep them in team-up inventory. There's not nearly enough space there to get sets of 3.
marvelheroes,3ckmu3,DigitalCapes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:49:20 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. He said ""hero-specific"" above you and I figured he meant for the hero you use BECAUSE the post was about off-hero already. But after clarification I agree with your question of why. Vendor that crap."
marvelheroes,3ckmu3,DigitalCapes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:53:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I meant by ""off-hero uniques""...naturally you keep your main-hero uniques until you get sets, but any-hero uniques and hero-specifics for heroes you don't play aren't worth the space to save up."

marvelheroes,3ckmu3,taekwondogirl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:41:40 2015 UTC,I save all my uniques and do the exchange at the crafter once I have 3 or more. Helps me get the collect all uniques for diff character achievements and also gives me lol 60 versions of some that I don't have a max level version of. It's kind of fun to throw a bunch of sets into the crafter and see what you get. Like playing a slot machine.

marvelheroes,3ckmu3,SimplyFreshhhh,2,Wed Jul 8 23:04:53 2015 UTC,"I think that true-F2P players do contribute to the game, just not monetarily.

marvelheroes,3ckg1s,Doomgrin75,3,Wed Jul 8 16:41:33 2015 UTC,Good to know. I'm at 1300 Omegas and was thinking about buying boxes.
marvelheroes,3ckg1s,ElectricZee,18,Wed Jul 8 20:38:06 2015 UTC,"I got Coulson first, then bought boxes.  Boxes aren't going anywhere really and I'm collecting teamups right now, so....  And it's Coulson."
marvelheroes,3ckg1s,Galyndean,9,Wed Jul 8 16:50:18 2015 UTC,"The blue boxes are getting less and less valuable with each hero that gets an items rework. Gaz's current philosophy definitely seems aimed at making the hero-specific uniques better than any slot uniques for most builds (with the summoner items notably an exception). A large portion of the items in the boxes are not BiS for anyone or soon won't be. Plus you're already at 1500 so I would say go for Coulson. You CAN get those uniques in other places, whereas that's the only way to get Coulson."
marvelheroes,3ckg1s,jmarFTL,6,Wed Jul 8 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"You CAN get those uniques in other places, whereas that's the only way to get Coulson.   This is pretty much my reasoning for going for Coulson before the boxes."
marvelheroes,3ckg1s,smbailey1,10,Wed Jul 8 19:17:38 2015 UTC,"Coulson can only be obtained with Omega Access Files.  Everything from a blue box can be obtained without Omega Access Files.  So, spend Omega Access Files on what only they can purchase."
marvelheroes,3ckg1s,Quidfacis_,4,Wed Jul 8 18:53:48 2015 UTC,"Really depends on which other team-ups that you currently have, if any. If you have certain team-ups right now, (Falcon, Wasp, Clea, Domino, and Drax) then getting Coulson is a waste in my honest opinion. I would go for the Blue Boxes, if you had those team-ups. If you don't have any team-ups or if you don't have a lot of team-ups, I would go with Coulson."
marvelheroes,3ckg1s,RogueXxXHerald,3,Wed Jul 8 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"I'm with this person. I haven't seen a single post or thread that identified Coulson as the best Team-Up for anyone. He's not bad by any means, but not significantly better either... probably worse than Clea and Magik. I haven't really seen a reason to grab Coulson other than 1) you don't want to spend splinters/$$ on other team-ups, 2)you love the character or 3) you like the idea of collecting everything. None of those apply to me, so I go for the boxes."
marvelheroes,3ckg1s,unsettlingideologies,4,Wed Jul 8 19:43:19 2015 UTC,"I'd get Coulson as well. The reason being is that there are a handful of boss uniques, before the One-Shots came around, that are outdated."

Again, how do you think this act of pettiness will play out in the long run for this sub? Ya'll need to think beyond the immediate attempts at acting cool.

I'm not saying this guy is mature, or immature But the important thing to remember is that everything has consequences, everything. It is even possible this guy is a punk, who is likely to take this out elsewhere, even real-world stuff. Maybe he has a family, and the hate here becomes misdirected at them. Again, everything has consequences.  I'm hoping I've angered some of you just enough that it results in self-examination instead of just being smarmy and resulting in a small amount of possibly mis-directed hate.

At that point the harassment was of more importance I felt. Especially since I couldn't help him anymore in the trade matter. Although I still provided 2 links very shortly after. And attempting to defend someone getting picked on isn't helpful? You live in a very fucked up world.   If I was trying to hit 1k again, then I would've just hopped on ya'lls little band-wagon.

marvelheroes,3chpiw,The_Keto_Warrior,13,Wed Jul 8 20:28:53 2015 UTC,"The problem with it and the reason I don't think it would happen is that it would make buying the ult upgrade tokens obsolete. Why should I pay 200 splinters for a specific hero's upgrade token when I can pay 175 then exchange it. Yeah it isn't a guaranteed ult token because you could get a new hero instead, but that’s even better savings.   The only solution I see would be turning in 2 ult tokens for a ult token for a hero of your choice. Yes you would be spending 350 splinters for it compared to the 175 for random or 200 for specific, but if they are heroes you never intend to main or play (looking at you squirrel girl)  you aren't really losing anything.  I have a few heroes with rank 11 ults I never play so I understand the frustration.   And if you like the game enough to put money into it, it is well worth it to buy the advanced packs or the mega pack would be even better, but they didn't have that when I still needed heroes. I've bought both and never regretted it and I didn't but the Founders pack or team up advanced pack (the first advanced pack not launch one or the newest one) and my wallet regretted me not buying them."

marvelheroes,3chpiw,EliseNic,9,Wed Jul 8 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"I'd be just fine with this, though there'd need to be restrictions. Like, you can only trade a hero token for another hero you already have, that way you can't cheat the system. Maybe even make it a Pym recipe where you add your token and other items (unstable molecules + pure elements?) in order to make the conversion, plus make the conversion random (but keep it restricted to only characters you already unlocked)."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,Jei_Stark,6,Wed Jul 8 02:06:12 2015 UTC,I like the first idea where you would only be able to switch it with other heroes you have already fully unlocked or perhaps simple just change it into a non specific upgrade token (key word being upgrade so it wouldn't be able to be used to unlock new characters).
marvelheroes,3chpiw,EliseNic,4,Wed Jul 8 02:47:38 2015 UTC,"They could just make it so that you can trade an Hero token for an Ultimate token— that'd be all it takes. Slap a 100-200k price on it to marginally reduce spam, and done.  They are never gonna do it though, because that would allow you to get Ultimate tokens for 175 splinters (the cost of a random box) instead of 200 (the cost of the token), as most people now have pretty much infinite amounts of credits/materials."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,168523,8,Wed Jul 8 08:40:04 2015 UTC,Then make it so you can trade a hero token + 25 splinters for a Ultimate token.
marvelheroes,3chpiw,Adwah,4,Wed Jul 8 10:53:22 2015 UTC,"That would make a lot of sense, actually.  I expect it to go on the pile with all the other things that'd make sense , and never make it into the game."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,168523,5,Wed Jul 8 11:14:02 2015 UTC,"Because financially, it doesn't make sense for Gaz to do this. Part of the reason random heroes cost so little--less than the cheapest heroes out there--is because you can end up with one you already have. This idea would basically take away any risk of duplication since if you got a double of a hero you already had, you could convert it (for the equivalent price) into an ultimate upgrade token for any of your heroes with no loss.  Hoping to get someone you didn't already have and you got them? Lucky!  Hoping to get someone you didn't already have and you got a duplicate? Well, just upgrade your token for the normal price and get an ultimate upgrade token for anyone.  For this exchange to work, the overall cost for the ultimate upgrade token would need to be more--say, 175 splinters for the random hero token plus 50 splinters to change it into an ultimate upgrade. That would give you a slight loss versus just buying the ultimate upgrade (225 vs 200), but still the possibility of a new random in the process."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,Ultrace-7,3,Wed Jul 8 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"We are basically quibbling over the equivalent of roughly 56 cents.  (the difference in splinter costs is 1/8 the cost of an upgrade token.) 200ES Heroes are $4.50. 1/8 of $4.50 is $0.56  This is where Gaz (and other companies who follow their market model infuriate me) Heroes cost 450, 950, 1350G. But you can only buy Gs in packs of multiples of 500. So you are always left with Change. This compells you to either spend more $ to get G, to use your 'change' in order to afford more heroes. Ending up with more Change. Or you spend your change on boosts, fortune cards, and then left with no g so you shell out the $ to buy G to buy heroes. (This phenomena is known as currency obfuscation)  Frankly, I'd be ok with them increasing the price of the Random Hero box to 200ES if I could use the Duplicate result as an upgrade for whomever."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,jbcheney,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"Gaz doesn't seem to sell Ult tokens directly— only heroes, and you can't even re-buy ones you already own. So the Ult token are not really involved with the cash store.  (You can't buy random boxes for cash either, can you? I haven't seen an option in the store).  So, even if it was an exchange in favor of the user (guaranteeing them a desirable outcome), it wouldn't hurt them financially— it would be an exchange between two things you can't actually buy for cash.  As for adding a minor premium, bringing the total cost upwards of 225 (I'd say even upward of 250 or 300 splinters, as they're selling a pet for 350 right now), just so that you wouldn't ""waste"" a token a character that you absolutely did not like, I could see it as an option. I wouldn't care for it, buy maybe someone else would.  I don't see it happening because Gaz, that's all."

marvelheroes,3chpiw,NullRage,5,Wed Jul 8 00:16:29 2015 UTC,"As an AP2 owner, I feel weird about not really needing my splinters at all.  I recently dumped like 600 splinters on a team-up I didn't have just so I could have all the stuff I didn't have.  I know I could upgrade ults and stuff, but I don't really care about end-game content, so getting maxed ults doesn't matter much to me.

And it could contain anyone that you don't already have, ie, a guaranteed random non-dupe. Obviously it would exclude the most recently released hero to avoid abuse by people who already have all current characters. Heck, maybe it can even exclude all the 600 splinter characters, I honestly can't work out if it would be financially sound for Gaz. Just a thought."

marvelheroes,3chpiw,MK43,2,Wed Jul 8 00:15:23 2015 UTC,There is no problem doing this but lets say you get the worst luck ever but no dupes for your first 20 heroes. 20 cheapest heroes non dupe = 6600 Eternity Splinters 20 Random Boxes = 3500 Eternity Splinters I remember it being like 22 before I got a dupe however if your still not sold on buying Random Boxes with your es being new then look at it this way 6600Es = 40 Random boxes (technically 7000es) so basically you can get 20 dupes in your first 20 rnd boxes and its still worth lol taken in consideration that you now factor in cheaper ult tokens.

marvelheroes,3chpiw,elsofer,8,Wed Jul 8 15:29:33 2015 UTC,"I said it once, but I will reiterate it.  We need a new subreddit rule.  ""No more posts whining about random hero boxes""."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,ProfJackAss,0,Wed Jul 8 00:28:38 2015 UTC,"I'd agree, but as a community people are pressed into the random boxes pretty much every time the subject of picking up a new hero comes up.      Every now and then it's not bad to hear the opposite, and I think a lot of newer players would be much happier if they just saved the splinters and got someone they really wanted rather than going with the cheaper random boxes."

marvelheroes,3chpiw,ProfJackAss,0,Wed Jul 8 00:56:38 2015 UTC,"Literally everytime ES are mentioned when buying heroes there's a tsunami of ""buy random until 50%"" answers."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,Yakobo15,5,Wed Jul 8 01:54:41 2015 UTC,"That's because it's literally the better answer for people who want all or most of the heroes.  It's an answer based on really simple math (although the static 50% figure is inaccurate, obviously, as you would want to calculate the ES cost of the heroes you don't have to know whether a box is worth it or not - there's a spreadsheet somewhere with that info)."

I'm not really sure why everyone on this sub is so complacent in the trap that is Random Hero Boxes.   If there is any tip I would give to new players for Marvel Heroes it would be to never buy Random anythings unless you are willing to throw away money. Just save up your splinters for the hero you want and wait for the % off sales."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,SuicidalKirby,4,Wed Jul 8 02:03:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure why everyone on this sub is so complacent in the trap that is Random Hero Boxes.   Because, statistically, buying random boxes is VERY MUCH the better choice until you have a large amount of heroes.  It's just probability.  Dude owned 7 heroes out of 48.  That means there is a 7/48 (14.6%) chance of getting a dupe.  Do do so again is another 7/48 (14.6%) chance after, meaning two in a row is  (7/48 * 7/48), or a total of 2.13% chance.  2.13% is far from impossible.  Unlikely, sure, it's an outlier, it's not the norm.  It's just math.  Of course it sucks when it happens, but to call that a ""trap"" is kind of irresponsible, since you will save hundreds if not thousands of splinters in the long run, unless you are an extreme outlier.  And of course, there will be an extreme outlier at some point, but suggesting that most people are going to be that outlier is silly."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,MutatedSpleen,-2,Wed Jul 8 05:43:07 2015 UTC,"It's still gambling, and gambling is always designed to favor the house.   Saying that random boxes are a ""Very much"" better choice is irresponsible and silly. If the outcome was so favorable then why does it come up so often that people are dissatisfied?  I speak more in regards to BOGO boxes than random splinter boxes.  While still gambling, splinter boxes are a reasonably safe bet with a low hero count. But BOGO boxes have to be purchased, and while it's advertised as a sale, there is an extreme chance to effectively gain no extra value from your purchase if you open a dupe.   You are a perfect example of why the boxes are a trap. You are led to believe the odds are in your favor, but in reality the house always wins.  That being said, I am happy that Gaz has seemed to be doing BOGO less, and actual % off sales more."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,SuicidalKirby,3,Wed Jul 8 14:46:47 2015 UTC,"If the outcome was so favorable then why does it come up so often that people are dissatisfied?   It comes up so often because most people don't feel compelled to post about it when they do well. By comparison someone who gets a ult token for someone they don't use is going to be more upset and more likely to post about it. The reason you see post of people feeling dissatisfied is simply because the satisfied people don't feel the need to post. Random boxes and BOGO boxes are great for new players who don't want a specific hero (I did extremely well with them when I started) calling them a ""trap"" based on the small percentage of people who fell dissatisfied with their results and post about it is  ""irresponsible and silly""."

You are basing your argument on the outliers that are dissatisfied."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,kelborn92,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"Saying that random boxes are a ""Very much"" better choice is irresponsible and silly. If the outcome was so favorable then why does it come up so often that people are dissatisfied?   Negativity bias.  We are always more aware of when we're mad than when we're pleased.  Math doesn't lie.  Even the BOGO.  It's plain and simple math.  You can call it a trap and say silly bullshit like ""there is an extreme chance to effective gain no extra value"", but none of that is true because we have objective, unquestionable math to back up the value of these things.  You can literally calculate whether or not a BOGO or a splinter box is actually a deal for you.  Is it gambling?  Sure, at some level.  But your notion that gambling always favors the house is kind of...well, I don't mean to insult you, but it's stupid.  Gambling favors the house when the odds favor the house.  When the odds don't favor the house, gambling doesn't favor the house.  When you go gamble in a casino?  Sure, the odds always favor the house.  But we can calculate the odds here, and they don't always favor the house.  I'm ""led to believe"" this because I know how to do math and I understand things like probability and chance.  You'll also notice how, whenever I suggest people towards random boxes, I make a point to say that it IS random, and you might be that outlier who gets a bunch of dupes.  But the overwhelming majority of people won't be.  And that's just a fact based on math and numbers instead of paranoia and spite."

Millions of dollars are made everyday because the odds always favor the house. Gaz wouldn't provide the option for random boxes and BOGO sales if it didn't benfit them in some way. In what world do the odds not favor the house? Please provide me some examples and perhaps all of this math you seem to keep referencing without providing."
marvelheroes,3chpiw,SuicidalKirby,3,Wed Jul 8 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"...are you trolling?  I already provided the math two posts ago.  I literally calculated the odds of this guy getting a dupe twice in a row.  Odds aren't a guarantee, they reflect a trend, a likelihood, a probability.  Here's an example of when the odds always favor the house: roulette.  Here, you can very clearly see the odds of winning on each type of play.  None of them are MORE LIKELY to pay you than they are to NOT pay you.  That's literally the definition of favoring the house.  Whereas with the free hero boxes, they are literally more likely to give you a hero than they are to give you a dupe up to a certain point.  Gambling in casinos where they have carefully crafted the odds specifically to take your money because that is their business, yes, always favors the house.  Nobody has ever tried to argue that.  That isn't the same model for hero boxes (it is, however, the same model for fortune cards, which are a form of gambling that favors the house).  You calculate the cost of the heroes you want and the probability of getting those heroes from a random hero box at 175 splinters a piece.  If the value of the hero box is more than the cost of the hero, you buy the hero box.  If it's not, you don't.  That's how you know the odds aren't always in the house's favor.  Luckily, in lieu of having to write all this out by hand, /u/zeCrazyEye made a Google spreadsheet that will take your information and calculate this for you.  I trust that you are a capable and intelligent human being, and can follow OP's story closely enough to emulate his odds with this spreadsheet.  When you do, you will see that he had an overwhelming chance (upwards of 88%) of getting a new hero.  Assuming we're going with ""getting a new hero"" as a win, then I just don't understand how you can possibly think having an 88% chance of the player winning favors the house."

What it means is if you're farming and it isn't the time they're going to let one spawn, you have a 0% chance of seeing one drop, where as if someone is on at the unspecificed time and kills 1 mob at the right millisecond, they'll get it.   The contest is running until the end of the month and the goal is to get more people playing the game, theres no way they would let it be completely random and potentially have all 5 tickets found the first day or two.

He was said to be a 200ES hero back in 2014 but he's not officially announced. So, a lot of people just assume he's already confirmed (when he's not technically) or that he'll be outside of any advanced pack and so they don't waste a slot on him. When they were doing these types of polls 1-2 years ago Beast would pretty much always win which is how the rumblings about him being playable started. In fact, I'm not sure if this poll is one of them, but he was actually removed from a lot of these ""pick a playable"" type polls and is only recently being allowed back in.

It's become something of a Marvel trope for Reed Richards, Tony Stark and Hank Pym, who never seem to learn their lesson time and time again.  Beast was supposed to be different.  He's a genius tempered by compassion, wisdom and a passion for both the sciences and the arts.  He's a sage and a scholar, not a mad scientist.  The way they shoehorned him in as a plot device to kick off the New X-Men events is outright rage-worthy."
marvelheroes,3cjth3,axelnight,2,Wed Jul 8 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"I agree that recent comics are not helping Beast too much but right now Marvel seems to be in one of its ""hey let's knock all the smart heroes down a peg by doing one of those storylines where they listen to their head instead of their heart."" They did the same thing with Iron Man/Reed in Civil War, basically turning them into monsters, and now they're doing it again with the Illuminati (and doubled down on Beast with having him bring the Original Five back).  Nothing against Magik. I like Magik too and hope she gets into the game. I do think that beyond how a hero plays (and I've seen some really cool design ideas for Beast that would set him apart from other ""punch"" heroes in the game), history and status should be taken into account. I just think it's a shame that an original five X-Man and probably the biggest non-Wolverine crossover mutant (as in, the closest mutant to the Avengers/human heroes in terms of storylines/relationships over the years)  is losing out to say, Dazzler and Jubilee who have honestly never played an important role in just about any Marvel storyline.   If you go down the road of ""just cool to play"" you can go down into the C- and D-list heroes (mutants especially) for all kinds of really weird and cool abilities. Hell, I'd love to play as Tempus, but I also acknowledge that there's a billion more deserving and important heroes not in the game yet.   Then again, one of the things I like about this particular poll is you don't have to choose! I voted for Beast AND Magik because you get 12 slots :)"
marvelheroes,3cjth3,jmarFTL,2,Wed Jul 8 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"The reason Beast is low on this particular poll is because he wasn't included from the start. OP considered him confirmed and wasn't counting votes for Beast and then when more news came out about Beast not being confirmed, he gave Beast some free votes and let people vote on Beast. In the last round of voting on that poll Beast had the most votes, and even if he averaged less than that from the beginning he would easily be top 10, so I wouldn't consider it an accurate assessment of where Beast stands."

By making a distinction they are clearly outlining that they do care more of certain players than of others. How they couldnt predict the PR backlash of their decision is beyond me.  I couldnt possibly care less about what the prize is, or even if I win it or not. Its the How, not the What. As someone from a country that is not eligible, and yet who has spent a fair amount of money in this game, I feel like Gaz doesnt value me the same as someone from a country that is eligible....even funnier, perhaps someone who hasnt spent (nor ever will) a red cent.  As a customer I dont demand much. Actually, all I demand is being treated fairly and equally as the rest. period. Its a matter of respect. And apparently Gaz doesnt respect me.  Needless to say, from now on Gaz dropped off my list of companies eligible to get my money. Not as a ""punishment"", but as a matter of principle.   Im not by any means a whale so they probably wont even notice the dip in profits, but I religiously dropped 20 bucks every month I played in the same manner I would for a subscription game, half the time without actually having anything in mind to spend them on, more like as a ""thank you, I support your work, keep at it"" for making a great game I enjoyed.

marvelheroes,3chk6l,eccentrickd,6,Wed Jul 8 09:15:35 2015 UTC,"He can grow or shrink himself, or most anything he wants really. In the comics that is. Given enough prep time I think. Hank Pym had a tiny lab. A prison.  It was too dangerous to change size for a bit, so he had tiny gear in his pockets he could restore to it's original size. Like weapons or tools. As Yellowjacket his gloves could issue bioelectric blasts similar to Wasp's. He can communicate with ants telepathically as well as control them. I've seen him make the ants large but avoids it. They freak out understandably. I know I would. Pym particles are the source of his powers. His invention. Pym was always underestimated. It comes of cheesy somehow, and he isn't cool like Thor... but Ant-man is probably one of the most dangerous people on Earth in Marvel Comics. When you are not taken as a true threat you are automatically more dangerous. Oh and he actually created Ultron. Not Stark. Also If all the ants on the planet suddenly grew to the size of a people.... we would be in a world of shit. I'm pretty sure they will rule the world one day in the distant (hopefully) future. You may want to keep an eye on them anyway. By the way, I am pretty stoked for Ant-man. :)"
marvelheroes,3chk6l,MutatedSpleen,4,Wed Jul 8 02:32:22 2015 UTC,"If all the ants grew to the size of people, I'm just guessing here, but I'm thinking it would probably cover the surface of the planet.  There are an estimated 100,000,000,000,000 (one hundred trillion) ants on the planet, compared to some 7.5 billion humans.  I'm pretty sure 100 trillion people-sized ants would cover the face of the globe.  At the very least, there would be insurmountable environmental damage and the planet would go extinct in a matter of hours."
marvelheroes,3chk6l,ElectricZee,2,Wed Jul 8 06:03:41 2015 UTC,"If we are going to all die, I think I would rather have the world overrun by ants than by Ultron."
marvelheroes,3chk6l,GrapeMousse,2,Wed Jul 8 06:20:03 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but the ants would suffocate in a matter of minutes because their trachea (Their means of oxygen uptake through their exoskeleton) aren't effective enough to supply a body much larger than the one insects have right now with the current amount of oxygen in the current atmosphere."
marvelheroes,3chk6l,droid327,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:52:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe you can assume that the Pym Particles increase the size of the atoms constructing the ants, rather than creating new atoms, and also increase and decrease the size of any gases they respire.    Giant oxygen atoms could diffuse much faster through a giant ant's giant coelom :)"
marvelheroes,3chk6l,droid327,2,Thu Jul 9 13:29:28 2015 UTC,"Earth's land surface is about 1.6 x 1015 square feet.  If each person-sized ant was, say, 6 feet long and 3 feet wide (about person-sized), that'd be 18 square feet * 1014 (ie 100 trillion) = 1.8 x 1015, so yeah it'd be just about enough to completely cover the surface of Earth with giant ants.    Namor would be cool, though.  A couple interesting side calculations...the total weight of all those person-sized ants would be 8.2 trillion lb, about 8x the weight of all humans combined.  Ants don't have the metabolic requirements of humans, so even at person-sized they probably would consume less environmental resources than the humans.  But assuming a conservative ratio of 1000 workers per queen, and the ability to lay, say, 1000 viable eggs per day per queen, the Earth wouldn't be able to support a second generation of ants, which would only take about a month.  At that point, the efficient-scavenging ants likely would have consumed all macroscopic biomass on the entire land surface of Earth, turned to cannibalism, and then gradually starved to extinction.  Everything else would likely go extinct as well in the ensuing ecosystem collapse.  All that would be left would be any plants that maintained a long-lived seed bank in the soil, and perhaps some small invertebrates and vertebrates that could survive on scavenging giant ant carcasses until the plants grew back."

marvelheroes,3ciofq,hobesmart,3,Wed Jul 8 05:23:53 2015 UTC,"Basically if you have guaranteed crit/brutes on certain powers, then yes, brute damage and crit damage should be valued a bit more than usual because you don't need to worry about rating for those powers, so you can just stack damage.  That being said, the ol 1-2-3 is just one power in his rotation, the rest of his powers don't have that guarantee so you still need crit/brut rating.  Generally speaking I believe min-maxers have found that ultimate nullfiier only starts being worth it when both crit and brut chance are above 55%. And keep in mind, they have to be there WITHOUT help from gungnir or another legendary.  So if anything, I'd just say that because you have a power with guaranteed crit/brute, those target percentages would just be a bit lower on Thing because for at least some of his rotation you don't have to worry about them at all. How much lower, I can't say, but given that it's just one power, I wouldn't say it would be dramatically lower."
marvelheroes,3ciofq,jmarFTL,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:47:07 2015 UTC,"It's all based on your stats, you can refund the 70 legendaries for little to no cost so I suggest testing it. See the base damage increase from nullifier's Brit damage multiplied by your effective brut chance (crit*brut%) factoring in guaranteed crits/brutes with that power and do the same with gungnir. Ultimately the math would be pretty complex (since nullifier/gungnir boost that power more than other powers) and you're best off attacking the high hp dummy for general results."
marvelheroes,3ciofq,SupaTrooper,-2,Wed Jul 8 06:37:50 2015 UTC,You have to remember that your crits affect your brutes. So boosting your Crit in turn gives you better chances of brutes. If somehow your are around 50-55% crit maybe Nullifier would be a better option. However I didnt do the math myself.

marvelheroes,3cgk2l,MutatedSpleen,6,Wed Jul 8 06:45:30 2015 UTC,"So, the way this works (according to some dev post way back in the day) is as follows:  When you get the box (via whatever means), the hero table is pre-determined.  That means that you can only get the heroes that are in the game right now.  If you wait six months and open it, you will still only be able to get the heroes who are on that table - the heroes that are in the game now.  The ACTUAL hero isn't determined until you open the box (this has been confirmed via people opening the same box in live vs. on TC and getting different heroes).  So...open it now, basically."

marvelheroes,3cg7qp,emdeemcd,6,Tue Jul 7 17:46:27 2015 UTC,"Last I heard, for active: put at least 1 point in everything cept away powers, then do what you want."
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,Ishakaru,5,Tue Jul 7 17:49:43 2015 UTC,This is what I do for most of my TUs. There are however a couple that you want to intentionally not pick up some specials for because they will throw off the rotation for their other specials or Maybe you wanna focus on Single target so you wouldn't want to waste the time on AoE moves. Speccing Falcon for raids is a good example. It's all about that C4 and Dash bleeds. His AoEs will actually lower your DPS simply by having 1 point in them.
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,NullRage,-1,Wed Jul 8 00:24:04 2015 UTC,I'd personally recommend putting 1 point in the away proccs just in case your TU dies and you have to wait to resummon.  That way you still get something out of the teamup while you wait.
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,ManchurianCandycane,4,Wed Jul 8 09:50:37 2015 UTC,"It's ultimately up to you, and how you want them to work.  If you're looking for min-max, there's this thread kicking around that lists TTKs for team-ups and provides specs for them."
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,Uhgii,4,Tue Jul 7 17:52:11 2015 UTC,Here is my question that no one seems to care about. How come it takes so damn long to level up a team up? I leveled a hero to 60. Then bought a legendary and leveled that up and he still wasn't at 60. Seems very broken to me.
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,easypeasy6,2,Wed Jul 8 05:17:13 2015 UTC,"I have wondered the same thing.   I've got Wasp and Iron Man stuck in the 50's. I ran twenty cosmic LQ's with Iron Man and he didn't level up.   I am sure Deadpool is behind this, somehow...."
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,ElectricZee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:27:50 2015 UTC,"The reason no one cares about it because it's a new player issue. With rough math, cosmic prestige allows you to level something like 8 team ups from 1-60. I went on an Omega point grinding spree and leveled like 4-5 to 60. Several times I completely forgot about the team up and ""over leveled"" it.  So my suggestion: 1) Unlock and level up new heroes. Get that 200% xp synergy. 2) Get your omega's to at least 5k."
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,Ishakaru,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"I have all but 3 heros at 60. I have 200% xp. My omegas are at 7500. Not going to grind out team ups if I have nothing else to gain from it. Except maybe the 1,000,000 orb picked up achievement haha"
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,easypeasy6,-1,Wed Jul 8 14:39:23 2015 UTC,"I knew this was going to be your response. Sorry, since this is the internet, I'm going to have to assume you may be stretching the truth. Especially since I find leveling them up to be easy at a mere 5.2k omega and all but 5-6 heroes at 60.   My in game name is the same as the name here on reddit if you would like to verify my noobness."
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,Ishakaru,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:54:57 2015 UTC,I'm not stretching the truth. I've been playing the game since beta and have over 2000 hours. You can believe what you want. Also I wouldn't have admitted to having the same in game name as your name on here for if they find something you said on the forums they didn't like they would see your comment to easily ban you. Not saying you've done anything wrong. Just a heads up
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,easypeasy6,5,Wed Jul 8 23:56:27 2015 UTC,"Depends on each team up character.  For ones like wasp that you will use as always away on movement power heavy characters, only 15 point the moves that go into the 'when away passives' and then dump points into the when away passive. No other move is worth 1 pointing since you'll never summon her.  On ones you are going to use out 'always' like Magik or Clea due to their buffs, you'll want to 1 point everything that isn't a 'when away' passive, and max out the most important abilities.  On characters that you are going to use as assists (like Deadpool, etc.) that deal more damage and don't have huge buffs, you will want to 15 point their 'when away' abilities that go into the when away passive, 1 point the when away passives, and dump the rest of your powers into their highest damage powers, 1 pointing any type of utilities they have."
marvelheroes,3cg7qp,theswerto,2,Tue Jul 7 20:27:36 2015 UTC,"I put at least one point in everything, as it's more useful to have a skill available than it is to have a minor damage upgrade to another skill.  It's always a DPS increase for a team-up to do a power instead of a basic attack.  I put at least one point into the away skills as well (even though I use my team-ups on active),  just in case they get defeated, I still get some benefit from them.  Otherwise, I keep my points pretty equal over my various skills, unless there is something I just don't care about (like someone with a slow proc...no thanks, one point)."

Why not put ""Currently equipped"" above the item card, in a bright colored box so you don't need to deal with it, and make it easier to quickly compare Also just put the rune image next to the rune text in a small image.

marvelheroes,3cdeui,urbn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"The problem with that, or with just highlighting the border is that new users wouldn't know right away which color meant what.  Also the game likes to change equipped and non-equipped items positions based on your mouse position (sometimes equipped is on the left, sometimes right) so it might not be as obvious right away."

marvelheroes,3cdeui,andu90,4,Tue Jul 7 03:39:06 2015 UTC,"% remain the same, so lets say you have a crit damage rating on an item that is 1000 out of a possible 1100, that's a 90% roll, upgrading it will keep it at a 90% roll. But either way, this should be in game, easier way to compare an item, and tell you what % on a roll you've got on an item."
marvelheroes,3cdeui,claymier2,4,Tue Jul 7 03:58:00 2015 UTC,"I'd like that, or a D3 style comparison of the loss/ gain in DPS and survivability."
marvelheroes,3cdeui,Rhodair,2,Tue Jul 7 13:37:30 2015 UTC,"I really like that feature in D3, but it wouldn't work well with MH items and all the +power attributes.  There's no good way to know how someone plays.  Some powers could be used just to keep a debuff applied while another player may constantly use it.  What about random procs or different damage types?  Would the player need more burst damage for patrol areas or sustained damage for raids?  Would it take spirit into consideration?  It's an easier calculation for D3 because it applies that same gain to all powers where this game has different damage ratings and different players could value a stat like vs. unaware targets differently.  I should also note it doesn't even work 100% in D3 such as items that give you x% to lightning damage doesn't calculate properly."

It doesn't seem like something they want to do. I would love it, though, and it doesn't even need to be for identical items. For different items, the comparison could be shown for affixes that are on both items, and then for affixes that aren't the same, the ones on the equipped item could be shown in red text to indicate they will be lost while the affixes on the inventory item could be shown in green to show they'd be gained."

Like if something were close to max but not completely it would say like 88% of total max somewhere on the item card.

marvelheroes,3cge5l,Deakul,7,Fri Jul 10 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"What keeps me away from a DC version of this game is that Marvel has WAY MORE distinguished characters than DC. You ask someone unfamiliar with Marvel ""who's your favorite Marvel character?"" They could say anything from Spider-Man, Wolverine, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Cap, Groot. Ask the same thing about DC? 99% of the time its Superman or Batman. DC relies too heavily on two titular characters."
marvelheroes,3cge5l,SplendidRS,4,Tue Jul 7 23:13:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I disagree. Yes a lot of people would say Batman/Superman, but that's to be expected - they are the most well known heroes out there from any publisher.  But you're forgetting the casts of Flash/Arrow, both are very popular shows. Most people would know the titular characters, if not the supporting ones.  Wonder Woman / Aquaman are also distinguished.  With the new movies (BvS, Suicide Squad) and TV shows (Legends, Supergirl), there will definitely be a greater awareness of DC characters."
marvelheroes,3cge5l,Jagxyz,2,Wed Jul 8 03:50:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is really the biggest issue and its being addressed.  In addition to this point, DC doesn't have to be pigeonholed into using ONLY heroes (or villians who have been heroic in the past), they could launch with villians in their playable roster and really add a lot to their game.  Don't forget Justice League Dark, Static Shock, and the Teen Titans bb."

All these heroes have viable movesets, and Huntress was even playable in the Justice League Heroes game.  Oh, and there's also Lobo...can't forget Lobo."

marvelheroes,3cge5l,wellingtonbear,2,Tue Jul 7 18:47:40 2015 UTC,I don't think they can make it work really.  DC is a company dominated by Batman.  Everything they make has to be largely dedicated to him and his enemies.  They don't know how to make a game and just have Batman as one more character.
marvelheroes,3cge5l,dorn3,2,Tue Jul 7 22:42:16 2015 UTC,"To add to your point, Batman is so very much depending on Gothams dark and twisty nature that I cant really see him in a game like Marvel Heroes and not feel weird. Even in Justice League he always seemed a bit out of place to me."

You are right that companies do cash giveaways all the time, but I wonder why a game company would feel the need to do a cash giveaway.  If they want people to log in more, why not do some other kind of a giveaway.  ""For a limited time, boss uniques drop from anywhere in the game."" or ""For this week only, hero tokens can drop!""  I'm not sure where something like this can lead to.  Maybe it'll be a one time thing.

The chance of getting one is so infinitesimally small that nobody has a realistic chance of getting them. They're giving out 5 over a period of 3 weeks. Among ALL people playing. You know how insanely small of a chance that is?  It's like saying ""I'm gonna go grind out some costume drops"" or ""I'm gonna go grind out a Zod rune."" It's not like a GoK where you can run the same terminal over and over and eventually you'll probably get one. The chance is so small that it's in essence just a surprise.  They could just drop all the usernames into a hat and do it that way, but this is a bit more fun. People will be looking for it and linking it in chat.

But, I just don't see this as something reasonably worth a very strong effort. Kinda like those twitch/twitter contests. After so many other contestants, and so few prizes, it isn't very reasonable to try so hard.  I like the big numbers (5x$5,000), but I can't help but to wonder if smaller could've been better (~25x$1,000, 50x$500, 500x$50, similar).

So much of power leveling is blitzing through terminal LQs, and the bosses are what will slow you down. While leveling recently, I noticed a huge cut in my terminal time as soon as I hit 30 and could max that node. Other than that, the key will be to do whatever nodes will maximize your character's DPS (balanced with survivability if you need it). Choose those over the ones that give you bonus xp, because you'll get more benefits from killing things quicker than the tiny xp boosts. Warpath is good for most people (+Fighting). Hopefully that's helpful?"

The other school of thought is to spend Omegas on nodes that help you kill stuff faster and run Legendary Quests better.  These would include extra boss damage or elemental / base damage, +crit/+brut type nodes.  Personally, I think you can get enough XP gains with mole man medal, pet, costume core with +int and seer rune word that you can focus more on the killing stuff faster nodes."
marvelheroes,3ce1t7,bushmaster2000,3,Tue Jul 7 11:15:51 2015 UTC,"The first school of thought is entirely wrong :P    Point for point, % XP nodes (through Int) are never going to be as good as % DPS nodes.  Killing 10% more mobs per unit time is just as good as getting 10% more XP per mob.  And +XP on Kill gives you entirely negligible amounts even if you stack it to the sky."
marvelheroes,3ce1t7,droid327,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:43:59 2015 UTC,"Technically I agree with the second school of thought...except under a very specific condition: if you're not using your omegas and are 1 shotting almost everything (except boss) you'll get better return with a few intel nodes early on. Characters like SW or nuke heavy chars who have a levelled legendary will be able to take intel omega nodes (after getting the spin tech node) up to around lvl 45-ish. Then they'll have to go full damage if they wanna keep their massacre efficiency. ....  That's only true for prestiging though...because no legendary.

marvelheroes,3ce1t7,weltschmerz79,2,Tue Jul 7 07:52:48 2015 UTC,"10 in Nanotech and 5 in Warpath are universal for every character. Most characters will go 9-10 in Warpath once they have a ton of omega points.  After that, spread the love on omegas that improve your Crit/Brut Damage and your character's damage of choice.  As these folks said, don't bother with the EXP omegas. Very few people are Omega capped, if even a single EXP omega was good and useful 90% of us would be using it.  Synergies: Cyclops is amazing at 10% EXP. Go for the damage type ones and the Crit/Brut Chance ones. Crit Damage ones aren't as good as straight damage ones."
marvelheroes,3ce1t7,-BeeDub-,2,Tue Jul 7 09:22:24 2015 UTC,For me Spirit is the biggest problem while leveling.  Some people overlook the fact that Strength/Energy give reduced spirit cost of Physical/Energy and Mental.  So if I play a new person I always try to max out Strength/Energy which not only gives me more damage but less spirit issues as well.  I also use the Arcane Attunement node to increase my spirit by 40 for qol and SpinTech of course since bosses take the longest to kill and so will slow you down the most. Then if you have extra points put it in Warpath.

Other than that you just want whatever gives you the most damage...so Cable, GR/MK/SL, Wolvie for crit and brut, then Loki+Iceman if you're ranged with Night Night node.  Rogue is a big help for spirit sustain too, especially for lower-level heroes.  I'd say the biggest factor in fast leveling for new heroes, though, is artifacts - having some good midlevel artifacts for DPS and spirit sustain makes a huge difference in how fast and effectively you can level"

marvelheroes,3chmg3,VictorVonCuddles,2,Wed Jul 8 01:34:27 2015 UTC,He'll probably start a poll for Advanced Pack 4 right after.
marvelheroes,3chmg3,TheImaginaryPoster,2,Wed Jul 8 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"Lets hope my worst fears don't come true. Am I the only one that finds it unnecessary for such a thing to be up for soooo long? Gees run it for a month and shut it down. He constantly tries to breathe new life into a bland played out idea by rebranding it ""Omg vote for the special Cinco De Maya Adv Pack III poll."" It comes off as insanely desperate. Also as has been pointed out like 2 million times the poll literally means nothing. Just because someone comes in 1st or 7th or anywhere in the top 10 doesn't guarantee they will be in the game in any advance pack let alone ever. See each character made playable has to go through approval from Marvel first. Don't know who is number one atm (also don't care) but Marvel could instantly reject whoever that is because they feel like it."

marvelheroes,3cdvb8,TwistedMadness,4,Tue Jul 7 03:44:39 2015 UTC,Yeah you either use atlantis for damage or lemuria for survivability (with the exception of +spirit one for IM and i think Juggy as well).

marvelheroes,3cdvb8,darin617,8,Tue Jul 7 12:17:34 2015 UTC,I have asked the same question with no solid response either. They need to rework the relics so 90% of them are not worthless to use.
marvelheroes,3cdvb8,Xtulu,6,Tue Jul 7 04:03:46 2015 UTC,This guy Wilfrid has a great YouTube video on relics.  It covers all you need to know.  His channel rocks!
marvelheroes,3cdvb8,gertymoon,2,Tue Jul 7 08:04:02 2015 UTC,"This guy rocks, plain and simple, to put that much time and dedication in his videos where they're almost like educational lectures is just amazing.  I simply like watching them just to learn more about the game.  More people need to check his channel out, I'm sure he appreciates the hits."
marvelheroes,3cdvb8,Stelcio,5,Tue Jul 7 21:14:13 2015 UTC,Relics need some serious rebalance. The specific damage ones SHOULD be better than the universal ones and the defensive ones should be more or less equally desirable.
marvelheroes,3cdvb8,NullRage,4,Tue Jul 7 04:24:23 2015 UTC,"Currently This is your best option:  All Heroes:  Atlantis for DPS (TTK)  or  Subteranea for Defense (TTL)    There are of course exceptions to every rule.   ""Pet Classes"" Use ARMOR instead of Atlantis  Iron Man and Juggernaut can both make great use of Giborim.  Nova Can use Turn movement speed (Snakeroot) into dmg rating. Still not worth it over Atlantis IMO  Juggy can also turn Tenacity (Skrillex) into Crit Rating. Giborim still better IMO.  Lemuria is useful for heroes that can't easily get LoH from other sources, or as a swap out for high damage fights like Sentinels in AXIS raid.     Using anything other than the above is done only because you don't want to spend the resources to unbind relics from one character to give them to the one your playing at the time. Oh...or PvP...I've heard that apparently dmg rating is worth more than crit damage in PvP due to your crit dmg total getting cut in half upon entering, But I don't really have much first hand knowledge on that. There seems to be a lot of non-transparency surrounding PvP that makes it difficult to properly gear for or enjoy it IMO."
marvelheroes,3cdvb8,droid327,3,Tue Jul 7 06:37:10 2015 UTC,Skrullos is the Tenacity relic.  Skrillex is a skinny white dude with a weird haircut :P

Lemurias for survival, aka sentinel fight in axis.  That being said, because I dont have enough stacks of Atlantis, I use Xandar on SW, Asgard on Hulk, etc. Play to their strengths."
marvelheroes,3cdvb8,urbn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:19:27 2015 UTC,Look at the marvel build site for each specific character.  Look at the top rated build.  Use the runes that they use for the character.

marvelheroes,3cdvb8,droid327,0,Tue Jul 7 05:06:13 2015 UTC,"I use Snakeroot on my SW, but that's admittedly a tradeoff just because I like to use Chaos Warp and its a lot faster, naturally, with the extra movement speed.

This was over more than one day, so it wasn't a ""you didn't log out and back in"" thing.  Sometimes, some bosses just don't count.    But I never had problems with as many people as you're having problems with.  Is it possible that you're not in a green terminal, but are doing it in story mode by accident ?  I can't think of anything else.  I got my Crimefighter just this weekend.  But, I had already had all the green term stuff done before this patch.  On Saturday, I did Living Laser, Lady Deathstrike, Blob, and Grim Reaper on cosmic, and they all counted.    I hope you get it working, man.  I feel your pain."

marvelheroes,3caoax,Voykid,3,Mon Jul 6 12:39:51 2015 UTC,"To be blunt, gambit will be about as squishy as psylocke...but will be hitting for about 500k to 750k on brute strikes once decebtly geared.  For the spirit management,I had a hard time  until I had my cosmic control rod leveled and put some points in guilt suppression ( honestly I dont remember but I put about 250 omegas in spirit stuff). Also I think the power doop runeword would help with spirit issues.  Artefact to use: gem of kursed, advanced metasensory array, mags t-shirt, hulkbuster thingy package (?).  Unique wise: coat of the red skull or kiss of the viper I guess.  The cores are fairly rare but when you play a lot of raids, cmm, cosmic terms you might come accross some. Otherwise you'll have to trade for it.  The relevence of this information depends on how you're building him (Range, melee, or hybrid). I don't know anything about his melee build, I havent used it since before his rework. Nowadays I'm full range"
marvelheroes,3caoax,Mandroll,2,Mon Jul 6 13:00:30 2015 UTC,Squishy you say? My Gambit tanking 100 stacks on sentinels AXIS fight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwxkqygKY0U  Gambit is very tanky once you've built and geared him correctly. I didn't even bother to use Kiss of the Viper or Lemuria stacks for that video. It was in full DPS gear.
marvelheroes,3caoax,C_L_I_C_K,0,Mon Jul 6 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"Thing is, OP is new. I dont think he'll have that much gear stacked around. So meh, he'll prollu get 1 shotted in CMM if he can't dodge...but he should be hitting for an easy 600k per attack"
marvelheroes,3caoax,Mandroll,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:26:54 2015 UTC,"If he (or anyone for that matter) wants to fully gear out any hero, he can within a month. With the addition of rewards for achievements, anyone can obtain top tier gear as long as they're willing to farm / grind for it. Well, everything except ILAS and UEB but those are also obtainable via trading or farming Ultron a lot and Gambit doesn't need those artifacts.  As for getting 1-shotted, most heroes and players get 1-shotted in cosmic patrols if they don't actively dodge the big hitting moves. Even the most geared and tanky heroes / players die in cosmic patrols. Gambit survives fine in cosmic patrols as long as you gear him up and lay down Street Sweep constantly, while dodging the 1-shots."
marvelheroes,3caoax,C_L_I_C_K,-1,Mon Jul 6 23:38:05 2015 UTC,"Again, you're missing my point. It's this; unlike heroes like Nightcrawler, Ms Marvel, Iron Man (this one is semi debatable), Cyclops or winter soldier, gambit has some strong damage output. So much so that with only his ranged uniques, some budget artefacts with blessings on and a Cosmic control rod he'll be able to run CMM and actually do good damage. His major downfall is his signature...m like literally; use that at the wrong time and die. Like I know you're passionate about the hero but you don't know the OP. Maybe he wants a non-Fotm hero that is actually decent without being fully geared in 69 gear.(Yes 69 gear makes a huge damage difference, that's not the point.) The question the OP had was: how viable is he? The answer is very. How gear dependant is he: depending on what you want to run medium to high. How to deal with his spirit issues: depending on what you're farming, you won't have any. If you're running raids a lot though, spirit issues will need to be addressed. It'll depend on how many spirit omegas are available to you, what core is available... but honestly with a CCR, while spirit can get low, he won't run out much Until red.  Another thing I might as well adress is arcdevil's points... they're so 2014 they are irrelevent nowadays. The only one that CAN apply is the teleport point. But then, only for terminals and depending a lot on playstyle. As gambit, you can still speed run terms while rolling around...or switch the zitg in and out to get there...  The only difference in our comments is: I'm assuming the OP is starting out and casual. You're assuming he knows the ins and out of the game and will mass farm gear within a month( yeah its not that hard but he might not even need it for the content he's running and therefore; not feel the need to farm it).   Both are good answers; yours would be perfect for a player like me (founder represent) who wanted to do axis on gambit... mine is just more general..."
marvelheroes,3caoax,Mandroll,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"Ms Marvel   Not true anymore, MsM really is a beast right now with her new uniques. Super tanky and pretty damn good damage, not top tier yet but definitely in the top 20 I think"

If you are lagging, have particle display issues or have enemy mobs that simply dont appear on your screen you still will get 1 shotted. All in all, ranged build only adds survivability because you're away from enemies. You'll still need that trigger finger to roll out of enemy attacks...but you WILL have a bit longer to dodge it"

marvelheroes,3caoax,Zurtard,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:29:08 2015 UTC,"Gambit is a very fun and smooth hero to play. He is able to do all end-game content effectively... as long as you're very well geared. His sustained DPS lags behind most of the roster mainly due to the fact that his signature skill is on a 52 second cooldown and his spenders (Dead Man's Hand & Bo Beatdown) don't output as much damage as the newly reviewed / released heroes. Here's my guide on how to build your Gambit for end-game activities: http://marvelheroes.info/build/19568/  Gambit will need a QoL to increase his damage and rework some of his skills. His sig has to be changed. His ult should be his new sig on a 40 second cooldown. He needs a new ult. House of Cards should be a ranged skill, since it's in his ranged tree. Dead Man's Hand and Bo Beatdown needs to have their values increased. If Gaz do can all of these things, Gambit will become a top tier hero he once used to be.  I've seen a lot of people here mention that Gambit has spirit issues. Leveling up, that may be true, but you can easily solve his spirit problems by using Scrolls of Pama (lvl 18), Ringed Ruby of Raggadorr (lvl 23), and/or Mark of Odinborn (lvl 32) artifacts. M'Kraan legendary, stack of Relic of Gibborim, and River of the Soul runeword will further help with his spirit. Using any of these items will allow you to spam as much as you want with Gambit (or any other hero) without worrying about spirit. When you're geared at level 60, Gambit has 0 spirit management issues.  Anyway, I recommend Gambit to any player who loves the hero and is willing to dump a lot of time and effort into gearing him correctly. If you're not able or willing to go all out in gearing him, there are many other heroes that outshine Gambit with much less gear requirements.   P.S. Here's a highlight of DegenTP and his SG doing an all-Gambit AXIS raid a week ago: http://www.twitch.tv/degentp/v/6939291  We were able to beat Sentinels on the first try, but took us 4 tries to beat Onslaught. Most of the players did not play Gambit prior to that raid and only 2 of us had level 20 ultimates. 4 people were using melee / hybrid Gambit, which I highly don't recommend using. Here are some screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/n2UsT#0"
marvelheroes,3caoax,Mandroll,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:55:07 2015 UTC,"Click, I applaud your enthusiasm for Gambit and I think it's awesome when people put the time and effort into maining heroes with some problems.      I'm curious why you down voted my previous post when I said I enjoy him but you're at a disadvantage when you agree here.  You also agree his sig has to be changed.  The 52 second CD is excessive and manual targeting while being rooted is crazy (Damage negation on TC before launch was removed for some reason).     TLDR: You can do endgame content with any very well geared hero if you love the play style and character.  OP only asked how gear dependent Gambit is and your answer is very to be effective."

Of all the heroes the OP listed NC is closest one to being top notch but still requires a lot of gearing. In this example, gambit would probably output a lot more for a while"

Gambit scores a quadruple whammy:   bad resource management no teleport his supposedly strong build is melee. only a handful meleers perform well nowadays. Hulk, Venom, Cap, Jugg, Thing. dodge hero. That alone is enough to disqualify him for anything and everything endgame-related in this game. dodge has been utterly trash for almost the entire game's lifespawn and there's no signs of that changing in the close or mid future   I'd love to tell you to wait for better times, but being brutally honest, that times are likely waaaaaay off or they might not even come.

I'm the one being truthful and giving out accurate information. Gambit's DPS is lacking, but none of the negatives you listed are remotely true.

marvelheroes,3caoax,TheLordBear,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:48:08 2015 UTC,NC is similar to Gambit in a lot of ways but with a sweet Teleport.  I used to main Gambit Hybrid and then mained NC.  I can safely say both are fairly underpowered and spirit management is rough with NC.     Not that that's bad it just requires much work input to get the same output as say Captain America with uniques you pick up off the ground.

marvelheroes,3cc8fm,meowmixjinx,9,Mon Jul 6 19:56:40 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that a lot of ttk's posted are cherry picked ""god runs"", often having a particularly long run of crit/brutals.  As far what TTK you should be getting, that's entirely based on your hero/build/omega, so you'd obviously have to share that to compare. Some characters scales better than others with omegas, so it doesn't just add a constant TTK boost that's the same for every character."
marvelheroes,3cc8fm,Deeviant,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:03:53 2015 UTC,"If you have all 69 gear with good rolls and the like, then you can expect your dps to increase roughly 30-40% with omegas. The biggest misconception in this game is that omegas double your damage, which is completely untrue because the gains are linear. They are definitely a significant source of power, but gear and gear upgrades will be a bigger gain, since you get a ton of ranks (+1 all or to a tree, and +2 to individual skills at ilvl 69 per piece of gear) and roughly +18% to all of the stats on the gear.  I did a proc test on the high health dummy with She-Hulk where my only omegas were dazzler and Xerogenesis, and they didn't proc very often. Dazzler uptime was maybe 15-17%, Xerogenesis was somewhat better at 20 or 30% I think. Even though that's not no omegas, it's pretty close and I got a time of around 6 minutes. My usual average ttk on the high health dummy is around 4:45. So that's roughly a 30% increase.  I really wish people would shut up when they say, ""OMEGAS DOUBLE YOUR DAMAGE"", when they really don't. To be fair, 30-40% dps boost is a significant increase."

The only guy who said something similar said this: ""In some cases you could come close to doubling your damage at max Omegas."" Come close to. He didn't say OMEGAS DOUBLE YOUR DAMAGE.   Oh, and people who already have max Omegas most likely already have full ilvl 69 gear. Well, unless they went full pay to win mode and grinded all Omegas in a week with boosts."
marvelheroes,3cc8fm,C_L_I_C_K,2,Tue Jul 7 01:57:20 2015 UTC,"The difference between 1k Omegas and 7500 Omegas is vast. In some cases you could come close to doubling your damage at max Omegas.  Someone with 1000 Omegas is spending almost half of those on Spin Tech. By the time you start to round 2.5 - 3k you are able to get a lot more variety of nodes. Maybe you can't max them all out (and I think you shouldn't, either) but by then you're actually able to drop points in most good nodes to make a difference."
marvelheroes,3cc8fm,Elzam,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"Fully geared, max Omega, top tier heroes are doing 20-30 TTKs on the low health dummy and 4-5 minute TTKs on high health dummy. High health dummy is the new measuring stick now. Most of the hardcore players / raiders don't bother with the lower health dummy anymore because it only measures burst damage and can easily be cheesed with certain Omega nodes, gear, low cooldown signatures, and brut farming.   If you have less than 1k Omegas, then getting around 1 minute TTK on low health dummy would be considered a very good time. Just know that you're not ready for AXIS raid with that low of Omegas. Well, you can do AXIS, but you'll be relying on the other 9 players to carry your low DPS. However, for most other content in this game, high Omegas are not required."
marvelheroes,3cc8fm,C_L_I_C_K,0,Mon Jul 6 20:47:09 2015 UTC,yeah ive run everything but axis so far. hence my trying to get into the 50s TTK range but i think im limited on omegas. i guess its just down to learning to farm omegas.
marvelheroes,3cc8fm,C_L_I_C_K,0,Mon Jul 6 21:02:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah just farm Omegas and you'll be fine. 50s TTK is very respectable for below 1k Omegas. You must be playing a top tier / overpowered hero to get that time, right? :p  The last 2 days of this event should be great for Omegas farming. Just pop as many XP boosts as you have and go to town on cosmic Taskmaster or Hood. It's a boring grind, but well worth it in the end."

marvelheroes,3cc8fm,mwmorph,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:33:53 2015 UTC,Well as someone in a similar boat it seems to add about 20-30 seconds but TTK on low health dummy is difficult anyways... due to the brutal farming people tend to do.

marvelheroes,3cc8fm,worriedgirl1796,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:39:47 2015 UTC,Yeah you really wanna start with a hero that isn't very omega dependant. Like my Doom will do 36s TTK while my Ironman will do 65s TTK. If i didnt have Doom at this point i would be cut out of 60% of the endgame content and sitting here waiting for weekly hero and prot commendation resets.
marvelheroes,3cc8fm,leshake,0,Tue Jul 7 06:39:00 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about doing your TTK with less than 7500 omegas. Actually don't worry about doing a TTK at all, but if that is your thing then your time will not be close to someone with 7500 omegas no matter what you do.   Worry about getting full ilvl 69 gear first. Then get your characters best in slot uniques with high rolls, then get best in slot artifacts with high rolls, fill out your omegas, and then your TTK will be what you see in the youtube videos."

You might've learned this genre is actually an ARPG which existed way longer. You might also have learned that Gaz's own CEO is David Brevik, who, you might've learned, was heavily involved in the first 2 Diablo games that basically started the genre. So yeah, you could've learned all that if only you asked the right question.  If you encountered any unfriendlyness towards you ingame and was offended in some way, may I suggest you never try the actual MOBA genre as it seems to be the breeding ground for true toxic players. Unless you're into stuff like that. I'm not judging."

Because from what I know, her most popular build is basically laying down three AOEs (Ravenous Binding, Beasts From Beyond, Chaos Rift) and then Hex Sphere as much as possible, which has its own charge system, and then Chaotic Hex as filler. Between refreshing AOEs and using Hex Sphere's charges, you have a lot of in-between time to regen."

You might never get a liz (barring the achievement one) the entire time you play this game if RNG is an ass to you and that's it because chances are you will likely never have 9-14 GOTKs to trade. That is terrifying.

Snapzu has limited registration to help avoid the burdens Voat is going through. So, both are at a crawl compared to where they could be. Sadly, I don't think it will come down to which is the best actually, because of the current crawl state. And this crawl state only serves to buy reddit time basically (also maintaining availability for the current users of course).  And of course, there's the official forums. I try to visit everything to a point. Only bad thing about the official forums is the risk of a ban from posting something which could be misconstrued (and of course from just being normally stupid/toxic). I have no idea, nor am I curious about, the specifics regarding bans there (#'s banned rightfully vs wrongfully), but the generally agreed upon lack of speed in dealing with such issues, and the lack of transparency involving the banning procedures (I know, they can't be 100% open, but still..). The official forums just seems too dangerous basically. I currently have no desire to tell any admin/mod to basically kiss my ass and that they're fucked in the head (after more basic measures are first taken of course), but if I ever felt the need, then I'd much rather do it from somewhere without worrying about possibly losing my account.   I love Gaz, but I prefer to treat them as I would a non-toking friend (will they rat/narc, give me shit, something else?), I'll be friendly, but no need to be open with them about everything, lol, if that makes sense. I guess where ever I could be at my most open w/o the least consequence of trouble, is where I'll find myself drawn. I strongly believe anything goes (except for physical threats, similar), so long as you're ready for the backlash :) Some users can just still be downright toxic (and that's where I do like the snapzu inv thing), and that's just where you need a good strong mod team (with better mod powers) to ban those fuckers. I also like mods that I can argue with, if it comes to that, without worrying about post removals and bans (not saying any push my buttons, just voicing what I'd personally like), and they can argue with me,, then when a new topic comes along, it's just that, a new topic which makes for the scenario of meeting again on the battlegrounds, except again for the very 1st time, lol.  Don't get me wrong, I can be friendly easily, but some fuckwads just need to be told they're fucked in the head sometimes.  Mobs are a fickle bunch. Good luck to all :)"

In other words, they don't really care about any of the drama, etc. So what happens when the people that DO care and DO create the content decide to leave? Well, someone new will probably step in to fill their spot and may or may not do the job as well as the former and/or people will follow the content creators to their new home.

marvelheroes,3ccb5y,avatarofshadow,4,Tue Jul 7 00:42:18 2015 UTC,"First off: fuck facebook.   2nd: quality>quantity.  To expand: Facebook generally sucks on so many levels. Privacy, consistency, shit at cross-platforming/apps, and general monopolization hurting competition. Could expand further but I think that's the gist of it. Either users don't mind, don't know better, and stay, or they eventually leave (if not harassed into hanging about bc of family/friends). Some people don't mind, and that's cool for them; they can have/keep it.   I myself don't care for it, just bc it feels off basically. We grow, and often enough go our separate ways for reasons. That's part of maturing. Things come and go. To hop back on fb and attempt to be ""friends"" with every single mf'ing person I've ever known and their grandmas? No thx. Maybe instead I keep separate groups? Great, would love playing that lotto with fb /s. Maybe I should just keep fewer friends? Kinda like I do already as contacts in my texting lists, and we don't really share shit so that when we are around each other we actually have things to talk about instead of digging through our phones trying to find stuff to talk about?   I guess maybe there's some good reasons for fb, damned if I can think of any w/o seemingly better alternatives atm though (still, not saying there isn't any at all, just hard pressed to think of any). It takes all kinds for all sorts in this world, and that's generally a good thing, meh ;P . But, since you mentioned it, why not start one? I personally wouldn't check it out, no offense to you, just not my thing. But, I'm sure many may :)  2nd part is self explanatory,,, in nearly every case except for give-aways/promotions.

marvelheroes,3cb04y,ConorMAX,4,Mon Jul 6 16:48:28 2015 UTC,Once they patch gifts in from 340 onward you'll get all the ones you haven't gotten yet at the same time.
marvelheroes,3cb04y,TentacleOni,3,Mon Jul 6 16:47:51 2015 UTC,"your next daily login reward is the cake which is in 6 days, after Day 340 you stop receiving a gift everyday. Hopefully in the future they will rework the login reward system, I personally think the layout is abit long winded by showing each individual day up to 340. I love the layout of the Guild Wars 2 login rewards, where it progresses on a monthly basis and on the last day of each month you get a choice of a couple nice in-game items.  Preview"
marvelheroes,3cb04y,Sikksens,8,Mon Jul 6 16:27:45 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what you're trying to say. Every time you login you advance the counter by 1. Some days over 340 you get no rewards, but the counter goes up."
marvelheroes,3cb04y,Edeen,4,Mon Jul 6 14:50:52 2015 UTC,He's saying he's over 340 and isn't getting squat.
marvelheroes,3cb04y,DurdensWrath,6,Mon Jul 6 15:25:41 2015 UTC,Which is something apparent if you look at the login rewards page...
marvelheroes,3cb04y,Edeen,4,Mon Jul 6 16:10:00 2015 UTC,Seems a bit odd to start at 340 though. I could see them get less frequent after 365 but 340 seems like an odd point.
marvelheroes,3cb04y,tarrach,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:36:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe it had to do with last month and all the other stuff going on, they didn't want to overload the system with those as well?  I'm at day 360 right now..."
marvelheroes,3cb04y,AJMickna2014,-2,Mon Jul 6 15:42:57 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat. Can they not just get an intern to do this task once a month. So disorganized.

marvelheroes,3cbwrk,SixSixTrample,7,Mon Jul 6 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"Wait, so what?  People always complain about the random boxes. They're an incredible deal unless you have a high percentage of the heroes.   The boxes cost what, 175? So 2x boxes is 350. Winter Soldier costs 400. So for 350 you got Winter Soldier + ultimate upgrade for Thing.   You're still ahead. Not as ahead as you theoretically could be, but still.   You have to have incredibly bad repeated bad luck for the boxes to not be worth it. If your third box was also a dupe (unlikely), you'd start to be behind, but if your fourth was a new 400ES or higher hero again, you'd jump out ahead and could absorb a ton more dupes before falling back into the red again. And the most likely scenario is that your third and fourth boxes will both be new heroes and you'll have saved a butt-ton of splinters.  Long story short, don't get discouraged. If you really want a specific hero, save up, but if you're just trying to expand your roster, random is 100% the way to go."

Nowadays the random boxes seem to have reigned their statistically suspicious bad luck results, so I guess they are fair value now, but really, at release they were nothing short of a not-so-veiled scam."

marvelheroes,3c79bc,Hoezell,2,Sun Jul 5 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"This.  I use a similar rotation. But as an opener I use the anti-force just so I have full odinforce. Might be a bit overkill but it works for me.  And if you have some spirit recovery artifact(Liz, zola...) you can drop Son of Odin. ( I read on the forums that it actualy lowers your DPS due to the long animation or something. )"

marvelheroes,3c79bc,_xenosynthesis,2,Sun Jul 5 20:36:34 2015 UTC,"Move Priority:  (When entering combat, cast Son of Odin first to then cast For Asgard! to follow with the rotation below.)  Cast Bring the Thunder for Vulnerability and to cease Odinforce decay. Use immediately before each Spinning Strike.  Use Spinning Strike immediately after each Bring the Thunder to take advantage of the enemy's Vulnerability debuff.  Use Rolling Thunder after each Spinning Strike.  Use Son of Odin ideally while standing in Bring the Thunder's AoE.  Use For Asgard! before you cast The Anti-Force the first time after entering combat, after that cast it when your signature is only a couple of seconds away from coming off of cooldown.  Keep Spinning Strike, Son of Odin and The Anti-Force on CD.  Spam Thundering Strike.  Alternatively, you can use Asgardian Smite to pull, but I mostly use it on trash.  (Thor is my main, he will never fail me. Praise be Thor.)  EDIT: I realize I am a couple days late to help, but I don't approve of the suggestions that were already given. Thundering Strike is a much better Spirit spender than Hammer Smash, Asgardian Smite is kind of clumsy. Spinning Strike is the one of the strongest attacks you have (second only to your signature, The Anti-Force), so there is no reason at all NOT to use it."

Today that IS about when the game crashes tho, when normally it would cut to Sinister saying ""ah another lab rat for my studies"" or whatever he says. that's when it crashes.

If you ignore the 1350/1350 roadblock to ilvl 69 gear and look at other prices you'll see that protector is valued more than 2:1 over hero.  Yet for ancient devices the price difference is 2:1.

If you don't have any ilvl66 or 69 gear, I'd invest a bit into both to push you to hitting those recipes faster. Wait till AFTER you hit you commendation cap to use all of the chest, as otherwise you wouldn't be getting 'extra' coms.  If you find yourself hitting hero com cap but not prot, then invest in prot over heroes. Overall bang for your buck prot tends to go further, but they might cost a bit more if I recall correctly.  Basically just use it as a boost to hit recipe thresholds. Again the important bit is to open the boxes after you hit your cap for the week. That way you go over the cap and 'boost' yourself up some.  If you don't ever find yourself hitting commendation caps, it is still a nice push in the right direction.  I'd definitely say the coms would be the fastest way to push you towards end game.  Edit: words because phone. Carry on"
marvelheroes,3c6c4t,Jubite,2,Sun Jul 5 07:18:44 2015 UTC,"As someone who's at the point in the game where Hero/Protectors now seem like the most important currency, definitely go with Protectors.

Eventually, even with the bonus ones from the Retcons, you'll find yourself with more Hero commendations than Protectors."

It isn't worth using your limited respec devices on something so trivial to obtain.  If you're not raiding weekly, join a supergroup and start doing it.  The Mavericks has many raids per week for players on all sorts of schedules.  I bought Reliquaries of Rarity with my ~80 respec devices.  I got a couple decent cosmic medallions from it.  If you insist on getting commendations, Hero's is the green Muspelheim reward and Protector's is the red Muspelheim reward.  I don't know how many you get per respec device.  You'll have to do the math by comparing Clea's items and the raid token vendor's items.  Edit:  It is clear that opposing points of view are downvoted until hidden from view.  That's not what the downvote button is for.  Instead of offering a well-worded opposing point of view, I see that upvotes are given for the anti-raid, anti-spending-real-money, and ""the client has a memory leak"" points of view only.  I don't do this for the votes, but downvoting someone to censor them makes me not want to contribute to this subreddit any more.  If that's too long to read, this subreddit sucks.  I'll be on the official forums instead of this nonsense."
marvelheroes,3c6c4t,zylli42,16,Sun Jul 5 07:03:12 2015 UTC,Getting ilvl upgrades is top importance when you start out. Its totally worth spending devices for commendations if you want to reduce the grind by a week or a few days. You wont get in reds without full 66 unless you find someone to carry.  Also Green musp = hero and red = protector.
marvelheroes,3c6c4t,RLGGZA,-2,Sun Jul 5 07:19:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, I got them backwards.  Still, my point stands.  You shouldn't be looking at challenge bonuses if you don't have the item level upgrades.  If you do need the challenge bonuses, it is extremely easy to get the currencies from raiding.  If the OP does need the item level upgrades, they should definitely get the commendations to get an easy boost on the large amounts of currencies required.  My impression was that they should have their item level upgrades, given they played long enough to get 80 respec devices before the respecs went free."

I find it alarming when the party leader is advertising ""LFM noobs are welcomed"" and then all of a sudden sone dude with crap gear or no gear at all suggest we do gold... then proceed to trash talk one of the guys who joined as a noob. Like seriously, on 1 hand you have 3/4 of LFG having unrealistic expectations and on the other, that remaining 1/4 will get highjacked by goldclowns (those are the guys who join groups and upon seeing the rest of the group has gear, orders said group to do gold and to kick person x who just joined)... or worse, the grouo advertises that new players are welcome but when the event starts going downhill they go full auto on the new guy(s)...  Honestly, even in the X-def days where people were all pissy about not reaching wave 40 it wasn't this bad. I don't, a lot of the newcomers have that ""I'm pro, go kill yourself N00b"" and I find that extremly annoying... especially when those very players are very much being carried.

marvelheroes,3c1sp8,SplendidRS,10,Sat Jul 4 09:51:16 2015 UTC,Runes in general I think need to be redesigned. Trim the amount down by half and put green - yellow text for them
marvelheroes,3c1sp8,Portablelephant,2,Sat Jul 4 00:31:50 2015 UTC,Absolutely. The fact that you can play for weeks and still not see a Serpent or Zod Rune is just dumb. Who are those rune words supposed to be for if we cant get those runes to drop? If there was at least some way to trade up lesser runes...
marvelheroes,3c1sp8,asylum101,3,Sat Jul 4 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"Try years for a zod... Haven't seen a single one in the almost 2 years I've been playing  Edit now that I think about it runes haven't been around all this time... Still, haven't seen one"

marvelheroes,3c1sp8,HandsUpDontBan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:40:29 2015 UTC,I had my first Serpent Rune ever drop yesterday. Thankfully one of the Doop Runewords is good (better?) for summoners as well.

marvelheroes,3c1sp8,urbn,3,Sat Jul 4 04:41:19 2015 UTC,"garbage runes should just have the standard color.  The top tier rare runes should have a drop sound and light ray.  These runes are far more important then some of the crap drops that have light rays, and in fact these rare runes are the most difficult drops to get.  The rarity should reflect the notification.    Hell at this point I almost expect a marvel hero mod to call me on the phone and congratulate me once I finally drop a Tyr rune."
marvelheroes,3c1sp8,TimexG,2,Sat Jul 4 05:20:29 2015 UTC,"Even just a different sound notification would be fine with me.. I would like to see more rays of light though. Maybe their own color.. My problem is, I only ever see the same runes over and over.. at this point I'm even questioning looting most runes.. cause I can't find anything relevant most of them are used for.. same with relics.. I keep the crit ones and the lemuria and armor relics.. thats about it.  Even worse. 1 of my 2 stash pages is nothing but runes.. and yet I haven't used a single one in months because they're all useless without the one-two rare impossible to find ones.. idk. I just feel some are overweighted."
marvelheroes,3c1sp8,Wafzig,3,Sat Jul 4 07:09:05 2015 UTC,"Its because Runes are special items.  Everything affected by special item find has the pink-ish color text.  Everything else is affected by rare item find.   I think the ray of light idea would work well to draw attention to Loki, Doop, Surtur, Tyr, etc. runes."
marvelheroes,3c1sp8,semajay,2,Sat Jul 4 00:39:18 2015 UTC,"True. I'm more likely to leave a Cosmic item on the ground than a Rune, and if they were yellow I'd surely miss more."

marvelheroes,3c3pwl,JulienMaille,4,Sat Jul 4 13:53:36 2015 UTC,"CHR>BHR>CDR>BDR--in order of most beneficial to your dps.  (for gotk)  The reason chr takes more priority is quite simply you will crit more than you brute, and CDR raises your BD% (not the rating)    But also at the same time if you have one that say the BDR is slightly higher than the CDR or the CHR/BDR and all other stats are similiar just keep it as is.  you run a higher risk of getting a shit Gotk by rerolling.    I can give you a good example of someone who has put in many hours theory crafting and calculating dps.  This is by far one of the most comprehensive guides on the forums.  If you are into min/maxing gear I recommend reading it.  There are many people out there who undervalue some stats and overvalue others when they shouldn't."
marvelheroes,3c3pwl,jasonrawr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:40:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for your detailed answer. I will look at the guide. Could you elaborate on commonly under/over-valued stats?
marvelheroes,3c3pwl,Asheme,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:34:00 2015 UTC,To add on: diminishing returns factor in at some point re: crit rating which may make critical damage rating more attractive.
marvelheroes,3c3pwl,jmarFTL,2,Sat Jul 4 17:24:37 2015 UTC,"https://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/153077/item-comparison-tool-unsupported  This is a really great tool. Basically, leave a slot open on your character for the item you want to put in. Then you input your stats from the character sheet as listed, and the damage of the power you want to look at it.  Then you enter the stats of the two items, and the tool will tell you what percent of a DPS increase the items will give you."
marvelheroes,3c3pwl,zylli42,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:44:25 2015 UTC,"The formulas for all of these things can be found in the compendium link on the right.  --->  The effectiveness of your critical damage depends on your critical hit chance.  The chance to brutally strike also depends on your critical hit chance because a brutal is a crit that crits.  The brutal strike damage depends on your brutal strike chance and gains benefit from your critical damage.    Because of this reliance, it is impossible to give an absolute ""weight"" for stats.  Some have given approximate weighting which may or may not be accurate for your character stats.  If you want a fast way to calculate the average multiplier from crit/brutal and crit/brut damage, my Omega calculator has that feature built in.  It can be found in the sidebar.  --->"
marvelheroes,3c3pwl,droid327,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:02:13 2015 UTC,It's going to vary hero to hero.  Some heroes may slightly prefer one stat at the expense of another...but it's usually just splitting hairs since the roll range greatly exceeds the differences in stat weighting.
marvelheroes,3c3pwl,llleTownlll,-2,Sat Jul 4 17:05:53 2015 UTC,"Due to the current influx of ""Brut Heavy items"", I tend to rate the order of importance on a GotK to be :  1&2 Crit Rating, Crit Damage (about the same importance imo)  3 Brute Damage  4 Brute Rating  Go with that imo."

marvelheroes,3c3pwl,TylerTheDerp,-6,Sun Jul 5 20:49:47 2015 UTC,Generally you look for brut/crit dmg. The hit increase is just icing.
marvelheroes,3c3pwl,RogueXxXHerald,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:57:59 2015 UTC,so the formula would be score=CDR+BDR and ignore hit rating?
marvelheroes,3c3pwl,TylerTheDerp,4,Sat Jul 4 14:06:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, I would look for higher crit rating and higher crit damage before looking for anything else. Crit rating means you get more crit hits and by extension, more brut hits. More crit damage means your crit damage is higher and by extension, your brut damage is higher. If you have a gotk rolled 150/240/600/750 (crit/brut/crit damage/brut damage) I would not place that above a 200/190/750/650 gotk (crit/brut/crit damage/brut damage). Also, a 200+/700+ gotk is just more aesthetically pleasing than a 150/210/740/740 gotk to some people (and as I stated before, that crit rating does matter more than that brut rating). Obviously, some of these points become moot depending on your actual stats (diminishing returns), in which case you have to look for the stats that matter more."

I haven't spent a dime on unlocking heroes and I have way more characters than know what I to do with.  Stash space is the number 1 thing you should buy with money.
marvelheroes,3c39bi,Quexana,2,Sat Jul 4 10:43:16 2015 UTC,I gotten Scarlet witch now and she is way more fun to play. Gone wait a bit to see if the game is ok for me and if there is a sale.  thanks.

Five of the newer ones; Iceman, Winter Soldier, She-Hulk, Vision and Doom; plus the upcoming pre-order Antman aren't in the Megapack MK III.  So if you're sure you are going to get the Megapack later on if it is on sale, you could drop some cash on the other above-mentioned heroes first.  There is currently a bundle available for She-Hulk, Vision and Doom.  This wasn't discounted during the last sale you just missed.    And in case you missed it, there is a semi-pre-order TEAM-UP Bundle up right now.  Quicksilver, Angel and Captain America Sam Wilson will be available to use as team up right away if you buy this.

It usually drops down to $130 and at that its a pretty stellar value.    The pack is totally worth it if you think you are going to play the game consistently.  You also should have 400 ES on day two logging in to buy another character or two if you want to try out others."
marvelheroes,3c39bi,Soske,2,Sat Jul 4 10:01:34 2015 UTC,The pack was just on sale for $130 for the 2 Year Anniversary.  I recommend you just play normally and wait for it to be that price again.  I'm thinking Christmas time at the latest.  And until then use splinters to unlock the heroes who aren't in the Mega Pack.

It's an easy muscle memory to overwrite. and as /u/fenrirIII said, Ult is bound to 'u'. I press it so infrequently that having it to the side is no problem. That'll free up 2 spots for you. If you have a 'toggle' power, keep those on a separate bar, just have to hit those once basically fire and forget.  I've found most heroes can be played 1 bar, but often times, yes that does mean losing a spot for travel power (not a big deal except for convenience) and your cc removal (I'm guilty of this one, but a lot of good players would say this is a mistake).  But for casual play, I've never had a problem keeping all heroes to 1 bar. If you get serious for raiding, you may have to retrain yourself later, so you have to decide if that's easier to learn now, or later."

marvelheroes,3c3n2r,UnlikeClockwork,2,Sat Jul 4 18:56:25 2015 UTC,"I was almost on the same boat as you. I didn't raid at all until like 2 months ago, where the guild organized a red at like 3am and since they were missing one I offered to go. I'd say the reason I never wanted to go was because I still remember how excrutiating raiding was on WoW, but on here it's 100 times easier. I fully skipped the green raid, and only died 4 times on the whole red (once on a slag jump, the other 3 times during sisters, until I realized it follows an extremely easy pattern).  Raids here are extremely forgiving, go ahead and try them out."
marvelheroes,3c3n2r,jongiplane,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:59:11 2015 UTC,i think it's fair to say that is my opinion too haha. Coming from a hardcore raiding guild in WoW from years ago...the idea of dedicating HOURS AND HOURS just to try to down a boss is...painful to say the least (GFY 10m Arthas hard mode)
marvelheroes,3c3n2r,Nekryyd,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:59:12 2015 UTC,Nothing like that in this game. A raid can be an hour at most on here. It's such a breath of fresh air for casual gamers and those who don't wish to pour excessive amounts of time into just one piece of content.  Try it. It's not bad in the least bit. Extremely min/max'd characters can make a Green Mus raid in less than 25 minutes. Go for a simple green Mus just to learn the mechanics. :) I swear it's painless.

marvelheroes,3c3n2r,sheetskees,2,Sun Jul 5 11:14:18 2015 UTC,"I play Ghost Rider with only one bar.  I don't know how ""viable"" he is as I just barely got him to 60 - but he hasn't given me any trouble thus far.  In fact, he's been a ton of fun.  In fact, he might appeal to your lazy side because you can lazily peel flaming donuts through mobs and demolish them with rapid Hell From Above strikes.  The skills I have on my bar:  LMB: Chain Lash. Good range, and combines with Chains Ablaze to cause mental damage and restore my spirit a little faster.  RMB: Ride.  I know it's technically not the most effective movement ability, but I just wouldn't feel right playing GR without it.  Also, if you have gear that restores Spirit when hitting with a Movement (such as Elektra's Medallion) you can basically leave flaming streaks completely indefinitely.  This also plays into a special that recharges Hell From Above 1 second quicker when hitting with a movement, letting you do that near indefinitely as well.  A: Inferno.  Just a good basic area that looks cool and applies Hellfire stacks.  S: Infernal Contract.  A cool ability in both the fact that it is active and passive.  Actively is ramps up your Crit and Brutal.  Passively it keeps you from dying.  F: Penance Stare.  Again, an ability I just think GR needs to have in order to feel like GR.  Unless your target is buffed against mental, it is actually a pretty strong attack.  Definitely good against bosses.  G: Hellfire.  Basically a flamethrower attack.  Really good for wiping out mobs or stripping away boss health.  H: Medkit.  Though I have only rarely needed it so far.  Like I said, he's been good so far but I've yet to take him to cosmic terminals or anything.  No idea how well GR stands up to that."

I think it's fair to everyone how they are now.  By not adding a pause button, Gaz can keep a steady flow of income.. and I think that's perfectly fine.  As a player would it be cool?  Absolutely.  However I'm happy with how it works now.  You can choose to boost when you want.  If you can't take full advantage of those boosts you can log off or afk in a hub and they'll be there waiting when you get back.  The only reason, I can see, where pausing your boosts might be beneficial is if you already popped a bunch and friend says ""hey lets level something"", and they have no boosts on.. Happened to me like a month ago lol.. I went 1-15 in like 2 minutes in Holo-sim and my friend was like level 2.  But it is what it is.  As for re-rolling easier.. yeah man, that's great!

marvelheroes,3c4oyh,renroval,4,Sat Jul 4 19:25:39 2015 UTC,He's Doom. I accept that our overlord has arrived
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,SplendidRS,2,Sat Jul 4 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"On the matter of the Summon TTL, I believe there may be a slight adjustment to the minions' health incoming as like you said, his summons basically never die even in CMM and other content like that."
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,CjP1294,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:34:42 2015 UTC,Hm...what kind of gear are you running so they don't die out of curiosity?  I know my Doombots at least 1 or 2 are dead as the cooldown comes up.  So I know mine are fairly squishy though.    Granted I know parted of it is because I'm sitting at 170.9% Summoned Ally Health and 377.5% Summoned Ally Damage.  I just haven't been working on fully gearing him up like I have a few others.  Just wasn't sure if the higher % made a massive difference in them not dying.
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,aceso2896,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:29:35 2015 UTC,"I'm actually using this build on marvelheroes http://marvelheroes.info/build/18269/  The doombots scale with your health as well and the build I just linked there has a solid amount of health in the slots 2-5 so that helps keep them alive. I have the doombots running at around 1800% of my health while I have 24,000 which equates to around 432,000."
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,CjP1294,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:15:35 2015 UTC,Hm...that's similar to mine except I maxed Latveria War Drums and kept the Blockade at 1 so I could always keep the passive 3% chance to negate damage.  I think mine is more gear related as I have Doom's Uniques so far and they aren't really summon friendly.  Rocket has my Summoner Uniques at the moment.
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,aceso2896,3,Sun Jul 5 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say to all other heroes. He's in line with the top-tier, but the top-tier is a fairly small group. I'd even argue Scarlet Witch may even edge him out when you factor in her burst out of her sig's buff, spirit regen, and life regen. The main perk to doom is that he can compete with the best while being played very passively, and very safely with all those summons surrounding him.  I'm sure the power creep will continue as new characters release, and others get reworked, and we'll see him toned down in comparison."
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,Uhgii,2,Sat Jul 4 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"I main both, and SW is better in pretty much every way.  Not by a wide margin, but respectable.  Doom gets eaten alive by large packs of mobs, his summons can't keep up and he goes down.  SW, she just pops that bubble and everything on the screen vaporizes while she heals up and is basically immune to damage.  Doom sometimes has the edge when it comes to single-target DPS, but that's about it."
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,grinr,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:46:47 2015 UTC,Tri or Sorcery has insane burst DPS.  Or you can run Summoner doom and have sustained DPS that matches Scarlet Witches burst.
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,dorn3,-8,Sat Jul 4 22:04:59 2015 UTC,His TTK is about 1 minute lower than SW. I highly doubt anyone can even come close to him.
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,Uhgii,3,Sat Jul 4 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're referring to sustained DPS. Then yeah, he outclasses her pretty quick. Keep in mind his Latverian Air Defense got a pretty big nerf after that sustained TTK was done, and that's his single largest hit. While it won't make it a lot longer, I doubt it's a full minute under the other top-tier characters now. The ability would have been used 15 times over that specific video, and it receives half the amount of damage from summon damage % now than it used to.  He could certainly be tuned down, though, I don't think anyone would argue otherwise.  All of that being said, he's fairly boring to play. So there's that."
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,781-lamina,7,Sat Jul 4 19:46:24 2015 UTC,"Why does it matter,do people not want to use doom so they are mad others who do are strong? So many heroes seem bad but people keep bringing attention to strong heroes? Let them bring up some of the other heroes before bringing down the strong ones."
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,dorn3,9,Sat Jul 4 20:35:07 2015 UTC,I get why people don't like nerfs.  I never get why people are surprised by the call for nerfs though.  You get an OP hero and all the sudden it's like you're other heroes are moving through molasses.  Then they buff the bosses which nerfs everyone.
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,781-lamina,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:02:33 2015 UTC,I rather have every hero decent and feeling weaker to some top heroes than having 1 more decent char added to the list of decent chars and a bunch feeling like they are useless.Also they just make new instances with higher difficulty mainly beside buffing life.To me in this game you die 1hit or within 1sec from everything hitting you at the same time or you don't die.
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,jmarFTL,2,Sun Jul 5 00:27:45 2015 UTC,"They make content with higher difficulty, and then you can't get into that content unless you're playing one of the top heroes. That's due to power imbalances. It's not a big deal with Red Musp but you see it a bit with Axis, people look down on lower tier heroes and with reason, because without insane gear/omega they can't do the content.   When the new red axis raid comes out this will be exacerbated more. Now we can hope everyone is buffed to Doom levels but that's unlikely to happen in a quick manner. More likely Doom is gonna get knocked down a peg."
marvelheroes,3c4oyh,dorn3,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:38:36 2015 UTC,"You must be new.  The Devs have a history of buffing the bosses over and over to make up for power creep.  The end result was far from ""every hero decent""."

However, the spell also had an effect on some of the heroes and villains who were present at the battle.  Carnage was also effected by the inversion spell.

marvelheroes,3c0o4w,Cheeseburgermafia,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:55:46 2015 UTC,"SG summoner is hard to kill. RR is similar, but needs to lay down turrets to start each fight while SG just walks around with her squirrel army. Also I prefer SG's voice acting to RR. She's just too cute. Bot are a great break from the more serious, grimdark heroes.  Ms. Marvel is very tanky as ranged or melee, and can fairly easily hybrid."
marvelheroes,3c0o4w,ohoni,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:44:56 2015 UTC,"I've found Iron Man really powerful as well as easy to play when ranged.  Here's what I use, which I understand to be a standard build.  A new account is gonna have to take whatever hero synergy they have access to, but pick these first. Crit, brutal, ranged damage, energy damage, physical damage, area damage, boss damage.  Omegas are all about fighting, energy, crit/brut rate/damage. You can get plenty of spirit from gear alone.  Artifacts are stuff to boost crit and boss damage. His uniques are all very good, even if they're not best in slot for him. This makes him easy to gear starting out.  Max Arc Reactor Enhancement, Repulsor Barrage, The One-Off, Arc Reactor Overload, Micro-Missiles, Missile Control System, Wrist Rocket, Jericho Bombardment.  Put one point in each of Adaptive Armor and Life Support Systems.  You should have two points left. I'd drop one of them into Jet-Boot Flight. Maybe put the second one there too, but I put it in Coolant Blast for another area attack to take out groups as I walk past.  Arc Reactor Enhancement, Adaptive Armor, Missile Control System, and Life Support Systems are toggled powers that should always be enabled. Leave them on an inactive action bar, and fill your primary action bar with the rest.  Spam Jericho Bombardment, Wrist Rocket, Micro-Missiles, and add Arc Reactor Overload when you near 50% spirit. Repulsor Barrage will be your main attack, and you won't need a basic attack due to how much spirit restoration you can get from Arc Reactor Overload.  Spirit becomes effectively infinite once you have a large enough pool due to Arc Reactor Overload restoring 40% maximum spirit, regardless of how much spirit you have. Use Relic of the Gibborim and have slot 2-4 spirit enchanted. If you need more spirit restore, Odin blessings on your artifacts work great when farming MM/ICP.  Pretty powerful against packs even if you're just spamming everything that's not on cooldown. Just watch yourself until you can scrape together a health pool that makes you feel comfortable.  There are more powerful ranged builds out there, but I've found them to either be more complicated or require binding extra hotkeys and I just prefer to stick with the default hotkeys.  Iron Man can be built as a melee powerhouse as well, but as I don't have much experience with him in melee, I won't say how to build one."
marvelheroes,3c0o4w,ohoni,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:40:53 2015 UTC,"I find Silver Surfer movement build fairly easy. The only content that can be tricky (but manageable) with him is Cosmic Patrols. He just shoots at everything constantly.  Also, Spider-Man is in a solid place right now. I haven't quite gotten him to 60 yet, so maybe he falls off a cliff or something, but he's been dominant while leveling him. Tons of huge AoE, tons of free movement, he just runs around wrecking face, a bit like a more aggressive Cap.   I do agree that Cap is solid though, very durable and he has some hard hitting AoEs too (just longer cooldowns).   Also Squirrel Girl, because Squirrels."
marvelheroes,3c0o4w,Frankthebank22,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:20:48 2015 UTC,I've heard a lot of good things from Spider Man.  The bad thing about SS and Spider Man is I don't think she would like the movement abilities.  I tried to get her into IW since she's quite strong leveling but she doesn't seem that interested. I will have to look into Captain America.... Does he have to do any stance dancing or anything like that?
marvelheroes,3c0o4w,Valexexe,2,Fri Jul 3 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"Cap has two toggles, but they aren't necessary and at most you can just turn one on and forget it. He has a secondary resource, but you can almost forget it's there most of the time, and he builds spirit quickly by default. One fiddly thing with him is that if you throw his shield, you don't have it for a couple seconds until it comes back, so shield throwing builds kind of need to get used to that, but he has plenty of other things to be doing.  I don't know who else I would recommend, I like Black Widow, Psylocke, and X-23 at the moment, but they can be a bit complicated to use. She-Hulk is interesting but a pain in the ass to manage. I kind of like Rocket gunner builds, you can mostly just blast away with his cone attack like a flame thrower, and Groot picks up a lot of the heat."

marvelheroes,3c0o4w,Shwagoblin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"Cyclops is easy early game, just channel your laser and spin in circles or focus beam for single target. Only thing is he gets squishy late so survivability becomes rough. Dat sweet motorcycle doe. Also, the 10% exp synergy is good to get asap.  EDIT: I'm not saying Cyclops is bad, but these are my experiences running him to level 60 in a few days through the event. I'm sure I didn't optimize him the best way but by the sounds of it OP's gf isn't a pro at the game so this is my input with my time with him (as my second hero played as well, btw).  Iceman is similar, easy to use (chill+shatter combo is cool but not important for just leveling to 60) and if you pick construct focus for summons then the ice golems make things a lot easier by tanking for ya."
marvelheroes,3c0o4w,shadowtact,3,Fri Jul 3 19:03:45 2015 UTC,Isn't Cyclops a little weak end game wise though?

marvelheroes,3c0o4w,Rhodair,-6,Fri Jul 3 19:30:33 2015 UTC,He falls off late but if it's just getting him to level 60 as long as you keep him alive it'll work out. To be honest I was very glad when I finished him because I was tired of dieing but Advanced Pheonix (Down) Feather artifact worked wonders to get me there.
marvelheroes,3c0o4w,dkphxcyke,2,Fri Jul 3 19:36:26 2015 UTC,"Lol no cyclops does not fall off at all. he's easily one of the top 15 heroes. He has incredible damage and utility with his ultimate and signature + all his aoe.   Maybe you just dont know how to build him (or even care to, which is fine) but he is far from ""falling off""."
marvelheroes,3c0o4w,Sabahe,2,Fri Jul 3 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say he's not good with end game content, only that he was harder at higher levels, which is what it seems like OP is looking for, considering his gf just got Storm to 60 and is looking for a new character.  I put an edit in my original post but also these are just my experiences playing these characters to level 60 as a new player."
marvelheroes,3c0o4w,cunnalinguist,2,Fri Jul 3 20:11:34 2015 UTC,"You must not have played Cyclops recently.  He has damage reduction now and gets a little more if he happens to roll through a mob.  If you're still having survival problems, just get a core with invulnerability."
marvelheroes,3c0o4w,droid327,2,Fri Jul 3 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"im getting the impression you're not giving cyclops enough of a try to really find out just how viable he is in the end game. But if he's not your cup of tea, then so be it.  Iceman doesn't even need to have summons to be just fine while taking a punch. dude has a bajillion invulnerabilities and does enough damage to smack things before they can smack him."

marvelheroes,3c0y50,CthulhuHasTheTARDIS,13,Fri Jul 3 20:37:10 2015 UTC,I like to start with cookie cutter but I end up changing some skills to fit my playstyle even if it isnt optimal. Also I despise builds that spread on more than one bar except if its just for a cc break and/or a stance
marvelheroes,3c0y50,ccthibault,3,Fri Jul 3 19:50:29 2015 UTC,This I agree on the two bar things.   I'm fine with a flying skill toggle CC or even a sig bro tv on there. I have it to where I hold alt and it goes to my second bar. But I don't want to be switching back and forth every two seconds.

marvelheroes,3c0y50,NullRage,3,Fri Jul 3 21:16:07 2015 UTC,I do the same. I too hate builds that take more than one bar.
marvelheroes,3c0y50,Oshiba,2,Fri Jul 3 20:11:28 2015 UTC,"I started off with a cookie cutter tried and true build.  There were some parts that I loved and others I just disliked.  I used it as a starting point to which equipment I should look for and some basic concepts of what skills, stats, omega choices people choose and why for a build.  For example for scarlet witch the most popular build focuses on legion, which is like 2600 points just for the skill, and very specific gear choices.  I decided to not go with legion which frees up several pieces of gear choices as well as a large number of omega points to use else where  Summary: Cookie cutters are great to build from or to use as a starting point, but you should build off them to what you enjoy."
marvelheroes,3c0y50,urbn,2,Fri Jul 3 21:33:04 2015 UTC,"There's a reason people cut the cookies a certain way.

marvelheroes,3c0y50,Meesh_7,2,Fri Jul 3 21:48:23 2015 UTC,"I like to level characters with abilities I want, but if I intend on gearing them and running endgame content then I follow an effective build. I may change or not use an ability or two though, to fit how I want to play."
marvelheroes,3c0y50,Dancamvet,2,Fri Jul 3 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"I'll go with useful skills for levelling and then change up at 60 to a more endgame focused build as needed. I'll go and research 3-4 builds in the ballpark of what I feel is good for the character but if there's a skill I feel I want in there I'll make changes to the cookie cut to suit my style/needs. I often then get ideas when I prestige a hero if I've not been happy with the starting build I've used as I then know how they play a bit and can make decision based on my experience of them in the first levelling and endgame arc.  I often have a secondary power build for a slightly different purpose on the character that I can switch to, for example if there's a very effective AoE mob clear that isn't in a final terminal/raid build I have that in my secondary for doing standard midtowns etc if I just need to blow through some trash mobs for shared quests. In terminals I might start on the secondary if I'm doing a bounty and then switch to the primary (often boss killing) build for the boss at the end.  Bottom line though, free respec is the best thing to happen. You can experiment more freely with builds and omega now and if you don't like it, press reset and change it up."
marvelheroes,3c0y50,MutatedSpleen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:39:54 2015 UTC,well said.
marvelheroes,3c0y50,LikeIFuckingCare,2,Fri Jul 3 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"Before retcons went infinite (best change ever), and before multi-spec, I typically went for something I was like 95% sure I would like, or a basic cookie-cutter build.  This was because I had serious what-if-I-need-it-later-itis, and I refused to use my retcons in case I needed them for something later.  Then multi-spec happened, and I bought some extra specs.  After that, I had no problem experimenting with builds and trying stuff out, but I always saved one spec slot just in case I needed to use a tried-and-true build.  Now, with infinite retcons, not only do I do my own thing, I spend every single power point when I get it, and always keep whatever skills I'm using maxed.  If a new skill comes up that I want in favor of another skill, I just respec and redistribute my points as necessary.  This is a much more fun playstyle, in my opinion."

marvelheroes,3c0y50,Suzina,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:09:06 2015 UTC,"Still new to the game so I'm just trying my own builds on the toons I have for now.  What I like about this method is the satisfaction in discovering different and sometimes more effective rotations by myself.  However, when I'm ready to delve into endgame content, I will definitely look into the tried and tested, effective builds other more experienced players have put out there.  No point doing endgame with ineffective experimental builds when everyone else expects everyone else to be on their A game.  For now, I'm just having fun levelling my roster and discovering their powers as I go.  I also realize that unlimited RetCon is a new thing.  Compared to OG players, we are lucky we don't have to pre-plan all our builds so we won't fuck it up.  I can just imagine how stressful it was for OG players spending hours to research where to most effectively place that extra skillpoint they just earned."
marvelheroes,3c0y50,weltschmerz79,2,Fri Jul 3 21:30:53 2015 UTC,yeah i can tell you it was a major pain in the ass area for sure. i would most of the time have anywhere between 5-25 points sitting there and a barren power bar due to not wanting to respec and or waiting till i hit around lvl 45 and then using my potion to fix or redo powers.

marvelheroes,3c0y50,TheMightyWill,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:43:02 2015 UTC,"I build the way I want unless I keep hitting a wall for survivability or enjoyment.  Since they got rid of buying retcons, making builds has become way more forgiving and fun.  Honestly, the game seems very open to experimentation and variety.  You aren't stuck to cookie-cutters like in WoW and you aren't punished for trying new stuff.  You can duplicate a lot of group scenarios by yourself and free of penalty and see if your build holds water without embarrassing yourself."
marvelheroes,3c0y50,GrapeMousse,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:48:31 2015 UTC,"Considering how heroes in this game are made, if you don't go ""cookie cutter"" or at least with minimal variation, you just want be viable. At all. Even if you don't follow the internet builds if you have any knowledge of the game mechanics you usually end up with a very similar build than is found on the internet.  With that said, I won't try and use a broken set up on a hero just so I can enjoy him. I'll find a hero with a ""cookie cutter"" build I think is fun.

marvelheroes,3c2tk2,haestus,5,Sat Jul 4 05:57:19 2015 UTC,There are no classes.  Each hero can follow a few archetypes but as far as classes go?  No.  Heroes generally play how you would think.    Storm is a ranged elemental wizard.  Colossus is a melee bruiser.  Wolverine is a melee bruiser.  It isn't hard to figure out generally how each plays just off basic character knowledge.  If you still find it hard to figure out DL the test center and test them out.

marvelheroes,3c1s9v,TheWiseMountain,14,Fri Jul 3 23:37:21 2015 UTC,"I love Marvel Heroes, don't get me wrong.  This is the game I have spent the most time in basically ever.  I love Gaz, I think they are great developers, and I am really happy they put so much work into this game...  That being said, I don't think they exactly deserve a ""thank you"" from me, so to speak.  They are a business, after all.  They aren't doing something for me so much as we are doing something for each other.  They provide me with a source of entertainment, and I pay them a fairly large amount of money.  I will thank them in the same sense that they send me automated e-mails after I make a purchase saying ""Thank you for your purchase!""  We mean good intent, but it's just an unnecessary pleasantry.  They do not deserve our express gratitude for doing their jobs and pushing out content for this game, as that is their manner of garnering revenue.  We can be happy they are doing it, but specifically being grateful, in my mind, suggests that they are sacrificing something for our benefit - which they 100% absolutely are not.  I'll always take a few minutes to provide feedback on recent events and content releases to tell them ""Hey, I really liked this thing that you did.  Keep that up."" or ""Hey, this thing that happened this past week was really awful, and I think you can change it in the following ways..."".  That's the way we should be ""thanking"" them instead of outright praise.  Or, to provide another example, it would be like thanking McDonalds for selling cheeseburgers.  It's kind of a silly notion because that's literally the core of their business model.  You are essentially thanking them for doing the thing they do to make money.  I mean that whole thing in a very general sense.  There are, and will always be, specific scenarios where thanks is appropriate (maybe extra special attention to a serious bug over weekend or holiday hours would elicit thanks, for example).  But in general, I don't see the purpose in going out of your way to thank someone for doing the thing that makes them money."
marvelheroes,3c1s9v,MutatedSpleen,-5,Sat Jul 4 06:31:44 2015 UTC,I feel like everybody who does good at their job deserves a thank you. You may pay for a meal at a restaurant and give a tip but you still say thank you. People need to be thanked for good work.
marvelheroes,3c1s9v,MutatedSpleen,4,Sat Jul 4 06:34:56 2015 UTC,"I sort of look at that as a different thing, which I intended to cover in my second-to-last paragraph, but upon re-reading, I totally skipped it.  I don't think people doing their job specifically deserve a ""thank you"" solely for doing their job.  If they are going out of their way to serve you specifically, then definitely yes, they get one.  I would also extend that to any time you are interacting one-on-one with someone, but that's more a function of being part of a polite society than it is a truly heartfelt message of thanks, in my opinion.  To provide two examples:  In the McDonalds scenario, I will absolutely thank the person handing me my food.  It's polite, I interacted directly with that person, and they spent one-on-one time with me (even if it was a slight amount of time).  I will not, however, thank McDonalds in general for making really good (""really good"") hamburgers because that is their core purpose, it is their business model, and I don't think they deserve any particular extra recognition for doing something that overtly benefits themselves, as they would have done this regardless of how I felt.  The second example, Gaz.  If I go on the forums and ask for Kitty Pryde spoilers, and Doomsaw replies showing me something cool, he will absolutely get a ""thank you"" because he spent his time interacting one-on-one with me when there was little-to-no reason to.  I will not, however, thank Gaz as an entity for creating this game.  I love the game, I play it every day, and I've spent over $1100 on it...but they didn't do this because they wanted to contribute something great to the world at the cost of their time and energy...they did this because they thought it would be an awesome way to make a bunch of money - and it is, no fault there, no problem with that at all.  It is their core business practice, and I personally don't believe a business deserves thanks for participating in its core business practice.  It's obviously a personal choice, of course.  I personally feel as though there is a fine line between being appreciative, and being grateful.  I can appreciate the game without being grateful.  That works for me.  Definitely no harm done by anyone who feels differently, though."
marvelheroes,3c1s9v,Doomgrin75,-3,Sat Jul 4 06:50:48 2015 UTC,"What a load of crap.  Thanks for a job well done is always deserved, regardless if they benefit from it or not.  Gaz is not a person.  It is a company.  But Gaz is made up of people that do not get $$$ for every sale.  It is made of of humans that do their best to provide entertainment and provide for themselves and their families.  And if they do something that provides me and my friends hours upon hours of entertainment then they deserve our thanks!  THANK YOU TO THE MEN AND WOMEN AT GAZILLION ENTERTAINMENT!"

Gaz doesn't give a crap about all your praise and gazillion of thanks if at the end of the day you don't spend any money on their game. Actually it's a business, not a charity and constant praise from people like you is what make this company having a very low standard in quality control in the last months, because you are thankful/grateful regardless of their several screwed up patches ..."

Companies aren't people and don't care what you think as long as you are paying them.  The individuals who work at the company, sure, but not the company itself.  You'll see my thank Doomsaw, Amthua, Heretic, Ryolnir, and all the others....but you won't see me thank Gazillion itself."
marvelheroes,3c1s9v,docnose,15,Sat Jul 4 16:28:30 2015 UTC,Can we just all cut the bullshit with the 'can we just all whatever' posts?  Gaz gets thanked on the reg. That's never been a problem. You're not actually concerned with thanking Gaz. You just want to have everyone say thank you so you can have the attention of everyone saying thank you. It doesn't flatter you to somehow have the biggest thank you.
marvelheroes,3c1s9v,mvmtproductions,-2,Sat Jul 4 03:08:15 2015 UTC,I agree this community I was here since the beginning and it was formed from those whatever posts that brought it to this day!!! Thank gaz all the time for sure but those whatever posts has also shaped the game for what it is now!

Give it time, you'll become a bit jaded by a lot of the empty promises and bugs that literally go on for 6+ months. I've decided to take a break and stopped financially supporting them for the past 2 months until I see where their standing is, because frankly, I'm really starting to get annoyed with them.  I could go into a lot of detail as to why they are on a slippery slope, but anyone who has been around a long time knows why, so I won't bother. If you're enjoying the game, I hope you continue to enjoy it, it truly is a great game."
marvelheroes,3c1s9v,SplendidRS,2,Sat Jul 4 16:39:55 2015 UTC,"Oh the delusion of new fresh MH players. Most of us were as excited about this game as you were when we started, even though it was in a sad state when it launched compared to today. But then you will slowly start to realize how little content they add to the game on a yearly basis (when it's not recycled content), apart from the usual monthly hero/team-up/costumes/boosts to bring more revenue.  How the community in the official forum is mainly left with sheeps/sycophants/whiteknights that would defend Gaz for the most illogical reasons, even the most blatant lies Gaz put up with. Gaz who has been banning left and right to make sure the community look nice and docile, hence acting like angry kids when it comes to moderation, with little to no professionalism. Just check some of the posts the CM made of this very own forum to see for yourself.  As for bugs, this game is constantly bringing new and old bugs, some that would linger for months and when they finally fix some of them, they eventually come back a few weeks later with more. Also as far as performance issues, this game is certainly one of worst optimized game in recent years. Lag, overheating rig, memory leak ... you name it you have it.  Oh and about that highly praised free to play model of MH, I don't think I have ever seen costumes exclusively gated being a gambling paywall anywhere else in the gaming industry, where you would need to spend around 80-100$ to ensure you get the costume you want. This is ethically a dodgy decision, but then again money is to good to be made for Gaz."

The free stuff and the try before you buy setup is great.  If you want to spend money its there, if you don't, you can get the idea of what you are missing and make a choice to spend some cash or not.  I spent about 300 already haha, oh boy. I look at it like, I never buy games so paying for a game that I love 6 times is better than buying 6 games that I don't play.  I feel like there is a million things to do, but I don't feel like I'm a loser for just leveling characters in Midtown.  Its fun to just play.  I love the costumes, I love the characters, the game play is great, the power customization is great.  I played Diablo back in the day, but this Marvel Heroes is so much more fun.  I feel connected with the characters.  Thanks :)"
marvelheroes,3c1s9v,dingbat112,-3,Sat Jul 4 04:31:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, yeah the free to play method is pretty good. You can't really get all the heroes for free though even if you play an extensive amount of time without prestiging ALOT. Game is decent overall."

marvelheroes,3c1s9v,mvmtproductions,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:59:37 2015 UTC,I don't like the random part. I think the 50% off deal is better as you get 2x what you want. Not complaining tho. I play like a month and spend 16 euro's for 2x stash and 3-x teamup heroes. I find the stash thing a problem as there's too much you need/want to save. Other then that the game is really nice with a good social side.

marvelheroes,3c1s9v,MutatedSpleen,0,Sat Jul 4 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"again, so much shit in the cash shop, endless grind to get new heroes (having to prestige.)"
marvelheroes,3c1s9v,sherazzie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:04:47 2015 UTC,"You really don't have to prestige ever if you don't want to.  The only benefit prestiging gets you is a new name color and a bonus default costume.  Splinters drop on an (approximately) 8-minute timer.  As long as you are playing any level-relevant content, you'll get splinters with which you can buy either random heroes (which you should do until you have ~30 heroes - there is an exact formula for this, but it requires knowing who you have and who you don't have), or specific heroes for specific amounts.  There are also free hero codes given away regularly, and free eternity splinters given away regularly.  Casual-to-moderate gameplay will net you a new hero every week pretty easily.  Serious gaming, you can net a new free hero every 2-3 days.  Towards the end, there is obviously a level of randomness to this if you are going the free hero box route.  There are exactly zero things in the cash shop that are actually necessary to have in order to experience the full game.  Even team-ups can be bought with splinters.  The only things that can't be bought with splinters are boosts (which really aren't necessary, they are just time-savers) and costumes (which are purely cosmetic) - just like PoE's cash shop."
marvelheroes,3c1s9v,sherazzie,-3,Sat Jul 4 06:40:02 2015 UTC,"What shit in the cash shop? I didn't have to prestige to get new heroes. I got 1 at the start, then I got 400ES from daily and got SW and a random box (got Magneto) then I payed for some heroes and I got Deadpool free. I don't see the issue."
marvelheroes,3c1s9v,MutatedSpleen,0,Sat Jul 4 02:16:59 2015 UTC,Well people have their own opinions i remember when this game first came out and Spiderman was 20bucks just him no costume but his default so there were some bumps but its fine how it is the model is good.

marvelheroes,3bzvta,ohoni,2,Fri Jul 3 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"Well, basically they took Ice Man's hair, slapped it on a stock Cap head, Welded it onto an existing Cap costume, and then charged twice the price of a normal costume for it, so what can you expect?"

marvelheroes,3bzvta,ohoni,-2,Fri Jul 3 18:23:02 2015 UTC,"#### ""exclusive,"" there's nothing ""exclusive"" about paying $12 for a costume, anyone CAN afford that if they choose to. I don't care how many people have the same costume, all I care about is that I have the costume I want, and it pisses me off when they arbitrarily decide that the costume I want is going to cost twice as much as other costumes, even though it takes half the work for them to produce.  I don't have a problem with them charging extra for costumes that take extra effort, like additional animated fiddly bits, or new voice work, but if it's just several existing models bashed together, it shouldn't cost more than the existing ones. Bandai doesn't charge twice as much for their Build Fighters line as they do their normal kits.    If people really care about ""exclusive,"" release a version with and one without the little ""Limited Edition"" nameplate underneath it, and the attention whores can pay extra for that version while everyone else can just buy the regular version at a regular price."

marvelheroes,3bxl7p,UnlikeClockwork,8,Fri Jul 3 00:03:49 2015 UTC,i'm... i'm not sure why you want to buy medkits.  yes i am still a noob but with autopickup medkits from halfway accross the screen ive got thousands of them i can't use. i end up donating them for small bits of vendor exp.   do you frequently use them ?
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,Zukuto,16,Fri Jul 3 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"If you ever play a hero that relies on medkit spam to manage spirit issues you'll understand.  They are doing a decent job of phasing that out completely.  Newer heroes and reviewed heroes haven't seemed to have any resource issues at all lately.  But when I'm playing magneto he's very spirit hungry and I can burn through medkits doing that.  Also it depends on the content you're doing.  If you are doing MM then of course you'll always be stacked.  The content isn't that challenging and there are plenty of enemies.  If you're doing a raid you're basically doing a 8~ minute fight where you never kill anything and are constantly taking damage.  In those instances you'll be amazed at how fast you burn through medkits.  Was worse when the stacks only went to 50.    So yes, depending on hero and content medkits can be very valuable and used up much faster than in other situations."
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,turtle_with_dentures,-6,Fri Jul 3 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"Magneto literally is probably the least spirit intensive hero in the game. You throw down your two AOEs and then throw a car on CD, and then spend the rest of the time running around trying to not get 3-shot. Literally at full spirit basically all the time on him."
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,jongiplane,2,Fri Jul 3 03:06:02 2015 UTC,Agreed.  The guy gets spirit on orb pickup with the right gear so every time you do anything that generates debris you get spirit back.
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,BurnedOut_ITGuy,4,Fri Jul 3 11:16:44 2015 UTC,"Wat.  I have magneto extremely geared out and at cosmic prestige.  I play him exclusively in all endgame content including axis raid.  Are you not using barrage or something.  Your rotation sounds like a pretty huge DPS loss.  At 20%~ attack speed and with barrage as a constant filler my spirit is steadily ticking down.    I don't know who you are, or how you build your magneto, but it doesn't sound like you're doing it right.  Don't take that as a personal attack or anything, I just feel like you're not using him to his full potential."
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,turtle_with_dentures,0,Fri Jul 3 03:10:20 2015 UTC,"i use the spirit on orb runeword thing, might be less dps but it is less annoying."

marvelheroes,3bxl7p,OscarMiguelRamirez,4,Fri Jul 3 04:01:19 2015 UTC,Never once said that.  Just said he was spirit hungry so I'm always chugging medkits.
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,turtle_with_dentures,-4,Fri Jul 3 04:09:45 2015 UTC,"Well it's a bit different in a raid, because there are many more instances where you can stand still and spam barrage. I was talking more casually in CMM and stuff, where you get three-shot and have to keep moving between refreshing AOEs. But even then I don't see him having a huge spirit hog."
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,jongiplane,-2,Fri Jul 3 06:59:46 2015 UTC,"Debris counts as orbs.  Seer's Brillance Runeword gives 10 spirit for every orb you pick up.  Blunt Instrument gives a lot of debris... which count as orbs.  Mags does not have spirit issues, even when spamming shrapnel barrage.  All you have to do is throw a car and you get your spirit back.  Hell, shrapnel barrage generates debris as well, so it's gives you a greater amount of time before you need to throw a car.  Not to mention if you're killing things and picking up orbs too."
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,Galyndean,5,Fri Jul 3 17:36:00 2015 UTC,Mags does not have spirit issues      Seer's Brillance Runeword     He doesn't have spirit issues if you use gear/runewords designed specifically to alleviate spirit issues?  You don't say.

marvelheroes,3bxl7p,Arkfire79,3,Fri Jul 3 12:47:16 2015 UTC,yeah the need for boss uniques to be generic is going to make them harder to tune against the hero-specific.

marvelheroes,3bxl7p,MoonTrap44,0,Fri Jul 3 16:36:58 2015 UTC,What do you want them to add? Each of the event vendors has a long term goal and then useful resources for people that have obtained the long term goal so the event isn't useless.
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,HandsUpDontBan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:49:56 2015 UTC,No. It's no longer useful after you've obtained most of the higher goals. The possible solution was adding Gifted Doop Runes to Moondragon. That does not suffice nor remedy the excess we have.  This is even coming from someone who's done the 25 Completed Cybernetic Pet Achievements buy buying mostly Doop and Mini Sentinel Pets.
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,HandsUpDontBan,-1,Fri Jul 3 16:21:33 2015 UTC,Congrats?  Sounds like you spend a lot of time (and/or boosts) in game then. Sadly the events are to get casuals and non players interested. They're not for people dropping hundreds or thousands of hours into it.   Personally I think they game would be better without all the attention grabbing events and simply having a fair constant drop rate instead of relying on stunts to bring it up to a decent level every few days.  (For the record I've gotten all the stuff off the vendors I care to as well and I could do the pet achieve the same way you did if I cared about achieves in the slightest)
marvelheroes,3bxl7p,HandsUpDontBan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:00:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks?  Sounds like I regularly play. Sadly, the events are there for all players. They're there for every single one of us.* Corrected your first inferring sentences since you'll need to show me where they say they're there only to get casuals and non-players interested.  It's an echo'd sentiment from many players that the vendors could use some sprucing up/interest. I apologize if you do not feel the same way."

I haven't played through all the characters but of all the characters I have, each one feels different and the voice-overs add personality to the toons.  Those facts plus the upcoming movie warrants at least a single level-up to 60 playthrough for me.  Anyway, the pre-order is only giving a 10% discount.

marvelheroes,3bzsoo,Elliath,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:37:25 2015 UTC,"Wolverine seems to be the current TTK king of team-ups. I've got him at 60 and he does very good damage. Very little utility though.

Still, it's a good way to see if people use items like kiss of the viper, Batrocs boots, fragment of twilight, claws of the sisters, etc. then research how to get them.

I think that having him as a vendor and/or quest giver in the game is more than enough. Considering that even though he's a great guy and a charismatic individual, that he didn't do it alone. There's other writers and artists that barely get any recognition for their part in what built Marvel back in the day. As well as people who came later and delivered just as much greatness.

When passive, he might give you situational buffs depending on what map you're in.  Sorta representing the idea that he is giving you insider advice about the threat you face.  But more fun would be to have him active and his ""skills"" unlock more and more possible lines of dialog.  The skills could be named ""True Believer"", ""Stan's Soapbox"" and ""The Bullpen"" and such.  Each point in the skill unlocks a set of lines.  The more points you invest, the more dialog you get.  The nature of the dialog would expand upon what the TUs already have and include interesting tidbits about areas, characters, villains, heroes, the comics, the movies, and everything Marvel.  To put it another way, it'd be kinda like having director's commentary as you play.  He otherwise wouldn't do anything other than strike some funny poses perhaps, and would be immortal but not draw any enemies.  Purely just there for the fun and for interesting info.  'Course, it'd require a lot of lines of dialog, and that can't come cheap.  Could sell him at a higher price though and have him be something more of a ""luxury"" TU."

Preferably someone who's beefy at low levels with solid AoE abilities - Hulk and Juggernaut come to mind.  2) Give them a solid IL70 legendary. Gungnir is great for the stupidly high crit rating at low level, but Shield of Perseus will basically make you unkillable. If you want to be safe, take the Shield. Level this to max (4/5 works on Gungnir, 5/5 is the main point of Perseus as it's proc will kill everything).  3) Prestige, jump into Holo-sim with some XP boosts, and go nuts. Loot cosmic items with +2 to all skills if you can (the +1 to all skills affix is VERY common on low-level cosmics, compared to level 60 items).  Unique items are nice but quite frankly you want to abuse that level difference. They'll be stuck at their pathetic level, and your critical rating, damage rating, brutal rating, critical damage, and brutal damage all take the level gap into account. It's why the in-game stats aren't reliable or trustworthy for min/maxing (they are against level 60 foes, when everything is level 63)."

marvelheroes,3bvb2p,Sixstringsmash,2,Thu Jul 2 13:48:49 2015 UTC,It is.  I haven't bought a level 80 legendary yet.
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,Sixstringsmash,4,Thu Jul 2 13:49:46 2015 UTC,Also just make sure your really careful when your doing the stages where you have to fight charging characters like juggernaut. They can still one shot you  and you will never forgive yourself. Trust me.
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,matlockheed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:42:08 2015 UTC,I've never seen a Juggernaut stage.  Is there a list of all the possible stages?
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,ConorMAX,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:18:00 2015 UTC,"Um I'm not sure about a list of the stages, but a lot of the stages won't occur until later rounds(like 20 or 30 probably). Some I know off the top of my head are Magneto, Jugg, lady deathstrike, Rhino I think and more I can't think of."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,DentistOfDetroit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:41:11 2015 UTC,"There's a ""Protect the Citizens"" stage with Juggernaut where you get both the Brotherhood and Sinister 6 attacking a bunch of citizens at once and your job is to keep them away from the citizens.  I only remember it because when I was doing my Holosim Grandmaster run about 2 weeks ago, at one point in the later levels, Juggernaut decided to do a charge into the citizens and somehow didn't one-shot them (though he came close).  I think he also appears in the ""Defeat the Brotherhood"" wave which is Magneto, Blob (and Toad), Pyro, Lady Deathstrike, Sabretooth, Juggernaut and I think two more.  You only have to beat a few of them in that wave though.  Definitely not all of them (they'll say ""optional"" in the wave goals)."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,KamahlFoK,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"I was doing the same thing but it was like round 50 ish when this ""Protect the Citizens"" stage with Juggernaut happened. He did his charge and took 3 citizens out completely!! I was a little worried but was using SW and was able to take him out before he could finish the rest of them off.  Starting at Level 1 with gear you can use along the way really helps."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,DentistOfDetroit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:43:54 2015 UTC,Does the ilvl 80 legendary not carry over when prestiging?

marvelheroes,3bvb2p,Frankthebank22,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:14:46 2015 UTC,Also really helps to have a high level team-up out and taking some of the punches

marvelheroes,3bvb2p,tobiasosor,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:32:16 2015 UTC,"Some additional advice. Mkraan is amazing for this, because it can 1 shot bosses in the later waves. I would recommend lvl 5-9 holo sim, because the civilians have WAY more hp and you still vastly out level."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,notsam57,6,Thu Jul 2 22:55:56 2015 UTC,"Holo-sim is easy to get.  1 - Pick a character with strong aoe (Storm, Human Torch, etc.)  2- Go in at lvl 1, after the first 3 waves you should be high enough for nothing else to kill you  by wave 10 you should be around lvl 20+ and everything in there is stuck at lvl 2.  3 - Get to lvl 50 wave and enjoy your tittle.  Just remember the goal is to survive not to lvl  so the first few waves when you're weak just run more than usual."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,TEXANHIPPIE,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:35:34 2015 UTC,Wait...so you can get this title by outlevelling the sim? I figured they'd only let you do it starting at 60.

It took voice chat communication to time when they would go round-robin to each take a turn to pause and update powers and then omegas, but it did work.  They said the key was being strict on the timing and to never take the pause during any split waves.  They did it with 2 Summoner Dooms, 1 Lightning Ball Storm and 1 SW."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,khrucible,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:29:55 2015 UTC,"Let me just add one piece of advice.  Make SURE you click the box that says you want to SOLO it.  Nothing worse than prestiging a character, and then losing your holosim when the other guy dies trying to take down Elektra or just standing around for Sentinels.  I did it 1 to 50 on Vision, green prestige, no prep at all.  His legendary was the Pot of Gold.  I was just careful for a few of the early waves, but I outleveled the room very quickly."

Any tips? I need to go back and get that achievement."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,Pinkasso,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:21:31 2015 UTC,"Tips aren't general aside from something like ""do more damage"", which is an essentially useless tip. Which hero(es) have you tried using?  I used a prestiged Iron Man. The point in stating that he was prestiged is because he had a fully levelled legendary. That combined with the massive AoE that he has (missile build) made each sim super easy (including the Venom one). I have also read that Storm of Human Torch would also be easy for this reason, but have only personally done it with Iron Man.  One thing to note though, disable your auto-vacuum for cosmics. I was finding level 20's to be quite difficult before I noticed I had forgotten to put on any items since I was feeding them all to my pet. This solved the ""taking damage"" problem I stupidly created. I had a few close calls because of it."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,MutatedSpleen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:04:53 2015 UTC,"if that's the venom + infected wave just ignore the npcs that you should rescue and kill venom. use your sig, maybe have an active team up if he does more dmg than being inactive."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,tarrach,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:36:05 2015 UTC,Nah. It's the one with the super boss wave. Kind of like the Brotherhood of Mutants but with different villains. Venom just so happens to spawn last and very late.
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,evnstranger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:38:03 2015 UTC,"i think that was quite tight for me as well, i did the holosim-grandmaster with hulk and gungir. either try using your sig as often as you can or use it at the beginning of the wave and later on save it for venom. or try another hero, if your hero has a too long cd in their sig."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,thejynxed,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:35:01 2015 UTC,"A friend and I just did it by starting at one and not dying.  You get to level 12 after like the first couple of waves, and then you get a level or two every time its a ""kill all of these dudes"" wave.  We were level 27-28 by the time we hit wave 30.  It really wasn't a big deal.  Only time we were ever even maybe a little at risk of death was during like the first four waves.  After that, we could have literally sat there and let our team-ups kill stuff and we would have won."
marvelheroes,3bvb2p,thejynxed,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:30:23 2015 UTC,"I took Vision in there at level 1, no gear waiting. Was a bit worried at wave 49 (protect VIPs from Hydra) as I ended that with 2 VIPs left with <10% HP, but other than that I didn't have any issues.  Having a rank 5 Legendary and a lvl 60 teamup would probably make it trivial."

marvelheroes,3buirk,wasdy1,9,Thu Jul 2 23:14:04 2015 UTC,F2P games are the most expensive games to play.
marvelheroes,3buirk,bullintheheather,3,Thu Jul 2 14:04:56 2015 UTC,"They are. It's like the people that have $60,000 worth of items in their Team Fortress 2 backpacks. It's insane how much people pay for a F2P game"
marvelheroes,3buirk,TheMightyWill,11,Fri Jul 3 05:52:54 2015 UTC,"I spent $10 about 3 weeks ago on 3 storage spots and decided I've played enough to pay a bit more and spent $5 on another storage slot.  Just hit 268 hours.  Personally I wouldn't spend any money on heroes, the price is just too damn high for most of them, and costumes are even worse.  Don't really need boosts so I guess I'll just buy an inventory slot once a month."
marvelheroes,3buirk,urbn,3,Thu Jul 2 07:36:48 2015 UTC,The prices are pretty reasonable once they're half off.  Three bucks for a new class would be a steal in other MMO's.
marvelheroes,3buirk,dorn3,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:20:57 2015 UTC,"I said the same thing until I had $40 burning a hole in my wallet. They had the +15% G sale and BOGO sale. I bought like half the roster using this approach because of the randoms.  I have never, however, paid for a costume. On that I refuse by principle."
marvelheroes,3buirk,FenrirIII,5,Thu Jul 2 13:28:09 2015 UTC,"That's so foreign to me. I'm all about well made costumes earning money. It doesn't hurt the pacing of the game (like boosts) is purely cosmetic, and is a solid way to support the developer of a free game I've really come to enjoy.  What principle makes you refuse something like costumes?"
marvelheroes,3buirk,Sidion,0,Thu Jul 2 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"It adds no functionality to the game and is purely cosmetic. For me that is not worth spending money on. I don't buy boosts either. I bought characters because the random hero boxes stopped being ""random"" once I hit 60% of the roster. At that point I bought over 10 RHB and got nothing but dupes."
marvelheroes,3buirk,FenrirIII,9,Thu Jul 2 19:59:13 2015 UTC,"The fact that they're purely cosmetic is normally something people clamor for in cash shops, because it's a way to support the game without gaining an advantage. Now, it's a bit different in this game, because all the things that affect gameplay (team-ups, new heroes) are entirely earnable absolutely for free, but costumes are a good way to donate some cash to the devs, while getting something back for it."
marvelheroes,3buirk,jongiplane,2,Thu Jul 2 21:53:59 2015 UTC,"The way you phrased it had me thinking you had some sort of moral objection to costumes. Not that you didn't see them as having any worth personally.  That being said I'd much rather they made money on costumes (which I feel enrich the game, even if it's just aesthetically) as opposed to other ways they could potentially profit from us."
marvelheroes,3buirk,Sidion,2,Fri Jul 3 00:30:13 2015 UTC,"I really dislike the costume approach.  I understand why they do a full costume to keep with the comics and everything, but I would much rather spend small amounts on micro transactions like Path of Exile where you can buy different pieces (helmet, chest, pants, arms, auras, etc.) at a much lower price and have a much more unique looking hero."

marvelheroes,3buirk,akusb,10,Thu Jul 2 14:29:39 2015 UTC,"Somewhere in the neighborhood of $2500.  I had passed the $2000 mark last time I checked and that was quite a few purchases ago.  Considering I'm coming up on 2200 hours played I'd say it's damn good value for my entertainment dollar.  I like to think there's a server somewhere in their data center with a little gold placque with my name on it, but the truth is I'm not even at the top tier of spender.  There are supposedly folks with twice as much invested.  I have always been a collector of things, so this game is right up my alley, but I'm also an instant gratification sort of person who hates waiting and prefers to pay for convenience, at least as far as basic unlocks are concerned.  I like to buy alternate costumes to get me interested to play other heroes I might not otherwise spend much time with and I love fortune cards both for amassing huge stockpiles of boosts and collecting the rare costumes (though I do prefer the later marks with the currencies as a fallback).  Truth be told, if I had known about BOGO's and free hero boxes and all the sales events, chances are I wouldn't have spent nearly as much as a large part of that cost was the initial roster acquisition, many of which were at full price.  If I had known back in beta how much I was going to love the game I would have been ultimate founder in a heartbeat.  Back in the early 90's I was just getting into Marvel and this game was the kind of thing I wanted more than anything else.  It only took 20 years for that dream to become an actual thing and now that it's here I intend to enjoy our time together to the fullest.  I came from Hellgate London, so I'm just happy to have a server up and running to play on, much less constant events and content updates (and bug fixes!).  If the cost of so much awesome is me over-enthusiastically throwing money at my screen non-stop then so be it.  Bring on Ant Man!"

Other sub games can easily give 60+ hours a month of playtime and cost 10-15 dollars USD, which is much better in terms of entertainment value.  Now, don't get me wrong, it's your money and if you enjoy the game, go for it! In fact, I wish I could spend like you!

marvelheroes,3buirk,Ricky_7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:55:24 2015 UTC,"Started about a month ago, bought the MK2 pack or w/e it was that had all the heroes up to this year plus the personal storage for them and whatnot for 130.    From here out I don't expect to spend a lot, maybe 15-20 a month max if there are specials, I'll treat it basically like a sub game as long as I'm entertained.  I used the 2k Gs that came with it for a team-up to get me started and a few general stash tabs, so I can survive without ever spending anymore if I need to."

marvelheroes,3buirk,satyanjoy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:08:31 2015 UTC,"I've got 110 hours and have spent $65 on it. I've had to establish a rule and now have gotten myself to stop all together (luckily). My rule used to be, I need to have 30 hours more than the money I spend. So lets say I spend $5 on top of $30, I need to have 65 hours. I broke this rule but now have more hours than 95 so it's okay. The reason I had to stop is I was spending money on new characters when I should level up the ones I have. I've got 3 (almost 4 60's) and I still have lower levels (Venom, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Magneto, Rocket Raccoon).   I've also only bought, a couple fortune cards, costumes and heroes, and 2 team ups (Groot and Wasp)."
marvelheroes,3buirk,Daveofborg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:15:43 2015 UTC,"I bought the ultimate pack $199, advance pack 1 deluxe $129 and advance pack 2 deluxe $129... so about $459.  On the one hand it seems like a lot of money to me, I play quite a lot of mobile F2P games and pride myself on being patient and never spending any money on them.  On the other hand, its relatively good value, I have all the heroes including the rest of the ones this year.  I think I won't buy the next advance pack though, assuming they make one, since I have lots of eternity splinters saved up and will use them to buy future heroes."

marvelheroes,3buirk,Evermore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:10:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't spend much on Marvel but i spent around a total of 30-40$ , i think, don't remember exactly how much since it was different discounted bundles back in the day.  If i remember correctly there were 50% or 75% disscount bundles on Steam for Rogue, Magneto and a few others that i bought, mainly because they did not offer the additional costume in those bundles, but extra G's, so i bought more storage space for that currency!  Which is my general advice for this game, don't buy heroes directly if you are short on cash, get more storage space because it becomes very limited after a while."
marvelheroes,3buirk,Kartraith,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:42:44 2015 UTC,"I have spent around $400 between my account and my son's account. We have been playing for around 1.5 years. I have a third account (was for daughter) that no money has been spent on do to lack of use, and it has around 18 characters unlocked in around a years time. If the account was played more it would even have more characters unlocked for free. The only problem with that account is storage space."

If I like it enough to play it for that many hours, Gaz deserves to get some cash from me. I also tend to think about it in terms of hours of entertainment.

But I also spent about half a year with little to do except play (quit a job and decided to go to grad school, haha), and during that time, I played exclusively on the standalone client.  I estimate it to about 800 hours (I was seriously playing at least 8 hours a day damn near every day).  So, I consider myself as having around 2000 hours played.  Oooh boy...  Total of 1181.05 spent on this game.  But that's not so bad for the amount of time I've spent as well.  1181.05/2000 = about $0.60 per hour, which is a much better price than what I'd get from most single player games."

I've had a crush on Elizabeth Olsen since before AOE and Godzilla came out, and what made me start playing Marvel Heroes was the fact that you could play Scarlet Witch and have the AOE (her's) costume. Needless to say, that was the very first thing I bought after picking her to be my first uncap. The rest of the money was spent on STASHes, although I did buy Squirrel Girl for BOGO. I don't see myself spending a ton of money on costumes because I tend to like most of the defaults the most anyway. I regret not buying Aviators Squirrel Girl while it was on BOGO though :("

I normally buy stuff for around 50$ once I really like the game and I know that I wanna play it for a while longer. (at least 100h)  I want around 20-40 cents per hour value.   I wasted around 30$ for league, which I played alot for example. around 50$ for lotro, nothing for path of exile, 15$ on dota2, small amounts but still.

marvelheroes,3buirk,LunasaNL,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:21:26 2015 UTC,"can you actually play the full game for free?   Yes, there isn't playable content locked behind a paywall, and buying artifacts/in-game stuff with store gifting is against the rules.   Do i need to pay money to have a good experience?   The only things that you can buy and will improve your experience are STASH tabs and boosts. I don't recommend buying any boosts besides Odin and, maybe, the Splinter one though, because 1) RNG is RNG and 2) you can farm Cube Shards and use them to buy Fortune Cards.  What is really important in this game is inventory space, so STASH tabs are the best investment if you're planning to play for a long time."

Looking back at slot 1, I had 1 weapon that had about 1.2k damage, and one that had 900 in the top section, then 500 in the lower section, but the top one boosted my ""damage"" by a much larger amount, essentially im looking for some info  on how damage is calculated so I can make better choices for my gear.

marvelheroes,3bvcnt,zylli42,4,Thu Jul 2 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"Slot 1 seems to be exclusively for weapons   Don't try to think of the slots as being specific to any type of item.  Each slot has a pattern to it, but lore for the hero takes priority.  If you use an item for your hero, it will always be the same for the slot.  If you use an any-hero unique, it follows the global pattern.  That doesn't matter, though.  Use whatever best items you have for each slot.  Deadpool is due for a major review in a month or two, so you might want to wait until then to dedicate more time to him.  A lot will likely change, including making his hero-specific uniques fairly powerful."
marvelheroes,3bvcnt,grinr,2,Thu Jul 2 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I quite enjoy him even though he is due to get this review which makes me think he is likely underpowered atm? You think they will take away things like his body slide ability? One of the main skills I like for him due to him being hyper mobile because of it. I know you cant know for sure what would happen during a review but are the changes often that significant that they replace things like that?  Thanks for the info re slots."
marvelheroes,3bvcnt,zylli42,3,Thu Jul 2 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"Deadpool is the weakest hero in the game, so yes you could say he's a bit underpowered.  If you enjoy his mobility, I would recommend you try Psylocke, Doom, Dr. Strange, or Silver Surfer, all of whom have teleporting moves and are very strong.  But if you want the real cheat-mode of the game (including teleports), Scarlet Witch is hands-down the best hero in the game right now.  Like many new players, you're about to discover the glass ceiling Gaz has set up for a majority of the heroes, a barrier called ""endgame.""  Deadpool, along with most heroes, dies instantly in Cosmic Midtown/ICP, red raids, and Genosha.  You'll still be able to muddle through cosmic terminals and stock MM/ICP with Deadpool, but it's going to be painful to try to engage past that.  I'm a huge Deadpool fan, so I've been waiting for him to get the love he deserves for a very long time, but I would encourage you to either keep playing Venom (very strong hero) as your main or one of the others I recommended until Deadpool gets his review."

I basically got venom to 60, lvled Iron man to about 50 (with a friend) then lvled deadpool to 60, ive not tried stepping out of the lvling grind into the ""End game"" bit yet, ive looked at the ""what next"" guide on the sub Reddit but it had a wide variety of stuff to do, I got a legendary on DP and Venom, now im trying to decide what might be the best bet next, any big tips? wanna make DP life easy after the review but also some fun for venom would be good, im also not adverse to just lvling another char if you tell me thats a good thing to do because of X.  I had a quick go of silver surfer and found him quite an intresting change of pace to most arpg chars with his movement based damage, hi low level xdefence clears where stupidly fast, didnt know Scarlet Witch was quite as broken as your saying, defo give one of those a go with my next lot of splinters, thanx for all the advice :D"
marvelheroes,3bvcnt,Mgtl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:56:42 2015 UTC,"A hero's low-level performance is not a reflection of their level 60 performance.  Some heroes get key abilities by level 10 and some, like Psylocke struggle until they get their level 47 ability, then they chew through bosses.  As for Deadpool's review, it isn't likely that they will take anything away that was a core-concept of the hero in comic books.  He will definitely come out much better after the review."
marvelheroes,3bvcnt,trendwitlasers,3,Fri Jul 3 00:57:25 2015 UTC,"If you like deadpool, you can definitely make him work, he just requires a lot more effort and some better gear than other heroes. Also he's going to get reviewed most likely sometime towards the end of August so you won't have to wait all that long for him to be quite strong!  Here's a link to one of his new guns!"

marvelheroes,3byuc0,AlwaysFuckingSalty,10,Fri Jul 3 07:43:27 2015 UTC,Well i think the better point is that the major subreddits shutting down will sting hard with the message the parties concerned are trying to make.   A fairly small gaming subreddit probably wont make much difference.
marvelheroes,3byuc0,Dirk_8,4,Fri Jul 3 10:33:12 2015 UTC,I like that you're the reasonable one with that name.
marvelheroes,3byuc0,AlwaysFuckingSalty,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:13:05 2015 UTC,I have my moments.  [edit] asshole.
marvelheroes,3byuc0,MarvelHero,2,Fri Jul 3 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"Just some random thoughts from me on this matter:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect  I honestly must say that I'm kinda torn on this. First off, the statement ""probably won't make much difference"" should never be accepted as a valid reason for not acting, at least not by itself.  2nd: No matter how few, we do draw people in. Anything that contributes to a beast/site/whatever actually is partly responsible, no matter how minute the degree. Owning our involvement at our respective levels should always be something to be looked at warmly, even if we cringe while doing so.  3rd: I have a separate account just for this sub, simply bc this sub has always seemed to remain largely separated from reddit as a whole. So, I'm feeling at least a little hypocritical no matter which way I start to find myself leaning.  4th: Maybe it wouldn't be such a completely horrible idea if the mods just maybe wanted to prep a possible set-up elsewhere? With the average attention span of most redditors however, this may be overkill I admit.  5th: Do we really expect all of this to make a difference? If we don't, then what/where/when, if ever, should we place our focus/efforts?  6th: Do we want change? Indifference? Or just simple abandonment for something hopefully better?  7th: I do applaud the mods for at least leaving this posts up (although 1 would suffice, no need for 2 posts, but so long as it isn't swarmed by such posts (which would just complicate things on all ends), I see no real issue (from the # of posts right now).  8th: I'm sure many redditors use the same account for this sub and all others. Therefore, it can be more easily understood that these comments are likely to keep coming. (I keep my crap separate just to keep random people from interfering with something I find enjoyable).  9th: When users complain about sub-reddit design (it happens, although rarely), they should know that this is partly the reason behind this ""black-out"". Mods need more love generally. From skimming things, I noticed how Pao said something like she hired 5/6 guys to help out, and I'm comparing that number in my head to the much greater # of all the mods all over reddit; kinda like spitting on a fire (i.e. just for show). Want more features here in this sub? Don't blame the mods, look at the admins.  10th: To not see what's been happening with reddit (I've been around on many accounts for possibly far too long at this point :(    ), is a part of the problem. Even if we don't go ""dark"", then I'm thankful that we at least are able to discuss this here, as well as in each and every sub that follows suit. Knowledge is power!   Last thoughts: I'm just waiting for the admins to man-up honestly and change their motto ""The Front Page Billboard of the Internet"". General reddit content has been going down-hill for some time now (sure, there's still some surprises, but they are few). Celebrity worship has grown, and been encouraged (from some pretty heavy tampering I personally believe,,, that or there's just been a significant influx of users with drastically lower IQs). I think if you've been around close to a year, then this should be very obvious, especially over the last 1/2 year.  I'm very f'ing big on freedom of speech. So long as we can talk, and things are fairly listened to on all sides, then I'll do my best to stick things out. However, bans and post removals have gotten a bit crazy (3 of my accounts have been shadow-banned just over the last week). There can be reasons to shadowban, but it's simply being abused. Just bc you don't like what someone says is never a reason.  At this point voat.co has at least gained my curiosity, but it seems they need some more servers if things are going to go best for them (I checked it out awhile back but it was pretty dead then).   Some subs not going dark can be a good thing however, especially if they do allow these talks to continue. Personally, I'm just waiting for now, while doing a little on the side/from other accounts. Although, I think I'll just let my other names go dark for today, for what little good that may or may not do. Opinions/facts have been stated, now it is mostly time for knowledge dispersal. I think if nothing else, that should definitely be a priority right now.    Quick edit: We go our ways and re-start so many times in life. Imagine if we didn't! And if you're equally as torn about leaving (I still haven't quite made up my mind yet), please don't let silly karma stand in your way! So, you have thousands of karma...are you truly capable of doing it again, then again, then again? And, on what merits? If so, morally, then you have absolutely nothing to fear!  I'm not advocating anything at this point but the spread of knowledge. I'll admit, it may sound as if I'm speaking against this entire site. I'm not, just a very, very f'ing large portion of it. Would be very hard for any reasonable person to totally ignore everything currently going on."

Why did she leave reddit so abruptly?  The short answer: no-one, excluding a select few of the administrative team, knows precisely why /u/chooter[51]  was removed as an admin, and that will almost certainly continue to be the case until the admins get their house in order: both parties are at being professional in that they aren't talking about the reasons why it occurred."

It is there to turn a profit for it's owners.  Nothing more or less.    Reddit could vanish right now this second and it wouldn't mean anything to me or my life in general.  This woman got fired for something that would get anyone fired from their jobs.    /discussion"

What is going on is a form of protest.  You are correct that the company has a right to screw itself up and ruin their business.  That is exactly what they are doing.  However, out of a love for the site, some of us have taken to protesting these actions to let our voice be heard so that the company can have the opportunity to change if it wants to keep us around.  These blackouts won't be permanent, and they shouldn't be.  They are a sign from the moderators and the users that actually make this site run that they do not like the way that things are going, and want to see a change to the positive.  We cannot force Reddit to do anything.  They can continue down the path that they are going, and we can all leave.  It's happened before on other site.  Most of the current userbase are ex-digg users that migrated after their colossal screw ups.    Don't like what I have to say - that's your prerogative, I can't force you to accept what I have to say, and I wouldn't want to.  Differing opinions are what make this site great.  When the opinions no longer differ, and when political correctness and ad revenue take spot light from free speech then this site is no longer what it was meant to be when it started, and Reddit has failed itself.    This site was created by and for the community.  When the community no longer has the ability to create, the community leaves."

What is going on is a form of protest.   No?  Really?    You think the people in charge of reddit give 2 drops of piss about these blackouts?  They aren't stupid, they know it won't last for the exact same reason they are happening.  The people running these subreddits, the people protesting, and the people complaining about this silly topic are all reddit addicts.  They don't have to do a single thing to end these blackouts.  They will allow the temper tantrum to subside and everything will return to normal.   Most of the current userbase are ex-digg users that migrated after their colossal screw ups.   Yeah, I know.  And like I said, this site doesn't matter because a new option will always popup.     Don't like what I have to say   You are the one that went on the attack against me.  This has nothing to do with whether or not I like what you are saying.  I 100% understand what you are saying and I have no problem with it.    My issue is that it is all completely and utterly pointless.   When the opinions no longer differ, and when political correctness and ad revenue take spot light from free speech then this site is no longer what it was meant to be when it started, and Reddit has failed itself.   You seem to think this site existed for a reason other than to make a revenue for the owner.  Sorry man, while I appreciate your point of view, that simply isn't the case.  There will never be a site with this size of user base whose primary objective isn't to make that all important dollar.  Plus you are forgetting something very important.

marvelheroes,3bss6f,BurnedOut_ITGuy,10,Wed Jul 1 21:17:11 2015 UTC,"I trade a lot here are the best tips.    Don't be in a rush to trade. Be available.  Have a price in mind and be somewhat firm with that price. Advertise consistently, if you were really asking for 5 gotks, I'm sure if you put WTT SWGN 5 gotk it would have been gone in an instant during peak hours~ 5pm-11pm EST.  Know when it is time to trade.  Right now in general isn't the best time to trade artifacts thanks to double cosmic loot.  SWGNs are also not in high demand due to the last couple heroes not being physical.   It is really hit and miss depending on who is on and who is looking at trade chat.  I think the best way to go about trading is just being super clear what you are expecting when posting in chat.  WTT SWGN for 5 gotk would probably have it gone pretty quick.  WTT SWGN PM Offer probably wont because im less likely to impulse buy that."
marvelheroes,3bss6f,AnnieIsMyGirl,2,Wed Jul 1 22:29:16 2015 UTC,yeap. patience is the key. you can get away with murder if the person wants it badly enough
marvelheroes,3bss6f,weltschmerz79,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:16:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, these are some great tips."
marvelheroes,3bss6f,Oshiba,5,Thu Jul 2 00:56:25 2015 UTC,Patience is the best virtue when trading items. You might go a week with only low ball and idiot offers but eventually a serious buyer will come along. Being patient pays off literally. Taking the first offer you get is almost always a bad idea. I had a 1k/1k Tony Stark insig for almost a month. Most everyone laughed at me ect ect. Ended up trading it for 3 Gotk which is far better then the credits at the vendor. There are also a few scum bag traders you should avoid that purposely take advantage of new traders. SinnerG is a great example of this. Lastly make sure you educate yourself of trade values. If you are uninformed you are pretty much asking to get ripped off. Knowledge is power. If you know an items worth you can weed out the low ball offers and veterans trying to scam you.
marvelheroes,3bss6f,VictorVonCuddles,2,Wed Jul 1 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"Surturs are trading for the same value as swgn's lately. You did not get ripped off. Surturs rune value has been rising foir the past four weeks or so, although it may cap out around this value. It's hard to argue with the cost, since FOT is bis for nearly every hero."
marvelheroes,3bss6f,-Airia-,2,Thu Jul 2 12:18:35 2015 UTC,"After taking people's advice to list a price, I was able to trade the Surtur for 4 GOTKs.  I was happy w/that price."

In a game like this where there is no real set currency (One could argue that a Blessing is like a $1, a GOK a $10, a SWGN like a $20, etc), I found the best way to get what I've needed is to be willing to pay a bit more for it and instead of rigidly thinking ""Item X is worth Y"" instead I look at it as ""Item X is worth VASTLY more to me than item Y""  I could care less if I'm technically giving up on some of an item's ""value""...if I really need a certain artifact and I have something to offer I'm not using, that's how I make my trade decisions."
marvelheroes,3bss6f,fragh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:31:49 2015 UTC,"Patients is best, and mild flexibility. Obviously you won't be able to trade something for EXACTLY what you want but with the right additives or adjustments you can get pretty close."
marvelheroes,3bss6f,sodabreux,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:36:33 2015 UTC,"One tip I'd give is checking within your SG first. When you're in a group together, you tend to help each other out a lot. Once I gave one of my SG-mates a set of Loki runes, nothing in return. Another time someone gave me a Sutur for a mediocre and a low-end GoK. (edit: this was pre-stark cube, when suturs were actually worth something). You're always gonna get the best deals within your supergroup. Unless you decide to spend your time preying on noobs who don't know the worth of what they're trading. Which is kinda lame."
marvelheroes,3bss6f,kiyouri,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"Well depending on the rolls of the SWGN, your standards may not be the same as others. Also when you say 4-5 goks, people usually don't trade that many GoKs. GoKs are a price gauge that people use to rate the value, but in reality they trade something that is easier. So 5 goks would instead be 2 HoDs and a GoK or a Zola and a GoK. Also the trader normally is the one that loses profit or goes even on the trade(unless you are not willing to settle)."
marvelheroes,3bss6f,ProfJackAss,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:25:53 2015 UTC,"First is knowing what things are worth.  If you traded a SWGN (4-6goks) for a Surtur rune (2-3goks) then this is the first thing you need to learn.  Second thing you need to learn is that the in game trade chats are small.  If you don't get a bite you should log out for a few minutes, then log back in to get into a new one.  Third thing you need to know is that ""well rolled"" doesn't mean anything.  If an artifact isn't high rolled most of the real traders or hardcore players won't want it enough to offer anymore than they would for a low rolled item.  People will make the argument for ""mid or well rolled"" items but they really aren't worth anymore than an item that needs to be rerolled to the vast majority of people.  Last thing you need to know is that the official forums item trading section is where you want to list high rolled artifacts to get the best price possible for them.  Just make sure to track them and keep them updated."
marvelheroes,3bss6f,ProfJackAss,2,Wed Jul 1 21:53:55 2015 UTC,Ugh.  I had no idea the trade for the Surtur was that unfair.  I seem to have a knack for getting gypped in trades.  I traded an Advanced Spider serum for a single GOTK a while back.  I have tried posting SWGN w/a price and got absolutely no bites at all which is why I traded it for the Surtur in the first place.  I had hopes the Surtur would move quicker.
marvelheroes,3bss6f,ProfJackAss,3,Wed Jul 1 22:57:45 2015 UTC,People are sick of trying to come to a deal with people that list stuff without prices.  Unless it is an item I am absolutely in need of right now or a brand new item I won't bother replying to people listing without a price.  https://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/135118/list-of-artifacts-runes-insigs-current-ongoing-prices-and-trading-courtesy/p1  This is a nice general guideline of item values.  You should also watch the trade forums to see more current prices.  If you wanted 5 GoKs for that SWGN you'd likely have gotten it had you listed the price.

marvelheroes,3bqi24,carnageraiser,-4,Wed Jul 1 18:34:12 2015 UTC,There's a huge difference between pushing content back based on priorities and what marvel wants in their game and then not releasing content based on a moral alignment and integrity of the characters they want their players to have access to be playable.
marvelheroes,3bqi24,dkphxcyke,5,Wed Jul 1 20:59:33 2015 UTC,"Most of what the devs said on Carnage was ""he won't be a hero because he's never been a good guy.""

Marvel is becoming more and more about synergy between everything they do and the characters they're pushing (Re: Sam as Nova instead of Richard Ryder).  Considering Carnage is getting a comic, they might want him to get more attention in other media which he's lacked due to the amount of set up required and the average age of the intended audience.  So its not unrealistic that they'd push him for this game, though if his comic is all about him being an insane murderer (which doesn't sound like an interesting story premise), then he'll probably be added to the game as a One-Shot Villain.  In which case, PLEASE let it be a Maximum Carnage One-Shot!"

marvelheroes,3bphdm,jakubmarley,6,Wed Jul 1 02:43:17 2015 UTC,"That's a problem I have.  So there is no DR, or auto failover?  No load balancing?"
marvelheroes,3bphdm,DurdensWrath,7,Wed Jul 1 02:48:04 2015 UTC,I was thinking the exact same thing. They arent using clustering/load balancing? Perhaps they are but there was an issue with the root structure.  But also they should have some auto-failover hot servers set up. With all the money we give them you think this wouldnt be too much of a problem since each server prob only costs like 4 grand IF that.
marvelheroes,3bphdm,DurdensWrath,3,Wed Jul 1 03:25:08 2015 UTC,"So I'm assuming it is an Active-Passive setup.   If it were Active-Active, it would have failed over, and nobody would have noticed, except maybe a minute or two outage.  But it appears not only Active-Passive, but that the passive side doesn't have a heartbeat setup.  So the Passive doesn't get constant updates in real time from the Active server.  I say that because they said themselves they're manually copying things."

marvelheroes,3bphdm,DurdensWrath,3,Wed Jul 1 03:23:19 2015 UTC,"You would think that as a company that is purely based on data they would have a better redundancy in place. Transferring to another server is not really a good method and can often lead to a lot of data loss and even more agitated customers.  To me it seems like this whole thing could have been averted if they had a system capable of automatically keeping backups of all data across multiple servers, similar to how dropbox works, and had their systems automatically re-route their customers, much like how most online businesses work. But that's just me."

If it's only 3 minutes per week then we would still have an availability of mid 99%'s, which is still good. If that were per day then yeah, that would be horrible availability.  Edit: Sorry, my math is horrible.   SLA level of 99.6 % uptime/availability gives following periods of potential downtime/unavailability:  Daily: 5m 45.6s Weekly: 40m 19.2s Monthly: 2h 55m 19.0s Yearly: 1d 11h 3m 47.8s"
marvelheroes,3bphdm,Venrexx,2,Wed Jul 1 03:47:13 2015 UTC,"No sorry.  Not 3 minutes of downtime.  3 minutes of data.  Which means that their replication scheme is quite poor.

marvelheroes,3bny6q,C_L_I_C_K,8,Tue Jun 30 19:17:06 2015 UTC,15-20% damage nerf. Thanks Gaz. I love their new tuning philosophy so far. Keep dem nerfs coming!   /s
marvelheroes,3bny6q,Arcades,6,Tue Jun 30 20:47:52 2015 UTC,"It really is complete crap, isn't it?  It's not like Iceman was god tier either..."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,C_L_I_C_K,4,Tue Jun 30 20:53:17 2015 UTC,"I just tested my summoner Iceman on the high health dummy. I got a 6 minute TTK, when before this nerf, I used to get a 5 minute average, sometimes getting slightly lower than 5 minutes. They nerfed summoner Iceman hard for no reason, when summoner Doom will still be able to get 4-5 minute TTKs, even with his nerfs."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,C_L_I_C_K,7,Tue Jun 30 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"He was a top tier, top 5 hero. He was at a very good place. At least his summoner spec was. He wasn't god tier like Doom and SW. With this ridiculous nerf, I'm not sure where he'll be. Maybe upper mid tier or bottom top tier. It's all subjective anyway.   Gaz randomly nerfs and buffs without explaining their reasoning behind any of it. This has caused confusion and frustration to the playerbase. Nobody wants to fully commit to gearing heroes, buying costumes, or using ult upgrade tokens, when they're unsure if their favorite hero is going to be getting nerfed or not."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,Userlicious,2,Tue Jun 30 20:58:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair SW is only god tier for her amazing kit (tp, heal, bonus damage on top of vuln, not too squishy) she had an amazing re-work, let's not forget how crappy she was.   All heroes need the same love she recieved, they'll get it in time and we'll all be happy.  But people will still complain."

She was god tier back then when the game was cosmic terminal/xdef runs, meh tier along with all the ""older"" heroes when Cosmic Midtown/ICP and raids were added, and god tier again since her rework, which funnily enough happened rather fast...some older heroes still lack their first 52 review...  She definetly has had more time in the sunlight than any other char in the game bar the utmost latest additions."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,Ultrace-7,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:53:13 2015 UTC,"If a single change to a single power can do so much to a character's standing, doesn't it seem like that power has too much influence on builds?"
marvelheroes,3bny6q,C_L_I_C_K,3,Wed Jul 1 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Are you implying that the aura was overpowered? Because it wasn't. It didn't deserve to be nerfed, especially not by as much as it did.  What it actually means is that Gaz doesn't actually test their nerfs or buffs. They let players ""test"" patches on TC for a few days, don't listen to the feedback and make adjustments, and just push it to live. They did this time and time again. I always use the most egregious example where they quadruple nerfed Silver Surfer's EMF down to worthlessness. 9-10 months later (now), they are finally buffing it back up. They didn't listen to testers back then and haven't listened to testers since. And when the nerf is so bad that it destroys an entire build or hero, they just turn a blind eye and ignore it for weeks, months.  I just hope Gaz does the right thing this time and unfuck what they fucked up with Iceman. Their track record doesn't give me much hope, however."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,satsujin_akujo,-1,Wed Jul 1 06:22:49 2015 UTC,"Well he is/was the only hero i could take into Cosmic patrols freshly minted...solo, etc.  Whatever they did to thing has completely fucked my ability to play cosmic all the sudden. Im done purchasing until they figure their shit out."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,RustyJoe89,2,Tue Jun 30 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"Iceman is my summoner main, and now I might have to shelve him. First they came for SG, RR, and Iceman. Now it'll be Doom's turn. :/"
marvelheroes,3bny6q,C_L_I_C_K,11,Tue Jun 30 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"They nerfed summoners to a point where most people don't even play them. Then they came out of left field with a 25% buff to all summons' damage. People started playing summoners again and loved it. A few weeks later, they're nerfing summoners again. This is Gaz's new tuning philosophy. Nerf, buff, nerf, buff, nerf nerf nerf."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,GreatMadWombat,6,Tue Jun 30 20:56:00 2015 UTC,"I came back for the 2year anniversary. Tried out RR, LOVED it, bought Iceman with ES on the ""One summoner is good, two will be better"" logic. Was so happy with the two of them that I bought them both skins, and then bought the Doom bundle.   I was expecting the Doom nerf. The Doom nerf was understandable. That said? I had specifically gotten the cool skins for Rocket and Iceman(AoA and his Spacesuit skin, respectively), so if Doom DID get a hammer, the other summoners would still look awesome.  I honestly didn't see a Rocket/Iceman nerf coming, and feel sad now."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,C_L_I_C_K,-1,Tue Jun 30 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's absolutely retarded how they ""tune"" or ""balance"" heroes. None of it makes any sense and they don't explain anything.   I just tested my summoner Iceman on the high health dummy. I got a 6 minute TTK, when before this nerf, I used to get a 5 minute average. They nerfed summoner Iceman hard for no reason, when summoner Doom will still be able to get 4-5 minute TTKs, even with his nerfs."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,Userlicious,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:26:27 2015 UTC,"The nerf IS harsh, but they were pulling low 4 minute ttks (rr and doom).. Plus I think I read that the stacking auras were gonna get fixed somewhere like a month ago."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,xploited13,4,Tue Jun 30 22:13:16 2015 UTC,"Worst part is that everyone is convinced they're buffing more than nerfing. If you look at the line items, yes, that's true. But if you look at the effective tier of the heroes after changes, very few are going up, while many are being taken down."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,C_L_I_C_K,4,Wed Jul 1 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"Yup. The other ""worst part"" is that we've got a ton of fanboys and Gaz whiteknights who constantly defend them and say that they're buffing more than nerfing. They pretend like Doomsaw never said things like ""We strongly prefer buffs and generally have a “buff only” philosophy,"" which is a straight up lie.   I made a thread right before the patch hit today and it got downvoted to hell by all of the whiteknights and trolls on this subreddit, talking about this very thing. If the majority of the playerbase is too casual, stupid, and/or ignorant to realize that Gaz's ""tuning philosophy"" hasn't been working the way they promised so far, then this game is screwed. I'm still holding out a bit of hope that they stop the nerfs and start actually balancing heroes and buffing everyone to ""top tier"" like they said they would.   I'm still pissed at what they did to summoner Iceman though. It was unwarranted and uncalled for."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,sirius017,-4,Wed Jul 1 04:35:56 2015 UTC,"Let's look at some cold hard facts here, there's what 50 heros and countless play styles and types of builds. While some of the so called nerfs add 30 seconds or even a whole minute to some older builds, it's the end of the world right? That and its only been three weeks to a month of tuning with plenty more to come. It's simple..either you adapt and perhaps try something else, keep playing the same way as most of the so called nerfs have almost no weight unless you raid hardcore every day on only that one hero and will not try anyone one of the heros. Or, voice your opinion and truly submit a reason as too why what the devs have done to make the hero just unplayable in a respectful way..or simply quit. I would love to see some of the people that call nerf at every single change try to do better in this amount of time and please a considerable amount of the players."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,C_L_I_C_K,6,Wed Jul 1 06:44:29 2015 UTC,"Not even sure what you're getting at or what your point is. Nobody said anything about it's the end of the world in regards to the nerfs. Certainly not me. Stop being dramatic or making shit up.   1 minute nerf is equivalent to 15-20% damage nerf. That's significant, especially on a hero (Iceman) that wasn't ridiculously OP like Doom or SW. Iceman was in a good place and a top tier hero. Now, he's worse than middle of the pack when half the roster are getting 5-5:30 TTKs on high health dummy. He's getting 6 minutes now. That's lower mid tier / upper bottom tier. Again, this goes against Gaz's own stated philosophy of rarely nerfing and nerfing only when they have to, as well as trying to bring every hero up to 'top tier.'  It's not about adapting. It's about balancing, which Gaz doesn't have the best track record at doing. It's not the players' responsibility to have to constantly 'adapt' to Gaz's random nerfs. It's Gaz's responsibility to make sure that their nerfs are properly executed and done with careful thought and testing. I wouldn't mind nerfs nearly as much if Gaz gave us the ability to get a full refund on ilvl 80 Legendaries, ultimate upgrades, runewords, challenge bonuses, etc. But they don't. They just expect people to deal with the nerfs and pretend like everything's fine.  It's the whiteknights and Gaz fanboys like you who are the problem with this game. Your attitude is ""Don't like it? Don't play it. Just adapt or quit."" This is what has gotten this game's balance completely out of whack in the first place and making people quit the game or taking really long breaks. Ridiculous power creep and a disgusting variance of power with heroes that ranges from sub 4 minute TTKs all the way up to 11+ minutes."

Fight alongside Sam and his trusted falcon ally Redwing as they carry on the Captain America legacy!  BUG FIXES Fixed Achievement progress not updating in the Achievements panel while logged into the game.  Fixed an issue with how self-damaging effects (such as Psionic Overload or Ziggurat of Kargul) were being calculated. These effects will no longer scale with or be affected by any other stats than Health.  Fixed an issue preventing the Ringed Ruby of Raggadorr’s Spirit recovery on enemy defeat from functioning.  Fixed an issue preventing Moonstone Shard from regenerating certain resource types other than Spirit.  Fixed an issue with Rogue's stolen Juggernaut power causing her model to scale up on activation.  Fixed a bug which would prevent clicking on some elements in the Cinematics Panel on the Login screen after changing resolution or Fullscreen/Windowed mode.  Mr. Hyde's leap attack will no longer redirect during the jump portion.  Fixed tooltip displaying an incorrect orb healing reduction % on Omega node Alien Symbiote in Human Augmentation.  Fixed Thing's Guess What Time It Is? failing to stop movement on activation (Ben occasionally enjoys figure skating in Rockefeller Center, but it makes less sense when he’s standing on pavement).  Fixed an issue with Ultimate power tooltips displaying “next rank” information when viewed from the hotbar.  Fixed an issue that allowed use of Pom-Poms outside of hub areas.  Fixed various text errors in G.L.F. mission descriptions.  TUNING CORNER Several tuning changes are included in week's patch:  Thor  Spinning Strike - now has execute affix, will no longer slide during animation. Odinforce - now grants 5% more damage to all powers while imbued. The Anti-Force - spirit cost removed, critical damage rating replaced with critical damage percent Bring the Thunder - duration increased to 8s. Fixed an issue that caused Odinforce to decay while he was still standing in hotspot. Rolling Thunder - duration increased to 8s. For Asgard! - duration and cooldown both decreased by 16% so the cooldown can line up with his Signature at 50 ranks. Fixed an issue in which his health on hit proc did not have an internal cooldown. Asgardian Smite - slight increase to base damage.  Human Torch  Fuel for the Flame - added damage rating vs burning targets, critical hit rating, and brutal strike rating. Flame On - added 20% increased critical hit and brutal strike chance while active. Scattering Blaze - converted to a pure DoT power, duration increased to 8s. Scorching Pyre - duration increased to 8s. Incinerating Blast - damage now scales with attack speed and gains 10% bonus damage per DoT on affected enemies. Base damage slightly reduced as a result of above buffs. Power can no longer be beam weaved Homing Flares - also gains 10% bonus damage per DoT on affected enemies. Thermal Intensity - damage rating while standing in fire hotspots now extends for 10s, so Johnny no longer needs to stay inside the hotspot to gain its benefits.  Silver Surfer  Electromagnetic Flux - base damage increased and has new affix that grants +25% damage to targets affected by Subspace Rift, Deconstruction, and Event Horizon (75% max). The damage bonus from ramping up now persists for 5s after channeling ends, allowing Surfer time to move and cast his supplementary powers. Particle Burst - base damage increased, bosskiller replaced with affix that grants +50% damage to targets affected by Subspace Rift, Deconstruction, and Event Horizon (150% max). Event Horizon - radius increased, but is no longer affected by Power Duration. Colossus  Crushing Smite - base damage greatly increased, cooldown increased to 6s.  Titanic Slam - base damage increased, cooldown decreased to 7s.  Taskmaster  Anti-Heroic Charge - the 10% damage negation affix has been migrated to Flawless Emulation, with each proc now granting 10%. Dr. Doom and Rocket Raccoon  Dr. Doom's Latverian Doombots and Rocket Raccoon's Time Warp Turret will no longer deal explosion damage if they are manually re-summoned. They will only deal explosion damage if defeated by an enemy.  Dr. Doom's Latverian Air Defense and Rocket Raccoon's Battery Specialization will now give bonus damage equal to 25% of Summoned Ally Damage.  Iceman  Iceman's Ice Golem snowy aura no longer stacks when affecting the same enemy (this only affects Construct Focus, which can have 3 Golems out at the same time).  Iceman will now summon all 3 Golems at once with Construct Focus.  Thing  His Fantastic Friend powers are intended to be relatively close in tuning, allowing the player to choose whichever one suits their style. However, that is not the case on live, so we are bumping Yancy Street Gang down and the others up:  Hammer Time, Stretch! - base damage increased. Let's Roll, Suzie! - base damage increased. Quit It, Hothead! - DoT duration increased to 8s.  Yancy Street Gang - base damage decreased (damage was too high as a result of several factors including the global buff of all summon powers, even though this power is not a summon in the sense that it inherits Thing's own stats. We apologize for allowing it to ship in this overtuned state).  Wolverine  Wolverine’s hero-specific Uniques have been reviewed by @amthua and adjusted accordingly."

marvelheroes,3bny6q,trendwitlasers,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:34:12 2015 UTC,Rocket's summoning was massively buffed recently. What are you talking about?
marvelheroes,3bny6q,acousticronin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:57:55 2015 UTC,"He's an average hero.  His summoner ttk was largely based on bug abuse which people can't even use in cosmic patrols / raids because it involves standing on top of the bosses the entire time.  So you take away the bug abuse and he has an average tier ttk.  They fixed the bug . . . ok, that's fine.  On top of fixing the bug they nerfed his only high damage skill by a huge percentage.  That's just blind."
marvelheroes,3bny6q,alare,-7,Wed Jul 1 11:20:43 2015 UTC,Saw Doom mentioned and preemptively winced in anticipation of a nerf only to find LAD got a buff?  Righteous!  NINJA EDIT: also really excited to see about wolverines uniques!

marvelheroes,3bpwsx,darin617,10,Wed Jul 1 05:01:28 2015 UTC,I held on to 275 slices from the first anniversary and used them this go-around. It would be likely people do the same with leftovers this year.

marvelheroes,3bpwsx,Bronzino,5,Thu Jul 2 01:34:53 2015 UTC,You can put them in your stash until the next big ten or event that drops cake.

marvelheroes,3bpwsx,asylum101,2,Wed Jul 1 13:25:18 2015 UTC,Big 10 events don't drop the cakes. It's only the anniversary period (annually) that gets them enabled.   Just for clarification so people don't think that the next time big 10 comes around (usually every 3-4months) that cakes will drop.
marvelheroes,3bpwsx,dkphxcyke,-5,Wed Jul 1 17:57:22 2015 UTC,I've seen events where the cake came back.
marvelheroes,3bpwsx,Andromansis,8,Wed Jul 1 18:34:10 2015 UTC,I'm 100% certain the only times that cakes have been back and droppable  are during the anniversaries. So I have no idea what events you're confused with.
marvelheroes,3bpwsx,dkphxcyke,2,Wed Jul 1 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"Not yet But I think its ending on thursday, midnight. Also, what they did last year though, was leave the anniversary vendor up for like a week after the event had ended."
marvelheroes,3bpwsx,Mandroll,-7,Wed Jul 1 09:24:42 2015 UTC,whats the point of leaving the vendor if the only thing you can buy is the cake? unless the cakes still drop...
marvelheroes,3bpwsx,asylum101,8,Wed Jul 1 13:26:25 2015 UTC,"People could be unable to login for the last day or two of the event and may be stuck with enough cake slices to redeem for a cake. Better to let them redeem them than have to wait a year. It's why we have ARMOR, Cosmic, etc vendors out even when the events aren't live."

marvelheroes,3boryd,fireman451,-2,Tue Jun 30 23:51:31 2015 UTC,anychance you can ask who ever is in charge of power changes to see if blackwidow can get her widows bite power back ? it is a complete lore breaker that it was removed :-(
marvelheroes,3boryd,Shadozer,0,Tue Jun 30 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"It wasn't removed. The power that was called ""Widow's bite"" was renamed (a long time ago) to Stinging Shot, because ""Widow's Bite"" is also what they called her slot 1 gear item.  To avoid confusion they renamed it.  That said, the power has gone through a lot of changes since launch, and is quite different than it was.  I loved the way it functioned at launch, but I guess a lot of other people didn't.  Its functionality has changed a few times since then. Now it is very different."
marvelheroes,3boryd,Dysc,2,Wed Jul 1 02:08:39 2015 UTC,Black Widow is basically an entirely new hero at this point then compared at launch.
marvelheroes,3boryd,Shadozer,2,Wed Jul 1 13:49:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  She is very different.    Some of the changes were good, some not so good.  Stealth was a really nice addition, though."
marvelheroes,3boryd,Shadozer,0,Thu Jul 2 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"stinging shot and widows bite are two different moves she had, one was a knockdown (stinging shot) and the other was a hold down the key and fire move. they kept stinging shot and turned it into a chain lighting type of move. research."
marvelheroes,3boryd,Stelcio,3,Thu Jul 2 17:04:49 2015 UTC,"No.  You are mixing up two different powers.  The one where you held the key down and kept firing was ""Stinging Barrage"".  In her recent rework they decided to make the barrage come from pistols instead of her wrist weapon, so it was renamed to ""Bullet Barrage"".  ""Stinging Shot"" was the rename of the Widow's bite power since, as I said, the weapons itself is called ""Widow's Bite"" in the game.  As the name suggests it fired a single ""shot"" which did damage and Knockdown.  They then changed it, removed the knockdown and increased the damage (in an attempt to increase her damage output).  With her recent rework they changed it to a chain lightning type of attack. The knockdown was re-added, but does not scale in duration like it originally did.     As for research, I didn't really need to, since I was there, but...  http://marvelheroes.wikia.com/wiki/Closed_Beta_Build_1.0.2470.0  First row under ""Character Changes"":  ""Black Widow: Renamed ‘Widow's Bite’ to ‘Stinging Shot’.""  Also check here for the information of her recent rework, including Stinging Shot and Stinging Barrage:  https://forums.marvelheroes.com/post/quote/192280/Comment_2451085  ""Stinging Shot - Updated with a new animation and visuals. Widow’s Bite as a weapon should be a more useful power in the kit, so we’re allowing it to serve as a potent ranged area clearing power by way of bouncing between targets hit.""  As I said, I liked the original design of the power myself. It was one of my favorites so I was aware when they made the name change.  I disliked the first change they made that removed the knockdown, and I stopped using the power.  Now it doesn't even resemble the original power...other than it does knockdown again."

marvelheroes,3bqlmq,zylli42,2,Wed Jul 1 20:40:38 2015 UTC,Some might.  The Mavericks doesn't care.  There are enough members that you will be able to do the raids you are geared for.

Are these all taking place in the same universe?  And most importantly...would this be a good place for someone new to comics to start reading?

I'm still pissed about a female Thor, though, especially as someone who loves the original mythology even more than the Marvel adaptation.  Double Edit: Just saw the goddamned Spider-Mobile in one of the images, and the female Star Lord. Yeah. I definitely quit Marvel Comics. Here's what pisses me off: It's great that they're trying to attract women to comics. But for fuck's sake, create some good, original female characters instead of just re-appropriating old ones. It's fucking cheap. First, it says you're too lazy to think of good female heroes, period. Second, it says you don't think original female heroes can attract an audience,  but require the name of a famous MALE hero to sell.

marvelheroes,3bnoyp,RedeemingVices,3,Wed Jul 1 02:53:25 2015 UTC,"The women being established characters doesn't change the fact that the move is cheap and demeaning to both male and female readers. It says women can't be interesting unless given the monikers of famous male heroes, and it says that the feelings of Marvel's loyal readers, who care about and are attached to their icons, don't matter. So, effectively, they are giving the middle finger to their established male fans as well as the women they're trying to attract and/or please. As I said, the right thing to do would be to create strong, original female heroes, not change established icons."
marvelheroes,3bnoyp,MutatedSpleen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"So what's your solution, then?  Make new and interesting female heroes and try to sell them?  What happens when that fails?  ""Oh, well I guess they just weren't good enough"" and we end up back in the same position we're in now.  Seriously, name a recent superhero who is totally new, completely unique and wasn't taking over a famous moniker from another hero.  The last totally unique hero I can think of that has any sort of recognizability outside of seriously dedicated comic fans is X-23, and that was 12 years ago, and honestly, even that's a stretch.  Seriously, name one strong, original hero from recent years.  Name one hero who came out recently who can attract mainstream readers and sell comics.  The only way this says anything bad about women or Marvel readers is if you personally choose to believe it does.  Jane Foster taking over the identity of Thor doesn't demean Thor, it doesn't demean Jane Foster, and it doesn't demean any of us.  It's character progression.  I don't understand how putting a woman behind the identity of one of the biggest stars in the Marvel Universe is demeaning to either male or female readers.  I absolutely don't understand at all how Marvel incorporating female superheroes into their universe is ""giving the middle finger to their established male fans"".  Unless you're saying that men can't enjoy female superheroes, which would obviously be absurd.  This whole thing seems like one big knee-jerk reaction so something that isn't that big of a deal.  It sounds like a bunch of immature boys complaining that their parents are telling them to let their sister play too."
marvelheroes,3bnoyp,RedeemingVices,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:54:32 2015 UTC,"So, let's get this straight . . . when women complain that they can't relate to a hero because it's a male, they have a valid point, because poor women, right? But when a dude (me) complains that I can't relate to a hero that is female (and used to be male), then my concerns are stupid and pointless? Take your hypocrisy and shove off.  And you know what my solution is for getting women into comics? Get female creators, create new titles, and market them properly towards the female demographic. If Marvel can take the time and spend the money to advertise the sex changes of established characters, then they could just as well spend that effort on getting the word out about new female characters.  ""I absolutely don't understand at all how Marvel incorporating female superheroes into their universe . . . ""  That's not what I said. More female heroes is a great thing. What I take issue with is the women replacing the men. Again, look on the flipside . . . how do you think women would react if we took some of the most popular female heroes and made them men? You think they'd say, ""hey, what a fun and interesting twist!"" or do you think they'd complain about how it sends the wrong message about men doing a woman's job (or something similar)?

Strange, I never said any of that.  You're the only person who said literally any of those things.   And you know what my solution is for getting women into comics? Get female creators, create new titles, and market them properly towards the female demographic.   I see you ignored my challenge and instead decided to act like this was something that can realistically be done.  Please re-read the first large paragraph of my previous post.  This doesn't happen.  The MCU is already so filled, with almost all of the important roles filled by male heroes.  There isn't much room for new heroes while keeping all the old ones around.   If Marvel can take the time and spend the money to advertise the sex changes of established characters, then they could just as well spend that effort on getting the word out about new female characters.   They could also do a bunch of other shit with that time that doesn't matter.  But spending time and money creating completely new stuff when you have perfectly good stuff that everyone already likes sounds like a pretty stupid investment to me.  This is character progression, plain and simple, and so many people just don't understand this and that astounds me.  Wolverine isn't getting a sex change, it's a totally different person taking the identity of Wolverine.  Logan still exists, he's still alive, he's still doing shit, he just isn't calling himself Wolverine anymore.  Peter Quill is still alive, he's still doing shit, he just isn't calling himself Star-Lord anymore.   or do you think they'd complain about how it sends the wrong message about men doing a woman's job (or something similar)?   I have no idea, I don't think we've ever had it happen.  Maybe they'd be mad, maybe they wouldn't.  I don't think it has ever happened, so we have no idea.  There's no hypocrisy here, as nobody is saying anything about this.  It sounds like you're basically saying ""women can read comics, just not MY comics.""  Again, childish knee-jerk reaction.  I'm honestly, swear-to-whatever-god-you-believe-in, trying to be empathetic here.  I'm trying to understand it from you guys' perspective, and I'm trying really hard not to be hostile or inflammatory at all, because this is something you guys obviously care about.  You wouldn't be complaining about it on the internet if it didn't affect you in some way.  I still haven't seen one good, honest, serious reason why this is a bad thing.  Why can't a female character take over the mantle of a superhero who has been male in the past?  Why is it a bad thing outside of ""I just don't like it?"""

It involved buying level 1 stuff from a vendor (since I was vaporising epic level). Some hero or other reached 60 using two level 1 vendor items.

marvelheroes,3bm455,CorpseeaterVZ,7,Tue Jun 30 09:26:28 2015 UTC,"I can feel you, but I also have to disagree. About reaching quantity: Maybe you have played the game for too long? This happens with every game, as an efficient player myself, i can say that efficiency leads to redundancy, where you will have alot of stuff and progress very fast. I as a new player use all the uniques i dont need on rerolling pets, making credit chests, and making relic stacks. If you have 1000 of each relic stack, worse even thousands of each relic on multiple characters, then the game may have exhausted it's potential for you.  On the thought of uniques not being special: Uniques arent really special in any arpg these days, the only one would be PoE, but even there 90% of uniques are complete trash, and the other 10% are so rare that people charge the equivolent of say... ""100 swgn-s"" for them. I would never want that in this game.  Just the ramblings of an underslept man playing too much MH here, take what you will from my 2 cents."
marvelheroes,3bm455,WideSmiles,2,Tue Jun 30 10:13:11 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right that after playing for long enough, you'll eventually come to a point where 99% of the stuff you get is trash. I'm almost there and I don't have a problem with it -- there's basically no other way to design a game and still have it accessible for everyone. Inventory/stash management is a huge timesink, though, and that could be fixed. I believe some changes are rolling out next month, so I'll remain hopeful!"
marvelheroes,3bm455,Chillybin,2,Tue Jun 30 11:24:00 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, and i hope the devs don't listen to these complaints.  In an ARPG, if everyone gets great loot quickly because only high quality stuff drops, there is zero replay.  Looking for those great drops is what keeps you coming back.  The only other option becomes grinding out Omega points, which might be the most boring type of gaming ever envisioned.  I can understand what the OP is saying, though, and I agree to an extent.  I feel like there are too many actual items that are just instant trash.  It's one thing to get a piece of gear and go ""Dang, the rolls are low.  Oh well, into the grinder.""  it's quite another to leave an artifact sitting on the ground because it's not even worth picking up to sell.  What they should change is the number of levels of RNG you have to fight through to get what you need.  All the ultra-rare artifacts and uniques already have roll ranges that you want to be nice and high.  Making them also super rare to even find in the first place makes it even more disappointing when you get one that has low rolls.  Quality is something that should be increased across the board, but not by making the rolls better.  Rolling for good stats is pretty core gameplay.  Grinding away at the same thing over and over again to get a good specific drop is fine.  If that's what people want to do to maximize their toons, great,  but it shouldn't be required gameplay to get those items at all.  There are lots of items that are pretty critical for builds to work well that may as well not exist for a lot of people because they are so rare.  That needs to change, and a big pass on some of the more useless uniques and artifacts is well overdue, but the OP's actual complaint about making things always roll with higher numbers would kill this game."
marvelheroes,3bm455,HuggableBear,2,Tue Jun 30 13:59:11 2015 UTC,with how their loot system works more quantity is definitely better.
marvelheroes,3bm455,shogunreaper,2,Tue Jun 30 14:31:19 2015 UTC,Unique drops do not feel special like they should in an ARPG...
marvelheroes,3bm455,venderil,13,Tue Jun 30 10:07:23 2015 UTC,Trust me when that boss specific unique drops you will feel it...  And you will be amazingly happy.

marvelheroes,3bm455,Advacar,2,Tue Jun 30 14:29:36 2015 UTC,"i definitely see where you're coming from, but I'd file it under a personal problem. It sounds like everything you're complaining about needing to do is extra stuff you're doing voluntarily. You don't have to use a damage calculator, realistically you can eyeball it and generally be right. If you're looking for an extra DPS or three that's on you.  I will say, it would be nice if they would let us assign pets like they do team ups where we could pick from a menu rather than switch them around, but I doubt that's possible since we can own multiple of the same pet. Even then, it really only takes ten seconds or so to swap a pet around. That's certainly less than constantly rerolling affixes.   I'll be honest I thought from the title of your post you meant more quality patches rather than the weekly bug fests we're back to getting lately. On that count I whole heartedly agree."
marvelheroes,3bm455,HandsUpDontBan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:34:21 2015 UTC,"When I played Diablo 3, the only way a build was viable was if you had certain uniques.  There was no set drop location for most of them, and they were relatively rare.  Obtaining the one or two uniques you needed to finish your build could get very frustrating, let alone obtaining desirable stats on all of your uniques.  I would rather have critical items for builds be plentiful and easy to obtain in the desired stats.  Other items which are slightly better but optional and not game-breaking can be rare.  If everything is rare and base solely on RNG, then it just gets too frustrating for me to spend time and never obtain the drop I'm looking for.  I was very relieved when they added achievements for obtaining cosmic terminal boss drops.   An alternative to that system would be a currency that allows you to choose a drop that you're looking for, but Diablo 3 didn't even implement that correctly."
marvelheroes,3bm455,zylli42,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:24:25 2015 UTC,"You're right that the game has a loot problem. There is too much dropping. At this point, there is no reason to have purple or lower items. That said, if it takes you 30 minutes to sort through loot, then you misunderstand the problem.  There is a button that removes everything that isnt cosmic or better. I dont remember the last time I even saw a purple in my inventory past level 5."

I post very occasionally and have to admit I only read OP's post but I feel I have to ""confess"" something. I honestly don't remember when I started playing but I think it was around late 2013 or early 2014 'cos I remember chinese lanterns start to drop and I was ""YAY!!! Faster vendor leveling!!"" :) Anyways, for over a year MH was the only game I enjoyed and logging everytime after work was the peak of my day. I actually ""tricked"" my wife into game by feeding her Marvel lore all the time and voila! BEST year of my life :D But eventually we both grew tired and I began searching for something new. And I've playing PoE for the last 3-4 months. First I thought ""Brilliant skill system, a D2 clone but hey! What isn't nowadays?"" ... To make things short, now I'm back and thinking a way to explain the $129,99 to my wife when credit card bill arrives, all ideas are welcome :D Just play to have fun. Because games are there for that, to have fun. If you are not happy, look for something new. Maybe what happened to me will happen to you, too. Or not. Well, I forgot why I started to write :)"
marvelheroes,3bm455,hamzakarakobra,0,Tue Jun 30 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"Uniques for boxes or relics, very simple.  Make sure to use hero specific STASH for characters you hardly play.  Working to improve your characters in little steps is the hallmark of an ARPG.  Having choices and lots to do is not a fault of the game, but puts an onus on the players to plan out what they want to accomplish."
marvelheroes,3bm455,Doomgrin75,0,Tue Jun 30 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"I spent roughly 30 minutes of sorting out stash items for every 30 minutes of game time.   Whatever you're doing, it's wrong.  Shouldn't take you even 3 minutes to sort through inventory any time it fills up.  Learn what to save, what to vendor, and what to not even pick up.   Dodge, defense, chance to slow on an insignia?  Vendor or drop it. Any hero uniques?  Toss them in hero stashes to be saved for credit chest or relic stack turn-ins. 90% of artifacts?  Pick up and vendor if you want/need credits, otherwise ignore them.  Learn which ones are the best or are currently selling to other players Same with runes, keep a stack of each and don't bother picking up past 100 unless you need credits. And unless you're prestiging, loot vaccum should be set to Unique; you shouldn't even be picking up cosmics, purples, blues, or greens, or rings at all.   As for hero uniques and the question of an upgrade, learn to eyeball or you're going to continue hating the game as it currently is.  Hold alt to check the max rolls of items, compare to what you currently have equipped, and either keep it or vendor/convert it.  If you're that deadset on min-max'ing your hero's stats, you can always use a calculator, but it won't make or break you in this game and it's not worth losing sleep over.  You're just making unnecessary work for yourself."

marvelheroes,3bnxpr,JayPag,2,Tue Jun 30 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"There is technically a way. If they pop boosts and the server side boosts are high, you guys dont mind to do repetitive stuff and you don't mind mostly gaining nothing, then yeah.   Your friend needs to be party leader (because terminal bosses are adjusted to the party leader's level). One of you rushes to the boss, the  other enters, you let your friend get 1 hit in and then you demolish the boss. He'll get full xp, you won't get anything until you start battling level 50+ term bosses.  Do this with red terminals for most xp, and even more xp if he can re-roll his LQ's to terminal ones.  I did this with a guild homie, and it was second to last omega week day + he was running about 700% xp boost. He was getting 5-7 levels early on, and past level 45 it was 1-2 levels per terminal run."

marvelheroes,3bkpkt,cynosin,8,Tue Jun 30 06:04:29 2015 UTC,"From a character perspective, I do think widows bite was better than guns.    From a game play perspective, it makes more sense to change her spirit spender to physical, it matches better with her basic and widow maker being physical.  Now both ranged and melee builds use primarily physical attacks with energy dots.    I guess they could have kept the animation but have it do physical damage.  But they tend to follow closer to the movies where she uses guns."
marvelheroes,3bkpkt,capt_action94552,2,Tue Jun 30 02:34:39 2015 UTC,yeah i fully understand they why but i feel they should have kept that power in her rotation and maybe made it physical or even had it be a toggle that switches the damage type or the animation from pistols etc.   i felt it was a movie change and not a fan service change.
marvelheroes,3bkpkt,athenboi,0,Tue Jun 30 02:54:51 2015 UTC,I recommend making a suggestion for a variant costume with this animation change. Would that be alright to you if the stingers did physical damage but had the old animation? That would be a lot less development work for sure.
marvelheroes,3bkpkt,avatarofshadow,2,Tue Jun 30 03:59:06 2015 UTC,"i would rather have it as a toggle to replace the guns if people choose to do so, as of right now i enjoy using her grey suit from the 90's having to buy a whole new suit would suck if that was the only way to get them back into the game"
marvelheroes,3bkpkt,scorpious1109,3,Tue Jun 30 16:32:42 2015 UTC,I quit playing her because they took them out of the game. The whole concept of the character was she had her widows bite.  I used that in my old build it was great playing her.. now I feel as though I'm playing Mockinbird in a Black Widow Costume
marvelheroes,3bkpkt,dominicgetdown,8,Tue Jun 30 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"it would be like taking away Spidey's Web-Shooters, or Cap's shield.  I like the idea of making it a costume thing, where the movie costumes use the guns, maybe."

I always thought it would be great if the skill was a flip over the enemy and a stinger shot to the back or just a stinger shot, with both variations having a cooldown to add to the skill rotation.  I never liked having it as a machine gun skill and the new ""replacement"" of the twin guns and the bouncing stinger shot is just not good enough when the dual stinger widow's kiss blast is so iconic."

Comics should 100% be the initial reference for games like this. Sadly that has never been the case. Movies and T.V. shows always take precedence; I assume, because they reach a wider audience even though they are not the source material."
marvelheroes,3bnf4j,AL3XCAL1BUR,3,Tue Jun 30 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that there are few characters who cannot hold their own in end-game content, as long as you have 1) a solid build and 2) the proper gear to support that build.   I mention this for a very specific reason. If you've leveled all the heroes to 60, you've probably picked up some decent gear along the way. One way to choose is to take a look at what you have in terms of top-tier artifacts and uniques. If you've got a bunch of summoner stuff, Doom or Rocket are your best choices. If you've got a bunch of mental AOE stuff, Jean Grey might be a good choice (assuming she does mental damage and not energy?). If you don't know who your gear is good for, check out mh info and look up the item to see whose builds are tagged.  TL;DR If you want to ease the transition to endgame content, and you don't have a strong preference of play style, let your gear be your guide."
marvelheroes,3bnf4j,unsettlingideologies,2,Tue Jun 30 17:09:53 2015 UTC,"I do have a pretty good array of gear, with most of the boss specific artifacts and some of the uniques.  None of the One-Shot stuff though.  I do have good summoner gear, and really enjoy Doom, so he would be a good fit for my first ""hero"" to gear.  I was only shying away from using him since he is my buddy's favorite character and I didn't want to double up."

marvelheroes,3bnf4j,Zamaron,2,Wed Jul 1 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"You don't need to avoid anyone really. Some will be more challenging than others. You will have more intense gear requirements on Cable and Deadpool (for the next month or two.) Some will steamroll content like Doom and most fit in the middle.   My personal faves are Squirrel Girl, Rocket, Scarlet and Cyclops and I've played them regardless of their current state of power.   Just pick someone you love and go at it. You'll get gear and if you don't like someone, just move the gear to someone else. Most heroes will do fine with the same gear and blessings. Get an Iron Legion Sheathe, a Gem of the Kursed, an Advanced Metasensory Array, a Lizard Serum, an Arnim Zola ESP box and a Hand of Doom, bless them with Helas, get a level 80 Gungnir and you can probably gear 90% of the heroes. Have fun!"

marvelheroes,3bnf4j,acousticronin,2,Tue Jun 30 17:28:42 2015 UTC,I struggle with the same question. No matter how many times I swapped around my good gear and try to dedicate myself to any other hero I always end up coming back to Doctor Doom. He's just too good right now. I have the boss specific items to really flesh out his summoner build and it works so well that any time I use anyone else I feel like I'm doing myself a disservice by not using Doom. On that same token though after a while of steamrolling stuff with summoner Doom I don't feel very engaged because of the afk nature of the build so I lose interest... which is why I seem to always gravitate away from Doom and then start cycle all over again. :-)
marvelheroes,3bnf4j,Mandroll,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:45:40 2015 UTC,"Doom is pretty amazing.  I have him geared for summoner as well, which I suppose would negate the need to include Rocket, but I also think Doom would be an interesting use for my Power Cosmic legendary.  I think he will definitely make it into my top 3-5."
marvelheroes,3bnf4j,WhatImMike,2,Tue Jun 30 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"On your list I'd stay clear of deadpool and cable until after their reviews, Loki until after he gets a little QoL and Ms Marvel until after she gets her unique tuning. Jean Grey might also be a character I'd recommend avoiding when you start out endgame as she is more often than not melee range and really squishy (or not doing any dmg if you built her tanky). The rest of your list all seems very viable for any and all endgame content currently out. My personnal favorite from that list would probably  be Rogue for her versatility and doom for his ability to check content without needing a ton of gear. RR, spidey, Juggy I keep hearing are great but I've never taken thr time to gear them really well and play them (I don't enjoy playing melee that much and RR's fixed summon reminded me too much of my DH from D3)"

marvelheroes,3bnf4j,ProfJackAss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am planning on avoiding using Cable or Deadpool too much before the review, but Deadpool is my favorite character and barring a horrible review, he will most likely be one of my top 3.  I will also add Loki to the ""Maybe Later"" list.  I was leaning towards including Rogue for her versatility, as well, but I remembered getting kind of overwhelmed by choices when using her before (again, my indecisiveness).  Ms. Marvel was one of my favorite early on and I just wasn't sure how she would hold up these days, what with power creep and all, but if her uniques got sorted out (as mentioned below) that may be a non-issue."

Your best bet is to either download the test center www.marvelheroes.com/test-center or play each Hero to level 10 and see how you enjoy the early stages.   You can also do a quick search through reddit for many similar threads to yours that have had many people Comment already rather than get a few people to comment in yours."

But when I got him to 52, I decided to add the second bar to spacebar and boy did it make a difference...that and I placed my omegas well/had more than when I started lvling him. Jean Grey was the complete opposite...and I've prestiged her to yellow. Levelling her is fun, dashing around doing my aoe for lawls and killing everything... Until I got to 60, geared her up and just saw her as bleh because now enough...something... she still had great aoe to burn everything except bosses. Other than that, Magneto, cpt america, vision, starlord and SG early on were pretty meh but turned out to be fun in the endgame!"

I Think i did most of the levels with Barrage (being basic it cost nothing, and i like rapid attacks), Unthinkable (for ""weed whacking""), and Blockade (to draw some heat).  Since hitting 42 however i dumped everything into sorcery and is having a blast. Eldritch Reckoning with Cunning active just do crazy stuff in ""kill as many as you can"" sim rounds."

I think most all your points about the game are valid.    I came back at the beginning of this month.  Items are so different.  I have learn that most of the old any hero uniques are vendor trash to be exchanged for credit chest or relics.  It puzzles me.  When I used to play I farmed weeks for a cerebro for my emma and when I would get any unique drop on her I would be excited.  Now uniques, besides a few of the new boss uniques are just trash.    Some of the heroes just do not function well, even after 2 years.  Emma is unplayable, Jean is (to me) but that is debatable.    They focus too much on events.  Which, of course I enjoy them, but I would enjoy an Emma I could actually play or a non-clunky, multi build viable Jean more.    There are bugs, sooo many bugs and ones that negatively impact average player experience.  One, for instance, you die in a raid and the boss dies without you spawning before and you cannot rez via player or otherwise.  I've lost loot because of this.  Even with all of this, for now, I still love the game.  I love the grind.  I love that there is always something better, lootwise.  I have been extremely lucky this month and got enough loot to start setting up 2 or 3 characters for end game.  I hope Gaz will improve things.  It does seem like they';re trying to at least implement character fixes faster as they stated they will be every month.    Anyway this is waaay too long.  Good luck and have fun."

Within minutes from reaching max 60 you have all slot 1-5 uniques ready to go. There is no hunting for amazing yellow GG items that are better than uniques like in D2.  Runewards suck.

marvelheroes,3bnpwe,Galyndean,3,Tue Jun 30 20:01:02 2015 UTC,"The amusing part here is that they used to have rare loot. The community on the forums that spoke up didn't like that path. They wanted uniques constantly. When they added boss-specific uniques and artifacts that were rare, people complained they were too rare.   If you played the game from launch, you've seen how much has changed. It's a game that strives for a happy medium between casual and hardcore, IMO, and I don't expect anything more than that."
marvelheroes,3bnpwe,Galyndean,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"Ya I know how rare even epic gear was back in the day. For a game like this with so many heroes, gearing for mid-lategame probably should be easy. There are far too many heroes to enjoy for the grind to be substantial for each one. Still, it seems like you could just make any-hero uniques the placeholders and then have OP hero-specific uniques that are significantly rare. That way you could still enjoy a new hero using any-hero uniques until you find their gear. This would also give people incentive to buy/unlock new heroes if they happened to get a rare drop for a hero they didn't have. I'd be fine with how it currently is if the latest wave of hero-specifics weren't on par with the rarest drops in the game like Coat of the Skull. It just kinda ruins the fun."
marvelheroes,3bnpwe,Galyndean,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:38:29 2015 UTC,"I know I'm a little late to the party, but I just saw your thread while searching for something else, and was interested. The problem, in my opinion, with releasing super good, more rare loot is that they would also need to release more difficult content to scale with those better items. Because what happens when you get a full guild in super rare loot? they start super farming things like axis, and running noobs through to get their axis uniques, etc. however, the casuals would then complain because the uniques are too rare for them to get to play all content, and they don't think it's fair that they can't play all content. It's a vicious cycle. Power Creep, which is essentially what you are talking about with the current state of uniques. They have reached a place where the game is play, and replay value, with a small grind per character, without requiring constant content updates (outside of new heroes). It's a good place for them to be in from a business standpoint. New content regularly is stressfull, and even more buggy than what we experience now."

marvelheroes,3bnpwe,Sluggg13,-1,Wed Jul 1 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"You can be a casual and raid. I imagine you've built raids up in your head as this scary thing that only super serious WoW players do that takes hours and hours. You can hop into a green Muspelheim group using the LFG channel and be done in 45 minutes. They're ridiculously easy now with power creep, but still fun fights that actually require you to do a little more than faceroll the keyboard like every other boss outside of Rhino/Jug.  Since all the hero-specific uniques are getting reviewed, all you really need is a set of lvl 60 uniques for your hero to be able to do a green. Definitely don't need a GoK. Play on Monday and they rain from the sky in Midtown. I have no problem with low barriers to entry for green raids, but when the toughest content in the game is able to be completed by using items you found in one day, you might be able to see why there's a problem."

marvelheroes,3bnpwe,VictorVonCuddles,2,Wed Jul 1 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"Seems weird to be hanging out in a thread in a subreddit dedicated to a game you're leaving, even if it is one you posted."

marvelheroes,3bnpwe,VictorVonCuddles,3,Wed Jul 1 18:52:25 2015 UTC,It's easy to get burned out especially after 2.5k hours. Take a break.
marvelheroes,3bnpwe,Gankdatnoob,-3,Tue Jun 30 18:48:35 2015 UTC,This logic is bad. It's clearly not easy for me to get burned out since I've put 2.5k hours in one game. There are significant issues with the game that I pointed out in this post. Why do people insist on commenting on huge walls of text without actually reading the huge wall of text first? Just X out of the tab if you don't want to read it.
marvelheroes,3bnpwe,VictorVonCuddles,8,Tue Jun 30 21:07:44 2015 UTC,Sorry to see you leave.  It does sound like you got a lot more hours out of the game than most people do in most games though so that says something.  In an unrelated matter... whatcha gonna do with your items?

marvelheroes,3bnpwe,funkofages,3,Tue Jun 30 20:07:42 2015 UTC,"He summed them up pretty well. I think you're getting a bit of a blasting due to the whiney title. If you'd have said 'some feedback/criticisms from a 2500hr player', you might have been better received.   Also painting the entirety of Reddit as 'fedora wearing neckbeards' isn't something that reflects well.   If you wanted a full on discussion about the problems, perceived or real, you should have thought about how to engage people, not make an 'im leaving because these reasons and look at my items' post."

marvelheroes,3blw86,jrovrs,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:21:43 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason this game is pretty zzz is that there really is little benefit for going glass cannon on any hero, including Strange. The extra dmg you get is so, so small compared to the loss of survivability. The Cerebro omega node is the only thing that comes close and only a handful of heroes can use it. Even Psionic Overload isn't that efficient of a dps node. I love running glass cannon builds in every other game, but it just feels pointless in MH. Almost everything that's BiS for dmg is also BiS for health in this game. You can thank Amthua for contributing to that with every unique update. Pretty boring imo."

Appears they want most heroes between 5 and 6 minutes on the big TTK dummy. A few heroes need a bit more love, some need toning down, but it looks better than it did two months ago. Can actually count all the underpowered heroes on both my hands now!"
marvelheroes,3bn9nj,KamahlFoK,-1,Tue Jun 30 16:27:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think people are really overreacting to the nerfs.  The patch coming up -   Buffs:   Thor (lol) huge buffs! HT huge buffs  Surfer ranged  Colossus Taskmaster small QoL Thing's other summons   Nerfs:   Surfer sig (was announced months ago) Doom/RR small nerfs Summon Iceman small nerf (with a QoL buff) Thing's currently ""only"" summon.   The buffs seem to be WAY bigger than the nerfs."
marvelheroes,3bn9nj,Frankthebank22,7,Tue Jun 30 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think making them ""top tier"" is the goal. Atleast not on such a short time. It's better to give heroes small buffs and see how they affect the character. If you give big buffs instead of multiple small ones, the character might be too good meaning it has to be nerfed again.  So I think it's just better they take their time with this. So it doesn't become a giant buff and nerf mess."
marvelheroes,3bn9nj,shotterken,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:52:37 2015 UTC,"Doomsaw literally said it is their goal. Did you not even bother to read the 2nd paragraph of the thread I linked?   Our goal is to move every hero on the roster into “Top Tier” status for tougher end-game content, including Raids, Cosmic games modes, higher-difficulty Danger Room scenarios, and so on.   And they did do ""big buffs."" They buffed all summons by 25%. Now, they're nerfing the actual kits of summoners instead of their ""big buff"" values."
marvelheroes,3bn9nj,dorn3,2,Tue Jun 30 16:54:15 2015 UTC,"When he said that ""Top Tier"" meant 5 mins TTK on the dummy.  It seems like they're slowing moving everyone into the 4:30-5min range."

marvelheroes,3bn9nj,Quexana,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:49:21 2015 UTC,"Now I don't memorize every set of patch notes, but I noticed that you mentioned the Rocket and Doom nerfs.  These were minor nerfs and in the case of the Rocket Time Warp Turret nerf, asked for by the community.  These nerfs also came after a huge buff that gave an extra 25% damage to all summons.  You're free to count one buff and one nerf and claim that they cancel each other out, but at least in the case of summoners, it's intellectually dishonest.  Summoners have net gained big over the last month or two.  And that's basically how the rest of the hero roster is working.  Sure, there are nerfs, but overall, the net power creep among all heroes has gone up dramatically.  And maybe it's just because I'm a Cable/Luke Cage main (two below average heroes) but some heroes NEED nerfs.  I took the opportunity to level up Scarlet Witch recently and HOLY SHIT is that bitch broken."

marvelheroes,3bn9nj,Frankthebank22,4,Tue Jun 30 17:19:30 2015 UTC,Surfer's sig is actually a nerf. The radius doesn't really matter. Power Duration is huge. But we knew this change was coming.

marvelheroes,3bn9nj,bauhau8,0,Tue Jun 30 16:26:59 2015 UTC,"Gaz is terrible at balancing the game, I don't know how many times they tried to tune heroes but I think it was at least 4 major tuning processes since launch and we are still almost at square 1 where several heroes/abilities are still unbalanced. The sad part is that they are much more eager to nerf strong heroes while leaving some heroes in a sad state for several months, SW can be grateful for avengers 2 movie otherwise she would still be a pain to play, that lasted over a year ... I am getting tired of seeing Gaz pretending to balance heroes, as if it was content we should be grateful, when they failed miserably in 2 years of existence. And it looks like this last tuning project is a very slow and long process, which will require yet again another re-re-re tuning when it will be done, ironically, no doubt."

marvelheroes,3bn9nj,ProfJackAss,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:46:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same here. I purposely didn't spec into Doom's summoner build because I knew it was going to be nerfed because of how blatantly overpowered he was. Like I said, he'll still be overpowered, but at least he'll be toned down a bit.  Rocket and Iceman nerfs kinda suck. Rocket finally got a big bump in his DPS and now, Gaz decided to toss him back into his cage. Iceman has been hit multiple times already. While his summoner build is OP, it did not deserve a 15-20% damage nerf, especially not without buffs to compensate for the nerf.   Again, my point is that Gaz has been nerfing more than they've been buffing. This is not what their stated philosophy and objective is. It's causing people to shy away from committing gear and ult upgrade tokens, along with real money (for costumes, boosts for prestige, etc.) to these heroes."
marvelheroes,3bn9nj,ProfJackAss,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:53:00 2015 UTC,Most of these characters are Ranged characters which means you get to sit back and spam damage. I think it's warranted IMO. Sorry you're so upset about the nerfs.

Blowing up the TWT was never intended and frankly, was stupid gameplay wise.  Fleetslayer with battery specialization was annihilating shit way too easily.  4mil brutes, 4 times, for a ranged attack on a summoner is just stupid.  Even with the nerf to 25% it will still be doing ridiculous damage.  But to say these changes will put him ""back in his cage"" is just ridiculous.   Iceman has been hit multiple times already. While his summoner build is OP, it did not deserve a 15-20% damage nerf, especially not without buffs to compensate for the nerf.   huh.... what?   Iceman's Ice Golem snowy aura no longer stacks when affecting the same enemy (this only affects Construct Focus, which can have 3 Golems out at the same time)  Iceman will now summon all 3 Golems at once with Construct Focus   Where exactly do you see a 15-20% nerf there?   Again, my point is that Gaz has been nerfing more than they've been buffing.    No, they haven't.  Before making stupid claims like this maybe you should actually count the buffs vs nerfs.

At the moment, Cosmic slot 4 because the main source of damage is Psionic Projection and the build seems sorely lacking in +skills (because I don't use any Psylocke specific uniques, no doubt)."
marvelheroes,3bl7w1,riidiii,2,Tue Jun 30 22:05:59 2015 UTC,That's amazing =)
marvelheroes,3bl7w1,ProtonixChaos,2,Tue Jun 30 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"This is different. I would very much enjoy not dying in CMM ICP melee boss fights. Do you have your build posted anywhere?  If not, what powers do you use for this?"
marvelheroes,3bl7w1,ElectricZee,3,Tue Jun 30 20:24:31 2015 UTC,"What I finished up with http://marvelheroes.info/build/21140/  There are some (obvious?) upgrades available - I just don't have them (2 artifacts come to mind). Boots: cosmics with Psionic Projection unless you have everything at 69, then probably Nisanti.  Rotation: open Assassinte + Typhoon. Shadow Dash through your target, then back again, do this until you can Assassinte + Typhoon again.  Shadow Dash and Psionic Projection is the whole focus of this build. Toss all your other notions about builds and rotations out the window.  In CMM/CISP in very dangerous situations I don't loiter on one mob, I bounce between as many as possible and only Assassinate when it feels safe. I try to dash clean through mobs too, rather than land at their feet.  Omega: take defensive stuff - Hulkbuster, SO2, Blob, a couple others that don't ramp up horribly. Avoid the 200+ point int nodes except the 1200 pointer.  Watch the opening to X-Men 2. They will never see you, they'll never believe there is just one of you, you never stand still.  FWIW, in ICP/Midtown while leveling up this build is absolutely disgusting once you have a little spirit generation. It's not the fastest boss killer, but you literally annihilate trash just getting from place to place. It's the reason I went this way - it felt so overpowered I just kept with it."
marvelheroes,3bl7w1,riidiii,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"Tried this out tonight with BIS summoner gear vs. BIS Hybrid gear.  Artifacts: A.R.M.O.R and UEB artifacts instead of Latverian Regalias Uru: I used a Doop Inspiration instead of River of the Soul. Relics: ARMOR Relics Slot 4: Nisanti Boots with +Intelligence   Omegas: With the exception of maxing S02 and Elixir of Immortality, I basically followed this http://marvelheroes.info/build/18269/  Knocked a full 15-35 seconds off each Kurse run, plus it was a bit more fun. I kept the Mental toggle up the entire time."

marvelheroes,3bl7w1,Userlicious,2,Tue Jun 30 10:43:00 2015 UTC,"At lower to mid omega levels, I found Hybrid using the Power Cosmic and Power Doop to be easier on spirit sustain with still good DPS.  At maximum omega levels there are more +Energy and +Mental damage options to spread points over, level 80 single damage type legendary, and less spirit issues to worry about. Crit chance on the legendary and God of Mischief lets artifacts and omegas lean towards mental damage instead of CC.  Psylocke's own uniques focus a lot of points into defense, where as the any hero uniques used instead focus on DPS. Only Fragment of Twilight outdoes her slot 1 though."
marvelheroes,3bl7w1,LincSnow,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"mental might be better if you have the artis for it (essence, headband, etc) and l80 legendary. hybrid if you don't want to spend the 1000 odins and its way easier to gear for, especially after this week.  psylockes uniques are pretty bad. her slot 1 is good, her slot 3 is ok,  and thats about it..."
marvelheroes,3bl7w1,asylum101,2,Tue Jun 30 03:26:27 2015 UTC,"Hybrid is easier to gear for, both in terms of maximizing your dps and and in terms of sustaining your spirit--what with Power Cosmic and Power Doop."
marvelheroes,3blorj,Voykid,8,Tue Jun 30 05:59:43 2015 UTC,"I find that disabling the motion blur in the options helps a lot with Movement Silver Surfer.  Psylocke is good if a little fragile. (Don't stand in the same spot too long and you will be fine.)  NC can be made decent enough with a lots of gearing, but then he might have gotten better with the recent tuning pass, I dunno.  Gambit main issue, imo, is his sig... so many misses due to bosses moving all the time.  Iron Man is still quite solid.  Cap got ""nerfed"" last tuning pass, I don't think he is ""OP"" anymore, tho he certainly his in the upper half.  Don't have Ms. Marvel, so can't say anything about her.  Other heroes I like that are at least viable: Ghost Rider (tough, deal a fair amount of damage and fire everywhere. A little slow without a Zig.).  Black Widow (Stealthy, multi-millions brutes out of Covert Sniper. 'nough said. Once again, she ain't a teleporter so Zig is a must if you plan on blitzing terminals.)"

marvelheroes,3blorj,kestenovski,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:55:24 2015 UTC,"My personal favorites for looks and fun are nightcrawler and ghost rider.  Both are very good in cosmics with GR being easier to avoid unexpected deaths and NC having a huge speed advantage.  For me personally GR has the best graphics in the game, I maxed his movement power (ride) in a secondary build just because it looks so awesome to cruise through Midtown melting all the baddies that try to follow.  NC is hands down the most fun character I've played with the speed he moves and the unique playstyle his tp build gives I had a blast.    I've got around half the roster at 60 another dozen or so in the 50s and the rest I've at least played for a bit, and in my personal opinion the two mentioned above are my favorites."

marvelheroes,3blorj,ElectricZee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:12:30 2015 UTC,"I love Cap and Iron Man. Even post nerf Cap is still good an terminal clearing.  His combo is silky smooth too. Iron Man is far more spammy than Cap, but his abilities look great and he's got a ton of costume options. Dat Hulkbuster son. Or Guardians. Or Marvel Now. Or Starboost. Shotgun. Stealth. So much win.  I haven't tried Ms Marvel since her unique changes, but style wise, I think she looks really cool.  Gambit's abilities look cool as shit too.  I don't know if you're interested in him at all, but I thought Nova's abilities look really great."

marvelheroes,3big36,Uniqron,2,Mon Jun 29 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"MM > Odin > ICP.  If you have a char you really really dislike, hoard  those MM boxes and wait till a thursday to open the MM boxes on it, farmed by another char starting at the same level range. If you don't have boosts running on your farming char, it is likely that you have enough cases to level the passive leveling char."

marvelheroes,3big36,capt_action94552,3,Mon Jun 29 17:54:04 2015 UTC,Don't ICP boxes have a chance for icp boss uniques or is it just for the icp rings?
marvelheroes,3big36,dorn3,2,Tue Jun 30 03:45:59 2015 UTC,They're not really boss uniques.  They're just ICP specific uniques.  The ICP chests are the primary way to get them.

You can run and kill taskmaster and get more XP.  Only way it's worth it to spend time opening boxes is if you have someone running for you and you have that 10 seconds or so until the TP call goes out.  I stopped picking them up."
marvelheroes,3big36,mrmojoz,3,Mon Jun 29 17:25:19 2015 UTC,You don't pick up boxes that contain millions in XP and uniques? You really beat the system.

marvelheroes,3big36,itsmymillertime,3,Mon Jun 29 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"For me yesterday, 8 odin boxes = 1 omega.  1 Taskmaster = .8 omega.  So if you waste 1 run's time worth of taskmaster to open 24 boxes after 12 runs, you would get 3 omega in the same time as .8 omega.  It is worth to pick up the odin boxes.  I found the oppositie to be true in MM with their boxes as you waste time waiting for the mm bosses to spawn when you could be doing taskmaster."
marvelheroes,3big36,Userlicious,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:51:27 2015 UTC,"So, tasky with odins is better. Granted it depends on how fast you can run him. (Maybe some newer players can't melt him in 2 seconds)"

marvelheroes,3bl5hy,Zero_AE,5,Tue Jun 30 02:51:01 2015 UTC,She Hulk has a tough learning curve as her rotation can be a little obtuse but shes my main and I use her for everything and I love her. Gearing her is pretty easy as well because her uniques are all fairly decent. If you ever have any questions in game feel free to message me at the same handle liamcharger :)
marvelheroes,3bl5hy,liamcharger,5,Tue Jun 30 02:59:21 2015 UTC,"If you think She-Hulk is fun at low levels, then she only gets better. Quite frankly, her low level experience stinks because she starts off with no passives so she's spirit-starved and has no damage negation.  Once you get up to level 22 you'll have both passives and things only get better from there.  She can handle all end-game content just fine (I used her in pre-nerf axis), and if you're having fun with her now, you'll likely have fun all the way up to 60. She's not very difficult to gear because you can use all of her uniques and be fine, and if you want to stick with the people's elbow for end-game, all you need is a good pair of doc ock arms, and that's an easy unique to find.  If you need any help, you can just message me in-game. I have the same handle, mikwuyma."
marvelheroes,3bl5hy,mikwuyma,8,Tue Jun 30 07:42:52 2015 UTC,Ms Marvel is well worth a look if things don't work out with She-Hulk.

marvelheroes,3bl5hy,ThreeStarUniform,5,Tue Jun 30 03:27:52 2015 UTC,She can miss her uppercut easily but it's only necessary to use in raids.  Just run the other finisher on build slot 1 and uppercut on 2 for raids where the bosses hardly move anyway.  The aoe finisher has more than enough dmg for anything else.
marvelheroes,3bl5hy,Sluggg13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:07:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. You can use the elbow in raids, it's just not as powerful as the uppercut because it's slower and doesn't have flat crit chance."

marvelheroes,3bl5hy,tso,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:59:54 2015 UTC,Black Widow is pretty squishy.   She's squishy but she can melt a boss in seconds with her vicious sig/widowmaker/sweepkick spam combo. Pretty decent trade-off IMO.
marvelheroes,3bl5hy,bingcognito,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:36:54 2015 UTC,Keep playing her and find out.  Fun is a subjective term that is completely relative to the player.  But if you're liking her early then its pretty safe to assume youll like her more later.
marvelheroes,3bl5hy,dkphxcyke,3,Tue Jun 30 02:58:58 2015 UTC,I'm asking cause I'm thinking on buying her. I just want to be sure I'll have fun with her later on.
marvelheroes,3bl5hy,dkphxcyke,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"Well like i said man.. theres no way to be sure you will unless you play her.   You can always try out the test center www.marvelheroes.com/test-center and try her out at lvl 60 to be sure.  People can sit here and tell you ""yeah shes fun"" or ""no shes not"" all day long -- but unless you actually play her you wont have a proper opinion for yourself without going on ""he said she said""."

marvelheroes,3bize9,MK43,5,Tue Jun 30 00:24:01 2015 UTC,"I have a ton of team ups, because I like to get the ones that make sense with whichever characters I play at the moment, but here's a break down for you.  This is pretty much my general favorite to least favorite.   (I also added special interactions if I noticed any for when I'm playing certain heroes).  She-Hulk: Very talkative and pretty funny or clever in her comments.  She sorta talks smack, but they are generally quite positive, so I like that.  She has a lot of dialogue with avengers, so that could be a good or bad thing since there are way more Ironmans/Caps than Cyclops around. (Special interaction if you play as Ghostrider, Thor, Juggernaut)  Arachne - Generally positive and nice, she does not do a lot of smack talk, so that's usually a good thing.  She does comment about her kid a lot though, so you can either like it or hate it.  Overall, there's nothing bad about her, and she talks plenty.  (Special interaction with Beta ray bill, Cyclops, Captain America)  Spider-woman - I like a lot about her, but the biggest thing that's keeping her down at 3rd for me is that she can be a bit negative at times, and some of her long monologues are a little too much for me.  However, I guess that's sort of in character.  She does talk a lot though.  (Special interactions are Ms. Marvel, Ghostrider, Hawkeye)  Magik is tied with Spiderwoman for me, but you have her.  Gamora - She is talkative, but she seems to be a little try hard for me.  As someone pointed out, she can be a little whiny at times too, and I'm usually not a fan of smack talk unless it's clever or friendly (like She-Hulk).  Unfortunately, I've gotten no special interactions out of her, even though I own Nova.  Firestar - I got her very early on, and I haven't used her enough.  However, the reason she is down here is that she doesn't have a lot to say (or a lot of interesting things to say). I also have not gotten any special interactions out of her, even though she teamed up with Nova before.  Iron man - No speaking, so obviously down here for now."
marvelheroes,3bize9,tacklebeast,4,Mon Jun 29 21:53:36 2015 UTC,"Playing Captain America with Magik gets a bit disruptive with all the times she says ""Ohmigod, is that Captain America?  How's my hair?"" on see another Cap."

It uses the splinter value of the heroes to calculate if you should keep gambling.  It tells you when the chances get even in case you want to just start buying whoever you like.

Not all heroes in the rooster have the same weight, percentage-wise. Boxes clearly were intended to have more chances of dupes and starter heroes.  needless to say, I never bothered with them ever again. i bought all my heroes at their G or ES price ever since"
marvelheroes,3bkem4,arcdevil,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:39:30 2015 UTC,"I finally stopped last month with 3 left to unlock. I've been playing nearly 18 months. There was a spell last year where it was Ghost Rider over and over again. I'd say 2/3 of my roster have several ranks in their ultimate, all from random.  Pretty much stop when you start to get pissed off. Saving splinters is not fun but when you get used to it it's not so bad if you have a hero or two that you enjoy playing.  Something I read on the forums a long time ago suggested levelling all your heroes before trying random. I have to say it seemed to help but that's purely anecdotal."

marvelheroes,3bfyp4,NyuBomber,3,Mon Jun 29 15:23:18 2015 UTC,"I buy Gs when they are on sale and then I buy boosts when they are on sale. Also, I'm a big fan of buying fortune cards when they are on sale, since I've accrued most of my boosts that way.  However, you can run red and green terminals and acquire cube shards and spend 10 CS at Clea to get Fortune Card MK 1 cards. Usually you just end up getting boosts that way. Not to mention keeping an eye on this forum because every now and then there are redemption codes for free boosts."
marvelheroes,3bfyp4,JackDemented,2,Mon Jun 29 17:46:18 2015 UTC,"to expand /r/h0tmess answer, if your specifically chasing costumes there's a better, faster way than farming cubes for cards to boost your SiF.   you can simply prestige your chars, you get a dupe of the basic costume with every prestige. With 3 costumes you can use the blender and get a random costume. Dont have to bother with SiF random drops. rng is rng but u will get some nice costumes out of that, no doubt.  it may appear as a grindier path at first, but its certainly much less grindy than waiting for costume drops, which are as rare as hen's teeth"

marvelheroes,3bhcq0,TimexG,2,Mon Jun 29 19:44:38 2015 UTC,We learn something everyday!  I actually find that quote as one of his most annoying ones.
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,Enzo9292,5,Mon Jun 29 19:51:21 2015 UTC,"Firstly no content in the game is locked behind any sort of pay wall. All heroes can be unlocked for free using a currency (Eternity Spliters) that drops in-game; Heroes cost between 200-600 splinters. You can also purchase random hero boxes for 175 ES that have an equal chance of giving any hero in the game (as well as ones you might already have so that's the major draw back) and are typically good until you own around 60% of the roster.  Marvel Heroes is a lot like Diablo in that if you've played Diablo or other ARPGs like it you'll easily be able to understand game mechanics and other such things. Marvel Heroes has plenty of things to do at max level. There are Cosmic Terminals which are just harder lvl 60 versions of existing bosses that you can farm for specific RNG item drops. Patrols, both regular and cosmic with cosmic being more difficult and having some loot bonuses and other features. Patrols are large zones with many fast spawning enemies and boss waves that give rewards for defeating them.  Raids are also in Marvel Heroes. Similar to other MMOs, Raids are harder content for groups that give currency and item drops to increase your heroes strength. There are also Achievements which give loads of cool things. Omega points are an AA system introduced to the end-game which gives you something to strive towards at max level. These Omega points are spent on increasing your characters strength or defenses as well as utility.  In my experience Marvel Heroes is much more forgiving in the RNG department then other ARPGs.  Marvel Heroes is the most fair F2P game I've played. While it does offer XP potions and Rare Item Find/Special Item Find potions these in no way break the game and give someone an unfair advantage over anyone else.  The only thing i've found that i ""HAVE"" to pay for would be stash space. The more you play the more you'll find you are running out of room to keep things. This might be annoying if you truly want to spend nothing on the game.  My recommendation would be to play for a few hours and see how you like it. It costs nothing to try out and if you don't care for it all you've lost is time."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,2,Mon Jun 29 20:13:16 2015 UTC,"I like the sound of MMO style raids with alot more players, Means it can be alot more fun, Is there community zones Like say Stormwind in WoW where plays gather to show off there stuff or just joke around.  I dont mind spending money on it, its just i dont want to have to spend 200 or 300+ just to be at a level to raid with players and other things.   Also, a question no one has answered, Do marvel pull the studios strings as to what to release or to ram paid content down our throats? if there sales are low or shares etc.   Thank you for the kind thoughtful and accurate reply, i appreciate it.  Stuck it on the download list and should be done in 30 minutes or so."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,RLGGZA,2,Mon Jun 29 20:17:25 2015 UTC,"Stormwind in WoW is equivalent to Avenger's Tower in this game. The game has several ""hubs"" where vendors are and players just chill before teleporting somewhere."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:26:02 2015 UTC,That sounds really great. Thanks for the reply
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,2,Mon Jun 29 20:28:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, these community zones are called ""hubs"" they contain event vendors, item vendors, item storage, etc. Players congregate here using LFG, Trade and Social chat.  And no. You don't have to spend $200-$300 to be on par with people whom have been playing longer.  As far as Marvel Studios involvement with the game goes it seems to be more on the side of guiding them along. The devs have said in the past that most things put into the game require Marvel to give their okay on; ie: character design. Every week the game gets patched and we get a weekly event and bug fixes and other sorts of things.  Every month a new hero is released, these cost money but as i said before you can also unlock them with the eternity splinters that drop in-game.  All-in-all Marvel seems pretty much hands off when it comes to how Gazillion decided to price things. They don't put out content that's paid only.  Most big content releases seem to coincide with Movie releases. Like for example we got Star-Lord added the day of. Rocket Racoon was updated and they also released Drax, Gamora and Groot Team-Ups.  Ant-Man will receive his release to line-up with the movie release as well."

marvelheroes,3bjp3n,mattinva,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:44:57 2015 UTC,Do marvel pull the studios strings as to what to release or to ram paid content down our throats?   movie costumes i guess would fall into this category kinda but no there is never any kind of forced purchase in the game for content the closest the get to forcing you to buy anything is stash space which is 5 bucks a piece but if you enjoy the game you can get by only spending 25 bucks on it once
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,dagmar1986,5,Mon Jun 29 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"you can unlock any of the playable heroes by acquiring an in game currency (eternity splinters). 1 splinter drops about every 6-8 minutes of game play. heroes cost 200, 400 or 600 splinters (depending on how much dev work was required to create them). on your 2nd day of play, you'll get a gift of 400 splinters. you can also buy 'random hero' boxes for 175 splinters (you may get a duplicate of a hero you have unlocked already, however -- you can use that hero token to upgrade a special skill on that hero)."

marvelheroes,3bjp3n,selfpossessed,5,Mon Jun 29 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"the only thing i consider some what necessary to spend any money on (and not a lot at that), is more Stash space (shared inventory space), i'd recommend having 2 crafting stash tabs (one for runes, another for crafting materials, costume cores, etc), and a few normal stash tabs. it is possible to play w/o spending any money, i just find having a few stash tabs makes things much easier to manage."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,johnathanfeezy,-1,Mon Jun 29 20:03:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply, Are the devs money hungry and ignore things and rather shove paying features up your arse, or do Marvel pull the strings with the economical side, Kind of what EA is to every studio under it."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,shogunreaper,3,Mon Jun 29 20:06:58 2015 UTC,Honestly short of PoE this is the most true F2P game I've ever played.  I started a few weeks ago and spent some money when there was a sale going on but could still be leveling new heroes just from the in game currency I've collected while playing and that is without even touching endgame stuff yet (which AFAIK is also in no way limited by money spent).  Honestly it has been a breath of fresh air after coming from games like SWTOR or Hearthstone (which is super grindy by comparison) and I spent money more as a way of rewarding a really fun game than anything (although I do feel like a couple of stash spaces makes the game much less of a headache just from inventory control perspective).
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,shogunreaper,2,Mon Jun 29 20:18:40 2015 UTC,Does each hero you buy or unlock start a level 1 and you have to level it to max level?
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,accaris,3,Mon Jun 29 20:24:44 2015 UTC,Yes. Once you get to max level they will each be able to be prestiged as well so you can level them again if you choose.
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,destriga,2,Mon Jun 29 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"the dev's seem pretty level headed when it comes to selling stuff, its primarily cosmetic stuff & convenience items (XP boosts, etc)"
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,domfx,2,Mon Jun 29 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think you could character Gaz as being more money hungry than any other F2P game dev company. Personally, I spend money on the game when I want to - not because I feel the need to compete with some kind of invisible power curve. And as I understand it, Gaz has to get Marvel approval before releasing new content, such as costumes, etc. And all of this content is available without having to pay for it. The only exception are the variant costumes, which are only available in a limited-run. So if it's really important that your Star Lord have different colored headphones than everyone else, yeah that'll cost you."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,Flying_Toad,3,Mon Jun 29 20:24:01 2015 UTC,"Everything in the cash shop is very reasonable in terms of content (unless xp or item find boosts bother you). And you can earn all the heroes and team ups in game. However, the prices are what is insane. Everything is absurdly expensive. I think as many said, you need some stash space which i will probably buy. But there are plenty of other things I wouldn't mind buying and I never buy cash shop garbage (the game is that good). However, The prices are just too much for me. Maybe other disagree but it feels a little money hungry."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,makone222,2,Mon Jun 29 21:35:24 2015 UTC,"The only thing you are forced to buy with money is stash.  and if you plan to enjoy the game you will need at least a few.  If you want teamups you're better off buying them for cash too, the splinter cost is too high to waste on them imo.  I'm able to play with only 3 stash spaces, but i have like 20 dummy accounts i put other items on."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,AtomicCandy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:20:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! its on the download list now.   Just wondering if each champion you buy or unlock, do you need to level them to max level every single time?"
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,Flying_Toad,2,Mon Jun 29 20:26:07 2015 UTC,yeah you do.
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,DKZeph,2,Mon Jun 29 20:51:02 2015 UTC,"Marvel doesn't ""pull the strings,"" but they do have a heavy hand in approving Gazillion's design choices with Marvel intellectual properties. And yes, there are lots of promotions tied to the movies, and some of them cost money (like the movie costumes.) But that stuff is entirely optional.   The most likely thing people will spend money on is extra stash space. What you get by default is completely inadequate, since you only have one shared inventory across all characters.   The end-game is similar to Diablo 2. (Actually the item system reminds me more of Torchlight 2.) Lots and lots of grinding for super rare drop items and currencies. There are WoW-style raids in the game as well. Leveling new heroes keeps it fresh, but you will find after awhile that you're grinding for a lot of the same stuff for many of your heroes, and that can start to get stale.  One thing that breaks the grind for example is the fact that you are eventually guaranteed to get the item you want if you kill the same boss a certain number of times (300 or 500-kill achievement rewards.) In D3 you can do 500 rifts and never see that crucial item drop."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,pamkhat,2,Mon Jun 29 20:21:40 2015 UTC,"I made an account on reddit just to answer your questions.  1) The only thing you need to buy is storage space. At end game you will just have too much to hold on to.   2) As others have said, all heroes are easily obtainable by just playing the game. Nothing is locked behind a pay wall.  3) Marvel has to approve content before it is released. This is, of course, their IP. It doesn't really effect you though. Marvel does not make them sell anything to you. The most bearing this will have on you is a delay between things like gaz designing a new costume and it being available in the store to purchase.  4) This is an ARPG like diablo. So at end game you will likely be grinding. It is the nature of the beast.  Hope that helps. It truly is a great game."

marvelheroes,3bjp3n,jordan13542,2,Mon Jun 29 20:35:02 2015 UTC,"I've seen you ask the question of whether Marvel pulls the strings and whatnot a few times in here already so I'll try to answer your question as accurately as possible:  Gazillion have a very stable schedule of release 1 new hero every month, give or take a week or two for delays or bugs. They are the ones who get to pick which heroes they release for the game and that schedule is steady and not interfered with by Marvel.   They will however release movie tie-in content in the months where a movie is released. For example, May's hero release was Vision. They also released costumes for every Avenger modelled after their movie counterparts. June's hero release was Dr. Doom, to coincide with the 2 year anniversary of the game. And when Ant-Man comes out, he will be that month's hero.  And as far as I know, the only involvement Marvel has with the game studio is approving all their content (it is their I after all) to check for cannon inaccuracies and details like that.   As far as Gazillion themselves, they are a very amateurish studio and prone to a LOT of mistakes and fuck ups. But they have their heart in the right place and usually put a lot of effort into fixing their blunders. The community loves them for that, but I would rather they don't make those mistakes in the first place (hero imbalance, bugs, poorly thought out content, etc)   But they try and overall they deliver a quality product and I enjoy the game. I try not to look too hard at the fact I am pretty much just getting loot in order to get better loot in order to get better loot because that would make me jaded about most video game.  Its free to play. You get a free hero of your choice with a new account. After 24h when you login again the next day you get 400 eternity splinters which you can use to buy another hero. Either 4x random hero so 175. 2x 200 splinter heroes or 1x 400. Or save up for a 600. Although because of the synergy system I urge all new players to buy random heroes and just get as many as they can early on."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,jordan13542,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:07:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the very in depth reply as to what i asked about them pulling the strings.  What is this ""Synergy system"" that you speak off?"
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,gmbridge,2,Mon Jun 29 21:19:59 2015 UTC,each level 50 character you have gives a synergy along the lines of 2-4% x damage type/ crit/xp you can turn on 10 at a time boosting your current heroes damage
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,makone222,2,Mon Jun 29 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"In addition to what makone said, there's also an experience bonus based off of how many heroes you have at certain levels called the Hero Synergy Experience Bonus."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,jordan13542,2,Mon Jun 29 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"Every hero that you get to level 25 and 50 have a passive bonus available. You can select any 10 heroes to ""activate"" their bonuses for each hero you play.   For example, on my doom I get increased area damage bonus from Human Torch, ranged and energy damage bonuses from Iron Man, Health from Hulk, etc.   Whereas my Hulk would get different bonuses from activating 10 different heroes.  Although at this point I say just download the game and find out for yourself. The game is free so you don't lose anything by just firing it up and playing around a bit."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,Dogstar34,2,Mon Jun 29 23:56:29 2015 UTC,"The only thing you have to pay for is extra STASH space and even that has been hinted as maybe changing someday. Everything else can be obtained by playing the game (Note, some grinding and luck will be required.)."
marvelheroes,3bjp3n,_ReclaimeR_,2,Mon Jun 29 22:56:07 2015 UTC,"You mentioned the whole ""do a rift and hope"" aspect of D3.  There is a little bargaining with RNG for items, but since the achievement system got added there are these new Takedown achievements that are super nice.    Basically, if you kill a boss enough times, the achievement gives you the boss' special unique item.  For example, if you kill Doc Oc in his Cosmic Terminal 500 times you get his special Octobot Controller.  Of course, while you're grinding out that number you still have a chance for it to drop, but you are guaranteed to get that sucker at least once.  I love it."

However, Juggernaut was my first char to 60 and the one I am currently running Green/Red Raids and cosmic patrols with.  As stated below, his best damage is movement based, so while you can go for a stand still and punch things build, you're better off with Thing/Hulk if you like that style.  He has great survivability (between his abilities and the right gear you can easily have 4 invuln procs) and does really big bursty damage.  Plus his own uniques are all really strong so you don't need to do a ton of farming to get solid gear for him"

With the later it Doesn't really mater; with proper gear those three heroes can do all content in the game without much trouble as long as you're paying attention. Some other melee heroes might find it harder then others but Jugg, Hulk and Thing should be fine.  If it's terminals you're talking about then any character in the game can do cosmic terminals with just about any build with little-to-no effort."
marvelheroes,3bjhop,mrmojoz,0,Mon Jun 29 19:25:02 2015 UTC,"well if you want to do cosmic terminals, melee is fine. cosmic patrols? melee can be ok. IMO, thing>jugg>hulk. I don't like hulk, so I rate him last, but that's personal preference. Thing is reaaaally tanky and does some sick dmg. Jugg can be pretty tanky and still have some HUGE burst, not to mention with his movement build he is in and out of combat so he takes less damage than a typical melee hero."

marvelheroes,3biji0,Lobotomist,6,Mon Jun 29 14:46:08 2015 UTC,In my opinion  Capt. America and Punisher are the two strongest starting characters with a nod toward Storm.
marvelheroes,3biji0,Falsedisillusion,3,Mon Jun 29 14:54:15 2015 UTC,Play all the heroes you are interested in to ten.  Then pick the one you like the most.
marvelheroes,3biji0,BurnedOut_ITGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:55:11 2015 UTC,This is the advice you want to take. Just try them all and decide for yourself! You'll also get 400 eternity splinters on your 2nd day of logging in which is enough for 1 hero of your choice or 2 random ones.
marvelheroes,3biji0,ZachChaos,3,Mon Jun 29 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"Melee - Captain America  He's got good survival, doesn't have a terribly complicated resource mechanic, and his powers and animations flow together really well  Range - Cyclops or Punisher  Cyclops can use a basic power to great effect so he doesn't need a lot of spirit management early on so he's easy to level and fun at endgame. He also makes subsequent characters easier to level with his synergy.   Punisher is kinda the ranged version of Captain America, pretty forgiving resource mechanic and can take a beating"
marvelheroes,3biji0,Mgtl,3,Mon Jun 29 16:19:59 2015 UTC,Pick what hero you love the most!  Even if it's not a top teir Hero enjoy the 1st ride to 60. Do story on normal at least 1 time and most important have fun!

But they are very cheap in terms of eternity splinters so you could buy either or both with your 400 ES. For the sake of variety I'd go with a Melee hero as your starter so that way you'd have both a melee and one (or two) ranged.  My personal recommendations for a melee would be Venom, Hulk, Thing or Daredevil.  Edit: or Captain America"

If I'm really trying to get one thing and just can't farm it after hundreds of kills, I get discouraged really fast.  I get way too focused on one thing, I guess.  The takedowns really helped with that, but they need subsequent achievements to earn the same gear again.  Takedown II for Octobot please...

My interest has ebbed and flowed at times, mostly due to having other stuff going on.  But I just started playing seriously again, and prestiged some random heroes (Punisher and Thing since I hadn't played them since their reviews, Black Widow because I hadn't played her since her little QOL a couple of weeks ago...and I had her Ultron costume which is rad)...and what I'm finding is that I'm really enjoying heroes I didn't like so much before now that I am waaaaay more powerful.  Leveling BW was fucking awful the first time, totally fun now.  Good synergies, gear, omegas, stocked up artifacts, enchanted urus, etc...all really changes the game a lot.  I like to play this game while I binge on Netflix on the side monitor, though, so the mindless nature of grinding endless levels and chasing achievements works really well for me.

There are some who want brut damage but those people generally expect to get 1k+ crit damage along with 1k+ brut damage.

Plus, gear during the 1-60 grind is basically inconsequential.  For the gear you will save...for rings, I wouldn't keep any ring that isn't cosmic, period.  I wouldn't keep any cosmic ring that doesn't have at least 3 ""useful"" stats - Crit rating, crit damage, brutal rating, brutal damage, maybe hp, and maybe spirit on heroes who really struggle with that.  For insignias, I only get rid of the really bad ones - stuff like movement speed, slow %, defense rating, etc.  Any that has two useful stats, I keep.  I probably keep too many, but I went a long time without ever seeing purple insignias, so I got protective of them."

marvelheroes,3be4rv,DRACULA_WOLFMAN,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:00:15 2015 UTC,People got pissed because of the limited amount that was being offered and the time they were being offered at. There's good chunk of the player base in EU and Asia and the early morning time frame would screw them over big time.

marvelheroes,3be4rv,CaesarBritannicus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:00:28 2015 UTC,The original way they were going to do it is what made people angry. They newer way where they are up for x amount of time and won't ever come back was fine.
marvelheroes,3be4rv,Gravskin,3,Sun Jun 28 13:29:10 2015 UTC,"The ""newer"" way you're talking about is wrong. They are similar to the chase costumes in the fact that they're around for a set amount of time then go away -- then come back every so often. They're never permanently gone."
marvelheroes,3be4rv,dkphxcyke,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:43:31 2015 UTC,"They're the same thing as Chase Costumes, they just have a fancy visual you can toggle on or off."
marvelheroes,3be4rv,NightmareDJK,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:37:01 2015 UTC,"you are correct in one thing the first idea was to this costume to be limited by numbers,then it come a better idea the variant costume only for two weeks on store,it was said that these costumes will go out another time like the chase costume , but the price will be the same no disccount on these kind of costumes"
marvelheroes,3be4rv,degel02,0,Sun Jun 28 14:04:18 2015 UTC,Why would people get pissy for good costume?
marvelheroes,3be4rv,Novars,2,Sun Jun 28 13:19:28 2015 UTC,Originally the variant costumes where limited to 2000 (I think) copies of it only. They were to go up for sale at 9am on a Saturday morning and then once they were sold out that was it. After they sold they were never going to come back ever again.

marvelheroes,3bflak,Zer0113,2,Sun Jun 28 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"My laptop has problems running this game unless I change the visual settings to relatively low. You can do that in the options menu, which you get to by pressing esc.  There's also a way to change the .ini files to improve performance, but I haven't looked into that yet. Maybe someone else has the details? Or, you could probably find it via google or the forums."
marvelheroes,3bflak,unsettlingideologies,2,Sun Jun 28 20:07:43 2015 UTC,I have a laptop very similar to yours with an i7 and 8 GB of ram but no graphics card. I put everything on low and turned off particle effects and other demanding things and now I get 35+ FPS. Your laptop should have some power application installed on it that will allow you to turn on a high performance mode on your processor that will also drastically improve performance.
marvelheroes,3bflak,ZachChaos,2,Sun Jun 28 20:37:49 2015 UTC,"Just because it's an i7, doesn't mean much. There's way more to computers than just saying you have an i7 and 8 gb of ram."
marvelheroes,3bflak,breichart,3,Mon Jun 29 06:01:33 2015 UTC,"Very much this.  i7 is a product line, and being a mobile model is probably much less powerful than a desktop version (in order to use less power, for example)."
marvelheroes,3bflak,Thillygoof,2,Mon Jun 29 08:47:14 2015 UTC,"Your laptop's hardware does not meet the minimum requirements to play.  Your processor is either a i7-4510U or i7-4210U.  Not all i7s are the same.  In this case, the 'U' at the end means ultra-low power, which means the performance is cut back from standard laptop i7s to make it work in your slim laptop/ultrabook without overheating."

I am hoping that will get fixed with a quick patch.  There is also a well known memory leak issue where if you play for a long time, it consumes more and more of your memory.  It really needs to get fixed but until it does, I recommend restarting the game every once in a while to clear it.  I know it sounds silly but it works."

marvelheroes,3bflak,DigitalCapes,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:22:43 2015 UTC,"Game is for the most part just poorly optimized. It's gotten better in some areas, but still a ways to go. To help some people though, they need to simply add more display options, such as turning pc names off, the number of pc displayed needs to be turned down a bit. Even loading needs to be overdone. This game seems to load playable characters, enemies, then loot. That's why teleporting to others in midtown is usually insta death. I mean the qol changes to heros are great, but they need to do the same with an overhaul to some of the core problems."
marvelheroes,3bflak,sirius017,-1,Sun Jun 28 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"Most laptops have dual gpus.  An integrated gpu, normally Intel HDxxxx , and a dedicated gpu, nVidia or AMD.  The default setting will cause most applications to run on your integrated GPU.  Try setting for the game to run on your dedicated GPU.  That's how I get most games to run slightly faster on my craptop."
marvelheroes,3bflak,ElNutimo,5,Sun Jun 28 21:21:51 2015 UTC,"Most laptops have dual gpus.   Most laptops don't have dual GPUs.  ""Gaming"" laptops often do, if they have Intel CPUs.  AMD A-core gaming laptops have the GPU on the same die as the CPU and don't have to deal with the discrete switchable graphics issue that Intel + discrete mobile GPU laptops deal with.  Many Intel laptops rely solely on the Intel GPU, which is on the same die as the CPU, but is horrible in performance for gaming.  The latest generation of Intel's HD graphics has improved the performance from ""junk"" levels to ""able to play games on minimum settings"" levels.  This is due to their necessity to improve graphics performance in MacBooks, as they were not able to partner with a GPU maker and still win the contract."

marvelheroes,3bhxyp,Xtulu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"That tells me absolutly nothing aswell.   first, this was during the anniversary, hardly the same as the 21 days of anyone playing before or after it.  second, tell me what was your average time played, because theres a world of difference between being a social failure that clocks 12 hours a day and being an average joe with a normal life and 10 hours a week to spare  third, tell me if you spent any money on the game at all, and in that case how much  last, as someone already said you played summoner doom, which effectively is the same as playing a console game on easy AND with cheatcodes. Most ridiculously overtuned hero in this game's history, and given its past track record with some heroes, thats saying a lot...  basically, your post is lacking tons of vital information to correctly gauge the scope of your ""achievement"", and anyway your 21 days experience  cannot possibly match anyone's previous (no doom) or future (no anniversary) 21 days experience"

Your talk about Doom is just copy paste from people who never played Doom and just tell bed time stories of crap.  I have stacked 31 intelect at that time, and 31 intelect is shit load of difference in dps which result in achivement.ANY summoner with such high intelect will achieve the same result if not better.

marvelheroes,3bigze,RJofCanada,18,Mon Jun 29 18:37:22 2015 UTC,Server boost errors and event scheduling errors don't deserve compensation.  You're not losing any money.  Let's not get caught up in a culture of entitlement.
marvelheroes,3bigze,Arcath_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:02:10 2015 UTC,You kinda are if you waste boost expecting it to be a high server boost %.  I can understand the anger over the server % but the event schedule anger is silly.
marvelheroes,3bigze,Arcath_,10,Mon Jun 29 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you have to see where they are coming from.  They spend $50 on boosts thinking, ""Hey the server is supposed to be at 120% this is a good time to use them!""  Then they find out the server was actually stuck at 48% or 72%.  Think of it like an exchange rate. You want to exchange your money when the rate is high and only realize afterwards that there is a bank error and the rate bottomed for a bit.   Their boosts lost value and players feel cheated."
marvelheroes,3bigze,BurnedOut_ITGuy,3,Mon Jun 29 15:07:33 2015 UTC,"It's not a lost value though.  You paid for a +100% pot for example.  The only way you get a lost value is if that pot doesn't give you +100%.  Anything the server gives you is just gravy.  If you don't want to run with a 48% server boost, then check it before you pop your pot if it means that much to you.  And before you say ""there's no way to check"" how are these people figuring out that the boost isn't there?  That's right.  They're checking."
marvelheroes,3bigze,Arcath_,4,Mon Jun 29 15:15:53 2015 UTC,You are assuming that everyone who is mad purchased these boosts while they were on sale...  Maybe not everyone got a huge discount.   Food for thought.
marvelheroes,3bigze,Arcath_,3,Mon Jun 29 19:16:17 2015 UTC,Thing is I agree with you. But I just think people need to understand why people are upset over it.
marvelheroes,3bigze,Gauntlet_of_Might,3,Mon Jun 29 15:24:14 2015 UTC,Do you like playing the game or do you just want to be given level 60 for all your heroes?   It's a good thing this question is totally irrelevant to the issue at hand.
marvelheroes,3bigze,Gauntlet_of_Might,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:26:00 2015 UTC,It's not entitlement to expect the advertised XP rate if you bought boosts due to that information. No need to white knight corporations that mess up.

marvelheroes,3bigze,Gauntlet_of_Might,-5,Mon Jun 29 16:10:13 2015 UTC,"They were however false advertising encouraging people to spend money on boosts they otherwise might not use.  I don't have the time to play a lot during the week, and bought boosts to try and catch up on OMEGA leveling.  Due to them Fucking Up (capital letters), I got less for my money than was implied by the adverts.  How is this not effective fraud? How would you like to go to a restaurant offering free desserts, eat your meal, then at the end they say ""oh, the desserts? We don't have those""... Would you just pay the full bill without questioning it?  We are consumers and we have rights."
marvelheroes,3bigze,Mandroll,-7,Mon Jun 29 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"False advertising? Are you implying they intended on implementing a lower boost than advertised?   Intention is irrelevant, if they failed to provide an advertised boost, it's false advertising. It's the literal definition."

It was about 90 omegas/hour in loss before they bumped to 120%  Funny thing... we are still at 120% and supposed to be at 144% right now.

marvelheroes,3bigze,jmarFTL,10,Mon Jun 29 18:23:54 2015 UTC,Then ask for a chargeback.   Just be prepared to lose your Marvel Heroes AND your Steam account for doing so.
marvelheroes,3bigze,Gauntlet_of_Might,2,Mon Jun 29 18:40:25 2015 UTC,Guess again  I've easily sunk over $250-300 since June 2013 into this game.  I just don't pop boosts relying on event xp with posts both on official forums and reddit saying the xp isn't ticking up as it should then demand some sort of compensation when the issue was with the serverside and not the boost.
marvelheroes,3bigze,jmarFTL,0,Mon Jun 29 18:50:44 2015 UTC,To use your analogy it's more like the restaurant advertises free dessert *while supplies last.  If you read the ToS Gaz already covered their asses.  So it's entirely a personal decision if you want to continue doing business/playing the game.
marvelheroes,3bigze,Gauntlet_of_Might,-4,Mon Jun 29 15:22:17 2015 UTC,"Let's stop this culture of crying ""entitled"" anytime someone complains. You're correct in this case but I'm so sick of seeing it thrown around as a defense for the slightest complaint."
marvelheroes,3bigze,PraxusGaming,4,Mon Jun 29 15:24:59 2015 UTC,They are not correct though. It's literally never entitlement to complain as a consumer about a product you paid money for if it doesn't meet advertised claims. Never. Never ever ever.
marvelheroes,3bigze,Gauntlet_of_Might,4,Mon Jun 29 15:28:09 2015 UTC,"Aaannnd what was the advertised claim of a product they spent money on?  If you mean a boost they bought, the boost functions exactly as it says. What this is complaining about is they thought they'd get a bigger server-side boost. But that's not ""advertised"" or sold. It's a free event that they don't even have to be doing. That's where the entitlement comes from."
marvelheroes,3bigze,PraxusGaming,0,Mon Jun 29 15:29:56 2015 UTC,"Wrong, if you make a purchase based on an environment that the company completely controls and then they choose not to honor it, it's not entitlement to want compensation for that false claim."
marvelheroes,3bigze,makone222,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"The false claim is for something completely free. They owe you, actually, nothing. It could be 0% server side boost against them and you would have 0 claim against them because it's completely free and they don't have to do it.   What you're talking about is consumer expectations going beyond the advertisement for the paid product. All they are obligated to do when delivering something you purchase is that it functions as it said. If you had expectations beyond that (server side boost), that's on you. You bought something ""based on"" the environment but the advertisement for the boosts said nothing about the environment. There was no guarantee of anything.  I get being upset that the server side boost isn't functioning as it should. I'm frustrated too and I'm not saying people shouldn't complain. But compensation? Please. Get a life.

Follow the Odin's bounty. Reroll LQs to match the location.   Use the boosted serverside XP to level every character you have unlocked in your roster. This will start stacking your hero synergy xp.   Remember, Holosim till level 20 is probably the still the best way to level pre-LQs. Unless the odins bounty is in Midtown, then just go there. Or ICP @ 12 or 13 if the Odin's bounty is there.  Dailies then Leveling all your characters to 60 should be your prime focus.  Check under the calendar on the left @ MHBugle for an Odin's Bounty tracker."

Super great if you can combine it with legendary quests for max XP, but it can be really expensive to re-roll LQs for a new player, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.  If you're a money-spending type, you can also take advantage of the buy-one-get-one sale, where you get a random hero/costume for each hero/costume you buy.

You'll always have 1 available to you and every time you complete it or reroll it you'll get a different one.  As far as I know most people consider legendary quests to be the best way to level up, EXCEPT when there's an event going on like right now. But if you can do both, like for example Midtown has the odins bounty and you get a midtown legendary quest, you can get a lot of XP in not a lot of time.  Also, most people recommend to reroll all story mode legendary quests you get, since the XP they give out for how long it takes to complete them isn't worth the time.  Happy leveling!"

marvelheroes,3bexzh,fps916,2,Sun Jun 28 17:06:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  Does this apply to regular non-event days as well?
marvelheroes,3bexzh,fps916,3,Sun Jun 28 17:11:08 2015 UTC,Bosses drop exponentionally more XP than the trash mobs. Rushing bosses will always yield a higher return per minute farming.

marvelheroes,3bexzh,LineNoise54,3,Sun Jun 28 19:07:11 2015 UTC,"If someone is boosted to the gills, there's a big incentive to ""hub farm"" to get maximum return from the boosts.  I've seen people set an egg timer for 8 minutes for Splinter farming with massive SiF boosts.  Or just camp LFG waiting for boss invites during Omega weeks.  You can make a 2h boost last for days that way."
marvelheroes,3bexzh,shogunreaper,2,Mon Jun 29 00:26:54 2015 UTC,they take longer to kill since people are around them and not attacking.  so boosts are ticking down.
marvelheroes,3bexzh,Novars,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:31:59 2015 UTC,Your question should be boss rush or legendary quest. Been wondering about it myself
marvelheroes,3bexzh,LineNoise54,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:42:24 2015 UTC,"For leveling, it's more usually more effective to roll for term LQs and complete them.  I think that Odin is enough bonus that I would just boss-rush Red Tasky, or one of the other short terms.  I haven't done the math, mind.  I just feel like you lose so much play time fishing for the right LQs, and then you get something like Mandarin that takes just enough longer.  Just rush boxes."

marvelheroes,3beez1,izbun,3,Sun Jun 28 13:27:07 2015 UTC,Well ya see here's the thing about thing...thing's thing isn't the only thing thing can do. Thing can do things like damage and thing can taunt and run around things.
marvelheroes,3beez1,asylum101,2,Sun Jun 28 13:51:38 2015 UTC,"If thing has 50-60k he can probably do decent damage but he's not gonna be top TTK or anything. my thing has almost 30k hp and a 38s ttk. to get 50-60k hp i'd have to sacrifice some of my gear which gives DPS for health stuff... trade in the bullseye medallion for a jugg, trade the hammer of angrim for kirby, trade my 1k cdr and 1k bdr on my insig for a valkyrie with 4k hp... that's losing out on a ton of useful affixes which give great damage just to bump his health up by about 20k... the only skill he has that scales on health does not scale all too well. I think it's like 500 HP gives 1% damage, it takes 50,000 HP to give 100% damage."
marvelheroes,3beez1,OctaShot,2,Sun Jun 28 14:00:54 2015 UTC,You can get to 40k HP without making too many sacrifices. A level 69 Immortal Spirit of Kirby gives 16.5k HP. Using this over his other slot 5 makes for a very tanky Thing. His other uniques now (level 69 because that's the goal). Slot 2 2.5k HP. Slot 3 3.1k HP. Slot 4 3.1k HP. Total from uniques: 25.2k HP.  Now on to artifacts. ILAS gives 2.3k HP. Hyde's Formula gives 1.5k HP. You also want to use a GoK and SWGN which don't give HP but are too good to pass up. Total from artifacts: 3.8k HP.  Add that 29k to whatever his base level 60 HP is and you have a very tanky thing. You didn't even compromise his damage with this build. You can always switch between Kirby and Hammer whenever you need to.
marvelheroes,3beez1,WhatImMike,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:36:24 2015 UTC,If you can kill cosmic terms in a timely manner then go for it. If not then having massive amounts of hp defeats the purpose.

marvelheroes,3beez1,UndilutedZealot,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:01:28 2015 UTC,"It all sort of depends on what you want to do really.  If you're building a lot of hp and defense, then you're probably not going to get picked up for an axis raid or probably even a red raid.  Green raid literally anyone can do.  On the other side, however, I build my thing pretty tanky (white suit jacket, kingpin medallion, accoc, and kirby's immortal spirit) because he's my go-to guy for cosmic farming.  There are probably better heroes for cosmic farming, but I don't have everyone.  Of all the heroes I have, and some of them are VERY geared, he's the most fun to farm cosmic terminals and patrols because it's REALLY hard to kill him.  If I went in with Vision and did everything perfectly, I could kill cosmic Kurse pretty quickly, same with IM or Gambit.  However, those guys are squishy.  If I screw up once, I have to run back, which takes time.  Thing just doesn't die, especially if youse Yancy Street Gang (i call 'em the goon squad).  TL;DR not enough damage to be viable in red or axis, but the tankiness makes him my go to farmer for cosmic terminals and patrols."

marvelheroes,3bc3tm,Mandroll,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:07:18 2015 UTC,"The short answer is yes, use xp boosts on this event, ideally during the last day or two when the stacking server-side bonus is at its max.  Depending on what your current priorities are, the omega event or cosmic chaos are generally the two ideal places to use boosts. The current event has both (plus a pile of other things)."
marvelheroes,3bbzvc,Arcath_,2,Sat Jun 27 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"Make sure you have ""Cosmic Week Bonus"" unchecked, (since they didn't mention it on the patch notes) and it gives 2.94 omegas per run.   Seems pretty accurate.  Disregard, I'm an idiot."

marvelheroes,3bbzvc,Gentleman_Asshole,2,Sat Jun 27 20:00:35 2015 UTC,"Welp, I was mistaken.  It usually falls under ""Cosmic bosses drop double loot"" which IS in the patch notes.   So it should be on, but it's possible they changed it to just drop double loot and not double XP. Or they forgot to turn it on.   Just did some testing, the boost is on, check cosmic week and set the green orbs to 24 in the calculator.   Usually it's 24 orbs per kill, must be a typo that the calculator says 44 by default.   Should give you an accurate result now."

marvelheroes,3bbzvc,Xiaz89,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:02:21 2015 UTC,200% synergy only works if you're under level 60 IIRC.   I'm 93% sure that is incorrect. Until shown a link to a dev response on the subject or hard run tests I'm gonna continue to operate under the assumption that the bonus is applied at ALL levels. Even 60.
marvelheroes,3bbzvc,Xiaz89,0,Sat Jun 27 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"""at level 60 or below""  That includes level 60."
marvelheroes,3bbzvc,shogunreaper,0,Sat Jun 27 22:52:33 2015 UTC,What....?
marvelheroes,3bbzvc,CommissarSCV,2,Sat Jun 27 22:58:10 2015 UTC,Does this mean leveling omegas are faster below 60 as a result? And how far below 60 do you need to be before the 200% bonus is made up for in increased XP from being higher level.
marvelheroes,3bbzvc,droid327,2,Sat Jun 27 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"When I have a handful of characters sitting at around 50 just for their synergy bonuses this information is quite helpful, thank you!"
marvelheroes,3bdbak,TheWiseMountain,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:30:36 2015 UTC,"that's never gonna happen lol, I'd like it too but that would affect people using actual money to buy heroes. Being able to get 100 of 175 back every time you randomed a dupe would be too good."
marvelheroes,3bdbak,demonlegato,3,Sun Jun 28 06:27:32 2015 UTC,"To be fair he's talking about an ultimate upgrade token, not a hero token that upgrades an ult if you already own the hero (which is why you're talking about)."
marvelheroes,3bdbak,SupaTrooper,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:35:41 2015 UTC,that being said I would like more options of what to do with dupe hero token. I mean 175 ES for a random unique seams like the definition of a rip off to me. i'm not that worried for now my highest ult is a 12 and as new heroes are added the chances of me getting to 20 just doing random rolls diminishes monthly. but it will happen sooner or later that I have max ult in something and then I am going to be pissed if that is all I can do with my token.
marvelheroes,3bdbak,fader48080,2,Sun Jun 28 08:50:41 2015 UTC,That's why you don't get randoms anymore when you have more than half of the heroes. You're not supposed to be able to get everything efficiently with just always getting a random box.

marvelheroes,3bdbak,168523,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:59:04 2015 UTC,"There is a trade-in for ultimate tokens.  It was really intended for people who already have +20 ultimate on a hero at 60.  I think you get something like 1 random unique at 60 per ultimate token.  Personally? I would just click the tokens even if I thought I'd never play those heroes again.    I think they have a lot of reasons for avoiding any trade-in for ultimate tokens to splinters.  If they did, they would be adding a way (albeit a round-about-way) to turn cash into splinters.  From a programmer point of view, this adds a risk whereby a future change in the code could bork the whole system and economy over the weekend.  Devs could put in some last-minute sale on a character's anniversary for some uber discount like 2$ only to discover too late hundreds of players just bought taskmaster multiple times to translate the tokens into splinters and get all the 600 splinter heroes at a discount.  If you are talking about the any-hero-you-want ultimate upgrade tokens, just use them on your next hero you get to 52 and enjoy the extra couple seconds added to your ultimate time while you level up to 60."
marvelheroes,3bdbak,Suzina,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:00:54 2015 UTC,You can't buy a random hero box or upgrade tokens with cash though.

marvelheroes,3bdbak,fader48080,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:09:15 2015 UTC,I likerunning 1 to 60 as well but sooner or later yo uwill want to prestige your favorites. at that point in time at the very least the increased ult makes your signature power better giving you a slight increase for half of your total levels and lets face it about 2/3rds of your play time on any particular hero.

marvelheroes,3bby7p,justbearaly,10,Sat Jun 27 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"HULK, Venom, Juggernaut, Captain America, or Thing are your best options.   None of these will fit the traditional ""tank"" style though. ""Taunts"" straight up suck atm. So the concept of ""holding aggro"" is irrelevant. You're best bet is to focus on stuns/fears and of course dps. A dead enemy is a controlled enemy!   ""Tanking in raids (or cmm)"" is often as simple as ""go in first"". However, many of the bosses have skills or attack patterns that will cause them to move and then re-select a target. Learn their attack patterns and move with them to make sure you are the target they select.   Even if you follow the rules above you will likely find ""playing a tank"" to be about 10% of the effectiveness of other games. In most situations there's just no real call for a ""traditional tank""."
marvelheroes,3bby7p,NullRage,3,Sat Jun 27 22:48:32 2015 UTC,Thank you! Very helpful!  I was just curious how close I can get.
marvelheroes,3bby7p,haroldsavatar,3,Sun Jun 28 00:13:22 2015 UTC,HULK IS STRONGEST ONE THERE IS!
marvelheroes,3bby7p,euk_,2,Sun Jun 28 06:53:47 2015 UTC,"Hulk is not nearly as durable as many people think. Everyone else on this list is, though."
marvelheroes,3bby7p,NullRage,4,Sun Jun 28 12:32:31 2015 UTC,"Hulk can still compete for ""tank status"" if built properly. Also, with the combination of knockdowns and his fear shout hes go a lot of CC which is more important than taunts as explained above.   That said, I agree he's not ""as durable as many people think"". Still a contender though."
marvelheroes,3bby7p,DKZeph,5,Sun Jun 28 14:00:29 2015 UTC,"Aggro grabbing like most mmo tanks do (taunts) won't work as the boss quickly get immune to CCs (which it count as) once a fight is underway, but someone with a good output (to ""grab"" the aggro the old way), good life sustain (To face tank (minus the dodging the one shots dash/rolls) and one or two Irresistible CC to interrupt would probably fit the bill well enough.  Ghost Rider would fulfill all those requirements, imo, he has good DPS (not quite top of the pack, but still well within the top half.), is sturdy (despite having a low HP playstyle) and his CC breaker (Dread) is actually an irresistible 1s Cower effect on a fairly short CD. His Signature also has a somewhat irresistible CC effect (""stun"" the target and cower everyone else around while it's underway (2s channel for huge damage.), but some bosses sometime ignore it.

marvelheroes,3bby7p,unsettlingideologies,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"You can't get anywhere close, because you cannot fulfill the fundamental, #1 priority of a tank: to make enemies attack you instead other people.  It's like asking ""I know I can't attack anyone, but how can I make a character that comes as close to being a DPS as possible in Gone Home?"".  There are no characters, no skills, and no mechanics that will let you do anything even remotely resembling a tank's job for anything more than a few moments."
marvelheroes,3bby7p,Muspel,2,Sat Jun 27 22:54:34 2015 UTC,"You make it sound like the enemies' targeting is completely random, but it's not. At the very least, enemies will target folks who are closer to them (thus why ranged characters can have less HP/Def and still survive fairly well), but it seems to be more than that as well. For example, Rogue's Southern Belle power claims to apply a taunt and suggests that it modifies aggro. I've heard that Taunts (like CC's) don't work on raid bosses, but do they work on other bosses? On mobs? Even if they only work on Mobs, they could be useful in CMM/CICP.  I guess I'm looking for more detail when people say that you can't make a tank/taunts don't work in this game."
marvelheroes,3bby7p,unsettlingideologies,2,Sun Jun 28 04:53:31 2015 UTC,"You make it sound like the enemies' targeting is completely random, but it's not. At the very least, enemies will target folks who are closer to them   Yes, but if there's more than one person in melee, there's not really anything you can do to make the boss target you over the much-squishier Nightcrawler standing next to you.   For example, Rogue's Southern Belle power claims to apply a taunt and suggests that it modifies aggro. I've heard that Taunts (like CC's) don't work on raid bosses, but do they work on other bosses? On mobs? Even if they only work on Mobs, they could be useful in CMM/CICP.   Taunts function like normal CCs, which means that bosses gain immunity to them for a fairly long period of time after being affected once.   I guess I'm looking for more detail when people say that you can't make a tank/taunts don't work in this game.   Enemies do not have threat tables. The only way to make an enemy attack you is to taunt it (which lasts for a few seconds and only works once), or to stand closer to it if it uses proximity-based targeting, as opposed moving around randomly.  In pretty much any game, a tank has three priorities that must be fulfilled in the following order: keep enemies on them, don't die to burst damage, and don't die to attrition.  In Marvel Heroes, there is no way to meet the first goal. Thus, you cannot tank. It doesn't matter how durable you are-- if you can't keep an enemy from attacking whoever or whatever they want, you aren't a tank."

marvelheroes,3bby7p,zeCrazyEye,4,Sun Jun 28 02:05:52 2015 UTC,"There is no aggro control so defensive stats are entirely a waste once you have just enough to stay alive.  Once you have just enough to stay alive everything else should be offensive.  But, if you do want to ramp up defense, the slots you want to go defensive on are your core, relic, insignia, medallion, ring, uru, technically in that order because of the way stats are allocated on them (that is you give up less dps per point of survivability).  The nice thing about those slots is they give you better fine control.. trying to switch to defensive uniques forces you to give up way too much offensive stats.  You'll also find you can already completely overkill the defensive stats with just those slots if that's what you want to do, especially if you throw in some defensive omega powers too.  So I'd go with a 25% medkit + invuln + 1750hp core, stack of 1000 lemuria relics, and a Mr. Hyde medallion.  Then get an insignia with 1800+ hp, ring with hp, an 800 defense uru.  Use some omega points on whatever gives +hp, possibly grab the omega power that procs weakness if you don't have weakness on an ability already.  If your hero specific slot 1/2/5 don't have +hp possibly throw in Overseer's Hammer/Brimstone's Hide/Claws of the Sister if they work for you.  Don't get more +defense, you start out so high in diminishing returns on defense that more doesn't matter compared to +hp."
marvelheroes,3bby7p,Jortsfan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:58:25 2015 UTC,"Very interesting about leaving the uniques alone. Thoughtful answer!  I see items in the game that are clearly meant for a tank, modok medallion comes to mind, which makes me think there must be some kind of tank build no matter what people say.  I am finding that the characters are feeling so similar... Find the boss and blast away, the way that you blast is just slightly different.  I was just thinking there might be a fun way to be useful besides blasting away.  I will give some of these tips a try and see what I can do. Thank you!"
marvelheroes,3bby7p,easypeasy6,3,Sun Jun 28 00:23:40 2015 UTC,"I see items in the game that are clearly meant for a tank, modok medallion comes to mind, which makes me think there must be some kind of tank build no matter what people say.   That's because they've gone through several iterations of game mechanics philosophy and there are vestigial items laying around that are completely ineffective/never were effective to begin with because they were designed with a defense system goal that never actually showed up in the game.  For example originally all the heroes you would call a 'tank' (Colossus, Thing, Ms. Marvel, Thor, etc) had both taunts and an active block ability.   Since release dodge has been nerfed from 100% to 50%, active blocks removed, defense changed from absolute damage reduction to % damage reduction, etc.    A lot of original items like MODOK just never worked well (largely because of taunt immunity), and +defense and +durability have just never been good and never will be unless they change the defense curve."
marvelheroes,3bby7p,easypeasy6,4,Sun Jun 28 00:35:34 2015 UTC,Spider-Man teamup.   Not being sarcastic at all. Teamups can be close to immortal now and Spidey has a taunt where the duration exceeds the cooldown without a lot of points.
marvelheroes,3bby7p,The-MadTitan,0,Sun Jun 28 00:04:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I bought Janet team up because I liked her character better, but it seems she only damages and didn't have much in the way of utility."

You can find a good medium ground and never have to worry about dying"
marvelheroes,3bby7p,FFIXMaster,2,Mon Jun 29 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of people will over look Colossus, though his damage isn't the highest atm. He has had a unique review that makes him a true tank now, it almost all revolves arounds his armor values and hp, plus iirc his sig is irresistable plus stops attacks for a time to recover. I suggest taking a look at the old steel bunny."

In turn, that's the same premise of anything else in this game. Just make a glass cannon and win the game"
marvelheroes,3bby7p,168523,2,Sat Jun 27 20:59:22 2015 UTC,It is true that things have moved toward the glass cannon thing.  I've seen builds where people neglect all defensive passives in order to put more DPS into the rotation.  They say you should use a invul on medkit core and suck down medkits every 10 seconds in order to stay alive.
marvelheroes,3bby7p,Sabahe,2,Sat Jun 27 23:33:22 2015 UTC,This.  While you can make a more tank-oriented character.  It just seems easier and more effective to go with a damage build instead.
marvelheroes,3bby7p,Shwagoblin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:10:57 2015 UTC,"That's a shame if it really is only glass cannons.

marvelheroes,3bby7p,CrashdummyMH,2,Sat Jun 27 21:07:17 2015 UTC,"Life sustain (defense, negation, life-on-hit, HP) is very important... right up until you reach the point where you stop dying, and then any more is wasted and you want to build full DPS.  The thing is, you don't need very much life sustain to reach the point where you stop dying if you can read boss tells and avoid their spike damage."
marvelheroes,3bby7p,ProfJackAss,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:38:00 2015 UTC,"Those 3 things are important, but not at the cost of dps. Maybe dmg negation and life on hit ONLY to live long enough to take boss down. If you survive, you can just teleport and lick your wounds (medkit)"

marvelheroes,3bbcse,BloodEBalls,2,Sat Jun 27 16:21:45 2015 UTC,Odin marks are used (300 of them) to buy a legendary item from a vendor in Asgard.  That item goes in your legendary slot.  After that I think you can use them to enchant your artifacts (100 each here) to make them more powerful.
marvelheroes,3bbcse,emdeemcd,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:40:39 2015 UTC,"Odin Marks are for your legendary item and to bless your artifacts. So collect all of that. Once you have 300, look into buying a legendary from the vendor in Asgard.   Runes are sort of difficult to say which you should keep. The rarer runes are a must (doop, tyr, frigga, sif... Etc), you'll need these for end game. I don't have a link to list them all, but it's worth doing a quick search on 'em.   Right now is the best time to farm marks, worldstones, cake, and shield omega files (from Agent Coulson). You get a good chunk of exp from farming the odin bounty chests and doing your daily quest from Agent Coulson. Other than that, the worldstones are used to buy items such as the Power Cosmic and Doop runeword crafting recipes."

You can't see which runes you will likely need until you level it up so see if you can find the recipes on the net. Some of the common ones are very useful and you will need a lot of them. If you want to make a lot of 60s you will pretty much need to devote a whole stash tab for runes.

That's why this issue wasn't seen by QA or the devs, like experienced players they have learned to tune out anything that doesn't have a health bar.

But the individual items within also drop with a higher rate than a costume. While costumes are cosmetics, the only ways to obtain them are from prestige, drop or buying them. With buying them being the most common way, also a lot more work has gone into creating costumes as opposed to a single item."

Also, as people ""entitled"" to the team up— the developers said they were releasing a free team up for the event. They set the schedule for the event, and decided to offer it, so if they failed to deliver on that, I'd complain more about Gaz having no management/planning skills, that about fans being ""entitled""."

After blowing up a squad of enemy soldiers, he decides to run for his life. Passed out in the snow after four days of fleeing, he was rescued by a troop of Japanese Macaques. The monkeys allowed the assassin into their clan, with the exception of a lone monkey. The man knew that he would be hunted so he trained daily using snowmen as training dummies. Quietly, the monkey that distrusted him watched, and eventually picked up on the fighter's skills. The assassin's health began to fail, and as the tribe of monkeys tried to save him, the lone monkey objected, eventually fighting the rest of the group with his newfound skills. Because of the violence he displayed, the monkey was banished from his clan. However, on his own, he saw a group of men on their way to kill the assassin. He tried to run back and warn his tribe, but it was too late - the assassin had been killed as well as the rest of the monkeys. Furious at his clan's slaughter, the monkey picked up extra guns from a bag and proceeded to kill the entire group of men. Determined to avenge his fallen tribe, the monkey now dedicated his life to killing assassins - under the alias of Hit-Monkey."

Doing a little research, I was looking for input more like this:   Want a TU that gives summons? (Magik>Coulson>Clea) AoE lacking on your hero and want an active TU to help? (Wasp>Coulson>Firestar) Want the TU with the fastest active single target TTK? (Sam Wilson>Coulson>Wolverine)   Regarding cosmic gear, I haven't seen any analysis, but skimming the list my guess is best active dps may come from:   TU gets +20% dmg to bosses for 10s when you hit TU gets stacking 1% dmg when you defeat TU get +20% dmg for 5s when you medkit   Disclaimer: I've tested exactly none of this."
marvelheroes,3bawqc,Prodigal_Ink,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:46:34 2015 UTC,You should only have one build for the team ups and that's full damage get gear that has special skill damage>base damage > critical chance >brut chance > rest.  My drax team up has my best possible cosmic gear on him and he is destroying everything getting 2mil brutals with his leap skill etc you need the damage on medkit and dmg on boss hit though to reach the high dps levels.  Their are better team up ttks though. I think it's coulsen >clea >wolverine.

marvelheroes,3bawqc,droid327,0,Sat Jun 27 18:38:54 2015 UTC,"There's really only two ""roles"" I see for Team Up gearing:  1) Active DPS/tank, so gear with full ""for them"" bonuses to boost their damage.  Probably best on a melee TU so they draw more attention from enemies.  Wolverine seems to be pretty good for this, and you'll get him at Day 200.  2) Away mode stat stick, so again gear entirely with ""for you"" affixes.    You don't really have to choose between ""farming stats"" and ""damage stats"" because there's only 1 slot where you cant have both...Communicator can roll with RIF, SIF, and CF, as well as CDR and P/M/E damage, so you cant have it all.  On the other slots, you can have both the ""farming"" affix and the ""damage"" affix.  You'll just have to toggle between Ranged/Melee and P/M/E options, as appropriate for the hero you're using."
marvelheroes,3bawqc,tarrach,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:11:50 2015 UTC,What of Clea? She has a few buffs so seems to be a solid active support TU. (I don't have her maxed yet so can't say how she works in practice)
marvelheroes,3bawqc,droid327,0,Sat Jun 27 19:42:47 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with active support team ups is in any situation where you really need their buffs, they'd likely die very quickly, and a dead TU means 2 1/2 mins with no buffs at all.  Plus, almost all the active buffs for TUs are also their away powers, so the only difference is the cool down, but you get a bonus buff if they're in Away mode and you don't have to worry about them dying."
marvelheroes,3bawqc,riidiii,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"Outside of cosmic patrol zones (and raiding - never done that) my team-ups pretty much never die when they're on active, they're really quite good at living through stuff. In the cosmic patrol zones, yeah, they die off from time to time, but less often than I do! Invariably I'm able to call them straight back if they do fall over.  Now that cosmic team-up gear is dropping more often I try to make sure they all have the 100% heal on medpac use. I don't watch their health but if I need to heal, the chances are they're taking some damage too. I also put 1pt in all the benefit while away powers so that if my team-up does keep dying I'm still able to get occasional help.  All that said, I am stockpiling -3s cooldown gear to see what kind of awesome always-away team-up I can get going."
marvelheroes,3bawqc,droid327,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't raid either but CPZs and Ultron Mode are where you need them, endgame....Cosmic terms and regular patrols are a cakewalk, with or without a teamup.  But they will die if they try to facetank a pack of CPZ bosses, or one of the Iron Legion's telegraph attacks, and that's exactly where you'd want their help the most.  Also -3s doesn't stack, if that's what you were thinking :)"

It happens but, for the most part, I'm far more squishy. When things get dangerous my medpac usage probably keeps my team-up in the battle just fine.  FWIW, my own survivability is the reason I keep my team-up on active. 10% damage mitigation is quite a nice perk compared to most of the utility powers/away benefits that most team-ups offer."

I was griding Doc Oc during the last terminal rotation and I was getting 2-3 omegas every run and had about 450 omegas by the end of the 3 hour rotation, 2 team ups to 60, a 3rd at 45, and 5.5 stash tabs of odin boxes.  This is during day 2 of the event.  This will be multiplied even more on Tues/Wed.  Also... I am not sure how this works so someone please explain if you can. But using the Odin boxes on holo sim... supposedly gives more XP per wave? Is this true?"
marvelheroes,3b8rvr,Arcath_,6,Fri Jun 26 22:31:00 2015 UTC,Getting 2-3 omega orbs per run?  Obviously boosted. Good job with that comparison
marvelheroes,3b8rvr,Novars,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:37:19 2015 UTC,"Wave 15+ of Holosim, but it's kinda a waste.  The Shield Rooftop Checkpoint in Chapter 1 provides the same boost as Holosim 15, and zero effort to get to.  Note that this is only Odin boxes, they patched all the other ones."

His melee and gadget skill choices would directly effect his octobot summons making each summon be possibly 2 different summons.  Like how some skill choices block other choices on venom, some melee choices or gadget choices would block their corresponding choice in one of the other 2 trees.  For instance, you can have melee skill A, gadget skill A, but not summon skill A.  Or you could have Summon skill A and melee skill A but not gadget skill A.  Could even expand upon the added effects to octobot summons as added effect to the corresponding skill regardless of what tree.  So if melee skill A made Summon skill A have a hefty melee component, it may have Gadget skill A have some other component as well and vice versa.

Wolverine is basically why they had a claws/regen scrapper to begin with. Hulk plays somewhat like an ss/ invuln brute. A lot of the ranged dps will feel like blasters and as mentioned, Dr. Doom is basically a bots/dark mastermind.   Controllers, defenders, and corruptors are largely not represented based on gameplay style, but since a lot of the basis for CoH AT's is drawn from these characters, there's a lot of thematic overlap."

I do play occasionally, but if you are looking for another COH, Marvel Heroes is not it. Honestly, nothing can replace COH, out of all the MMOs that I played COH was just the best put together, user friendly, character creation and fun. I played the entire time it was out from conception to it's demise. I'm an old time Marvel Comics fan, and Marvel Heroes when I play it takes up that place in my heart where I know I am using an actual Marvel Comics character, and not just one that I made that looks like it in COH. To me that is the best part of playing Marvel Heroes. It's legit."

marvelheroes,3b7p2c,hawkun,4,Fri Jun 26 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"I miss CoH.  My 2 favorite toons were my MA/regen scrapper and my electricity/electricity blaster (until ""enhancement diversification"" killed my build). I guess if we ever get a playable Electro I'll have my blaster again.   I didn't play defenders much, but wasn't there a storm/electricity defender? Storm could fill that role, though she packs a lot of damage so I'd consider her more of a blaster. Wolverine would also be your claws/regen scrapper. Scarlet Witch would be a psychic/mental blaster. Hawkeye's your archery blaster. How about Venom as a dark melee/dark armor tanker?"
marvelheroes,3b7p2c,CaesarBritannicus,4,Fri Jun 26 17:39:00 2015 UTC,Storm definitely has a few skills which remind me of the Weather defender set (which was among my favorite defender sets).

marvelheroes,3b7p2c,Harlequin565,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"I had the same feeling about X-23. She's working through Cosmic prestige at the moment and it's proper fun. Claws all the way and solos as well as any Scrapper.  Storm, as has been mentioned, is probably more of an Elec/Storm Cor than a Defender. But she can churn out damage like a blaster if geared properly.  Invisible Woman was the closest I got to a proper Defender build but to be honest, stuff melts so fast, her bubbles aren't anywhere near as useful as Defender bubbles were. She can also dish out some nice damage if geared properly.  Scarlet Witch roars through content like my Fire/Storm troller. Has support capability (limited though support is in this game) but is pretty much untouchable.  My two ""surprise"" favourites though have been Nightcrawler and Psylocke. Nightcrawlers teleport moves are so shiny and Gaz have done teleport in just the way I'd wished CoX was. The CoX animations made TP such a slow travel power compared to SS (even with shift+click bindings) and you couldn't TP through walls with it :( His TP moves are really unique and yet he plays so well. If CoX had ever done Teleportation as a powerset, this is how I'd want to see it played out.  Ms Marvel reminds me of my En/En blapper but is far tougher, less mobile and less ranged options. She just needs SS+CJ to get that proper feel...  Black Panther I play like an Nin-Nin Stalker. He's a bit squishy as he stands but is on my ""to play a bit more"" list.  That's my tuppence!"

Then after a hiatus after leveling iron man, I bought a boost for splinters, and got magneto a few weeks after he released (or whatever the breakpoint is where he can drop from a box after being released... If there is one)  Then I think while leveling that magneto I turned in my splinters and got venom, and I think storm too a week later? then just now I did a bogo and bought doom and got free Thor who I'd wanted for awhile.

marvelheroes,3b6d2a,tarrach,5,Sat Jun 27 07:31:46 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, loot is determined when the chest drops, not when it's opened, so they aren't identical and thus it's harder (though probably not impossible) to stack them."
marvelheroes,3b6d2a,grumbled0r,3,Fri Jun 26 12:02:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how this myth keeps getting circulated,  and it's easy to disprove.    Go farm an ICP chest,  give it to another character and open it there.   The gear will be weighted to the character who opened the box,  and not the character who farmed it.     If loot is determined when it drops,  it would be weighted towards the character who initially picked it up.   It is far more efficient to run an algorithm when the chest is opened, than it is to run an algorithm when the chest is dropped and then store all the variables of the items that are contained in the chest in a database for an indefinite time until it is opened.   In one scenario the database only needs to know the type of chest and what level it is.   In the other,  the database needs to store the type of chest,  what level it is,  what each individual item is in the chest,  what each individual item's level is,  how other stuff is in there (hp orbs,  health packs,  xp orbs, gold)"
marvelheroes,3b6d2a,tarrach,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"That doesn't necessarily disprove it, the type of item could still be determined at spawn (f.e. cosmic slot 1, cosmic slot 3, Unique slot 2, 8*XP orbs), but the actual rolls done when opening it.  I do agree that it would be more efficient to determine loot when opening the box, so I'll stop stating either as true for now."

marvelheroes,3b7wn8,ohoni,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:43:26 2015 UTC,"I did it this morning. Midtown is probably better but I can assure you, the people yelling for you to save them from lizards count towards the current shared quest :)"
marvelheroes,3b7wn8,emandinga,2,Fri Jun 26 19:27:56 2015 UTC,"Well, some do, yeah, the ones that give yellow orbs, especially, but there are a bunch of random screaming people that run away when you kill the nearby mobs, and I don't think those count, so it gives the impression that you're ""saving"" a lot more people than you are."
marvelheroes,3b7wn8,ohoni,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:42:24 2015 UTC,I would say that sounds fine. I was busy trying to smash the monkey barrels and kill lizards that the ones I saved all seemed to count but it's neither here nor there. If Midtown is easier that's fine. Since you are in BZ doing the majority of that Daily it just makes more sense to save what is in front of you but whatever floats your skirt :)
marvelheroes,3b7wn8,emandinga,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, sure, I mean, save everyone you see wherever you go, there are plenty of ""save people"" achievements out there. But the question was about the best ways to farm rescues, so BZ isn't really it. Honestly, given all the monkey barrels involved, I often skip the BZ daily entirely.   I would say for best rescue farming it's Midtown>Industry City>Bronx. There are also a few in terminals like Kurse. I'm not even sure whether civies in other modes count, like Holosim(Pyro/Venom/Hulk/etc.), X-Defense, Story mode, etc.   One thing to keep in mind for farming the Groot achievement, btw, Groot must be OUT while doing this one (which is true for all team-ups). If you have him equipped but in passive mode you get no credit."
marvelheroes,3b7wn8,ohoni,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:20:38 2015 UTC,"I completely misunderstood the reason for the original post then. I assumed (my fault) this was in relation to today's particular Daily Shared Quest. In general terms, I have no idea where the best place to farm civilian rescues is. I know where that quest is in Guild Wars 2 though :P"
marvelheroes,3b7sl3,Pokebalzac,7,Fri Jun 26 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"Every time this question comes up, someone leaves a comment linking to jm.shost.ca and while it's a good starting point, it often just adds more confusion for new players. It basically tells you that most items are potentially useful to some hero. This was a bigger deal when most hero-specific uniques were terrible and you had heroes like Ms. Marvel who only used one or two of her own uniques. More recently, Amthua has been systematically going through each heroes uniques and updating them, making them more relevant and useful.  So my suggestion to you (and what I do personally when cleaning out my inventory) is this: Use the list at jm.shost.ca, but click through on each item to get the the marvelheroes.info page for that item. On that page, you can see a section called ""Build Tags"". This shows you where other players have listed this item as part of their builds. If there are a lot of tags, it can be inferred that the item is probably pretty useful, because a lot of people are using it. You can also click on those tags to see what kinds of builds are using that particular item. Conversely, if an item has few or no tags, it's probably not very useful or only serves a niche purpose. Of course, it's best to use your own judgment as to what may or may not be useful to your particular situation, but if you are starting out and don't have an a strong handle on what to look for, this is a good starting point.  Lastly, here's a few common drop items off the top of my head that I think are universally considered trash and can be safely exchanged for runes/credits or donated to pets. This is by no means an exhaustive list, and others might disagree with some of these items, but this is my personal opinion.   Amulet of Right Aunt May's Cane Facet of the Uni-Power Magnetic Field Generator Nega-Bands Oscorp Prototype Generator Sandals of Hercules Tactigon Satan Claw SHIELD Life Support Gear Slab of Subterranea Starktech Portal Reactor Universal Weapon Unstable Carbodium Warsuit   Hope this helps!"
marvelheroes,3b7sl3,fctd,3,Fri Jun 26 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"Just to add another voice, there is not a single item on that list that I would keep for any hero.    It may not be complete but if you have any of those, they are 1/4 of a relic stack or 1/5 of a credit box every. single. time.  There's very few of non-boss any-hero uniques that I keep, though.  The ones I do are: Nate Grey's Psionic Armor, Darkhold, Dragonfang, and Cerebro slot 5 (forget the name), though with Loki/Emma/Dr. Strange reviews that one is hopefully going away soon as well  Boss uniques are generally good and used by someone.  Kirigi's and Kingpin's are the two off the top of my head that aren't very useful for anyone."
marvelheroes,3b7sl3,Shaker_,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:02:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I definitely have dupes of some of these that I can convert to better use!  I guess I wrote my question pretty inexpertly though, what I'm really trying to figure out is what stats to prioritize when choosing between copies of the same unique -- obviously some are better almost across the board, but other times one is higher in a few areas than the other."
marvelheroes,3b7sl3,dkphxcyke,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:43:40 2015 UTC,It depends on what you want to prioritize. Do you want to go for max stats? do you want to go for mostly defense? mostly offense?  these are pretty basic questions as far as RPG's go and the only one that can answer them is you.  You can find out what stats do what and what they mean by either going to your character screen > stats tab.  Or by going to the Help menu (ESC) then going to the Glossary and learning the stats that way. Both ways are pretty beneficial to understanding how the stats work and how you can prioritize them based on your build you want to use.
marvelheroes,3b7sl3,mordahl,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:54:14 2015 UTC,"Well some folks have already done better analysis of the stats and numbers behind the game mechanics than I'm likely to, so I'm looking for some insight specifically into Mr. Fantastic's uniques and whether it's worth it, for example, to lose 700 health to get much better +power bonuses, etc. without reinventing the wheel for myself.  I think for Reed he can be a bit squishy so I need ""enough"" health and defense to survive but no point in trying to max it out as he's never going to be a tank. :)"

marvelheroes,3b2qnk,avatarofshadow,8,Thu Jun 25 14:26:02 2015 UTC,"When you gain XP, there's a second bar behind the green one.  It's blue.  If you click on it, it will show you how close you are to an omega point.  Each time you earn an omega, it adds up for all your characters, not just one.  Then, when any of your characters hits level 30, you can open up the omega points tab, and activate hundreds of tiny buffs, customizing your character even further.  There are a TON of them.  The higher your level, the faster you get omegas.  The best way to farm them is to hit 60, and then do the LQs because you'll get max omega points that way.  It's also a good time to level up your team-up heroes the same way.  If you don't have a team-up, make sure you log in this weekend.  We're getting Iron Man MK II team up for free."

marvelheroes,3b2qnk,iakuai,3,Thu Jun 25 14:27:41 2015 UTC,What would be the best boss to farm omega points?
marvelheroes,3b2qnk,JaksIRL,6,Thu Jun 25 14:54:16 2015 UTC,Taskmaster is generally regarded as the best boss to farm. I also like Doc Ock because I'm trying to loot his unique and his map is usually pretty straightforward to get to him. He also dies faster than Taskmaster.
marvelheroes,3b2qnk,mordahl,6,Thu Jun 25 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"With the respawn point right on him, Doc Ock is also great for squishy/undergeared chars."

marvelheroes,3b2qnk,Lorarius,3,Thu Jun 25 14:45:51 2015 UTC,Brief answer: Odin's Bounty is an extra amount of loot that drops from particular bosses that change every 3 hours. When you log in there will be a message telling you which bosses are active at the time and there will be a new message when it switches. Unless the timer is off.  The other events boost drops in general so basically go where the message says.  For details go here.

marvelheroes,3b2qnk,bigbadVuk,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:01:35 2015 UTC,You dont need to specifically go to lower asgard. As long as youre in SUPERHEROIC difficulty you can open them in the training room and not miss out on xp.
marvelheroes,3b2qnk,Lulizarti,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:05:13 2015 UTC,"You are the one who is wrong, actually. It doesn't matter WHERE in the STORY MODE you are, as long as you are in super heroic mode.  So just going to wherever in story mode on superheroic gives as much xp as going to lower asgard in SH mode.  Training room gives a 0% multiplier, while SH story mode gives 155%, so you're really missing out on opening them in training room.  Look here for the full list of multipliers."

marvelheroes,3b6lga,BlackCherryAardvark,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:51:09 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they changed the story mode thing while a go.
marvelheroes,3b6lga,WrathGhost,4,Fri Jun 26 12:32:59 2015 UTC,No.. they didnt. It's been known for the past few Big 10's and Odin Bounty events in the past year. They still havent fixed it. The only thing they did was fix that the bonus xp from opening in Superheroic is normalized across the entire story mode -- not just chapter 9.
marvelheroes,3b6lga,dkphxcyke,3,Fri Jun 26 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"Last I knew, Odin Bounty boxes were the one exception.  They somehow missed them when they made a sweep through and made boxes immune to the zone-based XP modifiers.  That said, this was many, many, months ago, so it's hard to know if that is still the case.    Eazy enough to test, though.  Open two OB boxes, one in SH story mode, one... somewhere else, with no other changes in XP boosting.  See if they are different or not."
marvelheroes,3b6lga,TexasAndroid,-1,Fri Jun 26 15:04:55 2015 UTC,Boxes have a base exp value now and only external sources like boosts increase the base value not the location they are opened in :)
marvelheroes,3b6lga,khrucible,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:54:25 2015 UTC,Unfortunately you're wrong when it comes to Odin boxes. This is simply proved by opening one anywhere in super heroic difficulty and then anywhere in normal difficulty. The xp values of the orbs WILL differ.   Let's not spread incorrect information.

Works for all achievements as far as I'm aware. It will update to the correct value even if you did not have it open for the previous updates (so for example if I'm at 300 kills, then kill 10 more and open the window, it will still say 300. If I leave the window open and kill one more it will update to say 311)  It's almost impossible to play with the window open (it's somewhat manageable as a summoner), so I just do it occasionally to check my progress."

I do agree that the movie costumes sometimes stand out a lot, though. I think they should focus less on making them look realistic and just try to recreate the costume as if it were animated or from a comic. You know, it's still the movie costume, but it doesn't have to look ultra realistic.   EDIT: Eric O'Grady's Ant-Man would make for a nice costume too."

I stopped after Doom because I got the splinters and I knew the story was a waste.  Edit: But I do have Odin's Palace unlocked. I just had someone who was there invite me to a party and a portal opened up.
marvelheroes,3b6ycy,CraftyStraw,3,Fri Jun 26 15:51:08 2015 UTC,"story is rather easy if you are a little leveled, and because you can already get a legendary i assume you have a level 60 char? just change your difficulty to green and the story is super easy. just follow the main missions and skip the rest"

marvelheroes,3b6ycy,avatarofshadow,2,Fri Jun 26 14:36:59 2015 UTC,If you just did the story once you wouldn't have this issue as all portals are perma unlocked once activated. Why would you start a game and ignore the story? Missing out on boosts/HP/Spirit/Power Points. I could see skipping this to power level when you have a full roster but to skip it without even doing it once is mind boggling.

marvelheroes,3b3423,bundto,2,Thu Jun 25 17:30:14 2015 UTC,"https://marvelheroes.com/news/news-articles/odins-bounty-big-ten  Just like before, Odin's Bounty features an amazing bonus loot game mode rotation. However, instead of bosses having boosted loot, they will now drop Chests of Odin's Bounty. These chests are loot boxes that you can collect and then open later for an epic lootsplosion! Chests of Odin's Bounty have a high chance to contain Runes and Odin Marks, as well as a chance to drop the Mysterious Crimson Box, which contains rare boss-specific artifacts. Odin's Bounty Boosts are back as well and now include an increased jackpot chance!  During the applicable rotation phase, bosses will drop Odin's Bounty Chests depending on difficulty & location:  Green Bosses - 1 Chest  Red Bosses - 2 Chests  Cosmic Bosses - 3 Chests (2 from the boss & 1 from the completion chest)  Additionally, everyone has a rare chance to receive Odin's Blessing, which gives your chests special jackpot loot! Odin's Bounty Potions have been known to increase your chances of receiving Odin's Blessing."
marvelheroes,3b3423,Sarethus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:10:52 2015 UTC,Are these chests in addition to the normal bounty chests for killing a certain amount of enemies in cosmic terms or instead of them?

With double cosmic loot due to the Cosmic even,  does that mean we'll be getting 4 odin chests per cosmic boss and 2 per bounty?"

marvelheroes,3b3423,Duelgar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:09:44 2015 UTC,"Terminals are affected a bit differently than Patrols.  Patrol bosses drop 1 box (odin, cosmic, midtown) per boss. so you can essentially get up to 18 boxes per Sinister wave, 15 per Brotherhood, so on and so forth. But you only get 1 box of each per boss, not double or triple like you would in terminals.  Youll get 2 (or 3 i cant remember) Odin chests and 2-4 Cosmic Chaos chests per Cosmic Terminal boss."

marvelheroes,3b2881,Userlicious,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:23:36 2015 UTC,"More like skewed ideas (old dummy I mean). Hulk has a 17s ttk on old dummy which translated to new dummy equals (17s x 10) 170s or 2 mins 50s.  His actual so far recorded new dummy ttk is 6mins 15 seconds.

marvelheroes,3b2881,and29,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:10:08 2015 UTC,"I want to submit mine for Juggernaut, but honestly I can't be assed to just yet. I've already been asked by Subpeona though, and I suppose I'll try to get it done sometime either tonight or tomorrow without a team-up. Wasp is a decent part of his damage, but with the TU revision I think it's only fair I show what he's capable of on his own. It won't be pretty though, best I could manage from 4-5 tries was 5:39, usually ends up around 6:00, so with 800 less DR I'd estimate around 6:15-ish.  The thing is, when I get home from work, I don't really want to record myself pounding on a dummy for 6 minutes straight, right now I'd rather play some of the stuff I got on the steam sale.  Edit: I uploaded one. Leave me alone now please. :("
marvelheroes,3b2881,KamahlFoK,2,Thu Jun 25 12:18:38 2015 UTC,"Don't be lazy now, we need the infos bro. I'll love you forever huggernaut."
marvelheroes,3b2881,Userlicious,6,Thu Jun 25 12:23:10 2015 UTC,"Please don't call it lazy! It's just a mixture of exhausting / frustrating. Smashing the same target for 30 to 45 minutes to get a good range of videos, one slip-up can cost your run (and while I don't have many problems with slip-ups anymore, Juggernaut is incredibly screw-up prone!). I just... bluh. I might do it just to fill in the gap for now, and hope someone beats my time by a chunky margin so I can improve. Alternately, show off how Juggernaut isn't quite up to snuff compared to all these other heroes getting pretty good times without team-ups."
marvelheroes,3b2881,KamahlFoK,4,Thu Jun 25 12:28:23 2015 UTC,"Human error is part of the game.  Your TTK attempts don't have to be perfect, as long as they are close.  The idea is to understand what each hero is capable of in a static situation so they can be compared to each other.  All players will have minor errors in a 4-8 minute fight.  It is interesting to find out that your TTK is coming in around 6:00, though.  Most melee heroes are struggling to get below 6:00, especially the ones we consider tougher.  Ranged and pet builds are coming in around 4:00.    I think the huge disparity between melee and ranged DPS as well as survivability will be rearing its ugly head, the more Subpoena's DPS thread gets filled in.  There is absolutely no reason for Venom, Juggernaut, and other melee heroes to be coming in at 2/3rds the DPS of ranged heroes when they have to play the ""avoid the red circle"" game on bosses more than ranged/summoner builds."
marvelheroes,3b2881,zylli42,3,Thu Jun 25 13:11:32 2015 UTC,"Human error is part of the game.    That's fair. It's just Juggs' rotation is... weird to explain. It's somewhat visible in the 22s TTK vid I posted in one of the guide threads (I was just getting sick and tired of people using the short-term TTK's as a testament that their build is the best, so as they say, ""Put up or shut up"", his brutal farming got 22s whereas mine with much less brutal'ing acquired the same time). If I fail to snapshot Juggernaut's signature at the end of his Scion of Cyttorak buff, or botch my timing and lose my Lariat stacks, it's a bit of a hit. Compare this to other characters who, as you said (or implied, I apologize for putting words in your mouth), stand there and go through rotations, it's... unforgiving and frustrating."
marvelheroes,3b2881,KamahlFoK,2,Thu Jun 25 13:40:26 2015 UTC,"As a guy who has submitted ttk times just to fill out the list a bit, I 100% agree with zylli. My Moon Knight ttk has a bunch of errors (I'll probably improve it sometime soonish) and was a first try. I'd rather get the list filled out with some decent ttks so we can have some knowledge (if flawed no matter what) of where the roster stacks up ttk-wise.  Even my She-Hulk ttk (the character I've worked on the most) has some mistakes.  I don't blame not wanting to record because it's tedious, even doing one attempt is pretty boring."
marvelheroes,3b2881,mikwuyma,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"I used to hate TTKs from the old raid dummy because it allowed tons of unrealistic rotations/builds and gave tremendously skewed times due to easy brute farming. Lots of times many heroes had zero spirit by the end of the TTK video meaning their rotations/gear selection aren't even feasible in raids.  Now the new high health raid dummy I like a lot more, it's not perfect, but it does give us a better picture. Heroes have to either gear for spirit sustain/use a realistic rotation to go through the whole 3-9 minutes (lol at the ttk variation, gg balance).   Also alot of the slower TTK times on high health on heroes that have fast small dummy ttks, aren't suprising, take for instance venom, his 6:23 time with team up is super slow compared to the rest of the cast released around his time and after, it's also no surprise because they fixed dots stacking through duration, and the fact most venom's 30s ttk video dps relies on his 25s cooldown sig bruting twice within the 30s. (for those unaware, high health dummy has 10x hp of low health so 30s ttk should linearly translate to 300s/5 mins which is clearly not the case for venom)  What is really worrying are the heroes getting great TTK times while being a ""layer"" hero (a hero damage mostly from layers/pets... lots and lots of small hits), like all the summoners and scarlet witch putting up amazing times, because due their nature those high health times might as well be their average times whereas other heros with hard bruting abilities, there is still slight variance even on high health, just not as high variance as it was on low health (and obviously they will put up a video showing favorable times)"

marvelheroes,3b2881,whwwwhw,-4,Sun Jun 28 11:35:05 2015 UTC,"That thread is all kinds of fucked up. Too many TTKs skewed by broken Team-Ups and TU gear, before Gaz nerfed them all. Not to mention the dozens of pages of the ridiculous ""Punisher is too weak"" whining.  The reason why a lot of people don't post high health dummy TTKs is because it's laborious to sit there for 4-9 minutes and beat on a dummy over and over to get the best time possible. Most people farm for bruts and if they don't get it, they throw out the video. It's also discouraging to see your favorite, completely geared out hero post 6-8+ minutes TKK when the OP heroes are easily doing 4-5 minutes (a few even sub-4 minutes)."
marvelheroes,3b2881,C_L_I_C_K,6,Thu Jun 25 16:52:35 2015 UTC,"subpeona threw out all the TTK videos from when TU gear was broken. All submissions on his list was after patch, and to qualify you need to show your buff bar (so no pizza buff).  There is even a category in the thread where it lists TTKs without any TU or their gear, and to qualify you need to show that your team up has zero points in abilities, in away mode, and with no TU gear. This is to demonstrate what the hero can do without team up.  How is that fucked up?"
marvelheroes,3b2881,and29,3,Thu Jun 25 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, if there's still a team-up ttk from when team-ups were glitched, how is bitching about it on reddit instead of telling subpoena going to help? Subpoena is a nice guy and is just trying to get a decent list going.  Also the ttks take so long I doubt most people do more than 5 or 6 attempts before getting bored. Most of the ones I submitted were first try."

marvelheroes,3b2zbe,TheImaginaryPoster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:30:33 2015 UTC,"If you want to stack exp gain percentage you'd have to buy the event boosts. There was a post on the forums that I saw a few days ago that explained it.  https://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/208216/1000-xp-how   XP-Potion: +50% XP boost; 2 hours. Additional potions increase the duration, not the buff.  XP-EnergyBar: +100% XP boost; 1 hour. Additional Bars increase the buff (100/150/180/190/200)  IridiumTrippleBoost: 50% XP boost for 2 (or 4) hours  CosmicPentaRushBoost: +100% XP boost for 4 hours.

marvelheroes,3b4h6g,gertymoon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:30:18 2015 UTC,I used the Gs on boosts during the boost sale.  Nothing too thrilling from the cards.  I did get a couple of skins (storm ultimate costume is the one I remember) and you'll get a bunch of boosts which is nice to have for leveling all your new characters.
marvelheroes,3b4h6g,Oshiba,3,Fri Jun 26 13:43:45 2015 UTC,"If you like the game then do it, the value is amazing.  After a year of playing and spending most g's on pack slots on around 25 of the 43 heroes offered in the bundle I still ended up picking it up last month as it still presented great value for me with all the bonus items that it came with.  If you think you will be playing it for the long term then you'll save."
marvelheroes,3b4h6g,dorn3,3,Thu Jun 25 22:59:16 2015 UTC,If you are going to play this game do it for sure. you will end up spending more money over time and getting less. This package at this price is a must have for anyone with only a few characters. I spent almost the same amount for the new Batman game and it does not even work. This you are getting great product at a great price.
marvelheroes,3b4h6g,exoromeo,3,Fri Jun 26 01:36:21 2015 UTC,The thing about the pack that's so good is it's mostly Heroes + Stash.  Stash is never on sale.  Hero specific stash is way better than it appears at first. 1. You can store insignia that the hero can wear. 2. You can store rings. 3. You can store anything a hero has bound.  That means that once you are rich you can store artifacts there and simply unbind them. 4. Uru become unbound when you put a runeword on them so you can even store them in a character stash tab. 5. Obviously any hero uniques can also go in those tabs.  Honestly the pack makes me very angry.  I've spent a lot on Stash.  It's really a rip off but you have to have it.  The fact that they'll just hand it out like candy in this pack I get no value from was very annoying.
marvelheroes,3b4h6g,scorpious1109,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:55:44 2015 UTC,"Stash is never on sale.   Indeed. At 350 Gs per hero STASH, it'd cost you 15,050 Gs in game to get the 43 STASH slots included in the mega pack. If you translate that to 100 G = $1, then the pack with the heroes, cards, etc is the way better deal."
marvelheroes,3b4h6g,dkphxcyke,2,Fri Jun 26 13:02:51 2015 UTC,"I bought mine when it was on sale at the beginning of the month and every hero was half off except x-men. I already had Vision and Doom, so used my G I got on She-Hulk, Winter Soldier, and some team-ups. Used free ticket for iceman, since he was a bit more expensive.  Also, from my cards I got a Symbiote Spider-ham, Holo-Stash, and Gold Ultron pets.  It's definitely worth it if you have $130 to spare."

marvelheroes,3b562l,boscoist23,4,Fri Jun 26 01:37:49 2015 UTC,"Nothing you listed as ""having"" is a help to farming at all.  The increase chances of getting the item you are looking for is so small as to be completely negligible.  Your best bet is simply to choose a hero with a teleport (Scarlet Witch) then gear/spec her for pure damage output for fast kills.  Using silly items like pot of gold and medallion of the collector will just increase the amount of time you spend on each kill giving you less overall chances at the item you want.  Yes, increasing RiF would increase your chance at uniques and artifacts.  But you need to remember that when a unique or artifact is rolled to drop it then has to roll for the specific one you are looking for.  Overall RiF is a waste.  More kills per hour is always going to be better."
marvelheroes,3b562l,ProfJackAss,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:43:39 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is that it's better to be able to run the terminals quicker than trying to build up your RiF and SiF?  Does this apply to XP and credit farming too?
marvelheroes,3b562l,ProfJackAss,5,Fri Jun 26 01:46:42 2015 UTC,"EXP farming, not so much, especially with boosts.  You still want to be able to kill as fast as possible, but stacking a bit of intellect won't stop you from doing that because it gives you crit and crit damage.  Credit farming though, not so much.  if you want to farm credits the fastest way would be stacking a bit of +credit gear, go to MM, and slaughter everything you can.  Scarlet Witch with maxed out Chaos Warp would be perfect for this."
marvelheroes,3b562l,SupaTrooper,4,Fri Jun 26 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"To expand:   Xp on enemy defeat is worthless, but stacking % xp gain is great especially during events with high server side boosts.  And if you aren't at the point where you get enough uniques to exchange for 500k chests then just stack minimal credit items (mainly slot 4 and slot 5 with high credit gain ~32+ and do what Prof said and wander through midtown killin stuff).  Edit: Another note is that achievements now guarantee boss-specific items after a certain number of kills, so another reason for ""quantity over quality""."
marvelheroes,3b562l,ProfJackAss,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:53:19 2015 UTC,"Xp on enemy defeat is worthless, but stacking % xp gain is great especially during events with high server side boosts.   Yes, lol, totally forgot about exp on kill.   And if you aren't at the point where you get enough uniques to exchange for 500k chests then just stack minimal credit items (mainly slot 4 and slot 5 with high credit gain ~32+ and do what Prof said and wander through midtown killin stuff).   Yep, as soon as you can manage cosmic midtown madness (easy for scarlet witch) you get uniques so fast you can make 500k chests like crazy.  Though don't forget to make both 500k chests and stacks of 50 relics as relics are very important."
marvelheroes,3b562l,Arcath_,2,Fri Jun 26 02:04:43 2015 UTC,This is the Scarlet Witch build you want. At the bottom is the CMM/CICP build. Works Awesome!
marvelheroes,3b562l,Mandroll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:15:35 2015 UTC,"Well what prof said is pretty much correct. There is however a build for rogue with very acceptable TTK for SIF and RIF farming. It's over on the rogue forumS. If you optimize it, you'll get killing times close to geared middle/upper tier heroes. Keep in mind though, that using a BiS gearset for heavy damage is best for farming"
marvelheroes,3b562l,Moogy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:55:34 2015 UTC,"I've found Summoner Doom to be the best farmer for cosmic terminal bosses. For example, I can drop Sinister in ~5 seconds. I think he performs better than SW (who was my main with all BiS items). The biggest factor is fast teleport; but once you get there, you want to facemelt the targets. Doom does this.

marvelheroes,3b09tv,DaKamakazeproject,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"I dunno.  Ballpark it.  I am going conservative with my estimates.   Last omega event I was able to boost up to 5 omegas per tasky run.  Dunno my run time.   Assume 1 minute as another conservative estimate.  You are looking at 800 runs for 4k omega points.  800 minutes/60 = 13.3 hours or so  If your runs are only 45 seconds,  that's 10 hours.   If you can get 6 omegas per run and 1 minute runs,  it's 11.1  If you can get 6 omegas per run and 45 second runs,  it's 8 hours.    So count on 12 hours give or take."

Once you hit 16, you can start the gravy train of unique-for-credits recipes that let you quickly finish off vendor leveling and then start earning credits to use for LQ rerolling, costume and artifact rolls, etc.  Since you can't teleport, you might have a quicker time doing MM legendary quests, too.  Especially with a group, those go fast.  With the Big 10 event now though you should make really quick work of those last 24 levels though anyway.

Same for Loki's.  5% damage is as good as synergies get, and it even applies to your melee attacks on hybrid heroes, as long as you're doing ranged damage in your rotation every second (and AFAIK ranged DOTs ticking will do the trick).  But practically, he's just a really good hero who can handle any content without being too gear- or Omega-dependent and has good tanky summons to keep him alive.  Plus he's horribly easy in a summon-Forb build where you just spam Forb at everything :)  Rocket for the same reason, he's got tanky summons, and he can handle any content pretty easily.  RR is more gear-dependent, though, but he's got more utility in his toolbox than Iceman."

marvelheroes,3b3r0w,dorn3,2,Thu Jun 25 20:17:07 2015 UTC,It really depends on several things.  Spintech is cheap.  Mutation->Frenzy is cheap.  If you have bad Brutal chance then Guilt Suppression is super cheap.  Really though it all boils down to one mostly simple rule.  Get crit/brut chance to 45-50%.  Then pump damage rating and CDR as cheaply as you can.  There's always character specific exceptions so just look at the hero guides for good ideas.
marvelheroes,3b3r0w,dorn3,6,Thu Jun 25 20:38:10 2015 UTC,Spintech. Mutation->Frenzy (really cheap CDR) Few points into fighting (mutation->warpath) Try to get crit/brut chance up around 45-50%. Bunch more in fighting.   Warpath is just too cheap for what it gives.
marvelheroes,3b3r0w,unsettlingideologies,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:34:52 2015 UTC,"Since Warpath is so cheap, is there any particular reason why folks don't max it right after Spintech?"
marvelheroes,3b3r0w,SupaTrooper,3,Thu Jun 25 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"Most nodes increase in cost too rapidly to be effective past a certain level; so in general, it's best not to max nodes out in an order but rather sprinkle points in each... but SPINTECH is so damn cheap and while Warpath is great value per point, you have to invest a larger amount per rank. You shouldn't be maxing Warpath before putting some in reaver program, rorschaach (if you have vulnerability in your rotation or are in raid setting), or whatever damage rating node you need for your hero."

Not only does Ant Man: Larger than Life contain a cool story with Scott Lang, it also reprints Hank Pym's first two appearances in Marvel comics, Tales to Astonish 27 and Tales to Astonish 35. Even without the new story, which I quite liked, it would be worth it to have just for those two old stories tha are full of 1960s Marvel charm.  https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/11666130_1644222975799843_4126418460011140044_n.jpg?oh=f53587e839f365c415778d55e14f6d12&oe=55EE25AF"

marvelheroes,3b0efb,ElectricZee,20,Wed Jun 24 23:29:03 2015 UTC,Toad isn't actually part of the event. Blob summons toad so hes technically not even a boss.  EDIT: Don't think he drops anything when defeated either.

marvelheroes,3b0efb,Alwaysdeadfred,6,Wed Jun 24 23:38:08 2015 UTC,Killing him is a requirement for some achievements though.  Including the meta Defeat the Brotherhood ones.  He has to die before Blob for it to count.

marvelheroes,3b2jmo,mattinva,2,Thu Jun 25 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"Since you are new, I would suggest you use most, if not all, of your time to farm omega points. This seems like one of the best events for that kind of thing, seeing as how there are so many different XP buffs...and the buffs only get better throughout the week. Leveling alts could be done easily during any other event with a decent xp buff. I'm done with omegas, so I'll probably be leveling the last few alts when the Odin event is in all areas outside of terminals, and then when the Odin event is in terminals, I will probably farm cosmic terminals/one shots (the cosmic terminal loot will be buffed anyways because of the cosmic event, so extreme loot there :D ). Going to farm as many boss artifacts as possible and build up a supply to last me through the ages ;)"

marvelheroes,3b2jmo,Xtulu,3,Thu Jun 25 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"Adding to what scorpious said, it's probably best to farm with a group. If you're new, you won't take down terminal bosses nearly as quick solo as you will with a team. This is especially true if you have trouble surviving."

marvelheroes,3b2jmo,emandinga,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:31:19 2015 UTC,"Efficiency doesn't change with cosmic prestige, but sometimes you have to be inefficient to avoid losing your mind.  With Storm's great AOE I spend some time in Holo Sim burning down multiple spawn waves, but most of my time has been LQs and Midtown Madness boxes.  With Cosmic Terms being boosted during the Big 10, rushing Taskmaster and Omega farming will double as the best way to level IMO."

marvelheroes,3b2jmo,Arcades,2,Thu Jun 25 20:34:40 2015 UTC,Here's my situation.  I have ~1500 Omegas and am up to 7 level 60 characters now (though only 4 are halfway decently geared).  I'm going to spend this week pretty much going full Omega Mark/Omega point grinding for as many lvl. 80 Legendaries as I can grind.  (I'm only 200 marks from one now)  I'd love to get enough Cosmic Worldstones and Armor Relics during my grind to get the Cosmic Insignia Upgrade Recipe and a few pieces of the upgrade currency as well as getting an Anti-Reality Grenade so I don't have to keep switching the one I have between Ghost Rider and Cable.
marvelheroes,3b2jmo,Quexana,2,Thu Jun 25 13:56:37 2015 UTC,Unless you are doing axis raids I would hold off on spending so much on level 80 legendaries.  Every character doesn't need one and the 300 ones can be refunded for a full 300 odins.  They are really only for super late game once you've gotten everything else grinded and theres plenty of time for that considering time is the major gate in the game.
marvelheroes,3b2jmo,AnnieIsMyGirl,2,Thu Jun 25 16:18:36 2015 UTC,Probably logging in and out each day until towards the end of the event when the xp bonus is highest. Try to make one full cake before it's over.

Rocket & Ms. Marvel are my two most played and well geared heroes and I use both summoner and gunner builds with rocket. Bit of warning, summoner Rocket has an easy time in any of the Cosmic Terminals or CMM & CICP because nothing ever aggros onto you and if they do, you can drop groot right on them or go invisible with your burrow. Gunner Rocket absolutely has to kill fast enough that aggro won't matter since the mobs die so fast."

It's true, yes, that RR does do a large amount of shooting on top of his pets but from my experience the ally damage you can pick up across those pieces and your artifacts is just too powerful. I could be wrong, as I haven't tried using the items he has in his video however."

marvelheroes,3b18vq,mordahl,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:05:29 2015 UTC,That error means that you're missing one of the ' Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable' packages. It's probably either 2012 or 2013.  You're likely missing either the 32 or 64 bit version of the package. The game is dependent on both.    Open add/remove programs.   It should look like -   Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable (x64)  Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable (x86)  Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable (x64)  Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable (x86)

Try that and see if there are any other errors.  Also have u try talking with customer support, they usually help with such matters."

I thought I had them all and every time I checked there was more. I reinstalled marvel, through steam and client, ran administrator and finally what fixed it was installing Windows 7 SP1, which I thought was already installed.  TL;DR, install Service pack 1 if not already done.  Edit: I really feel Marvel should paste this fix in the forums, I see it from time to time and I don't even think they know the fix."

My Steam install for this game has the 2008, 2010 and the above 2013 versions in a folder named InstallDependencies."
marvelheroes,3b18vq,ProfJackAss,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:14:34 2015 UTC,"You need to manually move the .dll's (all of them, not just the missing one) on 'some builds of windows 7 64 bit' (many pirated versions tbh, some OEM win7 x64 and windows versions installed via USB keychain) as it places them in the non x64 version of the program/games/whereveryouinstalled version (or sometimes not anywhere at all!). Very old problem found across many games. It's a bitch but basically put the .dll's directly into   C:\Program Files (x86)\wheremarvelisorwhatever, could be \games or w/e  as opposed to C:\Program Files\games\wheremarvelisorwhatever  Make sure you are seeing hidden / system files.  On these 'special' or 'oem' versions of win64 running in 32 bit will never work. Updating windows won't solve this either as basically the game is miscommunicating where the system32 64 folders may be so a stop gap is manually placing them in the game directory where the other .dll's exist. Do this even if it appears they are already in that folder and overwrite them, though you should notice one or two copy without saying they already exist at the destination location.  Also note it may not be the one windows reports as missing as dynamic link libraries depend on each other so copying the one it claims is missing doesn't always fix the problem."
marvelheroes,3b18vq,MaxEisenhart,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:47:11 2015 UTC,Are you launching it from the steam client itself when you play via steam or are you launching it from the .exe when playing from steam?  According to what I have read this issue is automatically fixed when you launch it directly out of the steam client.

marvelheroes,3b0hxb,dkphxcyke,3,Thu Jun 25 00:08:40 2015 UTC,Rule of thumb of late is they shoot for a 6 AM PDT patch. It sometimes gets pushed back if there are issues but it is safe to prepare for the patch to be Thursday morning. anything later is bonus.

If a patch was planned as coming on a Monday they could say ""The release window for the patch is monday to friday, so all events and bonuses will be guaranteed to be active until Monday @9"".  The way the escalating bonuses on events like this are awarded assures that the players trying to optimize their time are going to care greatly about when exactly the last day is.  I say this not to complain but to point out they would probably sell a lot more boosts if people were informed enough that they wouldn't use an Odin's blessing right before the patch and get shorted a large portion of their potential xp/loot."

marvelheroes,3azfwe,dorn3,2,Wed Jun 24 19:45:49 2015 UTC,"Just looking at base damage, Invisible Woman's Bouncing Discs do 2,541.25 dps while Cyclops' Ricochet Blast does 2,543 dps, so they're very close!  However, not only does Cyclops get a lot more energy damage and crit rating from passives, he also has a dot applied from all offensive powers.  The biggest kicker is that Cyclops has great single target damage.  Invisible Woman is likely right on par with Cyclops for aoe, but her single target is still in need of help.  I'm not saying Invisible Woman is bad so please don't take it that way.  If you really like Invisible Woman's character or look or simple think she feels better, she's still good.  I'm just pointing out why she wouldn't be my top suggestion."

marvelheroes,3azfwe,rbmaia05,2,Thu Jun 25 01:54:47 2015 UTC,"In general, if I'm playing a character who can be built around ricochet, I build them around ricochet.  Typically, I like to see a ground targeted AOE that I can lay down that will keep ticking as I fire away with the bounce attack that's hitting everyone standing in the AOE.    One caveat - Storm is one of the best at this because she has a ground AOE PLUS a passive AOE damage aura... so if you're not willing to use her because she ""has better options"" then you might be out of luck.  That said:      Invisible Woman, Squirrel Girl, and Rogue can all be built with a ricochet basic and ground AOE's.  Get all four defensive costume affixes for life regen on basic hit and you're looking at massive life regen with basically all of your spirit available in the event that anything wants a bigger attack.    Taskmaster, Hawkeye, Nightcrawler, and Storm can all layer an AOE and then use a bounce move.  If you're willing to accept turrets, Loki and Rocket Raccoon can play very similar to the above.  For Rocket you're layering his plasma grenade and using groot plus turrets in lieu of a traditional bounce. For Loki you're laying down illusions first in place of a ground attack and then using a bounce.    One more non-bounce option that plays like a bouncer - try a shrapnel build with Magneto.  In this build, Meat Grinder is serving as your ground AOE and Waste Not is randomly cutting down targets as you build up debris - you could basically pretend your basic attack was bouncing if you wanted to (though it technically isn't true for the purpose of effects that trigger on basic attacks)."
marvelheroes,3azfwe,GrnArmadillo,2,Wed Jun 24 20:45:56 2015 UTC,Storm is so fun if you gear her up.
marvelheroes,3azfwe,maskedmurader,5,Wed Jun 24 20:42:04 2015 UTC,"Because he mentions Storm himself, noting that it's not really possible to build around chain lightning in a manner that makes it the main attack. In other words, he already wrote Storm off, although I'm not sure I'd agree with that decision."
marvelheroes,3azfwe,alex2217,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"Not actually writing Storm off - I've just heard that Chain Lightning isn't really a skill she tends to use come end-game, since she has better options.  If that's not the case and she does have an end-game CL build, that'd be great!"
marvelheroes,3azfwe,maskedmurader,2,Wed Jun 24 22:50:31 2015 UTC,"It can be an endgame build, just not THE end  game build. A chain lightning build is awesome for CMM and CICP which is a form of endgame. It's just not optimal for raiding."
marvelheroes,3azfwe,AlterYourMind,2,Wed Jun 24 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"CL builds will never be ideal for ""end-game"" (red raids and cosmic terminal farming). Most of the time you will be attacking a single target so all your potential damage goes to waste.   I could see CL being alright in CMM because you get multiple boss spawns right next to each other. In most cases you blow through the trash mobs and the chain skill becomes a lackluster single target ability."
marvelheroes,3azfwe,AlterYourMind,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:00:06 2015 UTC,"Oh - wasn't planning on using a ricochet for single target DPS. Just for mob clearing. Some heroes do it through bubbles (SW), some through PBAoEs (Hulk) - I was just wondering who does it through ricochets/CLs."
marvelheroes,3azfwe,droid327,2,Wed Jun 24 23:02:03 2015 UTC,"When there is only 1 mob left (a boss) then your ricochet becomes a single target skill.A ton of those aoe abilities(ground aoe, damage over time skills) are also damage layers to your single target ability.   By maxing ricochet you are not maxing another skill which would add damage for your skill rotation. I can honestly not think of a single hero where having their ricochet maxed would not decrease their potential dps.  I think the best option would be if Gaz made ricochet skills do more damage if they do not bounce. That might make certain skills in some heroes tree's essentially useless. It is a tough skill type to balance well so that's why i think gaz is keeping them as leveling tools. Sadly the days of Diablo 2 are over my friend."
marvelheroes,3azfwe,Kronnus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:19:31 2015 UTC,"Storm's CL build is perfectly viable, especially if you're talking about ICP and MM, where the bosses come in packs.  CL only really falters in pure single-target situations where there's no bounce.  Its ideal with 2-3 targets where it can stack up multiple times per cast on each target - that's the case in Patrols when you have boss packs.  Each hit does 20% less than the previous one (100% - 80% - 60% etc.), so being able to repeat arcs really adds up the damage.  Storm's especially good since, like others have said, you can layer her many area DOTs and then fill with CL.  Electrocute is better in obligately single target situations (raids, most terminals and one-shots, Ultron mode phase 3/4) but CL is better in pretty much any other situation.  Its mostly just because the Test Dummy is also a single-target situation that bounce attack builds don't get much love.  Rogue is also pretty good...if you build pure energy you can get her Cyclops stolen to be pretty powerful, and it works fantastic with Gambit's stolen since it basically turns Ricochet into an AOE as well as a bounce attack."

marvelheroes,3azfwe,Rhodair,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:13:27 2015 UTC,"None that are really viable. There are a lot of heroes with ricochet like moves, but allof them deal sub par damage and therefore have an alternative build much better on everything."

It's not a lot of yellow gear either, just 2 items to slap 50, turn toggle on, then re-equip uniques. However, with Juggs it turns off and on every time you change zones or die, so if you're doing terminal runs or somesuch it's pointless."
marvelheroes,3aywea,WhatImMike,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:44:01 2015 UTC,Since I main Moon Knight I save Cestus and Spiked Gauntlet since they are my main 2 attacks. I also save my signatures cubes as well.     Honestly I think it just depends on your spec.
marvelheroes,3aywea,Corvus_tenguinus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say a general safe bet would be to hold onto Cubes for Signatures, primary resource spenders, offensive passives, and any abilities you rely heavily on for DPS (like Unthinkable for Doom, or Meat Grinder for Magneto).  As you get closer to having your hero geared out, you'll have a better idea of what you'll hit 50 on just through gear, and will have a better idea which Cubes you'll need in order to shore up powers that are lagging behind.  Personally, I strictly go for offensive passives until I get close to fully geared, then start tailoring to powers that just need 1 or 2 points to hit max rank."
marvelheroes,3aywea,cnostrand,0,Wed Jun 24 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"For me, I just save the cubes of the ability I use most, either that or the signature."
marvelheroes,3aywea,Drag0nthrax,-6,Wed Jun 24 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't really like any of them. Most skills that I want to get to 50, I can do so otherwise. Unless it's a Personal Artifact, via Achievements, I don't really want to put a Starktech into it.  I just feel like they don't do enough. I would rather have visual Starktechs."
marvelheroes,3aywea,avatarofshadow,6,Wed Jun 24 16:50:34 2015 UTC,wow.  Visual Starktechs would be AWESOME !  I'm not the kind of guy who stresses over whether my One-Off is at 47 or 50.  I'm just not.  But some extra visuals would be fun.
marvelheroes,3aywea,smittyphi,4,Wed Jun 24 17:14:13 2015 UTC,"So on all the skills on a 5-6 skill rotation, you can get every one of them up to 50?"

marvelheroes,3aywea,smittyphi,3,Wed Jun 24 17:18:14 2015 UTC,How?  I can get maybe 2 up to 50.

marvelheroes,3aywea,AnnieIsMyGirl,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"Its very character and build specific.  And talking about min/maxing will have most builds sub in a FoT on slot 1 which leaves several characters needing cubes to hit 50 on their primary damage ability.    Cubes also gives the option not to run AMA for plenty of the older characters that have dated uniques. Its not SUPER EASY, but its not incredibly hard either."

marvelheroes,3b2bsd,avatarofshadow,0,Thu Jun 25 13:12:56 2015 UTC,Ten?  Are you counting folks like Mimic and Changeling/Morph?
marvelheroes,3b2bsd,Pokebalzac,-5,Thu Jun 25 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"you mean, like MEMBERS OF THE X-MEN ?  Yes.  I'm counting them.  Are you counting Captain America and Iron Man as a member of the Avengers?"
marvelheroes,3b2bsd,avatarofshadow,0,Thu Jun 25 13:38:55 2015 UTC,No need to be a huge dick about it.  If you think Mimic is on the level of Cap you're delusional.  Polaris (enhanced for Mags at least?) and (playable) Havok would be cool though.  Frankly I'm surprised Morph is even in the game as a cameo.
marvelheroes,3b2bsd,Pokebalzac,-2,Thu Jun 25 13:42:56 2015 UTC,Mimic burning through Cap's head in Exiles was one of the high-points of the series.  You're right about them not being on the same level.  Cap can't polish Mimic's wings.
marvelheroes,3b2bsd,avatarofshadow,2,Thu Jun 25 13:48:50 2015 UTC,"Citing him as one of the original X-Men is pretty disingenuous though given that storyline.  Not sure why you are being such a giant douche when I asked a pretty simply question.  I wikied ""X-Men roster"" and thought a guy who: ""Blackmailed his way to the X-Men's house. He stole their powers, used them against the team, and kidnapped Jean,"" regardless of his later appearances, scarcely counted as an original X-Man.  Changeling died almost immediately in the comic as Morph did in the cartoon.  So not sure why you'd even think these guys would be added in any kind of timely fashion due to being ""in the first 10 X-men""."

marvelheroes,3az0u7,avatarofshadow,3,Wed Jun 24 17:18:45 2015 UTC,"the first affix is a standard buff to the team-up.  It's the same on every piece of gear for that slot, no matter the quality.  It's to encourage you to put something in that slot, even if the gear is green."
marvelheroes,3ayk8y,emandinga,4,Wed Jun 24 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"First thing's first: Green Musp < Red Musp < Green Axis. You won't be going to both greens in one night.  That said, you could easily get carried through Green Musp if you're only barely at 60, and probably get carried through Red Musp if you're a bit geared (Maybe some 66s, but at least fully blessed full level 70 legendary).  Second, post your IGN and if I'm running raids at the time I'll send you an invite."
marvelheroes,3ayk8y,spamman5r,2,Wed Jun 24 15:31:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info with the order of things. IGN is the same as here. Have roughly 43 or so heroes at 60 but a few with Hela blessings on all artifacts and unfortunately only slot 1 at 69 and the rest lvl 60 uniques. Thanks again.
marvelheroes,3ayk8y,CosmonautDrifter,3,Wed Jun 24 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"For your gear, you want to get the rest to 66 first and then to 69.  So, next time you upgrade go in order of slot 5, 2, 3, 4. Then once they are all 69 repeat. Slot 1 and 5 are the first you want to upgrade.  Don't put challenge bonuses or craft raid boss items until you have all your upgrades.  If you're on when my guild does our green I'll try to get you on.  Are you looking for a guild?"
marvelheroes,3ayk8y,jbower4,2,Wed Jun 24 18:29:32 2015 UTC,Killer info. I will update in that order.  I am good with my SG but will take you up on the green raid offer if you are on. Thanks again.

If you rather new just take a look at the videos on YouTube there's pretty of guide for the raid. But don't expect to run green genosha raid, they are the top tier raids you won't get to join unless you are very well geared."
marvelheroes,3ayk8y,bigbadVuk,2,Wed Jun 24 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"Cool. Will look them up. I did a search on youtube and saw a bunch of red raid videos but not green so that is on me.

marvelheroes,3ayk8y,khrucible,2,Wed Jun 24 15:40:28 2015 UTC,There should be any problem for green Musp nowadays normally overkill. Just take a look at the video and you good to go. After 1 to 2 run you can run it perfectly. No worries. If you still got question feel free to msg me.

marvelheroes,3ayk8y,CAJOS,2,Wed Jun 24 16:14:28 2015 UTC,The mechanics for red and green Musp are exactly the same. The only difference is things in green do a lot less damage. You can run a green raid as though you're running red and it'll be great practice.
marvelheroes,3ayk8y,Lulizarti,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:22:29 2015 UTC,"Cool. I know it's noob stuff to ask and my youtube search skills (or lack thereof) have since proven that I am an idiot. There are guides out there. I will have to check and see if they are pretty thorough.    We all start somewhere so once I get the green musp raid under my belt, it is likely what I will stick with. Thanks for the info."

marvelheroes,3ax3j1,TheWiseMountain,7,Wed Jun 24 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"Well I never much cared about Iron Man for most of his existence. He really wasn't a major player in anything I read. Then in 2008...   RDJ recreated the character t and I can't avoid hearing about him. The new generation of fans are so ridiculously overwhelmingly in love with him that they don't think he has limits. I've heard that he's smarter than Reed Richards, I've heard that he could EASILY beat any other member of the Avengers, I've heard that he could easily shoot Spider-Man with auto-targeting, and I've heard that he's the funniest character in Marvel and always has been (yes, someone said that.). Iron fans have taken a character I enjoyed a bit, and turned him into someone I can't stand. Then I enter the game and Iron Man has as many costumes as all my favorite characters combined.  You ever watch pro wrestling? Iron Man is the new John Cena.  No offense to anyone who likes the character both for who he is and who he was. Its just that all of a sudden I'm surrounded by young teenagers who think that a couple inches of titanium can easily stop Galactus."

I just like how much of a dickhead he is and maybe I'm just a sucker for superheroes without any real powers like Batman. Also he has a wide choice of suits, Spiderman has a lot of costumes too and that's just because the character is very popular. With Iron Man his entire power is the suit, so different suits for different situations while with somebody like Captain America, the suit doesn't make the man."

marvelheroes,3awl6u,skywarpgreer,4,Wed Jun 24 03:44:06 2015 UTC,Did any of the other Team Ups that are also heroes in the game get any new attack powers that the actual hero does not do with the 2.0 upgrade?  I have She-Hulk and Wolverine and both are copies of the heroes with nothing new or different added as far as active powers.
marvelheroes,3awl6u,DarknessMuta,-4,Wed Jun 24 04:03:01 2015 UTC,If they are doing this then why arent all the characters available as team-ups?
marvelheroes,3awl6u,skywarpgreer,2,Wed Jun 24 06:35:03 2015 UTC,"Because they do not want to flood the market with so many team ups.  It is not just as easy as take a hero, call him a team up and be done and ready to be sold.  They only release about 10-12 team ups a year and try to pick heroes that are different and may not make the playable roster for a while if ever.    We do know that a Franken Castle Team Up should hit for Halloween this year because he missed the cut last Halloween due to some bugs so they only had Brood Wolverine."
marvelheroes,3awl6u,DarknessMuta,11,Wed Jun 24 08:24:03 2015 UTC,Are you seriously complaining about free stuff?
marvelheroes,3awl6u,SirTeffy,11,Wed Jun 24 03:47:09 2015 UTC,I don't always agree with the devs (or other players) but nothing both amuses me and pisses me off more than players complaining about getting free stuff in a free game.
marvelheroes,3awl6u,HandsUpDontBan,-5,Wed Jun 24 04:14:18 2015 UTC,i was just voicing in regards to the direction they have taken some of the teamups and this one included being only direct copies of the playable character. If they are doing this then why arent all the characters available as team-ups?
marvelheroes,3awl6u,skywarpgreer,2,Wed Jun 24 06:34:00 2015 UTC,"My guess is because not every hero needs to be a team up. It's probably not trivial to do a ""copy and paste"" job and if they did that there would definitely be people complaining that all they did is release all the heroes as team ups for a cash grab."
marvelheroes,3awl6u,HandsUpDontBan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:04:35 2015 UTC,"What about a boss unique that grants the hero it is equipped to be ""occasionally summoned by other heroes on your roster, and cast signature ability.""  Sig probably too strong but would be a neat effect."

However, the tests didn't lie, it was proving to be worthwhile.  This bug fix was ridiculously vindicating."

Im all for fixing bugs, but if any Gaz dev had a 2 brain cells rubbing together they'd have realized that fixing that bug DEMANDED a DPS buff either to the same skill or somewhere else just to not break the char.  but of course, Venom is old news by now, and they already milked its sales for all they were worth, so they better focus on new chars being strong as the biggest motivator behind new char sales (wink doom wink)"
marvelheroes,3axzkm,arcdevil,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:15:21 2015 UTC,I was just commenting on how it made no damn sense from a min/max point of view without taking the bug into account. My feelings on Venom's current state of balance remain unvoiced.
marvelheroes,3axzkm,KamahlFoK,2,Thu Jul 2 13:18:28 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that Doom's medallion was preferred before they fixed Writhing Tendrils because you got extra ticks out of the DoT.  Now, Writhing Tendrils can't double-hit and the extra ticks are not as beneficial to overall DPS as going with a more general medallion for DPS, like Red Skull's.  Fragment of Twilight is probably better for DPS and it has life on hit.  Overseer's mace is still good for DPS.  The Fragment is harder to craft because it requires a Surtur rune whereas the Overseer's mace can be crafted if you have enough commendations.  You might find more information about specific heroes in their hero-specific forums on the official site.  Reddit isn't a bad place to ask, but you're more likely to have better responses from a forum frequented by the players who focus on that hero."

marvelheroes,3axfu0,catherinesadr,7,Wed Jun 24 07:31:38 2015 UTC,You will get that reward for the next time you log in.  It's based on how many times you yourself log into the game rather than keeping up with it.
marvelheroes,3axfu0,SnakePlizkin,-14,Wed Jun 24 07:42:36 2015 UTC,"No.  If it were this simple, you could log off and on repeatedly to get all of the rewards.  ""Log-in"" rewards are given on your first log-in after 12AM Pacific time for the day.  You always get your next day's log-in reward.  You can't skip a day.  If you don't log in for a day, you get the reward the next day you do log in.  Log in every day for the maximum reward.  Also, ""logging"" is what people do to collect wood from a forest.  I was going to post a bad ""logging"" meme but I couldn't find one in 2 minutes of googling."
marvelheroes,3axfu0,zylli42,6,Wed Jun 24 09:33:26 2015 UTC,"There are two separate types of log-in rewards.    The veteran's counter only goes up, so the only thing you lose from the veteran's tab when you don't log in is the chance to get +1. This does sort of add up over time in that you can get free stuff if you have 30 seconds to log into the game every day whether or not you're actually going to play the game, but nothing is taken away from you.    Note that there is often an ADDITIONAL gift for logging in, such as the Avengers gift boxes we got for most of May and the weekend anniversary presents.  These are lost forever if you aren't able to log on while they are available."
marvelheroes,3axfu0,GrnArmadillo,3,Wed Jun 24 07:46:21 2015 UTC,You won't lose anything. You'll get the sxth day reward.

So, even if I can't play, I log in every day long enough to get whatever it is."
marvelheroes,3awpcs,Scruffysama,5,Wed Jun 24 02:49:39 2015 UTC,You'd have to do some math on when octobot controller outweighs similar options. But a well rolled controller is significant better than any other option for slot 5.
marvelheroes,3awpcs,Leram,2,Wed Jun 24 03:15:24 2015 UTC,"Octobot controller is easily the best, but you may have to spend a lot on rerolling it.  Or not very much.  Depends how lucky you are.  I got mine on my 106th kill, and got max Int, +powers, and pretty solid summoned ally rolls on my 5th reroll.  Others have been... less fortunate."
marvelheroes,3awpcs,PessimiStick,3,Wed Jun 24 15:22:46 2015 UTC,The build creator mentions the Octobot Controller is difficult to get a good roll on.  I agree with this.  Almost every stat on the Octobot Controller needs to be a good roll in order to be worth using.  You may end up going through a billion credits trying to get good rolls or you could simply use the portrait and be happy with it.

marvelheroes,3awpcs,Frankthebank22,4,Wed Jun 24 10:39:55 2015 UTC,It might be very good... but it really doesn't come close to the Octobot. That 35% +/- summon dmg is a massive amount.

marvelheroes,3awpcs,Hellknightx,3,Wed Jun 24 12:04:18 2015 UTC,Yeah which adds another 20% summon dmg i believe. Very BiS
marvelheroes,3awbow,morhobin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:50:52 2015 UTC,"Damage rating affects all of your powers.  Damage rating to a specific type only affects that specific type.  Hover your mouse over a power to see the tooltip.  It will say if it is melee, ranged, or area.  The damage portion will say what kind of damage it does.  Usually, critical rating is better than damage rating.  I would use the Taskmaster Guide over the Robot Dispenser, but a lot of that might depend on your overall stats and other artifacts.  It is also useful to know that 1% damage bonus is equivalent to 40 damage rating at level 60.  That 6% damage versus bosses is equivalent to 240 damage rating against bosses, so the Taskmaster Guide technically has 476 damage rating vs bosses.  Bosses are where your DPS matters the most because they have the most health.  Elites generally die fast."
marvelheroes,3awbow,zylli42,3,Wed Jun 24 01:04:00 2015 UTC,"critical rating is better than damage rating   Can you explain this? I've gotten this impression from lots of folks, but I don't understand why. The damage on a crit is a percentage increase on top of your regular damage, so it would seem that an increase in DR would increase both your crit and non-crit damage. What am I missing here?"
marvelheroes,3awbow,unsettlingideologies,2,Wed Jun 24 03:11:14 2015 UTC,"DR is cheap.  You get it from weapons, its a lot more common on skills and gear and synergies and from stats, and you get it through the wazoo in Omegas.  Crit rating is a lot more difficult to stack...so, because your DR is already pretty high anyway, point-for-point you get more DPS out of Crit Rating (which multiplies your already-high base damage) than more DR (which just adds another small increment on top)"
marvelheroes,3awbow,droid327,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:03:26 2015 UTC,"Basically this.  Crit rating is easiest to obtain from gear.  Omegas give plenty of damage bonus, but very little crit rating per point spent."
marvelheroes,3awbow,zylli42,-1,Wed Jun 24 04:24:59 2015 UTC,"Crit is better because while you're increasing your crit and non crit dmg with pure dmg rating, the chance at getting a crit also helps with brutal damage. If you don't get a crit, you can't get a brutal crit.  This isn't true at all values of crit btw, due to diminishing returns there's a point where you would devalue crit rating over dmg rating."
marvelheroes,3awbow,seejay2,2,Wed Jun 24 03:42:59 2015 UTC,It's between 50-55% that crit hit rating starts to hit diminishing returns and 40-45 for Brutal Hit rating.
marvelheroes,3awbow,Evilbeavers,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:37:45 2015 UTC,Aside from the crit rating advice - I have noticed that flat damage rating is usually lower than a specific damage-type rating on gear. It's probably intentional for the types of choices you need to make.

marvelheroes,3aw64c,marvelheroesnoob,8,Wed Jun 24 00:04:02 2015 UTC,"Guardians bundle on steam also comes with the 3 teamups as well.  Both the small bundles and Mega pack will get you cards and hero stash.   Also, while the steam AoU doesn't have Vision and SW, SW is still only like 5 bucks iirc.   MP bundle comes with G's too you can use for costumes.  My suggestion: get the small bundles for now. While playing and having fun with those characters (plenty of good ones included), save up some cash irl over time and still get the mega pack eventually. It will still be a great value even if you have those 8 heroes/stash spaces. Plus, then all your favorite heroes get an ult upg token.   Edit: Another thing I thought of, eventually when you max your Crafter, you can trade in 3 costumes for any random one. If you get small bundles now and the MP later, you'll also get an extra costume for each hero you have already. Since you'll be using movie costumes as well, this will give you enough extras to get about 3-4 random costumes later on."
marvelheroes,3aw64c,scorpious1109,5,Wed Jun 24 00:13:44 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, in the time it takes the OP to level all of the heroes from the small pack, they'll have plenty of ES to spend on some of the heroes that aren't in the pack."
marvelheroes,3aw64c,unsettlingideologies,6,Wed Jun 24 03:13:18 2015 UTC,My wife and I both purchased the Mega Pack III and we have no regrets at all. It's worth the money if you plan on playing the game long-term.
marvelheroes,3aw64c,Moogy,3,Wed Jun 24 01:00:49 2015 UTC,"I would get the MK3 $200 pack, if I know for sure this is a game im going to be  playing for the next few years.

marvelheroes,3aw64c,brendamn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"So here is my view as someone who has invested quite a bit into the game.  I was on the fence about the mega pack at 200 USD, but was so close to biting the bullet for like a month that I bought the AofU pack and multiple heroes.  Then they put the Mega Pack on sale for 135 and it was a no brainer.  The mega pack gets you SO MUCH SHIT compared to the retail price on everything else.  The hero unlocks are seriously irrelevant, it's all the stash room you get that makes it such a great value.  Never do you have to settle for cashing in less than 4-5 uniques for the good relic and gold crafts.  Any hero you own gives you an ultimate upgrade and a default costume which you can throw into the costume grinder for random costumes.  The mega is worth it at 200 but as I understand it goes on sale like twice a year at 135 so take that as you will.   As others have said it lets you explore heroes that you aren't that big a fan of from the comics that are a total blast to play.  Also dpn't worry toooo much about getting the costumes you want, the Rocket movie costume is a necessity, but it is on sale currently and you get 20 bucks worth of Gs with the mega pack.  Sales happen all the time as well for very specific things you may want.  Totally worth it if you plan on dumping a ton of time into this game."
marvelheroes,3aw64c,imtekbistro,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:28:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, looking back at my spending for this game i'd say go ahead anf putndown the cash for the MK bundle. That way you'll be able to spend your splinters on ult upgrades, you'll be able to store all your insignas (ms marvel and luke cage stash can, between those 2 store all insignas). Since this is the anniversary month, most people are expecting another sale so with the MK package youll have some Gs to spend on that and acquire heroes and costumes you want. Finally the mk package will give you access to a lot of synergies to min/max (once you have a few 50s or 60s) as well as the 200% xp synergy in the long run. While allowing youbto acquire Team ups and ult upgrades with splinters"
marvelheroes,3aw64c,Mandroll,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:15:36 2015 UTC,"I bit that bullet after already having 15ish heroes. best deal ever. never have full stash again, few cool costumes. Some team-ups from the fortune cards + a bunch of boosts. You simply can't beat the sheer value of the mega pack."
marvelheroes,3aw64c,wuzzywuz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get the mega pack.  $200 is a lot of money.  I've dropped $40 for 9 heroes & a teamup and that's plenty.  You earn splinters at a reasonable rate in game, and can eventually work your way up to a reasonably sized roster.  You only need 29 heroes for a max synergy xp, so 40+ is overkill.  Also you can target the good synergies if you buy manually rather than focus on their premade packs.  Some really good ""global"" synergies I'd prioritize if I was you would be Wolverine, Cable, Squirrel Girl, Hawkeye.  Crit chance, brute chance, crit dmg, brute dmg, boss damage.  4 synergies that basically everyone recommends for every build.   This way if you lose interest in the game you're only out $30-$40 instead of $200, and you have a really solid synergy base to build on.   Pay close attention this weekend because people are guessing there will be a anniversary close out sale to come with the free iron man teamup."
marvelheroes,3aw64c,iamagamerama,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:33:51 2015 UTC,"At $135, you should buy the Mega Pack. Compared to $80 for the two packs...it's not really that big of a difference.   Also note the Mega Pack comes with 2,000g that you can use to buy the two costumes you want."
marvelheroes,3aw64c,blindai,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:15:29 2015 UTC,How important are synergies to you? With the mega pack you can use the top synergies for all your favorite characters pretty easily.
marvelheroes,3aw64c,itsrumsey,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:19:44 2015 UTC,Too bad you didn't buy it at the beginning of the month. The 200 dollar pack went down to 130 for the anniversary sale.
marvelheroes,3aw64c,avatarofshadow,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:06:16 2015 UTC,"Get the big pack. The most fun I've had playing the game was leveling heroes for the synergy bonuses. It forced me to play 30+ heroes I wouldn't have played otherwise. The mega pack allows you to have that potential to play every toon, get synergies, and get synergy xp bonus. All of which play a huge part of the long-term game."
marvelheroes,3aw64c,EvilAdolf,0,Wed Jun 24 04:10:37 2015 UTC,"Before I give you my advice, let me tell you about me:  I have every single hero and every single team-up in the game, all heroes leveled to 60 at least once, half of them prestiged to 60 again at least one more time.  I play this game primarily as a grinding game, and I love to play different heroes.  I'm going to suggest to you the same thing I suggest to everyone...Just get random boxes for now.  Your chances of getting a hero your already have are low...but the chances you have of getting someone you WANT are also low, but the chances of getting someone NEW in general are high.  I suggest you be open minded, and give heroes you wouldn't normally consider playing a shot.  It can really be an eye opener to play someone you don't typically give a fuck about, and finding out you really like them.  For example, I don't give the remotest shit about Punisher, but I just prestiged him to play him through his new 52 review, and he's fucking awesome, I love him.  One of my favorite heroes now.  The other option would be to save your splinters and buy heroes as you get the splinters, from the list of heroes you want.  You can buy the costumes you want separately, and it would probably be cheaper.  ...or just get whichever pack.  Gaz would appreciate the support, I'm sure, and you'll enjoy having all the stuff."
marvelheroes,3aw64c,MutatedSpleen,0,Wed Jun 24 05:49:43 2015 UTC,only half of them at 60 green?  Filthy casual !
marvelheroes,3aw64c,avatarofshadow,0,Wed Jun 24 17:17:03 2015 UTC,buy the $200 mk3 pack its the best deal
marvelheroes,3aw64c,firydragon,-2,Wed Jun 24 08:38:04 2015 UTC,"I advise against the mega pack.  I went Ultron Pack as a new player and then added things I wanted specifically.    There are things that you can't get without spending real world currency without extreme luck in fortune cards.  I went ahead to purchase extra costumes, team-ups, bamf pet, and even some fortune cards for things I wanted specifically like the cow pet and came in at close to $200 all in with lots of extra general stash tabs.  Once factoring in the 2k splinters I've earned in the last month I only have 1/3 of the heroes unlocked at most, but everyone I want or intend to play with a playstyle I enjoy.    If you want the achievement for leveling everyone to 60, I think there is one, go for it.  Hero attention deficit disorder kicks in so don't say we didn't warn you."

marvelheroes,3auivn,BelGareth,7,Tue Jun 23 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"Dr. Strange has pretty powers, and so does Scarlet Witch. I can always tell if one of those heroes gets to the boss fight before I do."

marvelheroes,3auivn,Naurhir,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:21:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed, also not a fan of SW voice acting.  It is probably because she always says the same 3 lines, and sounds whiney and emo."

marvelheroes,3awcwn,MnB_85,3,Wed Jun 24 01:32:43 2015 UTC,"Man, this level of complaining and bitching is nothing compared to another game I'm into atm (ahem see post) . but relatively , this is the best I have seen nonetheless."
marvelheroes,3awcwn,Mirrors63Edge,2,Wed Jun 24 01:46:12 2015 UTC,"The MH community is very strange, they identify themselves way too much with their heroes. Any type of balancing is almost impossible with this community unless it's all buffs. This is why this game is so imbalanced in the roster with all the power creep and despite their tuning speech, they immediately add even more power creep.  The community honestly leaves something to be desired since the developers listen to them. It's like with every 52 review and new hero release, the devs more likely than not cave in to the screaming insert hero community and throw balance out the window."
marvelheroes,3awcwn,Fangqaz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:44:30 2015 UTC,The majority of the community has no idea what they're talking about when it comes to balance/buffs/nerfs. See: recent Punisher fiasco
marvelheroes,3awcwn,tzeentch_kahless,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"Glad you like it, I find it way better than most as well in game and on the forums.  Unpopular opinion too but I'm glad they ban folks a lot .  It steers the community away from personal attacks and temper tantrums that plague other forums. Rules and terms without teeth are largely ignored.    People do complain a lot, but more out of passion for a character than anything. It takes a long long time for a character to get developer eyes again after the initial release.  Thing was a beta character and just got his first look in almost 2 years.    So when you do see folks up in arms about a change keep in mind they have this time table for change for the better in mind when they get angry."

marvelheroes,3aspw3,Kevinverf,19,Tue Jun 23 07:52:28 2015 UTC,The most surprising thing here is that someone actually plays taskmaster.
marvelheroes,3aspw3,Sensaround,4,Tue Jun 23 08:53:43 2015 UTC,I was grinding him to 60. I'll probably take a break from him for awhile.  I didn't find him... horrible. His damage wasn't bad but he felt clumsy.

marvelheroes,3asmot,weltschmerz79,10,Tue Jun 23 06:20:58 2015 UTC,He then clarifies a few posts down that the quest would be tied to the ARMOR event. So the quest would be monthly...at best.
marvelheroes,3asmot,HandsUpDontBan,0,Tue Jun 23 07:13:25 2015 UTC,Or ARMOR would be weekly like MM...  ETA OR if ARMOR events will last longer than one week?
marvelheroes,3asmot,unsettlingideologies,4,Tue Jun 23 13:05:47 2015 UTC,"The quest is available to be done once per ARMOR event.  The event is still designed to be a rotating event that lasts 1 week, Not like Midtown Monday."
marvelheroes,3asmot,Asros,2,Wed Jun 24 00:26:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, ALL the events should be weekly for a day - minus the exp bonuses - then rotate on a weekly basis to be active all week.

marvelheroes,3asmot,theswerto,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:19:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that would make it ARMOR day rather than an ARMOR event. I s'pose you could be right, but I'd bet that it will remain in the rotation of events and show up once a month or less as it has been."
marvelheroes,3asmot,HandsUpDontBan,3,Wed Jun 24 04:07:30 2015 UTC,Now that's an event worth participating in if you get free ulti upgrade tokens.

marvelheroes,3asmot,Doomgrin75,5,Tue Jun 23 15:27:14 2015 UTC,Ultimate upgrade tokens ONCE A MONTH? I'm starting to suspect that they DON'T want us to upgrade our ultimates at a reasonable pace.
marvelheroes,3asmot,EvenMind,0,Tue Jun 23 15:38:13 2015 UTC,You can also use ES to get tokens. I find it totally reasonable.
marvelheroes,3asmot,ohcrapitschris,11,Tue Jun 23 16:05:40 2015 UTC,200 es isn't reasonable per upgrade considering how many heroes they have.
marvelheroes,3asmot,easypeasy6,2,Tue Jun 23 17:55:52 2015 UTC,"I hear what you are saying, but let me say things. Speaking as somebody with all heroes(most at 60), 7500 omegas, and several completely finished heros(good to perfect gear all BIS), you do run out of things to do in this game.  So although the fun in these games is generally the ""illusion of accomplishing"" things via leveling up/acquiring gear or otherwise advancing your in-game power, you do eventually run out of things to do, and then the illusion breaks and the game is not nearly so fun any more.  If I had a point, it would be something like, be glad you still have to do, and don't try to minimize the amount of time it takes to max out."
marvelheroes,3asmot,Deeviant,-5,Tue Jun 23 22:19:32 2015 UTC,I find it reasonable considering that it is free.
marvelheroes,3asmot,ohcrapitschris,3,Tue Jun 23 18:18:08 2015 UTC,That's a nonsense answer. Time isn't free and most people don't have that kind of time to farm for that many ES for one Ult upgrade.

marvelheroes,3asmot,NarcolepticWiener,0,Tue Jun 23 18:25:13 2015 UTC,Then pay? They have to make their money somehow.
marvelheroes,3asmot,ohcrapitschris,-3,Wed Jun 24 00:34:58 2015 UTC,"Time isn't free   That's correct. For most video games you have to pay anywhere between 20$ and 60$ to spend your time playing them. And, if you're really lucky, you may also have to pay an extra 15$ a month to keep playing the game you just spent 20$ - 60$ on :)"
marvelheroes,3asmot,codeGrit,-1,Tue Jun 23 19:17:48 2015 UTC,Can't argue with that.
marvelheroes,3asmot,easypeasy6,0,Tue Jun 23 19:21:32 2015 UTC,"What's a reasonable pace? This will be an additional way to upgrade ultimates, so if anything it will make it faster than it currently is."

These events are not really much better then any other event that has been going on over the last few months. Seems like they focus more on the sales for potions/cards etc that grab your real $. Cake slices seem like the only thing thats going on. Yes we got a free Hero, Pet and soon a Team-up but aside from that, that's about it."

I should have used the Oxford comma there to point out that he never got a PhD, and he also never went to med school (wherein he would have gotten an MD) - although there are a lot more degrees that bestow the ""doctor"" title, those two are just the most common.

marvelheroes,3aun3z,scubapuppy,9,Tue Jun 23 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"I mean it's entirely subjective as to how much money you want to spend verses how much time you want to wait. There really is no one-fit solution. I would say that when things are on deep discount or buy-one/get-one, buy the things you want with cash. A 50% off sale you're better off buying an expensive character, a BOGO sale you're better off buying a cheaper one and hoping for a more expensive one as the prize.   Splinters never change, so just buy the ones you want, the only gamble there is with random and you said you aren't interested in that anymore.   I definitely would pick up at least one team-up, Groot if nothing else because he's cheap, but I quite like Gamora at the moment and the Guardians are all on sale. Having one Team-up is a big difference, having multiples, that's up to you."
marvelheroes,3aun3z,ohoni,3,Tue Jun 23 17:28:12 2015 UTC,"Unless the hero or team-up is on sale at the moment, most of the time it will be better to get them with Splinters.  If random boxes aren't going to work in your favor for the most part than I'd skip the BOGO sales and wait for a strict percentage off sale (like we just had for the Anniversary, and the Guardians characters are now).  I'd hold off on the team-up for the moment, unless there is one you really want, since we should be getting a free team-up on Thursday (speculation is an Iron Man or War Machine variant, but nothing has been officially announced).  There's also one for logging in for 200 days (Wolverine)."
marvelheroes,3aun3z,CaptainGroot,3,Tue Jun 23 17:25:57 2015 UTC,"Do you care about ranking up your Ultimate power on any heroes?  If yes, only purchase with G's.

If I like a hero that is coming out, and hear that they're are going to be strong via their Test Center feedback, I purchase the hero pack that comes with extra costume, stash, and usually boosts or cards.  I save my splinters for purchasing ultimate upgrade tokens for the heroes I play the most."

marvelheroes,3aun3z,ProtonixChaos,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:56:25 2015 UTC,My rule of thumb is to use Gs on specific heroes when they are on sale and use Splinters to buy random hero boxes until my roster gets full enough I start getting regular repeats.  YMMV of course but just trying to get that value.
marvelheroes,3aun3z,mattinva,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:34:20 2015 UTC,"The best time to buy heroes is when they are either 50% off, or BOGO...or...if you're really lucky, both.

marvelheroes,3aun3z,Wazanator_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for best value and you are really into the game, I would think about getting the Mega Pack MKIII especially when they roll the 30% off sale on it.  I know it's a lot of money to put down for a game but this was a fundamental mistake I made when trying to save money here in there.  I ended up buying heroes with splinters and using Gs for their respective pack slot.  I did this for about 20 or so characters but if I had just grabbed the mega pack from the start that would have been just paying $3 per hero plus tons of extras.   The big issue is when will the sale role around again, they've had it twice so far this year so if you're willing to wait a few months I'm sure it'll roll around again."

If your goal is just have fun, you get about a hero every month if you do the shareds (just from splinters alone).  Team ups are ""splinter expsneive"" the ratio is kind off.  If you spend ANY money, buy a team-up.  They are comparitively cheap for cash."
marvelheroes,3aun3z,Suzina,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:07:04 2015 UTC,"I recommend spending real money to unlock heroes.  Wait for a sale if you can.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is the game is not free for Gazillion to run.  If you're having fun with it and you want it to keep running, your money will help feed the developers and keep the servers on.  The second reason is that splinters are a limited resource.  They are the most reliable way to obtain Ultimate Upgrade tokens as of right now.  If you truly want to max-out a hero, you will want to level up their Ultimate power.  Note:  Some might suggest using Odin's blessings to obtain Ultimate Upgrades, but that is highly dependent on the RNG, whereas splinters drop every few minutes as long as you're killing things."

marvelheroes,3avhbb,mimetic-polyalloy,3,Wed Jun 24 04:01:20 2015 UTC,"Andrew Garfield looked as much of a high schooler as Tatum and Hill did in 21 Jump Street, or Luke Perry on 90210. And I've never seen a superhero or a Spider-Man cry as much as Garfield's did. Crying for his dad, his uncle, for Gwen, my god, stop being so whiny with the CW plot lines.   And if I have to sit through another Uncle Ben dying-origin story for the third time in the span of 15 years or whenever the next Spider-Man is released, I will personally whack Ben myself. Seriously, I can't take any more moral high ground Aunt Mays and will they-won't they Peter love interest stories or yet another Goblin.   Usually when you reboot something, you make changes and not just yank it back like a sad puppy on a leash. Since 2002 it's been 5 movies, like 13 hrs of going in circles."

marvelheroes,3avhbb,Aurunz,7,Tue Jun 23 20:54:04 2015 UTC,"Looking at his imdb, he really hasnt been in much. And nothing similar to an action movie. Mostly drama's and romance stuff. Even then a good portion of his stuff is voice work.  But the thing is... This is totally Marvel's style. Chris Hemsworth is very similar to him. TV soapopera to one very minor role of George Kirk in startrek. You know, James Kirks father that dies in the 1st 5 minutes. some random short films and then boom. Thor.

marvelheroes,3avhbb,Radials,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:15:04 2015 UTC,"That is so not what Spider-man is. That's how he's been written for awhile now but it certainly hasn't always been the case.  Aside from that though, I doubt he was talking about the movies messing up the level of cheeriness. I imagine he was talking about things like Harry being the first green goblin, and Peter being obsessed with his parents."
marvelheroes,3avhbb,cronotose,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:51:26 2015 UTC,Yep.  I keep seeing comments about the movies being too emo and such.  I guess people never read the original Spiderman comics.  Spiderman should have committed suicide a few dozen times in the first 100 books.   LOL

That's all broad speculation you can't confirm. I'd wager if you directly asked the writers if this were the case, they'd tell you no.  Continuing to do something that's ruining your life isn't automatically insane or unhealthy behavior. The key differentiating factor between this and the mental health issues you're referring to is morality. People making decisions on point of morality rather than personal well being is the basis for many of history's greatest figures. People have ruined their lives to end slavery. People have ruined their lives to tell the truth. People have ruined their lives to help the opressed. Prioritizing morality over yourself, especially in the case of helping others, is nearly universally considered a positive and noble thing to do (though people often disagree on what is considered a moral cause obviously).  Peter is Spider-Man because its the right thing to do. Peter is Spider-Man because letting thousands, if not millions of others die over the years so that he can lead a more pleasant life would require a MUCH greater mental problem than the one you ascribe to him."

I kept respeccing and trying out new skills and combinations, but nothing that had an enjoyable mechanic was remotely good in terms of damage.  His illusions seem like they could be a ton of fun, but they just do terrible DPS against groups and single targets.  The rest of his skills are a pain to deal with (do optimal damage when stacking four short term debuffs? No thanks) or boring (the small AOE ice thing is basically your best shot for killing things).  Simply put, he doesn't do anything well in the grind from 1-60, and he does most things sub-par.  He needs some serious attention, in my opinion.  I'll admit I haven't played Wolvie yet."
marvelheroes,3ataao,robomatticus,6,Tue Jun 23 14:17:27 2015 UTC,Wolverine. His synergy is better.

marvelheroes,3ataao,elsofer,2,Tue Jun 23 13:44:03 2015 UTC,Wolverine felt.... squishy.  Which is kind of the opposite of someone with that healing factor should feel.
marvelheroes,3ataao,DurdensWrath,2,Tue Jun 23 14:02:39 2015 UTC,"As noted. Bad on spirit, and feels kinda squishy. I mean, I expect him to stand in the middle of four sentinels and give back without dying once or twice. Yes, I know I can dodge, and move around, and play like Spider-Man. Point is, I don't expect him to. I expect him to take as much damage as the Hulk without being in danger.  And I didn't find him much fun to play after the first 10 levels or so... so don't be seduced by the ""free trial."""
marvelheroes,3ataao,ZmobieMrh,2,Tue Jun 23 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"The problem is, they went with mitigation instead of real defense.

marvelheroes,3ataao,Suddenlyfoxes,2,Tue Jun 23 17:20:00 2015 UTC,Loki was my least favorite hero to level by a wide margin.  Then using him after 60 and realizing frost was the way to go...that was almost as unfun.  YMMV
marvelheroes,3ataao,king_ghidra,2,Tue Jun 23 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, neither of them is great.  Loki has fun abilities, but his damage is so weak that the last 10-15 levels turn into a real slog.  Wolverine can at least hit bosses hard, but he clears slowly thanks to a lack of aoe, and he's much squishier than you'd imagine Wolverine to be.  Both characters badly need a QoL pass.  If you're interested in playing Wolverine, X-23 is basically a better version of the character.  She's got more aoe, hits bosses just as hard, and has a more engaging playstyle, especially in her movement build.  Still a bit squishy, though."
marvelheroes,3ataao,elsofer,2,Tue Jun 23 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"@all Thank you very much for your input. So yesterday I decided for... Loki.  I levelled him up to 20 and so far I am having a blast. I literally plough through the story content without any issue and I would say it is as fast as my previous playthrough with Hulk.  Even though I can already feel that he is a bit more challenging to play and we will see about more difficult content, but so far he is a lot of fun to play and that is what gaming is all about, right?"
marvelheroes,3ataao,Jortsfan,2,Thu Jun 25 07:34:41 2015 UTC,"I just finished green prestiging Loki and though he might be crap in terms of the metagame he is plenty of fun IMHO.  He basically has two viable builds: Frost, which is a short-ranged aoe damage build based around applying chill effects and then spamming a channeled cone attack and your sig.  The damage is decent and probably the best for just plowing through content.  The other is the Mischief tree which is a kind of summon/ranged hybrid.  Your illusions work like other summons in game but are also projected and used up in various ranged and aoe dps abilities.  This is lots of fun to play but the damage is sub-par.  There are lots of hybrid builds that combine aspects of the above and the odd power from Sorcery.  One of his best features is he has a mid-range teleport which is spammable and grants invisibility.  As I said I think he is very fun to play, but he is unquestionably weak and his uniques are total crap.  The latter situation is being reviewed right now and new uniques will be inbound maybe even this week.  That said I think most players agree he needs a total power overhaul, because even people who like Loki generally thing his frost powers make no sense in terms of the character (his ultimate in particular, which transforms him into a frost giant and replaces his skill bar, is hated in every way) and his sorcery tree is massively underpowered and boring.  I have done plenty of Cosmic Terminals with his summoner build, so I can tell you that even in his poor state he can do that kind of content."
marvelheroes,3ataao,dorn3,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:48:33 2015 UTC,"I've leveled both of them, and I prefer Loki. Wolverine seems to have tremendous fury (spirit) issues and I have trouble sustaining any attacks without having to basic him for a bit. And Loki has a mind control power, which I admit is one of my favorites."
marvelheroes,3ataao,Mandroll,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:31:21 2015 UTC,"Wolverine and Loki are both getting item updates in the next week or so. If Wolverine's update goes well I suspect that will go a long way towards bringing him up to current standards. Loki, on the other hand, I think has some mechanical flaws that an item update won't fix. So I expect Wolverine to be in better shape sooner; on the other hand, if you're looking for an underrepresented hero, Wolvie is popular and if the update makes him more playable he'll probably be seen a lot more."
marvelheroes,3ataao,winnacht,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:44:19 2015 UTC,I just got Loki for his 5% cost synergy.  He was truly painful to level.  I actually loved all his powers but god he's weak.  Even powers that were well designed and useful just had no damage.  I expect he'll get buffed very soon again.
marvelheroes,3ataao,satyanjoy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"Back in the day (read last year) I leveled loki with a summoner build and had a blast.

Wolverine I had leveled to 50 way back when for his synergy and I decided to finish the grind last month. It wasn't as bad as people had led me to believe, but it wasn't as great as when I last played him ....before his rework. I can say that I actually had fun with him  and did not feel useless in groups"
marvelheroes,3ataao,shikaka7,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:09:19 2015 UTC,"Wolvie had spirit (fury) issues when I started levelling him. Especially with his AoE abilities that are expensive. He was fun eventually though and I really enjoyed his last 10 levels. His single target damage was good, bosses were easy.  Loki is kinda meh. The illusions look cool, but there is just no damage. He has enough AoE abilities to clear trash, but bosses were a struggle as he doesn't have damage and when he gets hit, it hurts.  I'd say Wolvie was more fun and his synergy is great for everyone (though people say the slowed targets take 5% more damage from Loki is great for everyone also)."

marvelheroes,3ataao,HuggableBear,0,Tue Jun 23 10:44:17 2015 UTC,"Well, in my opinion currently - Wolverine. I love his single target dmg and his style. He does seem a bit squishy in my eyes (i don't have him insanely geared tho, his own uniques (except slot 2 - i've put a gorilla pelt there), ACCOC, HoD, ziggurat, and a danger AI chip with phys dmg i think, and axe of ares legendary, medalion of grim reaper). Playing Loki is kinda lackluster for me at the moment (very squishy, low dmg while leveling). I didn't even bother farming for his uniques tho. Have his slot 1, 2, 3 and 4 from a few midtown boxes. Tho both of them should be getting their unique reviewed this week (or next, not sure) so, both of them might get better. I hope Logan gets some more health and health regen on his uniques to deal with the squishiness (the hero doesn't live up to his Superior regenerative factor (or whatever its called) right now). Plus some more +ranks to some of the skills. Also both of their synergies are really good, so (wolverine's better imho - free brut strike rating and brut dmg rating? hell yeah).  PS: Keep in mind that those are just MY thoughts and MY experience with these characters."
marvelheroes,3aum3x,avatarofmal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's up to you to find out who u like to play the most. Cant be that hard. If you have all that to choose from, narrow it down to one melee and one ranged, then start adding more ""mains"" depending on your amount of BiS artifacts with blessings on them. But yeah I would pick SW to start with cus she pretty much only use hero uniques so takes 15 minutes to gear out. EDIT: Rocket racoon can be played without turrets, and deals an insane amount of damage. Punisher is still very good. Hulk is not as strong as advertised before the new high health dummy, he is basicly a weaker thing. Cap is easy to gear and with your amount of omegas he can breeze through green raid."

marvelheroes,3aqp93,C_L_I_C_K,20,Mon Jun 22 19:01:56 2015 UTC,This was in response to someone who was crying non-stop about Punisher being nerfed too hard by Gaz and challenged people to do an all AXIS raid with all Punishers. This was the challenge thread:  http://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/210498/think-punishers-in-a-good-place-put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is  We dominated AXIS with all Punishers with super fast kill times on all 3 bosses with minimal deaths. Punisher is still OP and in a better state than 4/5 of the current MH roster. He just can't face tank cosmic patrol and AXIS anymore like he used to.
marvelheroes,3aqp93,dorn3,10,Mon Jun 22 19:03:46 2015 UTC,This was in response to someone who was crying non-stop about Punisher being nerfed too hard by Gaz   The worst part was he was convincing noobs that Punisher was really bad.  Just constantly dragging other threads off topic all over.

Aren't we better than that?  Is Punisher good, yes.  Is he top 10, sure.  Is he OP, no.  That is reserved for Doom and SW."
marvelheroes,3aqp93,DurdensWrath,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"First off, I never claimed to be a better person than anyone. Second, I never spammed the forums or reddit about how my favorite hero or main got nerfed and that he can't do AXIS anymore. Third, Punisher is still OP. He's just not at Doom or SW's level of OPness. If he had a spammable teleport, he would be. But he has unlimited running and rolling that doesn't cost spirit / ammo like most of the MH roster's movement abilities."
marvelheroes,3aqp93,DurdensWrath,-11,Mon Jun 22 19:21:42 2015 UTC,Wasn't saying you claimed to be.  Just more of a question as to why can't we be bigger people than that?
marvelheroes,3aqp93,CK1N,4,Mon Jun 22 19:38:58 2015 UTC,"I am being a ""bigger people"" by telling the truth and telling it like how it is. That dude was crying so hard on the forums, spamming every thread he could about how Punisher got super nerfed and was low tier. Did you want me to sugar coat it and say ""this was a response to a few Punishers' complaints about his nerfs?"" Would that make you feel better and make me a ""bigger people?"" How big do you want me to be about this?   He stopped posting on the forums 3 days ago because he was making himself look stupid and all of the other Punisher mains who complained with him look stupid as well. It's sad that certain players feel entitled to playing a clearly broken, overpowered hero, then cry when Gaz decides it's about time to take them down a notch. Yes, SW and Doom are clearly broken as well. But that doesn't mean Punisher wasn't OP either and still is now."

Is it possible we can get a bit tighter moderation around here?  you're better off posting this stuff in /r/marvel
marvelheroes,3ast66,TRenegade,3,Tue Jun 23 05:46:19 2015 UTC,"You can exchange duplicate uniques for this as the crafter levels:  Level 17: 3 same uniques = chest of 50k credits  Level 18: 4 same uniques = chest of 200k credits  Level 19: 5 same uniques = chest of 500k credits  I might be lying and those might get unlocked at level 16, 17 and 18 actually, not totally sure atm. Then you can also exchange 2/3/4 of the same uniques for stacks of 10/20/50 relics (random). And also for runes, but don't do that, so pretend like you don't know about that.  No point in leveling gear/weapon, except that if you refresh them enough times they might offer you some recipes you can't get elsewhere (but they're nothing amazing, so you can live without them). I leveled them in case they get better some time later, and just to be done with it.  You can ""power level"" all vendors if you donate items worth a lot of money, which you prob don't have too much of atm."

marvelheroes,3ast66,McRantington,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:59:36 2015 UTC,I haven't found much use for credits so far other than re-rolling legendary quests and for costume affixes.  What else are credits used for?  I have close to two million should I be using these on something?
marvelheroes,3ast66,McRantington,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:03:00 2015 UTC,You can also use credits to reroll artifacts and even uniques. Got a crappy Gem of the Kurse? spend 5 million on bad rolls trying to get a good one!
marvelheroes,3ast66,bigbadVuk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:43:47 2015 UTC,"you can reroll artifacts at level 18 crafter I think. cost is 1 unstable molecule, 1 refined astral essence, 1 Hood medallion, and 240k credits. it's called ""Reset an Artifact's variable numbers"" I think you get to reroll uniqes at level 19."
marvelheroes,3ast66,bigbadVuk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:34:07 2015 UTC,"At the crafter. It's under misc for artifacts (it's called something like reset an artifacts random numbers), and uniques might be there as well.. or under gear.  The Crafter needs to be a certain level for these options, can't remember what level though."
marvelheroes,3ast66,jbower4,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:55:42 2015 UTC,"You definitely wanna save up for re-rolling artifacts (200k per re-roll), upgrade rare any hero uniques (600k) to level 60 if you find them before level 60 and re-rolling rare uniques with bad rolls (..umm 350k  (?) per re-roll).  Then if you like to get 1 or 10 heroes to be ""the best they can be"", you wanna roll 300+/700+/1100+/1600+ in crit damage rating on grade 1/2/3/4 affixes on their costume (Has taken me all from 100k to 3.5mil credits to get these or better rolls depending on my luck).  Tbh, I saved up about 110 credit chests of 500k before really needing to use them. Then I started rolling artifacts and rolling uniques and leveling a lot of heroes (re-rolling LQs to terminal only) AND rolling good costume affixes. Took me from 110 to 82 chests, and that's in a months period, while still getting new chests. So I've prob spent more like 40 or so in a month.  Better to have and not need, than to need and not have. You can stack like.. 100 is it? on one slot, and 100 will get you far, so why not use that one space on them."
marvelheroes,3ast66,tarrach,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:03:49 2015 UTC,If you get crafter leveled first you can turn uniques into credit chests 1 500k chest gets enchanter from 1 to 17. You can also turn uniques into relics once your enchanter and crafter are 20.

marvelheroes,3ast66,PraxusGaming,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:11:31 2015 UTC,what about after level 14/15 for your crafter/enchanter.  Is there anyway to level them from 14-15 quickly?  Or do I just need to put my big boy pants on and suck it up and donate stuff?
marvelheroes,3ast66,McRantington,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:07:38 2015 UTC,"You just have to donate everything. I pretty much did purples and up to get my crafter to 20. Once you unlock the credit chest recipe though, you could stop and just use unique...  ...But uniques can be exchanged for relics and to feed your pet to get a +3 to your main stat, so it will possibly take you a while until you can divert them back to credit chests."
marvelheroes,3ast66,DurdensWrath,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:01:39 2015 UTC,"I personally save all my ""any hero"" uniques in a tab and trade them in for Relics. Once I have a stack of 1000.

marvelheroes,3ast66,McRantington,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:53:28 2015 UTC,Any suggestions as far as what to do when you have all the relics you need and more than 50 500k credit chests?

marvelheroes,3ast66,DurdensWrath,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:09:45 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I guess I can diversify my pets a bit. But with Bov going right now and the supposed big event coming, I can see me running into the same problem shortly."
marvelheroes,3ast66,McRantington,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:15:34 2015 UTC,"No doubt.  Do you have stacks of 1k of relics?  That's what I've been doing.  Basically all my All Heroes go into the exchange, individual heroes go into the pet, unless I get a stack of uniques, and then I blender those too.  I wish Bov dropped like this ALL the time.  I love going to Bovenheim."
marvelheroes,3ast66,DurdensWrath,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:35:10 2015 UTC,Pets are very foreign to me in this game.  I got the potted groot from the free pet last week.  My friends told me basically give the pet all my rares/epics/cosmics i don't need but is there a fast way of doing it?  Like when pressing Vacuum is there another button you can press to make your pet vacuum?
marvelheroes,3ast66,Uniqron,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:44:41 2015 UTC,"There's a setting in game options, where you can make it auto vacuum things.  I basically have it set to vaccum everything from white to purple, leaving cosmics for me to pick up.  It's a slider for slot 1 to slot 5.  So if you need a purple for slot 5, you can move the slider.  Or if you're leveling a character, you can turn the sliders off."
marvelheroes,3askae,SazhAttack,6,Tue Jun 23 04:11:35 2015 UTC,"Every Gok in the game is 51. Theres no way to upgrade it, it has a set level. Same with every other artifact."

marvelheroes,3aq3hl,GreenDale7,8,Mon Jun 22 16:19:06 2015 UTC,"From what I've learned from playing MH, most items don't really matter until endgame because you'll be outleveling them faster than they can really make a difference.   However, for me personally, there are, as a rule a few features on items that stand out that will maximize your damage and defense considerably.   Item quality: unique>cosmic>purple>blue Always go for higher base numbers on offensive and defense items When looking at offensive item try to find ones that have a + to the type of damage your dealing constantly. (For example; for Punisher who deals out physical damage, an item with 300 base damage isn't as good as an item with 275 base damage that has +100 to physical damage rating Same principle applies to defensive items as it does to offensive items, i.e. an item with 300 base defense isn't as good as an item with 275 base defense that has +100 to defense rating   Other than that, yes you should donating everything that you aren't saving to the crafter until he hits level 20, then donate everything to the enchanter"
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,BorachoBean,4,Mon Jun 22 16:41:59 2015 UTC,I think sometimes I was getting bogged down in comparing the +X for certain skills rather than the actual att/def stats.    My crafter level is around 6 so I've a fair bit to go yet.
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,BorachoBean,2,Mon Jun 22 18:11:24 2015 UTC,"The thing is you're constantly replacing gear as you level, so those are really the only stats I look for in gear. Any +X to skills are just bonuses to me."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,unsettlingideologies,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"I was given the opposite advice at some point--at least for gearing for endgame with someone who's at 60. Focus on the +X to the skills you use in your build and try to max those first because the difference in damage tends to scale better on those than on other stats. Once you've maxed (or near maxed) those, focus on replacing with ones that have the same +X but better stats until you finally end up with something that you are satisfied with.  I just remembered this whole conversation is specifically about leveling, so my original comment doesn't fully apply. Although, while leveling I still find it easier to focus primarily on +X to skills I use rather than worrying about which stats matter most in relation to each other."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,kernco,8,Mon Jun 22 23:00:53 2015 UTC,"When leveling, I just equip the highest item level and don't worry about it. Sure, I probably sometimes replace a lower item level with better affixes, but they'll all be obsolete soon anyway.  I tended to just pick up the purples and costume cores for donating. Once you get the crafter up to the level required for credit chests, you're going to be doing most of your donating with those."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,kernco,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"That seems to make sense, especially as I seem to outlevel items fairly quickly. So would you just ""vacuum"" anything lower than a purple item?"
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,Raptor2114,2,Mon Jun 22 18:03:03 2015 UTC,"That's probably what I'd do. I finished leveling my vendors before vacuuming was a thing. What I do now when I'm leveling a new character is set the auto-vaporize to the tier below what I currently have equipped in that slot. So once I get a purple in a slot, I'm only interested in better purples, cosmics or uniques. If I get a cosmic in a slot, I start auto-vaporizing purples, but I guess if you're still leveling your vendors then you'd want to pick those up."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,Andromansis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:13:03 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good plan, I guess if I vaporize/vacuum anything blue or below and pick up all purples for levelling my crafter (or upgrading) I'll be fine."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,Dougdoesnt,2,Mon Jun 22 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"Yup...I spent way too much time crafting and upgrading to try to get the perfect leveling items on my first playthrough.  Time would have definitely been better spent just killing stuff and equipping whatever purples, cosmics, or uniques that drop."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,elsofer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:13:25 2015 UTC,I guess it makes sense at max level but too time consuming to be efficient when levelling.
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,kiyouri,2,Mon Jun 22 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, and then after 30-35 tune it up to vaporize anything lower than cosmics."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,kiyouri,2,Mon Jun 22 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I level heroes. Equip the highest ilvl you find for each slot and vacuum everything under purple. Around hero lvl 45 I start vacuuming purples for slot 2-5 so I only see slot 1 purples. Once you hit 60, start aiming to replace every slot with a unique specific to your hero (not all heroes gear this way at 60, I am told)."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,riidiii,9,Mon Jun 22 19:08:25 2015 UTC,"I would buy another STASH to keep stuff in. Oh, you'll find that two are not NEARLY enough... but it'll give you an idea for starters.  This site will give you a great idea of what to keep or what to sell regarding artifacts, uniques, and medal(lion)s.

You don't have to do it for every item, but just upgrade every 5-10 levels or so. Everything else you can just bring to your crafter to donate, using alt + left click over the item."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,bundto,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:37:30 2015 UTC,That's sort of what I've been doing but it sounds like I don't need to be doing it so often. Presumably if I don't find a cosmic item and I end up say 10 levels above that item it might be worth putting in a purple?
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,brouski,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"A purple could be worth it if you are 10 levels above your cosmic, but usually the cosmic on hit effect gives your a lot more than what a purple can get you.   I personally would not equip a purple unless it gave me a combination of 3 of the following: hp, spirit, +4 to a skill you are leveling, -cost reduction on a spender, +1 to a skill tree.  You will out level your gear pretty fast especially in the earlier levels, so you dont have to spend too much time looking at the gear."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,bundto,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:20:59 2015 UTC,"I've got the advantage of playing for a while, having plenty of synergies and whatnot, but a couple of times recently I hit level 60 still wearing a level 1 vendor item in one of my slots because no cosmic/unique dropped (or I just gave it to my pet without even checking!).  If you're not having troubles with dying or being spirit starved I wouldn't worry too much about missing an occasional purple upgrade."
marvelheroes,3aq3hl,Quidfacis_,3,Mon Jun 22 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"How to deal with loot while leveling:   Options -> Gameplay -> Autoloot Set all Vaporize options to 'epic', Equip a pet   Equip higher level 'yellow' gear when it drops.

marvelheroes,3ar803,Enkaem,10,Mon Jun 22 21:20:28 2015 UTC,"Hey, welcome to the game! I was in a similar position to you, only I decided to pick up someone more traditionally viable at the start rather than going with Star Lord, whom I wanted to play. I ended up getting him in my next 'Random Hero Unlock' and I mained him near instantly over my old top tier character Venom.  Peter's issues right now lie in how squishy he is as a character. There's no particular roles within Marvel Heroes quite like there are in other games that contain raids. Each character in Marvel Heroes' end game is expected to both take and deal damage, especially within raids at the end game. Star Lord has absolutely no issue with dealing damage at all, especially if you run some of his highest simming builds. The problem is the amount you need to sacrifice for survivability compared to how little other characters may need to sacrifice given the same scenario, maybe one defensive item would be enough for them, but we'd be better off with two for example. But, as of right now, and especially after his recent QoL updates to his items, you can do absolutely everything with Star Lord at the end game, including the most difficult raid; you just need to put in a little more ""umph"" than some of the higher tier picks.  Sorry if this is messy and confusing to read at all! It's already fairly late here but I didn't want to leave you hanging. :)"
marvelheroes,3ar803,_Nytol,4,Mon Jun 22 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"That was explained well, and I didn't know he had a qol update. I might pick him up later tonight after reading this."
marvelheroes,3ar803,Shermer_Punt,2,Mon Jun 22 21:42:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm in love with him, especially after the tweaks to his elemental tree due to nobody wanting to touch it and the recent touch ups to his items.  Once you're used to the somewhat squishiness he is unbelievably fun to play imo. I feel rewarded when I land my skillshots and I feel punished when I whiff them. He feels like a character that really rewards good positioning, especially with my current hybrid spec. It feels very refreshing after playing some top tiers who sort of blitz through things without too much thought needed.  Not to mention it's now viable to dip into his elemental tree and add as much depth as you feel comfortable with, as that tree is as crazy as you want it to be.  I hope you find him fun, he needs more people both playing and enjoying him after the changes made."
marvelheroes,3ar803,_Nytol,3,Mon Jun 22 21:55:03 2015 UTC,I just powered him to 60 over the weekend and he's great fun. Dash in and out of fights. And once those combos land the big numbers fly.
marvelheroes,3ar803,WhatImMike,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:02:59 2015 UTC,"I get really annoyed by his starship power rotation though. When fighting a boss you use up all your starship powers, refresh them and do it again. Makes you stand still for like 6 seconds and really takes away some of his mobile positioning feel.   And it seems that this is pretty much his core as there are no builds without starship tree so you are stuck with it (deals incredible damage though)"
marvelheroes,3ar803,Heimdahl,2,Tue Jun 23 04:48:02 2015 UTC,Hey Nytol! Thanks so much for your response man. That was really in depth and gave me a great idea of what I'm about to get into. I'll try not to get too frustrated with the squishiness. I'm actually quite excited to learn a character who will take a bit of paying attention. Thanks for taking the time to fill me!
marvelheroes,3ar803,AtomicCandy,2,Tue Jun 23 00:40:52 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I just picked him up today from a random hero box (it's a box you can buy that unlocks a random hero for your account in exchange for being cheaper than buying a specific hero), so I don't have him anywhere near max level or anything, so I can't tell you about his viability yet. But his abilities are very fun and thematic. And one of the most common answers you'll get from this sub about whether you should pick up a hero is that you should pick up someone you enjoy, either because you like their play style or the character itself. And for a few more days you can try out every hero and get them to level 10, so I'd recommend trying him out first. If you like Star Lord, pick him up, and if you don't, well you can try out any of the other heroes up to level 10 until you find one you really like, or the event ends. Welcome to the game!"
marvelheroes,3ar803,Seleuco1,2,Mon Jun 22 21:42:07 2015 UTC,"I have him at lvl 60 red prestige and planning to go for the cosmic, i avoided entirely the elemental gun tree and play with the classic build cosmic outlaw / starship. Didnt tried him on Axis raid still, but any other content of the game i breeze through without problems. He have the best dash in game and i dont feel he is that squishy, specially now with the team ups taking away some heat. If you like Quill, give him a go."
marvelheroes,3ar803,skywarpgreer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:53:26 2015 UTC,Red prestige for me. Very high dealing damage and fun with the new teamup 2.0 system with drax or gamora or groot. Once you get to level 30 start spending some omegas to help his defense. His critical damage is amazing with the right gear. I play him as elemental gun build and he is very strong.
marvelheroes,3ar803,firydragon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"Wc to the game. First of all id say get starlord, you get the most fun from playing the char you like :). Secondly id suggest you buy the $200 mk3 pack which gives you 43 heroes and a lot of other great stuff at a very good price. This is because the game is addicting and you will spend much more then $200 in 3-4 months so just buy the mk3 pack now and you willl thank me later ;)"

It's pretty easy to move out of the attacks and use an invuln core. I haven't tried a red raid with him, but his DPS was certainly viable for a green and so was his survivability. I actually really enjoyed playing him; he's feels like you're actually playing Star Lord."
marvelheroes,3ar803,QuiGonJinnNJuice,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:27:37 2015 UTC,"As a fairly new player myself, Star Lord was the 3rd character I leveled to 60 and is now my favorite of the few i'm playing.  Would like to echo the sentiments of others talking about his squishiness at times and needing to kite (I've also tried to make ample use of the grenades in some situations to control and space).  I will say though that the kiting/positioning/mobile playstyle is pretty fast paced, engaging, and fun (especially if you already like star lord)  Especially as an early character with limited gear as a new player I found myself spirit starved and a little squishy with the build I used (cosmic outlaw stuff supported by starship).  The rework on his uniques has been helpful for providing some things.  As a new player if you encounter survivability and/or spirit issues i used an uru forged chestpiece (+def rating) with the river of the soul runeword (+spirit on hit) and that managed some of the issues I ran into.  From a new player to another- definitely check out star lord as he's become the character I'm playing most and using to farm other content and the like to support my other heroes"
marvelheroes,3ar803,droid327,-3,Tue Jun 23 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"Well no hero is really ""not viable"" because you can pretty much complete any content with the Zapp Brannigan strategy....just keep throwing yourself at it over and over until you wear it down.  That being said, SL is probably on the bottom of the heap in terms of powerful heroes right now.  If he's not the single worst, he's bottom 5.  The problem is he's extremely squishy, doesn't put out a lot of damage, and has a rather complicated and uncomplimentary skillset that doesn't really work in-game as well as other heroes with more simple dynamics.  He is someone you want to eventually get, though, because his synergy is extremely useful for a lot of heroes.  But I think as your first hero he'd be a bit of a handicap and might give you a bad impression of the game.  Since you can choose anyone now except Doom, I'd suggest choosing someone who's generally held to be among the top tier (Scarlet Witch, Iceman, Cap, Venom, etc.), then you can pick up SL on your second day with your 400 ES gift."

IE if they have a total with boosts of let's say +400% and the server bonus is at 154% (6th day of the current event) they would have 1270% the normal XP which would enable them to level just about anyone in a matter of a few hours at most by doing legendary quests back to back.

marvelheroes,3arcmw,alkanshel,8,Tue Jun 23 20:54:13 2015 UTC,She can increase her density like Vision in the marvel ultimate line I believe. Maybe they'll play that up for the game as well. She also played a key role and changed her powers a bit by the end of The Black Vortex. It'll be interesting to see which way they go with her
marvelheroes,3arcmw,jonpon87,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:00:08 2015 UTC,"They definitely shouldn't give her Ultimate Kitty's heavy density, since that's just so out of whack with her 616 version. I do hope they make a Shroud costume though."
marvelheroes,3arcmw,ohoni,7,Tue Jun 23 11:29:39 2015 UTC,"They could throw all kinds of stuff in like coming out of the floors and tripping people, phasing through people can be bad, as in reaching in and then pulling out an organ while she phases back.   I've always thought she would be an excellent summon/power combo with colossus, but that's another conversation.   I think invisibility is pretty obvious, but I hope they make it work better than NC and Betsy."
marvelheroes,3arcmw,BelGareth,3,Mon Jun 22 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"Silver Surfer is a good start. He ignores most terrain obstructions by default and she should too. She should also have a free travel power that is functionally flight but looks more like Stride. She also needs a teleport equivalent to Surfer's that allows her to walk through walls, but it's true that a pure ""no clipping"" power would just break things.   In terms of combat, she should have some basic martial arts moves, she should also have plenty of moves with built in travel components, where she dashes through the target and back attacks them, drops into the ground and pops up under them with an uppercut, and one where she dashes backwards )phasing through obstacles) as Lockheed attacks.   She should also have moves where she tags and enemy and phases them, dealing damage (double to robots), or drops them into the ground, locking them down. She should also have a team defensive aura, similar to the stealth powers other characters have. And speaking of stealth, she qualifies for that too.   Like with various other characters, she should get a temporary buff each time she uses a ""phasing"" power that gives her a damage buff, based on her using it to catch enemies unawares.   But yes, she should be a tank more than a DPSer, she should have massively high damage absorption, especially to Physical but to the rest as well (because otherwise she would perform too inconsistently to be counted on), and should be one of the hardest characters in the game to put down. Her TTKs should be relatively high, but her TTL should be some of the best in the game. She should even have a channeled option that makes her completely immune to damage, maybe as a part of her phasing travel power (channeled so that you can't combine it with attacks, you have to do one or the other at any given time).   As for Sig, I think Lockheed would actually work best for that, something where she phases into the ground, Lockheed flies over her head and blasts the ground with a big AoE. That would be the best way to do a solid AoE with her, I think. For Ultimate, it probably should be a team summon, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Magik, maybe Star Lord and Ice Man too."

The top heroes are far better and only a few of them are ""tanky melee with decent aoe"". The balance of heroes at different levels of omegas/gear is all over the place.  Who's good changes drastically as you acquire more of both. At one point people were using dodge as infinite regen and being unkillable.  All the defenses got nerfed hard and never really rebalanced.  Dodge is hard to get very high and only cuts half damage.  Deflect is half damage too but at least it's ""cheap"" in the grand scheme of things. You need to start thinking of invuln as the superior defense.  Invuln core, invuln skills,etc.  Learning when to pop them is far better than 5% extra negation.   Still though your question often shows up at a certain time.  I'm guessing you're trying Cosmic terminals and you have to run away so often that it's annoying.  Cap is probably your best bet if that's the case.  He has a 1 point invuln and can run an invuln/400 core.   He's also got block (which is WAY better than deflect/dodge) and a lot of defense/negation/heals.

A geared Cap makes her look like a glass cannon.  The way you could use Venom before just makes either of them seem weak.  I stand by what I said they won't ever make one like Venom again.

Does anything besides damage and defense really matter?  Should i care about crit, brutal, or dodge?  Do I need to diversify my attacks?  Is it important to have at least one area power?  And whats the difference between DoT and AoE?"
marvelheroes,3aodxy,WhatImMike,3,Mon Jun 22 15:01:08 2015 UTC,"What's important when gearing will depend on what you want to do with the hero. Ranged, melee, tank etc builds will all be different, and ideally you'll look for whatever stats and skill bonuses are relevant to each build. These may not be the same for everyone, just because you're building two heroes as ranged doesn't mean that the same stats will work for each. If one does mostly physical damage and the other is doing mental, then having a ton of Energy stat on your stuff isn't going to work as well for the physical hero. Crit, brutal, and dodge also vary in importance based on the hero, and the build. Reading the hero abilities will kind of give you a sense of whether crit or dodge might be more important on this hero. If someone has a skill that benefits from critting a lot and you decide to invest in that skill, then crit rating will be more beneficial to you, for example. So it might take a while, but as you start thinking about this stuff and looking at what type of powers you use most on each hero, you'll start to get a sense of what stats are going to really benefit you. Luckily, the rest of the stuff is a bit more straight forward. If you mean diversifying your attack as in switching the type of damage you do, then most of time sticking to one damage type will be best. This is because focusing on one stat for damage, like Energy for mental damage, will give you a higher value for it than splitting up between say Fighting and Energy. Stat values don't have a soft cap (a point where the advantages they give start to decline), so having 15 Energy and doing just mental damage will be better than having 10 Fighting and 10 Energy and switching between physical and energy damage, assuming the skills are all relatively balanced in strength. There are some characters that have skills or items that encourage switching between several types of damage though, and they may be worth having a mixed build, but focusing on one type is the norm. Having an area power is good, it helps to clear groups of enemies faster, which means you can get more xp and items faster, as well as clear the minions that appear during bosses. You can still focus on having a build that does a ton of damage to one enemy (obviously better for bosses), but getting a spammable area power would be still be useful for the reasons I sad above. And as for AoE and DoT diferences, well DoT is just damage over time, while AoE is area of effect. So AoE abilities are basically just abilities that affect multiple enemies, so area powers. Damage over time abilities are those abilities that say they do damage multiple times per second and list their duration. That's pretty much it. DoT abilities can really help out your DPS because it's constant damage going while you are using your other skills. Just don't spam the same DoT skill as the damage doesn't add up, it only refreshes. So a 100 damage per second DoT lasting 5 seconds won't do 200 per second if you hit it twice, it will just restart the 5 second duration from that point. Note that different skills applying a DoT should add up, so using multiple DoT skills does work.You can also have AoE DoT powers. Hope I helped a bit, I know that a lot of my answers just ended up being ""it depends"", so I'm sorry about that."

marvelheroes,3aodxy,dkphxcyke,2,Mon Jun 22 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"No problem. I did catch a mistake I made though, I didn't mean to put Fighting in my example. Fighting should increase all damage types, in exchange for being slightly less of an increase compared to the stats that boost one type of damage. So I meant to put Strength, which would only raise physical damage. Good luck with Gambit, I don't have him yet but he looks fun!"

marvelheroes,3aodxy,Zurtard,6,Mon Jun 22 07:17:32 2015 UTC,"I can suggest :   Captain : On paper he doesn't look that tanky (only 20% negation, low regen), but he has LOTS of defense, a nice block, very good invulnerability, and he moves a lot so he doesn't take that many hits. He also has very good DPS, good AoE, no spirit problems and is easy to gear. Juggernaut : One of the tankiest hero in the game IMO, big regen, lots of defense and HP, 25% negation, and constantly moving which make it hard to die. I don't know how he does against the BIG dummy, but he was always considered as a good damage hero. (IMO he is a big boring to play) Rogue : with ALL the passives she has access to she can become REALLY REALLY tanky ! I never played her, but from what I heard on the forum if you build her tanky she can become unkillable. No idea about her DPS... Honorable mention : Thor, Iron Man, Thing.   Also, I think you should reconsider Ms.M and MK, even if they have some downside, they are incredibly tanky and have good DPS."

marvelheroes,3aodxy,Userlicious,2,Mon Jun 22 13:15:32 2015 UTC,I have both Cap and Juggs and completely agree.  Cap has no spirit issues at all with an easy rotation and good sustain.  Juggs is tankier than Cap and has a very different play style which I find refreshing but you might hate.  Juggs damage also has huge brutal numbers which is fun to watch.

The recent reviews and unique changes may have made a hero viable or tanky that wasn't before.  Melee heroes are in a bad state right now.  The damage taken for being in melee range and the reduced damage dealt as a result of dodging and/or disengaging to heal up isn't very fair when comparing melees to ranged and pet builds.    If I could find a hero that is tough enough to take all but the red circles of death and still put out a ~5:00 TTK on the dummy, I would be satisfied.  Venom seems to be the only one tanky enough to do that, but his long-term DPS isn't anywhere near average."
marvelheroes,3aodxy,WhatImMike,3,Mon Jun 22 11:00:10 2015 UTC,"Iceman has 15% negation from a regular passive and potentially 20 if you pick his melee stance (prob not worth it). More importantly ice block and his sig both provide multiple seconds of invuln. Add an invuln core and that's 3 on demand invuln buttons, which is massive. If you build him as a melee/summoner hybrid you also get tanky pets to help draw aggro and frost nova is a nice cc. I'd say he's quite tanky in a non-traditional way but admittedly his best ttk builds are not melee."
marvelheroes,3aodxy,theswerto,2,Mon Jun 22 11:20:19 2015 UTC,"Well the reason you're getting downvotes is probably twofold:  1) You sound like you're asking for a totally OP hero that just doesn't exist.  You want top-flight tanking and top-flight DPS, with an easy-to-maintain rotation and AOE as well as high single-target damage.  And you want it in melee, not ranged.  What you keep referring to as ""glaring holes"" is what most of us generally refer to as ""balance"".    2) You're asking for numbers that simply don't exist.  There is no easy, comparative metric for ""tankiness"".  There is no TTL dummy.  All there is is subjective, qualitative accounts of tankiness based on how often people seem to die when they're playing a certain hero.    Based on what you've posted so far, I'm going to join those suggesting Moon Knight.  He's got good tanking ability, puts out decent DPS when geared well, and has some powers to handle trash along with bosses.  If your only complaint is that all his DOTs are on different cooldowns....then just pretend their durations are shorter and refresh them before they expire.  You can handle the miniscule extra Spirit cost with endgame gear, and your TTK wont suffer that much."
marvelheroes,3aodxy,dorn3,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:27:59 2015 UTC,"1) I'm sure there are players who stick to their favorite hero from comics or movies.  There are also players who just want to play the most OP hero in the game.  I'm in the latter category, and I'm not afraid to admit it.  I do understand game balance is a factor, so I just have to find a character that comes closest to meeting the qualities I'm looking for and in the priority I have.  2) Some of the numbers exist, as pointed out many times in this thread.  I do realize the numbers don't tell the whole story.  It is just a starting point.    I've reached a point in the game where I have most of them at 60, and I can gear out almost any hero with close to BiS by unbinding things.  I've tried several heroes this way and haven't found one that I really like playing for various reasons.  Now that I've tried several, I know more about what I want but I'm having trouble finding it."

Ghost Rider was already suggested.  I checked the skill tooltips and found his nice damage negation that scales with health, plus ~500HP/s regen from one skill.  The thing that really sets him apart is 30% projectile deflection on top of everything else."
marvelheroes,3aodxy,ajs427,4,Mon Jun 22 06:41:51 2015 UTC,"GR is one of those good heroes with good regen and mitigation scaling with health(since MK and Punisher have been badly nerfed). GR starts at around 30k+ regen/minute and 20% projectile deflection with just his uniques equipped and maxed PtI. What's amazing about him is that he gets buffed up more when on top of an Inferno -- totaling to 40-50k regen/minute and 59% projectile deflection(frankly, I have no idea how his deflection goes up that high). What takes the cake about Ghost Rider is that any of his builds(Chains/Melee, DoT/Range/Mental) have decently long range which eases up movement and dodging. I have to check whether or not any of his skills lock you in place though(I'll get back to you on that).  That said, he still feels somewhat squishy if you're running any of the suicide nodes(Psionic, Chamber, Cerebro) or if you're going full Mental which is the build that scales immensely with lower health.  EDIT:  Stats without Inferno and stats with Inferno.  I forgot about how good/bad his TTK is actually since I never did test him so much against the dummy. Sadly, I'm pretty sure he's mid-tier(probably slower than Venom). And Chains of Perdition(Melee/Phys) and Infernal Skull(Ranged/Mental) seems to lock you in place for a few milliseconds until the skill is supposed to ""impact"" the target, so there's that; Damnation(DoT/Mental) doesn't lock you in place though."
marvelheroes,3aodxy,WhatImMike,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:23:42 2015 UTC,MKs nerf wasn't as bad as it was made out to be. We lost some mitigation but gained more DPS from avatar being buffed. Honestly it made the gameplay way more fun.

marvelheroes,3aodxy,PessimiStick,2,Mon Jun 22 18:34:57 2015 UTC,Checking skills isn't nearly enough.  Ms Marvel has a fairly sick heal on one her uniques for instance.  Fragment of Twilight has 300/s.  Core gives 400/s.  You can use Lemuria too.  This is why Punisher is still pretty awesome with top-end gear despite zero heals.  Omega tanking/healing is quite overpriced though so you can basically ignore that.

marvelheroes,3aodxy,Shermer_Punt,2,Mon Jun 22 14:39:25 2015 UTC,"I only played him to level him after the recent review.  Thing's forums have a 4:20 TTK posted, so his DPS is top-tier.  He also has CC immunity during Clobberin' Time, which seems possible to maintain indefinitely.  For survivability, he has 25% damage negation all the time and ~ 300 HP/s regen during Clobberin' Time.   That seems about average, but he doesn't have dodge or projectile deflection and Thing's forum posts recently have complained about his survivability as a result of lacking projectile deflection.  I do keep in mind that items can make a bigger difference than innate hero skills, in many cases.  However, some benefits can only be obtained from skills, and starting with a good hero means that much more when you throw good items at them."
marvelheroes,3aodxy,and29,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:18:47 2015 UTC,"Thing also has a 7s cooldown skill with 5 second duration with 50% negation (if you pick ""Lets Roll Suzie"" as his Fantastic Friend power).

He doesn't have a set rotation, which has been brought up by Gnome and Jordan on the MK hero forums.   With his play style you don't wanna be in faces of bosses. Most melee, including MK, get punished a lot in CMM/CICP from my experience. The 60/40 trade off is more damage output as opposed to the negation you're looking for.   Have you played Cap? He seems like the guy you're looking for.    Edit: My rotation for MK bolas every 8s and crescent fan to keep the bleed up. Cestus for bleed and Spiked for spirit regen/faster DPS. For trash I spam fan and bolas on blue mobs. I have 0 problems with any cosmic boss and have soloed Elektra/Kigiri in CICP with one death and that's cuz I rolled into Elektras divebomb."
marvelheroes,3aodxy,tadhgadams,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:55:10 2015 UTC,"Silver Surfer. I don't think his mitigation is any higher than the ones you already looked at, but his movement build allow his damage intake to be much lower to begin with. Unfortunately that is not something you will be able to determine from stats and will require some hands on experience with him, but I found Surfer to be by the hero I have the least survivability concerns when playing. The opposition is really not designed to provide a challenge to a fast moving kit. You will basically only take heavy damage if you choose to.  You need to enjoy the movement playstyle though, a lot of people don’t."

marvelheroes,3aopzk,Mvmt_Productions,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:43:45 2015 UTC,"For starters, a gtx770m is not the same performance of a similar model number discrete desktop gpu.  Mobile versions of graphics cards are generally just glorified integrated chips, save for something like the new 980m.  Your gtx770m, for example, has the G3D passmark score of 2709.  The desktop gtx760 has a score of 4965.   Your card's performance is closer to an old gtx460.  So for the future, saying you have a gtx770m isn't going to make it seem like there should be no problems running a game, as its performance is fairly poor compared to current and even last generation cards.  But that's likely not your problem anyway.  This game isn't very well optimized (one of its few shortcomings these days, but it exists), and is EXTREMELY cpu reliant.  This means if your cpu doesn't have very good single-thread performance, you're going to get these microstutters as the game struggles to load in sections of the zone you haven't been to yet/in a while.  Since you're on a laptop, single thread performance may be an issue but you didn't mention which cpu you're running so I can't say for sure.  Having the game on an SSD also helps with this.   Otherwise, you just have to get used to it like most other people who play the game.  Some people with really great rigs still run into the stuttering when they move really fast across a map like midtown."

marvelheroes,3aopzk,WideSmiles,-1,Tue Jun 23 01:44:45 2015 UTC,This game has serious memoryleak at times so check your RAM usage. I actually had to upgrade to 16GB while playing this because my 8GB overheated at 100% and died :p Unreal Engine 3 has been known to inflict memoryleak on some PC-s.
marvelheroes,3aopzk,axelnight,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:44:54 2015 UTC,"Load is generally not what overheats RAM.  Unless the stick is just plain faulty, RAM that runs too fast will usually crash the system long before it is worked enough to do lasting damage to itself.  Being full does not put any meaningful stress on RAM (though it will give your hard drive a workout as it steps in to take up the slack).  What cooks RAM is poor cooling (like hot case temperatures or a CPU fan that blows right onto it) and excessive voltage (such as from over-clocking, poor/faulty power supply/motherboard or power surges).  That said, resource leaks in games seem to be more of a CPU hog than a RAM hog these days.  It's true they can take up more RAM over time, and that can be an issue for low-RAM systems or 32-bit processes.  But often, the bigger problem is the games becoming a burden on their own engines.  As resources build up and aren't properly disposed, the engine will still process them as if they're relevant.  As they loop through more and more unnecessary data, the CPU becomes the bottleneck and the game performance drops no matter how much RAM it has to work with."

marvelheroes,3aopzk,SpyderBite36,0,Mon Jun 22 11:24:00 2015 UTC,Same here. While I have 16gb of ram; resource monitor shows only 20% usage on all high settings.
marvelheroes,3aopzk,zylli42,0,Mon Jun 22 11:28:05 2015 UTC,How much RAM does your system have?  Do you have a virus scanner running?  On-demand scanners cause delays in games if you don't add an exception for the game.
marvelheroes,3an4z9,spitzy1,22,Sun Jun 21 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"Is it beginner friendly, and what heroes would you suggest a new player starts off with? I've been thinking about Scarlet Witch because she seems pretty fun.   This is a super casual game.  Any content pre-level 60 (max level) you can do one-handed while you're drunk and watching a movie, easily, without any real threat of failure.  Even if you do manage to die, death carries little to no penalty.  If you're coming in with a general understanding of how the ARPG genre works, you need not worry about feeling like a beginner.  You'll probably feel like it's too easy, in fact.  As for heroes, just pick someone you like.  There are no good or bad choices.  There are a few heroes with mechanics that are somewhat more complex than other heroes (Rogue, for example, you need to build her powerset by picking which characters you want to steal powers from), but I wouldn't say there is any hero that is particularly difficult to grasp.  There are no roles like tank or healer...everyone's purpose is to deal as much damage as they can in as little time as they can.   Is it in any way pay to win?   No.  All heroes and team-ups (basically followers) can be bought in-game for currency that drops on a timer, and is given out as rewards for logging in daily (eternity splinters).  The in-game shop sells cosmetic costumes (which can theoretically drop, but in my 2000+ hours of playing, I've never seen one), boosts (experience boosts for faster leveling, and magic find boosts for a tiny increase in the quality of gear drops), and various other things like gambling cards...but nothing that I can think of would be considered pay-to-win.  There are no wearable items with stats that you can buy from the cash store that can't be bought in-game for in-game currency, the only one I can think of at all, even, is a pet which you can train to have stats via the cybernetics system...but again, you can gets pets a number of different ways (including by logging in right now, as the week 3 anniversary gift is an adorable Potted Groot pet).  So...no, no pay-to-win here.   Is there alot of lategame and game progression? I've had a ton of games just being a massive grind to max level and then theres no lategame at all and you just eventually quit because theres nothing to do.   At end-game, there are a bunch of different options, and your progression will be incremental gear upgrades, and slighly better rolls on pieces you already have, and the overreaching progression system known as Omega points, which you can farm to max pretty easily with a couple of hours of work.  There are four main things to do at end-game: raiding, terminal grinding, patrol zone grinding, and team content.  Raiding is pretty straight forward, larger 10-man instances that require coordination and knowledge of the fights.  Personally, I don't like this game's take on raiding.  They're well put together, I just don't think this medium really works for this kind of encounter.    Terminal grinding means running small personal instances over and over again for specific pieces of gear and high amounts of experience.  This is kind of boring, but you can get some of the best pieces of gear in the game with this method.  These can be done with 1-5 people, and scale in difficulty with the number of people in your group.    Patrol zones are my favorite.  They are larger more open zones with a number of other players you can group with (but don't have to).  There are currently two patrol zones: Midtown Manhattan (MM) and Industry City Patrol (ICP).  The former spawns a wave of bosses every three minutes, and otherwise is just filled with a ton of bad guys to whomp on.  The latter is an objective-based thing where you'll get a different objective or series of objectives every couple of minutes.  These areas can have great loot drops, and high amounts of exp, and I personally find them the most fun.  Team-content refers to three team-style game modes or challenges which exist: Holo-sim (a 2-person wave-based instance), X-Defense (a 5-person wave-based instance) and Age of Ultron (which I have no idea what is because I've never felt inclined to play it).  I would say these are the least popular activities at max level, as they typically do not provide significant rewards.  They are more of a challenge to yourself to see how far you can get.  Most people don't think they are really worth the time.  Personally, I don't really like the end-game very much.  I love this game for the mindless level grinding.  After you get a hero to level 60, you can prestige that hero, dropping down to level 1 and doing it again.  This is indicated by your player name being a different color (green, blue, purple, orange, red, or yellow, in order).  After I got every hero in the game to level 60, I started prestiging.  That's how I have the most fun...I load up something on Netflix on the side monitor and mindlessly grind levels.  Not much reward to this, but I find it entertaining.   How does gear work? Is there ancients/Legendaries/uniques, and can you craft or someway make your gear better?   Each character has 5 primary slots of gear (cleverly named slot 1-5) that are personal to that character and that character only.  These are the most common drops, and can be a number of different rarities (grey, white, green, blue, purple, cosmic [yellow], unique [gold]).  It's not worth bothering picking up anything blue or below ever, and only worth picking up purple gear if you currently aren't wearing anything at all.  These slots of gear drop constantly, and 99% of them are junk (there is an auto-loot vaporizing mechanic so you still benefit slightly from drops without having to bother clicking on each individual piece).  Heroes have individual unique items for each of their slots, but there are also ""any hero"" uniques - unique items which can be worn by any hero.  These are usually garbage, but there are some really fantastic and best-in-slot items that are any-hero as well.    Other slots include: artifacts, relics, rings, insignias, medallions, uru-forged, pets, legendaries, and costumes.  Artifacts are pieces of gear that can be worn by any hero that give specific bonuses, and can be enhanced via blessings during late-game.  Relics are items that give very small bonuses individually, but stack up to 1000, with pretty high diminishing returns.  Usually a good idea to have a stack of 50-100, at least.  Rings are basically an any-hero extension of the slot 1-5 pieces.  There are cosmic rings, and some very specific unique rings that drop from ICP.  Insignias are similar, although I don't think there are cosmic insignias that drop in-game yet.  Medallions are basically wearable boss trophies.  Each has different stats, and can be either blue (low level), purple (higher level), or cosmic (higher level and a rare drop).  Uru-forged items are items with static stats that can be enchanted with runes to give stats that work specifically for whatever hero you're enchanting for.  There are level 25 urus and level 50 urus, the latter being basically double the former.  Pets, as mentioned before, benefit from the cybernetics system.  This system sucks up slots 1-5 gear drops and, after enough, unlocks a bonus on your pet that can be erased and re-rolled if you don't like it.  There are cybernetics bonuses for all five standard rarities of items: green through unique.  Legendaries are expensive items that you need to level to get the full benefit of.  Each costs 300 odin marks, which you acquire from grinding legendary quests, and you level via just gathering experience as you normally would.  They are very powerful.  There are new higher level legendaries that are only available at level 60.  I don't know much about those though, as I don't play much at 60.  Costumes are their own slot, and you can roll affixes on them to empower them with stats.  There are four grades for affixes (1-4) and you can roll either an offensive affix or a defensive affix for each of those grades.  This costs credits, and can get very expensive when you want specific stats on your hero's costume.  Costume can be upgraded to higher levels later on with costume cores.  Finally, there are team-ups, which are not technically an item slot, but can kind of be treated like one.  Team-ups can be active, meaning they follow you around and attack things, they can be call-ins, meaning they fly in and do a bunch of damage and leave, or they can be passive, meaning they passively give you bonuses to your stats and occasionally perform an off-screen attack.  Team-ups have their own specific gear slots, and these pieces of gear can affect either the team-up, or the player.  There is a crafting system, but it's kind of garbage in its present form.  It is only really used to re-roll rare artifacts, to roll costume affixes, and to strip crappy rolls off your pet.  With raiding, they introduced raid currency which you can use to upgrade your slots 1-5 uniques as well, and to craft raid-specific pieces of gear, but it's a fledgling system.  I honestly don't really consider it a ""crafting"" system so much as it is a vendor you buy gear from.  So...yeah, hope that's helpful.  Think that's the longest Reddit post I've ever written.  Hope you enjoy the game, and feel free to ask any questions you might have."

marvelheroes,3an4z9,buddhacanno2,5,Mon Jun 22 05:32:25 2015 UTC,"I too came from PoE.  This game is easy.  Really easy.  The ""hard"" part of it is learning the dozen different item/stat systems in the game.  Basically Gaz decided to try a new one with every item slot, then tacked on some other stuff, then tacked on yet another one, and so on.  Once you figure each one out, its a pretty simple game.  Also like PoE, buy some stash tabs and save yourself some headache."

marvelheroes,3an4z9,ProfJackAss,5,Sun Jun 21 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"scarlet witch is a good starting choice.  It is not pay2win in the slightest and anyone saying it is doesn't understand what pay2win means.  Like any ARPG it is all about endgame gear farming.  Unlike every other ARPG out there this game has 10 man raiding at top level as well as cosmic difficulty terminals and patrol zones.  We also have Xdef, Holosim, and ultron mode.  Unless you are one of those no-lifers that sit around playing games 24/7 you wil never get bored in MH.  Gear is common/uncommon/epic/cosmic/unique(think legendary from D3).  On top of that there are artifacts, legendaries(items you have to level up) and many other gear options.  Yes, you can use the crafter/enchanter to make them all better."
marvelheroes,3an4z9,ProfJackAss,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:53:18 2015 UTC,"That's alot of different things, I guess it takes a while to learn it all. But it sounds pretty fun! Well some days I no life pretty hard but I have my casual days aswell :P  How long does it take to get to level 60? (which I think is max level atm?)  Can you start raiding right of the bat as you reach 60?  The gear system sounds interesting, does uniques have special stats or something considering I read somewhere they can't be traded? any reason for this?"
marvelheroes,3an4z9,SpyderBite36,3,Sun Jun 21 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"60 is the max level and it will never go beyond that.  As to how long it takes I can't remember how long it took my first time through as every additional 30/50/60 gives you an exp bonus up to 200%.  Green muspelheim is a joke, but you should still have your 5 level 60 uniques and a legendary at least.  In order of difficulty it is green muspelheim, red muspelheim, then green axis, then red axis (not yet released).  Each specific unique has specific stats with a high-low rng range.  So farming uniques is a big part of the endgame.  Optionally you can reroll them but that is a huge waste.  They can't be traded because they are easy to get, there is no point.  On the other hand, boss specific uniques are very good, very top end, and can't be traded likely because they actually want people to have to farm them.  Edit:  This post seems to be getting a lot of downvotes.  i will assume it is because I stated this game will never go past level 60.  For those of you who weren't around, or don't remember, Gaz did a poll on the official website asking how the community feels they should handle an ""expansion"".  The result was a resounding NO for going past level 60 and they said they will listen."
marvelheroes,3an4z9,smittyphi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:08:50 2015 UTC,Ah I personally love farming so that sounds nice! :) So are uniques instance/zone bound or is it randomly dropped anywhere? and can you run the same instances/zones multiple times to farm the item you're looking for?
marvelheroes,3an4z9,and29,0,Sun Jun 21 22:15:53 2015 UTC,"All uniques that aren't boss specific drops can drop anywhere.  Specific bosses can be formed for specific drops via terminals (3 dif, green, red, cosmic) or one shots (like an rp terminal).  There are also raid boss specific uniques, but like raids in any game each character can only get loot off one boss once per week.  Resetting on Wednesday."

Also she is so heads and shoulders more powerful than any other hero that you will basically play through story mode in My Little Ponies difficulty.  Scarlet Witch has top tier survivability, top tier single target, top tier AoE, top tier mobility, and even top tier CC and probably the most powerful sig in the game, she literally has no downsides or even any aspect that is mediocre.  Id suggest starting off with a solid but not over the top hero like captain america who is 400 ES and then buying Scarlet witch later for 200 ES. (you save 200 ES going this route)"

Personally, I would avoid started with the end-all-be-all character simply because it will make the other heroes in the game look like shit in comparison.  Going from a shitty hero (like Deadpool or Cable or Human Torch) to an awesome hero (like Scarlet Witch, Captain America, or Iceman) is going to be a vastly different - and usually more pleasant - experience than doing the opposite, going from the badass hero to the shitty hero."

A hardcore player can get to 7500 fairly quickly with dedicated farming. wile a casual player could talk a very long time.

Gear has stats, if you're coming from D3/POE then you know rarity scales (Grey junk - White Junk - Green Junk - Blue Junk - Purple items - Yellow Items - Unique items which are the end game gear in like 99% of the end game builds), and getting the recipes to make it better is part of the end game progression.

marvelheroes,3an4z9,ledbetterus,0,Mon Jun 22 01:00:00 2015 UTC,"The game is a very easy hack-n-slash and only the 2 raids requires any real effort. Even then, you can sleepwalk through green raids once you get the right gear. Scarlet Witch is a very good and cheap choice for a hero. Captain America, Invisible Woman, Ms Marvel, and Rocket Raccoon are fun too. The only thing that's even remotely close to P2W are the STASH storage spaces.  You're going to be disappointed with MH2015 too. The endgame is terrible in this game and drove me to playing other games. Might quit altogether and save 30GB of space. Your endgame experience will still either consist of leveling different characters to 60 or it'll be a massive boring grindfest (farming the same 3 cosmic terminal bosses (Mandarin, Doom, Kurse), farming CMM zone, farming Axis and AoU one-shots, or doing raids once per week per character). The grind wouldn't be that bad if the gameplay was more engaging. New content in this game is usually just leveling a new hero. It takes a long while to get actual gameplay content. Gearing is easy to pick up. DPS is the only way to play in this game so its all about Attack, Crit/Brut damage and percentages. Only a handful of artifacts are useful. Other than Life-On-Hit, invulnerability, and health on medkit, defense and defensive items are useless. Crafting is terrible in this game."

marvelheroes,3an4z9,ledbetterus,2,Mon Jun 22 00:12:43 2015 UTC,"Your view of the endgame in MH differs greatly to mine.  I understand how one could find the grinding boring, but IMO it's what sets this game a part from other ARPGs.  You hit a wall in Diablo 3 once you hit 70 and get 800+ paragon points.  And even then all the paragon levels do is slightly up your power.  I haven't played PoE enough to know how much ""endgame"" exists, but I highly doubt it's even half as in depth as MH.  If you like to grind and get stronger, MH is 100% the way to go.  The more you play the game the stronger you become, literally.  It's not just a stat here or there either.  Every 500 or so omegas could add extremely noticeable differences to your characters.  There is almost no end in sight either.  48 playable characters, and growing monthly (usually).  Each character can be re-leveled 6 times (mainly for vanity name colors, but also helps the epeen).  Gearing every character is daunting and even people who play all day every day cannot even be close to having everything fully geared with their best-in-slots.  It's what every hardcore MMO player wants.  The more time you put into this game, the stronger you will become.  And it's noticeable!  (games like D3, which technically make you stronger, hardly give you a noticeable, and fun, upgrade to your characters.)  The game does accomplishes this while still allowing a new player to do just about everything a veteran can.  Unlike D3 also, there's a HUGE social aspect to this game.  You see a lot of people in hubs all of the time.  Also while you can technically queue for raids/other, the /lfg channel is your gateway to the community and end game content.  It's a lot more personable, and even though there are indeed a lot of people playing this game, you tend to run into a few of the same people now and then, which IMO is a lost art in MMO-type games these days.  tl;dr Endgame is subjective, and if you LOVE ARPGs and the never ending grind, the MH endgame is the most in depth and long lasting end game I've ever seen.    EDIT:  Even though I did say that it's ""what every hardcore MMO player wants"", this game is actually VERY casual friendly and allows you to play the game the way you want to without making you feel like you HAVE to do things.  The hardest core person and the most casual person can find a lot of common ground in this game."

I wouldn't call that a HUGE social aspect since that's basically the norm in almost every MMORPG. It might be HUGE if you compared it to D3 or PoE (twss), but I've never played those 2 games so I can't compare to them. Besides, MH doesn't really encourage social/co-op play outside of raids and the occasional buff when using party boosts since you can do everything else more efficiently while soloing.   Endgame is subjective, and if you LOVE ARPGs and the never ending grind, the MH endgame is the most in depth and long lasting end game I've ever seen.   If MH is the most in depth and long lasting endgame you've seen ...hmm... sounds a tad exaggerated or you haven't played any decent MMO(A)RPGs games. There's a reason why a lot of vets left or hasn't played as much that has nothing to do with IRL stuff. Raids are the only endgame content that has any depth, but they limit the incentive to do it to once per week or one Surtur/Onslaught fight per hero per week.  The game is casual though. You can take a month off, come back, and still have better gear than half the people out there or in your raid. Usually, the only thing you'll need to catch up on is the new hero build and what costume got released."
marvelheroes,3an4z9,BattleBra,0,Mon Jun 22 20:35:58 2015 UTC,"The thing is, social aspects in MMOs are dead.  You queue up for something, get randomly assigned a group of faceless people, do your task, and never see those people again.  For the last 6 or 7 years this has been the standard in MMOs.  MH's /LFG is an oldschool style system where people actually have to communicate to eachother rather than just hit a button.  Also I don't know any other MMO ARPGs on the market right now.  Are there any?  I guess POE is sort of MMOish, but D3 is not an MMO.  While you are ""limited"" to Surtur/Onslaught farming.. it's 48 damn times per week.  That's like 12 hours a week solely dedicated to 2 bosses if you choose to do so.  Again, you're views and mine differ.  It's clear you don't consider farming and gearing up everyone on your roster part of the end game, but, really, it's the perfect end game.  You can play this game all day every day and still have something to accomplish.  That's the purpose of even having an end game, so the game never ends."

The bias is strong in this one.  /ignored        Mirrors63Edge is correct on all points. While this game has no diversity in player builds, itemization, and endgame content, it is still fun. The majority of the people on this Reddit has no argument for the 3 points I bolded. None. I guarantee it."
marvelheroes,3an4z9,ProfJackAss,4,Mon Jun 22 05:40:03 2015 UTC,"player builds   To be fair, a limited number of player builds per class is a bigger concern in games where there are only 6 classes.  There are 48 playable characters in this game, and there is a decent variety from one to the next."
marvelheroes,3an4z9,EMFCK,0,Mon Jun 22 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"Looks like we got a PoE fanboy in the house.  What's Kripparian up to these days?  There are many builds you can do with every hero.  Stop net decking cookie cutter builds on the forums and you'll realize that a low TTK doesn't mean you have to build that way.    Also while the items may not be super diverse there are enough quality options in each slot aside from a specific heroes uniques.    And again, endgame is subjective.  If you don't find raiding and about 40 other things to be considered endgame then that's on you.  Get 9 other people together in PoE and run a raid.  Lastly, along the PoE lines.. The one thing that impresses me about PoE, the custom map system, is coming to MH near the end of the summer.  Adding yet another part of end game to an already robust game."

marvelheroes,3an4z9,TangoApple,-8,Mon Jun 22 22:51:40 2015 UTC,"The game can be a little overwhelming but it's not bad.   I was just like you, spend ages in d3 and poe and came here. Unfortunately i played about 2 weeks and quit.  As far as I noticed this game is extremely low unless you are willing to spend money. You get almost no storage space and you can get almost no heroes unless you do it this way. takes like a week of constant playing to unloch each champ.   The other thing that I really hated about this game is the weekly caps and weekly resets. You can only do raids once per week(theres 3) doing them over does not yield pretty much the only reason you are doing them as a new player which is commedations to upgrade your gear. It takes roughly 2 months before you have full end game gear and can actually do end game content/ the hardest raids. I am a super nerd and spend anywhere from 8-10 hours a day on games so this game was just not the right one for me. If you are kinda the same in regards of srs d3/poe gamer. You will get fed up with waiting out weeks to get commedations and probably end up quiting liek I did.  However if you like more grindy games where you just do the same thing over and over and over and over. and level characters doing the same thing over and over and over you might enjoy it.  Uniques are the best form on gear in this game for your heroes. And artifacts are also used. These are certain boss drops uniques that you use for crit dmg/rating. Artifacts can be traded. Uniques can not.   Scarlet Witch is probably one of the most op characters in the game so she's a fine first champ, however every champ you play after her will seem shit.  If you have anymore questions feel free to ask."

I think I'm atleast going to try out the game but if it is as you're saying that It's very limiting and p2win I might reconsider. Thanks for the heads up though."
marvelheroes,3an4z9,Locogemini,3,Sun Jun 21 21:35:00 2015 UTC,"no limits. I think I'm atleast going to try out the game but if it is as you're saying that It's very limiting and p2win I might reconsider. Thanks for the heads up though.   I'm the same, and I never run of things to do. One of the main currencies that you will need, Odin Marks, has no limit, and the progression xp system for the long run (Omega points) also have no limit. Its not p2w because there is no paying to remove those weekly caps. You can buy potions that will save time on grinding xp or Odin Marks, but you still have to grind a lot. You can play for hundred or even thousands of hours completely free."
marvelheroes,3an4z9,Dirk_8,2,Sun Jun 21 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"The game is not pay to win at all, though it is true the amount of stash space you get by default is very limiting, so if you enjoy the game it is generally recommended you spend a little bit of money and buy 1-2 of each types of stash.  As for the limits, the commendation cap limits how quickly you can buy the item level 66 and 69 recipes, it may be an issue for you, but it's not that big of a deal in my opinion and they don't take that long to get if you start raiding early (I recommend a newbie friendly supergroup/guild for that). Loot explosions in raids is once per week, per hero, so if you have multiple heroes with decent gear you can raid and get loot many times during the week. Commendations and raid loot explosions are the only things in the game that have a weeky cap or limit.  As for places you can hop on and just farm in, currently there are two patrol zones, terminals, one shots, ultron mode, x-defence and holosim. Though the last 2 are pretty bad for loot at the moment. Coming somewhat soon is the danger room, which is somewhat like the PoE map system from what I hear (not played PoE personally). I can't speak for PoE, but compared to Diablo 3 which I played a lot this game has a much better variety of things to do at level 60 IMO, especially when the weekly events are taken into consideration."
marvelheroes,3an4z9,MutatedSpleen,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"Raiding early as in start to raid as soon as you get 60 or can you read before that aswell?  What are all these zones and terminals, is it basically just instances/zones/quests you clear for rewards/exp?"
marvelheroes,3an4z9,ShumaG,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:03:24 2015 UTC,"Raiding as soon as 60 is a bit unlikely. You generally need a legendary item and four artifact blessings, and a all level 60 uniques and you're good to go for the first and easiest raid. Public groups have varying requirements, but there are supergroups who will help you out and ease you into them even if you're a little under the general requirements.  So the different modes are:  Midtown Patrol & Industry City Patrol: Decently sized open maps with multiple players that have events that happen every few minutes, as well as side bosses that spawn in the zone on a 1-2min timer. Midtown's events are boss waves, and Industy City has a few different types that string together (Kill minibosses > save hostages > kill main boss, that sort of thing). Great places for loot and on mondays Midtown Patrol has special chests and cards that drop with better loot and exp. You don't need a group for these as other players will be in the same zone.  Terminals & One-Shots: Terminals are a selection of bosses from the story. There is, I think, 11 in total now. They are straight up boss runs for the most part, and are ran in for either exp or the artifact or unique that specific boss unlocks. They range in difficulty from green, to red, to cosmic (hardest). One-Shots are basically longer Terminals with a couple of objectives and 1-3 bosses, again farmed for the boss loot. You can solo both of these, but people run them in groups too. You can also set the game to automatically put you with other players for these modes.  Ultron mode: The only content outside of raids that needs a full group for it to be worth it. Ultron mode is basically a 4-stage mission that takes 10-12 mins with a decent group. At the end you kill Ultron and get a bunch of chests with the chance of loot exclusive to that area. You can queue up to find other players or go to the LFG chat for this.  X-Def and Holo-Sim: These are essentially survival modes, they're not played very often at the moment as the loot is pretty bad there but there are plans to overhaul them eventually."
marvelheroes,3an4z9,tgkpz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:17:01 2015 UTC,Ah sounds like theres alot of different things to do in this game then! Are you limited on how many terminals/patrols you can do or is it unlimited and you do as many as you like? Also do you mainly run these for drops or is it for exp farming aswell?
marvelheroes,3an7fa,TheRuinedKing1,3,Sun Jun 21 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've had one on both my accounts. It seems to be quite rare judging from other comments I've read. I've had similar issues with a couple of heroes in my time, Cable's boots and Cyke's Punchlops spring to mind. Try playing a lot of midtown tomorrow or get in on those Bovineheim runs and you might get lucky. I always find a lot of Doombots in MM, there's still Ultron bots too. Remember you need to clear mobs to get fresh spawns, so if you're just zipping back and forth without killing anything not a lot will change. I haven't played Vision but it looks like an on-going problem. From what I just read prestige is the only way to get rid of it at this time."

marvelheroes,3amvnh,picklechucker,0,Mon Jun 22 02:19:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't done the Axis Raid yet, but I've had no trouble at all in CMM, CICP, Red and Green Muspelheim with Spider-Man ever since his uniques were re-done.  I've been gearing up Hawkeye and he has no trouble surviving in CMM and CICP either because of shrieking arrow.   Have no trouble either with Black Widow since she can kite pretty easily with her stealth from her movement ability and signature.   Ghost Rider can handle all of it with ease since he has quite a good amount of damage negation + regen. Also Penance Stare.  Just a note though, melee heroes in general have a harder in the Cosmic patrols because some of the abilities on bosses like Batroc or Hyde can one-shot you. Also AoE heavy boss waves like the Brotherhood of Mutants in CMM can be pretty annoying. Still doable though if you play with caution."
marvelheroes,3amvnh,BEALLOJO,-9,Mon Jun 22 03:15:04 2015 UTC,"Note: if you play hawkeye and you're surviving in Cosmic patrol modes, chances are you aren't doing enough damage to make up for the boss scaling your presence causes. Hawkeye: not even once."
marvelheroes,3amvnh,picklechucker,3,Sun Jun 21 20:18:14 2015 UTC,"Hence why shrieking arrow makes surviving easy as hell so you can do your rotation without any trouble.   And as far as the dps goes, I'm not doing as much my other heroes due to gear but it still shouldn't be an issue. Waves take a minute at most when I'm in them. If anything their easier since shrieking arrow tends to clump em up so everyone can AoE them.   Every hero is capable of pulling their own weight, given the correct uniques, artifacts, build, etc... When it comes to the harder content actually surviving eventually takes precedence over dps."

marvelheroes,3ajx2p,WhatImMike,2,Sat Jun 20 22:45:18 2015 UTC,Shift dragging one by one is one of the most tedious things to do.  Main reason I do not bother making relic stacks of 250 to use on multiple heroes instead of 1000 on one hero as it takes just way too long.  It's almost as bad as breaking down materials to roll costume affixes.
marvelheroes,3ajx2p,DarknessMuta,3,Sat Jun 20 23:30:20 2015 UTC,I just came back after almost a year off and I still can't believe all the useless crafting mats required to do things.  Costume affix rolling is one of the worst parts of the game.

If you have spirit issues, you should go for +3 strength (physical) or +3 energy (energy and/or mental).  Summoners want +3 intelligence.  Multi damage-type heroes want +3 fighting.

I'm waiting for all the TU2.0 stuff to get sorted out before I start doing any gearing out, and I'm just going to let the TU TTK's figure out who does the most deeps for me.

That's when most of us are eating dinner and having drinks anyway, so that's when we should get the most discount off our drinks.  (non-ironically: Gaz has a vested interest in maintaining a high server population at all times.  It encourages people to keep playing if there's always a good crowd online.  It spreads the server load and CS load out more evenly.  It maintains higher average population numbers for them to report.  Having a system designed to encourage spiky logins over the weekends is counterproductive since it increases their load costs during the spikes, and can lead to a runaway ""ghost town"" effect during off-peak times)."

There is almost always something on sale, you get a free thing everyday, we get free pets, heroes costumes, team ups, boosts etc.  Bonus XP is baked into the game!  That never happens anymore, even mmos that have been online for years and are struggling.  The generosity of this game reminds me of the spirit of how mmos were 15 years ago when not many played them.  City of Heroes used to have double xp weekends and during the holidays you could kill holiday bosses and mobs and level up an alt in a fraction of the time.  These kinds of bonuses and free things are happening less and less these days.  I don't know why.  Maybe the market is so flooded with players that devs dont need to give away things to encourage people to play, MH doesn't seem to care about that.  They want to make their players happy.  Whenever I see a thread that says, ""You gave us free stuff, but this free stuff sucks,"" or ""Why don't we get more free stuff?"" It makes me sick.  You have no idea how lucky you are and on general principal of looking a gift horse in the mouth makes you look like a clueless 9 year old brat that wasn't raised right.  TLDR; Pepperidge Farms remembers when free stuff didn't grow on trees for mmos and when devs ignored their player base (right now.)  Say thank you and be grateful."

You speak as if the players owe gaz something, or that it costs gaz money to toss up a server side boost. Neither is the case. Its gaz's job to attract and please players, not the players' job to please gaz. Video games are nonessential. People have the right to set whatever standard they like for how they spend their nonessential time and money. There's no reason to insult them because they hold a higher standard for how they want to spend their free time than you.  You criticize people for being upset with free stuff, but you ignore the context in which the complaints are made. For the most part, people appreciate the free stuff. There are usually more than a few questionable decisions though about how they implement such things, rarely with any explanation from gaz. Friday patch days, anniversary day with less going on than the entire month before it, dev team working on minor new content rather than fixing problems the game's had since launch, making new characters more powerful than ever when half the roster is struggling to be playable, these things effect a player base's disposition.   When a player is already frustrated by these issues and gaz proudly announces their gift of massive bonuses on a day you can't play, of course they're going to complain about it. This is compounded by the extremely extremely low drop rates of necessary equipment for endgame content."

I supported since Beta and would like to continue to but I would like to see some changed to the decision making. If no one grips about it then they're just gonna continue to do what they think is best for the customers even if its not. I don't think Gaz are jerks cause they listen to the players a lot so I'm griping in hopes that they listen and change it. If they don't I won't get mad cause like you said it's a free game. I don't have to pay to play it but if they keep doing what they feel instead of what the players what then eventually we just won't support them anymore and just play the game for free like originally stated.

marvelheroes,3afhgy,Sazgo,3,Fri Jun 19 19:10:02 2015 UTC,"I started playing marvel heroes toward the end of last year and its the thing i hate the most about the game.  I feel like they spoil us too much with events, especially the scaling ones to the point where there is little reason to play the game outside of the last 1-2 days of each event. To me i feel like im wasting my time being ingame on a non event day when i could play on the last day of an event to get 2-3x times exp or drops. I would rather they just do an even +100% for a week bonus or lay off the events totally replacing them with something else more interesting. Right now its just a pop boosts and grind all day on the last day"
marvelheroes,3afhgy,Spugnacious,2,Fri Jun 19 21:40:46 2015 UTC,"So right now, even though the bonus is 'Only' 44%, I just spent three hours banging away to get more cake slices, splinters and Odin's favors. Cashed in my slices to get another cake, popped it and Got the Red Skull's Coat (Woo hoo!) and have a 150 slices towards another cake tomorrow. Oh, and I'm well over a thousand splinters and over 500 odin's favor. And shucks... I only pulled down about 15 Omega orbs.   But yeah, playing now is a total waste of time. What was I thinking?"
marvelheroes,3afhgy,Sazgo,0,Sat Jun 20 06:21:29 2015 UTC,"The point is if you had spent those 3 hours doing that on an event end day you would have ended up with double or triple the loot (rng depending) so could have had 2 top uniques maybe 3, due to more cake drops and 30 - 45 omegas It all depends on how you value your time. I see it that 6+ hours grinding on a Friday is the same as 3 hours on a Thursday etc. Which to me makes me want to do other things those days and wait.  Dont get me wrong, i love the game and log in to do dailies. Just the grinding/farming i feel the events basically control when i can do that efficiently"

Yes, if you played at the end of the event, you'd get 2-3x what you'd get now in the same amount of time...but that doesn't mean you don't get anything for playing now.  See, there's this weird thing where people actually ENJOY playing this game.  I know, it's strange that somebody would play a game when they aren't getting the very greatest possible reward, but hey, some people are weird and enjoy having fun.  This isn't a thing where you have to choose only one day to play.  Plenty of people are playing every day because they like the game, regardless of the rewards.  If you don't enjoy this game enough to play it when you aren't being handed a bunch of free shit...I'm not really sure what you're doing here.

Why would you spent a day grinding omegas/farming at 1/3 efficiency, that isn't intelligent surely?

marvelheroes,3afhgy,Spugnacious,0,Sat Jun 20 12:42:03 2015 UTC,"Splinters, Favors and cake are unaffected by RIF and SIF dude. They're on a timer and the only thing that can be impacted is occasionally you'll roll a double drop of two delicious pieces of cake.  Cake is only going to be dropping during this event as far as I know and probably won't be back until next year. This is pretty much the only time you can get cake... if you want to wait for an optimal time to get XP as well, that's groovy.   Me? I want cake. Lots of it."
marvelheroes,3afhgy,LuminalOrb,3,Sat Jun 20 06:58:31 2015 UTC,"Splinters don't exactly work the way you describe.

So running SIF will increase how many splinters drop and their frequency. The cake slices are on a timer though due to a bug from the last anniversary that people exploited heavily. Hope that helps explain splinters a little."
marvelheroes,3afhgy,Jaggid,2,Sat Jun 20 07:58:56 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. Splinters and cake are both affected by SIF.  For splinters, this is even indicated in the tooltip for the special item find in stats.  Sif = Everything that drops which has a pink name.  Learn it, remember it.    The 'timers' also don't work the way your post implies that you think they do, by the way. The concept of the timers is that as your time without a drop reaches a specific point, the chance of you getting a drop gradually increases.  It is NOT that x amount of time must pass before you get a drop. With splinters, this means as you get closer to somewhere around the 8 minute mark you are pretty much guaranteed a splinter drop.   You can (and DO) get them in shorter time than that.  Even cake, which practically everyone is saying is on a timer like you seem to think...is not.  When the cake first started dropping everyone and their brother was posting in forums (and here) that the cake was on a '1 minute timer'.  Meanwhile, some of us were doing /time every time cake dropped and seeing times much lower than that between some of the drops.  I personally got cake with only 17 seconds in between the two drops within minutes of starting to do data collection.   And yep, I was running with high SIF."

I did so by pointing out that they can effectively give us nothing. By his argument we would be beggars ""whining"" if we had any criticism of them taking the game down. Thus his argument is nonsense.   They take our money.  They perform actions with that money.  Only a moron can argue ""it's free so stop whining"" if we critique their actions."

It's not something the previous posted said or implied.  You came to a conclusion that isn't there, and called your conclusion nonsense.  Nobody ever mentioned anything about beggars, whining, criticism of the game, or taking the game down.  All of that is stuff you just made up so you could call the argument nonsense."
marvelheroes,3afhgy,dorn3,0,Sun Jun 21 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"No it's not a straw man.   A strawman is when you take a ""superficially similar"" argument and refute it.  There's nothing ""superficially similar"" to point out that they could also ""give us server access"".  His argument is that they're giving us ""stuff"" for free.  I pointed out other ""stuff"" they give us free that we would criticize if they removed.  He literally said we can not complain if they take the servers down.  That exact argument is what came out of his mouth.  I'm using his exact argument and pointing out that it fails the test of logic.  Imagine someone said ""all birds fly"".  You wouldn't say it's a straw man to point out that Ostriches do not in fact fly."

You're using that person's ""exact argument"" in the same way that I'm currently arguing about the effects of nuclear testing on the environment (in the sense that that is not at all what we're talking about).  Or, to follow up your analogy, this person is saying ""I saw a bird fly once.  Some birds can fly"" and they you jump in with ""HAH! I KNEW IT! You're wrong because dogs can't fly!""  It's utter bullshit.  You have absolutely no argument.  This person is literally not talking about server access at all.  That's something YOU brought into the conversation to deflect the fact that you calling nonsense on this person's thoughts is bullshit.  That's the literal definition of a straw man.  Your point about not being allowed to criticize the game at all was never said by anybody except you.  It is an argument you brought up either erroneously, or because you realized you were talking bullshit and wanted to refocus the conversation.  Again, that's the literal definition of a straw man."
marvelheroes,3afhgy,dorn3,0,Sun Jun 21 16:51:46 2015 UTC,"I'll gladly point out where he literally said that.   It's a free bonus they don't have to give us.   Free bonus isn't a specific thing but a description of many things.  In this case I pointed out running the servers.  That is a ""free bonus"" they give us.  It's not a straw man to pick one of his many many examples.  He gave the examples and I picked one.   I won't complain about that. It's like a homeless guy complaining about someone handing him 5 dollars.   Here he's stating that we can not complain or else we'll be beggars.  Since I will not be a beggar he's saying I can not complain.

Here, you're saying that you fundamentally disagree with the idea of a capitalistic society, and in protest, you're going to move to an uninhabited island and attempt to create your own society.

Just because a time works best for you doesn't mean that it works best for everyone.    There are a lot of times on the weekend where I don't have time to play, and if I do, it isn't any more time than a normal weekday.  Weekdays are usually consistent since work basically sets the timings for the day.  Weekends however have a lot more randomness to them so for me, having high boosts on Thursday is just fine.  I think the primary point though, if you only like playing the game when there are 150%+ boosts, maybe it's time to find a different game."

Maybe it is (you gotta do (holo sim + 3 shared quests)x3 for 1 blue box vs. not sure how long for a cake, but maybe about the same time+?) but it is basically a blue box PLUS cosmic TU gear and a few other nice random items. I don't know, I don't mind it and think the pay off is quite the same. Yes you get omegas faster during omega week, but like I said, it lasts 1 week, every 4 or so weeks. If it's leveling you're after then this event is better than omega."

COWPOCALYPSE    Log in this Saturday to have a chance to play with David Brevik, who will be playing as the Cow King!

TEAM-UP CHANGES    During the Test Center portion of Team-Up 2.0, the maximum ranks for team-up powers was changed from 5 to 15.

Odin Bounty Boosts, Eternity Splinter Boosts and Patrol Boosts now stack to 40.  Fixed issue that would cause the Duplicate Uniques for a Stack of Relics recipe to fail  Fixed an issue that prevented other defeated players from showing up on the minimap.  Fixed an issue where the Magik Team-Up could not be purchased with Eternity Splinters through the roster.  Fixed an issue with the King Thor Team-Up preventing players from investing into the Arcing Hammer power.  Fixed an issue with the Drax Team-Up preventing players from investing into the Deep Wounds power.

ACHIEVEMENT CHANGES & BUG FIXES    New achievements added to Enemies > Adversaries:  The Spider-Clones  The Ninja  The Leaper  ""Stay...Down!"" achievement: Defeating the Wolverine clone in Green Terminal should no longer count towards the Story Mode objective.

marvelheroes,3afilg,bundto,3,Fri Jun 19 18:38:55 2015 UTC,"I come from a strong WoW background (and other Blizzard or MOBA games)... in my head ""pet"" means cosmetic pet that follows you.  In this game though it sounds like a pet offers some abilities and such? I know you can vacuum up items once your crafter & enchanter are level 20 with ""J?"" That will level your pet or ?  I'm happy to see that we are getting a free pet because I've been wanting one to test it out!  EDIT: Additional question, why would I want another default costume if I were to buy a hero pack? Do you use those in the 'blender' or do you affix different costume cores? What's the point? Also how many costume cores are there and are they actually useful?"
marvelheroes,3afilg,absynthe7,3,Fri Jun 19 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"""Pets"" are in fact non-combat, cosmetic pets (as opposed to ""Team-Ups"" which use a different slot and fight alongside you). However Pets that you've donated enough items to will provide you with statistical buffs, whether summoned or simply equipped. For instance, the Pet I have equipped on my Magneto right now usually isn't summoned, but always provides me with +3 Energy, +30 Spirit, and +6% Health.  As far as default costumes go - you can use the ""blender"" recipe at a maxed Crafter to change any three costumes into one random costume, so most people use extra defaults for that. Costume Cores are very useful, since they change the level of your Costume, and therefore the range of stats you can attach via Costume Affixes."
marvelheroes,3afilg,gaalia,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:51:06 2015 UTC,"pets started as cosmetic. they now have some stats based on the items they vacuum up (one tier for each colored item). here's a guide to what they can give: https://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/157058/small-pet-guide  re costumes, extras can be blendered but yes there is not as much use for them once you have one. You do get extra costumes from prestiging a character as well (which also changes your name color, it's just leveling a character over again), handy for the blender to get random costumes.   You can use multiple costumes for putting different affixes on, or different core stats, if you have multiple builds for a character. each type of costume core works with only certain heros. Most people use cores that have + health and spirit on medkit use, invulnerability on medkit use, and/or life on hit. if you get a core of any type with all three, it's worth quite a lot."
marvelheroes,3afilg,Quexana,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:51:26 2015 UTC,"In this game pets started out just as cosmetic pets that follows you around.  They can't attack, they don't give you an aura or anything, just cosmetic.  Now, what you do is vacuum up items with J, and they basically feed your pet.  Once, a certain number of gear is fed to the pet, it will give you stat bonuses, one for each grade (or color) of gear.  For example, the Unique grade stat bonus affects your attributes and can roll 1-3 for any attribute (ie +3 Durability, or +3 Fighting).  Suppose you roll +2 Intelligence and the hero you want to use the pet doesn't make good use of the Intelligence attribute.  Your crafter can reset the stat, allowing you to give more Uniques to the pet in order to hopefully get a shot at the Attribute bonus that will do more good for your hero.  If you don't like the stat that the pet is giving you, you can clear out that stat at the crafter and restart the process of feeding your pet for another roll."
marvelheroes,3afilg,unsettlingideologies,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:55:14 2015 UTC,"This answers the question I was going to ask. I only today realized that you even could have your pet following you around, and I suddenly realized I had no idea if having them ""active"" had any effect other than cosmetic. With the historic context that they were cosmetic to begin with, I now understand. I'm still a little confused why you can equip them and then still have to activate them to get the cosmetic effect to show."
marvelheroes,3afilg,gaalia,2,Fri Jun 19 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"because some people don't like pets, or don't want pets the mix teams (ie bamf with an avenger, or ultron following around, well, any hero), so this way if you want the pet out, it can be, but you're not forced to have it to get the benefit.   I do wish they'd have an option for always out pets. I like them but often forget to activate (or reactivate when I die)"
marvelheroes,3afilg,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:14:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. Pets offer addition bonuses to your stats in 5 different levels. They don't fight for you but all vacuumed loot goes to filling up these different levels for your pet, each level will give a random affix from a set of those that are available. You can reset these affixes at the crafter if you don't like which one you got. Here is a list of affixes for each category  I'm not 100% sure what you mean by another default costume. As for cores each hero has a specific core it uses from a pool of cores (Radioactive Core, M'Kraan core, Promethium Core, etc).  Most people use them for the added survivability. You can get cores that grant you 25% HP regen and 100 SP on medkit use, 2s Invulnerability, 2s Invisibility, and Life on hit to name a few."

Randomly re-installed the game last week-ish and was so lucky to get the free hero token.  Unlocked Deadpool and now I'm hooked.  Looking at the game now and how far it's come, I regret not buying the ultimate founder's pack back then.  So tempted to dump money for the megapack.  On a side note, Kudos to Gaz for constantly tuning the game and releasing new content.  I wasn't a fan of the business model at launch but you have convinced me this is a business model that works for long-term F2P games.  As long as you're constantly churning out new content, we'll keep buying them.  As long as we keep buying them, you'll be churning out new content.  With the countless characters and stories in the Marvel Omniverse, this is a solid business plan.  When considering the planned movies, tv series as well as the on-going comic series, you guys have a solid base of new and returning players for the next ten years at least.  Just like me!"

marvelheroes,3afilg,fitzjack,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:20:18 2015 UTC,I bought the Cable pack previously and that was a trainwreck but I've just busted 200 hours in the game as well as nailed some trigonometry assignments so I figured I'd give myself a $40 reward. I don't have any of the avengers and I'm digging the AoU costumes so the AoU pack on steam is really tempting me.  Will I have any issues since the pack isn't listed on their website?  Is the stuff listed on steam all that's in it? I've heard people listing stuff that isn't listed on steam.  Is there another pack you'd recommend over it?

Also, when I look at builds online, and I hover over items on the build, certain uniques have runes under them, which I guess means you have to enchant that item with these runes. However, when I go to my enchanter, I cant find any option to enchant uniques with any runes I want to, only specific enchantments using specific runes. None of these blessings match the ones in the builds. My enchanter is only level 10, but is there eventually an option to empower uniques with any runes I want?"
marvelheroes,3afilg,smittyphi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:53:02 2015 UTC,"The blender refers to the crafter vendor under costumes.  You take any 3 costumes with 2 unstable molecules and it spits out 1 random costume.  It can be any costume available, albeit one you just put in the blender or some other random one, not even associated with the character you are on at the moment.  The crafter has to be level 20.  Go to the Enchanter and go to the Enchant tab and they will be there.  And yes, your Enchanter needs to be at least level 15, I think."
marvelheroes,3afilg,CosmonautDrifter,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:59:55 2015 UTC,"You need to be leveling up your crafter and enchanter to 20 if you haven't already.  First, level your crafter to 15. Then get your enchanter to 15. Then finish your crafter off and then your enchanter.  The best way to do this is to trade 5 unique doops for 500k credit chests....when you get your crafter up to the appropriate level...which I think may be 15.

marvelheroes,3afilg,gaalia,3,Fri Jun 19 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"yes, he just takes longer to kill. It's pretty easy to find people in LFG willing to come with you though, and a lot of times during the event weekends where portals are given out people will run round robin groups, where each person uses a portal. 5x the loot!  but if you are very against grouping, you can still run by yourself, provided you have a strong enough hero. If you try it and can't kill the bosses, you can always invite people in at that point."

marvelheroes,3afilg,Canther,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:10:07 2015 UTC,"New player here(<2 weeks). I'm really enjoying the game and just got my first hero to 60.  I'm enjoying the game so much that I'm considering investing money into the game for a more pleasurable experience and to support the company.  I buy the occasional console game, but have never done any microtransactions.    The question is where do I start?  I'm positive I want a bank slot or two.  Beyond that I'm looking for a good deal on heroes/costumes.  I've seen starter bundles on other games that cover all the bases.  Does MH have a ""starter bundle""?  I would like to keep my first investment into the game around $20 if possible."
marvelheroes,3afilg,gaalia,3,Fri Jun 19 20:32:31 2015 UTC,"best thing you can do with $20 is to spend it all on stash space. I'd pick up 2 regular tabs ($5 each), a crafting tabs ($3 each) and a hero tab or two ($3.50). hero tabs will store any hero uniques as well as rings, uru forged items, and that hero's team insignia. crafting tabs store runes, elements, and costume cores.   There isn't really a 'starter pack' per se. The multi hero packs start at $40, as they come with extra costumes as well as the hero stash tabs.   Unfortunately we just completed a half off sale on most of the heroes and costumes, you won't find anything quite that good for a little bit now I suspect. If you're interested in playing a variety of heroes, I'd suggest using splinters to get random boxes until you have 15 heroes or so, then looking at buying. It ends up cheaper that way. :)"
marvelheroes,3afilg,TRenegade,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:00:56 2015 UTC,Been playing for a little less than a month.  I was not aware of the different tabs in the bank.

marvelheroes,3afilg,gaalia,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:08:09 2015 UTC,"it really will. getting stash has been my largest QOL improvement in the game. Though I was grinning for a week when I picked up throg, watching him hopping around after me XD. so that was a pretty close second.   it may make sense to get two crafting tabs, as runes almost fill up one. you can manage with that, but it's tough.  Good luck!"
marvelheroes,3afilg,Quexana,2,Sat Jun 20 00:16:47 2015 UTC,"Trust me, you don't want a stash spot or two.  You want a stash spot or eight.  I'd say I'm below average in terms of progression in this game (22 heroes unlocked, only 6 of them lvl 60, ~1500 Omegas) and I'm pretty tight on stash space with 12 tabs.  If you want to seriously invest in this game, get as many stash spots as you can comfortably afford.  You'll use them."

marvelheroes,3agy5b,_TakaMichinoku,5,Sat Jun 20 02:08:50 2015 UTC,"I feel as if the takedown achievements are in place to reward the item encase of REALLY bad RNG. I look at it as sort of a fail-safe. If you want the item then chances are you'll be farming for it anyways. If you get it before the achievement then awesome if not then you're still working toward something and will eventually get it.  As for why some take longer then others, beats me.  Both Zola and ACoC are in the same price bracket so no idea why you'd have to farm Jugg 500 times when Mandy only need to be done 350 times. Perhaps it's based on how fast the terminal can be cleared? Much easier to farm Jugg then Mandy."
marvelheroes,3agy5b,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,5,Sat Jun 20 02:39:43 2015 UTC,"Most likely it based length/layout, for juggs you just need  to go up and you will reach him but for Mandarin its trickier and takes slightly more time."
marvelheroes,3agy5b,WrathGhost,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:49:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they're based on length of terminal, as even with a tele-spam hero like NC it takes a good minute to get through a Mandarin run, while Juggy/Taskbastard you can clear in 15 seconds."

marvelheroes,3agy5b,unsettlingideologies,3,Sat Jun 20 02:55:29 2015 UTC,"Out of those 400,500,600 runs, we are bound to get an artifact drop   This isn't, strictly speaking, true. It's obviously possible, however unlikely, for the RNG to not give you one in 600 runs (or even 6000 runs, for that matter). Yes, you are correct that most people will get it, but this achievement exists precisely for those very few people who don't get it. Like the other bloke said, it's an insurance policy so to speak. If you get it in less, then you don't have to keep running them, but this way the RNG can't leave you totally high and dry."

marvelheroes,3agy5b,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:01:35 2015 UTC,Well if it wasn't a personal version the trade value of those items would fall. That might not sound like a bad idea though...who knows what it would do to the trade economy; might hurt it or help it.  There is a difference between the achievement reward and the dropped item though. You can trade the dropped one for something else perhaps.

He spent a considerable amount to my knowledge was never overturned but logically to most this is simply selling artifacts for real money which isn't cool and is just as bad as seeing another gold spammer but lately I've seen reasonably newer players mentioning it in chat and its not right for people that really don't know to get banned.

You don't suddenly receive what you're getting in return in a lil box from the person you're dealing with. It's people abusing a very good system such as gifting that is the problem. Not the actual system itself.

marvelheroes,3aeg66,Mandroll,2,Fri Jun 19 14:09:00 2015 UTC,Well making any sort of investment its a good practice to read the contract for what your leasing.  Time + money is an investment enough to thoroughly read the t.o.s. however most people need it to be right in front of them and easy on the eyes so maybe a new way the t.o.s. is displayed to us idk but should read up on it since it would suck to get a perma for something that five mins of reading could have prevented it.

marvelheroes,3aeg66,Doomgrin75,-1,Fri Jun 19 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you guys, some things need to be read; however, more and more games have that in their TOS and are allowing in game sale of their shop items. So while I can see that ""its in the TOS, don't do it"" is a valid argument, you have other mmos where it IS also in the TOS and its perfectly fine to do it. (See monthly sub token or in game store mount in that still popular mmo). So when you have examples like that, which are games with potentially a bigger player base than yours (see customer base), you have to take action so your customers know trading in-game store items isn't allowed... or that even talking about it. See have a top 20 quick ways to get banned in one of the shop panels. With the ""this list is not exhaustive and is meant as an aid to players, please refer to the TOS for additional information"".... you know something like that. That way they won't be losing customers (well the person was still buying something even if it was for gifting) and people who step in and tell them in social they xan get banned for it will have a quick reference in game so they aren't told to go f**** themselves...  But thats just me and that kind of reasonning is coming from my job soòoo yup always hold people by the hand and assume they don't know... especially if other, more popular products are encouraging it."
marvelheroes,3aeg66,Mandroll,-2,Fri Jun 19 16:14:02 2015 UTC,You have to agree to the MH TOS in order to have an account.  What other MMOs do is irrelevant.
marvelheroes,3aeg66,Gauntlet_of_Might,2,Fri Jun 19 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but out there, in the real world, when you agree to legal bindings, where precedents are established, those precedents have to be accounted for. Online games seem to, so far, have escaped that. So yes, I do believe most people should be held by the hand and told, in game, that they cannot trade in-store gifts for items. I mean, if I have to tell people not to stick their fingers in a rotating impeller that spins at 20ish miles per hours, that is razor sharp, and looks visually threatening when not spinning....and yes, one of the companies I work for was sued because someone stuck their fingers in there and there was no warning. Mind you there was one about not touching the blades...but there wasn't one about not touching the blade when spinning. Oh and the guy won....  So if you tell me its in the tos, I tell you that, that wording is found in other mmos where they encourage or tolerate the sale of in game items.  So while I agree with you, I still say we need to hold people by the hand. Especially since many just play the game for fun and will NOT read anything complicated... Hell they don't even read the red raid strat guides to know what the bosses do..."
marvelheroes,3aeg66,Mandroll,-2,Fri Jun 19 17:05:03 2015 UTC,"Except you are citing a case where the danger was NOT emphatically addressed and thus the plaintiff, stupid or not, can claim ignorance to the danger.  That is not the case here.  The TOS specifically addresses RW transactions for in game content as against the TOS.  Furthermore, you have accepted the TOS in order to create an account, your ignorance and stupidity have thus been waived as inconsequential.  For customer relations sake, I would encourage Gaz or any other software company to have a better account warning and/or short term ban than wholesale permanent hammer.  There is a long way from soliciting to an actual transaction."
marvelheroes,3aeg66,Doomgrin75,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:05:11 2015 UTC,"...""Never touch propeller blades or mechanism.."" was what was written so yes the danger was emphatically adressed. It stated to never touch them regardless of their state... we ended writing a new warning that said: never touch propeller blades while [...] or in movement.  So yes, according to courts, if I tell you to NOT touch something, I have to make sure I say to NOT touch it while its still OR in movement otherwise you can sue me... if I tell you that touching the blades will cut off your finger... do I really have to tell you that touching the blades, while they are spinning, will also cut off your finger... I just told you that touching the blade would cut off your finger. The state (idle of spinning) of the blade should NOT affect that. Because touching them will cut off your finger.  So... yeah. I totally think people need tobhave their hands held... and thats not even the stupidest example of lawsuit I had to deal with.... it was just a case of: we tell you never to touch the blades... NEVER .... so why ouching them while they are spinning an excuse to get money?"

The TOS in case case specifically, and in no uncertainty, forbids the sale of items in game for real-money or cash shop items.  You also have had to sign and agree to the TOS, so you have agreed to what is said is uphold-able by the company."
marvelheroes,3aeg66,KiFirE,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:01:57 2015 UTC,"Legally that is accurate. However  4.12 You may not advertise the intent to, commit the act of, or facilitate the ability of others to commit the act of, unauthorized selling or buying of in-game items for real-world monetary values or other consideration.  Vagueness of guidance: I won Gs while watching a stream. That G was given to the streamer by Gazillion. As a result, I refuse to recognize the monetary value of specific G as no monetary transactions were made to acquire it. Sure we can argue that the G has RW monetary value, but in this example, the customer can argue that no money was spent to obtain that G. Which makes this particular example fall under ""other considerations"" of that phrase.  Then you also have people who could argue that, in the event that gaz is reviewing every trade and transactions, they were given a GoK and were so happy they just decided to give the other person a skin they had wanted for a while. That ironically would be my type.... although not for a GoK but for an artefact I don' have And not as a means of trade, just as a thank you... Some of the people in my SG just don't have any disposable income (family+ house+ mid range paying job)... so if they just randomly dropped me an artefact I had been farming for a month or 2, I prolly wouldn't mind gifting them that skin they kept saying looked great... even if they hadn't asked for it. But then, that's a bannable offense ( even though, technically no transaction took place)  Finally you have person A who sees person B advertising they are looking for a liz formula for GoKs,  so person A refers them to person C who has a liz formula for trade. Person C and person B start talking, and unbeknownst to person A settle for trading a liz formula for a enhanced costume. Gazillion gets wind of the transaction through a random checkup and investigate it. According to the ToS, person B and C should get bans.... but also person A who facilitated the Ability of others To make that exchange. Hopefully the gaz rep uses good judgement and sees that person A refered person B to person C for a 10 GoK for 1 liz formula and not for a costume trade... but if the gaz rep only follows the rules, he'll ban all 3 players... Thats at least 1 paying customers and 2 potential ones.  So all 3 of those examples show a case that can be arguably unfair (though personally, the 3rd one is the only one I perceive as unfair for person A)...  So no, I don't believer that the ToS  specifically and in no uncertainty... It's there but people who aren't careful in the reading can find themselves in awkward situations (see example 3) or genuinly receive a ban if if no trade took place ( see example 2)"

Surely, buying a costume with G's only to trade it for artifacts could be seen as ""pay-to-win"" in a way, if it weren't for the fact that you'd have to trade it with another player, rather than just buying the artifact from the store with G's.

The Avengers Boosts in the store ARE tradable, but the intention is to trade them to your friends, not to trade for artifacts (which apparently can get you banned). https://forums.marvelheroes.com/discussion/199140/avengers-assemble-boosts-confusion-answers/p1  All in all it's really tough to moderate this stuff I'd imagine.

marvelheroes,3aeks0,sheriffnick,4,Fri Jun 19 14:26:02 2015 UTC,When I saw Carnage AND Agent Venom (I was hoping this would be a costume for Venom but maybe a future playable character) it was an instabuy for me. With this new Teamup system it's actually worth it to have them out and helping fight AND with the removal of retcons you can drop your points all over on teamups as you unlock new skills and actually have fun trying out diff things. I think the Teamups in this pack are gonna be A LOT of fun to run around with. Once Carnage comes out I am gonna start prestiging my venom with him. Also with what Teamups are generally costing per piece I think this is a good deal.
marvelheroes,3aeks0,Doomgrin75,2,Fri Jun 19 15:04:55 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. The new team up system really makes the personality and style of the TU matter.  It's fun to have them out with you.  They really thematically enhance the player characters and obviously enhance your gameplay.  I'm excited to see how the devs complete their proposed changes.  I think I will get this pack, but money just got a little tight haha.  I forgot to mention that Quicksilver seems really fun too.  Him teaming with Magneto or Wanda, but also Psylocke seems like a really good combo.  Its getting really confusing managing the gear for these guys to fit well with the heroes based on damage type.  Having more team ups hopefully will solve that problem."

marvelheroes,3adjig,LunarAshes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:19:29 2015 UTC,"That's probably their logic.  I think it's a bit flawed though. The previous sales were great for existing players, and probably got a bunch of players who previously hadn't paid money to be willing to throw some money in. On the other hand, as a sale just for this game, if you aren't already part of the community it's unlikely you heard about it.  The big advantage of a Steam Sale over an in-game store sale is that it's far more visible to people not yet playing. Having a deal on the front page of Steam during the Summer Sale would reach a bunch of potential new customers who never knew about the previous sale.  Obviously they have no obligation to do another sale, but it could easily make sense to do two sales so close together since one would be aimed at rewarding existing players while the other helped recruit new players."

If they run a Steam sale, Valve profits along with them and they'll have to bother with external API's to register the purchases.  It's a good thing to have various routes for people to buy stuff from, but it makes sense for them to push the most desirable ones and avoid drawing in from less attractive ones, when you are in good shape sales wise."

marvelheroes,3adjig,Kegsta,2,Fri Jun 19 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"To get the game on the steam front page during one of it's most heavily viewed times of the year would be the only reason to do it, attracting new players. Ideally Gazillion doesn't want people to play it through steam as they will lose 30% on all profits to Valve. If there is a great steam deal that current customers would want to purchase, they risk those customers permanently switching to the steam version which means -30% profit from those customers from now on. I personally still use the steam version as I got a founder pack and when the game came out the stand alone client was total shit, along with the other benefits steam brings (friends list, overlay, free data updates)"
marvelheroes,3adjig,Galyndean,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:32:09 2015 UTC,You don't need to permanently switch to Steam in order to buy the Steam packs.  You get a code from Steam that you can enter into the website that attaches the pack to your account.  No redownloading on Steam necessary.
marvelheroes,3adjig,DGLight,3,Fri Jun 19 15:03:21 2015 UTC,"There was the BOGO sale a little while ago, and I think there was a 50% off on specific costumes a few days ago? They can't always be doing sales, especially 50% off Steam ones, that would be a loss of money."
marvelheroes,3adjig,Samuraiking,3,Fri Jun 19 15:32:18 2015 UTC,"When their marketing team decides that the increased expected number of purchases will offset the decreased sale price, they will do it. That is literally the only answer, sorry. There is nothing else anyone can tell you.  The ""exclusivity"" of those packs being on Steam also increases their value and appeal, if they don't stop selling, there is no reason to put them on for sale. The whole reason to put an item on sale is too make it sale more, if that isn't a problem, you would be wasting money doing so.   With the BOGO sale a few weeks ago in-game, a sale that no one playing can miss, and the 50% off everything but x-men sale a week or two ago, there is no need for them to do anymore sales soon, even though they will. In-game sales > steam sales."
marvelheroes,3adjig,ProtonixChaos,-1,Fri Jun 19 07:31:41 2015 UTC,"Speak for yourself. For me it's way easier to get Steam Wallet. I've never bought a in-game pack (only STASH and customes), but got two packs on Steam because they were way cheaper."

marvelheroes,3adjig,ArborDaze,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:04:48 2015 UTC,I really don't think it's anywhere near as common to see the Steam sales affect things that aren't themselves games or DLC for games. I wouldn't even expect things for a free to play game to go on sale during Steams sales since most of them seem to target franchises or publisher catalogs.
marvelheroes,3adjig,dominicgetdown,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:52:06 2015 UTC,"They usually reserve any sales on MH packs in the steam store during the major end of year holidays.  They are also focusing their sales in their in-game store more than on steam.  There is a much higher presence from people just using the game client instead of using steam to launch the game, so I wouldn't think they have much of a reason to have steam sales. Also, 2015 is not over, and with Black Friday and Christmas less than a half a year away, they still have a great opportunity for the big card bundle sales.  They did have a tax return sale which was good, but this time of the year (besides steam) most games are not on sale.  Waiting for the end of the year is where most sales come from worldwide."

marvelheroes,3adjig,GreatMadWombat,7,Fri Jun 19 09:31:19 2015 UTC,"eh. At 17-20$, I'm not willing to buy a hero+their stash+g's. it's decent, but not that decent.  At 40+% off, it becomes a bargain that I'd throw money at.   They're never gonna get those specific 30$ of gaz-steam money WITHOUT a sale, but the second it happens, I'm buying all the single character steam packs.  So..we don't NEED a sale, but it'd be nice to have, and would cause me to spend more money"
marvelheroes,3adjig,Mvmt_Productions,3,Fri Jun 19 07:36:34 2015 UTC,"Ive spent lots of money and each time I have this kinda empty feeling like: Man I so overspent and its not like I didn't get what I wanted and it was my decision in which I kinda dont regret however still that feeling exists and primary since this game focuses on potion sales so after they are spent which 10 for 26 dollars I started to see for my playstyle im actually paying 25 dollars a week to stay on track.  My subscription fee was about 100 dollars a month until I finally said no more since the potions caused me to burn myself since I didn't want to ""waste them"" however I did purchase costumes and bundles for blender and stashes.  If you think about it an entire game is 20-40 dollars right now so comparing the g to dollar is expensive and really the sales makes us feel like its a bargain however is where it kinda should be in a sense if there is a spot where it ""should be"" or maybe that is just my opinion entirely."
marvelheroes,3adjig,dominicgetdown,0,Fri Jun 19 07:51:30 2015 UTC,"The in-game store has a lot of sales.  They just had 50% off heroes recently so a hero becomes less than 5$ to buy.  Only at the beginning when the game started were heroes 15-20$, but they greatly reduced the price since then."
marvelheroes,3adjig,Mvmt_Productions,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:11:18 2015 UTC,OH i know :D I spent a lot during last black friday been around since welp since 2012 pax prime the first day i played this game :D just quit and came back right before the 2015 name change.
marvelheroes,3adjig,buddhacanno2,-1,Fri Jun 19 09:16:14 2015 UTC,Steam sales have sucked for the past few years.  They're nothing but a chance for cards (ie: a free $1-2 for the market).
marvelheroes,3adjig,fader48080,2,Fri Jun 19 13:43:31 2015 UTC,I purchased black widows pack and hawkeyes pack for about 5 dollars a piece when they had a good steam sale. that came with the hero in question or in my case an upgrade token. stash tab (already more than matched the value of the pack) an extra costume (usually a 5 dollar value in itself) then a couple of extra potions and fortune cards peppered in for good measure.  so no the steam sales when they happen can be pretty awesome
marvelheroes,3adjig,ckenni,0,Fri Jun 19 11:45:31 2015 UTC,I really hate that Gaz isn't doing any steam sales.

marvelheroes,3adjig,ckenni,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:36:02 2015 UTC,"Use splinters. Its what I do and if the sale happens, I won't feel like I double paid Gs for them or their stash."
marvelheroes,3adjig,ckenni,2,Fri Jun 19 14:18:43 2015 UTC,i'm using the splinters for other characters (mostly new releases) instead of one of the characters/team-ups in this pack. Its more cost efficient for me to buy this pack on a 50% off sale since theres no chance i would want to buy the 3 team-ups using splinters or cash.
marvelheroes,3adjig,Sethatronic,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:28:58 2015 UTC,My bad. I meant for heroes. Splinters for Teamups is such a bad return on investment. Although I will spend 400 splinters for mis-priced teamups.
marvelheroes,3adjig,ckenni,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:42:00 2015 UTC,"i would consider buying SL or RR with splinters but i feel like its still better to get them (and the teamups) on a 50% sale considering the steam prices here in my country is comparable to Russian prices.  Come to think of it, thats probably one of the reasons Gaz isn't keen on steam sales since aside from profit sharing with steam, the adjusted price per country might also be affecting their sale estimates."
marvelheroes,3afgcp,fitzjack,5,Fri Jun 19 18:22:02 2015 UTC,"If you buy from Steam you get a key that you input on the official site, from there it works like normal.  Search for Marvel Heroes on Steam to see a bunch of packs that aren't in the DLC tab."
marvelheroes,3afgcp,Dirk_8,2,Fri Jun 19 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"The AoU pack is the one I really want, because Hulkbuster, the other heroes plus 1000g are just an added bonus."
marvelheroes,3afgcp,DarknessMuta,2,Fri Jun 19 19:26:27 2015 UTC,The Steam bundle is missing both Vision and Scarlet Witch but with the 1000 G you could get one of their AoU costumes if you really wanted.
marvelheroes,3afgcp,DarknessMuta,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:10:36 2015 UTC,I have SW at 60 so I may do that. I don't have Vision at all so I may purchase him or maybe buy a team up finally. I'm not sure what I'd do with the Gs yet.
marvelheroes,3afgcp,absynthe7,4,Fri Jun 19 20:19:42 2015 UTC,"You could also wait for another sale and maybe stretch that 1000 G into 2 costumes.  Also they will be giving out a free Iron Man Mark 2 team up next Thursday or Friday for Week 4 of the event with the new Armor 2.0 event.  But if you really do not know what to spend those extra Gs on, I could always use a Black Widow Age of Ultron costume to help make your decision easier."

The game doesn't have the level of detail or size of zones that would normally make a pc struggle .  Graphically its closer to 15+ year old d2 than anything in the modern crawler era.   Something is done incredibly wrong for it to struggle to run so bad on anything but $1500 + machines

Personally gave up hope its ever gonna get better as its been 2 years now and it still has huge performance issues when imo the game does not even look that pretty compared to games released around the same time.  Altho it did come a long way as when it came out most of the time it was a slide show when more then a handfull of people where onscreen."

The performance is still as bad as it ever was, and could be argumented that it has actually worsened.  I still remember when they touted ICP as a showcase of the new tech that would improve performance in the game. turns out it was actually FAR worse. It'd be hilarious, if it wasnt so damn sad.   and Gaz doesnt even blush.  Seeing that, I expect the new limbo will very likely be a total clusterfuck that will ruin everyone's mood with its dreadful performance.

marvelheroes,3adgu5,SurrealSam,9,Fri Jun 19 05:41:28 2015 UTC,"Donate pretty much everything.  Don't worry too much about crafting things until you're 60.  You can get the t2 and t4 offensive buffs but it's a lot easier to just wait until 60 so you can just break down one+ pure element for all the parts you'll need.  Really, just play the game at this point and enjoy yourself.  You can do all content minus red raid and genosha without using the crafter affixes and the enchanter for blessings, though they help.  Keep relics, keep runes, keep your hero specific uniques for later.  When Crafter hits level 18 you can trade 5 uniques of the same name for a chest worth 500,000 credits, about two of these and some odd random donations will level up your Enchanter to 20, couple more for your other vendors."
marvelheroes,3adgu5,Norwazy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:55:26 2015 UTC,"Donate pretty much everything.   Don't donate uniques.  Save those for when you can trade 5 duplicates for a credit chest.

Before you get to 60, there isn't much to worry about on the crafter, other than leveling it."
marvelheroes,3adgu5,zylli42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:54:15 2015 UTC,"Do everything in your power to level your crafter ASAP.

Nothing game changing, but it's worth doing them anyways.   Also, unless you really need the cash, it's also a good idea to convert four uniques into Relics, which is the only rational way to build full stacks of them.   Oh, and as for the little crafting materials, yeah, you can combine them if you like, you probably want at least enough to get your characters costume cores and affixes, but if your stash space is limited you can just leave them on the ground or donate them instead and wait until Pures start dropping."
marvelheroes,3adgu5,Mvmt_Productions,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:42:25 2015 UTC,Id say focus on leveling your four characters before worrying about crafting potions that are kinda a waste of time.  You should look at the top of the page and look at the new players readme lots of great info!

Keep uniques that you don't need and exchange them for the 500k chest and donate that to your crafter for fast leveling of the crafter (and enchanter).  Don't so much worry about leveling the armor/weapon guys.  What should you be crafting?  Costume affixes, re-rolling good rare artifacts, exchanging uniques for runes and/or chests, adding challenge bonuses to your best gear, upgrading your best gear from level 63 to 66 then 69.  Unbinding in some cases ify ou have a really good thing on one toon and want to use it on a different toon."

marvelheroes,3adgu5,firydragon,-1,Fri Jun 19 15:27:19 2015 UTC,only thing you will ever want to look at gear wise leveling is cosmic and uniques.  If you're playing the story line stop doing it.  At 20 start doing legendary quests.  Re-roll legendary quests if it's story quests.  Don't worry about holding onto gear for other characters unless it is 60 unique (uniques are gold).  When you level you get gear so fast it doesn't matter.  Been playing the game for 3 weeks... Loot in the beginning all the different colors and the different stuff is overload.

He was by far the most painful hero out of everyone currently in the game that I have leveled to 60.  I love archery characters in arpgs and it is a shame since he has some amazing costumes. I wanted to like him. A lot.  Hopefully he got better, I would like to go back and give him another try at some point.  How is he sitting now? Same? Due for a QoL tuneup?"

Hawkeye was the worst of the 5 free heroes (out of like 10 total heroes)  there wasn't much to do, there wasn't most of all the mechanics available now, so hawkeye was the worst hero in the worst version of the game before they revamped the entire game.  no cosmic, no uniques, no legendary, no relics, no signatures, no rings, no insignias, nothing but story, 1 group zone (the name escapes me currently), and perhaps terminals.  no prestige, no legendary quests, no pets, no team-ups."

The gear will also be used for leveling up your pet if you have one equipped.  It is also like the auto-vaporize setting under game play settings.  You use by pressing j.

marvelheroes,3acoyl,Supra93,4,Fri Jun 19 01:07:31 2015 UTC,"Psylocke - Does not play like any of the heroes you have listed(closest would be NC I guess). By far the most fun I've had with a melee hero. Great burst, lots of movement, stealth, semi ""teleport"". Can also spec for a ranged build that makes cosmic midtown/ICP trivial thanks to instant stealth+range. Ranged build is however lower damage."
marvelheroes,3acoyl,RawrGaea,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:32:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't see any melee/ranged hybrids on the list and immediately thought of Psylocke, too. I really enjoy the variety of jumping in and out of combat with brief bouts of ranged attacks.   Plus, slapping villains with butterflies is fun."
marvelheroes,3acoyl,ElectricZee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:45:20 2015 UTC,"I, too, would recommend the best hero."
marvelheroes,3acoyl,Psylocke_,3,Fri Jun 19 11:18:23 2015 UTC,Surfer - Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 movement build. The greatest leveler of all time.
marvelheroes,3acoyl,Frankthebank22,3,Fri Jun 19 01:09:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Unlocked and unplayed are Iceman, Wolverine.  Surfer has caught my eye, like a flying ranged Juggs."
marvelheroes,3acoyl,PersonaJXT,5,Fri Jun 19 01:37:14 2015 UTC,"Just to note, Surfer isn't really ranged in his movement build. He wants to be dashing through his enemies, meaning he'll be in melee range most of the time. He DOES have ranged components to his attacks, but the bulk of his damage will come from dash spam. He also has the longest teleport in the game, which allows him to make several shortcut jumps that other teleporters can't.  Strange also isn't in a good place atm, mostly because his uniques are subpar. He IS getting a unique rework soon though, so he'll probably get better. Scarlet Witch is by far the superior mental ranged character though and the utility she brings is in many ways as good as or better than Strange IMO.  Wolverine isn't in a good place atm, and I would recommend X-23 over him if you want a quick melee brawler. She has a bleed build that's close to Wolverine and a movement build that's really fluid and fun to play. A bit on the squishy side, but great DPS output.  Iceman is mainly played as a summoner these days and Doom is the superior summoner currently (really op actually and may be seeing a nerf in the future). Iceman also has very viable ranged builds that I actually prefer to play and Frozen Orb is always very fun. If you played Diablo 2 you'll know how fun that ability can be. His invulns on his sig and Ice Block also give him access to a lot of survivability on demand.  I'll also take this opportunity to point out that Hulk really isn't that tanky. On paper he should be and in terms of flavor he should be, but he's actually surprisingly squishy for being the Hulk. It probably has to do with how slow he ends up being most of the time. He does have the best burst damage in the game though and can easily squish cosmic bosses with just his sig combo.  There's also Moon Knight that has an interesting low health play mechanic. He basically deals more damage with lower health and lower spirit. He has an ability that drops his health to 1 but makes him invulnerable for a duration, which is often used in combination with his sig and play mechanics to deal out incredible amounts of damage. Sort of like Tryndamere if you play LoL.  Melee Nova is also another movement style hero that can deal incredible amounts of damage. It uses Cosmic Combo (pretty much Nightcrawler's melee bamf punch thing) with Blast Off to deal great damage. He also has incredibly fast movement speed after his dash, making him one of the fastest non-teleporters in the game. His play mechanics with him setting down pulsars and then blowing them up to trigger effects is also pretty unique.  Vision and Emma Frost have unique pet mechanics that other heroes don't have. Vision can mind control robots and Emma Frost can mind control non-robots. Emma Frost isn't in a good place atm, but she does have a very unique gimmicky build with Mental Overload that can one shot cosmic bosses with a single hit. Vision has a similar ability but it's not as powerful, though his overall package is in a better place.  Storm is the AoE queen, and she still holds that position IMO even if Scarlet Witch is pretty good at it as well. I often take my Storm and just Ziggurat all over the place in MM dropping AoE on each pack of mob I pass. It makes for a really easy way of clearing Shared Quests for those areas, and her ability to clear huge amounts of enemies with minimal fuss is unparalleled.  There's also She Hulk, Dare Devil, or Luke Cage in terms of combo point style heroes. Pretty much in order of how strong they are IMO. Basically they build up combo points then spend them on finishers for big damage. Definitely a different style of play compared to other heroes."
marvelheroes,3acoyl,petermesmer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:07:29 2015 UTC,Thank you for the write up!  Lots of food for thought.  I picked Storm (non-Avenger) as my free unlock to one day revisit.  Just not as big a fan as a hero as others in my roster.
marvelheroes,3acoyl,Frankthebank22,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:00:25 2015 UTC,"Good summary.  fyi, Emma's MO build was adjusted awhile back and no longer gets close to 1 shotting cosmics.  Made me sad, but many actually prefer the adjustment."
marvelheroes,3acoyl,PersonaJXT,0,Sun Jun 21 13:39:55 2015 UTC,"Even though the board portion of board dash deals melee, the micro beams that fire deal ranged."
marvelheroes,3acoyl,Frankthebank22,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:43:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, which is why I said that his attacks have ranged components. The melee portion though deals way more damage (high end of beams is low end of dash), which is why you want to be dash spamming through enemies rather than around them."

marvelheroes,3acoyl,smittyphi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:42:12 2015 UTC,Honestly I prefer Emma with a ranged/melee hybrid build. I still have a pet with me (gotta get that T-Rex pet) to taunt enemies but I mostly just spam my Psychic Blast and Telepathic Torment then Diamond Whirlwind and Diamond Smash when they jump on me.
marvelheroes,3acoyl,LCarpetronDookmeriot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:25:23 2015 UTC,"Punisher has a very unique ""spirit"" mechanic that is actually ammo and he is ranged and physical.  Very high burst damage with the 1-2 combo of headshot and sig.  He does not have any innate healing so you are constantly watching his health and you have to refill your ammo once it gets low."

The big problem is they had to give her a lot of stolen passives.  So they had to let her use 3 at once.  So including her own passive that's four really good passives.  If you include Ragin Cajun it's five really good passives.    That's a lot of skill points dedicated to boring passives.  It's also a  lot of raw stats.  Which means they had to nerf her powers into the ground.

marvelheroes,3abrlu,Gankstar,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:25:09 2015 UTC,I usually tip the runner with blessings depending on how long of a session it was.  I use to run when I was new because I had trouble killing bosses and it was an easy way to get a consistent grind party never expected anything because they were doing me favors killing the crap.  I do farm most everything solo now though.
marvelheroes,3abrlu,AnnieIsMyGirl,-1,Thu Jun 18 23:24:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced this works.  When you have multiple people in an instance, it scales the boss HP up.  Some have said it doubles for two people.  If it takes you 30 seconds to run to the boss and 30 seconds to kill him, adding another person means you now take 1 minute to kill him.  The runner loses more of their timer and the teleporter doesn't save any as opposed to soloing.  This is all highly dependent on how long it takes you to get to the boss and how much DPS you can do.  It might work for you if you have a lot of DPS between the two of you.  Also, ""omegas"" indicates more than one.  ""Omega's"" indicates possession of something or a contraction."
marvelheroes,3abrlu,zylli42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:37:02 2015 UTC,"Assuming equal dps between all players in the group, the boss will take less time to kill per person added to the group(the multiplier is something like 1.8, not 2). Double the time to kill could happen if you were comparing a high DPS solo run with a High DPS+low DPS duo run.  Don't take my word for it: have 2 people time their solo boss kill vrs a duo boss kill. Duo kill should be faster than the longer of the two solo runs."
marvelheroes,3abrlu,Ishakaru,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:43:53 2015 UTC,"Even at 1.8x scaling, you're not saving much time in an optimal setup.  What happens if players don't do the same DPS, as the case is almost certainly going to be in reality?  Someone's getting their timers messed up.  In addition, there is extra time thrown in typing ""TP"" to let the other player know to enter, then waiting for them to load in.  These small things add up, and I'm still not convinced using two players is more efficient.  I can see this working out well for someone with low DPS.  They could gain Omegas quicker than if they ran solo.  That's how I got started.  After your DPS is decent from better gear and a good starting point on Omegas, and you have a fast movement character who can kill fast, you're better off soloing.  Don't take my word for it.  Test it in a real boss run scenario:  Taskmaster, Hood, or Shocker are fast runs."
marvelheroes,3abrlu,zylli42,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:25:13 2015 UTC,"Why do you insist that one or more of the group HAS to be carried?  Get a group of 5 people. All with a full set of buffs. All with the same approximate single target dps. Round robin the runner, and you end up with a more efficient use of the buffs. Even on fast maps."
marvelheroes,3abrlu,Ishakaru,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:10:39 2015 UTC,"I don't insist that someone has to be carried.  The potential is there, though.  A group of five would definitely increase the efficiency, as long as everyone loads fast.  That makes the time spent running a smaller ratio of the group's time.  The fast loading is the key, though.  A lot of people play with computers that can barely handle the game, and if you're spending time waiting on one person to load, the entire group suffers.  I can see how this can work.  There are just a lot of potential issues that can also make it not work."
marvelheroes,3aeusn,Ceimash,2,Fri Jun 19 15:37:17 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is this is how I already played SW.  And because of the 10 proc limit, it makes it not particularly great.

marvelheroes,3abfpt,Hueymcduck,4,Thu Jun 18 20:53:23 2015 UTC,You just called people fools for playing one of like 47 characters in this game. Not everyone gives a fuck about being a god compared to the other characters
marvelheroes,3abfpt,asylum101,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"He's in a much better state than he was thanks to the tuning pass they just did. 20% negation, no tether on signature, improved sustain, improved stances, and SUPER A action speed."
marvelheroes,3abfpt,bingcognito,0,Fri Jun 19 13:15:15 2015 UTC,1-60 he's actually really fun.
marvelheroes,3abfpt,Halaku,3,Thu Jun 18 23:34:59 2015 UTC,Probably from when they put him and his Stash on sale.
marvelheroes,3abfpt,urbn,2,Thu Jun 18 19:59:48 2015 UTC,"Just speaking anecdotally, I rarely, if ever, see him.  I have him, but he's only at 30 and I have no plans to level him any time soon."
marvelheroes,3abfpt,avatarofshadow,7,Thu Jun 18 20:05:34 2015 UTC,But that 1% to melee damage.
marvelheroes,3abfpt,goldshock,2,Thu Jun 18 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"I like Tasky. I do.  The reason he sold so well was because he wasn't part of the advanced pack or the other group packs at the time.  So, if you wanted Taskmaster, you bought JUST Taskmaster.  It's not that more people bought him, it's just that he sold more by himself than the other heroes at the time.  Because you HAD to buy him by himself."
marvelheroes,3abfpt,Kialae,2,Thu Jun 18 23:38:53 2015 UTC,I've never seen Taskmaster and Hawkeye in the same room at the same time.
marvelheroes,3abfpt,SurrealSam,6,Thu Jun 18 19:24:09 2015 UTC,So you're suggesting they're the same person? :O

marvelheroes,3abfpt,Whack_the_mole,2,Fri Jun 19 07:07:46 2015 UTC,That makes sense.
marvelheroes,3abfpt,Icehawg,2,Fri Jun 19 07:33:41 2015 UTC,My taskmaster is lvl one. I rolled him as a random. Never even selected him. Granted a lot of that is due to lack of time. Also I kinda kept him in case one of my RL friends decide to join so I can start from lvl 1.
marvelheroes,3abfpt,smittyphi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:24:29 2015 UTC,"I managed to get my Tasky three quarters of the way to level 3 before I abandoned him to the ""after I have cosmic prestiged every other hero will I consider playing you again"" pile."

marvelheroes,3abfpt,Demtrollzz,3,Thu Jun 18 19:27:52 2015 UTC,My initial thought is Reed.  Could just be my own personal bias though; he's not fun.
marvelheroes,3abfpt,elsofer,6,Thu Jun 18 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"That's funny, hes the most fun i've had so far with a hero. Lot of burst and fun rotation imo."
marvelheroes,3abfpt,NightmareDJK,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:39:16 2015 UTC,Agreed . I leveled him to 60 and he's kinda high on my list of prestigable heroes. I liked playing him quite a bit.
marvelheroes,3abfpt,bullintheheather,3,Fri Jun 19 14:25:34 2015 UTC,Now that they removed all his animation locks he is one of the best characters in the game.
marvelheroes,3abfpt,ElectricZee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:41:08 2015 UTC,I'll have to give him another try sometime.  Got him to 60 and said eff it.

marvelheroes,3abfpt,Naurhir,2,Fri Jun 19 00:03:59 2015 UTC,I played him to 60 as my free hero.  I had a lot of fun with him.  Not enough for me to want to gear him out as one of my mains. :(
marvelheroes,3abfpt,Hellknightx,2,Fri Jun 19 00:09:40 2015 UTC,"Reed was a train wreck when he was first released, honestly.  I bitched about that a ton.  His cone AoE animation being forced to go through the whole thing before you could move was just mind-bogglingly frustrating, and some of his other mechanics were just stupidly bad at launch.  I read that the animation thing was fixed.  Maybe I'll dump a prestige into him and see how the leveling experience is again."
marvelheroes,3abfpt,Quexana,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:11:07 2015 UTC,"I liked him.  I didn't run a build dependent on cooldowns, but I did toy w/it.  I just have too many other toons at 60 that I really like playing to play him."

marvelheroes,3abfpt,urbn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:26:44 2015 UTC,Dr Strange is fairly common despite his masochistic rotation.
marvelheroes,3abfpt,ajs427,2,Fri Jun 19 17:20:54 2015 UTC,"Cable main here.  I also play a lot of Luke Cage.  So for me, the least seen hero is probably Taskmaster."

I have never seen a Johnny Storm that wasn't me (he was my starter at launch) since around launch.  I haven't seen a Taskmaster that wasn't me getting all characters to 10.  Same as taskmaster, but with Luke Cage. The one exception being Cage at launch when he was invincible in pvp.  And lastly, I have never seen a Black Panther. Maybe it's because he is Black Panther and stealthy, but...."
marvelheroes,3abfpt,neurosx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:57:53 2015 UTC,"It's hard to gauge because you'll see tons of the rarely played characters being leveled up to 50 for their synergies in hubs or low level areas.  I saw a person playing mr fantastic yesterday and was surprised that was the first time (but again this was during power leveling a character).  I would think Rocket Raccoon before Doom was released would be the least played because of the crap synergies but not sure how fun he is to play.  Also never really seen him around.  A good way to find out would be going though the build site and see how many builds exist and how many votes total the hero received taking into consideration the age of the hero (newer means most likely less builds, votes).  When comparing Scarlet witch to Rocket Racoon who were released at similar times it seems for example  SW: 60 builds, 150 votes  RR: 15 builds, 25 votes  Also Dr doom who is by far the most popular right now:  DD: 109 builds, 62 votes  Iron man always popular  IM: 63 builds, 89 votes."

The others are either 1 pointers that dont increase the bonuses, only durations. And the others are amplifiers that either increase the damage dealt or add bonuses to the other skills that they enhance.  So if you use a set of abilities.. use the ones that give bonuses with them.

CMM is end game content,  you will die a lot and get frustrated. Not only that, but you won't be able to carry your weight and frustrate the other players.  Your best bet to farm the spear is to just run the one shot. Hopefully it won't take you forever and you'll get it within a dozen or so runs, but there are achievements for his one shot that will guarantee he drops his necklace and spear and pelt. It's worth doing either way.  You can run it solo, or you can farm reg midtown and then stay in the LFG channel and just wait for someone to spam they're at ape and join their term.

marvelheroes,3aaczz,BEALLOJO,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:15:01 2015 UTC,Finding virgins in 2015 is such a hassle. Vestal virgins are pretty much out of the question.
marvelheroes,3aaczz,dr_essex,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:11:35 2015 UTC,"Farm cosmic midtown.  Its a numbers game.  More times you kill him, the more likely it will drop.    I also wouldn't rely on the boxes from the ARMOR vendor.  It can't hurt and you COULD get it, but like all things regarding rares drops in this game, RNGesus is a fickle master."
marvelheroes,3aaczz,zylli42,2,Thu Jun 18 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"More times you kill him, the more likely it will drop.   Statistically speaking, this isn't true.  Each time has a very small chance to drop the item, but no previous event influences the outcome of future events.  Given the extremely small chance of a drop (estimated at 1 in 1000) there is a very good chance you could kill him 1000 times and not see a drop."
marvelheroes,3aaczz,BurnedOut_ITGuy,2,Thu Jun 18 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"I confess that I have a hard time wrapping my head around this concept.  All the statistics experts say you're right though.  To me if you have run the content once and I have run it 1000 times, which one of us is more likely to have a spear? (Take the achievement out of it for this scenario.)"
marvelheroes,3aaczz,MechaMouse,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"Well it's true that if you try 1000x times, then you are 1000x more likely to get it than someone who tries once. However, if each of you try one more time the odds are equal regardless if it's your 1st or 1001st try."
marvelheroes,3aaczz,zylli42,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"To me if you have run the content once and I have run it 1000 times, which one of us is more likely to have a spear?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution  (I think I got the math right below but it has been a while since I took statistics.)  The simple formula is something like 1 - p-not ^ n, where p-not is the probability of it not occurring in decimal form, and n is the number of attempts.  If the probability is 1 in 1000 and you attempt it 1000 times, your odds of it happening at least once are 1 - .999 ^ 1000 = 63.2%.  It is important to understand that each attempt still has a 1 in 1000 chance of happening, and we don't actually know the drop rate - 1 in 1000 is just a guess.  Even if you run it 1000 times, there is still a 36.8% chance that you won't get a drop."

Punisher also had the ammo-spender accidental buff at the end of April, so it was in place for a bit.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's frustrating when ""good bugs"" get fixed when there are ""bad bugs"" that haven't been, but we don't need to pretend that this is a matter of prioritization by the dev team."

Not really sure on that though."

Currently suprised at how much I am enjoying running with spiderwoman (has a taunt, decent damage).  Deadpool kid isn't very efficient, as he shoots people with his ranged attack before starting his high-damage pbaoe.  He normally isn't in range, nor where you want him to be, but the damage on his little kamikaze act is insane, and is fun to use when just clearing trash, or to liven up boring grinds."
marvelheroes,3a9jc5,Naurhir,2,Fri Jun 19 07:49:41 2015 UTC,Magik is equally good in active or passive mode for Summoners and is good in active mode for everyone.  Clea in active mode is excellent. Does damage and buffs/heals you.  Wolverine in active mode is outstanding.  Lots of good choices.

Considering there really aren't many other any-hero options for that slot. Lots of heroes either don't have updated uniques so their slot 4 sucks, or have a slot 4 that is helpful to one build and not another. I don't get how you say they're not anywhere near BiS when tons of builds have them BiS."

My problem with this particular piece of gear is I regularly go around on hour in ICP without a SINGLE appearance of the clone saga event. I'd much rather farm Liz Formulas or Hulkbuster packages for trade instead of hoping for the random chance to even see the clone, to then have a random chance at the artifact."

It's still daunting to me as someone with over 200 hours of play time under my belt.   As others said, that line is referring to the fact that to do the most difficult content takes a lot more than being ""max level."" That being said, the vast majority of the game is not the most difficult endgame content. In fact, for many people (like myself) most of the game involves leveling one character to 60, playing with them a little bit at 60 and then starting the process over with a new hero. In which case, leveling to 60 (while being only 1/3 of the path to making a completely end-game viable character) can be the majority of the game.  The best part about this game is how many different ways there are to have fun with it. The one that is the most fun for you is the right one. :)  *Edited for clarity."

marvelheroes,3a6djt,jasiones,2,Wed Jun 17 17:45:49 2015 UTC,"Captain America is in a really good place, but after a while, you will likely want to make alts (level faster, synergies (stat buffs)).  Some heroes aren't in that great of shape right now, due to how they have traditionally handled reviewing and buffing (not often enough).  I would suggest checking this post to see who currently isn't in the best shape, versus who are: https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelheroes/comments/3a4045/amthuas_list_for_future_unique_updates_green_ok/  As a non min-maxer, you are suggested to play whoever you want, but that list may make your life easier.  Also, something not listed in the newbie guide at the top of the subreddit is that a lot of builds can be found at this site, and contain tabs showing you complicated things you may not fully understand yet (omegas, synergies, team-ups, etc.).  http://marvelheroes.info/builds/#0-25-4-1  Find a highly rated build there, and follow the parts you dont understand for a bit, until you have a chance to learn them, then branch out, or not, depending on your own playstyle."

marvelheroes,3a6djt,marvell71sg,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:45:13 2015 UTC,"There is a setting in gameplay options that will allow you to set a threshold for loot vacuuming and loot drops. I would recommend setting it off the bat to auto destroy grey items as they're entirely useless. You can also set it to auto pick up med kits and credits which you should do.   There are two schools of thought on vacuuming items as a new player. You will eventually need to level your crafter and enchanter and you do this by donating items. You can do this by saving up all those greens and blues and purples you won't use and donating them or by waiting until you get to a higher level and using some high value items to do it quickly. Method 1 gets tiring, so I reccomend donating items until your crafter has a few levels and basic recipes then holding off until higher level to max it quickly.   On a related note, don't worry too much about picking up particles and crunching them in the crafter. They just serve to slow you down and take up space. At level 60 the highest tier particles are easily obtained and can be broken down for your crafting."

Played him for a bit and really just can't get used to his shield synergy. It was just soooo slow.   So I played the big boys up to level 10. Colossus, Thing, Hulk and Jug. I wanted a hero that would just run round and smash shit. Ended up using my free Hero to get Jug... and he's awesome. Getting a tad sick of Lariat though so I may change my build up.  Luckily i've got a few Eternity Splinters over the last few days... I'm close to 500. It's tempting to get another hero but I might sit on them till I get Cap and/or Jug up to level 60. So that being said, does anyone have advice for a leveling build for Cap that isn't so... stop/start ?"
marvelheroes,3a6djt,IrmatDen,2,Wed Jun 17 21:07:18 2015 UTC,By stop/start do you mean you are having spirit issues? Also i would probably just get random boxes until you have ~%50 of the cast.
marvelheroes,3a6djt,RJM618,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:17:23 2015 UTC,I think it's my penchant for using shield bounce. Its a great skill but it locks him out of a lot of his shield skills. I'm looking on the forums at the moment for some starter build guides. I just want him to flow better :)
marvelheroes,3a6djt,mvmtproductions,2,Wed Jun 17 21:20:05 2015 UTC,"The 2nd day login bonus is 400 Eternity Splinters, so you've probably only acquired around 100. This is a one-time bonus to help new players get another hero (or two from random boxes).  I just wanted to caution you so you don't think it's normal to get 500 Splinters in that short amount of time!  Like others have mentioned, it's probably best to just buy the random boxes at the start of the game. You have few heroes unlocked, so the chance of getting a duplicate is pretty low. You may not get exactly who you want, but it could encourage you to try someone you wouldn't normally use. At 175 Splinters, is a bargain!"

marvelheroes,3a5gid,FenrirIII,9,Wed Jun 17 13:30:41 2015 UTC,You can reset the room by swapping heroes.  I did it in chapter 7 brewhouse which has 2 chests. Swap heroes outside the the room to reset and go back in. I was getting about 8 per minute so it was still a little over 10 hours total for 5000 chests.

The second build is much the same as my own but I put a lot of points into Psionic Resilience and only a couple into Psionic Vortex.  There is the full mental option but I haven't tried it yet.  You can use Psylocke's own uniques, they work very well. I see a lot of people using Nate Grey's and then complaining she's squishy, losing 2k+ health will do that."

Of course shes a tank in regular midtown, everyones a tank in regular midtown, but take her into cosmic midtown and her squishy side really shows.

These latest rounds of uniques are deeded to make them all viable, but look at the feedback!  The uniques are all being requested (and designed) to fit very specific builds and thus pigeon holing every character into the one, maybe two builds, out there.  Before long, they might as well get rid of the spec trees all together and go the WoW route and give you only one or two options per character.  Back to the point, I would like to see cosmics remain viable to fill holes we want, and provide those things like Bulwark instead of some of the gimmicks we see on these uniques."

marvelheroes,3a4045,UltraJesus,2,Wed Jun 17 03:26:04 2015 UTC,My biggest problem with uniques are the +ranks. That's the best part and the worst part about uniques. Having a unique with multiple ranks that go from like 1-6 and having like 3 of them means every 1:216 drops will be 'usable' by most. Is it bad? I have extremely mixed feelings due to the range of possibilities uniques have. There has to be a defined line where the number of possibilities is good and absurd.
marvelheroes,3a4045,HuggableBear,7,Wed Jun 17 04:15:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when an item gives you +3 all skills and then another +6 to your primary damage skill, there is no other option there.  You're just fishing for a good roll on that one item.  It's not even as if there are other viable choices that might work with other skill builds.  You take the item that gives you 9 extra skill levels, period."

What bugs me is they even bother putting challenge bonus drops in the game.  There's no way in hell I'm going to waste molecules trying to make a challenge bonus worth equipping.   They need to let us exchange 3-5 challenge bonus uniques for tokens or something.
marvelheroes,3a4045,UltraJesus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:46:45 2015 UTC,"But obtaining a challenge bonus for what you want is easy. Do raids/dailies and you got 8 per week. Also UM? What? Did you mean the challenge tokens?    These two are entirely different levels of obtainment. I'm not complaining about obtaining a unique. Sure I've obtained a few thousand uniques since achievements started, but you know how many of them have been perfect rolls to ranks on an Uru shield(4 +5 ranks or 625 combinations)? 0. You know how many I've seen since Cap's rework? 1. Though that unique is a bit misleading since nobody cares about shield toss, but it's the first unique comes to mind. ""Dropping like candy"" doesn't mean much even if you get a couple thousand uniques a month with odds like that."
marvelheroes,3a4045,dorn3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:50:36 2015 UTC,I don't know where you got the UM from.  I don't see UM in my post.    Using commendations for challenge tokens is painful.  I need to buy the boss uniques several times.  It will take half a year just to get a reasonable amount of them.
marvelheroes,3a4045,UltraJesus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:11:47 2015 UTC,"You said molecules and there is only two items with that word in it so I assumed ""Unstable Molecule"" and using commendations is hardly painful in comparison and a half year isn't true at all. It's more like 6 weeks for green then you can move onto buying uniques/challenge tokens. That's time vs actual grinding of pure luck of rolling against the odds. This does get thrown out the window when you try to gear out the entire roster.. which is unreasonable anyhow."
marvelheroes,3a4045,dorn3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:24:20 2015 UTC,Ahh yea I forgot they were unstable.  I might reroll challenge bonus uniques if it was only one but two is harsh.  What do you mean though?  I need about 15-20 Fragments of Twilight and a few other ones.  By the time I finish with that they'll have the axis uniques up.  With the weekly caps it's going to be half a year just for all of those.

marvelheroes,3a4045,Hybridaction,3,Wed Jun 17 04:52:53 2015 UTC,"Gambit's slot 4 is just bad. His slots 2 and 3 are decent, but could be much better. He had his uniques reworked back about 9 months ago and has better uniques than some of the heroes listed here, but it's about time he got another rework.   Gambit also needs a new signature. Look at his forum and all you see are threads talking about how his sig is a death trap (which it is) and has way too long of a cooldown. It needs to be reworked or replaced. I think his ult should be his sig (on a 30-40 second cooldown) and he should get a new ult; like him turning into the New Sun and blowing the whole screen up with 25m+ bruts."

So if you have a +3 all, you'll still have a +3 all. But the new +6-11 to ""Insert Skill Name Here"" will be 6-11.

Her slot 3, can roll as low as 598 HP at ilvl 69.

marvelheroes,3a72pl,llleTownlll,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"Played him extensively before the big nerf, his survivability was alright, enough for CMM / CICP and Red Raids if you know what you are doing there.  The Team up 2.0 patch nerfed his survivability and the outrageous bruts to a point where I'd say you lose about 25% of your ability to take damage. The dps nerf isn't really a big thing, it only disallows players to have 15 second TTK's on him because they landed an insane Brut twice on the Dummy.  Which leaves Punisher as an absolute top tier DPS dealer, but you'll now have to be far more carefull playing him, which severely limits your ability to put out said damage. Playing Scarlet or Cap will leave you with equally high dps while being far more relaxed to play. Playstyle preference is what it comes down to. I've moved to another main..."
marvelheroes,3a72pl,Uniqron,0,Fri Jun 19 13:53:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the responses - he did seem strong. I always assumed he was bottom tier. I may work on gearing him up next while researching builds and ideas.

marvelheroes,3a6boi,JulienMaille,2,Wed Jun 17 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"50/50. Even with a nerf he will be good unless they really beat him to death which I do not see happening. SW is the ""big thing"" to rate by right now and I kill just as fast as the people I see on SW. Honestly Cosmic Term Bosses Die in seconds and today I killed a Boss Pack in CMM before other people could get to it. My Doom not the best but gets me plenty of gear"

marvelheroes,3a6boi,Andromansis,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:25:51 2015 UTC,Ya it rolls higher summons damage than Regalia and I'm still trying to get a UEB from Ultron but he doesn't wanna drop it. Which rolls 35% so I'd replace the Regalia which only rolls 28%.

marvelheroes,3a6boi,Yakobo15,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:36:27 2015 UTC,I have played all three trees of Doom in CMM and Summoner is pretty much easy mode for me. I might enjoy sorcery a bit more but he is an unbelievable summoner. Of course everyone else would have to chime in on how that translates to endgame stuff.

marvelheroes,3a6boi,Naurhir,2,Wed Jun 17 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"Step 1.  Get 4 characters to 60.    Once you've done that, whoever you like better.  Rogue is versatile enough that you can do some REALLY effective min/maxing.    You said you LOVE doom, which means you must be Latverian, which means there is only Doom."
marvelheroes,3a6boi,JulienMaille,0,Wed Jun 17 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"Doom - Overpowered as fuck. Just like most hyped up newly released hero (Gaz loves releasing overpowered heroes in order to sell boatloads of them), he's stupid OP. All 3 of his skill trees and specs are viable and extremely powerful. He has a spammable teleport which makes a big difference. The only hero that's better than Doom right now is Scarlet Witch. Make Doom your main if you want to easymode this game, especially with his summon build.  Deadpool - Garbage. He's going to get his review in the next 2 months, so he may end up overpowered again like he used to be so long ago. Don't recommend making him your main right now.  Rogue - Very versatile. You can play her in many different ways. Gaz's most ambitious hero and arguably, the most ambitious character design of any ARPG. She constantly has new skills and builds to play with and try out, with each new hero and team-up released. Good choice of main.  Spidey - Great melee hero. He has amazing survivability and good damage. He's not overpowered but can hold his own in the damage department now, with his QoL and uniques rework. If Gaz decides to increase the damage of his sig and ult, he would be top tier. Still, you can do all content with him, including Sentinels / AXIS.   Hulk - Super burst damage hero. I personally don't like Hulk anymore (ironically loved him before his review) and I consider him squishy compared to the other top tier melee heroes. You can play him ranged to survive better but to me, he's supposed to be a melee hero and smash things, tank things, and just own everything. Right now, he just jumps around constantly and then bursts. If you like Hulk though, go with him. A lot of people have him as their main because they love seeing huge bruts on their screen.  Cap - Arguably the most overpowerd and easy to play melee hero now that Venom got owned by nerfs. Constant 3-14m+ bruts and is very tanky. Best main for people who just like to smash their keyboard around and do crazy damage.   Gambit - My personal main and favorite Marvel character since I was a kid. He requires tons of great / BiS gear to be good though. But once you build him, gear him, and play him correctly, he can be upper mid tier in terms of damage. His sig needs to be reworked and/or replaced, and maybe have his damage increased a bit to become truly top tier, but otherwise, he's a solid choice to make your main if you love how he plays or if you just love Gambit like you said. I do all content in this game just fine with him. You can play him both as a melee/hybrid or ranged/energy hero. Shameless plug to my Gambit build that includes videos of me soloing CMM before he got his damage reduction buff and a video of 36s TTK: http://marvelheroes.info/build/19568/  Ghost Rider - I haven't gotten him to 60 yet but have heard he's great for end-game content. One of the hidden gems that go unnoticed with how powerful he can be if geared / played well. GR fans hopes that he stays off the radar and remains super powerful without nerfs.  2 other top tier, overpowered heroes worth mentioning are Scarlet Witch (I mentioned her up top) and Iceman. My 2nd main is Iceman and I suppose my 3rd main is Scarlet Witch. Both are ridiculous heroes, even after they've been nerfed. They make most content in this game trivial and easymode. I love them but gotta admit that they're still the best heroes in this game, along with Doom."
marvelheroes,3a6boi,JulienMaille,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"Love releasing overpowered?  You mean like WS/She-Hulk/Vision?  And people really don't like spidey in axis, his sig makes Onslaught a headache"

marvelheroes,3a6boi,dietrich666,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. Just so I am clear, you want a doom build right? I will assume so. Alurez gives a good summoner build and goes into detail here:    Summoner    I personally run a hybrid and have a ton of luck but I switch things out a lot. As far as alternative cheap artifacts, you can usually get away with Advanced Crimson Crystal of Cyttorak. Advanced Metasensory Array, and something like Yukio's Charm. All of those have dropped for me at a fairly decent rate lately. They are no substitues for GotK or HoD depending on the character, but my Doom is fine in CMM with them. Of course Costume Cores and Omegas are also key."
marvelheroes,3a6boi,MK43,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's the one I'm using. Are Doom's own unique viable for slots 1-3?"
marvelheroes,3a6boi,dorn3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:59:18 2015 UTC,I have seen a lot of builds where they are BiS so I would think so.

marvelheroes,3a6boi,PraxusGaming,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:09:52 2015 UTC,Yep. Horn is best for summoners etc. Seems like they made uniques that would work for various play styles.
marvelheroes,3a6boi,PessimiStick,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"I've played with everyone at end game level and these assessments are pretty spot on. Gear and omega points go a very long way to boost effectiveness of any of these that people might feel iffy about too so keep that in mind.   My goto for main is Hulk. He's simple, tough, and has a lot of dps to dish out. The only downside is that he can get boring because it is easy mode to play with him at all of the highest level of end game content.  I alt back and forth between Psylocke and Scarlet Witch now and they are really fun. Both of them can crank out some serious dps, but they are pretty unique in comparison.  Psylocke is fun because she does great in melee mode but also can be really easy to kite with so she doesn't have to utilize builds that would require much focus on defense. She was the big surprise character in terms of my expectations and the reality of how fun she is to play with. No other character surprised me more.  Scarlet Witch is great too. She was my starter hero at launch but she needed a lot of work to be anyone I could enjoy so I switched over to Hulk as my main. After her review, I'd say she's the character they have got the most right on. She's that heavy dps status effect spell caster type that has always been a favorite build style for OG gamers like myself. Plus, she's also exactly what you should expect of a game play version of her character.  With even just some of the right gear and very few omega points, each of these three can handle the most challenging of end game content.  I want to get my Jean Grey working well again but she's just not the same after her review."
marvelheroes,3a6boi,BEALLOJO,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:40:58 2015 UTC,I love Psy. Her movement power is one of my favorites. SW is maybe the only character even I can play without hardly looking at the screen.     I am sitting at ~3k omegas so I need to work on that ASAP.
marvelheroes,3a6boi,dorn3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"About 3k omegas is plenty for Psi or Hulk to hit all the high notes for end game content. It's just spreading it around to be effective.   SW needs a good bit more tho. I have about 5 k and I'm just now able to get close to what I want out of it.  Gear def helps too. I have just about r everything I need. I have all the right uniques slotted for them other then 1 twilight fragment for SW. Only 1 slot is not up to 69 for those and all have challenge bonuses. I have the lvl 80 legs maxed, 1k stack of relics, the right uru/runewords, all but one of the best artifacts and all blessed. I also have the right cosmic medallions and almost the perfect cosmic insignia's but only at item level 63. Other then that, I just need to get the right rolls on the perfect cores.  All of this just takes time and patience for the rng gods to bless you bless you for while you farm omegas."

Hybrid characters often use Power Doop runeword.  You will want all of your main characters to have their insignias upgraded to cosmic for the +1 to all skills bonus.     I would hold off on the Doop Ectoplasm until you get a good roll on the vendor.  You can refresh once per day.  It is mostly useful on heroes that do both Energy and Mental damage.  The physical proc on it is dodge, and most consider dodge relatively worthless.  Aside from Doom and Rogue, I'm not sure if any other heroes can do energy and mental in normal play.  I don't know about Jean Grey's playstyle; I think she switches between the two, but not as part of her combat rotation.  I could be wrong..."
marvelheroes,3a5zhi,zylli42,6,Wed Jun 17 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"'m not sure if any other heroes can do energy and mental in normal play.   Cable, baby."
marvelheroes,3a5zhi,tacos,4,Wed Jun 17 15:03:44 2015 UTC,"Have you bought anything from there yet?   If not you should get the upgrade insignia to cosmic recipe.   Then you should get doop runeword, and if you play summoners get the summoner doop runeword as well.  Then you should buy the power cosmic for each hybrid hero you wish to gear out as it's superior to level70 legendaries (but worse than level80).  Then you need 1 doop rune (500 CW) per each upgrade of insignia you wanna do, and for each doop runeword you wanna apply. You also need 1 cosmic upgrade token for this as well (100 CW).  If you know you need all this, but you're wondering what is most important: I don't know ;).  It depends on what you do? Do you play hybrid heroes and can't afford 1000 odin mark legendaries? Get power cosmics asap. Do you play summoners? Get the summoner runeword first. Do you play hybrid heroes and want the best runeword? Get the recipe for rune doopword after the power cosmic. You almost always want to upgrade your insig to cosmic if you have a great one. So get that recipe + upgrade tokens. And you'll always need doop runes, so get those."
marvelheroes,3a5zhi,bigbadVuk,2,Wed Jun 17 17:32:51 2015 UTC,thanks for this.  i already have the Power Cosmic on Doom but have been thinking of prestiging and re-specing him to a summoner since i got rogue as my free hero last week. she'll get the power cosmic and then i can start making use of the CWs.
marvelheroes,3a5zhi,bigbadVuk,2,Wed Jun 17 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"So then you'll need the summoner runeword :) Also, heroes that do 2 types of damage, they also benefit more from power cosmic than from l70 legendaries. And there are quite a few 2 damage type hybrids out there who could use a PC legendary.  edit: In case you don't know, when you put a legendary on a new hero it resets all the XP, so it's not very beneficial to just have 1 PC that you plan on swapping in between heroes!"

marvelheroes,3a5zhi,droid327,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:01:56 2015 UTC,"Doop portal is good for credits and pure elements. The doops can drop a doop rune but it's veryyyyy rare.  It's a bit hard to do it solo, as the doops do a lot of damage, so I'd go in with a group.  But get this (!): 1 portal is 42 stones, in one portal there are many small doops and 7 cosmic doops per. If you kill 100 small = achievement = 1 doop rune as reward. If you kill 100 cosmic doops = achievement = 5 doop runes as reward.  So do it... 15 times (15*42 stones = 630 stones) and get 6 doop runes, vs getting 1 for 500 stones. This can only be done once though, and you gotta run the portal 15 times."
marvelheroes,3a5zhi,zylli42,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"You really need to stack credit find to make credits worthwhile.  Each doop will drop several piles, but the base amount for each pile is like 20.  So your credit find will get multiplied by thousands...my Rogue with ~200+ gets about 600k per clear not counting the bosses."

marvelheroes,3a4yyx,Advacar,4,Wed Jun 17 10:53:57 2015 UTC,Most heroes burn through their resource crazy fast in the early levels. A magneto medallion(drops from magneto) and/or an uru forged with a river of the soul rune word will help considerably
marvelheroes,3a4yyx,asylum101,7,Wed Jun 17 12:14:48 2015 UTC,Keep in mind he's a newbie at level 20. I wouldn't have understood half those words when I first started (a few weeks ago)  /u/Fangqaz: Just keep playing. As you go you'll find better and better items that'll help. Don't worry about looking up guides on ideal loadouts until you hit 60 or so. This game is dense and it'll make a lot more sense if you figure out most of it yourself.

marvelheroes,3a4yyx,BEALLOJO,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:44:35 2015 UTC,"during a ramp up phase it's probably easy to spend that much.   Especially before the free hero roster expanded to let you play everyone to 10.  Before if there was a guy you liked and he wasn't daredevil,thing, storm, or (i forget who the other 2 were),  you had to buy them.   So that's between 10-15(20 at launch for some), gone. Then inventory spots are $5 each.  Character specifics were 3.50  Do that combo for 2-3 heroes  a month and you're definitely in the ballpark of 60 while you're building your roster.    On top of that if a particular guy sticks to you,you usually spring for a costume for him.  If you're still playing at the 3 month mark and going strong, i think though your mind should start going toward the value packs rather than continuing at that rate.  whether it be the advance packs or villain combos or whatever.  You want to be getting things in bulk at reduced rates rather than individual things."

marvelheroes,3a4yyx,califexe,4,Wed Jun 17 07:15:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, I forgot about that page- I suppose you do have to select a starting hero- I don't know if you need to uncap it the moment you pick it, but after you'll be able to play all heroes up to level 10 before deciding whether you want them.  Don't worry though, on your second day of logging in you'll get 400 Eternity Splinters you can use to buy Jean Grey with! I don't know if it's too late, but you might get a free Hero Token this week for another free hero!"
marvelheroes,3a4yyx,tarrach,3,Wed Jun 17 07:19:57 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, thanks! I'm a big Phoenix fan so I wanted to main her but was hoping to not put money in this game too soon until I decide whether I like it or not."
marvelheroes,3a4yyx,Dukayn,2,Wed Jun 17 07:20:56 2015 UTC,"Don't worry- just keep playing (don't forget the patrol terminals once you feel confident enough) and you'll see Eternity Splinters drop pretty often, at least enough for a new hero every other week for playing lightly.  Once you get the heroes you want, try to get Random Hero Boxes for only 175 splinters!"
marvelheroes,3a4yyx,izzadi,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:23:59 2015 UTC,You'd have to play at least 2 hours per day to be able to get a hero (or the chance of a hero from random box) every two weeks. Not what I'd call lightly...
marvelheroes,3a4yyx,Trunksshe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:56:33 2015 UTC,Really?   I tend to earn a fair bit of splinters everyday from playing about an hour a day.
marvelheroes,3a6dx1,Monarki,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:12:58 2015 UTC,Yes you would need to re download the entire game through steam. But the trade off is that you get practically instant updates (barring a few minute lag time on big patches and the (very rare) hiccup) and better download times and faster install rates.
marvelheroes,3a6dx1,dkphxcyke,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:02:12 2015 UTC,"If you switch over to steam it's going to download everything you need at once, I believe it currently sits between 13-15 gigs. Once the download is done on Steam you're good to go."

marvelheroes,3a2ci1,JayPag,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:20:10 2015 UTC,The Axis raid uniques (I don't know how many) should also be saved.

marvelheroes,3a2ci1,Uniqron,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:28:08 2015 UTC,"Doctor Doom Medallion, Bullseye Medallion, Skull Medallion, Madame Hydra medallion and a Man ape medallion just in case you want to play a summoner."
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,LuminalOrb,0,Wed Jun 17 02:21:40 2015 UTC,Is that really it as far as medallions these days?
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,brouski,0,Wed Jun 17 14:08:32 2015 UTC,"More or less yeah. Most heroes use a Doctor Doom medallion then those who aren't using it are either using Skull/Grim Reaper because they are brut heroes who do big numbers, Bullseye because they benefit a lot from the raw crit, using Man ape because they are summoners or you use Madame Hydra for the axis raid sentinel fight. That's it unfortunately, the pursuit of crit and brut as well as power duration has eclipsed out most of the other medallions from being very useful."
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,LuminalOrb,0,Tue Jun 16 22:53:01 2015 UTC,Are you referring to the purple/rare medallions or just cosmics? I thought all cosmics were worth holding on to?
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,twinsofterror,0,Wed Jun 17 16:08:22 2015 UTC,Cosmics. No purples are even worth holding on to imo because getting them is as easy as breathing air these days. The problem right now is that Brut/Crit and power duration are the kings of doing anything damage wise in MH so medallions without those (a lot of them) are more or less useless until we get a change to how damage works in game.
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,LuminalOrb,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. As a pretty casual player who saves one of every artifact JUST IN CASE, every rune, etc, this is a god send since there isn't exactly an Arreat Summit for this game."

marvelheroes,3a2ci1,brouski,0,Wed Jun 17 13:13:12 2015 UTC,"Nice work on this, though Hand of Nimrod isn't common artifact, it only drops in Midtown, so unless you play Midtown excessively, you won't see this arti that much. I have more Hands of Doom than Nimrods and I save both, so it says much. It's worth saving no mater the roll, because it's basically poor man's Zola for ranged characters - it helps much with spirit issues without damping the damage that much."

marvelheroes,3a2ci1,twinsofterror,-4,Wed Jun 17 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of misinformation in those pictures. I applaud the effort, but please allow me to correct a few things:  Remove the following items:   White suit jacket (used to be good for melees...about a year ago, not now though) Bi-Level concussion proj (useless item) Sanjaku (useless item) Ruby Top Cane (at most save 1 for the recipe, but honestly even then it's still a waste)   For the costume cores:   Junk everything if it doesn't have at least invuln on it. Ideally invuln + medkit + anything else you are looking for. +1 fight, +1 int, +health, +spirit, and lastly LOH of course for the trifecta.   For the second pic:   Adv crystal - only semi useful now. Used to be BIS for melee heroes, but honestly better options now. Adv phoenix - useless item Adv. Aim robot - only useful if you have nothing better Adv Regalia - only useful if you have nothing better (ultron mode basically killed this item with the introduction of the beam and the sheath)   Cheers."
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,ejester,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:50:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that there could have been some tiering in how usefull stuff is, but a few of the ones you mention as useless are pretty decent?  How i the Adv Phoenix with a Res & 500 energy dmg useless? Essence of Dread is about the same for Mental... The Headband from MODOK is also about the same, just adding +2 energy and some crit.  Some of the items are indeed killed by newer better alternatives, reducing the value of the older previous BiS items, but that doesn't mean you should save a few of the old ones till you have a decent supply of the new stuff to replace it with. My alts rock a bunch of those items you just mentioned and are doing fine in cosmic content with them."
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,Uniqron,-1,Wed Jun 17 23:25:47 2015 UTC,"They are useless because there is stuff that is soooooooo much better.  If there was nothing else to use BUT those items. Sure, but that is not the case."
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,ejester,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:31:16 2015 UTC,People playing lots of characters might not be rolling in top-level artifacts for all of them. I'm not going to go balls out farming or trading for heroes that aren't my main.
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,brouski,-2,Wed Jun 17 14:14:40 2015 UTC,"If you aren't playing them, why do they even need gear? In theory, you only need 1 of everything, since you can only play one hero at any given time.  hoarding semi-useless artifacts for heroes that you may or may not play at some point in the future is not a justifiable reason for saying if a item is good or bad.  The vast majority of heroes on most peoples rosters are leveled to 50-60 and then left there to rot.  Most people have a very small handful of heroes they play on a regular basis and everyone else is left by the wayside.  I've been playing for a very very long time. i assure you, I know what I'm talking about.  I mean, it's your money. If you wish to purchase every available stash space in the game and fill them with nonsensical items on the off chance that maybe, at some point, you'll level an alt and they maybe might need that item ... who am I to tell you no?  All I am saying is that it's not necessary to do so. By playing on a regular basis you will find more then enough to kit your favorites out, either by your own drops, or via trading and anything that is only kinda ""meh"" will quickly get replaced by the next new shiny that gets released (which basically happens on a monthly basis).  I mean at the end of the day, this is supposed to be about saving space correct? All I'm trying to help you do."

An Adv phoenix is useless for people who sit on 50 boss specific artifacts, but it's a viable alternative for a energy char that just hit 60.  I was originally going to add Xerogen Crystal, Agamotto and Kung Fu, stuff that's semi-useful for fresh 60s, but gave up halfway and scrapped it."
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,ejester,-2,Wed Jun 17 17:15:25 2015 UTC,"I assure you, I did not miss the part where you said you made it for a friend. However, you publicly posted it and shared it for the world to use.  As such, I felt it needed to be tweaked. If it was only for your friends eyes, then it wouldn't matter what was on the pics, because only your friend and yourself would ever see it.  This is not the case here is it?  You are trying to appeal to a wider audience and as such, the information should be as accurate as possible.  All I am saying."
marvelheroes,3a2ci1,twinsofterror,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:32:01 2015 UTC,"Your contribution isn't very helpful. Not everyone has the time or inclination to play long enough to farm the super rare BiS pieces.

Also, the iron man teamup achievement requires the teamup, but the reward is the teamup. So if thats the case, we will need to enlist the help of Cable, to go into a future where we have that teamup, and bring back that team up to the present, so we can then perform the event that brought that teamup from the future into existance. Maybe I should have had Doc Brown explain that :p  Honestly though, I just dont want any more groot stuff for a while.... its like beating a dead horse at this point.

I bet a hover pot would be what they do with Baby Groot."
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,holderup,2,Wed Jun 17 00:11:17 2015 UTC,Could give him his hover chair from the 90s cartoon.
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,RufusPFunkerdale,2,Wed Jun 17 09:10:08 2015 UTC,Also in the comics before the cartoon.

How long until we have Groot playable?  A walking forest of pain.    Having Iron Man as a team-up doesn't sound too bad, I guess.  I'll have to see his skills, but I only have one team-up as it is, so it'll be some variety and that's always cool."
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,doomsdayforte,3,Wed Jun 17 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, I know I said earlier I wouldn't want a Groot pet, but ""potted Groot"" sounds rather intriguing.  I will totally be running around on Rocket with Groot, xmas Groot, and potted Groot just for the lolfactor.  Ironman Mark II team up sounds pretty cool though."
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,ProfJackAss,3,Wed Jun 17 00:02:17 2015 UTC,Excited for Potted Groot. Not overly thrilled with an IM team-up but don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

marvelheroes,3a3lqu,euk_,5,Wed Jun 17 19:24:38 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the achievement aspect is only a placeholder.   Cause it would be useless to earn a team-up you already have.
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,MHDarkBeast,5,Tue Jun 16 23:56:29 2015 UTC,Misspelling. It's actually Irony Man.
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,TheScarlettHarlot,5,Tue Jun 16 23:58:57 2015 UTC,"I would be quite disappointed honestly..  I'm just not a fan of either character. Esp with how much both chars are already present in the game..  I was hoping for something special and unique to actually give this anniversary some anniversary factor where there really hasn't been any whatsoever... not something rehashed and thrown together(like the rest of the anniversary has been in general)..  I love this game and gaz, but its like their PR department all quit over the past year.. no event planning.. not much thought into the events etc..  Also, I got super excited at the thought of Cosmo.. :/   It would have to have some broken OP skills to ever get any use compared to my Magik and Domino.. even then, that drab gray suit is just ugly.. Its free though, so I'll take whatever.. Just saying IMO, there could be much better choices.. hell, even a birthday themed ironman wearing a party hat or something would be nice... there is just literally nothing special or unique about any of this.. probably cut and pasted animations from iron man(which i don't blame them for to save costs on a free item).. but meh. Just for laughs, I would enjoy the teamup if it was drunken Tony though."

marvelheroes,3a3lqu,MaxEisenhart,8,Thu Jun 18 08:37:55 2015 UTC,Awesome. People have been asking for the Potted Dancing Groot since GotG came out. And an Iron Man Team-Up will be great for to pair with Iron Man or War Machine. :)
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,MHDarkBeast,4,Tue Jun 16 23:36:05 2015 UTC,"Though I agree that people have been asking for the potted groot pet for a while, having it be a anniversary exclusive pet seems not as ideal as others. Not complaining about a free pet, but I think it would sell really well for them in the store and they could give a different pet away that would cause less issues with people that are inevitably going to complain."
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,Mosskiller96,5,Tue Jun 16 23:41:42 2015 UTC,truely this one has waaaaaaay more diplomatic talent than i got !!!!!!!   ;)

marvelheroes,3a3lqu,MaxEisenhart,3,Wed Jun 17 01:08:04 2015 UTC,It's a free gift. And it's not like they don't have to design the abilities and such for the Iron Man Team-Up. Or do the design work for the Groot Pet. It's not like they wave a magic wand and poof out comes something new for people. It's a shame to see people so ungrateful for anything they're given for free.
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,MHDarkBeast,3,Wed Jun 17 00:07:59 2015 UTC,"Not ungrateful by any means, I respect how much effort has to be put in for even a pet.  I just think they would be better off not making it anniversary specific is all. Heck, I think it would be fitting to just give away a free random pet thing, that gives us any of the ones already made. Really not hating on a free gift, just putting my 2 cents in on the topic :)   Also if this wasn't directed at me, sorry for the rant :p"
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,Mosskiller96,0,Wed Jun 17 00:12:48 2015 UTC,"slooow! with those young horses ;)  i didnt mean to be ungreatful just trying to have a open conversation, i am ""unimpressed"" thats different ! and given what and how much this company has been able to pull off/put out in the last two years i just didnt expect these to be so ahm dunno ""regular"" releases ?! i mean they set it pretty high themself ;) if you are the same DarkBeast as on forums you are around long enough to know what i am talking about ;)  i wont try to give a bad judgement ofc the staff is probably workin´ their asses off just to get the regular scedule running ! ....... but dunno i expected it to be a ""little"" bit more ahm out of line i guess....  but probably no time &/or resources for that ;)  BUT however it just occured to me that what you posted makes actually NO sense bacause IF the abilities for IM or the groot design was taken from elsewhere it is absolutely 1000% NOT free therefore not a gift IF it is from something that has been payed for development of it has been payed for that would be like tax evasion works just the other way around ;) ""production cost evasion"" OR ""multidimesional efficency"" hehehe .......just sayin´ however !!! thats probably more of a markets & giants problem ;)"
marvelheroes,3a3lqu,MaxEisenhart,2,Wed Jun 17 00:28:08 2015 UTC,Personally I'm glad we're getting an iron man team-up and a groot pet.  I could think of much worse alternatives.  But I have a feeling players like you aren't happy regardless of what is given out for free.

marvelheroes,3a461n,droid327,2,Wed Jun 17 02:18:38 2015 UTC,"It fires out these little bolts that are aimed at your pets.  It hits them and heals them.  Honestly, it's a worthless proc at 60 because your pets usually have so much health that they are in almost no danger of dying before you could re-summon them on pretty much any summoner in the game.  The only time the proc is really worthwhile is if you prestige because early game your pets do generally die a bunch."
marvelheroes,3a461n,ProfJackAss,-2,Wed Jun 17 02:44:46 2015 UTC,"So it doesn't do anything for your hero or your team-up?  Just autofires at your pets?  I was actually thinking about my turrets as RR, since I use them as meatshields/aggro sponges and they do die in places like CMM.  I only have like 6.8% Summon Health right now :)"
marvelheroes,3a461n,ProfJackAss,3,Wed Jun 17 04:05:02 2015 UTC,If you aren't going for a full blown pet spec then trident is not something you want.  If your turrets are dying you're likely not going for a pure pet spec or you are doing something terribly wrong.

marvelheroes,3a4eti,deadlymoogle,2,Wed Jun 17 09:37:26 2015 UTC,Where are you finding people that have that many goks? I had an absolutely perfect lizard with max rolls and advertised for a week trying to get at least 20 goks. Not a single person had that many to trade.
marvelheroes,3a4eti,The_Keto_Warrior,2,Wed Jun 17 11:58:50 2015 UTC,"I just used GoKs as an example - people pay higher priced items, but using GoKs as a base currency is simpler. I'm not gonna say ""2 zola, 3 goks, 2 HPP"" or something for a UEB lol. Saying 30 GoK's is much more straight forward.   Just gonna add that if you are trying to sell a high ticket item that expecting someone to pay fully in GoK's is silly and you need to expect some sort of item conversion in exchange - same goes for buying items. Don't tell someone you have 15 GoK's for an HPP, it's easier to trade a SWGN or something."
marvelheroes,3a4eti,firydragon,2,Wed Jun 17 12:01:15 2015 UTC,Oh ok I get it now. It's just worth the equivalent of 30 gok however you want to split it
marvelheroes,3a4eti,CosmonautDrifter,2,Wed Jun 17 12:05:12 2015 UTC,Correct. I bought a very high end ILAS today for SWGN+4 Zolas+2 GoK for example. Could I have traded off a boatload of GoKs? Sure. But this was much simpler and I just wanted to get the item before someone offered a lizard and things. The market is volatile and shifts constantly day to day. It's best to just monitor trade chat for an hour or two in order to get a feel for the days pricing then try to sell your items having the knowledge you've acquired.

marvelheroes,3a6i4l,Mosskiller96,7,Wed Jun 17 16:43:12 2015 UTC,"As a new player I joined a green raid without knowing whether or I had the gear for it, and I cleared it pretty easily. Only died once. Without reading the forums or reddit, I would have just assumed the difference in difficulty was the same as green terminal to red terminal, and that it shouldn't really be a problem.  So it could be that they lied, but it could also be they cleared green without a hitch and just assumed red was the same thing with a little more HP and more damage."
marvelheroes,3a6i4l,accaris,6,Wed Jun 17 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure this is it.

We've posted many times, suggested requirements for each raid, they shouldn't be too difficult to find if you don't know.

marvelheroes,3a6i4l,Roeratt,0,Thu Jun 18 18:09:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, so far what I've mostly seen is people switching to proc base stuff for the raid. Fresh example would be switching their Doom medaillon for a mole man or 2 of their artefacts for the latverian regalia ( the one that summons robots) and getting the artefact that summons squirrels and the like. Not saying thise artefacts are always bad, I'm just saying that if I inspected your SW and you had a gok/tasky/doom medal/mag was right/ whatever else... and when we get inside before the first boss I inspect you and you're running mole man/latverian x2/squirrel distress signal and aim dispenser.... I probably wont be happy if we get to the enrage phase because we dont have enough dps.... and yes that is an example taken from last week's red raid. I've also seen people switch their uniques around... say they had shard/skull coat they'll equip their hero unique because they have procs of something. Sometime its annoying how they do it, other times they could just be upfront anout it..."

It's up to the group leader to discern if people are qualified or not to be there, and that's what inspect is for. You can't check one's aptitude, but I recall vividly when I was only a month or two into the game trying to lead a red raid. We did it, but early on I asked everyone to not go in the middle and each take a prisoner at the start.  5 people went through the middle, and then blamed me when Slag spawned. We were 5 people shorter within a few seconds."

marvelheroes,3a6i4l,Shwagoblin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:52:46 2015 UTC,"Now I'll be blunt..red isn't that hard... and by that I mean: I ran a raid with /r/vengers ( 4-5 of them anyway) as a pug about 2 weeks back and we accidentally got queued for red instead of green... yeah... we realised it during the first boss thatvwas taking forever, and im pretty sure a lot ofbuse were on alts...but people still managed to pull through without wipes or leaves...  But then, I did a green last night on my well geared SW where we almost failed on mono....because we ran out of time, almost got wrecked on sisters because people stood in stuff and wiped twice on surtur because bad dps.... and people in that green were very well geared.  Now, I'll go ahead and say, people will tell you they are competent because they don't want to be doscreminated against.... and they THINK they can run red raid because...reasons. They've convinced themselves that they should be allowed in red raid on undergeared heroes because its there and THEY should have access to all content. If seen that behavior in a previous supergroup when raids came out. In general green raid (during its beta on live servers) was a pain. But people wanted to be brought there....and when we pointed out they had NO artefacts, NO relics, NO gear above purple, they told us: its new content, ANYONE should be allowed in. Needless to say, the leadership of the SG was split over it and eventually a chunk of us ended up leaving. ( the green raid, back then, was a lot more like the red raid is now difficulty wise. Meaning because there hadn't been ad many QoL changes as there are now, the dps was much lower in general and you had to do the mechanics...just like the red raid)  So my point is: because people feel entitled to new content, they will disregard any requirement you state in chat and ask to join. You have to remain vigilant of those.... and then there are the people who overgear the content but are too afraid to screw up or that they won't be good enough....  TL;DR: people tell themselves that if the content is there they should have access to it. And they wont even try to research it... they'll just believe that other peoplr can carry them and they can run blindly into it"
marvelheroes,3a6i4l,Mandroll,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:26:35 2015 UTC,"Something irks me on Mono is when i see players just straight up massacre the fire giants, so ill say something about it to them. They respond back with like, ""omg its only green raid it doesnt matter what we do with the fire giants"". Not only does it set a bad example to other players (new players especially), but theres no reason not to bring the fire giant over to the monolith."
marvelheroes,3a6i4l,imJapan,0,Thu Jun 18 14:15:09 2015 UTC,Hows does a geared group wipe in green due to low DPS? I just can't see it. Even the terrible green pugs I've been in didn't come close to failing on time.
marvelheroes,3a6i4l,mrmojoz,2,Wed Jun 17 20:56:27 2015 UTC,"Chatting and not having an effective power rotation. On average, I wonder how much each raid team loses in damage per word typed. Some type to instruct, and some can type fast, but I've seen the same ones who've typed throughout the whole match complain about DPS lol."
marvelheroes,3a6i4l,MarvelHero,3,Wed Jun 17 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"or the same people who stood in red circles/cones dying complaining that the dps is low... basically, to answer how a geared group wipes on green surtur, ...well you hvae some people stand in too much stuff, and you have some people that are semi afk using a basic. It's sad, but a lot of people perceive ANY content in marvel heroes as rightfully theirs no matter what happens... and usually the people causing the problems are the first ones to complain (mind you that's usually)... and I don't mean complaining after a wipe, I mean complaining BEFORE because we don't have enough ""insert FOTM champ here"", during because ""I see some of you not using your optimal rotations"" and after ""ZOMG QQ you people are bad we should have downed this boss in less than 30 seconds this is just green""... And yet those very players fail to see that the time they took to type non-stop before, DURING and after the boss encounter is the reason we're losing so much time. I mean if you have to explain to them that its ok we have the dps, then you have to type and tell them to stop standing in red stuff and to actually do something during the boss encounter, and then you have to WAIT for them to get to the next boss up to 10 minutes after everyone else because they were complaining about the fight taking OHHHHHH SOOOOO LONGGGGG... For those of you who think I'm over dramatizing this... I have been in some really WTH pugs with people like that. And when you're tired of their BS and people are whispering you, asking you to remove them from the group and you finally give in and do it, you start getting whispers about how many 100$ they invested in the game and how, for removing them, you are a terrible player (usually in very colorful languages) ... I have so many examples from the past 2-3 weeks (I usually run 1-5 greens and 1 red a week). I'm actually surprised those people can get away with behaving like that at all but oh well. Hopefully, I'll eventually give in and join an actual SG to run with :S"

For example, today a red group was gathering, so I ask for an invite.  The party leader had one 69 piece, one 66, and the rest 63s.  There was also a Deadpool in all 63 gear.

marvelheroes,3a51bs,ZeroBANG,-3,Wed Jun 17 16:42:15 2015 UTC,well it needs to be destructible... because once you are at ultimate power 20 there is no other use for them anymore and having indestructible and unusable items would clog up the inventory.

marvelheroes,3a1xjl,CFGX,2,Tue Jun 16 18:09:52 2015 UTC,Thats a great idea.  When they first started these events it wasnt too bad because they were reliable and once a month. Now sometimes we go months without seeing one so obtaining those items can be a pain.   In extreme cases look at ARMOR I don't think we've had an ARMOR event since like January or February. Its almost July!
marvelheroes,3a1xjl,DegenTP,2,Wed Jun 17 22:29:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on this, most people do I guess. It's absurd that those currencies drop in events only. There are so many items that are a must have for some heroes, not to mention the cosmic upgrade tokens. I'd settle on a weekly cap how much X currency you can get in a week just like raid tokens, but having to wait for an event that happens once in every two months is just dumb."

marvelheroes,3a0k7u,REDsox83,5,Tue Jun 16 13:18:54 2015 UTC,Just going to point out. If you didn't make backups and messed something up. Don't worry you don't have to download the game all over again.  Just delete the file you were messing with. Then run the game again. The game will automatically rebuild a default ini file.  Sometimes you have to delete the whole configuration folder. Annoying because you have to reset your key bindings
marvelheroes,3a0k7u,MutatedSpleen,2,Tue Jun 16 14:17:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely good luck with this, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. That card isn't quite as good as the 8800 GT that MH suggests as the absolute minimum system requirement.  Add RAM and old CPU to that and I just don't think it's possible.  Even if your specs were a good leap ahead, you'd still have dramatic lag issues, and I doubt you'd get much more than 10 FPS in basically any zone with people or mobs in it, if that much.  This game is really serious about system requirements.  Before I built my current system, I was on a Phenom II X4 (3.4ghz) and a Radeon HD 5770 with 8gb of RAM and I STILL couldn't do Midtown.  Not quite as bad as the full minute you're experiencing, but far beyond what I would consider ""unplayable.""  So...good luck, but don't hold your breath."
marvelheroes,3a0k7u,MutatedSpleen,0,Tue Jun 16 11:49:10 2015 UTC,"I know, it seems weird.  Benchmark sites pretty much universally agree that the 9800 GT performs slightly below the 8800 GT.

Setting priority to high was a trick that D3 support told us to use during the loot drop bug they had going on, which is very similar to this issue.. since then, it has seemed to help with things like that in most games I play. When I don't bother, I have similar waiting times to you, but not QUITE as bad. Just try it, it should be a noticeable difference. Also if you get disconnected often it might help."

marvelheroes,3a07vt,PeachStorm,11,Tue Jun 16 05:12:46 2015 UTC,"What is inside an MM box is determined at the time the box is dropped.  The easiest (only?) way to test this is to have MM boxes in your inventory at the time you copy your character to test center.  Open it on both characters with different amounts of sif and rif.  You should discover the contents are identical.    I have not tested MM boxes myself with duplication on test, but I can confirm a random hero box purchased already has it's hero in it selected based on testing with this method."
marvelheroes,3a07vt,Suzina,11,Tue Jun 16 12:13:32 2015 UTC,It would be easier to prove to yourself that the contents are not exactly determined when they drop by farming them on one character and opening them on another.

Since it was a boss loot explosion moved into the box a lot of people think it's what you are wearing as the box drops.

Each box contains 12-15 items with random affixes and datapoints. That's a lot of data to store.   It makes better sense to treat the box as a lottery ticket that only gets results when you want them, and in the meanwhile takes up valuable storage space that customers have to pay for."

marvelheroes,3a23em,d3athw3asel,4,Tue Jun 16 17:03:16 2015 UTC,"You can do it either way.  Build for pure energy, and then gear up for pure energy, or go hybrid and gear for hybrid.  Hybrid items used to be much more powerful than the single-type alternatives, so hybrid Rogues were popular, but that gap has closed a lot recently, particularly since L80 legendaries are now comparable to Power Cosmic."
marvelheroes,3a23em,droid327,3,Tue Jun 16 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"True, but in terms of bang for your buck I imagine the Power Cosmic is a much more cost/time-effective approach than the L80 legendaries. Especially if you can make use all three damage types."

marvelheroes,3a23em,pantsu_moebka,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:26:29 2015 UTC,"Skills? Ricochet, Cajun, passives like Hawkeye/Drax/Pyro/Punisher/Starlord or regen ones like DP/Lizard/Kurse plus Colossus, then for attrition I like Storm and Ms Marvel, with Thor for spirit and damage (or maybe BRB for just damage?) plus Venom Blast for a big burst of damage.  Ricochet + Cajun should clear most trash for you, then against bosses also layer your DOTs and then use Venom Blast on CD.  But I don't actually play that - I have my Rogue set up for farming, not for maxed DPS, so I have different passives and not as many skills.  Gear, just the usual advice...her own uniques should be fine, except you can probably swap the Slot 5 since you're not using a lot of her brawling tree.  Wasp is always a good insig for ranged, or Iceman.  L80 CCR is the legendary of choice for ranged energy builds, but L80 Gung is almost as good if you want the flexibility to change her build type later without having to switch legs.  HoD/GoK/Meta/Lizard area always good and Nimrod/T-Shirt will work for any ranged build if you switch later.  GoM or Bowazon for your runeword."

marvelheroes,3a0fwd,zylli42,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:33:23 2015 UTC,Team-ups are about 33% cheaper in the store.  It's best to try and catch them on sale.  They might have another this month so wait and see I think.  If there are heroes you don't have yet then I'd get those instead of ult upgrades.  The ult upgrades would be great but hero balance changes constantly so they're kind of a waste.
marvelheroes,3a0fwd,dorn3,0,Tue Jun 16 08:04:31 2015 UTC,The compendium (link in the sidebar) says all percent damage bonuses are added together.  This includes damage bonus from damage rating.  Search for the ABCPVP formula if you want a simpler explanation of the damage formula in the game.

marvelheroes,39ytxy,solkyoshiro,19,Mon Jun 15 22:09:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, sometimes when I'm leveling a new hero, I get to level 25-30 or so before I realize I'm not wearing any gear at all.  When I'm leveling, I just wear whatever cosmic I find with the highest level, and replace it with the hero-specific unique if it drops.  Once I get the unique, I just wear that til I get a higher level version of it.  Usually just use general generic artifacts during leveling too.  tl;dr - don't worry about gear unless you're trying to play a hero at end-game.  Your gear doesn't matter til end-game."
marvelheroes,39ytxy,MutatedSpleen,0,Tue Jun 16 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"Ok cool. It kind of felt like that but wasn't sure. I always rock uniques when I have them, or cosmics."
marvelheroes,39ytxy,Oshiba,12,Tue Jun 16 07:51:48 2015 UTC,I find this site helpful in picking the right items for each hero. http://jm.shost.ca/useful-artifacts/
marvelheroes,39ytxy,upvotesforeverything,17,Mon Jun 15 22:37:32 2015 UTC,"The gear is a big deal, but not while leveling. Its so quick to hit 60 that your choices don't even matter while leveling really. If you get a unique, chances are you want to put it on(if its for the hero that is, not an ""Any Hero"" unique). Other than that, wear cosmics if you can, if not, high damage/defense epics is fine. For heroes with spirit trouble,I recommend grabbing gear with an affix that gives spirit on kill. That can help a ton while leveling.  At endgame, you want to reach a certain crit chance, then aim for brutal strike. You'll want anything with + all powers as you want to try and reach 50 ranks to your main powers. At endgame it really is a hero-to-hero basis as to how you should gear. For a lot of heroes, their unique items are REALLY bad and aren't worth using, but Amthua(developer) is working on getting these updated. He is doing a fine job so far.  After you obtain the uniques you want, its about rerolling them to reaching high numbers(hold alt over an item to see the stat ranges), or continuing to hunt for those uniques with high rolls. At 60, don't pay attention to base damage rating rolls on the top of the item, the other affixes are way more important.   Outside of uniques, there's going to be 4 BiS artifacts you're going to want to get for your hero. There's typically only about 10-12 or so artifacts that are considered BiS, maybe less. Then again, BiS is a term that isn't as important as it used to be considering they are tuning a lot of heroes right now.   A lot of times I purposely don't go for the BiS artifacts because when people say BiS, they typically mean ""best damage"". For some heroes I like a bit more utility depending on who I am playing. For instance, if a hero is a bit low on the survivability side or lacks HP, I like to use an ACCC or White Suit Jacket at endgame. They are decent items all around and no one will shun you for wearing them.  Next would be insignias/medallions. These also vary from hero to hero, and you want to get the cosmic versions since they have +1 to all powers. Note: you can't FIND a cosmic insignia, you have to find a good rolled insignia that you want, then upgrade it to cosmic using items from the Cosmic event that they do every so often.   There's also a stack of relics, a legendary, ring, uru-forge item, and upgrading your Slot1-5 uniques to item level 69 and adding challenge bonuses to them to increase their stats.  If you have any questions regarding gearing up, feel free to PM me, I'll help you. Gearing in this game is very overwhelming in the beginning because there ARE a lot of stats, but then you very quickly realize that with a little knowledge it's not complex. Good luck!"

marvelheroes,39ytxy,Heimdahl,5,Tue Jun 16 21:13:26 2015 UTC,You basically want to use uniques only. You get level 60 rather fast and before that you can just take the rare item for a slot with the highest level or a unique if you find one.   Afterwards just check some guides for help.
marvelheroes,39ytxy,Quexana,5,Mon Jun 15 22:33:42 2015 UTC,Omegas are far and a way the biggest determinant in power level.  Gear doesn't really matter until you're trying to get that last 10-15% of efficiency out out of your hero.
marvelheroes,39ytxy,droid327,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:27:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree a little...gear is worth more than 15% of your efficiency, its just fairly easy to get up to the 80th percentile on your uniques.  But the difference between a L60 with decent uniques and one with random cosmic gear is noticeable.  Even once you have decent gear, getting rolls with high +skills so you can get your skills to 50 makes a noticeable difference."
marvelheroes,39ytxy,Quexana,0,Tue Jun 16 17:47:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's worth a bit more than 15%, but the gap between a guy with okay gear and a guy with Bis gear seems much less to me than two players with the same gear and one has 1500 Omegas and the other has 5500."
marvelheroes,39ytxy,RawrGaea,3,Wed Jun 17 07:45:35 2015 UTC,Gearing in this game is pretty much wait for 2-3 months until u can upgrade to il69. Skill points to 50 and then go nuts with the crap u can replace without dropping the main skills. And then u start farming omegas when u realize that's the biggest upgrade.
marvelheroes,39ytxy,scorpious1109,2,Tue Jun 16 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"Unless you push difficult group content, for the most part just use the best specific uniques you pick up (some heroes have more than one unique per slot, but it's usually for different build and very obvious which build). Artifacts, pretty much each type of hero uses the same spread. GoK, something for Spirit like Zola's or Lizards, and stuff for specific damage types (physical: Sacred White Gorilla Necklace, energy: Black Tom's, Summoner: Advanced Latvarian Regalia, etc...) Use whatever Medallion/Insignia/Ring/Legendary/Relics/Runeword that fits your build/damage types."

This guide has a bunch of ways to progress at endgame, if you need some pointers.  If you want to make sure you're doing something to take advantage of the XP boost, focus on Cosmic Terminals and/or Cosmic Patrols, depending on how geared up you are, and pick up a Team-Up for splinters. Cosmic bosses give great XP, and along with the boosts you'll be able to level up your Team-Ups and earn a bunch of Omega points at the same time, while still playing as your favorites. Re-roll Legendary Quests until you get Terminal ones so you can earn Odinmarks for those Blessings and IL80 Legendary as you go!

Deadpool is last on the list of reviews for many reasons, but an assumed reason is that his kit is fun and enjoyable. The Devs felt he  could still be interesting to Deadpool fans for a good and long while.  Personally I have Deadpool sitting at level 60 cosmic prestige. He doesn't have a sig, but his abilities are fun and comical. Once you get into the higher levels you won't feel he is hurting for damage, but his survivability is largely based on player awareness. He has one of the fastest animation blinks, so moving out of incoming damage is pretty easy.  Deadpool has certainly seen better days, but even now he is an awesome hero to play."

This is bottom tier ttk and currently the only heroes with worse confirmed ttk times are summoner Loki, colossus, and pure mental Emma.  As reference hybrid Emma clocked in a 6:40 ttk, and people consider Emma bottom tier.  If you are having fun with Thor, that's great. But if Gaz leaves Thor alone, then he probably won't be viable for future content.  edit: a lot of misconception of thor's powerlevel is due to how easily abused the earlier test dummy was with brutal farming, the new high health dummy is shedding alot of light in what heroes actual powerlevels are at."

You get some lucky brutals or unlucky and it sets your numbers all over the place.    Also I see a lot of guys throwing TTK around on Reddit and a lot of other guys saying too much emphasis on TTK is a waste.  Its funny you mentioned Emma, I got her to 60 a few days ago. As for Loki, I was having fun leveling her with her enhanced costume.  I love playing those guys too!  I got the shirtless Colossus costume from the last sale, it sounds like a might like him as well.  In keeping with he theme of supposedly underwhelming heroes, I really liked The Thing even before the 52 review.  Its nice he got even better.  I got Cyclops to 60 and I liked playing him.

marvelheroes,39zez2,BurnedOut_ITGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:37:55 2015 UTC,"TTK is a mixed bag.  It doesn't measure surviveability at all and it doesn't measure pure fun factor.  If you have fun playing Thor, then play him.  If you don't have fun playing a toon with a great TTK, then don't play them.  I like Thor.  I don't like him enough to main him, but I run around with the BRB skin on him and enjoy playing him.  He can run cosmic terms and one-shots w/no issues.  I'm sure I could gear him well enough to run cosmic midtown as well. If you enjoy the toon, play him and don't worry about the other stuff."
marvelheroes,39zez2,and29,2,Tue Jun 16 11:25:08 2015 UTC,"The only issue with this is Gaz balances all future content based on newly released heroes.  For instance Ms. Marvel awhile ago was considered a super strong hero when Green Musy was released, but then red Musy released and everyone realized her TTK was horrible and ppl stopped taking her to raids. Right now no one brings her to green axis, and if you do, it will raise some eyebrows.  Gaz has yet to release Red axis, and in order for red axis to be challenging to heroes like Doom, they will need to tune to newer released heroes TTK. The newer heroes TTKs are so far off from thor's that challenging content for them would be impossible for Thor."
marvelheroes,39zez2,BurnedOut_ITGuy,0,Tue Jun 16 16:21:12 2015 UTC,So few people raid.  Does this really matter to the majority of people?
marvelheroes,39zez2,and29,2,Tue Jun 16 16:26:11 2015 UTC,"Yes its true that majority of MH players don't raid, but its also true a majority of MH players don't post on a MH subreddit.   How do you know that OP doesnt raid, or might get into raiding in the future once he or she gets more into the game.  For people who do raid, game balance and having viable heroes matters a lot.  Also I think any player would like to know if the hero they are investing in is future-proof, I'm just doing my part and warning OP that Thor in his current state isn't future proof."

marvelheroes,39zez2,Randy-Randerson,3,Tue Jun 16 06:30:59 2015 UTC,How does he not play like Thor?  He can whack you with his hammer or shock you with lightning.  That sounds like Thor to me.
marvelheroes,39zez2,Aurunz,-3,Tue Jun 16 11:26:04 2015 UTC,That's why you don't know Thor. He is alot more than hammer and lightning. And they are even doing hammer and lightning wrong.

marvelheroes,39yf3o,MutatedSpleen,11,Mon Jun 15 20:25:29 2015 UTC,"There's a few you didn't mention left -- Mystique comes to mind as a really huge character, just one that would be nearly impossible to pull off in a compelling way with this game's mechanics, but I do think they're more or less running out of household names. Jubilee was fairly popular and is gonna be in the new X-Men movie, so she could receive a popularity upgrade too.  Beyond that, I think there's a chance we see like, Quake, Maria Hill, Elektra, Jessica Jones and Spider-Woman all playable in some form as characters who are getting some renewed exposure, they might be B-listers, but they're not nobodies or at least they won't be for long."

marvelheroes,39yf3o,Advacar,25,Tue Jun 16 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"Who is or isn't a major character is basically dictated my the mcu nowadays. When the inhumans get a movie, black bolt and Medusa will be big names. If Angela and Valkyrie show up in a Thor movie, they will be big names. If a spiderman movie comes out with black cat as a major player, she will suddenly big an important big name to license. MH doesn't miss big names because they release them in the game as soon as they hit the limelight, like what we saw with loki, bucky, star lord, vision, and soon blackbolt and antman which will be released alongside their marvel push."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,shilfee,3,Mon Jun 15 20:43:58 2015 UTC,"Well when it comes to overall comics A-listers Marvel doesnt really have many heroes. Basically what I mean is that in terms of public perception overall before the MCU existed, pretty much only a small group would be recognizeable. Which is why the movies are instant successes for that character in terms of becoming popular. And from a bussiness point, Marvel loves their tie ins promoting the movies and other points. Why? Because tie ins are awesome, and oh, well umm  they also make money. So when Gaz adds a hero around a movie release so many more people know that character and thus probably sells better. Same with the AoU mode, it got the game coverage and exposure."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,KiFirE,3,Mon Jun 15 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"The first sentence is irk-some. A-list totally is in the eye of the beholder. My A list almost definitely won't be yours. Depends on what you strongly identify with and what you have been exposed to. My marvel A list includes guys like Strange, Moon Knight, Madrox, Gladiator, and Jack Flag (one of the best characters ever)"
marvelheroes,39yf3o,wotrick,6,Mon Jun 15 22:27:33 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't an A-list generally revolve around how often a character gets used in crossovers/etc in the comic and cinematic universes?  E.g. wolverine is about as a-list as you get. He pops up pretty much everywhere in the comics(though in the cinematic universe he's stuck with fox), he has had multiple trades dedicated to him.  Strange certainly would make any  a-list for comic readers, and with his debut in the cinematic universe soon will be a-list for the general populace. But Madrox? Occasional side roles at most, I don't think he has played a major role in anything much, though I haven't read much of recent x-men/x-factor(though I will get to it... eventually)  While  A-list is somewhat subjective, I do think that there are certain qualities required and that it's not something impossible to build concensus on. Whether Bucky is A-list is pretty arguable, I would tend to say no, but he gets a strong argument from the recognizability granted by the mcu. Most of the characters you listed don't get that reasonable doubt"
marvelheroes,39yf3o,creepy_doll,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:53:22 2015 UTC,Madrox was the star of one of the best X-books in a long time. Start with the Madrox limited and read all the way through. It's really good.
marvelheroes,39yf3o,wotrick,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:08:29 2015 UTC,I'll be sure to check it out. But one good title still doesn't make him an A-list character :)

marvelheroes,39yf3o,wotrick,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:05:13 2015 UTC,"Fair warning, a couple of the story arcs get derailed by events like necrosha and messiah complex."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,wotrick,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I was more referencing general public A-list+recognize-ability. Which would include comic sales and other factors pre MCU.  I really wasnt aiming for any personal perspective on who was a-list to an individual.   Like for example, spiderman has been mainstream in a way for a long time, with a cartoon show and other media that people would recognize. While many of the marvel characters never had that in the early days. For example my dad knew about the hulk because of the 70's show. But not many others."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,KiFirE,3,Mon Jun 15 23:19:10 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, but that changes on a whim too. Let us not forget that the current MCU started with a relatively obscure character, in terms of comic sales and public recognition, Ironman. Same could be said for GotG which is arguably Marvels most successful movie property, given the small number of us cosmic readers comparatively.  Guess what I mean is that any character chosen to push will become A-list. If they did a Netflix show about Madrox and X-factor today, people would be bitching tomorrow that they're not included in Cap 3 and Infinity War. (contractual and contextual issues aside)  Edit: Lost my point there.... Oh yeah it was everyone can and will be or has been some groups A list"
marvelheroes,39yf3o,wotrick,3,Mon Jun 15 23:31:34 2015 UTC,"Iron man as obscure seems a bit of a stretch?  He was a pretty central figure in the comics well before the first move in 2008. Just because his personal comics weren't sold much doesn't mean he was obscure. Quite frankly, he's a more interesting character as part of a team and as Tony Stark in the politicking he's involved in. And he had a cartoon in the 90s, I'd hardly call him obscure. Captain America was probably more obscure until Brubeck's run on the comic."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,creepy_doll,4,Tue Jun 16 01:59:24 2015 UTC,"If we are talking about books sales, both Avengers titles and solo Ironman series were circling the drain. Marvel themselves at the time of production new they were taking a D list property and kicking off the MCU.     I love the Guardians & Star-Lord. But I also recognize that they were way down the rung of being known. Even though the D&A 2008 ongoing sold really really well.     To the point there were a lot of characters that were central to the comics well before 2008, but that doesn't mean that they are well know by the populous.    I would call Pym more a central character in terms of the Avengers prior to the Ironman movie, but I still wouldn't say there is a general consensus that he is ""A"" List, I would still say that the depressed wife beater is overall obscure"
marvelheroes,39yf3o,wotrick,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:14:45 2015 UTC,"http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2007.html  ""Circling the drain""? Sounds like BS to me. Yeah, ironman wasn't selling particularly well, but with the exception of captain america(that issue) and spiderman, not many solo characters were selling well. In the meantime, apart from the central civil war issues, both the new and mighty avengers issues were very high.  The figures for trades may not  be so  high, presumably because the people that are interest are buying the issues as they came out.  Circling the drain my ass  edit: just picked out a month here where a trade went on sale http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2007/2007-11.html 107k of new avengers issues sold vs 5k of the trade. Seems to me that the figures of the separate issues sold is more significant than the trades."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,creepy_doll,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:40:48 2015 UTC,I thought mighty centered more around guys like Sentry. Could be wrong. So in theory my statement regarding comics featuring Ironman could still be correct. (not confident in the Mighty line up though.)
marvelheroes,39yf3o,wotrick,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:21:16 2015 UTC,"Iron Man was the leader of the mighty avengers(ok, technically Ms Marvel was but she always answered to tony who was also the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. to whom the mighty avengers answered). And he had lots of face time as a central  figure in every major event except secret war preceding the movie. As director of SHIELD, organizer of the initiative, leader of one side of the civil war, a member of the illuminati, I don't think there was any single character in the comics universe at the time with more influence or importance."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,creepy_doll,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:32:40 2015 UTC,"Look at it long term. Don't start with last functional ten years. Go with 25 years. Add in that point in the 90's when Marvel filled for bankruptcy, and sold off the rights to Spiderman, the X-men, the Fantastic Four, and Namor."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,GreatMadWombat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:23:01 2015 UTC,"Well the issue here is that the histories are confused here a bit.  Avengers wasn't doing too hot until disassembled(2004), so indeed, it was ""circling the drain"" in the late 90s/early 2000s. On the other hand, by the time the iron man movie came out, both iron man and the avengers were one of their top billings and not some ""D list property"".  Of course it probably wasn't coincidence. It wasn't a freak accident that they put Brubacker who they had finally got to work for them working on Captain America. It wasn't a freak accident they decided to reboot the avengers and make tony stark a massively important central figure.  My point here is simply that at the time the MCU started, Ironman was a major player in the comics."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,creepy_doll,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:01:49 2015 UTC,"Statements based on Marvel ABC doc and statement from Fiege and Favareu on Geektime.  Never really got into Avengers books. Some here and there, but never found them all that engaging. Did like Young, Academy and Assemble though.  I forgot what the original thread was about😃   Edit: Wasn't that new avengers run, spidey wolverine, strange, ms marvel and cage?"
marvelheroes,39yf3o,wotrick,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:12:06 2015 UTC,"Well, the lineup changes but the point that I quoted is post-civil war new avengers which is luke cage/spidey/wolverine/strange/hawkeye(as ronin)/iron fist and echo.  Especially with Strange there, it was a pretty badass lineup, but most of the new avengers lineups were badass. Personally I think the new avengers was way better than mighty which I think was trying to strengthen a bunch of not so popular characters like Ares and Black Widow who had a bit of a lack of flair. They also had too many extremely powerful characters(Ms Marvel, Ares, Sentry, Wonder man) which to me didn't make it very interesting. Still, it did have a couple of interesting sections.  edit: as far as those statements are concerned, are you sure they're not referring to the avengers in the late 90s/early 2000's? Sales of avengers WERE down until disassembled happened. After that sales figures are among the top performing"
marvelheroes,39yf3o,creepy_doll,2,Tue Jun 16 03:29:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Stark was involved in pretty much every crossover(save the Secret Wars era and possibly a few others when he was off being drunk) and has always stayed a relevant character. In fact, every founding Avenger has always been important within the comics. Wasp is one of the currently most fucking underrated characters ever, Janet is AWESOME and gets no recognition, same for Hank really."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,Aurunz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:06:57 2015 UTC,"True but that relatively obscure character became one of the biggest names of marvel overnight.  Which going back to the post of A-list being included, which is why the MCU will have a lot of pull.  But my main point was in terms of known characters, that are public A-list. Pretty much all of them have been put in or are coming.Teams core rosters like FF,avengers,xmen are almost complete. and we are going to get obscure in terms of not well known. Which means they could still be someones favorite but also not likely to have a movie or anything any time soon. Which means the next batch of unannounced characters will most likely be movie tieins, with inhumans and other characters around those movies."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,KiFirE,0,Mon Jun 15 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like A-list is the guys who are recognizable to people not into comics or movies.  My mom has never seen a comic cartoon , or read a comic book.  But she knew who Spiderman and Hulk were before I ever got into them. Superman, Batman  are also on that list.   They're sort of in some way or another cultural icons/references that people get into who aren't comic book fans.   Punisher for his symbol alone was another one.  When Shaq or Kap or some all start defenseive back wears your logo you're an A-list hero.  Even if those people have never opened a Superman comic.   Iron Man on the other hand is a product of Marvels ability to push certain heroes into marketability.  He was pretty lame and was given a nice makeover image, costume and storyline wise.  But there are plenty of people  if you lined up Steel, Terminator, Ultron, Lex Luther in his armor and Iron Man  And said pick Iron Man, would not be able to pick the right guy.   He's not on the level of the other 4 guys."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,The_Keto_Warrior,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"You still start with a-listers from comics .  The MCU can very easily boost someone to a-list, of course, but doesn't change things to someone not being a-list just because they don't have a movie yet.  Those who were a-list in comics before the MCU are still a-list.  It just so happens the MCU is a character's greatest popularity promoter these days."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,Rhodair,10,Mon Jun 15 23:02:37 2015 UTC,"I think this is pretty key. It's all about your frame of reference.  I mean, Jubilee is A-list to anyone who came of age on the 90s X-men cartoon or comics. Bishop too."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,unsettlingideologies,13,Mon Jun 15 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"I was 9 when the first episodes of X-Men started to air every Saturday morning.  I lived it.  I pooled any money I could from allowance and paper route to spend on comics and trading cards.  Jubilee was never A-list, even during that time.  Jubilee was ok.  She was just there and didn't annoy me.  She was used as a fun introduction to the team and was quickly brushed to the side.  Every now and then, she'd tag along with the X-Men or Wolverine and hold her own (or not.)   She appeared in a couple episodes with Slave Island, Juggernaut, Sabretooth, etc. but these were mostly within the 1st season when they were trying to push her and still wasn't the focus.  She was mostly background for the next 4 seasons unless you count ""Have Yourself a Morlock Little X-Mas"" or ""Jubilee's Fairytale Theatre"".  If she only went as far as the tv comics, she'd be C-list, but because of her run in Generation X and the main X-Men comics and so many people are passionate about her, she could stretch to B-list. I'm right on board with her being in game too.  I think her powers would look amazing in this style of gameplay!  However, if you need to set limits on the people who think a character is a-list, they're not a-list."

marvelheroes,39yf3o,Advacar,6,Tue Jun 16 13:46:51 2015 UTC,"I was curious what classified a hero as ""A-List"" and found this in a random thread (wording slightly modified.)  Perhaps this could help with discussion.   A-list: Franchise characters that can support multiple books, spin offs, etc. These are characters the universe is generally set around, the ones that get to star in events. B-list: Characters that can sustain their own series or are 'permanent' members of team books but aren't big enough to be headlight acts. Some characters could also be B-list if seen as 'iconic' or are getting a push. C-list: The majority of characters that get used a lot but aren't 'important'. They may not be guaranteed to get a spot on a team book.  If they have an ongoing series, they won't likely be able to hold it. They may not get used much but are still generally well known and somewhat popular. D-list: Characters who are somewhat obscure or 'disliked' by most people (could sometimes be intentional, like a lame villain who gets used a lot because they are a lame villain.)  This still does not include really obscure characters (e.g. filler guy who showed up for 3 issues in the '90s and brought back because the writer liked them, or whatever.)"

marvelheroes,39yf3o,unsettlingideologies,6,Mon Jun 15 21:55:45 2015 UTC,How are you defining B-Lister? Hasn't he been one of the central antagonists throughout the whole incursions plot?
marvelheroes,39yf3o,sally_awesomelegs,0,Mon Jun 15 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"For A-Listers I honestly think that major, recurring appearances across multiple forms of media is a necessity. I realize that Namor is mostly not getting this because of licensing issues, but being a recurring face behind the scenes of arcs in comic books that get maybe a very very very small fraction of the exposure that appearances in other media do and you're looking at a major recognizability issue.  I can see I pissed off the Namor fanboys, but I don't really care. Is he a historically important character? Sure. Is he an important side character in some recent marvel story arcs? Sure. Is he A-List? I don't really see it."

marvelheroes,39yf3o,Hellavor,2,Mon Jun 15 21:08:20 2015 UTC,Apocalypse and bishop are my top two on that list. I also think dormammu would be a super cool playable character.   Didn't they say at one point that characters who were exclusively villains would never be playable? They justified mags by saying he was allied with the X-men not infrequently and I think there was similar logic to doom and loki. But can you really make that argument for apocalypse or dormammu?

Furthermore, he's so far beyond the power level of anything that's been implemented into the game thus far outside of maybe Surtur.

We haven't even exhausted popular heroes that existed in tv-shows/movies.   Bishop Wasp Quicksilver Wonder Man   Probably a bunch of others I'm forgetting.

marvelheroes,39yf3o,holderup,0,Tue Jun 16 05:55:24 2015 UTC,"She could have a tree with powers like Rogue's where she gets different disguises that give her different bonuses to her other power trees and she can switch disguise using the power in the hotbar. For example disguising as Juggs, Hulk or Ms Marvel would make her melee powers do more damage and she'd gain defence, disguising as Bullseye, Hawkeye or Starlord gives her ranged damage bonus but makes her more frail, disguising as Psylocke, X-23 or Deadpool gives her crit damage and movement power damage, etc.    Like I can imagine her having a couple bread and butter powers with like 3 or 4 disguises on the hotbar which lets her freely change during combat. About to take a big hit? Change to Hulk. Want your Sniper power to hit like a truck then jump in stealthed and shank them? Change to Punisher then change to Black Widow."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,ee3k,2,Tue Jun 16 02:02:19 2015 UTC,"That would be cool, but I don't think it really makes sense in terms of Marvel canon.  Mystique's powers originally didn't allow for her to do anything particularly fucky with her shape-shifting, such as becoming more dense (such that she would take less damage from a punch, for example).  They've evolved some throughout her various runs in various books, so if that sort of business was included, she could be interesting.  Some examples I found online included giving herself talons, extra arms, and natural body armor.  Still, that version of Mystique would be dramatically different than the one most people are likely familiar with (MCU Mystique).  Might be fun to play, though."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,Orannis0,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:22:16 2015 UTC,"I think the Black widow comparison is apt. I would imagine Mystique playing like a traditional stealth based character. She does not go invisible she just takes on other forms, drops aggro and stabs you in the  back for massive damage. The mechanics are pretty simple really while in ""stealth mode"" i.e. disguised as an npc your damage is massively boosted but when you are out of stealth you are a paper tiger and will be torn to pieces if you are not careful. Plus it would be cool to have her be able to wear any costume in the store."

Didn't really know anything about Emma Frost except vaguely that there was someone named White Queen.  Luke Cage was just that blaxploitation guy.  Never heard of Squirrel Girl at all, or Taskmaster, or X23.  That all being said, Adam Warlock was the central character of the Infinity War (aside from Thanos), and the whole subsequent world of the Infinity Watch.  He's kind of a big deal :)"
marvelheroes,39yf3o,BarbaricBeast,-2,Tue Jun 16 00:39:12 2015 UTC,"Just because you personally have never heard of someone doesn't mean they're not A-List and shouldn't be a playable, by that logic Nova and Moon Knight shouldn't be playable because they're not popular heroes. Also by that logic Ant-Man is C-List and Psylocke is A-List because I don't know much about Ant-Man but I do about Psylocke. Also Adam Warlock is definitely A-List."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,Punchclops,0,Tue Jun 16 00:59:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely wasn't trying to argue that playable heroes should be restricted to only the most popular or anything of that nature.  As for the various ""lists"", there is an obvious level of subjectivity to that, but I think we can pretty much all agree on some staples.  When we're talking ""A-list"", that would include obvious pillars of the Marvel continuity such as Captain America, Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, etc.  I shouldn't have used the phrase ""A-list"", but instead should have said something like ""well known"".  I think you can get the point from that, though."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,ElectricZee,0,Tue Jun 16 09:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just thought I'd make sure I got the point across though. Imo A-Listers are either heroes with/in popular films/TV shows or heroes that have a big impact in the comics. Someone like Iron Man is now obviously an A-Lister (probably the second most well known Marvel hero after Spider-Man) and yet before his films he was probably a B-Lister who was only known by Avengers comic fans whereas someone like Adam Warlock or Black Bolt are A-Listers because of the comics but because they don't have films a lot of fans don't know of them."
marvelheroes,39yf3o,Chucklebuck,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:56:05 2015 UTC,Iron Man actually was pretty publicly recognizable compared to a lot of characters -- he featured prominently in cartoons and video games well before his movie came out.

Also, it ensures that the players are versed in the raid mechanics, which helps expedite the later Red Raid -- saves us the trouble of having to fact check your experience level.  Plus, it's a one time thing.  You don't have to sign up for Green Raids every week and most of our Green Raids are completed in 30-45 minutes, so it's a minimal time commitment to unlock additional raiding opportunities.  At the end of the day, we've tried to minimize the requirements for Red Raiding so as to be open to a larger proportion of the community.

Same reason I got Falcon; because I main Winter Soldier and Cap, and having any other team up (except maybe Coulson) didn't feel as awesome as having WS costume cap and Falcon running around being awesome.

marvelheroes,39xkbl,jlobster,2,Mon Jun 15 16:51:27 2015 UTC,It wouldn't be worth it to cosmic prestige this week unless the server hits 200% right?  Or is it anything over 100%? Cosmic week just doubles cosmic xp so that's 100% right?   Little confused...
marvelheroes,39xkbl,Arcath_,5,Mon Jun 15 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"anything over 184% is better than cosmic week. cosmic week has 42%, so that's 142% doubled to 284% for cosmic toons. anything less than that is worse than cosmic week"
marvelheroes,39xkbl,weltschmerz79,2,Mon Jun 15 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"This isn't necessarily true, as during cosmic week the xp needed for cosmic is halved, so you need 1/12.5 the amount, and then on top of that there's a 42% xp server side boost. At least that's how I interpret it.  Which isn't the same as 142% * 2. Cause then each boost a cosmic prestiged hero has on would be multiplied by 284% server side. And I am pretty sure it isn't, and that it's only multiplied by 1.42.  Scratch that, I did some math further down."
marvelheroes,39xkbl,bigbadVuk,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:07:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, still not sure it's worth it.   Shouldnt it be anything over 142% is equal to cosmic week?  Double cosmic xp is just a 100% bonus.  Still woudnt give me enough time though. By the time we hit 142% it would be close to patch time. It's not like we are going to get another 44% jump at the beginning."
marvelheroes,39xkbl,Arcath_,2,Mon Jun 15 18:18:34 2015 UTC,"I just did a lot of math and ended up confused :P.  I think the ""problem"" is what this means:    ""Cosmic Prestige Doubled - Doubled leveling rate for Cosmic Prestige during Cosmic Chaos week.""    Does that mean that if you need 1 million xp to get up one level, you now need 500k xp? Or does that mean that you still need 1 million, but all your xp gain is doubled? Cause those two aren't the same in the end... at least I don't think they are.  If they ARE in fact the same, then what welt says is true, and 184% serverside = cosmic week.  Your concerns about prestiging though are valid, as we know there won't be cosmic week for at least another 2 weeks after this."
marvelheroes,39xkbl,bigbadVuk,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:46:42 2015 UTC,"Cosmic prestige xp is 1/25th of normal xp with Omega xp remaining the same. Reguardless, this doesnt matter. We all know it will take a lot of time and I am not trying to compare it to normal server xp.  That said...  It just means that cosmic xp during cosmic week gets a free 100% server multiplier. Which should be an xp gain. Not a reduction in needed xp.  I guess my only question is if the 42% is added in before or after the double xp multiplier.  If it's added after then it would be 142%. If it is included, which doesnt make sense in my head, it would be 184%.  This is my train of thought anyways... I have been tempted to take the plunge on that last prestige since the servers hit 150% last week."
marvelheroes,39xkbl,Arcath_,3,Mon Jun 15 18:56:47 2015 UTC,"Ok I did more math! :D  Welt has in fact correct! I was wrong.  Say you gain 100 xp normally, during cosmic prestige you gain 1/25 of this, aka 4. During cosmic event you gain 1/12.5 of this aka 8.  Then, at 184% serverside, no boosts, no cosmic event, you actually get 4 xp * 2.84 = 11.36.  At 42% serverside, no boosts, with cosmic event you actually get 8 xp * 1.42 = 11.36.  If you are running 200% xp synergy bonus you now are getting the following:  W/o cos event: (4  * 3) * 2.84 = 34.08 XP  /W cos event: (8 * 3) * 1.42 = 34.08 XP  So yes, 184% serverside xp = cosmic event.  P.S. By that math equation ( (8 * statsheet xp) * 1.42 (serverside) = XXX) you can see that by running 780% xp boost on your stats sheet, through boosts and xp synergy you gain the same amount of xp as a normal 60 without any boosts or synergies."
marvelheroes,39xkbl,bigbadVuk,2,Mon Jun 15 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"Just to give you some prespective. I started cosmic prestige last monday and reach lvl 47 today.

marvelheroes,39wzz0,nodajmal,8,Mon Jun 15 14:14:46 2015 UTC,"Omegas generally don't give very good returns on defense and survivability, so I doubt that's it, except inasmuch as the best defense is a good offense and more Omega will help you kill bosses before they can kill you.  How much are you playing your non-Juggs heroes before you get frustrated and go back to Juggs?  I know whenever I switch to an alt, there's a little adjustment period where I have to remember how to play them, re-activate my muscle memories for the other hero.  Juggs' style of play is so unique, if you forget that everyone cant play the same way, you're going to get them killed a lot more often.  Still, a fully geared Cap shouldn't have much of a problem in Cosmic terms.  What's ""fully geared out"" mean?  BIS boss artifacts and uniques?  If you're only at 700 Omega, then you probably aren't running with SWGN, GOK, HOD, etc., you probably don't have a L80 legendary for anyone besides Juggs, probably don't have a maxed out pet.  Basically, there's probably still a lot of untapped potential from your gear.  Also, what Team Up are you using?  They can be a big help to your survivability now."
marvelheroes,39wzz0,droid327,2,Mon Jun 15 14:26:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah true I didn't have a level 80 legendary. I did have SWGN GoK and HPP on him though. I will definitely go back to him and try to play him more before getting frustrated and going back to Juggernaut though, thanks for your tips!"
marvelheroes,39wzz0,absynthe7,9,Mon Jun 15 15:37:40 2015 UTC,"Here's what you really need before hitting Cosmics, IMHO:   Absolute minimum of 20k Health, 10k Defense, and 10% Damage Negation, preferably more Rank 4+ Legendary Weapon, 4x Hela Blessings 4 Costume Affixes, L60 Costume Core with AT LEAST one of the following: Invuln on Medkit, Spirit on Medkit, 400 LoH Significant amount of Life on Hit, Health Regen, or both Make sure to not get surrounded, even by trash mobs - kill as you go until you get more used to the difficulty jump Enchantments on all five gear slots A full stack of medkits and use them whenever you feel the slightest bit of pressure, change the hotkey to something you can easily reach (I have mine on middle mouse button, so I heal by clicking my scrollwheel)   You need to balance ""staying alive when they hit you"" with ""killing them before they hit you too much"". Some ways to get more survivable:   Make sure you've got Health on your Medallion, Ring, Insignia, and/or at least one Artifact if possible (ACCoC is huge here) Make sure you've maxed your defensive passive. For instance, on Hulk I'll skip his Headbutt or Pummel in order to max Hulk Tough, and it makes a HUGE difference Use a defense Uru-forged, even if you're using an offensive Runeword - 800 is enough to make a significant difference LoH or Regen on gear, especially a Relic of Lemuria stack Get a Team-Up, have them in Companion mode to soak some hits and distract bosses Consider swapping an offensive costume affix or two for Health defensive affix, though the loss in damage can really hurt Cattle runes on gear slots 2-4 is 600 Health right off the bat, make sure you do that   Hope this helps!"

I have both geared with only what I attained getting to 60 and Mr. F dies if someone looks at him angrily and Thing can do cosmic Task Master with no problem. Omegas definitely make a difference but since OP has that many heroes at 60, the test to prove what I am saying is relatively easy.     I have SS at orange prestige with a movement build and in CMM, he has trouble. Not sure what to tell you with Cap. He requires a little more moving around but I can stay alive with him without too much trouble.    I know they are working on it but for now...some heroes are just tougher."

marvelheroes,39wzz0,KamahlFoK,2,Mon Jun 15 15:38:24 2015 UTC,The most important thing for any char is the costume core.  At the very least you want Invuln + Medkit or Invuln + life on hit.  Make sure you have some extra health from an artifact or insignia.  Farm a good ICC ring too.   Get your heroes defensive skills.  The rest is all about killing the boss before he kills you.

Very cheap, great on any hero who doesn't need dodge.  2) Advanced Mandroid Armor. 14 ranks is the ""optimal"" DPS/rank point, and while it's not the most efficient, it does come with 420 defense.  3) S02 Formula. I actually don't like this, but it's not a bad option.   Also if you're talking about Cap, make sure you're using his Photograph unique. I think it has some Invader's Aura on it that gives ridiculous stats to you and your party. Very good. And start using the defense uru, way better than the offense ones."

I just messed around in the Prologue with him and didn't take him beyond that.  He's really expensive to gear up and I have a couple of other heroes that I want to level up and outfit before I get around to him.

The only other time I was this excited about a new hero was probably Emma Frost and she was a huge letdown.  Psylocke has not been that.  I haven't finished leveling her but she is a total blast to play.  I can see her being one of 3-4 I really try to outfit with great gear

EDIT -  I should add my experience with her yesterday. She's fun, but her melee build feels like just another melee character to me. Nothing really ""marvelous"" about it, IMO. She seems sturdy, and does decent damage, but she hasn't really felt like much I'd write home about.   I plan to try her out in a more melee/ranged type hybrid build, using some of her AoE ranged powers, and see how that goes. If still nothing feels good to me, I'll try a full ranged build.   I'm going to be disappointed with her, huh? lol."

And I thought that I'd get a feel for him now so when his 52 review comes out, I'll be able to really tell the difference.  So far, he's not bad.  Running a melee build, though I guess his skill setup is pretty basic.  Start with Nerve Gas, melee basic for bleed, then hammer Gut Stab for heavyish burst.  I like using Power Ups to be quasi-support during community fights, though I don't think people can actually see them or actively avoid them or something.    The synergies will be nice too."

I remember Squirrel Girl was my first character to get a red-raid capable ttk simply because I had a bunch of the rare gear (monarch cloak, sinister cuirass) that boosted summon damage by a large margin.  However, people exaggerate the effect of omegas on damage. They don't double your damage. I did a proc test on the high health dummy with She-Hulk using just xerogenesis and dazzler (spoiler, her proc rates suck), and I got around 6 minutes, whereas I can get below 5 minutes (without a team-up) when I use all of my omegas.

Now, some characters in top tier will be able to get away with a few less omegas to clear higher content, but none are actually dependent on them more than others.   If you are asking which characters are the strongest, I have heard Venom, Hulk(squishy), Juggernaut, Scarlet Witch and Captain America are some of the top ones. Scarlet being the easiest of them to gear, and venom probably being one of the safest, though he is no longer invincible, so you may think a ranged Scarlet is safer now.  In the end, they all work fine, just pick the one you want to play, ignore everything else. If you aren't having fun with a character, why play? The only advice I'd give is to not get a 200 hero, since they are so cheap and fast to get, otherwise pick any 400+ hero you think will be fun."

That being said, I was just trying to name the top 5 and tell him to play whatever is fun, regardless of circumstances.

marvelheroes,39vb6x,Moogy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:00:13 2015 UTC,Second this. I only have 200 omegas but can easily solo cosmic terminals with doom. Only hit 60 a couple of days ago and haven't tried cmm yet.
marvelheroes,39vb6x,gtalnz,-1,Mon Jun 15 06:05:58 2015 UTC,"nowadays cosmic terminals are the absolute minimum of content. any char with zero omegas should smash them. cmm/cicp is where things get rought for everyone, at least as long as they arent there to purely leech others"
marvelheroes,39vb6x,arcdevil,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:54:29 2015 UTC,Nah you'd be surprised. I had trouble with most heroes trying to solo cosmics with zero omega's. Especially anyone squishy
marvelheroes,39vb6x,Kingfield,-4,Mon Jun 15 07:20:16 2015 UTC,"in that case if I were you I'd look into the way I play, not into how big my omega pool is. probably you dont want to hear this but...PEBKAC. anyone can smash cosmic terminals with any badly geared fresh 60"
marvelheroes,39vb6x,arcdevil,7,Mon Jun 15 07:26:58 2015 UTC,"Shocker, OK.  Kurse?  Please, go smash Kurse, solo, with a fresh 60, badly geared with no omega's allocated.  Ultimates Not Included."
marvelheroes,39vb6x,smittyphi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:10:03 2015 UTC,"This man speaks the truth.  As someone whose first character was pre-qol Black Widow (i.e. a sucky character), I can tell you that reaching level 60 was like a brick wall and I definitely could not solo Cosmic Kurse. This was back in November, when the power creep was going in full force with Juggernaut's release.  Even when I switched to a better character, Moon Knight, I still couldn't solo Cosmic Kurse until I had some better gear (remember this was when his uniques sucked) and around 1k omegas. I'm guessing summoners and some of the newer characters with good uniques such as venom and scarlet witch would have a much easier time, but hard to say because I'm way past the point of cosmic terminals being hard (I have max omegas and full upgrades now)."
marvelheroes,39vb6x,mikwuyma,2,Mon Jun 15 18:16:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah nah pretty hard when those cosmic balls take about 1 nd a half seconds to kill you, and pretty much any attack from the boss itself basically one shots you as well   Especially when you're melee you just can't stay closr"
marvelheroes,39vb6x,Kingfield,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:34:44 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna say Juggs, and here's why...  -Defense is the facet of characters least affected by Omega, and so high-defense/""tanky"" characters tend to get that mostly from powers and uniques  -Physical has fewer Omega nodes than Energy or Mental, so your DPS isn't as reliant on that  -A lot of your DPS comes from Spirit (Momentum), and again that's mostly from gear  -Movement build has some really good gear options (ie Midtown ring for +30% damage).  -Elbow Drop is easy, big damage, AOE kinda gameplay"
marvelheroes,39vb6x,droid327,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:15:18 2015 UTC,There's definitely heroes that do better with less Omegas.  That's only one side of the decision though.  There's also gear dependency and overall hero power.  I recommend Iceman if you simply feel the need to have someone that can do harder content.  He doesn't need the crazy artifacts to be good and you can hide behind your melee golems on hard stuff.
marvelheroes,39vb6x,dorn3,-6,Mon Jun 15 14:40:55 2015 UTC,"Summoners. Any summoners. I hate it but its true.  Also as second choice any super expensive hero. Because they start with massive stats boost, usually durability fighting etc.  Combine that in one word. Doom"
marvelheroes,39vb6x,IcemanSR,2,Mon Jun 15 05:56:49 2015 UTC,"Price is determined by how much resources it took to make the character, not by popularity or power."
marvelheroes,39vb6x,droid327,2,Mon Jun 15 14:09:37 2015 UTC,"Well it was originally on popularity (which is why Iron Man, Spider Man, and Deadpool are 600s) but was since changed to the technical line of stuff.

I think its dangerous right now currently to invest in a level 80 legendary, mainly for the reason that they have begun their new tuning methods.  I recommend waiting to see where the heroes stand after they are done with the major tuning, unless you want to risk losing 200 odin marks if it ends up not being what you want.  The ilvl 80 legendaries ARE nice, don't get me wrong. But they aren't required for any of the current content at all."
marvelheroes,39uspd,upvotesforeverything,3,Mon Jun 15 05:36:50 2015 UTC,Dont forget you also have to get the 900 (or 700.. i cant remember) influence to even unlock the lvl80 Legendary first.  You also lose 1/5 of your Odin Mark investment if you decide to re-sell it back to the vendor for a different one.  These are some things you want to think about before buying that end game focused legendary.
marvelheroes,39uspd,dkphxcyke,2,Mon Jun 15 00:09:31 2015 UTC,900 influence indeed.

marvelheroes,39uspd,DarknessMuta,3,Mon Jun 15 04:11:23 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Blessings first. If you switch mains, you can transfer the Blessings, since Helas are good for everyone. Best Legendary, on the other hand, can vary from hero to hero."
marvelheroes,39uspd,absynthe7,2,Mon Jun 15 01:48:11 2015 UTC,Don't buy any blessing with your Odin marks; you can trade for those. I'd save up the marks for the lvl 80 legendary if i where you
marvelheroes,39uspd,Helen_Kellers_Wrath,5,Mon Jun 15 16:56:48 2015 UTC,Buying blessings is pretty expensive right now.  Everyone is trying to save Odin marks for 80 legs.  If you have a lot of stuff you can trade it's still feasible but I doubt this person does.
marvelheroes,39uspd,dorn3,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"True, but many decent insignias, cores, or stark cubes can bring in a blessing and aren't too hard for a newer player to obtain.  The legendary you just got to grind out."

marvelheroes,39wpqp,BurnedOut_ITGuy,4,Mon Jun 15 12:39:14 2015 UTC,"Sitting close to double the number of 60s and I can honestly say what I do is to take (roughly) equally geared 60s that I enjoy through CMM and see which ones fair better with whatever build I am working on/enjoying most. As an example, last night Thing and Doom were my test subjects. Both are stupid powerful and can hold their own solo or grouped. I then took Mr. F.  who was geared nearly identical to thing and was getting creamed even after testing various builds. Finding all that out about various heroes IS fun to me. Otherwise if you aren't into raiding like the immortals guys do, I supposed you have collecting and achievement hunting as your WTF to do now. Honestly, you are going to have to make some fun. I am of the opinion that prestiging is only to get the costumes to throw in the blender. No one but you cares what color your name is in chat. There is sort of an end as with all ARPGs right?"

marvelheroes,39wpqp,Kingfield,-5,Mon Jun 15 12:46:10 2015 UTC,Having a lot of 60's means nothing though. I have friends with plenty of 60's who have no idea what to do or what they are doing like you. You can hit 60 in an hour in this game when you play at the right times. Leveling 1-60 doesn't mean anything.
marvelheroes,39wpqp,PraxusGaming,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:55:57 2015 UTC,I have no idea how you go 1-60 in an hour unless you've got a metric crap ton of XP boosts.  It took me 2 years so clearly that's not what I'm doing.
marvelheroes,39wpqp,Kingfield,3,Mon Jun 15 13:17:26 2015 UTC,"Server-side boosts (like the ones present for the anniversary event and Omega event) are a major part of it because they are multiplied by your XP boost.  Consumable items from the store are added to your synergy XP bonus.  If you have 200% synergy bonus, consume a green cup for 50% bonus and a 1-hour rush boost for 100% (both from Mk1 cards obtainable for free) and the server-side bonus is at 200%, you would be earning 13.5 times the normal XP rate.    100% base xp + 200% synergy + 50% cup + 100% rush bar = 450% = 4.5  (100% base xp + 200% server side bonus) x 4.5 = 13.5  Does it seem plausible now?"
marvelheroes,39wpqp,PraxusGaming,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:36:46 2015 UTC,"An hour is definitely an exaggeration. But I have about 12 lvl 60s in a bit over a month, and I've prestiged 5 separate times as well, only having used 2 energy bar boosts nd 1 potion boost (fortune card ones), and (roughly) 3?

I started back this last week after almost a year away and every hero up to Star-Lord was 60 so I had the 200% bonus and I kept up 750% in boosts. Every hero released after was a fresh level 1.  It took me starting out 2.5 hours at 22% just getting back into the swing of things for the first few heroes and time went down from there.  The last 2 heros I did in 90 min each at 150%ish.  I then prestiged SW from white to red in 45 min each prestige at 175%ish.  I almost decided to cosmic her... almost. Not ready to tackle that again, not just yet.  I leveled 11 heroes and prestiged 5 times last week. Never going over 750% in xp boosts. Server bonuses are a god send. It is all about maximizing what the devs give you.

The only thing you can possibly get here is guesses, unless a dev comments.  The only thing we know for sure is that the vendor can't go away until there's a patch (because it couldn't show up until there was a patch, they don't have the ability to add/remove NPCs without a patch).  So, at least you have until the next patch, which will probably be next Thursday or Friday.  Aside from that, nobody knows."

Magik, Angel, Domino, and Wasp have definitely been discussed as playable and are very likely to be made as such. Others like Coulson, Falcon, Havok, and Spider-Woman have also been mentioned as possibilities.  Quicksilver and maybe Carnage are the only ones they have said are unlikely to be playable due to issues with high speed heroes breaking the game and Carnage not exactly being heroic enough to qualify.

marvelheroes,39tthg,SplendidRS,-2,Sun Jun 14 19:15:05 2015 UTC,Spider-man was a team-up before he was playable? Utterly bizarre considering he's been Marvel's mascot since the 70's

marvelheroes,39twju,skywarpgreer,2,Sun Jun 14 23:29:56 2015 UTC,"As a She-Hulk main, I can tell you that she plays like none of the heroes you mentioned.  And as someone who loves playing her (I've written some guides on the forums), I can't give you a definitive answer because combo point heroes, by their very nature, are very love/hate. They revolve around building and spending your combo points as fast as possible. Some people find this is far too restrictive and limits what they can do (though every character at a high level is locked into a rotation), but others like me, find it fun.  It doesn't help that one of her moves that you would expect to be a high damage, great move, barrister beatdown, is actually a trap power that is both an animation lock and a dps loss. As someone on the forums put it, ""it is the destroyer of all fun.""  Play She-Hulk if you like brawlers who get up close in enemies' faces, has great dps, good aoe, a fast movement power, no spirit issues in combat, some nice utility moves (she has an irresistible stun and a burst heal), and the people's elbow.  Don't play She-Hulk if you want a character with dots (she has zero), low effort (she has a learning curve), want everything to fit conveniently on one skillbar (you'll have to use a second bar or mess around with some hotkeys), and hate combo point characters  Out of the combo point characters, she does the most damage, and has the best aoe thanks to having many area moves.   If you want some pointers, just hit me up in-game. I have the same username (mikwuyma).  Also Ohoni is correct, for whatever stupid reason, the devs didn't give her a passive at level 1, so she both has spirit issues and is quite squishy at low levels. The leveling experience becomes a lot better around level 20."
marvelheroes,39twju,mikwuyma,4,Mon Jun 15 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"She-Hulk got combo points like luke cage, so she's different then heroes you own. She's a lot like Ms.Marvel but you first build combo points then use spender skill."

As I got into the 20s though, and I put those +spirit Relics on her, she has plenty now, and really smashes good. i do wish she had more balance in her abilities though, only a few of them really seem worth using because of the ""build and burn combos"" mechanic.

marvelheroes,39twju,tso,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:24:19 2015 UTC,"I RNGed her recently and found her to be ok, but iffy to play.  This because she is very reliant on combos for her big hitters, and just about anything that will put her back a pixel or more will knock her out of animations.  Thus you may find yourself hitting the big hitter 2-3 times to get it to fire while facing down a bunch of MHG brutes or similar.  Oh, and either they upped the damage on energy attacks from mobs recently or she can't take being shot one bit."

I don't like the lawyer references, I don't like combo point systems, because it feels so punishing if you don't connect with that heavy hitter, but instead of punching the air.   She is not funny, she is not badass and her abilities feel very lackluster. One of the worst heroes (in my opinion) released in a very long time."

marvelheroes,39rtlu,oldmad,4,Sun Jun 14 08:12:30 2015 UTC,That doesn't really make much sense.  I mean I don't agree with no meters in raids but there's an actual argument there.  The training room already has the dummies though.  Why worry about adding a more accurate meter?
marvelheroes,39rtlu,dorn3,-6,Sun Jun 14 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"He should remove the ability to inspect people too then so people with no gear don't get denied from doing an axis raid. Seriously though not allowing dps meters is like choosing someone for a job based on the clothing they have on instead of their ability to do it. Dps meters would be a great thing for the game, they would force gaz to balance the heroes properly. Allowing private dps meters does no harm. I lose great respect for a dev that is too close minded and set in his ways to value the opinions of others. He should wake up and realize team's of people working on a product will generally produce a more well rounded enjoyable better experience."
marvelheroes,39rtlu,piwaele,8,Sun Jun 14 10:33:50 2015 UTC,So if he doesn't do everything you specifically want he's closed minded?

This is about a functional tool that would improve the game. I'm not advocating public dps meters.

Further I am critiquing someone who is clearly not balancing the opinions of others vs their own beliefs for the greater good and enjoyment of people who play this game.

marvelheroes,39rtlu,RushlockTwitch,3,Sun Jun 14 12:23:00 2015 UTC,What do you think TTK's are? All a dps meter would do is give you number to associate the damage with other then the time. As it stands you cannot fine tune a build without spending ridiculous amounts of time on training dummies. All dps meter would do is shorten the amount of time needed to test. Sig to sig or w/e instead of just getting a full ttk.   Also nothing prevents someone from just dragging you into training and making you do a TTK test on the dummy now.
marvelheroes,39rtlu,ahmida,-1,Sun Jun 14 16:28:18 2015 UTC,Except common sense.

marvelheroes,39rtlu,FreakZx1992,2,Sun Jun 14 14:02:26 2015 UTC,yea because filming kill times is not already a dps meter? You are calling people close minded when we already have a dps meter. All a dps meter would allow is a single screenshot instead of a video to showcase the characters DPS.

I could also include Damage Taken, Self Damage Taken, Healing as well...  I can include total hits, total crits, total bruts and stuff like that too.

For the last two years it has given me hell not having a true dps meter that i can test everywhere in the game.  Props to this man and I sure as hell hope you release it!
marvelheroes,39rtlu,Xenosaj,-7,Sun Jun 14 10:40:58 2015 UTC,"""people that are against it simply don't have to use it""   The problem here is that, whether you like or dislike the idea of a dps meter, if the people you're raiding with use it you have to use it. Or at least you will be expected to. You can kick and scream all you want...but that will just get you Gkicked and then you wont have anyone to raid with, 'cept the pug raiders. I'll give ya 2 guesses what their first question to you will be. ""What's your dps?""  The deal is, there is no one answer that will please everyone. One way or another, some players will never like whichever patch they choose.     Edit because a lot of you seem to think I'm against this: Please refer to This comment. You'll see that I am totally on board with an in game dps meter. That doesn't make my statements above any less true. One way or another someone gets burned with w/e decision Gaz makes on this."
marvelheroes,39rtlu,ddt9,3,Sun Jun 14 03:45:20 2015 UTC,"Edit: saw your other comment below in support of the meter, editing my comment here to try and not sound antagonistic towards you, since it's directed more towards the generic player who vehemently is against dps meters.  So what's stopping someone from finding other people who want to raid without using the dps meter?  Or if the situation is somehow magically where someone is the only person in the entire game who doesn't want to use the dps meter, why should Gaz and the playerbase cater to that one person?  Everyone who's against dps meters has no argument.  None.  All it's doing is holding back the people who are interested in improving their own performance in-game by crying about discrimination, as if that doesn't already and wouldn't continue to happen without a dps meter."
marvelheroes,39rtlu,Constriction,6,Sun Jun 14 06:18:51 2015 UTC,Why shouldn't you be kicked from a raid group if the shared goal is to win and you're tangibly contributing less than everyone else? DPS doesn't matter to anyone until there's not enough of it to kill bosses. That's when people look at the damage meter and make tough decisions.
marvelheroes,39rtlu,ddt9,0,Sun Jun 14 06:45:29 2015 UTC,"In theory. In practice, it becomes a minmum bar, even for easy content. See: Gear score in WoW"
marvelheroes,39rtlu,Mvmt_Productions,10,Sun Jun 14 12:34:20 2015 UTC,But gear score is basically what we have in Marvel Heroes right now. People can see if you've got all the BiS artifacts but have no way to see how you actually perform. A DPS meter is what lets you prove them wrong when you're behind on gear.

All that adds up.  I'm trying to gear out a new 60 right now, and despite having all 69, good artifacts, 5.8k omegas, they're still relatively weak; cuz the uniques I have atm aren't high rolls.    Totalling up what these poorly rolled uniques are short on comes out to around 1k hp, 2k defense, +500 dam, +200 crit/brut, and +5 to several skills.  Does that sound like its meaningful?"
marvelheroes,39rtlu,TehGrandWizard,-1,Sun Jun 14 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"A dps meter will be a poison pill in MH. I can understand people wanting it for personal use, but someone will find a way to make it a discriminator in PUGs, which will cause unwanted friction and turn off players who aren't powere gamers.   I fully support gazs no dps meter policy."
marvelheroes,39rtlu,pkt004,13,Sun Jun 14 15:01:40 2015 UTC,How is discriminating based on gear better than discriminating based on performance?
marvelheroes,39rtlu,ddt9,-6,Sun Jun 14 23:12:25 2015 UTC,"Nobody said anything about one being better or worse than the other. They are effectively the same anyway ie exclusion of players because of hero/gear/performance/etc  Yes, elitism already does exist in the game. Giving people a specific tool to figure out who's good/bad will simply make it easier to ""justify"" this"
marvelheroes,39rtlu,pkt004,7,Sun Jun 14 05:15:50 2015 UTC,"But someone with middling gear or an unpopular hero and natural ability can theoretically outperform someone with stronger gear or a ""high tier"" character. It's much better to be judged on the basis of what you actually do than what you could potentially do, and a DPS meter is the only tangible way to measure the former."
marvelheroes,39rtlu,ddt9,-2,Sun Jun 14 06:32:55 2015 UTC,Why should people be judged in the first place? That's the basis of elitism
marvelheroes,39rtlu,ArborDaze,3,Sun Jun 14 07:14:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think the basis of elitism is the material differences that already exist between people, from which judgment follows. Insofar as this is a discussion of marvel heroes, and not purely a philosophical digression, the basis of elitism already exists and is already happening- those with ilevel 69 gear will be quicker to cut someone with ilevel 60 gear than someone else with ilevel 69 gear, even though we have no basis of proving that the better geared player is actually outperforming. The people who would most benefit from damage meters would be those who are good at the game regardless of how long they have been playing or how lucky they have been with gear rolls."

marvelheroes,39rtlu,sicness9,9,Sun Jun 14 12:13:01 2015 UTC,"You have zero argument here.  You complain that people would use it to discriminate in-game against players who aren't as geared or can't put out the dps numbers, but this already occurs.  People have been asking for gear-checks for as long as Muspelheim has been out: full blessings, rank 5 legendary, throwing in relics and insignias and i69 gear as those items came out.  I never bother to check /lfg for pug raids since I have a guild that regularly raids together, but I imagine there's pugs out there now demanding level 80 legendaries just to do green Muspelheim.  Please tell me what exactly Gaz has done to curb this behavior, if preventing discrimination is their goal?  Please tell me how adding a dps meter will make the current situation any worse?  Literally the only reason to be against dps meters is because someone is a player who knows they suck or don't put forth the effort to be good and they know they'll get called out on it and won't get carried.  To which I say, fuck you, stop freeloading."
marvelheroes,39rtlu,pbk9,2,Sun Jun 14 07:21:06 2015 UTC,"Finally, Someone with common sense and actually see's the benefits of DPS meters. Whether the meter exists or not, people will still find some way to judge people for raiding or any other hard content.  And that last point you made is exactly correct. With out solid info that meters bring people wouldn't be able to better themselves, and the people against it are people who suck and don't care about improving their performance."

marvelheroes,39rtlu,SpeedHighway,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:11:32 2015 UTC,"My opinion on this... (other than release it and see what happens) is..  People are currently inspecting gear to determine if your good enough, and in most cases they require you to be OVERGEARED, so they know even if your a bad player, you'll still do respectable dps.  The DPS meter changes that, it allows them to ask for a specific dps, irregardless of gear.  John does 100,000 dps in his full Ilvl69,lvl80leg,full BIS gear.  Bob does 90,000 dps in his lvl 63gear,lvl 70 leg,not so top notch gear.  Right now... Bob isn't coming to the raid...  But if we knew that bob's dps was THAT close to Johns... we would start our re-thinking wouldn't we?  Also, as a side-note....not every hero can accurately TTK for many reasons...this allows people to show REAL WORLD circumstance's."

marvelheroes,39rtlu,Wiedzemir,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"You're thinking about it's uses wrong.  There's absolutely no way you can even tell by someone's DPS if they're a good player or not.  They can also lie.  Gear is tangible.  It shows that people have at least put time and effort into making themselves better.  I like the idea of the meter for the reason someone mentioned.  You can tell what items or omegas are better objectively.  Spending a few minutes on a dummy, and swapping an item, and spending another few minutes will tell you which item is better."
marvelheroes,39rtlu,nottraceable,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:59:27 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with this is that according to some posts, the code is injected. :(  However, I think a dps meter is a very good thing for this game.  Right now the only thing we have to measure dps is a crappy dummy that doesn't even take all types of damage into account, and I say this as a guy who has submitted multiple ttk videos.  If I want to compare two pieces of gear, it will be way easier to compare with a dps meter, rather than trying some ttk tests or going through the tedium of entering all of my stats into a spreadsheet to compare two pieces of gear. As useful as Walken's tool is, it's tedious to input all the numbers.  If the developers want a dps standard in the game (which they haven't specified btw), then a dps meter would only help them. It's blatantly obvious that the character balance in this game is awful both ttk and ttl-wise (though it's better than it was pre-tuning pass).  I can understand why gaz doesn't want public dps meters, though I don't agree with it 100%. They don't want elitism or people excluding others. However....  Have you all seen trade and lfg chats? People show off gear and gear check there ALL THE TIME. Elitism is not a product of dps meters, it's a byproduct of human nature, and maybe dps meters will make it more blatant, but it's not like dps meters themselves are elitist.  BTW, people gear check in raids not really out of elitism, they just want the raid to get done in a timely manner. Gear checking does seem elitist, but it's the best way (if a crappy way) to determine whether people are ready for raids or not.  P.S. When I mean raids, I'm not talking about Green Muspelheim because lol we've carried a level 26 squirrel girl in a supergroup raid we did. :D"
marvelheroes,39rtlu,ArborDaze,-2,Mon Jun 15 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"Please no. I played enough games plagued by DPS meters, absoption meters, all sort of meters which usually have little to do with an ability to kill a certain boss but introduce a lot of unnecessary drama."

marvelheroes,39rtlu,Xenosaj,5,Mon Jun 15 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"Green raids are only for top dps is the most hilarious thing I've ever seen, heh. It's so easy to do greens with like half the raid being totally new.  I really never understood people with that mindset. I was in Ultron mode the other day, and one of the guys was clearly on his first 60. No blessings, nothing at all on his costume. Everyone is yelling at him like he is at fault for wanting to try this new option he saw open up at 60. It's embarrassing, honestly. Times like that are a good opportunity to actually socialize with someone on this multiplayer game, help them out a bit, and maybe make a friend. Novel idea, I know."

marvelheroes,39rtlu,mikwuyma,-3,Sun Jun 14 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"Gear = qualitative and imprecise   TTK = subjective and somewhat random, and averaged over the fight  DPS meter = absolute and instantaneous, you either have the number or you don't.  It enables players to be much bigger elitist dicks, and it encourages players to stop focusing on the game and start focusing on squeezing a little infinitesimal more into the last 2 digits of their DPS.    The devs have shown they understand enough about gamer psychology to know you have to save gamers from themselves, there's always the drive to simplify the game and reduce it down to an on-screen number.  But the more you do that, the more your game just becomes Progress Quest.  That's why ES aren't ever going to be auto-pick, for example, or else they just become a stat that ticks up instead of a thing you get excited when you ""find"".  And that's why damage will always be something you see on-screen, as you're actually attacking, and not just summated in the corner of your screen when you're done."
marvelheroes,39rtlu,droid327,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:37:21 2015 UTC,"ES, omega points and relics aren't auto-picks because if they were, it would allow for idle-farming.  An afk Storm in a zone with repops (public zones in story mode, MM, IC...) could farm those non-stop without even needing a bot."
marvelheroes,39rtlu,_hov,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:34:07 2015 UTC,"I understand your reasoning, but I can't say I agree. Even without an instantaneous number, people still glom onto what they can, such as ttk numbers (Hulk 17 second ttk OMG!), or ilvl upgrades. They are plenty elitist about those already.  A dps meter would give people yet another way to be elitist, but it would also give people an actual, accurate method of measuring their dps, which I think everyone has wanted forever. Is there a tradeoff? Yes, but saying people aren't being elitist already is delusional. It is a shame that people can be elitist shitbags, but that happens in only...  ...every online game ever.  Even if Gaz does understand gamer psychology (and I'm not sure they do), I don't think they're saving gamers from themselves withholding a dps meter. To do that they would have kill the inspect function, ttk videos, and linking items in chat, and no one would like any of that."
marvelheroes,39rtlu,wotrick,-2,Sun Jun 14 13:48:07 2015 UTC,"No of course you're not going to cure elitism, but you can limit the tools people have.  Even with TTKs, you're only going to quote it within seconds, and even then there's maybe 5% variability in TTKs even for the same hero with the same rotation, so there's a question of granularity.  You wont see people comparing a 17.54 sec TTK to a 17.70.  That's not an issue with DPS meters.  It gives you an exact, precise number.  Maybe if the DPS meter was merely rank-order, you could get a ""Class 10"" rating if you were among the highest 10% of sustained DPS.  But giving elitists extra sig-digs to epeen over allows them to exclude the 98th percentile instead of just the 90th."

With some spirit cost reduction and spirit on hit you can churn away with your minigun and mix in Foot Spikes/Gas bombs for some pretty good dps. I maxxed out Lil Deadpool for solo farming and then the req'd skills (more bullets, regen, god mode, Itsy Bitsy Bomb).  Tried melee, but more of a fan of ranged characters. I hear good things though.  He definitely still needs some work (52 review can't come soon enough). But it is a lot of fun now that the damage is there.
