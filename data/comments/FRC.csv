They obviously didn't just know all the things that there is to know when they started, so asking them could be a good way to start. Also, asking your mentors for guidance can't hurt. Try just inspecting your teams robots and ask about things which seem important/you want to learn more about. As you actually have them their, you can probably learn about different mechanisms better as you'll be able to actually see them. Try learning at the workshop only stuff that you could have trouble learning by yourself. This could help you be a bit more time efficient.   Also, I don't think you should really sweat it with the time limits you got. The season only really starts during January, and you got a load of time till then. You might even be able to learn stuff from other teams meanwhile, and if you decide to go to the Israeli off-season that can't hurt. If you stick to this and do it right, I have no doubt things will end up pretty good for ya.  Good luck!"
FRC,3dnevf,borbor11,8,Fri Jul 17 18:09:41 2015 UTC,"Team 148 released a drivetrain calculator a few years ago, and that's what we use for most of out math, ever for pickups and elevators. You plug in the motor(s) specs, and the gearing, it will give you the theoretical speed, actual speed, torque, and current load.  Edit: Found it, they call it the design calculator http://www.robowranglers148.com/resources.html"
FRC,3dnevf,TheFrozenSlink,2,Fri Jul 17 20:55:36 2015 UTC,I use a lot of thinking to figure this out. I take the engine rpm and run it through ratios for the gears. so a 20 tooth gear too a 40 tooth gear is a ratio of 1-2 or multiply the 2500 rpm by .5. i then find the rpm at the end of all the gears. after that i take the radius of our tires and multiply it by the rpm. This is how we find our theoretical top speed. Its a little un-precise but that's what small teams are known for.
FRC,3dnevf,truworld55,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:59:25 2015 UTC,"It's late and I'm tired and I just saw this, but if I remember tomorrow, I'll write a comment up here.  Edit: Alright, /u/borbor11 I remembered. This is actually a pretty broad question, so I'll start with a physics explanation. Let me know what questions come up after. Also, I'm going to just talk about the robot drivetrain for now, as you mentioned that specifically.  Let's talk about Energy. Specifically, as it relates to Mechanics. Energy is measured in joules. On the robot, you have Potential Energy (PE) stored in the form of the battery. That's great and all, but how do I use that Potential Energy? You have a motor, which converts the Potential Energy into Kinetic Energy (KE). That's the awesome thing about Energy, you can transfer it from one form to another. Different motors have different rates of transfer, this is the motor's Power. Power is measured in joules/second, also called a watt.  Now we know a little bit about Energy. How do we use that? The robot begins stationary, with 0 KE. All the Energy is currently stored as PE in the battery. Let's turn on the motors! Now we have begun turning the PE into KE and the robot starts moving. Let's get into some of the math now.  First, our variables: We have a robot that has a mass, let's call that mass MRobot. We also have a velocity the robot will be traveling at, let's call it VRobot.  Now, an equation: KE = 1/2 m * V2  What we want to know is the change in our KE. Finding our initial KE is easy, because our velocity  is zero. To find our final KE when the robot is travelling at its top speed, we plug in our variables to the equation and get KE = 1/2 MRobot * VRobot2. Finally, we do final KE - initial KE=change in KE.  This is where the motor power comes in. That KE comes from the conversion of PE into KE by the motors. There are some different things we can do in regards to the power and motors. 1) We can take motors we have and determine how long it will take to reach our final velocity by dividing the change in KE by the motor's power. By adding more motors to a single output, we can increase the total power output. 2) Another way we can go is figure out how long we want it to take to accelerate the robot. By dividing the change in KE by the amount of time we want it to take, we can get a value for power. We can use that power value to determine what motor(s) to use.  Ideally, you would always get to do option 2, and have exactly the right motors for the job. Sometime, you find that you have to work with what's lying around and would use option 1.  Let me know what more questions you have. And anyone who see's any errors I made, please please please point it out.  P.S. Hopefully the formatting works as I intend...  Edit 2: The formatting did not work as intended, but it's fixed now!"

Helping rookie teams are always a high interest to any veteran team.  As for more parts though: You'll obviously need a computer, but also a laptop to run the driver station and load code on and off the robot.

Although they do not have a ""buy everything I need"" package available, you'll find that most of the components are cheaper than andymark. If things are listed as out of stock, give them a call. During summer then usually have unlisted stock on the shelves. I would suggest building a versachassis with a WCP SS Gearbox. If you want I can give you a buy list of what went into our chassis this year.   I would also remind you to consider the tools you will need to put these chassis together, T handle allen wrenches and a drill with a nut driver go a long way, especially when putting together andymark's hi grip wheels. (Its torture to do the self tapping screws with hand tools.)  You seem most nervous about the programming, but I have personally found that FRC is much more of a mechanical design competition than a programming competition. There are teams that are very successful that run very basic code but have excellent mechanical design. You won't be able to make up for mechanical design flaws with better programming, but you can make your programming simple by making your mechanisms easy to control. If you want a quick start to getting a running robot, use labview."

Heck, my high school didn't offer AP courses for any anything in the Science/Tech fields, only Math/English/History. I didn't get any exposure to 'real' engineering until college.

We didn't have any funds or knowledge; we basically started from scratch. I had no clue what I was doing, none of my classmates or teachers did either. All I knew was robots are awesome. So maybe that's the problem - maybe there just needs to be some outreach or mentorship in NE by someone familiar with FIRST who can pollinate their knowledge around.  Anyways, the University of Nebraska has the CEENBoT program which was by far the easiest option I found, and what we ended up doing. The University was VERY supportive in helping us get set up as a team - they found us a mentor and let us use their space to build parts of our robot (my HS was ~10min away). I think most high schools and middle schools in NE that have robotics programs do CEENBoT.   I mentored an FRC team in SC this year and it did make me insanely jealous that we didn't have FRC when I was in high school.

If your team is looking for a mechanically simple, programmatically sophisticated solution, then having both sides independently powered would be the way to go. This mention is a little bit more difficult on the programming because it'll require the use of some sensors to make sure that both sides are in sync.   If your team is looking for a mechanically sophisticated, programmatically simple solution, then having both sides coupled together in one system would be better. This solution can be more mechanically complex, there are a number of ""off-the-shelf"" solutions that currently exist (look at Ri3D from this past season).   Personally, I would recommend you connect the elevator to one chain in the middle. It sort of gets you the best of both worlds."

FRC projects are very technically complex, but from a PM standpoint, they are relatively simple and short term - the PM doesn't need to know about the specifics of the electronics, or exactly what is happening in mechanical, just that it's happening. For most teams, the software brings in more complexity than it's worth, not to mention trying to get people to actually use it.  I'm not a PM, but I feel like using general cloud software (such as Google Drive) and just establishing some simple forms and whatnot (or even paper...) is much more efficient, manageable, and approachable for most teams.  If you want to look into it, I would go to PM related sites or forums that deal more directly with this sort of thing. I would think such places exist, and could probably give you much better advice than (most) FRC people can."
FRC,3cxy39,Necroterra,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"I personally have found that most PM software is too cumbersome for FRC purposes, you're going to spend all your time learning to use the program, and even more time updating the program to keep it accurate. Not usually worth it. Even in industry PM software creates more work for everyone, the major benefit is that it helps everyone keep track of multiple long term projects better and also generates more specific metrics for management to evaluate and optimize.   We use Xmind on our team (https://www.xmind.net/). It lets you create mind maps very quickly and easily and is extremely flexible. We use it to generate our outlines and organizations charts as well as plan our offseason training. All our timing is done manually on a ""as fast as you can"" basis. One thing that xmind does help us keep track of is the critical path, and basically we simply push as hard as we can on whatever happens to be holding up the critical path. We usually print out the stuff we make and post it in our build area.   Xmind basic version is free, download it and poke around. Just remember, no software is going to solve your management problems, you should probably develop a solution/system on your own, then find a program to match."

I think it was free although it took us a while to get - we had to jump through some hoops to use our school's 501c3, and then some more time on top of that. In my personal opinion it isn't worth it. FRC goes through members/mentors relatively quickly compared to most businesses, and most of them don't spend 40 hours a week doing FRC. This makes training and knowledge of the software a lot harder to retain.Plus I'd say we don't use 90% of the features of the ecosystem. 365 DOES have a selection of cool, useful features for FRC teams, however. We use it for purchase requests, document sharing/editing, and permission slips/trip management. All of these have their pros and cons. Probably the only thing that was by far a net pro was a custom email address for every team member and mentor - jsmith@teamname####.org for mentors and john.smith@teamname####.org for students.The other stuff is useful once you get acclimated, but getting kids and mentors used to it takes up so much time. Plus, a lot of the time people won't even use it and will just go back to their regular, non-365 tools like google docs, gmail, etc. If your team is already disorganized, something like 365 probably isn't for you. I'd suggest a host of Google solutions - creating an Group to use with emails, Google Docs for file hosting and document editing, and a text-reminder service like cel.ly or Remind (alternatively, GroupMe is good for smaller groupchats like subteams)."

Also, if you can avoid pneumatics that saves a TON of weight. we haven't used them for many years now. you'd be amazed how all the pneumatic parts start adding up. it may be more difficult to do but worthwhile."
FRC,3cweov,sanels,2,Sat Jul 11 10:24:09 2015 UTC,"Pneumatics can save weight depending on your application.

FRC,3cweov,sanels,2,Sat Jul 11 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"often welding isn't a good solution. It often makes things more inaccessible and much harder to repair. you can't just re-weld a broken joint between two matches. Additionally, if you do use lighter weight structure and materials, welding will become rather difficult anyway. In the end though I wouldn't really say it's a big weight savor."
FRC,3cweov,ThadToTheMax,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"It depends on the application. Take the case of putting a box tube, open-box-end against a plate. Riveting or bolting would require an insert to the box tube or external brackets. They take up space, weight, and complications. However, welding adds relatively little material, and is thus the better solution (Assuming warping isn't an issue for whatever odd reason).  Now, if you had to fasten a box tube's face against a plate, drilling holes and inserting rivets would be the simplest solution, still be serviceable, possibly just as strong (if not, add more rivets), and doesn't pose the risk of warping.  You need to consider what pieces you're working with. Sometimes welding can produce stronger, lighter and simpler pieces, other times it just makes serviceability much harder."

The added benefit of this is that after you do this for a season or two, you now have a baseline of what the actual weight of the robot can be; like you'll know you have to allot roughly 20-25lbs to drive, 10 for actual structure, I guess like 5ish now a days for electronics... And, from this spreadsheet, you can mark out critical components and components that can be modified to weigh less."

We used to use 80/20 extrusion for absolutely everything except the kit c-channel drivebase. A lot of people will tell that 80/20 is heavy, but it's actually lighter than 1x1x0.125 square tubing. The problem is that it's so versatile that if you're not careful, you can get lazy and just say ""Ah don't worry about it, just strap some 80/20 on"". When that happens, the design starts getting more and more inefficient.  Ditching 80/20 and planning things more carefully took us from this, pushing the weight limit and falling over due to top-heavyness, to this which was at least 10 pounds underweight, with only minimal swiss-cheesing"

We built our catapult out of it last year and it held up the whole season under some pretty rough stresses.  80/20 can be very effective when used sparingly and in smart ways. My FTC team uses pieces of it where we need a number of things to join at right angles (because you can bolt into every side of it if you tap the ends).   CADing and really designing and thinking before you build will save you a ton of weight, and keep you from taking the easy way of just throwing extrusion at the problem until it all works."

Last year we used the AM14U, and this year we built our own out of the 1x2x0.125  80/20 is overkill for a lot of things, especially simple framing/chassis structure.   This year we did use the 1x2 (which is 0.125 wall) for almost the whole robot, but we actually wanted a bit of extra weight to make sure we counterbalanced the totes on the front of the bot.  As a side note, ""1/25"" is not a true fractional size, 0.040 is the correct notation. Fractional inch sizes go by factors of two (1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, etc)."

FRC,3cweov,TeamSoloMidfanboii,2,Sun Jul 12 17:02:55 2015 UTC,"I'm aware. But when it comes to dimensions, how you write it matters. ""1/25"" is not a term that anyone in real engineering/machining uses.  When you're working in inches, there are two ways of expressing sizes: Decimal and fractional.  Decimal is obvious, you just represent the dimension as an inch with decimal places: 0.001, 0.500, 0.250, etc  Fractional is more complicated. You can't just use any fraction. All fractions must be some factor of two: 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64. And if it's anything smaller than 1/64, you usually just go to decimal. You can combine them and get fractions like 3/4, 3/8, 5/32, 9/64, etc. But the way fractional inch works, you can't deviate from the ""factor of two"" rule. As a result, this chart contains every fractional inch size. It's just the rules of how it works. Not saying it's a good thing or that I like it, but it is how it is.  So since 1/25 isn't a factor of two, and isn't on that chart, it's not a size that is expressed as a fraction, and as such 0.040 is the correct way of writing it, and the only way you'll see real engineers and machinists express it.  Not trying to be a jerk or anything, just teaching ;)"
FRC,3cweov,sanels,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:38:02 2015 UTC,"+1 for versaframe. We keep thicker wall thicknesses of the 1x1 and 2x1 if we run into issues, but overall the super light weight 1x1 is a miracle.   We cut a pound or two out of our robot by replacing some 5/16"" steel bolts with aluminum bolts. Use rivets wherever you can, and if you must use bolts, use bolts that are the length you need, not the length you had lying around. Another hindsight thing for our team this year was to design with fewer bearings, use bushings or even just have bare bolts through holes for less critical mechanisms. FRC robots don't need to last forever as long as you anticipate what items are going to wear and replace them in a timely fashion. You can offload weight by having 5 spares of a part that is technically not strong enough, as long as it can make it through a 2 minute match, (depending on the rules for bringing spares to competition that year)."

I was the Lead Videographer and Editor for every highlight reel we have done, I'm off to college out of state this fall though.  Here is the thing about DJing, it isn't anything fancy, mainly because we don't have the equipment for it or a skilled person. We just load Spotify and play anything that is not explicit or implicating of anything not appropriate. If you have skills and the equipment it will be really easy to join and get the position at an event. Just explain your background in DJing and what you would be able to do in the comments section when signing up for an event. Doing more and more events will allow you to gain the trust of the TD and the volunteer coordinator.

I have been a Volunteer Coordinator for a few of our FIRST events the last two years and hope to help out again in this role this year. We do not have a DJ role per sé because as the others have said, we usually use a Spotify or XBox Music playlist of approved music. However, that's not to say that the conversation can't be opened with FIRST WA about having a DJ.   What I would do is PM me your email address and I can put you in touch with our event coordinator and our head volunteer coordinator. They can work with you to figure out how to best use your services and which volunteer position is right to assign you to as DJ (VIMS doesn't have this role).  Can you run other sound equipment in addition to music equipment? (I'm assuming yes, but I figured I'd ask. If so, Audio Lead may be a good place to apply to volunteer through VIMS.)  Additionally, starting with FLL and FTC qualifiers and Interleague competitions, respectively, may be a good place to start at a basic level. Get registered in VIMS regardless so we don't have any YPP screening issues with your profile.

Well, I volunteered for A/V crew and ran music for the past two years for PNW district events and since I'm moving off to New York for college and thus not be doing PNW events anymore, I might as well be transparent.  Honestly, I just asked. A year ago, whoever was in charge of controlling the audio on A/V crew was running a default FIRST playlist on shuffle off of Xbox Music, and I just asked if I could play some music off of Xbox Music too.  Except, you're asking specifically to be in charge of DJ'ing your own music, but they haven't hired DJs for district events in the past, however I've seen them do so for districts champs. So you could try to use VIMS but unless you want to end up running Xbox Music like I was doing I say just ask, shoot the people at the FIRSTWA or Oregon FIRST offices an email, and you might want to ask pretty soon, since they tend to plan ahead and you might have to go through logistical stuff. Be prepared to get questioned about what kind of music you'd play because they're big on keeping music G-rated.  I hope you do end up DJ'ing some events, because Xbox Music is terrible to use."

Creating and populating the SendableChooser  Basically, all the SendableChooser object is is a list of objects, each paired up with a String. First, initialize the object:  SendableChooser dogChooser = new SendableChooser();   Then, add some objects to your chooser:  dogChooser.addObject(""Max"", new Max()); dogChooser.addObject(""Bella"", new Bella()); dogChooser.addObject(""Shadow"", new Shadow());   You might want to add a default option, like so:  dogChooser.addDefault(""Sparky"", new Sparky());   This is some weird robot where you have a bunch of different classes for different named dogs. Please do not actually do it this way, a proper implementation would be something more like this:  Dog shadow = new Dog(""Shadow""); dogChooser.addDefault(shadow.name, shadow);   You can also add any different type of object or enum to the chooser:  dogChooser.addObject(max.name, max); dogChooser.addObject(""Solenoid1"", new Solenoid()); //might need params, doesn't really matter here dogChooser.addObject(""AutoEnumState"", AUTO.SOME_ENUM_VALUE);   However, this can be dangerous later on, as you might accidentally send solenoids where dogs go and such.  Getting the values from the SendableChooser  In order to manipulate the Chooser, you need to actually send it to SmartDashboard:  SmartDashboard.putData(""Dog Chooser"", dogChooser);   You can now hit any of the radio buttons on the dashboard, and then call this method in your code:  Object currentDog = dogChooser.getSelected();   Now, I have currentDog set up as an Object, because java will yell at you if there's a possibility for trying to make a Solenoid your dog (or any improper type casting). If you want the program to know your dog is a dog, do this (again, this is Java, and this part is probably different in C++):  Dog currentDog = (Dog) dogChooser.getSelected();   Now you have a dog!  There are lots of more complex things you can do, such as more rigorous type checking (although this sort of thing is rarely useful or necessary in FRC, I just want to show some of the things you can look into):  Object chosenDog = dogChoose.getSelected(); if(chosenDog instanceof Dog){     currentDog = (Dog) dogChooser.getSelected(); } else {     System.out.println(""You tried to select something that isn't a dog!""); }   A real example program, where we are adding Commands and CommandGroups to the chooser  public class Robot extends IterativeRobot {    SendableChooser autoChooser = new SendableChooser();   Command autonomousCommand;    public void robotInit(){     //stuff     autoChooser.addDefault(""Wait"", new Wait());     autoChooser.addObject(""ThreeTote"", new ThreeTote());     autoChooser.addObject(""CanBurglar"", new CanBurglar());     SmartDashboard.putData(""Autonomous Mode:"", autoChooser);   }    //stuff    public void autonomousInit(){     autonomousCommand = (Command) autoChooser.getSelected();     if(autonomousCommand != null){       autonomousCommand.start();     }   } }   Sorry if this is confusing at all, I'll do my best to clarify."

FRC,3c4t1w,Matt_FRC,5,Sat Jul 4 23:09:35 2015 UTC,"Grinder wheels don't seem like great weapons conpared to spinners, since you would need to be in contact for a long time to do significant damage.

What about some high-strength cable Ramos, almost like the ropes to a boxing ring, just around the bot, that could quickly disconnect in case of impact? That would discourage spinners, of which there are many."
FRC,3c4t1w,jritenburgh,2,Thu Jul 9 04:46:30 2015 UTC,"This might help you out.   In about half the matches, both robots survive the three minutes; at that point, three judges distribute a total of 45 points (15 points a judge, 5 points per judge per category) over three categories. The robot with the higher score wins. The judging categories are Aggression, Strategy, and Damage. A robot who hangs back safely from its opponent will not get many Aggression points; one in there fighting the whole time, however, will. The Strategy category is about how well a robot exploits its opponent's weaknesses, protects its own, and handles the hazards. A robot driving over the kill saws will lose points here, unless it had good reason to do so, while a robot that is able to attack its opponent's weak areas will gain points. The Damage category is for how much damage the bot can deal to its opponent while remaining intact itself."

For our robots, There is no monetary benefit, safety benefit, or power gain with lithium vs our current lead acid.

FRC,3c57b1,funk_wagnall,3,Tue Jul 7 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"Based on my limited research it seems like some of the battlebot's hydraulic pumps are powered by gasoline engines. Also the components are magnitudes more expensive than pneumatic components. Hydraulic systems are filled with oil which is a pain to clean up and otherwise manage. Even if hydraulics were legal I would likely stick with pneumatic systems.  Let us also consider the differences between battlebots and FRC. The battlebots field is completely surrounded by clear shielding, possibly even capped. They have to run around 12 matches for an episode, so they can afford to spend time cleaning the field between matches. The robots are built by (somewhat) professionals over a longer period of time and the mechanisms are generally more simple.   I'm really just amazed that FRC hasn't had any serious injuries (that I have heard of). I completely expected 2014 to be the year that someone got their head taken off by a high powered shooter firing at the wrong time.   I have wished that FRC would legalize many components (quick exhaust cylinder fittings, check valves, some basic air logic components). But I have never wished for hydraulics or more battery power."

After the first day of Worlds, my team got outside pretty quickly, where we waited for our pit and drive teams. During this time, I got a few other guys on my team to give everybody high-fives as they left the building.  My dad (team mentor) pointed out a sign on a nearby coach bus (you know those signs that usually say where they bus is going/from). The driver had written ""I'm not lost, I just like driving in circles.""  Because this bus driver was awesome, and I was having WAY too much fun, I motioned for a high-five and he opened the door. I got on the bus and gave him a high-five, then gave high-fives to two mentors sitting in the front seats. Once again, having way too much fun, I then decided to give high-fives to everybody on the bus. So I did.  I had no idea who was on this bus, only that it was a FIRST team... until a few weeks after Worlds.

I once dealt with a team that needed to reboot the whole computer every time they plugged in an ethernet cable because the dongle would drop out as a device and not get re-noticed by Windows  Back to your laptop: I am going to go out on a limb and say your adapter is not fried. It may be, but it usually takes more than an update and a small mDNS network to kill it. What does ipconfig print out in the command prompt (both with and without a network connected to the computer)? What is the status of the network adapter (in Network and Sharing)? Have you tried disabling and re-enabling the adapter? I know you tried getting around this with Linux, but did you try to update the drivers after the event?

Have you tried uninstalling the driver for the device, or rolling back to an old driver? It likely isn't a driver issue if linux also didn't like it.  Does anything change when booting into safe mode WITH NETWORKING? i.e. does it show up in control panel?  What did you determine in linux? Did dmesg |tail have useful output? What did ifconfig show?   Finally to answer you question, I have seen a few teams use USB to Ethernet adapters, all with success. One team had an issue on the field.

FRC,3bq993,simpsonboy77,2,Fri Jul 3 16:52:07 2015 UTC,My team has used one for our previous few years as our main competition computer's Ethernet port is very wonky and the cord used to fall out. We searched around and eventually purchased a JUE 130 (asking each other if we have the JUE and if the JUE is plugged in and if the JUE is how leads to some strange looks from other drive teams) which works fantastic. It keeps the cords all in place plugged in and we haven't had a problem of our Ethernet cords falling out since we got it. You just need to make sure you remember it each round at a competition.
FRC,3bq993,bengineered,2,Wed Jul 1 09:40:07 2015 UTC,"If you want to go for a new Ethernet adapter, make sure that you also get a hub if you have 3 joysticks.  Our team also uses a female to female Ethernet adapter wired to the Ethernet port to keep stress off of it when tethering the robot at practice. I doubt that was your problem though.  Edit: You appear to also have a non-Classmate DS based on your screenshot. What laptop is it?"
FRC,3bq993,connstark,2,Wed Jul 1 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"The ethernet ports get dirty, weird things happen around the pits and competition.  Best insurance policy is to get a usb to ethernet adapter.  Pretty cheap and easy to set up.  I haven't seen any fail in competition and teams usually buy a spare since they are cheap.  The only other thing you to do to prevent this is to use an Ethernet Pigtail to help save the physical port."

FRC,3bo8cg,UniverseCity,22,Tue Jun 30 22:14:09 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, at competitions, you're representing yourself as well as your team, town, state, etc. Even though you or your teammates may be fine swearing, others may not care for it as much. As for in the shop, as long as people aren't being obnoxious or inappropriate, I don't think its that big of a deal."
FRC,3bo8cg,avanboekel11,13,Tue Jun 30 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"If you ask me, as long as you're among friends, you're fine.  Competitions, anyone not on the team present, hold back.    Granted, you are asking for MY opinion, not the opinion of the team I was on.  Swearing was generally frowned upon until the last ten or so days before bag & tag, then everyone was too frenzied to care.  I didn't like this mentality, because the amount of crap I got for saying ""dammit"" a few times was ridiculous when compared to much more important problems going on in that shop...  I had a friend drop an f-bomb in the pits (rather loudly) after getting shot in the face with a Frisbee during Ultimate Ascent.  Everybody was too busy laughing at him to call out his language, though."
FRC,3bo8cg,Anthyman1,7,Wed Jul 1 01:31:53 2015 UTC,"Like most things in life, it's all about context. Your team might allow swearing in the context of your shop. But when guests come in to see how it's going, the context changes.   Same at home. Siblings might swear at each other when the parents aren't around, but they're usually more careful with the parents home. Context.  Some coaches and mentors might not care when no parents are around, then a parent walks in and suddenly it's not allowed. Context.  Most people under 18 don't get to define their context very often. Most of the places they go are defined by someone else. That includes the shop, the comp, the hotel, the bus/van/car you ride in.   It sucks because you want to be yourself and you know you're old enough to swear without hurting anyone. But it's not until you get your own space that you can start defining your own context. Until then, you just have to deal with what others allow. Or you can try and change their minds.   Maybe ask for 1 free swear word a day. All the others cost a dollar.  Maybe ask for a quality vote, where your team gets to vote on whether your swear was justified/funny/hurtful to others.  All they can do is say no."
FRC,3bo8cg,legolad,12,Wed Jul 1 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it doesn't matter quite so much at home as it does at the competition. When you're there, your behavior is a reflection of the team. If you wouldn't put it on the website where your sponsors can see it, you probably shouldn't say it at the competition."
FRC,3bo8cg,auxiliary-character,5,Tue Jun 30 22:18:15 2015 UTC,Our coach didn't even care as long as no F-Bombs were dropped and we didn't do it in front of other non-team people

I think I owe the team like... $600 because of interest now. I'm pretty sure on my last day as a student, I tried to rack up us much as I could, while in casual conversation.  As a mentor, I try not to swear, unless it is really necessary. (Bandsaw blade breaks, I'm probably gonna yell an expletive)  If you are going to swear, do it in the shop, with no one (non team related) around. Don't swear at the competition.   LifeProTip: If you can expand your vocabulary, and instead of using swear words, replace that with an appropriate word. People will think you are smarter. And then when you DO choose to use curse words, they hold more emphasis."
FRC,3bo8cg,nighterfighter,2,Wed Jul 1 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"Both at my school and on my team, swearing is very much tolerated, so I'm personally of the belief that you can say whatever in the privacy of your own workspace as long as you aren't hurting anyone.  That said, you need to respect the rules of your team. If you want the rules to change, you should take it up with the appropriate authorities on your team. Also, what do yellow cards mean on your team? Is it a safety thing, because if it is, it seems like an abuse of power to threaten to yellow card someone for mild swearing. If yellow cards aren't a safety thing, why does your Safety Captain have the authority to issue them?"
FRC,3bo8cg,Walripus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"At competition I can see a reason for it to be held back, but apart from that, not really. Then again, it really comes down to context. ""What the fuck"" might be okay, but when that word becomes directed at someone I can see a cause for intervention.    The whole ""The can-grabber's bad-ass"" is a pretty silly reason to get Yellow-Carded though. As far as I'm concerned, don't be a dick and you should be fine."

They need letterhead and shirts and put banners. They need robot decals. If you go for the Chairman's Award, you need a movie.   The point of FIRST is to change the culture so that STEM careers are celebrated. The goal of FIRST is NOT to make everyone engineers. Non-Engineering FIRSTers are a huge part of the program, and are essential to FIRST's goals. FIRST needs people like will.I.am to spread our message and grow.   NEFIRSTers can recognize and celebrate the achievements of their engineering peers without ever touching the robot. As a NEM, I HATE the suggestion (and I've heard it many times) that because I didn't go into STEM that I'm a failure. It's bad enough that I will never even be seriously considered for a Woodie Flowers Award and there isn't a NEM equivalent.

First of all, this is not an article about FIRST; this is an article about the Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy program at Dos Pueblos High School. While  FIRST has certainly been a part of the program, the program goes well beyond  FIRST. For example, 10th graders in DPEA work on a project labeled  ""Engineering Sculpture and Design"". In my opinion, this is a great integration of art and engineering and (as an educational program) should not be considered ""unproductive""."

FRC,3bf1vj,waffle_dynasty,10,Sun Jun 28 17:16:59 2015 UTC,"Experiment with students and mentors, see what works best for you. Mentors tend to be a long-term choice, because they can carry that experience forward, but there are also teams who have been somewhat successful with student drive coaches. I would say, pick the person who is best for the role, whether they're a student or mentor. Don't artificially cut off your options.  Two important attributes you might consider when you're selecting someone are their aptitude for strategy, and their ability to pay attention to several things at once. They need to watch what all six robots are doing, point out opportunities for their drivers, communicate with other drive coaches, and decide if a robot on their alliance needs to change it up. If your robot isn't generally scoring a lot of points, they may also need to give your driver strategic advice on playing defensively. If you're a young team who doesn't have much experience making powerful shooters or manipulators, a drive coach who can help drivers play a really strong defense game can virtually guarantee you a place in the eliminations, as long as next year's game involves interaction between robots.   It also helps if they can keep a cool head under pressure, or can count points in their head. This year especially, it was easy to lose your cool trying to keep up in points, and take an unnecessary risk causing your alliance to lose. A drive coach who could go ""Don't worry, we have enough points to go to the next round, take it easy"", because they had the points counted in their head, was a very valuable asset this year."
FRC,3bf1vj,1diehard1,7,Sun Jun 28 18:24:14 2015 UTC,"Just as a counter-example. If you look at most of the perennial powerhouse teams they all have mentor drive coaches. The reason is because everything that coach has learned is passed on to each drive team. This goes on for generations of drive teams. It's the same reason I'd always recommending having a mentor that knows software, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering on any new team. Because that/those mentors will learn from the trials of the team and be better able to inspire the next generation with a better robot/process."
FRC,3bf1vj,oses,3,Sun Jun 28 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"You just need to make sure the drivers have respect for the Drive coach, and that the drive coach knows the robot from head to toe. This years, our team had a senior drive and Junior gunner (me), and a Junior Coach. Obviously, the both of us didn't have respect for said drive coach. This year we didn't have very much time to practice driving a robot so we picked the only two people in the whole club that actually knew the robot head to toe to drive and we then just assigned two people to be the coach and the human player. The driver and I were also the only programmers in the club and the only people who know how the electronics work(And the only knows who knew how to fix wiring problems). No one else in the club had spent enough time around the robot to actually know its full functionality. TL;DR Make sure the drive coach is a respectable person who knows what the heck they're doing."

FRC,3bf1vj,Walripus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:24:57 2015 UTC,"Drive coach was one of those kids that always have one finger in their mouth and the other on their phone. ;) The person was really chosen randomly, they didn't have anything important to do at the competitions so they were just assigned to be a coach. They even went missing for a couple of matches and we had to replace them with another person."
FRC,3bf1vj,ShadowLoki99,3,Mon Jun 29 05:19:15 2015 UTC,"Drive coaches serve a variety of roles on the drive team. Its not uncommon for teams make the drive coach the primary shot-caller during the matches since it takes a lot of stress off the drivers. I think if there is a student that is significantly better at shot-calling and playing the game then you should go with the student. However, most of the time an adult is more suitable for this job simply because the FRC field can get heated, and you want someone that is mature and calm to deal with unforseen situations or angry alliance partners.   Some attributes that make a good drive coach in game is decisive and clarity in making decisions (i.e. making the driver understand clearly what the coach wants), having good situational awareness (i.e. Which RC should we be getting for our next stack), and intimate knowledge of robot functionalities (i.e. it takes us 50 seconds on average to build a stack of 6, we do not have enough time to keep stacking totes and must go score now)."
FRC,3bf1vj,TeamSoloMidfanboii,2,Mon Jun 29 00:59:10 2015 UTC,Students being on drive team is more relaxed and fun.  Of course my team has a student coach and we made it to be finalists in Galileo so you can do very well
FRC,3bf1vj,JEEntertainment89,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:22:46 2015 UTC,"As a driver of two years I've seen a good mix of student and mentor coaches, and I think it's important to forget about other teams and focus on what works with you. It's very easy to say ""x team uses a mentor and they made it to Einstein so we should use a mentor."" So just decide what works with your team. If you choose a student it should be one that had experience as a driver, just so they understand how it is behind the wall and how strategy meetings work. If it's a mentor it should be someone who will stick around for a while and is easy to talk to, friendship is very important in FIRST, and friendships that last longer are typically better.   If a drive coach betters the robot's performance if debatable. The only way to improve performance is with practice. If you look at top teams not often than not the drivers are going without instruction and the drive coach is helping out their alliance members."
FRC,3bf1vj,BriteBacon,2,Mon Jun 29 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it benefits everyone on the team for there to be all students on the drive crew. The coach should be able to make quick decisions and solve problems quickly. They should be the one telling the driver what they should do, and the driver should listen, no questions asked. As i said before, these are just in my opinion what the role of a coach should be. God knows my team does not follow this. I cri evrytim."
FRC,3bf1vj,robonerd16,-5,Sun Jun 28 17:28:50 2015 UTC,"Well having a student be the coach is the most respectable thing to do, not that having a mentor do it is bad.... It's just that a lot of teams look down upoun that. Honestly, most of the qualities a good coach needs are ones that a previous driver has. You need a good understanding of the maneuverability of the robot and how matches play out. I'd pick a former driver (if you guys have one)."

However, if you want to really simulate what your pneumatics will do when mounted on the robot you need to use the compressor that will be on your robot (NOTE: the compressor wont work without the pressure sensor plugged in on the board and code to turn it on running on the controller). Before we mounted anything on the robot we assembled it off the robot. Another thing is that all your tubing should be cut to the proper length (too short is just as bad as too long) its MUCH easier to troubleshoot leaks when everything is neat and tidy."

I don't think you can expect to get into good schools just because of FIRST - your record in academics (GPA, coursework, test scores, etc.) is always going to be more important. But it's definitely a good selling point, and something I always brought up in interviews, and of course in my essay! Plus, scholarships are nice! If there are any FIRST scholarships you can use for your major or your school, don't skip out on applying for them."
FRC,3ag6ib,alienbanter,5,Fri Jun 19 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"FIRST really helped me when writing my application essays and doing interviews. And I (and another alum of my FIRST team) are going to MIT now, so I feel like it definitely helped with that! Obviously grades, test scores, service, other extracurriculars, etc are way more important than just FIRST, but FIRST really gives you lots of experience to talk about in the aforementioned essays and such, and a connection to people who've also been involved in FIRST. Colleges are aware of the kind of edge being involved in something like FIRST entails. Definitely make sure you look at the FIRST scholarships page and see if you're eligible for any of them! Some are quite generous but may only be good for a certain university or major, so you can let that guide you on where to apply. Best of luck!"

Puts you at the top of the pile.  The schools you will most likely be applying to (you don't mention names, but I'm guessing you will be applying to engineering schools) know all about FIRST and what it does for students. Most, if not all, would be very impressed that you started your team.   The team that I was a mentor on has many students get into fantastic schools due to their FIRST experience. RIT, Clarkson, USC, RPI, U of Rochester, WPI, Texas A&M, just to name a few. All of these schools have FIRST programs on campus, so they know how amazing the program is."

I think frc really forced me to organize my time and made me figure out what my priorities were :)  (Btw I'll be applying to schools that are known for their medicine and business programs because I plan on getting a double degree) This post def. makes me less anxious!

I ended up visiting the school on a whim while diving from UChicago to Cornell. I didn't expect a lot, but after taking a tour of the campus, I realized that I liked it a lot more than any of the schools I was visiting; I actually heard people laughing as they walked between classes. It was something I hadn't heard at any Ivy I visited.  Anyway, that got a little misty eyed. Its a great school, especially if you're looking at Optics or Optical Engineering. Its not that great for nonscientific majors (queue the hordes of polisci majors telling me off), and it can be a little expensive. If you're looking to major in engineering, its a great school. They really get FIRST. The FLL regional champs are held in the gym, and there are some people on campus who are pretty active volunteers at other events.  I'd suggest, above all else, visiting the school. If you're able, visit all the schools you're serious about. It makes a huge difference."

That being said, it is not quite so much the miracle pill for getting into colleges and getting scholarships that a lot of people say it is.    It will most definitely help you out, especially if you can really talk about it well in the essays, but a good GPA and SAT scores are still more important for both admissions and scholarships."

Functionality is what matters the most when it comes to programing a robot. Sure, someone can make code that runs quickly and efficiently, but it may be worthless on the robot because it doesn't have full functionality of the hardware. Also with things like RobotBuilder being used by Java and C++ teams, a lot of code is going to be structured the same, and it will be the small differences that could add up to winning such an award."

Programming mentors should be pushing for clean, organized code, and if a team has a programming team, documenting changes and all should be standard practice. It seems like a cheap award to be able to get because it's extremely easy. Other awards push for students to take risks and work harder, rather than play it safe and work less.

FRC,39spjc,shadowsoflife,2,Sun Jun 14 12:09:25 2015 UTC,"You never have to walk away from FIRST. I just graduated from Michigan Tech and every year there I was mentoring the local teams. Right now I'm looking into teams near me that I can help mentor. I've been in FIRST since 2009, and I'm not about to stop.   However if you're not interested in mentoring and instead want to compete in FIRST-style challenges at the collegiate level, there are a variety of organizations. For example, some of my friends competed in JSDC."
FRC,39spjc,ilandprnce,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:21:43 2015 UTC,"+1 for JSDC - that was my college competition. If you happen to be attending UIUC, look up iRobotics when you get there - phenomenal organization to get involved with. If you're going anywhere in the midwest, it's a good one-weekend competition to build for and go to!"
FRC,39spjc,libbykamen,2,Tue Jun 23 01:42:02 2015 UTC,"You never have to walk away from FRC entirely - you can volunteer at local events, and there's lots of colleges & universities that offer FIRST mentorship and volunteering programs - that's awesome. But my best advice (aside from take a gap year between graduating from your team and mentoring that same team) for college students is to balance that with something else that isn't FIRST.   I lived on, and led/floor-mommed the Clarkson University FIRST Living & Learning Community during my time there (it's a dorm for FIRSTers) and it could get very insular at times with people only doing FIRST, all the time. Finding some on campus activities that have to do with your other interests, or are outside your comfort zone, will help broaden your perspective on the campus and give you some other things to do.  Join clubs that have nothing to do with robotics - just because. Join engineering challenge teams (Baja, Electric Snowmobile, and Design Build Fly were popular ones at Clarkson), to keep your interest. Join a fraternity, or the student government, or whatever it is that sparks your interest. Explore your campus and what's on it, and get a feel for some of the other things you might want to do. FIRST will be around you no matter what, so go be you for a little bit - and always focus on your schoolwork!   (Sorry, that was a little off topic to the OP, but it's important to me. :) )"

It gives you the opportunity to still be active in the program, you get contacts with local companies through the other mentors who may be in positions that interest you, and it is just fun. I volunteered for 4 years at the North Star regional as a robot inspector and could put to use all the knowledge I gained being on the team to inspect and help the students. Another benefit of helping at regionals is that it is a smaller time commitment since college can/will be more intense than high school."

I'll just go over our main components and why we used them. We used two scuba tanks to store all of our air, one is pressurized to 3000 psi, our ""reserve tank"". We bring this down to about 120 psi and transfer it to our other scuba tank. We use the air in the second scuba tank to actually shoot the T-Shirts, we simply release it with a large solenoid originally meant for being used in airbags. We use it every week or so and sometimes more than that. Our reserve tank has enough air for about 100 shots. Oh, we also mounted a truck horn on it, that doesn't use much air, we run it at 40 psi. We only spent $200 making this robot, the parts all cams through donations and what we had lying around, we only had to buy the pneumatic fittings and the solenoid."

Your comment ""We're currently working with the administration to get varsity status for the team"" (on a different reply in this thread) was a surprise to both my team and the third team -- we had no idea about this.

FRC,38x9f4,TastyYellowMango,7,Mon Jun 8 04:15:34 2015 UTC,"Here's what I would ideally do in your shoes: I would not start an FRC team to compete in the 2016 season. Instead, I would wait for the 2017 season. For the 2016 season, I would gather a few younger, more dedicated members as well as a few of your more dedicated FTC mentors, and join the nearest FRC team. You will be amazed at what you can learn from a veteran team that would have been painful to learn as a rookie team in FRC. That way, come 2017, the core people on your FRC team would already have much of the technical and business knowledge of a veteran team, as well as some awesome friends to call on for help!  That said, I understand that the real situation will likely deviate far from the ""ideal"" situation. Maybe you're a rising senior and won't be around in 2017 for your team's rookie year (if you chose to do it that way). In that case, I suppose it would depend on what's more important to you. Doing it the way I suggested could help the team last longer (rookie turnover is a big problem in FRC because the program is so difficult to run), but starting a team in 2016 could still be a great learning experience, especially if you've got a robust membership that wouldn't quit FRC because of a non-stellar year. If you're dead-set on starting in 2016, then I'd still recommend joining other nearby teams for their offseason programs and to learn how they're run."
FRC,38x9f4,acet1,3,Sun Jun 7 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"I am a rising senior, so if we didn't start a team next year I would be be able to see it out. I've considered that however, but I think that delaying the start for another year would likely mean that the team wouldn't get started at all. Our school district is going through a big restructuring over the next two years because they're replacing both our superintendent and principal. Our goal was to get the plans in place before all that hits."
FRC,38x9f4,orangewheat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:54:30 2015 UTC,"If it's based out of a school, you'll probably need to make it a club and get a teacher to be the adviser. Do you have that yet? That might be very difficult since your school is losing the super and principal. I assume some other staff will leave as well.   The costs to start an FRC team are a lot more than FTC. Plus, the costs to sustain an FRC program are still high. Make sure to have a plan for that."

Whatever school you go through probably won't be able to fully fund your rookie kit / entry fee the first time around. There are tons of grants out there for first-year teams that cover your rookie kit / one regional, but the support dwindles quickly in my experience. There's also the things a team needs outside of the kit and competition entry that you'll have to consider. If you have support from existing sponsors of your FTC teams, that's a really great start."
FRC,38x9f4,copperhair,2,Tue Jun 9 17:50:21 2015 UTC,"If you plan to form a team at a high school, I recommend setting up a non-profit 501c3 corp separate from the school.

It's easier to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission."
FRC,38x9f4,thedude018,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:28:11 2015 UTC,"Some things to consider going into this.  Start talking to teachers about commitment. I've seen a few teams go under because school boards run into liability issues with having teams go to competitions without a teacher mentor. Even with community mentors, it becomes an issue for the school to not have a teacher present.  Find out where you'll be working. Some schools or boards have issues with working off campus. Start talking with the school about this, and if there is a room for you guys. Again, not having a teacher present could cause some issues.  I'm going to assume you guys have sponsors from FTC so that shouldn't be an issue.  If you have any questions at all about FRC, awards, or anything with FRC don't be afraid to contact team 1305 at nnsriteam1305@gmail.com.

We're a pretty new team--just finished our third season.  But we were mentored by two amazing veteran teams in our area--Category 5/3489 and the Burning Magnetos/342 (woot woot!).  In fact, one of them gave us their spare robot to run during the fall/scrimmage season before the spring/competition season of 2013.

FRC,3851pb,MeesterSenorCheeto,11,Mon Jun 1 22:22:31 2015 UTC,The very first swerve drive was done in 1998 by team 47.   I would also highly recommend checking out teams 16 and 1717 who have both done swerve for many years now. Other cool swerves are team 2451 in 2014 and team 368 from 2014 and 2015. Im a huge fan of team 368's 2014 drive because it was all COTS parts and was one of the best driven swerves of all time IMO.
FRC,3851pb,Kevin_Sheridan,9,Tue Jun 2 00:13:24 2015 UTC,"Your design looks pretty cool, and I also love the huge use of swerve this year, but if you've only ever seen 126 and 2067's swerve you need to do a little bit more  digging. My team has used swerve in 2007, 2008, and in 2010 we did a 6 wheel version. None of these were groundbreaking, but 08 and 10 were pretty damn good. Look at 2451's swerve modules for beautiful design and functionality. Their 2014 iteration is my favorite example I've ever seen. Here's a match video of 2451 at Midwest finals with our team. 2481 in 2014 was also amazing. Here's video of 2481 in Galileo Finals. (which they won)  Also, I have to ask if you've ever been on Chief Delphi since it seems like every other day someone is posting a new swerve module. For example these: 1, 2 ,3"
FRC,3851pb,elvis9110,2,Mon Jun 1 23:53:43 2015 UTC,"I saw a lot of great modules, even some of the sexy machines you mentioned, however, those were the only ones I saw in the 5 competitions I had been to in the prior two years.

FRC,3851pb,elvis9110,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:29:38 2015 UTC,"I haven't been able to find any good video of it, but basically it  was the lovechild of 6wd and swerve. The center modules were dropped so that in tank mode you could rotate the robot, then when you pulled a trigger it switched to swerve mode. Power was grouped on each side, I think 2 CIMs per side, all the wheels were rotated by I think 2 window motors and all controlled by the same chain running all the way around the robot perimeter. Its very simple in concept, just technically complicated. If you have any specific questions I'll try to answer them, but I was not really involved in the design process for it."
FRC,3851pb,Bobertmarsh,2,Tue Jun 2 02:01:46 2015 UTC,1717's swerve from 2012 is one of my favorites of all time. Even though we didn't do swerve in 2013 my team used mecanum and we were able to do everything 1717 did with swerve in this video. One of our programmers had a lot of time on his hands and figured out the force vecotrs needed for each mecanum wheel to rotate around them. and drivers perspective driving is so much fun to use.

FRC,37ohgb,borbor11,3,Fri May 29 20:41:36 2015 UTC,"Don't worry. Our auton was the exact same thing. We had a really poor design phase this year and we spent too much time on it - we wrote a few auton modes but we actually never got to test a single one due to time constraints. Also the practice field limited you to 15 minute segments, including setup time, which was beyond stupid. Even if teams weren't there as scheduled, you couldn't go on.  I'm graduating in a month -- this is a side project that I don't even know if I'll have finished before my team could implement it for the 2016 game. I honestly hope it can, but meh.  Short explanation:  This year we (more or less accidentally) developed a system with mecanum drive where we could input an (X,Y) point into the code, and the robot would drive X and Y distance in a straight line - effectively the beginnings of a cartesian plane, with the robot's initial place as the origin. I made something else after competitions where we could input a function, say y = x2 , and the robot will drive to ""along"" the path made by the function. So for y = x2 , the robot would move to the right, but start rotating left, and eventually making its way upwards. So if we started on the bottom left corner of the field, we would probably drive into the upper wall around the middle - or wherever the values wind up being.  So what I'm going to work on is this - I'll input multiple (X,Y) points into a .csv file. The code will import those points (that we we don't have to reupload code every time we adjust a destination point) and generate a function based on what points I entered.  This is basically creating a best-fit line. Except a spline is a piecewise function of polynomials with very small intervals of X. So for every few inches or feet or whatever, it will change the path that it is following. So it generates multiple best-fit polynomials and swaps between them based on how far we've traveled.  Generating the best-fit polynomials (aka interpolation) requires some basic knowledge of Linear Algebra (sometimes called Calc 4 i think). So I need to do that first."

FRC,37i4gt,udpatil,14,Wed May 27 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"Advantages: - Support: Open-Source projects are extremely helpful. Not to mention there are a wealth of resources for help with Java - Freedom: You can do a lot more with Java than LabView. You can do just about anything with Java if you really want to    Disadvantages: - Learning Curve: While Java is a relatively easy language, it's still a steep learning curve from LabView's style - Native Support: You have to configure the RoboRIO to use Java. While it's a one-time process and a fairly simple one, it's still something you have to do     That being said, I really like Java over LabView, hell, I wrote 90% of OpenRIO with it. I just want to make the comparison more Objective than 'my opinion'    As for differences and training: For training I'd recommend getting people acquainted with Object Oriented programming. If you're crushed for time, focus on WPILib and it's implementations, WPILib does a good job of making programming easy if you're a beginner.    Differences: Not much apart from the obvious coding style. Keep in mind Java does have a lot of features you /should/ be aware of (study up on the JVM and OOP), but they aren't necessarily required for FRC development unless you want to get more advanced than just a simple, ""no bells and whistles"" robot program.    I think that's about everything (to avoid a huge wall of text), if you need any clarification or have any concerns I'd be more than happy to help."
FRC,37i4gt,JacisNonsense,4,Wed May 27 20:33:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, personally, I'm fairly acquainted with OOP and Java and only need to learn the WPIlibs stuff... Also, what is OpenRIO? I've been hearing about it a little but I don't exactly know what it is.  EDIT: Also, we use smart dashboard on LabVIEW a lot, but one of the graduating seniors mentioned that smart dashboard is a pain im the ass for Java. How well does it work in your opinion?"
FRC,37i4gt,Poppeseed,3,Wed May 27 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"The worst part about SmartDashboard in my opinion is the implementation of sendable choosers.  If you have SmartDashboard already open with a non-default value selected and you reboot the RoboRio (maybe even just restart the code), SmartDashboard doesn't resend the selected value from SD to the robot's network tables, and it also doesn't update the selected value within SD from the robot.  This causes SD to have one value selected, but the robot to use the default value.   To get around this, we had been restarting SmartDashboard every time we connect to the field, which resyncs the network tables. This actually caused us to crash and burn during autonomous in the playoffs on Carson.  EDIT: We didn't have any other real problems with SmartDashboard, aside from it not wanting to save configurations. I fixed the saving issue (and posted the source here) if you come across this bug."
FRC,37i4gt,JacisNonsense,4,Wed May 27 21:17:01 2015 UTC,"OpenRIO is something I started this year to help programmers share and develop their code more easily. I explain it in this post    As for SmartDashboard, I can't speak much from experience (I never used it myself, I built a custom Driver Station for our team), but we do have 3 teams where my team works, so I can speak at least a little. SmartDashboard was definitely a bit of a pain. WPILib's and NetworkTable's Java implementation is a bit buggy. Java's type-casting certainly didn't help either. There were a lot of syncing issues and didn't work well for strings. Long story short, SmartDashboard is a pain to get working, but once you figure out the kinks it can be pretty powerful. My best advice would be to make your own GUI or even a WebGUI if you're feeling confident enough with your knowledge of Networking"

I also had a very experienced mentor to help me along the way with it.   I dislike the inevitable spaghetti of wires and subVIs that would happen with our more complex code in prior years and it made it much harder to understand for me.

Much more important is what your team is comfortable with and what your mentors know. Also, take into account what you want the programming team to learn from your team - are you a serious enough team that most of your programmers are going into robotics / CE? If so, Labview will be very helpful for them to learn. But if most of your programmers probably will go into other fields of CS, java or C++ will be more useful to learn."

I don't know what language the Driver Station is (or where to get the src code for it) but a port would be interesting.   It would also be interesting if FRC/FIRST opened up more support for Linux/OSX/Mobile (iOS & Android)/Chromium. You would think the people who run FRIST and FRC would be open to using something other that freaking windows but you know, money and supporters are a big thing too.   /end rant/  TL;DR: Emulate = easy as Pi.

In this room, robotics could use their own server setup for hosting all their files (could be pitched as a backup/redundancy in addition to GoogleDrive (already being used)), along with a git server for hosting their code (perhaps using the git server as a master point to sync with github or something), and etc. Basically, teach each programming team/member how the setup is set up and how to maintain it.

(But it also isn't on the scoring platform so it doesn't matter.) If the stack is taller than 6 totes then totes 7, 8, 9, etc. aren't counted.   I'm only counting 12 points. Yeah, its really freaking impressive but it doesn't count for much unless I'm mistaken."
FRC,374kc7,SD0S,11,Sun May 24 21:47:08 2015 UTC,"They were basically guaranteed to be eliminated at that point, so I guess they decided to go out in a bang."
FRC,374kc7,faust_1706,4,Sun May 24 22:14:15 2015 UTC,It's not uncommon for offseason events to change the rules.
FRC,374kc7,Xurian_,7,Sun May 24 21:58:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but this wasn't the case here. They ended up with a solid 23 points iirc"
FRC,374kc7,cory2067,1 point,Mon May 25 04:55:25 2015 UTC,I thought they would just get 0 points for the red card
FRC,373gsu,CalamityRobots,27,Sun May 24 14:58:36 2015 UTC,"We had a similar issue with not only the school administration being unsupportive but our principal attempted to kill off the team in favor of VEX, no members were on board and we approached our school district. The superintendent took care of the situation for us and he ended up helping cover some of the registration costs as the delays caused us to miss out on a lot of important fundraising time. I would suggest bringing up your concerns to a higher level if that's available to you, it's really not fair at all."
FRC,373gsu,binarysaurus,8,Sun May 24 15:38:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after reading through this if things continue the way they are we may have to talk to the superintendent about this. Thank you for the suggestion!!"
FRC,373gsu,auxiliary-character,18,Sun May 24 19:50:03 2015 UTC,I think what I would do is try to organize meetings outside of school. Someone's garage is better than nowhere.
FRC,373gsu,mallocNebulae,6,Sun May 24 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"This is what my team always did. We also got a pickup truck (we were lucky that my uncle had one) and moved out everything we needed so that we could fix the robot in my living room. We had to ask to take the equipment off school grounds, but my coach didn't mind. Not ideal, but we got the job done."
FRC,373gsu,auxiliary-character,5,Sun May 24 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"That's true. That's our current plan of action until next school year, and from then on its all up in the air. Thank you!!"
FRC,373gsu,ad1217,6,Sun May 24 19:48:14 2015 UTC,"Our team doesn't really have any problems with the school, and we still meet at my family's garage under crunch time. We do have a nice garage with a programmer loft, though."
FRC,373gsu,auxiliary-character,8,Sun May 24 21:06:39 2015 UTC,That garage is bigger than my team's entire work area...
FRC,373gsu,OhYeahThat,5,Mon May 25 00:55:17 2015 UTC,"There's a good reason for that: we lived in it. We built our garage before we built our house, so it had to be big enough to live in for a (cramped) couple years. My bedroom was a shelf!"
FRC,373gsu,Samy42,15,Mon May 25 01:00:09 2015 UTC,"I suggest that you need to do a better job of marketing your team to your school administration.  Do you have a Business Mentor?  Our team is completely self funded because the school didn't have $ for us, they let us use an unwanted corner of the school and the first year we were moved several times.  However, we have an awesome business mentor who is able to show how robotics benefits students and now that we are in our fourth year, the school has turned to being totally onboard with supporting us (well, they still don't give us $, but they give lots of space and free copies and transportation, etc).    You need to show your school how FIRST benefits the school.  Some things you could look at:  how many of your robotics members graduate compared to the school at large?  How many go onto college?  What is the average GPA of your team?  Get some testimonials from former students, get some of your sponsors and mentors to talk to school board members about the team.   Most school boards have nights where they have presentations by school groups.  Get on the agenda, make an awesome presentation about FIRST and your team specifically and show them what robotics is all about.  Be sure to thank the school all the time for everything it does (even though they aren't doing that much)  Thank the principal for letting you use their space, thank the board for what they do contribute.    If you have a decent group of mentors and team members who are passionate about the team, you can definitely keep it going.  Get the word out that you need space, you may find a local business who would give you space as a sponsorship.  I would look at any local manufacturers you have nearby, they love robotics."
FRC,373gsu,personizzle,6,Sun May 24 17:59:16 2015 UTC,"We don't have a business mentor but I'll talk to my team about such. Most people on the team are a bit awkward so its been kind of a hassle to get everyone to talk to potential sponsors, but this may be the kick in the butt we need. Thank you so much!!"
FRC,373gsu,SinisterTitan,11,Sun May 24 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"My highschool tried to cut funding (8k/yr think) for my team and remove all shop/meeting space access so we went to the school board and the community. After a hundred people yelled at them because of improved academics, college admissions, scholarships, leadership and stem skills,and even personality improvements, the school board changed their mind. I say take it and the success stories/statistics to your town."
FRC,373gsu,Animalperson100,6,Sun May 24 16:53:11 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a great idea! Not even gonna lie robotics actually did keep me out of quite a bit of trouble that I could've gotten myself into this year, and I know that its an outlet for quite a few people on my team. I'll try doing that, thank you so much!"
FRC,373gsu,JEEntertainment89,10,Sun May 24 19:47:26 2015 UTC,"I wanna take a moment to thank everyone who commented and upvoted this, because you guys are the reason I love the FRC community. I'm glad I can reach out and get help from all of you ♡"
FRC,373gsu,16skittles,7,Sun May 24 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"Our team left our school and reformed under a new number under similar circumstances this year. Look into 501c3 nonprofit status to maintain sponsor relations right now, either doing it yourself or organizations like 4-H which can serve as an umbrella nonprofit, this it the main practical obstacle to going independent. Crucial, but takes a lot of time due to the nature of it.   It's been a rocky road in our first year away from the school, but in the long run it'll build us a better team. If you have any questions, let me know!"
FRC,373gsu,borbor11,3,Sun May 24 23:22:30 2015 UTC,Thank you so much!!
FRC,373gsu,KmE_Cheese,2,Mon May 25 01:34:47 2015 UTC,"The biggest benefit to 4-H is that you get insurance through them. Some of the regulations can be a pain, but they're far better than having no team at all.   Been on a 4-H team for 5 years, and we were the first one in the south east, PM me if you are planning to go that route and I can direct your questions to someone who can for sure answer them!"
FRC,373gsu,Necroterra,7,Tue May 26 12:26:27 2015 UTC,"Our team is well supported funding/space wise but we're very laid back in terms of how popular it is and how much support we get from fellow students and teachers. I think one of the main things to do is go to your principal, bkard of ed, superintendant, ect and explain to them what FIRST is and how much FIRST means to you guys. Tell them how it gets kids interested in STEM, teaches them not only skills in the field but skills such as public speaking or teamwork. Tell them it turns kids live around. Show them the statistics on the FIRST website. Colleges want it, employers want it THERE ARE SCHOLORSHIPS, because its a great program that really does a lot for its kids. It would really be a shame for you guys to loose your team and therefore the oppertunites FIRST provides, and hopefully people will realize that."

FRC,373gsu,Maniac_mechanic,3,Sun May 24 23:05:54 2015 UTC,"It's easier said than done, but it looks like if you can't negotiate something more favorable after talking to the superintendent, you should just cut ties with the school. Reading your post gives the impression that you get practically zero funding from them, you're not getting mentors from them, and you're not getting recruitment/advertising from them. Basically all your school provides is the location.  That's not to downplay the importance of a location, as locations can be quite expensive. But if you're not able to access it like you want to, you should consider leaving and finding a new location. You have to get new mentor leadership anyway if the teacher is leaving.  My team had to move before this season, and we were just becoming acquainted with the new shop by January. The move happened in December. We were getting our location as an in-kind donation from a local car dealership. The site used to be a service garage/dealership, but they let us use the main part (with bathrooms/offices) while leasing the garage part to a batting instructor and later a heating/cooling company. Eventually, however, they sold the building.  We were considering an offer from a local college but ended up taking a spot offered by ALCOA in a former elementary school across the street from their plant. If you started with the school, you may not have looked at other options in the past, but if you ask around and talk to local businesses or organizations, you might find a better location elsewhere."

As a parent, I am glad we got our own spot for now and really enjoyed seeing other local teams practice together (Rosie, Aces, Granby,...)  for the reasons you mentioned.

FRC,36u7v9,ShadowLoki99,6,Fri May 22 03:57:09 2015 UTC,"Hey there! OpenRIO was something I started this year as a means to help FRC programmers. Our 'core' plugin that you're seeing the most is called the Toast API. Toast is a modular based robotics framework wrapping around WPILib. What this means is teams can make their own 'modules' that suit a specific purpose (e.g. Drive Code, Vision Tracking, Autonomous, Whatever). Modules can 'depend' on each other (e.g. Autonomous requires Vision) as well. Modules are stored in .jar files and are loaded by Toast.    As for the 'hacked roboRIO', what you're seeing is a Simulation GUI built into Toast. Toast comes with a ClassPatcher, a utility used to override WPILib's core classes. When the code is running on the RoboRIO, the ClassPatcher is disabled (as to stick with WPILib's specification). However, when launched on a PC inside a dev environment, the ClassPatcher overrides WPILibs calls to native (HAL) code (e.g. software <--> hardware calls) and replaces them with calls to the Simulation GUI. This allows us to visualize the IO of the Robot, while still keeping the code constant between the Robot and Computer.    Most of the stuff you see on OpenRIO are in-development plugins. People are welcome to come and contribute on their own if they wish. Most of the plugins (or modules) on OpenRIO are language based. Toast can load Groovy files by default, but with extra modules you can load Ruby, LUA and more languages in the future. Others like 'Routines' can record-and-playback autonomous routines. We also have NetworkDelegate, which is an API that has been embedded into Toast so modules dont compete for TCP ports.    As for platforms, I frequent between Mac and Windows, and I use Linux for Travis CI's builds. If you have any more questions, I'd be more than happy to help :)"
FRC,36u7v9,JacisNonsense,5,Fri May 22 04:54:01 2015 UTC,"Hi I followed the instruction in the quickstart. But when I try to use the simulation I get the error: Cannot start process, the working directory C:\Users\<name>\Documents\FRC\ToastSimulation\Toast-1.4.0\run does not exist.    When looking in this directory it is obvious the run folder is missing. How do I solve this issue?"
FRC,36u7v9,Dualsabers04,3,Sun May 24 01:36:26 2015 UTC,"Just creating the new, empty 'run' folder will solve the issue."
FRC,36u7v9,JacisNonsense,3,Sun May 24 07:23:03 2015 UTC,Thanks. The simulation starts up fine now. However it seems my autonomousPeriodic() and teleopPeriodic() functions are not being called when changing the state through the simulation GUI. Only the prestart() and start() method are called at the very beggining.    Could you possible take a look at this gist and tell me what I'm missing? https://gist.github.com/ASankaran/e48ae846d266d3818bdd
FRC,36u7v9,Dualsabers04,4,Sun May 24 14:05:36 2015 UTC,"Periodic Functions and State Transitions are handled with the StateTracker. Create a class implementing the 'StateListener.Ticker' interface and register it with StateTracker.addTicker(your_ticker) in your 'prestart' method.    If you want this to be done for you, change ToastModule to ToastStateModule and the hooks will be added for you. These tick on all states, so you may have to add an if (state == RobotState.AUTONOMOUS) {} block if you want to filter it    inb4 'but why though': StateTrackers are used so modules can have multiple ticking classes. Additionally, modules that serve as libraries often don't need to tick, so why waste CPU time ticking something that does nothing."

FRC,36rqfq,pth,2,Thu May 21 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"Depending on. This image describes it best. First, Toast is loaded. Then Toast applies any patches if it needs to (for simulation) and loads WPILib.

FRC,36n42z,HappyRobo4619,2,Wed May 20 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"Mecanum wheel team here! Our only two currently functioning bots both have mecanum wheels.   Back when we only had Del Toro on the VEX wheels, those mecanum wheels actually had a manufacturing defect that caused the plastic connectors between the wheel and the rollers to snap (we've broken one or two by this point). We were concerned about this when taking it to outreach events, so to make our bot last longer we picked up one or two giant rolls of carpet off the free section on craigslist. They appear relatively frequently, just check and you'll probably find some within a week or two (and be safe when meeting folks on CL! Buddy system and the like). It's a bit heavy, but we take these to events and lay it out wherever we are presenting - and then we can strafe all we want! Of course, probably wouldn't work well for a parade...though my question is how are you even getting that much battery time to be driving the bot for an entire parade. Huh.  Not a great picture for the rug, but you can see the length of carpet we have underneath the bot. This was at our school's (outdoor) club rush when we took the bot out to zoom around and throw balls at people."

FRC,36n42z,jayfred,1 point,Fri May 22 21:29:59 2015 UTC,cork screw thread might do it.  Either a simple corkscrew thread or something more robust.  4 custom rollers similar to the things this uses would work.  if you orientate them so the force vectors are the same as your mecanum wheels it should work with your code vectors OutoftheBox.  Your current mecanum wheels should work fine for now though.

FRC,36n42z,Gordomperdomper,1 point,Thu May 21 02:14:44 2015 UTC,"If you really want to strafe during the parade, the path of least resistance would be to just swap out your robot's current mecanum wheels with some old ones you don't care  about. If you don't feel comfortable with that, I think that the two next best options are either rebuilding and reprogramming the chassis for omni drive or swerve drive, with omni being the simpler of the two. However, swerve drive makes for a great offseason project as it's proved to be super useful in lots of FRC games. If you choose omni drive, make sure your wheels are either rubber or polyurethane."

You could always buy used or older tablets for a lot cheaper though. And depending on the app that you create, you could downsize to 8"" or 7"" tablets which will probably be cheaper too."
FRC,36gbtc,ObnoxiousPorcelain,5,Sat May 23 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"Copying my description of our system from an earlier thread.   Team 195 uses 6 Surface tablets to scout each robot playing in a match, 2 Surface tablets to scout robots we'll be playing with or against in our upcoming match(es), and 3 laptops to scout 2 robots each.   The reason we have a separate group of scouters scouting robots in our upcoming match(es) is because we want that data specifically to be as accurate as possible, and thus assign the more dedicated scouters to those tablets to watch those robots.  The two sets of tablets are collecting the same objective data as each other, but the laptop scouters collect solely opinionated data. All of this data is collected and stored using a specially designed program in Access, created by our scouting mentor specifically for each year's game.  Prior to each of our matches, we use the program to queue up and print a match report, which looks like this, to be delivered to our drive team for use in creating their strategy for that particular match. It includes each team's recent match history (what they scored and in what order), comments from laptop scouters, canburglar times (when applicable), and much more.  For our strategy meeting about alliance selections, we make extensive use of Tableau, which allows us to compile, sort through, and find trends in the data that would otherwise be very difficult to notice.    Data is transferred between tablets/laptops via a USB drive that gets passed between all our scouters at pre-determined syncing times. The program has a ""sync"" button built in, which pushes all the data from the device into the database on the drive.  Reconfiguring the app consists of our scouting mentor and lead scouts/aspiring lead scouts sitting down on kickoff and deciding what data we want to collect (both objective and subjective), how we want to collect it, and how the app should be laid out to make using it easy and efficient.  Keeping devices charged was always interesting this past season, as our set up varied from competition to competition. At Waterbury, we found a narrow table bolted to the top of the stands, with outlets on the wall behind it. Although cramped, we had power all day, and the table meant laptop scouters could sit comfortably throughout the weekend. A similar set up was had at Tech Valley and NECMP: we brought and set up our own table where laptop scouters could see the entirety of the field, then used extension cords to supply the station with power from nearby outlets.  Since no outlets were near the stands in Hartford or STL, we just planted our scouting suitcase (affectionately called the football) near an available outlet in the arena, which held multiple charging cables and power strips, allowing us to recharge any of our devices when necessary."

Also before a match we have a match view that shows all six teams for a match side by side to compare strengths  The app we use has a config file that takes in a simple format telling it what values to store and what datatype they are, as well as what categories each data point falls under and in what order to display them.

FRC,36gbvh,ncisfan,4,Tue May 19 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"It mostly depends on where you are coming from. American teams only have to pay transportation for their robot and of course for each child and chaperone along with hotel. My team went for our first time this past season and we took 4 chaperones and 5 students. However, 3 students went up by themselves. If you're lucky, a team parent could get discounted transportation costs if they work for an airline/bus company. In total, each person was $900 and in total it was $10000-$12000 for every member total that went. We received a very generous donation of $3000 from our school principal to help which was to our fortune. It is cheaper to drive as you will not have to rent a car when you get there but we flew this past season. If you are an international team, you're looking at a few thousand alone in robot/tool transport because that all has to go through customs and immigration, which is unfortunately very expensive compared to what it should be.  I'm sure you know, but the two championships idea is designed to reduce costs in this. Just remember, these prices are concrete. You can always seek sponsorship, but there is only so much public relations money to go around."
FRC,36gbvh,ThePaulitician,5,Tue May 19 18:38:23 2015 UTC,"My team took 9 kids, 3 adults this year. Total cost of about $16,000. Most of that is registration and food.   With some seriously impressive last-minute sponsorship and existing club funds kicked in each kid paid $1150 to go.   Yes, quite expensive.  If you take FIRST's post-season survey, please suggest to them that cheaper would be better."
FRC,36gbvh,StapledOK,3,Tue May 19 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"$1150 per kid sounds pretty reasonable. We had about $1395 per kid for us just to get to the Australian Regional (which is only on the other side of the country, us being in Perth and the regional being in Sydney, about a 4 hour flight)."
FRC,36gbvh,JacisNonsense,1 point,Tue May 19 13:03:21 2015 UTC,Yes. Club funds covered a good amount of each kid's cost.
FRC,36gbvh,StapledOK,2,Wed May 20 01:38:18 2015 UTC,"This is my worry about so much effort to get as many teams to Worlds as possible, not that many can afford to go.  You can do a lot of fundraising if you make it there by doing extremely well, but if you have to go and say, ""We made it to the 'Co-Worlds' competition, along with about 50% of teams"", it's hard to get people to support that."
FRC,36gbvh,histry,1 point,Tue May 19 17:48:37 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. It won't be special if 30+ percent of teams are headed every year. I know they'd like to have more teams experience worlds, but I wish they'd do it by encouraging and giving more resources to struggling team. Opening the floodgates will not be great.  The cynic in me says that more World's attendees = more cash for FIRST. Yes, shit's expensive. But the registrations they charge are absurd imho."

FRC,36gbvh,StapledOK,1 point,Wed May 20 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"Almost completely based on where you're coming from and when you book.  From the West coast it can easily run about 1000+ per student for hotels and airfare.  Depending on how much you're trying to send, shipping your stuff can just mean your crate is a little overweight to needing to send a trailer team.  This cost is often split between a few teams, but adds up fast.  If you're a team needing to travel to the event buy new batteries, have them shipped to the hotel, assemble them when you arrive, and give them to local teams when you leave.  The cumulative cost and pain of shipping batteries is not worth it!"
FRC,36gbvh,raging_goomba,1 point,Wed May 20 10:33:04 2015 UTC,"We charged our kids 400 dollars this year which ended up being approximately half of travel costs, (team picked up the rest using sponsorship money). Our sponsor GM picked up the registration fee, which I believe was 5000 dollars. So it ended up being around 25000 dollars, since we took around 40 people."
FRC,36gbvh,TeamSoloMidfanboii,1 point,Wed May 20 22:13:13 2015 UTC,"My team is from southern Ontario. We had five vehicles and a trailer drive to and from St. Louis (13-hour drive one-way). We stayed in a hotel in St. Louis for five nights. The team members were responsible for paying for their food and other personal stuff during the trip. Our team paid for everything else: hotel, gas, parking, registration, shipping the robot, converting our currency to USD, and probably other things I'm missing.    We made a rough total cost for our trip that turned out to be about $15'000. Coming from our regional competition, we didn't have much money, only enough to get us started next year, so we worked our hardest to raise that $15'000, but we got it.    Edit: We had a total of 20-25 students and mentors go to St. Louis."

FRC,36dk2u,BlackMathNerd,14,Mon May 18 15:14:42 2015 UTC,"The mentor situations are tough and I don't have time right now to address my thoughts.   The president thing is easy. You're the adult. You talk to the other mentors and then you sit down with the president and you tell her what needs to change or you'll be replacing her. That's it. You. Are. The. Adult.   If the kids are voting on team leads and presidents each season cut that shit out now. Pick the kids you want to lead, who have the knowledge and the care for others. Even though FIRST is full of smart kids, they're not immune to popularity contests and feeling intimidated by others. You guys should be picking the best to lead the team or you're wasting your time, the student's time, and all your sponsor money. If no one learns, FIRST is pointless."
FRC,36dk2u,eandi,4,Mon May 18 16:11:50 2015 UTC,"I like this. I will try and implement this. In an ideal world this would happen.   I am the adult here but that President doesn't seem to realize or treat me as such. I've known some of these kids for a while, except when I was 18 and out of HS. I'm now 20 turning 21.  She does not, and will not listen to me, and proceeds to talk over me. It angers me, but I'm not about to have an angry outburst because of  an entitled, asshole kid. There's a better way for me to handle it maturely.   This team has never voted on anything for leader. Never. It's a thing that's passed down, basically by who's the most well-known in our area and who speaks the loudest or intimidates others the most. Everyone just sort of assumes.   I can give a breakdown on team leaders:   Year 1: President was the best. She was a senior, picked by the old teachers/coaches of my former FRC team who started this team, and she did a great job, along with great mentorship.   Year 2: The de-facto VP and who would take charge, even if others thought he wasn't perfectly suited to it. He never committed 100% and was gone volunteering often, canceling meetings. The current president was VP that year.   Year 3: Current President, basically worse than Year 2 President, except she actually has meetings."
FRC,36dk2u,Dinokaiz2,5,Mon May 18 16:55:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with eandi here. You or someone with the time needs to reestablish an entirely new technical hierarchy on the team before it collapses on itself. The keyword there needs to be technical. Ordinarily, an election by the team would suffice, but in this case, it seems like the majority of the team would be intimidated by the current leaders. My opinion on what you need to do here is:  1) Although it works out for some teams, a Team President and VP, in my opinion, can't be carried in between years. If the current President and VP support the mentor's and the team's goals, and strive to achieve them, then, by all means, carry over the President and VP. But you can't make it a given that, under all circumstances, the current leadership will carry over.  2) On my own team, we have student elected technical leads (i.e. programming lead, electrical lead, etc.) and a single student-elected team captain. We then have another group of students dubbed ""The Elder's Council"" that consists of the team captain and 3 other kids that are deemed smart and capable by the mentors to represent the team's best interests while also making fast and educated decisions on problems that would otherwise take whole or even several meetings to cover. I've seen good results for us with this hierarchy, but it might not work out for all teams.   3) Whatever student government format you decide on, you and the mentors need to APPOINT everyone into the leadership positions. In coming years you could change some or all of the positions to be filled by student election, but, given the state of the team at the current time, it seems that the mentors have to make the decisions on their own or risk a reelection of unreliable and uncertified students whose only skill is intimidation to seize power.  Feel free to reply back with questions, comments, or concerns on my view of the situation. I really do hope you can manage to resolve the situation before it gets terribly out of hand. Good luck."
FRC,36dk2u,popnbrown,3,Mon May 18 18:36:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I like the suggestions.   I sadly think a problem with here with this team is that we're really lacking in the technical expertise of the students.This is a young team and after ""3 rebuilding years"" we're in no better shape than we were before. I'm fine with the FRC software and the wiring side as I went through it when I did FIRST and I've done it in my professional career. These students need this time now to practice and learn.   In terms of mentors on this team, there is myself, the aforementioned other programming mentor who oversteps his bounds and isn't always helpful, and the seeming replacement for our old head mentor who isn't always available.   We need an infrastructure here, and I'm hellbent on making it happen.   Because of the nature of this team and how it works, the teachers/coaches of the sister team also handle the bulk of administrative work for the team. That said, these teachers and coaches just finished their first year in FRC this year, as the old experienced ones have left.   I might have to email the other members of the team sans the president to have them voice their concerns without fear of their president finding out. But I can't foresee this team growing or living with her as President. At least until after she graduates, but that's something I don't want to take to chance."
FRC,36dk2u,popnbrown,4,Mon May 18 19:12:23 2015 UTC,"I would tread carefully about emailing the rest of the team sans President. you're effectively playing with fire by going behind her back. It'd be better IMO to kick her off the team (which I don't think is the right move either).  I think the right approach is to have a mentor discussion and approach the President separately.  But you're right to discuss with the Team. Would an open forum with the entire team about goals/next year/restructure be possible? If you do this, you should make it clear it's a mentor run thing and just push everyone to say something. This may help the President also realize what her teammates want in order for her to continue and may have a change of heart.  Two main suggestions: - mentor discussion on the problem and how to move forward - teamwide discussion on general team led by mentors"
FRC,36dk2u,wifichick,2,Mon May 18 20:03:23 2015 UTC,"It's not like she hasn't gone behind others backs, but this is sadly the least problematic way to have the kids open up.   I'm not a fan of kicking her off the team.  I do want the mentor meeting, but when one is moving to GA or has moved already, the other is seldom there, and the other just isn't socially adept enough but is present, it's tough on me to be the mentor that's there and can handle and manage team politics and egos. And also the youngest.   I could do an open forum discussion that we'd mentors run. I just fear that this season would turn into personal attacks and a few people dominating discussion."
FRC,36dk2u,wifichick,2,Mon May 18 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I can't draw on experience for your situation, but regarding an open discussion, I purposefully make sure those kids being quiet and seem to want to say something say something. It's not the same situation as yours because we don't have any appointed ""leadership"" structure yet, but there are some kids who try and dominate the discussion.  Hmmm..this is a tough one. So the sneaky way I communicate with the rest of the team without one person, is going off topic while ""working"" with them on something. I was working on a sponsorship letter with a student and kind of snuck in some questions about how her partner was doing on his portion, and found out a good amount of insight about how they weren't working well together.   Basically, I get the sense that you're powerless to overhaul anything. So maybe working from the bottom-up rather than top-down may be viable. As in actually mentoring several students and part of the mentoring being ""MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD"". This is tough, I've tried it for about 5-6 months and certain students still don't speak up."

FRC,36dk2u,KosmicKhaos,2,Tue May 19 04:33:15 2015 UTC,"So someone had made a survey, and then he shoots the survey to her asking if he can send it out and she says that the old head mentor who moved does not want a survey. And that everything that needed to be discussed has been brought up and addressed already (But what was said? Does everyone know? Where was this info?)   That lack of chain of communication and relaying information to everyone is not ok in any organization."

FRC,36dk2u,cycling_duder,3,Mon May 18 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"Look at the long term.  President will be gone soon, but the new members need to learn stuff to build a robot. If the chasis from last year is still functional, see if there is a way for the new people to tune up their skills to be ready for the last minute changes.  Collectively look back on the lessons learned, but point it toward the next season.  Try to plan out a hypothetical 2016 schedule with adjustments for what took too long. (edit: have the students do this, based on the times from this year).  One technique that reduces the ""popularity contest"" problems is to first review the qualifications that you would like in the officers, and then try to rate the people to these factors.  It sometimes helps people separate the two."
FRC,36dk2u,cycling_duder,2,Mon May 18 21:00:00 2015 UTC,"Really like this too. Man these are good.   As much as I love this upcoming group of seniors, I sadly can't wait for a few of them to go. I feel bad for the ones that have to take the brunt of her, but I'm invested for this team's long term success.   Apparently there was a meeting about what went wrong during build season, between the members that could attend a Saturday meeting to clean up the shop. This included the old head mentor.  None of the results from the talks of that meeting have made it out to anyone else, and people still seem to be in the dark about it. I've got 2016 plans going, planning on getting kids comfortable with programming and electrical work and fixing things on the robot, along with driver station and driving the robot."

FRC,362kvv,greendevildog,9,Fri May 15 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"To be more specific: they offered 4 negative options, 1 neutral option, and 5 positive options, which skews the data.

In essence, this means the positive evaluations have more weight than the negative ones.  This probably wasn't intentional when FIRST was making the survey, but I find it hard to believe they would miss it when evaluating the final data; looking at how there are more 1s and 2s than ALL 6-10s, it's pretty clear something is fishy with a presented average so close to ""neutral"".  If only FIRST HQ had acknowledged the bias, a lot of frustration could have been avoided, because now many feel they tried to sneak it past us. The biased metrics, combined with FIRST HQ's perceived lack of interest in getting input from teams before they decided to split champs does not bode well for HQ's image."

The other two robots must work to defend that robot during the match, while all three must attack the other alliance's marked robot.  There could be a small number of balls available for use, so it's easy to count how many hit the other bot.  Maybe have rotating periods of attacking and defending.

Perhaps have a trough/fountain of water in the middle, and have the bots compete to get the water and water plants in team's color buckets.  The plants in buckets all weigh the same (5lbs or so) and start out scattered around the arena evenly, and each team has a large scale on their side. The winning team is the team that has the most water weight in their plants on the scale. Subtract 5lbs for each plant on the scale, and you have the team's score.  Bonuses can be given for any bots floating in the trough/fountain at the end of the round.  There could be a lot of offence and defense, by moving the other team's buckets, and guarding your team's scale and pushing enemy bots out of the water and all sorts of stuff."

It was unfortunate that a single error snowballed into many more as our alliance did not properly prep for the next match and were eliminated after a second poor showing.

FRC,35i64e,molmsted98,11,Sun May 10 21:29:08 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Programmers submitting their compiled code (the code generated from source), meaning it makes their repository messier and bigger than it needs to be.    Same with workspace files, which contain things like the definitions of user-preferences for eclipse. This means the people who make a local copy of their code have to regenerate their environment every time because the workspace changes from person-to-person"
FRC,35i64e,molmsted98,3,Sun May 10 21:32:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry for not knowing, what is the use of .gitignore?"
FRC,35i64e,molmsted98,9,Sun May 10 21:22:26 2015 UTC,.gitignore if a file that contains a bunch of strings which represent file 'patterns' or 'names' to not commit to git. It's like an 'exclusion list'.
FRC,35i64e,johndbritton,5,Sun May 10 21:29:20 2015 UTC,Why should more people be using it?
FRC,35i64e,ThePenultimateOne,15,Sun May 10 21:52:04 2015 UTC,"1) Compiled Code Compiled code is generated from source code, ready to be deployed to the robot. These class files are 'static', i.e. they are generated when the source is compiled. Because of this, there is no actual reason to include compiled code in git, because anyone who uses it can just run the build script to generate it. Additionally, if there are multiple people working on the repo, these class files override each other, or conflict, causing the actual deployment file to be a different version than what you specify.    2) Workspace Files Workspace files are what are generated by Eclipse or your Development Environment. These files contain your user-preferences for the project. The thing is, this file changes from person-to-person, depending on their local system. This means if it's included in the repository, if someone pulls the repo, their preferences will be overridden and they have to regenerate their workspace every time    All these extra, not required files make the repo take up more physical disk space, as well as look messier to people who wish to visit the repository. Overall, only the source files and build data should be included in the repository, along with whatever else is needed. Class files and Workspace files are not required by the build, but instead are generated by the build, meaning they do not need to be included and are recommended to be omitted."

I recommend listening to teammates, not directly, but what they remember most of what you have. The key is to spend your design budget and time filling problems that you have or will have. We started by creating uprights to mark the perimeter of the space given.There is an impressive amount of items that just about every team needs to bring, and if there is a place to put it, the odds of that item being misplaced are decreased considerably. Besides that, just keep in mind that whatever you build must be able to be dismantled and brought to competitions, so make it easy to dismantle and store. Good luck, Friend."
FRC,35eqbj,noe_body,6,Sat May 9 17:45:48 2015 UTC,"The best pit from a functional point if view is one that has everything you need and nothing you don't. Step back and look at your robot and make a list of every tool you will need to take apart and put it back together. Then make a list of spare parts and some basic raw materials for some minimum of fabrication. Chances are good that all this will fit into a small tool box and a tote. Add some general utility items like a drill, lights, brooms, small shop vac, etc and you have a small lean pit that is easy to move pack and find things in."
FRC,35eqbj,cycling_duder,3,Sat May 9 21:39:23 2015 UTC,"we just use some rolling workbenches with drawers/cabinets that we got from Sams club to keep everything organized and give us a place to work on parts at regionals. A carpeted or foam tile floor is also great because it makes standing in the pit all day much more comfortable. You may want a power strip in case the venue doesn't have many outlets, and some overhead lights make working on electrical components and doing maintenance a lot easier than using a flashlight. If you want a structure, you can use pre-made trusses similar to what we, 1086, used this year. Here's a picture of the structure and workbenches from earlier in the season http://www.chiefdelphi.com/media/img/80c/80c83542e4b8dae0c8e5d2f71b2833f2_m.jpg .

Putting subsystems in separate threads is relatively simple, especially if you have a mentor that knows any java, and can vastly improve the behavior of your robot."
FRC,35c3uc,auxiliary-character,2,Sat May 9 07:15:57 2015 UTC,"Doing so would most likely result in your robot not doing anything or continuing to do what it was last told for one second. If you want the elevator to go all the way up to the limit switch, you could fire and forget (assuming that hitting the limit switch stops the motor in a resettable manner (that is, if you told it to go down it would still go down, as opposed to a limit switch that's wired to cut power to the motor, losing the ability to use the motor)). If that's not an option or if you want to be able to send the elevator up adjustable increments, you'll need to either multithread or implement a time tracking system.  Assuming this is Java (seeing as you've mentioned Thread.sleep()):   Multithreading (dirty): Fire off a thread that sleeps for 1000 ms and then stops the motor. Can cause issues if another elevator command is issued, as this thread will proceed to stop the elevator after one second regardless of if you still want it to. Multithreading (clean): Submit a Runnable that stops the motor to a ScheduledExecutorService with a 1000 ms execute delay, keep the returned Future object so you can cancel the stop if you so wish (solving the issue with the above). Time tracking: Keep a list of temporal tasks, on every robot tick (or control loop iteration) run through all the tasks. Your elevator task would simply check that a second has elapsed, and if so, stop the elevator and then evict itself from the task list. Handling a cancellation would be as simple as evicting the task."

Setting something like that up as you make your transition away from the team might be a good thing - work with your other student leaders and your mentors to help design that. It won't solve every problem, but it will help keep a structure to the team - and who knows? With all those guidelines to help, someone might end up stepping up to take charge of the team who might have been intimidated to before.  I hope that helps. More than anything, take care of you -- and remember that your FIRST family is always here for you. One of my favorite things about FIRST is its tight-knight community - don't ever hesitate to reach out if you need anything."
FRC,3553kj,libbykamen,2,Thu May 7 13:35:02 2015 UTC,"I would say take a step back over the summer so you can make a decision without the stress of school. If you feel that being on the team would be detrimental to your health or academics don't do it. A robotics team is not worth messing up your own life. Many teams go through periods where their team isn't as strong due to a lack of leadership, but all it takes is a determined set of people to bring it back up such as mentors or underclassmen. It is common for people who are usually followers to spring up an be leaders when they get the opportunity and/or need to.  TLDR: Take care of yourself first, then worry about the team."

If the team cannot make their own decisions, they simply have not prepared themselves well enough for the future. I know as a student from this season that each person is given a job that they physically can do. Teacher-sponsors whom help the team stay attached to a school and can teach them how to think for themselves, not for each other.  On the other hand, you don't want them to fail correct? So, what you can do is show up at least once a week for 30 minutes -> 1hour and check up on everything with them still be on the team but you're giving them tips about what you've learned from this year, otherwise talk with the teacher-sponsor about what they've done and see if you can give them suggestions and simply let them handle the competition.

First, the default Mecanum drive MIGHT not be as smooth as you'd like, strafing will not be perfect. Something more complicated like using encoders and PID loops to stabalize it will produce a much better drive system. Also, if the wheels don't move the way you want them to, some of them might be mechanicaly reversed. Just put the bot up on some wooden blocks and drive it, paying attention to what the wheels do."

They're trying to locally impact teams in a positive way for them.   To clarify for everyone, I'll post a bit of what OP messaged me:  ""We"" as in one of the largest Technology Consulting firms, but to be exact, one of our Technology Practice partners is interested in becoming involved with FIRST robotics and we are trying to understand the scene and how can we be helpful. Our ideas were in the range from sponsoring a single school for the season, having a kick off event or having workshops/contests and etc... Honestly nothing great yet, as we need to understand FIRST robotics.  We just want to understand the scene and help it grow. We would first pilot our initiative on our local level ""Midwest/MN/WI"" level and if it was to be successful, we would take it to a national level and roll it out to all of our 47 offices across US."
FRC,3530ro,libbykamen,7,Wed May 6 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, then we really have a problem with the lower end of the field being unable to contribute meaningfully to an alliance. While the problem may have been worse this year due to the engineering challenge involved in manipulating the game pieces, there's a lot of teams that need help just making a robot that can do a task that is worth points reliably"
FRC,3530ro,Woolly1806,7,Wed May 6 20:22:48 2015 UTC,"So what you are saying is that you currently have 2 playing fields competing on the same level? Tier 1 teams that have been doing this for years and have a well established framework around FIRST and then Tier 2 teams that lag behind and can't bring anything to a competitive level due to a number of reasons, such as late start, lack of resources(financial, experience) and etc..?"
FRC,3530ro,6point2,6,Wed May 6 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"Partly.  There is a small gap between top teams and starting teams because of that exact reason: those teams are just starting. They need to get a feeling for financials, team management, and the engineering challenges FIRST brings. Teams like 254, 1114, 1678, and 148 (and my team, 1138) have been doing this for 10+ years, so we have a slight advantage concerning the networks of sponsorships and facilities. Keep in mind, my opinions are based on my experiences as a California team.  On alliances, starting teams NEVER bring nothing to the table. There are plenty of rookie teams that have won regionals because of their performances during the game and their ideas.These rookie teams are bright with ideas and notions that veteran teams take for granted. FIRST is all about the engineering challenge, and they're not afraid to try anything or have preconceptions about anything. The decision to try something new and strive towards working with it is probably the most important trait in robotics (in my opinion).   If you're thinking of entering the FIRST scene, DO IT. DO IT NOW. I cannot think of any other organization that has brought so much knowledge and real world experience in a fun way. There are millions of dollars in scholarships for FIRST participants, and a lot of top level companies/colleges have many FIRST alum. It's probably been one of the best decisions of my life to join my robotics team, as I've had hands on experience and real world problems to solve at my fingertips.   Just my two cents."
FRC,3530ro,Woolly1806,3,Wed May 6 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"You could break it down into many tiers, but at a regional or district event, about the bottom quarter of teams don't contribute much to their alliance.    But yeah, the reasons they aren't competitive usually end up being not only lack of experience or technical resources, but also because there is a huge time commitment involved with fielding a robot that is competitive. John V Neun, a very well respected mentor of team 148 put in over 600 hours between Kickoff and the end of Einstein, and it's not just him who's putting in that kind of time. My senior year on 1806 (2013) I was probably pushing 600 hours myself. To put in that kind of time involves staying at the workshop/school until 9, 10, and sometimes 11PM on weekends, and many schools, mentors, parents, and team members don't want the team meeting that late or taking up that much time. And while 600hrs per official season is a lot to ask, there are teams that meet 1-3 hours after school 5 or less days a week, and that usually just doesn't cut it.    Also, another thing is that teams don't use online intellectual resources enough. A lot of those struggling teams have never heard of JVN's Mechanical Design Calculator, or have seen all the resources hall of fame teams like Simbotics have on their website. And some teams just flat out over-estimate what they can do with their limited time, limited resources, and limited experience and end up with something rushed and barely functional."
FRC,3530ro,evanwork,1 point,Wed May 6 21:10:58 2015 UTC,"In Minnesota it is primarily a lack of experienced mentors, many of the Minnesota teams have just a single teacher coaching the team and maybe a professional mentor or two.

If the company in question has 47 offices across the country, then their reach is great.  PLEASE reach to government sources.  STEM is a big buzzword in education right now.  If states could get on board with FIRST and be able to help fund or support robotics in schools that would be one of the best things.  With statewide acceptance of a program we could see recognition of participants more equal to that of other sports and programs.  I can not speak for large urban schools, but believe that the teams are still a niche program, really great for those students/parents involved but otherwise mostly unnoticed in the eyes of the community.  Maybe if we had a game that shot footballs we would get more recognition.  As an example, I am from a rural area.  FFA (Future Famers of America) has more money to fund programs than you can imagine.  That is because of a national level of acceptance for the program.  If FIRST was to be on the same level, not only funding would come more easy, but the support from community members as well as school boards would be much improved.

I'm also unsure of how well new sponsor Monsanto's ethics and public image will reflect on FIRST, especially because those things seem to contrast much of our ethics and imagery.

FRC,3530ro,funk_wagnall,2,Thu May 7 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing that I think slows FRC's implementation across the nation is qualified mentors and support.      In the past it seems that extensive corporate sponsorship of teams was a given, and along with that sponsorship usually came engineering resources/employees of the company to help the team.      As the program grows, it usually ends up being implemented on a school level, not a corporate level, and as such schools figure they can toss a math teacher at it and call it a day. The team manages to get their KOP robot put together, with a vague understanding of most of the systems, and then gets their butts handed to them at a competition. On top of all that, the teacher is usually pretty burned out by having to spend a season teaching classes while learning a little bit of mechanical engineering, a little bit of programming, and a little bit of electrical. Of course there are curriculum available for FRC, but learning the curriculum can be challenging even for adults.      Now, what I am about to suggest has varying levels of acceptance in the FIRST community, but regardless of the nature of the competition and so forth, I think if you want FRC to become an incredibly widespread program, There needs to be extensive resources, made available during the season, to assist with designing and building a robot that is viable for the game that is being played that year. These resources need to be collected, cataloged, and almost ready to use off the shelf. I know... I know... CD has all these resources, but navigating it can be a pain, and on top of that, few of the resources directly apply to the current game, making them worthless unless you have time to spend analyzing them which most ""normal"" adults who would dedicate a ""reasonable"" amount of time to the program do not have.      If you are a basketball coach, you can go online and read about basketball strategies, then teach them to your basketball team, and it will generally turn out alright.     I guess what I see as being a huge (yet controversial) asset to the growth and widespread implementation of FRC is a group comprised of educators, engineers, and people in tune with the FRC community, purposefully engaging new low-resource teams and providing extremely defined lessons, budgets, and plans to support new or struggling teams. Not only with generalized resources, but personalized support. A person they can call the next morning when the coach spent the night before trying to figure out why their solenoids aren't firing. That is where I could see a corporation championing a very interesting (but like I mentioned earlier, controversial) resource that I think has the potential to create even more successful outcomes on a national level.      I'm not sure I would necessarily recommend doing what I outlined above, but if FRC is to gain momentum on a national level, I see this as the most direct way forward for the program."

FRC,34ytp8,iv597,7,Tue May 5 21:25:33 2015 UTC,"How could you possibly deny it?  Ranking based solely on scoring, separated fields with small amounts of cross-field interaction, hokey theme.  There were even teams that carried out large functions with a single command because, well, they could."

FRC,34ytp8,Danulas,2,Wed May 6 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"Not to mention none of them are set in stone. All these FLL-like qualities came at once because they all have this mangled cause-and-effect type relationship. No defense => split field => average scoring. Only the theme was separate, and that was incredibly minimal. A lot of people seemed to have lost hope in the GDC, but I'll wait until next year to decide if they've changed for the worse or have simply made a non-traditional game. After delivering 2014, arguably the best game in FRC history from many if not all standpoints, I don't think they'd move in 2015's direction permanently."
FRC,34ytp8,413612,6,Wed May 6 02:15:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. FIRST has recently shown that they respond well to criticism (except for the two Championship thing. That ""town hall"" meeting at the Championship was a total joke), so I don't think that this split field idea will stick for very long.  Aerial Assist was a little too defense-heavy and now Recycle Rush is so incredibly boring that none of us on our team can stand to watch it anymore. Hopefully they can hone in a game with a good balance.  On the topic of Best Game Evar, I would make an argument that Overdrive was the best game from a design standpoint. It wasn't the most exciting to watch, but it was easy to follow, had a meaningful autonomous mode, had multiple winning strategies, and MANY winning robot designs. It also offered a very unique engineering challenge with a scoring object that is bigger than the robots you're allowed to build."

Usually there is some public place you can meet in, if not just meet in someones room.  Don't meet at a restaurant, its too distracting, way better to eat and then do your picks.

Control theory is a huge field that really has many ties back to FRC robots, and is pretty much fundamental to any successful autonomous routine. A great project would be to see how your team's programmers could improve a control system on a past year's robot by researching methods used by other teams to drive similar mechanisms. If your programmers are into math and are sick of tuning PID loops, look at Full State Feedback and see how you could use such a system to control a subsystem on last year's robot.

If you have the resources and confidence to attempt to do something like this, by all means do! but be public about it.

I mean, I'm sure most won't have any kind of issue with the matter, but if I were to be public about it, I think it may play a biased role when it comes to Alliance Selections, or other events of the like.

FRC,34tj5y,1diehard1,1 point,Tue May 5 04:10:52 2015 UTC,"edit: should not attempt to reddit late at night, cannot markup  FIRST Ladies is a group of awesome people trying to get more girls interested in STEM, which FIRST has been encouraging recently. They're all community members, mostly females on teams or recent alumna, who see that as an important mission.  I think participants is the wrong word; people involved with the group are members of their community. I think part of the reason the group exists as it is, is that none of the people who founded it were established or experienced enough to be female STEM role models, as are often cited as valuable, but wanted to contribute in their own way. FIRST Ladies is a group of people building a community, with lots of members, rather than an organization that somehow renders services onto participants.  That said, I'm sure they'd love to have you. I know most of the founders quite well, so I can say that confidently. I don't know a ton of members, but I don't think they have many LGBTQ+ voices, and they're always looking for guest bloggers to share their story. (If that's a thing you're in a place to do, pseudonymyously or otherwise.)  If you have any questions for them you can contact them. Or if you're not even comfortable giving them a name and your email, PM me through your throwaway and ask through me, and I'll just talk to them directly. Maybe I'll send you some 6 stacks too."

FRC,34qlkz,TeamSoloMidfanboii,7,Sun May 3 18:36:47 2015 UTC,Batman & Robin. Aw yea. Very impressive. One of the fastest i've seen this season with 3 6 stacks with litter inside as well as one more stack of 3 or 4 totes. WAVE Robot's was also very impressive with their 3 can and 3 tote autonomous. They could pretty much use all 3 cans too. I also liked 1114's back arm as well. It was pretty fast and I thought it was a shame that it got broken off in the semifinals of Einstein.

You have to realize how much more consistent their stacking had to be for them to put up that many stacks/ since cans are worth 24 points, and at best Bedford only had 4.

Simply because I got to see hands-on how a swerve drive worked, as this year was the first time I'd ever seen a bot with that kind of drive mechanism first-hand. I was quite impressed by that drive system, and even more so when they were able to put up 3 stacks of 6 with cans and litter during one match. Overall a really efficient robot."

At the MAR Championship, as the #2 alliance captain, they picked 303 and us, denying an invite from 316 who was the #1 alliance captain (the eventual winners) in order to make their own alliance. We would eventually be the finalists of the event, and it was a great time to talk to and work with all the members of 1640. One could really feel that they cared about working with their two other alliance partners, and handing out lots of help along the way. We certainly learned a lot from them going through the event, in terms of design and strategy, which is very important  knowledge to gain for a smaller, less experienced team such as ours."

FRC,34qlkz,3a11,1 point,Tue May 5 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"As an alumnus, I did a lot of research during all my time in FRC and the reason behind their swerve drive being good is that they've been modifying and using a similar drive system for almost a decade now.  They never really do anything ""new"" with it, they just take a look at the old one, change a little bit so that it still follows the rules (also while getting it cheaper) and implements it every year.  It's a very good example of engineering over time, and looking at their drive system now compared to their initial swerve drive you can really come to appreciate all the work that went into making it what it is."
FRC,34qlkz,EccentricWyvern,1 point,Mon May 4 00:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've seen the records that 1640 has describing the improvements in terms of costs, etc. over the years.

FRC,34qlkz,Kitsune_Keira,13,Mon May 4 01:02:44 2015 UTC,"2826 - hands down best auto.  Really demonstrates that a tote set + container set should have been worth more than 28 points.  It was reliable and a work of art.  148 - best tether bot.  This was the most mind-blowing reveal and they lived up to the hype; many teams had tethered passive ramps, but few if any other robots lived up to the tethered mechanism idea.  987 - a flawless combination of one of the fastest can grabbers and excellent landfill capability.  254 - amazing fit and finish as always; highly efficient strategy of both landfill + ramp-based feeding, and a reliable auto.  Many teams improved dramatically this season, but 254 went from solid to downright formidable.  Not seeing 254 on Einstein was definitely a big loss.  There are many more robots that really amazed me this season (1114, 1678, 118, 4488, 330...).  Despite being one of the less exciting games in FRC history, the robots themselves were as inspiring as ever."

It just gives them more time to work on their manipulators."
FRC,34qlkz,Danulas,8,Mon May 4 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"I have too many favorite robots. Each robot I like is unique in its own way.  Auto: 2826 (Wave Robotics), hats off to them, their auto was AMAZING! Very few teams could get a 20 point auto, let alone a 28 point auto. Seeing this robot during Einstein was a highlight of my year.  Landfill: 1114 (Simbotics), their landfill strategy was top notch. They ate that landfill up, putting up 3 full stacks by themselves (and a human loader stack). I loved that they could use the upside down totes to their benefit.  Human Station: 148 (Robowranglers), being able to put up 3 full stacks (sometimes more) was killer. Using the rules to their advantage definitely played a part in their success. Who would of thought that you could have two robots, let alone THREE! Although Alfred wasn't seen much, it didn't hinder their success. (Some honorable mentions go to 4587-Jersey Voltage, they also were able to do 3 full stacks. Why were they not picked in elims at champs?)  Canburglars: 1678 (Citrus Circuits), without a doubt, they have the BEST canburglars. They focused on this all throughout build season, because they knew it was a choke-hold strategy. Through continuous improvement, they were able to have one of the fastest, and most reliable canburglars of any robot. One of my favorite teams! Congrats on the overdue win!  Capping Robot: 27 (Rush), they created a strategy, and they did it. Relying on their alliance partners to make six stacks, they were able to cap them with a bin, over and over again.  As you can see, there are to many AWESOME robots. I think they are all amazing, some better than others, and some that focus on one particular thing."

For example, if I were give another team a pair of can burglar arms for them to put on their robot, I would be cheesecacking that robot, by putting my cheesecake (can grabber arms) on their robot.  In the case of 1114 and team 900, they kinda skirted a couple rules by making their cheesecake out of COTS parts on the spot. 1114 designed a set of harpoon shooters that would secure the cans during autonomous, mounted on large bipods and teathered to team 900. Team 900 ended up scrapping the robot they came with (to make more room for the 4 harpoon's weight) and building an (adorable) kit bot for 1114 to mount winches onto. They never used it on the field, but it was still an impressive structure.   As for the origins of the term, there was a CD thread where the term was coined.

I was really happy to be in the same division as them so I could watch them so easily in the elimination rounds. I went to their pit and chatted with a few of their members.

The doomsday device makes the landfill pretty cluttered, so in matches where average matters amongst 8 or even 4 teams it might not be worth the risk. As soon as the format becomes win loss,  depriving the other team of the 4 cans is as good as scoring them yourself."

FRC,34m3b3,Helix9001,3,Sat May 2 12:03:36 2015 UTC,"We use a lot of 1x1 and 2x1 square tubing either 1/16 or 1/8th. When we CNC a plate we either use 1/16, 1/8, or 1,4, depending on the strength needed."
FRC,34m3b3,Valkonn,3,Sat May 2 14:09:22 2015 UTC,"This is the wrong question, but I'll do my best. For structural elements, most teams use 1/16th or 1/8th. Some teams make parts out of plates as thick as thick as 1/4"", but those teams usually have access to pretty advanced manufacturing resources.  For purely tension loads, thickness basically doesn't matter for FRC applications. It's advisable to go with 1/16th in these circumstances to save weight.  For combined loads, where a member will experience a combination of compression, tension, and bending moments, extrusion shape is much more important than wall thickness. You want the longer walls aligned with the direction you expect to experience a moment. Again, if you plan ahead, 1/16th is all you need. Thicker aluminum is really only necessary when you expect isolated spots to see high loads. Usually all that is necessary is reinforcing some 1/16th wall tubing by welding thicker plates in the spots you expect to get the most abuse, or using pillow blocks that distribute the pressure over a larger area.  Some tips: for FRC purposes, never expect a corner joint to handle a bending moment without 2"" or more of weld in the plane of rotation (I.e. Not along the corner between the walls!). If you can't do that, learn to love triangles.  The chassis tends to see the worst abuse from combined loads. 1/8th or 1/10th is usually not overkill here.  Learn to use CAD software like Inventor or Solidworks. Most of these have tools where that let you perform stress analysis of a frame pretty quickly. If your safety factor is ever less than 3, you may need to re-think things, or plan to make a lot of spare parts.  Hope this helps!"
FRC,34m3b3,acet1,1 point,Sat May 2 22:27:43 2015 UTC,"1/8"", 3/16"" are the plate thicknesses we use. We use the various VexPro Versaframe products with wall thicknesses of 0.030 to 0.1. We also buy 1/8"" tube for heavier areas."

When people are committed to the relationship first, they will stick together through the stress, sort out goals, and help each other out.   Another way I've heard it put is to build the relationships first - once the relationships are built, the group will all ""get on the bus"" and go places with each other.    Relationships first - then work.   What is it that everyone likes to do? Set up some regularly scheduled group activities and make sure they continue to happen.   It can have some very negative effects if you start building morale and then stop having events. (Ever get your hopes up only to have them pulled away? Don't do that)."

General situational awareness of what is going on in different sections and people's lives is good.   Showing understanding and competence is also good for captains. Ask questions about what people are doing to show that you care and know what is going on.   Don't be afraid to be stern and crack the whip though. If someone is falling behind or is being rude then tell them that and put them in their place.   Hope this helps. These are general rules for leadership, many of them apply to FIRST.

I found that freshman were often lampooned for asking basic questions, which is a great way to build resentment and bitterness, among other things. Be gentle yet firm if someone makes a mistake.  The best thing I could suggest would be to take an interest in all aspects of the team. Successful teams don't just have a winning robot - they have good imagery, great business sense, a good community presence, and above all else, a great attitude. A good captain knows whats happening on all fronts, and can mediate conflicts as well as serve as a bridge between the mentors and the students if necessary. S/he communicates with his/her 'lieutenants' and has at least an idea of what is going on at all times. Its a good idea to branch out from whatever you specialized in, and become a leader and adviser in all areas. With that being said, be careful not to micromanage.  Just as a side note, make sure that you're passing the torch. I don't know what you specialized in before you captained, but make sure you teach the younger kids how to do it at every opportunity. I did CAD and electrical before I captained, and I spent at least half my time during my junior and senior years teaching the younger kids not to cross the red and black terminals on a Jaguar. (You young'uns get those fancy Talon SRXs. Back when I was a freshman, we had to walk uphill both ways to the hardware store to buy a Victor 884...etc etc.) You get two or three years to hone your craft, and its your responsibility to the team to ensure that those skills get passed down. Of course, the mentors are formally charged with passing down knowledge, but they can be pulled in a thousand different directions at once, especially on small teams.  Perhaps most importantly, don't beat yourself up if you make a mistake. FIRST is about learning, and that learning applies to everyone on the team, regardless of seniority of involvement.

Have the team sign the mat - students, mentors, whoever else means something to them - with a message of their own for the person, and present it to them at their end-of-year party.   You could do this with general team photos, if you're looking for something for everyone - I think for our Seniors this year we're going to do something along that line. It won't be a dollar-value 'gift' as you're describing, but from the mentors on our team who have received this in the past, I know it's meant a lot."

FRC,34ae11,fuzzywuzzywuzabear,5,Wed Apr 29 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that everyone has different reasons to be involved on a FIRST team. It's hard work and means 0 talking and all listening, but find out why your other team members are on the team. At the end of the day, being financially well off is one of the only ways to keep participation going. You can use that reason to then get them to help. Remember, it's really really hard to get teenagers to do something they don't want to, but always be more excited about things they help you with than upset about things they don't.   As far as tools: I mentor a 2nd year team, and we're diving really hard into the Fundraising Toolkit - http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/first-fundraising-toolkit  Some things we're doing:   Developing a 2015 Sponsorship Presentation Developing a Sponsorship Level System Creating Cold Call, Email, and Face-to-Face Scripts Updating all our pamphlet/marketing material Making an organized database (spreadsheet) of all of the companies we are approaching, the status of our contact, etc   After all of above is done, we're going to spend months July to October contacting everyone we can find a phone number, email, in-person contact for.   One thing I've told my team repeatedly. For every 10 contacts, you may only get success with 1. There are teams with 20 or so sponsors, imagine how many people they talked to?  It's tough but you've got to try hard. PM me here or on CD if you need any help, but that fundraising toolkit has a lot of great documents to follow."

FRC,34ae11,ThePaulitician,2,Wed Apr 29 18:22:59 2015 UTC,"A really good fundraising idea is tutoring. I do it independently and I make $20/hour on average. You may be sacrificing your time, but it is 100% profit for you. No ordering products, no door-to-door selling; it's great! Try posting ads in Craigslist or in the newspaper and you can offer to tutor in a public library. Best of luck."
FRC,34ae11,Fluffyunicornfarts,2,Wed Apr 29 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"/u/popnbrown has offered a great write up and I'll like to add what we, team 2543, does and will be doing in the future. This past season we received close to 20,000, but more than half of that went from our sponsor to our FIRST account to pay for competitions. We did attend two regional and from my understanding we have 3k left. We have major sponsors that have offered support year after year and it's pretty much guaranteed money as long as we continue to submit our application every year.  This coming year we have a goal of 100k. That's a big goal, but one that is certainly possible. One key thing to getting new sponsors is looking presentable so you sponsors know they will be well represented. We, in the past, have done a horrible job recognising our sponsors and will be making brand standards to make sure they are represented. This will include certain ways our sponsors will be presented on our robot and promotional items we use at competition and at local outreach events. We are first focusing on strategic sponsors which are necessarily monetary. These past two weeks we have scored 3 sponsors that have offered Waterjet cutting services,  powder coating services, and self-storage unit. We have also contacted Lowes and they will be offering us a donation for tools and tables for our shop next week. Some other strategic sponsors we are after are aluminium welders and a place that can offer us discounts on aluminium as well as local food places that can cater to events like our FLL qualifying tournament. After we get our strategic sponsors, we will be getting strategic sponsors. We have identified sponsors that we think would be willing to donate to an FRC team and making sure people know that it is tax deductible since we are a 501(c)(3). Once we are done identifying all the potential sponsor, we will assign students that are in charge of contacting these sponsors and offering our proposal and what we can do for them. We hope we will be able to reach our goal like this. While 100k does seem like a lot, our team is in need of new tools. We have been using the same tools for the past 8 years and lack a lot of things. Some things on our list is a lathe and a 3-axis mill which will help manufacturer gearboxes in house vs. buying pre manufactured ones. We will also be using this money to help establish FLL, FTC, and FRC teams in our area, Mexico, Guam, and other places around the world.   I typed this all in my phone, so it may sound choppy, but feel free to ask any questions. If you need help something I mentioned specifically, feel free to ask and I'm more than willing to help."
FRC,34ae11,popnbrown,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:34:42 2015 UTC,Really really good idea on branding standards. We also do a poor job of this and it's pretty important to follow through on recognizing sponsors. Have you seen 1678's brand standards?   Also how'd you hook up with Lowes? We're trying to get tools...and hope to have a new workshop to put them in.
FRC,34ae11,Fluffyunicornfarts,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:17:51 2015 UTC,"I did not see 1678's brand standards, but I do know they have an annual goal of 135k and this year sponsored a rookie team. I'm glad they are doing great things with the money and hope 2543 can in the future as well.   I did see 1538 and 254 brand standards. That is where I got the idea.   I got the hookup with Lowes because my aunt is like the district manager and Lowes has a community outreach program so they will be giving us some free stuff. Try calling your local Lowes and see if they are willing to help. I know 987 did it like that and eventually got support from corporate."

FRC,34ae11,themajor24,1 point,Fri May 1 16:15:25 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, smaller donations add up. I'm personally a leading member of a team from a smaller community so getting donations to add up took a lot of time and practice for us. We always did as much face to face work as possible or at least when we first introduced ourselves, sent as many personal letters as possible and made sure the detonators all got an invite through our Facebook page and so on. Local businesses like to see programs like this and certainly love when the kids can be professional at it. It took leg work but this year we racked up more than enough to pay off our entry fees and equipment/materials expenses. I guess you could say the trick was just to get out there to as many businesses and personal detonators as possible.   I'm not sure how the situation in your area is but it's always kept us above budget, which isn't always easy when your town has a few small mom and pop shops.   Hope this helps!"

FRC,346xzd,frc_throwaway5,10,Tue Apr 28 20:04:37 2015 UTC,"I've spent 6 years in FRC as a student, and next season intend on being a mentor for either my team or another. 5-6 years ago our team was in a similar spot as yours. Mentors that were too controlling, and students that weren't entirely invested.   A few students often spent their time playing games and only would respond when mentors or dedicated students called for their help. What we did was created a sign in sheet where students would log their hours spent in the shop working on something either related to either FIRST or the team. If the students don't achieve the amount of required hours (still looking for a happy medium) they won't be able to attend districts/states/Other competitions. If a student is goofing off or flat out being lazy we tell them very brutishly to either begin working or leave/sign out. One of the top reasons apathetic students join robotics teams is to receive days off school not to be inspired.  Even after weeding out the apathetic students your still going to find students that still won't be driven, but still achieve the hours by actually helping. At that point don't take your time to motivate/inspire them, but offer them the opportunities to learn and be inspired. Also understand that if they aren't interested in what you're teaching them, and a different part of the team might be more fitting to them. I tried to work on the mechanical/ build side of the team for a few years, and ended up working and creating outreach programs and creating CMA/judge materials.  Our team used to be very focused on the students themselves creating the concept and robot, but our robot was normally mediocre at best. Our team wanted to become more competitive, but we still wanted the output to be a high school concept and creation. What we did was created a group called STRATEX, which is a group of 6 students and five mentors that make decisions for the team and the robot. Also the subgroups of the team had both a mentor and a student lead that had a check of power on each other. It prevents the mentors from domineering the team, but prevents high schoolers from crashing and burning  Also when you give students power to make decisions on the team they become more invested to the team, and begin to act as mentors to the younger students. Eventually you can trust these students to finish tasks without you having to tell them, and be able to delegate more work to the students.  In terms of other teams remember that other teams have different ways of measuring their successes. Some teams in the end only want to get to worlds waitlist or not. Some teams decline wait list invitations wanting to earn the position. Some teams don't even care if they get to worlds. Some teams robots are primarily mentor creations as the students watched. Some teams robots are vice versa. Some teams are even underhanded. All you can do is if a team does something you don't like is to speak against it, don't work with them, and report it to officials if necessary.  In terms of organizing districts and finding speakers I'm not going to be much help. But if you can't get professional or big speakers find former WFFA/DLFA winners from teams attending that event, and have them speak of their experience. As a student I have became really tired of hearing company/FIRST reps speak, but I've always loved hearing dedicated students/mentors speak about FIRST.  And everybody is frustrated with the splitted Championship events."
FRC,346xzd,SymbAA,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:29:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your hardships. Perhaps I could give you some ideas based on my team, 1710.  We have applications for our team. This both helps us avoid the kids who just want a few days off and encourages dedication to the team. In addition, we have required attendance (up to 3 absences) during build season, competitions, and when hosting our FLL competition, creating a sense of importance and weeding out applicants who wouldn't put in the work.  Our team is also very student led/run, to the point that our 2014 robot idea actually went against the general advice of the mentors (unfortunately, as we learned). This team structure has fostered personal commitment to our team's success, and I rarely see anyone slacking in meetings. We try to instill the idea that if there's nothing to do in your sub-team, there's probably something else you could be doing to help.  Our team's way of doing things may not work for everyone, but hopefully I gave you some ideas or inspiration to improve the experience of you and your team. Good luck in 2015-16 and please update if anything changes!  Edit: replied to comment instead of OP, oops"
FRC,346xzd,itsgravitybro,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:42:07 2015 UTC,"No worries I'll still read it.  My team is also student run, the mentors are there just to guide them. We do have a sign in sheet and you needed some amount of hours before you could go to the events with the team. We had no attendance requirements otherwise."
FRC,346xzd,SymbAA,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:33:51 2015 UTC,"I omitted from my original post that my team is mostly student run. I'm quite interested in your STRATEX, and how you structured that. What kind of checks do you have? Something like that could fit pretty well on our team.  A good portion of the students design process was to ask me if X would work. I'm not a person that would give definite answers unless I knew for certain. So I'd reply to the tune of ""Well it might work, I'd just look out for A, B , and C and make sure those issues are manageable."" Then rather than take that advice and iterate on the design a bit more, or perhaps prototype it, they would scrap the idea and try to think of something different.  I have a few friends that are WFFA winners, I'll give them a ring.  I think I'll let the dust settle on the Championship issue, that was just the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back."
FRC,346xzd,bestjayd,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:47:19 2015 UTC,"There really isn't a check of power, but both the lead student and lead mentor have the same authority on the decisions. If the two have different ideas they've got to at the least communicate, and come with a solution they both agree with.   For the first week we experiment with different prototypes to see what may or may not work, but we have got to commit to something at the end of week one. After that we'll continue trying new methods, but unless they are sensationally more effective we'll commit to what we have at the end of week one.   STRATEX is more or less where major decisions are made. The 5 mentors are elected by students, and the 6 students are elected by mentors; and at the beginnings of the build seasons we elect again.  During the build season STRATEX is normally concerned with what the robot is going to do, which districts/regionals we go to, and team side issues that come up during build season. During the off season it is concerned of how we are going to be financing ourselves next year, outreach programs, and what the plan for next build season will be."
FRC,346xzd,ThePaulitician,3,Thu Apr 30 05:12:18 2015 UTC,"I am a senior this year and was this year's captain for my FRC team. This season has been both a very difficult, yet fun and inspiring year for me. Since I was at the head of almost all decisions, even sometimes having more influence than mentors, I felt a lot of stress as well. The best thing I did during the build season was to limit myself on what I did. I am the main programmer for my team and so I decided to spend my time working on that and not managing the other aspects of the team other than design decisions. I think the most important thing I learned was not to get to stretched out during the season.  However during the competitions I was stretched way to thin. Because I programmed almost the entirety of the robot I was the one who had to find and remove bugs while at competition(due to having no test time during the build season) and on top of that I was going to help with the Chairman's presentation and be one of my team's drivers. It simply was to much and I regretted not being able to have as much fun as I usually do at competition.  Then after both of our competitions, we finally learn that we have been given a waitlist to championship! My team has never gone and since I am a senior I finally had achieved my goal to go to champs! However, the team was not nearly as excited (due to the bad timing of the championship and a general lack of enthusiasm from the kids). We didn't have enough interested students to go, so we had to give up our spot at champs, and that was one of the most disappointing decisions I have had to make. At that point I felt like there was no need to help out my team anymore since they no longer cared, but then I remembered all of our great mentors, who have taught me more than I could have ever imagined, and all the freshmen and eighth-graders who are always so enthusiastic. Now I am planning on being a mentor and volunteer with FIRST in college and after, I can't wait.  So my suggestions: If possible get some more mentors to help you out, it isn't fair for you to do so much. Also remember that their are still those students that have been truly inspired by FIRST and how much you mean to them. Lastly, you have a little time to think about leaving/taking a break; we have a nice amount of time until the next build-season. Come back and think about it in a couple of weeks; your decision might have changed.  Hope this helped."
FRC,346xzd,ThePaulitician,3,Tue Apr 28 20:48:24 2015 UTC,"I am extremely sorry to hear about the frustrations that have been inflicted upon you. As a member of a young 5-year team that lost a mentor who had been involved in the program for 17 years (since 1997), I thank you for your service regardless of whether or not you continue.  I am a 3rd-year FRC student and we lost a mentor after the 2014 season. The mentor had previously been a mentor for FRC 108 as they were the first team in Florida that began in 1996. He was with them until we formed in 2011. He came over to help us as a rookie team. However, our team was always extremely unorganized. We are nothing like that of our fellow teams like 1902 (Bacon), 180 (Spam), or 233 (Pink Team). Unfortunately, we have tried expanding the team to other schools and we have been only successful in getting students involved. What our team really needs is more parent involvement. We went to three regionals and the championship this year and we only had 3 parents with us at all regionals. We only were able to take 6 students to the Championship because of funding difficulties so only one parent went with us and one flew out individually with their child. I cannot stress how much our team could use another person on this team who is willing to get involved; someone experienced is very capable and can contribute invaluable efforts.  Our team for the past 4 years has had exceptional involvement from one student who is now our mechanical lead and team captain. His parents are extremely involved in the program; the father is a team mentor who helps us out with parts since he works as a retired military veteran at Home Depot and his mother works two jobs and still manages to do tons of travel coordination for us and scheduling. We really need more people like this. However, I myself have felt very sort of left out and wishing to help at times. It was only this year (my 3rd year as a student) that I got really involved. I was our human player since I played sports so I was quick with my hands and a good noodle thrower. But for the past two seasons, I never worked in our pit even though I thought I could help, the student I just mentioned and his parents did everything and still did most of the work this year, and I was just lost in the program in its entirety. I strongly remember one instance as a freshman when we were at the first regional I attended and everyone was wondering where our amazing custom-made spirit apparel came from. The father of our mechanical lead frustratedly told us he did it on his vacation time; I was so clueless and lost. I was so willing to help but then they hide they duties from everyone. This past season when we had to build our crate to ship, nobody got an invite so the same family built it and then was feeling as if nobody wanted to help.   When I was a freshmen, I originally wanted to code and program but our software lead never taught much in two years. He played favorites and only taught LabVIEW to certain students he favored. That worked out surprisingly well; he taught a girl in her freshman year and now as a sophomore she is unstoppable at programming. I've ended up just finding my own way. It's hard to explain. I just realized the holes in our team and filled them. Like I saw how nobody ever was extremely familiar with the manual and rules so I became the expert on that now and I also saw how my team lacked someone who can speak and tell someone who has no idea what FIRST is about our team and the program. I filled both of these roles along with becoming a helpful assistant in the pits during competition and of course as mentioned earlier, I'm now on the drive team. I realized that this program moves way too fast, at least for my team it does, and there really is no time to sit down and teach unless it's summer time and everyone is in town. As students, there are too many students who sign up as freshmen and do not realize the commitment they are about to make. This may be the reason for your frustration. I myself was originally a victim. I did not realize how much cooperation and support these programs take; it's inexplicable. It finally hit me in the 2014 summer. Mentors cannot encourage students to participate. It's like Einstein once said, ""I do not teach my students, I only provide an environment for which they can learn."" So please please please do not feel frustrated at not being able to get students involved. I can tell you so many people on my team who's parents want them to be in this program but in reality they do nothing; some have fortunately dropped out of our program. There was a student of ours who never would come to the build season meetings and all him and his parents did was beg for him to be on the drive team when he did nothing! Some students like myself will realize the REAL program and what is actually going on and what it takes in characteristics like commitment, discipline, honesty, and having your teammates backs, whether it be a student or a mentor. The students who are really interested will take an interest and you will realize it. This is a program that really takes time to familiarize with for a student, like as in a whole season. It takes people who have self control and can get out of bed early in the morning on every weekend and be on time to every build season meeting; they know when to put the controllers down and when to turn off Netflix. It may have been some time since you have been in high school (not to call you old), but these students are going through a lot outside the team. They are taking AP classes, some are dealing with relationships, and some are lacking motivation, like myself. Some students won't even realize how much high school counts until the second semester of senior year! I know you probably know this, but I am just reiterating. A lot of it with me has to do with my parents domestic fighting issues and I can't leave my house since I can't drive. Because of this, my grades have slipped and now I have to take 6 AP exams next week which I probably won't pass. I try to stay away from the high school drama that ensues, but it's hard to surround yourself with a great group of people who are willing to keep you company. The one thing I sort of wish I had back was sports. It was fun to play but I sort of gave up on basketball and soccer because of how good others were getting and I realized it soon was about gifted skill, unlike FRC. I sort of miss going to birthdays and parties and social meetings. I really miss being around girls because being around only dudes like myself can sort of get boring after some time because... well we're men you know :) Now, I have to go with my parents to see NHL games and MLB games for time away, but I always remember that my future will probably be bright some day. A lot of stuff in South Florida that goes on is the same stuff over and over. It's all gay marriage, abortion, and diversity issues which I am so over already. Robotics is my bridge over all this stuff. My school has a few teachers who want to commit more to our team, but some are getting married, looking to stop being teachers, and some are just tired of these awful executive decisions made by our poorly run school board; you can't blame them! If it was me, I'd probably be trying to sniff our the garbage too.You know, this season, our school principal never came to any one of our three regionals?? We have one local one and one about 3 hours away and she never made it! Gratefully, she gave us $3,000 to get to championships but she kind of had to since she never supported us and we won second place at a regional for the first time in 3 seasons. At the end of the day, it's a lot of time to devote that some people are just not willing to do. Those interested will be at every meeting with a winning, focused attitude. I don't know if it had been the same for you, but on my team, there are like 100+ students that will attend kickoff and then only 10 will return for build season and then everyone will show up at the first regional since we are fortunate to have a local one. We are just so fortunate that we have a very devoted main sponsor who funds us and provides us a lab to work in.  Those first two years for me, I was in the same position you are now. I could barely find the motivation to keep going back for the build season meetings. I soon was only going for the free pizza. Part of it was that fact that the same kids were being prioritized and setting themselves apart, not allowing any rookies to come between them. And I think that is something that FIRST as an organization does not realize: the struggles in developing team chemistry when you have significantly more experienced people than rookies. I get frustrated when the freshmen ask numerous easily answered questions, but at the end of the day they are interested in the program and at some point there will be a changing of the guard (or should I say gearbox heehee). The old will be cleared out and the new will be made way for."
FRC,346xzd,connorworley,2,Wed Apr 29 05:09:39 2015 UTC,"I cannot imagine the struggles being a mentor. Luckily for us, we had a new, young intern who has really stepped up with us and has become our senior mentor for mechanical as we surprisingly do not need much other help with software. Our one mentor who retired I guess was too accustomed to going to championships with his old team. But he missed out on this year with us! I can honestly say that you really realize that your team's strengths are revealed in their times of adversity. Even our team now is still struggling to involve more parents and students. We lack so much dedicated interest in students and parents. It's the same people who step up every year and I feel sorry for them, but they are getting the best benefit.  If I were you, I would try as hard as you can to keep being a mentor. Like I said, yes you can try to recruit but ultimately, the students make the decisions as to how dedicated they want to be. It's not the parents, it's not the teachers, it's not the students, it's not FIRST, it IS the students. In times of adversity like you explained you are going through right now, the true strength of your team will be revealed. Maybe start with a new mindset as Steve Jobs did after he was fired from Apple. It was great to feel like a beginner again, less sure about everything. If you can hold out now, the future only gets better. It may take 2,3, maybe 4 seasons but soon your team can be a prosperous powerhouse. Forget about the other teams. I always find that to be the most challenging part. Some teams are just so lucky. They are right next to NASA, or Lockheed Martin, or General Motors, or they have just amazing team flow and they have no challenges (like 1902). Forget about them. Like you said, you came in like the low 50s one year but you were proud and right you should be. Your robot is YOUR team's creation. You approached a problem and found a solution and somehow managed to make it work with struggles along the way.   As for FIRST itself, I think Dean's speech at Chairman's this year really said it all. Although you said you did not watch, I'll sum it up for you. Dean talked so much about how we need to stop with the executive decisions. I honestly do not think even he likes the 2 Championships idea. He talked about how all these increased sponsorships and new ideas will cost millions for both FIRST and the teams themselves. At the end of everything, it is all executive decisions that you have no control over. Not even Dean himself is able to control most of them! Just focus on the team and the team only. If you have money issues, start fundraising now. Need something with 100% profit? Try tutoring. I do it for my own living and I wish I could do it more often. You can even put it in your Chairman's campaign (oh... nevermind, that award is something else. We have outreached like crazy and not just for the award and we still can't win.) But just keep doing stuff as a team. You will bond better.  Regardless of whether or not you choose to continue mentoring, thank you for what you have done. You have touched lives and influenced them for the better. The world could use a few million of people like you. You work with people who at the young ages of 14-18 are trying to find a career path and you are exposing them to some of the most greatly growing careers. Just remember too with FIRST, it all comes down to time constraints for everyone... students, parents, mentors, officials, directors. That't why it is so important to act now, not later. Also, if you cannot be a mentor at the moment, maybe take a break for a year or two or maybe even mentor a new team; however, I know it would be hard for me to not watch the livestream on the first Saturday of the year... If you no longer want to mentor, please volunteer. If you are someone who lives close to a regional or district event, you save teams so much money. Thank you again for all you have done and I hope that I have changed your mind.  If you want to continue mentoring, we are located in South Florida. You can private message me or respond to this reply if you are interested."

You made me realize how much FIRST means to some people. It becomes their world. One team member a few seasons ago was going to end his world, I talked him out of it. I'm not sure if I'd trade that experience for anything.  I'm not sure if you changed my mind completely, definitely brought up good memories that I'm going to take into account when making a decision. If out of 20 members, I find that golden student that eats everything up, and comes in the following day with new questions, then it probably worth it.   If you want to continue mentoring, we are located in South Florida. You can private message me or respond to this reply if you are interested.   Thanks for the offer, but I'm a few states away from you.  Also you should give a good shot at your AP tests, you seem pretty brilliant and you might be psyching yourself out. When I took my AP exams (physics M & EM, and calc BC) I was worried about them. If you were truely lost in a subject you wouldn't know what you don't know. If you still think the load is too much, try just studying for 4 of them. It's better to get the credit in a few of them, than attempt all of them and get nothing."

FIRST picks good people to be key volunteers and I trust you do an excellent job. Maybe I will be able to work an event with you someday.  I have had the fortune of working with both NI and CTRE reps at events this year (they were Control System Advisors). National Instruments, being an Austin based company, mainly sends its people to southern events (especially Texas) and Champs. The truth is that there are not that many people who work on FRC stuff at NI. Also, none of the districts are close to Texas. Taken together, it is unlikely that someone at NI will show up at a district event. The upper level people, such as VP's, are busy (even Texas does not see them) and the engineers have 4 weeks of the season already booked for the Texas Regionals. CTRE and AM are small companies and, unless you are in Indiana or Michigan, you are unlikely to see them. The reps from FIRST come around once in a while, but it really is hit or miss. I have seen reps 4 times over 2 years as a volunteer, and half of them were various VP's.  Districts do get the short end of the stick, but I have hope that will change as more areas move to the district model; it puts everyone on the same level.  I cannot comment about the mentoring side, but I will tell you why I think you should consider still volunteering.  Why did you start volunteering? Do you get the same benefit from it as you did in the beginning and do you think the benefits outweigh the costs (financial, emotional, etc.)? These are question you should be asking yourself every year to decide if you want to continue. Also, you can take a light year and volunteer in some non-key role if stress is bothering you. If you don't mind my asking, what role do you fill?"
FRC,346xzd,SoMeDuDe904,2,Wed Apr 29 05:40:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I fill both CSA and FTAA, so its whichever I get assigned to. Your post made me think a good while on why I volunteered, and why I enjoy it more than mentoring.  I think I enjoy seeing the reaction after helping a troubled team. I give them a bit of advice, and they can usually fix it themselves. Sometimes I need to show them how, which I don't mind at all, but they are learning. I feel like as a mentor I keep reteaching the same thing over and over. That kind of makes sense since students are only on the team for a max of 4 years.  Even though those position are stressful, I find them pretty easy going. Perhaps that's just from experience. I do enjoy volunteering at events.  I believe we worked together at an off season.  edit - I am leaning towards just volunteering. I'm sure I'd interact with my team at events, so I don't want to burn the proverbial bridge."

The feeling I get after helping a team through an issue and seeing it click with them is beyond compare, even if the issue is trivial. That is what gets me back every year. I help out my old team a bit as well, but the fun from mentoring is very different from fun from volunteering, as I am sure you know. To me, the excitement in mentoring is dealing with the problem and watching people grow long term. The excitement I get from volunteering comes from the organized chaos, interacting with a vide variety of teams, and briskly walking around the field while doging flying gamepieces.  If you have volunteered at a Texas offeason in the past year, I have worked with you. Also, I have a decent guess as to who you are, but I will not doxx you."

FRC,34872v,LTGLambChops,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:44:39 2015 UTC,So i'm kinda confused. Will the simulation environment be provided and we just add our robot in if they do Unity? Besides that how useful are the simulations and what do you really use them for?

FRC,34872v,LTGLambChops,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:01:41 2015 UTC,One of the biggest reason my team wants to get a simulation would be because drivers and mechanical tea would be able to test their design before hand.

I'd be will to figure out how to get gazbo working for you, but it sounds like you do need a decent gpu (I'd say at least a gtx 750 or Radeon HD 7850 or Radeon R7 250).. The simulation isn't the best either (when I tested it back in feburary the first thing I did was fall through the map), but I'll definitely see how to get everything and see if I can get that into part of my lesson plan for this summer's programmer training livestream/youtube/skype thing.

However, yes you may be able to run Windows under a virtual machine on any machine with VM capabilities (and 3rd Gen or above Intel CPU, or an AMD CPU with AMD-VX on the CPU).  Be cautious, though, VMs are known to be laggy and poorly managed so I suppose giving the VM at least 4GB of RAM for windows 7/8/10 will suffice well enough. I certainly would not suggest the system for competition, but a dual-boot may be your best option. I'll post two videos here in a few days showing how to do both of them.."

FRC,34872v,LTGLambChops,1 point,Sun May 3 15:36:16 2015 UTC,Exactly. There are some issues with the VM that I was going to try to guess before it happened.. i.e. The VM makes the system thinks it needs to allocate all of the items thT have been setup (vm w/ 4GB of RAM means that a 4GB chunk will be preserved for your VM).. Unless you have excellent cooling on your DS. I wouldn't suggest doing this..
FRC,34872v,thatging3rkid,1 point,Sun May 3 16:54:00 2015 UTC,"Yes. But as the other comment says, it is very resource intensive. But, you don't have to make a full move to Ubuntu.  Edit: Also, with virtualization, you could run the DS on Windows and easily move between the two OSs."

I made another post on Reddit once already.."
FRC,345ws7,LTGLambChops,3,Tue Apr 28 15:44:53 2015 UTC,"I am a sophomore, and this was our first year we switched from LabView to Java. We have no adult mentor, and our best programmer is a senior who has been programming with LabView since his freshman year. Since he was used to LabView, we had to teach ourselves how to use Java and use it in robotics. The best place to look is online. Many people who learn computer science do so by teaching themselves, and there are so many sources on the internet to help you. I don't know what your personal experience in programming is, but for people starting out, the best place to start is learning a more simpler language. I started learning how to program in JavaScript, but many others who start do so in Python or web development or something. This may not necessarily be of any use to you in robotics, but it will certainly get you used to the programming atmosphere. All you do is search and you can find hoards of resources and tutorials on those beginner languages. For learning general Java or C++, the best thing I can recommend for you is also found online. There are many tutorials and free textbooks online that you can use at your pleasure. If you like, you can also buy a textbook, although I personally think that's a waste of money. For robotics specific programming, WPI practically tells you where to put what and step by step: http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485 Since I do Java, I can tell you that you're never going to use any of the stuff with Strings in robotics. Definitely understand basic logic, loops, and objects. If you're more advanced, understand methods, inheritance and properties of classes and methods. Again, the best place to look is the internet. You'll learn a lot more by trying programming yourself than just reading a book or taking a class."

I didn't know this until after I nuked 2013 off everything in favor of 2014. We have an 8-port cRIO, so the new image for the 4-port wasn't an option either, it was LV 2013 or bust. But, you could open a cRIO project in LV 2014 and work with it just fine -- all they had to do was allow the feature. I tried hard to run two versions on one computer, but because of the terrible way they handle the FRC Update Suite with hardcoded install paths (unlike the full LV installer), they would collide even if they were in totally separate directories (well it seemed so at least).  Just trying to straddle the fence with code for the old bot and new bot wasted SO much time. I didn't really have LabVIEW installed and working correctly until pretty much the last week of build season. It only took a couple of hours combined max to write code for the new bot, that wasn't a problem, but I was just constantly pulling my hair out messing with installers and what not trying to make the crap work right. Ughh!  It was just terrible all around and it all would have been solved by NI making the smart decision to just allow compatibility for cRIOs and legacy LV 2013 code in LV 2015 (which it already had, as I said -- you just couldn't start a new project with it, and a new LV 2015 project would not push to an older cRIO due to not having the latest image). Ridiculous.  With Java or C++, I can manage all that on my own."
FRC,342uy4,TheChewanater,2,Tue Apr 28 04:11:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay.  Yeah, the new Java and C++ stuff shouldn't mess with any legacy install you have.

We developed heavily character wise we did 2 regionals which was a smart move and managed to get in the 20s in the ranks of Central Valley Regional and we also got 12th out of about 60 teams in the Silicon Valley Regional and got to pick alliances (our team captain literally said he felt powerful when he got to pick alliances for the first time ever haha). The place we were in was an achievement in itself because, after the frustrating year of Aerial Assist for us we built a simple, and solid robot. It also personally for me felt good to be in the team for the first time during this year since I joined the team in the offseason of 2014. Another achievement was also our increased organization as well. Here is to a season of FRC. I hope we get even better next year even though we are losing some major team members with great skillsets. Here is to hoping we make it to World next year :)"
FRC,341i67,djdj_888,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:45:02 2015 UTC,"I actually enjoyed the new rankings system, even if just as a change of pace. I feel it needs a little polishing and a little work, but I actually wouldn't mind somewhat of a hybrid between what we have now, and what we had in the past. It makes sense that winning by 100 should have a greater reward than winning by 1pt, whatever that may be. That said, I do think this system disproportionately favored ""elite"" teams when applied (even if it sounded great on paper). It may also just be that this game was bad for a system like this. I'd love to see where we could go using the ""averages and cutoffs"" system.  I love that the students I mentored this year made my job pathetically easy. After an initial knowledge transfer in the offseason, they had the skills to do quite a bit, and from there the intuition and critical thinking ability to know how to find answers on their own, falling back to asking me only as a last resort (I mentored the programming and technology aspects of our scouting effort). I have no problem answering questions, but in the software field, exhausting all research options before falling back to ""tech support"" (in this case, my mentoring) is an admirable quality. Also, these kids know how to document issues they need looked at better than most professionals I run into..."
FRC,341i67,iv597,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:31:00 2015 UTC,"This is my first year, and it's been a blast. First of all, (no pun intended) I got to meet a ton of new, amazingly awesome people. From getting to know all my friends on my team, students and mentors alike, to seeing fellow nerds on other teams and meeting ""science rock stars"" like Dean and Woodie. The competitions were exciting and had a great energy. Only there could you collect and wear a ton of buttons, play on your old DS, dance like a fool then cheer on a robot without being questioned. Lastly, of course building a bot and learning all sorts of tech stuff is always fun, especially in the environment I just described.  Because it's my first year, I can't really compare Recycle Rush to past games because I'm not too familiar with them. Imo I found Recycle Rush to be very entertaining. My only complaint would be that set up between matches took a while. However all the volunteers did an amazing job, and I sincerely thank you guys for doing all that. Also who goes on to champs should've been based more on averages rather than wins. For example, our team won Pioneer Valley but the averages were only about 70 or so. Meanwhile other competitions had averages of 160+. This lead to teams with 80 or so averages competing against teams with 180 or so averages at champs, while teams with 120 averages didn't even qualify. I also noted that the atmosphere at champs wasn't as excited as it was at regionals, but I already made a whole post on that. I also really don't want two champs.  TL;DR: Nothing is 100% perfect game/champs wise, but overall FIRST and FRC are the most amazingly fun thing I've ever participated in."

FRC,33yzir,wifichick,6,Mon Apr 27 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. As a senior, a driver, and the lead programmer for my team, I made it my goal to make it to champs. We only had one regional, and we lost in the finals by 2 points. Needless to say I was beyond disappointed as I had worked so hard (wiring/programming the robot almost all by myself) to meet that dream and we fell within one tote of having another chance.   Although we didn't have the opportunity to compete in St. Louis, our schools Vo-Tech Director (and founder of our team in 1999) offered to allow a few of the hardest working seniors to volunteer at champs and experience it just one more time, since we made it in aerial assist.   And man, was champs amazing. I got to sit on the field and watch every match in my division as well as watch 1114, 118, 148, and 987 right next door. It truly was inspiring to be able to spark ideas from the best in the world (we are building an offseason robot).   I can't wait to mentor and volunteer for FIRST for as long as I'm available to, no matter where I am. FIRST has inspired me in more ways than I could imagine. It has been the best experience of my life and I believe it is arguably the best club/program any kid can join in high school. Not only do you learn so many things that you wouldn't otherwise learn in a classroom, you also meet some of the best people and make some of the best friends that you'll have for the rest of your life.   I wish I could somehow thank all of the people who make FIRST possible and all of the people that compete in it. Because without all of the people involved in FIRST, it wouldn't be so inspiring. So, thank you FIRST. It has been the best 4 years of my life, and it will bring more fun experiences as long as I'm in involved."

Every year its just amazing to me that someone from FIRST went to that arena, walked around outside, and decided that its a good spot to send 20,000 high schoolers. Especially in the gravel lot where the trailers and volunteers park, the streets are completely torn apart, there's overflowing trash cans, broken fences, panhandlers and all other kinds of stuff I would really rather my team not be around.  It really seems like the city of St Louis doesn't do much to maintain the area around the stadium or make it appealing to visitors."
FRC,33y6sm,413612,2,Sun Apr 26 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, it's the only place in the country that's centrally located and can hold 400 FRC teams, 128 FTC teams, and all the Jr. FLL and FLL teams' hotel needs, as well as having a connected convention center and stadium. Now with 2 CMPs the central location isn't an issue and the number of attendees is a lot lower."
FRC,33y6sm,iv597,5,Sun Apr 26 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Chicago are all reasonably central (at least east-west) and could have easily handled CMP events the last few years."

Not a criticism, I genuinely don't know. With the stigma that STL has for being one of the most dangerous cities in the world, I don't think FIRST would use it if it could be helped. I guess the same could be said for Detroit, but every block between downtown and midtown is being rebuilt in the coming years - the city is being revitalized."
FRC,33y6sm,iv597,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:51:22 2015 UTC,"I believe Indy has that. Come to think of it, the only thing in Chicago that could handle an event this size would be the United Center, which is of course out because both the Bulls and Blackhawks have playoff opportunities this time of year (and both had home games there this year right during the CMP week). And actually, I'm still not sure where you'd put the pits if the UC was used for the event... The convention center had C2E2 this weekend too so that's out. Hmm.  So we're down to Minneapolis or Indy. I know Indy could handle it. Dunno about Minneapolis specifically, maybe a local could chime in on that one, but location-wise and city safety wise, it's a solid choice."
FRC,33y6sm,maths222,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:40:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you wanted CMPs in CHicago, and we definitely have the hotel space, you would hold the event in McCormick Place.  Yes, it does not have an attached stadium, but it has large enough spaces that one could erect bleachers to seat a very large number of people.  It would also be ridiculously expensive."

FRC,3417hm,LTGLambChops,2,Mon Apr 27 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"You can, but it's somewhat of ""an inefficient implementation"".    Because of the way FMS handles packet prioritization, a lot of your calculation/processing is going to be wrong. Your control (joystick) packets will be prioritized first, followed by your 'custom' packets. What this means is, if your custom packets are taking up too much bandwidth, your control packets will continue to reach your robot, but your calculation packets will not. This causes information to be 'lost', dropped, not transferred, whatever you want to call it. Unfortunately, WPILib's control packet protocol is pretty inefficient (not horrible, just not optimized to the extent that it could/should be), so there's some bandwidth right there that you have no control over, Disclaimer: Yes, I know it's a fairly 'small' amount of bandwidth compared to the 7mb/s limit, but I thought I would note it down anyway. This is outlined in the FMS whitepaper.    Now for your implementation, I have an idea of how to solve this, and add some extra functionality. From what I can gather you want to know how far away the robot is from the Driver Station, yes? Well, my idea would be to use a Kinect. There are libraries available that I know for a fact will work on the RoboRIO. You won't be able to tell how far away you are from the robot, but you gain a lot more functionality in it's place. You can sense an entire depth map of what the Robot sees. You can compress this data down into chunks and then pass that off to the Driver Station to be rendered. Additionally, you can pass this off to a co-processor such as a Raspberry Pi if you don't want to put too much stress on the RoboRIO. If the issue you're trying to solve is ""Sometimes I can't see the robot so I'm driving in the blind"", this would be my best recommendation. The data compression also takes up less bandwidth than a normal camera (1 byte for distance instead of 3 bytes for RGB plus the 'padding' data the camera also sends).   TL;DR: You're going to drop packets. Moral of robotics: Transfer as little data as you can while still keeping the same functionality."
FRC,3417hm,JacisNonsense,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, I was simply curious if anybody had made their DS actually be the processor for their robot and only send back packets like ""raise lift 45in."" Then the robot would do exactly that. All of the commands would be local, but read and run on the rio removing some of the stress (maybe) on the rio."
FRC,3417hm,JacisNonsense,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:27:58 2015 UTC,"You could do, but you would need to clarify with the rules exactly what you can and can't pass off, as in that case the DS would count as a preprocessor. Take packet trip time into account too, as often it'll take longer for the packet to reach the destination than for the DS to calculate a response."

These companies are used to working a wide variety of different shows, and it would not be difficult for them to handle worlds.

At Michigan state finals this year, I couldn't understand a word that Dean Kamen said because his mic was EQ'd like shit.   Edit: The specific where the speaker was blown, the event was using a 2 channel (Left/right for each side of the field) center mounted line array that was installed in the building. The MC's mic was having a lot of feedback, and ended up blowing the speaker. From my position, I could clearly see that the microphone was clipping at the wireless reciever because it was cranked up all the way (wireless mics with gain knobs on the receiver should go die). This ended up blowing one side of the speakers (Sounded like a busted cone) and then they had to crank the other side to make up for it, making it sound even worse"
FRC,33ur6s,Mrtug269,0,Mon Apr 27 03:48:00 2015 UTC,You are correct there- districts are left to run their own audio systems. Regionals and the championship event use professional companies.

FRC,33tvcb,ReverseRacecar,2,Sat Apr 25 16:09:28 2015 UTC,With 254 out this alliance seems like one of the high top contenders. 1114/148 vs 987/2826 at Einstein finals?
FRC,33tvcb,PootyforNicky,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:20:34 2015 UTC,Its all about that 3rd robot. 987 and 2512 are winning the auto container grab every time on Hopper. 2512 is a decent stacker robot. 2 stacks or so per round.   EDIT: Container grab most of the time
FRC,33tvcb,SoMeDuDe904,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:32:54 2015 UTC,Yea maybe. Although they just got a score of 188 partially because of the tug if war with the cans in the center. That might be a pretty major problem later on.

FRC,33u5bk,oskay,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:46:02 2015 UTC,Can you explain why the arena announcer explained it that way then? Are you claiming that the refs are lying or falsifying what happened?
FRC,33u5bk,raging_goomba,0,Sun Apr 26 19:14:06 2015 UTC,"You're either violently misusing the term egregious or have an inaccurate understanding of what happened.  Given your statement ""reached over the wall to touch a recycling container"" I'm going to guess the second one.  Can contact had nothing to do with the foul."
FRC,33u5bk,oskay,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:52:38 2015 UTC,"I am neither being violent (WTF?) nor misusing the word-- again just repeating what they announced at Hopper.   I think that you are being unreasonably critical of me repeating what was announced there. I have done nothing wrong, and don't deserve your venom. Have you left your gracious professionalism back at the field?"
FRC,33u5bk,raging_goomba,0,Mon Apr 27 04:20:43 2015 UTC,"Game announcers tend to explain things inaccurately and it happens pretty often -- which is why many refs explain game changing penalties themselves, especially during eliminations.

As we've seen earlier, android phones determine location mostly by looking at the wifi. The problem is that it gets the fms wifi which has been all over and grabs that location where the fms was. My bet is that you're phone doesn't think you're in St. Louis so snapchat won't let you post to the story."

FRC,33u3ed,ThePancakeMan2338,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:31:43 2015 UTC,Not quite a tie as the based on the points in the final score our alliance would've won the tie breaker. In that case its even more unique that a foul made the difference of one alliance winning vs the other winning due to a tie breaker.

I asked him ""Do you believe in miracles?"" He replied ""No...It just won't happen."" I explained to my friend from abroad (via Facebook) the situation and he asked if it was even possible to advance.   ""No, unless everything goes wrong for the opposing team"" (at this point I was in deep despair""  ""AKA a school shooting"" (he's not a very sensitive guy)  ""Or a bot fails.""  This match. Oh my god this match. One of the bots failed.  274 and the entire crowd goes nuts. That made my rookie year for Worlds worth it so much."

FRC,33mnh5,Kennertron,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:01:51 2015 UTC,"Wow that is really strange. These fields are the same ones that were out at previous regional events, but stuff should have been cleared from the prior year. They must have made some software ""tweaks"" before CMP that screwed something up."
FRC,33mnh5,whitefur22,2,Fri Apr 24 13:40:21 2015 UTC,"This year, with the reworking of the networking setup they use on the field (mDNS, DHCP), there have been a number of issues with teams working just fine then suddenly can't connect to the field. Or a team just won't connect at all. This causes delays as nobody really wants to bypass a team when they were working in the past.  Now, if there are issues with the field software because they made ""tweaks"" before CMP, then that's a different story.  These fields have been around the country (I have a sheet somewhere that shows the truck schedule) at other events for the past 2 months. Having an extra championship competition just means that fields that normally would go back to FIRST HQ will be used at the second event. It's more of a question of support staff."

FRC,33mpjc,eric0045,8,Thu Apr 23 19:47:29 2015 UTC,I always hated talking to the drive teams with mentors as coaches.. The mentors would just talk over me and wouldn't let the students put in any sort of input..
FRC,33mpjc,CaptainEnvy,4,Thu Apr 23 20:08:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah frankly, there should be a lot less adult involvement for a lot of the teams I've seen"
FRC,33mpjc,trade605,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:34:12 2015 UTC,What makes you think this?
FRC,33mpjc,connorworley,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"I think the reason some students have gripes with the concept of a mentor coach, and this is from my experience so perhaps its incorrect, is that mentor coaches of teams are usually the source of my bad experiences with drive coaches, of all the times I've heard cursing and yelling on the field it seems to be from highly competitive mentor coaches. Now this is completely a case by case basis though, I have met many coaches that were wonderful to work with.  The part I feel more passionate about is the fact that student coaching embodies the spirit of first by allowing a student to take on a leadership position among his peers. I think that stripping a student of this for a competitive edge shouldn't be done. First isn't about winning every year, and if you build a robot that's good enough and your drive team puts in enough work, they can reach a level of proficiency sufficient to capitalize on your robot. Also in the extreme case that mentor coaching is banned, that competitive edge doesn't exist besides years of coach experience on the students though I don't think it will ever be removed due to previously cited evidence such as needing a mentor with students.  Note that my response both does not reflect the views of my team nor are meant in an accusatory manner."
FRC,33mpjc,Rflax40,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:13:24 2015 UTC,I am not against mentor involvement.  I think good mentors teach the kids and guide them to make smart decisions.
FRC,33mpjc,scottishkidz,3,Fri Apr 24 01:14:54 2015 UTC,Im on a team with an adult drive coach and he brings experience of having won a past world championship and multiple regionals. I am glad that we have him as a coach for the experience he brings.
FRC,33mpjc,CaptainEnvy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:48:26 2015 UTC,"Just at actual competition. I love our mentor because he will help us only when we need it. He used to be the coach our rookie year and decided that letting the students do it was better because it helped our team bond, but it was less stress on him because he's our only mentor."
FRC,33mpjc,connorworley,7,Fri Apr 24 05:38:53 2015 UTC,"Competitive advantage.  Drive coaches can participate for more than 4 years and get better with practice.  Having an adult drive coach probably helped these teams get to champs. Adults can typically handle the stress better than students. Avoids awkward situations where you might have a student drive coach who doesn't want to have someone on the drive team because they don't like them (maybe this wouldn't happen on your team, but HS drama happens).   Basically it's just because adults are more mature.  I was a student driver on a team with an adult coach for whatever that's worth."
FRC,33mpjc,SinisterTitan,2,Thu Apr 23 22:44:41 2015 UTC,"All very good points. Also, some teams need to have a mentor with students for insurance reasons.    I think dealing with the stress and gaining experience is the most valuable part though."

FRC,33ivbj,deravor,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:45:41 2015 UTC,One of those is mine!
FRC,33ivbj,sdh59,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:15:16 2015 UTC,That was fantastic. Too bad Nathan wasn't here when they arrived.

FRC,33ie9d,1chubbs1,3,Wed Apr 22 19:42:15 2015 UTC,As long as the current draw is in spec. We have put them on relays before.
FRC,33ie9d,awildtriplebond,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:59:46 2015 UTC,Thanks we'll try the same
FRC,33ie9d,JohnSmooth42,3,Wed Apr 22 20:15:00 2015 UTC,Any 12V power source should do. We've plugged our cims directly into batteries sometimes for testing(safety note: make sure to use alligator clips and be careful when you do it)
FRC,33ie9d,Woolly1806,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:05:47 2015 UTC,Can do. Thanks
FRC,33ie9d,simpsonboy77,2,Wed Apr 22 20:14:29 2015 UTC,"Also, if this is something you're going to do often, you should take an old 12V drill (preferably with a bad motor/transmission) and strip the motor and transmission out of it and run leads from where the motor gets its power out the front of the drill casing and crimp some alligator clips onto those leads. If you've made it right, it ends up being a bit safer than just using a battery, and is a handy tool to use in the pits for robot reset while the battery in the robot is being changed"
FRC,33ic42,JohnSmooth42,2,Wed Apr 22 19:26:48 2015 UTC,We (226) are.
FRC,33gxx2,trade605,6,Wed Apr 22 13:07:20 2015 UTC,"Why not keep doing FRC....? You won't be the one building the robot, but there's so many benefits to mentoring a team and volunteering at events that far outweigh the lack of building, though you may not be able to see that yet as a junior.  Give it time and you'll see. Take it from someone that started on a team back in 2003/2004, and has been mentoring and volunteering since."
FRC,33gxx2,fletch3555,3,Wed Apr 22 14:13:40 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be in college and won't have the time to mentor a team unfortunately, and I could manage building a small robot for a comp like that with a couple friends"
FRC,33gxx2,SinisterTitan,3,Wed Apr 22 14:29:18 2015 UTC,"You'll have way more time than you think. It's easy to overfill it but if you manage your time you can work, go to college, and mentor."
FRC,33gxx2,Omega_Walrus,2,Wed Apr 22 18:13:47 2015 UTC,"IEEE robotics is a college competition, i believe."
FRC,33gxx2,ElXGaspeth,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:29:49 2015 UTC,"They do. It's a little higher level and more expensive, but it's a lot of fun especially if you did FRC."
FRC,33gxx2,wifichick,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"Many people do find they can mentor around classes if they manage their time well. Far more than I would have thought. A 3rd year doctor is mentoring 2 - just figure out what ""bits"" you like and focus your mentor time!  Good luck in whatever path you take!"
FRC,33gxx2,Mashroor,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:36:07 2015 UTC,"If you plan to go to a university with multiple design teams, I'd suggest looking at those. Usually they're more narrowed down, but from the looks of it they look like a blast. When I graduate I'll be looking into the Formula SAE Racing teams, or maybe Solar Car. At the end of the day there's tons to choose from."

FRC,33d0q6,mixmastakooz,2,Wed Apr 22 02:58:26 2015 UTC,Do you think the tours to the top of the arch are going to be sold out for the entire time frc is there?
FRC,33d0q6,Vipperit,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:58:33 2015 UTC,Good question!  You can buy tix online so that's a good way to ensure a spot!
