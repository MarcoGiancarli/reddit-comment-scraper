Borderlands,3e2yw0,Hesitant_Alien-,13,Tue Jul 21 15:41:57 2015 UTC,You mean in the Wedding Day Massacre? Whittle down both enemies to a quarter or so of their health before killing one. I learned this the hard way when I started the DLC on UVHM and they each leveled up twice before I got the hang of the fight.
Borderlands,3e2yw0,Quentin_Coldwater,10,Tue Jul 21 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"you need to try whittle down their health to near zero before killing one of them. the other will then attempt to revive the fallen one, take them out before that happens.  But, like normal goliaths, the bride and groom level up, with the difference being the revivial is used as the level-up trigger. If you want the legendaries and shit, let them level up to Godliath before taking them down."

On a side note: Make sure you have a cooldown relic equipped, NOT a melee relic.

Many Must Fall and Death Bl0ss0m work so well together once you understand them.  Then its all about gear.  An evisceration (bladed) grog nozzle for healing.  A good roid shield (I like the love thumper but it has friendly fire and is only good for solo play).  A chain lightning grenade mod from TTAoDK to regen grenades and for insta heals when you're holding the grog.  And a rapier (200% melee damage) once you get used to surviving to swap between the grog.

Borderlands,3e3lc9,Muffinofrage,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd remove second winds entirely. There's too many ways to exploit them, they're too finicky, and whenever I second wind and save myself too many times in a single encounter, it doesn't feel like I survived by the skin of my teeth; it feels like I exploited a scrappy mechanic. And remove the health gate too; it makes literally no sense how GB thought actually needing lower health and a very specific subset of healing weapons to live in the lategame was good design. Of course, with these changes you'd actually need to balance enemies in TVHM and beyond."

Join a co op game to kill him to avoid being destroyed by his health gating bullshit.   If this is impossible, maybe try pure melee, sniping doesn't work due to the fact that he has no crit spot, it'll just be tedious. Grab a bladed Rubi and go to town on his ankles (or a Law and Order combo to just keep your health up).   With you current build, maybe try just kiting him around with Kunai and sheltering in the shack when he winds up his big attacks. You can tell when he does his shock lazer thingy because his elbows(?) glow blue for like 5 seconds before he attacks with them.   Or, grab a corrosive rocket launcher, fully spec into 1 shot 1 kill, shoot him, take cover and reload, rinse and repeat until he's dead or you run out of ammo. When you run out, Deception out and buy some rocket launcher ammo. Repeat.   Saturn's just a bitch for solo Zero in TVHM and UVHM. A tiresome b0re if you will.   Actually bore fucks him up with TK's Tidal Wave, but that is like the only situation where that gun is good (because of the turrets on his body)."

The addition of low-gravity areas and the double jump allows them to do more with the real estate they have.  The Nel puzzle basically could not exist in BL1/2.

Borderlands,3e04le,CaptainRipp,6,Mon Jul 20 23:58:59 2015 UTC,"Cryo > Slag  It's so much better it's silly, actually. Requiring players to Slag and switch constantly was just a way to make everyone carry one otherwise useless weapon.  When they removed BL1's stun mechanic from BL2 we lost crowd control. Yes, Maya had Phaselock (and Converge to boost it) which was pretty awesome most of the time, at least through TVHM. Still, the scaling in UVHM was brutal and the ""immune"" enemies (fuck Witch Doctors) made her nearly useless in some fights. By about L55 she couldn't even hold on to one guy long enough to kill him, so at best she was able to make one guy turn coat for a minute or so.  Jump to TPS and suddenly every character class has the ability to take enemies out of the fight for a bit while increasing their damage. You can pick out the badasses and lock them down while you try to pound them flat or you can spray ice over a bunch of mobs to thin the hail of bullets heading your way."
Borderlands,3e04le,Mysterious_Andy,23,Tue Jul 21 12:49:31 2015 UTC,"Pre-Sequel dynamically adjusts late storyline mission levels to account for the player leveling more or less quickly.  Makes it a little harder to overlevel the endgame.  Pre-Sequel removes broken, game-wrecking gear like Unkempt Harold and The Bee, forcing loadouts to diversify.  Pre-Sequel fixes aspects of Borderlands' broken economy by restoring desirable, high-rarity items to vending machines, then introducing competition to those vending machines in the Grinder.  Every grind comes at the expense of not being able to sell the weapon... every weapon sold is a weapon not ground to a higher rarity."
Borderlands,3e04le,Daemmerung,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:59:54 2015 UTC,"Unkempt Harold and The Bee aren't even that good in end-game though. It's not a gear issue, it was a scaling issue (and imo it wasn't an issue, I WANT end-game stuff to be near impossible).  The UH or The Bee, some sort of exploitative build are almost necessities at OP levels (which should be the case imo), it's just a matter of poor scaling that makes them broken as hell outside of that.  I think a great solution would be having a legendary weapon multiplier that evolves throughout the different playthroughs. In the same way that Slag goes from 2x (in Normal/TVHM) to 3x (in UVHM, Legendary weapons should receive a small multiplier, so they are still a necessity for end-game, but not so broken otherwise."

Borderlands,3e04le,MegamanX775,13,Mon Jul 20 23:33:46 2015 UTC,"Basically the core of the game was entirely an improvement on BL2, except for the writing I guess (I didn't hate TPS it just didn't work as well as BL2).  It just lacked content.  I feel like a broken record answering these topics all the time but that's really all there is to it.  If 2K Aus had done more campaigns in a timely fashion it would easily surpass BL2 in quality as far as a DiabloFPS goes."
Borderlands,3e04le,Tsplodey,7,Tue Jul 21 01:06:40 2015 UTC,"Not mentioned yet, but unique defensive strategies for each character. The Moxxi abuse that was rampant in BL2 was virtually nonexistent in TPS. Yes, the Probe nerf was part of it, but characters' skills allowed them to survive well without having to switch to a Moxxi gun all the time. Aurelia might be the exception, but she's supposed to be the glass cannon character, so that's okay."
Borderlands,3e04le,brandpanz,3,Tue Jul 21 01:46:00 2015 UTC,Part of that was probably the lack of difficulty curve too.  I'm guessing the Probe would have been abused harder if TPS had an OP8 difficulty.

It's still exponential (which is the correct decision IMO) and it may not look like a huge difference, but it means that weapons remain relevant about 30% longer. In BL2 the obsolescence curve was a bit too harsh. More voiced protagonists. Athena's narration, especially that the narration in the second playthrough wasn't just a repeat of the first."

I really like The Presequel, by the way."
Borderlands,3e04le,DomRomanNoodles,5,Tue Jul 21 04:53:45 2015 UTC,Cyro is a much better element then slag. Double jumping was amazing so was all movement you could actually avoid boss attacks and not have to tank damage holding a grog nossle.  Vault hunters talking was also a great way to make you feel more immersed into the game. All the law in this game fills the gaps between borderlands 1 and borderlands 2 and makes BL2 feel more detailed then it originally was.  My only issue with TPS is the community boycott the crap out of the game and therefor 2kAUS couldn't make any more dlc's due to bankruptcy. :( A black market dlc with Janey would have been so epic.
Borderlands,3e04le,NeoZenith1,7,Tue Jul 21 08:24:36 2015 UTC,It's the little things IMO   Your characters actually communicate  Level 3 skill point (it's only 2 less levels but it sure is amazing) You get 4 weapon slots pretty fast Reviving with Oxygen

Borderlands,3e04le,ProfessorEpic,3,Mon Jul 20 22:54:36 2015 UTC,I think the pre-sequel hate came only early on in its release due to lack of content & unfarmable bosses. I just got the game during the summer sale with all the DLCs and it's pretty awesome all around. Is there still a lack of content now? A big yes compared to BL2 - so with no DLC in the beginning & just completing the side missions - the game was just severely lacking then.
Borderlands,3e04le,jayen,3,Tue Jul 21 03:29:09 2015 UTC,"Skill tree was by far better in the pre-sequel than anything bl1 and bl2 had. A lot more quality game changer skills, and you had more T4 and T5 skills. Also a lot of sweet gun skins, moonshines weapons (the use of secondary accessory) glitched guns, and lasers. I would pay money to get to use the TPS class and loots on BL2  The mobbing felt underwhelming. Too few arenas and the lack of a lot of ""mobbing heavy"" maps killed TPS for me. Also the fact a lot of the map didn't loop around itself, so you had to backtrack all the way back to the fast travel (in an empty map because you just killed all the mobs). That is a lot of downtime and that's poor map design (as pretty as some of them are).   I am sure there are a lot more (Cryo as a better debuff over Slag and the Grinder / Jetboost...SpaceJam)....but the loot and class design stood out to me the most."
Borderlands,3e04le,abvex,3,Tue Jul 21 07:43:21 2015 UTC,"Actually I love tps a lot because :  1.Better classes: yup I like the classes more, to me the doppleganger action skill is everything turrets should've been, doing the same role without limiting your mobility or restricting you to the ""turret"" survivability...aurelia's action skill imo is an enhancement on maya and wilhelm's wold is how deathtrap should've been not limiting itself mainly to melee  2.No slag or slag counter part that is forced upon you on higher levels  3.Cryo element was fun on its own and made explosive weapons more fun and sniping easier  4.lasers...yeah  5.glitched weapons...yeah"
Borderlands,3e04le,catherinesadr,2,Tue Jul 21 07:47:01 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, Claptastic Voyage is one of my favorite DLC out of all the games (Assault on Dragon Keep is still better). But, TPS looses in the DLC war to Borderlands 2. Borderlands 2 only has 1 bad DLC, Hammerlock's DLC. I cannot say how good or bad the DLC for Borderlands 1 is, however, since I haven't gotten that far into the game yet.   One of the worst things that they could have done with TPS, in my opinion, making it so you cannot mark items as trash. I also hate how they removed COMs in favor of OZ kits, and how they made it so keys wern't universal for all of your characters.  I know that most of these complaints are minor, but in all honesty, its the minor things that make a game better remembered than its  competitors.  If 2K would have releaced more DLC for TPS, then I think that it would have been a better game than it currently is. I know that a lot of people shit on how bad the final boss is for Claptastic Voyage is, but I think that its fun. Gives us basically a free raid boss. I enjoy the challenge to try and find the build that can take him out.  There are a lot of things in TPS, that if they did not fix (Farming in specific), I most likely would try and get a refund if possilbe, even though I have had the game for much more than 6 months and I have WAY more than 2 hours. If it wasn't for the fact that I can now go and farm all the good gear in the game, AND for the fact that Claptastic Voyage DLC is a thing, I would not be playing the game anymore.  Enough ranting and shitting on the game. Overall, TPS is not that bad of a game, but we had Borderlands 2 to before hand, which set our standards a bit high. If it wern't for that, if TPS came out BEFORE Borderlands 2, it would be a much better game. They just didn't make that great of a decision on putting out a filler game. Even though it does have a lot of useful information about the history of the games, it would have been better to have TellTale work on TPS or to have decided to make a game that took place in between Borderlands 1 and 2 before releasing Borderlands 2.  I know that we are all excited for borderlands 3, with how they are letting the community help make the game, but I don't think that we should set our expectations too high, after TPS. I do hope that 2K and Gearbox realise that if they don't do a good job, they will loose A LOT of fans of the borderlands series. If they do a great job on the game, more power to them, but if they fail, they can go ahead and say bye to me and a lot of other people."

BL2 lacked that for me, outside of the DLC's. plus the lasers! i hope they expand on that. cant forget the grinder! but it needs improvements. cant deny that, but its a great idea! maybe make a special kind of weapons only accessible through it. i would use it more that way. i rarely use the grinder but its a great idea that wasn't taken advantage of, so i can think of more stuff but my mind froze :[   i'll make sure to edit this as i think of more stuff :)"

I also felt the TPS Vault Hunters had a lot more depth than the playable ones from the last two games. Nisha is such a pleasant surprise. The level design became a hell of a lot more interesting (both vertically and horizontally) due to the Oz kits.  I enjoyed traversing the world a lot more because of this. Do I want to jump around? Do I want to double jump around? Do I want to aim for a random bit of architecture and butt slam onto it? Lasers > slag. The elemental effect variety in the lasers was great, too.

Unless you're going for something build-specific (FotF for Hellborn Krieg), this is probably the best shield in the game.  Important to note though, the 94% absorb chance (highest available) is only one variant. I've seen them as low as high-70's. Since the shield has incredibly low capacity even by absorb shield standards, it'll only take a bullet or two actually hitting to break it, so not having the max absorb chance variant really diminishes its usefulness. Sounds like a stretch, but that ~20% added absorb chance is huge: think of it the opposite way, 6% of bullets getting through vs >20%. That's almost four times as many bullets hitting you.  If you're using gibbed, that's not a problem. If you're farming, especially in BL2, good luck. Farming this thing is a bitch... Ironic, since you might even find a bitch along the way."
Borderlands,3dyj9a,BlackToothBob,10,Mon Jul 20 16:59:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's the best, that would go to the Antagonist.  While it's great against bullet enemies, things like psychos, rabid stalkers/skags, and nomad arsonists make it near-useless."
Borderlands,3dyj9a,nathanj0872,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fair point."
Borderlands,3dyj9a,BlackToothBob,7,Mon Jul 20 22:14:10 2015 UTC,"The Sham.  The King of the Absorb shields.  Rather than having a good capacity, or a fast recharge or anything, the Sham's claim to fame is its ridiculous absorb chance, which also doubles as damage reduction against enemies who wield guns.  The Sham is easily one of the top shields for Axton and Gaige, and it's pretty good for Zer0 and Maya.  It doesn't offer much to Krieg except the opportunity to replenish rocket ammo.  It's sort of a mixed bag for Salvador - some builds might like it because its damage reduction ""stacks"" with Salvador's inherent damage reduction in Gunzerking, but most Salvador builds have a style which is so heavily ""charge forward"" oriented that once your shields go down, they stay down until everything is dead, and there are other, better shields for that play style.  I really like the Sham, but it is such a ridiculous farm that it is not a farm I recommend at anything but max level.  The Bunker encounter is pretty tedious, as far as boss encounters go (it's highly mobile and often can't be hit while it's moving), although Zer0 and Maya both have skills that happen to abuse its massive hitbox to kill it in only a few shots.  In addition, there is so much loot the Bunker can drop that it can take a hundred Bunker kills for a single Sham drop, which can translate into somewhere in the neighborhood of 500-700 kills before you get a Sham with a high enough absorb chance to make the shield worth using.  To be fair, a level 50 Sham is still somewhat usable at level 55, so if you enjoy the Bunker encounter, it can be viable to farm for the Sham at multiple levels.  Ultimately, I think the Sham gets a thumbs up.  It is a huge pain to acquire, but its fun factor is high and it is very powerful."
Borderlands,3dyj9a,cannons_for_days,4,Mon Jul 20 19:41:14 2015 UTC,I'm glad this is here.  I just got a Sham from BNK3R yesterday and I'm confused on how to use it.  Relatively weak shield but I'm wondering if absorbed bullets do not do damage.  What about loaders?  I assume lasers and rockets are not absorbed.
Borderlands,3dyj9a,RonnieHasThePliers,11,Mon Jul 20 16:54:38 2015 UTC,"It absorbs a lot more bullets than a normal absorb shield - up to a ridiculous 94%. Absorbs do negate the damage, and rockets are included.  The main benefit is being able to regenerate crazy amounts of ammo on ammo-hungry characters, and obviously absorbing a serious percentage of shots that would have hit you."
Borderlands,3dyj9a,nickiter,4,Mon Jul 20 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Absorbed rounds do no damage. However, there are lots of projectiles that cannot be absorbed. The rockets that badass loader launch from their shoulders, lasers, the projectiles from engineers backpacks, rockets from constructors. Basically, the shield only absorbs ammo types that the player can use."
Borderlands,3dyj9a,OGNick,3,Mon Jul 20 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"Sham has always been my favorite shield for Salvador and crazy-ROF guns like a pair of shredifiers - just walk into the middle of bandits and keep shooting until the corpses stop twitching.  Sure, there are some more tactically sound options in other scenarios, for isntance it's nigh-useless in Dragon keep (nobody really shoots you with bullets, I think even skeleton arrows count as melee).  but where it applies, it's fun as hell.   Another place I use the sham heavily is on a rocket-axton build, ""Logans Gun""'s bullets count as rockets, so if I need more ammo, I just shoot the ground at my feet with LR, and absorb new rocket ammo."
Borderlands,3dyj9a,databeast,3,Mon Jul 20 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"Awesome shield, it is included in one of the better combos in the game, shamfleeting. My second sham that i got was perfect so i am very happy with that, its probably the only item that i have with perfect parts. Gaige+Sham+Norfleet+400/600Anarchy= raid bosses are a fcking joke"
Borderlands,3dyj9a,dominic_se,2,Mon Jul 20 17:21:03 2015 UTC,"Pretty awesome shield, although not something most people use end-game except for massive cheese with the Norfleet.  Although if you use rocket launchers like the Nukem or Badaboom I think this is a near must-have to keep yourself from going down and being able to give yourself rockets.  Still slightly cheesy but nowhere near like using it with the Norfleet.     Is this weapon worth farming?   Depends on who you are.  If you're like me and willing to put in 50+ runs, sure.  But it means fighting BNK-3R so you have about a 1% chance of it dropping.  That's not hyperbole either, out of the 9% rare drop chance, you have a 1/8 chance of it actually being a sham (0.09 x (1/8) = .01125)"

Borderlands,3dxvq0,cannons_for_days,8,Mon Jul 20 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"I am fond of melee Maya.  Bare-bones version of the build.  Next step is acquiring Life Tap.  Sustenance is useful before level 50, Elated is better in UVHM.  After that, it's kind of up to you.  Scorn is the obvious low-hanging fruit at that point, but it isn't really that big of a deal for the build, to be honest.  Thought-Lock isn't bad, either.  (Arguably this is the build for which it is best, since it doesn't rely on Wreck or Chain Reaction for damage.)  Ultimately you'll want Backdraft, but you don't have to make it a priority since the 5 points in other things in the Cataclysm tree are kind of going to waste.  The build basically comes down to this:  have either the Rough Rider or a long cooldown Roid shield (Flame of the Firehawk can also be good if you have a long-cooldown one and you're up against fleshies).  Have a bladed weapon (Law, Rapier, Evisceration Rubi/Grog Nozzle, whatever.)  You are now running around at high speeds with either damage reduction or a huge melee damage boost.  Damage to your health has a chance to hurt your attackers.  Once you get a kill, you reflect bullets and all damage you deal heals you... including that Recompense damage.  I think the official writeup of the build recommended a Warder class mod for the +5 to Recompense, but they also said the build needed a Grog Nozzle, and I think that's the wrong way to think about it.  Matriarch and Trickster are both very good for the +Life Tap.  Banshee could also theoretically be good, but I have met with no success with it.  It's an extremely fun build - it lives at high-speeds, and it dies more to other melee than to that dude firing rockets at you from across the room."

How come only 6 can exist at one time? What's the selection process for ""choosing"" a Siren? Why are they able to be born to regular, non-Eridian parents? Can a male Siren exist? (still holding out hope for Siren Brick)  For the story itself, I'm pretty certain it's gonna be about the multiple Vaults shown in BL2 and the mysterious Eridian Guardian from TPS telling Lilith to assemble as many Vault Hunters as possible, for the impending war.

Imagine a Destiny-style raid, but with the loot and fun of a Borderlands game. And obviously some decent loot exclusive to the raids, so there is an incentive to play them. There could be a main storyline, and have these as optional activities, but somehow tie them in to the story. Sorry if it seems like I'm rambling, this went from an idea to just thinking out loud."

Borderlands,3dy0rz,abvex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:04:58 2015 UTC,"Destiny's raids are designed for 6 people. They normally consist of multiple parts with unusual mechanics and puzzles to get through.   The first Destiny raid starts off by entering a giant room where enemies come at you from all sides and you start by defending these pillars from the enemies.  (Kind of like the story mission in Overlook in BL2, but if too many enemies get to it, you lose the round and start over).  Next, in the same room, these objects called Oracles pop up during the battle. They need to be destroyed or else they wipe your team. They're not hard to kill, but you have to know where they'll pop up or you might miss them. Then, still in the same room, you have to deal with a mini boss. There is a special weapon that appears that one player takes hold of.  It had to charge and, once it does, that player can take down the boss shield.  Then, everyone pummels it until it's shield goes back up.    Then you go through a maze filled with creatures that, if they see you, they kill your party. You can kill them, but it's much easier to just avoid them.   Next is a puzzle I refer to as the Megaman puzzle because it has those disappearing blocks like in some of the old school Megaman games, but in 3D.   Then you enter a final room, where you have to go through another puzzle or a sort while dealing with enemies, followed by the final boss, which takes another set of coordination.   If you want to look up the raid, it's called the Vault of Glass and it's all over YouTube.   As you can see, it's much more complicated. Due to the number of enemies and the need for the special weapons, you can't do it solo, even if you were 20 levels above the enemies."
Borderlands,3dy0rz,cscottaxp,2,Tue Jul 21 11:32:24 2015 UTC,"This does should a lot more interesting. So Gearbox would have to assign a whole map for a raid, which would be ok for me. Sort of like Digipeak with defend / sneak / puzzle section....."

It'd be cool to have it set a few years later, Atlas has rebuilt and become the big bad, snapping up vaults left and right. So to combat them, you have to enlist the aid of the heads of each other manufacturer.   Jakobs CEO can be either a young hipster type guy, or an older vaguely racist southern gent.   Maliwan can be a Steve Jobs caricature who speaks in cliched western philosophy type dialogue  Vladof can be an eastern European woman who you have to beat in a drinking contest.   Torgue is Torgue.

Most likely thing that is happening is that one of the explosions in the chain is triggering an environmental hazard, such as a barrel, and that is what is damaging you.  The explosions themselves do NOT affect you or your teammates, so no a shock nova won't get rid of shields for you. That being said, if your wife (or yourself) is looking for a way to quickly deplete her shield, she should look for a shock grenade and just throw one at her feet whenever she needs her shields down. Best is Chain Lightning/Lightning Bolt from Tiny Tina's DLC, because the effect is instant and the grenade itself regenerates ammo (additionally, if thrown at your feet Chain Lightning will STILL hit everything in the room because it's just so awesome), but other grenades such as Teslas or bandit shock mirvs will also do the job."

That's not exotic at all. That's two gun types that are stock weapons in any other FPS and a gun that's basically a Halo Needler.    The ""shotgun that shoots rockets"" almost seems like a self-aware bad joke considering how boring the gun selection in the Borderlands games actually is."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,SoulUnison,17,Mon Jul 20 06:06:36 2015 UTC,The original Borderlands was a little more interesting in that regard. I remember flipping my shit everytime I found a gun with a new bullet flight pattern... it was hilarious.
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Schwachsinn,5,Mon Jul 20 14:15:11 2015 UTC,"That and they need to bring back ALL manufacturer and gun type combinations. I want maliwan shotguns again, torgue snipers (besides the hella hard to get cobra), and other combinations"

At first he's this engineering genius with grand plans, but by the end he's an insane murderous barbarian king with a broken throne. As much as I love BL2, TPS has it's own appeal which can't be compared to the other games."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Buffthebaldy,10,Mon Jul 20 09:49:58 2015 UTC,"I like the weapons and mechanics more, but I favor the enemies and environments in BL2 better. I wish they could mesh the two."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,PatientZeroo,21,Mon Jul 20 08:08:09 2015 UTC,"Hear hear. Like, the hate it gets seems to be fore the lack of end game, but the end game for BL2 wasn't that great anyway."

Borderlands,3dwkz0,CriticalFaceTime,9,Mon Jul 20 12:05:04 2015 UTC,"You haven't been looking hard enough. Janey has one of the biggest hatedoms I've seen for any character, right there alongside pickle."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,ScootaLewis,4,Mon Jul 20 13:31:08 2015 UTC,Yeah well....I haven't been really looking for something like hatedoms. But I know how people liked the scene in Tales from the Borderlands with Janey and Athena and I thought this was like the overall mentality.
Borderlands,3dwkz0,CriticalFaceTime,35,Mon Jul 20 13:45:15 2015 UTC,I didn't like Pickle much at all. I just couldn't enjoy his character. Janey Springs was great though! But I felt like her hitting on athena was just trying to push some gay-rights agenda. This is probably my unpopular oppinion for this thread.
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Predawncarpet,21,Mon Jul 20 10:43:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to have a problem with Janey hitting on other characters, but I don't see the problem. She fulfils Scooter's role in the game: supplies the vehicles, supplies some early side quests, and uses you to hit on chicks. To me, the difference is not that Janey's gay, it's that she gets mostly positive responses from her targets.    My own unpopular opinion would probably be that the first game had compelling characters and story. I mean, I played it heaps, but it was because it was unique gameplay. When I first played B2, I had over 100 hours in B1, but I had no idea who Lilith and Roland were. I only made the connection to B1 when I saw Bloodwing and Mordecai."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,estabon37,7,Mon Jul 20 12:59:37 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm completely for gay rights, but I really felt like TPS was shoving that down our throats.  I didn't realize until my GF and I were playing BL2 over the weekend there are just as many, if not more, gay and bi-sexual characters in BL2 but the difference is that while the gay and bi characters in BL2 act like normal gay and bi people do its almost as if Pre-sequel had never actually met a gay person. For example, in BL2 Sir Hammerlock is a gentleman hunter who off handily mentions his boyfriend a handful of times.  In pre-sequel Janny Sprigs is a salvager who MUST EMPHASIZE THAT SHE LIKES PUSSY EVERY 5 GOD DAMNED SECONDS!  I don't walk around saying ""I like tits! I like pussy!"" every five seconds just the same way that I just found out that the guy in the cubicle across from me is gay because it never came up because he doesn't go around yelling how much he likes dick.  TL;DR BL2 had more gay characters than pre-squel and no one fucking noticed because they acted like real gay people act, not fucking characterizes of gay people."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,htallen,6,Mon Jul 20 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad someone else gets it. Like, I feel like it was getting shoved down my throat with her character"
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Predawncarpet,6,Mon Jul 20 18:31:59 2015 UTC,I love both of em :c I also like TPS more than the other two. OK first one is pretty close.
Borderlands,3dwkz0,OrewaCookie,28,Mon Jul 20 08:08:17 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people keep forgetting Jack was doing bad shit loooong before Lilith punched the Vault database into his dome.
Borderlands,3dwkz0,CGAdam,5,Mon Jul 20 08:20:12 2015 UTC,"Bad shit? He's not altogether that different than the heroes of the main 2 games. He's more demonstrably manipulative, and people don't tend to like people that, but other than that, the only thing in my eyes that qualify him as a ""bad guy"" as compared to the actual cannibals and psychos of the first games was imprisoning his own daughter.  Part of me wonders, too, if she even agreed with it at first. Like, ""Sure thing dad I'll help you rid this world of filth and insane bandits and get the family rich."" And then maybe she saw what a dickhead he was when he was in power and how he had gone insane after the Falcon Punch to the face and decided enough was enough. After all, when you go into not crazy Jack's office, he has a photo of her on his desk. Go back post-Falcon Punch, and he's turned it over, perhaps showing he knows he's going to have to abuse her.  Pure speculation though."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,LumberjackPirate,5,Mon Jul 20 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"The venting of the very scientists who helped him take back over Helios out an airlock sets him apart from the bandits.  The bandits just enjoy carnage for its own sake.  You know exactly where you stand with them - if you aren't on their team, they'll kill you, but if you are on their team, they'll pretty much leave you alone so long as you do what they say.  Jack's betrayal of the scientists on Helios demonstrates that he is so unstable that not even his allies are safe from him.  If he can even imagine a seemingly-legitimate reason to kill you, he will.  That's not the sort of person you want to allow to control a giant, planet-cracking laser or tap the ancient secrets of a powerful alien race."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,cannons_for_days,4,Tue Jul 21 01:11:47 2015 UTC,"Angel didn't agree with him. She was thrown into that cell when she was a little girl, probably slightly older than that picture on his desk. The first ""Get to know Jack"" ECHO is a scared little girl, begging not to be strapped into some kind of chair. By the time the first game started, god only knows how long she'd been in there. Long enough to have her will broken by Jack, at least.  Also, that picture gets flipped down earlier than when Jack gets punched in the face. I think it's right after Zarpedon dies, but I'm not 100% sure."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,CGAdam,44,Mon Jul 20 22:24:41 2015 UTC,"This is a bit meta, but I don't think Gearbox should have allowed Burch to say anything about the games' story or characters outside of a formal setting. His ask.fm has spawned nothing but mess."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,CGAdam,17,Mon Jul 20 03:51:41 2015 UTC,"So as someone who hasn't heard of this, what sort of things has Burch said about BL that wans't Gearbox sanctioned? I saw the other dudes Maya as Asexual, but I'm guessing there is more?"
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Mechanatrix,10,Mon Jul 20 05:11:35 2015 UTC,"I looked at it once or twice, but a lot of it was just weird, like confusing-weird, the one I remember is ""sometimes Krieg grows a seventh pec"""

HOWEVER   You can't tell me Maya and Krieg didn't get a little snuggle now and then.  Like, during one of the times he wasn't busy conducting the poop train or riding a meat bicycle.   And Axton and Gaige are like...family. Big brother/little sister tag-team. Although they did kinda show how well they got along in the Holodome DLC. But I mean like, they're the two people you would call in when there's an entire city of bad guys to wipe out.  Just explosions and bouncing mega-bullets and explosions and electricity and robots and explosions and turrets and MOTHERF*CKIN EXPLOSIONS   ҉   ҉"
Borderlands,3dwkz0,AJockeysBallsack,22,Mon Jul 20 14:11:03 2015 UTC,"I don't see anything wrong with that. Plenty of people are asexual, and she of all people has plenty of reasons to not really give a shit about sex."

Borderlands,3dwkz0,complex_reduction,15,Tue Jul 21 04:57:01 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with the headcanon itself; the problem is that a lot of fans have accepted it as fact, which has created a lot of problems."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,brandpanz,19,Mon Jul 20 04:21:51 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it isn't essentially fact, he created the character, wrote her dialogue and backstory, the only argument for it not being so is that it wasn't directly mentioned in game.  It's a weak counter, especially because it fits her backstory."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Real-Terminal,29,Mon Jul 20 04:46:45 2015 UTC,"If J.K. Rowling says something about one of her characters, its essentially fact. She has sole creative power and can produce another book at any time.  Burch does not have sole creative power, never had the ability to make more story without a dozen people saying it was OK, and can't currently produce any Borderland content since he isn't employed there. Everything he said outside of official releases is just fan fiction or a glimpse into the creative process.   In BL3, if they decide to make Maya the sexiest sex beast to ever sex sex, then that is canon and everything he said means nothing and nobody can dispute it."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Thesaurii,28,Mon Jul 20 06:57:24 2015 UTC,"While it's more a result of him leaving GBX more than anything else, Burch did basically say two days ago that his BL headcanons shouldn't automatically be accepted as fact.  I do agree that Maya being asexual makes sense though."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,brandpanz,22,Mon Jul 20 04:55:36 2015 UTC,"Watching Tales from the Borderlands, I realize that I like the Borderlands-Universe maybe even a little more in the story-telling way than in the shoot-loot-shoot-way.  Also OP: Giving a lunatic near-limitless power and hoping he doesn't burn you alive is a good way to get burned alive. Lilith may have reveled a bit in the fact that she punched a Vault symbol into Jack's face, but he had to be stopped, period."

Don't like the dialogue, Dr. Spara's voice makes me want to throw my Xbox through a wall, and everything is so spread out and it takes so much time to complete having to run back and forth to Dr. Spara after getting each creature part.

Borderlands,3dwkz0,blackmarketdolphins,25,Mon Jul 20 06:32:10 2015 UTC,"Not really. Most people I've encountered accept what they got with BL2, but across the board everyone knows the BL1 guns were better. Hell even GBX acknowledges that, and made the weapons scale so differently in BL2 because no one was swapping out gear. All you really need is to get lucky and get a really good Double Anarchy, Havoc, etc and its smooth sailing for the next forever."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Oneusee,6,Mon Jul 20 06:40:22 2015 UTC,"Hell, even without that you could get by for a long time on a good repeating pistol. I'd have to check, but I kept the first gun I bought - it was a machine pistol and lasted me halfway through BL 1. 90% sure it was S&S, which is why I'm one of those minority who liked them.  They weren't great, but what they did, they did well. Also atlas. They were nice on occasion."

I love how stupidly overpowered they were and how excited I got when I checked the weapon vending machines for the chance at a purple masher that would carry me for around 10 levels. Revolvers were amazing and really helped solidify the sci-fi western feel of Borderlands.   Jakobs pistols feel more western, but they just aren't the same imo."

Borderlands,3dwkz0,Iamnothereorthere,16,Mon Jul 20 05:48:58 2015 UTC,"Agree so hard on that last part. The majority of why I have more hours in 2 than in 1 is because so many of the mechanics were improved ( Can move in FFYL, better organization of items, NO FALL DAMAGE) rather than any improvements in the story.

Borderlands,3dwkz0,VaelinX,3,Mon Jul 20 06:31:37 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the Underdome in coop.  The problem is that aside from the enjoyment, there's no compelling in-game reason to do it.  You don't get exp (not a real big deal IMO), you don't get gun exp (big deal for me) and you don't get good rewards (huge deal in a loot driven game).  If they had tweaked it so you could level your gun skills and get progressively better gear, I think it would have been better received.  The ability to save progress and take a leave between rounds would have sealed it as a good DLC."

While this is my go-to game and the most marvelous playground for multiplayer coöp I've ever seen, there are far more unnecessary confusions as to how the Borderlands world works. Just what is digistruction? Can it make anything? ""Galaxies""? Alien presences detected in the first game, no overwhelming response from corporate or other factions to investigate (such as the Eridian Promontory); Hyperion only unofficially takes apart the Destroyer due to Jack's ambitions. Why are there cars if FastTravel definitely exists? What could conceivably stop a Dahl army if each soldier was as well-turreted as Axton and they arrive in Halo-like UNSC corvettes bristling with troops, ""jetfighters"", and capship laser batteries? (And that was just a rogue force, not the main force of Dahl!)  So many great ideas are invested into the gameplay and casually used or referenced, and it would only take a few lines of overheard NPC dialogue to establish canon (""Man, I wish the digistructors could make food"", ""I heard the Dahl fleet is lurking in the Oort, hoping someone else jumps in and breaks the non-aggression treaties"") and keep it all together, a crucial aspect of building a game-spanning franchise. It's a little thing that hardly affects gameplay, but I'd enjoy seeing some stronger direction come from Gearbox itself than ""non-canon museum"" callouts and wild discussions on Tumblr."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,glovmpop,4,Mon Jul 20 13:05:53 2015 UTC,"Advanced 3D-printing? :P Cars are good for getting around short distances, and fast travel stations are probably quite expensive to build and not worth having that close to each other?  As for the rogue force, that just seems to show how incredibly well-off the huge corporations are. Dahl has this incredible force, but still won't bother doing anything against Hyperion on Pandora. Because both would lose incredibly much on such an attack. Maybe?"

Borderlands,3dwkz0,kolboldbard,9,Mon Jul 20 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"Borderlands one had terrible loot drop rates, and people have massive nostalgia fog of their  memories."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,SnapCrack1ePop,4,Mon Jul 20 15:01:29 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that the drop rates were bad, they were much better than BL2, its that the same legendaries always dropped. I can't even begin to tell you how many Equalizers I have seen during my 6 playthroughs of that game."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,SoulUnison,35,Mon Jul 20 21:45:56 2015 UTC,"I love Borderlands 1 and 2, I've got about a combined 325 hours in them, but they have a hilarious lack of polish and completely fall apart after the first playthrough.  Especially in the DLC, there's a noticeable amount of ground geometry errors, clipping issues, invisible walls in the middle of nowhere, seam errors that let you peer into ""the void,"" skybox problems...  And then there's how they lock content behind the THIRD playthrough but don't know how to do any real balancing besides ""make the numbers bigger!"" Their idea of a ""riveting boss battle"" or even just ""enemies in general"" is to give an enemy an obscene amount of HP, disjointed hitboxes so large that any melee attack is basically guaranteed to land, and accuracy and damage scaled so ridiculously high that you can be one-shot sniped by an enemy with a SHOTGUN.  Do you want to fight enemies that down you in one or two hits through a full shield, use lunging melee attacks that don't match up to their animations and seemingly can't miss, and move faster than the player can move while sprinting, making trying to get any distance useless? Well, have I got a game for you!  And, again, the justification that ""it's the third playthrough, it's supposed to be hard"" doesn't work, because there's a decent amount of content/loot gated to that third playthrough with no other way to experience/acquire it. A friend and I have been struggling through BL2's third playthrough for months now, and struggle is the right word because it's often just complete bullshit.  It doesn't even do the ""crazy randomly generated guns"" thing that the series is supposed to be built around. Instead of tons of guns with wildly differing properties you mostly just have guns with different accuracy and capacity modifiers and bullet spreads. For ""E-Tech"" which are supposed to be the ""weird, exotic"" guns, you pretty much just have dart guns, laser blasters (which really only differ from ""normal"" guns visually and through sound effects,) and that's...just about it. Even the whole ""manufacturer quirk"" system basically makes tons of guns functionally useless because of a complete lack of synergy between the gun and its ""special trait.""  It says something when the ""freshest"" game in the series and the one that actually delivers on a lot of the previous promise is one that's been handed off to a side team. (Pre-Sequel.)    EDIT: Enters ""unpopular opinion thread,"" gives detailed, reasoned but unpopular opinion - gets downvoted. \(o_o)/"
Borderlands,3dwkz0,brandpanz,14,Mon Jul 20 06:03:52 2015 UTC,"It's not really an unpopular opinion tbh; in fact, UVHM's false difficulty was/is a very common complaint that drove a lot of people away from the game. Said complaint was actually the chief factor in how TPS's UVHM was designed. It's largely agreed that TPS doesn't have the same difficulty scaling problems that BL2 did, but on the flipside people who didn't have problems with BL2's UVHM now complain that it's too easy."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Moonswirl,27,Mon Jul 20 06:29:57 2015 UTC,"UVHM was a terrible idea.  If I'm allowed another, Anthony Burch is a terrible writer."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Zombie_DooDoo,12,Mon Jul 20 06:37:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first part (I hate UVHM because of the need for slag) but I think Burch did a really impressive job considering his only previous writing experience (as far as I know) was just a series of two minute videos he wrote with his sister. I felt it was a good story filled with characters that actually had depth and a few emotional moments on top of all that. Now, if you dont find his style of humor funny, I can respect that. Not everybody likes the same jokes."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,hobowithabazooka,3,Mon Jul 20 12:05:40 2015 UTC,Uvhm is where the game got interesting for me. Normal and tvhm were way too easy for anyone with a scrap of fps experience.

She's grown on me a little, I don't bare her, and I don't have any rational complaint, she just annoys me.  And her voice annoys me more than Davis Pickle's does THERE I SAID IT"
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Quinez,9,Mon Jul 20 08:25:08 2015 UTC,"The character writing is not very good.  Nearly all of the characters have the same voice, which is the voice of the writers.  There's a moment early on in BL2 where someone mentions tearing someone apart, and Angel comes on mike to say, ""Dude. Ew.""  It struck me as a little out of character at first, but that's not quite true because every single character is written so that they might say something like ""Dude.  Ew."" It's the kind of response that the writers might have, so they immediately make Angel say it.  Characters aren't given a chance to have distinct personalities.  There's also a moment when Moxxi says that she ""just threw up in her mouth a little"" when making innuendo about going down on Motor Momma.  That's not something Moxxi would say... she did go down on Motor Momma!  That's something the writers thought.  So they just made Moxxi their mouthpiece.  Bad writing."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,cannons_for_days,5,Mon Jul 20 13:27:59 2015 UTC,"I think the reason Moxxi says that line was going too far is that it sort of sounded like she was saying she wanted to cannibalize those women.  (Like, literally eat them, not ""eat"" them, hint, hint, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.)"

Borderlands,3dwkz0,brandpanz,9,Mon Jul 20 05:21:44 2015 UTC,"It's mostly the badass round and the new loot that I enjoy about the Holodome. The constant searching for enemies does kill the pacing quite a bit but I can get over it.  It's still the worst arena in the series, but I don't think it's the shithole that everyone makes it out to be."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Jatsala,4,Mon Jul 20 05:30:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have minded it, but the fact that they charged so much for such a lackluster arena is really disappointing. That DLC is not worth $10. That alone made me regret buying the season pass."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,brandpanz,4,Mon Jul 20 05:42:16 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way:  The Shock Drop Slaughter Pit costs $4.99.  BL2's Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Packs both cost $4.99.  From a size perspective, Holodome is the same as the sum of SDSP and one UVH upgrade pack. So... $9.98, or $9.99 if we're following pricing conventions. In other words, same as its actual price. Quality-wise? Maybe not. Size-wise? I'd say so."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Jatsala,3,Mon Jul 20 05:48:10 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but my issue is that we know that Gearbox can do much better. The Holodome was just lazy on their part."

Borderlands,3dwkz0,Jatsala,43,Mon Jul 20 06:47:59 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced that Handsome Jack is the real hero of the Borderlands series. And not just because of the Game Theory video, but for one big reason: We never see the events first hand. Borderlands 2 (the game where Jack does the majority of his evil shit) is told by Marcus. You know, the guy who sells guns to bandits, shoots people for asking for refunds, and who lied to a guy and got him killed just so he could sell a gun (Evil Smasher quest). Not exactly and unbiased source.  TPS on the other hand is told by Athena, and while she is more neutral than Marcus, I'm not inclined to believe her either. She must have some kind of agenda, everyone else in the series does.  And lastly what are the vault hunters fighting to protect? Pandora is a hellhole. Just look at what the bandits do, look at how Lilith and Moxxi act, look at the horrific monsters trying to murder everything. This is not a world that any heroes would be fighting to preserve.  TLDR: Handsome Jack is the good guy because Marcus is a scumbag and I don't trust Athena. Also Moxxi and Lilith are evil."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,CGAdam,50,Mon Jul 20 03:52:01 2015 UTC,"The BL2 Hunters aren't trying to protect anything except their own hides. Jack tried to kill them for no real reason and kept trying to kill them- either quickly with Loaders, or in the long term if he'd been able to use the Warrior. They're just trying to stay alive.   The TPS Hunters are just working for Jack. They don't care about protecting people, either.  Jack just wants power. The only people he cares about are the ones that will bow to him. Everyone else can die as far as he's concerned.   No one is a hero."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Jatsala,12,Mon Jul 20 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"According to Marcus, Jack tried to have them killed. According to Athena they don't care about protecting people. We get one side of the story about Handsome Jack, and that side is deeply biased. I don't accept it. To use the cliche: ""History is written by the victor."""
Borderlands,3dwkz0,CGAdam,33,Mon Jul 20 04:21:55 2015 UTC,"I think you're putting a little too much stock in Marcus as the narrator, but let's run with that for now. If Marcus is the one telling the story blow-by-blow, that means he freely admits being the reprehensible man who shoots customers asking for refunds, cheats idiots, and sells to both sides. If he's willing to paint himself as that morally gray, why wouldn't he give an unbiased view of Jack? Why would he say ""this is all the bad stuff I do"" instead of just whitewash it and paint Jack as even darker than he is in game?   As for Athena, she's got no axe to grind. She didn't even care if she lived or died. If she had cared, she would have told Lilith the story she wanted to hear, that Jack forced her hand or something. There's no reason to assume Athena's version is biased, either.   If we were to get a version of BL2 from Jack's perspective (bleah), I'm sure we'd see hundreds of women fawning over Jack while he waged war against baby-eating monsters that ultimately blew a hole in his chest.   I'm willing to accept what we see in game as the closest version of the truth we'll ever get: Jack was a power hungry murderer that enslaved his own daughter, killed indiscriminately, would have razed whole planets to further his own goals, and laughed about it the whole time.  Wouldn't you try to fight that?"
Borderlands,3dwkz0,oniiesu,9,Mon Jul 20 05:32:28 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that there is no ""hero"" in the borderlands series. Everyone, including the vault hunters and everyone's favorite NPCs, is a mass-murderer who only does so for their own interests. In my mind, every named character stays on Pandora because it's an outlaw haven.   This point was driven home in BL2. Listen to your character's backlogs, every single playable character has a sketchy background (Maya and Gaige have the least psycho backgrounds. Maya was used as an idol of terror by an unknown religion, and when she found out, she killed those exploiting her to free the followers from their oppression. Gaige created a combat robot and forgot to disable it's retaliation protocols before debuting it in a room of her known bullies. She might be able to get away with manslaughter instead of all out murder). The final nail in the coffin to me is the song Gearbox chose to open BL2 with: The Heavy - Short Change Hero ""This ain't no place for no hero""."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Jatsala,4,Mon Jul 20 12:57:22 2015 UTC,"You know, that is a good point. I could accept that everyone is more or less evil. I can't accept that Handsome Jack is the villain and Lilith and Moxxi are the white knights come to save the day. They're just as bad."

Borderlands,3dwkz0,cannons_for_days,3,Mon Jul 20 14:07:52 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree with you; I wish the Claptastic Voyage DLC had gone for OP levels instead of increasing the level cap to 70.  60 is a bit of hike from 50 in TPS, and the extra 10 skill points means any given build at the level cap doesn't have to give up much, so there aren't many interesting choices left to make for the player."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,likwidstylez,4,Mon Jul 20 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"Yea, OP levels would have been nice. Actually, I think they got the DLC's backwards. Move all Holodome weapon/gear to TPS standard; release CV with the 10 skill points to get to 60; release the Holodome without the Skill points (so we still max at 60) and make it into the new Peak. (Also fix the fucking radar so we can see where the enemies are in that godawefully huge arena)."

Borderlands,3dwkz0,dirtspp,17,Mon Jul 20 06:09:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think Angel was ever meant to look ""punk"" or ""goth"" in her in-game form. The Skrillet she rocked alluded to it, but then I noticed she had two gigantic sockets implanted into her cranium (likely for the Eridium) and the hair was simply cut around it.   For her ECHO overlay appearance, I think that since she's a Siren and is somehow able to interface with machines through Hyperion's technology, she can project a different image of herself to the player, a more cleaned-up version, hence the live-action model."

It took my friend and I about 12 hours of non stop game play to beat The Angelic Ruins (most of the time was spent in that god forsaken place) and The Gully, and another 4 for Hell-Burbia. Once we were done we took a month long break from gaming all together."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,TheMistySimba,5,Mon Jul 20 09:38:41 2015 UTC,"I think Tiny Tina is the absolute worst thing to ever happen to Borderlands (the Dragon Keep DLC is awesome, just not the parts where Tina is talking). I usually just turn my dialog volume off when I have to interact with her. I think everything about her character is childish and insanely annoying, and it drives me crazy to know that Gearbox is going to take every opportunity to shove her down my throat in every Borderlands game for the rest of time.  Borderlands is my favorite game franchise of all time, and Tina is the only thing that has ever made me ashamed to say I'm a fan."

Borderlands,3dwkz0,Predawncarpet,7,Mon Jul 20 06:12:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't like Tiny Tina at all. As a character. I almost dislike her as much if not more than pickle for similar reasons. I understand her character, but it's so forced. She's a child. I get it. But she doesn't have to be so obnoxious, especially with the over-use of made up words. Pickle was just run-of-the-mill annoying. But Tina is forcibly annoying.  I will, however, say that her DLC is my favorite DLC of any game (especially as a DND player). And the acting at the very end of the DLC where she accepts reality honestly made me cry."

I actually really don't want Lilith to be the villain for the next game or killed at all, actually. I don't like killing off former protagonists, at least the ones I can play. If Lilith was a character with the development of a Cod side character, then I wouldn't give a shit, but this was the first siren we all grew to know, and regardless of the way she acts now, I don't want to kill her. It's not like her or any of the vault hunters have ever been the good guys. There are no good guys or heroes on Pandora."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,piccologi97,3,Mon Jul 20 16:21:34 2015 UTC,I genuinely enjoying farming (not loot midgets though) and in games like the borderlands series storytelling should generally take the back seat to gameplay.
Borderlands,3dwkz0,RoastedCardinal,3,Mon Jul 20 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"From a gameplay standpoint, the Secret Armory DLC aggravates me on just about every level. Which is a shame because I really enjoy Knoxx, Athena, the overly polite Crimson Lance probes, etc., but the vehicle portions, drifters, and the missions in general just really wore me out. And the pearlescents? I'll give them credit for the Nemesis, Stalker, Serpens, and Bessie. The rest were just disappointing or awful. I will say this, however: Truxican Wrestler is one of the best things about BL1 and I love it with all my heart.   I thought Zombie Island was significantly better."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,memlo,18,Tue Jul 21 03:24:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting opinion. I used gibbed for finding fun weapons and matching to the plethora of people I was playing with lvl wise - oh, you have a lvl 20 psycho, let me make a lvl 20 siren and give you a class mod to help us. Really makes the game fun to play together and you get a class mod that goes with your character that helps the team.   Bought and beat bl1, 2, and all dlc on Xbox, then pc and have now beat tps and each episode of tales from the borderlands so far. I'd say I love the game...

Borderlands,3dwkz0,Eculc,8,Mon Jul 20 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"I think there's more than one way to enjoy the game. When I'm playing through the story, either with friends or solo, I never use gibbed or the like. I play the game as it was intended to be played.  When I'm doing endgame build experimentation or seeing how quickly I can kill some boss using <x loadout>, I'm not going be bothered spending the hours it would take to grind for all that specific gear.  For me, It's more about the gunplay than the loot system. The way borderlands does guns is really cool and fun, but I don't enjoy farming and I don't bother with it when gibbed is an alternative."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Jatsala,8,Mon Jul 20 05:07:39 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone with more than 500 hours in BL2: I'm not farming for new guns anymore. I've done my share of that, and I do love the game (thank you very much). Just because I use Gibbed doesn't make me any less of a Borderlands fan, it just means that I'm not willing to farm BNK3R for another 3 days to get an imperfect Bitch."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Advanced-,7,Mon Jul 20 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"Disagree, forcing players to play the story twice over for each new character before allowing them the highest difficulty requires too much time for people that have a limit on how much they can game.  I got my 1st two characters to UVHM legit, then used gibbed for 3 more classes to instantly level them to 50 and unlock it.  Now I got all their weapons, class mods, shields, etc all legit by farming on my mains prior. I just got them to unlock UVHM from the start.  I like the game. I used gibbed and wouldn't have played as much of it (or even still be playing it) without gibbed."

Borderlands,3dwkz0,Awesome4some,10,Mon Jul 20 05:28:25 2015 UTC,"I personally disagree with you, as I believe BL2 to be just a straight upgrade to BL1, but I honestly want to know why you think the way you do.   Lets have a real discussion."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,Androidconundrum,6,Mon Jul 20 04:10:37 2015 UTC,"Not the original commenter, but I can help shed light on why i think BL1 has been the best installment of the series.   Pandora felt more ""real"" in BL1.  The environment was consistent with a used up mining hub left to rot.  Everything was brown, dusty, dirty, and cobbled together.  It's perfectly captured what a ""space western"" should feel like. It went back to a quintessential RPG format.  While there was story in the game, it seemed like they knew that the story wasn't the greatest, and so it wasn't in your face all the time.  You could go around and do what you wanted while being guided through the map.  BL2 on the other hand felt like they wanted their story taken seriously and rammed it down your throat fairly regularly.  At the same time, the story, environment, and character's didn't mesh as well for me in BL2 because they each got pushed to an extreme, leaving less to the player's imagination. Leveling and Loot.  The exponential growth of BL2 makes leveling and finding new guns a MUST and the difficulty curve more unfun for me.  It was clear they were prioritizing endgame difficulty scaling over story progression.  In BL1, if you fell in love with a good gun, you could hold on to it for 20+ levels and if you wanted the new hotness whenever you found it, you could pick it up too.   TL;DR All in all it felt like I spent hundreds of hours on Pandora in BL1 interacting with the world and its bandits, and then BL2 came around and said it was Pandora, but I never felt like I went back.  Also BL1 gave you more options as to how you wanted to play an RPG."
Borderlands,3dwkz0,blackflag29,5,Mon Jul 20 05:14:49 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with the story being rammed down your throat in BL2 was that once I had played through the game a few times, I just did not give a shit about the story anymore, but it was still so present. Every playthrough I absolutely dreaded making it to Sanctuary for the first time because that meant sitting through tons of unskippable cutscenes."

Borderlands,3dwdcg,DCNx,15,Mon Jul 20 06:05:29 2015 UTC,"It's kinda like e-tech weapons ie: purple rarity guns with a chance to trigger one of 4 special effects instead of the e-tech barrel. They are pink instead of magenta.  Blue: amp shot that drains shields, Green: additional bullets on a shotgun like spread and RoF, Yellow: loop which increases RoF and reload speed dramatically and gives ammo back when you get a kill, and finally Red: which adds an additional bullet, slows down RoF, but hits and recoils so hard it'll actually throw your character back a bit.  Yellow and red are imo the best but if you want more details, I suggest watching Bahroo's  video on it."
Borderlands,3dwdcg,blackmarketdolphins,4,Mon Jul 20 06:16:44 2015 UTC,"It's a modifier that can happen in one of the DLC where a gun is glitches causing special effects to occur on reload. Most of the time it will behave normally but ocasionally you'll get an effect such as rapid burst fire that fires more bullets than it uses up, or a slowed fire rate with a vastly higher damage. There's a third one but I can't remember what it does. All glitch guns are capable of getting any of the three effects on reload."

Borderlands,3dypni,SputterNutter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:21:45 2015 UTC,I have had situation like you with my melee Zero. My solution is change to hybrid melee   kunai  When I on TVHM around level 40. It struggle when I cannot one hit kill any enemy. So my Many Must Fall gone useless. I decide to have respec into Kunai route along with bloodlust dash attack. This going very well. Everything I need is just throwing kunai then dash in like I were. Kunai can be huge nuke to single enemy so I can do the one hit kill at the end. Even when got against anti melee enemy like hot loader. I can switch to kunai   gun instead so it not become much problem.  Only problem is blizzard. My solution is always prepare hi fire rate concussive sniper in my pocket. It can burst down blizzard quite quickly  With this method. I already clear solo UVHM without much problem  Cheers
Borderlands,3dypni,SputterNutter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:35 2015 UTC,"He's one of those characters where your build in-game is just as important as your real-life skill.  Suggestion: slot 1 gun: Rapier (obviously, and preferably slag).  Slot 2: Evisc. Rubi. Slot 3: Corrosive, high fire rate.  Slot 4: Give up and gib a Norfleet.  Or if you're a purist, stick a Badaboom or something in there.  This loadout got me from level 55 or so to level 72, swapping out shields and grenades etc. all the while.  I needed to get a new S3 gun every couple levels, but that was literally a buzzard/exploder/HOTloader gun, and I took everything out fine.    I don't know what problem you're having with that thresher.  I never found him hard.  I usually hit that fight about a level or two underleveled, and if you just ignore all the loaders and head straight for a backstab crit, you can do pretty well for yourself, especially if you grab some throwaway green shock weapon beforehand.  Also, you should eventually be able to one-shot pretty much every mob in the game (At level 72, one-shotting Juggernauts is still a thing with the right roid shield).    Never forget:  Read my flair.  And jump.  Zer0 doesn't like bullets, but bullets love Zer0.    On your last sentence: no.  It'll only be harder.  Mid-level sniping is actually harder than mid-level melee because you have only one healing source (besides Rubi), and it's kinda shit anyway."
Borderlands,3dw4mk,BluAlchemist,17,Mon Jul 20 00:54:55 2015 UTC,Would you really want an achievement though?

Halo: CEA for 360 and Halo: CEA in the MCC are the same game but with different achievements.

I don't remember the builds exactly but it's something like this: http://bl2skills.com/assassin.html#505351500050505105515050510000  The idea is to use Execute to get right up close to a group of enemies and blast away at them. Two Fang can be coupled with that one Seraph relic to get 100% double shot chance with a +6 class mod, it's a fun skill to use.  You don't have to use exclusively Shotguns, of course. Any close-range weapon works fine. Try out guns like the Tattler or Bone Shredder. They do tons of damage but are usually impractical due to how close range you must be for them to work.   Surviving is really fucking hard though. I would consider using the weapon merge glitch to give whatever gun you're using some lifesteal. Otherwise you could just throw a bunch of transfusions and hope for the best, I suppose."

You can really do a lot of melee damage as well with Zero even on a gun focused build.    Legendary hunter works really well with this build, because it boosts all tier 1 skills except precision, and has CDR boost.  Killing blow at +10 means 1000% melee damage for finishing off those enemies that have low health after shotgunning.  You can also get some health from resurgence, but it's not that great.  as someone else mentioned the Slow Hand has a healing effect and works ok with this build."

MoLMF (somewhat) recently made a very interesting Kitten build for Zer0, although many people have heard of it now. The point is, even though this game is over three years old there is still much more to discover.  I realize this doesn't answer your question so I'll give you a suggestion. Find anything that deals shock splash damage, preferably an E-tech shotgun, and pair it with the Transformer. The self-shock-damage will actually charge your shield. But beware, it will actually deplete and damage your health, and then recharge your shield so you might want a health source to go along with it."

Borderlands,3dyb5o,thekidfromnebraska,4,Mon Jul 20 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"Don't expect a game like BL1. It runs on the same ideas and principles, but the gameplay is different in ways that may be offputting to begin with - when i started playing BL2 i almost thought i couldn't go on, until i got further into it. Now I have 600 hours in it.  But here's a tip: Almost every enemy with a unique name has a chance to drop a specific item that is part of their loot pool - like how Ajax dropped Ajax's Spear or how Slither could drop the Dove.  Don't be afraid to check the wiki for guidance, but don't take its info as gospel truth.  Manufacturers all have gimmicks with their weapons in the HC, too.   Jakobs has a ""fan the hammer"" type firing style - as fast as you can click, pretty much, except their snipers which depend on their rarity.   Torgue ONLY makes explosive weaponry. Their pistols? Those bullets explode. Shotguns? The pellets explode. Rockets? You'd best BELIEVE those explode.  Maliwan are as they were in BL1: Elemental only. But they're not even CLOSE to as good as they were back then - their mags are small and their damage is lacking. HOWEVER: they make some of the best unique items in the game. Anything you get from Moxxi, for instance, will heal you when you deal damage while holding it, and the Maliwan pistol Rubi heals you more than almost anything else.  Dahl are burst fire while zoomed in. They're generally lacking, but they have one or two niche uniques of some use - look for the Lascaux in a watery cave.  Hyperion continue their trend from BL1 of being the most accurate, but in a new way: they feature reverse recoil. Their accuracy INCREASES as you fire them. Hold down the trigger on a Hyperion shotgun and the cone will get tighter and tighter.  Tediore's quick-reload perk makes a comeback in a big way - they've gone so far as to make guns so cheap that they can't actually be reloaded. Instead, they get thrown at the enemy and explode, dealing extra damage for each bullet left in the clip. A new one is digistructed directly into your hands!  Vladof's fire rate supremacy makes a return - a fine Vladof pistol is more like a heavy SMG. Their recoil is a little higher than other manufacturers, though. Look for vladof pistols named ""Anarchist"" - those are the best for fire rate and damage.  Bandits now make guns, by the way. They're cobbled together and generally not very good, but the magazine size on them is insane - their SMGs can hold in excess of a hundred bullets.  Also, gun parts are now split by manufacturer - for every manufacturer that makes a type of gun, there's a different type of each part for that gun. For instance, everyone makes pistols, so you can have pistols with maliwan barrels, dahl barrels, hyperion barrels, so on so forth.  http://imgur.com/gallery/8xsH0 THIS IS YOUR BEST FRIEND!"

Also, start with Borderlands 2 first, NOT the Presequel, it will spoil some things that happen in 2 because it technically happens after Bl 2"
Borderlands,3dxsou,TheRealNequam,3,Mon Jul 20 13:00:13 2015 UTC,"Just that there won't be any misunderstandings, The Pre Sequel happens BEFORE Borderlands 2, it's just that everything that happens in the Pre Sequel is told by Athena as a story, which she tells after all that what happened in BL2."
Borderlands,3dxsou,CriticalFaceTime,2,Mon Jul 20 13:52:00 2015 UTC,"Your progress will be saved, however, you have to do everything together. Think of each step of a mission as a flag that needs to be tripped. You need to trip every flag in order to progress. So if you jump into your friends game somewhere in the middle of a mission, or leave before it is turned in, and then join again another day, you will be missing flags. If you then try to play on your own, you will be forced to play at the point of your first missing mission flag. That can be as early as claptraps house in the very beginning (people tend to join a game after this point so many will not have that flag set)  The good news is, once you trip whatever flag you are missing, the game will ask if you want to skip ahead. This will take you to your next missing flag, hopefully up to the farthest point you have played, but maybe at some middle mission you missed.    Another note, you can only get mission rewards an XP once. So, if you do a mission alone and then later with a friend, you won't get double the XP and money and loot. His works the other way too. If you do it in a friends game and then are forced to play an earlier mission you need to finish, you should skip ahead when asked as you will not gain any mission rewards and mission XP for the missions you have already completed."

Borderlands,3dwdet,GeniusBandit,8,Mon Jul 20 02:13:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you said, the enemies are hilariously dumb in comparison to  other games, and bandits in particular are so easy to headshot, as they just stand completely still a lot of the time. And the game is much easier, but after getting back from OP8 in BL2, it's kind of a nice change.  But the game still has a lot of merits that I like. It feels lonelier, and more like a desolate planet than in BL2. The humor is more subtle, but still great. Of course I think BL2 is a better game overall, and has much more content, but the first is still very fun and unique in its own way."
Borderlands,3dwdet,severage,3,Mon Jul 20 02:55:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't personally tried UVHM, or hell, even TVHM, just normal. But I've heard that UVHM will kick your ass, hard.   It's just that all of the tiny things I grew to love in BL 2 and took for granted seemed to be worse or completely absent in 1, even the bandit voice's. They just seem to be really generic and low-key, compared to the Marauders in 2.   ""I'LL LET MY SHOTGUN DO THE TALKING!""  ""WHAT-SA MATTER? GONNA CRY? BABY!""  ""WELCOME TO DIE!""  ""GIMME YER DAMN LOOT!""  There was almost none of that in BL 1.  Plus, I actually like how populated the new game is. It really Illustrates how chaotic(ly fun) and fucked up the World of Pandora is.   But the Assault Rifles do kick ass, I will give them that. Seriously, why do the rifles suck so much in BL 2?"
Borderlands,3dwdet,brandpanz,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:15 2015 UTC,"The BL1 bandits try to act tough and menacing but end up coming off as corny and unintentionally hilarious. (seriously, who thought that the line ""You never shoulda come here, now you're gonna pay!"" was intimidating?) BL2's bandits are the same way, but with them GBX decided to cut the middle man and make them over the top ridiculous, which made them a lot more entertaining.  I've always thought that ARs in BL2/TPS have always been very underrated. They don't seem like much on paper, but with characters' skills they can really wreck. Every character has at least one brand of AR that they will do really well with: Jakobs for Maya and Zer0, Torgue for Axton and Krieg, and Vladof for Gaige and Salvador. They're a lot better than people think, honestly."
Borderlands,3dwdet,brandpanz,2,Mon Jul 20 04:27:15 2015 UTC,"Your certainly entitled to your opinion, but they just don't fill any space for me.

In BL 2, couldn't get rid of the things fast enough."
Borderlands,3dwdet,brandpanz,2,Mon Jul 20 05:20:18 2015 UTC,"And besides, If I don't feel the need to separate any of my other weapons by manufacturer, why should I for rifles?   It's the case for every weapon type, not just ARs. In the case of shotguns, for example, Salvador does better with Hyperion, whereas Axton prefers Torgue. For snipers, Maya works best with Maliwan as opposed to Zer0 who would probably want a Vladof instead.  This is more skill synergy with anything, but ARs really aren't as bad as they're often made out to be (they're far more interesting than the sickeningly vanilla SMGs, that's for sure)."
Borderlands,3dwdet,596Franky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:27:47 2015 UTC,"I just use what works, man. Also, here's one thing 1 has over 2 in my mind, anyway. In 1, it was a lot simpler to find a gun that you would use. Maybe this gun has some more damage and accurate, while the other has stupid fire rate. In 2, ya gotta factor in all the gimmicks of the various companies, the ammo capacity, the reload speed, and the speed of the projectiles themselves, if you have an explosive weapon.  What I'm trying to say is, the various perks and gimmicks of Manufacturers in 1 seemed to be a lot more passive then in 2."
Borderlands,3dwdet,Seytai,2,Mon Jul 20 05:45:58 2015 UTC,"They definitely were. The manufacture gimmicks in BL1 were mostly mere stat boosts such as +15% fire rate for Vladof or whatever. However, part combinations could easily offset these stat boosts, and thus blur the lines between the manufacturers and make them feel less distinct.  BL2's gimmicks were designed in order to get rid of this problem, and were thus really distinct, as if changing the manufacturer completely changed the gun. It was a divisive move, obviously: a turnoff for people who preferred more realism and simplicity, but a boon for those who enjoyed game theory as well as the more cartoony aspect of the series."

A lot of people think this is due to buggy multiplayer - I think a lot of people just didn't buy the game.   2) Remastered Borderlands will only come out if THC does excessively well on next-gen consoles.

Capstone for each modifies it, changing it into WAR loader, BUL loader and [something hot] loader.   And the obvious EXP loader ability, into of FFYL  HOT loader would be based around ranged melee. Short-medium range flamethrowers for constant small AOE, shoot fireballs for ranged(?)  GUN is obvious enough.  PWR would be melee based as well, with their spinny-bullet-blocking ability, their ability to hit stuff and goddamnit I'm making krieg into a loader aren't I?  Oh well.

""Mad Mel's Fury Ride"" The party returns to the Dahl Headlands from BL1 to retake New Haven. To do so they've heavily outfitted a bandit supply rig (nicknamed the Rigtrap [R1G-TRP]) to deliver the necessary goods being driven by Janey Springs and Nurse Nina. But Mad Mel, the boss of the Headlands from BL1, is revealed to be alive and has taken New Haven.   The gimmick of this DLC is the players are riding atop the Rigtrap, and must race back and forth, manning turrets, fighting boarders, patching damage and occasionally leaping from vehicle to vehicle until you face Mad Mel and his monster truck in a battle to the death (for real this time).   Everyone gets a great new head and skin, and we get a few extra goodies like ""Mad Mel's Sawn-Off"" a Jacobs double-barrel, and once the mission is done it opens up the Ludicrous Speedway for races and the town of New Haven populated with a few NPC's from the original game and a memorial to Helena Pierce and the victims of Old Haven, along with the corpse of Wilhelm stretched out over the town's sign."

Borderlands,3dv1tk,essarr71,4,Sun Jul 19 19:45:44 2015 UTC,Why not a new brand of guns that are upgrade able with money that level up independently of the user
Borderlands,3dv1tk,darek_pwns,2,Sun Jul 19 21:38:09 2015 UTC,Now that's a good idea. Give it overall average stats with one stat boosted well above the others. The boosted stat is your incentive to hang onto it and actually level it up.
Borderlands,3dv1tk,woodchips24,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:08 2015 UTC,And possibly allowing the other stats to be upgraded for a certain price
Borderlands,3dv1tk,darek_pwns,3,Sun Jul 19 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but it kinda defeats the purpose of looting everything if you have legendaries the whole game. I had an idea a while back about something similar, but instead of boosting the level of old guns I wanted to have a way to make your current guns better. There was many times i'd get an upgrade to a gun that I didn't want but had to take just because the stats were better. For example, i hate most revolver scopes since I use them close up. My idea was that you could scrap an old gun and add a piece like the muzzle or scope to the new gun to fix it to your needs. Most of the stats like manufacturer, damage, ammo usage, etc would stay at the body and you could grind up a bunch of whites for their parts to put on. You could add or remove a scope, replace the muzzle to change how the gun fires, give stabalizers to pistols for less recoil, and if it's the same manufacturer you can change stuff like elemenal damage and clip size. My idea is that this would give use to common loot and would give a way to fix up your equipment so that it'd be less annoying to use. Plus it makes it easier to get the exact build you want in uvhm because instead of farming the same gun 12 times you could just get 1 and then play slots for the right parts you need to fit the specific build."

Borderlands,3dr2lt,SirGallade,4,Sat Jul 18 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"Or separate the ""matches"" into ""sessions"" and keep track of the stats within individual sessions while keeping an overall stat track for stuff people would like to see stat wise. Maybe within the individual sessions keep track of bosses, mini bosses and raid bosses you've killed. You could then click on the specific boss and see what went down such as how many bullets were fired, accuracy based on how often you crit the boss and the individual elemental damage you've done along with the overall damage of course. This page would also keep track of those playing with you during this time and show their stats during the fight as well."

Vintage Weapons: New rarity, mostly Atlas stuff, but some other manufacturer's stuff too. Extremely rare and valuable, but also a bit more powerful than Legendarys and Pearls, like the difference between Legendarys and Purples in Borderlands 1. I think that would add a new and appealing rarity to the game and be fairly interesting.  Tell me what you think! :P"

Imagine that. a vladof bow that loads arrows down from the side for max fire rate. A maliwan bow with an arrow with a tesla on the end, or a heat conductor. A torgue bow with a grenade strapped to the end of it. A hyperion bow with some sort of ""autocorrecting"" or homing arrow.  Melee items, similar to class mods. A Metal-heated sword for Athena. Torgue EXPLOSIVE BRASS KNUCKLES for brick or salvador.  Similar to /u/JacePlaysGames 's idea, Vintage weapons. like the old hyperion red and black color scheme, or an atlas silver gun, like in TFTB, or a SGS munition weapon. Rarity color could be gray or red. Worth significatly more if sold.  Not a suggestion, but PLEASE GOD keep the eridium/moonstone system from TPS. Grinder aswell.  More customization. not just a color and head.  Weapon part swap. suppose you could find a gun that has a tinker-able/swappable part on it, sort of like legos.

I get that a moving turret is fitting for open terrain, but the stickable turrets could have been just as useful, like in BL2. I usually play alone, so my tactic is usually to post up during a fire fight. So stationary is preferable, especially with the health res and extra shielding.

Borderlands,3drv0x,96kidbuu,2,Sat Jul 18 21:20:25 2015 UTC,"If you want to play as a Boomtrap, you go down the Boomtrap tree, obviously. It works best with explosive guns that reload often and can empty their mag quickly: so in other words, Torgue shotguns and pistols. I'd start with Killbot first though, so that your survivability is covered. The other essential skill is Load n' Splode, and the rest are really up to you."
Borderlands,3drv0x,brandpanz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:53:26 2015 UTC,"This is what I would -personally- go for. Feel free to change it slightly based on your needs. Depending on exactly how much damage 'Start With A Bang' does and how much ammo your weapons have, you may prefer to go with 'One Last Thing'.   This is only up to level 25, for obvious reasons, but feel free to ask for other skill trees."
Borderlands,3drv0x,McRibbles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:52:12 2015 UTC,Make sure you put one point into the shield/health subroutine of the right tree because it really helps with survivability.  After that in the boom tree the best are Load and Splade and One Last Thing to really buff your explosive weapons damage.  You could mess around with most skills in the boom tree by only adding a point or two and they're still effective.  The fire rate buff skills are really helpful also as you'll be using slow ass explosive weapons.  After finishing the boom tree you could then use the middle to really boost your stats.  That's the way I played him.  You could go more into the right tree to do more damage but then it becomes more random.  But with the right gear you'll still do decent damage even if you don't switch weapons.
Borderlands,3drv0x,shamus4mwcrew,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:13:10 2015 UTC,I started with the left tree and took at least one point from almost everything. The only thing I found not as useful was the Hyperion punch. After that tree I started going down the middle tree. The idea to the right tree just didn't appeal to me as much. I can screenshot my build so far later but I don't have access to my computer right now.   Here it is. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484404138 Not done yet. Only at level 38 but I'm looking to max out most of the stuff in the Boomtrap tree after getting the last thing in the I Love You Guys! tree.

Borderlands,3dmjm7,pwines14,30,Fri Jul 17 14:56:51 2015 UTC,"There's a theory about the warrior I've had since I first played it. What if Jack actually wanted to kill the warrior? Make himself out to be the hero that saved everyone from the fearsome warrior. He must have realized that there is no cleansing Pandora from bandits, warrior or not.. and that no one treats him like the hero he wants to be. So why not make it that way?  I've been thinking that because of one reason. The Hyperion moonshot cannon is aimed directly at the warrior before it is even awakened. Why is this necessary? Why would Jack need his moonshot cannon aimed at this spot if not to kill the warrior?   He had the vision in the pre-sequel that the warrior would destroy everything so perhaps all he wanted to do is stop him."
Borderlands,3dmjm7,profanitymyass,25,Fri Jul 17 19:43:56 2015 UTC,"If you take long enough to defeat Jack before he summons the warrior, bots are moonshot in to help him fight you.    I also feel like the moonshot cannon is easily aimed.  It didn't take anything more than a beacon to have a canister dropped on Ulysses' head."
Borderlands,3dmjm7,Spykfase,2,Fri Jul 17 20:22:02 2015 UTC,I never knew that! I suppose that makes sense.. I just kinda thought if you have reached this point there wouldn't be a need for any further defenses.. you already proved that you got past everything he has when you reached Angel.
Borderlands,3dmjm7,profanitymyass,5,Sat Jul 18 07:38:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, that doesn't mesh very well. Jack is the sort of ruthless douchebag to cover his ass that well, sure. But he's also the sort of twisted opportunistic prick to pick up parts of the Destroyer and use the grotesque flayed and reshaped chunks as cybernetically enhanced super weapons. The Warrior's built pretty much like a crysalisk, there's not a lot of gooey meaty gibs to shove wires into and ""harness"" for whatever kinda corporate jackassery Hyperion had in mind. Although we know Jack would try.  It fits Jack's corporate mindset to run a cost analysis on simply wandering across an alien superweapon instead of sinking money into R&D or reverse engineering anything found."
Borderlands,3dmjm7,LividWonk,2,Sat Jul 18 04:59:53 2015 UTC,"Wait, what was the enhanced super weapons that he made from the destroyer?"
Borderlands,3dmjm7,JewfroSamurai666,7,Sat Jul 18 06:16:09 2015 UTC,"This was really hard to find. Jack and crew, or just Hyperion, snagged the Destroyer's eye, snapped it into a focal array and fired it up as Helios Station's laser. This is what Zarpedon was firing at Elpis throughout the pre-sequel."

Borderlands,3dmjm7,Semigloss01010001,10,Fri Jul 17 20:10:34 2015 UTC,That's a pretty cool theory. It makes sense to that the vault and the key need to mature so to speak and artificially accelerating the process will open the vault but it'll be half assed.
Borderlands,3dmjm7,Mytherio,26,Fri Jul 17 15:42:05 2015 UTC,"That's an awesome theory! I love it! One problem though, why would the warrior need to 'cook' if it had just been chilling at the bottom of the vault for hundreds of years even before the first vault was opened?"
Borderlands,3dmjm7,Mytherio,38,Fri Jul 17 14:59:02 2015 UTC,"Well how long has Pandora been colonized? They said it was uncharted before Dahl and the rest got there, maybe the Warrior awoke, raged, and then went back to sleep.   Or, quite possibly, it works something like an Eridian Phoenix- every 200 years, until it's woken, it goes through a regeneration cycle.   Idk, I'm spitballing at this point lol"
Borderlands,3dmjm7,PUNTS_BABIES,9,Fri Jul 17 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there's no way to know exactly how long Pandora has been civilized, but the vault seems very manual, like the Warrior could only appear if summoned by the key. I like that Phoenix explanation though!"
Borderlands,3dmjm7,EricTheKlein,9,Fri Jul 17 16:00:33 2015 UTC,Maybe the key is just to control it. Without the key it's basically a wild dragon thing.
Borderlands,3dmjm7,VeteranKamikaze,7,Fri Jul 17 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe opening a vault releases all the eridian that had been charged up throughout Pandora. Thus requiring the 200 years for it to replenish (as well as charge the key. ) So with Jack's plan, the key was charged but Pandora was not."
Borderlands,3dmjm7,LividWonk,4,Fri Jul 17 21:40:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe he awakens at full strength every 200 years when the key is charged, ready to be released, and then goes back to sleep and wanes as the energy from the key leaves."

There's definitely something to be said about the actual technical workings of it -- big boss fight, it'd probably help if players could beat it. But I'd like to think you're absolutely onto something. I'm not sure if the story writers thought that specifically, but I think they may have been edging towards this. The idea of Jack being a part of his own downfall sounds pretty good."
Borderlands,3dmjm7,DigbyMayor,3,Fri Jul 17 19:12:23 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck.   To be honest, when I first was fighting it, I did not know the chest was a weak spot.

Borderlands,3dmjm7,advicealligator,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:18 2015 UTC,"I really like this theory, though I have to make a few points. One: Is the key Jack charging the same key that opened the previous vault; hence why he needed to accelerate the process? Or does each of the many vaults seen on the map have individual keys required to open? Two: We don't know the exact timing of the creation of the vaults, nor if they were previously opened and if so, which ones were. So for all we know the Warrior and/or the Destroyer were either dormant or awakened prior to the plot lines we experience. Also, we don't know if the vault naturally opens every 200 hundred years meaning the Eridians either left the Guardians of each vault to a) Defend it while it's opened, naturally or b) Defending from the potential to open through humanity discovering a key. Finally, I believe that if the Warrior is at full potential, the Eridian creators didn't expect how powerful humanity and it's weapons would/could become kind of like if a 'Godzilla' of sorts were to appear we'd be able to deal with it, despite having huge casualties it would be doable. Just a thought, though."
Borderlands,3dp8b0,savage24x,9,Sat Jul 18 03:16:54 2015 UTC,"There is a trick to this mission, a bug maybe? At any rate, for the mission Stratesque, when you activate the Constructor and send it on it's way, STAY in the general area where you activated it. Do not follow it. You may have to guide it around the corner to the constructors left... but after that, stop. It will not be attacked (because the enemies don't spawn unless you walk into the area) and will continue the mission unabated until complete.   It takes a while (no longer than it would if you were defending it), but it usually works. And you can still do other stuff around the map, just stay far away from the constructor as he laserblasts the statues.   EDIT: Also, hit up the chest in Sanctuary if you haven't already.

The trick is to just never come near the constructor, just let him do all the work. Very, very few enemies will spawn and he will never be in danger of getting blown up.   I always do all the side missions in Opportunity all at once. Just start Statuesque and focus on the other missions. Statuesque will just finish by itself."

Borderlands,3dp8b0,AlexS101,11,Sat Jul 18 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"Don't let numbers fool you. Make sure to use weapons that suit your play style and your skill build. Sniper rifles typically aren't the best on Axton. Axton shines brightest when speced into most explosive boosting skills and paired with Torgue weapons. Make sure to use grenades.  Axton is generally considered the worst vault hunter, but he is still very usable. As a general rule - try to work with your characters strong suits.   I am by no means an expert, but try this build on for size while using a Torgue shotgun.   Also, don't underestimate slag."
Borderlands,3dp8b0,PungentKillstick,3,Sat Jul 18 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not well versed enough in BL2 hardcore meta to dispute you judging how good Axton is - but I feel that he's the easymode curbstomping character that smashes everything that isn't a raidboss.  I definitely agree on your advice to OP.  To OP: You definitely should try abusing the shit out of rocket launchers and grenades as Axton because it just gives you so much power to clear the majority of everything you fight - just as long as you extend the amount of grenades and rocket ammo you can carry as much as possible. Abusing slag+correct element for you foe makes quite a big difference too.  I honestly love grenades in the Borderlands games and I think they're underrated for fighting everything that isn't a raidboss - and even then I nearly killed Terramorphous with only just using some Tesla grenades as Axton. It doesn't hurt to carry around various element and types of grenade mods for each sort of foe you might come across - and god help your enemies if you manage to get a good Legendary Grenade Mod like the ""Storm Front""."
Borderlands,3dp8b0,BlameTheJungler,2,Sat Jul 18 04:24:09 2015 UTC,"He only means that as far as curb-stomp potential, Axton is the weakest. All the other characters are much stronger."

He just doesn't have anything very special about what he does compared to the others -he doesn't really have a defining feature outside of the turret - which is arguably not very good.  But still, I guess its good to have a video game noob-friendly option there for people who need it or can't make up their minds."

Borderlands,3dp8b0,Ultra-Bad-Poker-Face,4,Sat Jul 18 10:38:10 2015 UTC,"But that's not because of anarchy, that's because of the BFF tree that is literally made for noobs. Anarchy is still difficult later levels even with BFF because her range is so shit, especially with his stacks, that you need to literally be facefucking your enemy to hit them and gain stacks the most efficient (I find a low-clip jakobs shotgun works perfectly), or just hope that you are lucky with your ricochet but that is unreliable."
Borderlands,3dp8b0,Sayie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:57:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe she's not as OP as Sal, but with a lot of stacks and Close Enough you hardly even need to aim. I was shredding through most stuff as her that had me banging my head as Axton."

My playstyle of ""TORGUE MOTHERF*CKIN SUICIDE DIVE BOMBER"" doesn't sit well with most others.  It...takes some getting used to if you want to kill stuff AND live.

Borderlands,3dp8b0,IcyNova115,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:46:28 2015 UTC,Anarchy Gaige + Close Enough + Conference Call = win!
Borderlands,3dp8b0,jemmoo6,-2,Sat Jul 18 07:45:49 2015 UTC,"You're completely wrong.  I've got two Axton characters and he's my favourite to play as because of versatility.  Axton is all about being efficient at all ranges, like a soldier. I always play him non-elemental.  At the beginning of a battle with raiders, I start off at long distance picking off the first lot with sniper shots, then when the psychos get close I can quickly take them down with a Jakob's shotgun, taking advantage of the faster strafing speed.  Then I can find good cover and switch to a Vladof assault rifle and the battle changes to medium range - here's where the reduced recoil really becomes powerful.  The turret comes as support when I start getting overwhelmed from behind as well as in front.  Maya - pull all enemies into one space and slag them all, obliterating them with elemental damage. Zero - insta-kill headshots, and limited in UVHM to only long range. Salvador - all you need to do is keep the trigger held. Gaige - same as Salvador. Krieg is the only one who I think has the really creative playstyle.  A noob would suffer in UVHM if they chose to play as Axton, but that's why I also find him more fun than most of the other characters.  He's powerful, but not so much that you can just run around in circles and watch everything die."
Borderlands,3dp8b0,DiskPidge,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:48:30 2015 UTC,"Right so listen.  I've just given my opinion that I think Axton is the easy pick of all the heroes - friendly to beginners etc. OP is playing playthrough 2 but that comment of mine that you replied to was just my abstract thoughts. What I said is completely subjective.  Then you come along saying   You're completely wrong.   And then proceed to just talk about how you play Borderlands 2. That isn't telling me why or how I am wrong.  OP isn't playing UVHM either, however I disagree with:   He's powerful, but not so much that you can just run around in circles and watch everything die.   Rocket launcher axton with various rocket launchers of each element can faceroll anything even in UVHM as long as it isn't a raidboss - but again - that is just my personal experience. Metal storm and onslaught combo is fun ^ o ^"

He's my favorite, and I've legit solo'd every raid except Vermi.  The lowest I ever got him to spawn was with two people. The raids just take longer (usually) with Axton.

The turtle shield health penalty gets way out of hand (cough Hoplite cough), and skills like Light the Fuse become insanely weak. It's meant to be an extreme challenge mode for the hardcore min-maxers who thought level 61 was too easy.  Also, get a Rough Rider for Krieg to mitigate the self-hits. Try Feed the Meat and an adaptive shield with a high health boost for the time being (remember: melee Krieg is an example of when increasing max health is a good thing)."

Borderlands,3dqir9,TenspeedGames,6,Sat Jul 18 14:45:30 2015 UTC,What? It's been known for ages that OP8 mania Kriegs should be running Rough Rider with all the health stacking they can get. STV procs ends up doing about 15% hp dmg?

Borderlands,3dqir9,Jatsala,2,Sat Jul 18 15:29:15 2015 UTC,It was a really tough choice for me between the Rough Rider and a Maliwan Hide of Terra. Dat roid bonus... Mmmmm...
Borderlands,3dqir9,Zombie_DooDoo,2,Sat Jul 18 17:06:54 2015 UTC,"It's not a tough choice at all to be honest.  Are you Meleeing primarily during RtB/BxR or not? Your answer is as simple as that really.  Due to how the melee formula works, even a perfect parts Hide will only contribute ~10% additional damage during Buzz Axe Rampage.. If you plan to melee outside of BXR, then yea, Roid shields become the primary source of damage."
Borderlands,3dqir9,likwidstylez,2,Sat Jul 18 17:21:42 2015 UTC,"I don't really find the health scaling to be an issue. Characters like Maya, Krieg (even with STV), and Sal don't really need to worry about it much because their tanky enough anyway.  Characters like Axton, Gaige, and Zer0 just need to play a little more conservatively and they'll be fine. I run Axton most of the time with no Moxxi weapons and I do just fine. A purple slag transfusion grenade and a cool head will keep you alive much better than more health ever would."
Borderlands,3dqir9,Jatsala,2,Sat Jul 18 15:28:12 2015 UTC,Axton can tank super well if you're running a Survival build. Most people do Guerrilla/Gunpowder nowadays though so high defense isn't very common.
Borderlands,3dqir9,brandpanz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and Maya, Krieg, and Sal aren't tanky enough without the extra health.  Maya works well because her OP8 Nurse mods are broken with L72 health.  Melee Krieg needs Rough Rider for tank builds.  Salvador's Brawn tree isn't enough without a Rough Rider either, and most people just slap on some Moxxi and call it good anyways.  Your point about ""most people use X build nowadays"" is exactly the problem.  At level 72 your build can still let you pick what you want (more or less).  At OP8, tank builds pretty much rely on specific builds and that's never fun in a game."

Borderlands,3dqir9,Jatsala,2,Sun Jul 19 12:46:42 2015 UTC,"On my phone atm, but the most common Survival path is Preparation/Pressure/Quick Charge/Resourceful/Grit/Gemini, with Phalanx Shield and Mag-Lock being optional. Generally people combine this with Guerrilla (Sentry, Willing and Able being the best defense skills there) as well as Longbow Turret for more turret aggro. Most COMs (save Specialist; it's crap) will work well, but Leg. Soldier, Leg. Engie, and then both Rangers (the regular one can boost Grit which is amazing) are probably the big standouts."

It's a videogame, the whole point is to have fun. Too many people complained that op8 was too hard all throughout BL2's lifecycle and now 2KA left it out of TPS, which I think was a huge mistake.

Borderlands,3dnfmq,brandpanz,13,Fri Jul 17 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"It's a great weapon, but not ""broken good"" like some of the other top tier weapons out there (looking at DPUH, Sandhawk, etc.) Definitely one of the best SMGs out there, and I especially like it's design since it rewards good FPS play rather than allowing you to just spit out tons of pellets for damage.  For farming, this weapon is extremely rare. More rare than most of legendaries. There is a reason for this.  Bunker, the boss that drops the Bitch, doesn't drop the Bitch as it's only featured legendary. It also drops the Sham and a bunch of legendary skin mods. Now the way the drop tables work is that you first roll to see what tier drop you get, then you roll to determine the specifics of the drop. In other words, the chance to get a specific featured legendary is a fraction of the chance to get one of any of them from a boss.  Example: Say all bosses have a 5% chance to drop their featured legendary. This means you can expect 5% of all Savage Lees to drop some variant of the Unkempt Harold. However, Bunker has multiple legendaries that fall into this pool. So whereas you have a 5% chance to get one of them, the chance of getting a specific one of them is 5%/n, where n is the number of featured legendaries. Bunker has 8 (6 class skins + Sham + Bitch), thus the drop rate of the Bitch is actually .625%, much much lower than what you would expect. Of course, this means that the drop rate for the Sham would also be this number (keeping in mind that I made up the 5% initial figure, I'm not sure what the drop chance actually is).  Because of this fact, farming for the Bitch/Sham tends to be a pretty painful process. I would honestly advise people NOT to farm the Bitch because of this. It's a great SMG, but as far as DPS goes it's not as good as other more easily farmable options (just to name a few: Conference Call, DPUH, Lyuda). That's not to mention a ton of other guns that are a bit more challenging to farm but also better (ex: Omen, Interfacer, Plasma Casters, etc.- fun fact, the Bitch actually does pretty much the same DPS as a Plasma Caster, even taking to account criticals, due to the Plasma Caster's splash damage). If you need something that packs a punch, it's probably a better idea to farm for one of those guns instead, and save yourself the headache."

After getting two drops with 100+ BNK-3R kills and using gibbed to change the element/parts, I absolutely love it.  Takes care of shields and fire resistant enemies nicely, even at OP8.  Fairly obvious, but Legendary Cat Maya is the way to make this gun seriously good."
Borderlands,3dnfmq,nathanj0872,2,Sat Jul 18 04:22:43 2015 UTC,"I've gotten the bitch at several levels (9, 18, and now 47) on my current playthrough with Gaige.  Even with anarchy the gun stays accurate enough to aim for crit shots.  Paired well with my Bee shield.  Up until yesterday (got a lvl 51 redundant fibber) the Bitch was my go-to weapon alongside the Shredifier."
Borderlands,3dnfmq,erethangbagel,2,Fri Jul 17 19:23:37 2015 UTC,"Would it be easier to do loot midget runs if one wanted to get a Bitch (or Sham) instead of farming bunker? I understand the loot pool is obviously much larger, but you almost always get a legendary or higher drop on a loot midget run, so you may get something else of value that you want as well."
Borderlands,3dnfmq,BlameTheJungler,2,Sat Jul 18 04:38:54 2015 UTC,"For the pre sequel, the bitch (shut up i refuse to call it the fatale) loses some versatility from always being cryo, but the cryo crit damage bonus on top of its innate crit bonus lets it shred anything once their shields are dropped. If youre playing Jack, you can switch from a TORGUE gun to give the bitch explosive damage which is also increased against frozen enemies"
Borderlands,3dnfmq,HOWDOIVESTS,2,Sat Jul 18 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"The Cheat Code is basically the Bitch, and unlike the Fatale it comes in all elements."

Borderlands,3dolry,buttsalt14,11,Fri Jul 17 23:47:58 2015 UTC,"Basically, Overpower Levels make everything in the game a level higher than before. Overpower 1 means 1 level higher. Overpower 2 is 2 levels higher, so on up to Overpower 8 and 8 levels higher. Your hp does not scale, but the loot you gain and the HP of the enemies you fight do scale.  Essentially, yes, all they do is make the game harder."
Borderlands,3dolry,ScootaLewis,6,Sat Jul 18 00:00:36 2015 UTC,So everything goes up a level except the HP? Including shields and everything?
Borderlands,3dolry,Venaetus,10,Sat Jul 18 00:22:31 2015 UTC,"Your HP is dependant on your level, and since OP levels do not increase your own level (you stay at 72), only enemies', your HP will not be affected. Enemies' HP will be increased because their level will be higher.   Enemies gain damage reduction as they outlevel you. (55% at level 80, assuming you're 72) This is dependant on the enemy's level itself, not the overpower level. (Read: overpower 8 means enemies can get up to +8 levels, but that doesn't mean all enemies will be +8. Some might be +7 or +6. Also, some enemies [mainly bosses] will pass that overpower cap, getting +10 or +11. )  It's also worth noting that you get new gear as you gain OP levels. An OP8 gun is really a level 80 gun, but you can use it at 72, as long as you have OP8 unlocked. It will have better stats than a level 72 gun, since it's essentially a higher level. Enemies' guns and shields/etc also scale with overpower levels.  The wiki has some more information, if you want to read it."
Borderlands,3dolry,ScootaLewis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:37:54 2015 UTC,"No, bosses don't get +10/+11 levels - they get +8, as does everything else. Not every enemy is always level 72. Bosses at 72 are usually around 74."
Borderlands,3dolry,ScootaLewis,3,Sun Jul 19 13:04:37 2015 UTC,"The loot you have doesn't level up, but you gain the ability to gain loot that has ""overpower requirements"" instead of level requirements.  But yes, everything else does scale up."

Borderlands,3dmvg9,MmeVivienne,3,Fri Jul 17 17:47:00 2015 UTC,"Eeven though melee Zer0 is my personal favorite playstyle and an extremely powerful too, I would actually not recommend to use it on the lower difficulties (I started using it when I started UVHM). To make a melee Zer0 build work the best way, it's important to have certain skills that unfortunately appear far into a skill tree, because they provide the necessary synergies. My suggestion would be, to re-spec into the sniping skilltree. especially to pick up skills like One Shot One Kill, Killer and b0re. Also, you should've already unlocked the side mission ""The Good, the Bad and the Mordecai"". I would recommend you doing this side mission (if you haven't already), because at the end you fight against two guys, and one of them (Gettle) has a chance to drop the legendary sniper (and also the best legendary sniper) the ""Lyuda"" (or White Death on Xbox I think). Try farming Gettle for a Lyuda/White Death and best case scenario he drops a corrosive one. It will be a few levels below you, but I'm certain it's a powerful enough sniper to take on your current mission even without being on your level. The skills like One Shot One Kill, Killer and b0re also synergize really well with Shotguns, so don't feel obligated to oooonly use Snipers, because it's called the Sniping skill tree."
Borderlands,3dmvg9,everyonelovescake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"As Zer0 you have the benefit of being your best at a distance, so the best strategy, imo, would be to find reliable shelter at a distance from the constructor and continue to snipe his eyeball for critical hits. If you get cornered by robot lackies, run out and kill them then run back while keeping on eye on the constructor's eyeball in case he starts charging his beam.   That's my basic strategy for constructors and I play as Maya, so you shouldn't have any trouble as Zer0 with long distance fights."

They are too tough to melee kill in my experience, sit back and only shoot it when it isn't going to shoot back.   The constructor in the wildlife preservation mission killed me quite a few times :3  Also you are level 23 and that mission is level 26 so that will make it REALLY hard."

Borderlands,3dmvg9,everyonelovescake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:22:12 2015 UTC,"As Sniper Zero I usually take at least one green or even purple Jakobs sniper rifle with me to take constructors down quickly (white and blue are bolt action and limit your DPS a little, it's also annoying unless you're sniping from very far away). You'll find the crit bonus damage helps, a lot, especially with their huge crit spot begging to be shot.  Go into deception, run to the side if possible, pray it doesn't go into nuke mode, wait until the last second as you line up your sight, and squeeze the trigger. A lot. Empty that magazine like your life depends on it (it does). If it's still not dead after all of that, you're either very underleveled or you should do it one more time.  As melee Zero, get a roid shield going, go into deception, get close to it, drop a grenade with a low fusetime, watch your shield vanish and your damage get fuckhuge, boop it on the eyeball with your Execution skill and enjoy the explosion. Maybe shoot at it with an SMG if it somehow lives after that.  Also to not get oneshot: find some sort of way to replenish your health. Always stay over 50% health, that way you can't get downed immediately and it gives you a brief moment of invulnerability when you do get stomped. More info on that can be found by googling ""borderlands healthgate""."

Borderlands,3dpaxs,nathanj0872,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:06:07 2015 UTC,"You should be able to farm for a bit. But don't go crazy and reach level 53 or something, because once you start UVHM you'll be facing level 53 bandits with level 50 gear, and it's almost impossible if you're fighting multiple enemies.  You could probably farm for the Lyuda, since that's a pretty short run and you won't gain much experience if you ignore all the other enemies and just kill Gettle. Or getting the Trespasser from Mordecai might be helpful if you don't already have it. But I don't have a sniper Zer0 so I don't actually know what guns he's best with :-P  As for the  DLC, I'd recommend starting UVHM to get a feel for the difficulty and maybe getting some on-level guns. Maybe play up until you get to Sanctuary. Then you could hop into the DLC's and play them without worrying about out-leveling your gear. It'll be a lot harder than TVHM, but that just means better loot!"

Borderlands,3dmuqg,Semigloss01010001,2,Fri Jul 17 15:45:12 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly no professional anything, but I think it would be more beneficial to pick up Numbed Nerves instead of Fire Fiend. If you're BARing most of the time, the accuracy and reload speed isn't going to help. And the chance to ignite on melee isn't all that helpful, considering you're going to 2 hit most things.   Perhaps drop Burn, Baby Burn if favor of Fuel the Fire for improved slag chance on kill.   The pitiful melee damage you get from Pain is Power isn't worth the massive critical reduction, I would think. When in BAR with this build you'll be getting 1200% more melee damage. An extra 100% when on fire isn't going to be game changing. But 50% reduced critical hit damage will. I know it's boosted by the class mod, but it just isn't worth it.  This would be my amateur recommendation."

Seriously, I'll be getting 80 fps with physX on in an area, open my inventory and it will not go above 40.

Tps is okay, playable and a good game, but once you max out one character(even if you do) you'll go back to bl2 for sure. In handsome edition you are getting like +300$ worth of content so its worth"
Borderlands,3dkmu6,dominic_se,2,Fri Jul 17 01:12:33 2015 UTC,"Wow shit, I just got Handsome collection for £26 (about $50?) On Xbone, had no idea there was that much in it.  Will be good to finally play through, I've started it well over 10 times getting up to sanctuary.  It's pretty good playing 4 player splitscreen as well."
Borderlands,3dkmu6,KeenPro,2,Fri Jul 17 07:39:26 2015 UTC,actually the price is closer to $40
Borderlands,3dkmu6,KillerKittyKhajiit,7,Fri Jul 17 12:53:05 2015 UTC,"Sometimes TPS feels like a long DLC for BL2, but I really enjoyed it. I actually prefer some of the mechanics in TPS more like the weapon scaling, cryo damage, the jumping, the talent trees and playable characters. And Claptastic Voyage is definitely on par with Tiny Tina's DLC from BL2. And Glitch weapons are amazing. TPS just doesn't match up with secondary characters, story, main mission, side missions and level design. I find myself going back and forth between the two games. Do a play through in one, do a play through in the other, back and forth so it keeps everything fresh. Handsome collection is a solid purchase. Also gives all DLC characters for both games."
Borderlands,3dkmu6,Vulchur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:43:55 2015 UTC,"Definately agree with this.  I love the guns and weapon system in TPS and just the polished feel of the systems in general.  I like the humor, it could be better, but I like it.  Lot of hate for the TPS around but not from me.  I am enjoying the doppleganger alot.  Oddly Im not annoyed by claptrap, I find him kinda funny sometimes, but I dont like to play him."

Probably gonna be between 35 and 40 bucks. I paid 42 in the last sale and didn't regret it.  I however didn't enjoy the Pre-Sequel as much as 2. It's not bad by any means, just fairly repetitive."
Borderlands,3dkmu6,profanitymyass,2,Fri Jul 17 08:53:56 2015 UTC,thats not a great sale since you can get a physical copy from Amazon for 40 or less

When I was transferring my PS3 saves over, I was flicking between the PS3/PS4 inputs on the TV, and was absolutely floored by what a difference the 1080p makes. The game looks stunning, absolutely worth it for that alone. The amount of DLC is impressive, too, although I'm kicking myself in that I brought a lot of it at full price when it came out!  I'm just about finished the Pre-Sequel at the moment, and it really does have its flaws, I've still had good time with it - lots of interaction with Handsome Jack and exploring some of the Hyperion back story make it worth it. It's a beautiful game, with interesting level design. Not to mention looking up and seeing Helios so close in the sky is incredible! (But goddamn, the questing. It's never A to B. It's A - oh, something went wrong! - to C, to fucking about in a corner D, to all the way back to B.)  Regardless, I've really enjoyed my time with Athena and Doppleganger Jack, and all the classes are on a par with anything from BL2. I've heard great things about the Claptrap DLC, so I'm looking forward to trying it next!"
Borderlands,3dkmu6,blue_mutagen,3,Fri Jul 17 09:21:46 2015 UTC,"You should buy the handsome collection, totally. TPS is pretty good, nowhere near as bad as other people will tell you. It's basically more, different borderlands for when other borderlands is getting stale."

Borderlands,3diho4,ScootaLewis,66,Thu Jul 16 15:26:39 2015 UTC,"too much like BL2   To elaborate on that, all the standard white-purple weapons were literally exactly as they were in BL2.  Granted there were a few changes; bandit is now scav, lasers, and cryo instead of slag, but so many were exactly the same."
Borderlands,3diho4,nathanj0872,46,Thu Jul 16 17:39:51 2015 UTC,So many legendaries were just complete copies with a changed name as well.
Borderlands,3diho4,Kingfury4,22,Thu Jul 16 17:58:39 2015 UTC,Conference Call -> Viral Marketer for example
Borderlands,3diho4,MayhemCha0s,19,Thu Jul 16 18:00:56 2015 UTC,Unkempt Harold was the same as the 88 Fragnum too I believe.
Borderlands,3diho4,Kingfury4,37,Thu Jul 16 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"I bet there were guys naming these guns arguing how the name them:  ""Conference Call!""  ""Viral Marketer!""  ""Conference Call!""  ""Viral Marketer!""    and after it was named Conference Call and TPS was announced the other guys was like:  ""Now I get my name!"""
Borderlands,3diho4,MayhemCha0s,19,Thu Jul 16 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"Neither Fragnum nor the VM is a ""complete copy with a changed name.""  Both differ mechanically in very substantial ways from their predecessors, probably because their predecessors ended up breaking BL2's game.  TPS was a good opportunity to nerf these guns noncontroversially by replacing them."
Borderlands,3diho4,Daemmerung,11,Thu Jul 16 18:15:43 2015 UTC,"I can understand an Unkempt Harold nerf, but not the Conference Call.  It was only game-breaking when amp damage applied per pellet, but after that got changed it was solid but just below ""must have"" IMO."
Borderlands,3diho4,nathanj0872,3,Thu Jul 16 19:27:18 2015 UTC,still pretty OP on a Gaige Anarchy build. No need for aiming.
Borderlands,3diho4,IC_Pandemonium,11,Fri Jul 17 01:26:30 2015 UTC,"Literally every gun is OP with anarchy, as long as there are lots of bullets"
Borderlands,3diho4,Superboy309,3,Fri Jul 17 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"""No need to aim"" is true for most weapons on anarchy builds though.  And while the Conference Call is a solid pick, it's not as good as a Fibber.  Little things like that are why I don't understand why it was nerfed."
Borderlands,3diho4,nathanj0872,2,Fri Jul 17 03:59:31 2015 UTC,Nevertheless do these guns have the exact same design
Borderlands,3diho4,MayhemCha0s,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:07 2015 UTC,I had my heart set on quadruple tree.
Borderlands,3diho4,Shawasted,4,Fri Jul 17 04:47:20 2015 UTC,Not the same: The spread bullet pattern is now just a random 8-12 bullet shotgun pattern with low accuracy. Not as good as a Harold.
Borderlands,3diho4,Aulritta,46,Thu Jul 16 18:47:38 2015 UTC,TPS felt like a BL2 expansion pack.
Borderlands,3diho4,Ghopper101,34,Thu Jul 16 18:00:59 2015 UTC,"It really did.  What they did was they made a ""filler game"" to give the fans something to do while they wait for BL3 or Battleborn. They handed BL2 to 2KA and told them to let 'er rip. TPS is the result.   It was never supposed to be on the scale of BL2.  Please, understand that.  It was never supposed to be on the scale of BL2."
Borderlands,3diho4,ScootaLewis,30,Thu Jul 16 18:03:25 2015 UTC,"Then they shouldn't have charged as much as they did for BL2.  A smaller game deserves a smaller pricetag, especially given how much less work went into it due to asset re-use."
Borderlands,3diho4,Volcanicrage,16,Thu Jul 16 19:49:57 2015 UTC,Exactly the problem with it. The main game felt like a BL2 DLC and the DLC felt like a ripoff.

Borderlands,3diho4,NobleV,7,Thu Jul 16 21:38:45 2015 UTC,Krieg and Gaige were not part of the BL2 season pass.  It was the 4 major expansions and the first Cap increase.
Borderlands,3diho4,JDBriggsBlader,2,Thu Jul 16 23:07:18 2015 UTC,Was Gaige part of a pre-order thing? If not I'm sure she came with the Season Pass. I definitely bought her bundled with something else.

Borderlands,3diho4,IC_Pandemonium,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:29:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I bought the game a little while after release for like $40 then bought the GOTY recently, because it was more value than actually buying the DLC"
Borderlands,3diho4,Superboy309,55,Fri Jul 17 02:05:37 2015 UTC,"This is the response I gave before to this question. I feel like it captures most critics' thoughts really well on this matter  I think the biggest problem with TPS is the lack of content compared to BL2.   TPS has:   A shorter main campaign with fewer sidequests Only 1 DLC campaign compared to 4 Along the same line, only 2 raid bosses (counting Ned) compared to 8! (Terra, Verm, Hyperius, Gee, Pete, Vora, Dex, Dragons), even more if you count the Headhunter bosses as raid bosses. All of these are new, unique fights rather than a harder instance of another boss (with the sole exception of Pyro Pete, but even that fight thats some new mechanics involved) 3 Slaughterdomes compared to 4 2 entire weapon tiers that do not exist (Seraph & Pearl, considering E-Tech and Glitch to be more or less equal-I know color says otherwise but actual behavior suggests these two to be most similar) Along that same line, tons of Legendaries that are merely recycled ideas. I actually think there are more recycled Legendaries than new ones. Don't get me wrong, it is perfectly fine to recycle Legendaries, but only in moderation. It's so unfun to get a Legendary drop, use it to find out what it does, only to find out that it's the same thing you've used to years in BL2, or worse, an inferior version of it Luneshine feels completely worthless   Don't get me wrong, TPS is a good game by itself and there is a lot of things that it does right (Grinder, better skill trees, etc.). But compared to BL2, there is a disappointing lack of content."
Borderlands,3diho4,Zaaptastic,27,Thu Jul 16 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"fewer sidequests   And the side quests were given by less interesting/familiar characters: If an established character like Dr Zed gives you a fetch quest, it doesn't feel as pointless as ""Random Scientist #5"" giving you a fetch quest. The outcome may be the same, but execution matters. TPS felt like more of a grind than BL2."
Borderlands,3diho4,poke86,12,Thu Jul 16 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"And maybe this is included in the execution bit, but it felt like their were a lot more tedious fetch quests. Could be that everything was more spread out, so each quest felt longer, but it seemed like every other quest was more or less   Go here and retrieve this item/turn on this switch  Oh, the item wasn't there/the switch is broken? Go here instead to search/find a replacement part Go back to the first spot and try again. It worked? Great! Now go here and get the next item.   A lot of the quests I could have just ignored the dialogue and chased the waypoint around the map without missing much.  I still enjoy the game and have recently gotten back into it (the Claptrap DLC was amazing), but some of the quests just feel really low effort."
Borderlands,3diho4,DekuNut,2,Thu Jul 16 20:32:11 2015 UTC,"its a shame, because i liked TPS VH's more than i did with BL2. they were more vibrant and totally different. i liked BL2 vaulthunters, but TPS did it for me.."
Borderlands,3diho4,Mercyva,3,Fri Jul 17 04:02:28 2015 UTC,"I think a few of these are all bundled into the DLC issue. Some of these should just be bundled into ""the season pass sucked."" The season pass got you only one campaign, which is definitely a rip off, which is why I wait for the DLCs to be released before I buy. If there had been more DLCs, some of these other points would be fixed. I guess this is all to say, I still think the base game was worth the price, and if you didn't get the season pass, you didn't get ripped off. But I agree, it was disappointing the campaign was shorter and the side quests were less interesting. I didn't even do a majority of them."

If they had just put more effort into the campaign and side quests, I'd say it could've matched BL2, even if there weren't a lot of new mechanics. I never expected TPS to change things up to much.

Borderlands,3diho4,Tsplodey,2,Thu Jul 16 15:48:34 2015 UTC,Many because the fans boycott 2kau so they couldn't make more dlc
Borderlands,3diho4,NeoZenith1,14,Fri Jul 17 03:04:34 2015 UTC,"The ""too BL2, not enough BL2"" argument is the real core of the problem. To elaborate, the BL2 team created a solid core game with some really memorable bits to it and then spent another few years building on that success with some average-to-great DLC's, regular Golden Key offers, free skins and heads, and tie-ins to other products. All of thus served to keep us engaged and we watched as the DLC's steadily improved in quality overall. The loot was better, the introduced characters became legendary (two words, baby: Torgue, Explosions), and the existing characters got more depth and development.   The last mission pack, Son of Crawmerax, was really the highlight of their efforts. You could note the differences between the original BL2 and how far they had progressed in the writing and look of the game. The graphics were polished and the levels more detailed and pretty to look at.  So with all of this amazement offered up, 2K started crushing that post-release hype they'd worked so hard to achieve.  First came the news that a different team would be developing it. Some of us cringed, but we took it with relative stride. Then we picked up the game, and it slowly became evident that while the graphics were pretty, not much else had been carried over from BL2.  The writing was pretty bland, new characters weren't developed at all (being introduced and dropped just as quickly instead of building a potential cast to add to the existing rooster), old characters were apparently retconned to fit the new narrative, and characters just act out of, well, character. Raise your hand if you found it odd how angry and eager Lilith was to execute a certain someone at the end of the game when you could easily argue that Lilith herself seemed to be the one who threw the shit at the fan.   Once the game itself came out, TPS did little to keep us intrigued. The DLC it did offer was pretty substandard (though a lot of fans really enjoyed the Claptastic Voyage), the additional characters were confusing at best (a Jack doppleganger?) and poorly introduced at worst (I dig Miss Hammerlock but she seems to have even less reason for being here than Gaige does).   And the biggest issue for me was the gameplay. TPS doesn't play as smoothly as BL2 does, and this has nothing to do with difficulty. The level design is erratic, leveling is sluggish, and combat is incredibly tedious (fighting wave after wave after wave after wave after wave of bad guys, to the point its gets really annoying and progress-halting, and then fight one or two more waves).   The inexperience of the development team was evident, and their lack of confidence in the game itself started to turn people off of it. Finally 2K Australia just folded in on itself, so we're not likely to see them learn from their mistakes and perhaps release patches or DLC additions that might address these issues.   I've had people argue that TPS plays the way it does because 2K Aus was trying to make the game feel like a true transition between Borderland's fun-but-flawed gameplay to BL2's refined product. I don't know the truth, but if that is the case I'd say it was a bad path to take."

Borderlands,3diho4,Draconilian,6,Fri Jul 17 00:26:20 2015 UTC,"I felt that the game was bad for many reasons.   Missions can be way too long and tedious. (The Pickle mission where you have to cross the bridge is the prime example.) Comedy was absent. (The previous two games were pretty funny, but I didn't find the game funny at all.) Characters were dull. (If Claptrap is unfunny and gets old after an hour, something is just wrong.) Character progression was way too slow. (I played Athena, who is supposed to be REALLY good, but until around level 30, she is a massive let down and the shield was next to worthless for killing enemies.) Guns suck. They're just bad. (Borderlands 2 would have gun progression well enough that you'd need to replace every 2-3 levels to keep up with enemies. TPS lowered the gun damage range, making a gun usable for over 5 levels, but I felt this was awful because the guns you did get were just too weak.) Related to the guns suck, enemies were too much of a pain if you are not a higher level than them. (Every enemy is a chore if you are not higher level than them. End game enemies like the Eternals made me just want to run instead of fight.) Bosses. Every boss was a chore. (Going back to being 1 level under, RK-3 or whatever the ship was.... that was a nightmare. Then there is the Sentinel... Friend and I were 29 when he was 30 and the fight took over an hour. I believe it had 7 stages, all tedious. Corrosive/fire/shock/all in one form, 4 lifebars then corrosive/fire/shock in a bigger form.)  EDIT: Oxygen system also sucked."
Borderlands,3diho4,Hoesack,7,Thu Jul 16 19:48:21 2015 UTC,"Need to disagree with you on the characters. I also play(ed) as Athena and it was a real blast for me....I never got how people have trouble leveling her up, she is a real tank if used right."
Borderlands,3diho4,CriticalFaceTime,2,Thu Jul 16 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"I think the reason why people have trouble leveling up characters is because of how much of a slog the game is. The game is weighed down a lot to extend its length.   The game had a lot to work with but left the impression the devs pretty much said fuck it, we're going to do as much as we need to ship the game.   A lot of the game just seemed unfinished and/or forced."

Borderlands,3diho4,Hoesack,4,Fri Jul 17 18:25:59 2015 UTC,"I would not say TPS was negatively received. It has a 75 metacritic score and steam user reviews clock in at 80% favorable.  That said, it does score a bit lower than its predecessor. BL2 was a major innovation for the series, and TPS was a wonderful iteration. It gets some flak for having less content than BL2 with DLC, though I would argue that it's a more densely packed awesome."
Borderlands,3diho4,realchriscasey,12,Thu Jul 16 22:27:40 2015 UTC,"Can I just say that I LOVED TPS? The story alone is what kept me going. I love Handsome Jack, and getting to see this side of him was honestly a breath of fresh air. You actually gain quite a bit of sympathy for the guy, Lilith legitimately fucks him over at the end of the game, to where I can totally see where he's coming from calling her a bandit. I mean, every decision he made was for the greater good, she just felt like he had too much power.  Gah, I could talk more, but I'm just going to sum it up, and say that TPS sheds some light on many people's favorite character in the series, and while I see some of the points in this thread are totally valid, doesn't stop me from loving TPS."

Borderlands,3diho4,NaturalPanic,3,Thu Jul 16 18:10:27 2015 UTC,"To me it just felt ""lower quality"" in every way, than the polish that was Borderlands 2 after Gearbox ran into the ""HOLY SHITBALLS PEOPLE LIKE OUR ORIGINAL, NEW-IP GAME, WE SHOULD MAKE MORE!"" that occurred with Borderlands 1.  For example, there are places where you can easily get stuck thanks to the O2 jump-mechanic and bad collision detection.  Or the ten zillion places you can drive off the map.  I understand that can be part of the challenge, but at some point (which was long ago exceeded) it stopped being a ""challenge"" and felt more like an annoyance.  The characters were not as compelling to me, nor was the story.  And one sidequest had my fellow players and I gritting our teeth for the XP because the questgiver was so irritating."
Borderlands,3diho4,SovereignGFC,3,Thu Jul 16 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"My issue with it: the talking  First playthrough was a blast, but then every single one after that bored me, there are multiple, muuultiple times you have to wait dialog before a door opens and you can keep playing. It just kills the replay value/enjoyment"
Borderlands,3diho4,vivir66,2,Fri Jul 17 01:23:07 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue was with the enemies.  In BL2 I played as Zero and there was something immensely satisfying about shooting the arms off of robots.  Or hot the crit boxes worked on all the other enemies (like the big crystal guys).  I just never got that feel from many of the enemies in TPS.   And it wasn't just crit boxes, it was everything.  I missed my Nomads and all the other weird variations of enemies.  Everything just felt like a crappier version if the BL2 enemies.  Even the insects sucked compared to the antlions"
Borderlands,3diho4,Hellkyte,3,Thu Jul 16 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"My thoughts.......  Although packaged & sold as a full game in no way does it feel anymore than a BL2 dlc with low gravity & less fast travel to stretch the gameplay time out a bit . Slamming straight down on the ground is just rubbish too , there's times when you can literally just & slam & look away from the screen for a bit & check you phone or something while enemies health wittles down & the oz kits are a poor replacement for the relics imo which if you found a good one in BL2 you could respec your char to suit .   Levelling up takes far too long . I played the other day with a char that had just hit 42 & 4 hours later which included 20 minutes butt slam farming the doorway (that just feels wrong to type but how else can i put it ;s) in the felicity mission i was 43 & about halfway across the skill bar & this kills my enthusiasm to level up & keep playing .  Too much sexuality in the story I never needed or cared to know about & the story itself suffers from two particular cringeworthy ""could of killed you but failed"" moments .   DLC-wise particularly it feels like they just couldn't be arsed this time round unlike previously when new heads,skins & packs were coming out every other week at times & it's left the whole package as whole unfit as a successor to BL2 in my gaming time spent ."
Borderlands,3diho4,1karl1,3,Thu Jul 16 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"Too much sexuality? The only one I can think of is Springs and that gets dropped pretty much after you complete that quest in Concordia to get to Triton Flats...  though speaking of, I did really like Springs with Willhelm ""Er, not you Willhelm.

Borderlands,3diho4,transformandriseup,3,Fri Jul 17 02:24:40 2015 UTC,"Felt like a huge DLC for BL2. That and some of the game seemed pretty awkward. Moxxi appearing as the owner of yet another bar was a lil surprising, but dealable. Once they threw that Aussie accent on it just got weird. The other thing is that a lot of the humor was Aussie-themed and didn't make sense to other people or simply wasn't funny. As a Canadian, I barely understood any of the Aussie references (I didn't even realize RedBelly was a satirization of someone). Once I completed the story, I didn't feel any drive to continue playing. It didn't latch like BL2 did. Pickle felt like an after-thought, and was extremely annoying. Claptrap was awesome to play at first, and then got a bit old, thought bearable. Balance in the game felt off. I got tired of fighting mobs really fast and started just rushing levels by level 11, and was at Zarpedon by level 16. At that point, my foolishness became apparent, but even then I managed to get past Phase 1 (and she's what, level 22?).  TL;DR: Game felt like a DLC, and thrown together. Aussie humor didn't appeal to people from other countries, and balancing of the game was really off.  You know you've screwed up big time when the Claptastic Voyage DLC was 10x better than the actual base game."

The engine is the same, and the gameplay the same but it didn't have near the content that BL2 had. Another thing I think is that it tried to recreate certain things from BL2 but did not have the same reception, like trying to recreate Tiny Tina with Pickle but he turned out to be a really annoying cockney character with an ear-ache inducing voice. I appreciate the effort that they put into it and they did some thing right (such as having the player characters talk and have personalised lines unlike the more-or-less silent PCs from BL1 and 2).

Borderlands,3diho4,propargylalcohol,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think it lived up to Borderlands 1 or 2. It is a borderlands game, yes, but it seemed to lack a lot of stuff that like Borderlands 2 had like some of the bigger easter eggs and perhaps just feels like it is missing a bit of the borderlands tone that was set in 2. It did some really good stuff for the series though, and fleshed out the player characters way better than any of the other games by giving them unique reactions to stuff that is happening.  The guns were kind of super boring though. There were only a handful of original legendary guns, and a large amount of them are just renamed BL2 legendary guns that have been improved to be a bit more fleshed out and unique. I never went back for the DLC though, because I heard the first one is trash and the second one was probably ok but not worth the season pass.  Sorry if this is kind of a mess, I am not sure myself but to me it just felt like something was a bit off for the game and my subsequent playthrough but I am not exactly able to put my finger on it. Perhaps 2K australia did a bad job getting it perfect, but it is still a  fun game in the end."

All playthroughs, all DLC's (shout out to Tiny Tina's - damn that was one of the most rewarding things I've ever played!), all head hunter packs, multiple playthroughs with friends. Grinding bosses. Looting the shit out of the treasure room. We. Were. Addicted.    TPS drops. It's exciting. New content. New setting. Then it's just kind of meh. Everything feels shorter, coddled together, repetitive. It just felt like it existed outside of the world we had come to love (I realize that yes, it literally did but you get my point.) I think it was so short with smaller areas and that made Elpis just feel really foreign. And there was shit for content that was released after it. With the BL2 season pass we got four DLC's. Then the two extra characters and all the head hunter packs and OP Levels. With TPS we got two DLC's and two extra characters?   We stopped after our first playthrough.

Borderlands,3diho4,Kallure,0,Thu Jul 16 21:04:57 2015 UTC,I love all of the borderlands games but TPS is my least favorite due to the O2 system which I understand is necessary and new game mechanic but when I'm trying to explore or be in gun fights and have to stop and look for more oxygen or walk back to an oxygen geyser it just breaks the flow of the game. Other than that it has my favorite classes to play as out of all 3 games.

The main reason people still look at BL2 as the best is because of the massive ammount of support it got after release and the pretty decent endgame."

Borderlands,3dlyga,lj7094,2,Fri Jul 17 10:03:25 2015 UTC,Infinities I find are more of a novelty weapon anyways (unless used with Zer0 and even then it's not great). I'd say hold off farming for an infinity now because in about 2-3 levels it will be completely useless against the enemies. Wait until you hit your level cap (61/72) and then go ahead and farm for all the legendaries.

BL2: Krieg is probably my favorite because you can just go insane on everything and start chopping everything you want. too bad no one actually seems to use the skill for raid bosses, because of the lack of healing while you're using it. also i think kriegs gun dmg is really low.

Brick/Axton/Claptrap. Explosive is a really fun and versatile element to utilize in Borderlands. As stated above, the only real reason why Mordy is above them is because of the Assassin COM. Krieg.

TPS: Jack, Jimothy, whatever you wanna call him. His gameplay is pretty great, just tossing your minions around and siphoning their power (kill skills) and popping heads with a jakobs shotty thats been upgraded to shoot as tight as a skullmasher, or slapping nova shields on your jacks and listen to the all the nova explosions as you finish them off. Also he has my favorite voice lines, you don't expect the terrified student debtor to ham it up as much let alone more than a sadomasochist cowgirl and a robocop worshipping merc (""If you see this face, RUN!"" the delivery is just amazing).

Borderlands,3diww8,HOWDOIVESTS,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:21:55 2015 UTC,1-  Mordecai. This game is about being a fucking beast and he is one. It's all about one shotting your enemies before they even notice. Then going in with a revolver and bloodwing to scrap the remains. He is a fucking savage and has that awesome laugh. Seriously it's a shame they make him look so weak in the later games when he does sick amounts of DPS. And come on who doesn't love blasting 10 psychos heads off then tossing in bloodwing for the few remaining mooks.   2- zero. Yea I love sniper classes. Sure zero is pretty fucking weak until he hits lvl 30 but his skills are awesome and with the right upgrades he can become a ghost and slay a group of enemies without being seen at all. ( Solo is pretty tough with him though).   TPS- wihelm. In a way his skills work to basically help a sniper load out. With wolf and saint as back up you can become a offensive sniper. And he is built to come out of FFYL mode pretty easily if there is an enemy nearby. And you gotta love his dialog choices.   Honorable mentions  BL- lilth for the sweet phase walk  BL2- Krieg and his savage buzzsaw  TPS- jack double is probably the most op in the game when the points are put in the right spots.

BL1 turned gaming from a hobby into an addiction for me i think & i've always hoped to play as Athena ever since .

Borderlands,3dei9a,XStreamGamer247,17,Wed Jul 15 21:30:31 2015 UTC,"I've been praying for a Maliwan and Tediore DLC for ages. I feel like Maliwan would have some really cool super futuristic, almost Apple-esque designs for their factory. Kind of like Claptastic Voyage, except real and everything is Orange, White and Navy Blue.  As for Tediore, they're the Wal-Mart of the Borderlands universe. So I'd expect something eerily cheery, almost creepy, but ""fun"". I think it would also be able to give us a look at a more civilized lifestyle in the BL universe, as opposed to the non-stop murderthon/rapefest that is Pandora.  I'd also love to see a DLC that shows what became of Atlas after they went under. TftBL shows a great example of Post-Jack Hyperion; so what's Atlas been up to since BL1? There's no way that after having their CEO assassinated by Nakayama, they'd let the company completely dissolve- and I'm sure that someone still holds a grudge against the Vault Hunters. Make a DLC about the last of the Atlas Corp attempting to plant a mole within the Raiders, or a war between Atlas and Hyperion where the Raiders take the chance to end both corporations at once. There's still a story to be told there, and goddamnit- I want it!  The last Idea I have is for a DLC that shows the Crimson Raiders attempt to manufacture their own weapons. I've had an idea for Signature Weapons since BL2 gave us the Scorpio as a sort of siganture Roland styled weapon, the Flame of the Firehawk as a Lilith styled shield and the Trespasser as a Mordecai styled sniper. They should add Raiders as a new manufacturer, with the bonuses of being super rare with moderate to high damage and high elemental DoT, but low element chance, moderate accuracy and custom liveries and designs by Vault Hunters. By that I mean, have the weapon designs and part stylizations change up dependent on weapon type, ie: Brick and Tina design all Launchers and Grenades (More Bandit and Scav inspired parts, but expect them to have Butt Stallion and Sir Reginald decals), Krieg and Sal design all Shotguns (Urban, graffiti inspired designs), Gaige and Axton design all SMGs (with a Nam'-esque stylization, think Punk Rock meets Military), Zer0 and Mordecai design all Snipers and Revolvers (I'm thinking a Safari/South American/Mayan theme) and Maya, Auriela and Athena design all Pistols (Regal, high class, expensive. The Rolls-Royce of guns. Imagine Gold gunsights and Marble grips)."

Borderlands,3dei9a,Pesterlamps,11,Wed Jul 15 17:29:49 2015 UTC,I think I messed up. It says on the Borderlands wiki that they did. Maybe that was BL1...  EDIT: in BL2 they stopped making grenades. Fixed :)
Borderlands,3dei9a,Ultra-Bad-Poker-Face,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, Pangolin actually makes the unmodified ""protean"" grenade units. If you look around in Borderlands 2, you can see posters for them. They do not, as already noted, produce any grenade mods."
Borderlands,3dei9a,Jacecam32,3,Thu Jul 16 01:38:23 2015 UTC,anshin makes magic guns
Borderlands,3dei9a,wajaba,7,Thu Jul 16 02:34:07 2015 UTC,They are doing that slowly but surely. Not fully through DLC's but the games as well. 1st game the big issue was the Atlas Corp. with dlc for hyperion and Jakobs. (my fav dlc of that game) 2nd was obviously Hyperion. with DLC for Torgue. 3rd game you deal with Dahl soilders (though rouge from the Dahl company) You also run through bandit and Scav camps in the last 2 games so that crosses a number of them off the list.   I'm sure with the ever expanding Borderlands Universe that they will visit each company/have them be an enemy at some point. I imagine Jakobs company having a western theme to it personally
Borderlands,3dei9a,nicorani,7,Wed Jul 15 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"I hope Maliwan either stays a neutral character in the plot or gets whiped out as a whole.  Hyperion, and Atlas are obvious villain companies IMO   but Maliwan and Vladof are hero companies"
Borderlands,3dei9a,wajaba,5,Wed Jul 15 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"From the quests in BL2's Caustic Caverns, I can see Dahl being the villain at some point."
Borderlands,3dei9a,XStreamGamer247,2,Thu Jul 16 00:11:17 2015 UTC,i think TPS did that more or less
Borderlands,3dei9a,wajaba,2,Thu Jul 16 00:47:45 2015 UTC,"They've been doing it since BL1, TPS just threw the Dahl name all over everything. Lost Legion and Scavs are the exact same as Psychos and Bandits, former Dahl employees who were abandoned when Dahl got cold feet.  Main difference being that the Legion didn't go crazy. Sort of."

Borderlands,3dei9a,tazercow,2,Wed Jul 15 21:34:31 2015 UTC,Torgue's would end up being great just cause they'd have to do something kinda like cave johnsons narration a in portal but just with Torgue screaming about blowing up the ocean
Borderlands,3dei9a,Jacecam32,6,Thu Jul 16 07:14:40 2015 UTC,"A lot of those already exist.  BL1 had dlc focusing on Jacobs, Atlas, and Hyperion, BL2 had Torgue.  TPS can be seen as a Dahl dlc.  All we really need are Tediore, Maliwan, and Vladof."
Borderlands,3dei9a,Venusaurus_Rex,9,Wed Jul 15 21:08:11 2015 UTC,If they do a Tediore. Its gonna be interesting. Mrs. Tediore sounds so nice I don't think I could get mad at her.

Borderlands,3dfmm1,EmceeDeltaT,40,Wed Jul 15 22:03:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Borderlands is a more of a 'run around and fuck shit up or get fucked up immediately' kind of series.

Borderlands,3dfmm1,TeenWithADream,3,Thu Jul 16 07:36:26 2015 UTC,"It would be cool if it works like that, like a cheat you would enable. ""Persistent NPCs"" would give the world only a finite amount and if you go around killing EVERYTHING the city will start look less populated."

Borderlands,3dfmm1,orangemofo,15,Wed Jul 15 23:24:36 2015 UTC,"Borderlands is supposed to be a loud, guns-blazing slaughterfest, what with all that emphasis on fighting with mostly brute force and a bit of tactical decisions on exploiting enemy weaknesses with elemental weapons and abilities and using action skills. Sadly, one does not simply try to stealth their way through the game without alerting Pandora's wildlife and/or the bandits."
Borderlands,3dfmm1,StarBase10,6,Wed Jul 15 23:52:33 2015 UTC,"It kinda has this already. If you use a sniper rifle from a certain distance, enemies won't know you're there unless you do something to say ""HI I'M OVER HERE"" or you fire a shot."
Borderlands,3dfmm1,PotatoLiSK,5,Thu Jul 16 00:41:08 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think pre-emptive strikes with sniper rifles and a handful of action skills like Deception and Phasewalk are the closest Borderlands will ever come to doing stealth.
Borderlands,3dfmm1,sinefulcurves,8,Thu Jul 16 01:01:23 2015 UTC,"If you want a shooter with great stealth then definitely try out Far Cry 3 or 4. 3 is probably one of my favorite games I've played, it gives you the option (and the equipment) to go guns blazing or you can be 100% silent as well. Also I think the price has gone down significantly."
Borderlands,3dfmm1,rf32797,-8,Thu Jul 16 01:13:22 2015 UTC,Don't get far cry 4. It's basically the same game.

Borderlands,3dfmm1,Shark4760,4,Thu Jul 16 08:22:41 2015 UTC,You can do something eerily similar in 4
Borderlands,3dfmm1,hobowithabazooka,3,Thu Jul 16 14:25:50 2015 UTC,"Borderlands, Borderlands 2, and TPS are all just as similar if not more so to eachother as Far Cry 3/4. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Borderlands,3dfmm1,xRolexus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:49:25 2015 UTC,but at least Borderlands 2 is well written (I haven't played TPS and I don't plan to) FC4 is the same gameplay as 3 with a terrible story
Borderlands,3dfmm1,zombie_JFK,2,Thu Jul 16 21:12:27 2015 UTC,BL1 Doesn't have much of a story. BL2 changed less from 1 than far cry 4 did from 3. Far Cry 3 story was awesome. Far Cry 4 story was pretty good. It's all objective. Don't trash well made  games
Borderlands,3dfmm1,xRolexus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:16:36 2015 UTC,"Far Cry 4's story was far from good. It gave you two terrible choices extended over the entire campaign. The entire time I played the game I wanted there to be middle ground, and any reasonable person in that situation would look for that middle ground as opposed to blindly following two extremists. At the end of the game you're left with the terrible oppressive country you created and you feel even worse because it's the ending you chose. I would much rather have no choices throughout the campaign like they had in three as opposed to the illusion of choice they give you in four."
Borderlands,3dfmm1,zombie_JFK,2,Thu Jul 16 22:32:39 2015 UTC,It's subjective. I'm not gonna argue with you. I enjoyed it.
Borderlands,3dfmm1,xRolexus,4,Thu Jul 16 23:31:21 2015 UTC,Maybe as a skill for a sniper class that lets sniper rifles be silenced?
Borderlands,3dfmm1,hipsterboy,5,Thu Jul 16 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, i dunno man. As interesting as this would make gameplay, it doesn't seem terribly possible in a universe with screwy alien tech, Echo enhancement and twisted cybernetic upgrades."
Borderlands,3dfmm1,LividWonk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind a speedy version of stealth, like having a specialized line of weapons that always has suppressed weapons at the cost of being behind in damage compared to other lines.  What I mean by speed stealth is pretty much like it is now, but if you can kill enemies with the weapons from that line enemies won't aggro on you unless they can aggro on you, their aggro could be restricted to a cone as well just to allow for some stealth play. If even one enemy notices you it's pretty much full on fighting like normal, so taking it slow is kind of out of the question since going fast is more effective.  Hell a class that gets combat boosts from a line of suppressed weapons would be nice as sort of like a steroid stealth assassin. Instant kills from behind in melee range, same move speed while crouched, etc. Could even give the class a Zero type move where they cloak.   Basically the stealth doesn't need to be a puzzle/waiting game type of stealth, it could easily work as sort of an action stealthing."
Borderlands,3dfmm1,DarkHeroAxel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:58:09 2015 UTC,"I think it could potentially work as an action skill. Perhaps a siren character who could use some sort of ""Phase-Silence"" or something that would perhaps surround her gun and bullets when an aura type deal (similar to the screen changes to lillith in phasewalk or to the targeted enemy in phaselock) and allow a limited period of time where her gunfire doesn't attract the horde."
Borderlands,3dfmm1,Sir_Randy_Butternubs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:51:22 2015 UTC,Yes.  They could definitely do it and I think those otherwise pointless dart pistols may have been an abandoned attempt.  What they could theoretically do is have a dart gun that does not deal damage until you press an override trigger.  You could stealth your way around like this but might have to pull the trigger early if you get noticed.
Borderlands,3dfmm1,831pm,0,Thu Jul 16 07:21:50 2015 UTC,"Fuck. No. Borderlands is about running and gunning and being a badass, not sneaking around."

They brought a loader in, melee killed it then threw tediore guns, slagged him and that was pretty much it. I just started a Krieg playthrough not too long ago, can someone explain what they did in that video? Like how all the things they did worked with their skills."
Borderlands,3dfbuv,buttsalt14,6,Thu Jul 16 02:49:17 2015 UTC,"So basically you have this skill tree that gives you stacks of something called Bloodlust, which can accomplish several things. The 3 important things that bloodlust is doing I'm this kill is Increasing Mag Size, Grenade Damage, and Reload Speed. So first, let's talk about Tediore weapons. As we all know, they have a gimmicky mechanic where when reloaded, they will be tosses like a grenade. The amount of damage this does is directly proportional to the amount of ammunition in the weapon at the time of the reload, and grenade damage buffs. So by obtaining 100 stacks of bloodlust, his mag size increases to a huge number, which will in turn increase the power of the reload. Next, he kills an enemy with melee, which activates a skill  (Blood Bath?) that will temporarily increase grenade damage according to the number of bloodlust stacks. Since he has 100 (the max) stacks of bloodlust, his grenade damage increases by a factor of several hundred percent. Finally, the reload skill. After killing an enemy, your reload speed will increase. Once again, this is proportional to Bloodlust stacks. So by killing an enemy with melee, he massively increases grenade damage, mag size (Tediore gimmick), and reload speed, which allows him to spam Avengers at a ridiculous speed and deal massive amounts of damage.  Hoped this help!"

Borderlands 2 and especially presequel have a lot of issues with scenes cutting over eachother when the player makes the next story checkpoint b4 the previous one finished.  But this quote perfectly aligns with the game pace. No matter how many times I've run this section, no matter how fast I go, this rather long scene finishes before the next story checkpoint triggers at Overlook. I've never had it skip.

If you could save your progress somewhere short of all twenty rounds in a single sitting, it'd be playable.  But who the hell can play twenty rounds in a row?  Twenty rounds, five waves in a round, say three minutes a wave-- that's five nonstop hours, not counting time to change diapers.  If one person's pager goes off necessitating a return to the real world, the whole run is kaput."

A friend and I were doing the final challenge or whatever it was called. We went for 2 hours, and we just ended up dying. It was so disappointing and infuriating from what i remember. Maybe we just didn't know what we were doing. We were both max level though."
Borderlands,3dawqz,Peer_o,9,Tue Jul 14 21:33:04 2015 UTC,I used a low level character and my friend used his high level character and it still took 2 hours to complete each of the 3 long challenges. With very little reward to show besides an achievement and a skill point.
Borderlands,3dawqz,tikael,2,Tue Jul 14 23:51:51 2015 UTC,"If you were going for the achievements, the way to do it would be have a lvl 1 character host, and all the enemies would be scaled to that character. I wasn't close to max level, but even scaled to the lvl 1, it was pretty challenging."
Borderlands,3dawqz,Predawncarpet,2,Tue Jul 14 23:53:59 2015 UTC,"We tried to do it several times, but I was carrying most of the time. I think it would have been better with more people."

I've already gotten BL1 and BL2, I have one more achievement for TPS (get to lvl50), then hopefully they get TfTBL finished before they put out BL3."
Borderlands,3dawqz,Predawncarpet,18,Wed Jul 15 06:32:46 2015 UTC,"The best part about that dlc was the bank.  Other than that it really doesn't add anything to the base game.  Doing the 5 round missions is fun enough and doable in single player, but once you hit the 20 round missions it becomes a chore.  The modifiers give a bit of variety but it's still the same waves of enemies over and over, and the loot rewards leave a lot to be desired.    If it were possible for legendaries or uniques to drop reliably than maybe it would actually have an advantage over normal farming."

Borderlands,3dawqz,aido727,8,Wed Jul 15 01:15:58 2015 UTC,"You are missing the point, that's all it is. Nothing for doing the 20 rounder....now you might start to understand why people don't like it."
Borderlands,3dawqz,abvex,0,Wed Jul 15 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"1) I never said I didn't understand why.  2) An achievement isn't ""nothing"" to some people, nor is just having a challenge. There are a few masochistic people who actually enjoyed this.  3) You're missing my point. OPTIONAL. People would be more pissed off if something actually useful was locked behind something so difficult."
Borderlands,3dawqz,aido727,3,Wed Jul 15 05:40:40 2015 UTC,"Without the 20 rounders the whole DLC is around 90 minutes of repetitive, mindless combat against enemies that already exist in the base game."

Borderlands,3dawqz,aido727,7,Wed Jul 15 07:16:34 2015 UTC,Its alright in small doses but becomes long and tedious on the three 20 round goes. Plus I never found the loot to be that good.

Borderlands,3dawqz,aido727,4,Wed Jul 15 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"I found it far too easy actually - the modifiers were a nice idea, but they could have been much more creative with them.  It needed much less waiting around between waves, and as others have said you ought to have been able to leave the arena every few rounds to come back later.  I think the main problem was the AI - by backpedalling you could usually get most of them to follow you, meaning the combat was always directly in front and it was just a matter of throwing ammo at them.  So gradually I found myself losing concentration, just wanting the skill point reward, and making some stupid mistake where I get taken out and knocked off a ledge at the same time, not able to get a second wind, and realising I had to slump through it all again."
Borderlands,3dawqz,DiskPidge,2,Tue Jul 14 23:11:12 2015 UTC,I didn't even know people hated it; I thought it was a really fun DLC
Borderlands,3dawqz,ezrasharpe,3,Tue Jul 14 23:22:41 2015 UTC,People hated it because you had to dedicate 5 hours in a row to complete a session. And then to go through all that and get nothing good but a skill point and an achievement. Absolutely stupid.

Borderlands,3dawqz,freetogoodhome,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:47:59 2015 UTC,"The main complaint was definitely the 20-rounders.  They take at least 3 hours to finish, with the possibility if losing everything on the last enemy.  Also some of the challenge combinations can be pretty brutal depending on the party setup.  Although finishing them was a very satisfying experience."
Borderlands,3dawqz,nathanj0872,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:11:44 2015 UTC,"The only thing that I enjoyed about it was the time I spent playing it with my brother. We've started a thing where if a game we play has a horde mode, we have to get the achievements for it. We spent a great amount of time doing the Underdome achievements. I think so far, the longest we've spent though is doing all of the firefight achievements on Halo: ODST. I will never forget being about an hour into a firefight and my mom signing in to my XBL account from the downstairs xbox which signed me out and we lost all our progress."

Then followed up by the underdome for the same price. If anything the underdome should have been cheaper or free or tacked onto some dlc pack or something. Out of all the DLC's it's the most underwhelming and least amount of effort."

Borderlands,3dcj0c,PM_ME_YOUR_PANDAS,10,Wed Jul 15 05:05:09 2015 UTC,"If you go back through the unexpired codes, you get about 100. IMHO the best time to use them is to help you through normal and TVHM when you feel a bit underleveled, and maybe early UVHM. After that, you will be able to farm for specific legendaries which will be scaled to your level, so you will have less need for purples."
Borderlands,3dcj0c,StiffCrustySock,3,Wed Jul 15 05:07:48 2015 UTC,"Me and my friends did a brand new 3 player co-op and are about to complete TVHM, at which point we will stop at 50 as they don't want to do the whole story again for a 3rd time.  Did all the story/Side quests and opened a case every 2 levels. Doing Story/Side and DLC for the final run and doing the same thing, every 2 levels.  This makes golden keys fun and random (1 key per 2 levels for each person) and doesn't make the looting aspect useless to you because you have guaranteed purples all the time.  Sometimes we will get guns we don;t sue, sometimes shields, class mods, whatever. If we had just used purples all the time when it got hard, game would of been a breeze and not as fun imo."

Keep in mind that usually when a franchise completely changes its genre, it succeeds only because their prior genre had become outdated/overused.

Borderlands,3df7ck,EQUASHNZRKUL,7,Wed Jul 15 22:15:46 2015 UTC,"My only request for BL3 is keep it co-op, but avoid it being an MMO. I'm perfectly happy just being able to play with a couple of friends, I don't need other people in my game. Also, I like having set classes.

Man, do you remember the cluster that Star Wars Galaxies was?"
Borderlands,3df7ck,LividWonk,3,Thu Jul 16 04:30:42 2015 UTC,Sorry dude.  I dont like the idea. The individual characters and specific skill trees is what got me hooked on this game.  The only thing i wish for borderlands 3 is that it has more vault hunters. I would like to see 8-10 characters and individual loot pools for online play.  Also maybe like lobbys for what ppl what to do online.  Like matchmaking for someone that wants to do raid bosses or specific side quests.  I guess I'm for pvp if they do it right but i don't see how you can balance pvp .  I mean they can go the Destiny route and have the iron banner which would be kinda cool i guess but a part of me just wants it to stay the way it is and just perfect it from everyrhing they learned from the 3 games.

The darts are homing, which is good for Gaige when she has some stacks of Anarchy accrued.  Zer0 and Maya can use their bullet-acceleration skills to make the darts seek more effectively.  The delay of a spiker's spikes let you switch to a Moxxi weapon in-hand before they detonate, so as to heal from the spike.  Also, the spikes inflict splash damage, so if you decorate a Nomad's shield with them, the Nomad will burn."

I called him ""Albarn"", and I designed him to be a rogue-type character whose action skill was to throw knives (aka a more spammable version of Zer0's Death Bl0ss0m). In the lore he was the estranged son of Moxxi and Mr. Shank, and he would steal from Jack's savings (offscreen) throughout the course of the game but then would realize at the end that Jack knew all along and was plotting to kill him for being a bandit. I never completely finished him, but here's his skill tree and COMs in case you wanna see."

Borderlands,3dc84c,Anorion,3,Wed Jul 15 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure I like the apparent focus on pet-skills, I'd rather see a skill that has some actual active usage. Sure the target painting of Wilhelm was nice as it at least required some active work but it was still just a single click of the button.  I would rather see some skills that alter the way the player shoots like the gunzerker or nisha, change the way you move like Zero or a complete transform like Krieg (some of Claptraps skills are nice but the whole sort-of-random system is not really what I want to see).  Maybe the next ""solider"" character could have a bunker down skill, where you for the duration of the skill you place a stationary variant of your weapon (more ammo, less recoil and allowing some cover and defenses) on the ground like a turret which you can ""enter"" to lay down the fire. Though I can see that skill not really working with the fast moving pace of the game.  Something else I've been thinking of is the addition of more than one skill per character, and not the melee-override way it is done before but rather more buttons to press besides the current layout (not sure how the consoles handle that though, sorry). That multiple skill layout would also go well with a change of the way cooldowns work, I'm not sure I truly like the extremely long cooldowns some characters have. It just makes the skill a harder use as you think you might need it for the next room, so have the cooldowns not go past 20-30 sec at most (or have the skills have a cancel function) and let the skills have less impact per use.  Having a siren with a couple different moves with all short cooldowns could be cool, give her some ""jedi"" moves such as pull and push. Maybe even a mindtrick ability to ""distract"" an enemy."

A Character with a skill tree designed to retrofit common (white) weapons, with a few skills in mind:  Retrofitter (1/1) - Boosts all stats on Common (White) weapons by 33%, adds a scope (manufacturer dependent), and changes the texture.  Technician (1/1) - All weapons that deal damage under the average damage of your currently equipped weapons receive a 50% boost to the damage and a 1.5x multiplier on their critical damage. Rocket Launchers DO NOT contribute to the average damage, but can still receive the bonuses.  Arsenal (1/1) - Gives you an extra 4 equip slots (diagonal on controller d-pads, double tap 1-4 on keyboards, can be rebound), How does he do it? the answer: yes.  Jury Rigger (Alternate name: Share the Love) (1/1) - Equipping a Common (White) weapon imbues a bonus to ALL of your equipped weapons depending on the manufacturer*, this also allows every other equipped weapon to benefit from the bonuses that benefit white weapons.  *The weapons will only benefit from the bonus of the most recent weapon equipped.

If the melee is less important and you're more interested in the feel of playing Krieg, then try shotgun Claptrap. He plays very aggressively, constantly trying to kill as fast as possible to keep his health up, and with the skills Start with a Bang and Livin' on the Edge he can create lots of explosions and visual chaos.

Borderlands,3dbxl6,buttsalt14,2,Wed Jul 15 02:01:04 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have the right idea, slag 'em and tag 'em. If you haven't already, you might want to go back to TVHM and pick up the Rubi (preferably a slag version) and then hop back into UVHM and try to get the Grog Nozzle if you have Tiny Tina's DLC. Either would help out tremendously."
Borderlands,3dbxl6,Dynamic_Des,2,Wed Jul 15 02:23:24 2015 UTC,I must have sold the Rubi once I got the Grog Nozzle because I don't have it in my inventory or in my bank. I've been using the Magic Missile + Bee + Sandhawk and that's been working pretty well.
Borderlands,3dbxl6,Awesome4some,2,Wed Jul 15 06:01:06 2015 UTC,"Alright first off, have you gone into bloodsoaked shields? That paired with cooking up trouble is amazing at keeping you healthy in fights with multiple enemies. Also you want to grab a Rubi or a Grognozzle if you have the DLC due to the amazing healing they have. Pangolin shields are also your best friend, huge capacity that gets instantly refilled as soon as you get a kill.   Movement is also key as Gaige, if you get trapped down a chokepoint then there is no way you can fight your way out - Anarchy by it's nature requires you to get up close and personal with your enemies too, so staying back and trying to score pickoffs is ineffective at best,  your best bet is to slag em and then bag em with a high damaging close range weapon - Jakobs shotguns are great at this especially if you manage to get up in their face. Bear in mind though, if you can't get it done in one shot you are royally fucked.  Discord is also great for taking out hard to reach enemies with a pistol or assault rifle and regenerating some health too.   You really always have to keep moving with gaige. If you stop, you will die."
Borderlands,3dbxl6,CriticalFaceTime,2,Wed Jul 15 04:40:08 2015 UTC,"I tried this and it's helped a lot so far. I'm using a fire Conference Call at level 50 which is working well so far now. I don't have the bloodsoaked shields and this is the first I'm hearing about them. I've been using the Bee which is good for when I first find enemies but the moment they shoot back I'm kinda screwed.   Never mind just looked it up bloodsoaked shields is a skill. I didn't have any points into that, it didn't sound like it would be very good to me in TVHM. Gonna move some points around for it."
Borderlands,3dbxl6,CriticalFaceTime,2,Wed Jul 15 06:03:36 2015 UTC,"Go back into TVHM, travel to Eridium Blight and do the sidequests for Mal (he stands by the entrance to Ore Chasm). At the end of the quests, he gives you the Fibber (make sure you get a ricochet Fibber with the redundant prefix). Using this weapon with Anarchy Gaige is almost like cheating, because you just need to shoot at the ground all the time and everything in range will die....and with this method you will gain anarchy stacks pretty fast, which will make everything die even faster. I could use my Lv. 50 Fibber without problems until almost Lv. 60."

I did the same kind of shit, came to the same conclusions, and even found a lot of things before he did.  He's not special, just someone like me who played a lot.  The difference is I didn't broadcast it because it's a fucking video game."

Borderlands 2 has a large story with more development and playing through Borderlands 1 to at least meet the NPCs and what not makes the second game more enjoyable.   Like in the beginning of the second game there is a specific ECHO recorder fetch quest, that two friends of mine did, it went over their heads and didn't quite understand what had happened due to not playing the first game."

You got your money's worth out of Unchained in there.  We saw some close calls in that video.  I'm going to go way out on a limb and posit that it's not at its best in FFYL against enemies at range.

Borderlands,3d8e7j,TomPheysey,17,Tue Jul 14 08:45:19 2015 UTC,"I'd personally most like to see Mister Torgue as as a playable character. He's built to be the Brick of a new game. I'd also like to see Sir Hammerlock as the Hunter/Assassin, Tiny Tina as the Explosives/Psycho, and if Angel wasn't dead then her as the Siren, maybe. It would've been interesting using Phase Shift as a mechanic to hack locked doors and other various electronics.  I was also toying with the idea of Proficiencies again, similar to BL1, but this time not with weapon classes, but manufacturers. Torgue is self-explanatory, Hammerlock would be partial to Jakobs weapons, Tina to Bandit, and Angel possibly partial to Hyperion, etc.  That's just me mucking about with ideas, though. I just really love Torgue's character. :P"
Borderlands,3d8e7j,dirtspp,4,Tue Jul 14 10:21:24 2015 UTC,That would be pretty cool but shouldn't Torgue focus on explosives instead of Tina? He does own a company that only makes explosive weapons and all he yells about is explosions.
Borderlands,3d8e7j,buttsalt14,3,Tue Jul 14 14:52:29 2015 UTC,"They're both known for explosives so the chances they would both be playable are slim. It would be like Roland and Axton being playable in the same game, or Zero and Mordecai."
Borderlands,3d8e7j,unkillable94,3,Tue Jul 14 18:11:02 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I was thinking along the lines of how Brick had the power of exploding fists in the first game and is a mountain of a man, similar in build to Torgue, and both their weapon specialties are explosive weapons.  For Tina I was thinking more like how she was lacking in the sanity department and has a love for creating homemade explosives (especially dynamite and rockets) and could probably play similar to Krieg when he's in his Light The Fuse state."
Borderlands,3d8e7j,dirtspp,2,Tue Jul 14 21:22:48 2015 UTC,Tina is also a bomb maker.
Borderlands,3d8e7j,woodchips24,2,Tue Jul 14 15:01:43 2015 UTC,I would love to play as that spoiler character :)
Borderlands,3d8e7j,sirfezman19,2,Tue Jul 14 15:27:47 2015 UTC,"I had the same exact idea for the characters, but add Scarlett to that list. It would then be all 4 title characters of each bl2 dlc. Torgue, Scarlett, Hammerlock, Tina. I think that would be a fantastic character roster. They could even add in Zed/Scooter/Marcus as dlc characters! So many possibilities."
Borderlands,3d8e7j,stormyrhapsody,2,Wed Jul 15 10:22:58 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing today, with the DLC Title characters! I think she would make a great character to play as. She definitely has a motive for being a Vault Hunter, what with the BL2 Vault Hunters making off with the Leviathan Treasure, and being a pirate captain I think her playstyle would be really cool. In fact, given her devious and cunning nature, I feel like she could be the Assassin/Hunter of the game and Hammerlock (with his gung-ho Teddy Roosevelt ""big stick"" routine) could be the Soldier. With Torgue as the Berserker, and Tina as a mini-Psycho.....man that sounds fun as hell. I'm already envisioning skill trees.  It would also set up an interesting game where a Siren isn't a playable character, setting up that ending of TPS for something big..."

Borderlands,3d8e7j,stormyrhapsody,13,Wed Jul 15 12:10:17 2015 UTC,Tbh i'd prefer all new vault hunters & keep Tina/Torgue as NPC's . Tina is just a vulnerable little kid in DK & Torgue comes across as all mouth/no balls kinda guy .

Borderlands,3d8e7j,woodchips24,4,Tue Jul 14 15:03:38 2015 UTC,"Captain Jared as: the Rogue  He refers to himself as a ""Space Privateer.""  Think Captain Jack Sparrow meets Captain Malcolm Reynolds.  He tries to be suave and charming; it doesn't always work.  He's after treasure and fame, but he also doesn't want to hurt the wrong people to get there (but he definitely doesn't consider anyone from ""the government"" the wrong people).  A man who gets by on his wits and instincts more than rigorous training or raw skill.  Action Skill:  Fire Support Captain Jared calls on his ship's helmsman (or AI, if we want to flavor it that way) to launch an attack on Jared's current position.  Fires three volleys in a wide area a certain distance in front of Captain Jared.  Enemies damaged by Fire Support are dazed - they move and fire at a slower rate.  (Maybe give them -Accuracy as well?  Would that affect NPCs at all?)  Skill trees:   Swashbuckler Focuses mainly on melee and mobility, with a little bit of health recovery. Key skills: Anywhere but Here:  Grants additional movement speed.  (+3% per skill point.) I'll See Myself Out:  Kill Skill - grants additional movement speed and health recovery.  (+5% movement speed/skill point, +2% health recovery/skill point.) Parry:  When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you gain  +damage reduction and you recover a percentage of your shields.  (Values to be determined empirically.) Riposte:  (Mid-tier game-changer.)  When you are hit by an enemy in close-combat, you hit them back with a slash from your saber!  This damage increases as you gain levels and gains the benefit of your +Melee Damage effects.  (Including bladed weapons, maybe?) Bring Me that Horizon!:  Gain extra money and ammo from pickups.  Gain a chance to get extra (eridium/whatever) whenever you pick up (eridium).  (Percentages to be determined empirically.) (No Capstone ideas yet.)  Ship's Captain Focuses mainly on his action skill and +grenade damage.  Offers some co-op benefits. Key skills: Get Off My Tail!:  When you are hit by an enemy attack, grants you +(4%/skill point) gun damage and +(5%/skill point) grenade damage for a few seconds. I Give the Orders Around Here:  Reduces cooldown of of your action skill by (3%/level) for you and your allies.  Also adds (1 volley/level) to Fire Support. A Tough Act to Follow:  (Capstone)  While Fire Support is on cooldown, you gain +25% grenade damage.  Additionally, any time you kill an enemy with explosive damage, you gain a stack of ""Fireworks Show,"" which grants you and your allies +3.5% fire rate and +2% damage reduction per stack.  (Maximum 10 stacks.)  Sidearm Slinger Focuses on pistols and ""trick shot"" mechanics, like bullet reflection and bonuses to crit. Key Skills: Let Me Take Another Crack:  (Kill skill)  When you kill an enemy, gives all your shots a (8% chance/level) to fire twice. I Can Still Hit That:  Gives your pistols a (15%/level) chance to ricochet off walls, floors, and other objects towards the nearest enemy.  (Damage of ricocheted shots:  75%) Fastest Gun in the Star System:  (Capstone)  When you switch weapons, your next shot will fire every bullet in the gun's magazine.  (Supposed to represent the ""quick draw"" demonstration, of guys drawing and emptying their entire pistol before a coin hits the ground, or whatever it is.  Might not be balanced, but that's the idea behind it - maybe you could tweak it to preserve the flavor without breaking the game.)"

Borderlands,3d5um1,AnalBumCovers,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:19:46 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty fun shield, powerful (and silly) on Gaige. My biggest complaint is that it's element locked. Would really have liked to see a Fire or Cryo Black Hole. Oh well though, still a decent shield."
Borderlands,3d6lkq,ffdgfdgfdgfdgdgdf,2,Mon Jul 13 22:45:32 2015 UTC,Relics come in grades of 1-15. So there are your odds.
Borderlands,3d6lkq,Warhawg01,3,Mon Jul 13 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"8 through 15.  However, I don't know if the distribution across this range is uniform."
Borderlands,3d6lkq,Daemmerung,2,Tue Jul 14 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"A casual survey of the relics I have stowed away on my various stash characters reveals that I have a grand total of two Rank 15 relics hoarded away, compared to the 10 rank 8's, 13 rank 9's, and 9 rank 11's.  Granted, small sample size is small, but a disparity an entire order of magnitude in scale suggests to me that grades 13, 14, and 15 are not equal in frequency to 8-12.  If I had to guess, I'd say a given (rare) relic probably has a 12.5% chance (or 1 in 8) to be rank 13+, and that ranks 13, 14, and 15 are each equal in chance.  (So, about a 4% chance for rank 15.)  I don't know for sure, though - I don't keep each and every single relic that's ever dropped for me.  -shrug-  Maybe all my 15's were tenacity relics and I just vendored them straight away."
Borderlands,3d6lkq,cannons_for_days,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:34:44 2015 UTC,Yep. You're right.
Borderlands,3d6lkq,Warhawg01,4,Tue Jul 14 02:57:08 2015 UTC,If you are farming the loot midgets in the Preserve. it should be raining ancient relics...they are really not rare...at least I don't think they are.
Borderlands,3d6lkq,CriticalFaceTime,2,Mon Jul 13 23:13:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on your level. At like, level 72 you should be seeing 60%+ cooldown reduction and +55% or so elemental damage."
Borderlands,3d6lkq,ScootaLewis,7,Mon Jul 13 22:49:21 2015 UTC,I have farmed hundreds of these and have never seen a cool down over 45% the one you described sounds great.
Borderlands,3d6lkq,AskACapperDOTcom,0,Tue Jul 14 00:14:36 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong. Just going by memory, I've farmed over a thousand loot midgets but I care so little about the relics that it's almost funny."
Borderlands,3d6lkq,ScootaLewis,3,Tue Jul 14 00:20:04 2015 UTC,Yeah you are incorrect I have formed hundreds/thousands and I've never seen one even near that high. It's my main relic for my soldier class so I'm always on the lookout. I imagine a top out at 50% cool down and 45% elemental. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure I would've seen a higher one than the ones I've gotten.
Borderlands,3d6lkq,AskACapperDOTcom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:33:36 2015 UTC,"I have a few at OP8 and they're capping at about 45 cooldown 40 elemental iirc, haven't seen any higher. Then again the lv26 sheriff's badge I use was better than my OP8 one so relics are just whack."

Borderlands,3d6xjx,PUNTS_BABIES,2,Tue Jul 14 12:19:30 2015 UTC,"Yea that's what i had in mind, it would have to be balanced"
Borderlands,3d6xjx,PUNTS_BABIES,2,Tue Jul 14 14:04:24 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely. Part of borderlands is the farming aspect (which is actually enjoyable compared to some games) and they can't lose that. Otherwise it loses some replay ability.
Borderlands,3d6xjx,nathanj0872,2,Tue Jul 14 14:17:53 2015 UTC,"A while ago I would have said that would never happen, but creative director Paul Hellquist did leave Gearbox.  Maybe they'll decide that there is a game after having perfect gear, and the alternative is people cheating to get it anyway.  I still doubt that there will be weapon crafting though."
Borderlands,3d6xjx,bigew,2,Tue Jul 14 03:26:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe it could be a little more balanced with it having to be the same gun, so there is still a bit of farming to do but it wont mean that it has to go on forever."
Borderlands,3d6xjx,Venusaurus_Rex,2,Tue Jul 14 18:27:09 2015 UTC,"or make a classifieds section where other players can trade parts from the same weapon. if it is too easy, it would discourage the community aspect."

Borderlands,3d6xjx,Snakeoilsage,2,Tue Jul 14 01:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as someone who doesn't play coop, the game is already pretty hard to solo.

I have 2 friends who won't do UHVM with me now because they did every single side quest and DLC in both playthroughs and say they don't want to do it a third time.  So I'd say at the very least don't do everything on your first playthrough.    As for worrying about being overleveled for UHVM,  don't.  It's fairly hard no matter what level you start at."
Borderlands,3d4u81,Flyers789,8,Mon Jul 13 15:45:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'll just aim to do everything in this play through then and see how I feel about UVHM when I get there. I'm ok with repetition, I've played over 1000 hours in destiny! Haha"

I have almost 1100 hours and haven't completed this week's Nightfall on any of my characters. it feels weird but in a good way. Now I just need more friends on Borderlands. lol
Borderlands,3d4u81,profanitymyass,10,Mon Jul 13 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"TVHM only scales up to 50 but in UVHM you don't have to worry, it scales up to your level. So even if you're 72 the enemies will be too.   I would just start TVHM and do all the side quests+DLC there to get a good experience. I'm severely overleveled and just started TVHM.. and it's really dull. I one shot everything and basically force myself through the storyline to get to UVHM."
Borderlands,3d4u81,Semigloss01010001,3,Mon Jul 13 15:18:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply, so if I do all the side missions and DLC in TVHM will I be way past level 50 by the end of it? The thing with UVHM scaling when I finally get there will be if I'm over levelled I'll be fighting enemies at my level but with level 50 guns I get from TVHM"
Borderlands,3d4u81,profanitymyass,2,Mon Jul 13 15:28:01 2015 UTC,Do the story missions and dlc missions that don't have quest rewards you might need for uvhm. Popular items are rubi/grog nozzle pimpernel law/order love thumper really depends on your class and build but you get the idea.   Save those for after you beat the warrior so they will all scale to lvl 50 so you can get a jump start on uvhm. Those first few levels of uvhm can be brutal so having those key pieces can really make it a smooth transition.   Don't even accept the quests with gear you want until after killing the warrior or else they won't scale.  You really want to kill the warrior at 50 so you have on level gear to start uvhm. After beating the warrior xp gain is gutted so you wont have to worry about leveling while getting the quest rewards you saved. Hope that helps
Borderlands,3d4u81,OGNick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:43 2015 UTC,If you're on PS4 I can hook you up with some Level 50 gear for your character. That should last you until ~60. That way you don't have to do a boring grind several times.. because if you grind for hours on 50 you have to do it again on 61 and 72 and so on.
Borderlands,3d4u81,OGNick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"I'm on Xbox, thanks for the offer tho, would have been great!"
Borderlands,3d4u81,Drumbas,3,Mon Jul 13 20:44:51 2015 UTC,"You want to be exactly level 50 when you finish the story in TVHM.  Since TVHM caps at level 50 (enemy levels and loot levels), if you do every side quest and DLC, you can end up being around level 55-56, maybe higher if you did some farming.  Then, you will enter UVHM at level 55-56, and all enemies will be your level, badasses a couple levels higher, and bosses 3 levels higher...and you will have level 50 gear max from TVHM.  This will be very difficult unless you are specced well and have perfect gear.  This will also help with the repetition of doing all the side quests 3-4 times to get to max level.  My recommendation is to burn through the main story as fast as you can, using on level side quests to keep you on the leveling track, and then get in to UVHM.  There, you can literally do whatever you want.  All enemies and missions scale to your level at all times (mission rewards are locked to the level you accepted it at, so don't accept a mission and then save it for later)  If you get to max level and decide you want a mission reward that you already received, reset UVHM and start over.  One thing I like to do in UVHM is to kill the TMNT rats a bunch along with Flinter.  They each give over 5k XP and are easy to get to and also a chance to get the storm front, my favorite grenade.  I also kill the snowman in the Christmas headhunter.  He gives about 20k XP and his chest is good for gear.  This lets me gain level quickly and get good gear doing it."
Borderlands,3d4u81,Drumbas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:24:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot that's a great post, this is what I'm going to try, burn through and get to UVHM. The only DLC I want to play right now is the torgue one to try and grab an unkempt Harold, am I right in thinking if I do this now I can then just keep grabbing higher level Harold's from the vending machine, or is it too much of a grind getting tokens to worry about now?"

Borderlands,3d2hzd,_darkwingduck_,0,Mon Jul 13 03:06:26 2015 UTC,"I can't see how you like Salvador but then hate Gaige.  I did Salvador as my 1st class when BL2 was released and got bored by like level 25, because I essentially had god mode, infinite ammo, double the DPS of any other class at the time which ultimately made it very dull to play.  I only recently tried Borderlands 2 again and now have 2 characters at level 42 (Zero/Gaige). Both are a blast to play.  Zero as the most rewarding character in the game because you require precise aim and a lot of awareness to do well with him.  Gaige, because despite the fact she can become OP as hell with 400+ stacks, she is still squishy compared to Salvador and if you ever lose those stacks in a battle, you are going to have a challenge going forward and earning them back while not going down.  I can also get really creative with how I kill enemies with Gaige, Salvador is just plain the most boring and OP character in this game.  I just cant see how you call out Gaige for being easy and then claim Salvador is your boy. Maybe this changes in UVHM/OP, but the only thing I see is even higher risk for gaige to die (Especially with DT becoming less and less useful) and Salvador staying as easy and overpowered as ever.    Edit: And yes, this is your opinion.. But I can't see how you came to the conclusion that you did."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,Advanced-,3,Mon Jul 13 22:14:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't say Salvador was challenging to play, just that I find him enjoyable (particularly for raiding).  Also people not understanding how others come to their point of view is essentially the formula for differing opinions yeah? Would be a boring world if we all thought exactly the same thing. Anyway Sal isn't my favourite class by a long shot, I find Zero the most fun/challenging to use at higher levels and I think Krieg may have the most interesting design. Gaige isn't all that squishy either, if you have blood soaked shields maxed out it's nearly impossible to go down if you just keep shooting... Also you can be incredibly creative with your gun combinations on Sal. If you stop rocking DPUH + grog for 2 seconds you might even find some."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,_darkwingduck_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:28:09 2015 UTC,"Gaige isn't all that squishy either, if you have blood soaked shields maxed out it's nearly impossible to go down if you just keep shooting...   In solo play, I'll agree.   In a 4 player co-op session? The amount of kills you are able to get is much lower since there are 3 other people shooting things, as such I find it pretty challenging keeping her up at various points of the game. The amount of times I need some kills and my friend keep taking them out before me is, well, often.  She is definitely more squishy then salvador and get punished much more so for deaths then salv as well."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,Advanced-,2,Tue Jul 14 00:33:03 2015 UTC,I'm assuming solo play as the topic at hand. Obviously the game is different in co-op of any level - eg: Maya increases in value exponentially in a group.
Borderlands,3d2hzd,_darkwingduck_,4,Tue Jul 14 00:52:09 2015 UTC,Gaige. I just find the voice lines heard by other players a bit annoying and they also seem to be like 2x the volume then everyone else
Borderlands,3d2hzd,ProfessorEpic,11,Mon Jul 13 00:38:36 2015 UTC,"That's what I loved about Gaige. The more Anarchy you get, the louder she yells. I thought it was a little funny."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,buttsalt14,10,Mon Jul 13 01:57:01 2015 UTC,"Zer0.  I get that it's one of the hardest characters to play and can be effective, but I don't care for the playstyle and I hate his background and dialogue.  Every line is a stupid haiku and his background is edgier than the Nu Metal section of a music store."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,nathanj0872,3,Mon Jul 13 06:32:16 2015 UTC,upvote for the nu metal line.
Borderlands,3d2hzd,pmdu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:26:05 2015 UTC,Wait he has a background?
Borderlands,3d2hzd,rf32797,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:20:28 2015 UTC,You can find his ECHO logs scattered around Sawtooth Cauldron.
Borderlands,3d2hzd,Xyanite,5,Mon Jul 13 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"Krieg. He's fun for a while, but I find he gets really old. Yeah yeah, meat, killing, blah blah blah. Plus I like being able to see the game, and Krieg's two playstyles are just constant visual pollution."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,Jatsala,2,Mon Jul 13 04:17:59 2015 UTC,"Krieg and Zer0.  Aside from Brick and, to an extent, Athena, I can't play melee classes.  That mixed with my shoddy aim and my controller's tendency to read the right stick tilting to the right ever so slightly throws Zer0 out the window unless I keep sniping to a minimum and launches Krieg out the window like a Fastball grenade."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,TrainerBlack2,2,Mon Jul 13 02:39:07 2015 UTC,Gaige.  She literally requires no skill to be good at.
Borderlands,3d2hzd,RoadRunnerdn,2,Mon Jul 13 15:29:55 2015 UTC,Zer0 is boring to play but I like his character and quotes the best. Maya is my favourite to play and 3rd fav char/quotes.
Borderlands,3d2hzd,RoastyMacToasty,3,Mon Jul 13 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"Axton. I can hold my ground with any other character, easy. But this guy has a whole skill tree that turns him into a weeping bitch, makes him dependent on his turret to kill things while he cries in a corner in the relative safety of cover. I've respecced him close to eight times, and so far about the one thing he has going for him is his turret looks a whole lot more awesome than Roland's."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,LividWonk,2,Mon Jul 13 01:38:03 2015 UTC,It's easy to fall into the trap of letting the turret do all the work if you're running a Guerrilla build (I certainly did when I first played him). imo the other two trees are better for learning how to play Axton well because of that.
Borderlands,3d2hzd,brandpanz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:47:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, very much so. I finally found a median in Gunpowder and Survival mostly, but even after all that, he plays like a cut down Salvador, or a third-rate Zer0. It was worth getting him to 50 so all the badass points could drive up all of my stats 13%, but I never play him."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,LividWonk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:39:33 2015 UTC,"I main Axton, and imo while he isn't as powerful as Sal or Zer0, he definitely has his advantages. He can hold aggro longer than Zer0 can, he can be tanky at OP8 with nearly any shield and without needing life steal, and he can mob with only grenades. Plus he also has Grit which is one of the best skills in the game."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,brandpanz,2,Mon Jul 13 06:17:12 2015 UTC,"No shit? I normally main Salvador, so not being able to enter a face-off slugfest with a super loader kinda skews my judgement. That being said, the nuke at turret deploy deal is absolutely hilarious.  You mind me pretty much sniffing you down for some build tips?"

Borderlands,3d2hzd,meccaryn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:30:27 2015 UTC,"Zer0. Got all characters into the OP's (ok, except Sal because I mostly play co-op with people who main him) but with him I've never managed to get far over lvl 50. He has some great skills but the haikus are just getting on my nerves so much after playing him a while."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,shoggy88,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:06:39 2015 UTC,"I love them all dearly, but my LEAST favorite has to be Zero, and no one from the pre-sequel (the characters in that game are amazing).  anyways, i dont like Zer0 because he is just...boring? When i play with my friends, everyone helps out everyone except Zer0, he is quite selfish. I guess that also applies with Nisha too, but i liked her."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,Willark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:57:00 2015 UTC,"This is kinda weird but I find Zer0 great for co-op play. His Deception decoy absorbs aggro and makes it easy to revive teammates, killing blow makes any boss trivial once they're under 1/3 health and Death Blossom with Death Mark makes enemies take 1.8x damage from all sources. I would actually place him 2nd for team synergy, after Maya of course."

Borderlands,3d2hzd,Fuegofucker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:46:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't like Zer0, or Salvador. My favorite was Maya, where I didn't mind Axton. I played Gaige and she was cool, and Kreig gets boring sometimes."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,viviminx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:54:43 2015 UTC,Axton is my least favorite character as I only use him for his turret. The turret does the damage and slags the enemy so that my teammates can do more damage while I just stand there and watch. If I really needed to slag an enemy then I will just play as Maya.
Borderlands,3d2hzd,x3VILVisionaryx,0,Mon Jul 13 05:05:14 2015 UTC,"Maya, both in character and in gameplay. Chain Reaction and Sweet Release are cool but aside from that she really doesn't interest me that much. It also doesn't help that SMGs, arguably her best weapon type, happen to be my least favorite. I've never really liked her character and background story either, especially ever since TPS came out: character-wise she just feels like an inferior version of Athena."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,brandpanz,5,Mon Jul 13 01:33:26 2015 UTC,"See, I loved her magic-flavored crowd control. Singularities to another dimension? Yes please.  Converge + Ruin is amazing for melting entire mobs of enemies."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,ParanoidDrone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"Ruin stops being good for killing in UVHM. It's still the best slagger in the game though.  Singularities don't really interest me too much tbh, and I can already achieve the stun effect with Nuke."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,brandpanz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"Most Maya players (like myself) never use ruin for anything but slag. In fact, I usually don't spec into ruin until after I have scorn because I just don't need it until uvhm. Slag isn't that useful in normal and tvhm."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,IcyNova115,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"You don't need slag pre-UVHM but using it will still up your overall DPS by a lot, and considering how reliant Maya is on Phaselock, you get that extra damage boost a ton of the time. Cataclysm is the most popular Maya skill tree bar none, even amongst OP8 players."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,brandpanz,0,Tue Jul 14 02:29:58 2015 UTC,Axton. The playstyle is so boring to me. I can't stand how at op8 his only damage comes form explosives and tediore guns. I've gotten every other character to op8 but him because it just makes my eyes figuratively bleed when I play as him.
Borderlands,3d2hzd,IcyNova115,2,Mon Jul 13 04:58:16 2015 UTC,"Try a Hornet, Twister or any non-Bandit Plasma Caster on him then. They all get grenade damage."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,brandpanz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:15:28 2015 UTC,Try a Hornet... gets grenade damage   What the shit. How and why?
Borderlands,3d2hzd,Ultra-Bad-Poker-Face,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:41:56 2015 UTC,Because BL2 is weird in what gets grenade damage and what doesn't. In general if the weapon has splash damage and can crit then it gets grenade damage (Maliwan snipers save for the Volcano and Storm are the big exception though).
Borderlands,3d2hzd,brandpanz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:02:47 2015 UTC,"It's not the gear that I'm lacking form Axton. It's the fun-factor. All of the other characters have at least 2-3 different things about their action skills & skill tree combinations that make them faceroll everything in their paths. With Axton, I find myself in gunfights that have are completely vanilla in that hisskill trees don't affect the way he fights people at all. What I mean by this is all of the other characters have something in their trees that make fighting unique. With Axton, fighting is ONLY gun on gun with throwing a grenade more frequently than most other characters would be inclined to do."
Borderlands,3d2hzd,IcyNova115,2,Tue Jul 14 02:07:36 2015 UTC,"That's pretty subjective imo. For me, Nuke and Longbow Turret are both skills that I find myself missing greatly whenever I'm playing as someone else, and the ability to health gate just by standing around and doing nothing is pretty amazing in itself. His individual skills might not be particularly gamechanging but their amazing synergy with each other really makes the character for me. By comparison, as much as I love Gaige's character, her skill tree in general reeks of bad design choices, and Deathtrap and Anarchy feel boring and tedious to utilize."

Borderlands,3d256h,maydaybomber,18,Sun Jul 12 22:29:23 2015 UTC,The holodome is useful if you're under leveled for a mission and need to grind and level up. And the clap tactic voyage is actually really fun. I loved it. The final boss can be a serious bitch though
Borderlands,3d256h,ProdigyLightshow,6,Sun Jul 12 22:31:35 2015 UTC,"I struggled against the second form of the Claptastic boss as Wilhelm. My main issue was actually running out of ammo, of all things. (Those digistruct boxes take FOREVER to build and then go away so you can get more ammo.) Eventually I went into FFYL too often and died basically instantly. No bueno. The whole attempt took me a solid 30 minutes, too.  Paid a visit to the Concordia chest, specced into Overdrive, prepped with shock and corrosive snipers. (And a bitchin' purple Hyperion shotgun. Love those things.) Went down first try in 5-10 minutes.  I'm mostly annoyed that unless you already know what kind of fight it'll be, it's hard to be adequately prepared for it. First time through I didn't have any good shock weapons so its shield was a pain in the ass to take down. THEN IT REGENERATES TWICE THROUGHOUT THE FIGHT.  On the bright side, it dropped a Cryophobia for me, which I'll be keeping in reserve for my Aurelia after I outgrow it."
Borderlands,3d256h,ParanoidDrone,6,Mon Jul 13 02:52:33 2015 UTC,"The final boss can be a serious bitch though   I feel like that's not enough to describe that bitch assed bullsit fucking cockblasting shitgobbling oversized mechanical japanese toilet, with a flashlight and mirror on the inside of the bowl so you can get a look at what he really is, which is to say an asshole.

Makes grinding for legs a little easier, and you get to hear Gaige and Axton narrate the story for a little. Doesn't really add much overall. Wouldn't get it.  Claptastic Voyage gives you at least a good 4+ hours of questing. It also gives you an arena once you finish the main questline. You also get access to a whole new type of gun, and the legendary loot pool gets expanded by quite a bit.  Also, as others have said, the final boss is a real bitch. Give it a couple years and it'll be on some website's 'Top 10 Hardest Bosses in Gaming' list, or some shit. Mark my words."

Borderlands,3d59tg,neogreenlantern,4,Mon Jul 13 21:31:50 2015 UTC,"If you don't like the ""New-U are not cannot"" answer then here is a theory. The Hyperion New-U stations were dependent on being powered by a Siren. The reason why the BL2 hunters kept being brought back is due to Jack needing them up to the point where sabotages Sanctuary. After that Angel decides to turn on him so she keeps bring them back under her own free will. This brings us to the point where they kill Angel. At this point no one is running the New-U stations so when Jack kills Roland there is no one to bring him back. Jack then kidnaps Lilith and plugs her into the same mainframe that Angel was in so she is now controlling the New-U stations. Then you free her and she kills Jack at a point where the New-U stations are offline again."

Borderlands,3d59tg,neogreenlantern,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:42:01 2015 UTC,Tldr: They need a siren to control the new-u. When Roland and Jack die there is no sirens connected to the new-u mainframe so they don't comeback.
Borderlands,3d59tg,lpscharen,3,Wed Jul 15 14:21:03 2015 UTC,"I know that the New-U stations are not canon, but this would be if there are.

Borderlands,3d59tg,Daemmerung,4,Tue Jul 14 18:53:14 2015 UTC,His digistruct plans were being delivered by a Claptrap and there was a set of stairs en route.
Borderlands,3d59tg,cannons_for_days,3,Mon Jul 13 17:28:39 2015 UTC,"The design philosophy of Borderlands is such that you are expected to die a few times throughout the game and get respawned.  The terrain in BL2 is just littered with respawn points like weeds in a garden, and there's always a respawn point just before a boss.  The gameplay itself is telling us that death in this world is not permanent. Having said that, the events of the game also make it clear that death is permanent.  Jack's hysterics over killing Angel must mean that the New-U machines can't save her.  Same for Roland.  So the game is giving us conflicting information, and we need to resolve this, somehow. It's important to remember that Borderlands 1 and Borderlands 2 are stories being told to us by Marcus.  We know Marcus is a merchant, and a rather ruthless one at that, so he's probably not a terribly reliable narrator.  So either he's gotten some of the facts wrong, or he's embellishing the story somehow.   a)  Money and Technology are the two most important things in Marcus' life.  Maybe the New-U stations are some fictitious device he's using to explain how powerful the Vault Hunters are in a way that makes sense to him.  (Because it can't just be the case that these people are badasses because they're skilled.  That would mean they don't really need his guns!)  b)  Maybe Marcus doesn't explain why the New-U stations don't work on any of the characters who die ""for reals"" because he doesn't know how they work.  (He's describing them as Hyperion tech, after all.)  c)  Maybe Marcus isn't a very good story teller.  Maybe he added the New-U stations early in the story because he thought they sounded cool, and when he got to the part where people actually started dying he just didn't think about the plot hole he'd set up.  You, as the player and the audience, are free to decide which of these explanations works best for you.  Anthony Burch (the head writer for BL2) has sort of said it's explanation a.  Personally, I think it's mostly explanation c, since that's sort of what's really happened with the game.  (They wanted a respawn mechanic, but then they forgot that said respawn mechanic cheapens death in this world when they wanted a ""grim, serious"" story where main characters die.)"

There's typically one per map and that's the closest one (I think, I haven't played BL2 in a while). It's definitely a trek, but you'll just have to run back to Flynt."

There you should see DLC1 to 4 and all of them should have folders and files in them. If yes then i dont know whats wrong but if not then you should verify the game data in steam by right-clicking on the game, selecting properties, going to the local files-tab and clicking ""Verify integrity of game cache"".

Borderlands,3d2jzx,BlameTheJungler,3,Mon Jul 13 00:35:43 2015 UTC,"You're asking if anything can compare to Lilith with an Anarchy?  Sure.  Built/and properly, Mordecai with a Masher or Brick with anything explosive (especially the Ogre, Hammer, and several different launchers) can kill stuff as fast or faster, although you'll eventually reach the point where the difference is effectively negligible.  What you have to understand is that Borderlands is a game that gets progressively easier as you progress through it, to the point that by endgame there are very few things that really present any sort of challenge.  There isn't really an overpowered character or skill because by the end of the game everybody is horrifically overpowered."
Borderlands,3d2jzx,Volcanicrage,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:29:27 2015 UTC,"I actually found the reverse effect for Brick+Launchers - as they can't crit and the hitbox for actually hitting people with rockets in BL1 seems buggy as fk compared to BL2.  I did use a Hammer that I got in the earlygame sometime around lv20 - it seemed to perform well for the longest time, but when I got to Knoxx - in terms of DPS I felt that an Anarchy does better than a Hammer even though I had specced into bonus explosive damage etc - probably due to fire rate and reload speed being better on an Anarchy.  However your suggestion of using Mordecai and Mashers is interesting - I can see that being fun."
Borderlands,3d2jzx,Volcanicrage,2,Mon Jul 13 01:43:48 2015 UTC,"You have to run a Blast Master build to really get the most out of Brick's damage output- its all about the kill skills.  With the right launchers, you can clear groups faster than anybody (my roommate swears by his Destructor with the ""Spread"" prefix)."
Borderlands,3d2jzx,Volcanicrage,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:22:50 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah of course he can clean trashy mobs really easily and I really enjoyed rocketeering for a long time especially since I had my friend running a soldier's ammo team regen.  It feels as if though that some enemies are highly resistant to rockets - like for example Drifters and those mech suit looking enemies that General Knoxx himself uses. And Bruisers seem to take minimal damage from rockets too.  I have a Nidhogg with about 1100 or so damage on the item card its pretty insane.  However, I felt that having bonus % Fire Rate from skills was really good/OP - so I went and played Lilith and was like ""holy shit quicksilver skill OP"" - since its very close to Blast Master but you don't even need to get kills. ( was running a class mod with +3 in it to make up for the 7% per skill point as opposed to Blast Master's 12%)"
Borderlands,3d2jzx,NaturalPanic,2,Mon Jul 13 05:49:28 2015 UTC,"It balances out.  I normally run co-op as Lilith with a Brick player, and they're fairly equal, but if Brick can get his momentum up he does hit a bit harder.  90% damage on top of 108% RoF isn't really something anybody can quite match.  Some enemies are resistant, although Knox is mostly just a pile of damage resistance in general.  Rockets are mostly a mobbing thing, they don't have the DPS for single-target sustained damage."

Also if you're knocked back off the arena by a random mook, no matter how much damage you've dealt, the fact that the boss restores all their health is way too big of a punishment considering that having just one player would stop that from happening. It's way too harsh for something like that.  It should be the other way around where if a friend dies in multiplayer the boss restores health to punish you for not being able to save your friends."
Borderlands,3d3fzl,LuckyNumbrSe7en,2,Mon Jul 13 21:36:59 2015 UTC,"Well, the point of the bosses is to be a little unfair or difficult. If it's a raid boss (Terra, Craw, Dragons, etc.) then it's supposed to require multiple people. Otherwise, just do some grinding until you can handle it solo. Solo fights usually provide you with baddies to get Second Wind off of.   To counter your point, it'd be silly if every time my trolling teammates jumped off a cliff to give the boss some more health. Just my $.02 though!"
Borderlands,3d3fzl,LuckyNumbrSe7en,0,Mon Jul 13 22:34:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about raid bosses, I mean a normal boss that you encounter in the story.  The issue isn't that it's too difficult, it's that you're literally punished for not playing with a second person."
Borderlands,3d3fzl,NaturalPanic,2,Mon Jul 13 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"If you're having enough trouble to where you can't beat a solo boss, you should either be grinding out some side quests to get to the correct level or adopt a new strategy or maybe find some better guns. Flynt, Wilhelm,  Saturn, Jack, Warrior, etc. should all be beatable by yourself."

Borderlands,3d0hx3,NoxTheWizard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:55:56 2015 UTC,"You get the Grog Nozzle as a quest weapon from The Beard Makes The Man, in the Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep DLC.   It has very low damage, but the main draw is   piercing shots with high slag chance extreme healing effect from damage you deal while it's in your hands (around 50%?) occassionally makes you ""drunk"" for a few seconds, which reduces fire rate but makes any gun fire like a shotgun spread (at no extra ammo cost afaik)   You only have it as long as you're in a playthrough where the quest has not been turned in. If you have the quest open while joining a friend who has turned it in, the Grog Nozzle will vanish until you leave that game session.  Using it will let you slag almost anything within two shots, and throwing a grenade can heal you to full almost instantly. The drunk effect lets you slag and then kill enemies very quickly."

I find myself using Krieg more, though. If you like pet classes and shy away from melee, Gaige might be a better pick for you. Her anarchy tree is incredible."
Borderlands,3cy6x3,soydemexico,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:37:36 2015 UTC,"Gaige was a lot more relaxing, after a little while of playing you'd Max out your anarchy and be able to obliterate pretty much everything if you were close enough. Krieg was a lot more exciting, but also a bit more stressful."
Borderlands,3cy6x3,AOhls14,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:10:45 2015 UTC,"If you like melee or flaming explosions, Krieg. I have no idea about Gaige, never played her, but I main Krieg and it's always a fun time, at a certain point he becomes practically invincible."
Borderlands,3cy6x3,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"Make one of each, see what you like more. I love both of them equally, but Kreig is the one that I have put the most time into. I finally got all the achievements on my 360 with him. I'd say it's just personal opinion"
Borderlands,3cy6x3,jakejellis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"Yes!  Both demand very specific play styles. I loved playing as Gaige so I could use Anarchy and BFF. But I found that Krieg, after 15-sh no longer was a squishy Axton but rather was a badass shotgunner of awesomeness. Kriege made it to 65 before I completed UVHM and I just could not bring myself to grind to 72, but only because TPS went on sale.  Aurelia is much cooler than her bitchy reputation suggests. But she is certainly not a nice person...."
Borderlands,3cy6x3,ReverendEarthwormJim,0,Mon Jul 13 02:29:09 2015 UTC,depends on what your play style...Gage is more of a stay back and send in the bot while you provide fire support. Krieg is more shotgun and melee going to fight for your life (light the fuse) alot. so if ya like fast pace with melee krieg is your guy if not I suggest Gage. Now my favorite ir Krieg because fire breathing
Borderlands,3cy6x3,StremeSpoats,6,Sat Jul 11 21:51:57 2015 UTC,"If you go down the BFF tree, maybe Gaige plays more as support for Deathtrap. Try speccing into anarchy especially with close enough and then shoot people point blank with shotguns and she's way more fun."
Borderlands,3cy6x3,Sir_Randy_Butternubs,-2,Sat Jul 11 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"Gaige. Krieg is fun for a little while, but the ability to kill anything by just thinking about it just gets old after a while."

Borderlands,3cy6x3,DeluxeLeggi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:57:25 2015 UTC,Then don't shamfleet. Just because Gaige is the best shamfleeter in the game doesn't mean you have to do it.
Borderlands,3cy6x3,Jatsala,2,Mon Jul 13 02:22:03 2015 UTC,The entire thread is about comparing Gaige and Krieg so I used Gaige as my example
Borderlands,3d0czj,Pathfinder4K,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:49:13 2015 UTC,"I know there's a way to disable the auto say in Cheat Engine, don't remember exactly how. Something about searching for the say string then setting the value to null? Does anyone more familiar with CE know how to do this?"
Borderlands,3d0czj,AmericanFromAsia,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:39:51 2015 UTC,"I've tried it out now and was able to use commands. I used the information from http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Borderlands_PC_Tweaks  There is a section about ""Show/Hide Console Window"". To summarize you need to edit the .ini-file like you did, then edit the ""Engine.u""-file with a Hex-Editor and then apply patch to prevent the game from checking the ""Engine.u""-file for modifications.  The commands I know of are ""togglehud"" and ""stat fps"".  If you find a list or know additional commands I'd be happy to hear them. I'm specifically looking for some kind of NoClip/Godmode that allows me to fly. I've already lowered the gravity, but I need a steady height to create the screenshots I want."
Borderlands,3d1ecm,Jayux,2,Sun Jul 12 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"I was in the same situation as you, I am new to the game and the price plus reviews were great so I took the plunge. You need to stick with it as it does get better with some time invested. The story of course if not explained so much yet, I am still a bit in the dark, but going around fighting, gaining experience, perks, finding all sorts of weapons and killing high experience enemies is very rewarding. So to answer some of your concerns: the shield works like most FPS games (halo especially) you have a shield that depletes, and once its depleted, then your main health will start taking damage. So keep the shields up (they recharge over time) I am not worrying about understanding all the stats just yet, but getting good balance is important for how you like to play. So if you want damage, find a high damage weapon, but remember that it will probably be slow to reload. Just think of it as your usual FPS, but with that RPG/diabloesque looting mechanic. Good luck sir."
Borderlands,3d1ecm,therise03,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:08:00 2015 UTC,"Zero (the assassin class you chose) can be really frustrating to begin with, especially if you don't get lucky with loot. My main tips would be: 1) use your nades: the default grenade mod you get with the handsome collection is so overpowered it's unreal 2) As you're not far in maybe chose a different class if you want to get a feel for the game with a more well rounded character like the commando, mechromancer or gunzerker 3) Watch some youtube videos or search through the history on this subreddit to find some other top tips  EDIT: sorry my formatting game is weak"
Borderlands,3d1ecm,ollie-kennedy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"I am a lvl35 Mechro and I still get stuck on something's so don't worry about knowing everything. Also, starting the game is very slow and seems boring but it will get better. Because you don't have any abilities or skill points, the game is simply call of duty with guns that do different things. Take your time and read what the gun does (usually very self explanatory). Lastly, find a play style that works for you and just do that. Once you get a feel for the game then start to change it up."
Borderlands,3d1ecm,xGr1m,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:20:19 2015 UTC,"I would recommend, as you're still early on, changing class. Commando is pretty much your average FPS character, I'd recommend that or Gunzerker, as zerker gets OP as fuck."
Borderlands,3d1ecm,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,3,Sun Jul 12 19:27:03 2015 UTC,Thanks I'll give it a try. I've always been attracted to Assassins and Snipers but this class seems really weak early on in the game.
Borderlands,3d1ecm,Awesome4some,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:28:11 2015 UTC,"He is really frustrating unless you know what you're doing with him. Especially Sniper Zer0. Most of the time you would be correct in assuming that plugging away at heads is the right way to go, but you hit a brick wall really fast due to your inherent frailty and lack of escape outside of deception. I would love for you to pull off a Sniper Zer0 on your first play through, but it's probably not going to happen."
Borderlands,3d1ecm,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:55:51 2015 UTC,"Same happened to me, I main a Psycho now and love it. A change of class may be just what you need."
Borderlands,3d1ecm,CriticalFaceTime,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"Zer0 is an amazing and the most rewarding character, but unfortunately not for beginners. I think I would recommend you to choose Gaige or Axton to get into this game and learn the basics. It's up to you of course."
Borderlands,3d1ecm,paulinaaaaa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:45:58 2015 UTC,"Gaige and Axton are great because you get a buddy to help ease the learning curve. I did Gaige as a first character, and now that I know what I'm doing, I'm working on a Maya.  Also, it helps to learn the elements. For example, Flynt engulfs himself in flames, negating fire attacks and reducing regular attacks. So, attack him when he isn't on fire. When you get to Sanctuary (in about two to three story missions), you meet Marcus and get a mission that explains all the elements and enemies' weaknesses.  Keep with it! :)"
Borderlands,3d1ecm,Fuegofucker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:49:05 2015 UTC,Zero is dumb weak in the early stages of the game. You will die a lot. I really recommend putting points into bloodshed and trying to get a slag weapon to take on flynt.  If it's too hard try to do it co op. Flynt is pretty hard alone if you don't know what your doing.

Borderlands,3cw4nb,MrWill-,46,Sat Jul 11 07:16:39 2015 UTC,"It was a combination of Dahl's mining operations and the changing seasons. Dahl had reasons to believe that there were valuable minerals on Pandora, sending millions of employees to the unknown planet. They gathered laborer a, scientists, families, Dahl executives. At first the planet seemed to be relatively serene, but a couple years later, after Dahl really hadn't found anything of interest other than some passive crystal-covered animals, all the hostile, Pandorian wildlife that we know so well began to wake up out of hibernation. Bloodshed began to rain on Pandora and the Dahl execs pulled out, leaving behind everyone else, leaving Pandora as we know it today."

Borderlands,3cw4nb,Exipha,3,Sun Jul 12 15:49:08 2015 UTC,"Just about, at least in Borderlands 1. Tannis is an example of being a former employee under Dahl and being left behind. Clearly she has gone insane over her time alone on Pandora.   Then when Atlas essentially fell out of Pandora leaving behind any remaining Crimson Lance soldiers, most joined Roland forming the Crimson Raiders while others turned to being Bandits.   So basically.. the corporations in Borderlands are not only fucked up individuals but are responsible for just about all bandits on Pandora."
Borderlands,3cw4nb,Seytai,2,Mon Jul 13 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"I see that a touch somewhat darker. In BL1, you're shown the Crimson Lance having no trouble beating down the local wildlife, pacifying bandits, eliminating local psychos, you name it. You're shown a large collection of already established bases and equipment in select locations that are fit for a planetary invasion. In the last few levels of the game before the vault, you're shown a small handful of landed orbital pods capable of only carrying personnel, maybe a small few boxes of supplies. It really looks like Commandant Steele was dropped in system from another location to take command of Atlas forces already on planet.  To make matters worse, unlike the Lost Legion, the Crimson Lance has no numerical designation. This means they're not only a division of some larger troop base. We can assume the Lance is on damn near every planet with a population, be it a largely settled core world or a handful of dust held together by gravity on the frontier. But they work everywhere to protect Atlas assets...regardless of those assets honestly belonging to Atlas.  My theory from all this is really frightening: Atlas never pulled out. They had the first vault, they were the ones who got to the very top of the industrial/commercial dogpile by reverse-engineering alien weirdness. I'm pretty sure most corporations only plodded along after them to buy licensing from Atlas in order to manufacture all sorts of other goodies. Odds are good the whole story we've seen in Borderlands is an infinitesimally small slice of just how crazy things got with that first vault. We can assume, possibly correctly, that all of human expansion in the game came about due to Atlas also unlocking a map of potential vaults just like in the end of BL2.  So Atlas stayed on Pandora long enough to establish a network of bunkers and firebases, leave behind a custodial maintenance crew and a large military presence with orders to operate from the shadows until time to strike. We can also assume that every single world with a potential vault has a large compliment of Lance troopers waiting for the right moment to muscle anyone else out of the way.  Steele used the troops and assets at her disposal to completely wrack Pandora with chaos. Think about the bandits watching Fyrestone. What the shit do they care a couple of settlers do? She cuts out the Echonet itself in a later mission, but not until long after the Fast Travel network is also mysteriously downed, you guessed it, by bandits. Steele hired those bandits and several other camps like Mussolini's blackshirts, to keep an eye on anyone capable of dissenting, organizing, or forming a resistance. Those capable of fighting back were killed outright. She used bandits to route the population from Old Haven, armed the living hell out of them with weapons purchased bulk from Torgue, a clever move to dispel evidence implicating Atlas, and sent these same fools to collect the vault key fragments. She paved the way for a massive potential Atlas invasion with staggering consequences. You know, keep in mind that Steele herself is a siren. That itself is terrifying; It means Atlas is seriously so large and unstoppable that the company has no trouble farming out Sirens to open their vaults.  We can also take a more jaundiced look at Dahl pulling out from all this. Either Atlas stayed and waited for someone else to do the work for them in finding the vault, or a managed and observed Dahl leased an occupying directorship of Pandora where they stumbled upon Eridan madness and called in Tannis and unsuspectingly did the work for Atlas anyway. We can expect things suddenly being dangerous as shit as only a supporting reason for Dahl to hit the ""Screw This"" button and bail, the larger reason may most likely be Atlas putting a crapton of pressure on Dahl to GTFO so Atlas could secure their position as the premier dealer of reverse-engineered alien foolerly. There are a number of things to support how vital Tannis was in all this; From Marcus asking where she gets her supplies as she's been in the wilderness forever and never requests so much as a glass of water, to her own personal Echos detailing how she woke up untouched--outside in a land heaving with starving, homicidal creeping things.   We seriously hold only the barest sliver of a story set in a reality where backhanded shady corporate dealings and interplanetary economic warfare barrel straight into screwy alien technological marvels.  *Edit: I suck at teh shpellin g. ...and I somehow clipped that end paragraph when I posted..."
Borderlands,3cw4nb,LividWonk,2,Mon Jul 13 05:05:29 2015 UTC,"I surprisingly read this all. As such my brain only nick-picks at certain things and might completely ignore something important. Basically though you are saying you think Atlas hasn't left entirely?   I like the idea of Atlas hanging back and potentially watching what unravels after their departure. Even if it isn't true, it's something I would expect a leading corporation to do. Especially one who can afford doing so when they have forces on other planets. Even the wiki suggests that Atlas has ""galactic supremacy"" elsewhere and that wouldn't surprise me. It'd be cool to see them return to Pandora after seeing Hyperion basically fall for the time being.   This all gets me all giddy like a fanboy now because I love Atlas corporation.  The Crimson Lance and the Assassins looked awesome, the guns were great and compared to Hyperion and maybe Jakobs (Zombie DLC) Atlas isn't inherently terrible. That contradicts what I said previously when I said they are terrible individuals but I think Atlas is just less so than the others."
Borderlands,3cw4nb,Seytai,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:29:56 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. Atlas had to be there. There's no other reason Tannis was safe and cared for like a pet, or simply captured and not executed outright. There's no other way they knew so much about all the creepy stuff planetside if they weren't carefully observing forever. I can definitely get behind what you're saying on how they were great. They were a metric crapton more difficult and better organized that Dahl or Hyperion forces. They used their training, had tactics, and that evil looking red stormtrooper armor...  We're certainly going to see them again. If BL3 takes place on any other world, my money says they'll be inundated with Atlas personnel."

Borderlands,3cyg4o,dirtspp,-6,Sat Jul 11 23:12:27 2015 UTC,"Save all those valuable keys up for when you're higher-level. Whatever you unlock from the chest with the keys will scale up to your level, so it's best to keep them until you're at least level 50 or have reached that level; you're supposed to enjoy rare weapons and shields late into the game, so unlocking a chest at level 15 is just a waste of keys and good loot. Not only that, but if you're higher level, you can sell whatever you don't want in the chest for much more money.    TL;DR: DON'T, I repeat, DON'T use your keys now until you're at least level 50 or so, because you'll probably need that Double Penetrating Unkempt Harold or Bee in the chest for when you're gonna fight Terramorphous after beating the game."

Borderlands,3cxk6u,TheSpyIsHere,2,Sat Jul 11 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"Go to the main title screen.  Hit whichever button to Select Character (think its Y on Xbox).  It will give you the option of all of the play-through modes you have unlocked.  Now if you haven't completed the original play-through, TVHM won't be unlocked yet."

Borderlands,3cxk6u,KingJonathan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:33:44 2015 UTC,"Wow. In the wildlife preserve right now, and it is SO much harder! But I love the challenge! Can't wait to do UVHM!"
Borderlands,3cvxou,orangemofo,9,Sat Jul 11 05:45:44 2015 UTC,Up to a point. Once you get past a certain point (like 50) it just becomes about what you don't skill rather than what you do skill.
Borderlands,3cvxou,Wasabi_kitty,13,Sat Jul 11 07:00:45 2015 UTC,"MOAR!!!1!!  Seriously, every point you get makes you stronger, and makes getting loot easier.  More is more in a game like Borderlands so yeah, more skill points is always a good thing."
Borderlands,3cvxou,Nightcaste,3,Sat Jul 11 06:15:27 2015 UTC,Good point. While running through the game you definately want more points as its much more difficult to actually get to max level then it is once you're there.
Borderlands,3cvxou,likwidstylez,3,Sat Jul 11 06:45:34 2015 UTC,Disagree. The last 10 points in TPS were complete overkill due to the way that they changed the Tier 4 requirements. It killed build diversity as now everyone can just get all 3 capstones. Made the game really boring to me.
Borderlands,3cvxou,ParanoidDrone,2,Sat Jul 11 12:41:24 2015 UTC,"You can only get all 3 capstone skills if you take as few skills as possible on the way. If you want 5 skills in one tree, plus game changer and capstone, you can't do a perfect spread anymore.  It's still a lot of points though."
Borderlands,3cvxou,CriticalFaceTime,0,Sat Jul 11 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"The ability to get all 3 capstones in insane! Probably makes mobbing really boring, nothing to focus on."
Borderlands,3cvxou,branden3710,6,Sat Jul 11 13:21:53 2015 UTC,"I think the extra points make some major difference. For example, if you play melee Zer0, the extra points can give you all the best skills to benefit your build. You can spec out the bloodshed tree and the cunning tree for the kunais and still have juuust enough skill points to spec out sniping for b0re. Considering that the difficulty is way harder past lv. 50, I think it's great."
Borderlands,3cvxou,BlechBOX,3,Sat Jul 11 10:01:00 2015 UTC,Im definately on the same page as you. Zero earns every skill he could possibly need at level 72.
Borderlands,3cvxou,Glen_Emeraude,2,Sat Jul 11 13:17:54 2015 UTC,"I think a level 50 distribution is good for a level 50 character, but I also believe that a 72 distribution is very good for a level 72 character.  If the level cap was permanently 50, one capstone and a minor gamechanger is just enough to farm TVHM ""endgame"". But when you add UVHM and 22 more levels, then you need skill points to match in order for the game to still feel organic.  People complain that the game was broken by these skillpoints fucking over Axton and buffing Salvador, but in reality Salv could pull the same money shot chain at level 50 as 72"
Borderlands,3cvxou,Draconilian,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:06:40 2015 UTC,"Good point, and I agree. You do need more points on the higher difficulties as of now. I just wish the balance was smarter."

Borderlands,3cs70c,BlameTheJungler,15,Fri Jul 10 22:10:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with all six of these. This would be useful for a new player, hope it gets added to the FAQ."
Borderlands,3cs70c,DCNx,11,Fri Jul 10 10:13:26 2015 UTC,"A little footnote from an Axton main. I have found Axton to be one of the most rewarding characters to play as (currently OP 8). Mainly because when you beat someone you truly feel like you deserve to beat them! It requires thought (not just blasting away with money shot lol), planning, and execution. I'm constantly changing up my gear depending on the situation. It makes the game a lot of fun :)"
Borderlands,3cs70c,BlameTheJungler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:04:09 2015 UTC,"That is - unless one is spamming rockets as axton like I was - totally ruined the game for myself all the way up to lv63 or so to which I stopped playing axton because it was ""too easy"" xD"

Borderlands,3cs70c,smartbycomparison,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:30:55 2015 UTC,"I might have a spare x4 magic missile but it might only be lv35 though, I haven't booted up BL2 in a while since I've gone back to BL1 to try to 100% it.  I think I ruined BL2 for myself by powerleveling all my characters to lv50 or above - and by doing a few other things."
Borderlands,3cs70c,blackmarketdolphins,6,Sat Jul 11 01:47:56 2015 UTC,"I find it a lot harder to play the characters in the second game. There are long range characters, close range characters, medium range characters, but nothing that can phase between all of them.   The first game, you had Roland that phased between Short, Medium and Long range combat, specialising in the medium to long range combat, but weaker in the close combat.  On the other hand, Siren can go short, medium and long, but excels in the short and medium range.   EDIT: Putting the range specialisation in the post might make choices easier for newer players. Could even become a full on FAQ :D"
Borderlands,3cs70c,MRRoberts,3,Fri Jul 10 13:51:35 2015 UTC,"I could see this addition being handy for new players, but instead of just range, put their ""basic"" or ""preferred"" play style.  For example, with Salvador while gunzerking you need to be close to medium because his accuracy while gunzerking is limited. With Krieg's action skill you also need to be close because he will primarily being doing melee attacks for damage"
Borderlands,3cs70c,wingsday1,2,Fri Jul 10 14:19:55 2015 UTC,"Zero and Maya have no issue playing all ranges, unless you spec melee. Cunning Zero can use any weapon, and with Velocity his bullets reach further than they normally would. For instance, you can hit OMGWTF from the New-U Station with a Sandhawk, when it normally would phase out."
Borderlands,3cs70c,brandpanz,2,Fri Jul 10 15:37:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my loadouts on Zer0 usually consisted of a pistol of some sort, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle or two."
Borderlands,3cs70c,wingsday1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:48:25 2015 UTC,Will do.
Borderlands,3cs70c,wingsday1,4,Fri Jul 10 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"So I have a number of issues with the OP:  -You have the rapier in the sniper section for Zer0  -you have the florentine for maya. I feel phisical pain everytime someone says that is a good weapon for her, she already has an absurd amount of slag in her kit, why would you gimp your damage by using a slag weapon? the florentine is for Gaige, Krieg, and mabye Sal.  -the only explosive weapon you have listed for Krieg is the kerblaster, while you have the DPUH listed for everyone else. Krieg is lileraly the best user of the DPUH, not to mention the carnage, ogre, swordsplosion, etc.  -we don't talk about buck up, it's a terrible skill  -deathtrap can carry you through the OP8 peak, he is really great  -you didn't mention the HoT on gaige  -you didn't mention torgue/jakobs shotguns on gaige  -you didnt mention the ogre on gaige  -you didn't mention anything on gaige that is not boring as hell to use"
Borderlands,3cs70c,AustereSpoon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:26:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say remove Axton from the Florentine list; its splash damage is slag which is stupid, and turret/grenades are better for slag/shield stripping anyway."

Borderlands,3cs70c,Edadinasni,4,Fri Jul 10 10:07:50 2015 UTC,"So if I want to play solo, and eventually be able to do the raid bosses and other end game stuff (never really made it that far before, have recently been playing a bunch more) I need to play Sal instead of Maya?"
Borderlands,3cs70c,Eternity42Immensity,4,Fri Jul 10 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"Salvador would make it easier, however I mainly play Maya and evenue though raidbosses are fairly difficult, they are in no way impossible. I'd just stick with Maya."
Borderlands,3cs70c,TheMFDrez,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:31:53 2015 UTC,"Am I going to just die constantly? The main issue so far is that if you cannot phase lock something, you cannot get many of the bonuses from phase locking, which really sucks. I had a bitch of a time killing the badassasaurus. Sweet release just doesnt seem to do much healing. Am I destined to be super fragile always?"
Borderlands,3cs70c,DarkHeroAxel,2,Fri Jul 10 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"The badassasaurus was a bitch of a boss, with stupid attacks and bullet reflection. Don't let that be an indication of Maya however. I''ve maxed my Maya to level 72 and currently barely go into ffyl. I have sweet release and elated for healing and that's it. Mayas phaselocking becomes super useful for slagging which allows you to tear through areas and gain health all the time pretty much (due to low cooldown). So to answer your question, no you won't be fragile but instead quite the opposite."
Borderlands,3cs70c,Awesome4some,3,Fri Jul 10 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"IMO Krieg doesn't play too well with others.  A little bit of synergy with 1 player is nice, but with 3 other people, getting enough kills to stay healthy is tougher.  Enemy health, kill-stealing, etc. become big drawbacks for melee builds on 4-player.  Some bosses are also tougher for him without very specific builds.  Oh, and the whole health-scaling thing can become a problem at op8 for tankier builds.  Just thought I'd mention a few things about Krieg that might fall under ""cons."""
Borderlands,3cs70c,DarkHeroAxel,2,Fri Jul 10 16:40:54 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! Your points have been added.

Borderlands,3cs70c,Forty-Three,3,Fri Jul 10 17:35:29 2015 UTC,"Be sure not to invest in Deathtrap's ""Buck Up"" skill, ~50% of the time he will either try to heal an enemy shield or try to heal the shield of a player currently in FFYL status..."
Borderlands,3cs70c,TallCowsFly,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yep. That's why I got rid of it. Too often I would enter FFYL, and he would turn around and zap me instead of helping me kill that badass in front of me"
Borderlands,3cs70c,blackmarketdolphins,3,Sat Jul 11 13:13:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, I have a question perhaps you can help me.  I've had BL2 and all its DLC (except cosmetics) since they came out, but I've only put serious time into Axton.  I'm currently playing UVHM of TPS, but I got the humble bundle for my son.  I reinstalled BL1 myself and after about 15 minutes it left me feeling that it was horribly dated.  The strafing bothers me too much having played the later titles.  So I think my son and I will start with BL2.  He's what I'd call a novice with FPS, mainly sticking with TF2.  What would be a good class combo for us to play together?  Basically something easy for him to get ahold of and enjoy, and a good support role for me.   Thanks so much!"
Borderlands,3cs70c,BlechBOX,3,Fri Jul 10 21:25:41 2015 UTC,"I would probably say Gaige is the most user friendly. Her Anarchy makes her inaccurate and do more damage per stack but she has a passive skill that makes shots ricochet back at targets when you miss, so basically if he's not really precise, he can still get away with the skill proccing and still dealing damage (it deals less damage than direct shots but anarchy more than makes up for that). Anarchy has the added benefit too of being useful if they don't know how to tactical reload or almost never does it because that's exactly what anarchy wants you to do.  Otherwise I'd probably say Kreig, Salvador, or even Axton to a degree would be other good choices due to their fairly straight forward playstyles at least early on."
Borderlands,3cs70c,Madomb01,2,Sat Jul 11 01:39:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think Krieg is terribly noob friendly though, Axton is much better for newer players due to his straightforward nature. He's a well rounded class. Krieg is... Odd. Incredibly fun, but difficult to get the hang of."
Borderlands,3cs70c,ppeettaauugghh66,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:30:40 2015 UTC,"Well most of my playtime with Krieg that I remember was just running around meleeing things, so I was kind of going off of that."
Borderlands,3cs70c,TrainerBlack2,3,Sat Jul 11 11:32:15 2015 UTC,"Great list, but a couple notes/corrections:  Bladed grog nozzle is great for melee Zero, but you should also mention evisceration slag Rubi, as it's a viable non-DLC alternative throughout even UVHM.   And at high levels, you should not use bladed weapons like bladed grog nozzle (except Rapier) as Kreig, as even the Law results in a lowered melee bonus after around level 50, since weapon melee bonuses overwrite some of Kreig's natural melee damage scaling."
Borderlands,3cs70c,Jatsala,2,Fri Jul 10 22:11:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for this! Your points have been added.
Borderlands,3cs70c,jimskog99,6,Sat Jul 11 04:04:50 2015 UTC,You shouldn't promote Pimp-Habbing. It's an exploit. It's like recommending the Rising Shot glitch to people learning Zero.
Borderlands,3cs70c,TwitchyUncleC,3,Fri Jul 10 15:41:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it has been removed."
Borderlands,3cs70c,CriticalFaceTime,2,Fri Jul 10 15:52:45 2015 UTC,"What is ""Pimp-Habbing""?"
Borderlands,3cs70c,CriticalFaceTime,5,Fri Jul 10 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"Using Sal with an Ahab and a slag Pimpernel you can deal insane amounts of damage by gunzerking with your Ahab in your right hand and Pimpernel in the left. By putting as many points into Money Shot as possible with class mods and running out of ammo for the Ahab you can deal about ~900% extra damage with the Pimpernel. This bonus can be increased  further with an appropriate relic. Using a slag variant Pimpernel also allows you to do triple damage to the explosive damage on UVHM. There are other bonuses that get added over to the Pimpernel but I won't go over that.  At OP8 you can hit over 1 trillion damage per shot with the Pimpernel pretty regularly at critical points.   EDIT: /u/blackmarketdolphins replied to the comment below me with some better info, look there. I forgot the most important reason why the Pimpernel does so much damage. Each Pimpernel pellet does Ahab damage, which dramatically increases damage."

Borderlands,3cs70c,demonatarms,5,Fri Jul 10 21:42:36 2015 UTC,"The reason it does so much damage is because the Pimpernel's pellets do Ahab damage, which has the highest single hit damage in the game. So it's all that damage x5, plus slag, Money Shot, etc."
Borderlands,3cs70c,AJockeysBallsack,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:52:08 2015 UTC,Agreed.

Borderlands,3cs70c,theultimatespikodge,2,Sat Jul 11 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"A few tips for Gaige:   Weapons with spread aren't too affected by Anarchy's loss of accuracy, making weapons with fixed spread/patterns (Unkempt Harold, Blockhead, Heart Breaker) maintain accuracy at range with Anarchy. The Florentine is good for a build centering on her Little Big Trouble skill tree (centered around shock damage).  Mixing Anarchy and Close Enough can make Gaige's aim a bit... polarizing.  As in ""you could miss someone at point blank with a shotgun only for shots to rebound off the wall in front of you to hit an enemy on high ground behind you"" polarizing."

Borderlands,3cs70c,theultimatespikodge,2,Sat Jul 11 04:06:21 2015 UTC,"Overall I think you have a very solid list here, but I do have a few disagreements.   I don't think that Zer0's sniping build is at all weak at higher levels, in fact it's one of the strongest in the game. Saying that it suffers without proper gear and without CA management is pretty obvious, as well as being the case for every character. Sal sucks without proper gear and skill management, same goes for Krieg.  I would also hesitate to say that Axton has a hard time on higher levels. You are right when you say that he has a harder time than the others, but he's a monster on OP8.  But like I said, this is overall a really good list."

Borderlands,3cuwgm,DaRk_INCOG,4,Fri Jul 10 23:45:55 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're definitely worth it. UVHM is frustrating at first, I won't lie, but once you get the hang of it,thats where the REAL(for me at least) game starts. I feel like the game begins to play more like an RPG because of how gear dependent you become. You can't just pick up anything and it'll do, suddenly you have to take you character, skills, and gear into account to make it all work. It IS hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's so much more fun and rewarding."
Borderlands,3cuwgm,soheyhai,5,Sat Jul 11 07:44:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that you NEED it...but to be honest, since I adapted to the difficulty of UVHM I really hate NOT playing in UVHM.

Borderlands,3cuwgm,CriticalFaceTime,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:45:33 2015 UTC,"No. Because UVHM will only feel significantly more difficult if you're starting it the first time. If you managed to get to lv. 72 on UVHM, then you definitely won't have problems with the difficulty anymore."
Borderlands,3cuwgm,Jatsala,2,Sat Jul 11 09:54:39 2015 UTC,"They are, but be warned that they are tough. UVHM isn't so bad, but OP8 is not designed to be fair. You can master them with enough dedication though."
Borderlands,3cuwgm,welcome2thejam,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:57:32 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're worth it, but it'd depend on what you want out of the game. You might find yourself bored without anything to do at lvl. 50, since you won't get any new missions. On the other hand, you might consider having to run through the entire storyline again and again even more boring.  Personally, I went with just the first UVHM pack, to just lvl. 61. It does kinda suck that there's not as many players there, since most people either stick to lvl. 50 or go all the way to the OP levels, but I found it to be the best balance between having stuff to do and not having to keep farming equipment and repeating missions, plus enough skill points to play around with in builds."

There's no shortage of them, so feel free to use em' up, they're not as important and useful as you think, especially not in TPS since the Grinder is a goldmine for strong weapons. Most times you'll be using 2-5 at a time before you find something super useful since it's a random between being 2-3 guns, or 3 shields, or 3 class mods- and most times you end up getting class mods you can't even use for the character.   Check out Orcz (TPS, 2) for codes, they keep them updated for when they run out/expire. Red text means it's unusable and both PS and Xbox platforms share codes."

It's only problem is the existence of the Bekah, which makes the Hammer Buster look like a top-class green in comparison.  In TPS, Hammer II is pretty good from what I've heard.

It blends the right amount of comedy and unique storytelling (in both games, Borderlands 2 and The Pre Sequel) into an action packed shoot and loot world, where there are basically infinite amounts of guns. Say you get a pistol, that pistol is basically unlike any other one you will find! Each weapon has different parts that make it distinctly different from other weapons, from different sights, barrels, grips, and even elemental effects. All of the weapons   vary by Manufacturers, so you could find two guns with the same parts, but if their manufacturer is different, the entire gun's playstyle can be changed!

Borderlands,3cr31e,Drumbas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:05:11 2015 UTC,"Pearlescents are extremely rare, the only decent ways to get them are loot midget farming and Digistruct Peak at OP8.  Fortunately, if you look at the top loadouts, pearlescents won't be showing up in any of them.  The Butcher is pretty good though, especially if you get the practicable prefix.    TL:DR since if you're not even farming for guns yet you probably don't know what a lot of that means:  yes pearlescents are extremely rare, the Butcher is one of the best pearlescents but not as good as a lot of legendaries."

At lower levels, even larger enemies like Saturn and the Warrior take multiple shots to wear you down...so even if you get your health above half...if they rapidly hit you with two good shots, you are down.  If only one of their shots was enough to drop you, you would be fine...but one shot probably wouldn't be enough in which case the health gate wouldn't be in effect.  Basically...health gate doesn't really work in normal mode, and isn't super reliable in tvhm either."

I really want to play gaige in bl2, anyone have some build tips?  In TPS I enjoyed Nisha but I'm having a ton of fun with Aurelia. Freeze everything! I love sniper rifles as well so she's a great fit for my playstyle. I just need to find a friend to play with so I can try the servant tree."
Borderlands,3cofcx,I_am_Hoban,3,Thu Jul 9 15:45:40 2015 UTC,"For Gaige, you want to go Anarchy and then Close Enough, as soon as possible.  Blood-soaked Shields and Fancy Mathematics really help survivability, and they're pretty early unlocks too. She likes SMGs, assault rifles, and shotguns....basically anything that either shoots a lot of bullets very quickly, or a spray of bullets with every shot.  Some of the most fun I've ever had in a FPS has been with Anarchy Gaige. You quickly forget you even have a reload button, and there's nothing as satisfying as running into a bandit camp with 200+ stacks of anarchy, firing wildly at whatever and having everything drop dead around you."

Then mid-late in her tree I put a single point in Anarchy and it opened up whole new play styles.    I'm currently lvl 38 and haven't started TVHM yet. With a level 28 ricochet Fibber and 34 Bee shield, I can wreck house before I even get a good number of anarchy points. To say nothing of my now-faster reloads and missed Fibber (or other wildly-aimed projectiles from 150 Anarchy stacks) bouncing back to hit enemies."

Get the mag down to one shot. Since you get an Anarchy stack when your clip empties, that's a stack for every shot, plus another when you get a kill, which will be every 1-3 shots. Also, you'll never have to worry about accidentally reloading prematurely because you'll never have a partially used mag. Not to mention that Close Enough works amazing with shotguns."

Bahroo on YT has a great build that looks pretty OP, but I'm currently using her, and with Close Enough and Anarchy it gets fun.

Borderlands,3cofcx,LeHarryBastard,48,Thu Jul 9 16:36:53 2015 UTC,Once you figure out how to use Zero he's the most rewarding.  Like when you're really into it with him you've got that bead of mental sweat going.  He can be really frustrating to use at first but once you get him down he destroys everything.
Borderlands,3cofcx,shamus4mwcrew,18,Thu Jul 9 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I made the mistake of using my skill points on his sniping tree, but the bloodshed tree is where it's at. Of course by level 72 you can max out both, but at a certain point you can run through an entire area one shotting enemies while being invisible the entire time. It's pretty great, especially since you can throw funnai and other grenades while in stealth mode.  Also his quotes are badass."
Borderlands,3cofcx,rf32797,16,Thu Jul 9 15:04:13 2015 UTC,"I personally find Sniping Zero to be the most satisfying build in any of the Borderlands games. It gets ridiculously frustrating if you're trying to do it solo in UVHM, but Christ on a bike is it satisfying to kill Jack with one shot."

Borderlands,3cofcx,rf32797,3,Thu Jul 9 15:14:49 2015 UTC,"Yes..? I'm assuming you mean the Raid Bosses, and I've only ever done them solo and even then just barely as a sniper zero, but yes I do get all of the drops."

Borderlands,3cofcx,rf32797,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:40:33 2015 UTC,Can you post your skill tree? That sounds awesome
Borderlands,3cofcx,FatFriar,2,Thu Jul 9 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"I can when I get home, but really it's all about that Critical Ascensci0n. You have got to keep up your stacks, this can be really hard, but a solid example? In the warrior fight when he's under the lava, shoot the Crystalisks. Your stacks start to decay after thirty seconds, so if you can keep track of it, shoot a crystalisk just before the stacks start to go. You really have to think about positioning as well,  solo you will get bumrushed the second you fire a shot, so think about how you want to funnel the enemies for easy head shots. Look for chokepoints. Use decepti0n to guarantee a kill on a tougher target (always with one shot) or to get out of tougher situations. The skill that gives you health regen in decepti0n is your best friend here. Grab a magic missile too from the tiny Tina dlc and as you think you're ready to start emptying your mag toss one out to get easy slag. Invest points into the reload speed skills, the kill skill and the passive in the Sniping tree as will allow you to reload after every shot and make the most out of one shot one kill.   There is no such thing as thinking too much as a sniper Zer0. You are not sal, if mobs get to you, you are probably going to die. Position yourself well and make sure you always have an escape route. Good luck"

All my pals told me this was the first game they ever saw where I was a playable character. That kinda troubled me, but I could pick up all the movie references he shouted out while 'zerking.  You're absolutely right about unstoppable badass. There were numerous times I carried the fight on Sal with a friend on Zero ten levels higher than I was."
Borderlands,3cofcx,LividWonk,22,Thu Jul 9 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to play any other character now having put so many hours into Krieg the Psycho, he's just so insanely fun. You really get into his character, and once the explosions/blood clears you feel slightly disappointed the fights over. Of course, most raid bosses and Hammerlock's DLC are pretty tough for Krieg."
Borderlands,3cofcx,DIDLIESTWARIOR,3,Thu Jul 9 23:55:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the hammerlock DLC, but other than the dragons the rain bosses can be anywhere from not so bad to very easy.

Borderlands,3cofcx,Pandas_panic,11,Thu Jul 9 16:16:55 2015 UTC,KRIEG!!! It's a shame that so many players have not experienced how much addictive fun Release the Beast and Bloodsplosion are. He should have been released as one of the initial characters in BL2 and not as a DLC.
Borderlands,3cofcx,tearlock,9,Thu Jul 9 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"Gearbox argued that they couldn't release him in the vanilla game because his play style is just ""too different"", which kind of makes sense.  Playing as him not as your first character is much more rewarding."

Borderlands,3cofcx,DirtyLemonz,7,Fri Jul 10 00:43:53 2015 UTC,I really loved playing as Mordecai.  The combo of sniper rifles and revolvers coupled with a sword and bloodwing made him a super fun character to play.
Borderlands,3cofcx,CJIA,5,Thu Jul 9 15:45:50 2015 UTC,Too hard to pick one for me so i'll pick one from each hame. For 1 I pick Brick. I got an explosive artifact for his skill and just stun locked enemies to death. For 2 I'd say Gaige because her dialoge and backstory are my favorite. For TPS i choose jack because tossing grenades out like comfetti and never having to reload is amazing.
Borderlands,3cofcx,Muffinofrage,3,Thu Jul 9 15:57:21 2015 UTC,Does Bloodwing count as a playable character?
Borderlands,3cofcx,Lunatic721,6,Thu Jul 9 16:40:36 2015 UTC,"Borderlands 1, I'd have to say Brick.  Lilith's fun, Mordecai's cool, and Roland's pretty helpful in a group game (Medic tree, anyone?), but Brick is, by far, my favorite.  It also helps that Brick is the only melee-focused character in the series that I can play as for any length of time.  Borderlands 2:  Gaige.  Sal's fun, but Gaige is, in my eyes, the undisputed queen of damage.  She's also the first character I played as back when I first started the series.  (Yes, I played 2 before 1.  My brother picked up 2 on a whim because he heard it was cool.)  And, of course, Deathtrap bailed me out of many a sticky situation.  In TPS, Claptrap.  Yes, he's annoying to listen to (though thankfully not as annoying as he is in 1), and yes, his action skill annoys the piss out of people in co-op.  But that's half the damn fun.  The other half is blowing everything to bits with a few well-placed hits from a Torgue shotgun."

At the same time, Krieg has a really fun skill as well and some great lines.   I'd probably say Roland overall though, his ammo regen is ridiculous. I've tried other characters in BL1 but I have to pick up ammo and realize how much I miss his infinite ammo pool."
Borderlands,3cofcx,unkillable94,3,Thu Jul 9 21:31:13 2015 UTC,Athena was a nice mix of badassedness and cute. I hope we see more of her in the future.  Not to mention bloodrush chains were super fun to pull off.

Hearing conversations between yourself and having hugely overpowered builds to work with (like infinite ammo and free second winds) make him hella fun to play as.

But out of the 3, I would have to say Athena is definitely my favorite character to play as.  She easily combines 3 of my favorite things: Melee, shotguns, and the feeling of immortality. I love the tankiness that her shield gives, but I also like the fact I can melee and shoot while using it (although going full melee berserk is cool too). Flying around and quickly closing in on enemies with her blood rush skill and then blasting their face with a shotgun blast is the greatest feeling in the world."

I loved her skill in general, it helped with literally everything. Partnered with my co-op Axton, it was perfect with his turrets, along with singularity grenades. I loved her story, and her personality, and her way of being a compassionate woman, but also a woman that don't take any shit.  Sorry for long post ,but I love everything about her honestly."

Borderlands,3cou81,Justinreinsma,3,Thu Jul 9 16:05:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Pete has one of the biggest HP pools in the game. You should not expect this fight to take any shorter than a few minutes, unless you are doing something like Beehawking or you are praying to the Money Shot Gods.  Make sure you are using a Shock gun, that will greatly help. Other than that, using a Bee will always speed up the fight quite a bit. Keep Pete slagged as much as possible, and use a Trespasser (sniper rifle) to knock off Pete's helmet right when you start the fight so you can crit him.  What specifically is your gear? Most guns should work, but some are obviously more effective than others."
Borderlands,3cou81,Zaaptastic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:22:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I've tried farming before but to no avail, all the legendaries I get are low leveled drops I get on new characters ;_;. As of now I'm using the conference call, the slag pompernel sniper (the one that bursts into a lot of different balls, not sure if pompernel is the name), a dp unkempt harald and I have a moxie gun to gain health back by doing the weapon switch thing. My shield is some crappy purple because I've never had the patience to farm a bee, and my 6 hours with the bunker never turned out any shams. My grenade is not very good either, but it is the legendary that explodes into a shit ton of other little grenades. As you can see, my gear isn't the greatest. I'm planning on just sitting down and farming for a while though, but I'm not sure what weapons to go for. On a side note, If there is any dlc mission that I can get useful weapons from I'd like to know.  Thanks"
Borderlands,3cou81,iiLeech,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"If you have Tiny Tina DLC, go to the forest and then there is about 4 treant spawns, you should get a bee quick. As for weapon? The Sandhawk is good, thats from a quest in Cpt Scarlett's DLC about halfway through as a main mission reward. If you need help I can help on PC to kill him and to farm, only problem is the stuff will be high level drops."

Borderlands,3cmd7j,HypNoEnigma,4,Thu Jul 9 01:00:54 2015 UTC,I wouldn't start farming until UVHM. You can probably farm for a few top weapons/shield every 5 levels without spending too much time. If you're really having trouble farm more frequently. Also the infinity is really overrated. There are much better guns for a Maya build: I would start here http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/top-gear-for-maya-the-siren/46185

Borderlands,3cmd7j,Semigloss01010001,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:05:00 2015 UTC,Honestly I would just wait until after killing the warrior in tvhm and farm some pieces for the beginning of uvhm which is the hardest imo. And then a couple of times throughout uvhm to keep them up to date. Bitch bee and pimpernel/lyudia and a dpuh were all I needed.
Borderlands,3ckwen,brandpanz,8,Wed Jul 8 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"Great against EOS and other enemies with large hitboxes (not in BL1 though since large enemies are generally immune to splash), less useful in other situations. MOLMF did a video on it a couple days ago (with Axton, yay!), and I pretty much agree with his assessment of it.  Also, in BL2 and TPS the child rockets are always explosive, which is helpful if you're playing Krieg or Claptrap but less so if you're trying to maximize its potential with a Bone of the Ancients."
Borderlands,3ckwen,ThePugmanJJ,2,Wed Jul 8 18:40:33 2015 UTC,I had to farm the grinder for one just to make the EOS fight doable. Better for long distance bosses with big crit spots than any other launcher IMHO. Still like the badaboom more though
Borderlands,3ckwen,SamsoniteSunset,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:07:07 2015 UTC,Badaboom's probably the best launcher overall in both BL2 and TPS. It's not the Norfleet but it's far more user-friendly.  I still prefer the Flakker for EOS though since it's more ammo efficient and has more synergy with One Last Thing.
Borderlands,3ckwen,tazercow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"I need to try it against Badassaurus a few times, I remember using it once with good results..."
Borderlands,3ckwen,Daemmerung,3,Thu Jul 9 12:37:45 2015 UTC,"When I first tried out this launcher I thought it would be great for dealing with large clumped up mobs.  Wrong.  Most of the child rockets miss.  The only reliable way to hit a normal sized enemy is to aim directly at them, but none of the extra rockets hit where you aim so it's still only one hit.  The only use I've found for it is against large bosses with huge hit boxes, but there are better weapons out there for these situations anyway.    I think this weapon could be pretty easily fixed if they increased the splash radius of the child rockets.  That would make it more viable against multiple targets where this weapon should be the most effective."
Borderlands,3ckwen,neBrettoP,3,Wed Jul 8 20:02:30 2015 UTC,Mongol + Grog Nozzle drunken effect = bye-bye Badassasaurus.  Also awesome to watch.

Borderlands,3clf2i,_darkwingduck_,2,Wed Jul 8 22:07:35 2015 UTC,"Chain Lightning is a legendary grenade mod dropped by badass sorcerers inside of the Tiny Tina DLC. It's very useful for Sal in general for spot healing and surveyor killing. They can be very irritating to dispose of, but generally waiting until they approach head on is the easiest solution with Sal. I was lucky enough to be doing Digi with a siren so phaselock etc. Haven't tested it but might be worth getting a levelled Dahlminator for the homing corrosive bullets.

Borderlands,3cjjxy,ijustwantcoffee,17,Wed Jul 8 16:02:21 2015 UTC,"DLC is clutch, because having on-level gear is vital. If you want to sort of cookie-cutter your way through, then between Torgue's and Tiny Tina's DLC, you can get in a position to farm up a DPUH (Torgue's vending machines) and Bee (Treants in the Forest) every few levels so you always have these two fairly broken items. You can also start them whenever in UVHM and they'll scale. You can also get a decent SMG on-level whenever you need by grabbing the Lascaux from Frostburn Canyon whenever you need. A healthy supply of Golden Keys should help round out your gear. Happy hunting!"
Borderlands,3cjjxy,IamIANianIam,3,Wed Jul 8 12:27:25 2015 UTC,"Well its easier to farm Savage Lee for an DPUH, plus the DP scales badly with the Bee, if you are going to use an UH with the Bee you want a Hard Unkempt Harold"
Borderlands,3cjjxy,OptimusWalrus,3,Wed Jul 8 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"The Torgue vending machines always have a legendary for sale.  Some of them are even inside, so there is zero risk involved in checking them, quitting, making a new game and checking again.  Please tell me how is it easier to kill a bunch of bullymongs to see if a named mob is there and hope that on the reasonable chance that he is there, that the rare chance that he drops the gun you want, and the even rarer chance that it has the parts you like.  Even if the chance of getting the gun from Savage Lee was twice that of getting one from the vending machine, it would still be faster to just buy it."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,Sword_n_board,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"It takes way longer to get 613 tongue tokens and find a good unkempt Harold then it does to kill savage lee. Plus, it takes a little while to get to the bar room brawl in the doc to earn the tokens"
Borderlands,3cjjxy,DeltaFoxtrot42,3,Wed Jul 8 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"Not if you switch to normal mode and farm tokens from low level mobs.  And while it may be faster to kill him once, there is no way to ensure the gun drops and comes with the parts you want.  The vending machine method may have a higher time investment to start, but once you get enough tokens, it only takes you 30 seconds to load up and check the vendor, with zero chance of getting killed.  The Savage Lee method requires you to kill bullymongs to get to him every time and if you're farming for new gear, it means your current stuff is a little out of date, increasing the risk.  edit: accidentally a word."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,Sword_n_board,2,Wed Jul 8 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"Savage Lee is a gaurantee spawn, the increased legendary drop rate means that he has more of a chance to drop the gun, plus you have to get into a dlc to farm torgue tokens, you can start farming savage lee after you retrieve the power core, its like 30 to 45 mins into the game.  And if you dont have gear to kill savage lee, which is pretty easy, then you shouldnt even be in UVHM.  Captain Flynt is harder to kill in UVHM."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,OptimusWalrus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:41:21 2015 UTC,Still more of a hassle than farming vending machines.
Borderlands,3cjjxy,Sword_n_board,2,Wed Jul 8 22:32:45 2015 UTC,"Even at a low difficulty the bar room thing probably takes about a 2 minutes to do, accept, complete and pick up all the tokens, assuming you're even that far into the dlc . You could probably do 3 savage lee runs for every 2 bar room fights and with the number of runs you have to do to get 613 tokens, you would already have at least a few unkempt Harolds. Although I will agree that if you're looking for a specific unkempt Harold with the right grip and prefix, then it's definitely better to use the vending machine, if you have it already."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,DeltaFoxtrot42,2,Wed Jul 8 23:16:58 2015 UTC,Pretty much this. Farming Lee is faster if you don't care about prefix/parts. Farming vendor is better if you want perfect parts. That said I recently spent like 20+ hours just farming the vendor for my perfect OP8 Harold...
Borderlands,3cjjxy,_darkwingduck_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Also, at that point, I would just use gibbed. Getting the right gear for each op level is so time consuming, and it's not like you can't get it, it's just that it would take too long."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,DeltaFoxtrot42,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:41:26 2015 UTC,"I play on PS4, can you even get jibbed/editor for that? I kind of agree with the thought process/philosophy, but then it's a slippery slope. I've always played pretty straight edge - if I started jibbing I'd probably just stop playing."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,_darkwingduck_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:12:02 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I don't know if they have gibbed for ps4 yet. You have to put your save on a flash drive and bring it to pic or something anyways, not worth it.  For me, I only used gibbed so I wouldn't spend too long farming and more time experiencing the game. Like, if already had a gun, but it was a low level, I just bumped it up."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,DeltaFoxtrot42,2,Thu Jul 9 01:25:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting, didn't realize that. Is it because the x2 on the weapon card splits the amp damage?"

Borderlands,3cjjxy,Daemmerung,5,Wed Jul 8 14:33:26 2015 UTC,What's your character? What's the current setup? I have no real info from you other than your level being 52.
Borderlands,3cjjxy,Bear_Taco,3,Wed Jul 8 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry, Should have mentioned that. Using Zer0 and curently have the skills set so that each skill has 3 in bloodshed and now doing the same thing with the cunning skill tree, nothing in sniping as of yet"
Borderlands,3cjjxy,Daemmerung,12,Wed Jul 8 15:59:14 2015 UTC,"each skill has 3   Don't do that.  There are very few cases where you want anything other than 0, 1, or 5 in a skill.  Pick your build and commit to it all-out, including choice of classmod.  It didn't matter so much in earlier, easier playthroughs, but in UVHM the effectiveness of your build will make a difference in your survival prospects."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,felixwankel,3,Wed Jul 8 16:46:06 2015 UTC,"You may need to go through your tree and re-spec. There are quite a few skills with Zer0 that should be maxed out, and quite a few skills that are about useless.  If you plan to play UVHM solo, you will need guns and equipment that fit your skill setup very well. Such as weapons with melee attachments and perhaps a cooldown reduction relic for his melee tree. Also, there are some skills that are generally not used unless you happen to have a particular gun, such as Zer0's be like water skill. This skill is generally not used, but if you have a 4 barrel torgue shotgun with a melee attachment, the max added 20% gun damage is HUGE when the guns base damage is over 8000x16 per shot.  This is how I really enjoyed my melee build, as it can allow for seriously fun and easy combos. Throw a slag grenade, enter deception, melee an enemy with death mark active, then shoot with a 4 barrel torgue. The damage bonuses active when you shoot them with that combo is pretty crazy, but the stacks are very easy to get, unlike some of Zer0's more complicated combos.  Just look at your available gear, or perhaps farm for a bit to get some, and build to suit. Or build your character how you want, and find guns and gear that benefit you the most. Slag is your friend! Combos and skills that stack bonuses are your friends!"
Borderlands,3cjjxy,ReverendHaze,3,Wed Jul 8 17:46:50 2015 UTC,"I'm at pretty much the exact same point (level 54 solo Zer0), you'll definitely want to at least respec, if not change trees. Couple reasons for that,   Cunning is a life saver in UVHM. Kunai let you throw 5 elemental projectiles for a chance at slagging and applying the appropriate DoT. Additionally, death mark stacks for a ton of bonus damage for taking down large enemies. Evenly spreading points around is fine for guaranteeing you get the worthwhile skills, but it also guarantees you get bad (and counterproductive) skills. Grim is an excellent example of this. Melee in UVHM needs a good roid shield, but as soon as you kill an enemy you'll recharge and lose the roid damage. You'll need to specialize more to maximize your damage/survivability potential. Melee is an awesome tree, I used it myself through most of TVHM, but you'll need really specific equipment and a min/max build to make it really work for you in UVHM. If you can't effectively string together MMF kills then you'll be spit out of decepti0n into the middle of a pack, not a great place for Zer0. There are plenty of resources on how to make it work, but they generally agree it's not a flexible build; you'll need the right skills to maximize damage for MMF chains to get the execute loop working.    Regardless of which tree you go down, check out the DDD guide to Zer0's skills. It's got a good breakdown of which skills you'll want for your playstyle. It's on the gearbox forums and it's pretty easy to follow."

Borderlands,3cjjxy,Xyanite,2,Wed Jul 8 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely get kunai so that you can easily slag enemies then. Slag is so important in UVHM. I don't know much about zero but i would go with melee and stay away from the sniper tree unless fighting a boss, then you're going to want b0re."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,Xyanite,2,Wed Jul 8 17:07:15 2015 UTC,"Don't put 3 points into every skill in Bloodshed, some of the skills in that tree are effectively useless and not worth speccing into.  In UVHM, you're going to want to have a solid, reliable playstyle. What playstyle are you aiming for? Pistols, shotguns, melee and sniping are common builds for Zer0."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,zloz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:55:44 2015 UTC,"well this is how I like to play. I prefer to use pistols as my main weapon having an smg/assault rifle and shotguns as backups if ammo runs thin.  A sniper in the last slot for picking off the likes of your standard bandit before jumping in to the tougher enemies. I do try to keep a different element in each slot for when it's needed, most typically fire and acid on the rifle or smg keeping them different from each other, explosive shotgun and raw power and accuracy for the pistol and sniper. Try to keep a slag grenade if I can, most likely some sort of lobbed mirv or singularity. I love having the 'Many Must Fall' skill for zipping around the field taking enemies out. Not really sure how I'd build him to work with that"
Borderlands,3cjjxy,lpscharen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:31:32 2015 UTC,"I would choose to either go with a pistol/shotgun build (and go down the Cunning tree, using a Stalker or Killer COM and Sheriff's badge/Bone of the ancients) or go full melee using the Bloodshed tree. Melee would involve getting a roid shield and depleting it before chaining Many Must Fall, the Love Thumper works pretty well for this but it's harder to chain kill enemies in UVHM, as they have more health.  In early UVHM, it's vital to stick to one particular build as you'll want to reach a capstone (with Zer0 at least) and you don't yet have the skill points to be going into several skill trees without reaching their end skills, if that makes sense."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,RoWaha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:12:59 2015 UTC,"I used Zero in normal and TVHM, and had to completely change the way I played for UVHM.  From what I've seen, the only real way to survive, and eventually be as strong as you used to be, is to infest heavily in Zero's melee options.    Get a Legendary Ninja class mod  Get the Grog Nozzle or the Rubi with melee attach and slug  Get a powerful lightning grenade  The way I approach killing mobs is to slag as much as I can, deception and grenade if there are strong shield users, and melee things I know I can OHKO with exectute.  The goal is keep yourself in deception as long as possible, as that'll keep you safe from enemy fire and allow you to rack up melee/kunai damage."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,_darkwingduck_,5,Wed Jul 8 20:07:30 2015 UTC,Is it also maybe about time for me to give up the +5% Rare Weapon relic?
Borderlands,3cjjxy,Daemmerung,11,Wed Jul 8 16:17:03 2015 UTC,You should have given it up a while ago. It doesn't actually do much for you. It does not help with legendary drops at all.
Borderlands,3cjjxy,DeltaFoxtrot42,5,Wed Jul 8 16:22:11 2015 UTC,Yup literally only ups rares no legendaries or pearls
Borderlands,3cjjxy,Xyanite,2,Wed Jul 8 16:29:06 2015 UTC,"Well by definition the removal of a large chunk of chances for white gear to drop increases the probability that orange/pearl etc will, by elminating a large portion of the common loot pool. However overall it's an awful relic anyway."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,brandpanz,5,Wed Jul 8 23:56:06 2015 UTC,That time was long ago in Normal Mode.  Dump it the moment that you have anything else to equip.
Borderlands,3cjjxy,Xyanite,2,Wed Jul 8 16:19:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. I think I remember reading it makes it so that one item will have a five percent chance of moving up one color in the rarity scale, but will never become legendary. So you're most likely going to get one extra green instead of a white."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,brandpanz,2,Wed Jul 8 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"It would be much, much more worthwhile to swap that for a Sheriff's badge if you decide to go with an Unkempt Harold. Alternatively, you could use a Proficiency relic to use your action skill more often. Just get rid of the Vault Hunter's relic whatever you do, it isn't worth the valuable slot it takes up."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,serialphreak,3,Wed Jul 8 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"Sheriff's Badge is great for all full auto pistols, not just the Harold.  Generally though elemental relics (especially Bone of the Ancients) are most preferred because of the multiplicative damage increase."
Borderlands,3cjjxy,DeltaFoxtrot42,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"I mentioned the UH specifically because it was a common suggestion in this thread. In which case, the Bone of the Ancients wouldn't boost the UH's damage because the Harold deals explosive damage."

Also, gear become outdated quicker so you'll have to always be on the look out. Or you can just use golden keys. Lastly,  don't use the bee if you want to have fun.

In the scarlett dlc, u need to get the reward of the mission whoops (=Sandhawk). Than do the Torgue Dlc and get till or further than Pete's Bar Brawl. There u do the Bar several times, that u have enough tokens for a Unkempt Harold ( Double Pennintrating is the best prefix). If u have your sandhawk and Harold, kill Pete. After Pete u can complete this dlc or start any other Dlc. I prefer Tiny Tina where u can farm treants for The Bee Shield and the handsome sorcerer for the Conference call. After that u need to complete all other dlc and than do story/bar brawl for the xp. It can be helpfull to reset your mission progress of UVHM, so u can re-complete the Whoops mission for a higher lvl sandhawk."

Second, farm the bosses for each specific legendary. For example, if you want the hellfire, farm scorch. Also, the Lascaux is a great and that is always free in frostburn canyon I believe. Lastly, use the shift codes to get golden keys so you can get free purple gear when needed Also, some greens can be good. Generally good guns/items are: maliwan smgs and snipers, turtle shields, tediore shields (especially their purple ones!), torgue double penetrating hand guns, high pellet shotguns, and spitters, Hyperion shotguns, Dahl snipers and vladof pistols and snipers."
Borderlands,3cmq8r,DeltaFoxtrot42,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:51:30 2015 UTC,Do they still give out shift codes? Also they've stated that the keys don't get you orange weapons I believe.

For the latter, start with the ""Motion"" tree. Put 5 points between ward and accelerate, max out suspension and put one point in converge.

Grim is not a great shield-recovery skill, but it's enough to keep the shield active and so keep the spikes coming.  Big slow shields are generally better on characters who have ways to refill them more quickly, or ways to shorten the recharge delay.  Fast Tediore shields are a Zer0 staple for just the reason that you cite: you can recover your entire shield while you're in Decepti0n."

Borderlands,3cfu4n,TheBearProphet,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:31:59 2015 UTC,Grenade damage is (weapon damage) X (ammo left in clip) so for example if you have a 100 damage weapon and 29 shots left it would be 2900 grenade shot if you reloaded.

Vladolf's theme is rapidfire, and yet there are so many other manufacturers which do rapidfire better and also have other things going on with them. Dahl gets ultra low recoil and ammo efficiency, Hyperion gets negative recoil so you actually feel good about holding down the trigger for long times, Torgue gets massive damage and explosions, Bandit/Scav let you just hold down the trigger for half an hour, Maliwan has higher elemental damage to actually synergize with a high rate of fire, etc.  Other than Jakobs which doesn't do rapidfire at all the only manufacturer which does it worse is Tediore who's weapons are based around the exploding reloads.  Meanwhile Vladolf's entire theme revolves around rapidfire and that alone, Vladolf is literally only... rapidfire. You'd think that they would be A LOT better at rapidfire to make up for their lack of other defining traits but no, they don't even do rapidfire better than other brands.

In BL1 it just wasn't expansive enough, in BL2 it had too many restrictions. If BL3 was without those restrictions, Gearbox could make some cool stuff."

If you haven't yet taken Fresh Air in Research and Development in this playthrough, it is worth a completely silly amount of experience and requires no fighting at all.  You'd need to survive a gantlet of overleveled stalkers on your way to accept the mission.

In that case, my last suggestion would be to consider deferring turning in the storyline mission Eye To Eye until you've successfully trained to level 50.  That way you get The Beginning of the End (the final storyline mission) at level 50.  You'll be pretty overleveled for Vorago Solitude and the Veins etc, but you'll face a level 50 final Sentinel (substantially tougher than the usual 48, given that your gear will be 46-48 barring heroic effort in the Holodome), and a level 50 final mission reward."

Borderlands,3cicim,grimgeekx,4,Wed Jul 8 03:32:09 2015 UTC,"Jack's great for area control when playing solo (I feel like the Pre-Sequel throws more enemies/waves at you than Borderlands 2 did), and obviously Athena can tank a ton of damage, so it's really more up to your play style. (I love Athena, but if you want some extra funny dialogue, Jack's great.) If you build them both right, they're both pretty viable for endgame."

If you're new, than I think you should play Jack, because his Digi Jacks will do a lot of work and make it quite easy for you.

Borderlands,3cicim,Anderill,3,Wed Jul 8 11:06:53 2015 UTC,"No problem man! To specify this a bit: Athena is a little bit like Zer0 in BL2...really powerful, but you need to do some micromanagement while combat to unfold her full potential. So if you like to play more strategic and stuff, Athena sure is the right choice. But if you just want to beat the game easy and kill everything really fast, than maybe Jack would be right."

Borderlands,3ciiyz,McRibbles,3,Wed Jul 8 04:27:14 2015 UTC,"Commandant Steele was also a Siren, but then she got stabbed...so... yeah. Presumably enough, assuming the next Siren in line was born shortly after he/she would be about 5 or so. Ditto with Angel's death, but that child would be even younger if it's even born yet.  So now we know of: Lillith, Maya, Angel's 'Replacement', and Steele's 'Replacement'. As of right now that leaves 2 we know about that are still alive plus a little kiddie Siren, a likely infant/not even born yet Siren, and two others.   Having even one Siren with you makes you a big target, two is even more, but having 6 in the same place for any time at all? People are going to put a target on your backs. Could be a nice plotline/throw-away line/perhaps a side mission regarding the whole 'multiple siren's in one place' thing, but having a story not built around the whole 'Holy crap 2/3+ Sirens in 1 spot imagine the dosh/power/whatever we could get' would be a bit odd if we don't while having the story actually revolve around that would be a bit lack-luster.   I'm all for having another Siren character (Maybe some sort of action skill where you can summon a variety of objects for a list and plop em down for cover/damage/platforming help?) but I'm not sure if it would exactly be the best regarding general usage of the Sirens and for the plotline."

Instead it gets a generic AR name like ""Rifle"", and a seemingly random Torgue-barrel effect.  Jakobs AR may fire a Scav-style wobbly rocket, Vladof AR may fire a Jakobs-style lobbed cannon shot, etc.  I don't remember whether ammo consumption for this weapon matches the manufacturer or the barrel effect."

Every other barrel-weapon combo (for a combo where a particular barrel exists for that weapon class, of course) is already a valid weapon.  I don't know whether other invalid part combinations can now spawn on glitch weapons.  Tediore grip on a Jakobs pistol, for example, or Bandit/Scav grip on a Vladof pistol.

Borderlands,3ccntv,ares0027,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:26:41 2015 UTC,"It should work in multiplayer as long as all players have it installed. Yeah, WillowTree lets you change your bank and backpack space. Some full sets are pretty overpowered, but they can take a while to farm. I'll rebalance things depending on feedback. What do you mean by examples? Like the videos in the OP?: Release video -- Set breakdown"
Borderlands,3ccntv,ares0027,2,Tue Jul 7 07:55:12 2015 UTC,thank you for your answers. i downloaded it and will definitely try tonight with my friends. assuming that items scale with the level? we are all level 28 atm and i would love to have good (but definitely not op) drops :) thank you
Borderlands,3ccntv,ares0027,2,Tue Jul 7 08:51:27 2015 UTC,"assuming that items scale with the level?   Yep, item drop levels are dependent on the level of the enemy killed."
Borderlands,3ccntv,ares0027,2,Tue Jul 7 09:00:38 2015 UTC,"I loved it. We all loved it tbh. Just tested it for an hour or so. I loved new grenade types especially star and homing ones.   Only ""problem"" we had is we were three players; hunter, siren, berserker. And 3 out of 10 drops were the exact same siren mods. Same options, same stats. And almost 60-70% of a class mod is exactly same. (2 out of 3 hunter mods are exact copies etc).   And another suggestion is adding a prefix or suffix to item names or a visible buff indicator to see your current (addon) drop rates/custom items. Of course we can see descriptions like [DAMAGE] or [CORROSIVE] but as far as i have seen not all items have that. And a buff to see your stacking drop rate would be awesome.   Long story short a wonderful mod. Shows real strenght of the item creation power of borderlands. It wasnt that op for us (lvl 25 to 29) and you definitely need inventory slots if you are going to use this because it adds way too many items (most of them are useless but those pinky colored names are forcing you to loot)"
Borderlands,3ccntv,ares0027,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:51:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm that identical drops thing is odd. I was having a similar issue when I was testing the loot pools where every drop was doubled, but I fixed that. I haven't tested it in multiplayer though. How did those drops occur? Was it from the same player, and if so was it on the same kill? Or were different players causing identical drops?  Not all weapons and items have a secondary set, but they all have a primary set, which will always be visible in the prefix/title, so you can tell if something is from this pack.  I could do something more to indicate current drop rates, like a screen particle that simulates a HUD element. I'm planning on doing that with the sets, so you always know which set is active. I didn't do that in the initial release since I wanted the first version to use purely in-game assets (although I might still be able to make decent looking icons without importing new textures).  Anyway, glad you enjoyed and thanks for the feedback!  EDIT: Also, would you say the drop rates are too high? I made them high because the different sets increase the loot variety by an order of magnitude, making endgame farming for anything specific take quite a while. But the volume of drops does seem a bit much, especially after killing a horde of enemies."

Deception just before the dragon swoops in for a breath attack, get the hell away from your hologram and jump before executing the dragon in mid-air. You should have enough range to connect and if you have a roid shield (you should have a roid shield) you ought to take it down in one or two melee hits."

Took me a few goes, though.  There's a video here if you're interested, successful run starts at about 57:15 (also spoilers after the final defeat)."

COM: Legendary Sickle, Legendary Reaper, Sickle (Blue, +6 StV)  Relics: Blood of ancients, health relic, Sherrif's badge, explosive damage Relic.

Borderlands,3cdgow,wingsday1,2,Tue Jul 7 03:35:38 2015 UTC,"As a player who has put in too many hours into Krieg, I agree completely with this build.   I'd add in a grog nozzle (any level) for situations where RtB isn't a viable solution for staying healthy. While holding it, toss out a low timer grenade and get all your health back. I also think Sherrif's badge is the best of the listed relics because of how well it supports the Unkempt Harold.  I'd like to touch on playstyle with this build. It's pretty straight forward after level 26 - slag as many things as possible while you have health. If everything is slagged and you still have health, pull out your favorite gun and get to work.  As soon as you're low, hit RtB and turn everything into red mist. If you have a couple team mates, see if one would be willing to go on slag duty while you RtB.  Bosses or flyers you're probably going to want to pull out the grog nozzle and grenades instead of RtB.  Also, while StV can be frustrating, just remember that the percentage you hit yourself is fixed and the damage out vastly exceeds the damage in.  Have fun."
Borderlands,3cdgow,Foxtrot3100,2,Tue Jul 7 16:28:28 2015 UTC,"Some notes on Relics and STV: First, a fun fact about the Sherrif's badge, it increases the rate at which you can throw axes, which is pretty nifty in some areas. Basicly, in conjunction with a harold, this Relic gives you a lot of damage.  Now, a bit on STV: the thing about StV, is that if you are using a RR and the above mentioned builds, you will probably never die from the damage from StV, what you will die to is the extremly long animation it has, because it prevents you from killing things and staying above health gate, this is espically true in OP+. That is why I prefer the blood of ancients/health relic, it reduces the damage StV does to you even further and gives you a bunch more health to work with when StV decides it wants you dead.  Oh, and Surveyors are just a blast with only axes and torgue guns, though I have gotten pretty good at tossing axes because of them. Also, keep in mind the reach glich, if you can get directly below them (or over them i guess...) you can melee them regardless of distance."

Borderlands,3cdgow,JakeMLP,2,Tue Jul 7 06:46:41 2015 UTC,"so a lot of the things you said are just wrong, for example, not only is the best shield for (mania) Krieg not the Thumper (its the Rough rider) but he actually dosent work that well with roid shields, they will leave you very squishy. You will have a much better time if you use adaptive shields. Also, you skipped one of krieg's best skills, Strip the Flesh, its multiplicative. You were right that weapons are not a huge deal, but the stuff you do recomend makes no sence, generally unless you really know what you're doing you want to be in RtB as muc has possible, in addition, the heal can mess up your transformation locking you into a much weaker BxR and having to deal with the long cooldown. For weapons, I recomend: Rapier (slag), Unkempt Harold/swordsplosion (or any other explosive weapon really), Slaga, Florentine and other such utility guns."

Borderlands,3cd4qw,kleeko,3,Mon Jul 6 23:55:41 2015 UTC,"weapons dedicated to a single element are unique/legendary/seraph weapons and usually have a special effect. For example: the Infection will always be corrosive. It has a low base damage but a huge damage over time effect. The Volcano has a high splash damage (it's being outperformed by a purple Snider though). However, the Sandhawk for example is the strongest SMG in the game, so a corrosive Sandhawk will outperform every other corrosive weapon of the same level on normal conditions. (except rocket launchers)  EDIT: Forgot to say, Torgue weapons are ALWAYS explosive."
Borderlands,3cd4qw,CriticalFaceTime,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"Didn't know the sandhawk was the best SMG period. Thanks for the answer.  Any list to ""best weapons""?"
Borderlands,3cd4qw,CriticalFaceTime,5,Tue Jul 7 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"Well, the fastest way to educate yourself about weapons is on youtube. Look up Admiral Bahroo's channel, he has a ""best in slot"" series, where he shows the 5 strongest weapons of every weapon type. He also compares the base damages to one another on a diagram and stuff, so it's not the kind of chart where people just saying what's the best in their opinion, but a more ""scientific"" one. Also check out Man of Low Moral Fiber's channel. He has a ""Does it suck?"" series, where he tries out popular weapons on the highest difficulty to test them and shows their utility."
Borderlands,3cd4qw,wingsday1,3,Tue Jul 7 00:09:25 2015 UTC,"I would check out fiber and the GBX forums, Bahroo has an established track record of preading misinformation, at least we try to correct ourselves when we screw up on the forums"
Borderlands,3cd4qw,30SecondsToFail,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:44:41 2015 UTC,"Technically, it's the Tattler because it SLIGHTLY out DPS's the Sandhawk (assuming you don't have the Bee) but the Sandhawk is way more functional. Using the Tattler on Gaige with full stacks of Anarchy and the Vladof glitch is one of the most fun OP experiences in-game IMHO"
Borderlands,3cbjmx,brandpanz,4,Mon Jul 6 17:04:03 2015 UTC,"Skullmasher is best used for characters who have some form of +projectile speed or some way to capitalize on missed shots.  It is arguably a good shotgun replacement for Gaige because she gets so much +gun damage and very little +fire rate (which is more or less useless on this gun).  Dual-wielding Skullmasher with the Lady Fist can also create some ridiculous crits on bosses with large crit spots (like the Bunker or the Warrior).  Sadly, since the Skullmasher's spread makes it a short-to-mid-range weapon, it is largely overshadowed by the Pimpernel, which gets to benefit from +grenade damage and comes in elemental varieties.  The Mothrakk farm is super tedious if you don't have the creature slaughter dome.  Even if you do have the creature slaughter dome, it's still a bit of a hike to Son of Mothrakk.  However, the Preserve is a good chubby farming area in general, and the Doctor's Orders mission also gives you guaranteed loot midgets during each run, so if you're farming for midgets/chubbies, finishing the jog to Son of Mothrakk and opening the red chest beyond him can be worthwhile.  Farming Nel is a whole different bag of cats, although the actual encounter with Nel is fun.  I don't really know whether to give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down - in BL2 it's not worth farming for most builds, but it's not a whole lot of extra work if you're already killing things in the preserve.  In TPS it's worth farming for just about anyone who wants a mid-range cover-fire weapon, but it's a whole lot more trouble."

Borderlands,3cbjmx,LOLmouseLOL,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:09:39 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt, a great gun for Sniper Aurelia. Although, I find that the amount of bullets being shot sometimes will mess up my I Never Miss stacks. The shot I made in my cursor gets the head shot, but I lose my stacks regardless. I commonly had stacks up to 100, but now I rarely get them past 15. I'm not sure WHY this happens though.. because it happens at close and long range, with no obvious cause (to me).  The gun has incredible damage though.. I'm not fully invested in the sniper tree yet, but I'm nearly one hitting things my level with head shots, Fully spec'd, and I'll be crazy.  However. The best part of this gun, is the mini-quest you do to get it from Nel in The Pre-Sequel. Ne is a mysterious person. A man named Thornton wants you to cal him a dick. Why? You don't fucking know, but you do it anyway.   He cries, you walk away. Later on, you come out, and spell it out for him: he's a dick. Then he calls out an army before taking you on himself.  I truly believe that he is not the dick in this story, but we are. He just has a sweet ass gun."

At the end of The Pre Sequel, we get some exposition and one of the things said by someone refers to 'all the Vault Hunters you can get.' Sorry, trying not to spoil it, so what we need is a character creator, like, a real one. As it begins you will pick a 'Mentor', a Vault Hunter from Borderlands 1-Pre Sequel, (excluding Nisha and Wilhelm, for obvious reasons) and you will take on a variation of their action skill. You will then create the look of your character, and begin learning from your mentor. From there the game follows the plot!  I really like my idea, do you? I know I do! ;P  New Rarities! Tales From The Borderlands gave me a good idea! Vintage Weapons: New rarity, mostly Atlas stuff, but some other manufacturer's stuff too. Extremely rare and valuable, but also a bit more powerful than Legendarys and Pearls, like the difference between Legendarys and Purples in Borderlands 1. I think that would add a new and appealing rarity to the game and be fairly interesting.  Tell me what you think! :P"
Borderlands,3ce6z4,JacePlaysGames,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think I want to build my own character. BL2 excelled in story telling, and this was undoubtedly because of premade characters with their own back stories and personalities. Creating your own character, however akin to past playables seems out of place in BL to me. I enjoy the amount of customization they have already given us and I don't really think I wanna create a character from scratch. If I did, maybe I'd advocate for an MMO borderlands but even that probably won't be great."
Borderlands,3ce6z4,MrAuneeb,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not denying that is true, it's just I was going off a hint in the plot at the end of the Pre Sequel that hinted to more Vault Hunters, so if that's the route they take, I'd be fine with it, but I wouldn't be mad if they didn't. So I see what you're saying, it isn't in their formula, but they have strayed away from the norm before, and it's sometimes worked out (I.e Shift codes, Low gravity, etc.)"
Borderlands,3ce6z4,JacePlaysGames,0,Wed Jul 8 21:38:50 2015 UTC,"I would love to have 12 characters in the game very much if ther kept the skill progression exactly the same as all the previous games, but I would more enjoy this idea I will explain that would really change the formula of playing through the game.  When you start the game, you chose between 4 characters with the following types of basic action skills: Stun (basically crowd controll), Melee rampage, Summon (where you deploy some sort AI minion), and Cloak.  The idea I'm going for is this: Vault hunters action skills and skill trees should be built off of balance, synergy and fun. NOT off of trying to be unique compared to previous vault hunters.  Another thing: Action skills need to be one of the MAIN things that are changed or upgraded as you  progress in the game. For instance, in all of the BL games combined you have 6 summon action skills: Bloodwing, Deathtrap, Axtons Turret, Wilhelms Surveyers, Jack's Dopplegangers, and Aurelia's ice thingy. While, yes is would be fun to play all these characters seprately, why not have one summon action skill that is extremely malleable through the progression of the game.   Some ideas for different versions of each of my action skill types:  Stun: 'hack' an enemies shield so that the shield is overpowered and creates an enourmous force field around a stunned enemy, throw a grenade that explodes with blinding light so that enemies can no longer tell who to shoot at, throw out a holograph display of loot chests and money so the bandits are drawn toward it (the chest explodes with elemental light when a bandit opens it).  Melee Rampage: You can still shoot hip fire (pistols only) but when you press the aim button you will punch instead of aim the gun, you pull our a large speaker over your shoulder (constantly playing music) and a microphone in your right (press aim button to shout, so enemies close to you will have a headache. Press shoot button to smack them with the microphone), two daggers that can swipe very fast if you get the timing right and dash forward a little bit with every slash.  Summon: Non moveable turret that you can also sit on and aim, badass shotgun midget who has a propeller tied to his back, BUL loader who is has homing rockets that heal teammates but debuff enemies (like slag).  Cloak (all of these take place while invisible): creep up on enemies and steal their stuff such as shield grenade or all their ammo but you may only steal from 4 enemies per cloak, put a large wall in front of enemies that makes allys behind it invisible and enemies will not shoot at them however will find you if they arent fighting something else, move around the battlefield placing explosives like barrels (your teammates can shoot these right after you place them) or mines that act like singularity grenades.

Borderlands,3ccenw,TwitchyUncleC,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:23:33 2015 UTC,"My favorite is Zer0.  Specifically melee Zer0.  Think about this... in Borderlands 1 we had a berserker who would put his guns away and punch.  He was the melee character.  In Borderlands 2 the soldier is soldier and the siren is siren.  The berserker is now the gunzerker and is no longer the melee class.  The sniper of the game is now the melee class.  Now that can just sound terribly wrong to some people.  I love being a sniper but that was what I did wrong in both Borderlands 1 and 2.  Focusing on the sniper skill trees would cause you to ignore your action skill.  I feel like the action skills are what really separate Borderlands from other shooters when it comes to game play.  I wasn't a believer in melee Zer0 at first.  But I gave it a shot when The Handsome Collection brought me back to Borderlands 2.  And I never looked back.  Also, once you get to about level 56 you can reach the capstone of two skill trees.  Once you understand the synergy of having Death Bl0ss0m (kunai) and Many Must Fall you will understand the potential of melee Zer0.  And at level 72 you will be able to get both those capstones and B0re.  Super fun build to play."

I always wondered what I missed out on from Borderlands 1."

It was in TPS, I had played both other games and all their DLC prior to this and not one friggin' Legendary drop the whole time. Then after killing Redbelly, the Striker dropped. It was the first time doing something in a videogame (or real life for that matter) made me feel as if I had accomplished something, made me feel like even if I got hit by a car the next day I would have done something."
Borderlands,3c8xvy,massdefect76,3,Mon Jul 6 03:31:00 2015 UTC,"I only ever played BL1 as Mordecai. I'm talking like 5 different playthroughs. It was great because when playing with my friends I could be an amazing support sniper; taking out the big enemies while someone like Brick acted like a brick taking out the drones. But even when playing alone I was never really alone. My best friend Bloodwing was always by my side. Out comes BL2. I'm loving every little thing about this game. Everything is improved upon from the last game. Anyway I get to this part where Jack kidnaps Bloodwing and I have to go save him. ""Wait I have to fight him? Please don't make me do this. PLEASE!"" So reluctantly I go and kill my best friend. But oh what's this? He's not dead? Oh! Oh yay I can save him!!! :D .........no. No. NOOOOOO!!

I remember feeling the stress of her foreshadowing the fact that she couldn't handle Roland's death which only made it worse for me even though I've played through that game multiple times. His death only really hit me once I felt how Tiny Tina felt and as soon she dropped to her knees crying to explain to the rest of the crew that it's her story and that it can be whatever she wanted it to be. There were tears rolling down her face and I was on the edge of losing it. As she continues on with her story and the handsome sorcerer has launched his magic attack behind the white knights back, an attack that would kill him and there was only one thing that could stop it...one miracle. You hear bloodwing's screech as it deflects the handsome sorcerers spell and saves Roland, landing on his arm in slow motion and you realize that in your story, just like in her story, nobody has to die. Not only was it my favorite story ever but i was a mess after that. I even cried when I explained the ending to my brother. I fucking love that game so much."
Borderlands,3c8xvy,SusanKriegsworth,2,Mon Jul 6 04:32:43 2015 UTC,I played the first Borderlands with my best friend one summer. We played through multiple times with different characters.

I think screw it, and boost the stingray up to hit it.  What happened next will stay with me forever.  The shuggaroth spirals out of control and out of orbit.  Spiraling up into the lunar sky as I laugh my as off staring after it.  I'm pretty sure it's a well known or common bug, but discovering it on my own and watching it float away?  Priceless."

I was a gunzerker with a crappy build (specced into the brawn tree) and only had a slag rubi, a good touch and 2 shotguns.   After something like 10 loses, I found this old trick where you hide from Terry behind a rock.  Even with this, the fight was a huge pain in the ass. It took me almost an entire afternoon to kill him (he destroyed me several times) with my shitty items. My dps was so shit that in 10 minutes I only took away half of his life. I also had to dodge everything, since my regen was pure shit, and with my crappy build I couldn't permazerk. So yea it was damn hard  But man, the feel when Terry got finally down. I was so happy because it was my first raid boss kill. Since I didn't know Terry always give you a legendary slayer mod, I was so excited when I saw that orange beam. And when I found that it was a slayer of terra mod for the gunzerker, my life was complete, seriously.  This day I felt like a invincible badass. Then some days after I discover UVHM.

We had only a little time to play it together, since he had cancer. Later that year, he passed away. I sent an email to gearbox, asking if they could do something for me.

Borderlands,3ccagp,essarr71,-2,Mon Jul 6 23:35:51 2015 UTC,"Not even close. The Bee was bugged to begin with. The enemies even without a Bee were piss easy to kill at 50. There was no challenge, no use of mechanics.   make all the arguments you want    Is this a 'nananana I'm not listening'?"

Borderlands,3c8fk8,Daemmerung,2,Sun Jul 5 23:49:15 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love what Tales has made out of the Borderlands 2 OST, too.  Every time that the chugging Bloodshot Ramparts fight music starts, I get a strong sympathetic surge, gooseflesh and all.  It is awesome."
Borderlands,3c8fk8,Soul_Rage,3,Mon Jul 6 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"Uh, I think you mean TPS's soundtrack is awesome."
Borderlands,3c8fk8,Xyanite,4,Mon Jul 6 12:51:11 2015 UTC,"I loved the Triton Flats ambience as well, Innerspace from the Claptastic Voyage (music warning) is probably my favourite if you count DLCs."
Borderlands,3c8fk8,KingNuclearo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:07:43 2015 UTC,"Truth be told, the soundtrack was the first thing that stood out to me in that dlc. As soon as I stepped in the Motherless Board I was just mesmerized by the whole atmosphere of the place. It really is beautiful."
Borderlands,3c8fk8,Crowforge,2,Mon Jul 6 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"I still think the opening theme is the weakest of any of the games, including Tales. The music isn't half bad by any sense (I haven't played the DLC but damn the Fyrestone Simulator track fills me with some nostalgia.) I haven't paid much attention to TPS's OST. I do know however it was the first in the series where I told my friends to hold on a sec and listen to the songs playing as we fought bandits."

Borderlands,3c8zk0,596Franky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"What I did with my maya was playing scarlett's and torgue's dlcs, but I only did the main story missions. When  I started TVHM ,I reached Sanctuary and then started Tiny Tina DLC in order to get a grog nozzle. If you do that, I'd suggest you to bring some explosive weapons."
Borderlands,3c8zk0,Sage_Whore,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:58:20 2015 UTC,"Personally speaking, I completed the DLC for the hell of it/the story even though by the end of it I was obscenely overleveled for the enemies I was facing. It was also a little bit because I wanted to see what cool stuff I could expect and get, maybe get a feel for what I'm up against. You might want to do that if you want to find out what the DLC are all about, but if your main concern is levels, hell, TVHM all the way."
Borderlands,3c8yoz,Sparrows413,2,Mon Jul 6 00:36:05 2015 UTC,You will be able to retry if you backup the save file.  If you're scared of hurting the turrets too much yourself with close enough you could respec for the mission and then go back to your old build when you reach the next area.
Borderlands,3c8yoz,Fokkussu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:26:18 2015 UTC,"I found that that challenge was actually easier in tvhm, since the turrets have more health and you have more skills."

Borderlands,3c78xo,freetogoodhome,6,Sun Jul 5 16:17:08 2015 UTC,Hmmm I want to make a Borderlands RPG do you think that could work as a 2D sidescroller?
Borderlands,3c78xo,DELIBIRD_RULEZ,4,Sun Jul 5 17:12:30 2015 UTC,"It has the possibility of being absolutely awesome, if done right. Many sidescrollers are awesome even being simple, like battleblock theater."
Borderlands,3c78xo,Jarl__Ballin,6,Sun Jul 5 19:37:04 2015 UTC,"I never heard of Battleblock Theatre until now that looks amazing, I played Castle Crashers a lot and beat it a bunch of times. I think the artwork would need to be really good to make it in 2D."

Borderlands,3c78xo,Daemmerung,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"If you've played Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, taking something akin to that, make it gun-centric, and add randomized weapon effects that make more sense in that style, such as guns that ""wave"" and ""burst"" and you'ld have a very interesting game."
Borderlands,3c78xo,Daemmerung,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:06:26 2015 UTC,Yeah.
Borderlands,3c78xo,Daemmerung,8,Mon Jul 6 00:37:07 2015 UTC,Borderlands was the gateway game that helped me break a roguelike habit of almost thirty years.  I still have my notes on the Borderlands-inspired roguelike that I was going to write in my copious free time (and that never got implemented beyond facing and moving a @ character around an ASCII hex grid of obstacles).  I did not write this under the illusion that anybody else would ever want to play it!  Your game should be about your own obsessions.
Borderlands,3c78xo,tizzix,2,Sun Jul 5 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"Borderlands would be a insane rogue-like if you restarted everytime you died. I think you would have to tweak some things to get it right. As for my obsessions I've always been obsessed with MMORPG's but I don't think Borderlands could be a MMO. I honestly want to make a full Borderlands RPG with missions, bosses, vault hunters and a story but that is a big project. freetogoodhome suggested a sidescroller so maybe I could make a 2D Borderlands RPG as a sidescroller."
Borderlands,3c78xo,Daemmerung,7,Sun Jul 5 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"How about a shmup?  ""TK Baha's Last Stand,"" surviving ever-lengthening waves of skags and psycho-bandit-assassins. Unlock a new TK-stle weapon with every wave.  Maybe get a single get-out-of-jail per wave, kind of like the smart bomb in DEFENDER, where a random Vault Hunter appears and annihilates every enemy currently on the screen: ""Ever seen a Siren in action? Now's your chance"" fry fry fry fry fry bamf, ""Let's get up in this!"" dakka dakka dakka dakka bamf, etc."
Borderlands,3c78xo,_darkwingduck_,2,Sun Jul 5 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"That's such a good idea and not too big! The random Vault Hunter clearing the enemies is a good idea, I wonder what TK guns to make."
Borderlands,3c78xo,Daemmerung,4,Sun Jul 5 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"We only have three TK weapons in canon (Lady Finger, Lady Fist, two versions of Wave).  You're going to have to invent the rest out of new cloth.  TK was an inventive guy, so pretty much anything goes, I reckon.  I have no idea how we get around TK being blind in a shmup, but you'll think of something!  set $buck=Passed"
Borderlands,3c78xo,bayiscoolioz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:06:43 2015 UTC,Haha I'm just going to go crazy inventing guns. As for him being blind I can't think of anything so meh; alternate universe where TK didn't go blind.
Borderlands,3c78xo,MustMention,3,Mon Jul 6 01:28:58 2015 UTC,"I would love a borderlands 2 type of game  but instead of shooting people with guns,  you have to reason with people and discuss your problems.  If things get too heavy and heated,  you then have to hug it out.  No guns.  Just hugs. Never seen a game like it.  Maybe it's time. Maybe you are the one to make it happen."

Borderlands,3c78xo,SOHC4,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:52:46 2015 UTC,"I think a top down rogulike Borderlands would be pretty cool, but that would be kinda a different game all together.  A rouglike-like Borderlands nor unlike Tower of Guns or Paranautical Activity would probably be the shit though.  As you go through the stages, you will go through area sets with a boss at the end of each stage. You will find random loot along the way, and if you explore enough, you will also find enough enemies to level up and unlock useful abilities.  The goal I imagine would be to finish the game as fast as possible, so to emphasize strategic and skillful play. The more you go without, the better you are doing. The Binding of Isaac kind of does that with rewards for getting to certain points by certain times. I imagine a reverse luck counter- the faster you go, the higher your luck will be. If you finish a stage quick enough, your luck will get a boost so that you can amply support fast play with rarer loot.   That is just what I imagine. With a Rouglike-Borderlands-like, I don't think you could go wrong.  Also, BL1 style weapon generation."
Borderlands,3c7jfl,djkinz,27,Sun Jul 5 16:59:13 2015 UTC,I think people forget that this game is over three years old.

Yes it's possible, it can just take a while. The drop rate is also increased based on difficulty. It's higher in TVHM than in normal mode, and its higher in UVHM than in TVHM"
Borderlands,3c76pe,CustomCoder,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:39:42 2015 UTC,"""...drop rate is also increased based on difficulty. It's higher in TVHM than in normal mode, and its higher in UVHM than in TVHM""   Is this really true? Is there any data on this?"
Borderlands,3c76pe,propargylalcohol,4,Sun Jul 5 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's not huge, but its definitely noticeable. It makes sense ,because in UVHM, legendaries with good synergies are a requirement almost due to difficulty and enemy health/power. This is absolutely true information.

Borderlands,3c76pe,cybersteel8,3,Sun Jul 5 15:58:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit surprised by it but you're absolutely right, it makes sense.

Borderlands,3c76pe,propargylalcohol,4,Sun Jul 5 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"There is. Check out the borderlands wiki. There are in depth analysis and percentages on enemy spawn rates, and specific legendary drop rates. Some legendaries have higher drops than others."

Borderlands,3c76pe,totallyblasted,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:43:08 2015 UTC,TVHM and UVHM they drop constantly. I think they even drop them on normal but the rate is low. On UVHM it's at least every other run I get a legendary.

Borderlands,3c8434,uymai,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:43:49 2015 UTC,TVHM.  Scarlett for the Rapier (melee) and Pimpernel (sniper).  Torgue for a DPUH.  I've never played the Hammerlock DLC but I would save Tiny Tina's for last.  It's the best DLC and a true epilogue for the main story.  Tiny Tina is also where you get the grog nozzle which is the best healing gun in the game.

Borderlands,3c609p,headlessunicorn,8,Sun Jul 5 03:51:27 2015 UTC,"The middle tree is a good all around tree.  By that level you can get Innervate and get some health regeneration.  The way I played him I used Deception for 2 reasons, either to run up on an enemy to get a damage bonus or as an escape plan for when things got too hairy.  For loaders specifically you could use a corrosive or explosive weapon with a decent fire rate to take them down easier."
Borderlands,3c609p,shamus4mwcrew,2,Sun Jul 5 04:28:55 2015 UTC,"I actually was using the left tree, but once I got better weapons, gained more actual experience playing, as in as a player, I switched to the middle. It's definitely better. Just finished the normal story mode :D thanks for the ideas."
Borderlands,3c609p,ReverendEarthwormJim,8,Sun Jul 5 20:09:02 2015 UTC,"Check out the Youtube walkthrough for Major Slack (user name is MajorSlackAttack). He demonstrates how to play Zer0 and explains the strategies as he plays the game. He also warns you when a video is buying/selling ""business"" so you can skip it.  The presentation improves as the game progresses, so stick with it if you start at the beginning."
Borderlands,3c609p,8988303682,2,Sun Jul 5 04:40:27 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm watching it!
Borderlands,3c609p,VanillaCreamGuy,4,Sun Jul 5 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"Early game go into the middle tree. After that I would definitely go sniper. Sniper Zer0 is ridiculously powerful even at op8. I would suggest a couple Lyudas of different elements and a slag Pimpernel, as it has a near 100% slag chance."
Borderlands,3c609p,RoWaha,3,Sun Jul 5 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"I'm at level 24 (got stuck at the wildlife preserve so I'm doing the headhunter DLCs) like OP. Is the middle skill tree really worthwhile for solo? Going in for melee kills seems to be almost suicidal on solo, and the middle tree seems to be mostly melee related. My strategy right now is usually to attack from a far distance, fire on the crowds as they run towards me, then use Decepti0n to retreat and repeat. This seems to work really well because the enemies gather in a tight group around the holographic decoy meaning when you fire, you usually get the B0re bonus.  To unlock Innervate you need to spend 15 points in that tree, seems like a lot of investment.  Also, how long does Critical Ascensi0n (the major/final skill in the Sniping tree last)? It gives you +5% damage and +6% crit damage per headshot you score with a sniper rifle, stacking up to 999 times but slowly fading. Does that mean it should last me entire missions, or does it fade within a minute or two of a battle?"
Borderlands,3c609p,ReverendHaze,3,Sun Jul 5 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"Right tree, bloodshed, is melee. Middle tree complements sniping quite well because of the kunai. Like you said, I retreat with Deception. Throwing out Kunai not only let's you mark enemies for death (10% extra damage I believe?) but also causes random elements. Trust me it's REALLY useful, you'll be spamming F like crazy once you get it"
Borderlands,3c609p,Xyanite,2,Sun Jul 5 13:21:22 2015 UTC,"The middle tree (cunning) isn't necessarily all that melee focused IMO, if you grab the right skills. My build is roughly (depending on class mod)   5/5 Fast hands  5/5 ambush   1/1 death mark (mostly for bosses/badasses until bl0ss0m)  5/5 rising sh0t  4/5 innervate  5/5 tw0 fang  1/1 bl0ss0m  You end up with a solid gun build with a lot of bonus damage on decepti0n (launcher out of deception ftw) and no particular melee focus, though rising sh0t w/ambush will do the trick in a pinch."

Borderlands,3c609p,VanillaCreamGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:49:54 2015 UTC,"Well, that's just how I personally built my Zer0. Besides for the BNK3R fight, I respeced into B0re for that.  Critical Ascensi0n is one of the strongest skills in the game. The stacks will start to fade within a handful of seconds without hitting a critical hit. The more stacks you have, the faster they will fade, but the 5-7 second downtime stays the same. With the Lyuda, I have no problem keeping my stacks pretty high, although that would be different if I was using a controller."

Borderlands,3c609p,ReverendHaze,0,Sun Jul 5 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'm doing pretty good with my melee Zer0, although I found Zer0 boring when I got halfway into TVHM. My build is mostly Bloodshed for the final skill MMF, and Cunning for Deathmark and kunai. You activate, throw kunai, melee, it seems to kill 95% of the time. Because of MMF your decoy deploys again and you can throw kunai again, rinse and repeat until all enemies have fallen."
Borderlands,3c609p,eurephys,3,Sun Jul 5 13:38:00 2015 UTC,"Zer0 is pretty squishy so you'll definitely need to consistently jump in and out of combat until you get MMF (assuming you're playing a melee zer0 as I did through normal), which makes him inherently non-""smooth"" to some extent. There are a couple great guides out there for how to play him melee though and they worked excellently for me until mid 40's (when I respeced to cunning for help with bosses that are difficult to defeat with only melee).  Broad strokes for easy mode melee zer0 in normal:  Get a rapier if you've got Scarlett's booty, it'll give you the largest melee bonus of any weapon and allow you to OHKO badasses more easily  Get a law/order or evisceration rubi for healing since zer0's ability based healing is pretty minimal  Check out Altair's guide for a build. The way melee damage is calculated means that some skills are significantly more important than others, so having the right skills makes a huge difference  Stab enemies in the crit points/back until dead  If melee isn't your thing, a cunning gun zer0 is also a hell of a lot of fun and kunai are the only reason I made it through TVHM. I can't speak for sniping since I haven't played it, but apparently it works as well.  Happy vault hunting."

If you're not into melee, then simply check out his Does It Suck? Series, where he tests out some known weapons. Zer0 is his main character, and he always shows his build and class mod, also it gives you a pretty cool insight on how to play really effective and smooth with Zer0.

Borderlands,3c609p,lightningrod14,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:56:22 2015 UTC,Roll with a torgue shotgun and maybe an SMG with a high elemental damage and a pair of snipers and you should be good.
Borderlands,3c609p,Fuegofucker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:15:25 2015 UTC,I would say go down the middle tree until you can reach the capstone of two trees.  Then definitely give melee Zer0 a shot.  Death Bl0ssom and Many Must Fall work really well together.  Then it's all about gear.  Love Thumper is a great roid shield for solo melee Zer0.  If you have the Tiny Tina DLC then I would go there for a grog nozzle.  Scarlett DLC for the Rapier and Pimpernel.

Borderlands,3c6n7c,FrootiousLoopious,3,Sun Jul 5 10:59:53 2015 UTC,"For ARs, I'd only recommend going for them if you're playing Axton, in which case, you should go for the Seeker.  SMGs, go for the Actualizer (AKA the slightly buffed Bitch).  Shield, go for Antagonist.  I would recommend the Blockade, but that's a drop from the Ancient Dragons of Destruction, one of the harder (IMO) raid bosses.  And if you're going for an explosive-centered Axton build, I'd get the Big Boom Blaster from Pyro Pete the Invincible.  It's a booster shield, but it's boosters also restore grenade and rocket ammo.  Aside from those, the Interfacer is pretty good on most builds, the slag variant of the Tattler is basically Slagga 2.0, and the Ahab is the best Torgue Launcher in the game and the strongest single-projectile Launcher (Norfleet is stronger overall, but that thing fires 3 projectiles).  Other than that... the Seraph weapons are niche weapons at best, and most legendaries and even some pearls are better than them.  For example, in a sheer DPS stance, Norfleet (Legendary) > Ahab (Seraph) and in practicality, Butcher (Pearl) > Interfacer (Seraph).  Figure out what fits your playing style and roll with it.  EDIT:  Left out a few words that completely changed a comparison."

Borderlands,3c6bhu,Almighteh,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:29:19 2015 UTC,"Personally, when I play starting a new character, I usually do either Torgue or Scarlet (just one) around level 15 and then Either the one I skipped or Tina (again just one) after the Warrior in NVHM (not a huge fan of Hammerlock's DLC so If I do that one it's always in later playthroughs) with the understanding that I'll be overleveled for the next few quests after each.    In TVHM, it's usually whichever ones I feel like doing (any/all) after beating the Warrior. Here it doesnt matter as much since EXP gets gimped at lvl 50 in TVHM, so even doing them all you'll max out at ~lvl 55ish. I just keep in mind that since my gear will cap at 50, I either need to grab a golden chest gun or two or else be prepared for a more difficult start in UVHM.    Then UVHM it doesnt matter because everything scales to you regardless."

Borderlands,3c3eng,Robot_Drew,3,Sat Jul 4 15:56:39 2015 UTC,So i guess if it's a chance related skill it would be useless but if it's a damage or direct number correlation it is useful.

( the o2 kits wouldn't make to much sense seeing as their is no space missions) but yea bl2 would deff be better.  That doesn't however excuse the fact that tps is filled with vanilla and forgettable npc's, amd next to no variation in terrain (moon, more moon, or spaceship).   IMO even if you import the same npc's from bl2 to tps the game gets tremdously better. Think about it, Tiny Tina replaces pickle, replace Janey springs with one of the previous vault hunters, the game would be tremendously better  TL DR: yes, take bl2 characters and put them into tps and the game sucks less"

Borderlands,3c51cw,ijustwantcoffee,3,Mon Jul 6 04:06:51 2015 UTC,"TPS suffered from a good idea in terms of story, but bad execution due to the characters and pacing. I completely agree. Janey was boring when she wasn't creepy, Gladstone was extremely forgettable, Meriff was...""interesting"" but we didn't get nearly enough time with him, and Zarpedon needed more screentime. The characters that were already introduced in previous games were written much better than the new ones, who just felt shoehorned in.  Of course, those characters at times also suffered from bad execution. Jack's decent into madness could have been written better, Roland was pretty much a beta bitch most of the time, ""FRIENDZONING"", probably some other situations I'm forgetting.  Some of the completely new things TPS introduced wouldn't make sense when ported over (as great as lasers and O2 kits are), but the balancing and existing gameplay changes would vastly improve Borderlands 2 and make it far more replayable. Even the little things need to come over, like being able to jump over shockwave attacks. To my knowledge, can't do that with BL2's Constructors, for example."
Borderlands,3c51cw,sircarp,2,Sat Jul 4 21:46:39 2015 UTC,Going back to BL2 after the pre-sequel feels so clunky though. I don't care how they shoe-horn it in; but the double-jump/slam mechanic makes navigating so much better.

Borderlands,3c51cw,TrainerBlack2,3,Sat Jul 4 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, the Borderlands games all have their strengths and weaknesses.  Borderlands 1 had great balance and a decent story, but terrible loot balance (some weapons are absolute garbage, while some are so powerful (*cough*Sledge's Shotgun*cough*) that they can carry a character for 10-20 levels).  Borderlands 2 had a great story and decent loot balance, but terrible balancing in general.  (UVHM is unbalanced as fuck and the OP levels aren't much better.)  Borderlands:  The Pre-Sequel had great loot balance and decent balance in general, but the story... with Jack as my witness, THE STORY OF THE MAIN GAME IS AWFUL.  I mean, some NPCs were pretty good (Janey caught my interest) but most of the NPCs were forgetable at best and... hell, TPS pretty much damaged Lilith's ENTIRE FUCKING CHARACTER by making her directly responsible for the rise of Handsome Jack as an insane villain.  About the only bit of narrative in TPS that I feel is up to Borderlands standard is Claptastic Voyage, to the point to where, once I hit UVHM, I considered that the main story and only did the real main story to get to bosses with loot I wanted."
Borderlands,3c51cw,bughumbar,6,Sat Jul 4 22:37:36 2015 UTC,"TPS pretty much damaged Lilith's ENTIRE FUCKING CHARACTER by making her directly responsible for the rise of Handsome Jack as an insane villain   She's no more responsible than Roland, the Meriff, Springs, Pickle, Moxxi, or Zarpedon. Jack was well on his way to spiraling into supervillainy by the time TPS started. Lilith & co. may have sped it along, but if they didn't betray him and send him off the edge, I have no doubt that somebody else would have down the line."
Borderlands,3c51cw,TrainerBlack2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:36:08 2015 UTC,"I understand this, but did Roland, the Merrif, Moxxi, or Zarpedon punch the relic of Elpis's Vault into Jack's face?  Yes, Jack was falling off the slippery slope, but Lilith threw him down it at Mach 5 with a raging murder-on for the Vault Hunters to boot.  Lilith's involvement in Handsome Jack's decent into supervillainy doesn't excuse Jack from his actions in BL2 - it barely covers 1/8 of what Jack does - but it does, in my mind, make Lilith directly responsible for Handsome Jack being as bad as he is, making her indirectly responsible for every evil thing Hyperion did with Handsome Jack at the helm.  (However, Athena and the rest of the TPS Vault Hunters bear the same amount of responsibility.)"
Borderlands,3c51cw,RoadRunnerdn,2,Sat Jul 4 23:43:53 2015 UTC,"Well in terms of technical things TPS only improved upon BL2, but they shouldn't waste their time on it.  However I would love to see BL1 with the improved UI changes, movement/combat etc. That would be awesome, as long as they don't touch the balance and weapon system or anything else that made BL1 awesome."
Borderlands,3c51cw,Crowforge,2,Sun Jul 5 00:10:38 2015 UTC,"Make slag completely optional? Yes please!  Also I just started playing BL1 and I really like weapon proficiency.  Some things not to bring in, the slow leveling, the side quests should really be optional.  Horrible accents, apart from that gun that curses at you, I hated 'em and couldn't understand half of them."
Borderlands,3c51cw,Edgecution,6,Sun Jul 5 00:17:18 2015 UTC,Yea... 2k AUS really went overboard with the Aussie stuff. All the cockney sayings and stuff were just gibberish and frankly annoying.
Borderlands,3c51cw,8988303682,6,Sun Jul 5 01:51:33 2015 UTC,"I honestly think slag was an amazing addition to the game, and I'm disappointed it was replaced by such a brainless element in TPS.   Slag promoted more complicated strategies and thinking to take down enemies. And slag was not difficult to apply. Even if you don't want to switch weapons, there are grenades, skills, and even shields that are capable of slagging opponents.  With the cryo element, it would completely immobilize enemies (even some bosses) and would greatly buff it's own damage. You could just shoot at an enemy until he freezes, and then continue to shoot until they're dead."
Borderlands,3c51cw,8988303682,6,Sun Jul 5 00:58:21 2015 UTC,Slag promoted more complicated strategies and thinking   apparently shooting a guy once with slag every 10 seconds and then mag dumping with a DP Harold is a complicated strategy that involves thinking

It hurts BL2's variety and diversity in loadouts, and mostly everyone blasted through UVHM by slagging and spamming DP Harold. Otherwise, UVHM would have been even more of a chore to play through, and that's not what a game should be."
Borderlands,3c51cw,Fuegofucker,2,Sun Jul 5 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"The problem is that slag is always the best option. If it acted in stacks rather than duration, it may have provided more compelling gameplay."

Did that quest yesterday and killed the thing too fast I couldn't even enjoy the song, stupid Nisha too OP.

Borderlands,3c4nhz,DaRk_INCOG,2,Sat Jul 4 19:11:40 2015 UTC,"Are you running in borderless windowed mode? This leads to your game running at the same priority as other programs you have running which can cause some issues if you have stuff in the background.  Try switching to full screen or you can give the process higher priority in the task manager. In the task manager (shortcut ctrl + shift + esc) click processes and press the button ""show processes from all users"" in the bottom left. Then find the borderlands process, right click->set priority->realtime then it will give the process the same processing power as if you ran it in fullscreen."

Borderlands,3c4nhz,Stinkis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:52:45 2015 UTC,"Aha, that makes a lot of sense. The problem can be that you are running out of RAM, you can check RAM usage in task manager. When you get to 80% or so, windows starts to store the oldest parts of your RAM to something called a ""swap file"" basically it writes the old unused RAM assets to the hard drive. If the drive that contains the swap file is full this works poorly and you will have longer delays while waiting for the hard disk to write causing lag. Using the swap file is slower and might still cause some lag, try closing background programs to get more free ram for the game."

If you want to reload them you just click in the window and it reloads the homepage. Really saved me a lot of trouble since I always have a lot of tabs open.
Borderlands,3c2mjl,ReverendEarthwormJim,57,Sat Jul 4 04:35:42 2015 UTC,Well correct me if I'm wrong but aren't there like 4 sirens in the universe we don't know of? After The death of Angel and that Steele woman from the Crimson Lance there should be two little babies who have siren abilities we can add to the roster of unknown sirens. Are new sirens born immediately after a previous one dies or is there just a maximum of six and Angel's death just opens up another spot on the list?
Borderlands,3c2mjl,AlphaMuffin,32,Sat Jul 4 05:16:57 2015 UTC,"There's no evidence one way or another (that I'm aware of), but I always assumed it was like Avatar. The instant the previous one dies, the new one is born."
Borderlands,3c2mjl,Iron_Evan,7,Sat Jul 4 06:29:51 2015 UTC,I figured it was like 6 MAXIMUM. That the other ones have yet to be born or show up or whatever.
Borderlands,3c2mjl,PriestmanX,29,Sat Jul 4 08:49:07 2015 UTC,"According to lilliths origin comic, she was already a few years old when a siren told her what she was and promptly died.

Borderlands,3c2mjl,Eternity42Immensity,6,Sat Jul 4 11:28:48 2015 UTC,"Remember comics are also completely non-canon to the game universe and vice versa so theoretically the ""6 at a time rule"" may not apply to the comics unless specifically stated; as well as the ""pass on"" phenomenon does not nessecarily apply to the game. Edit: That scenario actually does not apply to the games at all, as in the game universe Sirens are born with their powers, as explained by Handsome Jack (the father of one)."
Borderlands,3c2mjl,branden3710,2,Sat Jul 4 15:00:16 2015 UTC,"I know it's splitting hairs, but even in the comics, Lilith isn't born with the powers? I mean, that is how the elder siren finds her.  She's just dormant (no tattoos) until the elder siren dies."

Borderlands,3c2mjl,Madomb01,32,Sat Jul 4 22:21:05 2015 UTC,"What we know: There can only be 6 Sirens at any given time. Lilith, Maya, Angel, and Commandant Steele are/were all Sirens. That leaves two previously existing but undiscovered Sirens that we don't know anything about. Angel and Commandant Steele are both dead as dicks.    Now we've got speculation. If they continue only introducing 1 siren per game, we can have 2 more games before they run out of preexisting Sirens. Whatever cosmic mechanisms ensuring that no more than 6 Sirens exist at any given time may also ensure that no fewer than 6 Sirens exist at any given time. Since Angel and Commandant Steele are dead as dicks as previously noted, new Sirens may have been born at the moment of their death, making sure the number stays 6. Therefore, if the pattern of 5 year gaps between games continues, the Siren who replaced Steele will be 20 years old by the time BL5 comes out (which will be when they have run out of the previously noted Sirens to introduce), and the Siren who will replace Angel will also be 20 by the time of BL6.  Thus, if the games continue the trend of introducing one new Siren and killing off an old in each entry of the main series, we will never run out."
Borderlands,3c2mjl,coldermoss,12,Sat Jul 4 05:17:15 2015 UTC,Yeah but that I doubt there's going to be 6 Borderlands games and who says they are going to age with our time?
Borderlands,3c2mjl,Spookeds,6,Sat Jul 4 09:49:00 2015 UTC,Supposedly the Chinese Borderlands MMO is also supposed to have a Siren. Though I'm not sure that will even be canon at all.

Borderlands,3c2mjl,bughumbar,19,Sat Jul 4 07:23:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair to say that aspect is non-canon by default, after all you can have four Sirens in the core series when playing multiplayer."

Borderlands,3c2mjl,MisterDeath_,2,Sat Jul 4 17:35:41 2015 UTC,"In the game during both co-op AND single player, the story progresses like all four non-dlc playable characters are present. there are occasional verbal cues throughout the dialogue. Even when four people are playing Maya, or Lilith, the story still pretends there is one of each. Because that's how the actual story goes. It would be less enjoyable if only one character was allowed in co-op, which is for playability, not for the story."
Borderlands,3c2mjl,Taggrin,2,Sat Jul 4 16:22:40 2015 UTC,"Easy fix - one of the corporations learns a way to artificially infuse Siren abilities into a subject.

Borderlands,3c2mjl,Concoelacanth,6,Sat Jul 4 10:53:07 2015 UTC,I think that's what hyperion was trying to accomplish with the slag injections in the second game.

Borderlands,3c2mjl,Eternity42Immensity,4,Sat Jul 4 06:58:44 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, I feel like it must be the Watcher alien, since we were just going through a bunch of Eridian Guardians and the similarity is pretty noticeable. Plus, I feel like of all the colorful adjectives Jack could use to describe Lilith at that point, ""creepy"" would be near the bottom of the list. Plus, if you listen to Zarpedon and Best's ECHO logs on the descent to Eleseer, they talk about the Watcher a lot. That, and everything about the Watcher really is pretty damn creepy.  On the other hand we only see it once at the beginning of the game and it's possible to miss those ECHOs so in that way it feels weird that Jack would even think it showing up would be a possibility.  edit: more food for thought - I've never heard anybody refer to a person with red hair as a ""red one"". Redhead, maybe, but that's just weird phrasing."
Borderlands,3c2mjl,KingRufus01,-4,Sat Jul 4 07:32:58 2015 UTC,What? I don't think you've played TPS. There is a big red alien with some kind of mind powers.

Borderlands,3c2mjl,childshMan-He-Bro,4,Sat Jul 4 11:03:01 2015 UTC,"Well Jack states that only 6 sirens can exist in the universe at a time. We know of four: Lilith, Maya, Angel, and Steele However, two are dead, Steele got impaled and Angel was killed in BL2. So that leaves room for four more to show up.

Borderlands,3c2mjl,ijustwantcoffee,5,Sat Jul 4 04:46:08 2015 UTC,"The ""number of sirens"" question came up a few months ago. I think people assume there must be six. IIRC, Jack says there ""can only be six in the universe."" In my opinion, this means there can be anywhere from 0-6 sirens alive. We've known of four (Lillith, Steele, Maya, and Angel) and two have died (Steele and Angel). This leave a possibility of having four more sirens in the universe after the events of BL2. IF there are always six sirens, two of them wouldn't be older than 5 years old. The ending of TPS suggests BL3 will take place right after BL2. I'm not convinced we will ever see all six sirens alive at the same time even--again--IF there are actually six alive at the same time"
Borderlands,3c2mjl,Bear_Taco,9,Sat Jul 4 12:34:11 2015 UTC,"IF there are always six sirens, two of them wouldn't be older than 5 years old.    Unless people aren't born as sirens. It could be the case that when an existing siren dies, the siren power is ""transferred"" to another living person somewhere in the universe or some sort of dormant siren ability is awakened. That way somebody who is say 20 years old might suddenly develop siren powers when Steele/Angel dies.   That would allow the developers to introduce new adult sirens and give a solid reason for their powers to be undeveloped at the beginning of the game.  Either way I'd quite like the idea of a younger protagonist taken out of her ""siren training"". Maya's audio logs show that she was raised by that cult or whoever they were and trained to use her siren powers so it might be cool to play as a renegade teen siren who ran away when she found out she had powers."
Borderlands,3c2mjl,AJockeysBallsack,4,Sat Jul 4 12:52:36 2015 UTC,"Someone posted a comic of an old Siren talking to Lilith. Seems that the abilities pass on to ""seeds"" when one dies. So we're always at 6 Sirens, new ones with varying age"

The universe is a huge fucking place, so huge that by the time you get from one end to the other the entire galaxy you left could have been destroyed.  So it's clearly not possible to account for every siren simultaneously while also accounting for every non-siren.  Does that mean that sirens are an articial creation and the 6 cap was placed by the creator?

At the end of The Pre Sequel, we get some exposition and one of the things said by someone refers to 'all the Vault Hunters you can get.' Sorry, trying not to spoil it, so what we need is a character creator, like, a real one. As it begins you will pick a 'Mentor', a Vault Hunter from Borderlands 1-Pre Sequel, (excluding Nisha and Wilhelm, for obvious reasons) and you will take on a variation of their action skill. You will then create the look of your character, and   begin learning from your mentor. From there the game follows the plot!  I really like my idea, do you? I know I do! ;P"

Borderlands,3c0lph,Noelwijker,9,Tue Jul 7 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"This weapon has a unique characteristic, that I'm sure you're all aware of, where when you reload it, it will seek out the nearest enemy and continue to shoot them before exploding. These shots can be buffed by wearing the Bee, making this throw reload among the most powerful. Also, for Zer0 players, these shots also receive the gun damage boost from Deception, leading to some extraordinary damage, and yes, this does stack with the Bee.  I bring this up because whenever a Weapon Discussion is brought up, Krieg and Axton are always the 2 Vault Hunters recommended to use those weapons. However, for this particular gun, I recommend giving it a go on Zer0, and see how it suits you"
Borderlands,3c0lph,_sLAUGHTER234,5,Fri Jul 3 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"The reload also benefits from B0re in addition to amp damage. Both MOLMF and Joltzude have done videos of that.  I haven't really noticed that much of either Krieg nor Axton in the weapon discussions compared to other characters; there have been a lot of comments saying ""this is great for Salvador"", ""this is great for Maya"" etc. as well. Regarding the Deliverance however, it's not really that special for either of them: Tediore shotguns are generally inferior to pistols and SMGs for reload damage, and DPS-wise it's outclassed by the Blockhead and Omen, both of which have more synergy with grenade damage and Blood Bath. Zer0 imo has the most synergy with it for three reasons: 1.) his high reload speeds, 2.) his ability to hold onto amp bonuses for extended periods of time, and most importantly, 3.) B0re."

There's something oddly satisfying about watching the gun fly around and shoot shit for you, especially since it doesn't feel like the game is being played for you; after all, you worked hard to find it to begin with. It's also a pretty good shotgun in general, thanks to the raw stats granted by orange quality."

Borderlands,3bzzux,TrainerBlack2,27,Sat Jul 4 23:07:29 2015 UTC,Personaly. The saddest for me may have been when the skipper died. It was the worst for me because I had to pull the trigger.

Borderlands,3bzzux,scotiej,-12,Fri Jul 3 15:08:24 2015 UTC,That wasn't so bad. It was Roland's death immediately following that was really touching. I guess it was just strange to see jack show emotion.
Borderlands,3bzzux,hawkman561,22,Fri Jul 3 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"Dude, Jack shows emotion throughout the entire story. That's one of the reasons I love him as a villain. He actively taunts you the whole story, and generally is very involved. He definitely shows more emotion than most villains."

Borderlands,3bzzux,mginatl,18,Fri Jul 3 20:58:40 2015 UTC,It's a tie between TTAoDK when Tiny Tina begins to acknowledge Roland's death and the end of the Claptastic Voyage when Jack murders all of the claptrap units.

Borderlands,3bzzux,thepiltdownman,14,Fri Jul 3 20:00:38 2015 UTC,"I interpreted it differently, though it's probably just as sad.  It's how Claptrap thinks those other people look at and think of him. He's so despised by his friends that it's ruined his self-worth to the point where he believes Janey, literally the nicest person in the series, secretly hates him. Even though she treats him just as nice as any of the others (well, except maybe Athena)."

Borderlands,3bzzux,Seytai,6,Sat Jul 4 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"Borderlands 1 has... well, General Knoxx.  Basically the ultimate example of a disgruntled, apathetic, and suicidal employee being stuck at the bottom of the food chain, unable to move up.  And then you have to kill him.  The Pre-Sequel has The Skipper.  This one was made worse by two facts - One, I play as Claptrap, and Clappy feels guilt (or as close to guilt as he can feel, being a robot) over the act.  And two, the missions involving Ego-TP in Claptastic Voyage, where the aforementioned guilt basically tells Claptrap that he isn't the hero he thinks he is.  And with Borderlands 2, there's the death of Angel and when Tina has to face up to Roland's death.  Whenever I bring these up, however, people always ask me ""What about Roland's death?""  While I genuinely care for Roland as an ally... yeah, I didn't like him too much.  Considering all the hype I heard from BL1 fans about how Roland was so badass... I wasn't too impressed with his BL2 appearance."
Borderlands,3bzzux,TrainerBlack2,3,Sat Jul 4 03:21:37 2015 UTC,"The fact that he got one-shotted from behind made me hate his death.

If you want a Banzai Wilhelm, take the middle tree with every cybernetic enhancement.  Right tree is more tactical than you might like.  Something like this at level 16, this at level 25, this at level 30, and finally this at level 36.  You release the drones, then charge in at a run, taking full advantage of First to Fight while you have it, ideally freezing an enemy right away and giving it the Power Fist.  Kill before you are killed.  Blitz or Colossal Terminator classmod.  Eventually you'll want Cold War, but wait until you have Termination Protocols and perhaps Zero Hour.  Cold War synergizes very nicely with the Vengeance Cannon and Termination Protocols.  Then you can roll Cryo-Terminator instead of Blitz Terminator, if you like.  Alternately, play Athena.

Borderlands,3byrqm,DekuNut,5,Fri Jul 3 06:53:29 2015 UTC,"This is about what i figured. Anywhere you go in BL, BL2, even TftBL, there's massive skeletons with huge, sharp, predator's teeth draped all over chunks of the landscape. There's hundreds of lava worm skeletons of various sizes all over the world, all discarded. Skag cranial bones are so ubiquitous it's almost as if collecting them on Pandora is stylish. I know the insanely massive one in Titan's End is shaped too oddly to be a skag, and perish the though it might be a bullymong, or worse, a giant stalker. Picture every Godzilla movie where the giant mutant dinosaur can cloak. But don't get me started lying on what the holy hell those big fin-headed monstrosities are in the frozen north. Those certainly had to come from somewhere. And with all of them bearing some close proximity to those border guns, it makes me wonder.  It kinda made sense this way. Skags eat everything, and they keep growing the more they eat, this makes them the carp of the world. For Rakk to have a biological imperative to make that hideous vagina-faced hive at three to four stories tall, they're certainly not at the top of the food chain. Even the Warrior points in this direction. There has to be a reason Eridans made a giant six-legged stone dinosaur with an axe at the tip of it's tail--the tail that spits slag, in case it does run into something bigger than it on the world. And with the world all too ready to grow things like Crawmerax, Vermivorous, Terramorphous, and Dexiduous, the odds of that happening are pretty good."

Borderlands,3c0cia,dreddfyre,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:18:14 2015 UTC,"I would say that's the primary factor between the two.  TPS is fun, especially with the slamming mechanic, but BL2 offers way more to go back to time and time again."

I gave up on TPS after playing Athena to level ~40. BL2 till I die."
Borderlands,3c0cia,Parks_Blackwell,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:36:49 2015 UTC,Why did you give up on TPS?
Borderlands,3c0cia,CriticalFaceTime,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:39:41 2015 UTC,"Several reasons. The skill trees were more fun, but I didn't like the capstone of ceraunic storm, which was basically the main reason I picked Athena; in order to replicate the experience I had playing maya (bae). Not being able to farm for the drops I wanted was probably the biggest reason. I also didn't like the atmosphere as much, which as fun and futuresque as it was, didn't quite feel the same to me, as the interesting, playable environments of the game were so starkly contrasted from the rest of the barren moon, that I very rarely found myself simply exploring and finding interesting things. Maybe I just didn't play enough, but I liked the areas like southpaw steam and power, and the friendship gulag, and the most secret place I ever found was Iwajira's den, which lost it's charm after I farmed him like 1000 times.The music as per my own mistake also gave me a bad experience; I never turned the volume down, so the ambiance of the music was totally lost. On the other hand, I could actually hear the dialogue during cutscenes which was pretty cool. I guess I liked the story about the same, because as much as people complain about the writing it really wasn't that different, and unlike BL2 you actually start getting more interesting gear at an earlier point. I didn't mind the side quests either as quirky and Australian as they were, probably because I was playing with my friend, and had someone to share my confusion with whenever we met a jolly swagman or fought through a hail of gunfire in order to collect a snicket ball.   TL;DR, fun for the whole family, but always left me craving more BL2."

But I absolutely freakin' love Claptrap, Aurelia, and Dopple-Jack's skill trees. They're just so much more fun to play with than the BL2 heroes' skill trees, to me. Can't shake off the awesome Buttslam and Jet pack thing, too.  Really hard choice. I like the general balancing between you, the weapons, and the enemy more in TPS too. Hm. General Story and Environment you go through though is just such a big thing for me that I just can't decide between the two."
Borderlands,3bxmf2,CopperTalon,18,Fri Jul 3 00:14:00 2015 UTC,"Deadlift is one of the tougher bosses imo, his stupid jumping about is really frustrating but you should keep playing, the game's still very fun, don't let an early annoying boss put you off, the game does get pretty exciting about halfway through."
Borderlands,3bxmf2,RMoCGLD,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:39:45 2015 UTC,"Ah this boss. Soooo annoying. Played it solo and died like 30 times, played it with my bro and beat it on the fourth or fifth try. Very poorly designed boss. It isn't even fun or satisfying, it just makes you angry."
Borderlands,3bxmf2,mardfet,10,Sat Jul 4 13:42:36 2015 UTC,"The pre-sequel isn't as good as BL2, however it is still decent and you should play it if you're interested in Handsome Jack's history. Also, the Claptastic Voyage DLC is fantastic. The length is around the same as BL1 for the main storylines of both (that is, not as long as BL2, but still pretty long).    That said, Soloing the borderlands games have always required you to do some level of side questing, and TPS is the same. So, if you haven't done any, do a couple. Specifically, there's a sidequest for Janey that has a Shock sniper rifle as a reward. Use the sniper and aim for Deadlift's backpack or head and you should take him down fairly easily. Of course, you'll have an easier time with some characters more so than others. (Wilhelm, Jack, or Nisha should be fairly easy to win with, Clappy and Athena a bit harder in those early levels in my experience).    I think deadlift is somewhat of a test boss to make sure you've got the mechanics down before you start the game, and the bosses after him are a bit easier."
Borderlands,3bxmf2,Sir_Randy_Butternubs,3,Fri Jul 3 00:45:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I never played BL1, and I actually picked ClapTrap as my first character here. I think I'll start up a Wilhelm and do that sidequest as well."
Borderlands,3bxmf2,Sir_Randy_Butternubs,4,Fri Jul 3 01:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Wilhelm and Jack are both pet classes so you can use you action skill to attack while remaining under cover, and Nisha has the aimbot skill so you can wreck face without trying. Clappy gets good later though if you're going down the explosives tree, with a purple ravager Claptrap can bring a tear to even Mr. Torgue's eye.    The story length with sidequests is ~25-30 hours-ish for NVHM. Maybe a bit longer if you go for full side-quest completion."
Borderlands,3bxmf2,tony14,2,Fri Jul 3 01:28:20 2015 UTC,I did a solo with Wilhelm and enjoyed it. I would be lame and rely on Wolf to do most of the work during tough fights.
Borderlands,3bxmf2,cannons_for_days,8,Fri Jul 3 04:13:07 2015 UTC,"friends tell me it should have been BL2 DLC, as its tremendously short story involving characters that have been killed in BL2 can't hold itself up as an individual title quite as well as other games.   TPS would not have worked as DLC for BL2, and it stands on its own as a solid game in its own right anyway.  It makes fundamental changes to the way the game plays and establishes its own gaming experience which I personally feel is very distinct from BL2.   Cryo damage.  Instead of Slag weapons, TPS has Cryo.  Introducing an entire elemental damage type as a DLC would have... issues.  I like Cryo better than slag - it's crowd control and a damage bonus wrapped up in a single package.  Its damage bonus is both simultaneously more selective than slag's and more forgiving because you don't always need to swap weapons to get access to the bonus damage.  It's unfortunate that it's weak against shields, but it's still quite fun to freeze something and then shatter it with a butt slam.  Which brings me to.... Low-gravity and butt slams!  Low-gravity areas are obviously selective and could have been added as specific parts of DLC, but the fact that so much of TPS happens in low-g areas is part of what gives it is charm.  Moreover, butt slams are baked into TPS, making it something difficult to ""just add to a DLC"" - even when you're not in low-g, you can still butt slam by double-jumping (see note below).  They supplement melee and ranged builds quite excellently - melee because they give you AoE, and ranged because they give you something you can do to the dude in your face while you're reloading.  This new tactic changes the way combat flows - instead of backing up and chucking a grenade when melee enemies (like torks) are swarming you, you can butt slam spam them. The double jump.  TPS has a design philosophy that makes you want to explore the area vertically in addition to just horizontally.  To do this, they give you low-g areas and a piece of gear that lets you double-jump.  In TPS, the double-jump is a huge exploration tool, and many of the maps on Elpis or Helios would be totally boring without it.  Even though there are fewer maps in TPS and some of those maps are smaller, there's still tons of nooks and crannies to explore because you aren't limited to a 5-foot clearance.  (This is also why most of the maps in TPS don't give you vehicle access - they want to force you to explore with that double-jump.) Skill point philosophy.  In BL2, skill trees are laid out differently, and sometimes almost haphazardly.  Every character has a 1-point ""game-changer"" skill in the middle of each tree, but each character also has 5-point skills on that tier, so you can skip that game-changer.... which is good, because in some trees, that skill is crap.  (I'm looking at you, Cataclysm! >_<)  In TPS, that 1-point skill is the only skill in that tier, and after you pick it, the next tier opens up immediately.  This does two things:  it makes the capstone of each tree easier to acquire without devaluing skill points, and it puts a much bigger emphasis on those game-changer skills.  It means no one will ""accidentally"" skip something as important to a build as Discord (the major burst damage tool for Ordered Chaos Gaige) in favor of making sure all the skills they select are maxed out.  It also means you can have two different capstones at level 50, and all three capstones at level 70 without completely homogenizing builds because there are still powerful skill combos you're missing out on if you shoot for all the capstones.  Quite simply, it is elegant design. Scaling.  Borderlands 2 has this ridiculous exponential scaling factor going on in the higher levels (really starts to rear its head 40+) which makes damage values outstrip health values and causes your gear to age much quicker.  TPS has that same exponential scaling happening, but the individual factors were more fine-tuned so that it is no longer the case that entering UVHM at level 51 is a near death-sentence.  They've also changed some of the independent values in UVHM to make enemies less bullet-sponge-y, which makes the whole affair much more playable, if you ask me.  It hasn't made things easier, just less tedious.   Taken together, I think TPS is just a better gaming experience.  I can see how someone who really fell in love with the story of BL2 would be disappointed with the story of TPS, but I have always felt that the tone and theme of the Borderlands series was its strength more than its story, and that tone is definitely intact in TPS."

You can shoot away his orbs that come at you, if you buttslam him it stuns him, and his backpack is a critical spot.  The best advice would be to just level up a level or 2.  Honestly nothing in this game is really that hard with any character once you learn said enemies movement and attack patterns."
Borderlands,3bxmf2,MegaZambam,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:19:33 2015 UTC,"I just started TVHM with my Athena, and I didn't realize how under leveled my weapons were until deadlift. Most enemies I can hit with a melee and they bleed out not long after that. Fucking Deadlift is a bitch and a half with my current setup."
Borderlands,3bxmf2,johhnymayhem,8,Fri Jul 3 05:04:18 2015 UTC,"As for BL2 versus TPS - I for one prefer TPS.  I found TPS to be more balanced.  Let me explain a bit about what I didn't like about BL2.  What I didn't like about BL2 was that certain weapons and items were god mode, and were practically necessary to kill things like Terramorphous.  Whereas if you didn't have those guns/items everything was immensely more difficult solely by not having the best shit.  Boo.  TPS, there doesn't seem to be any god mode weapons or items, you can grab just about any old gun or shield of green quality or better, or even white in a pinch and things will not be ridiculously difficult just because you don't have an orange weapon or worse, the correct orange weapon for that particular situation.  Blah.  I feel like TPS was a return to BL1 in that regards, where items/guns weren't a make or break the game, you could get by on whatever.  Legendary shit was nice and hilarious and yeah definitely helped make some things easier, but at the same time if you only had a blue or purple you could still wreck face just at a marginally slower pace.  Also what I enjoyed about BL1, it seemed like pretty much any orange gun was great/fun to use, whereas in BL2 there were only certain ones whereas others were shit.  Like, Double Penetrating Unkempt Harold and that sandhawk (?) SMG was the tits and fuck everything else.  I nearly used nothing but those weapons and it gets tiresome and boring to be stuck using the same weapons in a game that flaunts loudly about it has a bajillion different guns.  And there wasn't a sniper rifle, assault rifle, or shotgun (i think) that was anywhere nearly effective as those two guns.  Conference call was pretty baller but they nerfed the hell out of it and fuck that gun anyway, I never saw one despite playing 500 hours or what the fuck ever ridiculous number I played.  TPS, I can use sniper rifles and assault rifles and be effective again.  There's no SMG or pistol that's so overwhelming good that renders other weapon classes woefully inefficient/inadequate.  What raid boss in BL2 could you kill using sniper rifles, for instance?  Whereas in TPS, holy balls, the Baroness is ridiculous and seems to be waaaay better of a sniper class than Zer0 was.  Crit hit damage out the wazoo, and a skill that grants more damage the further you are from a target - yes please.  Nisha's pretty good with a sniper rifle too, but with her insta lock on skill, fuck it rapid fire and lasers are the way to go.  Anyway, rambling now."
Borderlands,3bxmf2,johhnymayhem,2,Fri Jul 3 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"Uh, hm, I would suggest you were doing something wrong.  RPG 101 - if you can't kill something, go level up.  i.e. do all the side quests, kill all the people/monsters you can in the first two areas, save and quit, repeat.  RPG 201 - maybe you were not using the best class for you.  e.g. trying to solo TPS with Nisha is pretty difficult.  Although I say that and I think I killed Deadlift easiest with Nisha because I used her action skill and a sniper rifle from afar and just blasted the fuck out of him.  Killing Deadlift:  He is super susceptible to electric weapons, use them.  One of the first side quests can give you a nice electric sniper rifle with which you can blast the fuck out of him from afar.  All my easiest times killing Deadlift was from a distance rather than anything else."
Borderlands,3bxmf2,Weltall548,2,Fri Jul 3 02:19:57 2015 UTC,TPS's bosses are much more frustrating than 2's.
Borderlands,3bxmf2,tinverse,2,Fri Jul 3 13:43:27 2015 UTC,This is the BL sub and so you're going to see a lot of people telling you to keep going. I personally wouldn't. I really don't like TPS. I didn't find any of the characters fun and I have no idea what happened in the storymode. I prefer BL2's gameplay. If you're just playing it for the story I'd just watch a playthrough or read a summery.  I'm really looking forward to battle born and BL3 though.
Borderlands,3bxmf2,johhnymayhem,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:24:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, real quick, also what I really appreciate about TPS (but doesn't mean jack all if you're playing solo..sorry), there are a lot of team skills again.  Like in BL2, there wasn't much in the way of team interaction skills, but in TPS pretty much everyone but Nisha had things you could do to benefit the team.  Like Wilhelm could heal and overcharge granting ammo regen and a speed boost.  Athena also had team healing capabilities and could insta-revive.  Fragtrap and Baroness both had entire skill trees that emphasized cooperative play.  Good stuff."

Borderlands,3bxmf2,Drumbas,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:07:04 2015 UTC,Deadlift is one of the hardest bosses id say once you get some good laser guns the game gets reasonably easy. The game is definitely worth it and the only time if really struggled was with the final boss of the Claptrap dlc. As a follow up to this id say the games strongest point is the Claptrap dlc so even if you hate the entire game I think you could still enjoy it because of the dlc.

The Tiny Tina DLC is basically the best DLC ever and everyone should play it. The Pirate DLC is basically irrelevant to TPS, but I guess its sort of fun. I didn't really like it, but a lot of people do. So I'd advise playing through the main quests of the Torgue and Hammerlock DLC's, and you should do everything in the Tiny Tina DLC. All the DLC's should be played after the main campaign."

As for Borderlands 1: Play at the very least the General Knoxx DLC, that one introduces at least one very important character to the franchise.

Borderlands,3bvfzs,Akiekintveld,7,Thu Jul 2 21:55:53 2015 UTC,"Ridiculous(ly) amazing, yes. Melee zero can  one hit almost every enemy in the game. Sniper zero is amazing if you can get critical hits. General gun zero probably won't be able to solo raid bosses, but you'll be able to easily mob and kill non-raid bosses. It's not all about the special (which is amazing in its own right for the skills that apply to it), it's about the skills that you use and the gear you choose. The special gives you multiplicative gun damage and an out of most situations. But he isn't for some people."

Borderlands,3bvfzs,Huntswomen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:14:48 2015 UTC,"Wait how do you defeat raidbosses as Zer0 then? Is it only doable as melee? Or did ""gun Zer0"" not include Sniper Zer0?"
Borderlands,3bvfzs,Akiekintveld,2,Fri Jul 3 01:17:07 2015 UTC,Melee zero can do it fairly easily. Sniper zero is generally different from gun zero. Sniper zero can do it because of critical ascension.
Borderlands,3bvfzs,TwitchyUncleC,2,Fri Jul 3 01:30:58 2015 UTC,"Zer0 is my favorite. Specifically melee Zer0. Think about this... in Borderlands 1 we had a berserker who would put his guns away and punch. He was the melee character. In Borderlands 2 the soldier is soldier and the siren is siren. The berserker is now the gunzerker and is no longer the melee class. The sniper of the game is now the melee class. Now that can just sound terribly wrong to some people. I find it very interesting.  I love being a sniper but that was what I did wrong in both Borderlands 1 and 2. Focusing on the sniper skill trees would cause you to ignore your action skill. I feel like the action skills are what really separate Borderlands from other shooters when it comes to game play. I wasn't a believer in melee Zer0 at first. But I gave it a shot when The Handsome Collection brought me back to Borderlands 2. And I never looked back. Also, once you get to about level 56 you can reach the capstone of two skill trees. Once you understand the synergy of having Death Bl0ss0m (kunai) and Many Must Fall you will understand the potential of melee Zer0. And at level 72 you will be able to get both those capstones and B0re. Super fun build to play.  It's not for everyone.  But you never know until you try."

Borderlands,3bu8sw,AwesomeDakka,2,Thu Jul 2 07:59:38 2015 UTC,"the game has some class  has some class  class   we're talking about a game that mainly consists of murdering people for cash and weapons, main NPCs who are inbred and others who are practically strippers, and that has an unspoken obligation to include the word ""badass"" in every other sentence. Hammerlock is the only sliver of class in the series"
Borderlands,3bu8sw,Skyrowind,3,Fri Jul 3 02:37:03 2015 UTC,I think it's comedic value

Borderlands,3bu8sw,DigbyMayor,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:36:53 2015 UTC,Dude I try to forget that line because there's a huge pause between Lillith and Jacks lines. It sounds way too scripted. One of the worst cases in the game too. Also when you first meet ellie she freezes for a couple seconds and finally talks.
Borderlands,3bu8sw,v3xx,3,Fri Jul 3 01:41:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was meant to be Jack cutting her off. I'm pretty sure she left the sentence open ended on purpose, then Jack said ""Language"" as a sort of ""Don't even think about it"""

Borderlands,3bu8sw,v3xx,5,Thu Jul 2 19:10:14 2015 UTC,Nope. Too much violence.
Borderlands,3bu8sw,IAMA_IronMan,6,Thu Jul 2 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"The point there is that [spoilers] Jack tells her off for swearing, so it's been mostly drilled into her, but she has the occasional slip."

Borderlands,3bu8sw,yubh810,2,Thu Jul 2 20:31:32 2015 UTC,"I think its part of the humor, like how angel is always correcting herself when she swears in BL2, swearing is frowned upon while every other horrible crime against humanity is perfectly fine"

Borderlands,3buc0m,MrWiffles,11,Thu Jul 2 05:34:23 2015 UTC,"New Rarities! Tales From The Borderlands gave me a good idea!  Vintage Weapons: New rarity, mostly Atlas stuff, but some other manufacturer's stuff too. Extremely rare and valuable, but also a bit more powerful than Legendarys and Pearls, like the difference between Legendarys and Purples in Borderlands 1. I think that would add a new and appealing rarity to the game and be fairly interesting.  Next! Makeshift Weapons: The manufacturers often get to see others designs so sometimes, they enjoy to copycat those weapons, this would be in pretty special occasion, but if you were to get a World Drop from sayyy, a Hyperion Loader and he drops an Unkempt Harold, it would have nullified stats for being Makeshift but also have that Manufacturer's weapon attributes (Increased Accuracy when firing). SO you could have a Tediore Conference Call that throw reloads.  Tell me what you think :D!"
Borderlands,3buc0m,JacePlaysGames,2,Thu Jul 2 06:16:21 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of vintage weapons, sounds amazing, maybe a bronze-ish for the item beam color. (I dunno why the quality color is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of new qualities) I also think this could be a way for S&S to make a comeback, as vintage weapons. Although, I think vintages, if they were to be added, should be something like a high-end purple or a low-end legendary, damage-wise."
Borderlands,3buc0m,Mytherio,2,Thu Jul 2 07:15:11 2015 UTC,"Or, the vintage idea could just be like, a line of guns that all are in pearlescent quality, but the name of the gun is ""Vintage ______"".   Also, they need to make pearlescents that don't suck."

Borderlands,3buc0m,fzf97,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"Something like that, yes. Our instead of already existing guns there could be some new ones we've never used before like Sasha's Atlas Silver from Tales From The Borderlands, she's the one who gave me the Idea of vintage guns, and now come to think of it, there could be vintage shields. Infinite possibility."
Borderlands,3buc0m,JacePlaysGames,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:08:31 2015 UTC,"Aftermarket and bandit weapons already exist as current makeshift weapons, and there's that one fire damage jakob's revolver already. Vintage sounds really cool, though."
Borderlands,3buc0m,Flare2v,3,Fri Jul 3 19:15:40 2015 UTC,Joint-Venture guns where two manufacturers develop a gun of their own. They'd be common drops and Bandit could have be special and just slap two guns together such as:  Hyperion shotgun barrel on a Bandit SMG with Torgue AR clips
Borderlands,3buc0m,30SecondsToFail,6,Thu Jul 2 12:05:15 2015 UTC,The only problem I have with that idea is that the manufacturer's all hate each other. A lot.

Borderlands,3buc0m,jascha314,2,Thu Jul 2 11:19:10 2015 UTC,Ikr! TPS only had like 13 fast travel stations and about 30 or so locations. This got really annoying really fast
Borderlands,3buc0m,littlebigcheese,6,Fri Jul 3 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"Bows! :D  Any experienced sniper will tell you how irritating it is when your targets keep moving around. The question is how to stop these cheaters from wind-sprinting around like they own the place. And the answer is to pin them to a wall. How? With arrows!  ""Now, hold on,"" you might be thinking. ""I'm strong, but no one could throw an arrow that hard."" Introducing the Huntsman longbow, which solves that age-old throwing problem.  ""Now, hold on,"" you keep saying. ""Aren't bows and arrows primitive and harmless?"" Why don't you ask the dinosaurs? Except you can't, because the cavemen bow and arrowed them to death. One headshot from the Huntsman can mean an instant crit, in addition to a bolt-riddled corpse hanging from a wall that's gruesome and funny.  And even if you don't kill them, they'll carry around a certain arrow-shaped something as a living testament to your awesome archery skills and their frankly unawesome dodging skills."
Borderlands,3buc0m,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,5,Thu Jul 2 06:10:04 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't want bows in a Borderlands game. I'd rather stick to snipers with special effects (Longbow). Maybe an E-Tech ""crossbow"" would be fun to play with but not as a whole new class. I just feel like bows don't fit the Borderlands series."
Borderlands,3buc0m,jascha314,2,Thu Jul 2 12:46:39 2015 UTC,I like the snipers idea. I would also want snipers to be more stealthy if you're taking out enemies at long distances. Maybe add silencers on them
Borderlands,3buc0m,fzf97,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:07:38 2015 UTC,"That silencer idea is good. A weapon with some sort of silencer mechanism would be good in those situations where you need to take out certain targets, but you don't want to alert the whole camp. It may seem gimmicky, but I think it'd be cool."

Borderlands,3buc0m,fzf97,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:10:11 2015 UTC,I'd like a manufacturer that made guns that use money instead of ammo.

I did like 5-10 side missions during the entire game.  There is no difficulty settings, but if you are higher level than the enemies then they will be extremely easy. After you beat the game once you open up Playthrough 2, which is just a reboot of the game but with higher level enemies. When you beat THAT mode you unlock ""Playthrough 2,5"", which means all enemies scale with your level. Your gear is a lot better by now though, so PT2 was 10x easier for me than PT1. The more difficult stuff is in the DLCs, especially in Secret Armory of General Knoxx."
Borderlands,3buwv0,erians,2,Thu Jul 2 11:37:24 2015 UTC,I recommend only doing them if you're under the level of the main quest.

Are you still fighting to get to the vault? In the story mission, how is your level compared to the enemies?   As /u/erians and /u/FinalFate pointed out, if you are underleveled for the story missions, use the bounty boards to level up. You can get through a few levels under the enemies.   Now, if you already finished the story, then you can start on ""playthrough 2"" where you just play through the story again, but the enemies level up from 30-50 I believe. Or if you have the DLC, you can play through some of that for a change. The bounty boards and side missions are there to help you level up for the main missions."
Borderlands,3brov4,mooseofdoom23,153,Wed Jul 1 16:35:43 2015 UTC,• Multiple planets. As we saw at the end that there are vaults in other planets too.  • Involvement of Eridians (Species) in the storyline.

It seems to me an Eridian doesn't count a human conflict a war, and he/she/whatever states that war is coming. I'm thinking an Eridian will be playable in BL3 :D"
Borderlands,3brov4,littlebigcheese,17,Wed Jul 1 19:19:51 2015 UTC,To me it felt more like the Hyperion 'war' was much less big in scope and danger than whatever is approaching.

Borderlands,3brov4,balanceofpower,14,Wed Jul 1 16:50:10 2015 UTC,"I'm actually quite surprised at some of the twitter responses about the writing. I thought I was in a very small minority of fans that didn't care for Anthony Burch's writing. Don't get me wrong, his comedy is great and the funny stuff in Borderlands 2 is funny and memorable but the overall main plot is just bad, so bad...  In keeping with the topic then, I  hope Borderlands 3 goes back to its roots in Bl1 story-wise. Borderlands shouldn't be about ""good versus evil"" - it's a story about anti-heroes against powerful interests, kicking ass and picking up loot along the way."
Borderlands,3brov4,MausIguana,11,Wed Jul 1 18:14:31 2015 UTC,"He's declined IMO, especially his character writing. Part of the reason BL1 was so good was the dry, witty humor that they didn't really shove in your face. Some of the writing in BL2 and almost all of the writing in TPS just felt like it was trying way too hard."
Borderlands,3brov4,balanceofpower,8,Thu Jul 2 05:49:51 2015 UTC,"I don't want to knock the guy too much because A) compared to many of us he's pretty successful doing what he loves b) Borderlands 2 did really well for itself, it's not like it failed and/or was singled out for its writing. My sense of it is he was brought in for his humor but was out of his element as far as storytelling goes. I guess time will tell whether his writing has declined or not, or if Gearbox just wasn't the right fit for him."
Borderlands,3brov4,RogueEyebrow,12,Thu Jul 2 06:14:56 2015 UTC,"Borderlands shouldn't be about ""good versus evil"" - it's a story about anti-heroes against powerful interests,   How was BL2 different from this?  Jack & Hyperion were the powerful interests.  I don't think Jack was evil.  Sadistic, sure, but not necessarily evil.  He thought he was doing good, saving the planet and wiping out bandits.  A real ""the-ends-justify-the-means"" kind of guy."
Borderlands,3brov4,Iamnothereorthere,28,Wed Jul 1 18:46:25 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with Jack as the ""good guy"", for all the twisted motivation they tried to give him, was how over the top evil he is for so much of the game. He's introduced telling you to kill yourself and how awesome his life is, and the first ""background"" you get on him is murdering Helena Pierce and ordering Wilhelm to kill the women and children in the train. He feeds people to the Grinder on a monthly basis, even if no one breaks his ridiculous laws. He tells Sanctuary to surrender and he'll make it quick, only to call you and tell you that he was lying and will torture them all slowly. He mutates Bloodwing for no reason than to show off his strength. He also harms Angel after she helps you in Opportunity. This makes even his ""saving grace"" of loving Angel seem weirdly forced and out of place in Control Core Angel."
Borderlands,3brov4,Langager90,13,Wed Jul 1 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget how he brags about kidnapping, beating and torturing Tannis for the Key, then claims that letting her go is mercy and ""what good guys do""."
Borderlands,3brov4,NobleV,8,Wed Jul 1 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"Yes but to him all of these people are savages that deserve a cruel death, and in a wat he is right. Most bandits are idiot savages that do nothing but kill you and take your shit. Jacks problem is that he lumps everybody together after we betrayed him. Imo, Borderlands 2 was way vetter than the first in story because the first didnt really have a story. Find the vault for yourself. Stop Atlas. That was the story."
Borderlands,3brov4,balanceofpower,7,Thu Jul 2 01:44:16 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, Jack's I'm-a-villain-who-thinks-himself-a-hero schtick is handled very poorly IMHO. It's not meta enough to be intelligent commentary (even if it was, I am not sure Borderlands is the right place for it) and it's delivery to the player is so heavy-handed that it lacks any meaning. It's the equivalent of someone telling you a joke that you politely giggle to only to be asked repeatedly ""Did you get it? did you get it??"".  While I enjoyed Borderlands 2 and it certainly improves on many aspects of Bl1, the thing that struck me about Bl1 was it's overall tone / atmosphere coupled with efficient, even minimalist storytelling.   Borderlands 2's tone went the other direction, it amped up the colors, it toned down the violence, it made it sillier instead of crazy, and the story is written to stir feelings of heroism and sympathy (Oh those crazy-ass bandits that want to wear your skin like a dress? Oh those are just ex Dahl employees. It reminds me of George Lucas and his midichlorians from Phantom Menace, he's explaining things that didn't need to be explained.)  I'd like Borderlands 3 to return to the original's irreverent side. It shoudl be more like Captain Scarlett's Booty: charismatic villains, filthy lucre and bad-ass ass-kickers."
Borderlands,3brov4,MoonbirdMonster,2,Wed Jul 1 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"Dude I fucking loved BL1's storytelling way more, was that Burch as well? If so, jesus what happened?"
Borderlands,3brov4,balanceofpower,2,Thu Jul 2 03:28:13 2015 UTC,"No, Burch was brought in for BL2. According to IMDB, it lists several people as writers for Borderlands 1 including Randy Pitchford and Mike Neumann. I was under the impression that Neuman did the bulk of it but don't quote me."
Borderlands,3brov4,SnapCrack1ePop,5,Thu Jul 2 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, BL2 has a very ""moral ambiguity"" theme, and TPS even more so. Not your typical ""good vs evil"" plot at all."
Borderlands,3brov4,tazercow,16,Wed Jul 1 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah when Jack tore a guy's eye out with a spoon with his family watching before wasting them all while laughing hysterically I was all like ""wait, is this guy good or bad?"""
Borderlands,3brov4,interfail,3,Wed Jul 1 19:15:07 2015 UTC,I hope Borderlands 3 goes back to its roots in Bl1 story-wise.   You mean basically not having a story?
Borderlands,3brov4,balanceofpower,2,Thu Jul 2 10:40:56 2015 UTC,"Quite simply, yes. Okay okay, I know you're being facetious. But a minimal story is not necessarily a bad thing; the original Doom is considered a masterpiece of minimalist storytelling, letting the player focus on the action.   Thing is, where Borderlands had very little story, Borderlands 2 had too much of it I think; there was so, so much exposition going over the echo devices. Even with my several hundred hours of play time I still find it hard to follow the storyline in certain areas because the exposition is going on right in the middle of huge battles.  The series has already struck a nice balance between action and exposition: in the General Knoxx DLC. That one had plenty of story without barging in on the action. (At least that's how I remember it, it's been a while since I've played General Knoxx.)"
Borderlands,3brov4,The_Maltese_Penguin,30,Sat Jul 4 11:57:13 2015 UTC,"I've heard that a lot of folks who use cheats do so to try out new characters and skip the low levels. I think a feature that could solve for this would be the ability to create a character at a higher level if you start in a harder mode. Maybe you unlock it by beating the main story once in that mode first.   So, you beat ultimate vault hunter as usual with your first character. After that you can create a character that starts at level 35 (or something) to start them in UVH."
Borderlands,3brov4,poopnuts,23,Wed Jul 1 19:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's ridiculous that people who just want to play the game on a harder difficulty have to play through at least once just to get to the difficulty that gives them the most enjoyment. I get that Gearbox is following the Diablo formula of handling difficulty but it really doesn't serve any purpose at all. To people who are highly skilled, it's really just one long tutorial the first time through."
Borderlands,3brov4,FrozenSeas,13,Wed Jul 1 20:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm not ashamed to admit I used the save editor to bump a few characters up to UVHM because frankly, I'm not running the entire game three times on the same character just to access the real fun in endgame content. I didn't mind when it was just two playthroughs, but when you start talking three (with massively increased difficulty for the last one) plus farming gear regularly because of the scaling and Overpower levels...no."
Borderlands,3brov4,MrRafikki,3,Wed Jul 1 21:45:17 2015 UTC,"this would have saved me so much time. on xbox one and i've switched characters a few times. also play with my wife with her own account and shes done the same. so i've played through the story mode about 10 times just to match levels for new characters. right now her siren is OP 2 with never finished the first play through. shes the second screen, so that makes it easy at least."
Borderlands,3brov4,Spinach7,5,Thu Jul 2 02:07:00 2015 UTC,"I wish there was an option upon reaching Sanctuary to start a new character at level 10 that starts in Sanctuary. Optionally, a new character at a certain level that starts right after the fight with Flint."
Borderlands,3brov4,Smegman69,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:52:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would be good if in the ng+ modes, you could choose to play as a new character, still with the same guns and amount of skill points though."
Borderlands,3brov4,BeavMcloud,27,Thu Jul 2 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"Actual melee weapons. You still have four slots for guns but an additional slot for one melee weapon. They are more rare than guns (like class mods or relics) and provide boosts to, of course, melee damage and elemental damage types. They are class-specific and slightly deviate from your character's default weapon model (kind of like class mods).    Feel free to add more ideas. I kind of made this up on the spot."
Borderlands,3brov4,UnknownStory,13,Wed Jul 1 21:46:29 2015 UTC,"I thought what would have been a cool idea was a weapon master that ""morphs"" guns into melee weapons depending on the manufacturer, model, stats, etc. Like for their Action Skill the weapon they are holding (or switch to) is a melee-type weapon instead of a gun.   Torgue would totally become giant hammers... THAT CAUSE EXPLOSIONS! Hyperion (if they still exist) would become swords that get easier to swing with multiple uses in a row. Jakobs would be long spears (highly accurate) SCAV (or the new ""S&S Flavor of the Month"") would be claws... wild, fast, and unpredictable Tediore would become whips that explode at the tip.

Sometimes your game will be populated with people who deal with loot honorable, by looking at it and deciding whether they really need it or not before picking it up, or even dropping it after picking it up, but that's rare.  On the other hand, if you're playing with some real life friends that you have a really strong bond with, loot ninja-ing is awesome fun."

The only surefire way of doing this is to store character data on a server that you must authenticate and log in to, which means that you'd have to have an active internet connection to do so.  There are some checks in place -- for example, to remove invalid loot -- but that was motivated less by preventing cheaters and more by the fact that it was causing some users to crash on a regular basis.  It's my personal opinion (which I think is shared by many on the dev team) that attempting to stop people from cheating (or, in other terms, ""playing the game how they want to play it"") is a fool's errand. People are clever and systems are imperfect. Safeguards will be circumvented.  I think the best way to avoid playing with cheaters is to forge friendships with those who play the same way you do and stick to that circle of friends.

So say the initial drop is 1%, after every kill it increases by 0.1% (1.1% then 1.2% then 1.3% and so on) up to the 1000% cap which in this case would be 10%.

Up the drop rate to what it was for BL1, which everyone unanimously agrees was fun. The possibility that anything could drop at any time, the joy of finding something awesome unexpectedly, the feeling of a weapon being just a little too powerful for a couple of levels was AWESOME. Restricting loot so much and forcing a total regear almost every level which in turn requires some hideous grinding is no fun. Why was this decision made? To prolong people's play time? I've got five times as many hours on BL1 than BL2, because BL1 was always fun!  It's not a challenge to kill an enemy 100 times. If I can kill him 5 times I can kill him 10 I can kill him 1,000 times. It's not a test of skill, it's not 'earning the reward', it's a time hole, it's dull, and it's lazy game design.  Go back to any enemy having the potential to drop any weapon. Then you can find more than one legendary per bloody play through but at the same time don't have the risk of players killing the boss who drops the super OP weapon and just whoring it up."

Borderlands,3brov4,UnknownStory,33,Thu Jul 2 05:09:24 2015 UTC,"Old news pal.  But most things I'd want is mostly what they did wrong in the sequels   I'd love the old BL1 weapon system back. I like the new manufacturer additions (except for really badly balanced gimmicks) but the way weapon parts were handled and how big of a difference they made, one part could mean the difference between a 3.0 firerate and a 12.5 one. (and the parts affected the rarity which makes sense since some parts were better than others) The new Raid bosses suck, the TPS bosses had great mechanics but they weren't hard enough whilst BL2s bosses were just bullet sponges and extremely dull. the old element, you know, the ones who actually did damage. They were also more complex which gave a strategic approuch to them.   That's pretty much all I want. But I will argue some of your wants OP.  golden chest - yes that can go, but at the same time it didn't really ruin anything.  better cheat protection - Yes, but that's impossible unless they make it online only which would get a ton of negative response from the community. Fixing all duping issues would be easier and still have a huge impact, especially on console since you can't mod  on there.  Masher pistols - yes, look at #1  online coop - can't really be improved unless they make it online only which goes back to the other point. I've had very few issues playing with near friends but overseas things get compliated, but that's not their problem.  town portal?  Loot options - I can understand this to some extent but ninja looting is a part of the franchise and I definitely want it to stay.  vehicle summon - No, no. You don't need a personal vehicle, the game shouldn't be focused on vehicles anyway.  eridian weapons - yes  more manufacturers - definitely, there are tons of weapons but we need more new and distinct ones and not just rehashes, but new weapon types like the scrapped grenade launchers are also needed."

I love driving and running turrets, and I was so hyped to have a boss or two where driving would have been a necessity (with the caveat that the vehicle would be harder to blow up because let's be honest sometimes BL vehicles are made of tinfoil and that just doesn't play well into a boss fight.)"

Not to mention that Dahl and Atlas were both all over Pandora in the first game and didn't make it any less shit. The only reason that Hyperion improved what they did was because of Jack's hero complex and narcissism.   You could have some fun with a few of the lore elements that I'm not sure are ever mentioned in the games, though. The reason everything on Pandora went to shit is because the early settlers from Atlas arrived in winter. See, Pandora has a weird orbit. For one thing, one Pandoran year is 10 Terran years, and it may in fact be tidally-locked to its star, with the inhabited regions being on the ""dark"" side. This didn't actually occur to me until I was waiting for night during Clan War, but at no point in BL2 (I can't remember 1 well enough, and I'm too lazy to reinstall it now) do you actually see the sun. It's always Elpis. And going to The Pre-Sequel, the sun is visible...on the far side of Pandora. The ""dark"" side, facing Elpis, is home to an immense deposit of eridium that just happens to be a dead ringer for the Eridium Blight region.  So when the first settlers from Atlas arrived, they were unknowingly landing in the middle of the seven-year Pandoran winter, when most of the wildlife was in hibernation (and, my speculation is, there was significantly more water on the surface). Then summer rolled around, everything woke up, and even the habitable regions started drying out, which explains some of the gigantic skeletons around, as well as the Sunken Sea and Oasis. I sorta suspect that as of BL2, winter is coming again due to areas like Southern Shelf and Three Horns being more frozen wasteland than sun-baked desert."

I love how you can connect with a character and be happy to see him in another Borderlands game and getting to know him better. For example:  I played as Athena in TPS and thought that she's a really great character. Then I played Tales from the Borderlands and was all like ""nooo way, Athena is in there, how cool is that!"" and ""aww man this scene with Springs is kinda cute"". Also seeing Zer0 was really really cool for me.

I don't use the cheat engine (like you, I think it completely ruins the game), but I respect other peoples way of playing. Even if they figure out a way to prevent cheats (which is impossible btw), people can just copy save files with amazing gear/max level. The only way to prevent cheat is to make the saves etc server side, like in Diablo3, but that comes with a new set of problems and screws up the game for offline players. I rather see them working on making sure there are no crazy, imbalanced glitches,  Other than that I definitely agree with your suggestions, ""TP""s instead of save and exit stuff would be great, better infrastructure for online play (like lobbies n shit), etc.  Something I would love to see is better balance, both in terms of classes and items (DPUH, Grognozzle etc), and some decent end game. ""Raid"" bosses that requires some strategy & tailored gear, and doesnt have massive, unavoidable damage abilities.  And I know this game isn't about PvP, but I would play the heeeeeell out of some form of sand box, free for all arena.

The reason keys became essential in BL2 was that you couldn't get decent gear without them unless you were willing to just grind and grind and grind endlessly, and that is boring. I'm fine with grinding for the absolute best top-shelf stuff, go ahead and knock yourself out, but I shouldn't have to grind just for gear good enough to keep progressing through UVHM."

I don't know why anyone would just make a cheated max level character with all the e-tech and best rare weapons, but they do it for some reason, without actually playing through the game.   I am one of these people and I never join other people's game without telling them that they are not legit guns or levels. And I never give any of my guns to people who are playing legitimately. The reason I do it is because I don't find the farming and leveling experience to be fun. I just want to play the game at op8.   I want muh masher type pistols back. Those things were my favorite in Borderlands 1.   The Maggie.   Better online. As it is currently, the online code is kind of wonky.   Agreed.   A town portal scroll type thing.   I don't understand what this means. Can you explain?   Different options, selectable upon creating a game/server, that allow you to set up how loot gets allocated...   I like how it is currently. You get to form a community and decide who gets what weapons.   The ability to summon your vehicle (given you're in a vehicle-allowed area) on command.   I think the current procedure is better, it makes it dangerous for your vehicle to explode, rather than just instantly spawning a new one.   A return of Eridian weapons. Not E-Tech, but the actual Eridian weapons like in Borderlands 1.   Agreed.   More weapons manufacturers! More more more!   Just remember that more isn't always better. If they add too many, they will no longer be unique and memorable."

Borderlands,3brov4,1karl1,2,Wed Jul 1 21:16:37 2015 UTC,"If they get rid of golden keys and stop people from cheating in items, they absolutely have to make the loot system more fun to use. In BL2, there's no incentive to farm below the level cap knowing that your weapons will be useless in 5 levels time. Getting a legendary (without farming) is somewhat underwhelming knowing that you'll only get a few levels out of it before you find something better.  The grinder in TPS was also pretty shit, but it at least showed that the developers were aware of how tedious farming is. Maybe if you could use moonstones to grind lower level guns to your level, or if your grind result was made of parts of the stuff you grind with (because farming for specific parts is pretty boring as well). Whatever they decide to do in BL3, they need to deter people from spending half of their playtime farming new gear."
Borderlands,3brov4,DRW00LYNIPPL3Z,2,Wed Jul 1 18:50:19 2015 UTC,They could do the independent loot pools like Diablo has since added where each individual player gets loot unique to their screen so that their is no loot thefting by greedy players.
Borderlands,3brov4,Smegman69,2,Wed Jul 1 22:19:55 2015 UTC,I just want it to be as much fun as BL2 to play over & over again mainly & for me it would include these -  Vault hunters to be more of the heartless badass type who actually come across like they enjoy what they're doing .   More variety in the callouts they make and while i'm on the topic have more of the game's humour focused in those callouts from our players & enemies rather than cut scenes which can grind on you so we can smile & laugh as we play .  A more sinister gameworld inkeeping with the baddies that inhabit it like parts of BL1 were .  4 or 5 skill trees per char so we have plenty of build diversity & reason to replay .  Fill all ammo in 1 click option in machines . Money/currency to be a different colour to any rarity of weapon to avoid cash/legendary confusion . Maybe have it silver & do away with white rarity of items & have green as the lowest .

Borderlands,3brov4,Onionsarestupid,2,Thu Jul 2 01:04:10 2015 UTC,"I think what I want most is fun and unique classes (at least one melee viable class) and replay value. That's probably why BL2 is my favorite of the series.  For me, TPS took too long to get going and for a game like BL, a boring beginning really kills it for me because that's what's going to keep me from trying all of the characters, knowing that I have to slog through the crap part of the game. And with TPS, the whole first half felt like the crappy introduction part. In BL2 I played every character besides Axton to level 50+ and had a blast doing it, especially Krieg, Zer0, and Sal. In TPS I played Claptrap with a friend, and when I went to try Athena and Doppleganger Jack to be my solo characters I got bored and gave up before level 10.   Not trying to shit all over TPS, I'm sure others like it, just trying to find tangible reasons why I wasn't in love with it like BL2.   Also can we get a third person mode?

As it is the leveling and class differences is really subpar.  99% of the game all classes play exactly the same, until you use your ONE special ability.

Borderlands,3brov4,_Lady_Deadpool_,2,Thu Jul 2 05:30:20 2015 UTC,"New Rarities! Tales From The Borderlands gave me a good idea!  Vintage Weapons: New rarity, mostly Atlas stuff, but some other manufacturer's stuff too. Extremely rare and valuable, but also a bit more powerful than Legendarys and Pearls, like the difference between Legendarys and Purples in Borderlands 1. I think that would add a new and appealing rarity to the game and be fairly interesting.  Next! Makeshift Weapons: The manufacturers often get to see others designs so sometimes, they enjoy to copycat those weapons, this would be in pretty special occasion, but if you were to get a World Drop from sayyy, a Hyperion Loader and he drops an Unkempt Harold, it would have nullified stats for being Makeshift but also have that Manufacturer's weapon attributes (Increased Accuracy when firing).

Granted, tps didn't have a whole lot of dlc, but I think that was mostly because tps wasn't very popular. However, BL2 had like 150€ of dlc, which I think is kind of ridiculous, even though I actually thought most of the dlc was pretty good.  I think my biggest problem with BL dlc is that it feels so money-grabby... I don't know how they'd fix that though. Maybe patch UVHM packs in instead of selling them, same with arena dlc, maybe even characters.  I know I'm not alone in this... when you look for example at steam user reviews, pretty much all the negative views start with something like ""I actually like the game, but there is too much dlc"".  Idk, I'm kind of torn. In one hand I love BL and will never say no to more content, but 150€ total for all dlc for 1 game is kind of insane."
Borderlands,3brov4,ezrasharpe,6,Wed Jul 1 21:26:23 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your position on this at all.  $60 for a game you can sink about 20 hours into is sort of the norm these days, and BL2 and BL:TPS exceed that mark if you're willing to get even one character to level 50.  If you actually enjoy the loot hunt at the level cap, or you enjoy bringing multiple characters to the level cap, it's pretty easy to sink hundreds of hours into the game.  If you enjoy the content new DLC provides and you feel like it enriches those hours of entertainment, then it seems like they're a bargain to me.  If you don't care about extra content... just don't get the DLC and play your 40-50 hours and be happy.  Nothing is forcing you to spend money on a game you're already happy with, and if you feel like you are getting value for your money, why does it matter how much of it is going into ""one game?""  It's like getting expansions for tabletop games.  E.g.:  I have a game called Dominion which is ~$40 for the base set and ~$30 for each expansion.  I have three expansions, so I've spent ~$120 on the game.  Why?  Well, because I like the game and I enjoy having more depth or variety to add to it if I want.  If it provides value to my experience, I consider the money well spent, even if it ""doesn't do me any good"" when I'm playing something else.  (Don't even get me started on the amount of money I have spent on Dungeons and Dragons books over the years.)"
Borderlands,3brov4,OcularSchlong,3,Wed Jul 1 22:07:46 2015 UTC,"Might be an unpopular opinion but I really hate how combat is designed around the fight for your life mechanic.  I'm by no means an expert at the game and I've only sunk around 150 hours into it but...  On my most recent playthrough with my girlfriend and other friend, the fight for your life mechanic just completely brought the combat to a stand-still. In bad fights it felt like we were constantly struggling against that mechanic than the actual enemies. Doing the Krieg-Maya combo to keep things going but it would be only a matter of seconds before I'd hear that BRRRRRRRRRR and someone is down again.  I'm not asking for there to be no risk with the combat, ofc that is needed. I just wish the fight for your life mechanic was less of a crutch.  TLDR: From my experience fight-for-your-life becomes a chore and isn't fun. It is however better than straight up dieing. Slagging everything is a boring mechanic. Also more multiplayer synergy between characters would be great."
Borderlands,3brov4,Zombie_DooDoo,3,Wed Jul 1 23:22:17 2015 UTC,I like my cheats thanks... they make the game more fun for me. Fun is subjective and I just like breaking games and screwing around to see what silly things I can do. It's not a competitive game so I hardly think it matters if someone cheats anyway. As long as they're not ruining co-op games. Maybe as a compromise Gearbox could set a cheat detecting algorithm into the game that flags saves with modded weapons/etc so that if you co-op with someone you can decide yourself if you want to play with a cheater or not before joining up with them.

I just want a bigger variety in legendary guns so that way we can see them drop more often.   Also, add more weapon parts. Give each weapon type 2-3 parts from a single manufacturer: for example maliwan pistols could have two different barrels/grips/sights and possibly different gun bodies. This would take the gun possibilities to an even more ridiculous amount and possibly open the door to gear crafting.

At the beginning of the game you would lock in basic appearance and decide your 3 skill trees, hopefully from a massive and well balanced collection. Most of it, of course, could be customized later in the game.  I do like how playable characters are also story characters, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with original characters, that trend only started because of BL2 and new playable characters can be original or custom.  I don't want an mmo feel, I want a co-op rpg, like its been.   I dream of a non-gun weapon slot...by this I mean melee weapon, physical shield, or bow, something fun to use with abilities.

Borderlands,3brov4,Predawncarpet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:15:33 2015 UTC,"IDK if OP is targetting Gibbed editing as cheating or just Cheat Engine like things. I've used both and would not like either to go but at the very least, I would like Gibbed to remain. The game is a co-op, not multiplayer competitive. I'm sure it must suck when someone using Cheat Engine joins and just wrecks but I highly doubt it's affecting even 1% of players. Instead, I think an avoidance system would be much better. I've joined games with a modded save, even modded badass stats and let the host know and if someone joins my game when I'm messing with Cheat Engine, I let them know too. It would just be better to be able to avoid a player instead. Someone joins in and does something stupid, avoid them and move on. I played the game legit multiple times through and no longer find it fun to do all the grinding and what not and just choose to use the game as a hub to talk to people and mess with gravity and speed mods.  Just my take on.  Also, how about being settings for a new save that allows the player to have fun their way. Add settings for being able to change drop rates within the game, change speed and gravity, and other simple things like that to the session and just have it in the lobby listing so others would know. On top of that, allow for players to set what play through they wish to start a new character. If I've played the game through 20 times and wish to go at it again, i don't want to have to do normal > TVHM > UVHM and instead, just start at UVHM. I don't mind using Gibbed at all but it would be cool if these options were made available to the character.

For me, the only disappointing part of TPS was the lack of a character with a turret (some could say Wolf, but I mean a stationary throwable turret like in the past games) I mostly play single player, and for the first two games almost exclusively played the soldier characters. In BL2 when I saw that I could get two turrets, it was amazing! When I got into TPS, there was no turret character, and it made the game feel like more of a chore because I always used the turret to watch where I put it. Wolf flies around and almost every time flies away from where I want it to go. If anything it's more akin to Bloodwing. I just hope they bring back turrets. (I'd be even more thrilled if in their comedic spirit gave us three deployable turrets for BL3 like they gave us two in BL2!)  I'd also enjoy a return of the double jump.  And other people have said that they want the gold keys to go away, but as a mostly single player, the gold key chest was a god-send. If I ever hit a point where I could use some help, I just go to the gold chest and get a little bump to get me back on the field!"

Melee fighting options / weapons that you can use as a primary, rather than as action skill. Zer0's sword action skill was really cool, but it'd be fun and chaotic to have more variety. Like, what if you could pick up Eridium gauntlets and run around as Brick? Maybe you could also have a shield with a damage nullifier and/or health regen if it's equipped in tandem with the gauntlets, to off-set the amount of damage you'd take while running towards your next victim. Character creation? It's nice having characters, but it'd be fun to be able to tweak their looks a bit more and really make it your own."

Being able to choose a few badass ranks to float in the HUD while your tracking their progress. All ammo/money/eridium/ect to auto pickup from a decent range. Also ammo to only pickup if you need it, atm if you hold to pickup all ammo from a chest, it will go to you regardless of if your ammo for that type is full.

Borderlands,3by7yg,ilovecheese2,12,Fri Jul 3 03:52:19 2015 UTC,No.  She had an entire DLC dedicated to her character development. We know more about her than nearly any other character in the entire series. We need new characters to discover.
Borderlands,3by7yg,8988303682,-6,Fri Jul 3 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I believe the main focus of BL isn't the development of current Vault Hunter stories as opposed to the main plot which I expect to be tied together in BL3. To knock aside a potential Vault Hunter simply due to the fact that we need new characters to discover isn't fair, given none of the vault hunters past the original four and partly Athena (not even partly, we just know she has a sympathetic side towards Jack) have even been explored extensively. Aside from the first four Vault Hunters, where has there been a detailed playable character development in the BL series? Jack's body double is one of the vault hunters in TPS as a DLC. We know EVERYTHING about Jack, but that didn't stop Gearbox from making a fun playable character out of him, albeit a body double. What about Claptrap? He's been in the series since minute one, but he's still a fun character."

I think it was a mistake to have four people we'd seen before be the main characters in TPS; the story, in my opinion, was hampered in knowing what happened to three of them. The fourth, Athena, was so wildly changed from her appearance and behaviors in BL1 that they might as well have had it be a completely unknown character. And by now, all of the BL2 characters have so much backstory and baggage attached, it'd be painful for the writers to shoehorn all that into a game.   Much better to start the new game with a new set of characters that can be written freely from the start, without anything to hold the new writers back."

Roughrider is a better choice at more advanced levels when enemies get exponentially stronger and Release the Beast is Unlocked. It makes you much more survivable in that environment and the 0 shield is perfect for getting you rampaging frequently. To answer your question, the level of the drop scales with the level of the enemy, and the enemy's level scale mechanic depends upon a number of things, which Vault Hunter mode you are in, when you accept a mission, and in UVHM it is affected by whatever level you are at the time. So in UVHM, the drop is affected by your level. In regular mode, no it does not scale beyond whatever set level the enemy is at. Consult the wiki for more on that."

Borderlands,3brfb6,Tackysackjones,41,Wed Jul 1 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"Right off the bat there were a few things people took offense at; inability to farm (leading to a surge in Alt-F4,) short campaign, plethora of returning legendaries (Hammer Buster II being the worst offender, since they tried to differentiate and then only adding II on the end,) and the only raid boss being just a harder Sentinel. There was also backlash about Nisha being basically the 'easy-mode' character (and we can't really say that it's not true.)  People also took offense at 4 campaigns for the BL2 season pass vs. 2 characters, a Slaughterdome (Holodome) and a single campaign DLC (at the time, we didn't know that it was going to be as good as Claptastic ended up being.) The Holodome sucked, which didn't help.  Then there was the Rosie patch, where the Probe got nuked from orbit, Iwajira's drops eliminated the only grinder fodder in the game at the time, and Ol' Rosie got nerfed for no apparent reason, which confused people since the reason was that it was deemed ""too good to not have,"" even though about a dozen BL2 guns were never nerfed despite the same classification and the Rosie can be obtained simply by finishing TVHM.  Most of this was fixed with Claptastic Voyage and the x3 drop increase...then 2K Aus got shut down before we could get more DLC. By the time Claptastic dropped, a lot of people had jumped ship and it was too late. I really enjoy TPS, but I can see why people were unhappy throughout the post-launch timeline."
Borderlands,3brfb6,MatrixRaider,25,Wed Jul 1 15:40:58 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem with TPS is the lack of content compared to BL2.   TPS has:   A shorter main campaign with fewer sidequests Only 1 DLC campaign compared to 4 Along the same line, only 2 raid bosses (counting Ned) compared to 7! (Terra, Hyperius, Gee, Pete, Vora, Dex, Dragons), even more if you count the Headhunter bosses as raid bosses. All of these are new, unique fights rather than a harder instance of another boss (with the sole exception of Pyro Pete) 3 Slaughterdomes compared to 4 2 entire weapon tiers that do not exist (Seraph & Pearl, considering E-Tech and Glitch to be more or less equal-I know color says otherwise but actual behavior suggests these two to be most similar) Along that same line, tons of Legendaries that are merely recycled ideas. I actually think there are more recycled Legendaries than new ones. Don't get me wrong, it is perfectly fine to recycle Legendaries, but only in moderation. It's so unfun to get a Legendary drop, use it to find out what it does, only to find out that it's the same thing you've used to years in BL2, or worse, an inferior version of it Luneshine feels completely worthless   Don't get me wrong, TPS is a good game by itself and there is a lot of things that it does right (Grinder, better skill trees, etc.). But compared to BL2, there is a disappointing lack of content."
Borderlands,3brfb6,Zaaptastic,7,Wed Jul 1 16:30:01 2015 UTC,"For raid bosses, I think the lack of them is due to a) lack of DLC campaigns, and b) the Eclipse/EOS fight being insanely difficult. To boot, I feel that out of the 7 raid bosses BL2 had, only 3 of them were fun experiences (Terra, Pete and the Dragons.) Having less raid bosses in exchange for more fun raids I think is a fair trade (except Ned keeps throwing my fucking Skullmasher in the lava, I swear to God.)  I think TPS could've gotten away with 3 Slaughterdomes, however, 1 of them was meh (Shock Drop) and another was straight-up sad (Holodome.) BL2's base game Slaughterdomes were all top-notch (even if the Hyperion-Dome was difficult as all hell,) which I think is the difference. (BL2 also technically has 6 Slaughterdomes, if you count Horde of Horrors and the Brawls from Torgue's DLC.)  On tiers, I think 2K Aus made up for the lack of rarities with Glitch (filling 1 gap) and an entire class of guns (Lasers) Also, the DLC legendaries and the Glitch guns are much less tedious to get, which was a big problem with Pearls and Seraphs.  Base game legendaries sucked, no question about it. Luneshine, however, can be really useful (Punisher on Jakobs for example) but there are a lot of useless types. ""+1 Oz on hit""? Come on.  I think that overall, the content is similar in terms of size and high rarity items are easier to get, but the quality was marginally lower which gave off the appearance of less content (since there was less content deemed worth playing.)"
Borderlands,3brfb6,MatrixRaider,2,Wed Jul 1 16:47:55 2015 UTC,"What's the third slaughter dome in TPS?  There's shockdrop, the holodome and what else?"
Borderlands,3brfb6,DeadFishFry,3,Wed Jul 1 21:25:10 2015 UTC,In the Claptastic DLC you can do a side mission from Deck 13 1/2 to unlock a slaughterdome in the Cortex (h4X0rs.)
Borderlands,3brfb6,MatrixRaider,-2,Thu Jul 2 13:30:18 2015 UTC,"People give TPS a lot of hate for recycling legendaries despite the fact that BL2 recycled quite a few legendaries from BL1, some of which are completely useless (when has anyone needed a Cobra?). TPS actually recycled the useful weapons from BL1, and added 14 new ones in Claptastic."
Borderlands,3brfb6,Xyanite,5,Wed Jul 1 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"good points. The Grinder was a huge boon for me. I loved that there was now a reason to keep a few extra guns in your back pack to try and get better gear out of them.

As well as there was no way to get good mission guns and a lot of the bosses were during the campaign so once you fought them, that's it. and the best you could get was a level 2/30 gun that would be useless when you reached endgame. The only way to farm in the game at the time was to take a quest for a boss, and then after killing him alt-f4ing to not save the game."

Borderlands,3brfb6,thedavecan,16,Thu Jul 2 13:36:07 2015 UTC,"Just a couple things that really put me off. The story pacing is stupidly slow. The perfect example is meeting Gladstone, he holds you up behind a door for what seems like forever while you listen to some boring dialogue and that happens way too much in TPS. Also, mobs seem to trickle out of holes/doors/etc 1 at a time in many places like killing Darksiders, you kill a mob then 1 more guy comes out, you kill him and another comes out seemingly unending.  I definitely liked the skill trees but are they better than BL2? That's debatable. Low grav is really fun and Oz kits are definitely better than relics but they won't make narrative sense once we're back on Pandora."

Overall the game was not worth the $60 i payed for on the PS3 but definitely worth it to buy the Handsome Collection. It feels like a DLC."

Borderlands,3brfb6,Xyanite,2,Wed Jul 1 18:59:16 2015 UTC,It feels like a DLC   This perfectly sums up what I think of TPS. It doesn't feel complete enough to be another title in the Borderlands series.
Borderlands,3brfb6,aleph_thiago,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:29:10 2015 UTC,TPS's UVHM is way easier than BL2's UVHM. The damage scalling is different and not exponential.
Borderlands,3brfb6,Xyanite,5,Wed Jul 1 18:12:52 2015 UTC,The damage scaling is still exponential in TPS but to a lesser degree. Gearbox knew how annoying it was to only have your gear last about 5 levels so they made health and damage scale less quickly as you level up. Shouldn't really be affecting the difficulty though.
Borderlands,3brfb6,aleph_thiago,4,Wed Jul 1 19:27:44 2015 UTC,5? More like 2 levels in UVHM lol

The first DLC was absolutely god-awful.  The Holodome was a typical slaughterdome and level cap increase.  Sold for $10.

Borderlands,3brfb6,checo70x7,9,Thu Jul 2 12:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think there was a certain expectation among many borderlands fans that it would be equal to the second game in content and quality.  That might have been a false expectation but it existed nonetheless and it failed on both counts.  Numerous game-breaking glitches at launch, some of which persisted for a significant time (long enough that they were nerfing gear before fixing some of them iirc) gave people a bad experience and that created a negative buzz.  That sort of snow-balled when people realized that you could not farm many of the bosses for their assigned drops until relatively recently.    I think many people moved on or back to Borderlands 2 before they fixed the problems and just wrote the game off.  That is really a shame, because it shaped up to be a solid game IMO and a very enjoyable fix for playing in the Borderlands universe.  Now, man people only remember those negative aspects and have written it off.  IMO 2K Australia handled the rollout poorly, perhaps rushed it before they ""fixed"" some of the problems and that resulted in a poor reception.  Gearbox has since fixed almost all the issues and released an excellent campaign DLC to supplement the main game."
Borderlands,3brfb6,CriticalFaceTime,3,Wed Jul 1 15:39:00 2015 UTC,"I really liked leveling up my character in TPS, because the Skill Trees were really good designed (still don't like Nisha though) and I think that the story was totally cool.

Can't put my finger on why, maybe because they rehashed a bunch of BL2 jokes, but I didn't laugh more than once or twice in the entire game (as opposed to BL2 where I was chipping for air more than a few times).  I also hated the Oz thing. Not the items, they were a lot more interesting than relics, but the fact that you had limited air. It was never ever an issue or something I had to really play around because you had so much air and it was so easy to get more air, but it was still this stress thing you always had in the background and it didn't add anything to the game."
Borderlands,3brfb6,Vect_Machine,3,Wed Jul 1 18:33:06 2015 UTC,"Well, the situation with The Pre-Sequel is similar to Batman: Arkham Origins. It's a spin-off farmed off to another developer for the sake of cashing in on the series' success. It's essentially the second game but in a new skin. It introduces some new mechanics/story elements but ultimately doesn't really differ itself from the previous game and is sort of weighed down by a few questionable design choices/lack of polish.  'Least, that's how I see it."

Borderlands,3brfb6,valeforXD,2,Wed Jul 1 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it, but I'd say there is little to any replay value with it. I played through once with a friend as Claptrap, outside of that novelty I would never suggest ever using Claptrap. I still can't even complete the trophy for him because while the joke is funny at first, it grows tiresome as most of his perks are absolutely useless. The other characters add however and Athena makes the game perfect for solo runs.   The issue is mainly that 2 was just so well put together. It took the flaws, issues and downsides of 1 and built on it. I sank way more time into 2 than I did 1. Pre-Sequel shouldn't be billed as a separate game and should have just been released as an expansion. In the Handsome collection, for those who didn't pay for it, it works.."
Borderlands,3brfb6,pabulous,2,Wed Jul 1 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"For me, they're tied. Pre-Sequel's anti-grav mechanic was awesome, the humour was great (I am biased, being Australian), the characters and their skill trees were better (subjective, but Claptrap and Jack are fun to play as) and the grinder was a cool idea. It also has the better opening level (The first hour of Borderlands 2 is hella boring to me for some reason).  But Borderlands 2 has more interesting side missions, more likeable characters, is longer and better paced, and has the better DLC. There's also more variety in areas.  I understand why people may not like TPS, but that doesn't mean I like it any less. They're both fantastic games."
Borderlands,3brfb6,Eternity42Immensity,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:34:05 2015 UTC,"I still enjoyed the gameplay a great deal, and returning characters such as Claptrap and Handsome Jack were still fun. However, my main issues lied with the new characters, who were incredibly dull, and in general the writing felt weak, like they thought it was funnier than it actually was. Humour came naturally in the first two games but it felt so forced in TPS. My dream would be for the writers of Tales from the Borderlands to helm 3. Additionally, I felt the level design was incredibly poor, everything felt lumped together at random with no cohesion or flow, as if it had been designed by a bunch of children."
Borderlands,3brfb6,30SecondsToFail,2,Wed Jul 1 18:21:13 2015 UTC,"All the characters in TPS are returning characters (except Auriela, I think.)  The main writers from BL2 were on the writing team for TPS as well, if I'm not mistaken.  Not saying you are wrong about the level design, but I thought the areas were beautiful and packed with color and detail.   Pickles and his entire quest line, Nisha's action skill, and limited oxygen were the biggest sore spots for me. Luckily, I can mostly ignore the second two. Pickles, though. He's our Jar Jar now."

Borderlands,3brwwe,Zaaptastic,3,Wed Jul 1 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"There is an interesting Maya build that utilizes shock self-damage weapons such as Moxxi's Slow Hand, the Transformer, and Backdraft. Backdraft gives bonus fire damage to your melee attacks and also releases a fire nova every time your shields go down.  Here's how the gimmick works. For some reason, if you hit yourself with a shock Slow Hand, the Transformer absorbs it. However, this counts as depleting your shield, and then instantly entirely refilling it. This means that Backdraft will be procced every time you fire at your feet with the Slow Hand.  With +11 in Backdraft, this actually does enough damage to mob with fairly mindlessly. It's the best way to simulate being Hellborn Krieg as Maya, since the healing on the Slow Hand ensures you won't die to standard mobs.  The Transformer is the key in this build. I believe any Shock self-damaging weapon works, such as a Norfleet or Topnea, but only the Slow Hand has lifesteal."

Borderlands,3bsg79,slai47,2,Wed Jul 1 21:31:30 2015 UTC,"Rolands ammo regen is such a convenient thing to have in 4 man parties. Lilith is probably the most OP character in BL1 if your talking about dps, Brick is fun but since melee doesn't scale well into late game, your left with a rocket launcher build (which isn't that bad)"
Borderlands,3bsg79,KingMe42,-2,Wed Jul 1 21:46:14 2015 UTC,"Lilith is probably the most OP character in BL1 if your talking about dps   She's on par with Roland. Brick and Mord can out-DPS her by far, and Mord has the highest in the game."
Borderlands,3bsg79,brandpanz,-1,Thu Jul 2 00:51:10 2015 UTC,"As someone with level 61 of all characters, no, not even. Brick dps is low since rocket launcher in BL1 kinda suck. Roland has decent dps but only with assault rifles and shotguns. Sniper Mordy has the loest dps BUT he has the highest hit damage, meaning he can 1 shot just about anything, that doesn't equal to high dps. Lilith ont he other hand with smgs has the highest dps (as in how much damage she can dish in 1 second) in the game."
Borderlands,3bsg79,KingMe42,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"Brick dps is low since rocket launcher in BL1 kinda suck.   Without COMs he can have up to 110% extra damage for all weapon types, with an extra 30.5% if the weapon is explosive. Far higher than Lilith's measly 40%. He can also have +60% fire rate and +20% reload speed as opposed to Lilith's +35% fire rate. Add in a COM like Blast Master and the differences get even bigger, even when using Mercenary.   Roland has decent dps but only with assault rifles and shotguns.   Try a Heavy Gunner COM: you get a dramatic increase to both gun damage, fire rate and especially magazine size to all weapons.   Sniper Mordy has the loest dps BUT he has the highest hit damage, meaning he can 1 shot just about anything, that doesn't equal to high dps.   Mord has Relentless, which has the potential to be the most powerful skill in the game. You know Money Shot? This skill was Money Shot before Money Shot. Yeah. It's that good. And that's not all he has: he has Gun Crazy, which, provided RNG is good, effectively doubles your pistol DPS, and Killer, which gives all of the damage Lilith can deal without COMs in one skill. And before you say ""but that's just damage, not DPS"", note that Mordy can achieve +72% fire rate on all weapon types as opposed to Lilith's +63%, as well as an extra +110% for pistols.  Try Blast Master Brick with an Ogre or Gunslinger Mord with a Double Stalker or a Masher Unforgiven or Anaconda, and compare them to Mercenary Lilith with a Torgue Anarchy. She has nothing on them. Lilith may be the easiest, but compared to the others, aside from SMGs, snipers and combat shotguns she's lackluster.  side note: The level cap is 69, not 61. And yes I've gotten everyone to that level."

I have pirated Borderlands 2 a long time ago, put about 700 hours of solo play into it on different characters, my favorite being Zer0.  In the recent summer sale I purchased Borderlands 2 just to ""support the devs"", while I already played it for a long time, it felt right to do.  Long story short, yes: you can play solo, and it still is a lot of fun."

Borderlands,3bqknq,Eddyaknow,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"I've played BL1, 2 and TPS almost exclusively in single player.  A friend bought BL2 with me and he moved on to the next game after about 4 days.    I think the game has a lot going for it in single player, you won't annoy anyone exploring new places or jumping around trying to find chests.  You can take time to enjoy the story and do optional missions at your own pace.   My only problem with single player is the insane difficulty of ultimate vault hunter mode in BL2.  The enemies gain intensely huge health pools AND now regen health over time.  Using a slag weapon (elemental debuff to increase damage taken) on your foes is now necessary rather than an option.  Doing this solo on UVHM is painful and unforgiving.  It just got to be a pain.  I liked opening up on a pack of bandits with a few headshot sniper kills, then switching weapons to deal with the incoming foes.  In UVHM the bandits can now survive 20+ headshots.  That being said, I haven't played BL2 since summer '14, I don't know if anything has changed, I was pretty disgusted with UVHM.  I'm enjoying TPS but I'm not too far into it, just got it on the summer sale a few weeks ago."

Borderlands,3boz6j,bullet4mv92,2,Wed Jul 1 12:29:57 2015 UTC,Could have sworn the Tales said she got Aespis from Atlas.
Borderlands,3boz6j,beastgamer9136,27,Thu Jul 2 07:05:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and on the whole there's not that much time between TPS and the end of BL1.  The difference in build I just attribute to a different model for Athena (especially since the time between making BL1 and TPS), but the loss of the battle-suit is probably just distancing herself from Atlas, while the shield I'd guess is a piece of Atlas tech that she salvaged from Knoxx's Armory."
Borderlands,3boz6j,Driesens,14,Wed Jul 1 00:25:41 2015 UTC,"I get that they had to make a different model for her, but she went from looking like Zer0 to looking like Axton in body structure. Except more feminine. And if she really wanted to distance herself from Atlas, she'd stop wearing default red, black, and white, get rid of her blade, and cover up the omega symbol on Aespis."
Borderlands,3boz6j,oniiesu,16,Wed Jul 1 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"When we see her in BL1 is directly after the assassination mission where she killed her sister and swore her revenge. Since then she has slain all but a handful of well hidden Atlas employees, almost single handed, with fucking swords. Atlas soldiers all wore armor, some piloted mech suits. The sheer amount of repetitive exertion she had to endure may be able to account for her physical change.   Atlas trained their assassins to be lithe, fast, and highly skilled; not one men armies. Assassins are meant to get in, kill their target, then get out as quickly as possible with little to no opposition. Athena changed that when she started dicing dudes left and right.  Also, look at the other characters from BL1 who changed in BL2. Brick, oh my god, that fucker went from huge to hulk, but that was to be expected as his main thing was just PUNCH EVERYTHING! Mordy even gained some muscle tone, probably from slashing wildlife with his knife. I honestly don't see much difference in Roland, but it seems that since BL1 he went from less of an active combat role to a command post, so it make sense. Lilith gained some muscle tone, not much, but if you recall her ""melee"" was a psychic blast more than a physical punch so I am totally okay with that.  As for the distancing herself from Atlas... I never got that vibe from her. I believe she wears the Atlas gear because she identifies herself as a monster who hunts other monsters, and probably uses the gear because it makes Atlas employees shit themselves in fear when they see what their corporation has created.  Of course, I'm just pulling this all out of my ass, but this is how I make sense of it."

Borderlands,3boz6j,v3xx,4,Thu Jul 2 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"Doesn't look to me like they changed her face that much.  Really just smoothed those cheeks a bit, which is probably due to engine differences but would happen anyway if she just put on, like, 3 pounds.  They did change her eye color, by the look of it, though, which is... curious.  Other than that, I think any differences we can see have more to do with her hair being tied up in that helmet-hood, rather than falling next to her face (which gives both her hair and her face more volume.)  As for her body type, I don't see a huge difference there, either.  In BL1, she's wearing a skin-tight stealth armor suit.  In TPS she's wearing more loose-fitting adventuring gear.  She's obviously got more muscle mass on her arms, but aside from that, she doesn't look more bulky, to me, it just looks like she's wearing more clothes."

You obviously aren't winning on the value of the box, since its all going to be garbage they bought super cheap, but its about the experience of opening it and not the actual use of the stuff inside.  Its like the reddit gift exchanges. You are spending twenty bucks (on someone elses gift) to get something that you would never have bothered to buy yourself, but its fun to anticipate opening a mystery box and whatever is inside is always worth more than if you had bought it yourself.  If 20 dollars is a sum of money that means anything to you, lootcrates probably not for you. If you don't care about the twenty bucks and just want a neat thing to open, its for you."

Borderlands,3bn131,echelon3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"That's kinda how I feel. I know that the items in the box are probably worth about $20, but I actually don't care about some of the series or things, so the actual value is much lower for me. My wife had got me a year subscription for our anniversary, but I don't think I'm going to be renewing once the year is up. It's nice, but not that nice."
Borderlands,3bn131,luthin2000,13,Wed Jul 1 03:01:14 2015 UTC,My wife and I got our first loot crate because of the Borderlands loot. I'm happy with the mouse pad. Just wish there was more Borderlands stuff than just that
Borderlands,3bn131,gir722,13,Tue Jun 30 16:04:18 2015 UTC,Yeah... This is my first and most likely last crate and the only items worth the (discounted) price were the shirt and the mouse pad.
Borderlands,3bn131,dubmountain,5,Tue Jun 30 16:10:56 2015 UTC,It's true. I was really hoping for a cool borderlands bobble head or t-shirt.

Borderlands,3bn131,AnonymousMaleZero,12,Tue Jun 30 17:55:59 2015 UTC,Honestly?  Aside from the t-shirt and the mouse-pad I was kind of disappointed by this month.
Borderlands,3bn131,_deffer_,5,Tue Jun 30 16:11:17 2015 UTC,They stopped shirts for a while so I quit. If they contributed the shirts I'll come back.
Borderlands,3bn131,Vickshow,5,Tue Jun 30 16:14:04 2015 UTC,Optimus Prime shirt this month.

They had a 'retro 80's' themed one several months back and one of the included franchises was Ghostbusters.  I'm a huge Ghostbusters fan so I promptly signed up and thought I'd give it a shot.  It honestly wasn't terrible overall, but I was very disappointed with the Ghostbusters item.  It was one of those stupid things you hang on a door knob that has a picture on it.  How very cool."

Borderlands,3bn131,J_Dwight,2,Tue Jun 30 17:42:56 2015 UTC,Lootcrate has been shit for months. A mouse pad does not justify 20dollars when you can buy similar online for a fraction of the price.

It's literally a $20 bill a month for some cool stuff.  Maybe not the best every month, maybe not something that you're in to completely, but I've been able to get away little parts of it for months now for presents or just to some of my friends.    $20 for a box of stuff when I can go out and spend $20 on 2 mixed drinks feels like a pretty good deal to me."

It uses a different com, and different skills, and different weapon choices. It is a different build and not even remotely in the same ballpark as this one imo."

Borderlands,3bprlo,averagepersonish,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:34:51 2015 UTC,So once I beat the warrior will the missions be 50 or will they be whatever level I am?
Borderlands,3bprlo,Dragosayian,3,Wed Jul 1 04:42:25 2015 UTC,"In TVHM the level cap for missions is 50. If you are level 53 when you beat the warrior the missions will all be level 50.  In Ultimate Vault hunter mode everything scales with your level, so starting UVHM at 53 or so with gear that is level 50 is going to be a bit of a rough start."

Borderlands,3bprlo,xkillo32,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:09:34 2015 UTC,Just a quick note; not sure if this is common knowledge. any missions that you have already accepted will stay at the level you accepted them. (If you started a mission at lvl 42 its still going to be lvl 42 even after you beat the warrior) Only missions that have not yet been accepted will scale to 50 after beating the warrior in TVHM.
Borderlands,3bprlo,slimjim72384,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:27:04 2015 UTC,do all bosses also scale to level 50 or they stay the same level?

Borderlands,3bq878,McRibbles,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:38:16 2015 UTC,"Level, character, and skill set up?  There should be a fast travel station right before the Wilhelm fight. Use that and do Tiny Tina's missions until you get the Teapot. Proceed to rip Wilhelm a new one. It's definitely possible without a corrosive weapon. Harder? Definitely, but not impossible. Keep a loader alive near you at all times to get an easy second wind, take out any healers Wilhelm spawns, and just focus on him."

Borderlands,3bq878,MindWeb125,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:57:15 2015 UTC,"Do you have any slag weapon? If so try and stay as far back as possible and avoid his stomps and his spiny whirl things. Use your deception if things get hairy. Take out his surveyors or get them to as low hp as possible (for a second wind) and just slag and swap essentially. If you don't have any slag/corrosive weapons I would recommend using some golden keys (and if you don't have any quickly get some codes off of duval magic or simply search ""golden key shift code"" and find your appropriate platform).Once you get a corrosive or slag (or even better, both!) Wilhelm is ALOT easier. Good luck!"

Borderlands,3bplsf,domino271,3,Thu Jul 2 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind a little bit of customisation, but I would still expect 'classes'.  Something I could sort of see working is each class has their action skill as usual, but they have 5+ skill trees. You only get access to 3 trees though, and that'd be based on some early level decisions or something?  I'm unsure of the idea though. I'm the kind of person who plays every class, and I'd need a good balance between classes with a unique foundation and being able to customise that to my liking."
Borderlands,3bplsf,vSmash__,2,Wed Jul 1 03:34:30 2015 UTC,Would be cool if you could greatly customize your vaulter then choose the class. Not sure why you guys jumped to making your own class. I'm sure he meant making your own character.
Borderlands,3bplsf,itsanfo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:46:42 2015 UTC,"I would simply say that they should add more customization options to their already created characters. Like in B2 u could change heads and bodies, and while the heads were awesome, the majority of bodies were simple color changes. I would want them to add a more variety of bodies to choose from and more customization. However, they should still create their own distinct characters in the story, but with tons of customization options."
Borderlands,3bplsf,ErkiB,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:06:21 2015 UTC,I could see this being possible if they just had the different classes with premade builds like normal but you could just customize the looks.
Borderlands,3bplsf,JavelinTF2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"Skill trees in themselves are a form of customisation. You can choose how you want to play your character based on your build. Eg melee zero v sniper zero. Sure this falls off in late game when you can cap two trees but I think the custom play experience is already there. Plus balance, if you had too much control you'd just break the game."

Borderlands,3bptov,AppleJuice3010,3,Wed Jul 1 04:38:38 2015 UTC,"Character level isn't increased, which means:   Most enemies you fight will have a skull for being overleveled, this means you get a damage penalty and they get a damage bonus when in combat with you You don't get any more max HP or melee damage after 72 Axton's Turrets and Deathtrap will still scale to level 80. This used to not be the case and they just got one-shot the moment you put them down in OP8. That's still more or less what happens but at least now they last a bit longer You can use any OP gear you've unlocked in any OP level you've unlocked.

Borderlands,3bnp3k,Jatsala,7,Tue Jun 30 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"Most Seraphs have a pretty unique gimmick, and that makes all of them pretty unique. Unique and practical, however, are two entirely different measurements, and unfortunately the lack of impact many of the gimmicks have makes a lot of Seraphs weapons impractical in actual use. A lot of Legendaries, Uniques, or even standard purple/E-Tech weapons will outclass Seraphs.   That being said, outside of high OP levels, Borderlands is not about playing in the most efficient way possible. It's about playing with the style you find the most fun. All Seraphs weapons are at least usable, and therefore if you like one of them you should definitely consider using it even though it's not top tier gear.  Actualizer: Honestly feels more like a pistol. Compared to other SMGs, the slow fire-rate really hurts DPS. Not real point using it compared to the Bitch/Sandhawk or even a Plasma Caster. Usable, however.  Ahab: Being extremely high damage per rocket benefits particular niche uses where you want to land a single, high-impact shot. Eg: setting off a Bloodsplosion Chain, Flakker-swapping, or use with the Pimpernel glitch on Gunzerker. For actually getting out of FFYL though, the Norfleet is better.  Blood of the Seraphs: Due to how trash health regen is in UVHM/OP levels, this is pretty useless.  Devastator: It usually just feels like you're shooting a much worse DPUH.  Evolution: For a defensive shield, this tends to be outclassed by the Blockade, since the regen is not actually very practical.  Patriot: Difficult to use because of the low projectile speed and the accuracy loss is definitely extremely hindering. That being said if neither of those things are important, this is usable. You are, however, hard pressed to find a situation where neither of those things are important at a sniper's range.  Retcher: Splatguns are pretty meh overall  Seraphim: Would probably be a pretty solid weapon if Assault Rifles had crit modifiers that made sense  Tattler: A pretty controversial weapon. It's raw DPS is technically the best in the game for SMGs without considering the Bee, but it is usually impractical to be close enough to pull that off. Even with it's high DPS it's still not as high as the top-tier shotguns such as the Conference Call, and definitely comes nowhere close to the Interfacer, and therefore these shotguns tend to be favored at the range where the Tattler becomes effective.   Big Boom Blaster: Would actually be very useful if the Logan's gun + absorb shield interaction did not exist. Ok alternative method though, and definitely slightly more practical for when you're hard pressed to find a break to use Logan's gun.  Crossfire: One of the best ways to keep an entire area of enemies slagged. Due to the sheer amount of grenades/bullets it produces, it also becomes one of the best ways to keep bosses that have slag-resistance slagged (ex: Terra).  Hoplite: Not sure about good, but I've had some pretty hilarious times using this in co-op. The huge capacity makes it a workable gimmick with the Mechromancer Buck Up glitch, and typically ok in UVHM with Blood Soaked Shields.  Meteor Shower: Suffers from the problem of most Mirv Grenades in UVHM: it will probably kill you before most of the enemies in the room.  Might of the Seraphs: The melee damage can be nice on some builds, but most melee builds don't really rely on Overrides.  O-Negative: Honestly a very good Transfusion grenade if that's what you need.  Pun-chee: Not sure why you would ever want a Roid shield with low delay, but hey maybe it has a niche use.  Sponge: A worse Sham that's easier to obtain. Capacity isn't too important when you're using the Sham anyways, since most of the damage you're taking you will be immune to.  Breath of the Seraphs: I'm not sure if this is active for Zombie builds, but if it is, then hell it's probably decent. I'm unsure if the Health Regen inactivates the gimmick of Zombie Maya, though.  Hawk Eye: The single-shot huge damage gimmick is already filled by the Pimpernel, but admittedly you can get more than one of these per playthrough. However, you aren't going to be reliably OHKO'ing things in UVHM with this.  Infection: If DoTs were better, this would be a pretty good gun.  Interfacer: Yeah this thing is ok I suppose /s  Lead Storm: Like Seraphim, this would be a great gun if ARs crit modifiers weren't so bad.  Antagonist: One of the best shields in the game, and often the most popular shield for Maya/Zero when not using the Bee. The utility and survivability of this shield are amazing. Definitely worth getting.  Blockade: Like the Antagonist, a extremely good survivability shield. However, this shield gives up the slag utility for raw damage reduction. I believe this shield is bugged such that you always get the full damage reduction regardless of the shield's capacity (or even if it's empty).  Florentine: It is unfortunate that this weapon can't reap the full benefits of slag due to the half-slag half-shock gimmick, but it is still a great SMG by virtue of being a glorified Plasma Caster. The utility of it is also rather good, you can open a room clear by firing this at all the enemies to strip shields and slag, then switch to a fire weapon and slaughter everything.  Omen: Like the Octo, it will take a while to get used to the fire pattern, but this becomes one of the best shotguns in the game.  Seeker: Actually pretty good for Anarchy Mechromancer builds, but still not ideal.  Shadow of the Seraphs: With the proper class mod, you can reach 100% double shot chance on Zero with this relic. Can be fun to use when you aren't exclusively using sniper rifles or high-recoil guns (since Two Fang's second shot still incurs the recoil accuracy penalty).  Stinger: By virtue of being a glorified Vladof Anarchist, this is one of the best raw DPS pistols."
Borderlands,3bnp3k,Zaaptastic,3,Tue Jun 30 20:58:19 2015 UTC,"I'll mention that the Evolution is my go-to shield when taking on the Ancient Dragons, since Adaptive shields in general seem to be perfectly suited to that fight. In most other scenarios, I'd agree that the Blockade is better.  The Lead Storm also has a niche in certain Gunzerker builds used mainly for farming Terra, where you wield a Lady Fist in your left hand and abuse the massive crit damage coupled with the fact that the unlisted pellets on the Lead Storm get full Bee damage. On most other classes you're better off Beehawking, but the Gunzerker obviously can't burst fire a Sand Hawk while gunzerking, and the Lady Fist dramatically speeds up the fight."
Borderlands,3bnp3k,JebusMcAzn,2,Tue Jun 30 22:07:16 2015 UTC,Seraphim and Lead Storm are both still really good despite the crits. ARs in general are underrated tbh.
Borderlands,3bnp3k,brandpanz,2,Tue Jun 30 22:11:38 2015 UTC,"I really love the Antagonist shield. There is no legendary shield I would like to use more than this one. Except when I'm playing melee Zer0 obviously, but when I change into a sniping/shotgun build, it's always with the Antagonist."
Borderlands,3bnp3k,CriticalFaceTime,2,Tue Jun 30 20:51:47 2015 UTC,The Big Boom Blaster is about as Axton as it gets. Not as good for launchers as the Sham is but better at keeping you alive.

Borderlands,3bmlmn,CriticalFaceTime,13,Tue Jun 30 13:06:04 2015 UTC,I went and looked at it on the wiki it just seems like the sham with a large capacity and lower absorb chance.

Borderlands,3bmlmn,Daemmerung,6,Tue Jun 30 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"It's not a Sham, but it's not trying to be.  It's a high-quality Absorb shield with both capacity and absorb change improved.  Unlike Sham, you can expect it to serve as an actual shield against non-bullet attacks, so it's not a completely situational piece of gear.  Big Boom Blaster would be my shield of choice from that vendor, were it available in UVHM."
Borderlands,3bmlmn,derklempner,2,Tue Jun 30 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"Unlike Sham, you can expect it to serve as an actual shield against non-bullet attacks...   Not to change subjects...  I just got my first Sham last night while playing Axton for the first time. Just using the Sham through the Angel fight, I figured that it was pretty much a waste for even such a low-level item and character (my Axton is level 27 I think, the Sham around 25).  I thought legendary items were supposed to be better than the items I'm getting from golden keys."
Borderlands,3bmlmn,cannons_for_days,4,Tue Jun 30 19:49:57 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, the Sham is only ""best-in-slot"" when you know you're going to be fighting bandits.  EXP-Loaders, ION-Loaders, RPG Loaders, BUL-Loaders, PWR-Loaders, Surveyors, and Hyperion Hawks all completely bypass the absorb step, and lots of Hyperion enemies have painful non-bullet options anyway."
Borderlands,3bmlmn,Daemmerung,3,Tue Jun 30 20:38:20 2015 UTC,"The Hawks' rockets bypass Absorb shields?  How obnoxious!  Absorb shields do absorb many other rockets, including those from Blaster Goliaths and Heavy Nomads."

Hrm.  It might be time to go grab Axton and collect some data."
Borderlands,3bmlmn,Daemmerung,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"Alright I get the idea behind this shield. But still, I don't understand why there is such a big distinction if it comes to usabilty with all these seraph items. Would anyone ever use a Sponge over an Antagonist or an Infection over a corrosive Interfacer? They all cost the same, but are definitely not worth the same."
Borderlands,3bmlmn,wingsday1,7,Tue Jun 30 15:10:04 2015 UTC,"With six characters and many builds possible for each character, there's more than one way to play it.  Always.

Borderlands,3bmlmn,Xyanite,3,Tue Jun 30 15:29:28 2015 UTC,that would be true if:   they added in enough mini-bosses to allow those weapons to be realisiticly farmed they made the raids more accessable to soloplayers and upped the droprates
Borderlands,3bmlmn,wingsday1,5,Tue Jun 30 22:15:48 2015 UTC,"Nope. A bunch of the seraph items are essentially half-assed legendaries, which makes no sense considering in most cases it's easier to farm a boss for a legendary instead of defeating a raid boss ~10 times to get 120 seraph crystals."

Try searching ""borderlands fov"" in youtube and check pret 123's video of it. About 4minutes 50seconds in he shows and explains the wasd binds. Have fun in Pandora!"

Borderlands,3bpen7,Captain_Kuhl,4,Wed Jul 1 02:15:02 2015 UTC,"Ignoring the fact that I work for Gearbox, I was once in the same position as you: making the switch from 360 to PS4, so Cross-Save was not an option for me (other than a lowish-level Commando I had on Vita). My thinking was, screw it, I love the game, I'll just start over. The thought of starting over for me was pretty daunting, but man was it ever rewarding once I got started. It really did make the game fresh for me again. Little things like re-unlocking the trophies was really exciting. Also, it wasn't entirely like starting over because I had all of my previous BL knowledge there with me too. Things moved along a lot more quickly than before and didn't feel like I was having to play catch-up all that much.  Another thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has both standard versions of HC on sale right now for forty bucks, so if you were thinking about pulling the trigger, so to speak, now would be a great time to do it.   Not to turn this into a sales pitch or anything, but again, as someone who loves the games as much as you do, I'd highly recommend revisiting them with a clean slate!"

Borderlands,3bpen7,Kris_Sipper,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:57:58 2015 UTC,"Only reason I won't go PC is because my laptop isn't that great, and I dunno when I'll be getting a decent desktop (it's more of a question of when I'll have the space for one than anything).  The worst part is, I think the secondhand copies are only $5 cheaper at Gamestop (pawn shops are iffy for new gen console games, and I don't really trust Craigslist games anymore), so I'd rather just pay the extra few dollars for a guaranteed usable copy that won't possibly need to be exchanged."
Borderlands,3bpen7,ScootaLewis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:13:08 2015 UTC,"Sucks to hear that the second hand copies are only 5 bucks off and the lack of space for a desktop, with regards to the collection $45 isn't bad for both borderlands 2 & TPS just be aware that non-Australians will miss out on a lot of small pop culture references and thus some of the more humorous elements of TPS but it is still worthwhile IMO"
Borderlands,3bniqx,Dunsel_,2,Tue Jun 30 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"EXP is split equally among everyone.  Loot is usually rarer and 'better' overall the more people that play.  Its the same amount of chests as solo play, usually people take what they need/want and leave the rest"
Borderlands,3bniqx,TilDeth666,2,Tue Jun 30 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"Xp is the same for both players. 400 Xp for you is the same as 3 other players unless they are higher or lower levels then the enemies.   Loot is awesome. Everyone can see the same loot as you. In fact, if you both see something you both want, you can duel, trade, or even share loot through Dooping (easy process).   After boss battles same loot chests for characters but as mentioned previously items can be shared easily.   I'm OP level 8 if you need help with anything. My psn is bertplove. I have ps4"
Borderlands,3bniqx,bertlove,2,Tue Jun 30 18:00:56 2015 UTC,Well the loot system sure is interesting. So if we see a sweat legendary item that is dropped and you and I both want it we can duel for it? Like red dead redemption style? I'm level 55 gaige so idk how the lopsided levels will affect the gameplay for us. I'm on ps4 as well.

It's more like just a normal battle where you can jump, shoot, and use skills. It isn't level balanced haha. But we can make a copy of the weapon in the game so we can both have it. It works every time."

Borderlands,3bl89e,OzWu,68,Tue Jun 30 03:15:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. TPS was a good game, but BL2 set the bar extremely high"
Borderlands,3bl89e,hobowithabazooka,8,Tue Jun 30 03:48:07 2015 UTC,"BL2 in many ways was the perfect example of a sequel.  It took everything that was good about the previous game (co-op, loot, powers) plus everything that was bad (continuous desert, lack of base story, uninteresting characters, poorly named and described loot) and  it all better.  TPS was in many ways what you don't want in a sequel, it was all the exact same elements from the previous game and didn't make anything better, instead everything either felt recycled, reskinned, or made worse.  The new characters introduced felt less interesting, the jokes were the same, and the story, while it didn't feel shorter, it felt like a checklist (we have to explain why Jack is evil, we have to explain where the robots came from).  THAT is my biggest problem with the pre-sequel: it fell into the same trap of the Star Wars prequels.  I neither want nor need an origin story for every little thing."
Borderlands,3bl89e,htallen,2,Tue Jun 30 17:39:00 2015 UTC,That is kind of the problem though. There wasn't much to change from BL2's system because there wasn't very much wrong with it to fix for the next game.
Borderlands,3bl89e,Predawncarpet,4,Tue Jun 30 20:50:27 2015 UTC,That makes Pre-Sequel more of a cash grab than a legitimate sequel though.
Borderlands,3bl89e,cybersteel8,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:26:16 2015 UTC,then why'd they need another game?
Borderlands,3bl89e,DatGrass14,2,Wed Jul 1 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"You don't make new games for the purpose of fixing things that you didnt perfect in a previous game. That's why we played TPS and will play BL3. If you were to play a game and say ""everything in that game was done perfectly"" you wouldn't see a sequel game and think ""well the last one didn't have any issues so I won't play this one."""
Borderlands,3bl89e,Predawncarpet,28,Wed Jul 1 05:40:25 2015 UTC,"I like TPS for how it helps set up the plot for Borderlands 3 (Spoilers: Watcher and ""War is coming Vault Hunters""). I like cryo, I like lasers, I like double jumping. I like how the skill trees were set up- every tree had a half-way game changer skill, and the characters had freaking things to say.  So yea, while boring at time, I think it brought some good things that will hopefully be seen in future BL games."
Borderlands,3bl89e,Mechanatrix,10,Tue Jun 30 06:00:35 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge most people enjoyed the laser weapons, so I doubt they remove them in BL3."
Borderlands,3bl89e,Mechanatrix,11,Tue Jun 30 06:34:01 2015 UTC,"I really hope they also bring back eridian weapons. I played BL2 before BL1, and I can actually see why some people liked BL1 weapons better- I hope we get a sort of mix of all three. Some of the older style guns mixed with the new, lasers, e-tech, and eridian all together."
Borderlands,3bl89e,bitties,3,Tue Jun 30 07:00:46 2015 UTC,"I thought eridian weapons were awesome, but they never seemed on par with other weapons at the same level.  I think the best eridian you could get was green too, or am I remembering wrong?"
Borderlands,3bl89e,nosferatu1011,7,Tue Jun 30 14:01:49 2015 UTC,Psh that eridian shotgun was a game changer. Instant death.
Borderlands,3bl89e,uhmerikin,3,Tue Jun 30 14:04:29 2015 UTC,the one with the fire rate of 0.2?
Borderlands,3bl89e,nosferatu1011,5,Tue Jun 30 14:32:25 2015 UTC,"Nah, I managed to get one that the fire rate was awesome on I guess. Blue balls of electric death everywhere"
Borderlands,3bl89e,Mystic_Taco,13,Tue Jun 30 14:38:29 2015 UTC,"I personally didn't like TPS because the story was pretty boring at most parts, and I really didn't care about majority of the characters. Not to mention leveling seemed extremely difficult to do, since enemies didn't seemed balanced. The thing that really hurts it though was the lack of post-game content. BL2 had 3 major story DLCs that all added post game Raid Bosses, along with the Digistruct arena, and the HeadHunter DLCs. Going from having that much content to one kinda short story DLC, and an arena mode, just makes the game feel kinda empty. But overall yes TPS is a fairly good game, that has some pretty good qualities about it. That being said it's only good if you don't take any of the other games from the series into account. As a standalone game it would be fun to play, it's just kinda shitty in comparison to the game that came before it."
Borderlands,3bl89e,theblackfool,7,Tue Jun 30 04:25:16 2015 UTC,"I thought the story was fine, even if it was a bit slow at some parts. But yeah, the lack of content was a downer for me too. The game is shorter than 1 & 2 and has less dlc than both of them. The Claptastic Voyage was a step in the right direction for the dlc, and they should make more like it that attempt to tie up more holes in the story (cough Fall of New Haven cough). I imagine that if the game was as acclaimed as its predecessors we'd have gotten more, but it's not even just the length of the game that bugs me. It really feels like there's just less of everything outside of gameplay. Remember in BL2 how Jack was always bugging us via ECHO? That established him as a villain in the game and made us want to kill him along with the other terrible stuff he did. We don't have that with Zarpedon, which is a damn shame considering she had the potential to an amazing antagonist. Compared to Jack, even in TPS, we hardly speak with her at all. It would've been awesome to hear her constantly try to dissuade us from taking back the Helios station and tell us about how much of a monster Jack would be, and maybe even have some special conversations with each of the vault hunters (particularly Athena comes to mind since they're both from military backgrounds). That's what bugs me the most: they had this amazing setting and cast of characters, yet in comparison to BL2, did so little with them."
Borderlands,3bl89e,Laskeri,3,Tue Jun 30 06:11:46 2015 UTC,"Well, showing the Fall of New Haven would be a hole in itself because Athena is narrating and Athena wasn't there. Only Wilhelm and Nisha were."

That implies that while she might not have been directly responsible for it, she was either there at the time or at least knew what happened.  Idk, I'm sure they could've worked it out somehow."

Borderlands,3bl89e,thepiltdownman,6,Tue Jun 30 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"I think it means that the main reason that Sims 4 is not considered a good game, is because Sims 3 exists. It applies to lots of games."
Borderlands,3bl89e,Xfazedout,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:32:39 2015 UTC,"Sims 3 was a massive project that took EA 6 years to develop, so the Sims 4 didn't seem as good in comparison. The ""Sims 3 effect"" is not a real thing, I was just making a comparison."
Borderlands,3bl89e,Dizmn,6,Tue Jun 30 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"My only problem with TPS was not enough content (DLC or part of the main game). I think opposite to the suggestion though - after the low grav physics, lasers and cryo, I would probably have found thenormal  grav and slag to feel limiting in comparison."
Borderlands,3bl89e,Sykarax,6,Tue Jun 30 05:59:39 2015 UTC,"Well I got both of them during the steam sale, and played tps first (I already knew what happened in 2 so it wasn't spoiled) and I loved it, but after a first playthrough of tps, I played through 2 and looking back on the pre sequel, it just feels underwhelming compared to 2. However I'm glad I played through tps first because I know if I played 2 first tps wouldn't have been as fun to play"
Borderlands,3bl89e,theblackfool,2,Tue Jun 30 04:10:24 2015 UTC,"I figured as much. I had started playing 2 again shortly before I bought TPS, and I think that caused me to take a bit longer to enjoy the game as much as I do now"
Borderlands,3bl89e,NoDawnForMan,5,Tue Jun 30 06:15:17 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Part of my issue with TPS was that I just burned myself out on borderlands, and TPS didn't provide a large enough departure to feel fresh.  I don't blame the game for that, I got exactly what I was promised."
Borderlands,3bl89e,Gallifrasian,6,Tue Jun 30 14:31:27 2015 UTC,"Borderlands 1 was flawed, It was very flawed. It received a very mixed reception, Some loving some loathing. There was a lot that needed to be improved and when a sequel for Borderlands got announced not much was expected of it by the average gamers. Borderlands 2 ended up shocking many gamers with how it managed to reinvent a fun world while still keeping it true to what the first game was all about. You get this different feel with Borderlands 2 you know? The difference is with TPS the jump isn't all that big so the impact seems to be so much less even though in the end you're getting the same thing more or less, As developers have made clear its treated more as a ""spin off"" as such."
Borderlands,3bl89e,Kris_Sipper,5,Tue Jun 30 06:32:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think TPS is just in a weird spot in general. Like, yeah it's treated as a spinoff, but at the same time it is canon."
Borderlands,3bl89e,cybersteel8,6,Tue Jun 30 06:37:44 2015 UTC,Most spin-offs are canon. They just usually have little impact on the main plotline.
Borderlands,3bl89e,1karl1,5,Tue Jun 30 14:33:31 2015 UTC,"The tricky thing with TPS is that it actually does make a lot of nice changes and additions (low gravity, boost/slam, lasers and cryo weapons, faster leveling, generally more interesting skill trees, dialogue for the playable characters, the grinder, etc), which might make it hard to transition from that into BL2. But BL2 is absolutely the stronger game in terms of actual content (better story, more varied environments and enemies, a lot more stuff to do), which can make it hard to transition from that into TPS.  If you could combine the good qualities of each game, you'd have something damn near perfect. Here's hoping for BL3..."
Borderlands,3bl89e,criscothediscoman,3,Tue Jun 30 17:12:23 2015 UTC,"I played BL2 like 2 or 3 years ago and I don't think I ever finished.  I'm just starting TPS (lvl 10) and I'm loving it so far.  As far as content, I can't say yet, but I do very much enjoy the gravity and character dialogue.  They're honestly just as interesting as BL2 characters if you care enough to listen.  If you play as Jack's clone for example, you find out that he probably has an explosive in his face that will detonate if you try to remove the face.  Leveling seems a bit tougher, though."
Borderlands,3bl89e,diabetess,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:36:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I felt like leveling was much easier up until you hit level 50. That's the only time I really had to do a lot of backtracking with bosses and the mutator arena. I just recently got my Nisha to lvl 70 and my Athena is still only lvl 66 despite being on the last story mission in UVHM. I even did all the doc beforehand"
Borderlands,3bl89e,Semigloss01010001,3,Tue Jun 30 18:03:17 2015 UTC,I really like the characters skill trees in TPS.   Athena is awesome to play with but the rehash of weapons was a real bummer .  Do you think they will keep cryo and slag in BL3 ? How about a new element ?
Borderlands,3bl89e,Kris_Sipper,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:04:48 2015 UTC,"Tbh I had been hoping they'd ad cryo weapons to the 2nd, although slag was still really interesting. Unless we start traveling to other planets in BL3 I don't have much hope for seeing it again, since the reason they were only on Elpis is because Pandora didn't have the methane supply for them."
Borderlands,3bl89e,cybersteel8,3,Tue Jun 30 17:55:32 2015 UTC,"E-Tech weapons in BL2 were kinda like lasers, maybe they'll reinvent TPS's lasers using E-Tech?"
Borderlands,3bl89e,Semigloss01010001,3,Tue Jun 30 23:32:30 2015 UTC,Gameplay & graphics-wise TPS is barely recognisable as a Borderlands game compared to BL1 so i'd have to say no & add that i'd probably like it a lot less tbh  . Plus there's the spoilers for BL2 at the end of TPS . I don't hate the game i play it solo now & then but think the double jumping & slamming made the mobbing less fun & killed MP co-op for me .
Borderlands,3bl89e,_darkwingduck_,2,Tue Jun 30 15:54:02 2015 UTC,Yes.  Guns are a huge chunk of the game (about 25% of the experience) and most of them being rehashes didn't leave much room for error in other aspects of the game.
Borderlands,3bl89e,Predawncarpet,2,Tue Jun 30 13:52:01 2015 UTC,"My friend and I played through BL2 right before TPS came out and we both were kind of disapointed at the time of release. We only played a few hours and stopped. However, now that it's been quite a few months and we haven't played in a while were playing through it and we've been enjoying it thoroughly. We needed to take a step back and now that we did I can say its a fun game for sure. I wouldn't say it's as good as the previous two but good nonetheless."
Borderlands,3bl89e,theswerto,2,Tue Jun 30 15:57:24 2015 UTC,I like tps. My biggest gripe with it is probably the leveling flow. I felt like I kept backtracking through the same zones over and over at least in the first half of the game. Plus a lot of zones felt so similar which added to that backtracking feeling.   I still like the story and the game but I just can't get into it as much as bl2

Borderlands,3bqyq2,guzymanya,10,Wed Jul 1 20:15:47 2015 UTC,"""He made fun of her sexuality""  No, he was rude to her after she told him she wasn't into guys.  But sure, I'm sure if someone of a gender you weren't attracted to came up and started being aggressively rude at you simply because you weren't into them, you'd have no issue.    You should probably do something other than vehemently hate a fictional character, especially if you're going to twist the things said (that are written down, by the way, I mean, it's a script, so there's not really any arguing.)  I personally remember her sexuality only being mentioned a couple times but I also don't really give a shit so maybe it didn't stand out as hard in my mind  Also find it odd you have no problem with Moxxi who has been around much longer and is MUCH more open with her sexuality but I guess that's for you to ponder over"
Borderlands,3bqyq2,vahndragonwing,-13,Wed Jul 1 13:17:47 2015 UTC,hahaha gotta love this. Gotta defend her because of diversity. The Pre-sequel in general has much worse writing than 2.  1. that is not a reason to want someone to die. 2. I have a right to voice my hatred of her as much as do anything else on this board that revolves around borderlands. 3. It is mentioned far more than it should 4. Because moxxi doesn't put emphasis on her sexuality and she doesn't act like it needs to be defended. It is treated like normal. Emphasis isn't place on the details of it. it just is. Hammerlock isn't like I like men so women can stay a- way. Sammy from the preserve is like any other character.

We know Torgue and Axton are Bi, this was before TPS. What is the sole reason for diversity? That she's a prominent Australian on the moon? Also, admitting the universe was 100% homosexuality means 2K Australia actually did something different by using it as a plot device."
Borderlands,3bqyq2,Weltall548,-2,Wed Jul 1 16:31:56 2015 UTC,I cringed whenever Springs mentioned her sexuality because It's so painfully obvious she's there for the sake of having a gay character.  Why is anything critical of Springs being downvoted if this exists?
Borderlands,3bqyq2,beastgamer9136,0,Wed Jul 1 13:45:29 2015 UTC,You know that Athena is gay right?
Borderlands,3bqyq2,Weltall548,-1,Thu Jul 2 07:11:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but she didn't obsess over it"
Borderlands,3bqyq2,beastgamer9136,0,Thu Jul 2 13:00:29 2015 UTC,Who obesses over that?

Borderlands,3bne5p,locoloro,5,Tue Jun 30 16:46:15 2015 UTC,"theres only one dlc that involves a new area. its the claptastic voyage and i gotta say its pretty awesome. theres also the holodome but you can compare that with the bandit slaughter and other ""kill waves of enemies"" crap in bl2."
Borderlands,3bne5p,NaturalPanic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"Aurelia is in my top three characters in the series, so if you really like sniping, go for her. Jack I hear is a ton of fun and has some game-breaking builds but I haven't tried him.  The Holodome is terrible, but gives you a way to grind bosses that aren't repeatable otherwise.  The Claptrap DLC is somewhere in quality between Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt and Torgue's Campaign. It has the same decent but sort of bad writing, but some cool environments and a new weapon rarity that does strange things.   All in all, they're really not worth it. If you want new characters, give them a shot, but the Holodome isn't worth it and the Claptrap DLC is basically just five more hours of campaign-quality missions."

Would be interesting to see but would be a pretty big change in course in the borderlands franchise. I personally enjoy the single-player with drop in/out Co-Op."
Borderlands,3bij7q,spartan1124,3,Mon Jun 29 15:01:14 2015 UTC,like the usual borderlands with perhaps an additional mmo like mode once you beat the story which offers another way to level maybe?
Borderlands,3bij7q,DELIBIRD_RULEZ,3,Mon Jun 29 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"We need a big change like that. Many of the negative criticism TPS received was because it was very similar to BL2. For me I'm good with it being similar, and would buy another sequel like this in a heartbeat, but people are pushing for changes like that, and considering their options, more MMO elements are one of the best. I'm glad they hired someone experienced on this genre to help them create what I'm sure will be another great game."
Borderlands,3bij7q,SpartanA009,2,Mon Jun 29 15:27:04 2015 UTC,"My biggest complaint with TPS was that it was Bl2 with less content, much easier, and with a stupid story."
Borderlands,3bij7q,callumrulz09,8,Mon Jun 29 23:02:48 2015 UTC,I thought the overall gameplay was a lot more enjoyable though.

Borderlands,3bij7q,Mattpoppybros,-4,Tue Jun 30 10:41:20 2015 UTC,Wasn't a lot of criticism of borderlands 2 that it was too similar to borderlands 1?

Borderlands,3bij7q,PuuperttiRuma,3,Mon Jun 29 21:10:21 2015 UTC,"Did it really? There were a lot of significant quality-of-life improvements, but outright changes?  Manufacturers have gimmicks, elements have been altered slightly (slag isn't new, it's just taking corrosive's damage buffing and putting it into its own element), skill trees have one-point-wonder skills, and, oh, there's an actual story, and not everything is brown anymore. Those I think are the ones that are generally seen as good. I'd add the different loot drop system but it seems like as many people hate it as like it. And all-in-all... that really doesn't seem like much of a change.  I feel like TPS's low gravity and oz kits were probably the most significant gameplay change in the series, far more than what BL2 gave us."
Borderlands,3bij7q,DELIBIRD_RULEZ,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:53:51 2015 UTC,"The main thing that separated BL1 feom BL2 was polish. BL1 was the first of it's kind and thus was successful. BL2 did what Bl1 had done, but better. So in some sense you could say that while BL1 was a diamond in the rough, BL2 was that same diamond cut and polished. In that regard, its understandable that people want to see something more different. We've seen this diamond as beautiful as it can be, now people want a diamond necklace made of it. Pardon the metafores."
Borderlands,3bij7q,John_Duh,2,Tue Jun 30 15:55:01 2015 UTC,"Tbh i didn't follow the series back then so I don't know, but that would push gearbox even further for a major change."
Borderlands,3bij7q,weaver900,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:40:01 2015 UTC,My thoughts on BL3 was that they where doing it in a MMO way but during development they noticed the market shifted and many MMOs went under before any real profit could be made. So what Gearbox did was change some development resources to get Battleborn out to get some profit to fund the change of what they have to the same model of BL we already have (co-op/singleplayer).
Borderlands,3bij7q,KingMe42,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:28:27 2015 UTC,So... Destiny then?

Borderlands,3bij7q,KingMe42,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:44:32 2015 UTC,"Hopefully. My point is that the game with the highest budget ever for a video game lead by a company that's been making triple A bestsellers for decades, had all of the problems you just said. I don't want borderlands 3 to have the same problems, so perhaps following the same ""Half-MMO"" design isn't a good idea."

Borderlands,3bij7q,unkillable94,16,Mon Jun 29 15:05:19 2015 UTC,Saturated market and contracting player base.  I'd never invest in one.
Borderlands,3bij7q,Daemmerung,11,Mon Jun 29 15:06:25 2015 UTC,"Do you have statistics for the playerbase decreasing? I've been playing MMOs on and off for 10 years and the community feels as strong as ever. As for market saturation, there are tons more notable games coming out each year than notable MMOs, and the same goes for lesser known titles."
Borderlands,3bij7q,unkillable94,4,Mon Jun 29 15:19:01 2015 UTC,"I do not, as I don't work in marketing.  I am repeating hearsay from friends of mine in the industry, some of whom have worked on MMOs in the past.  It is certainly possible that a new MMO could capture the players abandoning the last generation.  I presume that that was Destiny's gambit.  That'd require a hard pivot from the successful couch-coop strategy of the Borderlands series so far, however."
Borderlands,3bij7q,BassNector,7,Mon Jun 29 15:24:40 2015 UTC,"Destiny isn't a good example. It claims to be an MMO but in the traditional sense it really isn't one. It wasn't unsuccessful because MMOs are failing as a genre, it was unsuccessful because it was bad."
Borderlands,3bij7q,ScorpioWTF,4,Mon Jun 29 15:29:28 2015 UTC,It depends on what type of MMOs we are talking about. World of Warcraft has DEFINITELY fallen in subscribers. Less and less people are playing. They've got a hardcore fanbase who've either been playing since Vanilla or Burning Crusade and they get a rash of new players with an update and not a lot of them stick around afterwards.
Borderlands,3bij7q,GhostdadUC,-4,Mon Jun 29 15:37:54 2015 UTC,That's because of League of Legends. There's a direct correlation between Leagues rise and WoW's fall
Borderlands,3bij7q,skillphiliac,12,Mon Jun 29 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"Correlation does not mean causation and League is definitely not the reason that WoW is losing players.  Wow is failing because of its age more than anything else.  There is only so much you can do before a game becomes repetitive and runs out of possible content.  I played from Vanilla until this current expansion and the game is just boring to play now when you have sunk so much time into it.  I've played every class, done almost every raid, played a crap ton of PVP, collected mounts, yada yada yada and it just doesn't catch my eye anymore and almost all of my friends agree.  Now, are some of the players that used to play WoW playing League now?  Probably.  League is a great title but to think that WoW has lost millions of subscribers solely because of League is incorrect.  PS - None of us play League of Legends."
Borderlands,3bij7q,Daemmerung,7,Mon Jun 29 19:34:32 2015 UTC,"So far this comment thread is pretty ridiculous, but saying that LoL has anything to do with decreasing WoW subscribers is just hilariously over the top. Not a chance."
Borderlands,3bij7q,unkillable94,0,Mon Jun 29 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"Give me a better example than mine, please.  What's a successful new player in the MMO space?  Those vanishing WoW subscribers must be going somewhere.  Are they all in the F2P space?  Firefall and its ilk?"
Borderlands,3bij7q,GhostdadUC,5,Mon Jun 29 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"Archeage is a big one. So is EVE. TESO released a few months before Destiny and it has no shortage of players. And then you have countless other games on Steam.  WoW is ancient by MMO standards, it's 11 years old. It's the classic granddaddy of MMOs, up there with runescape. It's really no surprise that after over a decade people are moving to a newer generation of MMOs, it's like saying the RPG is dead because Morrowwind doesn't have as many players as it used to, they just found newer games in the genre to move on to."
Borderlands,3bij7q,likwidstylez,4,Mon Jun 29 15:47:37 2015 UTC,EVE is not a big one.  That game has never had a large player base.
Borderlands,3bij7q,CT_Legacy,4,Mon Jun 29 19:35:54 2015 UTC,So is EVE.   This was on /r/Games Frontpage yesterday http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3bfbtb/eve_onlines_online_player_count_reaches_the/  The extensive time requirements of the game coupled with an aging player base are basically killing EVE off.
Borderlands,3bij7q,SpartanA009,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:55:23 2015 UTC,"Want to point out as well that EVE:online also allows you to play free with in game currency.  WoW is doing just fine. Yes the number fell. They also rose back up when Draenor came out. Now are falling again. Will rise again next expansion, then fall again. It's a cycle. But I'd say holding on to at least 5-6 million subs at the low point is not bad at all.  Clearly Bungie isn't an MMO game. And I feel most MMO creations lately are completely missing the modern model of gaming. Wildstar failed miserably for a game that's really awesome.  The model is F2P with micro-transactions.   Let's look at the most successful games right now. Hearthstone, Dota 2, and League of Legends. (you can argue for CS:GO which is small fee to buy then F2P)   What do all these games have in common? They are absolutely free*, they let you spend money to upgrade your experience (100% cosmetic and doesn't give you anything you can't earn for free in some way) and they are highly competitive and really fun to watch.  If ESO followed this model. Was F2P from day 1. Let you purchase gear skins, weapon skins, mounts with real money as well as in game currency and had a really good PvP scene then I think they would have done a lot better.  With that being said. If Borderlands is looking to go MMO style. I highly suggest they incorporate these main keys to modern success."

Borderlands,3bij7q,AaronC31,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:15:40 2015 UTC,"No it wasn't. Bungie developed Halo: Combat Evolved independently, that includes multiplayer and campaign. Gearbox then ported the game for a windows release two years later, and the port had a lot of issues. Halo multiplayer was not ""originally brought to you by gearbox"" that's just flat wrong.

Before anything they were most known for Half-Life Opposing Force and Counter Strike: Condition Zero.  Then there was this very popular WWII franchise (One of the most popular WWII games, I might add) called Brothers in Arms that had a few games out there.  Just because YOU only know of Borderlands from Gearbox doesn't mean it's their only good game.  Good grief..."
Borderlands,3bij7q,The-JerkbagSFW,3,Tue Jun 30 02:33:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call Opposing Force or CS:CZ series considering they are stand alone games. Brothers in Arms had two well received (high 8/10s, generally) games. Every game after that has dropped in rating and are mostly iphone games. In addition I don't think BiA had essentially any cultural impact, certainly not on the scale that Halo did.   So yes, I think its fair to call Borderlands Gearbox's only respected series."

(CL4P-TPs Mohawk or Hammerlock's bully fur hat) I think those people that like Borderlands but never move onto TVHM, UVHM, and the OP levels would be infinitely more inclined to play multiple playthroughs if the story could be panned out multiple ways. In this way I think the ESO guy might be good news, considering how the Elder Scrolls series as a whole champions that type of narrative."
Borderlands,3bij7q,otheranotherbrother,12,Mon Jun 29 19:45:06 2015 UTC,"""TVHM, UVHM, and the OP"" - I don't move on to these because they are so fucking stupid.  Diablo 3 really got on to something with their ""Adventure Mode""  I'm not sure how BL could implement it, but christ I do not want to repeat the same goddamn quest 3-4 times just to get the best gear."
Borderlands,3bij7q,otheranotherbrother,3,Mon Jun 29 20:32:54 2015 UTC,What is Diablo III's Adventure Mode?
Borderlands,3bij7q,v3xx,7,Mon Jun 29 19:50:30 2015 UTC,"Basically after you beat the game once, you unlock Adventure Mode.  Adventure mode is the entire map of Diablo III, all acts, put together as ""one"" with no locked routes, no quest or boss required to defeat to go from one zone to the other.  The game still separates the maps by Act, and generates random quest (kill X mobs, Kill X boss mob, Collect whatever) for each Act. Completing all quest within an Act gives you special shards to be used for either gambling for items, or unlocking a special dungeon.  It REALLY gives the game a lot of replay-ability and is pretty well done, and they've done a lot to improve on it since implementing it.  Why I prefer repeating ""random"" quest over repeating ""story"" quest? I am not forced to sit through cut scenes, constantly have to sit through the same dialog, and it's designed to give longevity to end game via special shards used for other purposes.  Can Adventure use some improvements, sure, but I think it's a feature any ARPG (of which BL is a child of) should really think about implementing."

I was about to pick it back up, then I saw there's a major expansion coming out, so I figured I'd wait.  See, while I'm fine with the sphere grid in FFX, I don't like it for Path of Exile.  In FFX, if I make a mistake or two, I'm not really worried, because there's a way to fix it fairly easily, and I know eventually I can take over the whole grid.  Meanwhile, in PoE, if I make a mistake or two, it's not easy to fix and it can cause some dire consequences as I move on to harder and harder difficulties if I didn't pick the ""right"" spheres.  shrug to each their own, though."

I've done all the difficulties with all the characters as well as running friends through the story mode. I've played the game at least 30 times by now. I get how people would get bored of it but being in my top 3 games I enjoyed it.

Borderlands,3bij7q,otheranotherbrother,6,Mon Jun 29 18:10:57 2015 UTC,"yeah, a ""normal"" with pre-set levels, and a ""hard"" with level scaling is all that's needed, with the ability to just reset the hard mode to the beginning whenever you feel like. Done."

You got new enemies and new challenges, but the best part is that by then you already had a sample of what unique and legendary guns you liked, wanted, and needed. It allowed you to go through the story 1 more time while using the weapons you mostly enjoyed, as well as making your character just a little bit better.   Tho my god OPlvls was fucking dumb."

Depending on how drastic the changes were, sure. But I've played enough ""choice"" driven games to know that it would dramatically shorten the length of the game if they went that route. Which I'm not saying is necessarily a bad thing, but most likely not the direction they want to take the game.  Plus BL feeds a lot off of having a single canon for it's story. Alternative choices would really detract from some of it."

You do not need PS+  Use gibbed to change the PC save to a PS3 save and use the required tools for PS3 (like bruteforce) to make the save belong to your profile. Then move it over via USB. Start up TPS and upload your character.  That is the only way.

Go on gibbed, open the PC save and change the little selection box to ps3 and save it to desktop. Then follow his video."

While this isn't quite a top tier sniper by any means, it's still very usable and can be really fun to play with as a challenge.

It would drive me crazy not to be able to throw a grenade or kill with a nova/spike/etc shield, both to vary the playstyle and to give me more use of novel loot drops.  I've always included grenades in challenge runs.  Which makes my challenge runs less challenging than yours.  I. have. been. out-challenged.  Surprised that you didn't spec into Kinetic Armor, seeing that Termination Protocol's shock arcs were permissible."
Borderlands,3bj4wg,Soriul,2,Mon Jun 29 17:28:28 2015 UTC,I find krieg and gaige two sides of the same coin tbh. They both just use chaos and mayhem to kill everything. Krieg with his BAR and gaige with anarchy and close enough bullets flying everywhere. Both are extremely fun and my two favs.  Got a krieg to 72 and my gaige is 45 and climbing. Classes with straightforward gun play are too boring now lol.

Borderlands,3bd9h9,Real-Terminal,6,Sun Jun 28 09:48:42 2015 UTC,"The problem is, that doesn't solve the problem Bandit has, which is the fact that a large magazine doesn't make up for shitty stats. Vampire isn't a good enough trait to make up for it.  Bandit and S&M need to be differentiated more, perhaps making Bandit weapons have poor accuracy and higher damage that causes a bleed effect, and S&M being naturally more penetrative, doing extra damage to armoured enemies and penetrating multiple targets, because sex.

(Also, I always thought the super magazine sizes more than made up for the general low stats of Bandit weapons, besides, their damage levels were already decent enough)"
Borderlands,3bd9h9,NEXT_VICTIM,2,Sun Jun 28 22:34:09 2015 UTC,Maybe they come back as a revolvers only company. It's the only thing they are capable of after nearly being driven out by bandit?

She pretty much acts as your leader during the raid to take back Helios because Jack is too dumb and you're clearly too much of a derpa derp to even push buttons without her condescending aid. She went from sex joke to a master manipulator who is shown to outsmart pretty much every other character she interacts with.
Borderlands,3bd9h9,LividWonk,3,Sun Jun 28 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"Two things wrong with your complaint.  First, Pre-Sequel was not made by Gearbox or written by Burch, it was made by an Australian studio.   Second, you're essentially complaining that a character has gotten actual development, a very vital part of story writing.  She isn't overused, she has an expanded role which has already been alluded too, she went from being a onenote sex figure to a well rounded character with connections and plans and relationships.   It seems your complaints stem just from not liking her character, and you lack the ability to appreciate her character development."

Borderlands,3bepev,Daemmerung,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:34:29 2015 UTC,Oh right. I'm using a Prodigy class mod at the moment but I've switched between that and an Anarchist one. Both aren't that special though (Blue tier) but I've been making the most of it. A friend of mine recommended that I use Golden Keys to get a Calculating Anarchist mod that gives +5 to Fancy Mathematics so that I drop just 1 point into FM and have more to spread over.  Running currently with a proficiency relic to make DT's cooldown even faster. But I also switch it with a Pistol Aggression one for when I need more kick from the Unkempt Harold to get out of situations.

I only spend points in MoSS if I'm running a classmod that buffs it (Necromancer, which also buffs So5G, for a reasonable Deathtrap buff between the two).  At this point I'd probably put the points in the first tier of LBT.  More Pep for a greater slagging probability, or Myelin, or both.

Anarchy doesn't increase melee damage, only gun damage. Her capstone in Ordered chaos is ok for some healing, but overall guns should be your main source of damage.     maylay shields and no blood shields, or nova and blood shields?    up to you. You could always go for any shield with a huge capacity to go with blood soaked shields. If you get the capstone of the BFFs tree, you can give Deathtrap your shield, which synergises well with a roid shield. Other than that, I think that nova shields are better for general gameplay.     Im going to switch to melee at level 30 for with claws, how should I get to 30? BFF or anarchy but with guns?    I would recommend putting one point in Anarchy then going down the BFFs tree. The shock tree is overall not worth it, BFFs gives you nice survivability and buffs to Deathtrap. At level 30 you can just respect to whatever you want."

No problem, here is continuous novas untill it kills something and completely refills your shield with blood soaked shields thus resetting the nova! Also as deathtrap is constantly in the line of fire his shield is always depleted and he becomes a walking (floating?)pillar of death..  Anarchy gaige is a blast, never tried melee gaige. Get yourself a good shotgun and get either a massive shield or a shield that will murder stuff upon depletion and those sync up really well with anarchy and BSS.  Singularity grenades are great as well, they pull everyone into a tight group then run up with a shotgun (assuming full anarchy) and murderfy everything  Farming with her is a pain in the ass at times though as save and exit gets rid of anarchy and your main damage dealing source. Flying enemies can also fuck off."
Borderlands,3bcq4f,Toriyaki,2,Tue Jun 30 05:40:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, Gaige is a lot of fun!   Anarchy is used with guns, it's really strong, didn't ever see it used on a melee gaige, you could try it but I don't think you could take it through UVHM. Well you need the roid shield to do enough melee damage to kill anything, so you need that. But you won't have blood soaked shield, which is a good defensive perk. And I don't know if the last perk of the Focused Chaos tree is good enough alone as your source of sustain. Yeah it works. You probably want a slayer of terramorphous mod for the additional anarchy stacks. BFF and Anarchy are both fine in normal I'd remove one point in the Nth bullet and put one point in discord to get a way to regen. Rapier+love thumper for damage, and Law+order when you want to regen a lot of life    I hope you'll make this work, even if it's not half as strong as a gun anarchy Gaige."

I myself have contributed, and will paste my ideas here:  DeLorean  Hyperion Shotgun (Face Time/Jakobs Barrel)  ""Like one in a film I've seen."" - Increased mag size, default 8. Consumes one ammo per shot. Starts with low projectile speed; each successive shot without reloading has faster projectiles, and at a certain projectile speed (8th shot without speed buffs such as Maya's) shots become Incendiary and deal hugely increased damage.  Double Anarchy  Dahl SMG  ""No one man should have all that power."" - incredibly high fire rate, low accuracy (approx 50-70), on-par damage with other SMGs, no element. Fires four bullets at the cost of two ammo. (Port of the old anarchy SMGs from BL1)  The Gonne  Jakobs Pistol  ""One of a kind is always special."" - single-shot magazine, though it can be increased by skills and such. Very high damage. Massive recoil reduction. Very fast accuracy recovery. Middling reload speed. Weapon ""put-down"" time increases the longer the user holds out The Gonne; at its longest it can take 5 seconds to put away The Gonne. It also becomes faster to pull out the longer it's away. Other weapon swap speeds are unaffected.  ""Panic Button""  Dahl Grenade Mod  ""In case of emergency"" - bouncing betty type grenade that shoots elemental bullets and randomly changes element on every bounce. Also explodes on each bounce for damage matching its element before it bounced; basically, the explosion happens before the switch. Can spawn with an element, which will determine the element of the first spray; afterwards elements are again chosen randomly.  Event Horizon  Maliwan Nova Shield  ""Abandon hope."" - Always Slag. When depleted, releases a Slag Nova which applies the slag effect to all enemies in range. High recharge rate and short delay; average capacity.  Hi Roler  Bandit Shotgun  ""Papa Krom needs a new pair of shoes"" - Very high damage for a shotgun - not as high as the orphan maker, but about 70-80% of it. Consumes 3 ammo per shot (bandit barrel). Each shot shoots 1 to 6 pellets. Pellet spread takes the pattern of pips on a die, depending on the number ""rolled"". 18-shot mag, makes for 6 shots. Rolling 3 1s in a row will empty the magazine. The extra pellet count accessory adds a pellet above and below the crosshair regardless of pattern, making it a VERY potent weapon.  Big Daddy  Torgue Assault Rifle  ""YOU THERE. GIRL."" - Vladof minigun barrel, high ROF, shots slowly spiral in on the center of the crosshair, creating a drill-like cone of explosive bullets; shots that go past the end of the cone cease to exist. Bullet speed increases the range of the cone.  Righteous Man  Vladof shock grenade  ""Lay some vengeance."" - grenade flies through the air like a homing grenade, but in a straight line, exploding when it hits any surface. While flying, will shock anything within its relatively large radius - basically a moving tesla.  The One  Tediore Pistol  ""I Know Gun Fu"" - Thrown gun acts like the Fastball grenade mod but with lower damage (based on the model) and a standard explosion radius. Increased damage. Always 1.0 reload speed, cannot be improved further. Increased stability and accuracy.  Weapon material is unique - similar to standard Tediore purple-rarity guns in color, but with a pattern of green letters and numbers that moves as the player does.  Interceptor  Torgue Shotgun  ""That's mine."" - Increased projectile speed. When reloaded, creates an explosive nova dealing massive damage to enemies within range. Always spawns with Jakobs barrel. Weapon is painted matte black, but faded/scuffed.  Ignition  Torgue Grenade  ""It'll get you somewhere."" - MIRV grenade, with 3 child grenades deposited to the left, right and front of the initial explosion. Increased radius. Reduced damage. MASSIVE KNOCKBACK.  Kaos Dunk  Bandit Grenade  ""Everybody, get up."" - Jumpin Biddy type grenade. Bounces very rapidly, like a basketball being dribbled. After a random number of bounces, will bounce in a high arc in a random direction, plummet to the ground and create a singularity before it explodes. Can come in any element.  Basically, imagine a giant invisible basketball player dribbling a grenade then shooting it."

Borderlands,3ba2ls,superjames_16,2,Sat Jun 27 08:27:16 2015 UTC,Yes. So much yes. This is one of the three or four tracks from games that I will always remember. So good.
Borderlands,3ba2ls,CptAsian,22,Sat Jun 27 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"In no particular order:   The Creature Slaughter Dome theme, because it's all oriental sounding and stuff. The Bloodshot Ramparts fight theme, it's like the Quake theme had it been composed by some blues artist and not Trent Reznor. The ambient theme for WEP. I'm a sucker for stuff with pretty arpeggios. The ominous feel also goes really well with the general atmosphere of the area. ""Bring Your Guns"". Hearing this after blowing up the armory was pretty awesome. Also the fight music for Scorched Snake Canyon, the Highlands, Terra and Vorac. (note: the BL2 version is a remix) The ambient theme for the Subconscious (not on YT afaik). imo the Subconscious is the most gorgeous area in the entire series, and the music really helps reinforce that. The battle theme is cool too, but it's when the fighting stops and the ambient music kicks in when you can appreciate how amazing the area's aesthetics are."
Borderlands,3ba2ls,brandpanz,4,Sat Jun 27 06:33:45 2015 UTC,The ambient music for the Subconscious is called 'Accessing The Brain'.
Borderlands,3ba2ls,Xyanite,2,Sat Jun 27 12:24:20 2015 UTC,"I still think the track that hit me the hardest in the Claptrap DLC was the ambient theme for Cluster 00773 P4ND0R4.

Borderlands,3bcrks,Shingo__,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:04:25 2015 UTC,Here's what I've done : first  beat the game on normal mode. I did a lot of sidequest and no dlc at all. Enter TVHM after beating the Warrior and when you're about level 35. On TVHM I did 2 DLC (Torgue and Scarlett). Not much sidequests on TVHM because you don't want to be over level 50 when you enter UVHM  (or else your gear will be level 50 maximum and you'll be over that level). Once you enter UVHM you can do pretty much what you want. I personnaly went quickly to the Sanctuary and now I am going through sidequests and dlc as I please. Farming can be done in every playthrough but weapons will scale to your level only in UVHM. In UVHM you can reset the whole playthrough if you want. Do you have Ultimate upgrade packs ?

Lots of fun heads you can get and plenty of colourful costumes, and the personality can be be big, showboaty and funny.  The action skill would allow for zipping between enemies really fast for melee attacks, I'm imagining that killing a mook with the action skill just sends them ragdolling into the atmosphere because the Luchadora, she is powerful.  Skill trees, one is the Pistolero, focusing on boosting gun damage with a focus on pistols, another, Jalapeno (name could change) focuses on elemental boosts to melee and guns (mostly fire and some acid) with the ultimate skill allowing her action skill to ignore shields, and the last, Tag Team, is the interesting game changer. With Tag Team, when playing co-op you can nominate another player to be your Tag Team partner. Haven't worked this all out but I'm imagining stacks and buffs to do with use of action skills, and if you can get the skill to work in the game without it being annoying, an ultimate skill that allows you to switch places and instantly charge your action skill once your partner has finished using theirs to keep the hurt going."

Percivala power is pretty much nishas power, maybe you can make his power that he scans stuff like ammo, barrels, boxes and maybe hacks them and make then turn into minions of something. Also davids power is very similar to krieg in the sense that your a big bandit doing lots of heavy rage melee strikes. Maybe make him a tall skinny Goliath who moves fast and does quick melee strikes? Because the two melee characters we have had have been heavy hitters and a more ""bruce lee-esque"" character would be cool. Nyx is a fantastic, I can see that character working well. Playing her would be fun because if you find a  badass enemy you could try to make sure you don't gib him so you can  resurrect him. That would be a fun mechanic.

This really pays off with a super shield like the Tortoise.  Combine this shield with Celestial Lawbringer on Nisha for an absurd experience.  9/5 Law connotes a +45% bonus to an already enormous shield capacity.  Low health means that you'll build a stack of Order every time that a hatchling Tork sneezes on you, so Order is basically capped within seconds of entering a firefight.  If the shield breaks, enter Showdown, where 10/5 Bottled Courage will restore it in full, and you'll recover your diminished health in just a few shots.  If Showdown hasn't cooled down yet from the last time, you have the movement bonus and all that Order to protect you.  The movement diminution is not crippling.

I would fight the highest level available, farmable boss so you can save and quit and keep fighting that boss until you're over leveled for him.  My opinion is just play the story missions or side missions. Grinding xp is boring and hardly rewarding. At least doing the mission you have some sort of goal to work towards."

The borderlands engine was expensive to make, and reusing the engine and assets to make a new game was a good way to make money.  However, if the dev team took time they would lose the opportunity to be working on something else. So they have the game over to another dev team, with different writers. Those devs had not learned the lessons that gearbox learned in how to manage dlc, so they made mistakes (giving us another battle arena dlc after underdome was poorly received was a mistake).  Honestly though, the dlc wasn't all bad. Both characters are very fun, rounding out a very strong cast of playable characters for TPS. The one story DLC is very good.

I mean, the guy took the eye of an alien monster that was going to eat Pandora and everyone on it and turned it into a giant space laser that could potentially destroy planets. Yeah, he said it was only for killing bandits, but who decides who qualifies as a bandit? Are we just supposed to trust that he's never going to turn it on anyone who doesn't deserve it? Also, the airlock thing was pretty bad. You can't kill people just because one or more of them MIGHT have betrayed you. That's a shitty thing to do.  And as irritated as I am with Lilith for ordering Athena's execution, I don't think you can say she's the ultimate cause of the events of Borderlands 2. Jack was always going to end up as a psychopath with a messiah complex. Sure, the original Vault Hunters and Moxxi betrayed him. But nobody made him murder everyone in New Haven when he went after them. Nobody made him enslave his own daughter to abuse her powers. That's all Jack. He had wrong things inside him from the get go.   That said, how cool is it that we can have discussions like this? Jack's easily one of the best characters in any medium in recent history."

The closest thing we get to that in the entire series is Roland post-BL1 and Athena post-TPS (note: I haven't played Chapter 3 of TftBL yet, so I don't know wtf was up with Athena being all glowy-eyed and murdery in Chapter 2).    Now that I think about it, if Brick hadn't started the Slabs, he might be an actual good guy.  Him going all Gregor Clegane on Shep Sanders is entirely justifiable in my mind.  The dude betrayed a growing, (comparatively) peaceful community in a land of savages, resulting in it being razed to the ground, and dozens (hundreds? They never say exactly how much New Haven grew after BL1) of innocent people getting slaughtered and/or having to flee back into the wastes from whence they came, hopefully making it to Sanctuary.   Mordy isn't so bad either, as his behavior is entirely self-destructive, which is pretty unique in the BL universe."

Lilith is borderline mental. Roland lacks personality. Mordecai and Brick are cool. They seem normal. And that's weird when you're talking about an alcoholic and muscle man with not much brains.   The second wave of vault hunters hasn't really developed well. We don't know what they are doing right now.   The PTS VH are straight broken characters that are loyal and fight other broken characters. Wilhelm becomes a robot. Misha becomes a sheriff (and has one of the most pathetic deaths).

Borderlands,3b8j9a,crimson117,2,Sat Jun 27 01:40:47 2015 UTC,If you liked the healing abilities I think Athena might be a better choice. She has skills and class mods that regen her health. Also her shield is a pretty awesome impenetrable wall.

She's this weird mix between a tank and an assassin, so if played right she can deal damage even better than she can soak it up. I'd recommend building into her red tree first and if you plan on playing solo most of the time, build into her blue tree second. Her biggest downsides are that she doesn't have her own reliable source of elemental damage and instead has to make up for it by augmenting the elemental effects of the weapons she possesses. Also her blue tree focuses on her melee abilities, and it isn't that effective until you get her cap skill"
Borderlands,3b8j9a,OzWu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:14:19 2015 UTC,at first i liked the baroness but i really dont like her end game. her left tree is the sniper tree and im not really into sniping. the mid tree is cryo and the cryo element is terrible agianst shields so its annoying on uvhm and the right tree is a co-op based tree which sucks when you solo. i really loved the doppelganger though. i cant tell you much about nisha because i got mine to level 10-ish.

Depending on what you told him to do, he says he found out something but never gets the chance to tell you what it is.  Then, he suddenly goes missing.  Finally, they have elements of the costume design that's similar (most notably, the yellow strap on the right shoulder) and the Conference Call being a- presumably expensive- Hyperion gun.

Borderlands,3b7voe,TheSkitcher,3,Fri Jun 26 18:00:50 2015 UTC,Check the AMD control panel to see what the fan speed is set to.  If the fan speed is too low (to reduce noise) the GPU will run slower when it begins to overheat.  Crank the fan speed up.
Borderlands,3b7voe,botman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Checked all my temps and speeds with Open Hardware Monitor. The fans are speeding up like they are supposed to, and they are keeping everything cool.

Borderlands,3b7k01,Cyber_Wizard,3,Fri Jun 26 16:37:04 2015 UTC,"Wilhelm was much better solo than co-op.  His best stuff comes in FFYL so he turns into a liability in boss fights at the higher levels. Corrosive is also his biggest element and it's not powerful enough sometimes.  Based on what youve said, I'd suggest Athena.  For co-op, all you have to do is stay in the front with your friends behind you and you cannot be killed when her aspis is out.  A baroness and a claptrap behind her and youre a tiny triangle of death (they both get skills which will heal her and both can keep anyone from circling around to the back easily).  She gets great fire and shock skills which keep her useful and alive in atmos and vacuum."
Borderlands,3b7k01,Randam0,7,Tue Jun 30 22:02:59 2015 UTC,"Roland was very effective in end game.  The trick is you have to learn how to use the turret.  At first it does do a fair amount of damage, but eventually you will outstrip it.  Then you start using it as a decoy because nothing short of some bosses can take their eyes off of it.  So when it gets hairy, you drop out the turret and run a little away from it and just light up the mobs.  Similar with Axton, but at least the turret[s] help because they can light up mobs with slag and really help you DPS.  Can't help you with Wilhelm as I have only played through my first run because I just don't have the time to play games like I use too."
Borderlands,3b7k01,WreckerCrew,2,Fri Jun 26 18:08:50 2015 UTC,"I hear that Wilhelm has really good survival in Wolf and Saint, but Nisha has the best damage output.  Just don't play Claptrap."

Seriously.   some things just do and don't work towards the endgames of play   ...hence my snark above. In late UVHM or OP tier, okay.  But every character has multiple viable build options, even at that tier.  You just have to be careful about how you build.  If your definition of game completion is 100% achievement, you don't even need to enter UVHM.  YOU CAN PLAY ANYTHING.  Your Roland example is cautionary.  Roland is extremely effective in endgame, built correctly, and will complement Lilith very well.  Just don't expect Scorpio to kill anything.  When you find that your current build isn't working, change it!  It is cheap and easy.  Wilhelm plays very differently from either Axton or Roland.  Wolf does draw aggro, but can't be tactically positioned like the Scorpio or Sabre turrets.  Wolf is deadlier than either of her predecessors, too.  Likewise, Saint pretty much does his own thing, though Wilhelm can choose when/where to Overcharge or Zero Hour.  Nisha plays like a mash-up of Salvador, Zer0, and Survival-tree Axton.  She is not a tank, but like Axton can enter a prolonged state of why-the-hell-am-I-still-alive?, during which she's putting out Zer0-tier damage to kill everybody before they kill her."

Borderlands,3b2yyi,tzvibish,81,Thu Jun 25 15:27:22 2015 UTC,Welcome to the truth!  For me its the desert planet vibe.  Pandora doesn't feel like a desert planet in any other installment.  The environment becomes caricatured rather than the characters in the sequels.
Borderlands,3b2yyi,Androidconundrum,14,Thu Jun 25 17:00:50 2015 UTC,They explain it as a shift in Pandora's season. I just hate how they threw away the sci-fi western theme they had that made borderlands such a unique game.
Borderlands,3b2yyi,hawkman561,13,Fri Jun 26 04:25:15 2015 UTC,I think they listened a little too well to the complaints that every level in Borderlands 1 looked the same.

Claptrap is a silly little robot that makes you giggle.  In BL2 it's like they hired a few autists to make the story so the first thing you hear is claptrap screaming and being ""funny"" and making jokes that would only appeal to 8 year olds (""I wonder what its like having a belly button""). Butt stallion? How old are we?"
Borderlands,3b2yyi,imranh101,7,Fri Jun 26 00:44:47 2015 UTC,That's Borderlands humour though. BL2 killed it by having too much of it too often. BL1 was subtle and charming and the jokes felt less obvious. Nonetheless I loved BL2.

Borderlands,3b2yyi,elronhubbardmexico,3,Thu Jun 25 23:21:39 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear it.  I began BL1 on X360, but didn't progress very far before giving up the 360 and taking the PC gaming plunge.  By the time I looked at Borderlands again, BL2 had been out a while, so I bought it and ignored the original.  250+ hours on BL2 later, I finally picked up the original in the Humble Bundle.  Looking forward to giving it another run."
Borderlands,3b2yyi,Arkteruss,4,Thu Jun 25 21:38:25 2015 UTC,"Here's my thoughts since I literally just finished a first playthrough with Morde.  I prefer BL1 over 2. I put a lot of hours into 2 but never as much as the first game.  To me, I think the biggest inhibitor is just how much of a drag Liar's Berg is.  It's several hours long and is one of the most uninteresting parts of the game.  To the point where I started using a save editor to just make fresh level 10's and start them in Sanctuary with the beginning quests tagged as complete.  I felt the weapons had more purpose and the progression was a bit smoother in 1.  I felt that in 2 you had a huge chunks of time before your next upgrade, which was usually a big leap, but too far in between.  The melding of TMP's and Revolvers and removal of Mashers left an empty space in my heart.  I have a nice 300+ damage Revolver at the end of my first run which is keeping pace with most sniper rifles I've found so far.  There's a lot of talking in Bl2, the humor is pretty spot on but it wears thin after the first 30 times.  Bl1 kept it low key and when someone did have something to say, it usually got a laugh.  I would, however, like some sort of mod to shut Claptrap up after changing zones. ""HELLO! Scooter has a something something! GREETINGS! New missions at the X bounty board! HELLOOOOO Crazy Earl wants something done."" Oh lawd.  I think the story was a little more put together in 2.  It feels like they didn't really know what they wanted out of 1's story. They kind of cleaned it up and retconned some things in 2 and Pre's story, but I think that was just covering for 1's strongest weak point.  If there was anything I could change, it'd be making the Desroyer's Vault the vault that was hinted at all along; a big ass cave with shit tons of loot guarded by an angry monster.  BL2 could've just filled that in with Handsome Jack swooping in and jacking the Vault Hunters shit shortly after it happened, taking over the vault, and gaining an advantage over Atlas to become the galaxy's new super power.  The scaling in 2 is ridiculous to the point that in Vault Hunter mode, most weapons don't feel like an upgrade because it usually takes 3 clips to kill anything.  Coupled with 2's more annoying enemies (shield nomads, armored psychos) killing stuff becomes a chore rather than a pleasure, especially when you start getting to the point where you NEED a slag weapon every encounter.  2 had the right idea of giving shields and grenades more variety, though, that was an excellent idea.  I dislike the Badass System mostly because it's random instead of focused like Profs were.  I feel as though if you could just spend the ranks where YOU wanted, it would've been much tighter.  Ultimately, my dream would be for Gearbox to be willing to say ""fuck it"" to the story and events and come out with some sort of Ultimate Vault Hunter Edition.  What would that be?  BL1 and 2 (presequel too I suppose) in one package. All 3 would run off the same graphics engine.  They'd lean towards making the game more like BL1.  ALL Characters would be playable, regardless of the ""game"" you're playing.  Axton/Zero/Maya/Salvador playable in 1. Morde/Roland/Lilith/Brick playable in 2, etc.  Yes it wouldn't make sense, but I think a lot of people would really go for something like that.  How many hours would you sink into a game like that if they made it?"

Borderlands,3b2yyi,Roaven,2,Thu Jun 25 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"I miss the revolving shotguns and the pump action sniper rifles. They felt more unique than the stuff we got in the second game, and revolvers being separate was also a nice feature."

Borderlands,3b2yyi,Karthaz,2,Thu Jun 25 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly I couldn't get the big hype around Borderlands 1 when I played it, It just feels clunkier than 2 in every way. I think the main factor for this though is that I use snipers on most of the games that I play and sniping on borderlands 1, even as Mordecai, was ridiculously broken. Even with the cross-hair right over a character's head the bullets would veer wildly in random directions, I rarely ever got shots in and when I did it usually wasn't enough to kill most enemies. I'm just going to stick with Borderlands 2."

Borderlands,3b2yyi,Artahn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:08:44 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly argue that the story in Borderlands 1 is a lot more interesting too. While Borderlands 2 gave a lot more up front that the first one did, the flavor behind everything was so rich in BL1, where the story was there for people who wanted it, and wouldn't get in the way of people who aren't interested at all.  My favorite example are the audio logs from a mission you get in the Arid Badlands: the story of Patricia Tannis"
Borderlands,3b2yyi,Voidjumper_ZA,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:02:47 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to agree with you here.   I love the desert planet vibe, loved that outlaw feeling. There were still monsters but they were more toned down, not so 'cartoony.' The music, imho, was much better and more atmospheric. The shoot n loot loop is much tighter. The drops were good. I spent most of BL2 trashing everythig I picked up and using Golden Chest guns (always sat at max keys just checking a site like orcz.com) because drops never felt scaled to the enemies I was shooting.   I definitelty loved BL1 more…"
Borderlands,3b2yyi,El_Giganto,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:09:24 2015 UTC,"Much preferred the first one. I like Borderlands 2, but it just all felt so confusing. After finishing it for the first time (finally...) I just didn't want to go on. The looting is terrible in my opinion. All guns feel weak and just nothing suits me. I thought it was getting better, but I constantly felt the need to overlevel to kill bosses.   Borderlands 2 is a good game, but I just couldn't really get into it properly. Playing with friends was terrible as well. I'm not someone who's going to play with the same person every day, so playing together in that way sucked. Leveling separately wasn't great either, because if someone is a much higher level, it's just boring.   Maybe it's because things were easier in high school and I could play it co op all the way through, but Borderlands 1 in general felt a lot better to me. Played that game a million times."

Borderlands,3b52th,Bakriminel,2,Fri Jun 26 06:54:08 2015 UTC,You all should also know that BL1's co-op mode is a lot more stringent (i.e. shitty) when it comes to missions. You have to be on the same story mission as the host or you won't get the rewards. And it won't let you fast forward if you get off track.
Borderlands,3b5y94,coreyg914,5,Fri Jun 26 06:14:22 2015 UTC,"Salvidor is able to solo literally anything using DPUH and Grog Nozzle, other combos are good but that one is broken.  I can solo most things on OP8 with Gaige, she's my main character and I love all the personality she brings.  She works really well at lower levels, but at higher levels many of her skills become useless (because elemental damage does not scale well), however this can be worked around.  Krieg can do it but he suffers in the OP levels due to scaling issues with his health and melee damage.  Also very fun dialogue.  Maya has some decent builds for general play, and I think she might be the easiest to just play with any gear in the OP levels but beating raid bosses solo requires some specific gear as far as I know.  Zer0 has dedicated fans who will swear by him.  I love sniping in most games (mained Mordecai in 1 and Nisha in TPS), but his sniping tree is lackluster and I really don't like his melee skills or his action skill so I have the least experience with him (got to OP8 but never did end game content).  Axton is generally considered to be the worst character, he has a very good way to slag enemies with his turret so that is nice.  If you go slow you can clear most content but raid bosses will be a real slog."
Borderlands,3b5y94,tikael,2,Fri Jun 26 11:51:12 2015 UTC,Lvl 72 axton here. you are generally right but with the right build pyro pete is stupid easy. The other raid bosses are pretty difficult for sure though.

At the end of the invis, you can throw fistfulls of elemental kunai at people, and with the melee tree you can finish them off with the melee override. I've had times where I'll get to a boss and take them out in a few seconds because of how much damage you can get done with your kunai and melee."

Borderlands,3b3nkq,thedavecan,8,Fri Jun 26 00:14:33 2015 UTC,I still feel soo bad for making him selfcdestruct in episode 1. I just kinda assumed that you could just call in for more loader bots...

Keep in mind that so far, TFTB is a flashback, much like TPS. Ep 3 takes place right before the cutscenes of TPS; when Athena is tied up and telling her story. Brick and Mordy didn't know Athena was a good guy during Ep 3. They were taking her to Lilith for interrogation.  Edit: here is a timeline because this is a little confusing.  BL1 - TPS Gameplay - BL2 - TFTB Ep 1-3 - TPS Athena Cutscenes - TFTB Ep 4-5"

Borderlands,3b3nkq,Brick50,3,Fri Jun 26 00:04:40 2015 UTC,"This. Imagine playing as one of the people you kill as a Vault Hunter in a side-quest -- getting to know them, their motivations, and feelings, and then bam! Killed by some scary mercenary dude/lady because you pissed off someone with money, potentially by doing something really petty. Of the top of my head, I can think of that guy who gave Mr. Torgue's favorite video game a bad review, the robot with love emotions, that Crystal thing you killed to get Moxxi's nude pics, or that one guy Scooter asks you to kill because he stole one of his digitally generated cars."

Borderlands,3b3nkq,Chessolin,6,Fri Jun 26 05:52:51 2015 UTC,"The intro to the Pre-Sequel takes place after Borderlands 2 (enough time for word to spread that Jack had died) but the events of the Pre-Sequel take place before Borderlands 2. This is because after Jack did his whole thing in Borderlands 2 the original vault hunters captured Athena to interrogate her because they knew she was somehow involved with Jack's rise to power.   So Athena was captured and interrogated after Jack died, to talk about the events leading up to his power (before Borderlands 2 hence Pre-Sequel). So this means when Brick and Mordecai captured Athena to take her to Lilith for an interrogation, that Tales for the Borderlands (at least episodes 1-3) runs parallel with the intro to the Pre-Sequel in the timeline.  Does that clear things up? I hope that made sense for you, it is a bit confusing"

This is how it should be  BL1 - TPS Gameplay - TFTB Ep 1-3 - TPS Athena Cutscenes - BL2 - TFTB Ep 4-5  But then again the same mistake Jack is dead if the timeline is like this.  Anyways we can't judge anything until we see the whole episodes maybe this game takes place between BL1 and TPS, maybe Jack died some other way we don't know, maybe Jack didn't died, maybe when Rhys putted a thingy into his head it's just the hologram of the Dr.Nakayama since he was very into Jack  Or this game takes place after Athena already was captured by Mordecai and Brick and Lilith just want Athena for revenge"

I mean I wouldn't consider them evil, but the general atmosphere of Pandora and vault hunting doesn't leave much room for being nice or even the ""ask questions first, shoot later"" sort of lifestyle. I think they were portrayed accurately; they didn't have much time to bother looking at who was shooting at them and even if they did I'm sure any of the characters could be mistaken for a bandit (because I figure canonically Pandora has more outfits than it does in the video game world).   After reading this, I feel like I might be saying what you are in a different way, but if I'm not that's my two cents."

It's freakin Pandora man, everyone is evil."

What we're given is Fiona and Rhys' perspective and that clashes with Brick and Mordy's perspective, hence how they seem ""evil"". We know that Brick and Mordy aren't bad people - sure they aren't very nice either, but they're not cartoonishly villainous, but we don't get their perspective until it comes up in TPS. Vallory probably isn't evil, just working towards a different goal than the PCs. We won't know until the story's over. It's all about perspective."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Awesome4some,2,Fri Jun 26 04:12:39 2015 UTC,"This. Everyone who's pissed about Brick and Mordy seem to forget that Fiona is a con artist who was working with bandits to rip someone off of ten million dollars and Rhys is a guy from the company who tried to cleanse Pandora in fire- who also stole a ton of money and got people killed because of it.  Along the way, the two of them stumbled across a Vault conspiracy and are now following it because they want to be rich and powerful.  That's literally it- sure, Fiona wants the money to get off of Pandora and Rhys wants the power so he can stop being a cog in the machine, but that doesn't make them 'good guys', it just means that they have their own agenda.  Conversely, Lilith and co. hear about a known associate of Handsome Jack, who, until his death, was a bit supporter of mass genocide.  Lilith is still burning from the murder of Roland, who she loved, and is trying to prevent aforementioned mass genocide from happening.  Therefore, it's necessary to bring in this associate and ask her what happened.  Why does Lilith still want to kill Athena, she's such a bitch, weh?  Because she's still in mourning and because she's right: without people like Athena, Jack would never have come into power an killed so many people in the first place.  It's not the right thing to do, but in their dog-eat-dog world, it makes sense, and people have certainly died for less.  Everyone working their own agendas, everyone's at cross purposes, everyone's got a cause, nobody is perfect.  That's why Borderlands is such a great series."

Borderlands,3b3nkq,kdebones,19,Sun Jul 5 01:28:00 2015 UTC,Jesus christ... watching gortys trying to drag Vasquez' corpse had me crying with laughter.
Borderlands,3b3nkq,benalexnewman,15,Fri Jun 26 10:11:36 2015 UTC,"I loved it too. There's been some awesome action sequences in each episode, like Fiona's fight with Flinch and Kroger and Rhys and the bandits in ep 1. The romantic subplot is even a little nice. On a side note, it's cool how Finch and Kroger are voiced by Lee and Bigby's VAs.  And I'm kinda glad that Telltale decided not to kill off any major characters just yet. It's all the interactions that make the story more interesting, not cheap death scenes."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,ABandApart,6,Thu Jun 25 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"Depending on how you answer questions, major characters can die."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,DaveSW777,8,Thu Jun 25 19:16:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you consider them major characters since they're only in one episode, but I got both Shade and Felix killed. And Vasquez, but I'm pretty sure there is no way to avoid Vallory killing him."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,YouAreAScumbag,7,Thu Jun 25 20:58:45 2015 UTC,How do you get Shade killed?
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Nnoitrum,5,Thu Jun 25 22:06:08 2015 UTC,"If you don't allow him to follow you through the air ducts as Fiona (which I didn't, because Shade's a creep) he will get caught in the crossfire when Bossanova breaks in. He gets shot and says something along the lines of ""I really wish you'd let me come with you"""
Borderlands,3b3nkq,YouAreAScumbag,7,Thu Jun 25 23:04:12 2015 UTC,Shade's one of my favourite side characters.  I hope the canon path is that he's alive.
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Tsplodey,6,Thu Jun 25 23:34:36 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to how they handle what's considered canon and what is not with Telltale games
Borderlands,3b3nkq,YouAreAScumbag,2,Thu Jun 25 23:41:37 2015 UTC,"Well, unless the ending has a serious story-changing choice on the scale of Season 2 of The Walking Dead, Telltale plots tend to be fairly linear all things considered, with most decisions simply affecting how characters feel about one another. I'm guessing only the stuff affecting the larger universe (Opening the Vault of the Traveler, whatever happens to Hyperion) is going to majorly affect the series, while everything else can mostly be brushed off to the side."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Vect_Machine,2,Fri Jun 26 08:01:48 2015 UTC,Yeah if I had to guess I would just assume Shade won't be appearing in any more Borderlands games now. Unless they say that he somehow miraculously survived getting shot in the chest.
Borderlands,3b3nkq,YouAreAScumbag,2,Fri Jun 26 13:42:47 2015 UTC,I don't think you can save Felix. He either dies by your hand or by greed.

Borderlands,3b3nkq,Pluwo4,8,Sun Jun 28 00:17:54 2015 UTC,"When I first started the episode I has all kinds of issues (XB1). The music and speech mixer levels seemed to flip at one point and I couldn't see anyone in the intro. I exited to home screen and quit the game fully. After loading it back up I had no issues other than a few choppy animations during QTE or right after decisions.  The episode itself was really cool. I need to go back to episode 1 and make a couple of playthroughs. I feel like episode 3 finally started to show some results from your previous decisions.  The Rys/Sasha falling scene was tops for me: ""I'm letting go"" ""Noooooooo""  Edit: pretty soon we'll figure out why Rhys and Fiona seem to hate each other while telling the story. What happened between them? I'm also really curious who the masked dude is. My wildcard guess? Marcus."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,TSTRO7,9,Thu Jun 25 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if Rhys and Fiona's bickering is actually a ploy to convince Masked Dude that they hate each other, so that they can catch him off guard when they start working together again.

Borderlands,3b3nkq,NoDawnForMan,6,Thu Jun 25 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"This is my hope, too. Their outfits are way too coordinated not to be working together!  Seriously, though. Maybe this masked person is the Big Bad or final boss and this story-telling framing device is a long con. The reveal of finding the Gortys core with the Stranger can't be coincidence, right? Because WHERE'S GORTYS?!"

Borderlands,3b3nkq,Mar7coda6,2,Fri Jun 26 01:53:43 2015 UTC,well at least in my play though Rhys and FI have been friendly (and Rhys has been flirty with Sasha). Sasha being some what of a dare devil kind of person seems to take risks. I have a feeling it's going to be a risk in which Rhys can't save her. (or at least have a option not to). thrus getting her killed. and Fi forever pissed at you.
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Synner40,14,Fri Jun 26 03:02:45 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine Fiona would be super fucking pissed at you during the conversations with mask dude if Sasha was dead, but the worst they really get is like, sibling bickering."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Cupcakes_n_Hacksaws,2,Fri Jun 26 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"I thought that might be the case at first, but it just seems too dark for this series (and yes, obviously Borderlands can get super dark, but still. It takes the emotions of the main characters seriously, and that just seems like too crushing a loss for the story to recover from)."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,NoDawnForMan,2,Fri Jun 26 02:42:43 2015 UTC,if not Rhys then HoloJack did. but it would of ment Rhys allowed jack in. in which I feel like bad things will happen.
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Synner40,7,Fri Jun 26 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"I'm also really curious who the masked dude is. My wildcard guess? Marcus.    I honestly think it's Athena. The way the masked person talks seems similar to ""normal person"" Athena. Also, if I understood correctly, the person already knew something they could only know if they were there. Might just be me being dumb and completely wrong though."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Nnoitrum,3,Thu Jun 25 22:08:41 2015 UTC,"Is present-day Rhys and Fiona's situation concurrent with TPS, though? If it is, then Athena's tied to a post in Sanctuary telling her story. If not, then...well, this is Athena continuing on until she feels her contract was fulfilled, maybe?  Considering the Stranger's reaction if Rhys chose to (or not to) trust Fiona instead of HoloJack, it could very well be Athena."

Borderlands,3b3nkq,Nnoitrum,2,Fri Jun 26 17:19:15 2015 UTC,"Present-day Tales is set at the end of the current timeline, meaning it takes place after all other events in the series. Episode 3 sets up TPS by having Athena being captured by Brick and Mordy."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Vect_Machine,6,Sat Jun 27 10:58:12 2015 UTC,My guess its Vaughn under the mask.
Borderlands,3b3nkq,neogreenlantern,3,Fri Jun 26 02:50:53 2015 UTC,"I thought about that, but Vaughn isn't that tall. And he knows all the thinks the masks guy is asking."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Chessolin,3,Fri Jun 26 13:59:24 2015 UTC,But since the mask guy new about the power cupling it seems he knows more than the questions suggest. I think he's asking the questions to get an idea about there feelings or perception of the events that lead up to the current time. And he could be using the armor to make him look taller. I'm thinking he's asking the questions because they never found him after he went missing and he's trying to figure out if they betrayed him or never went looking for him.
Borderlands,3b3nkq,neogreenlantern,3,Fri Jun 26 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"I lost my shit during the falling scene.

Borderlands,3b3nkq,UnclaimedPants4,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:31:48 2015 UTC,The Masked Stranger has a voice and wit about him that reminds me of general Knoxx.
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Vect_Machine,8,Mon Jun 29 20:42:27 2015 UTC,"Mordy and Brick aren't ""bad guys"" so much as circumstance has forced them to be antagonists. They're here to capture Athena so the Pre-Sequel can happen. Nothing personal (for them anyways). Also, Athena and Janey being a thing was already confirmed in Ep. 2, though it only happens if you choose specific choices.  I'm guessing that Rhys and Fiona being angry at each other in the Modern segments is going to involve Gortys. Specifically, Rhys chose to do something bad to her (destroy her to power something up/rewrite her AI Felicity-style) for the sake of surviving and/or greed, which really pissed Fiona off. Just a theory."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,ifeelwitty,3,Thu Jun 25 20:35:58 2015 UTC,What choice do you have to make in order to see Janey in Episode 2?
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Vect_Machine,4,Fri Jun 26 17:13:59 2015 UTC,You have to have Rhys go to Old Haven rather than meeting the girls in Hollow Point.

At the end of Tiny Tina's DLC (I think), Maya comes up from interrogating the prisoner and asks if anyone wants to blow up a moon base. IF that scene is canon, do you guys think the blowing up would happen before, during, or after Fiona and Rhys's visit?"

Borderlands,3b3nkq,DaveSW777,6,Fri Jun 26 01:40:42 2015 UTC,"i have.  I think they were part of the story because certain sidequests rely on them (even one in TPS...after they decided they were non-canon. WTF?), and one of the very first things you do in the first borderlands is put your DNA into the new-u system, which is referred to as such, and claptrap advertises them using their in-game function rather than fast travel.  It's pretty obvious they were supposed to be integrated into the story at first, but due to handsome jack needing to stay dead they had to retcon them."

Borderlands,3b3nkq,Musely,3,Fri Jun 26 13:05:52 2015 UTC,"Well, Metal Gear Solid has always been weird in that the series is completely self-aware of it's status as a game and characters openly talk about game mechanics, but in this case the New-Us weren't exactly so much a major setting element so much as just a thing that brought itself attention due to the fact that you get pithy one-liners every time you respawned.  Understandably, the listed elements are just gameplay mechanics, but the New U system kind of brought it upon itself in how it kept lampshading itself. Had it been like in BL1 where it says nothing and you just respawned, then people might not have cared as much about why Hyperion machines kept bringing you to life whenever you screwed up."
Borderlands,3b3nkq,Cupcakes_n_Hacksaws,5,Sat Jun 27 11:08:43 2015 UTC,These games have always been amazing at blurring the lines between the good guy and the bad guy and seeing Brick and Mordecai trying to kill Fiona was a highpoint in the whole series for me.

This is exactly where our 'heroes' need to be : at their absolute nadir with their hope at its bleakest.   Same as Life is Strange. A very low point for Max as she is still learning about her powers and learning about the butterfly effect. Can't wait until next month for Ep. 4 of LiS."

Even if he was just trying to trick Rhys, the fact that he even realized that someone else would think that it would have been more efficient to not using murder to solve all his problems seems to be a change from BL2 Jack.   Heck, even the line about him recognizing that he did some questionable things was interesting -- BL2 Jack would never even comprehend that his actions could be perceived as un-heroic."

She had some cute scenes with Fiona and it was nice to see her more fleshed out.  That said, I'm not sure I want to see her again in TFTB.  I mean seeing Rhys/Fiona bs their way through the Vault of the Traveler on their own should make for some entertaining gameplay.  Besides her intricately detailed story telling should have Athena (and most of the other Vault Hunters) stuck on Sanctuary through season 4...  I did feel like Fiona had more development than Rhys this episode as well.  Hopefully Rhys gets more love in Episode 4, I actually enjoy both characters.  I guess he did have that romantic subplot with Sasha, but Fiona had all that mentoring from Athena.  Is Zer0 going to make a comeback and show Rhys the ropes now?"

There was one time I introduced a friend to The Wolf Among Us on my XB1, and in the first fight scene with the huntsman had a frickin.. lamp was hovering in the middle of the room the whole time. Kinda awesome, but disappointing."
Borderlands,3b4xaq,Pluwo4,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"I had the same issues on the 360.  The off lip syncing and stutters during the ""combat"" scenes killed me....literally a couple times.  There is also a bug or two that won't allow you to complete certain parts of episode 2 when you have episode 3 installed.  So the only workaround given was to uninstall 3 in order to play 2 and then reinstall 3 when done."

Borderlands,3b4xy9,Dahorah,2,Fri Jun 26 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"I made my build into exploding Jacks, so I had quite a lot of fun. Run around the room stacking buffs while your Jacks explode with Shock, Fire, or pure Explosions. On top of that I just threw grenades everywhere with that perk that gave free ones after 4 kills."
Borderlands,3b4xy9,farfr0mepic,2,Fri Jun 26 02:43:37 2015 UTC,"My Jack is level 36, and I think he's the most fun one I've played so far (played all but Nisha and Wilhelm). I liked how he's really good on offense, yet isn't squishy at all. You're going down the same tree I did, and if you're not finding it as fun, I don't really think I can give advice on fun builds. Play around with the other trees, and if he still isn't fun, probably best to switch to another character. Borderlands with a class you don't like is never fun."
Borderlands,3b4xy9,OkemosBrony,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:37:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was expecting more, but the capstone for the left tree makes it so you can spawn a badass digijack which is way strong. I forget which perk it is, but there is one that can make you have up to a 90% chance to not consume ammo per shot, so paired with a luck cannon, or a jakobs quad you can put out a ridiculous amount of damage"

Plus the ending skill ""Sponsored by"" gives some neat buffs to your fighting."
Borderlands,3b4xy9,TomBomb-omb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:22:20 2015 UTC,"I find Jack pretty fun to play as. I much use this build, it has great survivability and amazing damage output (I took down EOS's last phase in somewhere between 5-10 seconds). The only thing I changed is that I use a Flayer instead of a Quad because it's better than a Quad at pretty much everything."
Borderlands,3b4xy9,Xyanite,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:50:07 2015 UTC,I started with left skill tree to get digjacks to carry me for a while. Once i got enough skill points i respeced into middle then right skill trees. Digijacks deaths counting as kills is so good. It basically guarantees secound wins. And with the kills lengthening your action skill it can last an entire fire fight. But the skillfull player will end it early to keep the cooldown almost instant.

Borderlands,3b30y7,smit4465,11,Thu Jun 25 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"I imagine because it would be extremely annoying when you play with teammates that would like their shield to remain down.  You could picture the frustration of someone with a Maylay shield or Flame of the Firehawk trying to play their style while a teammate is littering boosters all over the place. It's the same reason why you never take Buck Up as Mechromancer when you play co-op. Why Gearbox allowed one but not the other? Who knows.  Sure it would be nice otherwise, though."
Borderlands,3b30y7,Zaaptastic,9,Thu Jun 25 17:41:09 2015 UTC,Make it an option you can toggle on/off?
Borderlands,3b30y7,newsedition,4,Thu Jun 25 19:36:05 2015 UTC,Or make it so it's only auto-pickup if you're using a booster shield. Not wearing a booster? Manually pick up boosts.
Borderlands,3b30y7,Rick-Sanchez,4,Fri Jun 26 10:09:10 2015 UTC,I feel like this is something they could easily patch in now.  It would definitely make boosters way more useful.
Borderlands,3b30y7,tazercow,3,Thu Jun 25 16:18:21 2015 UTC,"I think it was designed that way. You have to be aware of the shield dropping, instead of being able to just walk forward picking up without any effort on your part. It adds a layer into the battle should you choose to use this kind of shield."
Borderlands,3b30y7,TheJediCounsel,3,Thu Jun 25 20:05:43 2015 UTC,It would save me a load of Whiskey Tango Foxtrot deaths.
Borderlands,3b30y7,DigbyMayor,2,Fri Jun 26 01:22:43 2015 UTC,They're not really that bad. Spam E (or whatever your pickup button is) as soon as you hear the sound. As long as you're not moving forward you'll pick it up.

Borderlands,3b30y7,JavelinTF2,0,Thu Jun 25 19:18:36 2015 UTC,"Isn't there a unique booster shield that recharges with money? I'm pretty sure the Pot O Gold makes you drop dollars instead of boosters that you auto pick up to charge the shield. So, I guess you should farm one of those."
Borderlands,3b30y7,MyOtherTagsGood,0,Thu Jun 25 18:22:19 2015 UTC,"I would prefer it to be a 100% boost that you do have to pick up. Having shield boosters that get automatically picked up would suck for co-op players using roid shields, while the 20% shield boost is too small to be of any use during combat. Having the choice to fully restore your shield when needed would be more useful in my opinion.  That said, I still can't see why players don't automatically pick up eridium or moonstones. Seems like a waste of time pressing E over every single piece of it."

He is more than capable of making it to OP8 and doing whatever he wants, but he will generally have a harder time doing it than the other vaulters. I could go deep into each characters playstyles, trees, and formulas if you want. And even though Axton isn't as great as the others, I still prefer him over Sal. Running and looking at people while holding M1 + M2 isn't very fun for me. Which brings up a very important point: the best character isn't the one with the most damage, it's the one that you will have fun playing as."

Borderlands,3b4c6i,Etanu_Zumanovi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:34:36 2015 UTC,Yeah he is really good solo. The only problem is that he is very difficult to use after op level 6. Other than that good. Just get the shield and double turrets and you'll do fine
Borderlands,3b4c6i,HanzsKlopek,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:04:12 2015 UTC,I'm playing Axton solo. I'm level 56 right now and it ain't always a walk in the park. I had to change my playstyle when I started UVHM and I am getting used to it. I once stopped playing with Krieg (around level 20) because I didn't have fun to play with him. It's all about being comfortable with your character and being able to adapt and change your build if you have to.

Borderlands,3b4rew,botman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:35:24 2015 UTC,"This has happened within seconds of getting into the game, before the system has warmed up, so to speak, so I don't think that heat is the issue here.  But the fans could be a bit dusty, so I might just tear it open and see what's going on with them.  I'm also using a notebook cooler with fans (a Zalman ZM-NC2000), which helps a lot with system temps.  I've also already turned down the graphics settings from 1600x900 to 720p, and cut the detail settings all the way to the lowest, and that hasn't fixed the issue at all."

Borderlands,3b2emf,fyreNL,2,Thu Jun 25 12:34:02 2015 UTC,You propably visited Rotgut Distillery when you were lvl 39 so the quest automatically scaled to lvl 39. TVHM doesnt scale with your level
Borderlands,3b2emf,fu3ll,2,Thu Jun 25 15:08:38 2015 UTC,Nope. First time ever i visited it. I didn't even own the DLC up till a few days ago during the summer sales.
Borderlands,3b2emf,tinverse,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:50:48 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you're playing on the normal story mode? On normal mode and true vault hunter the levels don't scale to you, they scale up as you get further through the story mode. Once you get to ultimate vault hunter the game scales to you."
Borderlands,3az74o,htran4179,46,Wed Jun 24 18:02:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like the last episode will be the inevitable reveal of borderlands 3. Seeing as they take three + months to even announce the next episodes, it seems it could be plausible."

Borderlands,3az74o,kingeryck,30,Wed Jun 24 19:31:33 2015 UTC,Ah yes the borderlands the pre sequel hate circlejerk.
Borderlands,3az74o,dynastichunter,27,Thu Jun 25 01:01:05 2015 UTC,"why are people hating on it even, bought the game, loved it lots, definitely worth my money."
Borderlands,3az74o,celo753,6,Thu Jun 25 02:01:17 2015 UTC,Short.  It has a fraction of the content of BL2.  Its also of lower quality in almost every way possible.  Still a good game?  Sure.  Just not as good as the first or second one.
Borderlands,3az74o,ophanim,5,Thu Jun 25 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"Its also of lower quality in almost every way possible.   Well, I’m not a big fan of TPS either even though I’ve put 200 hours into it (it’s still Borderlands!), but I don’t think this is true. It had some improvements over BL2: the gear scales A LOT better, double jumps and slams are fun, most of the characters have interesting skill trees. Also the Claptrap DLC is absolutely fantastic.  But yes, even though it’s not as bad as people tend to make it out to be, it’s no match for BL2."
Borderlands,3az74o,AlexS101,3,Thu Jun 25 08:54:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, people just seem to get off on TPS hate.   I agree with everything you said. Also I know this is tied to gear scaling better, but the lack of dependance on slag and weapon swap speed for UVHM makes it A LOT more fun for me. Maybe Cryo is a little OP at the moment, but it's a hell of a lot funner to use than Slag."
Borderlands,3az74o,JamesBrownJihad,2,Thu Jun 25 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I forgot the lack of slag. That’s a HUGE plus for TPS. I currently started a new character in BL2, but I stopped playing once I’ve reached UVHM. Slag is just not fun. Axton and Maya can ignore this, but with other characters you always have to swap weapons and it’s just annoying."
Borderlands,3az74o,AlexS101,2,Thu Jun 25 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"I hated the presequel. I'll explain why, keep in mind it's my opinion and I'm not trying to hate on it. Simply explain why I didn't like it.  In BL2 almost every character felt powerful/interesting. In the presequel I played them all to roughly halfway through the game. (Except claptrap, read further.) Didn't find any of them interesting and I felt like they tried really hard not to make the special moves OP and in doing so made them really boring.  The story wasn't interesting. I have played halfway through the game five times. I have no desire to finish it and I have no idea what happened in it. That's the equivalent of when you watch the first hour and forty minutes of a two hour movie or read the first 250 pages out of a 300 page book and have no desire to find out how it ends. That's just bad.  There is a huge focus on claptrap. He's just part of what makes borderlands the series it is. I get that, and I like claptrap for what he is a part of. But on his own, he's like that annoying kid in your friend group that once the rest of the group leaves you realize just how much you dislike them. He's okay to have here and there. A bit of comic relief. But it feels like he's everywhere in TPS.  Lastly my biggest complaint is probably not one you would expect. The gravity/atmosphere; I really felt like keeping an eye on my oxygen and dealing with gravity slowed down the game and didn't really add anything.  Really not trying to say it was a bad game, but I wasn't a fan."
Borderlands,3az74o,tinverse,3,Thu Jun 25 05:18:56 2015 UTC,"IMO the game was too overhyped. People were expecting too much of it. I see it just as a filler between borderlands 2 and the release of borderlands 3 so we can have something to do, and it's an amazing game at that."
Borderlands,3az74o,celo753,2,Thu Jun 25 10:53:50 2015 UTC,"It's true, I was expecting another borderlands game out of it, but some of the problems listed really shouldn't exist. Others I can see how they do. But overall it just doesn't create the enjoyable time consuming experience that is borderlands."
Borderlands,3az74o,tinverse,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:37:13 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm having about just as much fun as I was during borderlands 2.   The borderlands 2 game was pretty boring by itself too, IMO. The DLCs were the best part, but so far we only have 1 out of 4 dlcs for borderlands tps."
Borderlands,3az74o,celo753,2,Thu Jun 25 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"Doppelganger, Baroness, Holodome, Claptastic together constitute the four Pre-Sequel DLCS.  No more are forthcoming."

Borderlands,3az74o,meteotrio,8,Thu Jun 25 04:31:29 2015 UTC,"I don’t care about that, I just don’t like his style of writing. The jokes are not funny to me, way too often the story and the dialogue felt quite platitudinous and dull. I am enjoying Telltale’s style a lot more, it feels more mature while it still has these typically absurd Borderlands moments. I really hope the writing for BL3 is more influenced by this."

Borderlands,3az74o,IrisRisen,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:14:12 2015 UTC,"Good point. According to their analyst meeting, 2K is invested in the Borderlands business model (even though GTA is 50% of revenue). They want to pop out games every few years with DLC spiffs in between. They also said they were interested in developing new franchises like BL.  So, is Gearbox betting they can make Battleborn the next BL? Maaaaaaaaaaybeeeeeeeee.  In the past they licensed DLC development. Maybe they will do the same with BL3. I imagine the platform hurdles he mentioned last year will not be as severe with the new game engines, so it is at least technically possible if somebody wants to make a go of starting from scratch and not just patching an existing product."

Borderlands,3az74o,finiteglory,4,Wed Jun 24 20:30:15 2015 UTC,That would be a very weird twist ending to TftB.  Not entirely out of possibility.

Borderlands,3az74o,finiteglory,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"What would be the point of controlling two characters at once? Does the non-active character just follow you around as an AI companion, because that would require GBX to code fairly complex AI that can be counted on to be reliable and not cumbersome. Way I see it, it seems more cumbersome than anything."
Borderlands,3az74o,Vect_Machine,2,Thu Jun 25 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"I wasn't thinking of the feasibility of my idea, only the coolness factor involved.   I was thinking the switching involves the digistruct mechanism. Maybe a portable New-U device. So when the special activates, both Fiona and Rhys are active (one played by ai) and the character previously played disappeares by the end of the activation."
Borderlands,3az74o,finiteglory,2,Fri Jun 26 00:13:49 2015 UTC,"I guess that could work, even if it sounds as if it potentially involves a lot of micro-managing (making sure both characters have decent equipment and hoping that Buddy AI is up to snuff and won't get stuck behind walls or something). Thing with Non-turret Pet Classes is that at least the summons are airborne units who can at least fly their way to their enemies like Deathtrap or Wolf while the Digi-Jacks simply teleport when they have to."
Borderlands,3az74o,Vect_Machine,4,Fri Jun 26 07:51:48 2015 UTC,Fiona says she doesn't have any talent besides talking her way out of a fight.   Timothy didn't have any talents until he got a digistruct gadget and Jack's handsomeness.

BUT SLEDGE NO LIKE HOW SLEDGE'S GUN NOT KILL PEOPLE WHO SLEDGE NO LIKE AS FAST.  That being said it's still a very solid shotgun (as well as the closest thing to a post-BL1 Dahl shotgun there is) that tends to get overlooked not only because it's not the amazing superkiller that its BL1 counterpart was, but also because it gets overshadowed by top-tier Jakobs and Torgue shotguns like the Twister and Flakker. In terms of character synergy it probably fits Zero best due to its emphasis on high burst damage, as well as Athena due to its ability to stack Maelstrom quickly. Bandit/Scav grip and Hyperion stock are probably the best parts for it, and in TPS the gun has a fixed bayonet so you don't need to worry about accessories. (edit: can spawn with any accessory in BL2)  Also, I'm not quite sure why it's called Sledge's Shotty in TPS as opposed to Shotgun. Perhaps it's a scav thing?  edit 2: I'm just gonna link MOLMF's video up here as proof that it's actually good"
Borderlands,3aynwn,brandpanz,3,Wed Jun 24 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"THE BURNING LETS YOU KNOW ITS WORKINGGGG  I agree: this is Zer0's weapon.  You're putting 24 slightly-debuffed pellets into the spread of an equivalent 10-pellet Stret Sweeper (though only the first 12 will get Decepti0n bonus).  Subsequent trigger pulls have a 1 second delay, putting them in Room Clener/oberkil! territory.  I wonder how Tw0 Fang/Hell's Comin' affects this weapon's burst mechanic?  Or Funzerker?"
Borderlands,3aynwn,Daemmerung,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:56:35 2015 UTC,The time between bursts is long enough that I could definitely see extra shots helping it. Zerker I'm not sure since it's not really a Claptrap weapon and I therefore don't use it on him.
Borderlands,3aynwn,brandpanz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"It's the recoil management that intrigues me.  Usually Tw0 Fang is a recoil-building beast, but the second shot from Sledge's doesn't suffer from recoil.  Are both Sledge's shots eligible for Tw0 Fang procs?  Would either additional shot suffer from recoil?  Would none of the extra shots suffer from recoil, and then upon concluding the burst the aim reticule would bloom to fill the entire HUD?  Things I'd like to test."
Borderlands,3aynwn,Daemmerung,2,Wed Jun 24 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"Just watched MOLMF's video on it for a bit, it looks like both shots can proc. I'm not that great at detecting recoil but it seems alright."
Borderlands,3aynwn,brandpanz,8,Wed Jun 24 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"They should have kept the same mechanics as the BL1 version: two round mag, knockback, unloads entire clip on trigger pull, Jakobs.  This shotgun is fucking useless in BL2 and not worth anyone's time.  With the BL1 version, you could use certain skills to increase mag size to 5 or 6 making it a super lethal one shot killer.  Or send the really tough ones flying."
Borderlands,3aynwn,L1amas,2,Wed Jun 24 18:07:30 2015 UTC,A solid gun. Pretty bad compared to the borderlands 1 version but it works fine
Borderlands,3aynwn,eshrektpenis,2,Wed Jun 24 16:13:00 2015 UTC,"Enjoy your trip /u/kwprules! I'll look forward to the discussions when you get back.  Now, for the so called ""Sledge's Shotgun:""   Honestly, it's disappointing. The unique effect is not worth the legendary status it carries. This is a fine example of a gun so overshadowed by it's predecessor that it will almost always be spoken of in a negative light. Did this just drop in front of you? Are you needing a new shotgun that's on-level for your character? Do you have plenty of shotgun ammo? If you answered yes to all three of these then you might enjoy it. Otherwise there's almost always a better option for a character. With guns like the Blockhead or even a purple rarity Ravager, I can't think of why you'd specifically use this gun. Bandit Grip, Hyperion Stock, Foregrip Accessory. Blade accessory if you're feeling nostalgic, but it's not the same. It's on the same circuit as the Gub and Gunerang, so if you're intent on getting one of those then you should do it. Seriously though, I can think of at least 6 other shotguns it's more worthwhile to farm."

Borderlands,3ayh4u,Raimsurion,3,Wed Jun 24 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"Phalanx is most effective in combination with the right skill tree (sorry I forgot the name, ceruanic storm or something). Maelstrom and Storm Weaving are the first 2 skills and they are extremely effective. Also Maelstrom only requires 1 skill point. For weapons the best ones are really shotguns and also lasers...I had some good experience with pistols too, but I mostly use shotguns and lasers. I recommend to you: activate your Aspis, throw some tesla grenades on the battlefield and be invincible for every damage that comes right towards you while your elemental damage just keeps rising and rising and you practically melt enemies.  EDIT: To specify the weapon choice a bit: the best shotguns I would say are elemental hyperion shotguns for this build, together with legendary ones. The best laser would be the Thunderfire, since it does electric and fire damage simultaneously, which both stack up Maelstrom. But you can only get it in the Claptrap DLC. The Laser you get from Moxxi after the first half of the story does really well too. On a sidenote: electric damage seems to me like the most effective one, since there are somehow just very little enemies who are seriously resistent to it."
Borderlands,3ayh4u,CriticalFaceTime,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:57:20 2015 UTC,I dont like constantly weapon swapping so I was hoping to go down the middle melee tree. Though I can still pick up Maelstrom if its that effective on its own. I have a lower level Storm Front if shock is the right thing.

Borderlands,3axrmc,raybak,3,Wed Jun 24 14:41:51 2015 UTC,I had the same experience.  I would still suggest to start with 1 and if you can't get into it then move on to 2

Also, Doing the You. Will. Die. Mission with friends is amazing fun, and drops amazing class mods from terramorphous. Hope this helps you out."

Borderlands,3ayyon,HanzsKlopek,2,Wed Jun 24 17:48:41 2015 UTC,I entered TVHM on level 37. I wanted to enger UVHM on level 50 so I mainly focused on the main quest. I also played Torgue and Scarlett Dlcs on TVHM. I finished TVHM at level 50 like I wanted. You could focus on main quest and do dlcs after that if you want to reach level 50 before jumping into UVHM.
Borderlands,3ayyon,HanzsKlopek,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:48:23 2015 UTC,What lvl did you start to farm for stuff like the bee or other legendaries?
Borderlands,3ayyon,Pentaclops4,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:32:46 2015 UTC,I farmed a Bee shiel right before entering UVHM and found a level 48 one from Hunter Hellquist. After that I farmed when I started UVHM. Knuckledragger first obviously (dropped me an Hornet in 22 runs) and after that I rushed the main quest to get to Sanctuary as quick as possible. After that I farmed Savage Lee and got a sweet level 53 Unkempt Harold who never leaves my number 2 slot ;) I also went to farm an other Bee shiel in Tina DLC and found 2 level 53 Bees on my first run ... How is it going for you man ?
Borderlands,3ayyon,tensam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:19:17 2015 UTC,"Bee is only really useful for farming raid bosses, and other bosses, but it really helps on the raids, but I recommend getting to at least 45+ or ultimate vault hunter mode"

Borderlands,3azqrn,TSpades,5,Wed Jun 24 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"Krieg is fairly easy to play solo and is particularly good at mobbing, but struggles against certain airborne bosses such as Bloodwing and the Bunker. You can get around this by doing certain DLCs at certain times (grab a corrosive Pimpernel before the Bunker questline, for example) so it's not too bad.  Endgame Krieg is probably the best mobber out of the six Vault Hunters, and he's quite good at taking out Pete and Vorac if you can reliably chain Bloodsplosions. He has a harder time taking out the other raid bosses, but it's doable."
Borderlands,3azqrn,JebusMcAzn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:33:03 2015 UTC,"Eh, I have quite an easy time killing Terra without dying with only a lvl 50 Veruc, a blue lvl 50 Ravager, and a green lvl 50 Muckamuck. Mainly the Ravager, though. Muckamuck is for taking out laser, fire, and rock tentacles while the Veruc is for Masher tentacles."
Borderlands,3azqrn,origamania,2,Thu Jun 25 01:18:19 2015 UTC,"He is the anti-farm champion. His effectiveness is enhanced by your build, but isn't dependent on it in the late-game like other characters. He is the only character that you could potentially play about 50% of the game with NO equipment at all. Like in this video.  Plus he's bat-shit-crazy-fun"
Borderlands,3azqrn,Foxtrot3100,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:02:34 2015 UTC,"Krieg is kinda hard to start off, but when he gets at higher levels, he can be pseudo-invincible."
Borderlands,3azqrn,origamania,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:22:11 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah. He really makes the game feel different, when compared with the other characters, and feels un-killable at certain points. He redefined melee for me and I found his mobbing bloodsplosion build hilariously fun.  Flying enemies can be a bitch, but if you plan ahead with an appropriate weapon, you're good.

I was annoyed certain skins would give completely random green or blue hair, or random face paint that didn't jive with certain heads.  Heavy weapons classification, that integrates launchers, but also brings flamethrowers, heavy lasers, and weapons improvised from mining equipment.  Better vehicle physics. It was awful to hit some imperceptible vector, have your front end pop up in the air, and spin 180 degrees. And while we're at it, better integration of vehicle combat. In the main campaign of BL2, there were only a handful of driveable areas, and there was really only vehicle combat in the Dust. The other areas, you could just bump the critters and riddle them with bullets while they recover from rag doll.  Less ridiculous enemy movement and pathfinding. I remember Pitchford talking about how enemies would hurdle obstacles, which they do, and climb up and over walls to get to you, which they don't. They just kind of do a slow moon jump from level to level. And fix the god damned erratic flight patterns for flying enemies. Most flying types would go tarded if they came into contact with a surface, and I don't even know what the deal was with dragons.  More bosses that aren't just reskinned, resized mobs."

Borderlands,3athjs,RichieAppel,4,Tue Jun 23 14:53:44 2015 UTC,I'm wondering when they will reveal that a velicoraptor was about the size of a turkey.
Borderlands,3athjs,ChaosOpen,16,Tue Jun 23 14:02:26 2015 UTC,They admit (Spielberg and Crichton) that the raptors are based more off deinonychus which is literally the same thing just the size in the movie.  They chose Velociraptor since the name worked better if I remember right.  It fit with some of the parts in the book that mentioned raptors and the word in a different language so Spielberg kept it.  Sorry  not trying to be a know it all on JP stuff.  Just letting you know they definitely acknowledge the error.

Borderlands,3avtsc,Musely,10,Wed Jun 24 15:58:11 2015 UTC,Did this episode make anyone else start to think that maybe Fiona will be one of the vault hunters in BL3?
Borderlands,3avtsc,Sturberman,13,Wed Jun 24 00:52:01 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Perhaps Fiona and Rhys, but definitely Fiona at least. Her special power could be changing elemental effects without having to switch out to a totally different gun."

Borderlands,3avtsc,Vect_Machine,2,Wed Jun 24 01:10:11 2015 UTC,"Prediction seems a little intensive, game-play wise. Maybe just slowing down time."
Borderlands,3avtsc,IFE-Antler-Boy,6,Wed Jun 24 01:35:57 2015 UTC,Bullet time is kind of hard to implement in a multiplayer-focused game since you have to account for all the other players. You can't simply have it work for a single player.
Borderlands,3avtsc,Vect_Machine,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:36:40 2015 UTC,"Max Payne 3 did it. Through some weird voodoo magick, they did it."
Borderlands,3avtsc,tuxisme,2,Wed Jun 24 07:52:45 2015 UTC,"Well, that game's multiplayer is specifically PvP and thus designed to work more based on that. Borderlands Multiplayer is primarily PvE and thus would have to work on different rules (that and presumably they have different tech). And if I recall, the Bullet Time in that game affected a single enemy in your line of sight, which would not work very well in a game where you're constantly fighting swarms of enemies because it just means that you and another dude are moving super-slow while everyone's moving at normal speed.  I'm not saying it's impossible, but aside from a handwave of how your character's bullet time can affect all players (let's say it's a gadget rather than you having Super Awesome Reflexes) there's a lot of technical issues in how to implement since if we could, then it'd be the best possible Skill for a Sniper character (Closest thing we have is Nisha's Showdown)."
Borderlands,3avtsc,bigfudge48,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:34:05 2015 UTC,"If she did have an action skill, I don't know how it would work. I think i would like some kind of weird hybrid between the prediction and her wrist-gun.   Like, a fast recharging action skill that targets one enemy and slows time for her. She draws the wrist gun, a little telltale-style wheel pops up that lets her pick the element, and she fires it for way-increased damage or a guaranteed crit or something. The kinda thing you could pepper into a firefight."
Borderlands,3avtsc,ReverendEarthwormJim,3,Wed Jun 24 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"Rhys could be the pet class, depending if Dumpy plays a part in the rest of the series. Or a melee character with his cyborg arm. Also for Fiona I was thinking kind of a Nisha type slow down, but huge elemental boost. That's just what the choose the outcome thing they had going this episode reminded me of."

Borderlands,3avtsc,Gortyuty,2,Wed Jun 24 02:50:21 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing. I originally thought they wouldn't make the Tales characters Vault Hunters, but it definitely seems like they are setting them up to become Vault Hunters.

Borderlands,3avtsc,Cupcakes_n_Hacksaws,6,Wed Jun 24 02:32:29 2015 UTC,The only problem with that is that you see the same Eridian at the beginning of TPS when you are still on Helios when it protects Colonel Zarpedon.

Borderlands,3avw3s,BostonRockOn,2,Tue Jun 23 23:05:59 2015 UTC,I will say grenades become  much less useful as you level up. Although I still think Magic Missle is good because it slags enemies without having to swap weapons.

Borderlands,3avw3s,ParanoidDrone,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:15:23 2015 UTC,"There are different types of grenade mods that spice it up a fair bit. They can be standard lobbed grenades, longbow (teleport in a straight line down your crosshair), bouncy (exactly what it sounds like), or sticky (clings to the first thing it touches). Once it explodes, it can be a standard blast, a DOT in an area around it, create a singularity effect to draw enemies in, or it can be a MIRV and throw out a bunch of child grenades. All of these explosions can come in various elemental flavors too. And that's not even touching on the insanity some legendary grenade mods can bring.  They scale about as well as any other piece of loot in the game, which is to say not terribly well in UVHM onward but they're still decent burst damage. And once your level stabilizes they pick right back up again. My personal favorite grenade mod (that I actually have) is a 0.0 fuse longbow Storm Front. To put that in perspective, it's a teleporting grenade that instantly starts doing shock DOT in a large AOE, while spitting out a circle of child grenades that ALSO do shock DOT to anything nearby. The whole thing lasts for about 5 seconds, then they all blow up for one last burst of shock damage."

Plus her middle tree gives her tons of sustain, so you're practically unkillable.

Borderlands,3avbwg,_darkwingduck_,3,Tue Jun 23 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"You can use the unique sniper rifle 'trespasser' gained through the animal rights mission mordecai gives you, to knock off his helmet before his shield is down, allowing you to score crits on him which makes it drop quicker.   Although I've been trying to use my lv72 trespasser on him in OP8 and his helmet refuses to come off... so if you already have it low level it may not work. Can anyone clarify?"
Borderlands,3avbwg,SnapCrack1ePop,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:21:41 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you have to do enough damage with it for it to knock his helmet off. Usually Money Shot with Sal with do the trick on OP8
Borderlands,3avbwg,_darkwingduck_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I assumed it was damage based, though even using an OP3 bee with +6 money shot on my 72 trespasser didn't knock it off."

Borderlands,3ati81,cdghuntermco,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:54:36 2015 UTC,At any point are the mods going to post like a stickied Episode 3 Discussion Thread? Or should I just go ahead and make my own post post about wanting to discuss the new episode (with proper spoiler warnings)?
Borderlands,3ati81,jiandersonzer0,2,Thu Jun 25 17:19:25 2015 UTC,We don't sticky discussion threads.  Just announcements.  Go for it!

Borderlands,3avpkq,CriticalFaceTime,7,Tue Jun 23 21:50:36 2015 UTC,"While I haven't played ep.3 yet of Tales (though it has been spoiled for me thanks to FB), you have to keep one thing in mind.  We were never dealing with heroes and villains in this world.  We were given people who were out for treasure.  Sure, in the context of how Jack was presented and our affiliation with the original 4, Jack was ""their"" villain which in turn made us feel that they were heroes.  Ultimately, these are just people who are trying to survive and constantly adapting to what is happening around them.  Can we agree that Lilith is starting to get super irrational since she started her eridium addiction?  Yeah, definitely.  However, she was never a leader which is why Roland was.  To me, we are just seeing how war and greed bring out the true colors in people."
Borderlands,3avpkq,Sparrow626,3,Tue Jun 23 23:37:13 2015 UTC,"oh man at first I thought I had somehow spoiled it for you, that would've made me feel really bad haha. Well, I know that they are not heroes per se. But Lilith is really a terrible leader. I also think that at the end of Episode 3 Brick and Mordecai are really losing sympathy, since they are constituted like average stupid bounty hunters.  EDIT: Someone just told me that Episode 3 plays BEFORE the opening cutscene of the Pre Sequel. If this is true, then I take everything back! (Except for the part with Lilith, she's a dick and I hope something bad happens to her in Borderlands 3)"
Borderlands,3avpkq,Sparrow626,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:47:45 2015 UTC,"I agree about Lilith.  There was a theory on twitter not too long ago stating that Lil is on the same path Jack was (seeing herself as greater than she is and so on).  That will be interesting to see if the parts of ep.3 take place before the pre sequel, though it would seem odd given how it all has taken place after 2 so far.  I guess I will see in a few hours when I get home."
Borderlands,3avpkq,Sparrow626,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:56:09 2015 UTC,"Alright, so although I would like to discuss this further, I think you should really play Episode 3 on your own first (it's really good!)"
Borderlands,3avpkq,Sparrow626,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:59:34 2015 UTC,"So, having completed the episode last night, they finally introduced where in the Borderlands series this game takes place.  Based on Mord and Brick being furious with Athena and taking her to Lilith, this all happens right before the cutscenes in TPS with the gang.  So while I agree that we are seeing a more thuggish side to the two, it makes sense in context of timeline.  edit - Fixing the spoiler tag"

Borderlands,3avpkq,Sayie,2,Tue Jun 23 22:22:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah basically they are gunlusting killers with a desire for great loot. But in my opinion they would be more likeable if you know that they are...kinda good, you know?"
Borderlands,3avpkq,Cardinal_Sizzle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:26:03 2015 UTC,"none of you like   but...why? None of them were particularly enthused with Atlas, and Athena was perfectly nice in the Knoxx DLC. Why are the VHs suddenly super hostile with her? what did she do to suddenly earn their ire?"
Borderlands,3avpkq,SadSniper,3,Tue Jun 23 23:52:16 2015 UTC,"Because she went from being a friend to conspiring with a guy that would have literally destroyed Pandora. She was teamed with people like Nisha who just has a bloodlust and no care for people, and Jack who seems to want to hurt people just for the sake of it feeling good. She was also teamed with Wilhelm, who is literally becoming a robot and killed people close to them, and tried to kill the second pack of Vault Hunters."
Borderlands,3avpkq,TSpades,3,Wed Jun 24 00:37:03 2015 UTC,"it's not like she knew who she'd be working with, let alone what Jack would become.  in fact, considering the fact that this happened before the intro/outro of TPS, they don't know that she worked with those people. Maybe Jack, but even then I'm not entirely sure they'd know that.  to know that she worked with jack and all them they'd need to hear it from a person form Elpis, and 99% of the people there would think of all of them as heroes, at least formerly.  I'm not getting why they took this massive nosedive on their opinion of Athena. Really not deserved."
Borderlands,3avpkq,Chessolin,2,Wed Jun 24 03:09:17 2015 UTC,"Of course she didn't know what jack would become, but because she is associated with him that she has a negative rep with it, especially with the direct enemies of Handsome Jack.  Like for example, if someone joined the german army before Hitler took over, he couldn't have known that hitler would take over but hes a Nazi now, and when he finds enemies of the Nazi's they still see him as a Nazi."
Borderlands,3avpkq,Chessolin,2,Wed Jun 24 03:16:04 2015 UTC,"Both Lilith and Roland were there and they tried to sabotage Jack (and his Vault Hunters by proxy) because they saw him as threat to everyone. Naturally when they returned to Brick and Mordecai and told the story, it was with a negative bias towards Jack, Athena, and the other hunters. They hunted her down to interrogate her and saw her as a known accomplice of Handsome Jack, and treated her as such. They did change tunes, as seen at the ending scene of the pre-sequel."
Borderlands,3avpkq,idkmybffyossarian,2,Wed Jun 24 05:10:16 2015 UTC,"They're not your heroes. They're just people that aren't so bad who are both looking for vaults and powerful. They've got bills to pay, they've got mouths to feed."

Borderlands,3au0lc,buttsalt14,4,Tue Jun 23 14:31:57 2015 UTC,"You don't get tired because each character has a pretty unique play style. With Gaige, you normally rely on building up anarchy stacks and relying on close enough to spam high fire rate guns to shoot bullets everywhere. With something like Melee Krieg, you faceroll everyone and just spam the melee button on mobs and something like Salvador you dual wield a moxxi gun and a DPUH to get through mobs.   The point is, it's easy to see why it would be tiring, but considering that you would be playing the game in an entirely different way for each character, you hardly get tired. Also, on UVHM, where everything is invincible, I at least found fun in the innovative ways that each character had to sustain (e.g. Hellborn Krieg DOT regen, Salvador moxxi dual wield, Gaige blood soaked shields, etc.)."
Borderlands,3au0lc,TheBlackOyster,4,Tue Jun 23 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"I frequently tweak my character's build, changing the character's playstyle as I go.  This can happen when I find a new piece of promising loot (classmod, gun, relic, whatever), or when I enter a map with some new challenges (invisbl asshols, burrowing fireproof stinkers, whatever), or just when I level up and get a new skillpoint.  Keeps it fresh.  Players who adhere to a single minmaxed build (here is my DPUH and here is my Bee! there are many just like them but these are for me!) are denying themselves much of the pleasure of this game."

Borderlands,3au0lc,Semigloss01010001,2,Tue Jun 23 15:40:42 2015 UTC,Imo the game doesn't get fun until uvhm when you start getting some awesome synergy between trees. Plus all the characters playstyles are so different I get to use different guns and abilities on each so it's fresh every time. Starting a new one on the journey to 72 now and it's just as fun as the first!
Borderlands,3au0lc,45sfCA,2,Tue Jun 23 16:08:45 2015 UTC,When you get tired of the story head over to multiplayer and play someone else's game. They may be doing the story or some dlc. If it is dlc you can check out new areas and learn new tricks. If it is the story you can complete a chapter out of order and your game will later let you skip that chapter.

Borderlands,3aqaau,Pesterlamps,4,Mon Jun 22 19:14:00 2015 UTC,I actually like the fact that the whole gun is kinda beat up and crude. So personally doing the hand painted logo works for it I think.

Borderlands,3aqaau,JoeKGBX,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:18:43 2015 UTC,I've done the white stripe as the space between the gun and the black slider on the top-back edge. It creates that angled swoosh to mimic the white Hyperion stripe.
Borderlands,3aqaau,JoeKGBX,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:35:38 2015 UTC,Nice! How did you pull off that scratched paint look?
Borderlands,3aqaau,Bagelmaster42,3,Mon Jun 22 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Requires a bit of pre-planning (and time) in how you do your paint layers. It's several layers of spray paint that I let fully cure (24 hours for these particular paints) before applying the next color on top. So I had my primer coat > metallic black base coat > ton of different metallic silver coats (3) > yellow coat -- letting each one sit overnight 24 hours. Once I got the final coat cured, I used metal brushes and metal wax sculpting tools and stuff to pick away at the layers to reveal what was hiding underneath ^ _ ^ . Allowing it to fully cure and not just the 'handle after 1 hour' you see on cans creates that hard durable shell, which you can then pick away at without hurting the layers underneath and controlling how much you pick off."

I might have gone a point above or below, I'm a bit tired.  So, how it would work. You go to some enemies, hit them in the face and get hit in the face till your firehawk breaks. Now, that would be good as basic Krieg, but here we are Über-Krieg. Not only is our health going back up thanks to Brawn, but since we are grogging/rubi'ing as well, we are getting even more heals. Hellborn coupled with the firehawk is already broken as hell, and gives us more health by just running around enemies, wich we can catch up to thanks to ""Incite"". Not to mention we also have huge damage reductions without having to go into Mania thanks to both Brick's and Salvador's skills, enhancing our already powerfull ""Numbed Nerves"".  And when shit starts to get real? Gunzerk! Double the healing with two grogs/rubis. You don't even need to shoot unless you are fighting Flint/Fire phase Terra/dragon/whatever that for some reason refuses to burn properly. Not counting Pete since he's better at setting you on fire and you want that anyways.  EDIT: AAAAAND for some reason BL2's trees don't copy the tree changes.

Fire rate from the hip is stupid fast so your clips empty pretty quickly despite the mag size buffs.  Which means more Anarchy.  Which means more damage.

Borderlands,3ara4m,Bluur04,4,Mon Jun 22 21:47:49 2015 UTC,"My favorites are wilhelm and jack.   Wilhelm is really tanky, so most of the time I just like to run up to stuff and punch it in the face, followed by a blast by my shotgun. I like to always take an ice laser because I can freeze enemies while sprinting up to them before I punch them. I also love that shoulder cannon  Jack is great at dealing a ton of damage. Compound interest makes him attack something, wait 5 seconds, and then deal a ton of damage. His digi jacks can either be monsters, or squishy allys to sacrifice to give yourself bonuses. Also money is power for up to 250% extra damage!"
Borderlands,3ara4m,danjo3197,3,Mon Jun 22 23:36:01 2015 UTC,"If you are just looking for fun then claptrap is definitely the best. But in terms of soloing Nisha or Athena are probably the best. If you are looking for more elemental power then Athena should probably be your choice while Nisha should be your choice if you just want to shoot stuff and not worry allot about life.  I didn´t buy the holodome as its a horrible piece of shit cashgrab with no content, as for the Claptastic Voyage I did it at level 30 but thats maybe a bit early as the final boss in that campaign is at raid boss level and should be done with friends or with ridiculously high level gear. Id say around level 40 or so should be a nice start to the Claptastic Voyage if you don´t want to grind till level 50 +."
Borderlands,3ara4m,Drumbas,4,Tue Jun 23 02:42:24 2015 UTC,"I've played all 4 of the vault hunters that aren't DLC.  Out of them I'd say play whoever you want they're all fine solo but maybe save Nisha for last if plan on playing all of them she is OP as fuck.  I'll give a brief break down of them:  1) Claptrap has some of the funniest dialogue in the game and you honestly can make him whatever you want.  Hard to kill he's got that, ridiculous damage but inconsistent yup, and really decent consistent damage he's got that too.  2) Wilhem has the second funniest dialogue and really only 2 options for him.  He's got really hard to kill and and quarterback of death machines but he himself really can't deal the damage the rest of them can. 3) Athena's dialogue well is basically the game and she is the funnest to play while IMO being meh in everything.  When her shields up and facing the enemy she's a tank but once that goes down you have to be a little wary with her.   You can boost her shield capabilities to make her even better during that time, boost elementals and thus damage(If you pick her seriously at least put 1 point in Maelstrom), or have a decent melee path.  She is kinda boring to play up until you get the capstone in her melee tree and I'm not a melee kind of player and honestly think most of her melee skills kinda suck.  Suddenly you realize you are playing as a superhero.  4) Nisha has some pretty funny dialogue and as I said she is OP as fuck.  She has damage and decently hard to kill, then 2 handed damage plus a little more hard to kill, and stupid amounts of damage.  Did I mention she does damage?  As far as the DLCs I believe the first Holodome mission is at 25 by the fifth it's 30 and caps there.  The Claptrap DLC I believe starts at 30 and I think you beat it at 40 it could scale though.  Then TVHM the regular game starts at 30, Holdome first mission is 46 then fifth is 50, and I'm honestly not sure for The Claptrap DLC it might scale to when you start it.  Then UVHM always scales.  If anyone wants to give a good description of jack and Aurelia please do, I plan on playing them next."
Borderlands,3ara4m,shamus4mwcrew,4,Mon Jun 22 22:45:00 2015 UTC,"I have played Athena, Wilhelm and Jack.  I can say that Jack will be the strongest lategame class with his massive survivability and quite harsh nukes.  Wilhelm comes in second for me, he has a lot of damage, and plays nice, but he can be in quite some trouble when downed; especially when solo playing.  By the way; the Holodome just sucks. It isn't really fun, the higher levels are quite hard and just unrewarding, it are just regular mobs and some old weakened bosses - nothing new.  The Claptastic Voyage is AWESOME, better than the base game if you'd ask me. But comparing to to Borderlands 2, the game still feels small. Too bad there will be no more expansions."

Borderlands,3aqbx7,brandpanz,5,Mon Jun 22 18:08:05 2015 UTC,"Due to the prevalence of throw builds for some solo raids, this is a pretty popular weapon that has some great potential. In addition, the homing capabilities make it a little easier to hit enemies. It's also (in my opinion) the best way to get that annoying ""Kill a Flying Enemy with a Tediore Reload"" challenge. Axton's throw builds for raids like having this gun. It doesn't really make top gear for any other characters that I can think of, but Krieg is probably able to make this pretty damaging thanks to blood filled guns. Bandit Grip improves capacity, and when throwing that means more damage so it's probably the best choice. Jam Packed is the prefix of choice for more mag capacity and more throw damage. Sight really doesn't matter, but pretty much everyone says Maliwan is the best.  I hate the Fridge. Rats suck, Crystalisks are a total pain, and Rakk always seem to attack you at the most inconvenient moments. But if you're running to get a Gub and a Sledge's Shotgun anyway, Rakkman is pretty close so you might as well kill him. Since I feel you need it for the one achievement, you should try to get it at least once."
Borderlands,3aqbx7,meh_mediocre,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:35:27 2015 UTC,"The thing about the Bandit Grip is that even though it does increase magazine size, having a matching grip will increase magazine size AND reload speed, so I'd say that a Tediore grip would be best overall"
Borderlands,3aqbx7,_sLAUGHTER234,2,Mon Jun 22 21:49:53 2015 UTC,"Bandit grip confers more magazine size bonus than the Tediore grip's synergy bonus, and doesn't diminish gun damage the way that a Tediore grip does, either.  And the Gunarang's base reload speed means that even slowed by a Bandit grip, the weapon reloads extremely quickly.  Bandit may reload in 150% the time of the Tediore, but that's 150% of a tiny number.  For damage inflicted per-bullet and per-chuck, the Bandit grip is superior.  In a raid situation where you're trying to chuck 20 times before the nova fires again, or your FFYL timer expires -- that I haven't tried to measure.  Tediore might have the edge there."

Borderlands,3arssm,Iridium777,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"Looking at the skill trees, here's how I'd build Hellborn Krieg:  http://bl2skills.com/psycho.html#55500500055101500000000055555005000  Make sure to be using Flame of the Firehawk.  Legendary Reaper or Torch class mod."
Borderlands,3arssm,ScootaLewis,2,Tue Jun 23 01:01:48 2015 UTC,"I sense that you don't play Hellborn builds.  Pull the Pin on a level-maxed character?  No Elemental Empathy or Delusional Damage or Raving Retribution?  Taste of Blood on a build with no BAR buffs?  Flame of the Firehawk makes Hellborn builds into juggernauts, but without Elemental Empathy you're going to be married to your Moxxi weapon.  In any case, it's hardly mandatory.  Any Adaptive shield stacks well with the health buff of Feed the Meat (which will let you survive longer while aflame when you don't have nearby meatflesh for healing).  If you're running Flame of the Firehawk, Embrace the Pain is natural.  From there it's easy to pick up a single point of Thrill of the Kill.  5/5 Flame Flare is overkill if you're running a classmod that overloads that skill.  This is a 72 build that serves Legendary Torch well.  Reverse the two tier-1 Hellborn skills if you like.  I stack this with a regular Fire Elemental Relic - no Bone of the Ancients, as I never rampage this character.  In less mobby situations such as the late OP tiers of Digistruct Peak, consider backing out of the Bloodlust capstones and picking up Fire Fiend instead.  You need weak mobs to kill for Nervous Blood and Bloodsplosion to shine, and you don't always have that luxury.  Conversely, in situations where you can't ignite yourself, you want more Bloodlust and less Hellborn.  Sometimes in fire resistant zones I'll finesse the first tier of Bloodlust in order to get the (usually underwhelming) Bloody Revival skill.  That and a quality Torgue AR will help in FFYL against a Burning Spiderant.  A final warning about Hellborn: he chews through a lot of ammo.  10/5 Elemental Elation and 10/5 Embrace the Pain will almost triple your rate of fire when fully engaged.  Blood of the Ancients isn't a bad alternate relic to run, especially in fire-resistant areas.  In those zones I may change classmod to Legendary Psycho as well."

Borderlands,3arssm,ScootaLewis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:44:28 2015 UTC,"I usually avoid ""Give me a build"" threads when the OP offers as little information up front as this.  Are they 30, 50, 72, OP?  Were they looking for Hellborn and Bloodlust, or Hellborn or Bloodlust?  In the end, easiest just to let them find forums.gearboxsoftware.com by themselves.  If we had a little more context, more fruitful discussion would be possible."

Borderlands,3aqbff,_darkwingduck_,2,Wed Jun 24 06:40:07 2015 UTC,"Either do them in UVHM when they scale to your level, or do one when you're underleveled for the main story in the other modes."
Borderlands,3aqbff,Vargkungen,4,Tue Jun 23 00:18:31 2015 UTC,"For some reason, this is an issue they've never addressed. It was the same in Borderlands 1; you inevitably became overleveled for the content you were facing, whether you did the DLC:s during the main quest, or after it.  You'd think that the easy fix would be to increase the effective level width of each DLC and make it clear that they're meant to be played in a certain order, but that's apparently a completely outlandish idea or something."
Borderlands,3aqbff,origamania,2,Mon Jun 22 17:39:35 2015 UTC,Right? I checked the wiki and all of the DLCs said level 30-35 I believe

Note the difference in the beginning of 1 and 2, in that he needed them off the bus to go find the vault for him.  In the opening of 2, he's trying to murder them.

Borderlands,3apqpo,neogreenlantern,3,Mon Jun 22 16:16:21 2015 UTC,I think part of it wasn't that he wasn't necessarily trying to manipulate the Vault Hunters in the first game but keep his plan secret from Hyperion. The higher ups didn't really take him seriously but he knew that Pandora had a vault and that Atlas was on the trail to it so he had to basically go off the books to get at it.

He had already enslaved Angel and was aware of the power that the vaults held. In the echo logs from 2 we hear that he uses his ""instruments at home"" to instruct Hyperion higherups where the vault is. This is before Helios was even built - and much before TPS and BL2. His instruments at home are actually his daughter in a chair.  TPS is under the umbrella of unreliable narrator. Remember when Janey says ""stories don't have to be true to be believed, they just need to be told"" and you kind of went ""huh"" and went along with your life?  She was talking about Jack and what he was doing - namely, pretending to be a good guy. He's good at pretending, though, which is where the ""plot holes"" happen.  I hope that helps :)"

Borderlands,3an0pi,Major_Winkee,4,Sun Jun 21 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"I can run Metro Last Light on a 2-3 year old $400 HP laptop, so anything more recent that's not a chromebook probably stands a decent chance. I have a 2.2ghz dual core processor, and an integrated gpu so if I can you probably can.  DayZ as in standalone, or DayZ as in the Arma 2 mod? Because I can't speak for standalone because I haven't tried (It is early access, so my guess is no.), but Arma 2's Dayz does not run very well on my PC. I can run it well enough to run around and collect shit, but zombies are really hard to kill and players I stand no chance against.

Borderlands,3an0pi,A_Bhuddie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:15:56 2015 UTC,"A couple of things come to mine.  First, most tweak guides online are oriented towards increasing the quality of graphics and not the other way around. Plenty of the parameters on ini files are very much not documented and require a lot of experimentation to figure out.   Also, for many games there is A LOT of bullshit out there. Stuff that plenty of forums posts will swore by as working tweaks that will do nothing.  So there is also the added benefit of being able to see the effect of every tip.  It may sound simple, but it is a lot of work. Videos like the Witcher 3 can take several days of dedicated experimentation just to figure out."

Borderlands,3ap8ur,Holyrapid,3,Mon Jun 22 11:38:07 2015 UTC,The main thing it spoils is actually the other DLC - It's meant to be played after Ned's and Knoxx.
Borderlands,3ap8ur,Laskeri,3,Mon Jun 22 12:52:06 2015 UTC,One of the things I like to do is save the dlc and side quest for support? Do the storyline and if you hit a spot of chronic failure do some of the side stuff for a level up and possibly some great upgrades to progress in the story.
Borderlands,3ap8ur,45sfCA,2,Mon Jun 22 12:52:52 2015 UTC,"Well... killing that guy actually spoiled you things from 3rd DLC. You should complete the main story, at least, before doing any other dlc. The order I'd suggest you doing them is 2 3 1 4. The second dlc doesn't give you exp, but awards you with a skill point if you complete the mission there."
Borderlands,3ap8ur,596Franky,2,Mon Jun 22 15:40:59 2015 UTC,that was the only DLC I didn't finish on the first game (mainly because I tried doing it while over-leveled and it was just boring)

Borderlands,3aot0b,blindoldeman,2,Mon Jun 22 07:35:08 2015 UTC,Elemental effect change would go from 10% to 11% this is with all elemental effect boosts (even in the skill trees). I think with -100% shield recharge delay the delay would be halved and at -200% it would be a quarter and so on. Gun damage I'm not sure but I think you're right.
Borderlands,3anfah,cscottaxp,14,Sun Jun 21 22:55:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, Hammerlocks dlc is kind of known for it and as such is seen as the worst dlc in alot fans's eyes, and eventually when you reach UVHM you'll notice how everything becomes a bullet sponge and extremely tedious."
Borderlands,3anfah,RoadRunnerdn,2,Sun Jun 21 23:47:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's hard to justify running some of it unless there's a gun that you really, REALLY want.  Fortunately some of the better gear is available without having to go too far into the campaign. Rough Rider is available after the second story mission (which is still a pain), and the Twister becomes a little easier to farm around the same time."
Borderlands,3anfah,meh_mediocre,2,Mon Jun 22 14:17:29 2015 UTC,The first time I went into the dlc I was a level 50 with almost perfect gear so I didn't find it that bad.  Farming is still a huge pain in the ass and he'll have to complete the story to fight Voracidious to get a chance at the Interfacer which is one of the best if not the best shotgun in the game.
Borderlands,3anfah,RoadRunnerdn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"I always forget about the Interfacer!  The thing is, shotguns are so flush with powerful options already that you can almost make a case to use other, more easily attainable options."
Borderlands,3anfah,meh_mediocre,3,Mon Jun 22 16:01:58 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah.  On the other hand, the main storyline for the DLC is pretty damn short."
Borderlands,3anfah,AnatoleSerial,4,Mon Jun 22 03:00:35 2015 UTC,"If it weren't for them, there would be little point to the DLC.  They are a challenge.  You will rise to the challenge.  There are sources of splash-type damage other than rocket launchers that will kill shielded savages more economically."
Borderlands,3anfah,Daemmerung,8,Sun Jun 21 23:54:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think a challenge has to completely come from an enemy being a total bullet sponge.   Is an enemy challenging when it has a good chunk of health? Yes. But when all of the challenge from an enemy is not of hitting a weakspot, dodging a certain attack pattern, using it's weapon weakness, etc. but from it having way too much health? It turns into a battle of attrition which, after a while, can get a bit boring."
Borderlands,3anfah,McRibbles,3,Mon Jun 22 01:11:14 2015 UTC,"Savages aren't particularly spongy.  They do have that shield, which must be managed."
Borderlands,3anfah,Daemmerung,4,Mon Jun 22 01:16:33 2015 UTC,"The witch doctors are pretty spongey.  They, in my eyes, are the worst offenders. And it's almost impossible to hit their critical spot. Not that it would matter because they just regeneration health anyway. They're just a lot of effort. I think even if they just couldn't revenue health or I could actually hit their critical spot a reasonable amount of the time, it would be significantly less painful."
Borderlands,3anfah,Daemmerung,7,Mon Jun 22 01:34:09 2015 UTC,AoE grenades are your friend.  Most of the WDs burn nicely.
Borderlands,3anfah,cannons_for_days,2,Mon Jun 22 01:35:05 2015 UTC,"Witch Doctors are hell-on-Pandora for Maya because they break her mez.  Axton, Gaige, Krieg, and Sal were all mostly fine with the savages.  Grenades make short work of the ones with shields, and all the rest go down pretty quickly.  Leave the Witch Doctors for last - they don't deal that much damage on their own and they're significantly harder to kill than the savages.  If you're having trouble killing the savages before the witch docs level everything up, your problem is likely your gear - above level 30, gear/level scaling becomes much steeper and gear won't last more than a few levels.  Take a closer look at the green gear you're picking up and make sure it's not actually an upgrade to what you have right now before you sell it - a level 44 green gun is often better than a level 42 blue gun.  If you've been cruising on level 40 purple gear, there's an even better chance that you've got upgrades dropping for you."
Borderlands,3anfah,WreckerCrew,2,Mon Jun 22 04:22:21 2015 UTC,"That's good advice, thank you.  I always check every item for upgrades, but I didn't realize it became so much steeper at this level. Maybe I'll just grind the main game for some upgrades and see what I can find."
Borderlands,3anfah,WreckerCrew,3,Mon Jun 22 10:59:58 2015 UTC,Go find yourself a good Dual Shot Unkempt Harold from the vending machines in Campaign of Carnage.  I've found there aren't a lot of witchdoctors that can stand toe to toe with you when you pop one of those in their faces.

Borderlands,3ancj7,4got_my_password,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:57:52 2015 UTC,Same on PS4. Nobody seems to play the game.. I find perhaps 1-2 rooms when I make a new character and none with a level 30 one. Those people also only seem to rush through the game like there is no tomorrow and keep all the loot to themselves.. so I haven't bothered with online since. Bit disappointing. It's a far superior game to Destiny but I enjoyed the co-op more in Destiny due to a better loot system and a more patient playerbase.
Borderlands,3ancj7,Claptrap19,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:41:52 2015 UTC,I've read that the matchmaking is broken in the Handsome Collection. I bought the game day one and could rarely find any matches to join. I just assumed nobody bought into the next gen stuff but I've since found tons of people online that have the same problem. I've even had friends start online matches to see if their games pop up in matchmaking and still nothing. I think it's a different problem than people just not playing.

Borderlands,3alyx3,Vargkungen,3,Sun Jun 21 15:05:34 2015 UTC,"Seems like you've hit everything. The CyanB set, Dahl Efficiency set and Gearbox set have never been available through legitimate means which is really annoying seeing as how the total head/skins counters include them so you can't get them all without cheating in some way. There have been so many patches over the years too and this has just never been dealt with.    You've listed the Pre-Order Collector's Edition heads+skins as unobtainable but they are available as a separate DLC (which also includes the other bonus: the Sky Rocket grenade) so shouldn't really be considered any different from the other DLC head/skin packs. http://store.steampowered.com/app/213780/    I'd be interested to see someone tackle the Pre-Sequel heads+skins in the same way, as far as I can tell that situation is in a big mess with a lot more unobtainable stuff. There was some bug a while back that gave some people a bunch of heads/skins at random so now I've totally lost track at what was and was not supposed to be unlocked!"
Borderlands,3alyx3,Xazuki,2,Sun Jun 21 19:05:47 2015 UTC,"Well, sooner or later, I'll hopefully get around to playing the Pre-Sequel, I'm sure, and as I'm a stickler for things like this, I'll research it before I get the game legally. As of right now, I just can't afford it, either way - probably going to be quiet a while, because of that.  And if I can't have the whole game, I don't want the game, which is why I vehemently hate exclusive content or expiration-date content with a vengeance - which is also why I created this list and started this project.  I fully support anyone doing the same for the Pre-Sequel, but if no-one does, I'll see if I can do it, at some point.  As for the Pre-Order Collector's Edition Heads/Skins, yes, you've got a point, but as they are still spawnable metagame content (..I think?), I'll include them in the list.  The strictly-DLC-exclusive-Skins/Heads cannot be acquired at all unless you have the specific Skin/Head DLC(s), which is why including them on the list would be useless. Unfortunately.   Either you shell out €30 for them (because they are never ever on sale) or you're SOL. For me and my GF, that'd be €60. Or you pirate it. But either way, yeah, no."
Borderlands,3alyx3,DefinitelyAWizardBro,3,Sun Jun 21 20:31:34 2015 UTC,"Here is the download with the custom saves: http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=86681845553371929558  There is one save for each character, and you will have to rename them to conform to the standard save format.  Each individual save should contain all available skins for that character in the game, at which point you can simply follow the ""checklist"" to unlock all the skins and heads you are otherwise unable to acquire - including Gearbox, Dahl Efficiency (LEAVE NO MAN UNEATEN for Krieg), and ""CyanB"" (Name differs from class to class; see OP for clarification).  Again, I think the checklist is exhaustive and complete, but I can't guarantee it.  One important note is that once you have loaded the savegame, do not exit/save the game and re-open that save and expect all the skins/heads to still be there. Nothing is broken, and it won't ruin your game or anything - it's still safe to use. It is just that while the supplied saves contain all the available skins/heads, the game will not properly save all of them again, resulting in their erasure in subsequent save/loads.  So load it up once, unlock what you want to unlock, and if you want to go in and unlock more skins/heads, restore the savegame from the download just to make sure it's all still there.  Be wary when unlocking skins and heads, in case you don't want to cheat (like me). For example, it is easy to mix up Maya's ""Pretty and Pink"" skin with the ""Pretty in Punk"" head - and there is unfortunately no way to remove skins/heads once they're unlocked.  So in my case I had to delete my profile and start anew.  Such is life in the Borderlands."

Borderlands,3am254,Saedeas,2,Sun Jun 21 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"•(1) As others said, try the golden chest. Though you said you've burned through 20 keys, you might still get something (but it might just wind up being wasted. Everytime I look for a specific weapon type, I never get it.)      •(2) As others have said, try Scarlett's DLC. However, if you go there now, you won't be able to get a higher level later, so I guess look and see where you think it would serve the best use.        •(3) I found myself relying on Gibbed after I found equipment that worked after the first few playthroughs. I did the constant farming but after a while I found it grew tiresome, so when I got good loot, I would level it up every few levels to keep the stats in line with my level. I'm glad they changed the increase in stats more linear in TPS, as opposed to the exponential growth in BL2.     •(4) Have you thought about hopping online or asking a friend if they had a level 35 sniper they could give you or dupe for you?    •(5) have you tried farming certain chests around? This post mentions a chest in the Arid Badlands, though that's probably not unlocked yet for you in TVHM. I can't think offhand where a decent chest is to farm, but if you happen to find a nice red chest near a spawn post, quit & save, reload, open chest, rinse, repeat until you find something."
Borderlands,3am254,JebusMcAzn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"There's a decent chest spawn in Tundra, though he's probably a bit away from that.

Borderlands,3am254,TiklungChan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:29:07 2015 UTC,"You can try your luck at the golden chest to see if you can get a decent purple sniper (preferably a Droog). Alternatively, consider running through Scarlett's DLC if you have it - you can obtain the Pimpernel within an hour of gameplay by just rushing through the story. You can speed through DLC1 on normal mode to get yourself a level 30 Pimpernel, which will still be quite powerful for a while in TVHM - alternatively, you can try doing Scarlett's playthrough on your current level since it should scale with you at this point, and you'll have a Pimpernel by roughly level 36, 37.  If you don't have DLC1 then your best bet is the golden chest in Sanctuary, or just hoping you get a good sniper from a world drop or loot chest."
Borderlands,3am254,t-y-c-h-o,2,Sun Jun 21 16:08:21 2015 UTC,I would save getting a Pimpernel until after you beat the story so that you get a level 50 version. The Pimpernel is very strong and it would probably be more helpful for going into UVHM than progressing through TVHM.

And as man, you said, ""Let me show you the power of Talos Stormcrown, born of the North, where my breath is long winter. I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you.""  Aye, love. Love! Even as man, great Talos cherished us. For he saw in us, in each of us, the future of Skyrim! The future of Tamriel!

But what of tomorrow? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?  And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the will of the Thalmor! Against its own people!  So rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up, Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine!  For we are the children of man! And we shall inherit both the heavens and the earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule Skyrim! Forever!  Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment!  And deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man!  Trust in me, Whiterun! Trust in the words of Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos!

I haven't played BL2 just yet, but I know some basics of the narrative, but I'm not sure if the storylines of the main game and the DLC:s are consecutive or stand-alone.  For example, I happen to know that Roland bites it, and that Tiny Tina's Assault on Assault on Dragon Keep takes place after this, but can it be done just after that, or would it be better to wait after a specific point in the main game (the ending?) to do it?  And similarly, it obviously wouldn't make any sense to do Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax before you've even met Hammerlock, but maybe it would still be best to wait for a bit, narratively speaking?  Any advice would be appreciated."
Borderlands,3am70p,Vargkungen,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:22:15 2015 UTC,"DLCs 3 and 4 (Hammerlock's and Tina's) should be done after completion of the game, since both frequently reference and spoil events that happen late in the main campaign, Tina's DLC more so.

The Chain Lightning normally only comes from Badass Sorcerors, I believe, and cannot be a world drop - like the King of Orcs with the Ogre."

Borderlands,3ajwpw,Natex300,7,Sat Jun 20 22:39:36 2015 UTC,"The story is not as funny as BL2 and the locations are mostly moon surface and grey buildings, but the characters are fun to play as. It's pretty much a watered down BL2, but the skills feel more like a common use in combat and you can get to capstones quicker. It isn't my favorite Bordelands game, but I still played it a lot because the characters skills were just so fun to use. I'd recommend it for keeping up with the Borderlands story and for the fun of playing around with the new characters."
Borderlands,3ajwpw,Muffinofrage,4,Sat Jun 20 23:02:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the characters better in the Pre-Sequel and I think the moon gameplay is interesting. I did the same thing you did and let it go the first time, but luckily I found it at $26 USD on another site. I'm glad I got it and I'd say to go with the purchase, especially if you're a fan of the series."
Borderlands,3ajwpw,Abdul-Rahollotasuga,5,Sun Jun 21 04:25:42 2015 UTC,It is a pretty solid game IMO. I would definitely recommend.
Borderlands,3ajwpw,circuspantsman,2,Sat Jun 20 22:43:17 2015 UTC,"If you like the series it's still a nice addition to the story but it's not as good as the other 2. the lack of farmable bosses and the lootpool are my only big drawbacks imo, but it's a good price for the game and all the dlc. i still play The Pre-Sequel all the time just because i'm trying to get max level for all 6 characters and beat the 3rd play through with everyone as well, so if you're a completionist or if you enjoy replaying these games countless times there's no reason not to get it"
Borderlands,3ajwpw,mr_sporb,2,Sun Jun 21 01:29:31 2015 UTC,"BL2 was definitely my favorite. This game doesn't have a story as good, nor as funny, but you get to explore Elpis and really take in the story that happens before BL2. Plus, being on the moon is really fun. The laser guns and ice guns are cool too imo. Ah, and the new classes are a nice change as well, I suppose, even though the original ones were great.  tl;dr Fun game. The pre-sequel probably won't get any cheaper than it is on steam right now for about $20. I would definitely recommend buying it."

The vault hunters  in tps are my favorite through out the whole series, lazers are kickass, jump boosts and air glides make exploration and travel a million times better. Legendaries are much easier to acquire, moonstone is easier to find than eridium, claptastic voyage is my  favorite dlc out of all of them. I will admit lack of endgame content is a bit of a problem but it works good enough. I'd definitely give it another chance"

VH aren't saints you know, they are basically a mass murderers, so when Lilith acted like she was this saint or hero i was so angry. i think athena is the ONLY VH that knows both sides. she does not call herself a hero, she knows the difference between good and bad. and she often have this contradiction about it. but Lilith on the other hand, she thinks she's a hero but in reality she's just a bxtch who thinks she's a hero.... that got intense xD but dont get me started on Lilith...

Borderlands,3aedzk,FinestBrony44,45,Fri Jun 19 13:33:16 2015 UTC,It was heavily implied in BL1 that Hyperion guns outclassed everything else at their level at the counterpoint of being rare and expensive.

Borderlands,3aedzk,BWBHAMMER,2,Fri Jun 19 21:51:49 2015 UTC,Whats the best class & weapons to defeat crewmerax on borderlands1 and how do you get them?
Borderlands,3aedzk,HaweGame,3,Fri Jun 19 23:11:22 2015 UTC,"Mashers.   No real specific way to farm for them, as weapons in BL1 don't drop from specific sources as they do in BL2. Best bet is to just do red chest runs."
Borderlands,3aedzk,artemisdragmire,3,Fri Jun 19 23:28:20 2015 UTC,"My favourite is the Double Anarchy point , spray then runaway with Lilith . They're quite common & it's just a matter of playing musical chairs with Craw around the pillars to get the crit spot on it's back ."
Borderlands,3aedzk,1karl1,2,Fri Jun 19 23:44:59 2015 UTC,Mordecai has the most DPS in BL1.
Borderlands,3aedzk,treefitty350,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:05:23 2015 UTC,Other people have already said these but left out details. If you prefer Mordecai then mashers with a good gunslinger class mod. If you prefer Lilith then a double anarchy with at least 180x4 dmg and 8.5 fire rate or higher with a class mod that regenerates SMG ammo (I think they're called Mercenary Class Mods). The best way to acquire them without being able to kill Crawmerax would probably be armory runs or just in the shop right before Crawmerax.  P.S Brick and Roland have no way to beat Crawmerax as easily as Lilith and Mordecai can.
Borderlands,3aedzk,somekid2120,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:26:32 2015 UTC,Bl2 certain guns for certian builds will last a long time .  Swordsplosion is a beast going almost 8 levels strong with Axton Explosive build in UVHM.  Got it at 54 and im at 62 now still using it .

Borderlands,3agprg,AskACapperDOTcom,3,Sat Jun 20 03:04:01 2015 UTC,Okay thanks so much
Borderlands,3agprg,AskACapperDOTcom,2,Sat Jun 20 03:10:25 2015 UTC,Any time you progress the story mission they level up with you so run them over and over again a few times if you need XP. They are super easy to be an worth at least 3000 XP every run.
Borderlands,3agprg,John_Duh,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:30:43 2015 UTC,Also do not forget about the chest on the radar dish island at the top and the chest in the metal shed down north of the tower.  I usually take the radar chest and then jump back and goes through the building with the rocket quest and then but slams down on the shed to get it open.
Borderlands,3agprg,mujump,4,Sat Jun 20 10:29:48 2015 UTC,"In the mission where you're making the constructor (I can't remember the name), when you're calibrating the turrets, infinite psychos spawn. I've used this to level my character a bunch and I think it's the best way. The only thing is that it's only during the mission."
Borderlands,3agprg,Hammerhil,2,Sat Jun 20 08:40:05 2015 UTC,plus you can make good cash doing it as well.  When I ran my Nisha through UVHM I think I made 8 vending machine runs out of there when I finished it. There was so much loot you couldn't see the floor.

Borderlands,3afi46,SilverNightingale,15,Fri Jun 19 21:47:32 2015 UTC,Destiny is a bit like what Borderlands was first shown as.
Borderlands,3afi46,El-Grunto,3,Sat Jun 20 05:03:03 2015 UTC,A good example is when they referenced cheating against crawmerax while fighting son of crawmerax.

Borderlands,3afi46,Bear_Taco,15,Sat Jun 20 11:22:30 2015 UTC,"Destiny and Borderlands are two fairly different games. Destiny has a story that is very lackluster to many, has a some unique guns, little character building through skill trees, but lastly more of an MMO where you will want to play with others to complete the hardest missions.  Borderlands can be played single player or couch/online coop, insane gun variety, an engaging yet hilarious story, tons of skills for your character to develop, but rather shallow endgame content.  If you are looking for a more online community based game choose destiny, but if you are looking for a more cooperative experience borderlands is your game. In this sub reddit you will get fairly biased answers  (like this one), but feel free to ask me more questions as I've played both for plenty of time."
Borderlands,3afi46,Tubbychan,22,Fri Jun 19 19:16:45 2015 UTC,"To me it seemed as if Destiny was trying to be a combination of Borderlands and Halo. Unfortunatly, it was neither of those things"
Borderlands,3afi46,smit4465,14,Fri Jun 19 20:36:08 2015 UTC,Worst game i ever loved
Borderlands,3afi46,SimplyQuid,7,Sat Jun 20 02:24:39 2015 UTC,This was my assessment.
Borderlands,3afi46,caesar_the_ape_king,6,Fri Jun 19 20:51:55 2015 UTC,I started out as a Borderlands fanatic (played BL2 for 1200+ hours) and that's the reason I got into Destiny. Every since playing Destiny I can't get back into Borderlands. I love the BL universe and it's way richer than the Destiny one but I LOVE the fireteam aspect of Destiny. Nothing more enjoyable than getting a group of 3-6 people laughing and joking while doing a raid or running Iron banner or trails of osiris.
Borderlands,3afi46,mixtapelive,2,Fri Jun 19 22:16:04 2015 UTC,The shooting is significantly better in Destiny as well.
Borderlands,3afi46,Crucial_Bullets,2,Sat Jun 20 18:06:50 2015 UTC,Oh imo destiny's shooting mechanics are top notch
Borderlands,3afi46,mixtapelive,5,Sat Jun 20 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"Destiny is good until you reach lvl 20, and then it becomes a grindfest. If you get bored with a character, than you have 2 more very similar characters to choose from, and than do the same missions again that you ran 10x over for dailies.  Borderlands is fun until you reach 50/69/72 and you realise the game is actually over, and the character you have worked on is finished. At least it is pretty fun to just start over, and the character diversity is so much better, and the guns (in 2 and TPS) have some unique and fun diversity, especially with legendaries since you can still see new legends drop that you have never seen. The story is so much better too, in that it's actually there."
Borderlands,3afi46,Sayie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:44:54 2015 UTC,"Actually once you hit level 20, it's not as much of a grind fest. It used to be a huge one yes, but after recent updates it extremely easy to hit the max level in destiny now. I will say the gameplay is somewhat repetitive, but some people find it fun trying different ways to do it. There are only 2 raids and a new end game which is similar to horde mode."
Borderlands,3afi46,Karate7307,2,Sat Jun 20 14:06:37 2015 UTC,"Literally none of this sounds fun to me. I have all the DLC, but all of the missions are literally just ""go through this linear area and shoot everything"", but if u don't want to do those you can do the older ones again which is exactly the same. I never got to raids, but it sounds the same too except with a couple gimmick stuff. Also, horde mode in this game sounds incredibly boring too. At least the missions you are going somewhere, and now there's a mode to stand around and kill stuff instead of moving forward? Not even the bosses are fun, they are just the enemies you have been fighting except much bigger and bullet spongier."
Borderlands,3afi46,Sayie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:56:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, all of that stuff is true. Although, most games' campaigns are linear in their missions as well. I think the thing that makes Borderlands so much fun, is the story line is amazing and well thought out; it is a great game to play by yourself. With Destiny, it is all on end game content and community. I have made so many friends by playing Destiny, and to be quite honest, without them, the game would be like you said, dull, boring and repetitive.  Although, you could say the same thing about Borderlands too. You want a Sham? Go to the Bunker, kill it, and if you don't get it, you have to save and quit until you get the loot you want. Doing that fifty plus times was dreadful. (Although, with the new drop rates it's so much better.) With Destiny, you can't farm raids. You want certain loot? Better pray to RNG gods that you get it, or you'll have to wait until next week."
Borderlands,3afi46,Karate7307,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:14:41 2015 UTC,"The thing about borderlands though is that the game isn't built around that you have to kill Bunker 50 times to get a drop, or doing Flame of the Firehawk 20 times just for a chance of gear. It's about going through the story and being badass. As I have said before, it is a much better comparison to compare it to WoW or just about any MMO, because the Endgame for WoW with ilvl is LITERALLY THE SAME as Destiny with Light Levels except with raids."
Borderlands,3afi46,Sayie,3,Sat Jun 20 23:49:54 2015 UTC,"If you want to grind even more than Borderlands and play a disappointing game, get destiny."
Borderlands,3afi46,Gothic_Banana,5,Sat Jun 20 02:43:15 2015 UTC,"From a gameplay standpoint the only thing they have in common is they are both Class Based FPS.  Borderlands focus is the story and the loot system. All enemies drop items and weapons any you progressively trade out old gear as you level up, The level Cap is 72 in Borderlands 2 and 70 in Borderlands the Presequal (Handsome Collection has 2 full games and all their expansions included) all the borderlands games are max 4 player coop.  While borderlands focuses on story and loot, Destiny focuses more on PVP and raiding.  If you were to compare, Borderlands is more similar to Diablo where as destiny is COD."
Borderlands,3afi46,JDBriggsBlader,2,Fri Jun 19 19:09:42 2015 UTC,The gunplay in Destiny beats Borderlands easily. But Destiny has such a shitty story (ie: none to speak of) and there are really no interesting characters that you end up loving.  Destiny is a fun game if you've got a group of friends that likes to play together so that you can do all the fun endgame content without playing with exclusively random people. You'll still probably have to use the LFG sites for it from time to time. And the endgame of Destiny is really the part that shines.
Borderlands,3afi46,Vandette,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:43:21 2015 UTC,The only 2 likeable characters are Petra Venj and Variks and they only appear in the second DLC
Borderlands,3afi46,30SecondsToFail,2,Mon Jun 22 12:45:33 2015 UTC,"Destiny's loot is almost entirely reliant on RNG  (You can't really ""farm"" for anything like you can in Borderlands  PvP is much better on Destiny  (To Borderlands' credit, PvP was never a huge focus)  Borderlands has more character development and a better overall story (But it IS easy to outdo Destiny's story)  Borderlands has more complicated mechanics than Destiny (Although you could argue that Destiny is meant for people new to RPGs and the same can even be said about Borderlands)  Difficulty is less artificial in Borderlands (Destiny's bosses seem to just have a lot of minions and a shit ton of health)"
Borderlands,3afi46,30SecondsToFail,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:04:43 2015 UTC,Totally different games. Borderlands is MASSIVE compared to destiny and isn't as linear.
Borderlands,3afi46,propargylalcohol,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"Destiny is an MMO, isn't it? Borderlands is max 4 players. I don't know what sorta matchmaking consoles have, but I generally just play with Steam friends on PC. Or you can even play it by yourself. There is no persistent world in Borderlands.. just a storyline with sidequests that your friends can jump on and play with you. It's definitely more of a single player game with multiplayer options, rather than a multiplayer game. Although, I strongly suggest playing it with friends; it makes the game exponentially better."
Borderlands,3afi46,mishugashu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Destiny is literally just an MMO endgame, like in wow you could go do raids and dungeon runs to get better gear. The problem with Destiny is that the games raids were extremely boring, since in MMO's you can get to the endgame and you still have a TON of stuff to learn, and when you get there with Destiny you pretty much know all of the game."

Borderlands,3afi46,DatBowl,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"I've been playing destiny until the last expansion before dropping it off to switch to Borderlands. Destiny end game content is all about creating fire teams! Doing a raid that doesn't take 4+hrs on end requires you to find experienced group of as many as 6 people, same thing with crucible, you do not want to be stuck in a team that doesn't know what they are doing. Leveling in destiny put a heavy emphasis on endgame rewards, so you must somehow get good at those or prepare for shower of hates from irritated team members. Which lead to how much time it consumes to find team or put together a team... It's a serious game, that requires some serious time dedication and willingness to cooperate with strangers! After the last expansion heavy emphasis on pvp and giving pve player shitty horde mode. It was a breath of fresh air for me to pick up borderlands. The lighthearted fun engaging solo or couch coop really had made my day. To me having a choice to share one screen with a real life buddy sitting next to you worth ten times the experience of cooperating with strangers. I don't need to waste time finding team, I can just enjoy the game. Ps, I don't need my freakin laptop or phone to manage my inventory in Borderlands! Destiny has the worst inventory management ever and even worst space allowance. It's an rng games, all of the hard earn exotics weapons you find are collectibles, you wasted your time to find them but now you don't have anywhere to put them you have to freakin turn the post master into an over flow inventory. It's a shitty mechanic, there's more annoying things concerning destiny. In general it's a serious and rewarding game if you can invest time into it. But for a casual players that want some laugh borderlands is a jack of all trades."
Borderlands,3afi46,vinnien,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:24:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feel like Borderlands is better in every category except graphics. Destiny may look pretty, but it has you doing the same side quests and fighting the same enemies every time. The only that kept me playing a bit longer is the graphics and the beautifully crafted guns. I think you'll really enjoy Borderlands 2. The dialogue is insanely funny thanks to the colorful characters you meet and the loot always keeps you coming for more. Take some time to read about the game a bit before you start."
Borderlands,3ag5r2,kwprules,3,Fri Jun 19 21:42:35 2015 UTC,"Before the Harold grew more popular, the Maggie was used a lot more. It was easily one of the most used guns in the game. Don't get me wrong, it still is a good gun and fun to use but the Harold just outclasses it nowadays."
Borderlands,3ag5r2,jascha314,6,Sat Jun 20 00:35:02 2015 UTC,"Literally picked this up for the first time about 2 hours ago. I'm playing as Sal, and was about Lv. 20 when I got it. It allowed me to get a 30 sec Bloodwing kill, (not sure if I really needed the spoiler there, but better safe than sorry). I'm finding it works particularly well with I'm Your Huckleberry (Increased Pistol Damage and Reload Speed) and Divergent Likeness when coupled with the Law (Using two of the same weapon type during Gunzerking increases Damage and Accuracy). Also, with 8 rounds in the clip it gets a pretty sizeable last round bonus thanks to Money Shot. Will definitely be keeping this on me for a while and will be farming another for TVHM as soon as I can get the Clan Wars quests.   In terms of parts I'd personally opt for the Jakobs stock for the extra mag size and damage bonus, which would go nicely with the bonus from the guaranteed Jakobs barrel.  On a side note for people who aren't aware, when you come to the final quest of the Clan Wars line, you must choose to kill Mick Zaford at this point, or you won't be able to farm him for the Maggie afterwards."
Borderlands,3ag5r2,Shadenfall,3,Sat Jun 20 01:17:37 2015 UTC,"Not the Harold but still pretty darn good. imo it's easier to use than other Jakobs pistols due to its spread (as with BL1's mashers). It used to be the premiere pistol for Nisha (down to the purple color) until the Luck Cannon came along.  Also it's generally advised to avoid the Two Fer version, for several reasons."
Borderlands,3ag5r2,brandpanz,2,Fri Jun 19 21:58:30 2015 UTC,Why avoid the twofer?
Borderlands,3ag5r2,erethangbagel,7,Fri Jun 19 22:03:33 2015 UTC,"Marginal projectile increase, worse stats than a regular Maggie aside from base damage, increased ammo consumption. Same reasons why people tell you to avoid a Double Penetrating Fragnum."
Borderlands,3ag5r2,brandpanz,3,Fri Jun 19 22:21:29 2015 UTC,"Two Fer is a pretty good prefix for Gaige, and it's workable for Sal.  Any other character wants a different prefix.  It's good for Gaige because it empties its clip faster with that prefix, which means more anarchy, and she doesn't care about accuracy anyway.  (Two Fer doesn't affect reload speed, which is the other trait she might care about.)  It works for Sal because it does increase the gun's DPS by a bit, it just costs accuracy and more ammo - both things Sal can correct for with the Rampage tree.  It can also work for him in that it increases the mag size above the crucial Money Shot threshold, but its increased ammo consumption actually lets it trigger Money Shot in fewer shots.  I think Sal probably still prefers Dastardly with a Jakobs grip, I'm just saying he could still use a Two Fer if that's what dropped for him."
Borderlands,3ag5r2,cannons_for_days,5,Sat Jun 20 04:56:37 2015 UTC,"You really want the Trick Shot prefix. It makes the bullets bounce off walls. I used to hate it because I really liked mashers in the first Borderlands game, but I later came to like it when I stopped thinking of it as the same kind of weapon. It's more suited for just unloading a magazine quickly at an enemy. It is especially good with Trick Shot prefix on Zero with the Bore skill because bullets will go through enemies and bounce off walls to hit them again in certain situations."
Borderlands,3ag5r2,DandyTheLion,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:06:55 2015 UTC,"Or two 'fer, double the bullets.

You can literally play just looking at the mini map"
Borderlands,3ag5r2,g0d0fm15ch13f,3,Sat Jun 20 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"Fantastic gun for Nisha in TPS.  Pretty sweet gun for Gaige and Salvador in BL2.  Good for certain Axton builds.  Give it a pass as Maya or Krieg.  The Maggie, like the Slagga, is an insanely easy farm.  Leave Lynchwood by the train, kill Mick, save&quit, reload.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Mick is a little harder to kill than the Hodunks because he cloaks, but it's still probably the third easiest farm in the game.  Can also be done at the end of runs of Bug Gulch, but it is a little hike from the hill.  Thumbs up - great gun for certain builds, ludicrously ammo efficient with the right parts, and crazy easy to farm.  Worth using on half of the characters in the game.  Very handy to have stashed on one of your characters."
Borderlands,3ag5r2,cannons_for_days,3,Sat Jun 20 05:05:45 2015 UTC,"I'm loving this gun in TPS on Nisha.  I've got two now, both from grinding the crap out of the golden chest.  First one had a stabilizer, that was nice.  Used it from lvl 21 to 30.  Just before logging off at 3am I grinded up some more junk guns and got a shiny lvl 30 maggie.  I'm pleased.  I just got tps this past week on the steam sale and this gun just tears through shit."
Borderlands,3ag5r2,TheMFDrez,2,Sat Jun 20 13:38:18 2015 UTC,"I remember getting this in a chest at the info stockade. This thing lasted me quite a bit into TVHM,  and tore up nearly everything I came across.   This is essentially a shotgun pistol, with the multiple pellets of a shotgun, the clip size and reserve of a pistol, and the crit bonus of a Jacobs. The multiple pellets help ensure you get a crit, and you can easily spam this fun.   The extra pellets make this a good bee delivery system."
Borderlands,3ag5r2,fozzzyyy,4,Fri Jun 19 23:18:02 2015 UTC,"The extra pellets make this a good bee delivery system.   They don't, really.

Borderlands,3ahzam,brandpanz,2,Sat Jun 20 15:07:46 2015 UTC,UVHM is hard only if you don't use slag and you don't have a good survival strategy. Once you have both of those down it gets much easier. It's really about having a good build more than anything else.

Borderlands,3aeugg,crazyivan111,4,Fri Jun 19 15:34:31 2015 UTC,You need someone that can fight up close and personal because Aurelia has problems with melee. Since you want a support I suggest picking Athena with the phalanx tree because she can just run up and use her shield and block all attacks and distract the enemy while Aurelia stays in back and picks them off. Also tell your Aurelia to put at least one point into bitter riposte because it might be in the cryo tree but any enemy that attacks her shield when it's full is almost guaranteed dead (bosses and cryo enemies aren't included).
Borderlands,3aeugg,Muffinofrage,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:11:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! She is one of the ones I'd considered, but was unsure if I'd end up rarely getting to close range with the enemies due to Aurelia killing everything from long range.  Alternately, I am concerned the melee vs ranged split could put us too far apart to help one another if one of us goes down.  How serious of a problem do you think that would be?"
Borderlands,3aeugg,Muffinofrage,3,Fri Jun 19 16:22:16 2015 UTC,"With the boosts you get from oz kits you should be able to move to your downed ally pretty quickly. Also Athena has an upgrade for her skill that lets her revive someone from a distance if you hit the down ally with it when you throw it. The only problem you'll have as Athena is that some of her skills require allies to be close in order for them to get health or shield regen, but if your Aurelia takes that one point in bitter riposte and gets magic bullet she won't have problems with health regen. If she has both of those basically what happens is an enemy pings her and gets frozen, she strolls up and point blank crits him, and suddenly she starts regening all the way to full life. Plus when she crits a far away enemy that's close to you, you would get healed my magic bullet's healing nova which also second winds you. With magic bullet's health regen and the fact both of you have long range second winds, I think you're fine."
Borderlands,3aeugg,blackmarketdolphins,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:08:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's some awesome synergy actually.  I hadn't bothered to thoroughly examine Aurelia's skills yet, and had assumed the sniping tree would be pretty ""selfish"", like Zer0's.  Thanks a ton for your insights!  I feel much more confident in the viability of that pairing."
Borderlands,3aeq5d,Pequa94,2,Fri Jun 19 14:59:50 2015 UTC,"You could probably survive if you went to UVHM now, but it's best to do the DLC since you'll be able to get some DLC-specific weapons (example being the SWORDSPLOSION!!! from Tiny Tina's; I'm level 58 on my Commando and still using one of the x3 sword ones from TVHM) as well as gain some XP and get some extra skills that might give you an edge. You theoretically can do DLC at any point in any playthrough. The way UVHM works, I think you could do it at any point because no matter where you are in the regular game in UVHM, the enemies just scale to the level of the highest-leveled character. As in, does UVHM reset anything in TVHM? No, it does not. You can always start UVHM, and if it turns out to be too tough for you, you could go back to TVHM and do the DLC/any quests you didn't do."

Borderlands,3aeq5d,RidiculousNicholas55,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:52:30 2015 UTC,"Ummm I think you can enter UVHM now, although the enemies might be scaled to lvl 50 so it might be worth it to level up a bit and then once you hit 50 go into UVHM.  The DLC will be unlocked from the beginning, but it always is unlocked from the beginning regardless of play through. Unless you're talking about level scaling? In which case yes it will scale to whatever level you are.  UVHM will reset everything, it's a new play through, just like when you entered TVHM."

It also interrupts gameplay with potentially unwanted dialogue.  No ShamFleeting.  It hogs bandwidth and takes kills from others.  Try not to run too far ahead.  Wait for people before taking elevators.  Try to flow with everyone else in terms of where they are (geographically) in the game--unless the mission is moving to a new area and you're specced in Fleet--then feel free to haul ass to the fast travel, exit, etc.  Ask before grabbing a weapon drop if it's either a unique or legendary.  Blue and purples are usually OK to take, but it's common courtesy to ask.  I ask when I'm the host just in case someone wants it more than I do (e.g. I'm playing Sal and a Lyuda drops, etc.).  Otherwise just jump in a public game and have fun.  For the most part people are pretty easygoing.

A) that is possible, I used the tool to mod golden keys before, but realized it was useless  B) If you are going to mod anyway, might as well use gibbed and give yourself the shit you want."
Borderlands,3aa2pr,Bear_Taco,8,Thu Jun 18 14:41:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree with point B:  Sometimes you just can't get through an area because your gear is too old. In the first Borderlands, you could use the same gun or shield for 10-20 levels, sometimes more. In BL2, sometimes 1-2 levels can turn a nuke into a nerf gun. If you remember the BL2 launch; golden keys were practically unlimited with codes for 3, 5, even 20 keys every day or two. I don't see as many codes being tossed around anymore so I think adding a few golden keys to an account can keep gameplay moving along without feeling too cheaty.  Sure, the same tools allow you to simply load up a perfect set of gear but have you played many games on godmode? It stops being fun pretty fast. When I hit a wall on a new character, I'll burn a few keys to get something that fits my playstyle; I almost never get something I'll use on the first key. I don't play too much anymore but my golden key supply is basically exhausted. If I were to get back into it with some friends, I'd definitely load up some golden keys to pop the chest in Sanctuary a few times.

Borderlands,3a9kf1,smartbycomparison,2,Thu Jun 18 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I'm not really worried about transferring anything to PC, since I'm only level 34 on BL and just started BL2."
Borderlands,3a9kf1,Daemmerung,2,Fri Jun 19 09:04:03 2015 UTC,"That's perilously little RAM for BL2.  Also, you don't volunteer your laptop's GPU, so I'll assume the worst.  Keep playing on Xbox."
Borderlands,3a9kf1,Daemmerung,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:51:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I could've sworn I had more, like at least 4GB. I didn't purchase this myself, it was a gift, but picked out by my dad (who knows his computer stuff, and chose this one specifically because I wanted to play games).    The graphics card is an NVIDIA GeForce GT 220M. I don't recall having any problems playing whatever was new back then, but obviously things are a little different now."
Borderlands,3a9kf1,Grevas13,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:15:07 2015 UTC,"220M should be able host the game if you detune the graphics enough in Options.  It's the RAM that worries me.  A point of comparison: I've played both BL and BL2 on a Win7 laptop with 4GB RAM and a Radeon HD 5650, 1366x768.  BL worked quite well, but BL2 thrashed while loading maps, and struggled audibly (howling disk and fans) whenever putting the game into the background.  A couple more GB would have reduced swapping and increased performance substantially.  The Steam store advertises BL2 as requiring 2GB, for what it's worth."

Borderlands,3a7l4c,kwprules,20,Wed Jun 17 21:17:37 2015 UTC,"Is there really much to say?  Its the Slagga, you should probably have one in your inventory at all times in UVHM."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,Volcanicrage,13,Wed Jun 17 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"Play Anarchy Mechromancer Equip the Slagga Close your eyes Hold down the fire button and shake mouse vigorously    Congratulations, everything in the room is now slagged, and you can proceed to one-shot them with your weapon of choice.  You guys might laugh, but this is actually how I do it."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,Zaaptastic,8,Thu Jun 18 04:27:59 2015 UTC,"Not really sure if the Fridgia could be considered the successor to the Slagga? Obviously there isn't any slag in TPS so there's no direct spiritual successor.  Fantastic weapon for slagging, I would say that either this or a slag Pimp is mandatory once you reach UVHM. I prefer the Pimp for slagging humanoid enemies because it reliably slags with a single shot to the enemy's feet, but I find the Slagga better for creatures like bullymongs and stalkers who aren't tall enough to catch the Pimp's child projectiles. The high fire rate and extra projectiles also make the Slagga good for hitting moving targets."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,Xyanite,7,Wed Jun 17 21:44:55 2015 UTC,I think the Fridgia is more of a frost Lascaux
Borderlands,3a7l4c,MyOtherTagsGood,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"Now that I think of it, it is just a reskinned cryo version of the Lascaux. They even fire in the same bull-shaped pattern."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,Xyanite,3,Thu Jun 18 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"I preferred your initial assessment.  Sure, mechanically Fridgia is based on Lascaux.  But in terms of usage, it's very much like Slagga: kind of an aerosol debuffer that consumes SMG ammo, emitting multiple elemental debuff rounds at an elevated elemental probability.  Unique instead of Legendary, though, which changes a lot in terms of keeping it in a loadout."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,Daemmerung,7,Thu Jun 18 21:41:48 2015 UTC,"Great DPS weapon during Normal and TVHM, but come UVHM when you're slagging everything before you shoot it gets relegated to being mostly a slagging tool. I'm a Magic Missile guy so I never really used this in UVHM. For slagging purposes I'd probably go for a Bulets Go Fasterfied variant with a Maliwan grip and a Dahl/Hyperion stock, while for DPS I'd go for a Bandit grip instead."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,brandpanz,5,Wed Jun 17 22:28:30 2015 UTC,I love this gun!  In normal and TVHM the Slagga is an absolute beast.  In UVHM the damage isn't quite high enough to be a primary weapon imo but it's still a great slagging tool.  Sure the Grog Nozzle outshines it but I still love it.  It's the closest we ever got to the return of the Double Anarchy from BL1.
Borderlands,3a7l4c,tazercow,5,Thu Jun 18 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"The Slagga is consistently a top gear choice for just about any character that uses an SMG, and it's easy to see why. High slag chance, multiple projectiles, and a massive magazine mean that it's not only useful at lower difficulties, but a great utility gun at higher difficulties where slag is a necessity.  This is a gun that fits into any build. YOu need slag to do good damage, and the gun provides it. Axton and Maya can get away with not using it thanks to their skills, but just about everyone else should at least have on in their inventory if they're mobbing. Zer0 might be the only exception. Bandit grip for a little extra power and a lot more bullets. Dahl stock because if it can have a Dahl stock, it should have a Dahl stock. Prefix is to preference, but I like ""bullets go fasterfied"" to make taking out fast moving targets a little easier. Sight is also to preference, but Maliwan is pretty much the best. Definitely, but it does mean that the Maggie becomes unable to be easily farmed, which is a dealbreaker to some. The Dust has a great farming route (Behind Ellie's, Black Queen, Mobley and Gettle, and Hodunk/Zaford) so you can farm it easily while getting some other gear as well. I seem to get them a lot from LLMs as well, so WEP runs might get you some too."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,meh_mediocre,3,Thu Jun 18 13:24:55 2015 UTC,"I use a slag-elemental Bone Shredder as a Slagga stand-in on Gaige.  It's not as ammo-efficient as Slagga and doesn't have Slagga's elemental effect rate buff, but it does substantially more base damage (diminished by Close Enough, amplified by Anarchy) and has a smaller magazine (for more Anarchy).  Maliwan grip if I can get it, Bulets go fasterifed accessory."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,Daemmerung,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:02:34 2015 UTC,"And 2000% more tedious to farm, to boot! =P"
Borderlands,3a7l4c,cannons_for_days,2,Fri Jun 19 00:20:02 2015 UTC,"Bone Shredder is a bog-easy farm!  Bone Head 2.0 drops it probably one time in three.  I usually pay him (it?) a visit whenever I'm in the Arid Nexus chubby-chasing.  edit: Oh, I think I follow you now.  Sure, farming for that particular set of parts on Bone Shredder would be lethal.  However, I'm in the Arid Nexus often enough that I probably see one in slag (never mind the grip and accessory) about every other experience level.  Makes for a change of pace from humping Tector Hodunk's leg at any rate.  I'm not much of one for boss-farming."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,Daemmerung,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:29:26 2015 UTC,"Well, and that Bone Head is substantially farther away from the nearest spawn point than the Hodunks are, with the additional hazard of potentially aggroing a rabid skag on your way there.  (Although, since I guess you're specifically chubby hunting while you're there, that already comes with the territory.)"
Borderlands,3a7l4c,cannons_for_days,5,Fri Jun 19 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"Theres a special place in my heart for the Slagga, mainly because it is a powerful weapon that can be used for several levels until you should farm for a new one. My level 53 Slagga lasted me until level 65 before I farmed for a new one."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,This_Is__,2,Wed Jun 17 23:07:17 2015 UTC,Maya with a bee & cat class mod is good with the Slagga too . For most mobs once slagged with it you don't really need to change to another weapon .

Borderlands,3a7l4c,k8ph85,2,Thu Jun 18 14:11:03 2015 UTC,"Nice in Normal Mode and TVHM  You can use it with any character but Maya gets the most use out of it as it is an SMG   Murdering with Bandit grip, Dahl Stock and Fire Rate part (the little box on the side)  I personally don't see the point in farming it as the Grog Nozzle does just as well when it comes to slagging enemies and the Tattler out does it in DPS"
Borderlands,3a7l4c,30SecondsToFail,2,Fri Jun 19 13:02:16 2015 UTC,"Only got this gun once when I was farming LLM in WEP, and I agree: this is a fantastic slag weapon. High rate of fire, high magazine, high slag chance and it fires multiple pellets per shot.  Sadly, I think that the grog nozzle is somewhat better, since it has an insanely high slag chance too and a very nice life steal, which is very important for UVHM"
Borderlands,3a7l4c,NEWVACHE,4,Fri Jun 19 14:23:40 2015 UTC,ive never seen the reason to get one ive just always used a ruby/grog nozzle and now on my Axton my turret slags
Borderlands,3a7l4c,docpyro1,2,Thu Jun 18 01:18:00 2015 UTC,"You cannot have both the Maggie and the Slagga farmable at once in the same save file - they come from divergent choices in a non-repeatable quest.  For some characters, this presents a difficult dilemma, and I typically choose the Maggie.  The Slagga is extremely inaccurate, despite whatever it tells you on the card, but it's a multi-pellet gun, so it fires a whole lot of rounds in a very short amount of time.  This makes it more of a shotgun replacement than most SMGs.  If you have a Slagga at-level, and you have any fire-rate bonuses whatsoever, it will likely outperform most other guns in sustained DPS because of its massive magazine.  However, it is an ammo hog.  As others have mentioned, the Slagga is good for applying slag because its elemental effect chance is relatively high, its fire rate is pretty high, and it gets multiple chances to apply per shot.  It won't be as reliable as a Maliwan pistol or sniper rifle, but it provides more DPS than either of those (provided you're within its effective range).  The Slagga's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, and its farm is pretty easy (literally leave Lynchwood and kill the Hodunks;  Save and repeat.)  But because of its poor accuracy and its main use as a slag tool, you may not need a Slagga - you may be better served by using a slag grenade mod, or just getting slag from your skills.  And if you don't have any fire rate bonuses, or you're not willing to move into close-quarters to use it, the Slagga is not quite as useful as other guns which are roughly as easy to get.  Hard to rate because you have a choice between this and the Maggie.  Thumbs up for Krieg - a good slagging tool is fantastic for him and he wants to get up close and personal anyway.  Thumbs up for Maya - Jakobs weapons aren't great for her anyway, and the Slagga plays right into the strengths of one of her best class mods (the Cat).  Everyone else, no rating - you might want a Slagga, you might not, it depends on how you like to play."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,cannons_for_days,3,Thu Jun 18 02:34:30 2015 UTC,The number of projectiles that can be fired in such a short time means Gaige only needs a second or two to fully slag an entire area. Definitely a must have for mobbing on Gaige.
Borderlands,3a7l4c,Giffylube,3,Thu Jun 18 03:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah among all Vault Hunters I've used the Slagga with, Gaige was definitely the one that had the most use out of it. Grog Nozzle & Ruby just didn't cut it."
Borderlands,3a7l4c,jayen,0,Thu Jun 18 05:47:58 2015 UTC,"It's very good if you've gone far enough down Anarchy that you have Nth Degree, especially if you're actually using Discord, and doubly so if you have not gone down Little Big Trouble to pick up Interspersed Outburst and Make it Sparkle (which are her two slagging skills).  But if you don't have much invested in Ordered Chaos, you will get more out of the Maggie, since Anarchy itself only offers gun damage, which is what Jakobs guns benefit most from.  Of all the good slag tools in the game, the Slagga is definitely the most natural fit for the high-anarchy mobbing style, but that's not always what Gaige is doing, and it is arguably one of the worst weapons she can bring to a boss fight.  (It is terrible for building/maintaining Anarchy stacks.)"
Borderlands,3a7l4c,cannons_for_days,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:16:18 2015 UTC,"Actually,  you can farm both on the same save file. Once you're on the quest where to choose to side with the hodunks or the zafords, you just kill mick or jumbo, but not there group. If you kill mick, but not the rest of the zaford grunts and he doesn't drop the maggie, LEAVE THE GRUNTS ALIVE ,then save and quit, and repeat until he drops it. Then do the same for jumbo. As long as you don't wipe out the whole team, it doesn't count as you siding with the other team"

Borderlands,3a75xv,Xfazedout,24,Wed Jun 17 19:29:42 2015 UTC,"Get the Claptrap one. The others are fine if you want to try new characters, but the Claptrap one is by far the most tangible game content.  The season pass is an okay deal, but not nearly as amazing as the season pass for BL2 was."
Borderlands,3a75xv,realchriscasey,4,Wed Jun 17 19:44:06 2015 UTC,"I personally love the new characters. Aurelia effortlessly freezes everyone AND starts with two purple guns plus around $37K. Jack, on the other hand leads to some carnage, running around and blasting digi-jacks with the greater good tree. Nothing to say about the other two skill trees, though."
Borderlands,3a75xv,origamania,11,Thu Jun 18 02:20:18 2015 UTC,"I would honestly say just get all of them.  The two character dlc's are fantastic.  Jack is an absolute monster of a pet class while at the same time keeping it from being the same thing we see with all pet classes.  His gun loyalty tree can be good, but personally, I prefer to use his left and middle trees to buff his dopplegangers into absolute monsters.  He is currently my favorite class in the game, and I would absolutely recommend getting him.  Aurelia is the true sniper class that was sort of missing from the vanilla game while at the same time having a very useful and crazy coop mechanic if you like going through the game with a friend.  Her action skill is extremely destructive due to the fact that cryo is absurdly good in this game.  If you have a friend that would be willing to go through the game with you, I highly recommend getting this class.  If you prefer solo/public games, she's still a great class, but in my opinion, slightly less fun.  Claptastic voyage is comparable to Assault on Dragon Keep.  It has an amazing story, and an extremely challenging (but at the same time sorta bullshit) final boss if you weren't completely satisfied with the final boss of the main story as most people have complained.  The Holodome adds a tiny tiny bit of story, but honestly, by itself isn't worth the money, as it's just another arena dlc.  Ordinarily, I would recommend getting the season pass, but since the summer sale is going on, the season pass is exactly the same price as all the dlc individually and the shock drop slaughter pit, which you don't get in the season pass.  If you don't want to drop $22.50 on dlc, then I would recommend getting them in this order.  1. Claptastic Voyage 2. Doppleganger 3. Lady Hammerlock 4. Holodome 5. Shock Drop Slaughter Pit  Hope this helps!"
Borderlands,3a75xv,Pochama999,3,Wed Jun 17 19:50:43 2015 UTC,"There are 2 playable dlcs and 2 dlc characters. Claptrastic voyage is the only playable dlc worth getting, but you can't play it until around level 30 or so, so do the normal story beforehand to decide if you want more content. The other dlc is just fighting wave after wave of enemies for a few lines of dialogue and some rewards.   As for the characters Aurelia is focused on snipers, cryo, and co-op. I used her as a sniper and I can 1 shot 90% of enemies and even though I only use a sniper I never run out of ammo because she gets a free shot if she kills with a crit.  Jack is a bit hard to explain. It'd be easier to just tell you to look up his skills. I will say however that he is by far my favorite because he is capable of getting almost infinite grenades, heals with each kill, and he reloads when you throw grenades so you never have to reload. I'm no expert, but if any character is op then it would be Jack."

I hit the level cap before it increased and started trying out other characters since then. Start out with the left tree because it makes your DigiJacks insanely tough, provides major health restoration, and gives out free grenades. Just keep in mind I'm no expert and everyone's play style is different, so feel free to change it up.   Edit: I almost forgot. Just as a tip, if you do go left tree never move far away from your digijacks. If you move too far they will despawn and respawn next to you. This is good if they are stuck in some place and need to be moved for a better shot, but left tree digijacks get stronger the longer they are out so despawning them will make their damage reset and that bonus damage can get pretty massive."

Borderlands,3a77yq,Weltall548,2,Wed Jun 17 19:44:11 2015 UTC,Turn off physx.  I think it has something to do with the ridiculous height of the map and physx just can't handle it.  My computer can normally handle physx on high but I had the same problem in the subconscious level.  After turning physx down all the way it worked fine.

I don't really know if it's even included in the console version tbh.    The ps4 runs on AMD hardware which isn't optimized for physx, so if it is there it could be bottlenecking your system."

Borderlands,3a6c8r,Bro0od,6,Wed Jun 17 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"Not every boss has a chance to drop a legendary.  Many will drop blue or purple rarity weapons almost every time.    Knuckle Dragger is very easy to farm and has a chance to drop a Hornet.  It is not a great gun but does plenty of damage early on.    The game can be kind of tough solo, could you play with any friends until you get the hang of it?  If not, I recommend a nice Jakobs sniper (high damage and very high crit bonus), take it slow, and aim for them headshots.  If you are having trouble with a specific mission, check it on borderlands.wikia.com to try and get a better understanding of how to kill a boss or get a basic strategy.  Happy Vaulting!"

At the time I didn't understand that you always have to try to upgrade your guns & not just holding on to the one you like. So whenever you see a gun of the same type with better numbers, use that! (look at the green arrows on the item card while holding your current weapon). And start with a character that has helpers - like Commando or Mechromancer."

For me, this made things a little easier because I could get better guns/shields etc. Also, once you get to level 5 and unlock your skill, things get a little easier. With the better drop rates now, there seems to be more blue/purple guns then when I first played thru it. So idk if that will help. This was my first FPS I've ever played, and my first play thru was with Zero. Some people have told me he is the hardest to solo with at the beginning of the game, but idk. I know this sub has helped me quite a bit."

Borderlands,3a32ft,PriestmanX,28,Tue Jun 16 23:20:46 2015 UTC,"To add to this, cel-shading is a specific rendering technique that Gearbox does not use for Borderlands. The thick borders that are present in a lot cel-shaded games and in Borderlands are usually just added on.  If you notice Windwaker for Gamecube, it was an entirely cel-shaded game yet did NOT have the thick borders.  To reiterate what you said, Borderlands is just hand-drawn textures with thick borders, which produces a SIMILAR art-style to cel-shading. But is NOT cel-shading."
Borderlands,3a32ft,scrollbreak,8,Wed Jun 17 01:08:53 2015 UTC,"Does the borderlands style have some kind of name for it? It's fairly distinctive, so I would have thought there'd be a name?  Edit: Borderlines? ;)"

Borderlands,3a32ft,yamar35,13,Thu Jun 18 00:17:42 2015 UTC,"The thick borders are actually an extra shader on TOP of the textures.  You can turn them off, it makes the game look nicer (imo), AND it super boosts FPS because it's not rendering another layer of shaders on top."
Borderlands,3a32ft,das7002,13,Wed Jun 17 04:32:25 2015 UTC,"I think I never would've played Borderlands at all if it did t have the thick borders.   A distinct art style can be enough to lure you in and want to see more. If it was just a plain and boring looking game (which is what it looks like to me with borders off, but if you want to be weirdos and shut then off go right ahead, to each their own) I probably would've ignored it as another generic fps game."

Borderlands,3a32ft,spikus93,7,Wed Jun 17 08:46:03 2015 UTC,"When a game is created, it is often drawn in a program and then linked up to the games code so the art/models know where to be and how to react to user input. Basically, the Borderlands textures were all hand-drawn, uploaded to the developer's PC/network and modeled with those textures placed on the models. Then the models/textures are input into the code via specific plugins. The code will then tell the object/texture where it should be and what it looks like, how it reacts to stimuli, etc.   Hopefully this clears it up."
Borderlands,3a32ft,werewolf359,0,Wed Jun 17 15:02:08 2015 UTC,"That's pretty close, my point was and remains that describing the process of applying a texture to a model as the texture being ""coded in"" betrays a laughable ignorance of the process for someone using a vaguely condescending tone (/u/iswearatkids/, not you).  It's like... saying putting a hot dog in a bun is ""cooking it in"", but that doesn't even come close to capturing the extent of the mismatch.  Maybe it's closer to saying that the act of putting on a jacket is ""inventing novel and unique ways of interacting with fabric"".  It also suggests that there is some special, non-standard ""coding in"" process that distinguishes what Borderlands does from cel-shading."

Borderlands,3a5tgy,CriticalFaceTime,2,Wed Jun 17 14:58:22 2015 UTC,"Go back to TVHM and get yourself a Fibber, which you get as a mission reward from Mal in Eridium Blight (he stands by the entrance to Ore Chasm). Since the Fibber gets a 3000% bonus damage when it ricochets from a surface and then hits an enemy aaaand Gaige has this awesome Close Enough skill, you can shoot at the floor the whole time or some walls and always clear out the area without real trouble. Of course slag everything before this. I could use my Lv.50 Fibber even until Lv.59 on UVHM! Also, even if you don't go for an Anarchy Gaige build, maybe you put this 1 point in Anarchy, because since you never need to aim with this, the gun damage will be nothing but benefitial. Don't forget to make sure you get yourself a ricochet fibber and not the shotgun fibber! (you can tell the difference by looking at the damage, the shotgun fibber will have an x1 multiplier to a lower base damage....best prefix for the ricochet one will be the redundant prefix) I can confirm that this totally works, because I had the exact same problem with Gaige back than :)"

Borderlands,3a50ic,semi_modular_mind,2,Wed Jun 17 07:42:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm intrigued though. I just don't want it to kill off Borderlands..."
Borderlands,3a50ic,Daemmerung,11,Wed Jun 17 07:44:39 2015 UTC,Yesterday at E3:   Randy Pitchford mentions next Borderlands game during Battleborn presentation-  https://youtu.be/BWIW6_4i1jU?t=56m05s  Pitchford sitting next to Burch at the Playstaion presentation-  https://youtu.be/sYynqHfW79A?t=1h25m25s  *Fixed the second link.
Borderlands,3a50ic,semi_modular_mind,22,Wed Jun 17 09:13:13 2015 UTC,You mined the one mention of the next Borderlands being in pre-production out of an hour and a half presentation on another game entirely?  You really ARE the best Slab ever.
Borderlands,3a50ic,N3WM4NH4774N,3,Wed Jun 17 15:03:31 2015 UTC,"It was only 10 minutes of Battleborn and I was watching it anyway, no big deal!"
Borderlands,3a50ic,Mockingbirddw,6,Wed Jun 17 16:01:34 2015 UTC,You're the real MV-slab.
Borderlands,3a50ic,Daemmerung,3,Wed Jun 17 17:14:16 2015 UTC,"Yes! He did talk about it, thank you."
Borderlands,3a50ic,Mockingbirddw,3,Wed Jun 17 17:06:23 2015 UTC,Bring back Burch!
Borderlands,3a50ic,Daemmerung,2,Wed Jun 17 14:27:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'm the in the minority, but I feel like after the Pre-Sequel, I'm pretty glad Burch isn't coming back. His writing seems to have deteriorated pretty drastically between BL2 and TPS regarding peripheral characters and pacing. I feel like they need a new writer to bring the series back to BL2 level quality. The series needs a breath of fresh air, both in terms of story and gameplay."
Borderlands,3a50ic,Mockingbirddw,2,Sat Jun 20 05:54:56 2015 UTC,Burch did not write the Pre-Sequel.  Unfortunately.
Borderlands,3a50ic,Daemmerung,3,Sat Jun 20 06:34:05 2015 UTC,"He had a very big hand in it's writing, actually. Gearbox provided a good amount of their writing staff to 2K Australia during development. A simple Google search will show as much. Somewhere between BL2 and TPS his writing changed, and for the worse. I attribute a good part of that to him allowing his political views to influence his writing in a very noticeable way (an obsession with being PC, arbitrarily making characters gay, which he admitted he did in detriment to the story, etc.) Getting new people on the development team and writing staff will be a very good thing for the series moving forward, both in terms of mechanics and storytelling.  Hopefully BL3 will be a return to form, in a very large way."
Borderlands,3a50ic,Mockingbirddw,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:26:54 2015 UTC,"He wrote the dialogue of existing Borderlands-universe characters like Brick, Lilith, and Tiny Tina, thus ensuring that they stayed in-character.  About three quarters of the writing came from 2K Australia."
Borderlands,3a50ic,origamania,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:40:22 2015 UTC,"He played a large role in the creation of new characters as well, such as Janey Springs, Zarpedon, and many of the trying-way-too-hard-to-be-Australian NPCs. Of course he didn't have total control, but he held a large amount of control due to his position among the writing staff."

I definitely can't see 2K allowing Gearbox to make an MMO cause it would kill off a big cash cow."

Borderlands,3a50ic,TheAdminsAreNazis,5,Thu Jun 18 03:51:37 2015 UTC,I really want whoever wrote the dialogue for TftBL to write for BL3. Burch's lolsorandom/reference-based humour kinda wore on me after a while and stopped being funny mid-way through BL2.
Borderlands,3a50ic,Rienuaa,8,Wed Jun 17 13:30:53 2015 UTC,Screw you! It was hilarious!- Handsome Jack
Borderlands,3a50ic,Rainbaw,7,Wed Jun 17 16:16:35 2015 UTC,"The dialogue in TFTB is absolutely fantastic. It's clever, funny, just more... Borderlands-esque dialogue."
Borderlands,3a50ic,CGAdam,2,Wed Jun 17 17:07:50 2015 UTC,"Burch has a talent for both lolsorandom and hard hitting emotion. Remember that part when Jack mentions showing mercy to Tannis right before you meet Angel? That's good fucking writing. I'm sad to see him go, he was good at writing one of the best villains I've ever seen."
Borderlands,3a50ic,Rainbaw,2,Wed Jun 17 17:13:17 2015 UTC,"Handsome Jack is being written by someone else in TFTB, and they're doing really well. I love Anthony Burch's writing, but this person can pull it off."
Borderlands,3a50ic,CGAdam,5,Wed Jun 17 17:15:14 2015 UTC,"I know, and I'm glad, but the lolsorandom was a really integral part of his character. That's what I love about him - he's a genuinely funny dude. Or really thinks he is :P"
Borderlands,3a50ic,origamania,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah; who knows, maybe Anthony Burch will advise! He did write a bit of TFTB."
Borderlands,3a50ic,magregginz,2,Wed Jun 17 17:33:44 2015 UTC,Burch was really good in Bl2 but I could feel weird elements coming through in the pre-sequel which he co-wrote for I don't know if they were because of 2K oz or what.   I do know that I hated stuff like Torgue talking about feminism and the friendzone that felt forced and unnecessary and IIRC that was Burch. IMO he was an incredible writer in BL2 but if I have my info correct he has kind of become an SJW.
Borderlands,3a50ic,TheAdminsAreNazis,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:47:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah. He became a SJW, and the shit that seeped into TPS kind of killed my love for his writing.   At the same time, he wrote Jack killing someone with a spoon and the belt sander line, so I can't hate him..."

Borderlands,3a3pd7,Drewbs44,11,Wed Jun 17 00:00:13 2015 UTC,I would say Borderlands 2 because there is way more content for it.
Borderlands,3a3pd7,SacrificedSons,2,Wed Jun 17 00:05:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Would you say there is hope for TPS? Like do people think it will improve beyond BL2 when it gets more DLC? Sorry, I don't know the current situation very much."
Borderlands,3a3pd7,Daemmerung,3,Wed Jun 17 00:09:32 2015 UTC,"TPS won't get any more DLC.  So it's never going to improve on BL2 in that respect.  Play TPS once you're ready for a change from BL2.  Maybe wait for the sale after this one, if you're frugal.  I only play TPS nowadays, but it's not going anywhere.  It'll still be here at the year's end."
Borderlands,3a3pd7,SacrificedSons,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:13:52 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the development studio responsible for the Pre-Sequel 2K Australia was shutdown so I don't think anymore content will come out for the Pre-Sequel, which only got one good story DLC (Claptastic Voyage). The rest of the DLC was 2 extra characters and an Underdome equivalent. Also, they added grinders that can be abused to get Legendaries from, so there is no point to farming (not much end game). Also, the way the story in the Pre-Sequel works is it begins after the first game and end after the second so it works out better if you've played the second game first IMO."
Borderlands,3a3pd7,nathanj0872,2,Wed Jun 17 00:53:47 2015 UTC,I think calling the Holodome an Underdome equivalent is giving it way too much credit.  The Underdome at least had multiple maps that were smaller than 10 square miles and interesting (if sometimes sadistic) challenges.
Borderlands,3a3pd7,xelarate86,6,Wed Jun 17 04:40:21 2015 UTC,"Borderlands 2, hands down. TPS just doesn't have the same replayability and content that BL2 has. Also, it's cheaper."
Borderlands,3a3pd7,ScootaLewis,4,Wed Jun 17 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"Borderlands 2, no question. But you should still play TPS afterwards because fuck it's more story."
Borderlands,3a3pd7,_darkwingduck_,5,Wed Jun 17 01:01:15 2015 UTC,"BL2 way more endgame content, better replay value, enjoyable progression, tons of good DLC.  TPS is okay, but it's lack of raid bosses, post game, and DLC lets it down a lot."
Borderlands,3a3pd7,Muffinofrage,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:24:03 2015 UTC,"BL2. It has better story, better dlc, better characters, better enemy variety, and better environments. The only main point that PS did better was that it had skill trees that let you get 2 capstones before level 50 and can even get all three capstones with the dlcs by 70, but even then that means they had less skills per tree."
Borderlands,3a3pd7,HandsomeSnack,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:50:15 2015 UTC,There are major BL2 spoilers in the first minutes of TPS.
Borderlands,3a3pd7,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:14:52 2015 UTC,"BL2 is the overall better game I would say. Presequel is fun but not as good as 2. The humor isn't as good, the aussie characters are kinda just... meh."

Borderlands,3a3pd7,BWBHAMMER,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:44:53 2015 UTC,"BL2. It is devoid of Pickle. I didnt like TPS, but would have bought all the DLC for it if it meant getting to kill that obnoxious bastard."
Borderlands,3a3pd7,cannons_for_days,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"I like The Pre-Sequel more then BL2.  Its level scaling/progression is better (read: smoother), the skill trees for its characters are better designed, there are fewer encounter designs that drive me mad (there is still one that makes me gnash my teeth), and Cryo is a better mechanic than Slag.  However, the story is shorter (so you will get tired of content faster if you play through with multiple characters), there are fewer raid bosses, and there are 2 fewer ""real"" levels and no OP levels at all, so there is less progression.  Since those are the factors you listed as important, it's possible you would prefer BL2.  I say ""possible"" and not ""likely"" because Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode in BL2 is notoriously grindy.  Unless you grab an overpowered gear combo or use a cookie-cutter build, the exponential scaling combined with the ridiculous health multiplier in BL2 makes even run of the mill enemies just chew through bullets.  Both the multiplier and the exponential scaling were tuned down a touch in TPS to levels that imo creates a challenging experience without making mundane enemies feel like bullet sponges.  As such, even though there is less content to burn through in TPS, I enjoy going through that content much more than I do in BL2.  But your mileage may vary.  The BL2 GOTY is, like, $14 right now, and the second UVHM upgrade pack (the second level-cap extension) is another $2, so it's the entire 72(+8OP) level spread for just about half the price of just TPS without any of its DLC.  It is absolutely worth picking up at that price.  TPS is $30 + $20 for the 4 DLCs (cheaper individually than purchased as the season pass, for reasons I do not understand).  I also believe it is worth it at that price, but if you are unsure and could be convinced for $40 for the whole package, wait a bit - they will likely go back on flash-sale before the Steam summer sale ends."
Borderlands,3a24a3,Youraveragecow,6,Tue Jun 16 17:08:56 2015 UTC,Turn physx as low as possible. It's a common issue
Borderlands,3a24a3,skizzl3,2,Tue Jun 16 19:44:32 2015 UTC,Graphics card? Also turn of any AA and resolution a bit for quick fix

Borderlands,3a24a3,foxesareokiguess,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:24:32 2015 UTC,"many things could be at fault. Try optimizing the settings through your graphics card.

Borderlands,3a4p5a,StiffCrustySock,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:30:17 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the fastest way is generally considered to be constantly resetting and doing the first mission over and over again. Another option is to grind Guardian Hunter, l33t hax0rz and/or the Holodome badass round."

Borderlands,3a4p5a,cannons_for_days,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:54:52 2015 UTC,The rate at which you net xp from that single mission is faster than most of the game. The mob fights beforehand are also very short due to the weakened enemies.

Borderlands,3a2oxx,NexusNow,2,Tue Jun 16 21:25:47 2015 UTC,Wait option C sounds best when I think about it
Borderlands,3a2oxx,NexusNow,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:23:24 2015 UTC,Thanks.  It was my understanding that the DLC scaled but only to a max of 30 on playthrough 1.  I'll try with Moxxi tonight on playthrough 1 to see if that's the case.  That's why I'm leaning for option B.  They'll scale to my level and I don't need to get the best stuff since I'll move on to another game when I finish the DLC.
Borderlands,3a2oxx,musteatbrainz,2,Tue Jun 16 21:26:13 2015 UTC,"The level scaling in this game is borderline insane and prevents you from playing how you want to play. As a result, I would not recommend you skip the main game and go straight to DLC on PT2, as the starting levels are 42 for Zombie/Clapp and 51 for Knoxx. However, completing PT2 of the main game will cause scaling in Zombie/Clapp, and you'll finish at around level 52 or so, which lines up perfectly for Knoxx. So here's what I would recommend:  First, complete PT2 of the main game. It'll go faster than you expect, and you'll get some sweet loot along the way. Try to only complete story missions and only do side quests when you NEED to level up to get through a story mission.  Then Knoxx (PT2), Zombie (PT2), and Clap (PT2). Then you can go back and beat the side quests in the main game for that sweety, buttery loot. Also if you need some more XP before starting Knoxx, you can play some of Zombie/Clap to level up a bit. :)"
Borderlands,3a2oxx,musteatbrainz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:20:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining the levelling so perfectly.  It sounds like I'll be destroyed if I try Option B.  (And bored if I try option A.)  Okay, Option C it is then.  I'll probably put the game down for a month or so, that way the second playthrough will be fresh.  Being a packrat, hopefully I can get more Claptrap backpacks along the way.  I notice you suggested playing Knoxx first (because it is levelled correctly). Could I also play PT2 and when I hit level 42, play Zombie & Clapp?  Then finish the playthrough and play Knoxx?  That way I wouldn't be overlevelled for any of them.  Or is there some reason I might want to play Knoxx first?  What did you think of my idea to play Moxie in PT1?  I'm not that excited about the arena but saw that it had a ""bank"" to store stuff.  If the bank's stuff carries from PT1 to PT2 that would be nice to have."
Borderlands,3a2oxx,Daemmerung,2,Tue Jun 16 23:50:49 2015 UTC,"No problemo!    The problem with skipping Knoxx and instead doing Zombie/Clap immediately after finishing the main game (PT2) is that Knoxx won't scale until you complete Loot Larceny (a mission in Knoxx).  So if you complete Zombie/Clap first, you will be over-leveled by time you get to Knoxx.  Also, the story flows more smoothly by completing Knoxx first after the main game.  I'm not too sure about Moxxi.  My understanding is it's very hard to solo, but it does scale no matter you're level so it doesn't really matter when you do it.  It might be fun to try out before you begin PT2 main game."
Borderlands,3a2oxx,Swampfunk,2,Wed Jun 17 00:23:25 2015 UTC,"Miss Moxxi's Underdome is safe to play in the first playthrough, because you don't gain experience in there (other than by satisfying challenges).  Don't touch any of the other DLC until you complete the main game's second playthrough."
Borderlands,3a3fyg,IIBewm,3,Tue Jun 16 22:42:35 2015 UTC,"What kind of gear are you using with this build? It looks a little confused. First off optics is a nothing skill, headshot is by far the better option there. You should be able to land reliable headshots without a tiny bit extra zoom and slight damage wobble reduction (which is fairly negligible in this game anyway). Since you've largely specced into melee, i'm confused as to why you chose a bunch of gun skills. Like why go down the left side of cunning when you could combine say ambush with backstab for bigger damage bonus and extended deception? I'd say go for more coherence in your skills in general."
Borderlands,3a3fyg,_darkwingduck_,-1,Tue Jun 16 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"I'm going with my style of play I prefer sniping over melee but I only wanted b0re, on the left tree all I wanted was to extend my time in deception. I know its very confusing but its the way I play as Zer0. On the left tree I mostly went into gun enhancements over melee enhancements since I barely melee but I still needed it to be strong so I can still kill enemies in deception to keep it going."
Borderlands,3a3fyg,_darkwingduck_,3,Tue Jun 16 23:43:46 2015 UTC,"If you prefer sniping why not utilise sniping skills? Headshot, velocity, and to a lesser degree critical ascension will be making up a huge portion of your DPS as a sniper. Combining one shot one kill with killer is also a great way to maximise damage output.  Why even ask if its a good build if you're already happy with it/your style of play..."

Borderlands,3a1sx2,Axe_DinGo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:51:42 2015 UTC,"I probably have over 24 hours in farming that bastard, and have gotten one Bitch, and three Shams. I was using a corrosive Conference Call, and a Bee so it never took long to kill him, but those drop rates are ASS!"
Borderlands,3a1sx2,BWBHAMMER,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:38:10 2015 UTC,"The last time I farmed him (around level 61-62) I got two shams and a bitch.  I still use the bitch situationally (at 69), but one of the shams was 85% - only having a 15% chance to take damage while the shield is active combined with <3s recharge delay is ridiculous, so I only used it when I was having a rough time in an area."

Borderlands,3a1vrq,Imago90,5,Tue Jun 16 16:09:18 2015 UTC,"The rockets can be avoided.  It's difficult, because his launcher is usually high-velocity.  With careful use of cover you can even kill him from below his platform.  Homing grenades are helpful here.  Alternately, he's a lot easier to face if you get up the ramp and past his ""killing field"" before he emerges.  You only get one chance to do this, however: once you've died, your respawns will face him already in place.  Quit and resume the game, restarting at the entrance to the Bloodshot Stronghold, and rush the ramp this time."
Borderlands,3a1vrq,Daemmerung,3,Tue Jun 16 16:16:35 2015 UTC,"The other guy is correct, but you should also consider opening your game up to public. More people makes this fight considerably easier."
Borderlands,3a1vrq,FinalFate,2,Tue Jun 16 16:26:36 2015 UTC,"What's his level? I haven't played BL2 for a while but as I remember this part of the game, you seem underleveled."
Borderlands,3a1vrq,4got_my_password,2,Tue Jun 16 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"Here is a trick I learned. His rocket launcher will change each time you load the game. So if you get to him, and he has a fast rocket launcher quit and reload the game.   One of his versions has a slow rocket launcher. I mean fires one at a time, and the rockets are slow as all get out. Try that."
Borderlands,3a1vrq,confusedsquirrel,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:19:50 2015 UTC,You can also take him out with a sniper rifle. Don't enter his room. Stand in the left corner of the entrance after he has spawned. He will walk around. Watch for his feet on the muddle Walkway and snipe his legs. You will have to take out all the psychos first and at level 12 it will be a slow Grog.
Borderlands,3a1vrq,45sfCA,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"Sniping is best, but getting back up the ramp to get a good angle can be difficult. If you've managed to get a good incendiary weapon, that can help too. Just whittle him down between shots with the dot.  He is one of the reasons bloodshot ramparts is my least favorite area in the game. I understand the concept of health gating, and that some people have figured out how to exploit it to do ridiculous things, but for me any enemy that can oneshot me repeatedly (especially with just splash damage) is just not fun. This guy was horribly designed."

With the former I used DT as a distraction: that allowed me to get in a good position to kill him. With  the latter I just used phaselock and then killed him. I might suggest you to watch some psycho gameplays in order to see how people managed to get past this point. Also doing some side missions to level up might be a good idea."
Borderlands,3a1vrq,596Franky,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:20:02 2015 UTC,"He was definitely the least fun for me on krieg. What I did was to just spam the special grenade you get from owning one of the dlcs. If you don't have it, try spamming grenades.  Or buzz axe rampage and kill psychos to refill your health as you run, run past him and go to the top, from there shoot down + use grenades."
Borderlands,3a1vrq,DoopSlayer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"This has always worked for me:     At the top of the ramp from the whirlpool level, go straight ahead to the ladder to the top level. Then scramble right, on the ledge in the front of the tank, to the porta-john.   Then hide behind there and snipe guys from cover, but watch guys rushing you from the left (where Mike comes from). When Mike shows up, chuck two fire burst grenades at his feet before he ever starts shooting."

Borderlands,3a1vrq,Xergear,2,Tue Jun 16 20:46:41 2015 UTC,"Have to be next to him for that to work. Doesn't always happen with the dozen or so enemies you have to kill first (with guns, if you expect to be able to use buzz axe on the boss). Doing so in the doorway where he comes out of, which has zero cover and is wide open, is not always conducive to survivng.  Also, don't be a dick. No one cares about your boasting on the internet."
Borderlands,3a1l9i,oograh,11,Tue Jun 16 14:51:07 2015 UTC,"As long as you've gone through the main story of Borderlands 2, TPS won't spoil anything story wise.   The overarching story of TPS is good, but I never really had much of a desire to go back and run much after going through normal mode. I keep coming back to BL2, though. I think that is pretty much the way it goes for most people. So basically once you've gone through the main story, you're good to go in TPS."

Borderlands,39zekd,Ezemy,21,Tue Jun 16 03:00:14 2015 UTC,"That reminds me about my playthrough of BL1. I was playing as brick and I have had the same legendary revolver for the last 10 levels or so. It was an explosive revolver with regenerating ammo, so even as the levels went up and it's damage became less effective it would still be good because it had infinite ammo. Eventually though it was just too weak to make viable and I had to replace it. I wasn't happy about this, seriously I was taking to it saying how I was so sorry and that I'll always remember you etc. I equip my new revolver and go to the next area (I forgot the name, but it looks like a oil refinery in the middle of the desert.) When I get to the elevator to get into the main part of the area that has all the enemies I find a loot chest. I open the chest and sitting there was a legendary explosive revolver with regenerating ammo. I felt like crying at that moment because it was like my little revolver grew up just so he could stay with me."

Borderlands,39zekd,Svolur,4,Tue Jun 16 17:17:08 2015 UTC,"So, the drop rate for a single legendary in a BL1 chest is 1 out of 2,500,000 instances, so assuming the rate stays the same, that comes to:  2,500,0003= 15,625,000,000,000,000,000   Don't forget to multiply the 1x2x3x4, since there are indeed 4 slots in a chest.  And we get: 24/15,625,000,000,000,000,000  TL;DR Fuck you,math.  Edit: Math."
Borderlands,39zekd,FinalFate,13,Tue Jun 16 04:39:45 2015 UTC,Yeah that's wrong. BL1's chances are much higher than that.

Borderlands,39zekd,Daemmerung,3,Tue Jun 16 14:43:30 2015 UTC,Paul Helquist did an Inside the Box about the drop system in bl1 vs bl2. The chance that the game spawns a legendary is much higher than your estimate. On my phone or I'd link it for you.

Borderlands,39zekd,Gek_Lhar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:09:13 2015 UTC,"You have to take into account that the chest has 4 spots to spawn legendaries. So a 4/2,500,000 to start with. Then after the first spot is taken by the first legendary it drops to 3/2,500,000 and then one more time which makes it 2/2,500,000.   Then you multiply them together to get the overall chance for three legendaries in a four slot chest. The total is 24/15,625,000,000,000,000,000"
Borderlands,39zekd,cannedhamman,-5,Tue Jun 16 12:59:46 2015 UTC,"That's what I typed, isn't it?"
Borderlands,39zekd,Gek_Lhar,3,Tue Jun 16 13:03:23 2015 UTC,For the most part but you forgot to take into account the number of slots available in the chest. So the numerator should be 24 instead of 1.

Borderlands,39zekd,NeoZenith1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:01:11 2015 UTC,"Very possible because of how legs work in BL1. Legs in BL1 have legendary ""parts"". For example, there is a grip, stock, barrel, and body all assigned to the Hellfire. So if an SMG spawns with any of those parts, it automatically becomes a Hellfire. In BL2 and TPS, legendary parts are lock to the barrels only, this means that an SMG has to spawn with the ""Hellfire barrel"" in order for the game to consider it a Hellfire."
Borderlands,39zekd,benh141,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:19:45 2015 UTC,Borderlands 1 is pretty generous especially since damage doesn't scale exponentially so you can use these way later in the game. (especially that pistol)

Borderlands,3a0kln,NotRocketScieeence,5,Tue Jun 16 07:46:28 2015 UTC,"Shotgun Zer0 works excellently on UVHM.   If the SMG you are using is the Sandhawk then sorry, but that is not of interest, everyone is strong with the Sandhawk. I would suggest trying e-tech SMG weapons with B0re, large projectiles equal more chance of hitting the hit-box pixels."
Borderlands,3a0kln,lftmm,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:28:16 2015 UTC,"Most E-tech weapons can't bore, I'm not sure if SMGs fall in that category, but I'm almost positive they do"
Borderlands,3a0kln,_sLAUGHTER234,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:32:13 2015 UTC,"I would instead use - let me explain - The Tattler, it actually just barely beats out the Sandhawk in DPS if you're not using the Bee so grab one if you don't want to use Sandhawk. If you're not a fan of the Tattler's accuracy, then get a Bitch. Zer0 should be able to adequately compensate for the rather poor accuracy on the Tattler though"
Borderlands,3a0kln,30SecondsToFail,2,Wed Jun 17 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"I actually switched to a Shotgun/Sniper build on UVHM, just to try something new and I'm pretty happy with it. For the shotguns, I use the Twister, the Swordsplosion!!! and the Striker. The Twister, because it's obviously absolutely awesome, especially with b0re. The Striker is absolutely great to aim for criticals, because of it's high accuracy, and the Swordsplosion!!! is great if you group up enemies and just blast everyone at once away (but make sure you have the Casual prefix). I use the Legendary Sniper COM, because the skill bonuses are also very benefitial for Shotguns, so if you skill on sniping, you also skill really good for shotguns too. Alternatively you can use the Legendary Killer COM, works great too and gives you really decent critical hit bonus."
Borderlands,3a0kln,CriticalFaceTime,2,Tue Jun 16 11:47:52 2015 UTC,"So this is what I do, basically, although disclaimer:  I don't really set out to do it, it's just what kind of naturally happens.  I like playing as a sniper in most games, so I chose Zer0.  Get all the gun based character trait thingies like b0re and what not.  Then depending on the guns available to me at the time, I typically run with:  1 or 2 snipers: If it's two, then I like for something with high fire rate and low/mid zoom and one with a longer range and a critical bonus.  1 shotgun: one of the torgue ones that shoot like 14x pellets but only have 2 or 3 shots before reload.  I use this typically only in really close range, usually if I'm in FFYL and need to kill something quick.  1 or 2 SMGs, depending on if I have 2 SMGs that will be more useful than 2 snipers I currently have.  Typically go for something with shitloads of elemental damage and a high fire rate.  Like right now I'm level 41 on the second playthrough in BL2 and I use:  Hyperion sniper w/ slag - 6300 dmg  Torgue shotgun:  14x1400 dmg w/ 2 shot clip  Maliwan SMG: e-tech, 1919 dmg + fire damage (forget how much) and I think it's like 54% chance of elemental  Maliwan SMG: e-tech, 2100 dmg + corrosion (idk how much again) and same 54% chance of elemental  editted for formatting"

The only real good things it added was that it added 1 new weapon type, gave a new set of characters to play as, and gave you a little more maneuverability with the oz kits (I don't count cryo as a new element because it just took slag's spot and fire was nefred into oblivion.) It gave a bit of backstory to the characters in BL2 and it was a bit easier, but if you got bored of BL2 that quick you most likely aren't going to like Pre-Sequel."

Borderlands,39ynsp,Sparkaz,0,Tue Jun 16 02:17:17 2015 UTC,I would recommend using this.
Borderlands,39zogl,comeonguysstart,3,Tue Jun 16 02:18:09 2015 UTC,"Well the biggest issue with dot builds in BL2 is that they dont scale nearly as well as they did in the first one. Elemental damage no longer scales with level and each gun has its own capped Elemental damage so as you progress you may run into issues but its your game, play it how you want.   But the best DoT build for a first playthrough imo is Cataclysm Maya. The Ruin ability at the end is very powerful as it, combined with a couple of other skills in the tree can apply every element simultaneously, now this wont kill by itself but it makes it significantly easier to do so,"
Borderlands,39zogl,AddictionFiction,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:34:23 2015 UTC,"Cataclysm Maya is still viable on UVHM, if not much use for raid bosses. No, it's not as supremely damage-dealing or survivable as Sal with a DPUH and a Grog Nozzle (or, god help us all, a pair of Norfleets), but with the right gear you'll still shred anything you come across. I run a build that more or less looks like this, with a Legendary Cat COM and the near-required Sandhawk and Pimpernel combination with The Bee.   Basically, your key skills are Wreck, Ruin, Life Tap and Reaper. Ruin...the attraction of Ruin is obvious. With a good proficiency relic (or better, a Bone of the Ancients for the elemental damage bonus), every eight seconds or so you can take an enemy out of the fight while simultaneously applying slag, shock and corrosion. Wreck is simple: higher fire rate = more DPS. Life Tap lets you regenerate massive amounts of health (a couple shots on OP3 will refill me completely) as long as you're killing. Reaper is just a straight damage bonus, nothing complicated there.  As for gear? You'll obviously want to tailor what you're using to what you're killing. Early on when you're dealing with assorted bandits and wildlife, a Hellfire does some beautiful work (I lucked into a Sawbar from the chest after killing Flynt and used it right on up until the Highlands). Endgame, you'll want the Bee-Sandhawk-Pimpernel combo I mentioned above, because a corrosive Pimpernel will often oneshot loaders and melt anything armored. The Sandhawk with the Bee's amp damage and the 9X% bonus from the Legendary Cat mod will destroy anything you hit up close."
Borderlands,39zogl,FrozenSeas,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:43:15 2015 UTC,"Nothing is exactly like the old characters, but Maya has many skills that mimic Lilith's. However; I've heard that they lose most of their effectiveness as you gain more and more levels, so I can't really say it's a good idea to use her if you want to take her to max level. The two DLC characters have trees that specialize in a certain element (Gaige has shock, Krieg has fire), so they would be a good choice as well, but their other trees sort of overshadow them in the late game. Gaige gets the anarchy tree that gives her insane damage buffs and Krieg gets mania which basically makes you immortal if you time the skill usage right. You can use any of these three to have a decent element based DoT build which work great in the beginning, but eventually you may have to switch styles just because the other trees will be more effective as time goes on."
Borderlands,39zogl,Muffinofrage,2,Tue Jun 16 02:50:07 2015 UTC,Krieg's DoT damage can actually help him because it can heal him properly and essentially makes him invincible if you apply enough DoTs
Borderlands,39zogl,30SecondsToFail,2,Wed Jun 17 01:18:38 2015 UTC,"If you are fighting one huge enemy the DoT tree can only get one stack of heals, but Release the Beast is always an insta heal so long as you can time it right. All his trees work well, but I just prefer mania/bloodlust because between the three heals and the massive damage reduction in BAR I've never died since respecing. I'd like to try Hellborn/Bloodlust because of the glory that is bloodbath with vladof grenades but I just don't feel like hunting for new gear."
Borderlands,39zogl,Muffinofrage,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:10:03 2015 UTC,It still can heal him significantly in OP8 because DoT damage scales but health doesn't. pair this with the Heartbreaker or a Kitten and health regen stops being a problem

Borderlands,39zogl,Muffinofrage,0,Tue Jun 16 02:52:08 2015 UTC,Step 1. Don't do a DoT build
Borderlands,39x5yx,kwprules,11,Mon Jun 15 15:04:07 2015 UTC,"I really like this shotgun!  As a whole, it can deal a lot of raw damage at close range! Getting multiple critical hits and watching enemies gib in blood clouds is very satisfying.  In BL2, when I got one of these weapons, I used it on Gaige and Sal, but this was Normal/TVHM.  I've found a lot of usefulness for this weapon while leveling Nisha in The Pre-Sequel, especially a ""Deputy Nisha"" with a High-Rolling Crapshooter mod since her skills can increase the magazine size, Showdown can make it easier to hit targets at mid range, or critical spots at close/mid-range, and Tombstone causes all pellets to crit after it's activated.  I think it's not really ideal for endgame UVHM mods based on the new level cap increases, etc. I also would love to hear people weigh in on the Striker vs. the Flayer  I also passed it down to my Doppleganger/Jack, who found a lot of utility and help leveling with it with a Deputy Jack build.  I think the ideal prefix is usually Rustlers unless you need a modification for the magazine size for a specific build. Jakobs grip, Hyperion stock."
Borderlands,39x5yx,thewalex,2,Mon Jun 15 15:17:08 2015 UTC,Doc's is actually my favourite since it pumps its already insane crit even higher
Borderlands,39x5yx,30SecondsToFail,8,Wed Jun 17 01:13:39 2015 UTC,"In the past I didn't cared so much for the Striker, because a common purple Quad could outperform it easy in damage. But now I actually farmed it for my Zer0, because of it's amazing precision. You can score easy critical hits, even from some distance and a character like Zer0 with his crazy crit buffs can make really good use out of it."
Borderlands,39x5yx,CriticalFaceTime,3,Mon Jun 15 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"The Striker is an interesting gun - instead of going for the raw POWER that Jakobs is known for, their legendary shotgun is focused entirely on precision. With a magazine size ranging from 2-5, it can be shot fairly frequently - especially given its light construction making it quick to reload.  The gun, however, lacking the raw blasting power of a Quad or the sheer precision damage potential of an Orphan Maker, has found itself by the wayside. Its low pellet count combined with average damage for a legendary shotgun is not sufficiently enchanced by its inherent critical hit buffs. Were it a double- or triple-barreled gun, it might see more usage, but for now the only way it sees high-level play is through the deputy Salvador build with which the Striker can become the ultimate distance weapon - as its Borderlands 1 version boasts, ""Sniper rifles are for chumps."""
Borderlands,39x5yx,ScootaLewis,5,Mon Jun 15 15:09:40 2015 UTC,"The Striker is a shotgun that is meant for mid to long range. However, I'd say that the Conference Call surpasses it in BL2 as that is capable of higher DPS than the Striker.  As for parts, Jakobs grip for extra damage and manufacturer bonus and Hyperion stock for recoil reduction are the way to go along with the vertical grip accessory to increase its damage output.  All in all, the Striker is a decent shotgun. It just lacks the stopping power like the Quad or even Orphan Maker but it's better than those at range. However at range, I prefer to use a Conference Call or Interfacer. The Striker is a decent stand in until you get those shotguns though."
Borderlands,39x5yx,lurklar,3,Mon Jun 15 17:01:41 2015 UTC,"It definitely caters to a specific playstyle. Damage is good, crit bonus is very good, and the accuracy gives it some ranged capability. The issue is that Hyperion shotguns beat it on Accuracy and the Damage can be bested by any number of shotguns with more pellets or explosives. It's also not available with elements, which can hurt it's utility a little. Zer0 especially will appreciate the bonus crit on top of his skills, along with enough accuracy to use it at longer ranges. Maya can probably use it to score strong crits in phaselock, but that's true of a lot of weapons. Sal might like it as a longer range option. Jakobs grip and Hyperion Stock (stock choice goes for all shotguns) are the best base parts. Foregrip (Rustler's prefix) is generally always the best choice for a shotgun, but the General Boost (well kept) isn't a bad choice either. Sight to your choosing. Usually I'd say Torgue, but with the longer range capabilities, any of them should work well. Slappy is easy to get to, but like all Threshers, it's a pain to kill. I'd say it's ease of access means that if you want one, and have the gear to survive, then you might as well."
Borderlands,39x5yx,meh_mediocre,3,Mon Jun 15 17:39:09 2015 UTC,"I was kind of underwhelmed by the Striker in BL2.  It's not terrible by any means, but it deals less damage than a good Coach Gun.  (Its slightly more damage on a crit, but it's not huge.)  Its accuracy serves Gaige poorly, its clip size is almost perfectly wrong for Salvador, and Jakobs weapons are just sort of poor for Maya in the first place.  It's a good ranged weapon for some Krieg builds, but most versions of Krieg would prefer a Torgue shotgun.  It is, however, fantastic for Nisha because she gets bonuses for crits that are not simply +crit damage, and scoring crits is why you want a Striker.  Thumbs down in BL2 - Old Slappy is sort of a pain to fight in higher levels and the Striker isn't a huge upgrade from an appropriate Jakbos shotgun.  Thumbs up for Nisha in TPS - it enables lots of her skills, and she rewards crits hugely."
Borderlands,39x5yx,cannons_for_days,2,Mon Jun 15 21:44:14 2015 UTC,Decent shotgun overall but didn't work with my particular Salvador style. Sure it has good range but I had a nice Quad that could put out more damage faster. Plus I wasn't getting the full benefit of the Money Shot.   I think if I played from a greater distance then this would work just fine
Borderlands,39x5yx,VeryEasilyAmused,2,Mon Jun 15 17:17:06 2015 UTC,"Have 3 of them.  Doc's, Rustler, and Barbed.  Can't get other oranges to fall but I can get Strikers all day long.

Borderlands,39x5yx,k8ph85,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:26:06 2015 UTC,"All three are good in their appropriate context (not that Axton is really set up for melee).  Keep the one with a matching grip, I'd say."

The Barbed striker has the biggest magazine though.

Sure, there are some really useless ones on there (Meat Unicycle and Healbot make me want to bang my head against a wall when I get them, which is fortunately not often).   But even ones like Clap in the Box have their uses. Clap in the Box has helped me out of lots of scrapes. Torgue Fiesta is my fave one behind Pirate Ship Mode for all the uses it has. Gun Wizard and Rubber Ducky are magnificent as well! .   I get what youre saying though. My fiance (who plays an Athena) will tell you that it takes some patience to play with Clappy at first. We got nuked by Torgue Fiesta A LOT when I got it because of a lucky early level bonus package and the fact that it would pop up all the fucking time, but we figured out how to  play smarter and we practically never die anymore."

Borderlands (2) is a game that requires investment. It will start to feel like a unique gun-play experience when you hit about level 30, and reach your first skill tree capstone. Additionally, you will have more fun when you find better, more unique, and more satisfying guns and equipment.   Multiplayer adds depth as well.  Finally, I found that the game was devoid of any real difficulty until UVHM, and wasn't properly balanced until OP8.  If you don't care for the levelling experience, use Gibbed or download a save to get right into OP8 and play from there. I enjoy OP8 for its challenge and the ability to customize my character and find/create unique builds using balanced gear."

Borderlands,39u1j7,Isomniac,31,Sun Jun 14 19:43:44 2015 UTC,The leech is one of my favorite grenade modes. IIRC it deals a lot of elemental damage and returns most of the damage done to you as health. Before uvhm I had a level 50 zero with a level 50 corrosive leech. Anytime my health got low I would throw one and practically be instantly healed. I used that grenade half through uvhm too. But then it's damage just wasn't enough. The elemental DOT is really good on them.
Borderlands,39u1j7,chazual88,22,Sun Jun 14 20:37:29 2015 UTC,"Leech instantly heals you for damage done, also AFAIK, that's the damage/healing done per child grenade."

Borderlands,39vwrp,ticklemepeace,3,Mon Jun 15 06:16:03 2015 UTC,"Find someone to play with. It makes a big difference. Grab a Moxxi weapon as soon as you can. The Rubi from the mission Rakkaholic's Anonymous is a good option if you haven't done that quest in TVHM (turn it in to Moxxi). The damage on it doesn't matter. Pull it out and chuck a grenade when you get low, it'll heal you to full.  Slag is your friend. It's basically necessary for Maya in UVHM without the Bee. The last skill in the Ruin tree will also let you slag anything easily. I recommend something like this. Finally, don't get discouraged. UVHM will get easier as you level up. The first five or six levels are the hardest."
Borderlands,39vwrp,FinalFate,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:11:29 2015 UTC,"This . Esp the part about uVHM getting easier as you level.  What i did was farm for the Harold early on around level 55 and the bee.  Those two lasted me til around level 60 , which is when UvHM starts to even out."

Get ""Ruin"" skill at the bottom, then put as many points into Motion tree to make the cooldown and duration times extend/reduce. Ruin will slag anything you phaselock, thus making it possible to kill. UVHM is so insanely dependent on slag that with this skill, the Siren can usually solo it easy."
Borderlands,39vwrp,Grandcateran9,3,Mon Jun 15 08:25:22 2015 UTC,"The weapon levels are pretty key. In UVHM its important to stay within at most 3 mob levels.

Borderlands,39vwrp,jayen,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:52:31 2015 UTC,"Hey man, just spec into the right tree, especially in Ruin, because this will slag pretty much every enemy nearby and once they are slagged, the don't feel so bullet spongy anymore. I would also maybe go back into TVHM to farm for some good legendaries before starting UVHM.   When I first started UVHM I had the same problem and kept dying all the time, but after some time you'll get used to it and it won't feel difficult anymore."

Borderlands,39vwrp,_darkwingduck_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:27:18 2015 UTC,"All the legendaries in the game make UVHM easier and easier, but the one thing that makes it possible is slag.  You must slag.  Everything.  From the Ultimate Badasses down to the spiderants or spiderlings.  You will be able to kill some common mobs without slag, but you'll wind up blowing through ammo (yea, it's everywhere but who really wants to stop to open 400 ammo chests?).  If you have Tiny Tina's DLC, go back to TVHM and farm for a magic missile grenade mod (I believe you get them from sorcerers in Hatred's Shadow, but just google the best spots).  I play as Axton and am at level 69 now and I still use the level 45 MM mod that I got in my TVHM playthrough - I haven't used any other mod.  AoE slag, homing, regenerates grenade ammo; you can slag everything from behind cover and then pop out and kill everything.  I know you can get the phaselock to slag (haven't played as a siren), so I don't know if the above is absolutely necessary for you - but it will help immensely (especially with the dying since you can slag without exposing yourself, ensuring when you start killing your bee is fully charged).  That was my experience soloing BL2."

I wouldn't mind having some sort of alternative though, preferably something with a steady recharge rather than a dependency to gather tanks and stand on geysers until it's full. Also hopefully it'd be more interesting than the Pre-Sequel's lazy recoloring the same model rather than giving each a different look. Like Maliwan will give off elemental trails as it goes around, or a Torgue pack would just be a missile that does a small explosion upon takeoff, or maybe there is a bandit pack that's just a bunch of guns welded together and you fly around propelled by recoil."

Borderlands,39sf7z,Delameko,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:44:49 2015 UTC,I'm fine with lower drop rates if I can farm for specific legendary gear. As it is in Diablo 3 if  I have 4 of 5 pieces of a set there's nothing I can do. Also they have issues with item balance (Ring of Royal Grandeur is needed for too many builds).  The legendary drop rate is also hard to compare due to the number of useless legendary gear in Diablo.

Borderlands,39sf7z,Delameko,5,Sun Jun 14 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"I think it was probably because I played through the story on BL2 twelve times, it would've been nice for some variation when trying out different characters.  They don't necessarily need to be completely different.  Imagine the start of TPS but you start in different parts of the station depending what character you're playing, then in co-op you'd all be working your way towards each other, probably meeting up just before the first boss battle.  Something like that.  And unique jokes/interactions."
Borderlands,39sf7z,ArtifexQ,2,Sun Jun 14 21:41:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I'd still be playing through it by myself. Maybe if they did it so that the openings interact. Like I push this button and a door opens for you."

Just to dick around one of them decided to create something i affectionately termed the Norfinity. Absolutely hilarious to watch Norfleet shots coming from a pistol at 14 x 3 rounds per second. There was also the duodecuple penetrating unkempt herald. We wont be using them for any game progression, but they are pretty damn entertaining."

Borderlands,39sf7z,Mattpoppybros,19,Sun Jun 14 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe a combination? Your proficiencies are in aspects of shooting. Different guns effect different aspects. For example, snipers increase accuracy of all guns, rifles increase recoil control, pistols increase reload speed, smgs increase fire rate, shotguns increase damage and elemental weapons increase effect damage and chance.  Obviously every weapon would have to increase more than one stat, but those listed could be the primary stat each weapon effects.

Borderlands,39sf7z,Venusaurus_Rex,10,Sun Jun 14 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I dislike the idea of breaking apart guns.  The furthest they should go is making weapon parts drop, and then you can mix-and-match to get your preferred gun.   The issue with that is you may lose some of the magic of unique/crazy guns (for example), but that won't stop them from allowing guns to drop whole or to do something equivalent to armor set bonuses for guns."
Borderlands,39sf7z,noydbshield,4,Sun Jun 14 17:06:35 2015 UTC,Yep. Building guns just means someone would figure out the absolute optimum parts for the 'perfect gun' and anythong else would be considered junk. I enjoyed trying different weapons out because they just happened to drop.

When you can shoot shoot shoot reload shoot shoot shoot some more, the fancy lightning guns and their slow charging batteries just didn't hold up. The thunderstorm always held a special place in my heart though. Even if it didn't have the longevity, the thing was beastly.   I did love that mod though. I believe it was a Support Gunner.

Better crafted characters (both playable and non-playable) --> playable characters with different play styles to choose from (eg zer0), playable characters with interesting and risky skills (eg gaige's anarchy), ridiculously lovable NPCs like tiny tina, torgue and claptrap Better legendaries with better abilities --> because some of the current legendaries are ridiculously stupid. At least give us some legendaries that make people REALLY REALLY REALLY WANT to grind for legendaries.  New mechanics --> I was thinking maybe there could be a grinder that takes one feature from each gun and combines it into a new gun, instead of just throwing out a random one like the one in pre-sequel. Or anything interesting, really. I want to see something new.

Borderlands,39sf7z,AfuckingA,2,Wed Jun 17 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"While I like this idea, and would love for it to exist in the BL universe, two specific downsides come to mind.    A game like this (post apocalyptic world, lots of guns, pretty unique character building/customization, and an actual immersion experience where your choices change everything) already exists. It's Fallout. I would probably like the Fallout games more if they took place in a more BL-esque universe, but gearbox doesn't really like to take a copy/paste approach to their games. That's what makes the BL games so awesome. Which leads me to the other downside to that... As I said before, if it could be implimented in a way that wasn't a carbon copy of Fallout, I'd be all for it, but there's something were forgetting about the BL gaming experience. It has ALWAYS been about going through one specific story in a unique way that made you feel like you weren't playing the exact same game over and over again (different characters, abilities and an almost infinite arsenal to choose from). Even with the ""choices"" given to you in Tales From The Borderlands, you're still following one basic story, you're just getting to the end of it a little bit differently than somebody else.

As each one dies, it is replaced by another or if you're ranked high enough you can summon more at a time.

Having to playthrough the story like three times, legendaries never dropping, absurd numbers on everything that didn't even matter because you were barely chipping away at everything's HP anyway if it wasn't regenerating faster than your DPS, getting one-shotted to near death so often your own shields and health didn't feel like they mattered at all. I don't know how they managed to get so much more into the game but feel so much more boring... I haven't bothered with the pre-sequel, I probably won't be buying BL3 if it comes out either.

With only less than 10000 health a moxxi heartbreaker can heal you consistently and health gate mechanic will keep you alive. The fight will be long but safe.

Your main hand weapon will get the crit bonus when it's out (same way you get a healing bonus from the grog being in the offhand).  What you can do for reliable damage buffs is zerk with DPUH mainhand grog offhand and SWITCH offhand to Lady Fist (preferably slag but not important) to coincide with your money shots, then switch back to grog when the chain ends.  Due to the Harold's spread it often scores crits without too much precision on the aim, and the 800% buff is ridiculous.  Neat little trick to have up your sleeve, recommend trying it out."

Those two statements do not jive with each other.  Low-level Krieg is arguably the most squishy of the 6 vault hunters.  His healing is completely tied into his action skill, and it is also the only movement speed boost he gets, so he is very vulnerable when his action skill isn't up in the early levels.  Two of his three trees are poor damage trees below level 31, and the third is only truly great while you are on fire.  Now, Release the Beast changes all of that, and once you've got enough skill points to really invest in the Bloodlust tree, you can get some pretty sweet chain reactions going.

Borderlands,39vm6z,brandpanz,2,Mon Jun 15 05:40:00 2015 UTC,"Axton is widely considered the worst character. Krieg is weaker than most until he hits a capstone skill at which point he becomes really, really good. Release the Beast alone makes Krieg incredibly strong.

Borderlands,39vm6z,ScootaLewis,2,Mon Jun 15 12:19:08 2015 UTC,Axton is widely considered the worst character   Lowest gun damage != worst character
Borderlands,39vm6z,brandpanz,2,Mon Jun 15 12:24:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't say anything about gun damage. Axton has the least potential for crazy damage out of any vault hunter, except maybe for maya - and maya has a better role as team healer, which she excels at."
Borderlands,39vm6z,ScootaLewis,3,Mon Jun 15 12:43:57 2015 UTC,"Except that he doesn't really need crazy damage most of the time except for raids and Peak bosses, and he has grenades/Tediore to take care of that.

Borderlands,39vm6z,CtrlAltDefeated,3,Mon Jun 15 13:08:40 2015 UTC,"Mobbing is subjective since everyone has their own playstyle. If you're going by mobbing and crowd control utility though then Sal's actually the worst. He has no aggro draw abilities like Axton and Zer0 nor does he have Maya and Krieg's crowd control. Defense-wise he's also the most gear-dependent: while Brawn's health regen isn't bad, it's just not enough to fit Sal's in your face fighting style by endgame, hence why everyone uses Moxxi.  Sure, Axton's the worst if you simplify the game like you did, but there's so much more to the game that your assessment isn't really that fair. Ever wanted to mob with only grenades, or facetank with a Bee, or flat out ignore death?"
Borderlands,39vm6z,brandpanz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:24:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure about Sal's poor CC and aggro draw you're naming. Late game mobbing is peanuts with singularity nades (since he throws two of them, it's actually damn strong crowd control). He can use singularity grenades since he doesn't need a lifesteal effect - a Grog nozzle fixes that problem. He also has a few other abusable bugs (like the nukem/pimp) that allow him to to raid or mob anything.   Since his healing rates are off the charts, he doesn't rely on a decoy taking aggro for him. Because of all those factors combined, I'd consider Sal to just be the best overall character in the game. ""OP"", if you will. I also find him the least interesting personally, because of the ""fire and forget"" his skill offers.  Axton, while initially tanky, doesn't have insane sustain. An explosive build late-game can definitely be devastating, but it doesn't make him the best imo. Every character is viable in OP8."
Borderlands,39vm6z,cannons_for_days,2,Mon Jun 15 18:06:06 2015 UTC,"Anyone can CC with singularities, it's not a Sal thing at all. (besides, you know who can do singularity better? Maya, and she only needs to spend 11 skill points for that) Sal himself, however, has no skills that allow him to do that, save for Come At Me Bro (sort of), which nobody takes. Everyone else has skills, but Sal needs extra gear. Ditto with defense: sure he can heal easily, but he's reliant on gear for that.  Even so, sometimes you just take so much damage that you end up going in FFYL, and you might have been better off simply not having taken that damage at all. Hence why turret, Phaselock, decoy etc. are helpful.  Bugs don't make a character good imo. Doesn't make them bad either, but they shouldn't count as part of a character's strengths.   Axton, while initially tanky, doesn't have insane sustain.   I don't think you've seen 11/5 Grit in action. It's the best defensive skill in the game, and it's up there with Money Shot, B0re etc. in terms of overpowered skills.  I wouldn't say Axton's the best: in fact, nobody's the best. Everyone's equally viable, it's the playstyles that separates them."
Borderlands,39vm6z,ScootaLewis,2,Mon Jun 15 18:27:03 2015 UTC,"So, Krieg can totally handle this mission - go grab a corrosive weapon (preferably an assault rifle or a shotgun) and just aim for the cargo crates.  Gear that is at or very near your level and appropriate to the task at hand is more important than using blue, purple, or orange gear. But if you find this mission frustrating, you're going to absolutely loathe the next one.  That being said, if you're playing the game on Normal mode (which would be my guess) it is possible for you to out-level this content, if you want to clear it that way.  Go finish the story campaign (it's the mission whose icon in your mission list is the vault symbol) and then go do one of the other DLCs.  Come back when you're level 32 or so with gear to match and you should be able to shoot down the buzzards without a whole lot of trouble.  (The content in this DLC will scale up with your level up to level 30.  Beyond that point, just being a higher level makes them deal less damage to you, in addition to having more health, so they aren't as lethal.)"
Borderlands,39vm6z,Ulfric_Stormtoke,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:46:41 2015 UTC,"If there are any ground-based enemies, try using a tesla grenade to stack bloodlust then kill them with a rocket launcher to proc Blood Bath. Then you should be able to blast away with a corrosive gun at the buzzards.  Also, you don't need to destroy all the cargo buzzards - just get as many as you can to drop the items you want and grab those, THEN focus on taking out the escorts.  And as has been mentioned before, any character can solo the game."
Borderlands,39vm6z,night54,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:17:30 2015 UTC,"Dude, its only a side mission, you don't even need it to finish the game.  If you want to do it, a corrosive shotgun is best."

Borderlands,39unwp,IIBewm,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:53:46 2015 UTC,"a slag rubi, rapier, and flame of the friehawk shield will carry you pretty far as a melee krieg as the item levels matter a bit less.

Borderlands,39unwp,Alekseeef,0,Thu Jun 18 05:36:08 2015 UTC,I'd recommend just grabbing a couple of pieces of gear before heading to UVHM. You'll outlevel them reasonably quickly so not worth spending forever farming. Also as Kreig you can fall back on melee reliably anyway.

Borderlands,39qj8c,caesar_primus,8,Sat Jun 13 23:35:04 2015 UTC,"Not every game has to have an elaborate story. I much preferred BL1 over 2 mostly because the first game was much more atmospheric. The planet actually felt like a wasteland, and a cohesive world, whereas the second game felt like a theme park of vibrant environments stitched together.  There wasn't constant dialogue with lame butt jokes and low brow humor, you were able to just drive around and experience the game.  Plus, the weapons that you get in the first game actually felt like you were rewarded for playing the game and getting good drops, and those weapons lasted much longer. In the second game, you had to hope for a specific manufacturer, because they are all so gimmicky that only a few manufacturer's weapons are worth using, and even once you got a good weapon, it would only last a few levels."
Borderlands,39qj8c,a_posh_trophy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:46:47 2015 UTC,You could start 2 before 1. The main references are that some bigger characters were from 1 such as the vault hunters in 1.
Borderlands,39qj8c,ScootaLewis,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:23:39 2015 UTC,Not necessary to get 1.   2 stands alone well enough that I've only ever played 2 and have found no reason to even try and look into 1 for any backstory or connections to the current games/DLC.

Borderlands,39r1q0,IsaacJDean,3,Sat Jun 13 23:00:23 2015 UTC,Mercenary Day has an interesting boss fight followed with what I think it's the best chest in the game.

The heads in most of them are pretty lackluster, the skins are honestly really dope. If you are just interested in gearing up I would say the best two are the Xmas and Halloween ones. The Halloween one has a decent spot for tubby farming and the xmas one has some pretty simple chests you can farm. If you can I suggest getting all of them as the boss fights and the skins are worth it imho."

Borderlands,39r1q0,Brick50,2,Sun Jun 14 20:10:17 2015 UTC,For the sales price they're worth it (bought them in the holidays' steam sale). Each pack is about 1 hour long but they are fun fun. I like the fact that your character has some dialogues during certain missions.  Like the other DLCs it's recommended you play them after completing the story missions.
Borderlands,39r1q0,lodf,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:35:01 2015 UTC,There cheap and add some nice flavour to an already awesome game. I would recommend it.
Borderlands,39r1q0,hollander93,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:19:59 2015 UTC,"They are basically 2 missions (one big one small,) with a head, and usually some hidden extra bit around the map(valentines has a fishing for threshers thing, Halloween has a hidden boss after doing some stuff, etc.). The torque one has a raid boss instead of a second mission. THey also have a nice bit of story in them and you get to hear the characters you play respond to the story, so all in all They are worth the money."

Borderlands,39ryrj,teddychan2dot0,2,Sun Jun 14 13:08:19 2015 UTC,Were you in any way related to the double that the vault hunters killed in Opportunity
Borderlands,39ryrj,puloko,-1,Sun Jun 14 15:44:51 2015 UTC,No actually in no way am I related to the Double in Opportunity because that was actually a engineer using a disguise of sorts.

I started far Cry 4 and never finished it ... I think Borderlands is a very unique kind of game. I can only hope to stay hooked as long as possible ;)
Borderlands,39ptt0,HanzsKlopek,10,Sat Jun 13 17:10:53 2015 UTC,Other than that you may want to have a look at STALKER (if you play on PC) and maybe Fallout 3 and New Vegas ...
Borderlands,39ptt0,HanzsKlopek,7,Sat Jun 13 17:12:41 2015 UTC,Fallout 3 and the Halo games were the only ones I 100%'d on Xbox before joining the pc master race. The fallout games are just so awesome.
Borderlands,39ptt0,CloseEnough11,5,Sat Jun 13 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"If you're still into Halo there was a new f2p Halo game based off of Halo 3 released for PC. The official version is trash (microtransactions, EU locked) except an awesome team created the ElDewrito mod and are basically remaking Halo 3 for PC. Check it out at /r/HaloOnline"
Borderlands,39ptt0,AmericanFromAsia,4,Sun Jun 14 00:03:33 2015 UTC,I thought far cry 4 was pretty good but I'd still say 3 was the best far cry game. Just the world was great and the story was amazing.
Borderlands,39ptt0,buttsalt14,25,Sat Jun 13 21:00:43 2015 UTC,Fallout New Vegas is pretty great.  It has the wasteland elements.  My only suggestion if you get fallout new vegas is to get a mod that periodically saves for you.
Borderlands,39ptt0,EbilMaster,7,Sat Jun 13 17:22:05 2015 UTC,"a mod that saves for you   Is this a thing? This would help me so much. To add onto this, Realistic Damage and Spice of Live are both great mods."

Borderlands,39ptt0,TheSpiffySpaceman,10,Sun Jun 14 14:41:17 2015 UTC,What is a non twitch shooter ?
Borderlands,39ptt0,Dookie_boy,16,Sat Jun 13 16:23:14 2015 UTC,"I guess a shooter with RPG elements, where there is more to the game than kill/death ratios."
Borderlands,39ptt0,WallOfPeanuts,22,Sat Jun 13 16:28:09 2015 UTC,Could also be more story driven games like Bioshock and Metro that aren't all about being quicker than your opponent
Borderlands,39ptt0,VindictiveRakk,8,Sat Jun 13 16:51:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I interpret a twitch shooter to be a game that relies primarily on skill and reaction time. Borderlands, on the other hand, relies more on your guns, builds, and how you use them."
Borderlands,39ptt0,IAmTriscuit,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:58:28 2015 UTC,Skill and reaction time very often dont  go hand in hand. Call of Duty proves that.
Borderlands,39ptt0,VindictiveRakk,3,Sat Jun 13 21:49:04 2015 UTC,I disagree. You'd be surprised how much accuracy matters in Call of Duty. It's the difference between getting a triple kill into a massive killstreak vs. getting one kill and being gunned down.
Borderlands,39ptt0,IAmTriscuit,3,Sat Jun 13 22:44:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but when it comes to using a mouse/stick and keeping it on a person's body and head vs. Using abilities, the terrain, jumping, ducking, and teamwork, I'll always consider the latter as requiring more skill and more impressive. COD is severely lacking in a lot of those."
Borderlands,39ptt0,VindictiveRakk,2,Sat Jun 13 23:20:15 2015 UTC,"I would say COD requires a lot of skill in using terrain, jumping, ducking, and even abilities if you count grenades and killstreaks. Theoretically, it should also require teamwork, but I'm not going to sit here and pretend that there's any of that going on in 99% of COD games haha."
Borderlands,39ptt0,buttsalt14,2,Sun Jun 14 00:22:17 2015 UTC,So a twitch game would be something with like a player vs player type mode?
Borderlands,39ptt0,Supahvaporeon,3,Sat Jun 13 21:02:06 2015 UTC,"/u/IAmTriscuit made this distinction:   when it comes to using a mouse/stick and keeping it on a person's body and head vs. Using abilities, the terrain, jumping, ducking, and teamwork   So I'm loosely calling a twitch shooter the former, and a non-twitch shooter the latter."

Borderlands,39ptt0,roby6907,8,Sat Jun 13 18:41:22 2015 UTC,"Dead Island is similar to Borderlands but it is much more focused on melee weapons. The loot system is similar and there are classes and similar skill trees. Each class also has an action skill like in Borderlands. It's definitely not as polished as Borderlands, but it's still pretty fun."
Borderlands,39ptt0,Hedonistic_Ent,8,Sat Jun 13 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"I tried playing that game last summer and I just couldn't do it after a while. The characters are boring, the combat is repetitive, and the enemies are all pretty much the same. I heard it was a lot like borderlands so maybe I set the bar a little high, but it still was just disappointing to me"
Borderlands,39ptt0,roby6907,4,Sat Jun 13 18:07:57 2015 UTC,The problem with dead island is that it was so boring. I wanted to keep playing and beat the game but couldnt just cause it was so boring.
Borderlands,39ptt0,TheSpiffySpaceman,3,Sat Jun 13 19:16:50 2015 UTC,I 100% agree. I just realized after 8 hours or so that it wasn't fun. I was in the city or whatever and I saw I had a side mission to pick up pretty far away and dreaded going to get it. Put it down and haven't even thought about playing it again since.

Borderlands,39ptt0,Gronzlo,7,Sun Jun 14 00:01:47 2015 UTC,Fallout for sure. Guaranteed to like it if you enjoy Borderlands.
Borderlands,39ptt0,TheBigBadCulDeSac,6,Sat Jun 13 18:18:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be so sure personally
Borderlands,39ptt0,1976dave,7,Sat Jun 13 18:57:31 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's not a guarantee, but honestly there's lots of similarities.   -Lots of guns and gear to find, although it's mostly through searching, not farming  -Fucking hilarious humour, but not as overt or widespread  -Excellent storytelling"
Borderlands,39ptt0,heyburrito,3,Sat Jun 13 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah it definitely shares a similar vibe, but I had a really hard time getting into it. I come from a shooter background, not an RPG background."
Borderlands,39ptt0,maxvedwards,3,Sat Jun 13 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"Ahh yeah, that would certainly be a hurdle. Fallout is not shooter focused, although I sometimes wish it was. If they kept everything else and made the combat more intense, I would play nothing else."
Borderlands,39ptt0,stewmberto,2,Sat Jun 13 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Same. Good distinction. I also come from a shooter background, so the rpg elements in borderlands is about perfect for me."

Borderlands,39ptt0,AmericanFromAsia,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:18:05 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I can't really get into Fallout 3 or NV as often as I've tried.  The shooting mechanics are awkward without VATS and with VATS it takes all the fun out of it, imho"
Borderlands,39ptt0,AmericanFromAsia,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"For sure, that's my gripe with the game. Combat isn't very engaging."
Borderlands,39ptt0,reali-tglitch,7,Sun Jun 14 18:51:00 2015 UTC,Payday 2 is similar to Borderlands in the sense that it lets you choose different builds all with different perks and advantages which let you behave very differently. Mow down enemies with an LMG with enforcer or pick them off at a distance with technician.
Borderlands,39ptt0,NeoZenith1,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:04:42 2015 UTC,Although it hasn't really got an RPG element to it. Still a fantastic game though well worth the money (even at full price imo)
Borderlands,39ptt0,maxvedwards,3,Sun Jun 14 11:54:55 2015 UTC,"Well if you're looking for another shooter/rpg to get hooked on, I cannot recommend STALKER enough. Completely different experience from BL, but still a phenomenal game. If you see it on sale, buy it for your own sake."
Borderlands,39ptt0,NeoZenith1,2,Sat Jun 13 18:40:45 2015 UTC,These games aren't for everyone but I highly recommend dark souls. It challenges the players mental ability in a wide variety of ways and it greatly rewards patience. Just one thing to keep in mind. Make sure you pick up dark souls 2: scholar of the first sin instead of the regular dx9 version.
Borderlands,39ptt0,SilentWord7,2,Sat Jun 13 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"Picked up GTAv (not on sale) but its a good game.  Incredibly well done world.  I enjoyed it but the plot really takes controls of your game so I stopped playing when I kept getting forced to play trevor.  I played Witcher 3 (not on sale)...I can see its going to be a decent RPG but just not feeling it after just one side mission.  Metro is a pure rail shooter.  Really boring for me.  If you want this gameplay, play Left for Dead..."
Borderlands,39ptt0,Coul33t,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:05:57 2015 UTC,"It's nothing like Borderlands but ARK Survival Evolved was just put on early access and it's so much fun. You've probably already heard of it, I don't think I need to describe it, but for those few of you under a rock it's an open world online survival game with dinosaurs thrown in. The only two issues are bad optimization (framerate is below 30 even on SLI Titan X's) and trolls (which are with every online survival game. I've been playing in PvE servers and it's a blast)"
Borderlands,39ptt0,SilentWord7,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:08:03 2015 UTC,I do live under a rock in this sense. What do you like about Ark?
Borderlands,39ptt0,Coul33t,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:17:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't played other survival games so I can't make a comparison with games like 7DTD, but the survival aspect is so well done.  Maybe it's because dinosaurs are really cool. There's nothing more threatening than waking up on the beach ten feet away from a big battle between a T-Rex and a Brontosaurus with puny men charging on Triceratopss. It's selling point isn't suspense and horror like zombie games, but the desire to create a prehistoric self-sustaining empire. I don't exactly know what it is, but something about it is so much fun. Consider checking out the subreddit /r/PlayArk  Also you can poop on command"
Borderlands,39ptt0,SilentWord7,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"While only remotely similar, I recommend 3079 and 3089. First person roguelikes (random landscapes, weapons, quests, everything) with RPG type elements."

Borderlands,39qajz,xRolexus,17,Sat Jun 13 18:35:14 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls, both 1 and 2. You can just beat the game of you want, or you could craft each character to perfection and farm for the perfect armor/weapons/items for your build. You can try out different play styles, and beat the game in different ways (lvl 1 run, bow only run, etc) Also, if the story itself starts to feal less fun, there is the PvP aspect of the game which only adds in another ridiculous amount of playability"
Borderlands,39qajz,_sLAUGHTER234,4,Sat Jun 13 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"Also, try bloodbourne. I wasn't a huge fan of the dark souls series when it was popular, but man is this a good game. It's challenging, wonderful lore and plot points, tons to do, it's eerily beautiful, and an incredibly diverse game. Easily my favorite adventure game. After playing it, I went back and really enjoyed the first dark souls. Also, if you ever want a new Borderlands experience, I didn't see you list the first game. It's severely underrated, and my favorite of the series. Give it a shot, despite being slightly less developed than the others."

Borderlands,39qajz,aman4456,3,Sat Jun 13 22:10:44 2015 UTC,I misread this as Dark Cloud and mostly if made sense until you said pvp. Dark Cloud 2 was my childhood time sink. Glorious!

Burnout Paradise I've played well into the thousands of hours as well.     Those, along with Borderlands 2 and TPS, are probably my most played games.   With the way things are going, CS:GO will probably top 1000 hours and continue to climb too.   Mass Effect 3's coop has been around 500 hours. That's nice to drop into for a nice change of pace.   I had kinda hoped I could dump lots of time into GTA V (online) but I just can't get into the hackers cheaters and griefers.   It feels like most of the games I've spent the most amount of time in are online multiplayer games, especially games where I either find friends to play along with, or where matches are fairly short and I can switch up and change so its not the same thing over and over."

If anyone liked them, download Underground 2 and install the THUG Pro mod. It adds three levels from THPS1, four from THPS2, three from THPS3, all from THPS4 (best game ever), all from THUG1, three from THAW, three from THP8, and a bonus level of Andy's Room from Toy Story.

I can only best describe it as a cross between TF2'S game flow with a Bubble Tanks styled 3D vehicle editor and War Thunder like combat. Really really fun and insane game to play in the later tiers. If you use the Code ""UPDATE22JUNE"", you get a 1 day premium membership, which allows you to rank faster and get more Tech Points to unlock more things during the grindy beginning parts. The code however expires Monday, so use it quickly!  I also love Cave Story. It's a 2d shooter that has an excellent story, weapon leveling system, and a ton of replayable content. It's pretty much a cult hit at this point.  The Shantae series is also great. They are a set of 2d side-scrolling platformers that follow the quest of a Half-Genie named (what else) Shantae, who must save the kingdom of Sequin Land from a gang of pirates run by an infamous raider, Risky Boots. In every one of them, Shantae can transform into spirit animals which can allow you to dive underwater, bash open obstacles, climb rocky outcroppings, and more."

Borderlands,39rsb1,NotRocketScieeence,6,Sun Jun 14 03:11:19 2015 UTC,"He really wasn't all that intimidating, but he was at least a fun fight. I personally believe he was a decent challenge, just not the back breaking strain that some other parts of the game were (ASSAULTING THE BUNKER D:< )."
Borderlands,39rsb1,JacePlaysGames,4,Sun Jun 14 04:33:12 2015 UTC,Lol fuck the bunker rush. The fight is also a gigantic pain in the ass.  That being said to assert my dominance after beating TVHM I killed the bunker 25 times in a row. Don't ask me why.   While on that topic my quickest kill on him was under 5 minutes.
Borderlands,39rsb1,AdmiralFacepalm,3,Sun Jun 14 07:33:03 2015 UTC,Quickest kill on Bunker or Warrior? I've killed Bunker in seconds with Zer0 and Maya.

Borderlands,39rsb1,_darkwingduck_,2,Sun Jun 14 06:44:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah huge build up, then pretty much just stood on a rock and blasted the shit out of him.  I felt the same way about the BL1 final boss.  Killed him and was like ""that's it?"""
Borderlands,39rsb1,1976dave,2,Sun Jun 14 14:59:43 2015 UTC,I used my level 50 unkempt harold with a level 68 bee shield against him at level 71 and beat him first try in uvhm. He is incredibly easy to kill
Borderlands,39rsb1,simsim28,2,Sun Jun 14 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"Well I found it very easy, because right before his battle I found a shield that made me immune to fire damage, so my health didnt take a hit at all, and my shields took very little damage.  So I got a super lucky drop, and had a super easy boss fight."
Borderlands,39rsb1,Poncho44,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:24:13 2015 UTC,"i think all 3 final bosses in the borderlands series were kinda underwhelming so far. you could just stand still while fighting the destroyer, the sentinel.. well hes just mehhhh and the warrior is pretty easy too once you figure him out."
Borderlands,39rsb1,NaturalPanic,3,Sun Jun 14 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"The Sentinel is quite a rush on UVHM though. It's even more of a blast IMO to fight the 'raid boss' version of him on UVHM.  He's tanky, but not complete bullshit compared to Eclipse from the DLC. And I like that he switches up elements, and also having to control your fire when he's trying to reflect bullets, and then dodge his shockwaves and what not. I found the fight really fun because unlike BL2, you had a better tool to dodge. (OzKits)  I always found Terra and Hyperius to be such bullshit, basically giving you megatons of damage that is impossible to avoid.  I liked fighting the Warrior because you had ways to avoid some damage, and having to avoid the rising lava levels sometimes too, and that feeling of being able to do so I found in TPS Sentinel fight."
Borderlands,39rsb1,ScarletMomiji,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:12:54 2015 UTC,even on uvhm i found the sentinel quite easy. even on the raid boss. i wish they would've made a real raid boss instead of just changing the name and stats. damn athena's limited imagination!
Borderlands,39rsb1,NaturalPanic,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I liked that he was do-able at least. He's no Eclipse, or Hyperius, but still a challenge.  Eclipse on UVHM in the DLC on the other hand...now that guy is a fricken raid boss. Still not impossible, but those missles were deadly."
Borderlands,39rsb1,ScarletMomiji,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:38:46 2015 UTC,i died so many times the first time i fought eclipse. after ages i was able to bring his shield down and he regenerated it and i just ragequit :P. i killed him quite easy now on uvhm on my doppelganger though. i guess you just need the right gear. but then agian... i was using glitched weapons and with the doppelgangers ammo refill when you throw a granade you never have to reload meaning you have glitches all the time.
Borderlands,39rsb1,NaturalPanic,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:50:10 2015 UTC,"He looks amazing, but I dealt enough damage with Salvador, so he rarely attacked, rendering the fight easy.

Borderlands,39rr1c,Zafords15,2,Sun Jun 14 03:07:54 2015 UTC,There isn't really a single analogue for Zer0 in TPS. Nisha with a Riflewoman build will work like the Sniper tree but Athena has some pretty solid melee options.
Borderlands,39rr1c,Sheepusmaximus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:26:04 2015 UTC,"Playing melee in TPS is difficult.  But since you have played melee Zer0 in BL2, I assume that you are a more advanced player in Borderlands.  I also played as melee Zer0 in BL2 and in TPS I chose Athena and was pretty impressed by her skills. Her melee skills are not as good as Zer0s unfortunately. She doesn't has things like backstab, ambush, etc. But her action skill makes her invincible for every attacks in front of her. So you could basically activate your action skill, strip your shield, and use bloodrush (this skill is kinda like the execute skill of Zer0).  I would still recommend you to use her left and right skill tree, because these are amazing. It requires a bit of micromanaging to get use of all these great synergies, but once you got it, she basically melts every enemie."
Borderlands,39rr1c,CriticalFaceTime,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:43:33 2015 UTC,"If you liked sniper zero try Aurelia, she has a perma version of critical ascension called I never miss which you can stack to 999 which is pretty dope.

Borderlands,39opp6,Reelen,56,Sat Jun 13 08:07:51 2015 UTC,"I always saw it a touch differently. There's all these fantastic technological marvels in the BL universe. The tiny snippets of history we've managed to see so far all hint towards a fall of central government and the rise of megacorporations and inter corporate warfare. Not a single hint as to anything other than firearms being invented. That stuff had to come from somewhere.  So far, what we know about the BL universe is six galaxies, god knows how many planets, moons, planetoids, asteroids, what have you. Odds are good the first few steps towards human expansion might have stumbled across a few vaults that contained countless goodies prime for reverse-engineering. That would account for things like FTL travel, digi-struct tech and the ubiquitous New You stations. To me, the only man made device, like actually constructed by slightly evolved monkey hands, is the ECHO communicator. This is all theory, but it kinda felt like common sense to me, ya know?  For the vaults, man...I heard Carl Sagan on one of those radio interviews a long, long, long-ass, long damn time ago. There's only so many ""billions and billions"" you can hear before you phase out, so what I remember is odd, but somewhat striking. He said something about how if humanity ended suddenly on that day, and an alien race came to the planet to poke around at things in an archaeological sense, things would be screwy. If one stumbled upon a helicopter, even though it would be a primitive craft, none of them would be able to fly it. Because the way we visually lay things out, the only things that would seriously draw attention would be the huge orange ""EMERGENCY"" arrows pointing to exits and explosive bolts. These aliens would figure out how to deploy every system in case of accidents long before the subject of flight would be breached.   Apply this to your vaults. The Destroyer vault is crawling with dangerous crap. Eridian androids, either working as guards, or deterrents, in no way point to the correct path taken. You fight through those racing Commandant Steele. Even the vault key, takes around 200 years to charge for one vault opening. That sure doesn't sound like a parole review schedule.   The Warrior's vault, on the complete other hand, is a frigging cake-eating stroll, comparatively. There's nothing dangerous there that doesn't rhyme with Hyperion. Just the nicely flowing glow of strange purple rocks that ebb in the direction of the vault. This struck me as a ""In case of Destroyer, break glass"" sorta deal. Like if the first vault holding our unpleasant tentacled nightmare monster failed or was sprung, some helpful Eridian tech could easily stroll on down to this other vault and release the Warrior. Which is somehow happily programmed to take orders from whoever opens the vault.   All that in conjunction with the sudden wellspring of Eridium after opening the first vault in BL--something that makes opening the second in BL2 real easy...it just all fit together to me. I dunno, though, I'm damn weird."

Borderlands,39opp6,Jimm607,2,Sat Jun 13 16:05:14 2015 UTC,"Jack came in like a bank robber. This is somehow the only fookin photo I can find of this stuff, all the perfectly sized cubes of crazy Eridian machines. Who knows what that stuff does? It could be pipelines of eridium to feed something, or a kind of circuit, maybe a conduit for energy going somewhere before it was hacked out of the rock. Some of that could be defense mechanisms severed from the site.   Jack bypassed anything that could be easily defensible simply by drilling into that installation. Keep in mind, what the pre-sequel taught us is Jack accessed the information on the Warrior's vault, odds are good he knows the location of all the defense hardpoints and probably how to disable them by cutting in the right spot. There's most likely a bunker entrance somewhere around Hero's Pass still loaded to the gills with freaky Eridian defense tech and killer androids."

The Overseer (The Eridian in TPS) COULD be similar to U-Mos from Metroid Prime 2 in that he/she protects a Vault that houses the remaining Eridians and now he/she's collecting Vault Hunters in order to combat the Seraphs.

Borderlands,39oc8c,RoadRunnerdn,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:16:37 2015 UTC,The lowest level possible to get for a pearlescent is 30. Tiny Tina Lootsplotion slot machines can drop them.
Borderlands,39oc8c,origamania,11,Mon Jun 15 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"In BL2 Pearls only drop in UVHM. They do not have a set loot source, but are more common from Tubby enemies, and Loot Midgets.  There are 4 that can only be obtained past level 61, and only from Tubby enemies as they were introduced in the Upgrade pack. Same goes for the Tubby class mods.  The 4 tubby only pearls are Wanderlust, Godfinger, Carnage, and Bekah.  12 pearls in total."
Borderlands,39oc8c,ilovecheese2,2,Sat Jun 13 05:48:34 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks"
Borderlands,39oc8c,IM_THE_MOON_AMA,3,Sat Jun 13 06:09:34 2015 UTC,"Also, if you get the last level pack, the 72 one, it comes with something called Digiraid. The final boss always drops a pearlescent."
Borderlands,39oc8c,v3xx,5,Sat Jun 13 07:54:56 2015 UTC,If it doesn't fall off the edge or get stuck inside a rock. I've seen both happen.
Borderlands,39oc8c,IM_THE_MOON_AMA,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:35:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I actually know a glitch that lets you skip the entire Digiraid map right up to the 1000101010000101010110 whatever guy. It cuts the time in more than half and lets you get more done. No mods involved."
Borderlands,39oc8c,v3xx,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:13:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I know two ways. I can either rocket jump with Salvador or drop through the floor. Both get you to the same spot with 0101100010
Borderlands,39oc8c,IM_THE_MOON_AMA,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:57:26 2015 UTC,The way I do it is before you walk of of the star area is you jump on a small edge near the ceiling. With an explosive grenade you can blow yourself through the wall and walk along a path that leads to him or any area you want.

Borderlands,39oc8c,IM_THE_MOON_AMA,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:04:22 2015 UTC,"for that go to Tiny Tina's world (can't remember the name) or the Wildlife Preserve place. There's a glitch that was never patched that if you haven't finished the ""Doctor's Orders"" mission there's a room that has at least 1 to 4 guaranteed chubbys. If you don't already know about this I can take a screen shot of the room and put it on here."
Borderlands,39oc8c,Dookie_boy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:09:58 2015 UTC,Are tubby and chubby the same thing ? I've seen chubbies but never seen a tubby.
Borderlands,39oc8c,ilovecheese2,3,Sat Jun 13 16:36:34 2015 UTC,"Tubby is what they are re-named to in UVHM. Maybe only past level 61 as well?  Chubby can drop the WTF, Bunny, Cracked Sash and skins. Tubby can drop the pearls, and legendary class mods."
Borderlands,39oc8c,CriticalFaceTime,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"It's all right, but keep in mind that Tubbys only drop the new class mods once you pass level 61"

Not sure how true this is though? Can anyone verify this?"
Borderlands,39oc8c,ilovecheese2,2,Sat Jun 13 06:13:17 2015 UTC,Never seen it personally. But mainly because I haven't farmed those slots until UVHM :I
Borderlands,39oc8c,tacolover1PSN,2,Sat Jun 13 06:26:25 2015 UTC,Can confirm. I was playing with my friend and we were farming the TTAoDK slots after beating the dlc on normal. He got the triple vault symbols and it popped out an Avenger SMG. It was around level 30 but i dont remember exactly.

Borderlands,39mmp6,musteatbrainz,11,Fri Jun 12 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"Just use Willowtree. It's like the gibbed save editor, but for BL1."
Borderlands,39mmp6,theswerto,2,Sat Jun 13 00:31:04 2015 UTC,"Search youtube! I'm on mobile and can't but I remember doing to a friends save on accident. It's something like loading a level 1, then before you enter load a lvl 50 and then the skill points are added to that account. If I figure it out later I'll edit this but hopefully someone knows what I'm talking about. It's done through local coop without any hacks/mods/codes."
Borderlands,39mmp6,Shadoscuro,3,Sat Jun 13 01:55:53 2015 UTC,It can be done with Cheat Engine. It is a bit of a hassle though because you still have to level up a few times to gain enough skill points in order to find the location in memory that contains the number of skill points to spend for the character.
Borderlands,39mmp6,citonox,3,Fri Jun 12 21:13:30 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Have you used or heard of Willowtree before? http://sourceforge.net/projects/willowtree/
Borderlands,39mmp6,citonox,3,Fri Jun 12 22:16:13 2015 UTC,I have used WillowTree before but I could never get any changes that I made to stick. I have never talked to anyone how has so YMMV.

If no, then it's going to be at least that price during the whole sale.   Also ask yourself these questions:  1) Is it a Flash Sale? (No? Then wait)  2) Is it part of an event sale? This is the Monster section of the sales. (No? Then wait)  3) Is it the last day of the sale? (Yes? Then buy)  Practically everything major will go through the flash or event section. If not, then it will hit the daily deal section. Everything that's gone through the daily deals will go through 1 more time on the last day."
Borderlands,39lny2,imranh101,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:14:37 2015 UTC,0) Is it a daily deal?  Dailys are always as low as they go so if it pops up daily might as well get it.

Borderlands,39lny2,Awesomebox5000,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:54:54 2015 UTC,It's usually the difference between 75% and 90%. I don't see TPS going above 75%.
Borderlands,39lny2,AmericanFromAsia,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:05:08 2015 UTC,Since all the daily deals are repeated on the final day   Really? I thought the only reason you buy on te final day is because there's no of a game going as a flash sale
Borderlands,39lny2,basadvo,3,Sat Jun 13 14:03:46 2015 UTC,"Does it come with all the DLC? If not, I'd just wait until the winter sale. It'll probably have the DLC at that point and be even cheaper.

Borderlands,39lny2,notdookiehowser,2,Sat Jun 13 03:29:17 2015 UTC,"Hm, if it goes 80% off, that would take another $6 off or so. I really want to pull the trigger and play it right away but that's just enough money to tempt me to wait I think."

Generally though you're better off with a Hornet or a corrosive Vladof pistol, depending on character.  The Zim is better largely because of the fact that cryo is more versatile than corrosive.  It synergizes arguably best with Aurelia not only because of the ice damage but also because it's less affected by the mag size penalty from Large Caliber than other weapons.  edit: nvm, it just got added to the Salvador top gear list"
Borderlands,39l96h,brandpanz,8,Fri Jun 12 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"I loved this gun when I played as Krieg. With 100 bloodlust stacks, you can get the entire ammo capacity of the gun into one mag and never have to reload. It's not the best gun in terms of dps, but there's a lot of value in never reloading.   It's also very easy to farm. I only everr needed 7 or 8 runs to get one on level. The drop location is very close to the entrance to the fridge, so farming only takes like 10-15 minutes  in my experience."
Borderlands,39l96h,madeupmoniker,7,Fri Jun 12 15:51:34 2015 UTC,"Full Bandit build on Salvador: Expandified Spinnygun, Slagga, some kind of triple barrel shotgun and a Badaboom for second winds/fun. See a Hyperion logo? Switch out the shotgun for this little beauty and go to town. Is the Hornet/Teapot better? Perhaps. But you have to do all that boring aiming and trigger pulling. I prefer to tape down my fire buttons and just point."
Borderlands,39l96h,spwack,4,Fri Jun 12 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"I like the Gub.  It's a good gun.  It's simple.  It's a very good Corrosive weapon for Salvador and reasonably good for Maya and Gaige.  It's not that great in Normal because it will be outleveled before you start fighting Hyperion again, but in TVHM and above it's worth going to get.  The Gub is the easiest weapon to get from the three legendaries in the Rat Maze, both because Laney is closer and because she's easier to kill than the giant Goliath or Rakkman.  But if you want Sledge's Shotgun or the Gunerang, you will literally run right by Laney for each run, so you may as well kill her and see if you get a good Gub.  Overall, I don't like the Rat Maze that much (rats in general are annoying), but if any of those guns are something you're looking for, you may as well do the whole run - it's not as bad as running up to Captain Flynt.  Thumbs up. Not worth farming for every character, but can sort of ""side-drop"" on the way to other good loot, and it's probably worth using if you get it."
Borderlands,39l96h,cannons_for_days,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:03:07 2015 UTC,"Bandit in general is eh for Salvador, the mags are too big to make use out of Money Shot and Sal can already avoid reloading with Inconceivable and 5 Shots or 6. Gub's still a better choice than the Hornet for him though (imo) because he can't ADS."
Borderlands,39l96h,brandpanz,3,Fri Jun 12 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"This was my very first legendary drop in BL2, so the Gub has a special connection with me.  With that being said, it's not a bad weapon. It's a solid gun. Not outstanding but decent. The only gripe I have with it is that it only comes in corrosive (Really? Why?).  For parts, Bandit grip for the manufacturer bonus and even bigger magazine size and I prefer the damage accessory for this gun. This gun can wreck things with Zer0, as well as Maya and Kreig to a certain extent.  Why does it only come in corrosive? I just think it'd have more use if it came in multiple elements."
Borderlands,39l96h,lurklar,3,Fri Jun 12 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"I really like the Gub. Probably more than I should. It's got higher than normal damage, a MASSIVE clip, and less sway than your typical bandit gun. Unfortunately the Hornet exists, and as a result it's more or less outclassed. I generally think that every character should have at least one corrosive weapon in their kit, and this certainly makes a strong case... just not as strong as the Hornet sometimes. Krieg likes this gun a lot, and thanks to Blood Filled Guns, you're going to be able to forget about reloading for a while. Not a bad fit for Axton either since he can reload pretty quickly. I think probably the only character you don't want to bother with it on is Zer0, who will generally do better with a caustic Infinity. Bandit Grip, then your preferred prefix. ""Rapider"" can improve the fire rate, and thanks to the extended mag you can get away with sustained fire. ""Dubble"" is another option, but some might find the accuracy and recoil penalties to be a little much. It has the mag for it though. Yes and no. It's a quick farm once you complete the mission since the enemy spawn is so close to the entrance of the fridge. However, as I mention elsewhere the Hornet is probably the better gun and is even easier to farm. It comes down to preference."
Borderlands,39l96h,meh_mediocre,3,Fri Jun 12 18:23:33 2015 UTC,Huh.. I just got this from the loot midgets.. Works pretty well with gaige when she has full anarchy.. Lots of continuous ricochets

Borderlands,39l96h,speedx77,3,Fri Jun 12 20:09:58 2015 UTC,"""Misles"" prefix makes this weapon a viable candidate for anti-Buzzard flak by increasing its bullet speed.  AND looks cool in first-person, always important.  Matching grip gives it a ridiculous capacity and a very reasonable reload time.  Maliwan grip is a good alternative for the increased elemental effect probability.  Alternate alternative is Vladof grip to help it empty that oversized magazine more quickly, though in that case you probably want the ""Rapider"" accessory.  I've never cottoned to the Pre-Sequel's Zim in the same way.  Perhaps because I can't play Krieg there."

Anyway, sorry if it's not appropriate to post it here, I got a bit excited thinking some of my BL2 Steam friends might be interested in it, we hardly play anymore since pre-sequel.

Borderlands,39hkno,Zijien,6,Thu Jun 11 23:30:33 2015 UTC,Is it worth waiting for more discount? or will this stay at £10 for the GOTY edition
Borderlands,39hkno,m3tolli,10,Thu Jun 11 20:07:22 2015 UTC,It's a daily deal so it probably won't go any cheaper than this during the Summer Sale.
Borderlands,39hkno,Shadoscuro,-5,Thu Jun 11 21:06:49 2015 UTC,Unless it gets a flash sale...flash sales are considered the lowest point in the price tier of the summer sale. Not only that but dailies are also likely to repeat themselves or be voted in the encore at the end.  edit: I am miss informed from previous postings apparently dailies and flash share the same sale point though I had to find sources for myself with none posted here.  BUT just because prices are set for dailies == flash doesn't mean when something gets put on sale again their won't be a pricing error or other weird stuff going on in the store. It's still worth holding out imo.
Borderlands,39hkno,TheUnspeakableHorror,2,Fri Jun 12 07:05:52 2015 UTC,"Is it likely to get a flash sale, being only two episodes into a five episode game?"
Borderlands,39hkno,Shadoscuro,2,Fri Jun 12 08:11:12 2015 UTC,"Well I don't want to tell you one way or another because of the negativity my parent comment got. BUT. IMO. It is more likely to get a flash sale over the PreSequal because of its overall smaller platform(not a full AAA/w.e). Plus the PreSequal is still relatively new and various Tell-Tale games seem to always be featured in a flash, but idk if they were complete or not at the time as is the state of Tales from the Borderlands. Sorry I just really want the PreSequal to drop lol but in regards to all of steam it is hard to say if TftB will get a flash.   Regardless of the ""chart"" that was posted I still believe I'm in the right from what I've seen at /r/steam, /r/gamedeals, and personal experience the last 3 years. So I will personally be passing this daily in hopes of a flash sale, or wait for it to appear as a daily again or encore/players choice. However it's not a must have on my wishlist so saving my money to put towards The Witcher 3 or The PreSequal is greater than missing out on this daily if it is the lowest it'll go OR the only time we'll see it. (Again, both of which I highly doubt.)"
Borderlands,39hkno,jediyoshi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"No, but that's by virtue of it being a daily."
Borderlands,39hkno,irocktoo,2,Fri Jun 12 15:42:18 2015 UTC,Not true. Daily Deals and flash deals are the lowest prices a specific game will go in this summer sale.  Use this guide for purchasing games.    http://www.gosugamers.net/files/images/news/2014/december/hOvdqbr.png

Borderlands,39hkno,GlowyGoat,5,Fri Jun 12 08:27:46 2015 UTC,"For the full experience, yes. Not so much for story reasons (Though TPS will spoil some major plot points from BL2) but more so you can see how all the mechanics have evolved."
Borderlands,39hkno,Muscufdp,2,Fri Jun 12 08:37:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your quick answer, that was exactly my interrogation: release date for the evolution of the games mechanics, or in-game chronological order for the story. Now I know what to do."
Borderlands,39hkno,MyLoveHammer,2,Fri Jun 12 08:56:40 2015 UTC,"I also wouldn't invest too much in BL1. The pacing of the main story is already slow, and if you do all the sidequests on your first run, it will feel excruciating by recent game standards. BL2 is a game i would spend the time on 100% clearing though. The Pre Sequal is really like a stand-alone dlc. It's on the same engine as 2 and there are not very many changes mechanically. It adds neat stuff like laser weapons, and the cryo element. The low gravity is neat too. It is rather short compared to BL2 though, base game to base game wise."
Borderlands,39hkno,Muscufdp,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:15:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I was watching bisnap's stream of BL1 yesterday (that's when I decided to buy the 3 games) and he was saying that the first is more interesting for ""hardcore"" players, who do not fear to farm again and again for better loot, while the other 2 could be played more ""casually"".  Would you agree with that?  If I like the game mechanics I can see myself spending time farming, so I'll see."

Would you agree with that?   Not 100%. Borderlands 1 is old and shows it, therefore fans of the series are more likely to play it, but the game balance was wacky and inconsistent and I didn't find myself farming all that much.  Borderlands 2 can be played casually, but has a lot more depth and on high difficulties is more ""hardcore"". Also, did you buy BL2 GOTY? Because you should if you enjoy it all.

Borderlands,39hkno,Muscufdp,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I bought the GOTY edition for the first 2 and the PS came with the season pass, so I suppose that I will have all the DLC needed."
Borderlands,39hkno,Shadoscuro,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:57:34 2015 UTC,I put way more hours into the first one because I felt like anything went in there. BL2 has a higher level end game but that requires specific builds and you are relatively focused on needing that gun or shield or w/e. Things might have changed with the recent drop rate buff in BL2 to give access to wider possibilities but my friends and I felt any weapon could go with any class and you could have fun with BL1. Even if that falls into the imbalanced or casual side of things it's my $.02.

The early King's quest games had more to do in them than TTG releases."
Borderlands,39hkno,Jimm607,2,Fri Jun 12 06:16:24 2015 UTC,disclaimer: this user is sharing a minority opinion. the majority of people who have played pretty much any of the games from TTG have thoroughly enjoyed them.

Borderlands,39hkno,Teaflax,2,Fri Jun 12 04:00:43 2015 UTC,"Sure. I mean, I had a clue, having played the first three minutes of TWD. But an hour into TftB1, I was shocked at how almost nothing that makes me consider something a game (and I play - and create - a lot of tabletop games) was in this work. At all.   I care quite a bit about the world building/lore of Borderlands, but getting through this thing was more of a chore than it was entertainment of any kind."
Borderlands,39hkno,Hammerhil,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:07:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Maybe the other TTG releases are awesome, but there's so little to do in TFTBL that slogging through it was a pain for maybe 5 minutes of something good each episode. I certainly didn't finish it thinking that it was time well spent.   I've never played anything so firmly planted on rails and as slow paced as this."
Borderlands,39j828,v3xx,15,Fri Jun 12 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"To be honest, my favorite sniper with Aurelia was never anything more special than a decent Jakobs rifle.  Yes, I know that she has massive cryo boosts, but I never really felt like I needed it.  I carry around a rifle of each element of course, but nothing was as powerful and satisfying as the ""PING!"" of each one shot kill.  As Marcus says, ""If it took more than one shot, then you weren't using a Jakobs."""
Borderlands,39j828,Sword_n_board,5,Fri Jun 12 02:53:24 2015 UTC,"The Skullmasher is a great sniper for Aurelia provided you aren't relying on I Never Miss too much. It drops from Nel (the guy you called a dick early in the game) pretty frequently, although it's getting him to fight you that's the tricky part. Fremington's Edge, despite possibly having a bad reputation ever since Bahroo put it in his Worst in Slot video, is actually a pretty solid sniper, obtained from the mission ""Don't Shoot the Messenger"".  Most of the game's best snipers, however, are world drops. The Maliwan Snider, Vladof Droog and Jakobs Muckamuck (all matching barrels) are all often considered top-tier. If you really want a unique you can grinder farm a Pitchfork, which is often used in Aurelia speedkill videos. Cryo is the best element (imo) for all of these (except Jakobs for obvious reasons) due to it having the most synergy with Aurelia's kit."
Borderlands,39j828,brandpanz,2,Fri Jun 12 02:57:39 2015 UTC,I second The SKullmasher.  lvl 60 Baroness spec'd heavy into middle and to capstone in left tree.  Skullmashed destroys everything.  With Large Caliber it one shots just about everyone even in UVHM
Borderlands,39j828,DrSquid,3,Fri Jun 12 08:36:00 2015 UTC,The Razorback from the Home Delivery mission is really underrated.  It's a one-shot head-shot for most normal enemies with every character if you can get used to the fire rate and iron sights.
Borderlands,39j828,tazercow,2,Fri Jun 12 04:07:53 2015 UTC,"The only problem with it is that on Run #1, it will fall off when you're in the Hyperion Hub"
Borderlands,39j828,PotatoLiSK,2,Fri Jun 12 06:37:19 2015 UTC,"That's still a pretty good run though, a lvl 11 gun lasting into the 20's.  Spec into skills that increase crit damage and it should be viable all the way up to the Zarpedon fight."

Really nice for building INM stacks against large enemies and bosses too given the fire rate. I personally enjoy cryo longnail on Aurelia for shield bypass shenanigans but its pretty gimmicky."
Borderlands,39i4p8,itsfoine,18,Thu Jun 11 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"You need to be LV 50 to do You Will Die, so save it for TVHM. You might need to play with others, too."
Borderlands,39i4p8,Weltall548,4,Thu Jun 11 21:50:27 2015 UTC,"Once you start TVHM, you can always go back to Normal to more easily complete the challenges (i.e. level up to 50, then go back into Normal and try it). You level up real slow after you finish a playthrough/max level for that playthrough (30 for normal), so hopping into TVHM will get you more levels to unlock more skills and may well help you with your missions.  Also, as /u/Weltall548 says, You Will Die is level 50, so you are quite underleveled for it currently. You won't get many levels staying in normal, and to get near 50 you should start TVHM. Hopefully your weapons aren't too underleveled for TVHM (since drops in normal only max at 30, unless its the golden chest in Sanctuary or some of the DLC).   For the robot mission, you have some caustic weapons for DOT (damage over time)? That way you can hit 'em, and if need be hide for a bit to recover health/shields, then peek and shoot again.  Then there's skills. If Salvador specs into money shot, you want guns with smaller magazines for more chances at money shot. If you also spec into inconceivable, you can wind up with multiple chances for Money Shot (and lots of damage!). Also try to spec into Down Not Out because going into FFYL and losing gunzerking aint fun. A lot of people also like No Kill Like Overkill so you can kill smaller enemies and get massive extra damage on your next shot.  As for Zero, it all depends on the build type you are going for. Some go for Sniping, others go for melee, and both can be viable.   Honestly though I've never thought of Zero as a great co-op partner. Maya is good, as she can revive people with her action skill (if so specced), and Axton can throw his shield to aggro enemies and draw their attention to revive others (though Zero could always go into deception and revive too, I guess).   As for DLC, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is absolutely fantastic, and a must. Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage is pretty good, and has plenty of funny bits. Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty is pretty good too. If the season pass is on sale, you can get it and also get Hammerlock's hunt which many will happily pass over. All of those DLCs will scale up to level 30 in normal mode. If you really like the game, you can grab the headhunter packs, but most of those are fairly short. And only buy the skins if you must have them."
Borderlands,39i4p8,DanzaBaio,2,Thu Jun 11 23:14:45 2015 UTC,"I find Hammerlock DLCs really fun. Maybe I just like hearing that British accent. That assassin quest in the headhunter was gold. ""PINATA TIME"""
Borderlands,39i4p8,origamania,3,Sat Jun 13 01:36:12 2015 UTC,"I preferred it to either of the two DLCs that preceded it.  The savage/witchdoctor mechanics were new and challenging, and the side missions accommodated my sense of humor.  My only complaint is that I would have liked more time to hang out with Hammerlock himself.  He and I were done after the introductory mission.  Maybe it was something I said.  Or shot."

Borderlands,39jb23,lloyd334,2,Fri Jun 12 04:30:59 2015 UTC,"I tend to do any side quests available for games I play anyway and I figure I'll need the levels since I'm flying solo. My fiancée picked siren class in BL2 and that turret is badass, so I started BL with siren class and not a fan of the turret at all. I'm still early enough in to where I'm fine with starting over so is what class do you recommend for bl1 solo?    I know there are a million threads about this but I'm just curious as to the opinion of someone already giving me advice."
Borderlands,39jb23,ThoseAngryArabs,5,Fri Jun 12 04:35:40 2015 UTC,"For turrets I'm fairly sure you mean commando/soldier, not siren. If you want to get through BL1 as quickly as possible then playing as lilith is the way to go; the movement speed buffs she gets from phasewalk and that kill skill in the middle(?) tree will help a lot."

I like her because she can deal crazy amounts of damage while also having good defensive abilities, and she's the one I'd suggest you to play. I'd also suggest you to read this guide here as it can give you some ideas on what missions to do first and why. Hope you have fun!"

Borderlands,39jb23,IAmFern,3,Fri Jun 12 13:30:38 2015 UTC,"IMO, BL2 is more worth it. Play BL1 after you've completed BL2 (they fill in the story) if you want more. If you still want more, buy The Pre Sequel when it's on sale. It's not worth $60, because it's essentially a large DLC for BL2. Still good though."

Borderlands,39g8nf,TheAkashicRecord,8,Thu Jun 11 19:07:10 2015 UTC,"1 - Depends, some parts are more interactive than other parts. Half of the first episode is pretty much just cutscenes and random parts in between.  2 - Yes, It's canon."

In general, I support the idea of releasing a game ""when it's done"" but in this case, where you are waiting for episodes of an adventure, the wait actually hurts the overall experience and enjoyment I get a lot more. Unfortunately, today I care about this game a whole lot less than when it was announced and when I played episode 1.  I bought the season pass that still says in the Xbox website that all the content will be available this summer and I still expect them to honor that promise.  And on top of that, there was the fiasco of the achievements not appearing on the xbox website until days after episode 2 came out. I really hope they get that one right this time."

Borderlands,39hyvu,AmericanFromAsia,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"Dead key:       A dead key is a special kind of a modifier key on a typewriter or computer keyboard that is typically used to attach a specific diacritic to a base letter.  The dead key does not generate a (complete) character by itself but modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after. Thus, a dedicated key is not needed for each possible combination of a diacritic and a letter, but rather only one dead key for each diacritic is needed, in addition to the normal base letter keys.  For example, if a keyboard has a dead key for the grave accent (`), the French character à can be generated by first pressing and then A, whereas *è* can be generated by first pressing and then E. Usually, the diacritic in an isolated form can be generated with the dead key followed by space, so a plain grave accent can be typed by pressing ` and then Space.

Borderlands,39i1tp,dharakhero,5,Thu Jun 11 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I've played both games on Mac so I think I can help you.  My 2013 Macbook Pro runs BL2 and TPS perfectly fine. Your computer should run it 100% without problems.  Not sure what's confusing about the Summer Sale. There aren't any ""tricks"" or hidden catches with the price reductions. The prices are as shown in the Steam client. You buy the game, and you can immediately install it on your Mac. Just make sure the game you bought is Mac-compatable (BL2 and TPS both are, so no need to worry about this with Borderlands).  I would get BL2 with all DLC. TPS has overall had worse critical reviews, the storyline likely will not be as meaningful to you without first finishing BL2, and you get a LOT less contents for your money. The game is not only more expensive, but you the actual content in the game is smaller as well, even if you had all the DLCs for TPS. Imo, unless you've played BL2 and are done with it already, there's no reason to buy TPS over BL2. TPS is a good game, but it doesn't hold a candle to BL2. Especially consider the fact that you already played BL2 and loved it, it seems like a no-brainer to me.  One thing to note is that the GOTY Edition of BL2, which is the one on the Summer Sale, does not include the 2nd UVHM upgrade pack or the Headhunter Packs. These will cost extra, but I would say they account for 5-10% of the game's overall content, so you really aren't missing too much and can always pick them up later once you'd gotten to that point."

Borderlands,39ez8q,poke86,-8,Thu Jun 11 12:17:09 2015 UTC,"I know I'm in the minority, but I really don't get the appeal of this game, or any recent Telltale games. When they made traditional point-and-click adventures like BttF or Monkey Island it was fine, but now for me it goes like this:   fall asleep during cutscene not enough time to read through the choice of responses fall asleep again don't realize you're in a QTE, die try QTE again go back to sleep.   As far as horrible gaming ideas go, QTEs are just after micro transactions in my book.  If all you have is a good story, make it a movie or a comic book. Don't slap QTEs on it and call it a game.  EDIT: My least popular comment ever! I didn't think this would be so inflammatory. Nice to see we can all respect each other's opinions /s."
Borderlands,39ez8q,Real-Terminal,9,Thu Jun 11 14:35:23 2015 UTC,"I don't care. At all.  Quicktime events are fine, they allow developers to choreograph things without cutting the player out, and offer more options than a cutscene.   Telltale games are basically animated choose your own adventure novels, but with a much more solid story, due to the structure remaining coherent."
Borderlands,39ez8q,NDWolfwood5268,-1,Thu Jun 11 12:09:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree with QTEs. They're lazy design. Pure and simple. All they do is penalize people who don't pay attention to cut scenes or people with bad reflexes. No one feels ""engaged"" with QTEs.   The premise is a good one, though. Engage the player. Make them care about story. But this isn't the way to do it. I don't have a good suggestion for an alternative, but having nothing is better than having a QTE."
Borderlands,39ez8q,Real-Terminal,6,Thu Jun 11 13:38:50 2015 UTC,"No, QTE's are not lazy design, no matter how you slice it, they can be used lazily, just like any other mechanic.   QTE's are good for important actions in cutscenes and action sequences, for small moments that don't require much input, and for dedicated games like Heavy Rain and Telltale games which use them primarily.   QTE's are no different to most gameplay interactions, press a button in reaction to a situation, the best use of them is in the Arkham series, the Harley Quinn encounter and Rahs boss fight comes to mind as being fun and satisfying, these worked because they were seamlessly strung into the actual gameplay.  It's when they are used in place of a boss fight that it's lazy, Far Cry 3, Dying Light and Resident Evil 4 use them in place of boss fights and, while the Leon and Krauser fight was fucking awesome, it was hard to appreciate it with the QTE's getting in the way.   QTE's when used resourcefully are perfectly fine, but using them in place of established gameplay is lazy. Telltale and Quantic Dream uses them as the core of their gameplay, which works because they aren't unexpected, and in the case of Quantic Dream, are actually challenging. Far Cry 3 and Dying Light made important moments cheap and awkward because they were poorly used in place of an actual challenge."
Borderlands,39ez8q,NDWolfwood5268,3,Thu Jun 11 14:29:51 2015 UTC,"I can see the distinction. I guess it is up to the dev to use them well. Two of my favorite games are RE4 and 5 and they abuse QTEs like a redheaded stepchild. In games like Heavy Rain or an adventure game, they could be acceptable, but I still feel like they could be replaced with something better. I think Telltale has been good about improving on them, making them a bit more ""skillful"" like lining up shots. I consider them more mini games at that point.   Thinking about it more, though, I think I have to admit you're right. The games i think of when I hear ""QTE"" are the worst examples. When done well, I barely notice they're in the game. I guess my complaint would become ""QTEs are too easy for a dev to implement badly."" As such, I'd rather most devs keep them to a minimum, but they can be used reasonably."

I enjoyed BttF, but it got pretty tedious at times, walking back and forth between places, spamming through dialog options just to get the correct answer so I can progress to the next scene.  Personally, I like to sit back and just enjoy the story being (mostly) told to me."

Borderlands,39hvke,raquaza120,26,Thu Jun 11 20:42:24 2015 UTC,"Clearly Jack was wielding the Hyperion-manufactured Plot Device, which has a base damage in the millions and ignores shield/health-gate. Only drawback is that the reload speed is atrocious and it has a default mag size of 1.  As for a universe explanation? Maybe Angel's death messed with all the electronics, given her tech-based abilities. Or Jack's little teleporter has a built in EMP when it activates, which stripped Roland's shields and left him vulnerable.  Or maybe if you think too hard about any of the game mechanics a lot of the plot starts to fall apart, so we should just leave it as it is >.>"
Borderlands,39hvke,bughumbar,6,Thu Jun 11 20:59:57 2015 UTC,"Jack was Mordecai in disguise, he was specced into Trespass. Didn't anyone else find it suspicious how he only showed up after 'Jack' died? We know he has body doubles, the plastic surgery was just more extensive than thought.  Seriously, though, there's a gun that can bypass shields, the Trespasser, named after Mordecai's skill. I don't see any reason why Jack couldn't get a different gun with the same effect."
Borderlands,39hvke,Ubiquitouch,4,Thu Jun 11 21:34:02 2015 UTC,"Talking about shields: when Lilith teleported Sanctuary to the skies, wasn't the city without a shield? And easily spotted from the Helios Space Station? If it had no shields, what prevented Jack from bombarding it? Did I miss any dialog? Or was this left unexplained?"
Borderlands,39hvke,diogosanto,7,Thu Jun 11 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"When you get back to Sanctuary after Lilith teleports it, there's a bit of dialogue where Lilith sends out a message to Hyperion saying she can teleport the city again at the drop of a hat, but if they want to waste a few more billion dollars on a lunar strike, they can go right ahead.  She's bluffing, but it works."

You kinda have to hang out in the doorway or you'll trigger them talking directly to you. And it takes her a while to actually deliver the line. So it is kind of easy to miss.  There's usually this kind of banter after every story mission that brings you back to Sanctuary. Just hang around before actually turning it in."

The fight was over, right?  Alternately, Roland's shield worked like Siegfried's shield.  It didn't cover his back, because a hero never turns his back to the enemy.  Alternately alternately, Jack is actually an Assassin with 11/5 Ambush (from his Hyperion-manufactured Contemptible Killer classmod), 5/5 Headshot, and 5/5 One Shot One Kill.  Roland's critical hit zone was in the middle of his back, both for the aforementioned Hero reason and because he needed to leave an attractive hero's corpse."
Borderlands,39hvke,Myozunitonirun,3,Thu Jun 11 23:01:31 2015 UTC,Pretty sure shields and whatnot aren't canon to the story.

But the game just felt empty. at first it was ok because I just assumed there would be as much dlc for this game as there was for BL2, but that turned out to be bullshit. I bought the Abandoned Training Facility and felt like it was a complete waste of my $5. It was something that should have been included in the full game. Up until this point I loved all of the borderlands dlc, and felt like it was money well spent, not TPS. so I havent bought any other of the dlc for tps and dont plan to. I will stick to BL2."

Also, It felt weird that one second the writers are all  ""Your characters and Jack are the good guys, and the Saviors Of Elpis"", and then the next second one of the five makes a remark to an NPC about wanting to kill everyone on Pandora regardless of innocence. It just made me hate the characters I was playing as, and really made me dislike Jack in this game. Overall the story was sub-par, the characters weren't relatable, or even likable, and the post-story content was almost non-existent."

Borderlands,39clgj,AGlassOfMilk,8,Wed Jun 10 23:21:20 2015 UTC,"It's bland. Every area is either part of the space station or just space, there's not color, just greys and light blues. Enemies are far between each other leaving excessive space. The character's are unlikable walking cliches. The comedy is boring. I wasn't laughing and having fun, I was annoyed because I had to walk to the same damn place four times in a row because it didn't have fast travel.  The enemies were boring to fight, mostly the same mechanics used in Borderlands 2, the scavs were indistinguishable, all scavs felt the same while bandits had several varieties and play styles attributed to them.  The music was uninteresting. Go listen to the caustic caverns theme, or the dam music. Now listen to the whirs and long grinds in the Pre-Sequels music. Just... not good.  The graphic quality is sub-par. Despite being last-gen, it was significantly less detailed than Borderlands 2. Go to that super-big space area (the space station outside, the name escapes me) there's huge areas that area essentially just flat white squares. Just boring. Or the factory exterior, very boring/bland/featureless.   Very little variety, most missions were fetch-quests or something similar. The ONLY mission I can think of that was funny and fun was the basketball one. Where were the missions where I partied with Claptrap, or had to hunt down booze, or just anything... interesting?  I loved Borderlands 2. It kept me interested, every new area I wanted to explore and embrace, the enemies were pleasant and fun to fight, the game was exciting and drew me in with its atmosphere and got me to stay while I was laughing my ass off. The Pre-Sequel just missed the mark on what makes Borderlands... Borderlands. And no, I'm confident I'm not just worn out on the series, Tales from the Borderlands has been one of the best experiences I've had in gaming since playing BL2 for the first time.  EDIT: The Holodome I just deleted from my hard-drive today, not worth $10. They should be ashamed of that DLC, it was boring, weak, short, honestly not worth anyone's time let alone money. Claptastic Voyage was... okay? Not really much funnier than the main game, the glitchy areas were a lot of fun the first time through, but it felt much too short for its own good."

Borderlands,39clgj,NaturalPanic,2,Thu Jun 11 09:50:33 2015 UTC,"I liked the game a lot. The sole reason was the closer look at Jack.  The game felt lacking a purpose. Some moments are there, sure, but there wasn't an urgency that I felt with 2. It just left me wanting more."

Sad thing is them releasing this was the nail in the coffin for any more content for BL2 which there are 4-5 times as many people playing on Steam at any given moment ."
Borderlands,39clgj,1karl1,2,Thu Jun 11 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"The story was weak and it lacked overall content.  With only one campaign dlc and pretty lackluster ""raid"" bosses there's just not much to do once you max out the characters.  Other than that I actually thought they improved on a lot of the gameplay mechanics and designed much more interesting player characters.  It's fun to build up a character but after that there's nothing left to do.  The story is the biggest let down imo.  BL2 had a villain.  In TPS you're supposed to be the villain but you're also kind of good, and the person you're fighting is supposed to be good but they're also kind of bad.  I actually thought it weakened Jack's character as a whole by trying to shove in a whole bunch of unnecessary backstory that doesn't really make sense."
Borderlands,39clgj,tazercow,4,Thu Jun 11 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"Not enough mobs, and the characters are too overpowered making the few mobs there a joke. You can't have a good game without gameplay.  Also, too much backtracking."
Borderlands,39clgj,blackmarketdolphins,3,Thu Jun 11 03:13:16 2015 UTC,Ugh exactly I hated all that backtracking through the same areas. I felt like bl2 had a much better quest flow.
Borderlands,39clgj,Semigloss01010001,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"TPS reigns supreme in over BL and BL2 in one category: Combat. Between low-grav jumps, butt-stomps, laser guns, active skills being a blast. I hope all future BLs have as good combat as TPS.  The story is about as good as BL2s. BL1 has the best story, IMO, but that's another argument."
Borderlands,39clgj,otheranotherbrother,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:56:51 2015 UTC,"Personally, playing BPS on the XB1 as opposed to the 360 makes me appreciate the game more. I could barely tolerate the 360 version, but maybe it's because Willheim didn't click for me in the way my XB1 character (Aurelia) did.  There's a lot of backtracking, not as much content; if you do ONLY Story Missions in BL2 it takes about 40ish hours. If you do literally everything in BPS, it takes about 30ish hours.  The Australian script can get a little grating, especially after the 4th time you hear it.  However the positives (for me at least) are:  - Butt slams - Being able to glide - Lasers - Being able to play/hear Jack Double's lines - cryo <3"
Borderlands,39clgj,SilverNightingale,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:56:06 2015 UTC,"I found the overall story to be pretty good (the origin of the rats, constructors (although I feel the whole Felicity arc was pointless as far as TPS' story is concerned), threshers, why jack wears a mask, etc...) but other than, kinda meh. The only character I liked (Gladstone) was killed off and I hated every environment. At least the gun vendors weren't worthless this time around.  I didn't care for the claptastic voyage DLC. It dragged on for too long with far too much backtracking. I resorted to using a trainer for super speed, infinite health/shield and ammo due to all the padding.  The laser guns were cool."

Borderlands,39aurk,Daemmerung,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"While I like Minac's atonement , the DPS is strictly poorer than other laser weapons, and the random element means you're never fully using an elemental advantage over your target. Go find the Heartful Splodger."

Borderlands,39aurk,Pyrex11,2,Wed Jun 10 22:51:08 2015 UTC,"Except that it isn't like Lascaux, Gwen's Head, or (formerly) Bullpup since you can only get it once.

Borderlands,39adjk,kwprules,18,Wed Jun 10 11:59:58 2015 UTC,"Basically this Tediore Shield works just like the Tediore Guns, instead you throw it when your shield is depleted and do some minimal damage... like really small...  You know there is something wrong with this Shield when it takes the OP8 version about 3 minutes to kill a level 15 Wilhelm. It is for me, the worst Legendary in the game by far.  The Cradle comes back in the Pre-Sequel as the Cradle.  I have no build recommendation, no use for this really bad Shield. Sell it, grind it, throw it off a cliff but do NOT use this Shield (also as a chance to kill you, huzzah hurrah?)."
Borderlands,39adjk,MeleeKimy,9,Wed Jun 10 12:11:16 2015 UTC,"Bad. Well, not truly terrible, it just has terrible scaling. Right up till level 20 or so it has a little utility to go with it's novelty. Really the novelty of the thing is quite fun, and it's a good concept poorly executed. Well, I suppose if you were doing a Tediore Allegiance Run and this dropped, and it was on level, and you didn't have a Tediore quick charge shield (which is pretty great, mind you), you might be able to justify equipping it.  I'm not an expert on Shield parts, but generally I look for low Delay, High charge rate. Since this scales so poorly, it's not really worth tracking down with specific parts. No. Absolutely not. You're better off ""farming"" the Cracked Sash (which isn't even the best quick charge shield) while killing chubbies/tubbies. Or, and this is just a suggestion, use ANY OTHER LEGENDARY SHIELD. Even the Whiskey Tango Foxtrot has redeeming qualities."
Borderlands,39adjk,meh_mediocre,2,Wed Jun 10 12:37:07 2015 UTC,"but generally I look for low Delay, High charge rate.   These shield are surprisingly terrible since the game functions off of health gate not shield gate."

Borderlands,39adjk,meh_mediocre,7,Thu Jun 11 11:00:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the gentler TPS damage/health scaling curve will give this joker any more utility than it has in BL2.  I just bought one for my close-quarters level 62 Wilhelm, and will give it a go.  For science.  edit:  All right!  Because I Love You Guys™, I gave it a spin.  Level 62 Crushing Obliterator, testing against the tork waves at the entrance to the Titan Industrial Park or whatever it's called.  Level 62 Warming The Cradle, capacity 11620 rate 22544 delay 4.48.  (Pretty close to the worst delay possible on a Cradle. The RNG loves me.)  Empirically, this shield's base damage without any explosive, grenade, or BAR buffs was 12400.  (For comparison, a white-rarity level 62 Lobbed Grenade of Scav manufacture does roughly three times that.)  12400 was enough to kill a common-tier tork at level 50 (!) IF you caught the tork close to the center of the grenade's blast.  Against leveled enemies in UVHM (62-63 Tork Hordlings and Wiry Torks), this nicked about a quarter of their health.  I replaced my Meteor Slam-friendly Juggernaut ozkit with a Bomber, enabled my BAR bonuses, and gave it another go.  Still took three Cradle discharges to kill a Tork.  The character in question wasn't spec'd into Kinetic Armor-- another skill that benefits from Bomber, and stacks well with Obliterator's base health buff, and has truly disappointing damage in UVHM-- it is possible that Cradle plus KA might synergize to be slightly less lame than either of them individually.  Against trash-tier opponents, yeah, easily cleared with slams or the side blasts from Vengeance Cannon, which was operative full-time during this test for obvious reasons.  I might move Divert Power into Emergency Response and then run this shield as a full-time shields-depleted-bonuses character with a silly gimmick: it turns into a game of its own, directing the arc of that underpowered mini-grenade.  Maybe.  Need to finish level 5 of the spike and nova challenges first.  P.S.  As a reward for my midday virtue, one of the Hordling/Wiry/whatever torks dropped a Mongol.  Yay!  edit 2: What was I thinking?  Kinetic Armor makes a bad thing worse."
Borderlands,39adjk,Daemmerung,6,Wed Jun 10 15:54:45 2015 UTC,"It's a good shield... when you're below level 10. By the time you reach Henry, the boss from which the shield is dropped, you'll be way past the point at which the shield is useful. When depleted, the shield gets 'thrown away' at the enemy and the damage done by that is laughable. A standard purple Tediore shield outclasses The Cradle in terms of usability.  By the way, the only reason anyone will be farming Henry is for the heads she drops, not the shield."
Borderlands,39adjk,lurklar,3,Wed Jun 10 12:53:12 2015 UTC,"I just don't know what they were thinking with this.  Even with all Hyperion parts, its delay is still nearly 2 seconds, so it can't possibly be flung as quickly as a shotgun will fire.  It's chucked like a grenade, rather than exploding like a nova, but it does a paltry amount of damage compared to a grenade.  Sure, it will recharge completely as soon as its delay is up, but any Tediore shield will do that, and purples will do it with a shorter delay and a higher capacity.  So it's a Close Quarters Combat shield, but its capacity and delay are too slow to be a tanking shield, and it's damage isn't good enough to be an aggressive shield.  So I really just don't know what character would want this shield."
Borderlands,39adjk,cannons_for_days,3,Wed Jun 10 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly kind of pissed that this is the legendary explosive nova shield and not the Deadly Bloom or Love Thumper (although the Bloom is sort of legendary). Sure, it gets grenade damage, but even with it it's crap. Not worth it on Axton, Claptrap or even Jack. Maybe if you used Krieg with 11/5 Fuel the Blood and as much explosive damage as possible on a deathmarked enemy it could be worthwhile, but at that point you're putting in too much work. It's often considered the worst shield in the game, and for good reason. The WTF gets a lot of shit for similar reasons, but at least it can be used effectively with the proper build and playstyle."
Borderlands,39adjk,brandpanz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:16:33 2015 UTC,"I'd call Deadly Bloom the legendary explosive nova shield.  Its code (GD_Shields.A_Item.Shield_Nova_Explosive_05_DeadlyBloom) looks like a legendary (the 05), and it appears in legendary loot pools, even if its coloration and its mission-reward status all suggest unique.  I like to imagine that it and Flame of the Firehawk somehow swapped colors.  Cradle is the legendary ""standard"" (Tediore) shield.  What hurts is that it suffers such a enormous penalty to its recharge delay statistic.  A purple-rarity Tediore shield with equivalent parts has less than half the recharge delay of the legendary version.  There's a substantial penalty to the legendary's capacity as well.  If those attributes weren't nerfed so hard on Cradle, we could use it in the standard Quick Shield niche."

Borderlands,399dhi,Weltall548,28,Wed Jun 10 05:01:00 2015 UTC,"(Spoilers for BL2 and TPS)  Three things come to mind:   One: I feel like one of the main issues was that there wasn't a true main villain progression in TPS. In BL2, you're introduced to Jack early on. Not only is he the bad guy who tried to kill you, but he also cracks jokes and makes fun of the player consistently. The writers ran with that, developing Jack's character with further dialogue, his actions, and (later) audio logs, while making the player grow to hate Jack more and more as they played. The story has a twist, some rising action, and a clear resolution.  TPS has Zarpedon. The writers went out of their way to make her seem intimidating and to remind us over and over that the moon was gonna blow up - that was the player's motivation to keep fighting, to beat her. But in the end, it never really felt that intimidating. The interactions with Zarpedon were forgettable.   In the end, she's even portrayed as good. If you do the Zarpedon secret room mission in Pity's Fall, you find out that she was actually well loved by her crew, and she seems like a person who has integrity. Later audio logs reveal that she's destroying the moon to save humanity from a greater evil.  And that's okay. You can have nuanced ""villains."" However, if the player was meant to feel sorry for Zarpedon and to feel some guilt for murdering her, it ended up being a stale experience, because we as the player never really experienced enough of Zarpedon's character to really relate to her. The whole thing felt just ""meh.""   If the end goal was supposed to be that the player turned out to be the villain, and Zarpedon was the hero, then we as the players needed more opportunities to truly experience this. The game presents one choice to the player - whether to kill a Dahl soldier or not. Everything else that could be considered ""evil"" was done by Jack - the player was just along for the ride. The players need to have the agency here - they are the ones committing the evil acts -otherwise it's not personal and the whole experience is stale. One of my best experiences with this kind of thing was playing Knights of the Old Republic and following the Dark Side - the choices you made there had actual meaning for the player.  Two: Awkward pacing - TPS has the climactic fight with Zarpedon, but instead of ending there, you have to go through a whole other area before the final fight. This made the fight with Zarpedon seem a lot less meaningful than the final Jack fight in BL2.   There are also some seriously dialogue-heavy moments in TPS that aren't meshed well with gameplay. The primary offender being when you meet Gladstone, and are forced to wait for several minutes while he's brought up to speed on everything you've been doing over the last few hours.   Three: Beyond the main storyline, BL2 has tons of side quests that reveal more of the NPCs we encounter. There are multiple quests for pretty much every named NPC, and some quests even come in chains - the Zafford/Hodunk feud being the prime example. These really flesh out the story for us. Contrast that with TPS, where there are very few named NPCs to begin with (it's basically Pickle, Springs, Nakayama, and Nina), and most missions are one-and-done affairs. I didn't feel nearly as attached to these characters as I did to the ones in BL2."

Borderlands,399dhi,Making_stuff,2,Wed Jun 10 19:31:46 2015 UTC,Can't answer everything but the main point of plot is to stop the moon from exploding. However when jack is betrayed multiple times you see the road which leads him to becoming such a great villain. That's really where all the writing went. I mean too was an add on from the start but so much time went into it they decided to make it a bigger dlc which then turned into a standalone.

You can do all the missions in TVHM but you wont go much higher than maybe 52 or so. When you start UVHM you will be able to do everything again, and you will gain EXP and levels as normal."
Borderlands,398ofc,StiffCrustySock,7,Wed Jun 10 01:46:20 2015 UTC,To elaborate a little further uvhm scales to your level. Tvhm wont drop loot higher than level 50. So if you continued to level normally you could start uvhm at say 55 with 50 gear and have a hard time of it.
Borderlands,398ofc,magisky,2,Wed Jun 10 02:28:22 2015 UTC,EXactly.  It would be a much bigger problem in Blands 2 than TPS because of scaling but point remains.  It is by design and necessary.

(If you want it on at all - you can just leave it off, if you don't care.)  Don't know if this is what's going on for you specifically, but it's happened to other folks that way."

Borderlands,39443n,NUGGman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:15:58 2015 UTC,This method of getting unlimited golden keys was patched when they added cross save support.  This was the fastest way to do it.  You can still do it by copying your profile save file to cloud or a usb drive then copying back to the system after you've used keys.  Takes longer because you have to reboot the game.
Borderlands,3945cb,BrettemesMaximus,9,Tue Jun 9 03:13:06 2015 UTC,Just compare the damage to one of your guns.  That much of a level difference though probably isn't that good.  The Bee is an amp shield meaning it adds damage to your guns.  A regular amp shield you would lose some of your shield and then have to wait for it to recharge to full to get that extra amp damage again.  The reason The Bee is good is because you keep firing that extra amp damage with no cost to your shield as long as you yourself don't take any damage.  The reason people like it is because it's basically more damage for your character but as a shield itself it's actually a pretty shitty shield.
Borderlands,3945cb,shamus4mwcrew,2,Tue Jun 9 03:23:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it only adds 7k to my base gun damage, so nothing really CRAZY special about it..."
Borderlands,3945cb,Adasafa,3,Tue Jun 9 12:04:50 2015 UTC,"... No.  I grabbed a bee from Hunter Hellquist when I hit level 44 because I was having trouble in TVHM.  It did... literally nothing.  Look at how much damage your guns do, then look at the amp damage from The Bee, and then do a rough estimate of what % of your damage The Bee does."
Borderlands,3945cb,Adasafa,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:23:56 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I didn't know if it was one of those things that ""lied"" about it's stats and just did ridiculous boosts to your damage or not"
Borderlands,3945cb,Adasafa,3,Tue Jun 9 12:04:18 2015 UTC,"The reason The Bee was almost worshiped back in the day was because it was utterly broken.  If you had a x13 shotgun, it added the amp damage (all amp shields did) to every single pellet.  So, a Bee with +2k damage would do +26k on that x13 shotgun.  That combined with its 0 amp drain made The Bee the go-to shield for a lot of players."
Borderlands,3945cb,Adasafa,2,Tue Jun 9 14:11:46 2015 UTC,Wow! No wonder it was such a big deal pre-nerf!
Borderlands,3945cb,Myozunitonirun,2,Tue Jun 9 15:11:06 2015 UTC,Yeah.  The conference call just... eviscerated everything pre-nerf thanks to that.  It does 1/7 the damage with The Bee now than it did then.
Borderlands,3945cb,ithinkPOOP,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"Wow that's insane. Are there any legendaries that are still really worth going for/worth it for the damage output and whatnot? Or are they more for people going for a level of ""completion""?"
Borderlands,3945cb,mujump,2,Tue Jun 9 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to farm, yes.  If you just want to do the story, no.  One gun that's praised is the Double Penetrating Unkempt Harold (DPUH).  It has high damage, and I think it's still broken with The Bee (might be wrong there).  With other characters you'll farm different weapons, though.  Hide of Terramorphous for melee characters, a Rough Rider for Salvador, a Lyuda for snipers, Sham for Norfleets, Norfleets because it's a norfleet...  Depends on you.  If you want to put the time in, it's well worth getting these legendaries for the purpose of end-game.  If you don't plan on playing much once you beat the game, I wouldn't bother.  Edit: Links & The Rough Rider isn't legendary, it's unique."
Borderlands,3945cb,NeoZenith1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:30:35 2015 UTC,Well thanks for all your input! I'll definitely take it into consideration once I think about farming and whatnot. Hopefully find something worthwhile
Borderlands,3945cb,Kris_Sipper,2,Tue Jun 9 23:19:15 2015 UTC,"Probably not.  I have a Bee only 11 levels lower than me and I rarely use it (It is level 50. Pssst. If you want, you can have it). I don't think I can afford to have such a small capacity in UVHM and The Bee has no real use in the other modes."
Borderlands,3945cb,SoundWolves,2,Tue Jun 9 06:44:38 2015 UTC,"If you plan on having multiple play throughs with different characters i'd hold on to it just for when those characters are around that level. It's a pretty awesome shield if you're good at not taking too much damage. But it's only good for about 5-7 levels i'd say. I'm weird though, i farmed for new legendary gear every 10 levels or so and now whenever i want a new character, i just transfer my old legendaries/good guns to my new characters through claptraps locker in sanctuary. Makes leveling to 50 a whole lot easier in my opinion."

Borderlands,394ojh,imranh101,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:08:08 2015 UTC,"Well if you wanna get to end-game, just power through TVHM. Do all the high-EXP missions and get to level 50. Then farm a couple of key weapons and dive straight into UVHM. Remember, you can always go back to normal mode and smash through the barroom brawl to get enough tokens for the Torgue vending machine, then go back to UVHM to spend them."

Borderlands,390ods,kwprules,13,Mon Jun 8 11:43:39 2015 UTC,"On the whole it's a very good weapon. Top gear for most characters who use snipers. The unlisted pellets get amp damage from the bee. Rate of fire is excellent. Recoil is low, and damage is respectable. Big crit bonus. Only problem is it eats through sniper ammo ""like whoa."" Maya is the first who springs to mind, although it's ease of use means that it's a good fit for just about any character. Zer0 obviously has good affinity with Sniper rifles, so he'll appreciate this one as well.  Dahl Stock (as usual), Matching grip (Vladof), and either Crit Damage (rarez) or Extra Damage (gromky) accessory. Scope comes down to personal preference. Element is whatever you need. Fire and Corrosive are best. Yeah. The farm is pretty easy, and can be combined with other routes (spiderants and black queen)."
Borderlands,390ods,meh_mediocre,5,Mon Jun 8 12:07:09 2015 UTC,We landed a slag variety that was spectacular for the latter playthroughs.  You could fire into a crowd from a safe distance until you got the damage multiplier and engage to rip them apart.  Best part was you could spam it if the elemental effect didn't take on the first hit.
Borderlands,390ods,Venusaurus_Rex,2,Mon Jun 8 12:43:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, anything that has slag and shoots multiple bullets is usually a good bet. I'd be a little warry of slagging with a sniper due to the lower ammo, but with a stockpile relic it would be pretty viable."

Borderlands,390ods,Venusaurus_Rex,4,Mon Jun 8 13:34:49 2015 UTC,THat also works.  Playing with a Florentine made me forget how much I loved having ammo regen on Roland in BL1.

Borderlands,390ods,Venusaurus_Rex,3,Mon Jun 8 14:02:48 2015 UTC,"What else would you recommend farming on that route, and how do you go about it?"
Borderlands,390ods,JebusMcAzn,7,Mon Jun 8 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'd do;   Start at the back of Ellie's Garage. Head into the Valley area and take the high road (on the Left). Then drop down. This route seems to have a decent chance of a Tubby Spiderant (and therefore some good COMS) appearing. When you get to the area where the left hand side will take you up to the graveyard, check to see if the black queen appears. If she does, kill her for a chance at the Nukem (one of the best second wind launchers around). Head up the Path and fight Gettle and Mobley. This gives you a chance at the Veruc and the Lyuda. OPTIONAL: If you jump down from the cliff where you fight them, and you've already completed the clan war sidequest, you can grab a car and take it to Lynchwood station to kill that mob for a chance at the Maggie or Slagga.     It's not as fast as farming these individually, but it can break out up the repetitiveness a little bit. Especially since the Black Queen doesn't always spawn."
Borderlands,390ods,meh_mediocre,9,Mon Jun 8 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"Because I find Goliaths a game in themselves, this farm never grew repetitive for me.  I always lurked around the Black Queen's bandit camp, goading and supporting the Goliaths until they grew up big and strong.  (I avoided spiderant fights on the way up the Gulch, too, in case I needed more Goliath chow.)  Once I had a GOD, we'd go to church together.  A touching family scene, really."
Borderlands,390ods,Daemmerung,6,Mon Jun 8 17:01:30 2015 UTC,"You missed one, it's also pretty easy to hit McNally for the Hammer Buster on that route (not that anybody uses the Hammer Buster). He spawns at a little shack between the Hodunk Speedway and the Buzzard's Nest, best route is to loop around after you hit the Lynchwood train station."
Borderlands,390ods,FrozenSeas,4,Mon Jun 8 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea. A little out of the way, but if you're a Jakobs aficionado, it's worth the kill.  Plus you can do it from the car with a Bee for lulz."
Borderlands,390ods,meh_mediocre,4,Mon Jun 8 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"One of the Gwen's Head spawn points is there, too, IIRC.  Does any other map have anything even close to the farming yield of The Dust?  Closest competitor I can recall at the moment is Frostburn Canyon, with HellFire/Pyrophobia/Neogenator plus countless loot midgets."
Borderlands,390ods,Daemmerung,4,Mon Jun 8 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"Wildlife Exploitation Preserve is up there. Pimon and Tumbaa, LLMs, and then Son of Mothrakk. Plus a total of 3 Hyperion Chests (that I can remember)."
Borderlands,390ods,meh_mediocre,8,Mon Jun 8 20:25:13 2015 UTC,"The second best sniper rifle in BL2 behind the Pimpernel and its very easy to see why. High fire rate, good damage, nice critical hit bonus and large magazine for a sniper as well as unlisted projectiles getting full amp damage. It's great for Zer0 due to his affinity for sniper rifles. Every other character can also make good use of the Lyuda.  Overall, there really isn't much to say about the Lyuda apart from that it's the second best sniper rifle in BL2 and that is very well earned.  In TPS, the closest weapon to the Lyuda would have to be the Longnail (note: I mean that the Longnail succeeds the Lyuda as the Legendary Vladof sniper rifle in TPS)."
Borderlands,390ods,lurklar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:41:30 2015 UTC,"The Longnail is crap, it's literally just a Vladof Trespasser. A Droog will outperform it in nearly every situation."
Borderlands,390ods,brandpanz,2,Mon Jun 8 13:10:24 2015 UTC,"Longnail on Aurelia puts in work. Vladof trespasser with an important distinction, fire rate. You can use that thing like an AR to burn through bosses bypassing shields and scoring I never miss multipliers along the way."
Borderlands,390ods,_darkwingduck_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"If you need Aurelia to make a sniper good the sniper was never that good in the first place. Vladof's distinction is fire rate anyway, that's what the ""Vladof"" part of the whole ""Vladof Trespasser"" thing covers.  There's one situation I can think of where it will outperform a Droog or some other regular high-quality Vladof sniper: Deadlift. Maybe EOS too. Aside from that you're sacrificing DPS for some stupid gimmick. It was fine on Mordecai because it was a skill, not so much with Trespasser/Longnail."
Borderlands,390ods,brandpanz,2,Wed Jun 10 00:07:46 2015 UTC,"I agree its niche, but not useless. Wrecks bosun while he's chillin in his bubble and drops sentinel as well. And yes it does destroy deadlift coz his health doesnt even exist. Wouldn't use it on any other class, so I'm just pointing out where it actually is viable."
Borderlands,390ods,_darkwingduck_,2,Wed Jun 10 00:28:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's useless, just that it pales in comparison to other purple, pink and orange snipers. Bosun's shield is weak anyway, I can easily take it down as Wilhelm with corrosive shotguns (which is a very low DPS combination in comparison to what we're talking about here with Aurelia). Sentinel's is beefier but again not big enough to make a difference from using a Droog or Snider. While the Longnail is still better than your average Hyperion sniper, by Vladof standards it's rather underpowered."
Borderlands,390ods,brandpanz,6,Wed Jun 10 00:33:02 2015 UTC,"Hell yes this is worth farming-- and this is coming from a non-farmer-- because its farm is extraordinarily entertaining.  I would run the Bug Gulch / Boot Hill corridor even without the promise of legendary goodies.  Charging up to the churchyard with a pet GOD-Liath in tow is one of the most satisfying things in the game for me.  It's also a highly rewarding farm.  Veruc, Nukem, and the Chubby loot pool all come with the package."
Borderlands,390ods,Daemmerung,2,Mon Jun 8 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"I was doing this the other day, only because I wanted the Lyuda.  Did not care about the other stuff.  On about 50 runs I only got two chubbies and no Lyuda, but this is the crazy part, I got 4 Verucs and the Gwen's head did not spawn in Ellie's once in that 50 runs (20% chance).  RNG is crazy."
Borderlands,390ods,checo70x7,7,Tue Jun 9 00:15:27 2015 UTC,"Works great with Critical Ascension due to the low recoil and high fire rate, making it easy to score critical hits in quick succession. Great for both mobbing and raiding with Zero."
Borderlands,390ods,Xyanite,4,Mon Jun 8 19:05:58 2015 UTC,"Amazing weapon.  A sniper rifle that can be used like an assault rifle due to its hire fire rate, desirable capacity, and decent reload times.  Best part is that it doesn't require any specific builds to shine. However, Zer0's sniper tree may have some skills that could complement the weapon but his greatest sniper rifle is still the pimpernel with his b0re skill.  I would farm this weapon for the other character classes if you like to run a sniper in one of your slots for ranged encounters but still wish to have a versatile combat ready weapon in all 4 of your slots."
Borderlands,390ods,Venusaurus_Rex,4,Mon Jun 8 12:36:51 2015 UTC,"This was one of the first legendaries I got in PT1, maybe even the first. I had a fire Zammechat White Death - it just destroyed everything, even Constructors, for a good 10 levels or so. When I started levelling up and shedding older weapons it was the only one I kept on principle."
Borderlands,390ods,SweetboyRomero,3,Mon Jun 8 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"Top tier sniper, one of my favorites. It's my go-to weapon on my main Maya, and it has excellent synergy with her. Combined with a Bee+Phaselock/Ruin it can achieve easy 1-2 shot kills on most basic bandits. Even Badass enemies fall with less than five crits, and crits are easy to hit on Phaselocked enemies.  Overall, a great sniper, really shines on Maya and Zer0, but can be used by almost any class."

It's really his tanking ability that lets him stand out from the rest rather than his killing ability.  Although I'm hoping that GBX will change Venom Bolts so that it buffs all corrosive damage rather than just DoTs. That could give Wilhelm his own niche in terms of guns (sort of).
Borderlands,3934r6,ETA30seconds,3,Mon Jun 8 22:29:57 2015 UTC,Someone asked the same question earlier today .. I'd suggest you jump into TVHM right now and do the DLC then.

Borderlands,392ssc,MiamiVicePD,2,Mon Jun 8 22:49:36 2015 UTC,"I recommend Mania while leveling, because in Normal and TVHM, enemies don't deal nearly enough damage for the detrimental downside of not having a gun being impactful. Spec into Release the Beast and just melee everything to death and regen to full health for every kill."
Borderlands,392ssc,TheBlackOyster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:58:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like he's more of an end game character, so what you might want to pick while leveling up will be different from when you have a certain amount of skill points. I started on the Mania tree with Feed the Meat and Fuel the Rampage.  I kinda hope I'm just wrong and someone can give better advice."
Borderlands,392ssc,Myozunitonirun,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:11:05 2015 UTC,"Krieg is my primary. Here is how I have him specced. I play him primarily melee. I do have the skills that extend the BAR but if you know how to play him it isn't an issue. I normally hit for 1 -2 million. Also if you use melee, especially BAR a lot find a sickle mod that give plus 3 or 4 silence the voices.  550 percent damage buff and only a 12 percent chance at hitting yourself. As a point of interest, I didn't us STV uni I had the sickle mod. If I'm going to risk hitting myself I'm going to get the most out of it is the logic I use.  http://bl2skills.com/psycho.html#50500014251050500005155100000000000  Krieg can be very squishy starting out but I've played through tvhm and I've only died maybe 10 times through the whole original campain, mostly against one on one bosses.  I also don't use light the fuse. I used to when i first started, it saved my ass so many times,  but in my experience it loses its effectiveness after lvl 30 or 35. Only my opinion though  Until you get release the beast, I did find thrill of the kill and fuel the rampage highly useful. Helps the cool down and keeping you in BAR as much as possible"

Borderlands,392ssc,Adam_Absence,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:21:00 2015 UTC,"Krieg is my primary and I've played him on both 360 and PS4. I found that low levels benefit from a mix of Mania and Bloodlust, but since Normal mode enemies have fewer shields and armor, I like to take advantage of the Hellborn tree if possible - after getting some gear like Flame of the Firehawk and the Heartbreaker.  Also, once you get Law/Order you'll be unstoppable for quite a while."
Borderlands,392ssc,BilateralFaceTime,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:26:31 2015 UTC,"I see a lot about Silence the Voices here, but I don't see mention of its most important mechanic in my opinion: no matter high high you have ranked into the skill, whether it be 1 or 11, hitting yourself does the same damage. If you spec into it, go all in with 5 points, more if you have a COM."
Borderlands,392ssc,Adasafa,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:27:07 2015 UTC,"Either go Bloodlust or Mania, depending on how you feel comfortable.  If one isn't working out, respec.  Link.  Just included both of the trees I use in one link.  I'm not a huge fan of StV, 'cuz blindness is the best thing ever, so I don't spec into it.  You can spec into it, though."
Borderlands,392ssc,Venaetus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:10:40 2015 UTC,"I think the ""normal"" build is something like this. Mania first, then Bloodlust.  Silence the Voices is a bit of a controversial skill - 12% (static) chance to hit yourself whenever you melee, for +50% melee damage per level. The self-damage doesn't scale with most melee damage buffs, the self-hit chance doesn't increase with points, and it's a crazy damage buff, so the general consensus is usually that it's worth it.  Light The Fuse is only worth it at higher levels. Skip it till UVHM or so. The damage it does scales with your level. Take it when you're a higher level and have explosive damage bonuses. Worth noting that with this skill, you can run towards teammates in coop for easy reviving.  Thrill of the Kill is completely unneeded, once you get Release The Beast. Overkill damage doesn't matter in BAR because you always get healed to full anyways, and Release The Beast keeps you in BAR all the time.  Bloodbath is usually worth at least one point, just for the 15% grenade drop chance.  Blood Trance is bad to pick up - the increased Buzz Axe Rampage time means there's less uptime between Release The Beast uses, which usually just makes you die.  After Mania/Bloodlust, some people go into Hellborn for Numbed Nerves, and some just put more points into Bloodlust skills."
Borderlands,392ssc,Adasafa,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:37:51 2015 UTC,"I've tried it, and it just seems to irritate me.  The blindness effect is what makes it not worth it to me.  Light the Fuse isn't bad at lower levels, and I grabbed it because I needed points to get to RtB  Thrill of the Kill was grabbed because I needed the points.  Also helps before you get RtB.  Blood Trance has never caused me to die, honestly.  I think I went for Pain is Power with my Krieg, but that's probably because I never grabbed StV for very long."
Borderlands,392ssc,Muffinofrage,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:55:19 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd go with Bloodlust or Hellborn to start off, but as soon as you can get the capstone immediately respec to Mania. Insta-healing back to full and being able to constantly go into BAR made it so I rarely ever went into FFYL. After mania start going into Bloodlust and try to get it's capstone. Mania and Bloodlust together makes you almost invincible and everything you kill will explode making bosses with adds (like Terramorphus) just completely melt. Also if you do go bloodlust I'd like to suggest using only Vladof grenades and filling out the Blood Bath skill because you can just start tossing out grenades like confetti and gain stacks like crazy."
Borderlands,392ssc,blackmarketdolphins,0,Mon Jun 8 22:35:19 2015 UTC,Don't go down Mania first. You don't have many defensive skills and you'll die a lot. Bloodlust is by far the safest. I suggest holding of until you can get Mania capstone at level 31. It'll safe you the headache of dying all the time before you can even reach your target.
Borderlands,392ssc,pendragon2290,2,Tue Jun 9 01:08:22 2015 UTC,"That really isn't the case.  It depends on your play style.  Mania is Uber offensive. Leveling mania I just ran head first into the fray and started swinging.  To me,  its the ""the best defense is a f%! $#g awesome offense"" tree. Learn to play it and it's smooth sailing."
Borderlands,392ssc,blackmarketdolphins,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:36:02 2015 UTC,"He has no defensive skills until Salt the Wound. His movement bonuses are mediocre and the cooldown is pretty long unless you take Fuel the Rampage, which prevents you from being able to play MP or risk friendly fire. You WILL DIE a lot when you start off with Mania Krieg. I've been down that path, as well as many many others in this sub. Krieg is a walking bullet sponge and until you're able to properly tank it. His capstone can definitely offset his initial survivability issues. This is the why I would advise against starting with Mania.  I play solo in Normal with him, and suffered greatly at the hands of Loaders and Stalkers because he'd consistently get killed before he could even make contact. He has no ranged attacks outside of the tossed axe, which without the dynamite is a pain to use, especially on consoles. Krieg does scale amazingly well, but he has a slow start"
Borderlands,392ssc,pendragon2290,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:01:20 2015 UTC,"He really is squishy at the lower levels. But thrill of the kill and fuel the rampage along with light the fuse were brilliant. Though, leveling I didn't just melee like I do now. All my equipment buffed health, regeneration and shield. I didn't really notice me dying any more than I did with Sal. But stalkers are kriegs Achilles heel, and rakks. My opinion though"
Borderlands,392ssc,blackmarketdolphins,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"thrill of the kill and fuel the rampage along with light the fuse were brilliant.   Thrill is fine, but in Normal killing enemies outside of BAR wasn't as inconsistent, which is the only time it'll proc. I've already stated why I don't like Fuel, but Light the Fuse was always one of those skills that never grew on me. Krieg and Gaige were my last two characters, and by that time I had tons of loot grandfathered from previous playthroughs. I would always prefer to take a solid Second Wind weapon over LtF. Always.   I'm not saying Mania is bad, but starting with it provided me with one of the worst and aggravating leveling experiences ever. Nowadays, I find myself playing as melee Krieg on OP8 more than any other character."
Borderlands,391orb,TheWellets,2,Mon Jun 8 16:37:31 2015 UTC,"I would play them all in normal mode. I would do scarlett's and torgue's any time after lvl 15. I would do hammerlock's and tina's once you beat the main game.  I would pretty much skip them in TVHM as they can over level you and put you in a bad spot for UVHM. If you arent too far over lvl 50, maybe just farm the unique weapons to prep for UVHM  In UVHM i completed all DLCs once I hit 72 and it worked out great. You can stop your progress whenever if you want to farm mission rewards like the sandhawk as you progress through the OP levels"
Borderlands,391orb,slimjim72384,3,Mon Jun 8 17:18:49 2015 UTC,"By skipping side missions in TVHM, you should have enough slack in your experience budget (so to speak) to play the DLC in that playthrough if you want.

You can do the DLC on any mode (I did Scarlett and Torgue on my first runthrough).  If you're a melee character, it's a good idea to get the Rapier from Scarlett.  If you exist, it's a good idea to get the grog from Tiny Tina."
Borderlands,391orb,Adasafa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:13:24 2015 UTC,I'll keep this short and simple.  You can do whatever you want just make sure you beat the main story before or at level 50.  You do not want to enter UVHM  after level 50.

I took the point of the video to be a counter to the argument that only min/maxed legendary gear was sufficient for OP levels.  It is also why I included the caveat about Luke's ability and knowledge.  Not everyone can do that with white gear, even with perfect parts, running that fast to maintain CA stacks, I know I couldn't.  Early in the video, he did not have the stacks and that is when his gameplay is repeatable, even for a schleb like me. However, it is still white gear, with minimal damage, and mag size.  You are correct that someone who just ""found"" said gear would have much less to work with, I just don't see how that negates the ""point""."

I don't know why people put so much emphasis on getting the ""ideal"" gear. I have two high-level characters that got there fine without it. Sure, certain guns would've helped in some situations, but by no means is it impossible to do so. I think all that talk about legendaries is for people who want their character optimised, but I can tell you that it's fun enough (and doable) without it. Haven't done any OP levels, by the way."
Borderlands,38yrz2,Quentin_Coldwater,5,Mon Jun 8 00:40:00 2015 UTC,"These are the people who go for end-game content.  A lot of people go through the story mode, hit 72, and make a new character, never farming a single legendary.  I like farming, so I do it.  Was it necessary to get to 61?  Nah."
Borderlands,38yrz2,Adasafa,3,Mon Jun 8 02:01:12 2015 UTC,"It'll help if you do farm, but it's not necessary.  The only gun I'd ever recommend farming is a slag Pimpernel, and that's only because it slags like a motherf*cker.  It's more rare for slag to not happen.  If you have slag and a weapon that isn't 20 levels under you, you'll be fine.  One other thing you'll probably hear about is pt2.5.  Don't bother with it.  I've been through UVHM twice, and both times I said I'd do my side missions after I finished the story in TVHM.  I currently have nearly every single side mission unaccepted on TVHM.  You might need to farm a little bit as you hit walls getting through digipeak (what gives you OP levels) later on.  I've heard people say that OP4 is hard without gear.  When I say ""farm"" I mean ""open a chest until you get something better than green.""  Also, if you play as Sal on your first go, you may hate the game.  Sal's one of the harder VHs to level up.  You're constantly using 2 guns which have no synergy, which makes his AS kind of bunk.  He's still a powerhouse, just not that fun imo."
Borderlands,38yrz2,Adasafa,3,Mon Jun 8 01:59:53 2015 UTC,"I'd apply what you said about Sal to Krieg as well, which is quite amusing considering they are both arguably the strongest end game class."

Zer0 and Krieg are the two characters I love more than any other at this point."

I also tend to lose interest very fast if I happen to come across something I'm not going to replace, it just makes going through drops feel like a useless task and takes all the enjoyment of the game away from me :/"

But I've found a pretty healthy engaging upgrade pacing in my playthroughs without really farming any boss (except for a couple drops I really wanted to get perfect and chose to farm for)   Tl;dr lots of cool drops with better stuff dropping down the road so it didn't feel stagnant. But that is my experience. Rng will forever be a fickle mistress. Best of luck vault hunter!
Borderlands,38yrz2,_darkwingduck_,2,Mon Jun 8 18:40:54 2015 UTC,"I'm at 71 with Sal and I did both NVHM and TVHM without farming any specific items. In higher difficulties you may be somewhat tethered to a grog nozzle or slag rubi for healing with the zerker, but you can always go down his Brawn tree for heals/regen, there's always a way around sticking to the stock standard. You don't NEED a Harold, but once I got one things became laughably easy, that said there are plenty of alternatives. Lots of good mission reward items and if you stick with vladof pistols you can't go wrong.  tl;dr lots of different options to play zerker lots of fun combos to test."

Borderlands,38yrz2,hobowithabazooka,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:55:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone for the informative replies! Using the Rubi or the Nozzle on the offhand and keeping my other weapon free for whatever I find is definitely an alright compromise.  Would the Rubi make NVHM/TVHM too easy compared to using a random offhand? I suppose I'll see about that when I get to that, but I'd just like to have a decent idea of what I'll be doing as I finish up the last few loose ends in BL1 :)"
Borderlands,38yrz2,-Aviator-,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:34:36 2015 UTC,"You definitely don't need the rubi/grog offhand in normal and tvhm. Hell, my first playthrough as sal I went to 72 without knowing what any of the moxxi weapons did"
Borderlands,38yrz2,Daemmerung,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:41:32 2015 UTC,"OP levels will definitely be difficult (still doable) if you don't want to farm. Either use Gibbed save editor (which is what I did) to get the gear you want, or just don't bother with OP levels."
Borderlands,38yrz2,DaveSW777,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:42:20 2015 UTC,"You don't have to farm specific bosses for specific items if you don't want, not even at the highest difficulty levels.  You can farm chests just like you did in BL1.  Or you can farm loot midgets, who have an admirably broad loot pool.  (They're like the loot midgets in BL1's Secret Armory, only better.)  I ran my characters to OP7/OP8 with fairly random gear, a consequence of the fairly random way that I would upgrade kit as it lost effectiveness.  Sometimes that'd be Legendary, sometimes that wouldn't.  (My Axton had a blue-rarity Torgue AR in his final DP loadout.  All of the characters used plenty of purple.)  The important thing is to have it not be too underlevel, to have it synergize with the rest of your build, and to have enough diversity in your kit to handle the various challenges of Digistruct Peak (the DLC that grants OP levels).  The main thing that all of my OP-tier characters had in common was a Moxxi item in loadout, and a Legendary classmod in the endgame.  Almost all had Ancient relics, too, save my Hellborn who used a straightforward Fire relic.  The other thing that all of my endgame characters had in common: no Unkempt Harold, no Sand Hawk, no Pimpernel, no Fibber, no Flame of the Firehawk.  I would have used UH had one fallen during my gear refreshes, but I wasn't going to hump the Bar Brawl's leg to get one, let alone farm vending machines.  That's not fun to me.  The others are uniques: once my character outlevels them, I'm not going to reset my game or Gib to get another.  There are too many other weapons on Pandora that need good homes.  You will hear a lot of build advice that tells you to get one or more of these weapons.  Those builds certainly work, but they are not mandatory!  One other thing: the OP tier is really just a way to add endgame interest, turning up the difficulty curve until it breaks the game.  There is an enormous amount of game in BL2 without going there.  I didn't start a single OP tier until I had level-capped seven characters, and taken many others through multiple playthroughs.  You can safely ignore it for a very long time."
Borderlands,38yymw,origamania,6,Mon Jun 8 00:58:19 2015 UTC,"Decided to go with Gaige as I have the most experience with her and hate a lot of her skills, level 61: build  Weapon 1: Infinity (cannot be fired by a mechromancer who has smaller, lighter, faster, so basically a wasted item slot) Weapon 2: The Flakker Weapon 3: CHOPPER (non-elemental only) Weapon 4: Bane (non-elemental only)    Shield: Whisky Tango Foxtrot Class mod: Peppy Zapper Relic: Vault hunter's relic  Anarchy but no ricochet on bullets, elemental bonuses, but none of the elemental proccing skills or elemental weapons apart from the whisky tango foxtrot which can also damage the user. Deathtrap gets a few boosts but none of his REALLY powerful skills, whilst robbing Gaige of anything useful (as the melee boost is pointless with no weapons with melee attachments and no digi-claws). Death from above is shitty as it procs constantly on slopes and robs you of anarchy stacks. Considered putting in more points to drain anarchy faster, but I'm not sure if having less stacks is a bad thing when you've got no ricochet.

All non-elemental banes, whisky tango foxtrot, lobbed crossfire, SOTCOM, Terra relic.  Have fun.  Edit: Didn't realize there's a prize.  I'm not on PC, don't pick me!"
Borderlands,38yymw,brandpanz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"Most of Krieg's skills are either amazing for one playstyle but total crap for another. Taste of Blood, for example, is a melee staple but completely useless for gun-only builds.  Also ARs have an advantage on Krieg because there's a higher percentage of them that can proc Blood Bath than with other weapon types (save launchers of course)."
Borderlands,38yymw,Adasafa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"... People use Krieg for guns?  I'll use a Torgue AR if I need a few 'nades, that's about it.  Other than that, 3 rapiers merged into a Rubi.  Or 3 rapiers merged into a rapier.  I played legit until I hit 61, I swear!  It's mostly Torgue ARs.  Actually, isn't it all explosive weapons that do it if you shoot at their feet?  Seems like it would be."
Borderlands,38yymw,brandpanz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:09:31 2015 UTC,"Gun Krieg is definitely viable; in fact, by OP8 it's guns that ends up winning out over melee.  You're forgetting the Torgue barrel ARs, which will always proc BB, and can be non-explosive (save for Jakobs and Torgue). Maliwan pistols can proc too, but they're not as good for it due to having lower splash damage.  Also not all explosive weapons can proc it; Flakker, Cobra and SWORDSPLOSION's main sword(s) can't."

He really isn't the best end-game farmer.  He's fun as all hell, one of the best speed-runners, and one of the more balanced characters (this is why he has little raiding potential).  Same with Maya, honestly.  She's in the same boat.  Fun to level, not fun to raid."
Borderlands,38z7ce,Adasafa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:16:59 2015 UTC,i stopped playing my gunzerker because raid bosses became more of a daily farm than a raid boss. thats why im leveling up Axton to make it a challenge

Borderlands,38yq1m,MajesticQ,4,Sun Jun 7 23:47:12 2015 UTC,"I utterly loathed the first book.  Didn't continue the punishment by trying the second.  Author apparently watched the first fifteen minutes of a playthrough, requested a list of names of creatures and weapons in the game, then spliced that onto a standard science-fiction trope story.  I wasn't expecting enemies to spew numbers when shot, or Roland to ponder his skillpoint allocation, but I did want some sense of the world being the game's world.  Consistent lore and all that."
Borderlands,38yq1m,Daemmerung,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:43:28 2015 UTC,Just finished the first book and...I was looking for some Roland action but received a Family Reunion. I'm kinda disappointed so book two and three will probably not be in my next-to-read list for now.
Borderlands,38yq1m,Mechanatrix,3,Wed Jun 10 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"It was an alright book- but it holds little value canon wise, as the author probably didn't even play the game (or it didn't seem like it)."
Borderlands,38yq1m,XStreamGamer247,2,Sun Jun 7 23:58:02 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the Gunsight/Unconquered saga. They had interesting characters, and one of the coolest characters in the Borderlands Universe, Daphne Kuller, just because of her backstory alone. The main antagonists in both books are no slouches either when it comes to character designs, and even minor characters tend to stand out because of the little signature ""Things"" that John Shirley gave them; each person just had a personality or visual quirk to make them memorable.  The books are more like Borderlands 1 than Bl:2/TPS, in the sense that they're more gritty and serious looks at the world, with comedy being more ""cocky action hero"" than ""reference based, laugh out loud jokes""; so if you're reading them for that aspect- you'll be very disappointed.  They also get a bit cheesy with references to the first game and attempts to seem ""cool"" that just fall flat. Most of these are relegated to the prologue and epilogue though, and it's pretty obvious that they were shoehorned in by someone who hasn't played the games, but wants to seem like they did.  I'm pretty easy to please, but overall, I'd give Unconquered a 7.5-8 because of the great pacing and attempts at a realistic approach to the Borderlands universe. Gunsight on the other hand, a 6 or 7 at best. The story felt unnecessary and threw in a secondary antagonist, seemingly for no reason other than to add a secondary plot point. It just didn't fit and came out of nowhere- but not in a good way.  It's kind of a shame that the books aren't canon anymore though, all 3 books had fantastic characters that would have made for great bosses or even Vault Hunters, and supporting characters that I would have loved to see return in future games to sort of check in on them; but after you read the books, you can sort of see where they worked elements of some characters and events into other Borderlands games like Lilith in BL2 being similar to Daphne in Unconquered, and how the plot of TFtBL is similar to Extra's backstory in Gunsight."
