I decided the best way to do this was to use Google Forms, and to start with having everyone vote for their favorite songs to decide seeding position. For the selection of songs to choose from, I included everything on their three albums, ""NSFW"", ""Strawberries and Cream"", and ""Attitude City"", besides the intro and outros, as those are technically not songs. That leaves us with 35 songs to choose from. Since this is an odd number, the least popular song will be dropped, and we will start a tournament bracket from the remaining 34 songs.   You can vote for as many songs as you would like in this round, as the more data I have for seed placement, the better. From then on though, it will be song vs. song! I will leave voting on this open for one week, at which point we will start the tournament bracket. Happy voting!"

So when I bought the bundle I really only bought the Intro, Outro, 6969 (TBH the whole cost of the album is worth this one song), Cookies!, SAP, Buttsex Goldilocks, and Dubstep.

NinjaSexParty,3dw3gd,SaebraK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"yes but he also makes claims in 6969, since no video is out yet. It's all relative to the situation. We can also assume that none of the other things happen since they don't seem interlinked in any way whatsoever, other than danny/brian being there.  Another example would be if we were super gay. he never says they have sex, and he enever implies that anyone is having sex other than brian.  Plus, a lot of the songs are exaggerated. Samurai Abstinence patrol is exaggerated to the point where danny rips a hole in space time, yet he still claims to be sexing it up at the time.  i'll give you why I cry, but only for the reason that it is implied to be a projection of the (possible) future."

NinjaSexParty,3dv699,Actilide,4,Sun Jul 19 19:58:55 2015 UTC,"I do absolutely think that SAP and the Council of Dick Elders are related, somehow.  Judging from the fact that SAP only has two members that we know of - Arin and Barry - in the actual song itself, it could be that Arin and Barry are the originators and the Council is SAP after it has expanded its power(s).   In ""6969,"" the Elders specifically say ""they'll break our thousand-year spell"" -- does that mean that they are using actual magic to enforce their no-nookie/human touch policy or are they referring more to the political sway they hold over 6969's version of Earth?  Either way, from the sounds of it, they came into their primary strength and have been essentially overlords of Earth since 5969.  Also, it's hard to say whether Danny is immortal or not because Dan hasn't really gone into it in the songs, but the videos themselves show us that there's definitely something up with him - he's survived countless assasination attempts from Ninja Brian, including being thrown off a cliff (which would be enough to kill most normal individuals dead, but Danny is simply temporarily incapacitated and is actually still able to speak by the time NB makes his way to the bottom to shoot him with the second unnecessary poison dart -- it's almost like Ninja Brian knows that the fall isn't going to be enough to finish Danny off, so he has to take extra precautions - plus, it's further characterization that NB is just a ginormous douche).  There's also a possibility that since Danny built the time machine space ship (a modified/improved upon version of the guitar ship from ""Road Trip""?) that he and Ninja Brian aren't immortal or ageless, per se, but just keep hopping around in time, so they always appear to be the same age they are within the ship.  Welp!  I've got a looooooooot more thoughts about this, but my lunch break is almost over.  I do have tomorrow off, though, so I'll get to scribbling my thoughts down this evening sometime. :D"
NinjaSexParty,3dv699,bloopyreggaejamz,3,Sun Jul 19 20:30:23 2015 UTC,"Two thoughts:  It's my theory that, while not conventionally immortal, Danny is a really lazy ninja who only ever mastered one technique, a variation of the ""Kawarimi no Jutsu"" or body replacement technique. When in mortal danger, he switches places with an unconvincing doll dressed in his clothes. So, while not immortal, he can survive a lot of shit.  AND  Your last idea that they're jumping around in time seems the most interesting, and if that's the case then the simplest interpretation of the canon is that the events of ""6969"" are the first in the NSP saga from their perspective - Danny invents their time machine and takes them on their first journey through time to the titular year. Presumably at some point after the events of the song they settle in the early 21st Century, possibly because their time machine breaks.   Further support to the notion that ""6969"" is the first song chronologically is that Danny registers surprise at Ninja Brian murdering the entire army of the Council, which is fairly standard behavior for Bri. If their friendship is still young, or even not cemented, it adds an extra dimension to Danny's uncharacteristically hesitant bit to Brian at the start asking him to come with him."

NinjaSexParty,3dv699,kunk180,3,Mon Jul 20 04:29:38 2015 UTC,"So I was listening to ""6969"" while I was working the other day, and it comes up to the part where Danny realizes 6969 isn't as sexy as he thought/hoped, so they go to talk to the Council of Dick Elders, and something caught my attention.   If things in the video play out in much the same way as they do in the song itself, the Council doesn't have any kind of baliff or attache or something to announce Danny and Ninja Brian's arrival (which, pretty unusual, for people as important and powerful as the Council obviously are, by this point).    So Danny literally just busts into the council chambers with Ninja Brian and starts talking to them.  If you listen, the (lead) Elder says ""What do you want?""  and he sounds... well, not exactly friendly, but not super hostile either.  It isn't until Danny tells the Elders the reason why they're there that the lead Elder says, ""Wait!  You're Ninja Sex Party!  You will ruin our plans!""  and then starts screaming for the guards.    {Now, bear in mind, they might fill all of this in visually in the video, so this might not wind up being anything - still, I thought this was an interesting little set-up if I'm right!}  But yeah, so ... Danny doesn't identify himself or Ninja Brian, but the Elders still know exactly who they are and the havoc they can wreak on their control of the planet, as soon as they hear Danny reveal his intentions.  In ""SAP,"" it says towards the end specifically: ""now their tale will be passed down in sacred scrolls.""  The only thing I can take that to mean is that the SAP write down everything about their battle with NSP (as talked about in ""SAP"" itself) and then that scroll is handed down through generations of abstinence-lovin' samurai as a sort of holy relic/document that ultimately winds up in the hands of the people who become the Council.   Which is how they know who both Danny and Ninja Brian are, and even call them out by name towards the end (""It's over, Danny Sexbang!  But first, we're gonna take care of your ninja friend, here!"").  Granted, I suppose in the intervening years NSP could have drummed up such a tremendous reputation for themselves as all-around asskickers of anyone who wants to stop them from boning that they basically become legendary antagonists in the minds of SAP accolytes, but one fight and it just happens to be recalled by some random, unaffiliated group over 2500 years later?  Seems kinda unlikely, doesn't it?"

I prefer my theory that the Samurai Abstinence Patrol was trained by the Council of Dick Elders, and that they actually came back from the future to defeat NSP before the events of 6969. Or perhaps the Dick Elders from 1515 knew could forsee NSP's arrival, and trained the SAP in advance?"
NinjaSexParty,3dv699,Alertcircuit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:04:04 2015 UTC,"First, Dan and Brian are immortal, seems unlikely considering Danny is a normal human.   You seem to be forgetting a few things. Remember that time Danny was pricked by a poison dart, fell down a mountain, got pricked by another poison dart, and was still able to speak clearly in ""If We Were Gay?"" Or how about the time he jumped to the second floor window of someone's house in ""Three Minutes of Ecstasy?"" Danny made multiple shadow clones so he could seduce a girl by harmonizing with himself in ""Why I Cry.""  Maybe some of the music videos aren't part of NSP canon, but we can't forget how many times stuff like this has happened to Dan in the songs. His entire body was ""cleaved in half"" by Brian at the end of ""Ultimate Sandwich"" and he was stabbed multiple times in ""Best Friends Forever."" In ""Road Trip,"" he jumped out of a spaceship without a spacesuit, and in the album intro for Player Select, Danny and Arin are reminiscing over that time Brian opened the air lock in space, causing their chests to collapse from the sudden decompression.  And with all of this, Danny just acts like it's normal shit that happens everyday. That's because it is, to him. Both Brian and Danny know that he'll survive basically anything. To be able to survive all this stuff and be able to make clones means that Dan really is the toughest fucking ninja you've ever seen. He might not be as skilled as Brian in most areas, but we've never seen Brian take a hit. Dan is tougher in a sense that his body and mind are extremely resilient, while Brian is tougher in a sense that he's a super-skilled and powerful ninja.  Just to dig into the lore more and create an entirely different theory, SAP and NSP are two sides of the same coin. Arin is Danny's equal, Barry is Brian's. They're destinies are intertwined, be it battle, friendship, or both. As long as one lives so must the other and vice versa, but one's downfall must be by the other's hand, and it must be with the intent to end their own lives as well. This would explain the immortality of Arin and Danny and their abilities to be at seemingly any point in Earth's history (given they haven't just used a time machine.)"

NinjaSexParty,3dopkd,killerconrad101,6,Sat Jul 18 00:21:54 2015 UTC,"I was just saying to my friends that they really should do a concept album next and do more with the 6969 concept/format or come up with another adventure/series of unfortunate events for the boys to get tangled up in.  The thing is - I've never seen a lyricist do so much in such a short amount of time as Dan's able to do. He literally crammed an entire 90-minute movie into an 8 and a half minute song.  It's the hero's quest, beat for beat - the heroes setting out on the quest, the heroes being tested, the resolution, and everything buttoned up perfectly at the end.  Dan absolutely could do pull it off, lyrically, and Brian could DEFinitely bring it sonically. I knew they could make ""6969"" work, even before I heard it, so there's no doubt in my mind that he and Brian could swing an entire rock opera."
NinjaSexParty,3dopkd,bloopyreggaejamz,2,Sat Jul 18 01:52:34 2015 UTC,They should do a Peppermint Creams/Game of Thrones style concept album.

NinjaSexParty,3dopkd,wyrmknave,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:02:26 2015 UTC,"Just for funsies, here's how I'd outline a 6969 musical  ""Ninja Sex Party"" - takes its cues from NSP Theme Song and introduces the audience to Danny and Bri.  ""Samurai Abstinence Patrol"" - Largely follows the events of the song from the album, but concludes with the two pairs fighting to a standstill and SAP withdraw.  ""6969"" - Brian has used information gleaned from the rip in in time the SAP traveled through to engineer a time machine. Danny sings about his hopeful vision of the year 6969 and convinces Brian to take him there. They set a course and leave for the future.  ""No Touching"" - NSP arrive in 6969 to find the sexless landscape described in the song. Danny runs through the streets confused and seeking answers while the locals treat him with curiosity and wariness. Eventually he finds the robot sign displaying the touch has been outlawed and falls into despair.  ""Appeal"" - Danny talks to the Council of Dick Elders and gives an impassioned speech about the beauty of intimacy and lovemaking and boners and stuff.  ""Lasers"" - The High Elder recognizes Ninja Sex Party and declares them enemies of the state, and NSP are forced to flee from the chambers of the Council.  ""Immediately in Love"" - As they take flight, Danny encounters Kristen in the street and falls for her immediately. As the Dick Enforcers give chase, he implores her to come with him and Brian. (Features a reprise of the hook of 6969)  ""Attitude City"" - Danny, Brian, and Katie flee to the only place free of the Council's rule: Attitude City. They meet with the leader of the resistance, David, who recognizes NSP from legends. They ask what they can do to help NSP start a revolution, and a plan is hatched.  ""Samurai Abstinence Patrol (Reprise)"" - The Council remove their elite warriors from cryosleep and send Arin Neverbone and Samurai Barry into Attitude City to put a stop to NSP.  ""6969 (Reprise)"" - The resistance complete their plan - to set up a broadcast tower and project a live video feed of Danny and Kristen boning across the world. As the SAP finally break through the resistance's defenses into the HQ, they see they are too late - a worldwide orgy has begun to break out. Despondent, they lay down arms, as the song becomes a celebration of love and banging.  ""Way More Lasers"" - The Council make a last-ditch charge on Attitude City, armies charging past the citizens making love in the streets towards the resistance's HQ. They are met by Ninja Brian at the gate.  ""Ninja Brian Murders Absolutely Everyone"" - An instrumental piece in which Ninja Brian dances between the soldiers on stage stabbing them, showing in extreme slow motion the instant destruction he brought down on the army.  ""Ninja Sex Party Victorious"" - The Empire defeated, the world saved, Ninja Sex Party decide they must return to their own time once they're done celebrating. Danny bids farewell to Kristen and asks her to rule in his stead. It is implied heavily that David is a descendant of Danny's, and that he and Kristen are totes gonna bone. NSP leave for home with the crowds of 6969 singing their praises."

NinjaSexParty,3dlo1b,GrumpingIt,3,Fri Jul 17 07:29:37 2015 UTC,I still haven't gotten my digital downloads yet. :(
NinjaSexParty,3dlo1b,maracusdesu,2,Fri Jul 17 14:42:19 2015 UTC,I got the same thing. Subtotals are different then totals.
NinjaSexParty,3dlo1b,TheOsttle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:51:42 2015 UTC,Mine is just the bundle.  I don't think anyone is getting codes until their business hours start later today. Listen to it on Spotify til then.
NinjaSexParty,3dlo1b,oliveparty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:53:36 2015 UTC,"It doesn't say $70 in the total below, so I'm not sure if I should worry. And I guess that makes sense. I'll use spoofy.  EDIT: Bought Spotify Premium just so I could listen to it in order. xD"
NinjaSexParty,3dlo1b,oliveparty,2,Fri Jul 17 07:58:52 2015 UTC,Mine just changed to what yours looks like. Didn't look that an hour ago. Must be an inventory thing since a physical bundle doesn't exist as a single packaged object.  This way they can check off that all four things are in the package before sending it off.

NinjaSexParty,3dlo1b,ScarOf94,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:23:41 2015 UTC,I see. The pricing is mainly what confused me. I forgot to mention mine wasn't like this until an hour or 2 ago.
NinjaSexParty,3dlo1b,ScarOf94,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:24:33 2015 UTC,"Mine looks like that too. I think we're fine, because even though the subtotal is $70, we've been charged $0.00 and it says that the only charges remaining are the price of the bundle.  Quick question, did you not get charged tax because you live in an area without sales tax? My total came out to  $41.72. :("
NinjaSexParty,3dlo1b,zeldapunkgrrl,2,Fri Jul 17 08:09:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm. No idea. We're 8th highest in the U.S. on sales tax last i checked, with 6.85%...... Weird."

There are 14,000+ codes to send out so if they take a while it wouldn't be all that surprising."
NinjaSexParty,3dlhva,baby-d0ll-eyes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:34:07 2015 UTC,"Pre-Ordered the bundle as well. I can't find anywhere that says we get digital downloads. I'll keep checking but CD Baby is located in Portland, Oregon.  I'm an hour and half south of there and still nothing. Maybe in 45 minutes?  EDIT: So the bundle page is down so I can't check if each track was listed as ""Album Only"" meaning no digital download. The stand alone Attitude city still does not have digital downloads on CD Baby."

All prices listed on their site are USD and they do their transactions in it so always leave wiggle room for exchange. If you google search ""42.54 USD to CAD"" it will take you to a little calculator that shows you.  But honestly the exchange rate is such a total pain in the buttsex to deal with so I understand your confusion entirely."
NinjaSexParty,3dgmsh,galaco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:44:09 2015 UTC,"I'm Canadian and also ordered the bundle. Mine came to $42.54 in USD. With the exchange, it will probably be around $55 CDN."

I've lately been in a place with precious little inspiration, and it's been beyond amazing watching these two phenomenal dudes grab their passion by the balls and run with it.  It's dorky, but it gives me the sense that if they can do it, I can do it too, and that's something that I'd been missing. So thanks NSP, you guys are fantastic and I look forward to all of your things :D"

I bought NSFW, then the singles (Dragon Slayer, Attitude City, Why I Cry, ect...) Strawberries and Cream came next. Then suddenly I had an epiphany, Danny Sexbang was who replaced Jon. I slowly started watching more Grump videos and it is all thanks to NSP. So yea...NSP actually led to me supporting the Grumps again."

NinjaSexParty,3cfv4n,Theflamekitten,3,Tue Jul 7 16:19:25 2015 UTC,Maybe it was a temporary thing? I just checked in the Google Play Store and everything nsp was there. Perhaps they're gearing up for attitude city?
NinjaSexParty,3cfv4n,ericpotter4,2,Tue Jul 7 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"Yikes!  I just checked my own Google Play and when I searched for Ninja Sex Party, I just got four playlists and some radio stations.  I tried playing one of the playlists and none of the songs would play, so it just kept skipping track after track.  Unless I'm mistaken or there's some kind of glitch or something, it looks like NSP's been taken off of Google Play entirely. :/  ETA: Same thing goes for Starbomb, Skyhill and Northern Hues - it looks like everything got yanked!"

NinjaSexParty,3bhm6q,HVdrumr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:42:28 2015 UTC,holyshit this made me remember soul calibur is a thing!  Are there any of those for ps4 or has the franchise died out :I
NinjaSexParty,3bgsxd,PIK412,2,Mon Jun 29 02:27:35 2015 UTC,"This may come off as harsh, but as far as I watched, this really just felt like the original song slowed down with a bunch of generic instruments layered on top of it"
NinjaSexParty,3bax0k,rQaBabaca,3,Sat Jun 27 13:43:33 2015 UTC,"With all due respect to the guys, I'm not really interested in physical pressings of novelty songs. I wouldn't even buy Weird Al or Lonely Island vinyl and their music is really well produced."
NinjaSexParty,3bax0k,headless_bourgeoisie,3,Sat Jun 27 20:12:35 2015 UTC,"With the Starbomb releases going to vinyl, I was hoping NSP would follow suit. Starbomb is kool, don't get me wrong, but I find the writing craftsmanship and overall production in NSP much stronger, and would have definitely invested for vinyl of those. Disappointing :("
NinjaSexParty,3bax0k,theboatleft,-1,Sat Jun 27 13:44:48 2015 UTC,I dare to say NSP music is pretty much all digital produced. What's really the point of going through an old technology when you can have the music exactly how it came out of the studio via FLACs?
NinjaSexParty,3bax0k,theboatleft,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:09:22 2015 UTC,"To me, it's more the novelty of having it on vinyl. I hang vinyl records on my wall, and it'd be nice to have an NSP one to add to the collection. I guess I'm just an old dog too. I hate buying something that isn't tactile. If I'm putting out money, I'd like to have something I can hold in my hand"
NinjaSexParty,3bax0k,theboatleft,0,Mon Jun 29 15:29:09 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea. Get the artwork of the album you want, print it on a vinyl cover, and get an USB drive, you can even customize that too, stick in there and you can hang that. How about it?"
NinjaSexParty,3b6t19,RobinDragonryder,2,Fri Jun 26 13:01:23 2015 UTC,"Holy shit that's incredible. I still think of NSP being a little unknown band of awesome, it's so cool to see them getting this much attention"
NinjaSexParty,3b65io,baby-d0ll-eyes,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:52:22 2015 UTC,"That's really cool. Did you make these designs for the codes? If so then these are fantastic. I would grab one of them. Since my house is very ""rock"" oriented. It will give me a reason to pick up the game again. I still go back to it every so often. Hopefully my town is still alright and nobody else has left. haha!"
NinjaSexParty,3b65io,WLLMWM-phil,2,Sat Jun 27 07:45:28 2015 UTC,"All I did was shrink the originals down in Paint and popped them in the QR converter. Sadly my pixel skills aren't good enough to do something like this freehand.  But I'm glad that I could give you a reason to play again, though."

NinjaSexParty,3azpv1,baby-d0ll-eyes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"I kind of consider it being like you only saw the corner of your Christmas presents because they were hidden behind some other things.  You kind of know what it is, but at the same time you don't. Especially considering how random the sample bot made the previews."
NinjaSexParty,3azpv1,baby-d0ll-eyes,2,Fri Jun 26 00:05:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I can see where you're coming from, but at the same time, we pretty much have heard all of the NSP Shorts on the Album, so that's been spoiled for us."
NinjaSexParty,3azpv1,missaeiska,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:24:16 2015 UTC,"True...but we can also consider them early Christmas presents to stick with the analogy. Especially since they haven't done any short videos for the skits in quite sometime.  Speaking of, since Symphony in P Minor was one of the 30 Second Seductions it was kinda spoiled two years before Strawberries and Cream."
NinjaSexParty,3azpv1,RockVonCleveland,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:36:35 2015 UTC,Anyone else having an issue where the previews are showing up as unavailable? Is it because I'm on mobile or because I don't have Amazon Prime?

NinjaSexParty,3awkpl,Beta_Ray_Bill,2,Wed Jun 24 19:19:31 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing, like why would you -want- them to?  They'd hopefully punch you for showing them."
