Avengers,3dyovn,Bmoresgoddess,5,Mon Jul 20 16:43:59 2015 UTC,"Not a Thor comic book reader, so I can only speak to the MCU. It is clear that Sif has some feelings for Thor. And Odin even suggested directly that Thor would be happier with Sif than Jane. Thor probably realizes that Sif likes him, but they are certainly nowhere near lovers, much less a wife."
Avengers,3dyovn,qyasogk,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! And also, do you think there will be a love triangle in Thor 3?"
Avengers,3dyovn,qyasogk,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:40 2015 UTC,"There already is. Only between Sif and Thor, the feelings are unrequited and one sided. I have no doubt we'll see some development/progress on their relationship in Thor 3. The big question is will Natalie Portman come back to play Jane? She was instrumental in getting Thor 2 to be helmed by a female director, and was more than a little disappointed when that director left the project. She may not be coming back for Ragnarok."
Avengers,3dyovn,sonicfirestorm212,4,Mon Jul 20 18:00:59 2015 UTC,"Now I could be wrong but as far as I can remember, Thor was arranged to marry Sif before he went to Midgard. The marriage never happened because Thor met and fell in love with Jane Foster, so it's understandable if Sif feels a little sleighted by this. The movies don't do a very good job of explaining Thor's relationships with anyone but Jane, except maybe Loki."
Avengers,3dyovn,ZacMuleer,3,Mon Jul 20 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"Comments have already been made regarding the MCU/comic lore, so I'll only add that in Norse mythology, Sif is Thor's wife.  So it depends on the context of the quiz/research you wanted.  (I wouldn't be surprised if they wrote Jane out and made Sif a love interest in the MCU to coincide with ""myths and legends"".)"
Avengers,3dyovn,Darthallen417,2,Mon Jul 20 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"Long time Thor fan.  The best way to describe Thor and Sifs relationship is ""complicated"".  Sif and Thor are in love but for the god of lightning who travels the universe from one relm to the next his godly endowments, and his own lust for drinking and merryment are Sifs ire as she can not stop Odins son from engaging in extra relational affairs but she is privy to the meandering that Thor engages in with off Valhala women.  So while Sif is dedicated to Thor, the son of Odin does not share that monogmos mentality that Sif wants from him.  Also more then occasionaly the enchantress has used that bond they have for one another to to drive the wedge between them when it comes to commitment time.  The Enchantress is also in love with Thor, but more for physical and political reasons."
Avengers,3dyovn,sjgrunewald,2,Mon Jul 20 22:19:47 2015 UTC,"In the comics they always had an on again/off again relationship. They both love and care for each other, but the timing was never right for a relationship between the two of them.   In the MCU it seems to be more of an unrequited love thing on the side of Sif though."

Jean Grey and Professor X were both potential answers to a question about telekinesis and telepathy, and technically either one could be a valid answer. And the Hank Pym question was equally ambiguous putting Mr. Fantastic as a potential answer."

Remember that Fury's response to Cap putting the Hydra weapon on the table was to point out that they rounded up all the Hydra tech after the war.  That's when Tony flipped the monitor to show the actual Phase 2 weapons and prove that while he might have been telling the truth about the Hydra weapons, he was still working on other weapons with the technology.

Avengers,3c5ek7,websnark,3,Sat Jul 4 23:33:40 2015 UTC,Any age should be fine unless your kids are violent and want to punch everything.
Avengers,3c5ek7,bluntmasterflash,3,Sun Jul 5 05:52:48 2015 UTC,"Superhero Squad is quite funny in moments and it is geared at ages 4 - 8.  I (an adult) still enjoyed having it on the background.  The episode where they have to capture a Wolverine clone with a Canadian bacon trap is awesome.  Jokey violence a la Roadrunner & Coyote.  No sex and no swearing.  Unfortunately stereotypical presentations of female characters - cranky and controlling, bossy, ""bewitching"" men.  Plots are short and silly.  Character development is nil.  Easy for even preschoolers to understand.  My take: appropriate for ages 4 - 8 (but maybe make sure they receive some contrasting positive images of female heroes!)  EMH contains non-graphic violence, no swearing, and no sex.  People are ""shot"" with miscellaneous energy weapons or punched with no blood and could conceivably be unconscious.  Kids could imitate the kicking and punching.  Female characters are not overly sexualized or drawn in excessively skimpy costumes.  The plots are long and span several episodes.  The  character interactions are complex.  For example, Janet flirts with a man to make Hank jealous. He seethes silently and then (partially as a passive-aggressive gesture) gets involved with pacifism, which conflicts with his role on the Avengers.  My guess is that kids under 9 will have a lot of trouble understanding the plot.  They may not care if they just want to see a lot of action.  There are some positive messages about loyalty, understanding and appreciating diversity, courage, etc.  My take: Appropriate for ages 5 & up; may not be appreciated until age 9 or so  Avengers Assemble is similar to EMH in terms of violence, sex, and language.  Plots are simpler and characters are less developed.  It is easier for a child to understand.  The same set of positive messages are present.  My take: Appropriate for ages 5 & up"

Avengers,3c3ycd,Buckit,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:21:30 2015 UTC,"Risky click of the day.   This is indeed a website that provides instructions on how to build an Ironman suit. I assume it uses the pepakura method of precise paper-cutting and overlapping with fiberglass resin, but I don't know because it's all behind a $14.99 paywall.  At least it wasn't a Rickroll."
Avengers,3c3ycd,pulsepulsebeep,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:59:02 2015 UTC,"You are much better going to therpf and finding free templates, you'll have to download a free software called pepakura designer (if you want to scale it properly) or find pdf images of the templates (risk not being scaled properly) .   I am currently working on my mark 42/43 ironman armor, but they have literally anything you can think of on that site. Do not pay for anything unless you are getting a finished 3d printed suit."
Avengers,3bvmuy,Hull2910,12,Thu Jul 2 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you would say Lannister. I guess the color pattern fits but this is also Iron Mans color pattern. There is defiantly no lions anywhere on that armor. I think a more accurate title would be ""If Iron Man had a cool kind of medieval looking armor but with like Thor things on the side and it was decorated all nice."""
Avengers,3bvmuy,admiraltoad,8,Thu Jul 2 16:57:56 2015 UTC,"The guy who made this (10/10 credit giving from OP cheers bud), Samuel Lee, titled it Asgardian Iron Man armor. So."

Avengers,3bvmuy,Deckurr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:29:54 2015 UTC,Hey if I knew it came from there I would have done! Just saw it pop up on facebook as an imgur link and reposted it with the title it already had.

Avengers,3bvmuy,bartacc,-2,Thu Jul 2 19:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah and him being a Stark is why this joke has any sense at all (because that's the only thing that soooomeeehow links him to the GoT), so I don't see the point of mentioning it x more times in comments <.<  Or is it the ""HEY HEY I UNDERSTOOD THE REFERENCE!"" type of comment?

Avengers,3awx3z,Aquamansaquaplan,23,Wed Jun 24 04:00:10 2015 UTC,"Probably because we've already had 5 movies with Peter. They could very easily merge Peter and Miles. Movies do it all the time, merging the traits and histories of several characters into one."
Avengers,3awx3z,Johnny_Stooge,8,Wed Jun 24 04:59:34 2015 UTC,"Peter Parker is such a great character.  I don't care what Marvel does with Miles or what they call him, but it's Peter - as close as possible to the Marvel comics version of him - that I want to see interacting with the Avengers and in a (hopefully good) movie."
Avengers,3awx3z,wilyquixote,10,Wed Jun 24 06:09:55 2015 UTC,"Sure we have 5 movies with Peter and a reboot, but I want at least one movie with Parker and the Avengers.  Poor Spidey has only entered the doorway to the MCU, he deserves a chance to show a good Peter AND Spider-Man in the same film."
Avengers,3awx3z,neoslith,4,Wed Jun 24 05:07:13 2015 UTC,"For non comic book fans, Spiderman has always been peter parker.  For them to take and make Miles Morales Spiderman right away would probably alienate or confuse people, and would probably just serve as a media headache.  I'm of the opinion that they should introduce Peter into the MCU, Introduce Miles in passing, and then when Peter retires/dies Miles can take his place. Like a passing of the torch kind of thing.  Once Peter Spidey has a chance to mature, then give the role to Miles."
Avengers,3awx3z,atomic1fire,8,Wed Jun 24 08:17:38 2015 UTC,Peter Parker is THE Spider-man the OG and one of marvels most successful characters with comics and films. Also the mainstream audience is more familiar with him than opposed to Ben Reilly or Miles Morales for example. it shouldn't really surprised people that they chose Peter Parker over all of the other Spider-men but personally I would rather see a representation of Peter Parker within the MCU.
Avengers,3awx3z,ryugenxshin,2,Wed Jun 24 07:45:01 2015 UTC,"Not really disagreeing here but:  After the recent secret wars event, morales is going to be:  A. Part of the normal marvel universe B. An avenger.  So there's a chance in the future."
