Pizza,3e27f7,generaltsopizza,5,Tue Jul 21 11:41:14 2015 UTC,This looks incredible.
Pizza,3e27f7,super_shogun,3,Tue Jul 21 15:38:10 2015 UTC,I grew up with this man. Literally across the street. Wish I could share it with you all
Pizza,3e27f7,wtfomg77,4,Tue Jul 21 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"Fellow Brooklynite here, ever been to DiFaras? It's very good but idk if it's worth $5 a slice"
Pizza,3e27f7,wtfomg77,3,Tue Jul 21 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yep! Been there a couple times. It's good pizza, but I don't go out of my way for it like most people visiting would.  I think we grow fond of what our local pizzerias cook up more than anything."
Pizza,3e27f7,ramsoss,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:16 2015 UTC,"DiFara's is actually a 5 minute walk from my house, but I've only gone to it a few times. Rarely feel like waiting on line or paying $5. Most places here are good. I think the key to getting the best pizza experience, is to either get a slice from a pie that just came out of the oven (places with high sales volume are good for this), or just order your own pie if you have a group"
Pizza,3e27f7,ramsoss,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:43 2015 UTC,I live in Sunset Park on 43rd and 5th. Never been. I will check out now because the other joints stink compared to Bay Ridge and Park Slope.
Pizza,3e27f7,fosiacat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:35 2015 UTC,You're just a few blocks away from me! Let me know what you think if you do go there. It's on the corner of 49th and 8th   Edit: what would you recommend from park slope?
Pizza,3e1ptr,Troldskum,2,Tue Jul 21 07:40:04 2015 UTC,"First time using the oven at our new place. The temperature doesn't go as high as I'd like, but it turned out quite nice anyway.  Dough recipe: http://www.pizzamaking.com/lehmann-nystyle.php"
Pizza,3e1ptr,dopnyc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:42:53 2015 UTC,How hot does the oven go?  What's the top temperature you can set it at?
Pizza,3e1ptr,dopnyc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:32 2015 UTC,It's a built-in convection. It goes to 250c and I use a baking steel.
Pizza,3e1ptr,dopnyc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"250c, bummer.  Any chance it can be calibrated? That might be you a bit more heat.  Also, are you using malted flour?  That will help with browning."
Pizza,3e1ptr,gypsysoulrocker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not great. Haven't tried calibrating it though. I have a weber Q2200 gas grill that I will try putting the baking steel into next time.   Haven't tried malted flour, will definitely look for it! Cheers. I've only used Tippo00 so far."
Pizza,3e1ptr,gypsysoulrocker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:34 2015 UTC,"If you're in Europe, malted flour might be hard to find. It's not quite exactly the same thing as using malt, but you can achieve malt like effects with a much longer ferment. If, say, you're fermenting overnight, try 3 days, and, if you're fermenting 2 days, try 4.  Just make sure you dial back the yeast a bit so the dough doesn't get overblown.  By extending the fermentation time, you're allowing the small amount of enzymes in 00 to generate sugar and encourage browning.  It's just takes a lot longer with 00 than with a malted flour. Don't be afraid to even try 5 and 6 days, although the protein in the dough is breaking down as well, and you might start seeing translucent bubbles in the rim.  This gets a bit complicated, but you might be able to buy diastatic malt (the kind they add to flour) and add it to the 00 yourself.  For an oven with your specs, malt won't solve all your problems, but it will go a very long way to help browning.  Steel, btw, works incredibly poorly in bottom heat scenarios like grills.  The steel gets very hot and burns the bottom of the pizza before the top starts to brown. If you have a regular stone, or, better yet, quarry tiles, those will work better than steel. The less conductivity, the better.  The Q2200 does have one advantage over other gas grills- the lower ceiling should give you a bit better top browning than with something like a Genesis.  With a regular cordierite stone, the top of the pizza might still be a bit pale, but, as long as you keep the cover closed, you might be alright in terms of getting a relatively fast, balanced bake- maybe 6 minutes."
Pizza,3e1ptr,Vacre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:42 2015 UTC,Do you have to prep the bacon and potatoes before throwing it in or just let it cook on the pizza?
Pizza,3e1ptr,Vacre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:47 2015 UTC,I cooked the bacon till rather crispy beforehand in a pan. Sliced the potatoes thin and boiled them for a couple of minutes.

Pizza,3e1ptr,muhaski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:09 2015 UTC,"I whisked mascarpone cheese with a little olive oil, salt, pepper and oregano. Spread that on the base, then added the other stuff."

Pizza,3e0ft1,gizanked,4,Tue Jul 21 16:11:44 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking... instead of going through the trouble of making the stuffed crust bit, why not make two crusts, put cheese all between them, and roll the edges up?"
Pizza,3e0ft1,JickSmelty,3,Tue Jul 21 07:42:35 2015 UTC,Sounds like a quesadilla pizza!
Pizza,3e0ft1,Hat_Skeleton,3,Tue Jul 21 13:24:21 2015 UTC,Is that a pizzadilla or a quesizza?
Pizza,3e0ft1,beard_meat,3,Tue Jul 21 16:45:27 2015 UTC,Are you kidding me?   It's a pizzadilla...  Duh.
Pizza,3e0ft1,spartancody08,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:41 2015 UTC,What kind of cheese did you use for the crust? I can never seem to get it right.
Pizza,3e0ft1,-Zoren-,6,Tue Jul 21 01:58:30 2015 UTC,"I cut strips from a block of mozzarella. What have you tried? I thought it turned out great. It may be improved by to including a cheese that has a more gooey consistency, but I'm not sure."
Pizza,3e0ft1,Cambridge_Shoulders,2,Tue Jul 21 03:07:04 2015 UTC,"I also have trouble with the cheese in the crust. I've used mozzarella string cheese, but it tends to simply leak out and get solid rather than stay gooey and great. I will try the block cheese method next time and see how it works out.   In any case, this pizza looks fabulous. Great job, OP."
Pizza,3e0ft1,-Zoren-,2,Tue Jul 21 04:37:19 2015 UTC,Thanks! It didn't leak out at all. Let me know how it goes.

Pizza,3e0ft1,LolcatPlays,3,Tue Jul 21 08:56:22 2015 UTC,The crust looks good for a stuffed crust pizza.  Did you put the sauce on top of the cheese or is that something else going on?
Pizza,3e0ft1,KingSwank,3,Tue Jul 21 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"I did a bottom layer of cheese followed by pepperoni, sausage, and Canadian bacon. Then I topped with more cheese and sauce on top. I like the flavor the sauce develops when it's on top."

Pizza,3e0vpi,LeJoog,7,Tue Jul 21 02:31:03 2015 UTC,Pineapple and jalapenos is a good combination.
Pizza,3e0vpi,Droguelike,4,Tue Jul 21 04:01:22 2015 UTC,Agreed. My favorite pizza is Hawaiian with jalapenos. The spicy/sweet combination is really satisfying. Too bad warm pineapple gets a bad rap.

Pizza,3e12pk,amopdx,2,Tue Jul 21 03:30:49 2015 UTC,"my plate   the crust  I used this this recipe.  I mixed and kneaded by hand since I don't have a stand mixer.  I used bread flour instead of ap flour and added more as needed while kneading until it felt right.  I made the dough yesterday and after proofing I divided it into two dough balls and refrigerated over night, I pulled the dough out of the fridge and hour before baking.  I preheated the oven for like a half hour at 500, while putting the pizza together,  Oiled a sheet pan and sprinkled with a layer of cornmeal.  Next I. stretched one of the dough balls by hand to fit the pan and placedIt in the pan.  then brushed some olive oil onthe dough and indented with my fingers.  For the sauce I used a small can of tomato sauce mixed with tomato paste, garlic powder and Italian herbs, spread it on the dough. then shredded some mozzarella and Monterey Jack and sprinkled on, then topped with cooked and seasoned ground beef, pineapple, red onions, green peppers and pepperoncinis. Topped with more Monterey Jack and mozzarella and sprinkled some Parmesan/Romano on top.  Pre-baking pic  Baked for about 10-12 minutes... It was delicious!"
Pizza,3e12pk,Cdresden,2,Tue Jul 21 03:39:07 2015 UTC,"I've made a very large number of pies that looked pretty much just like this.  Minus the pineapple.  I used a Silpat type silicone pan liner.  That way you can take the cheese to the edge of the dough, and when it flows over onto the pan, it won't stick, but just get crisp."
Pizza,3e0mhm,1fastman1,7,Tue Jul 21 01:15:51 2015 UTC,That is how you learn my friend.  Just a little in the center with a ladle and spiral it out.    Check out some videos on stretching your dough and having its final rise in a ball with a skin on the outside.  Even the mistakes are fun to eat.  Good luck!

Pizza,3e0y09,LolcatPlays,2,Tue Jul 21 18:40:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, found the picture! http://imgur.com/k3NECOG  You can see from the pepperoni slices that none of the toppings on the left half could have moved, nor the top right corner. That leaves the bottom right corner, which has no cheese tearing or stretching.  Also, if you look at the cheese cut marks on the left, you can see they are all clear and distinct. Unless the pizza recut itself, they had to have cut the pizza when it looked like tha.  Finally, look at the bacon or ham or whatever that is. It's all clumped on one corner of the pizza, the top right (as opposed to the bottom right, the direction the toppings overlap). Hardly any in the bottom left. And the pizza cutter marks are clearly defined all through the bits.  Looks clear to me like they were handling it rough when they were putting it on the box before cutting it. Hot out of the oven, the entire cheese and toppings ""pad"" slid over the sauce and over the edge of the pizza. The person cutting it said ""Screw it"" and cut it anyways. And then they try to blame it on me.  Also, screw you, one guy who downvoted me."

Without going into a long defense of my position, it is pizza like this, that makes posting pictures of Domino's on here a crime."
