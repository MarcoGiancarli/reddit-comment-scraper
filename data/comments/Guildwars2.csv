Guildwars2,3e30yi,Ilithius,17,Tue Jul 21 16:06:43 2015 UTC,Direbeetus.
Guildwars2,3e30yi,Doctor0Doctors,8,Tue Jul 21 16:44:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting how the condition and berserker builds look very similar overall.  The weapons and trait lines are pretty much identical.  I don't think switching from one to the other will do much to change the ""feel"" of play for the Guardian.  That seems rather unfortunate in the design of the class."
Guildwars2,3e30yi,vrava,6,Tue Jul 21 16:31:40 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the traitlines will be different once dragonhunter comes out.
Guildwars2,3e30yi,vrava,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:06 2015 UTC,So you're thinking that a Condition build would utilize the Dragonhunter trait line while the berserker build would likely remain similar to the way it is now?  Do you think either will use traps or longbow?
Guildwars2,3e30yi,Lightguardianjack,4,Tue Jul 21 16:47:20 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the Berserker build drop Radiance for Dragonhunter since it has more damage modifiers and Radiance is more condi-focused?
Guildwars2,3e30yi,Dristig,5,Tue Jul 21 17:00:27 2015 UTC,"Both might take dragonhunter.  Vuln trap would be great for trash either way.  The bleed trap trait would be nice for condi.  Longbow might be good to lead off with, especially for the scepter build.  I'm not really sure at this point though."
Guildwars2,3e30yi,zawias92,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:30 2015 UTC,The big difference if condi never hits F1 and uses Purging Flames on cool down.
Guildwars2,3e30yi,Nike_Phoros,6,Tue Jul 21 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"uh, on zerker absolute resolution isnt ruining your dmg so much. also honor with symbol/mace traits may be better option than radiance."
Guildwars2,3e30yi,Vichornan,5,Tue Jul 21 18:46:15 2015 UTC,"also honor with symbol/mace traits may be better option than radiance.   That was what everyone initially thought but it turned out to be lower DPS, though a bit better for support."
Guildwars2,3e30yi,Perkinz,8,Tue Jul 21 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"It seems like a nice alternative with different damage type and  cheaper gear options(as superior rune of balthazar is like 1/100 price of scholar and berserker gear is pretty expensive-though it is not that important as you can get them from dungeons anyway-). Also it is pretty funny that how condi guardian, all of a sudden, changed from being a joke to actually being able do deal some nice damage close to the power meta.  Overall, thanks for the guide and your work Obal."
Guildwars2,3e30yi,CrAcKmUfFiN,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:44 2015 UTC,"Also it is pretty funny that how condi guardian, all of a sudden, changed from being a joke to actually being able do deal some nice damage close to the power meta.   Well, yeah!  That's what happens when ArenaNet gets off their asses and fixes their game!  Why they ever went away from their original ""Absurdly High Damage, Absurdly Low Duration"" specification for Burns and made it a generic (S)Do(EL)T is beyond me.  So glad it is finally usable the way it was in GW1."

Guildwars2,3e30yi,GuanglaiKangyi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of fire.  On topic: Obal, I attempted to find the most recent dev statement on this, but they did not say this on the forums so sourcing is a bit tough. I do believe that they recently made the statement that they would be looking to tone down burning and potentially condition damage overall (if someone could help me source, that would be grand).  Given the numbers are not too far off as is, would it not be pertinent to put a disclaimer that this build could be short-lived if such changes go through? I'm not trying to be a party-pooper here, but the Sinister set is quite a bit of work for what may wind up disappearing in a patch or two. :)"
Guildwars2,3e30yi,tommyinthewell,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"I would hope they don't nerf it further.  They already toned it down a bit, and it seems like it's in a good place compared to power.  At least, I hope they keep burning it the way it is for PvE. Condi actually needs a buff for various classes, especially Necromancer.  (Why does the trait Lingering Curse even exist? Scepter is useless without it, and mediocre at best even with the trait... Condi for Necro sucks.)"
Guildwars2,3e30yi,Rekme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:10 2015 UTC,I think that was from the live stream when they first showed specializations.  Amplified wrath got toned down as a result as well as the crit on burning foes.  I haven't seen any plans to do anything else with it.

Check out burn ranger and engie too, I have a short guide for the former on Guru just like the good old days.

Guildwars2,3e30yi,Nike_Phoros,4,Tue Jul 21 18:14:05 2015 UTC,"Condo engi is still outclassed by power engi, though you don't have to deal with a crazy rotation."
Guildwars2,3e30yi,tarthon2,-8,Tue Jul 21 18:52:56 2015 UTC,"As someone who has an engi alt, could I get a link to this easier rotation?"
Guildwars2,3e30yi,Sinaaaa,-10,Tue Jul 21 19:14:13 2015 UTC,The rotation is just as crazy either way.  Condi engie outclasses zerk engie in very short fights (<15s) and very long ones (>30s).  Zerk is slightly better (about 15%) with enough party buffs during the 15-30s window.
Guildwars2,3e30yi,ImminentFate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:02:57 2015 UTC,"is that guang math or real math?  also how does it outclass a berserker engi in >30s fights? you realize power engi is like 17.6k dps and you can repeat the rotation after the 30s, right?"
Guildwars2,3e3jqb,XechSt,4,Tue Jul 21 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool, you should get it water colored in pastels! :D  Btw, if anyone else wants tats, try not to get anything with backgrounds that don't need backgrounds, if you ever want a sleeve after something like this is makes it harder to fill in the extra spaces sometimes. Shading on the piece itself is fine, but doing black/dark purples to shade a background will create less canvas space.

Guildwars2,3e1w33,selorn,2,Tue Jul 21 17:02:40 2015 UTC,Hopefully they do SOME SORT of visual change to the model if they go the kit route.  I remember being so disappointed with the animal form skills in EotN.
Guildwars2,3e1w33,AnElls,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:31 2015 UTC,"eotn.. eyes of the north, eye? I remember something like umm never played gw 1, but I remember seeing this name!   yes, visuals are the strongest part of this game, this whole painting like made world where abilities have their visual representation. in fact it would be probably one of the most letdowns if they were to drop out some shapeshifting goodies.  but it made me so very much ant to play ranger, I love shapeshifting!"
Guildwars2,3e1w33,Rhywolver,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, Eye of the North.   In EotN there were skills you could earn which basically were Norn shapeshifting skills; Ursan Blessing, for example, changed your skill bar to have appropriately bear-like skills.  But there was no accompanying effect; the justification was that since the PC is human they can't physically transform like Norns, but it was still a huge let down IMO.  And yeah, I love shapeshifting too.   If there's actual shapeshifting, I'm going to have a very hard time choosing between a Ranger, Engi, and Revenant.   If it's just an 'aspect' type skill, but it's still functionally similar to kits, I'll still probably try it out."
Guildwars2,3e1w33,Darkever,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"ye and these aspects don't change appearance of revenant skills to. I thought it is going to be like elementalist elements. pity. I hope that at least ranger will get a better treatment. what I mean is that revenant offers a lot of its own effects so I expect something flashy for druids too. necromancer got some pretty badass stuff with greatsword and reaper form, raven wings and such. some superb work.   I think that druid is a class that can offer quite a lot in terms of nice visuals!"
Guildwars2,3e1w33,AnElls,4,Tue Jul 21 18:01:19 2015 UTC,Now I see it too!
Guildwars2,3e1w33,stupidbookah,4,Tue Jul 21 11:03:17 2015 UTC,"It looks similar what Legendary Heroes that appears above Revenant's head when switching Legend.  Which makes me think that Druid mechanic could be about the players getting some passive/active/stats effects based on the pet they are currently controlling. Which would fit the classid Druid theme, that is all about communing with nature. Example: while controlling a Brown Bear, you get enhanced vitality, a triggered passive ability Defy Pain that activates when you are at 25% health, and an active ability Shake It Off (that you cast yourself). Just a hunch."

Guildwars2,3e1w33,Jalian174,7,Tue Jul 21 13:19:19 2015 UTC,"That is subjective, and shapeshifting is a gimmick.  There is no reason for shapeshifting if you aren't going to take advantage of all shapeshifts.  In that other game you stay in one form based on your spec, unless you want the occasional movement speed boost from cat form.  Considering how GW2 has already done an excellent job with stance-dancing, I would expect them to succeed here where WoW failed.  But I don't think copying WoW is the answer, especially when the class already shares the same name.  It is also incredibly unoriginal to copy WoW.  GW2 has been trying to avoid fantasy cliché's through the removal of cliché races, and cliché classes does not fit this concept.  They have the potential to do something really unique through pet-possession and/or offensive plant magic, and I hope they don't disappoint with an easy go-to using the most successful MMO."
Guildwars2,3e1w33,Ufren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:41 2015 UTC,"In that other game you stay in one form based on your spec, unless you want the occasional movement speed boost from cat form.   Maybe now, but resto druids used to use all the shapeshifts (cat for stealth/speed/stun, bear for charge/interrupt/survival CD, travel for running, tree for healing) in PvP.   But I don't think copying WoW is the answer, especially when the class already shares the same name.   Considering Wild Shape was a part of the Druid class in 2e back in 1974, saying a shapeshifting druid is copying WoW is like saying cell phones are all just iPhone copies.  I'm not saying I want a shapeshift druid (especially since GW1 Druids weren't animal shifters), but yeah."

I think shapeshifting has more value in PVP anyways, than PVE.  I don't play PVP and I think the shifting is a wasted mechanic in PVE.   Considering Wild Shape was a part of the Druid class in 2e back in 1974   This is fine, but games such as LOTRO, SWTOR, ect are accused of being WoW clones, when WoW itself is based on EQ.  WoW's success is the reason games are accused of copying it.  Doubtlessly most of WoW's content is not original, but its popularity makes it an easy go-to for successful 'copying', as many games borrow ideas from it blatantly.  Giving Druid's in GW2 shapeshifting is most likely an idea the developers got from WoW, as a fellow (and successful) MMO.  With the comments implying a revenant-like effect, I prefer the idea of channeling bear spirit/powers over shapeshifting, personally.  Or possession of the pet as I mentioned, as it brings unique mechanics (such as safely hiding your body)."
Guildwars2,3e1w33,Genus_Apis,3,Tue Jul 21 14:18:14 2015 UTC,"games such as LOTRO, SWTOR, ect are accused of being WoW clones   It's true.  Those two are pretty blatant attempts to use one successful formula, reskin it with another successful IP, and resell it though.  You hear the accusation a lot less frequently (there's always people who call every MMO a WoW clone) around games that deviate from the formula like Rift, GW2, TSW, etc.   I don't play PVP and I think the shifting is a wasted mechanic in PVE.   True, it's been pretty limited post-Vanilla.  Way back when, Druids were actually a hybrid class that had a reason to shapeshift in PvE.  Now they hyper-specialize like everyone else.   many games borrow ideas from it blatantly.    And to be fair, WoW does the same thing (it ninjas shit from other MMOs all the time).   Giving Druid's in GW2 shapeshifting is most likely an idea the developers got from WoW, as a fellow (and successful) MMO.   I guess I'd disagree.  It's a concept that's been associated with gaming classes called ""Druid"" for over 40 years, just like archers with pets and warriors having tons of weapon proficiencies (neither of which get called wow clone concepts).  Now, if they make Bear = Tank, Cat = Stealth, and god forbid Tree = Heals, then grab the pitchforks.  Let's see some raptor/wolf/bat shapeshifts.   Or possession of the pet as I mentioned, as it brings unique mechanics (such as safely hiding your body).   WoW did that too, though (mostly just for fun post-Vanilla).  Also, if we're counting, they did Big Red Kitty (Bestial Wrath -> Rampage as One) first.  Not sure where that one originated, but it's a lot less ubiquitous than druids shapeshifting."

Now, if they make Bear = Tank, Cat = Stealth, and god forbid Tree = Heals, then grab the pitchforks. Let's see some raptor/wolf/bat shapeshifts.   This is a fair point.  I guess my biggest issue with the concept is the use of it in WoW.  I play WoW and main Balance druid, and right now my shapeshifting just provides me a buff that I always want, and clearly labels what spec I am playing.  This is more advantageous in PVP, where stances/shapeshifting is your first clue to what your enemy will do (note, I don't play PVP in WoW; but I use stance buffs on enemies to counter them in SWTOR's pvp).  The use of shapeshifting should be for stance dancing, IMO, but in GW2 we already have stance dancers - Revenants and Eles.  And I feel like adding it to Ranger is preventing some more interesting gameplay mechanics that don't yet exist in GW2.  Although, some of the elite specs aren't particularly unique either (As much as I want to play Dragonhunter, it plays identically to longbow trap ranger mechanics, minus the pet), but I also personally associate Druidism with plant magic, along the lines of Keepers in dragon age, and I fear shapeshifting moves away from that thematic.  Rangers are supposed to be masters of nature, and that theme can be expressed without the use of animals for every single build."
Guildwars2,3e1w33,Atwuin,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:56 2015 UTC,"And Engineers, which I'd posit change ""Stances"" (kits) more often than either Eles or Revs.  I agree in general - I think a shapeshifting ranger would be lame.  Mostly because it runs counter to GW1 druidism though, and not because I'm afraid of a WoW cloning.    (I mained a space turkey too for a long time years ago.  Old Eclipse was so much fun.)"
Guildwars2,3e1w33,tummlykins,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:48 2015 UTC,"space turkey   This is hilarious.  Way more amusing than boomkin   Old Eclipse was so much fun   How old?  I started during MoP, and personally prefer the current iteration over the old.  People tell me it was dumbed down because the meter moves on its own, but I think it was improved; before, you always knew what to cast and now, your rotation can be interrupted if you have to move or hit a delay, and you have to deal with time management (although starfire was more fun when it took less time to cast)"

Guildwars2,3e1w33,Atwuin,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"No, but I think a lot of games copy WoW because of its success.  regardless of its origin, it is unoriginal."

Guildwars2,3e1w33,I-Am-DAINJAH,7,Tue Jul 21 16:09:27 2015 UTC,Maybe the druid would channel animals like the revenant does legends? This kind of looks similar to the legend art that appears above the revenant's head when they switch legends.
Guildwars2,3e1w33,Quickloot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:26:51 2015 UTC,"This kind of explains the druid shoulders we saw earlier. In addition to be bark/wood shoulders, if you look closely you can see several ranger pets shaped out of the wood (ursine, feline, bird, drake etc). I could attribute it to simply being ranger themed, but to me it implied the druid specialisation might  tap into themes of the pet families.  Tool kits could work like shape shifting - taking on animal themed abilities, a kit for each animal. Personally I don't love the idea simply because I don't like managing several skill bars. It could also explain why druid is taking so long to reveal - the monk in Diablo 3 was the last to be revealed because it's unique attack animations required more work than the other classes.  Animal themed attunements could augment weapon skills and allow for glyphs as the utilities. Unlikely seeing as attunements aren't a skill but a profession mechanic, even replacing the pet (reducing it to a less controllable AI companion) it seems unlikely.  Stances make a lot of sense but I wonder how that fits in with the druid/magic theme. Just because it's the same skill type doesn't mean it has to play the same way other professions use it (compare ranger shouts to warrior shouts).  A strong case could be made for minions. Although I think this will be the engineer specialisation (gadget minions) the druid could fit well with minions. Druids in Diablo 2 could summon animals similar to how necromancers in GW2 can. It would be the ultimate troll by ArenaNet to make the ranger specialisation even more focused on AI companions.  Aside from that we have mantras, consecrations (too guardiany?), meditations, wards, transforms and (ugh) conjures. I just hope ArenaNet doesn't ditch the pet. Reducing it's role/power level to bring in a different mechanic is expected, but once they allow players to replace it, they give themselves permission to never fix the pet's core problems and groups will begin kicking ranger's that bring a pet."
Guildwars2,3e1w33,Agurkskurk,3,Tue Jul 21 09:56:33 2015 UTC,"While it's still a work in progress, they did at least tease the Druid spec in the announcement trailer shown with a wolf pet. That and ArenaNet hasn't shown any interest in ditching the pet when players have brought it up so there's that."
Guildwars2,3e1w33,Lytalm,3,Tue Jul 21 14:59:15 2015 UTC,A skill effect similar to the summoning of Legends?! So does this mean  a sort of kit skill which opens up a set of new (animal-related) skills?

Guildwars2,3e1w33,x0mi07,3,Tue Jul 21 09:30:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's doubtful. While it definitely fits the theme of the druid, legends are a profession mechanic. We've seen previously profession specific skill types be given to other specialisations (wells from necro to mesmer) we haven't seen any profession actually get another profession's mechanic. I doubt they'd do that.  Most likely we will see some kind of altering of the ranger's mechanic and either a new skill type or a an existing type given to rangers."
Guildwars2,3e1w33,cripplemouse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:14:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is that Legends currently have no skill types, so none of the skill type runes work for them, which is the opposite of what Anet was planning to do, especially after the changes to make all the class skills into a certain skill type.   So maybe Legends will become a skill type along with being a mechanic as well."
Guildwars2,3e1w33,Nexrex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:57:54 2015 UTC,"this would be interesting, but perhaps too narrow?  Either way they'll have to find some way to categorize the rev skills."

OP found it before I got back sweety. https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/a-legendary-journey/   where is your ANet tag ? lol!!!!!!   I don't think I need to work for A-net to tell they haven't done any dungeon stuff in a while. Besides, I said, ""probably won't"", not never ever in a million years. It's still a possibility, and now that I think about it while I'm actually awake, it probably wouldn't be too hard to implement compared to some of the other stuff they're planning."

Guildwars2,3e23sk,Shiiyouagain,13,Tue Jul 21 13:58:14 2015 UTC,Anet promoting dungeons... Sadly it'll never happen...
Guildwars2,3e23sk,Zomaarwat,3,Tue Jul 21 12:45:09 2015 UTC,"There's nothing in GW2 that has compelling bonuses, honestly.  GW1's bonus weeks were propped up by the Hall of Monuments craze. Even when it wasn't, each faction or title you were grinding was at least inter-connected with others: double Sunspear week meant it was a great time to go vanquish Elona with friends, for instance. Double Zaishen meant a whole world of options, while double Kurz/Lux had possibilities in both PvE and PvP."
Guildwars2,3e23sk,Azhkanizkael,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:38 2015 UTC,"I would like it if they brought back Flux, it sounds hilarious."

Guildwars2,3e23sk,gubbinsmcgee,7,Tue Jul 21 13:09:21 2015 UTC,or if your elite skills suck (ele) then you get something out of it.
Guildwars2,3e23sk,rashandal,3,Tue Jul 21 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"For anyone that didn't play GW1, elite skills were build defining, not slightly more powerful skills with a massive cooldown."
Guildwars2,3e23sk,tummlykins,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:31 2015 UTC,"as a necro, i'd gladly trade all my nerfed, boring and braindead elites for a stat buff."
Guildwars2,3e23sk,Varorson,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's a few things.   Dailies already fill the kind of roll that bonus weeks did. Bonus Weeks concentrate players in an area of the game, dailies concentrate players in a similar way.  In some ways GW2 doesn't need too much focus yet. Because of megaservers, even unpopular maps feel populated. The game hasn't expanded much so content doesn't have to compete with as many things. Whether you like it or not, you run the same dungeons today that you did on launch day. No need to focus players when they have so few choices anyway. There isn't a big need for this kind of mechanic in GW2 yet.  Finally, I think it would take time to implement and ArenaNet's plate is full. If there was a big need for it I could see them doing it, but I really don't think GW2 needs it right now, not as much as ArenaNet needs to be working on the expansion. Even if it only took one team a week or two, I don't think the benefits of this mechanic, for this game at this time is worth it."
Guildwars2,3e23sk,Kyrela,4,Tue Jul 21 12:03:39 2015 UTC,"Dailies more fill the role of the Zaishen Quests than the weekly bonuses, which gave you benefits to things you'd normally have to grind.  However, things like the Call of the Mists buff for PvP fulfills the same roll as the weekly bonuses. Both WvW and PvP have such that happens during tournaments/special events focused around those playstyles.  GW2's equivilant for PvE would end up being things like ""earn more tokens when running dungeons"" - and really nothing else unless they make kills count extra for slayer/weapon mastery achievements."
Guildwars2,3e23sk,Kyrela,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:03 2015 UTC,"the only daily that does this (kinda) is the event one and its only in one map in pve.  but yeah, goes we will have to wait until HoT"
Guildwars2,3e23sk,Azhkanizkael,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:15:29 2015 UTC,"I would like them - but take a look at the bonuses availble:   2x Free access to elite areas (FoW, UW, The Deep and Urgoz)  3x Allegiance bonus (double point gain for various allegiance titles) 3x Zaishen bonuses (increased rewards from Zaishen missions) Lucky/unlucky week (increased drop rate of lockpicks and double points for relevant title)    The PvP ones all come down to:     Double Blath. faction and double points towards X title (where x depends on which game mode has the bonus this week).    So lets have a look: Pretty much all of them relate to increased title acquisition - there closest thing in GW2 is achievements. So we'd be basing the bonuses around that. So we might have ""Double points for X achievements this weekend/week"". Those seem reasonable, although they tie into the AP system, which ANet might not want people to gain quicker than they currently can.  The only GW1 bonus that affects loot is the lucky/unlucky which just increases the chance of lockpicks dropping. There were some Weekend bonuses (when they did weekend bonuses instead of week long) that affected XP gain and Green drops (and gold from VQ).   So maybe if we had weekend bonuses instead. Well, we could and with just the XP bonuses there shouldn't be a massive issue, but your loot one could lead to a massive impact on the TP as players flood to farm the relevant content to get better loot - so I don't see that happening even for a weekend. Extra tokens leads to a similar issue.   So just XP events. Well, we already have boosters for WvW and PvE. PvP rank points would be a no go if they're serious about pushing PvP as an e-sport as it provides an advantage to those that can play during when that's active (rank up faster than those that can't play)."
Guildwars2,3e23sk,senichi,3,Tue Jul 21 11:12:16 2015 UTC,"sounds reasonable, but you don't have to copy from Guildwars 1, just take the concept.  For PvP, Rank Points/Reward Tracks don't give an advantage, so i see no Problem.  For Loot, i think its always better that people farm materials instead of gold, and if there are enought different bonus materials it should not be that much of a problem.  But i guess that all takes ressources, so gonna wait what HoT brings :/"
Guildwars2,3e23sk,Kyrela,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:20:05 2015 UTC,"True enough, you don't have to copy GW1's version.    For PvP, Rank Points/Reward Tracks don't give an advantage, so i see no Problem   Reward tracks isn't a problem. Rank points would be - rank points provide some measure of time spent in PvP (and which you could loosely equate to skill)  Even if you have bonus drop to materials instead of gold - you still have the issue that it's likely to have a major impact on the in game economy. I can see this being done if ANet wanted to inject a lot of certain materials (increasing the supply and lowering the value of an item), but aside from that I don't.   Yeah, we'll see what happens with HoT. I definitely would like some sort of bonus week(end) events. I just can't realistically imagine anything they can do on a recurring schedule."

Kinda dumb. PvP rank doesn't matter at all and has absolutely no impact on GW2 as an eSport. It limits nothing and raising it changes nothing of value.

The lack of prestige will mean a lot of players won't want to use it. Take a look at the skins used by your group next time you do a dungeon - karma weapon skins like the Jotun GS or the Modinir skins are far less common than BLC skins or even legendaries.

Guildwars2,3e2khr,bigfoot8fred,13,Tue Jul 21 13:49:35 2015 UTC,the reason WvW and PvP have those buffs is because they are trying to popularize them and people in general need the extra incentive.  Dungeons remain pretty much the quickest money making system in the game so I'm not sure I see the need - although I would say adding a specific dungeon to the dailies would be in line with an extra lets say 40 dungeon tokens as a reward.
Guildwars2,3e2khr,peskyjnixon,4,Tue Jul 21 13:58:40 2015 UTC,Dungeon is no longer the quickest way to make money or even spirit shards. Its all about grinding in SW. The number of lfgs in dungeons is also very very low compared to a year ago.
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Heisenbugg,4,Tue Jul 21 16:57:07 2015 UTC,"If you have a dedicated speed running group dungeons are still the quickest way to make gold in the first push through.  The DR on running dungeons is A LOT worse than the DR on chest farming though, so after about 2hrs in a dedicated group, chest farming will be the quickest way again.  That said, you're absolutely right - if you're using LFG/reforming a party every dungeon then they're nowhere near optimal."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,iNeedAValidUserName,14,Tue Jul 21 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"the problem is everyone calls themselves ""hardcore player"".  I mean what makes a HC player? you play dungeons? ... WvW? ... PvP? .... PvE events? ... all of the above?   I think that devs have been listening to the community and slowly are implementing the things that make more sence out of the 100s of recomendatios given by players (hardcore or not)  If you have an idea, bring it forward at the proper forums and hope its good enough to be implemented at some point."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Greatwoolf,2,Tue Jul 21 13:56:54 2015 UTC,Giving ideas is nice and all but at the end of the day this is A.Net's game and they should know how to fix these problems.
Guildwars2,3e2khr,LookingForTracyTzu,5,Tue Jul 21 14:07:26 2015 UTC,"True, but I think they have done a decent job listening to players thus far. I mean they are only human."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Greatwoolf,0,Tue Jul 21 14:16:52 2015 UTC,Well yeah humans but also humans that most likely studied game design or something along those lines.
Guildwars2,3e2khr,LookingForTracyTzu,2,Tue Jul 21 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"Just because you make suggestions doesn't mean they will be listened to, because like you said, it is arena net's game. They decide what is important or not.  I mean if they listen to me, the elementalist wouldn't be getting warhorn, but it is their game all I can do is either find a new class, keep complaining and or don't buy the expansion."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,silvermember,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:17 2015 UTC,"Well, they could start by balancing rewards.  This is something that has been reccommended to Anet pretty much since day 1, but the dungeon rewards have remained the same.  Making harder stuff more rewarding and easier stuff that is currently too rewarding less so, means that players can choose between what content they actually like. They won't feel forced to do the ""easier dungeons"" because even though the harder ones take longer, you should earn a gold per hour close to that of a faster path.  My goal here wasn't to complain about PvE, but rather the nonchalant attitude of the devs in regards to both instances PvE and WvW that have basically been left to rot as far as we can tell."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Greatwoolf,4,Tue Jul 21 14:02:55 2015 UTC,"I persoanlly think that removing the rubberband efect on mobs in dungeons would help make them a bit more challenging so instead of running past them you have to actually fight them of face them all at once as you run deeper in to the dungeon.   I'm not sure about the rewards, I mean dungeons are very profitable now as it is.   PvE and WvW are getting a facelift and new content so for now I dont see an issue, specially as more than likely there will be a new WvW season starting as soon as the new borderlands get in place and are debugged.  I dont know, Im not knocking your post, I just have a different view point.  Good luck!"
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Greatwoolf,3,Tue Jul 21 14:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when i say balancing rewards i mean making paths that mechanically take longer or are harder are more rewarding. Like how arah P2 gives the same gold amount as Arah P4, which naturally takes longer, meaning the only way people can run P4 and make up for the lost opportunity of running P2 and aome other dungeons is to sell the path in LFG.  And yeah, i'm hoping they make some big changes to trash mobs in dungeons, along with making bosses more difficult and not melt before they can get their attacks off.  Overall i'm hoping for more content for hardcore players of all gamemodes (and ik people will hate me for this, but a nerf or removal of chest farming)"
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Greatwoolf,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:54 2015 UTC,"some good ideas, I would be up for an ""unofficial"" cdi at the GW2 forums to bring this to the attention of the devs as long as it is a discution and not just rants  and toxic coments."

Guildwars2,3e2khr,fulaghee,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, personally i stay the hell away from posting on the forums as much as possible, but most of these are issues already brought up with Anet."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Tim_Burton,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:23 2015 UTC,fractals are in need of a HUGE rewards overhaul. I can run a 40min long lvl49 fractal and get 1.4g or I can run an 8-10min faceroll AC and get 1.7g.
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Greatwoolf,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"Rewards need 3 main things:   Personal progress scaling: The more you do in a path like defeating more enemies and completing more bonus events, the more rewards you get at the end. If you arrive late you will still be rewarded for the time and effort spent in the path, but you won't get full rewards for not doing full paths. Anything done while you are present will count towards progress for all present in the dungeon as long as you don't go AFK, so players would even be able to split and do bonus events separately if they are skilled enough to speed up progress and get more rewards. This will not only reward people better, it will be a great detriment against kicking players to put other people in the path. Dynamically adjusted rewards: Dungeons will get leatherboards and gather also statistics of how many people do each path and how much do they take for each path, and each week, the data gathered will be used to adjust the rewards. The base rewards will be reduced, but only the paths more visited will get just the base rewards. The paths least visited will get a bonus reward effect, and the rest that are not visited too often nor very rarely will get a bonus effect that averages rewards similar to those we have now.  Completion bonus. Similar to GWO's storybooks, but requiring full completion instead partial. Doing all paths should produce a bonus reward. Probably in the form of a repeatable Dungeon Master that gives a loot chest containing extra tokens, gold and dungeon gear boxes (and a relatively high chance for ascended boxes). This will compensate for the extra time that the slower paths may take, by giving a bonus rewards when all paths are done. This will also ensure there will always be someone wanting to do any path. Even the Aetherblade.    These three measures will ad up together making sure that those that go an extra mile and go through the hardest or longest paths are appropiately rewarded, even more if they go an extra mile and do all paths. And those who go for the quick and easy get rewards befitting quick and easy."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Symorphy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:57 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of a repeatable Dungeon master for a chance of an ascended item... It'd be better if it'd be a guaranteed ascended item.  They could do that with fractals too. You need to do all fractals and you get a good bunch of +1 agony infusions, or a straight +5 agony infusion."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Tim_Burton,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:17:56 2015 UTC,"I mean what makes a HC player? you play dungeons? ... WvW? ... PvP? .... PvE events? ... all of the above?   If it has a leaderboard, and you're trying to rank on it, you're a HC player. And that, I think, is the biggest difference between PvE and PvP. If ANet at least added timed rankings to PvE and dished out rewards based on ranks, it would be vastly different."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,wasdica,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:15:29 2015 UTC,"that would be interesting, but that would punish people that dont have much time to play, dont you think?"
Guildwars2,3e2khr,plank_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:22 2015 UTC,"punish people that dont have much time to play   ""Test seasons"" with rewards for the top x% have been there for PvP. And they did not have a rating system but instead those points, so the top players were exactly those who fatmed the most."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Captain_Haile,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:52 2015 UTC,"Depends on how they dished out rewards, and based on what criteria. It would also depend on the reward.    If it's a personal record, and your competition are other players, then yes, it would be too competitive.    However, I think it would be best if it was guild based. So, as long as your party consists of 3-5 members representing the same guild, your score will be counted. I also think the rankings/rewards should be based on overall average times, rather than pure rankings (like, 1st, 2nd 3rd etc).    In other words, you are running against the average time of all runs completed, rather than running against other guilds. There could be ranks based on percentiles, though - so, the top 15% fastest guilds per week, for example, would get something better than those in the 25-15%.    Those rewards, imo, shouldn't be exclusive. They could be things like guild commendations, limited tiered achievements, and extra tokens for whichever dungeon you're running."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Lon-ami,15,Tue Jul 21 14:59:09 2015 UTC,"The problem everyone is having, and that I used to have, is that you're a hardcore dedicated player playing a very lax and casual game. Once you realize that, you'll be happier. Go pick up another game to main, and wait for stuff to happen in Gw2; or just farm gold and wait around in game."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Captain_Haile,6,Tue Jul 21 14:31:33 2015 UTC,"One thing I've found that applies more generally, is that people can love the idea of something more than the way it's realized (how it actually plays), or the conditions that come with it to make it work."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,purecontact,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:57 2015 UTC,"As nice as that sounds, i wouldn't be able to stop playing this game. Or even play it on the side."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,hollywood_rag,22,Tue Jul 21 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: the only hardcore community Anet is appealing to at the moment is PvPers, with monthly tournaments, lots of coverage, and nearly all balance changes considering PvP first, PvE and WvW have been left in the dust.   ....  Yeah, this is complete and utter bullshit and it detracts from a very reasonable argument you made."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Captain_Haile,2,Tue Jul 21 14:02:08 2015 UTC,"You're ignoring all the money ArenaNet has put in eSports tournaments.  The fan-organized dungeon tournaments got more views than the sPvP ones, and they have no support at all."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Captain_Haile,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:46:41 2015 UTC,"How is it bullshit? PvP is highly promoted by Anet while PvE hasnt seen content changes in over a year, and WvW has kept the same terrible tactics since launch.  Edit: not trying to be confrontational, just not sure what part of it you think is bullshit?"
Guildwars2,3e2khr,oretoh,3,Tue Jul 21 14:05:01 2015 UTC,"Define ""promoted"":  what elements of A.Net's treatment of PvP make you wish you'd be on the receiving end of? The lack of solo/team queue? A.Net allowing match manipulation and consequentially completely devaluing all of the mode's rewards? ""Leaderboards""? Matchmaking? Absolutely shitty new maps? The last balance being focused on PvE?  There's a reason why PvP is dead and it's not because A.Net is trying too hard.  Seriously, as I said: I think A.Net has been dropping the ball and you point out nicely how that shows in terms of instanced PvE content. But you should have stuck with that."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,oretoh,4,Tue Jul 21 14:14:59 2015 UTC,"Define ""promoted""   World Tournament Series?   In game buff and in real life marketing.  Sounds like it is a promotion to this kind of content."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Gandarel,6,Tue Jul 21 16:57:40 2015 UTC,The last balance was focused on pve? Wat? It changed close to nothing in pve :-D
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Gandarel,3,Tue Jul 21 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"I thought match manipulation only happened in hot join?  Anyways, I didnt mean to say that PvP is getting good content. Just that it is getting any content. That, along with tournaments constantly being streamed, while speedrunning dungeons, and WvW fights, and GvGs are all hosted by players, having a buff that gives additional rank ooints and reward track xp shows that PvP, while broken, is what Anet wants people to turn their attention to."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Gandarel,3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:03 2015 UTC,"As I have said: feel free to point out issues with instanced PvE. They are worth pointing out.  But there's no reason to to point the finger of envy towards something else, especially when you manage to point it towards something that you REALLY do not want to be envious of. I think an argument could be made easily that instanced PvE content is, despite its lack of support, still in a better shape than basically all of non-PvE content. So to argue that this is something you wish for, really doesn't add anything to the discussion. And it's a shame, because now we're focusing on this instead of what's worth discussing: and that's A.Net's lack of support for instanced PvE content."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Huxtl,5,Tue Jul 21 14:43:55 2015 UTC,"Ok then, i'll remove it from the post if that one sentence is so troubling."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,stupidbookah,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:55 2015 UTC,"As much as I enjoy getting the upvotes, I think it might be better if you deleted the post and posted it again, but kept the focus on PvE. And with a better title, of course.  It's a decent post otherwise and I am sure it will get folks talking about the subject."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,lokikaraoke,4,Tue Jul 21 14:52:56 2015 UTC,I made a post on the forums and made some edits to remove the comparison to PvP. Idk if i should resubmit here though because it may be considered spam.
Guildwars2,3e2khr,elephantsinthealps,-4,Tue Jul 21 15:02:31 2015 UTC,Over a year? The LS only ended 6 months ago and we got a rebuilt LA a few weeks ago.  Stop making up points.
Guildwars2,3e2khr,lokikaraoke,4,Tue Jul 21 14:28:42 2015 UTC,Please read the post.  This post is not about open world PvE. It is about instanced PvE.  In my opinion these should be held as 2 separate game modes because they are drastically different.
Guildwars2,3e2khr,SpectralDagger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:13 2015 UTC,"Ah ok then, next time mention intanced PvE in the TL:DR instead of only ""PvE""."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,silvermember,3,Tue Jul 21 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"Whoops, didnt realize i did that, thanks!"
Guildwars2,3e2khr,lokikaraoke,7,Tue Jul 21 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"we have not had any new fractals added since November 26th 2013, over a year ago.   Well, the last ranked PvP map was added in 2012.    but only when used to exploit PvP did Anet care.   Rank farm has been a thing for years now, not a single ban was given despite being illegal.    meanwhile, PvP tournaments are a monthly thing   It's great for those ~20 people per region who actually participate, yes. What about everyone else? And it's mainly done by 3rd party except for the largest events once or twice a year, afaik. They don't even have an in-game tournament infrastucture with rewards.  PvP gets promoted more, but PvE gets way more attention and resources."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,OWRaif,2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah but maps have little affect on the play of PvP when it's all conquest. They have since revamped ranks, rewards that allow you to get skins that used to be considered prestigious to have collected all of them from dungeons, advertise tournaments constantly, have the heart of the mists buff, etc.  I should've put it in the OP but i mentioned it in a comment here, it isnt that PvP is recieving good additions, it's that it's receiving any additions.  And tbh, this is only because we're in a content drought, normally it'd be open world PvE and the living story receiving this attention.  Edit: yeah, PvE does. But instanced PvE gets pretty much none. There isnt even a team for dungeons and fractals any more."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,silvermember,0,Tue Jul 21 14:43:53 2015 UTC,"They have since revamped destroyed ranks   FTFY   rewards that allow you to get skins   The amount of skins you can get from Pvp were drastically reduced.   yeah, PvE does. But instanced PvE gets pretty much none.   That's true, they really should care about that, dungeons are the core of PvE. But don't OP's blaming it on PvP developement.. no, the overwhelming majority of resources are likely going to PvE, just not to the right part of it. Blame open world and living story."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Lon-ami,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i changed that in the OP and made my forum post talk about how all other game modes lose out to open world PvE."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,tuckfechies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:35 2015 UTC,Let's just hope the expansion takes another direction :)
Guildwars2,3e2khr,XephyrGW2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i honestly wouldnt mind if they stopped doing the LS. Too many mechanical things wrong with basic parts of the game that should be visited first imo.  Seems to me like HoT is seeking to fix a lot of these things so hopefully many of these issues won't matter soon enough."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Lon-ami,9,Tue Jul 21 15:20:33 2015 UTC,"Anet is releasing a huge expansion, wouldn't it be best if we all relaxed until more information about its content is released? I can understand being impatient in the wait, but they may very well be addressing a majority of our concerns already.."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Lon-ami,2,Tue Jul 21 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"I think this is the reasonable answer. Once HoT is out, we should take another look at game modes and give them feedback. I know we're all frustrated, waiting for this thing to come out, and a lot of people don't have faith that it will fix anything... But we should probably wait and see before getting the pitchforks out."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Quick_FYI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:49 2015 UTC,"I didnt want to come out and say it, but this is mostly in response to the WvW outrage. Kinda my way of saying ""look, all game modes have their problems and we're all gonna have to ride this one out"""
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Quick_FYI,6,Tue Jul 21 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"So I think the main issue is that you treat ArenaNet as a single company with a unified strategy and not multiple business units which have their own goals.  Try this.   From a development perspective, ArenaNet seems to be solely focused on building casual PvE content. ArenaNet's marketing team spends most of their time and money creating, promoting, and running sPvP tournaments. WvW gets some attention in the form of updated maps, but is mostly left to languish with just a few buffs (which require little development effort) turned on occasionally. ""Seasons"" used to be a thing but seem to have stopped as the focus has turned to HoT. Instanced PvE seems to have been completely forgotten by everybody for almost 2 years now. This is probably because there's no team in ArenaNet focused on this game mode. You know, because they were fired/reassigned."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Quick_FYI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:32 2015 UTC,Imma link this comment in the OP. Very good points i failed to think of!
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Quick_FYI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:22 2015 UTC,"to be fair, anet rarely runs tournaments. mistpedia/esl handles them for anet, I think they only get involved for LAN events, which are rare."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Lon-ami,3,Tue Jul 21 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"There's still a fair bit of work on Anet's side, including prize money, but you are correct. It's things like WTS that require substantially more effort."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,frsguy,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:37:14 2015 UTC,"Prize money for the Go4s comes from ESL. Gems and Llamas for ESL, AG, and AspectGG all come from Anet. They do put a lot of effort into the WTS, though."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,KittyCatHugs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"Well that is not really accurate. Since you can have more than one strategy.  It is more accurate to say that their main focus is PvE, since it generates money. They don't need to bother too much because PvE is heavily supported.  WvW seasons probably stopped because a lot of active WvWer hated it and actually demanded that they stopped, ""casual players took my queue"".   WvWer for all their complaints about the lack of updates, hate it when newer players or casuals join and ruin their fun. The irony is that you need those newer players in other to justify more resources for a very small and insignificant game mode (compared to PvE).  SPvP never really had a chance, it needed more than one game mode and I suspect Arena net thought they would soon add in, but given how the game's direction has changed 3 or more times I can see why.  Also marketing team doesn't spend most of their time and money on SPvP tournaments, but I can see why you would think that. let me just say that marketing involves more than making a tournament once in a few months."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Thatguy7778,0,Tue Jul 21 17:48:36 2015 UTC,"Also marketing team doesn't spend most of their time and money on SPvP tournaments, but I can see why you would think that. let me just say that marketing involves more than making a tournament once in a few months.   I thought about this after I wrote it and you're right. I wish I had worded it backward - ""most of the attention that we see given to sPvP comes from marketing"" - rather than saying marketing spends 50%+ of their effort on PvP (which is almost certainly not the case.)"

Guildwars2,3e2khr,WillX47,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:12 2015 UTC,"The worse aspect of the game has been dungeons since long ago, but WvWers and PvPers will always cry they're the worse treated community.  WvW got a revamped borderlands, the wvw ranks and new siege skills, and an entire new map. They're getting a new map with the expansion too.  Then sPvP got 3 new conquest maps and 1 new map for a new mode: Deathmatch. Also constant eSports tournaments. Getting a new map with a new mode in the expansion.  Does this mean WvW and sPvP are healthy and don't need improvements? Hell no. Hackers for the first, and leaderboards for the second have been a priority since long ago, and we get nothing. Both need a lot of improvements.  But dungeons are in a way worse state. 2 fucking years without no new dungeons. Fractal weapon skins broken since 2 years ago. Levels reseted for nothing.  And chances are high dungeons will be kill with the expansion. So yeah.  PS: Guilds are in a worse state than WvW and sPvP as well. Guild missions have been the same for 3 years, with no updates and no achievements to reward replayability. The only PvE getting love is basic open world, story, and world bosses (kinda)."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Penagon,2,Tue Jul 21 18:52:24 2015 UTC,"The bad part about it is WvWers are obligated to play PvE to fund their game mode, as do PvPers for skins.  So instead of fixing dungeons, they made open world insanely rewarding and super faceroll. That way WvWers and PvPers could get their gold with ease.  In the process that meant an entire aspect of the game was widely left to rot."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Exa102,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:17 2015 UTC,"Everything would be easier if each mode got a few unique stuff to work for.  Being independent from the other modes would be good as well. PvP already is, you don't need gold at all to play, and WvW could use some balancing so you don't need to spend gold either."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,Caerbanoob,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"Just a sidenote: people also tend to ignore and dismiss everything Anet released as content because they don't like it. WvW is second only to open PvE content update wise and yet ""WvW never gets anything"" is almost a popular statement as that ""there is no endgame"", and just as wrong."
Guildwars2,3e2khr,GetHypeSon,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:46 2015 UTC,"100% agree but i posted a comment pointing out that WvW map size will have increased by 50%-100% depending what maps you consider ""WvW"" but got downvoted to hell.

Guildwars2,3e2ule,OKarizee,11,Tue Jul 21 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"well, ""every couple weeks"" isn't ""every two weeks exactly"". and i wouldn't go expecting anything major from those."
Guildwars2,3e2ule,BrunoBRS,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:34 2015 UTC,Every couple weeks in balancing time for anet means every 16~20 weeks. We will probably see one big balance patch before the game is released and a few bugfixing/slight shaving along the way.
Guildwars2,3e2ule,Nebbii,8,Tue Jul 21 18:38:02 2015 UTC,Where have you been since they updated the trait system?

Guildwars2,3e2ule,BastiatCF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"it was mentioned by colin in passing in the livestream. I do expect a larger bug fix patch toda probably with some balance tweaking. That said, it is 8:30 am at ANet, so I wouldnt say that there wont be for a few more hours at least"
Guildwars2,3e2ule,SoloWaltz,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:01 2015 UTC,"Their common schedule is 1 content/balance patch 1 BLTP patch. So the ""real"" patches happen every two weeks. After two years one is used to this schedule.  But I believe this week's content is the golem event."

Guildwars2,3dyj3y,ErifEci,78,Mon Jul 20 16:36:44 2015 UTC,Elementalist uses Bubblebeam against Primordus  It's super effective!
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Amiron,94,Mon Jul 20 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"It's neutral, because Primordus is Fire/Dragon"

Guildwars2,3dyj3y,albinopanda,94,Mon Jul 20 16:04:05 2015 UTC,TOOOT
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Pathos_Vermilion,59,Mon Jul 20 17:28:21 2015 UTC,If there's one class that can make warhorn be awesome it would be elementalist.
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,XephyrGW2,115,Mon Jul 20 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone's so upset about warhorn, this still means eles get 8 new weapon skills. That's more than any other class does even if they get a 2 hander."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Coroch,77,Mon Jul 20 16:12:04 2015 UTC,I'm more upset about warhorn skin than the fact we got warhorn.
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,RandommUser,22,Mon Jul 20 16:16:00 2015 UTC,I'm upset 'cause this means dagger is still going to be only melee weapons for eles till next expansion... celes everywhere
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Aezoc,23,Mon Jul 20 16:35:07 2015 UTC,"I don't really think there's a lot of design space for other elementalist melee weapons. Dagger would have to be redesigned first, because it's kind of a jack-of-all-trades. It cleaves, it has good power scaling, long range (for melee), and it also applies burning and bleeding reasonably well."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,XephyrGW2,23,Mon Jul 20 16:52:32 2015 UTC,I think warhorns are pretty cool personally. Especially those with a unique sound effect. It'll be interesting to see how the elementalist will use it.
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Bainos,11,Mon Jul 20 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"While we're talking about sound effects, wasn't there something with the legendary warhorn not working or something ?"
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Perkinz,29,Mon Jul 20 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Howler has been broken, missing the vast majority of its effects for like, two years now."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Furious_Sonar,10,Mon Jul 20 18:15:19 2015 UTC,You mean that SAB-warhorn-of-Earth will sound differently than the SAB-warhorn-of-Lightning?
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Echosys,8,Mon Jul 20 16:25:53 2015 UTC,other warhorns have unique sounds too.
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,bigfoot8fred,49,Mon Jul 20 16:37:01 2015 UTC,"It isnt cause it's less skills. Warhorn animations are literally all the same. ""Oh look, i blew a horn, oh look i blew a horn and bugs are around me, oh look i blew a horn and it shot out green stuff""  Combine that with the only halfway decent looking warhorn skins being bltc ones or the fractal one and it just sucks all around as far as aesthetics go."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Furious_Sonar,52,Mon Jul 20 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"You have it wrong. Get it right:  ""I blew a horn! I blew a horn again! ho-ho I blew it again!"""
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,specs112,26,Mon Jul 20 16:29:32 2015 UTC,doot doot
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,DreadNephromancer,12,Mon Jul 20 18:00:41 2015 UTC,thank mr necral
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,stormrunner89,18,Mon Jul 20 21:15:49 2015 UTC,"If any class can make it more interesting, it's the ele. I imagine it's more likely that you'll be doing something other than blowing the horn over and over.  You could use the same tone and argument for a sword too. ""I slashed and fire came out! I slashed and electricity came out!"" Etc. but seriously, if ele already has daggers, how different would the sword skills be?"
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,bigfoot8fred,5,Mon Jul 20 16:38:34 2015 UTC,"And on dagger we already have 2 ""breath"" skills that i would imagine wouldve been better suited for warhorn  Yeah, ele will make it interesting for sure, but warhorn skins are mostly reskins of the same handful of boring ones,   sword would have attacks in which you move the sword differently. Warhorn would have to just move it from your waist to your mouth and then have some attunement based particle effects, or summon something, or whatever."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,1Down,2,Mon Jul 20 16:44:30 2015 UTC,"The ele doesn't use daggers like daggers. It could have used a sword like an actual sword. What I mean is the dagger now is just ""close range spells"" where a sword could be actual melee.  But I'm personally not upset by lack of sword. I'm just worried that the warhorn will be lame. I'm waiting to hear other details about the new stuff before I actually judge though."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,TheWhiteWolf08,3,Mon Jul 20 21:05:07 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for a water skill to be:  You blow and a fountain of water shoots up overhead, the comes crashing down either on your opponent, causing them to be knocked down under a stream of crashing water  Or It comes down in front of you as a tidal wave, creating a knockback, and carrying your opponent away."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Suzukou,17,Mon Jul 20 18:11:29 2015 UTC,Necro got 10 including reaper's shroud :3
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,XephyrGW2,17,Mon Jul 20 16:52:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah that's true! But let's be real here, Necros need all the love they can get. :P"
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Kalulosu,11,Mon Jul 20 17:47:20 2015 UTC,"Especially since I never got any explanation on how Sword would be more interesting than ""well it's Dagger but a bit different"" for Eles..."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,XaeiIsareth,5,Mon Jul 20 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"Faster attacks, more melee physical damage orientated instead of being an all-rounder, strike using your sword as opposed to using your weapon as a focus for spells."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,pyrespirit,9,Mon Jul 20 18:25:35 2015 UTC,"I dislike the majority of dagger models, I like the majority of sword models.  I grew up playing spellsword characters in any game that supported them - especially in the Elder Scrolls series - and would have liked to have that in GW2.  Those are all very subjective reasons, but no less valid.  Never been a fan of warhorn as a weapon - it's always seemed quite a bit mehriffic to me. Of all the instruments used to signal in battles, it's one that I've never liked.  Now, give me a flaming bagpipe-playing elementalist and I'll be all behind musical elementalism."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,modomario,4,Mon Jul 20 18:44:35 2015 UTC,"Well eles haven't used daggers like you might expect and like other classes mostly have.  You dash forward. Breath fire. Make a circle of fire. Get an aura. Whiph your opponenet with electricity. Never was it really: stab, stab, stab, stab again.  The same would be expected from sword. You put it in the ground and a cool aoe happens. You spin around with your sword stretched out. You jump at the enemy like a warrior. You swipe it and push back enemies with a gust of wind.  Warhorn makes it a bit more difficult to imagine cool stuff and cool animations. You don't expect straightup mobility from a warhorn other than swiftness and the like which would fit with the mainhand dagger or scepter.  Offhand also has less skills and higher cooldowns."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Kolz,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:30 2015 UTC,Well dagger is not a true melee weapon for starters. Eles don't have any (non conjured) weapons with auto attack chains.
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Alesthes,24,Mon Jul 20 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know why someone has to pretend that he doesn't know why everyone is so upset about warhorn, while it is just obvious.     Warhorn compared to sword means less skills, less impact on your playstyle, abysmal skins. Not to consider that spellsword is a cool RPG archetype since the beginning of time and that worhorn still needs to be paired with dagger or scepter, and that's it.     We can still hope that the Tempest will have wonderful spells and mechanics, sure, but why people are upset over getting a horn while expecting a sword is just evident."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Eveeeeeeee,13,Mon Jul 20 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"Dagger and scepter ( main hands) are worse than staff, I dont see any way how warhorn will make it better."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,atchadwi,5,Mon Jul 20 16:22:01 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I'm thinking. Especially since offhands in GW2 are typically more support/defense/utility related. Obviously there's some exceptions to this (dagger OH ele), but it's going to have to do a lot to makeup for the DPS loss of using a scepter over staff."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,CrimsonBlade104,8,Mon Jul 20 16:48:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sad cause sword would've been fun, but it's completely fair for that reason. An OH is still 8 new skills!"
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Hoojiwat,7,Mon Jul 20 16:18:18 2015 UTC,And we still don't know what skills and new mechanic the class is going to get either!
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,XaeiIsareth,3,Mon Jul 20 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is that offhands are mainly utillity based where you fire off a skill every now and then, whereas your mainhand is what mainly defines how you play."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,M1M1R,45,Mon Jul 20 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"RIP in pepperonis, 1-h sword hyper.  But in all seriousness, I'm sure this'l be interesting. When I first saw Chronomancer in the reveal trailer, I had 0 hype. I've never really had an interest in the mesmer, and I'm not a huge fan of shields in this game. The Chronomancer reveal, however, has me considering rolling a Mesmer.  Here's to hoping the Tempest gets some cool new toys."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Mr_Lafar,23,Mon Jul 20 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm hoping this is similar. Also, a good reason to have more warhorns. Swords are already everywhere. With Chronomancer I started looking at more shield skins, and this will make me take a look at warhorns for the first time in a looooong time."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Amaya_,8,Mon Jul 20 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"Be prepared to be underwhelmed... I just did the same, and there's really none that caught my eye as ""omg I'm gonna need that for my ele"" >>"
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Mr_Lafar,2,Mon Jul 20 17:53:54 2015 UTC,"Dang. :/ Oh well, the playstyle could still be really fun."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,mrlemonofbanana,11,Mon Jul 20 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"IIRC, all we ever had pointing to 1H Sword were the datamined ""sword skills"", which were the main hand dagger skills put under a new header. Seeing that Anet is aware of both the concepts of hype and datamining, I am 95% sure that was a troll move."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,ArcherspadeTT,3,Mon Jul 20 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"IIRC there were genuinely new skills throughout those tooltips, and the rest were looked at as ""placeholders"". I think they were having trouble matching their concept to the sword and probably got an inspiration to take it in a new direction. I wholeheartedly expected to not love every specialization to drop this go round and that's fine. There's always room for a sword next go round."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Atzaru,28,Mon Jul 20 17:23:26 2015 UTC,Someone just bought the entire Tempest Warhorn Stock.

Ok some sort of Condi-set they lack that right cause they don't have many bleeds... umm wait what about that burning build?  Well maybe this will be field based give them some sort of utility they don't already have access to, damage isn't everything after all and they could give up some....... come again, glyph of storms? They can already create a blinding area, area Vul and a bunch of other stuff?  In all seriousness, while this DOES look cool, my worry with the elementalist is that Anet can't really give them anything that they don't already have access to without making them overpowered. This isn't the Reaper where there are a ton of glaring holes the elite spec could fill. I can't think of any sort of niche playstyle Anet could enhance.

Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Absolutionis,34,Mon Jul 20 16:11:45 2015 UTC,"It's mostly because people think the warhorn looks lame. It's purely subjective.  Additionally, from a datamine a while ago, people assumed it was going to be a Sword, and swords are ""cool""."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Alether,17,Mon Jul 20 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"Not just that it looks lame - all current warhorn implementations are pretty lame and boring in my opinion, compared to a focus, dagger, or any offhand except shield, really.  It's always one swiftness skill and something else random. Can be strong, but it's very unexciting."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Okay_sure_lets_post,10,Mon Jul 20 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"Well, my issue is I have a hard time imagining what a warhorn will offer other than PBAoE damage/boons...which we can do with current weapon sets.  Hopefully ANet is more imaginative than me, and make warhorn provide a radically different playstyle available to the Ele."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Wulfgarion,12,Mon Jul 20 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"because a big amount of eles believed that they would be getting sword since some sword skills were datamined and believed to be from tempest elite spec, some even bought expensive skins such as bolt to prepare for it, when the warhorn was datamined suggesting its possibility as elite weapon they started to moan, some of the arguments were ""because eles have no real melee weapon, dagger doesnt count because it has range"" ""warhorn makes no sense on magic user"" and ""we need a new main hand weapon because: skills"".  considering how bitter the vocal minority is in this reddit iam prepared for the avalanche of kittenposts complaining to anet lying about the tempest sword, sounds funny actually."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Maarius81,8,Mon Jul 20 16:15:54 2015 UTC,"not everyone is bitter about it, I would have loved the sword (Battlemage says hello) but I'm ok with warhorn as well.   The thing that will be more important than 2-3 new skills per attunement will be the changed profession mechanic and the new utility group imho."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Raraiya,22,Mon Jul 20 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"Oooh, I see where they're going with this. It's another ""high concept"" theme. The Tempest is a class which utilizes the tears (water), screams and despairing wails (air), rage (fire) of all those ele players who cried for weeks that they did not want a warhorn.  This faction of the elementalist profession will attempt to scare Mordremoth away by dramatically blowing into a horn. He will be terrified. In fact, that dragon won't even know what hit him.  What about Earth, you ask? Well, this will replace the Tempest's skill bar entirely with a new summoned weapon, the shovel, with which the Tempest can dig him or herself a hole to lie in, and cry. This is needed for those times when other classes, with their shiny new Staves, Shields, Greatswords, Hammers, and Longbows laugh at the Tempest, for their questionable life decision of setting out to truly perfect the art of blowing into a silly looking horn in a most dramatic fashion."
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,AJSDudeComedy,7,Mon Jul 20 17:39:02 2015 UTC,Seeing all the whining about not getting sword has shown me that maybe data mining can be a bad thing. Get hyped over shit that's not even in the game and then let down when shit changes.
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,joe_chester,6,Mon Jul 20 21:36:18 2015 UTC,gg to all eles who allready crafted bolt in advance :D
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,diruuo,33,Mon Jul 20 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"Side note - is that glowing blue lightning bolt thingy the new shoulder piece? If so you can definitely colour me intrigued. Gonna go great with my Zodiac armor look.   Reposting for visibility - I think it is 1) incredibly awesome and 2) far more interesting then sword when we already have dagger. Maybe offensive version of an off-hand as opposed to the defensive one that Focus currently represents? More damage then dagger off hand, less blasts then either of the off hands (although if something makes sense as a blast weapon it's a Warhorn) I think this is far cooler overall and is further away from what Elementalist currently does. Sword would've filled the same role that dagger fills. (Slash at melee for cleaving damage)  Let's hold off the pitchforks and wait for the actual reveal. If nothing else this is far more interesting and unusual then boring ol' sword. :P"
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Alesthes,12,Mon Jul 20 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"Sword could have filled a different role than Dagger in so many ways that it hurts, both mechanically and thematically. It could have been actual melee instead of short range, it could have been single target instead of AoE, it could have been mostly condition instead of direct damage, it could have been used as an actual weapon instead of just a catalist for spells, etc. It's not that hard to imagine, seriously."

People constantly say there's no 'good' skins for them, but for me, there's tons of 'good' skins. Lionguard, Balthazar, Howler, Dragon Jade, Tormented, SAB skins etc. List goes on. I probably have more Warhorn skins unlocked than any other weapon for my Warrior.   Given that Ele's are about to be able to toot toot, there's a nice little selection of thematic choices for you to use as well. Even Sylvari Ele's have a number of choices! I don't know, just my opinion."

Guildwars2,3dyj3y,JkTyrant,6,Mon Jul 20 16:13:06 2015 UTC,By a general rule everything held in the left hand is always an off-hand weapon.

Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Aimless_Vagabond,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:33 2015 UTC,The problem is the offhand only weapons have a lower cost than other 1h weapons in certain places in the game don't they? Like dungeon tokens and wvw badges? I can't check but I wanted to think they were.
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Frostwake,2,Mon Jul 20 17:33:30 2015 UTC,Not exactly a big problem imo.
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,Kondibon,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"As of right now, weapons are classified as either two handed, one handed or offhanded. Warhorn, shield, torch and focus are offhand weapons. I doubt ANet wants to change that system for now so it'll probably be an offhand weapon. Besides, how would you create an auto attack for warhorn? I'm trying to imagine a Tempest tooting every second to fire elemental bolts and it's quite silly."

Guildwars2,3dyj3y,stupidbookah,6,Tue Jul 21 03:21:11 2015 UTC,I don't think warhorn is a bad choice. Sure it may not be super cool like a main hand sword. But thematically it makes a lot of sense with the Tempest calling storms with a magic warhorn.
Guildwars2,3dyj3y,MrIgnavia,5,Mon Jul 20 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"I know warhorn doesn't seem like a very cool weapon (I mean, it's not really a ""weapon"" at all) but it will be very interesting to see how exactly elementalists will use this.

Guildwars2,3dyj3y,LookingForTracyTzu,5,Mon Jul 20 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how they want to make warhorn useful. It's just the offhand, so you have to choose either dagger or scepter to go along with it and neither weapon can compete with staff at the moment."

Guildwars2,3dyj3y,almoostashar,5,Mon Jul 20 17:58:25 2015 UTC,The problem with this is that both focus and dagger are very viable offhand... so why would we want another offhand? Another offhand would still see the same builds. While a main hand would maybe see more build variety. Warhorn main hand? Why not!

Guildwars2,3e0zgf,richardjcompton,47,Tue Jul 21 03:03:04 2015 UTC,"I think I'm in the minority when I say I definitely like warhorn for ele. I like how it fits with the theme of the expansion - it's very primal. I think kind of like some sort of tribal nature shaman calling down meteors and lightning storms on hordes of enemies. I'm hoping that they can make the animations visceral and impactful enough, but honestly ele lacks in that department already... at least disproportionately to the kind of magic it uses. The skins could be better, but hopefully we'll be getting enough new ones to compensate for that."
Guildwars2,3e0zgf,BonesAndHubris,13,Tue Jul 21 03:53:47 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that, you know....for a specialization called TEMPEST, blowing a warhorn makes more sense than slashing a sword.  Besides, we never even had any form of confirmation that Sword was coming for Ele. Everyone just said they wanted it and it suddenly became fact when there was nothing to back that fact up.

My hope for sword really hinged on this fact - all the other weapons just didn't feel right for ele. But if anet can make the warhorn mesh well with scepter, I'll give it a shot."
Guildwars2,3e0zgf,Mojohito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:48 2015 UTC,"The previous interpretation of the name was a swordsman blowing through the enemy ranks like a storm, which fitted a melee spellsword's description perfectly."

Guildwars2,3e0zgf,Sakatsu_Dkon,2,Tue Jul 21 12:03:15 2015 UTC,Do you think it's possible that they could just be reworking the dagger? Like it was suggested in the video?

Guildwars2,3e0zgf,Sevenix2,3,Tue Jul 21 07:34:17 2015 UTC,Weapon swap will never happen mate. we have 20 skills and you want 40 now? That will give too much versatility and it cannot be balanced.

I won't argue that a fury/swiftness/might-partybuff-5 would be terrible, but I just believe this is not going to happen.  On the other hand, I cannot say yet because i do not know the skills."

I also like the idea of a skill where the horn blows itself cos, yaknow, we control the winds. We're not necessarily going to see that same animation every single time.  Whatever happens, using this (http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Super_Warhorn_Skin) and playing the same super adventure box sound effect 8 times in a row while traiting specifically for skill cooldowns I'm sure will justify the spec! ...Right?"
Guildwars2,3e0zgf,WoodenPotatoes,5,Tue Jul 21 06:13:21 2015 UTC,I guess I am the only one who is more worried about the utilities and trait line more than the weapon. I am worried whether the trait line can replace water/arcana in pvp or replace fire in pve. If the trait line does any one of them i will be so happy. And i want ONE good elite more than anything.

Guildwars2,3e0zgf,Choc0mus,7,Tue Jul 21 13:42:09 2015 UTC,"I'm also in the minority in that I LOVE the idea for a Warhorn!  I mean, come on. Why do we need a sword? We already have Lava Font and Lightning Whip as our melee options. If anything else, they should fix the other dagger main-hand skills, instead of band-aiding it with an entire weapon.  Skin-wise, Warhorns have some nice gems. Fractal Warhorn, Sclerite Warhorn, Super Warhorn, and Howler, all look pretty cool. And of course, the one for tempest. I would expect Heart of Thorns to introduce other skins as well.  My only complaint would be skill animations. I hope they're creative enough to try something other than ""I blew a horn! Hey, I blew a horn again! Oh-oh I blew the horn again!"""
Guildwars2,3e0zgf,Lishy1,10,Tue Jul 21 05:21:40 2015 UTC,Calling lava font a melee option would be like calling the necro staff a melee weapon.
Guildwars2,3e0zgf,XaeiIsareth,-7,Tue Jul 21 08:19:49 2015 UTC,"Uh, no. The difference being Lava Font is one of the highest DPS options in the game, while Necro Staff being one of the lowest."
Guildwars2,3e0zgf,Lishy1,7,Tue Jul 21 12:16:35 2015 UTC,"His/her point was it's not melee. Lava font has ±1200 range. It can be used in melee without any adverse effects, sure, but it's not a melee attack anymore than the skills on necro's staff, or Warriors LB."
Guildwars2,3e0zgf,iNeedAValidUserName,-7,Tue Jul 21 12:36:38 2015 UTC,"Lava Font is pretty ideal in melee though, otherwise you must immobilize the foe."
Guildwars2,3e0zgf,Lishy1,4,Tue Jul 21 12:38:53 2015 UTC,"Lol what are you talking about?   Lava font is on staff, a ranged weapon. No matter which way you follow this logic it's a ranged skill - same with eruption or ice spike."
Guildwars2,3e0zgf,Mojohito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think DPS matters when considering if something is melee or not.   If Anet gave a class a sword, and all the abilities have 0 damage and 10 range, it would still be a melee weapon."

Tbh, I'm just disappointed in warhorn since ""Tempest"" is such an epic name and warhorn isn't particularly awesome. However, Chronomancers are still a pretty cool elite spec despite their new weapon being a shield (even tho shield is cooler than warhorn IMO), so I guess I'll wait until the livestream to judge whether I'll stay an ele or become a Tempest."

Guildwars2,3e0zgf,unseen0000,-2,Tue Jul 21 10:17:47 2015 UTC,I think warhorn could be great. Think of the skills you can have! Water - Monsoon  - dmg and heal Earth - Sandstorm - dmg and blind Air - Typhoon - dmg and knockback Fire - Firestorm - dmg and ongoing fire dmg

Maybe throwing knives or poisoned arrows?  Maybe before the Nuhoch does a belly-flop, they jump off to hanging branches and throw bolas at players that immobilize or knock them down. So, if the players don't dodge the bolas, they can't get out of the way of the Nuhoch's bellyflop."

If you have problem with what to draw I suggest following @Sketch_Dailies on Twitter. Each day they present a new assignment.  If you have problem with a specific technique or i.e. anatomy, then use google, find guides, there are also many guides on youtube and practice! The more you draw, the better you'll be ;)  And most of all, draw what's the most interesting to you. If you love cars, draw a car, try it in black&white, try only outlines, learn to work with colors (you can start with only 2 and when you'll be satisfied with it, you can add other)  etc. etc. :)"

Guildwars2,3dzdmo,Blue_Pilot,3,Tue Jul 21 03:49:21 2015 UTC,"I think warhorn has awesome potential, and fits very well thematically! Though sword would be pretty cool too."
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,SirJakeTheRandom,7,Tue Jul 21 01:13:13 2015 UTC,"I hope it is bloody awesome. Because it is currently seated to compete with 2 already awesome offhands, but has to be paired with our limited selection of mainhand weapons and has to compete with the powerful staff build. All of which have strong utility in them as well.   I personally wasn't caring about how things fit thematically, since that doesn't help in a gameplay sense more often then not. I'm curious of how another offhand is going to change up what Eles have going for them already in terms of damage/utility."
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,Thagyr,2,Tue Jul 21 01:26:53 2015 UTC,"I'm curious of how another offhand is going to change up what Eles have going for them already in terms of damage/utility.   I expect that, like Mesmers, it will be in the elite spec mechanics.  Mesmers only have two MH (Sword/Scepter), but five OH (Focus, Pistol, Sword, Torch, now Shield) and people are still pumped about their stuff."
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,silvermember,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:24 2015 UTC,Our main hand weapons are terrible why not make a sword nope Karl decided to screw us again.

Guildwars2,3dzdmo,opinion2stronk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"The thing is: There is no way that Warhorn beats the DPS of a staff. It is just not going to happen. So it won't be used in group play.  It is an offhand so our mainhand options are Scepter (which is really really bad now with Guardian and Warrior changes) or Dagger which is good in very hard solos like Mossman but there already is Focus which is just way too good. The longest Firefield in the game, a way to remove Defiance, Condi cleanse, 4 sec invulnerability AND projectile defense. On top of 2 additional blast finishers.  It is super unrealistic that Warhon will bring anything that Focus doesnt."
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,Ranziel,0,Tue Jul 21 10:41:10 2015 UTC,Then they just need to nerf Focus and Staff.
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,opinion2stronk,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:15 2015 UTC,Thank god reddit doesnt have a say in balancing.
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,Faervhan,0,Tue Jul 21 13:01:46 2015 UTC,"I'll be confused if we only get warhorn for ele. We got Reaper which gets greatswords (5 skills), Dragon Hunter which gets bows (5 skills), seemingly staff for thief (5 skills)... and you see my point. I know we technically get 8 skills with a warhorn... but it does seem slightly underwhelming compared to what we already got. Sword AND Warhorn would give us that 5 skill mark, which is what I'm hoping they'll do (both for sense and hope.. ;-; ). Ele already has few weapons to choose from, so two more would be a nice addition."

Guildwars2,3dzdmo,Braghez,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:10:16 2015 UTC,"All people nagging about the warhorn, i understand that sword would have been cooler, but...let's talk about what truly will be interesting of the ele elite specialization ? something like...who know...how they change it's core mechanic ? :o Wich is really the vital point of ele and wich make it viable even with few weapons and no swap ?  Remember that if they change it someway...even old weapons will change...so you might actually gain much more than what you imagine.   That said, we still know literally nothing. So let's see how it develops in two days xD"
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,Cilph,-24,Tue Jul 21 11:36:11 2015 UTC,You're still getting 8 skills. Stop whining.
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,Shinsetsuu,10,Mon Jul 20 19:42:22 2015 UTC,In what way is an amusing Photoshop of art whining?
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,Criminon,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:51:00 2015 UTC,"The part that everyone keeps forgetting is its not like this is the only specialization we will see for each profession. You will eventually get swords... Just not this time. Logically you can't keep getting your favorite each expansion, eventually they will have to give your profession a weapon that you dislike.  I'm really hoping that when they give elementalists swords or great swords they make them battle mages. Hnnnng"

Because sword wasn't announced doesn't restrict me from the ability to complain that I won't be getting something that would have been 10 x cooler, nor is it any better that Im probably stuck with it for a good 3-4 years."
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,Criminon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:36:27 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that they will be rolling out xpacs faster than that, but you are correct. Its your choice to be pessimistic and complainy."
Guildwars2,3dzdmo,Raraiya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:43:06 2015 UTC,"That's nice, but the very first specialization should not have been something unpleasant. The first one should have been great and given people something they will really like, so that speculative future updates could be rendered tolerable with ""Well, we got something great the first time round"".  A distant prospect of 'perhaps, maybe' getting something we actually want years down the line does not make this better."
