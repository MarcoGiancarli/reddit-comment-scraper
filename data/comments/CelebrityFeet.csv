CelebrityFeet,3dzq0b,chrisdeli,5,Mon Jul 20 21:03:58 2015 UTC,You mean London Tipton.
CelebrityFeet,3dzq0b,the_other_view,3,Tue Jul 21 01:06:17 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why but she was my first celebrity crush. I discovered girls while The Suite Life of Zach and Cody was running and damn she was fine. I remember one of the first ""naughty"" searches I ever did was ""Brenda Song legs."" Good to know I had good taste even back then."
CelebrityFeet,3dzq0b,Nam_Erehwon,3,Tue Jul 21 01:42:48 2015 UTC,"Oh my god you and me both haha 12 year old me would google image search her so much   ""Brenda Song Boobs""  I cringe so hard with nostalgia"
CelebrityFeet,3dzq0b,Strokeandshare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:13 2015 UTC,"I remember feeling so clever using google to find out her name from ""london tipton actress"" and literally the next search was ""Brenda Song legs"" which in hindsight was a waste of my first naughty search. For some reason I was obsessed with legs when I first discovered girls. Shouldn't be surprising given I still have a love for legs and feet. Anyway, I didn't know what masturbation was back then so I would use my DS's internet browser (oldschool one which was two cartridges, one for each slot) just look at pictures of her in shorts and I will thought that was the best thing ever. As a kid I was afraid to go to porn sites because I was afraid of viruses so I went to the victoria's secret website a few months later and that was the best thing ever. I remember there was one picture in particular which had miranda kerr in a lace bra and you could just barely make out a nipple."

CelebrityFeet,3dzdpv,ChateauRomani,4,Mon Jul 20 19:37:50 2015 UTC,I am completely convinced that Dan Schneider intentionally adds feet scenes in his shows lol
CelebrityFeet,3dzdpv,PoliceWolf,2,Tue Jul 21 04:29:57 2015 UTC,"He does lol. His reason is that ""feet are funny"", but we know the truth ;)"

CelebrityFeet,3dr9pc,emlr3,2,Sun Jul 19 12:26:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's from that Sucker Punch movie, everything was hyper stylised."
