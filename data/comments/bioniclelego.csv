bioniclelego,3e4wv9,DapperDiglett,4,Wed Jul 22 01:15:48 2015 UTC,The maxilos mask looks closer than the hau
bioniclelego,3e4wv9,wiimanj13,3,Wed Jul 22 01:20:08 2015 UTC,Yea I don't see it.
bioniclelego,3e4wv9,swaglordP90X,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:11:09 2015 UTC,"IMO, that looks more like Duma's mask, with the 'mouth hole' and the cheeks."

bioniclelego,3e1nuu,Nightlock24,6,Tue Jul 21 07:14:19 2015 UTC,"Not gonna be in stores until August 1st in NA. Probs last week of July you might find the sets in certain stores, depending on what days they receove shipments and/or stock, but definitely by August 1st, mate!"
bioniclelego,3e1nuu,Shroompiano,0,Tue Jul 21 07:45:10 2015 UTC,Is there a reason for this? I remember with old bionicles I was able to get summer sets in my birthday which is July 8
bioniclelego,3e1nuu,Shroompiano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:12:06 2015 UTC,"I actually haveb't a clue. Might be their plan, might be unexpected manufacturing delays."

bioniclelego,3e1nuu,cyvaris,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:56 2015 UTC,From my experience toys-r-us get them fst usually and mine doesn't have them yet
bioniclelego,3e1nuu,Hubcaps217,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:41 2015 UTC,Some toysrus's sometimes had winter sets stocked at the end of novemember
bioniclelego,3e1nuu,ToaChronix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:41:27 2015 UTC,TRU stocks on Wednesday iirc. I'm checking mine tomorrow. Found the winter waves two weeks early so who knows.

bioniclelego,3dzjg6,ToaTupac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:25 2015 UTC,I love your style. Might take you up on that
bioniclelego,3e0juq,ptg76,3,Tue Jul 21 00:54:57 2015 UTC,"Even though it could still use some work, looking pretty good so far. I like that you added a bit of blue and teal to match the bike."
bioniclelego,3e0juq,TheDesuComplex_413,3,Tue Jul 21 01:43:20 2015 UTC,Funny story... the teal and blue on the character came before the bike... the bike was actually an afterthought
bioniclelego,3e0juq,swaglordP90X,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:49 2015 UTC,"Considering this is your first MOC, its pretty nice. I recall my first mocs being horrible and not nearly as well proportional as yours. Good Job! :D"
bioniclelego,3e0juq,swaglordP90X,3,Tue Jul 21 01:04:16 2015 UTC,Picture quality is god awful because of my phone... no fancy camera here -_-
bioniclelego,3dw9v5,swaglordP90X,5,Mon Jul 20 01:41:47 2015 UTC,There's nothing I don't like about this MOC. From the guns to the legs and feet to the centerpiece; everything looks great!  9/10 because no MOC is perfect ;)
bioniclelego,3dw9v5,stubs4limbs,2,Mon Jul 20 03:29:53 2015 UTC,Thanks lol :D
bioniclelego,3dw9v5,beermit,4,Mon Jul 20 04:16:03 2015 UTC,Damn that's good. Reminds me of the Enfield from Mechcommander.
bioniclelego,3dw9v5,silas34,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:12:14 2015 UTC,It does bear some resemblance o.o

bioniclelego,3dvu4e,Jeordeon,3,Sun Jul 19 23:53:33 2015 UTC,I found some time and did a rather messy sketch of mutated Karzanhi; enjoy!
bioniclelego,3dvu4e,zzxyyzx,3,Sun Jul 19 23:23:56 2015 UTC,your art style is really sick! love how you captured the small details like the ridges on the crotch-claw :P
bioniclelego,3dvu4e,VietRooster,2,Sun Jul 19 23:38:17 2015 UTC,Gotta love the crotch-claw! ;D
bioniclelego,3dvu4e,Samuntrus,3,Sun Jul 19 23:46:38 2015 UTC,Fucking. Awesome.
bioniclelego,3dvu4e,boompop4,3,Mon Jul 20 05:00:51 2015 UTC,Thanks man :D
bioniclelego,3dvu4e,Toa_Ignika,3,Mon Jul 20 05:29:02 2015 UTC,"Awesome stuff, very gritty. Reminds me of the comics"
bioniclelego,3dui0i,tootsie404,6,Sun Jul 19 16:33:13 2015 UTC,Reminds me of Knifehead from Pacific Rim. Very cool.
bioniclelego,3dui0i,InspectorJavert_,3,Sun Jul 19 17:11:59 2015 UTC,That movie really made me think of Bionicle when I first saw it
bioniclelego,3dui0i,Shoranos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:35:17 2015 UTC,Striker Eureka looks a lot like Roodaka imo.

bioniclelego,3dvh7l,HS_Rukodiora,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:24 2015 UTC,Previous universe lore can be found here.  Disclaimer: I have no idea how code is supposed to look.
bioniclelego,3dvvya,danethemichael,7,Sun Jul 19 23:37:59 2015 UTC,"I just read it and it's not bad. Not really gonna be deep story telling involved at first, it seems. I am happy about their names though. Very Bionicle sounding, if that makes sense."
bioniclelego,3dvvya,CovetedBody,6,Sun Jul 19 23:51:13 2015 UTC,...  I think maybe you should re-read Greg's work.
bioniclelego,3dvvya,DViddy,5,Mon Jul 20 06:55:12 2015 UTC,"This. Greg's writing back in the day was fine, but it is by no means 'mythic' or 'mature' in any significant way. It's very simple, to the point, and downright over the top at times. As much as I love those old books, they are just as clearly marketed and written for children as this is. All that is to say, I wouldn't worry about it so much! New Bionicle is sure to be as rich with lore and mysticism as old Bionicle, if this preview is any indication, it just won't be the MNOLG(which, let's be honest, is what we are all talking about when we talk about how deep and mature the tone of Old Bionicle was.)"
bioniclelego,3dvvya,thatdeductivefellow,4,Mon Jul 20 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"While I admit that it feels like he is writing down to his intended audience's level, that isn't a bad thing. I am happy that we have gotten all this info like the names and the alphabet."
bioniclelego,3dvvya,TheDesuComplex_413,6,Sun Jul 19 23:42:36 2015 UTC,"Farshtey always took care with making his characters feel like these mythical beings of importance.    HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHHAHAH!  OP, tell me another joke. Cause that one was great."
bioniclelego,3dvvya,CrashmanX,2,Mon Jul 20 05:07:55 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh not really. I kinda like it, TBH."
bioniclelego,3dvvya,Johnthedragon,4,Mon Jul 20 05:43:43 2015 UTC,"It is definitely a shame that the book made for the kids toy isn't Stephen King, yu'know?"
bioniclelego,3dvvya,jesusHERCULESchrist,0,Mon Jul 20 00:48:53 2015 UTC,There's a difference between Stephen King and natural sounding dialogue. You know you don't HAVE to defend everything with the name Bionicle slapped on it right?
bioniclelego,3dvvya,Timeline15,2,Mon Jul 20 09:12:08 2015 UTC,"I suppose it is a bit much of me to want, given the nature of the product. I don't think it's not so much that it's talking down to the reader, just that it's written very boringly. Like ""and he went over there and did that and that was that."" Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we're getting a book at all. I just wish we had a chance to breathe and take in this new world"
bioniclelego,3dvvya,SuperSweetSimsy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:56:38 2015 UTC,"I get exactly what you're saying. I think the biggest problem is that the writing feels less like a proper story and more like someone simply describing events. And while this is perfectly fine for the most part, the thing is, when you have such a blunt method of storytelling, it ends up making important events seem not in any way important. It's a problem that shows up numerous times throughout the previews I've read, and it really ends up killing the pacing of the book when it happens."
bioniclelego,3dvvya,Dufeyz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:34:43 2015 UTC,The new stuff will grow with their target audience. That's probably one of the reasons why bionicle was such a success in the first place.
bioniclelego,3dvvya,bryce304,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:34:49 2015 UTC,I'm just happy we're getting names now.
bioniclelego,3dvvya,Collin_C,0,Wed Jul 22 02:00:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I expected more of Ryder Windham's work, because I've read some of his Star Wars books and thought they were great. I don't think he knew of how big this fandom is, or any of the G1 lore. But I guess that's Lego's idea: make it fresh."
bioniclelego,3dusym,frothingnome,4,Sun Jul 19 18:07:15 2015 UTC,Lord of Skull Spiders is a godsend for technic parts and has plenty of black shells to supplement CCBS creations. Maybe pair with Tahu or Protector of Fire if you want some colors that work well with it.
bioniclelego,3dusym,AwesomeCowHat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:22:18 2015 UTC,"Depends what parts you want.  Any Toa right now is great for ball joints since they all (?) have 4 included for the shoulders.   All Protectors have like two of those ball joints with peg points on each side which are useful.  All Toa have those new armour pieces, the big ones - Kopaka and Tahu - have the most in white and gold respectively.  Skull Grinder vs Mask Maker has loads of goodies but is more expensive."
bioniclelego,3dusym,MysteryMoniker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks. They ended up having Tahu, Onua, and Pohatu, with Pohatu half off, so I got Tahu and Pohatu. I wish I could have afforded all three :-<"
bioniclelego,3dusym,JPS_TEAM_B_6905,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"well.. if you're in the states there's probably not gonna be too much choice at this time. last wave's probably mostly sold off, none of the stores I went to have had all 6 Toa; new sets bound to come in in a few weeks. the good thing is the sets may be discounted, got Gali for $7 and Onua for $10. Onua is a decent parts pack, contains useful technic bits and even 'old style' hands (the ones with 3 connection points) which seem to be increasingly rare in the new wave. LOSS is like 90% technic, so he's a decent parts pack as well."
bioniclelego,3dusym,JPS_TEAM_B_6905,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:18:52 2015 UTC,Thanks. I was hoping they'd still have a big set but they only had a few Toa left.
bioniclelego,3dusym,Johnthedragon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"Well.. we haven't gotten any 'big sets' yet this year, like G1's Titans. Mask Maker v. Skull Grinder is the first, and even that's technically just a large canister set + a medium canister set. so you haven't missed out on anything :)"
