answers,3e2qtd,jooronimo,16,Tue Jul 21 14:41:33 2015 UTC,%DV is a terrible statistic anyways. A 100 pound woman won't get the same %DV from a juice box that a 250 pound man will.  Protein can be especially fickle in this regard. Athletes are generally encouraged to consume at least their body weight in grams of protein daily. There are so many factors to consider that looking at %DV is fairly useless for everything but fats and sodium.

answers,3e43rq,moeburn,6,Tue Jul 21 20:21:30 2015 UTC,"On older cars,  fuel was mixed with air (a necessary process for internal combustion engines to run) in a device called a carburetor.      Carburetors meter the delivery of liquid fuel based on the assumption that the engine is running,  burning away the fuel continually as it is dispensed    On a car which has not been able to start due to a spark ignition problem (or some other factors),  the engine will not be pumping air through itself quickly enough to evacuate the unburned liquid fuel that keeps getting dispensed by the carburetor.    Unburned fuel builds up and the stoichiometry becomes too rich (too much fuel, too little oxygen) to combust.      The act of pushing the gas pedal down can accelerate this problem,  because this makes the carburetor dispense even more fuel.  This is why someone might caution that the driver be careful not to flood the engine.       Then you have to wait for the excess fuel to evaporate before the engine will run again.   In movies this is probably more a plot device than anything,   it did happen on regular cars but not continually,  not as an ordinary situation.   (This has nothing to do with manual transmissions)"

If it did not, then the rum contained too much water and was considered to be ""under proof"".[3] Gunpowder would not burn in rum that contained less than 57.15% ABV. Therefore, rum that contained this percentage of alcohol was defined to have ""100° (one hundred degrees) proof"".[4] The gunpowder test was officially replaced by a specific gravity test in 1816.[   From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_proof"

answers,3dx7wx,skeeterou,5,Tue Jul 21 05:48:41 2015 UTC,"If we assume the resolution is the same the main differences would be digital sensor technology and compression algorithms.  Digital sensors have come a long damn way since the early 2000's the dynamic range alone has gone from 4-5 stops to anything up to 15 or 16 giving a much more natural looking image. Also you can record at much higher bit rates and colour depths which eliminates a lot of random colour noise and things like banding. There are a ton of other improvements that would require an age to go over but the point is that the technology has advanced so much.  Also the way the raw footage is stored and compressed has changed, back in the early 2000's you'd have DivX, RealMedia, MPEG-1 (VCD) and MPEG-2 (DVD) and probably some more obscure codecs i don't know about. But the technology was still pretty new and poorly optimised, MPEG-2 is pretty decent but it's poor by today's standards.  There's now swathes of video codecs and compression algorithms that are really good, the tech has matured and so has the software to edit it as well. The rise of streaming video has no doubt caused the development of those technology to explode in the last 10 years.  TL;DR Yes the technology is ridiculously better now than in the early 2000's."
answers,3dx7wx,Morinaka,6,Mon Jul 20 12:57:14 2015 UTC,Sort of the second. It also gets compressed and stored. The compression does a quite a lot of damage. Add onto that transfering in an analog format which introduces noise too. It's all about data storage costs.

On the other hand, [ɹ] (as in 'Richard') and [d] (as in  Dick) are both somewhat similarly realized by the tounge fumbling around at the roof of the mouth. This means that there is less of a jump from Rick to Dick than from Carla to Marla."

answers,3dryk2,RedShiz,3,Sun Jul 19 12:24:28 2015 UTC,"We have a shared ownership system here in the UK, i live in one. This applies to my experiences, it might vary a bit depending on country and laws.   I presume that means you are only buying part ownership? Does that mean you only get to use it part of the year (like a timeshare)?   Usually a company or landlord of some sort will offer a deal where you purchase a 50% stake in the property, and you will still pay rent and maintenance but at a much reduced cost. You are also usually responsible for things going wrong in it, but your contract will outline what you are specifically responsible for and what they are. You live in it like any normal rented property, it isn't a time share thing.   Or wants to sell?   If you want to sell you go to the company and tell them you are selling, they will handle the sale and then give you 50% of the value back once sold. If you purchased at say 100k and the value of your stake increased to 110k you'll get 110k, assuming in this example you own the stake outright with no mortgage.   Could one owner subdivide their ownership even further?   Depends on your contract but i doubt it, the contract for this place doesn't even give you permission to sub-let it, though a few people have anyway.   This just seems really odd to me.   This is becoming increasingly popular in the UK because house prices are fucking insane, it's a decent way to get started on the property ladder if you can't get a huge mortgage. You get more freedom and rights than a full renter but less responsibility than a 100% home-owner."
answers,3dryk2,Morinaka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:31:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for the information!  You said:   If you want to sell you go to the company and tell them you are selling, they will handle the sale and then give you 50% of the value back once sold.   What happens if the property management company wants to sell? Do they come to you and say, ""Either pay the 50% it would sell for to obtain full ownership, or prepare to move out once it sells (you receiving half the proceeds, of course)?""  And if you want to sell it, who is the arbiter when negotiating with the buyer? What if you don't want to sell for less than $200,000, but the property management company is happy to sell at $190,000 (or whatever)? Or what if the buyer wants $5,000 back at closing due to an issue they'll need to address, which you agree to, but the property management company is only willing to give back $3,000?  This also seems like it would be a real boon for investors because they could buy, in theory, twice as many places, charge below market (which would ensure very limited vacancy), and still make money every month because their carrying costs were lower (since they are only paying for half a mortgage, if you will)."
answers,3dryk2,Morinaka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:10:01 2015 UTC,"All this varies from landlord to landlord and your contract, ours actually puts qualifiers on who can even buy shared ownership, first time buyers or key workers (police, nurses, etc.) are only allowed for our landlord.   And if you want to sell it, who is the arbiter when negotiating with the buyer?   I doubled checked how it works for us and i was a little wrong, it's a little more complex. When you want to sell you contact the landlord and tell them, they have a list of prospective clients and will allow them dibs on buying your property for what you want to sell it for. If none of them want it you contact an estate agent and sell it on the open market, but in our circumstance they still get final say on who can buy it, so i can't sell it to a non-first-time buyer unless they were a key worker, for example.   What happens if the property management company wants to sell? Do they come to you and say, ""Either pay the 50% it would sell for to obtain full ownership, or prepare to move out once it sells (you receiving half the proceeds, of course)?""   It's like getting a new landlord basically, nothing changes, you still live there the rent just goes to someone else. They can't sell your stake, you own that and not them. If they wanted to buy you out i guess they could but you still have the right to refuse. If you are that concerned about such a scenario then ask in advance and add a clause to the contract if it doesn't already exist.   This also seems like it would be a real boon for investors because they could buy, in theory, twice as many places, charge below market (which would ensure very limited vacancy), and still make money every month because their carrying costs were lower (since they are only paying for half a mortgage, if you will).   You talking about buying to rent? If your contract allows it i guess that might work but i would assume any sane landlord would ban sub-letting."

answers,3dmcuv,moichido1,4,Fri Jul 17 18:08:17 2015 UTC,"Traditionally, in German poetry, öh and eh were sometimes (often?) considered to rhyme. And the former is the actual sound in ""Koenig"", while the latter is essentially the sound that Americans seems to have replaced it with.  For example, in Die Lorelei by Heinrich Heine (emphasis mine):   Den Schiffer im kleinen Schiffe,  Ergreift es mit wildem Weh;  Er schaut nicht die Felsenriffe,  Er schaut nur hinauf in die Höh'.   And in Stille Nacht by Joseph Mohr (emphasis mine):   Stille Nacht! Heil'ge Nacht!  Die der Welt Heil gebracht,  Aus des Himmels goldenen Höhn,  Uns der Gnaden Fülle läßt sehn,    Given that, turning öh to eh, when you can't pronounce öh, doesn't seem too unreasonable."

Anyway, it will probably be easier for me to identify the word König if is pronounced Koohnig rather than Kaynig. The proximity to o (ö) makes it easier. Using ya, for me is more connected to a(ä)."

answers,3dhszm,Alesamesan,45,Thu Jul 16 11:35:26 2015 UTC,"Our moon does in fact have a name, it's called ""the Moon"". In the time before telescopes, the Moon was the only natural satellite of a planet humans could see with the naked eye, so our Moon was the only moon, and thus we didn't need to name it something special to differentiate it from other moons.  In 1610, though, Galileo discovered Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, the four largest moons of Jupiter. Once these were discovered, people realized that they had to give them different names from ""the Moon"" such that they don't get confused with one another. So, other moons started getting names, whereas the name ""the Moon"" just stuck with our moon, since it had been used for that purpose at this point for centuries.  The word ""moon"" was then, in 1665, extended in use to refer to natural satellites of other planets. And thus we ended up with ""the Moon"" and ""moon"".  Sources: 1, 2, 3"

answers,3dk5r1,xavur,5,Thu Jul 16 22:42:53 2015 UTC,"Multiple reasons:   A lot of the objects (like Mercury) have gravity that are constantly affecting the probe. To counteract gravity, most things will propel themselves sideways (like the International Space Station)*. When the fuel is gone, the probes are forced to crash. This is probably the answer to your question - there aren't enough resources to keep it in orbit. Sometimes crashing into an object will allow valuable data to be collected. For example, in 2009 NASA crashed its LCROSS probe into a crater on the Moon to see if there was water. Orbiting it wouldn't do much, they had to crash-land it to gather the data. They found the evidence, too! Close-ups of orbiting objects sometimes mandate crashing into it instead of orbiting it. The Deep Impact took very close images of the comet 'Tempel 1' a few seconds before it crashed into it. Sometimes it's just an accident. The space probe ""Venera 3"", launched by the Soviet Union back in 1965, was meant to land on Venus and collect data. Instead it crashed and stopped working.   *Gravity in low earth orbit is about the same as on the surface of the Earth. The ISS feels about 90% of the gravity we do; to counteract this it goes 8 kilometers per second. I have a bunch of references on how fast that is, but that's not part of the question."
answers,3dk5r1,wonderful72pike,2,Fri Jul 17 04:42:13 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing with point number 1 is that due to different densities of different regions of the planet, the gravity over different spots at the same altitude can be different, causing instabilities. The lower an object is orbiting, the more perterbations there will be and the faster it will destabilize. Atmospheric drag is a factor as well."

Then let it simmer down for a bit, and take out the sauce pan (or whatever you use to cook rice) from the heat and let it cool, make sure while cooking as it boils you keep mixing with a laddle, so that it doesnt burn or stick the bottom of the pan. And then when cooled (or still slightly warm), transfer contents to blender, and put 1 or 2 cups of water, or as required to make it into a liquid goop.  you can store it in your fridge or use it as it cools. it smells nasty, and i use my hands (with a latex glove) to apply it.  Alternatively, if this type of glue doesn't serve your purpose, then you can try Fugitive Glue - it's a type of adhesive.

This is equal to 211 arcmin, or 6.8 times larger than the moon appears from earth. Despite being almost 3 times smaller than earth's moon, it is about 20 times closer, and thus appears much larger.

This goes for the thickness on individual hairs If you have a patchy set of facial hair, you can't really cover up that fact by letting the hair grow out.

If you set limit(X->inf), limit(Y->inf), limit(Z->0) which is the same as limit(1/Z -> inf), then you can simplify everything by into:  V = limit(X->inf) A * X2 / X  (Setting x=y=z since they're all of the same dimensionality anyway. A is a proportionality constant.)  From this, you can see that V = limit(X->inf) A * X for this case, or V = limit(X->inf) A / X if two dimensions went to zero and one to infinity, or V = limit(X->inf) A * B if one dimension was held constant at B."

Interview directors emulate the popular techniques to imbue the interview with credibility. The second, more intrinsic, reason deals with the logistics of how the room can be set up. In order to simultaneously record both the interviewer/interviewee without getting a camera in the shot, you set up the cameras over the shoulder and record the two people at a slight angle. This way the camera is out of sight, unobtrusive, and facilitates a more naturalistic conversation between the two.   In reality-television interviews the convention is to have the interviewee look directly into the camera; while another common interview style is the panel--where two or more people sit facing the same direction with the chairs slightly angled toward each other, e.g. late night talk shows. The panel style is done in live settings to accommodate an audience but the angled style you're referring is probably done to imitate how people actually converse."

answers,3d6x65,VyrezParadox,6,Tue Jul 14 00:15:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know about paramedics, but for nurses a big one comes to mind.  Therapeutic communication.  As nurses we are taught extensively on how to talk with patients in a way that facilitates communication, expression of emotion, and expression of fears or concerns.  It is our job to ensure that our patients are informed and that they understand their treatments.  For example, with an informed consent paper you sign before surgery.  The doctor or surgeon must be the one to explain the surgery to the patient, the risks, the benefits, alternatives, ect.  They then have to be the ones to get the signature from the patient.  However, the nurse witnesses this whole process and signs the form as a witness.  It is their duty as a nurse to ensure that the patient understood the procedure and has no other concerns or questions.  If they all of a sudden voice a lack of understanding right before surgery, it is the nurses duty to halt the process and call the doctor to come clarify and answer questions for the patient.  Nurses deal with the emotional side of things much more than doctors.  Often doctors will give hard news and it is up to nurses to explain it or extrapolate.  This isn't true for all doctors and some are better than others, but in general, doctors are taught to fix the internal, not deal with the external.  Paramedics, in my opinion, can be much more like doctors than nurses.  It's like comparing apples to oranges to pairs, but apples and pairs have SOME things in common.  Paramedics and doctors don't need approval to do.  They just do.  They don't have to ensure that a doctor approves something after x amount of hours or that they have standing orders to be able to do something independently.  They can throw on oxygen, crank it up, pump in meds.  Not to the extent a doctor could, but paramedics and nurses have very few things in common from my viewpoint, outside of the hands-on skills they use everyday.  Source: am a nurse."

Frankfurt am Main is quite a bit larger than the other(s) and is somewhat relevant internationally so when speaking about Frankfurt without any addition to clarify which one someone is talking about it is most likely Frankfurt am Main.  (Same as when someone says New York you don't assume he is talking about the one in Florida or Iowa...)  The name was probably (google result told me so) first used for Frankfurt (am Main) and later used by settlers for other cities and villages.   When talking about Frankfurt it works the same as talking about any other common name - you assume that the other person is talking about whichever instance of the name you think is most relevant right now until proven otherwise."

When your phone sends a text message , it probably gets stored in a queue at the phone company for processing , where: It needs to find the right destination, whether the number exists, if it is a cell phone or landline, if the cell phone has texting enabled, and at what tower the cell phone physically is, etc.  In the scenario of one part of the network getting held up—such as if a server freezes or loses network connection—the messages would still be in the 'to-send' database; the network guy notices and restarts a service, the node reconnects to it's friends, and the old messages go out.   If you have a distributed database system where there is no master , you have to decide what to do when a network is split where both sides are receiving their own data.

answers,3d2ly6,Blumpkinsworth,7,Mon Jul 13 00:52:36 2015 UTC,"Time passes differently for your head compared to your feet, technically; a satellite in LEO will pass time differently than a ground based observer.   Time will pass differently in any two places moving relative to one another and/or experiencing a different amount of gravity from one another (unless these two things exactly cancel each other). There is no minimum difference in speed or gravity necessary for the effect to start, although obviously for small differences the difference in the passage of time is too small to worry about or even detect reliably. Satellites in LEO are passing through time at a different enough rate that atomic clocks can detect it."
answers,3d2ly6,Koooooj,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:07:09 2015 UTC,"It's all relative. Ever hear someone talk about Einstein's Theory of Relativity? That's exactly what this means.  An observer has a velocity, representing how fast they're moving through the universe. Pretty much, at higher velocity, time passes more slowly relative to a slower reference frame. The observer does not feel a difference, but it can be noticed by comparing different reference frames. It's important to note that these differences only become significant at incredible velocities, the type that humans are barely capable of achieving in devices like space probes.  A person standing still on Earth still has velocity (the Earth is moving), but much less than a satellite whirling around in orbit. Still, you can observe relativity in action in the daily adjustments that are made in GPS satellites to account for the time differences. If you got up to an even greater speed (like in the movie Interstellar) it would become even more apparent over time. Humans cannot reach the speed of light, but as that speed is approached time approaches total standstill."

For example, an eddy is formed by the water flowing past an area that causes the circular motion of the water or when opposing currents meet.  A drain or siphon is 'common' near rocky shores, and those are from porous rock where water can flow from one spot to another during the tides.  However, the real danger when swimming are rip currents. Look for thinish areas that are foamy. You'll also see foam being pulled back. These can occur just feet from the shore.  If you are ever caught in a rip current (if you find yourself mysteriously getting farther from the sore) swim parallel to the shore to escape it. Do not try to swim against it."

But most of the time he has kicked in some of his own money, and the bank+personal money is going to be used to purchase an asset.  The bank figures that worst case they can just repo the asset that the company bought. So the investors personal cash serves as a cushion to guarantee the bank's risk, therefore they don't require that personal guarantee.   It would still be required if the money were being used for activities other than purchasing an asset.  Like, if the loan was to cover operating costs (since you can't repo those).  But most of trumps deals are real estate so they can always just take the asset."
answers,3cy78j,Miliean,2,Sun Jul 12 04:11:22 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what kind of ""loan"" it is.    If it is a lease, i.e. then yes, a lender can always find that default of payment is a breach of the agreement and then move to repossess the leased item and then recover the due amount.    However, if it is a mortgage, i.e. lending cash for a security, then it is significantly more difficult since the number of hoops you have to jump through just explodes. This is because you will have to compare the strength of your legal interest with the other lenders and see who as better priority.  By the time you get to this stage, i.e. default of payment and the creditors are dividing up the assets, it will be quite costly, time consuming, and overall messy. There are probably lenders with higher interest that you anyways who probably will get a bigger piece of the disintegrating pie.  On the other hand, a personal guarantee is usually ""on demand"". A bank won't want to go through the entire procedure of winding up a company and not recovering its assets when it knows there are probably other lenders with better interests, when it can just serve notice on the guarantor to pay up.  Of course there is the issue of how many personal guarantees the borrower has...  Winding up a company is much more difficult and costly than declaring someone bankrupt.  In fact bankruptcy is probably a better tool since it personally affects the borrower (from the perspective of the lender).   This applies to maybe 99% of all borrowers.  I am pretty sure even Elon Musk has to go through hoops the bank or lenders provide because the lenders have to be prudent.  ""I was loaning to Elon Musk"" is not a sufficient explanation to the bank shareholders.   I know first hand many listed companies with significant assets still had their directors personally guarantee loans taken out by the company for the reasons above."

answers,3cy78j,oceanfr0g,82,Sun Jul 12 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing.  Filling for bankruptcy is not necessarily a bad financial decision.  So lets say trump wants to build a new building.  It's going to be 100 condos and will cost $100 million to build.  Each condo is going to sell for $1.1 million (or, that's the plan).   Now, to build this new building they create a new corporation fully owned by Trump inc. Trump inc dumps $10 million into this new company.  The new company, with $10 million, approaches a bank asking to finance the remaining $90 to build the building.  The bank evaluates the businesses plan and approves the loan.   Now, sure, the company will have to pay interest on the loan, but that's small potatoes in the grand scheme of things.   The building gets built, at a cost of $100 million, but the market conditions change while it's being constructed.  $1.1 million dollar condos are no longer selling, so the price must be reduced.    If the price falls below $1 million, then you won't make a profit.  Between $1 million and $900,000 you are eating away at your initial investment money.  So you won't even break even.  If the price falls below $900,000 then you won't even make enough money to repay the bank.  Declaring bankruptcy is simply giving up on the whole deal.  You walk away from the loan and the bank takes the building.  But because of the creditor protection that doing it through a corporation creates, the bank can only repossess the building.   All of this is not at all an indication of the financial health of the corporation owners.  The deal simply became unprofitable and was abandoned. The owners still have buckets of money they are just not interested in losing more of it."

It's a photo-driven social site to share shopping, planning, and decorating ideas and make related lists, which largely appeals to women.  But while the concept itself appeals to and caters to women, it's not so much that it caters to women, it's that women are the primary users and that drives the direction and output as a result.   Companies create additional content to appeal to these users as a result and Pinterest heavily drives content to women's sites, which further establishes it as a site that ""caters"" to women.    The findings from this study also prove that the importance of audience targeting can’t be overstated. Marketers hoping to reach female consumers should be on Pinterest, sharing visually striking images of products, projects and ideas. At the same time, an investment in this channel may not prove as fruitful for a brand targeting older men. -Source"

They'd take in the sails and reduce their speed when they came in final view of land and would make course corrections based on visual information when in view of the shoreline. This is why it was important to have an experienced navigator because someone who has seen the same rocky stretch of coastline often enough can tell you which direction the ship needs to go to hit the intended port vs someone who is laying eyes on it the first time."

Until the invention of chronometers it was difficult to impossible to determine how far east or west you were (longitude). Many times the ship would just sail to the same latitude as the port they were sailing to and then sail east or west until they ran into it.

answers,3cv77g,Matti_Matti_Matti,8,Sat Jul 11 06:33:06 2015 UTC,"I don't have an answer for this specific issue, Plato / Platon. But in general, this kind of thing happens for a couple of reasons.  One is that it used to be very common for proper names to be ""translated"" when used in other languages, which is why Americans refer to Christopher Columbus, but he was born in Italy with the name Cristoforo Colombo, and used Cristóbal Colón in Spain and Cristóvão Colombo in Portugal. Sometimes this is to make it easier for locals to pronounce a name (Chinese-speakers still commonly choose an ""English name"", distinct from their given name, for this reason), and sometimes it's because someone's namesake (usually a Christian saint) is known by different names in different countries / languages.  That probably isn't the reason with Plato, but consider also that strictly standardised spelling, even of proper names, is a relatively recent concept: William Shakespeare is known to have spelled his name in various very different ways. People didn't used to think it was all that important to get someone's name down on paper exactly right, so long as it was fairly clear who was being referred to. So it may be that some scribe made a mistake or a judgement call in translating Πλάτων into the Latin alphabet as ""Plato"", and that name happened to stick in English-speaking territories, while some other versions wrote it as ""Platon"" and that became popular elsewhere.  This is all speculation, but it's the best I've got."

The name ring continued with the Jack Broughton rules in 1743, which specified a small circle in the centre of the fight area where the boxers met at the start of each round. The first square ring was introduced by the Pugilistic Society in 1838. That ring was specified as 24 feet (7.3 m) square and bound by two ropes. For these and other reasons, the boxing ring is commonly referred to as the ""square circle""."

In the case of Ultimate Frisbee, a quick google search for ""professional ultimate frisbee"" brought up MLultimate.com and  the AUDL which appears to be an American Semi-Pro league.

answers,3cpo0j,Hanimal_StrangeQuark,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:11:58 2015 UTC,"The amount they quoted you is the ""cash pay"" price. Here's how insurance companies work:  They have contractual rates.   The medical office (surgery center in your case) go to the insurance company and want to work out a contract to be in-network. The insurance company agrees and the medical facility/entity will give the insurance company a ""super bill"" of what they charge for each service. The insurance company will then give the medical office their contractual amount for each procedure code (HCPCS codes are how services are billed).   So let's do scenarios for both cash pay and insurance price:  Surgery center bills your insurance company $800 for said procedure. Let's say your insurance company's contractual rate for this procedure is $500 (62.5%). The remaining $300 is written off by the surgery center. Assuming your insurance company is a typical 80/20, your co-insurance (not the same as your co-pay) is 20% of that $500, so $100. The insurance company pays the remaining $400 to the surgery center.   Now, let's say the cash pay price and the price billed to the insurance company were both $300. Assuming we deduct the same 62.5% as above in keeping with consistency, the contractual rate would be $187.50, your responsibility would be $37.50 (20% of the contractual rate) so the insurance company would be paying the medical facility $150 for the services they performed.   So you can see why the prices are different.   Source: 5+ years working in the insurance industry."

Is it just something related to how facilities would be guaranteed a certain amount of income for each procedure and the remaining cost is higher for the individual? In essence, insurance companies are winning out? What's the goal behind super billing?"
answers,3cpo0j,somnodoc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"The insurance industry is very confusing. Insurance companies are all for-profit corporations. This is why people have premiums (the monthly amount you pay to have insurance), deductible (the amount you have to meet before insurance will even pay their percentage), co-insurance (the percent you're responsible for after the insurance company has paid their portion), co-pay (the upfront cost you pay to the doctors office at time of service which does NOT go towards your deductible) and your out-of-pocket (services not covered under your insurance plan). The medical facilities make their money from the contractual amount the insurance company has agreed to pay and the co-insurance you pay.   Let's break down the cost of having insurance:   Premium: depending on your insurance and if your employer partially pays for the premium, it can range anywhere from $10 per paycheck to $200+ depending on if you have an individual or family plan. This does not count towards your deductible.   Deductible: $500- this is the amount of money you have to reach before insurance pays their %. You have to pay in full for all services rendered until $500 is met.   Co-pay: $25-$30 for a well-visit; $30-$50 for a specialist. This does not count towards your deductible of out-of-pocket. Depending on the type of plan you have, there are also additional co-pays for imaging and labs services. Most commercial insurance will charge $100 co-pay which is due at time of service to visit an emergency room and charge separate for an ambulance ride if necessary.   Co-insurance: typically 20%, some insurance companies have really great plans where they'll pay 100% after the deductible is met (that usually means a high deductible in the $2,000+ range). Some pay 90% but I've seen as low as paying 60%.   Typically if imaging or labs are needed its referred out to an external company (Radia for x-rays for example or LabCorp for blood draws) and that external company bills separately than your doctor since they're two different entities. So you may get a bill from Radia for your x-rays and then get a bill from your doctor's office. Hospitals work this way as well.   My point in highlighting the highway robbery that is the commercial insurance industry is that your doctor's office is going to charge you $300 for an $800 service simply to cut you a deal and skip the insurance hassle. And depending on the facility, you may be able to set up a payment plan."

answers,3cllvd,dagutter,9,Wed Jul 8 21:26:47 2015 UTC,"They don't really have different languages. The concept you're looking for is called a dialect continuum.  In each village, the locals speak a dialect that is almost identical to the next village over, but with a few minor changes. They can understand each other perfectly well.  If you take two villages separated by a great distance though, they can't understand each other at all, even if they both call their language by the same name.  And since languages started to standardize, it gets even weirder. One dialect ends up becoming the standard version of German, for instance, and another dialect is labelled the standard version of Dutch. National borders are drawn, so that on this side of the line the locals speak Dutch, and on that side a form of low German. To the locals, though, they essentially speak the same language as the folks just across the border. A German speaker from the NW of the country is going to have a much easier time understanding a Dutch speaker from just across the border than (s)he will trying to understand another German speaker from far away, such as Vienna.  You don't get this effect as strongly in English as you do in German or Italian, but you can still observe dialects shading imperceptibly into each other all the way from Estuary English in the south into the Scots language in Scotland (not Gaelic, which is in a separate group entirely).   This effect is a lot less severe than it used to be, as the standardization  process has advanced a lot over the years, but it used to be possible to go all the way from Portugal to Sicily without any sharp breaks, with the local language changing imperceptibly from Portuguese to Castillan Spanish to Catalan to Provençal to Occitan to Piedmontese, etc.   There weren't any sharp discontinuities like you'd find going from, say, French to German."

answers,3ckifz,bertbarndoor,2,Wed Jul 8 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"How exactly did she inflate the gas sales? Did she inflate the price per litre or did she inflate the number of litres? That might be relevant. I'm guessing it was the price per litre.  I can't quite put it all together without knowing more about Canadian or Quebec tax law. I can only guess that it works like this: tax on gasoline is paid per litre and therefore gasoline is not subject to ordinary sales tax. The tax on gasoline doesn't increase or decrease if the merchant raises or lowers the price. Everything else is subject to sales tax, that is, a fixed percentage of the sales price.  Now I would think, if the business were audited for tax purposes, the merchant would have to show receipts to prove that he was selling about the same amount of gasoline retail that he had bought wholesale, and the same would be true for beer. However, firewood might be something he could fudge with. He might have a local supplier of firewood whom he pays in cash; maybe the entire firewood business is ""off the books.""  So if the merchant wants to avoid collecting and paying sales tax on the firewood, he could disguise the sale as a gasoline sale. It would be riskier to do that with beer, because an auditor could look at how much beer the merchant had bought wholesale, and ask, ""Where is all the beer going?""  I suppose a merchant is allowed to raise and lower the price of gasoline as often as he wants; still, I would think it would raise red flags if an auditor noticed that the price of gasoline had gone up and down several times in a single day. The merchant is playing a dangerous game, and the clerk made it more dangerous by partly explaining it."
answers,3ckifz,JimDixon,2,Thu Jul 9 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"She inflated the gas sales by making it ALL gas sales, when there was no gas purchased at all. My bro in law bought beer and firewood. His receipt was for something like 60 litres of gas, which came out to the same price as the beer and wood he actually purchased. I can't put it together either??   One thing that may provide another clue, is that the gas tax paid in Quebec is something like 8 cents higher per litre than Ontario, which is only about 40 minutes from the border. I was wondering if perhaps they were purchasing gas from Ontario, paying Ontario tax, selling it in Quebec, collecting Quebec tax, and pocketing the difference. ???"
answers,3ckifz,JimDixon,2,Thu Jul 9 17:40:30 2015 UTC,"Still an auditor would look for receipts. The merchant would have to make up a fraudulent receipt falsely showing that he had bought the gas in Quebec and paid Quebec taxes. Then that wouldn't match up with the wholesaler's records, or with the check he wrote to pay for the gas. But if he had that fraudulent receipt, and the auditor believed it, there would be no reason to monkey around with the receipts given to customers.  I suspect the clerk didn't fully understand the scheme herself.  That's the trouble with being a crook: how do you explain it to your employees? If you tell them everything, you practically have to make them a partner, otherwise they'll rat you out. If you tell them only part of what you're doing--that is, if you tell them WHAT to do without explaining WHY--and hope they won't figure out that the scheme is illegal--then there is a risk they'll misunderstand and do it wrong, or else they'll inadvertently give the game away to an outsider.  I could maybe figure out a different scheme, but it would all be speculation. I'm pretty sure it's something crooked though."

answers,3cjkod,ateaktree,2,Thu Jul 9 19:06:32 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the response. :) I was looking for something like that page you linked to but couldn't find a good one.  Do you know if it's possible to use drift tubes in an electrostatic accelerator like a Van DeGraaff type?  Can you have a combo like an electrostatic/linear accelerator?
answers,3cjkod,ateaktree,2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"The main issue with this is that drift-tube linacs operate on AC so you don't have one continuous beam, but rather a number of bunches that are timed to see an accelerating field. The Van de Graaff is DC and thus normally uses a continuous beam.   Both accelerators work in almost the the same energy regime. Which one you use is determined more by your intended applications. Though neither one of these designs is really used in new accelerators. The Van de Graaff principle is limited by voltage breakdown and can't be pushed much beyond 10 MV. The DTL requires excessively long drift sections to go to higher energies. Normally RF cavities are used now, instead, or at very low energies radio-frequency quadrupoles are becoming popular for ion accelerators."
answers,3cjkod,ateaktree,2,Thu Jul 9 23:34:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the response. You are good at explaining things!  I have a really weird question... I don't know if this is possible at all,  but maybe you have heard of it if it exists. Have you ever heard of a particle accelerator operating using acoustic waves amplified to accelerate particles?  Also, if you increase the size of the electrostatic accelerator to immense proportions does that increase it's ability to accelerate particles much? Or is there a limit to that?"
answers,3cjkod,ateaktree,2,Fri Jul 10 06:47:31 2015 UTC,"Its an interesting question. Unfortunately, I think the answer is that its just not practical in any way to use acoustic waves for acceleration. One issue is getting sufficient power, the largest man-made acoustic power source I could find in a quick search is a Saturn V rocket at 100 MW. Which obviously isn't practical. Another major issue even if you could get sufficient power is that the particles would be accelerated essentially through collision with whatever your acoustic medium is. An standard for a particle accelerator is that the acceleration be as uniform for all particles as possible. Not only do you want them to all have the same energy but they must all be accelerated in exactly the same direction, down to very small tolerances. A collision based acceleration scheme would not be able to achieve this.  As far as increasing the size of an electrostatic accelerator, this will probably have no effect. To get better acceleration you need higher electric fields. This means putting more and more charge on the terminal. Eventually the potential difference between the terminal and its surroundings will be too great and it will spark. That is there will be a discharge from the terminal onto some other part of the accelerator. At these extremely high voltages this can lead to damage of the equipment. Some sparking is inevitable, I've worked on Van de Graaff accelerators and it happens occasionally, its rather impressive too. You will hear a very loud boom even when you are several rooms over from the accelerator. However, the higher the voltage the more likely this is to occur and the worse the damage can possibly be."

So a white surface is just a plane that allows reflection of those spectrums comprised within, so yes you could split that light into it's contained colour frequencies with a prism.   With a coloured surface to combine to make it white you'd have to focused those coloured frequencies of light into one space where that light would overlap (and I guess evenly) to combine to white light."

Some glasses can diffract light and you fan see rainbows in places you normally wouldn't. The guy below explains it"
answers,3ch5dp,poiro,2,Wed Jul 8 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure what you're asking but i'll try and answer.   Can you look at a white surface through a lens and see a rainbow?   Technically, yes. In practice, i'd take a lot of messing around and focusing of lenses and prisms and if you moved your eye, the effect would be ruined. What could be done is this: you can take the light that is bouncing off a white surface (e.g. a wall.) and apply a prism (or just a really big lens) that refracts the colors. By adjusting the distances between the prism and the wall and your eye, you could in theory get a rainbow that spans exactly the width of your pupil. But from what i know about how the eye works, I'm not sure whether you'd see the rainbow or just see a single color.   You definitely wouldn't be able to see a rainbow colored wall however as the refraction of light breaks down the image of the wall.  To give you an idea of what i mean, think of the last time you used a magnifying glass. You had to hold it a certain distance from the surface for it to work right? What happened if you kept moving it away from the surface? the image distorted and stretched and eventually flipped over. The same process would go on in our wall experiment but we would be stretching the image to the point of breaking down the colors of each different part of the image.   Or, what would be more amazing, can you take a rainbow colored surface and recompose it to look white?   This one's a little iffy but the short answer is as follows.  ""you can definitely make a surface LOOK white but it won't actually be white.""  What I mean by that is that to get the human eye to think that the object is white, you need to resort to tricking it.   Because opaque surfaces don't emit light, a non white surface will only be able to reflect non white light and there's no way to 'synthesize' other light to make it appear white again whilst still retaining the image.  I know of two ways to trick the eye into seeing white light.  1) Exposure: If you're standing in a slightly red room, over time the eye tends to compensate for the red and adjusts the colors you see. This same function is the phenomena responsible for This Illusion  2) Context: As with the above method, it takes advantage of your eye's tendency to compensate. If you place a slightly blue object in a mostly red room, the object will appear to be white.   Source: Occasional lighting designer for Theater. The eye tricks I talked about are a part of a fundamental aspect of lighting design called 'saturation.'"

So after 9.92 days, Jupiter has completed one turn on its axis (one Jupiter-day). In 11.86 earth-years (one jupiter-year) you'll see 11.86*365 = 4328.9 earth-days, and 4328.9/9.92 = 436.38 jupiter-days.  Conversion table time!  1 Earth-day = 1/365 Earth-years = 1/9.92 Jupiter-days = 1/4328.9 Jupiter-years  1 Earth-year = 365 Earth-days = 36.79 Jupiter-days = 1/11.86 Jupiter-years  1 Jupiter-day = 9.92 Earth-days = 1/36.79 Earth-years = 1/436.38 Jupiter-years  1 Jupiter-year = 4328.9 Earth-days = 11.86 Earth-years = 436.38 Jupiter-days  and if you take those 4328.9 Earth-days and multiply by 24 hours... 1 Jupiter-year = 103893.6 hours   Except this has all been based on there being exactly 365 earth-days in an earth-year, as opposed to the real figure of 365.25ish... give or take that li'l bit that means we need complicated rules about leap days occurring in every year that's divisible by 4, unless it's also divisible by 100, unless it's also divisible by 400.

The full conversion is 1 JY * (11.86 EY/1 JY) * (365.24 ED/1 EY) * (24 hr/ED). All of the units cancel except for hours, so the answer is 11.86*365.24*24, whatever that works out to (I'm on mobile)."

It didn't quite hit me until I played a Final Fantasy game in which the characters looked western to me until I saw them in a pre-rendered cutscene, where they had much higher fidelity and the characters looked more realistic, and suddenly more Japanese.

Anyway, the specific statement I made was really about dialect variation and not specifically accents, and a lot of that has vanished in English due to fairly early standardization in various countries. There's certainly still a lot, but it doesn't reach what you'd find in, say German or Italian, which both contain a lot of dialects that are so different they are not even mutually intelligible. There are a lot of Germans, for instance, who find it easier to understand Dutch than they do people on the other side of their own country, who are theoretically speaking the same language.  Dialect continua are neat :)"

I tried biking and enjoy it but found it hard to keep a good pace due to paying attention to traffic. Also the lights killed it for me. If you find a good trail that would solve it.   I run on pavement and as /u/foldero1 mentioned it can hurt your knees if done wrong. There is a technique and form that of ignored will cause more harm than good. Also good shoes make a huge difference. A buddy would complain about his ankles cause he was using some cheap Walmart shoes. I went with him to the store and got him some wide angle shoes and it made a world of difference.

It's difficult to grab a bike ride when you are traveling (you have to rent or bring a bicycle). As a runner, you just throw on shorts and grab a run anywhere.

answers,3cddxa,st_michael,2,Tue Jul 7 13:06:13 2015 UTC,"Cycling and running are both largely cardio exercises, they won't build much muscle at all. Running will build a little muscle throughout your legs and core; cycling will build up basically just your quads but still maybe as much in total as running.   Cycling is less likely cause an injury but more likely to cause an accident (either falling off or being hit by another vehicle), and is easier to do for long periods of time.  Running is probably cheaper (just need shoes), will burn more calories per minute, but you're quite likely to get a minor injury (shin splints, twisted ankles, etc.) though less likely to be hit by a car or fall down.  Personally, I'd recommend that if you have a short amount of time per day, do running (more effective per unit time); if you're seriously increasing your amount of exercise, stick to cycling (less likely to get an injury that forces you to stop)."

That's why bikes were such an amazing innovation: efficient, cheap, mass transit. Think how far you can go on a bike vs the same period for the same effort on foot. Think how tired you are after 5 minutes of all out sprint - most people are about ready to throw up. It's damn near impossible to have the set up and discipline to do that on a bike.  Personally, unless you love cycling machines or live near fantastic trails, I find it damn near impossible to get a really serious workout in on a bike - then again I live in a big city. That being said, I enjoy biking over running 9 times out of 10 - it's low impact, it's less painful, it's more fun to feel the wind, see the sites etc.  As others have said, find what's enjoyable for you and do that more.

You are correct that as a rule of thumb, Navy showers are required to be short for the purpose of saving resources.  Normally, the distilling units (DUs), which make fresh water for both use as potable water and for cleaning/bathing as well as steam for the catapults and water for the main steam system, gave us enough reserve so that we could take showers that would probably be considered adequate by civilians, too.  However, if one of the DU's went down, or there was some other sort of engineering casualty (for example, salt water contamination of one or more of the supplies), we'd have to go on ""water hours"", when our shower time and laundry, etc. was rationed.  It was aggravating, but when I was in, it was luckily never for any extended period.    I understand that there are a few ships, e.g. the George Bush, where they had some real capacity issues (and also some issues with the sanitation systems), and the lack of enough fresh water made life on the ship almost unlivable for a considerable period of time.

It's how dynos measure RPM, by clipping onto the plug wires.  Edit: or through a crank position sensor. It tells the computer how many times the crank has made a revolution and it can calculate the RPMs from that."
answers,3cdx2o,goodbyekitty83,2,Tue Jul 7 13:54:04 2015 UTC,"Modern cars all have something called an engine control module. It's a little computer with a bunch of sensor attached to the engine. It uses the information from these sensors to maximize engine power, maximize efficiency, and minimize pollution.  One of these sensors is the crankshaft position sensor. It allows the ECM to determine the orientation of the crankshaft. The sensor is typically placed near the flywheel or crank pulley of the engine. The flywheel or crank pulley of the engine will have little teeth about its circumference. As the engine rotates, the teeth will pass by the crank sensor. Every time one of these teeth passes the crank sensor, it will send an electrical pulse to the ECM. The ECM records the length of time that passes between each pulse.  Using the total number of teeth and the amount of time between two teeth crossing the sensor, the ECM can calculate the engine speed. The ECU then takes this value and sends it to the car's tachometer.  For example: We measure 1ms between each tooth, and there are 50 teeth on the pulley. This means we have 0.001s/tooth and 50 teeth/revolution. So if we take 0.001s/tooth * 50 teeth/rev we get 1 second/20 revs. If we multiply this number by 60 (for 60 seconds in one minute) we get 1200 rpm.    Old cars did not have computers or sensors. Everything was mechanical. The tachometer was usually connected directly to the low side of the ignition coil. Every pulse on the ignition system would cause the tachometer needle to deflect a tiny bit. The faster the engine turns, the more pulses are sent. More pulses cause the needle to deflect farther. So the faster the engine turns, the higher the tachometer reads."

answers,3c8war,random123456789,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense. First ""21,000 orbital debris larger than 10 cm are known to exist"". There are 1,100 active satellites, and 2,600 inactive. The ISS or any active satellite that is able to would avoid collisions beyond visual range. The ISS is alerted for possible debris that will go by several miles from it.Then there is the fact that even if it is something that is orbiting around the same altitude, of which many are not, that doesn't mean they know everything that is on a classified satellite. A weapon from space doesn't need to be nuclear, it can literally be a big hunk of metal. So its not like you would be looking for some radiation signature on the thing.   Here is a list of classified observation satellites launched by the US: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NRO_Launches  A report by the US Air Force demonstrated a 20 ft Tungsten rod would have the equivalent impact of 11.5 tons of TNT. The X-37B could carry a payload a little less then half that size. And is a classified craft.  Lastly, the Outer Space Treaty you mentioned prohibits WMD, not conventional weapons. There have been various ASAT weapons  developed as well as tests of weapons without warheads. The Salyut 3 for example had a small cannon on it.  While it seems unlikely there are currently weapons in space. There have been. And the US, Russia and China all have the capability and likely an ability to weaponize space in a very short period of time."

answers,3c8war,SolomonKull,2,Mon Jul 6 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"No, you can't. Even if the event was detected. The two projectiles come at each other at mind-boggling speeds. The only possible defense can be if the defending missile detonates in the path of the incoming projectile, blowing it off course. Even when the element of surprise is not involved, the kill probability is very small, around 15%. Now imagine that the enemy launches a surprise attack, a first strike. Usually directed at command and control, and political leadership. The target is in chaos, trying to figure out who hit them and trying to retaliate. If Russia launches ICBMs, most all of the US sensors are focused on them. It would be predictable. However, the problem arises when such strike is carried from a satellite already in orbit. Or from an untracked submarine at sea. For this reason, the US has its command post under a fucking mountain. There is also The Looking Glass, a command and control in the air continuously. The Russians have the Dead Man system, which is a bunch of sensors, and in theory, they are supposed to launch their nuclear weapons every day unless they get a message not to. If the message does not come one day, the missiles are all launched in retaliation. In a nutshell."
answers,3c8war,VisualBasic,5,Mon Jul 6 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-minute_warning   The four-minute warning was a public alert system conceived by the British Government during the Cold War and operated between 1953 and 1992. The name derived from the approximate length of time from the point at which a Soviet nuclear missile attack against the United Kingdom could be confirmed and the impact of those missiles on their targets. The population was to be notified by means of air raid sirens, television and radio, and urged to seek cover immediately. In practice, the warning would have been more likely three minutes or less."

answers,3c8war,3jp,2,Tue Jul 7 05:30:43 2015 UTC,"If you're thinking in early Cold War terms of the US-USSR duking it out with traditional silo-based ICBMs then the US would likely have somewhere between 15-20 minutes using some of their more primitive early warning systems that were in place in Canada and Alaska, looking for ICBMs coming over the arctic circle. But it's also useful to remember that these sort of out-of-the blue attacks would be rare. The US would have had even more advance warning of the Soviets readying their missiles in preparation of a massive launch, which would in turn cause the US to put their own missiles on high alert. Nowadays, the US and Russia would have greater time since both countries have even more advanced early warning systems: e.g. the US now has stations in Eastern Europe (which has upset the Russians) and the Russians are just now launching a new system as well. However, these systems wouldn't work against SLBMS (submarine launched ballistic missiles) which could be launched just off the coastline, and cruise missiles that fly low to the ground which are difficult to detect. And finally, the US could also use stealth bombers to drop nuclear payloads without any forewarning at all, if they were able to enter foreign airspace undetected.   Also, this is one of the reasons that the Cuban Missile Crisis was so important to the US: by stationing nuclear weapons in Cuba, the Soviets were drastically minimizing the amount of time that the US would have to recognize and react to the strike. Though most people don't realize that the US did virtually the same thing to the Soviets when they placed missiles in Turkey in 1961."

I googled this to make sure I'm not telling you the wrong thing and I'm trusting that wikipedia is going to be pretty accurate about French language laws. The Académie française only makes recommendations; they don't have the power to enforce compliance. The Académie publishes the dictionary so they're the ones who decide the official French word for newer terms like email (courriel in French). My impression is that they mainly use guilt and nagging to pressure French people into compliance and it's probably not very effective.  The Toubon Law does mandate compliance...  in official government publications, in all advertisements, in all workplaces, in commercial contracts, in some other commercial communication contexts, in all government-financed schools, and some other contexts.   Presumably this is something that could be enforced by the government with fines or mandates or something.  I don't know if this law is still on the books, but when I studied abroad in 2004, there was a law that radio stations had to play a certain percentage of songs that had French lyrics.

The amount of caffeine used in this context is typically rather low. According to Google for example a 16oz coke contains 28mg. Drip coffee (especially premium coffee) contains several times this amount. Fountain formulations are designed to have little variation from their packaged products. When they do these are typically regional differences rather than differences from the same bottler (which supply all formulations in a given area)."

When emissions controls and unleaded fuel came into effect and dropped compression ratios down to as low as 8:1 to cope with low octane fuel, this was an issue.   Basically, the lower the octane, the more volatile it is. If you're running too low octane fuel, it will detonate before the spark plug fires, which will damage your engine.  99.95% of N/A cars will run just fine on 87 MON fuel.

That lead had lubricating properties, and some engine designers were smart enough to take that into account. Unleaded fuel doesn't have those additives, so they can potentially wear the engine faster."

answers,3bzqhc,SovietSteve,2,Fri Jul 3 16:11:21 2015 UTC,"I'd add to that, though, that you should speak to people with experience of your particular car.  For many years, I owned a 1977 Triumph Spitfire (which was over 20 years old when I bought it, and over 30 years old when I sold it).  On those, it was known that you could replace the cylinder head for a new one with hardened valve seats, and that would enable you to run it on unleaded.  But it was also known that if you didn't replace the head, the only thing that was being damaged was the valve seats. So there was absolutely no harm in leaving it to see what happens - worst case is you need to replace the part you were planning on replacing anyway.  It was also known that if you bought the car with its original head, and the original owner had used leaded fuel (which would have been normal in those days), the use of leaded fuel had quite likely hardened the valve seats enough that they could now be run on unleaded fuel indefinitely.  Knowing that, of all the Spitfire owners I know, none of them have done anything specific to enable them to run on unleaded.  Of course, this is specific to this type of car, and the advice doesn't apply to all older cars. Hence why I started by saying: speak to people with experience of your specific car."

It will run fine on anything higher that that, but you're wasting your money because in a low-compression engine you won't get any extra benefit.  As others have pointed out, the higher the octane, the ""smoother"" the gasoline ignites. A high octane rating means the fuel will burn very fast and smooth even in high-compression, high-performance engines. In an engine like that, low octane fuel explodes rather than burning, so it will destroy the engine. An old crappy Soviet engine is designed to run on old crappy Soviet fuel."

The person being pulled out of a burning building isn't charged a fee for having their life saved.  People are charged for expensive medical procedures, but there's (rightfully) a lot of complaint about that.  The only place where this money could come from would be either from the government, but then you'd have to pay higher taxes, or from some sort of private charity that gives ""life saving rewards"" to people, and I'm not aware of any of those.  On the other hand, professional sports players generate a lot of money.  People pay a lot of money to attend games, to buy merchandise, to buy ads during televised games, etc.  Money doesn't spring out of nowhere like in video games as just recompense for doing some deed.  It has to come from somewhere, and the general public would rather buy a branded t-shirt than pay taxes to support their local police or fire departments."

IE, it will take a lot of time and effort to do something you already can do (write). So it depends on what you are training your brain for exactly.    However there are benefits to training your brain in such a way but you might get better results from say learning a new language or meditating and therefore get secondary effects thats are beneficial on top of the new skill.

answers,3bw5ug,hoffmania1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:48:10 2015 UTC,Alot of newly built schools have class room doors with metal frames and locks. They also even have safety glass windows that have wiring inside the glass to keep it from breaking.   New schools also separate corridors with metal caging that comes down electronically similar to stores at a mall.   Newly built schools are extremely safe and they now prepare for events like this during the construction phase.   With these things in mind the lockdown protocol is an extremely effective method for keeping your children safe. It effectively isolates the shooter from the students. This prevents the shooter from being able to cause any harm.

answers,3br6ei,willstan55,3,Wed Jul 1 14:16:11 2015 UTC,"There are a number of reasons and arguments for protecting the freedoms of expression found in the First Amendment. Here are my favorites:   Governments are not to be trusted. If the government can prohibit certain opinions by law, then the laws will tend to protect the status quo, and those who benefit from it, from being scrutinized. Often, important reforms come about only through the agitation of malcontents who used graphic, offensive, or otherwise objectionable arguments to get their point across.  Censorship distorts public perception and undermines democratic decision-making. When certain topics are off-limits then whatever insights those topics might offer will be lost. It's important to allow the neo-Nazi's to march if only so we won't forget what a Nazi looks like and stands for. It's important to allow WBC to condemn homosexuals so we won't flatter ourselves into thinking that we've solved the problem of intolerance.  Fairness and equality. No one's opinion is automatically correct or necessarily superior, and I can't expect anyone to treat my opinions any differently than I would be willing to treat theirs. Wisdom. It's better to hear-out a bad idea than to risk censoring a potentially good one."

If one group (let's say Westboro) was banned from sharing they're opinions then what stops me from being censored next. I have never seen a Nazi conference in my life and never saw anyone waving swastika flags. I do hope you haven't gathered your views on American society from reality TV and our news. Where did you learn about the public Nazi meetings?  Also most of the racism I've seen I believe strms from when we used to own slaves. As in some guy from back then used the word n***** and his son picked up on this and then his son etc. The main thing the amendment protects is the right for my voice to be heard.

answers,3br6ei,Mountebank,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:02:57 2015 UTC,"There's a line between what can and can't be said in public. This is true everywhere, not just the US.  The US just happens to have a wider definition of allowable speech than in most other places.  So long as the speech doesn't directly incite violence or is likely to cause a panic (shouting ""fire"" in a theater being the classic example), then it can't be legally punished, at least by itself.  Yes, this means people like the WBC or the KKK can legally have their rallies, but that also means other minority groups can have theirs as well.  Legally, you can hold a gay pride parade in the middle of Alabama if you wanted (provided that the proper paperwork and such for a parade were approved which is a whole other matter).  When the government starts disallowing certain types of speech, then it becomes quite troublesome.  Take hate speech for instance.  You can't say bad things about certain ethnic and religious groups, but which ones?  Obviously you can't say bad things about established relgious groups like Christians, Jews, and Muslims, but what about Scientologists?  Satanists?  Pastafarians?  Does the UK have a master list of what groups you can and can't malign?  Once you start singling out groups, you have to start classifying every group out there.  Am I allowed to say bad things about the Westboro Baptist Church in the UK or is that a form of hate speech as well?  So the idea behind the First Amendment is to just let it all be free and let society sort it out, not the government.  Remember, the First Amendment only limits what the government can do with respect to it--it doesn't mean people have to be happy with what is said.  You can use your own free speech to talk back.  The government stays out of it.  Of course, this is all how it's supposed to work in theory.  The reality of the situation may or may not be drastically different from this."
answers,3br6ei,Brawldud,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:31:47 2015 UTC,"It's not really that drastically different in practice. People preach racism and sexism and try to justify on the internet why they should be allowed to have sex with kids on the Internet all the time. Furthermore open political dissent, even supporting communism and anarchism and fascism, are all very legal and people so do on the Internet without the government punishing them.  Obviously things like openly encouraging and inciting terrorism or violence are entirely different matters, but people do not get arrested and killed for just speaking out against the government or positing an unpopular belief.  But yeah, where a lot of people tend to get messed up insofar as the meaning of the first amendment is concerned is that freedom of speech does not protect a person from the consequences of their speech; if you say offensive things you will likely be socially ostracized, criticized by others, have your forum posts removed, and offend other people in your business, it is all perfectly legal and should be. But that is what freedom of speech is intended to do; using society as a mechanism for pushing ""bad"" speech to the sidelines without requiring government enforcement."

answers,3bq7xd,13ComingDown,4,Wed Jul 1 07:06:57 2015 UTC,"Airline Aerospace Engineer chiming in:  The actual implementation would be relatively easy from a technical perspective. A lot of aircraft already have cockpit door cameras (post 9/11 thing for some airlines). You'd have some issues getting certificates to put the equipment on the plane (regulations and such) but that'd be minimal in comparison to...  Privacy concerns. Pilots and their union(s) fought hard for the limited voice recording that is already on the plane. The current cockpit voice recorders loop back on themselves every few hours, so only the important moments before an incident are kept. They're VERY concerned that any additional equipment that can be used to monitor the flight would be used against them. We (Engineering) have to fight tooth and nail to get permission to pull data off the flight data recorder for performance data analysis.   I can't see the video being too useful for the cockpit anyway. Most of them are cramped enough and you'd need a crazy wide angle lens to see everything, which even then you'd have obstructed views. The data recorders already capture almost everything the NTSB needs.  As for the cabin I wouldn't see this as a huge issue, you might get some resistance from consumers. I can't comment too much on this as I deal with freighters and not passenger jets (ULDs don't complain about being watched).

answers,3blqlf,VersalEszett,18,Tue Jun 30 22:29:56 2015 UTC,"There's no way for drivers driving behind the truck to know if its loaded or not.   Most people think of speed limits as something that drivers need to adhere to, but they're also ways to categorize the way roads are built. If you have a 130 speed limit in Europe, that means your road is fenced off, there are no intersections, lane width, drivers coming onto the road have X meters to merge, turns must be signaled Y meters ahead, etc. If it's 30, then you can build narrower lanes, traffic calming devices, street parking, intersections with or without lights, etc.  Now, all those things make assumptions about the technical abilities of the vehicles and the reaction times needed to be safe. With driving, reaction distance, time and speed all go hand in hand. For example, if you have a 120kph limit you need to give drivers an absolute minimum of 90m reaction distance for a drive to be able to stop in front of something on the road. So you don't build curves that give drivers less than 150m of visibility (usually more, since humans suck at these things). With a heavy truck, your numbers are way off in relation to what cars can do, so you need either more or lower speeds to be able to stop."

Poop is two things: the husks of dead bacteria that helped digest the food that you ate, and all the food you couldn't digest.  Our digestive systems are pretty limited in the things we can get energy from. We can't digest cellulose, for example, so our ability to extract energy from vegetables - especially those stalky, woody ones - is relatively limited. Resistant starches are difficult to break down as well. Shells, bones, etc - all those things might contain energy (all matter does) - but it's completely unavailable to us.  Bacteria are also a key element in breaking down a lot of plant matter into digestible elements. That's why you might have stomach issues after a round of antibiotics. The pills kill off some of the bacteria in your stomach, which means that it's not being broken down when it should be, causing bacteria in your lower intestine to get at it and produce gas (and possibly loose stools, when your body tries to flush it out).  Regardless of what your vegan friends might have been telling you, our digestive systems digest meat more efficiently than almost any plant matter. Eat a steak, which is fat + protein + water, and your stool will be minimal. It's not stuck in your colon, it's just been digested and what you're pooping out is mostly the bacteria used to digest it."

So if I eat a bag of chips with X'mg of sodium it's 50% of my daily salt intake (based on a 2000 calorie diet). If my daily caloric intake is less, say 1000 then it would be 100% of my daily caloric intake.  The percentage isn't regarding what the food is made of, it's how much ""nutrition"" each serving fulfills hours dietary needs."

In that weight, the sodium etc. is already accounted for, so I assume as before that what's left is basically water/moisture etc. with no or negigible nutritional data."

This would create bubbles at first, but would then start ""rippling"" the rest of the water with some sort of whirlpool effect.  This would swirl the existing bubbles into a round shape."

My biggest concern is my mom;  she's sneaking up on 80 years old and computer stuff is difficult for her.     I'd like to be able to send her one link, one time and have that work for the duration of my 2 week trip so she can follow along since she can't really leave her own house anymore.     I don't care if I have to restart the app daily or whatever... though every 4 hours like Glympse does would be annoying (and a new link every 4 hours would suck for mom)"

You can also set how frequently it should update your location to the server, which can be useful for preserving battery life. You're then given a URL which you can share with people who want to track your location. It works really well and I highly recommend it."

AllMusic.com classifies them as ""Harmony Vocal Groups"" although that is not very descriptive of their style.  If you want to branch off into gospel, you've also got the Golden Gate Quartet, The Staple Singers, The Soul Stirrers, The Fairfield Four, The Dixie Hummingbirds, the Blind Boys of Alabama.  I think the Ink Spots were influenced by gospel styles, although they didn't sing gospel."
