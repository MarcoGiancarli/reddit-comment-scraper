Why not complain about the US government's Dept. of Agriculture or Commerce which help shove tobacco down the throats of other countries?  Why aren't we attacking the so-called ""free trade"" agreements and legal mechanisms which allow corporations to sue other countries?  Wouldn't we be better off trying to regain control of our corporate-controlled government and restoring the republic?   ""I hope we shall take warning from the example of England and crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations which dare already to challenge our Government to trial and bid defiance to the laws of our country."" -- Thomas Jefferson, 1816."

uspolitics,3e2tkn,plutonicraven,2,Tue Jul 21 23:44:23 2015 UTC,"Perhaps one. But overall, I'd say it's the inherent corruption of capitalism.  Our economic system is based on raw greed and self-interest. It's in the economic interests of capitalists to bribe/lobby government officials and to take over the government, so they do.  If it wasn't the CoC, capitalists would just invent another organization, ALEC, or whatever.   ""The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State itself. That, in its essence, is fascism - ownership of government by an individual, by a group or by any other controlling private power."" -- US President Franklin D. Roosevelt."

""If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing."" -- Malcolm X."

Pay no attention to the US fighting wars across the planet! Pay no attention to gov't spying, racism or our eroding civil liberties! Pay no attention to the man behind the mirror curtain!   Instead, pay attention to the demagogue disrespecting the war criminal!  Edit: Above typo."

uspolitics,3dv46g,pateras,-3,Sun Jul 19 19:41:41 2015 UTC,God how many articles do we need about the attendance numbers of a Bernie rally? Of course they will continue to get bigger. That's how it works or they are toast. But we don't 20 posts a day telling us this. This is not news.
