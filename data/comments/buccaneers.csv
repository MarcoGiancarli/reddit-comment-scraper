I am roughly your same dimensions, actually, and my Jerseys are youth XLs. I don't like that baggy jersey stuff. They are a little snug because the beer belly has gotten bigger, but a youth XL or adult small is where you'd want to be."
buccaneers,3e71cu,mothershipq,2,Wed Jul 22 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"I don't want it to be overly baggy, but I definitely don't want it to be snug either. I'm leaning between Medium and Large.

buccaneers,3e2s5w,LiquidSnape,8,Wed Jul 22 05:15:56 2015 UTC,What the article leaves out is that this is part of the original lease agreement for the stadium.  It also leaves out that the Bucs have also added their own cash into the project to increase it's scope.  Let us also not forget that the stadium cost less than $300mill if inflated to today's dollar.
buccaneers,3e2s5w,Congzilla,4,Tue Jul 21 15:31:18 2015 UTC,"How much have the Glazers put in to it? I am ok with public money for stadiums because I think having sports teams in the area is a public benefit, but I don't want to be 100% on the hook. The Bucs are worth a LOT more money than what the Glazers paid for the team, and it's largely due to the stadium deal. They had better be putting in some of their own damn money."
buccaneers,3e2s5w,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:29 2015 UTC,Even if the TSA did pay for all of it the deal is still fantastic.  The Bucs don't get paid for the other events there like is part of many other stadiums.  A lot of stadiums built at the same time are being fully replaced now.  And out stadium was extremely inexpensive even when you account for inflation.  But I'm at work and trying to research that on my phone would be a pain.  I can tell you the bulk of money for these upgrades was agreed to before the stadium was built at part of the long term rental agreement.
buccaneers,3e2s5w,Congzilla,3,Tue Jul 21 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure that the Glazers do get most of the non-Buc related revenue the stadium directly generates.  http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/bucs/content/raymond-james-stadium-project-reminder-glazers-sweetheart-deal  Again, I'm not even opposed to that...but it would be nice to see the Glazers kicking in some of their money. This is why Jeff Vinik is so beloved and the Glazers still get sideways glances from locals. I think even Stu Sternberg is better than the Glazers. He's offered to kick in his own money for a new baseball stadium. Have the Glazers paid for ANYTHING?"

buccaneers,3e2s5w,Congzilla,0,Wed Jul 22 01:52:25 2015 UTC,The vendor is payed by either the glazer's or the taxpayers. And the vendor is still the same now. If they ran a top notch stadium none of those things would be happening.

buccaneers,3e2s5w,FEO4,3,Wed Jul 22 13:24:01 2015 UTC,"I know the TSA has money in escrow for improvements to the stadium, and has been sitting on millions of dollars that's earmarked for improvements for quite some time.  I can't find any information on that money now, though, so it's surprising to read that taxpayers are expected to foot the bill for stadium improvements, even if it's only a portion, since there should be money already set aside for it.  In either case, it would be nice to not have analog jumbotrons anymore."
buccaneers,3e2s5w,babytie,3,Tue Jul 21 14:53:38 2015 UTC,The public fund already exists for this. Hillsborough county residents have already voted to allocate money for projects like this. I don't see what the big deal is. The Lightning are doing the same thing right now.
buccaneers,3e2s5w,2ndprize,3,Tue Jul 21 17:50:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the details are for Ray Jay, but the relationship with Vinik and the Lightning has been pretty good.  Vinik has already spent 60 million of his own money on the venue, ans the new project is 25 million.  He is getting 12.5 of it from the county.  But Vinik is also doing the whole chanelside project (which is listed at a billion dollars which seems fictional) The County/City is paying for infrastructure improvements that connect to that project (30 million). So Vinik is spending significant amounts of his own money on improvements for the County.   I'm not certain how much money the Glaziers have put into the stadium.  I know they didn't pay to build it, and all I can find is a story about them dumping a little over an extra million into paying for a better scoreboard than the tax dollars were budgeted for."
buccaneers,3e2s5w,babytie,3,Tue Jul 21 18:15:18 2015 UTC,"The Lightning definitely have a much stronger presence in the community than the Bucs do, and Vinik is actually focused on creating a lasting effect in Tampa. I don't think the Glazers are interested in that at all. What I am saying though is that funds have already been allocated for these projects by voters. Why pass the tax if you're going to object to the money being spent?"
buccaneers,3e2s5w,2ndprize,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:43 2015 UTC,Oh I don't object.  Hell I am all for public funding of sports.  It is a chance to enjoy my tax dollars being spent.  I was just responding because I thought the Lightning have been a bit different in their approach with the county and the prior comment sort of gave the implication that they acted in the same fashion.
buccaneers,3e2s5w,FEO4,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe that money could go towards the horrible public schools in hillsborough or perhaps go towards getting tampa out of the top 5 cities in the country for human trafficking?

buccaneers,3e2s5w,tbjl24,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:24:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. tickets are $35. If you want to sit in the sun for four hours. Literally just baking under the sun, for 4 hours, you can pay $35 to do that.  Then another $15 if you don't want to worry about getting towed.  Then budget some money for food/water, because you are going to be there for four hours.   It's not cheap to go to the games, especially if you don't want to sit in the sun. I rode a ticket rep to get season tickets this year, and they want season ticket holders, but they would not give ANY breaks. No deal on tickets, no deal on parking.

If we were making a list of the top 3 most talented players we've ever had you could make a case for him at #1 but if we're going to put his face in stone I'd like to at least know he won't embarrass us for the third time in one year. Also no one who has ever met him personally has ever said anything good about him.

buccaneers,3dsebk,Numeritus,4,Mon Jul 20 07:16:32 2015 UTC,"I'd go with ASJ. There is going to be a lot of check-down plays since most defenses like to blitz rookie QBs and also our OL will likely stay in the bottom 10 of the league. This would inflate his numbers and make him look better than however much progression than he has gone through anyways.   My other guess would be Jonathan Banks. He looked a lot more comfortable in Lovie's system late last year and with this being his third year in the league he has enough experience and help on the other side to post big numbers and start to scare the NFC South. He has all the tools to be great in Lovie's defensive scheme: height, hands, and a sharp mental game."

We seem more cool and collected.  We've got plenty of depth problems still and if we get the injury bug we could be looking at another awful season.  I feel optimistic that this season will be much better though and I could see us going anywhere from 6-10 to 9-7 depending on how much our offense gels and how quickly Jameis adjusts.  Jameis has a ton of potential and if he can come close to fulfilling that potential he can be a great QB for us."

I feel like this is the most important thing, we have no depth and injuries will happen. It's inevitable. I think our D-line and linebackers can survive a man down, depending on who it is. But god help us if one offensive lineman goes down, or McDougald gets hurt, or Verner/Banks"
buccaneers,3dlaom,Devils_-_Advocate,2,Fri Jul 17 13:50:27 2015 UTC,God if Verner goes down I'll be so upset. Dude is our saving grace in the secondary.
buccaneers,3dlaom,spideralex90,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:03:16 2015 UTC,Sterling Moore did okay last year. He won't be able to replace Verner if he goes down though.
buccaneers,3dlaom,JaquiskiTaterTartt,2,Sat Jul 18 22:24:44 2015 UTC,I agree completely. I think Licht and Lovie just know more about our roster and our needs.  I think we did an excellent job of getting great value in our offseason pickups.
buccaneers,3dlaom,Steezewell,5,Sat Jul 18 05:12:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you mention a bunch of running Qbs as its predecessors (also: Cam has years left on him and while he isn't elite, he isn't going anywhere as a franchise QB- he's certainly above the Dalton line).  Anyways, on the back of the defense, I'm seeing 7-9."
buccaneers,3dlaom,dmun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"I mention them because they're the most recent Heisman winning quarterbacks.

buccaneers,3dlaom,Fyresand,3,Fri Jul 17 23:10:33 2015 UTC,"I see at least 6 wins. Barring something very random and bad happhappening like last season anything less would be a disappointment. That said I think are ceiling is very tough to say, if Jameis does great and has an Andrew Luck like rookie season and our oline holds I think we can go 11-5. Though that is with everything going right, I think more 7-9 or 8-8."
buccaneers,3dlaom,Mothafuckacuoms,3,Fri Jul 17 06:10:38 2015 UTC,I think we should have grabbed at least one O-lineman in free agency like Evan Mathis. Even someone who plays less of a role for at least some more depth. I see us at around 5-6 wins. To achieve anything better we have to learn how to close the damn game. If we can close out close games I can say at most 8-8 but that's a high ceiling. Go Bucs!
buccaneers,3dlaom,ballinben,2,Fri Jul 17 06:43:27 2015 UTC,7-9 is my official prediction. But I think our ceiling is 10-6 and our floor is 5-11.
buccaneers,3dlaom,FEO4,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:19:23 2015 UTC,I think your prediction and the projected ceiling are accurate but to say our floor is winning more than twice as many games as last year is a little optimistic for me... We are the bucs after all...
buccaneers,3dlaom,MediumRed,2,Fri Jul 17 20:45:21 2015 UTC,7-9 with lots of leads blown late.
buccaneers,3dlaom,godtogblandet,3,Fri Jul 17 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"Bucs is one of the teams I am gonna follow this year. And barring a complete meltdown I have you fighting for second place in the div vs the Saints and possibly a wildcard spot if Jameis plays a good rookie season. You could win the div if the Panthers start of slow again or keep fucking around like last year. On paper however Panthers seems like the team to beat in the south this year.   I think Falcons finnishes last, they have a good offense, but that D is horrible and I don't think Quinn is that good of a coach. His success in Seatle was mostly based on too good talent to fail.   So I would say something in the range of 7 to 10 wins next year for you guys, with the defense being good enough to get you 6 wins on their own, and then it's up to Jameis to ball out for the other 1-4 wins.   Saints don't look that good on paper this year, but you never know with them from year to year. Based on last year their defense will cost them games.   That makes my south prediction something like this:  Panthers: 10-12 wins.  Bucs: 7-10 wins.  Saints: 7-10 wins.  Falcons: 0-5 wins.  Either way, this is gonna be a fun season. I can't wait to see what Jameis does in the NFL, and your defense is gonna really step it up  this season under Lovie, barring more fireworks incidents."
buccaneers,3dlaom,Numeritus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:27:10 2015 UTC,"As much as a I hate the Failcons, there's no way they don't win a game. I'd have them more like 3-9 wins. They could be Bucs' 2014 bad or they could go back to being an above-average team, but there's no way they go 0-16."
buccaneers,3dlaom,joy4874,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:24:56 2015 UTC,"Coming off a 2-14 year, it's tough to say they're going to win the division. Having said that, seeing as how the Panthers won last year gong 7-8-1, anything is definitely possible. They have to have a lot of help to get this done; an offensive line that can finally mesh together and play well, a stronger running game our of their stable, and a defense that doesn't give up leads late in the game. Personally, I think the ceiling is 9-7, which that would be a huge turn around. Going into the Bye week in Week 6, they have real chance to go 3-2 (wins against titans,jags, and either panthers/saints) however I would love to see them at 4-1 and even beat Houston, but I feel like their defense may prove too much. If they can get this juncture with a winning record or .500, I think it will be an accomplishment for them. Personally, I've sat through too many years of futility to keep being optimistic without actually seeing some real, tangible progress first."
buccaneers,3dlaom,particleman1010,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:14:08 2015 UTC,"I see us as a 7-9, but as a fan I have to reconcile that I have unrealistic views.  The painful reality is that we are either 4-12, or 5-11. We think our O-line might be iffy, reality is it is gonna be a train-wreck. Jameis might be good, but reality is he's gonna do dumb rookie things and cost us games. I feel like our defense could be amazing, reality is, they will play great, make the game close, then fail critically in the 4th quarter unable to close out. I feel like we have a bunch of solid RBs, reality is between O-line and being behind in games, we will be a 1 dimensional offense that has to throw to have any chance of winning in the 4th quarter.   After last year, I'm done with offseason hype. Get ready guys... we are still gonna suck!  Lets just hope we don't reboot our coaches again, we need to have patience if we ever expect to get out of this shitty situation we've been in the past 7 years."
buccaneers,3dlaom,DeviledCrab,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:26:34 2015 UTC,"The defense will be solid but there are still problematic holes (DE, safety namely) that haven't really been filled that will keep them from being elite. Then on offense, I think Jameis is a game changer and he'll give juice to everyone around him that wasn't there before. So its possible the O-line could perform better than expected based on that. That being said, going into the season the O-line projects as one of the worst in the NFL, to put it nicely. And there isn't any depth there either, so that's not good. With such a good receiving corps and a real qb, we should be able to throw it now, but I'm not sure about the running game. Could be better than expected, but again that relies on the O-line doing the same.   Overall, I think the defense will be even better than last year and land just inside the top 10 in the NFL. I think the offense will be better than last year, but inconsistent with a rookie qb behind a bad O-line. I'm realistically hoping for a 8-8 type season as a nice step in the right direction."

When the Ray Jay was put up the team got a super sweetheart deal from the city with the luxury boxes and stadium revenue along with the property tax breaks. As far as I'm aware the Bucs were one of the first teams to get such a deal, helping to pad their bottom line, and over the last several years many other teams are catching up. That coupled with the obviously sub par product that has been put on the field recently.  Just a guess.

You could have a whole other piece on how the 2nd overall QB tends to suck. You can find a correlation with just about anything, if you want to find it.  TL;DR= I agree!"
buccaneers,3de7r3,ApolloXLII,11,Wed Jul 15 20:42:34 2015 UTC,"I think the reason so many Heisman winning quarterbacks struggle in the NFL is because the reason they won in college was heavily based on their ability to scramble, as well as pass. Look at RG3, Johnny Manziel, tim tebow, and Cam Newton. A lot of college systems really favor a duel threat quarterback, but the Heisman trophy especially favors them because of the inflated numbers with rushing TDs. However, the run heavy QB system doesn't work in the NFL nearly as much, and that is why so many fail. Cam is adjusting nicely, but it is certainly taking time.   I think Jameis won't be affected by this because he is much more of a pocket passer, which tends to do better in the NFL. I think Mariota will struggle, especially with the lack of talent surrounding him on the Titans. Certainly not every quarterback who won the Heisman is a DT, but many are and that skill set does not translate well."
buccaneers,3de7r3,RadioOnInternet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"Cam is adjusting nicely, but it is certainly taking time.   Yeah, well, lots of things take time as a quarterback when your O-line blows and your secondary couldn't stop a dead rat from catching 90-yard touchdown bombs.  Also, I think your use of the terms “pocket passer” and “dual threat” are pretty liberal—Tim Tebow is not a dual threat quarterback in any sense of the word. Manziel is pushing it just because of how willing he is to run before passing.  Mariota is really good and will do well with good coaching and with weapons around him (the latter definitely doesn't exist in the present with the Titans, but that's easily fixed). I've always maintained that. When he's in passing mode, he plays his position like a pocket passer—that's how a dual threat kind of guy should play. The running threat is for when the play breaks down."

buccaneers,3de7r3,redout9122,2,Thu Jul 16 09:46:18 2015 UTC,It comes down to the fact that college and pro are really different games. The speed of play is different. The play calling is (mostly) different. And the atmosphere is different.  Some players adjust. Some don't.  And being the Heisman winner puts further scrutiny on a player. If he doesn't come in and turn into Manning or Brady by the 10th game everyone outside of the team is calling him a bust.

buccaneers,3de8ms,TheMasiah,9,Wed Jul 15 16:13:28 2015 UTC,"For those that haven't seen it yet Houston signed a six-year, $101 million deal, including $52.5 million guaranteed.  I really don't think it's going to effect the negotiations all that much considering they really don't play the same positions.  Justin Houston is a 3-4 OLB and would play much more like a DE in Tampa's system.    As far as predicting the value of Lavonte's new deal, that's much more difficult.  There are a few things that are keeping Lavonte's value from reaching the same value as Houston's.    First, 4-3 Wills such as Lavonte are not sought after the way 3-4 LEOs and OLBs such as Justin Houston are.  Should Lavonte test the Free Agency waters he would have less suitors than a guy like Houston would, lessening his demand and driving down his value.  Secondly, even the teams that are looking for a 4-3 WLB are generally going to prefer a bit bigger and more physical player than Lavonte.  Before I get attacked, please understand this is not a personal criticism of him. He is absolutely perfect for Tampa's system.  If I where to grow the perfect cover 2 Will in a vat he would look like Lavonte David, it's just that most teams prefer their Wills to be a bit bigger. So again lessening his demand and driving down his value.  Lastly, it looks like the Buccaneer front office will get this deal done before Lavonte's contract is up preventing him from testing the Free Agent market.  This gives the FO a bit of an advantage in negotiations because Lavonte is unable to compare Tampa's offer with firm offers from other teams.  Just look at the difference between McCoy's and Suh's deals last season.  Over the lifetimes of the two deals Tampa will pay McCoy about $42M less than Miami will have to pay Suh (not to mention Tampa's deal is much more cap friendly). I have serious doubts Tampa would have been able to sign McCoy so comparatively cheaply had he hit the open market.   Which brings me to my guess, 6 years, $54 Million.  It could be much more.  I wouldn't be shocked to see it go as high as $70M and he is certainly worth that to the team.  It's just I don't see that happening considering his demand.  Every team needs a top flight QB, not every team needs an undersized Will."
buccaneers,3de8ms,jaemarl,4,Wed Jul 15 17:38:35 2015 UTC,"No effin' way he signs for less than $10mm a year.  The salary cap just keeps going up.  I agree he may not get as much as Justin Houston, but it's going to be hella close.  David was holding out for a contract exactly to see what his peers would get.  5 years, 75 million"
buccaneers,3de8ms,The_RumHam,2,Wed Jul 15 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"When you say peers, who are you talking about? What top teir OLB has gotten a contract lately? The best I can think of is Akeem Ayers and he only got a 2 year $6M deal out of Detroit. Last year Vontaze Burfict didn't even get $5M a year out of Cincy.   If Von Miller or even Dont'a Hightower get extensions soon that would go a long way to establishing Lavonte's market value.  In any case, and as much as I love Lovonte, he doesn't have a prayer of getting $15M a year, no 4-3 OLB does."
buccaneers,3de8ms,jaemarl,3,Wed Jul 15 23:17:57 2015 UTC,I knew this thread would be here.  Houston is a pass rusher; David is not.

If the argument Is that Lavonte and Gerald didn't need the guidance, then maybe there are some real concerns with Jameis if Derrick thinks he needs to see him every single day, I know Derrick knows a lot more about Jameis than we do at this point, being in the highest of the FSU alum inner circles."

Like devils Advocate said above, with the addition of Tim Wright I think his numbers won't be as spectacular now. I'd say Kenny Bell is gonna be our teams sleeper this year. The kid is very, very fast and has great hands. I've heard all kinds of comparisons but the main one I hear is that he's a faster version of Wes Welker which would be awesome. Plus with Evans, ASJ, and Jackson drawing all the attention I think he'll get some pretty tasty 1v1 match ups against the weaker CBs.   Also love the Josh Hill pick. I know I'm supposed to hate the Saints but I think that people are really underestimating him this year (hence the ""sleeper"" tag) and I think he's primed for a big year. Having Brees throwing the ball to you helps too. Anyways Great write up man!"

buccaneers,3d9apt,Devils_-_Advocate,3,Tue Jul 14 17:31:52 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  We're doing a series predicting sleepers for every NFL team on our sportsblog, and a Panthers fan just posted his ones for the NFC South. I'm interested to know your thoughts about ASF - he had a bad rookie year, but are you hopeful he can rebound, or is he being labelled with the dreaded bust tag?  If you could only pick one sleeper from the Bucs, who would you chose? It's still a pretty weak division, and improved QB play along with a young player or two breaking out could maybe help you push for an unlikely playoff birth."
buccaneers,3d9apt,joy4874,3,Tue Jul 14 14:40:18 2015 UTC,"ASJ, and you can't label a guy a bust after his rookie season, I don't care who he is.   ASJ was injured last year, if he can stay out of the tub then he'll be a good player. I guess you could label him as a ""sleeper"", you'll know once we trim the roster down to 53. We'll probably carry 3 TE's, and out of the group of ASJ, Meyers, T. Wright and L. Stocker, I'm betting Stocker gets the boot.   Out of the remaining 3, Wright is the better pass catcher, Meyers is just cheap and experienced, and ASJ can do a little blocking and catching. Koetter has done very well with TE's in the past, I would expect our group to have decent numbers, nothing spectacular."

I personally feel he's pretty genuine but I'm curious to see how he handles losing at the pro level (as we aren't in a position to be a playoff team we're going to see a fair number of losses still).  Pre-draft I was all for Mariota but I've since felt that Jameis was the better choice for our system. I'm really excited for week 1 and it should be a great matchup.  I'm not excited however for the over reactions by the media about both QB's regardless of how the game pans out.  Oh and the general consensus here is that Jameis brings a charisma and swagger we haven't had from a QB in a while, and he's definitely got potential to grow here. Our fanbase though needs to not overreact if Jameis struggles early. I'm hoping he can perform on a level similar to Teddy Bridgewater did last year.

buccaneers,3d7ghi,FEO4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:43:20 2015 UTC,"There is a good chance we will look real dumb firing Schiano for lovie in about 2 years. Not saying either is good but I could see lovie getting the boot in the next two years and at about the same time Schiano getting a job for the patriots, probably as a special teams coordinator...but none the less, one more job than lovie would have at that time."
buccaneers,3d7ghi,TheAman44,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:04:04 2015 UTC,There is nothing that could possibly happen that would make the team look dumb for firing Schiano. Lovie could take the team to four straight 0-16 seasons (ignore the fact that he'd get fired long before he had a chance for that) and firing Schiano would still be the correct move.
buccaneers,3d7ghi,FEO4,2,Wed Jul 15 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"Why is that? What is the gauge you are using? To me the team was looking up with Schiano bringing great talent and great character guys. The on field production was lacking but if lovie isn't to blame for last season then you can't pin it all on Schiano either. Wins and losses wise we havnt improved either, I'm not sure if you remember but we only won 2 games last year. Worse than Schiano did in his very first year in the NFL in fact worse than he ever did in his short NFL career (so much for being just a college coach). Go ahead with all of the fan boy bullshit reasons he had to go like ""losing the team"" and ""not treating players like men"". We hardly have any men on our team, it is my experience that the people who resist guidance the most are the ones who actually need it the worst. Look at the patriots cutting talib and spikes who talked mad shit about bellichik afterwards and he went on to win the super bowl without them."
buccaneers,3d7ghi,TheAman44,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:46:39 2015 UTC,"To make it truly brief, because arguing about this that happened a year and a half ago seems wrong, you have to use ""losing the team"", because otherwise Raheem Morris should have never been fired. HOWEVER, if you don't want me to use that, I'll say this. It's impossible to say the team was looking up, considering they did worse in his second year than his first year. That is, by definition, not looking up. Greg Schiano was never more than a mediocre coach, even in college (never could win the conference with superior talent to many of the coaches that did win the conference) and he never showed more than mediocrity in the NFL. Even if you believe that Lovie is a mediocre coach as well, that doesn't change the fact that Schiano should have been fired. The firing and hiring are two separate things, and Schiano did not belong as a head coach in the NFL. You can say that the Lovie Smith hiring was wrong. But unless you also want to argue that the Raheem Morris firing was wrong, it's nearly impossible to argue that Schiano firing was wrong."
buccaneers,3d7ghi,FEO4,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:26:34 2015 UTC,"I'm too loyal to want to see anyone fired I'll probably even defend lovie at some point. I think that one season is not worth firing someone you have invest millions upon millions of dollars in. They gave him free reign to do and sign whoever he wanted and then they pulled the rug out from under him half way through. And with everything we had going on that year OUTSIDE OF FOOTBALL and out of the realm of control for the HC it is almost surprising we won as many as we did. I think my biggest issue is with the way the glazer's tell a coach they have his back,even after we went 0-8 they assured Schiano he would be back the next season, and then they just turn on him because a bunch of fans and media members who have no clue and no investment in the team didn't like his attitude.        The glazer boys are spineless cowards who are doing everything in their power to recreate the exact same organization that their dad constructed years ago, and the majority of fans are so blinded by our desire to instantaneously compete that they will convince themselves that this is a good idea. Outside of using that cookie cutter method they have no fucking clue what to do with this franchise. Regardless of how he is as a coach the lovie hire only confirmed everything I have always thought about them. And since we are talking records let me just say that Schiano had twice as many wins in his worst season as an NFL HC as lovie did last year, and somehow now we are looking up?      All these little glazer bitches care about is pleasing the fans In hopes that they will finally buy tickets but what most people don't see is that we are steering this ship straight off a cliff. I don't care if every single fans hates the team for one whole offseason, even losing season ticket holders wouldn't matter, because if there's one thing I know it's that winning fixes everything. The problem is the glazer's don't know how to win so they have to do the next best thing, suck up to fans, no wonder we r a laughing stock."
buccaneers,3d7ghi,nutramoil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:21:25 2015 UTC,"I think Schiano gets shit on way too much.  Most NFL fans shit on him because of his rushing the kneel down in week 1 of his first season.  That hate stayed with him so much that people blame him for every bad thing with the Bucs.  MRSA?  Blame Schiano.  Josh Freeman not getting voted team captain by his teammates?  Blame Schiano.  Josh Freeman's medical history being revealed?  Blame Schiano.  Will he end up being a HOF coach elsewhere?  Probably not, but he is the coach this team needed at the time coming off of the real trainwreck of Raheem Morris.  I think had the owners stuck with him and not listened to the fans too much he would have turned things around and gotten us back to respectability.  Hoping Lovie does the same."

buccaneers,3cu5in,TheFencingCoach,12,Fri Jul 10 20:50:10 2015 UTC,having a joe jurevicius jersey makes up for those blunders my friend

buccaneers,3cu5in,ApolloXLII,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:26:42 2015 UTC,"I still wear creamsicle Alstott and white Brooks--had to scrap the others (Dunn, Williams, Lynch, Freeman, and Sapp after the rape stuff).  Not going to roll the dice on Winston unless he makes it more than 2 years without becoming a black Johnny Manziell."
buccaneers,3cu5in,WajorMeasel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'd never scrap a player's jersey, regardless of how long they were on the team. The jerseys are more about the team than anything, in my opinion. But then again, I was SO excited when I got to pull out my retired Dunn Bucs jersey and wear it again, faded numbers and all! The guy was my idol back when he played for FSU and the Bucs, so of course I kept it.  Oh, but quick question, why a black Johnny Manziel? About the only thing they happen to have in common is that they play QB. And I had Manziel as much as the next non-Texan or douchebag (not calling Texans douchebags, it's just those are the only two different types of people that like the turd), but why would you give him one year but Winston two?"

(Aggressive catch, possession catch, and run after catch).  Aggressive catch makes your receiver battle for the ball and is ideal for big/athletic receivers."

Yeah that's true if your QB isn't getting sacked every fucking play.  I played against a buddy of mine a couple of weeks ago with the updated Bucs team on Madden 15. He was the Bengals, and it was... awful. I think we quit playing after the 3rd quarter because McCown was on his back the whole time."

The Falcons had more injuries than anyone on their offensive line last year, going so far as to start tight ends on the Oline. And yet the Bucs were still worse.  I would have liked to have more depth, but I don't trust the coach to actually succeed. I still wonder how Warhop is employed by the Bucs"
buccaneers,3cp9lk,spideralex90,3,Thu Jul 9 19:55:56 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you about Warhop. I'm very surprised he wasn't let go after last season, my best guess was Lovie and Licht felt it was on them for blowing up the line like they did. In my opinion if our line doesn't progress to their liking this year he will be first to go."

buccaneers,3cp9lk,SilentSentinel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:49:10 2015 UTC,"God forbid Tampa uses a 4th rounder on him and misses out on the chance to grab another great player like Luke Stocker. Now you have a D-III project working to make the starting 5 on the line. If anything Battle could have provided a little motivation throughout camp AT THE LEAST, and there was little or no risk whatsoever. They've promised to work on the offensive line, and they've done very little so far. Drafting 2 rookies to play on the line isn't an immediate fix. After last season, they don't have as much slack as they would like to work on developing players. Licht is content with his ""I'm smarter than you"" pick of Ali Marpet. I guess they're looking to draft Nkemdiche in the top 5 next year to put on the D line with McCoy."

buccaneers,3cp9lk,Flacracker_173,3,Thu Jul 9 18:05:56 2015 UTC,He was definitely a multi year project. The amount of waist bending he put up on film is horrendous. I think Pamphile will end up as the better player in the long run. But you are certainly right about needing depth. Ah well.

buccaneers,3cg059,vande700,5,Tue Jul 7 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"Literally the easiest mock draft that someone had to put together all year. Every report so far has him going anywhere from the 3rd-5th. A 3rd rd pick is relatively high to put on a supplemental player, so Tampa may be able to reason with a 4th rounder. There aren't that many 4th round picks on the team still from the last few drafts so getting rid of one doesn't seem to be too severe."
buccaneers,3cg059,vande700,3,Tue Jul 7 18:03:39 2015 UTC,"I would pull the trigger on him. Like you said, 4th round picks are a very small risk"
buccaneers,3cg059,mattbarber51993,3,Tue Jul 7 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"Going back to 2009, the Bucs 4th round picks are as follows:  2015-Kwon Alexander (this remains to be seen)  2014- Did not have one (Selected Kadeem Edwards and Kevin Pamphile in the 5th round)  2013-Akeem Spence (Hasn't really came into his own yet, although he is promising to step it up this year)  2012-Did not have one (drafted Najee Goodee from WVU in 5th)  2011- Luke Stocker (essentially another blocking lineman, but no real passing threat as a TE)  2010- Mike Williams (started out promising but soon was traded to Buffalo)  2009-Kyle Moore  I mean looking at the picks far, it doesn't really seem like any of these players were steals yet. So if we have an option at the start of the 4th round, why not take it?"

buccaneers,3cg059,I_Dumped_Adele,3,Wed Jul 8 14:42:11 2015 UTC,Evidently he's regarded as the best player to enter the supplemental draft since Josh Gordon. Anyone know his story or watched him play? Who do we have here?
buccaneers,3cg059,I_Dumped_Adele,9,Tue Jul 7 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"All I know about him is he punched a player at NC State during a game(uppercut with a helmet on to boot) and was cited for marijuana possession last month. So his foray into the NFL might be the fact that this was his last ditch effort to go pro. All things considered, I really don't want any player who is mentioned in the same breath as Josh Gordon, as the guy is a perennial screw up. Having said that, if they can help him turn the corner, he could be a huge steal.   Bryan Broaddus of the DallasCowboys.com also saw a lot to like while watching Battle on tape:  ""He has lined up at both tackle spots, but primarily played left side later in the season. He plays with surprising initial quickness despite his long, rangy build. Playing and foot speed are solid once he gets on the second level and out on the edge in space when blocking in the running game. Did not see him have to make any blocks where he pulled but was able to make the reach and cut off block staying on his feet.""  EDIT: An article from bucsnation from a few days ago talks about how the Bucs are going to pass on Battle in the upcoming supplemental draft.  ""If the Bucs do select Battle they will lose that corresponding draft pick in the 2016 draft. A team source tells PewterReport.com ""those picks are gold"" given the talent level of next year's draft, so look for the Bucs to pass on Battle, especially with anything other than a late-round pick. The last player selected in the NFL's supplemental draft was Cleveland wide receiver Josh Gordon, who was drafted in the second round in the summer of 2012.""  Not really sure how many 4th round picks the Bucs have on their roster still from their respective draft classes, but I would bet my paycheck that I can count them on 1 hand. Say what you want about Marpet's potential, the guy is trying to make an unorthodox jump in terms of opponents skill sets from D-III to the pros. It would be nice to have someone else there, even if it's just for the training camp, to help push him."
buccaneers,3cg059,Fyresand,5,Tue Jul 7 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"Kudos and an upvote for providing just about all the info one could ask for on Battle. I only wonder how many rounds the supplemental draft is.. like, could we use a 6th or 7th rounder on him? I feel like it would be worth it at that point"
buccaneers,3cg059,impactplayer,3,Tue Jul 7 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"Much appreciated! The format is the same as the NFL draft, so there are 7 rounds and teams can submit claims each round on the players eligible to be drafted. After the order is determined, each team submits to the league the name of the player(s) they are interested in, as well as the round of the supplemental draft they would like to choose them in. The team that submits the highest bid is awarded rights to the player. If more than one team bids a pick from the same round, the team with the highest pick in the round wins out. So the caveat is that if a team uses a pick in the supplemental draft and they end up receiving the right to the player, they must forfeit their choice in the corresponding round of the next years NFL Draft. As of today 26 teams attended Battle's pro day, so there is some buzz around him."
buccaneers,3cg059,impactplayer,2,Tue Jul 7 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"We could use more warm bodies on the oline. I wouldn't risk anything higher than a 6th round pick for him, I mean fuck man, he can't be any worse than Oniel Cousins"

buccaneers,3ce370,Skewered_Planets,8,Tue Jul 7 07:10:07 2015 UTC,And some pre draft analysts thought he didn't have the speed to separate himself against the opposing secondary…smh
buccaneers,3ce370,Steezewell,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:15:11 2015 UTC,"That's because he doesn't. He just gets deep and then bodies the defender to get the ball at a higher point.

buccaneers,3ce370,GooieGui,5,Tue Jul 7 14:26:01 2015 UTC,He's faster than what you give him credit for. His long strides make him look slower than what he actually is. He consistently outran opposing DBs all season.
buccaneers,3ce370,lavonte_david,2,Tue Jul 7 16:36:11 2015 UTC,Ya he ran a 4.47 which isn't blazing fast but still is pretty fast. He doesn't accelerate that quickly but once he gets in full stride he can burn some DBs.

buccaneers,3cdukj,joy4874,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:08:44 2015 UTC,"I would say it depends on how he comes back from this. If he still puts up great numbers, then sure why not. If for some reason he is a shell of his former self, then you might look into this accident potentially hindering his performance. From all the reports coming out, it doesn't seem to be the case at all but if you're going to pay top dollar you need to make sure he can play. I mean he turned down $60 mil from New York, so Tampa will have to pay more than that."
buccaneers,3cdukj,joy4874,3,Tue Jul 7 15:39:19 2015 UTC,"Well he turned town $60M pre-injury then the $60M was withdrawn. Maybe NYG didn't want to give him the big money opportunity without some guarantee of health. Even if his numbers slip this year, he's still a good veteran to add and coach up the young guys.

buccaneers,3cb12d,Bucs_Nation,2,Mon Jul 6 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"The guy has the speed to play the edge, and sometimes does situationally. We brought him in to help us get to the passer, and I think he is going to dominate next to McCoy. One thing I've always loved about Melton is that he has a nasty speed off a super fast first step. He's not gonna straight bulldoze big guards or demand double teams, and he can be sometimes flushed completely out of the play, but he uses his speed and hands to take advantage of slower guards with sub-par footwork.  At least that's my take on him. It all could be a completely different story with the Bucs. Regardless, I've always loved the guy and was super happy when we picked him up. I would have preferred a DE, but don't be surprised to see him play situational DE, especially in certain packages."

buccaneers,3c4d7b,bretterson109,14,Sat Jul 4 19:35:32 2015 UTC,I think the takeaway is that Ronde is endorsing him. Ronde has done enough research on opposing qb's through his career to know what he is talking about.
buccaneers,3c4d7b,LansdowneStreet,-9,Sat Jul 4 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"I hope he gets this mentality taught right out of him.  There is no room for gunslinging in the pros.  When Ronde says you're a gunslinger, keep in mind that means he's picturing all the ways he could pick you off and then score with it, so the man knows of what he speaks.  Remember, Brett Favre might have won one Super Bowl, but he definitely threw two more away."
buccaneers,3c4d7b,ApolloXLII,4,Sun Jul 5 13:44:45 2015 UTC,"And Brett Favre also happens to be considered one of the best QBs to ever play and had a long, successful career.  What do you think of guys like Dan Fouts, Sonny Jurgensen, Sammy Baugh, Terry Bradshaw, Dan Marino, etc? All were considered gunslingers of their time.  When Ronde says you're a gunslinger, he's giving you a compliment."
buccaneers,3c4d7b,LansdowneStreet,-3,Sun Jul 5 18:36:38 2015 UTC,"And Brett Favre also happens to be considered one of the best QBs to ever play and had a long, successful career.   He threw two entire seasons away with ill-advised passes.   When Ronde says you're a gunslinger, he's giving you a compliment.   Ronde fed off gunslingers for his whole career.  Protecting the football is important and I damn sure hope Winston learns to do it better in the NFL than he ever did in college.    Also, Terry Bradshaw is the only quarterback you mentioned with multiple rings.  In fact, only two ""gunslingers"" in that group have any, and like I said Brett Favre arguably could have had one or two more had he not been the all-time leader in interceptions.  Many of which, of course, were thrown to a certain Buccaneers cornerback."
buccaneers,3c4d7b,ApolloXLII,6,Sun Jul 5 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"did you even attempt to read the article?!?!   ""But he has that ""it,"" that bravado, that gunslinger mentality, if I could use that (tired) cliché, to be a great quarterback in this league. I think the good ones have that. Now how he learns to deal with that as a pro and take care of the football and do the right things on the football field? But he has the tools.""   Also, apparently the only measurable to judge any QB ever is by how many rings he's got. So by your standards, for instance, Eli Manning is twice as good as his brother? You're funny."
buccaneers,3c4d7b,LansdowneStreet,0,Sun Jul 5 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"To me it sounds like people would better have the best quarterback ever than the best team ever, and if we're going to talk about shit that's never going to happen I'd prefer the latter to the former, thanks."

I've been saying that a quarterback who gives the ball away is bad for a team, so I don't quite see how.  Clearly believing that Winston needs to take better care of the football in the pros than in college makes me an asshole though, so I guess I wouldn't see how.  Seriously.  I care about wins and losses more than QB numbers.  Because, you know, I'm a fan of the Bucs, not just the Bucs' quarterback."
buccaneers,3c4d7b,ApolloXLII,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"You make my want to pull my hair out. No one is disagreeing with you that throwing INTs is bad for the team. My point is that you put way too much emphasis on a stat. I'd rather have a QB who is confident and makes quick decisions over a hesitant QB who is overly cautious about turning the ball over.  Phillip Rivers     31 TDs     18 INTs     93.8 QB rating  Jay Cutler         28            18            88.6  Drew Brees       33           17             97  Andy Dalton      19          17              83.5  Andrew Luck     40           16             96.5  Peyton Manning  39         15            101.5  Eli Manning        30         14            92.1  Josh McCown      11         14            70.5  Brian Hoyer        12         13            76.5  The trend among the best QBs from last year is about a 2:1 ratio of TDs to INTs. As you can see, there are garbage QBs that threw the same or less INTs than better QBs. It's all about scoring more TDs than the other team. It's a passing league and there are going to be more INTs, as the stats reflect. The only thing that matters is having the most points on the board when the game clock reaches 0:00. I want a QB that has a lot of experience at making that happen. I don't care what his stats look like or how prone he is to turnovers. Does he find ways to win? I'm in. Stat sheet superstar, never turns the ball over but finds ways to lose games? I'm out."
buccaneers,3c4d7b,LansdowneStreet,0,Sun Jul 5 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have a QB who is confident and makes quick decisions over a hesitant QB who is overly cautious about turning the ball over.   I think you're putting an awful lot of words in my mouth.  All I'm saying is he needs to learn to not try and throw the occasional pass through a defensive back, a sentiment echoed in the article.  At no point did I suggest, really, anything beyond that.  ""Gunslinger"" mentalities can submarine a team.  Even one such quarterback unquestionably going to the Hall of Fame was capable of ending his team's season with a dumb pass.  Winston needs to learn to not make crazy decisions with the football.    Understand that casting the slightest bit of doubt on a quarterback who has never played a single NFL snap is not bashing the guy, being ""out"" on the guy, or whatever.  It's nothing more than a cause for concern.  But make no mistake, it is a cause for concern.  Because the worst defense he will face in the NFL is leaps and bounds better than any defense he's faced before.    Fortunately, Winston seems to be putting his share of the work in, I'd imagine decision-making as a passer is going to be a part of that.  Never said he can't or won't learn, just that he must.   The only thing that matters is having the most points on the board when the game clock reaches 0:00. I want a QB that has a lot of experience at making that happen.   Then we're going to need to get this kid some, because as of yet he hasn't played a game in the NFL.  But I assure you, you're pulling your own hair out.  I have points of concern with Winston, that's all.  Rookies aren't supposed to be perfect, after all."

buccaneers,3c4d7b,mallen12132,-1,Sun Jul 5 19:44:42 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I read the article and agreed with the mentality.  I think ""gunslinger"" is a bad thing for a quarterback to be.  Yes, one in football history was so tremendously talented that he could overcome his inability to take care of the football, but that just underlines how rare it is to succeed when you think you're better than you really are (even when you're great).     Now we do need to keep in mind those plays take time to develop   I thought this kind of thinking is why I was being downvoted today."

Would you be cool with handing the Saints as many titles in that stretch as you got?  I can't believe people are so mad that I'd like Winston to take care of the football.  Favre was absolutely careless with his passes and as good as he was it had a habit of killing his team.

It comes with the territory of being in the NFL. No one should feel bad expressing their displeasure in the way Gilkey has played last year. Does his poor play last year reflect on the kind of person he is? Of course not. If I ever met him, I'd shake his hand, thank him, and tell him how I respect him very much as a man for the things he does for the community. I may rib him a little bit and encourage him to have an improved season, but in no way would I let his performances on a football feild have any influence in how I see him as a person."

buccaneers,3bnard,TheHornyHobbit,4,Tue Jun 30 16:25:39 2015 UTC,I'm salivating over what he can do with Evans.  He was great in his freshman year throwing only where Kelvin Benjamin could catch it.
buccaneers,3bnard,djob13,7,Tue Jun 30 17:08:04 2015 UTC,"Am I right to be nervous that he still stares down receivers the way he does? I have faith that he's our guy, but I've seen more than a dozen of these clips, and it always seems this way. I never see him going through reads. Maybe there's something I don't understand about how the plays are worked in practice, but I doubt they practice in a way that it wouldn't work in a game situation."
buccaneers,3bnard,ApolloXLII,7,Tue Jun 30 16:43:05 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have a full set of WRs to throw to in these drills. It's pretty hard not to stare down a WR when you usually only have a couple guys to throw to.  That being said, he's done a lot of work this offseason on looking away opposing CBs. Knowing your playbook and being able to read other teams' defenses goes a long way in making this skill easier, as well as gelling with your WRs.  There is too much emphasis from the fan's perspective on ""looking away CBs"" or the negative trait of staring down your receivers. Yes, it is an important tool every great QB needs to master, but it's not the be-all-end-all of being a great QB. If your QB has great timing and touch on his ball and excels at reading opposing defensive packages while having a full understanding of their playbook, then having to look away WRs trying to jump routes becomes much less needed. Hell, one good pump-fake can usually have the same effect.  Also, forgot to mention that in man coverage, you can get away with staring down a WR more than in zone coverage. But then again, if you can thread a needle with near perfect touch, you can eat up zone coverage all day every day. In these kinds of drills as posted above, there is much much more man coverage than zone."
buccaneers,3bnard,djob13,2,Tue Jun 30 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"Those are some good points. I really wasn't sure what the context of this drill was, but it's something I've seen him doing in just about every clip. That's why it's a concern to me. And I think that it's an invaluable skill if you play in having a deep game. You can get away with staring a receiver down in man coverage during short plays, and cover 2 when throwing to the outside. But if you try to throw outside of 20 yards like that, a safety or db will eat you up. And that's where we've seen his int's come from."
buccaneers,3bnard,ApolloXLII,2,Tue Jun 30 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.   Also, many of his second year INTs were because he had a significant drop in talent available to throw to at WR. His rookie year, he had a great offense around him and a guy like Kelvin Benjamin to throw to who would often be a security net. Year two, not only did he lose his safety net, his offensive unit around him as a whole got significantly worse from the previous year (that's not to say they were bad, they just weren't nearly as good anymore).   Basically what I'm trying to say is, Don't be so stuck on last year's INT total. Winston is going to have his bonehead moments this year, but you're not going to see nearly as many picks from WRs not running correct routes or being off of where they normally should be. It'll be a roller coaster to watch, but Jameis always finds a way to win. Most importantly, he'll never stop trying.  To be honest, he could throw 20 TDs and 40INTs and as long as he's getting us the wins at the end of the day, that's what counts."

buccaneers,3bjr07,Invisible_Griffin,3,Tue Jun 30 06:43:39 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunately a great point. I can see the ESPN blog headline now...  ""Jameis Winston to Legally Change Name to 'Christ'?""  You click on the article...  Jameis Winston's supporters apparently think he should. The name they've given him around Tampa is ""Jameis Christ,"" which is indicative of the expectations the city has for their new QB. Winston has yet to address the rumors. Does this mean he supports the name, or even embraces it?   His silence is speaking volumes about his attitude, and the Tampa Bay front office must act swiftly before it gets out of hand.  Sources tell me that Winston was overheard saying ""I bless you"" to a teammate who sneezed in the Florida State locker room last year. Clearly his ego has been swelling ever since winning the Heisman, and they must be extremely concerned in Tampa. No word yet on whether Jameis will be suspended for his silence on the issue..."
buccaneers,3bjr07,Napalmradio,3,Tue Jun 30 12:05:16 2015 UTC,"He's already said he doesn't like the nickname.  It was given to him in college along with, ""Black Jesus.""  Winston is very religious and doesn't like it.    That being said, people calling him that on message boards won't be a news story.  Even with how much ESPN clickbaits the shit out of people with anything Jameis related.  Now, if he changed his twitter handle to something along these lines, that would definitely hit ESPN."
buccaneers,3bjr07,Luceint3214,2,Tue Jun 30 12:25:18 2015 UTC,"He's already said he doesn't like the nickname.   I'm sorry, then why the ever-loving fuck are we using it?!  It's fucking stupid and unoriginal. It makes us sound like goddamn morons with the ""Blessed is our lord and savior QB who has come to save us from the former sins of our franchise"" mentality.

You can gripe all you want, but some people like the nickname and will use it.  If you don't want to use it, then don't.  But I think you'll be hard pressed to stop everyone from using it.    Though promoting the use of Famous Jameis or Jameis Wins-a-ton could help your cause."

buccaneers,3bjr07,IslanderBuccaneer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:20:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think Stamkos took us anywhere. Johnson, Hedman, Kucherov, Killorn were a bigger reason we got where we did. Stamkos was a fucking joke all playoffs. ""Elite scorer"" was one of the worst shooters of the entire playoffs. Not to be all ESPN and shit, but one of the dead last players in the playoffs in shot percentage. 89th. Factor in defenseman, fourth liners, etc ... To have finished second in the league in goals, that's fucking pathetic."
buccaneers,3bikg9,Numeritus,9,Mon Jun 29 14:54:03 2015 UTC,"They are talking about him being the ""X"" receiver in Koetter's offense. Can someone explain to me what does that mean? Back when I was playing football (in France, so...), the X was the slot. So I guess that's not the same thing in the NFL because Mike is not a slot receiver."
buccaneers,3bikg9,bivukaz,4,Mon Jun 29 17:22:44 2015 UTC,"The X receiver is the split end. He lines up wide on the weak side, on the line opposite the TE. The X is generally the deep threat and gets fewer targets. Think Randy Moss. The Z is your flanker. He lines up wide on the strong side, off of the line to maintain the TE's eligibility and is more of a possession receiver. Think Keyshawn Johnson. The Y is your inside slot receiver.   The Z is normally your No. 1 receiver so I find it interesting that Evans is comfirmed to be the X. That gives us some insight on how Koetter intends to use him. I have also read that VJax has been given a lot of work in the slot as the Y. I'm not entirely certain what to make of that until I can see it for myself. Since this is likely to be Jackson's last year with the team it will be interesting to see if Evans stays the X after this year. I suppose it depends on who replaces Jackson."
buccaneers,3bikg9,jaemarl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:19:12 2015 UTC,"Ok. It's weird how when i played, Your X was our Z, your Z was our Y and your Y was our X. I think my coaches had it all messed up. Thank you for your answer."
buccaneers,3bikg9,bivukaz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:25:01 2015 UTC,It may have just been the coach's preference. There is no law that dictates what terminology to use in your system. I once played for a coach that would label his flanker as F and the slot back as Z which was super confusing because I played TE and had just left a system that used a lot of Posse/11 (3 WR-1 TE-1 RB) sets where the slot receiver was labeled Y and the TE would often be labeled F for flex back. During the first weeks of camp in the new system I would look at the playbook and wonder why in the fuck the coach would want me out wide.
buccaneers,3bikg9,jaemarl,7,Tue Jun 30 08:21:40 2015 UTC,"The X is the guy who lines up on the right side of the filed. That is the #1 receiver, opposite him on the left side of the field is the ""Y"", or flanker, and the slot would be the ""Z"" receiver.  So he's moving into the #1 position this season, to do what Julio Jones has done for Atlanta the past 3 years. Lots of deep routes, screen passes, etc.   They expect to move Vincent Jackson, last years X receiver, to the ""Y"" and ""Z"" positions this year. Should be fun to watch."
buccaneers,3bikg9,Devils_-_Advocate,5,Mon Jun 29 17:59:21 2015 UTC,great explanation :)
buccaneers,3bikg9,TheButlerr,2,Mon Jun 29 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"It looks like you might have confused your Z with your Y. In nearly all modern systems it goes Z flanker, X split end, Y slot. Also the X doesn't necessarily line up on the right side, but on the weak side. Z on the strong side."
buccaneers,3bikg9,jaemarl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"Whoops, you're right, I did confuse them.   And for those wondering, the ""weak side"" that the X lines up at just means the opposite side the tight end is on. The side that the TE lines up at is called the ""strong side"", and the Z receiver on that side will be a little behind the line of scrimmage.   Maybe someone should just draw a diagram. Not it!"

buccaneers,3bikg9,bivukaz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:25:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah with the addition of Bell,  I think he is a natural Y.  This allows them to move Jackson all over the field and get him into the favorable match up. If Winston can move him in the proper formations this should be a big year for Jackson."

Like damn, the fact that 50% of the fans have hopes at all should be a victory for a QB you guys drafted. I don't mean this as in ""lolbucs"", but fans tend to lose hope if they feel like they have seen this before without success.   If you beat Tits hard week one, and I think you will. Jameis gonna want revenge from the CFB playoffs, and your team is better overall on both sides. This probably becomes 75% likeability.   Give it a few more good games during the season and your gonna see Vikings and Raiders level hype in the fanbase.   Also gonna help that CFB season starts again, so that FSU fields a new QB and he loses some of the ""FSU's QB"" smell."

buccaneers,3bbuh0,djob13,9,Sat Jun 27 19:23:14 2015 UTC,"Not here.  Jameis Winston has a big challenge ahead of him coming into the 2015-2016 NFL Season. We all know about his off the field issues and there is no room for that in the NFL. At just 21 years old, there are a lot of distractions that can keep Winston’s mindset off the field. Let’s hope he can avoid these distractions because Winston has a tremendous amount of talent and potential and can become a premier quarterback in the NFL. Jameis had an outstanding two-year college career winning the Heisman Trophy and a National Title, but the big question is whether he can translate that into a successful professional career?  Jameis Winston could very well end up being another JaMarcus Russell who excelled in college but did not pan out in the NFL. I do not think that this will be the case however. Winston has shown his maturity with the media during his combine and his Pro Day regarding his prior mistakes he made in college and how he will move on. He is determined to prove his critics wrong and show them why he was right to be the first overall pick.  Winston has already made it clear that he wants to lose weight and try to “get back skinny” during the off-season. He currently weighs around 238 pounds and says he wants to get around what he weighed during his freshman year at Florida State which was 230 pounds. Jameis has an NFL quarterback body at 6 ft 4 in and if he can slim down, he will excel as a pocket passer and will be able to move better while outside the pocket.  Ben Roethlisberger is someone who Winston draws a lot of comparisons to. As an extremely commanding pocket passer, Winston has shown his ability to find his targets with ease while being pressured. His accuracy and football IQ is off the charts for a player his age which will make him succeed in Tampa Bay for many years to come. Winston has a solid receiving corps to throw to, with Vincent Jackson and 2nd year sensation Mike Evans leading the way. Him and Evans will click this year and be a very deadly tandem. Also having a young tight end in Austin Seferian-Jenkins as a big red zone target will lead to a very successful offense. With 24 year-old running back Charles Sims showing promise last season, there will be relieved pressure for Winston when he decides to throw the ball. This offense is very promising on paper, and Winston is the right guy to lead them to success.  Winton’s college career definitely helps his case for being a successful quarterback in the NFL. As a freshman in 2013, he threw for 4057 yds and 40 TD with only 10 INT. He led his team to an undefeated season and a national championship that year. Winston became the youngest person to win the Heisman Trophy in 2013. In 2014, Jameis threw for 3907 yds and 25 TD with 18 INT. That year, Florida State lost to Oregon in the Rose Bowl ending Winston’s college career. It was certainly a college career to remember considering he only lost once as a starter over the course of his two years. Jameis Winston entered the 2015 NFL Draft and was selected 1st overall by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Now we await what could be a very thrilling NFL career.  Jameis Winston will be an instant impact fantasy player this year and should be drafted around the 7th or 8th round. He will be a steal if you pick him this early because not many people will be thinking of reaching for him. Trust me, he will not let you down. I believe Winston will struggle a little at first, just like most rookies, but will find his groove. I think he will throw for nearly 3000 yds and 20 TDs while keeping his interception count under 15. The pressure that comes in his rookie year will not phase him and he will be able to excel. Jameis Winston is ready to shine in the NFL and I truly believe he is going to be a top 15 fantasy QB next season.  Let the journey of Jameis Winston begin."

buccaneers,3b7eyq,SkardHard,3,Sat Jun 27 00:12:08 2015 UTC,"It always saddened me that Rice never got any love...  NEVER!  He and Sapp real tore up the league.  The thing that always gets me too is that without the other neither of them would have been as good as they were.  You had Sapp tearing up the middle and then you bring in help which frees up Rice.  It was beautiful.  Our defense should have gotten more love than it ever will either.  The fact that Atlanta tore up the league rushing when Vick hit the scene yet we played them twice a year and held them I could swear to under 100 yards often rushing was amazing.  Brooks was also an integral part of our defense...   Damn man anyone on that D was just a perfect piece to the puzzle.  The only thing you could do is run play action and throw little outs to the backs or straight muscle it up the middle.  Either way it really was a ""bend but don't break"".  If we would have had an offense we would have been a dynasty."

buccaneers,3b2swx,Cyoplasm,6,Thu Jun 25 14:42:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know that they've picked a rb1 really yet. They've said that both Sims and Martin are looking really good in camp, but I mean it's camp so it's tough to really judge them. With us having 5 rbs at the moment though I'm think we'll run a rbbc until one guy shows he can take a bigger load of work.  I'm no fantasy guru but I'd avoid our guys unless they slip to the 3rd/4th round somehow."
buccaneers,3b2swx,spideralex90,3,Thu Jun 25 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, they're slipping beyond that man. ADP for both Sims and Doug are around 7-9th. That's why I ask if anything has shaken out or if there are any strong feelings towards Sims/Doug. A RBBC sucks, if so."
buccaneers,3b2swx,Devils_-_Advocate,5,Thu Jun 25 16:07:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard diddley about Simms. He was a major disappointment last year after being rushed back from surgery. He needs to go undrafted, imo.  Bobby Rainy is our best back on the roster as of now, and I still wouldn't draft him until the 9th maybe. However, Martin is said to be having the best offseason of his career, and he's in a contract year.. so he's poised to do better. I'd take a flyer on Doug in the 6-7th if he's still there, I wouldn't pick any other RB from our team though.   Evans... he's gonna have a good year."
buccaneers,3b2swx,Devils_-_Advocate,3,Thu Jun 25 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"If I pick top of the draft, I will take Evans late 2nd early 3rd, and will stay away from Doug. If I don't get Evans, I may look at Doug in the late rounds. Despite his down year, I would take him again if I got him in the later rounds to fill my bench. Never underestimate a man in a contract year."
buccaneers,3b2swx,djlenin89,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"Never underestimate a man in a contract year.   That's the wildcard man. Hell, last year I got AP with the 6th overall pick.

buccaneers,3b2swx,jackmon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:16:26 2015 UTC,"Ah I haven't been keeping tabs on fantasy stuff in the off season. They might be worth looking at that late for depth, Martin is in a contract year and needs to do well so he can get re-signed, or be valuable enough for a trade."
buccaneers,3b2swx,MarleyandtheWhalers,2,Thu Jun 25 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"I preached this all over /r/fantasyfootball last year and I'll probably end up preaching it again.  Picking ff RBs is all about offensive line and opportunities.  I think both of those are going to be iffy for the Bucs RBs again this year, despite their individual talent.  Hopefully Smith and Marpet can help the line, but it's far from certain.  And it's also unclear if RBs will be commitee-based.  I  would stay away from our RBs personally."

buccaneers,3axwcu,Indyboy,3,Wed Jun 24 11:29:04 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why Warhop wasn't shown the door, that offensive line group was horrid last season.  Dirk may not be too exciting but at least we'll have a decent offensive coordinator instead of a qb coach trying his hand at that position.  Overall I feel like we can grow a lot as a team and have a much better season this year. There are plenty of things hinging on new guys working out which isn't super comforting, but I have hope for this year."
buccaneers,3axwcu,spideralex90,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:05:40 2015 UTC,The reason Warhop wasn't shown the door is simple :   You can't make chicken salad out of chicken shit . Name me the O-line coach who is going to make Garrett Gilkey great .
buccaneers,3axwcu,BucJason,3,Mon Jun 29 11:23:32 2015 UTC,"I think with a new qb, as well as some OL rookies having an OC that is proven is better than risking on an OC that is not (even if they might have a higher upside). The thing is if we failed with our OC jire that might set Winston back a lot."
buccaneers,3axwcu,Fyresand,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:54:03 2015 UTC,The thing is if we failed with our OC jire that might set Winston back a lot.   Agreed. Likewise it would be a god damned nightmare if we had to deal with a young developing QB that constantly has a revolving door for OC's. I think that is why Alex Smith was able to reach his full potential in SF. I pray that does not happen with Ole' 3.
buccaneers,3axwcu,mothershipq,3,Wed Jun 24 21:16:38 2015 UTC,I have us at 6 wins we'll have several losing streaks
buccaneers,3axwcu,Zombones,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"This is probably accurate. For me its always been in the 5-7 range. Anything worse I'll be disappointed, anything better, and I'll be ecstatic."
buccaneers,3axwcu,MeVicCar,3,Fri Jun 26 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"My causes for concern:  -I don't trust college football one bit as a feeder system to the NFL.  So while I recognize Jameis Winston's immense potential, I will believe it when I actually see it.  Against NFL defenses.  It is hard for me to imagine, though, that any rookie will be as good as some people seem to expect Winston will be.  -I don't like our DEs.  We could have done better at that position and I think we might live to regret it.  -ASJ needs to actually get the football abilities to go along with his Ben Coates body.  -We need one of our four safeties to emerge as a solid player, and another to be serviceable.  I don't know who that would be.  -Our punting game sucked last year and that matters a lot.  Especially on a team where the defense is going to have to pick up the offense's slack, field position is important.  How Michael Koenen is still there is beyond me.  Reasons for optimism:  -Our defense could make The Leap next year.  Alterraun Verner looked comfortable in our zones, and Johnthan Banks came around in a big way late in the season.  Bruce Carter at MLB should help a ton, and Lavonte David could still get better.    -There are three members of our offense who have experience playing with a very good quarterback.  Winston might get a lot of guidance from Vincent Jackson, Logan Mankins, and Evan Smith, and that could go a very long way toward taking a college football player and making him a pro.  -I'm bullish on Bobby Rainey:  Football Utility Man.  If no kick/punt returner emerges, he could go back to being a running back/returner/punt coverage gunner.    -I too believe in Lovie Smith.  And while I'm not so sold on Koetter, I at least expect him to show up, which is worlds better than the man he's replacing.  Bottom line:  If I lived near Vegas I'd be putting some money on Lavonte David for DPOY.  8-8 would be about right.  Getting better, but there's still stuff to work out on both offense and defense.  Team MVP:  Lavonte David."
buccaneers,3axwcu,LansdowneStreet,2,Wed Jun 24 21:54:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of this but something I'd like to mention. When we first got Bruce Carter I was pretty ecstatic, I was all ""Hell yeah! Our linebacking core this year looks insane now!"" But the more I look into Carter the more worried I am. He seems like he has his moments but in the same sense he has his issues as well(don't we all.) My point being that as much as I feel that Carter can be an asset to us I still have some serious doubts about his consistency and his play overall. I'm hoping Lovie can take him and shape him into a serious threat for our defense if anything."
buccaneers,3axwcu,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"His big problems come against the run game.  Now I adore the running game, but I'm going to tell you something that depresses the shit out of me:  For now, the running game is dead.  Especially in our division, where Sean Payton talks about how he always wants to run the ball but never does.  And where Cam Newton is a running quarterback that runs just enough to put the ball in the air.  And where the Falcons' best running back is part-owner Warrick Dunn.  What we need is an MLB that doesn't see a play-action and think ""it's definitely a run"" every time.  That's what Mason Foster did, and Mason Foster was a disaster area for us at MLB.  Larry English too.  Neither of them were willing to stay in coverage like you're supposed to in variations of Tampa Two.  Whereas Carter will stay in coverage to a fault.  If we get beat on the ground we get beat on the ground.  But you and I both know that nobody in the NFCS is smart enough or devoted enough to actually commit to taking the ball out of the Almighty Quarterback's hand long enough to do that."
buccaneers,3axwcu,SirBuzzKillingtonIV,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:27:02 2015 UTC,"I'm worried about our o-line first, not only protecting Winston but creating a running game. I want to see starters of smith-mankins-smith-marpet-Dotson, but it seems marpet isn't ready.  Second our D-end pass rush. I'm encouraged by smith and Charles Johnson, but beyond that it's not looking too great. Hopefully William golston steps up this season.  Lastly I'm worried about our safeties, I do not want conte as a starter. I'm hoping its mcdougal and swearinger back there and not a mess like last season. Not worried about Winston, he's a rookie and will play like a rookie at times so I'm not expecting Andrew luck right away.   Excited to see our receiving corps it looks really strong. I think our rbs are good too if they see any holes. I love our interior D-line and it should be a league best. I feel good about our corner depth. Linebackers should be improved and curious to see how carter plays in the middle."

buccaneers,3ap959,Wadep00l,2,Mon Jun 22 13:33:28 2015 UTC,I'm hoping Kenny Bell has a big rookie year. He could end up being a great value for us. Also I hope ASJ and Jameis have a good connection this year.
buccaneers,3ap959,spideralex90,2,Mon Jun 22 14:04:41 2015 UTC,I just going to mention Bell. He's going to be open a lot this year I expect.

buccaneers,3apfis,Itorr475,5,Mon Jun 22 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"Kinda puts a different perspective on the whole ""Johnny Football"" deal last year. Here is Mike Evans, probably the top WR of the draft, and all everyone wants to ask him is how Johnny Football was."

buccaneers,3ao52l,impactplayer,8,Mon Jun 22 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"See, I actually took it a different way - the receiver, Rodney, who just signed with the Dolphins, was told by The Rock that he ""had been traded before"", which leans one to believe he was on another team prior to his time with the Packers (who cut him in the episode). He's also a part of some dialogue where it is mentioned that he and the fictional Bucs OL had previously gotten a ring together - So, it is not out of the realm of possibility, that two of the main characters of this show were a part of a Bucs team that had recently won a Super Bowl - and I think that's pretty rad.  Either way, thought it was a great show, and I'll definitely continue watching it."

buccaneers,3akb7f,Nick_named_Nick,6,Sun Jun 21 01:53:54 2015 UTC,Buccaneers Summer Youth Football Clinic. My daughter's school holds a fundraiser every year selling Bucs tickets. If you sell a certain amount you're invited to participate.

At least I think it is? Me and my friend walked right in on a Friday practice before the 30th anniversary eagles game a few years ago.  Then we waited by the exit for the players to drive out, and we met Lynch, VJax, Freeman, EJ Biggers, and Scott Smith lol. Oh and Sapp was stopped at the light right at the exit of One Buc. He looked over at us with a look of utter disgust and shook his head 'no'. We didn't even approach his car but he did enough in those 15 seconds to warrant the claims that he's a nasty scumbag.   Flip side, John Lynch is one of the nicest dudes ever. Signed my hat and everything."

buccaneers,3ajh75,TheGoobatron,5,Sat Jun 20 21:14:32 2015 UTC,"I second this.  Brocato's isn't quite a shack.. it's more like a series of shacks that have been duct taped together.  But if you show up right at lunch time, the line will be out the door, and there will be no place to sit.  Phenomenal Cuban food. The deviled crab is ridiculously good."

buccaneers,3ajh75,spideralex90,4,Sat Jun 20 22:01:28 2015 UTC,Go to Taco Bus if you like Taco's. There's a few in Tampa. I go any time I can when I go to Tampa.

buccaneers,3ajh75,ballinben,3,Mon Jun 22 13:22:07 2015 UTC,The beaches and Busch Gardens are awesome.. What kind of food are you looking for?
buccaneers,3ajh75,IndecisionGuy,2,Sat Jun 20 22:06:15 2015 UTC,Preferably seafood or Cuban. Open to any suggestions though really.
buccaneers,3ajh75,refrigeratorbob,3,Sat Jun 20 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"For really good seafood in a very, very casual atmosphere, don't forget Shell's which is just a couple miles south of the stadium on Dale Mabry Hwy. (next door to the Press Box - cool sports bar). Great sandwiches, keep going south a bit to Wright's Gourmet.  Do you like cake?  Wright's is where to get dessert in Tampa. Cuban food? Where to begin.. Near the stadium is a great little hole-in-the-wall place called Arco Iris on Columbus drive.. keep driving a mile or so east and you get to La Teresita - also awesome. Want a fancy sit-down Cuban place - go further east to the Columbia Restaraunt in Ybor City.  Or even futher to Brocato's, as we've discussed."

buccaneers,3ajh75,BucJason,2,Sat Jun 20 21:26:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the different places and ideas! Much appreciated. Anybody have a favorite bar? Preferably that has local beers on draft?
buccaneers,3ajh75,Red_Pan-Duh,2,Sat Jun 20 22:03:10 2015 UTC,"Yes and he should go to the Cigar City Brew Pub on Dale Mabry . Great place to go if you are visiting from out of town . Local craft beer and great food with a Cuban flare. The atmosphere is great too , beer barrel chandeliers hanging over the bar for example."

buccaneers,3ajh75,schroepnuts,2,Sun Jun 21 04:38:02 2015 UTC,"Columbia Restaurant in Ybor city. Historic beautiful restaurant that's been there since 1905. Good Spanish/Cuban food too.   It's a must if you are a tourist. Then you can check out some of the bars and nightlife on 7th Ave ( same street as restaurant).  For Seafood: Dockside Dave's (two locations in Madeira Beach and St. Pete ) Best and biggest fresh Grouper sandwich you will have in your entire life. I can't describe why it is so much better than any other grouper sandwich , you just have to see for yourself."

Mankins is there on reputation alone; he was better towards the end of the last season, but eh."
buccaneers,3aj4gh,CanuckPanda,6,Sat Jun 20 20:45:26 2015 UTC,Hmm he's actually played RT for the last 2 years at least and I don't believe he is changing positions either...
buccaneers,3aj4gh,FEO4,6,Sat Jun 20 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"Do you even watch the games? Dotson is a RT, has been his entire career. Only moved to LT towards the end of last season because Anthony Collins was garbage as fuck."

buccaneers,3a8ar5,trudatness,3,Thu Jun 18 11:59:35 2015 UTC,"The new nickname needs to be earned, as far as I'm concerned.  He was 220 of muscle in his rookie year.  He had to work to slim down to 210 this season.  That tells me that for whatever reason (I'm thinking injury prevented him from getting his necessary work) he lost muscle and gained fat - thus why he lost power and explosion from his game.  Remember, he broke over 40 tackles and was second only to AP in that stat that year.  Last year, he only broke a fraction of tackles in comparison.  If I'm Doug Martin, for the next 6 weeks everyday is leg day - so he can come into camp ready to be the player Bucs need him to be.  Sounds like he's already trimmed and leaned up like he needed to - now he needs to add back that 10 lbs of muscle he's lost.  In order to enter beast mode - you first got to be a beast.  If he can be the player he was in his rookie season - it would be a monumental lift for the team."

buccaneers,3a6ilw,trudatness,11,Wed Jun 17 20:02:29 2015 UTC,Ehhhhhhhh in my opinion Moffitt fucked up and retired just when Seattle was about to turn it on. That being said he's 28 id rather spend some cap and get Evans just so Winston can stand upright and we will have some depth. Pay Evans $7mil and plug D3 at guard and center as needed.

buccaneers,3a7vot,mothershipq,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:07:38 2015 UTC,"The safest best I think as of right now in June is Mike Evans, and Vincent Jackson. Evans could be a nice snag in the 3-4th round (assuming it's a ten person snake). He could serve as a nice number two, or flex assuming Winston, and ole' 13 develop together.  Vackson aka Mr. Consistent could be a solid pick later in the draft, but I'd pump the breaks before making him a week one starter. He has slowed down a bit, but 4 seasons in a row with 1000+ yards receiving make him a solid pick.  I am excited that I'll have the opportunity to have some Bucs on my team this year for real."

Think of how many times you've seen this headline already; on Reddit, on Pewter Report, on JoeBucsfan, almost everywhere just because he said ""explode,"" since t hat's the only thing quoted about the interview. Now, if he doesn't have a great season, it looks worse for then if he just left it at what he had said originally...""""I'm tired of hearing 'potential — I want to live up to that potential and establish myself""..Plain and simple.

buccaneers,39xkcb,trudatness,6,Mon Jun 15 16:51:35 2015 UTC,"This is partially why I believe kenny bell, in this offense, can be productive as a 3rd receiver.  He's not a traditional slot like welker.  From what I understand (I never really watched him in college), he made his impact on outside routes.  Well, in koetter's offense, the 3rd receiver runs a lot of outside routes.  Think of harry douglass.  You never saw that guy catch a pass that was less than 15 yards downfield.  Lots of 15-yd hitches.  Lots of deep sweeps over the middle.  I would be curious to ask the guy about Tony gonzales' roll, though.  Because I tend to remember him running a lot of under patterns and 5 yard routes -- maybe empty sets where he's the valve?  Anyway, this should be encouraging for 2 reasons.  1)  we have receivers who excel in downfield plays and 2) we have a quarterback who seems to be fairly proficient at airing it out.  But, the main concern, of course, is the offensive line, right?  This is a system that puts even more stress on them.  I see a lot of safety valve work while our line gets better.  Charles sims will have 60+ receptions this year."
buccaneers,39xkcb,NeonSubtlety,3,Mon Jun 15 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"I like Kenny Bell as well - also think of his ability to block downfield.  The big block we all drooled over on youtube looks like it was on a 4 vert type play where Bell came back from a go route to lay wood on a guy.  However, Bell is a fifth round guy and the reason he fell so far was because (allegedly) his route running abilities were considered to be raw.  He could be one of those guys to benefit from a year of depth chart seasoning.  Either way, I think its now pretty much a moot point, because they brought Wright back.  I'm thinking many of those 4 vert pass plays will have VJax, Evans and two tight ends - where you'll see a heavy dose of ASJ, Wright, Myers and even some of Stocker.  Lastly, we've been reading about Koetter liking Doug Martin.  Figure him to get many of those check downs and that 60+ receptions number over Sims.  Its early yet though, RB battle in TC is going to be on."
buccaneers,39xkcb,BucJason,3,Mon Jun 15 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"Louis Murphy can handle the job while Kenny Bell learns.  I have a feeling Koetter's stint here will be short anyways. If Winston is half as good as hyped , Koetter is gonna look real good , and have a HC gig soon."

buccaneers,39mj6l,Steezewell,7,Fri Jun 12 20:08:27 2015 UTC,Stocker is useless. Show him the door and let Wright slip right in.
buccaneers,39mj6l,joy4874,8,Fri Jun 12 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"That is difficult issue, I know a lot of fans don't think he is great. However, I think he is a useful blocking TE and I'm interested to see how Koetter uses him in our rotation."
buccaneers,39mj6l,Steezewell,9,Fri Jun 12 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"True. To be fair I will say he is a good blocking TE. I would just prefer (especially with the way successful teams are utilizing their tight ends as receivers now) that the Bucs break from the traditional personnel mold of ""2 WRs, Slot WR, RB,"" etc. Koetter did utilize Tony Gonzalez a lot when he was there, so I'm hoping he can spread it out and bring that style to Tampa. This offense needs as many weapons as it can for Jameis. And by implementing another 6-5 tower in ASJ, as well as even possibly Tim Wright in certain 2 TE sets, you can certainly exploit mismatches a lot more efficiently. Specifically, when teams assume they're going to run with a 2 TE set and instead break off the line and get open against a slower LB or smaller Safety playing up in the box."
buccaneers,39mj6l,joy4874,3,Fri Jun 12 20:24:24 2015 UTC,He spent most of last year playing fullback which is why you didn't hear his name much.
buccaneers,39mj6l,Congzilla,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:35:40 2015 UTC,"When Stocker played well he was in a makeshift FB role. Which, was his best fit so far with the team. If Iosefa does well for Tampa, I see Stocker as only playing on ST."

As for thus year, Mankins may still be as bad as last year and NE still will have our 4th and we may have added a guy to our roster whose not good enough to excel at TE, WR, or STs."

buccaneers,39mj6l,dumbassniggashit,8,Fri Jun 12 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"Could the Bucs potentially use him as a depth receiver rather than the second TE, given that he's not much of a blocker?"
buccaneers,39mj6l,LansdowneStreet,2,Fri Jun 12 20:38:57 2015 UTC,If he makes the team it's gonna be in a swing role. His versatility & TD ability is what will put him on the roster vs. Meyers/Stocker
buccaneers,39mj6l,anarchyisutopia,2,Sat Jun 13 02:24:31 2015 UTC,He was listed as a receiver the last year he played for us.

We need depth on the line, and we need time for our young guys to develope. Start Evan and have a rotation. Also we have no guarantee that any of our rookie linemen are starter material, this would put those fear to rest. It is more important to protect Jameis than have rookie linemen get every snap."

Here's the caveat:   Mathis had been due to make $5.5 million in 2015 and $6 million in 2016.   Edit: I spoke too soon. Mathis has veteran status in the league, so technically he doesn't go through waivers. He just becomes a free agent, which means any team can sign him to a new contract. Still, you would think the Bucs have to be in the running for this guy  So the Bucs would have to pay out his current contract if we were to claim him, but god damn we have the cap space and the need for more bodies on the Oline. It's a shame Mathis plays guard, or our Dotson situation could be solved real quick"

But it's more like pizza.  If you don't eat it all, it'll keep for a year in the refrigerator.  Some cap space rolls over.  So just using it to use it is often a bad idea.  let's be smart and use the money on someone who will still be useful 3 years down the road.  I'm hungry."
buccaneers,39hoo6,Steezewell,2,Thu Jun 11 20:27:29 2015 UTC,"I agree you save the cap space for wise moves down the road, but if you have excess then there's a floor to this equation too (nice food analogy btw).  We have $20 million this year. Let's give Dotson a raise and give him $4mil, how much does Mathis want? Realistically 6 max? We have $8-10 million left.  Next year we have whopping $57 million in cap space, so if we don't extend Lavonte this year you know it will happen next. That kid isn't playing for another team, I'll cry it if happens.

buccaneers,39hoo6,trudatness,3,Thu Jun 11 20:47:42 2015 UTC,"When did I say we should cut him? I said it wouldn't matter at all, meaning he can sit out as long as he wants while someone else plays in his spot until he finally gives in and plays, or sits the entire season. But I guess the term ""Good"" is subjective when you're part of one of the worst offensive lines in the league, as well as have trouble with penalty's. But while I'm on the subject, I don't really think last years performance puts you in a position to be making contractual demands.   To be fair though, I will say he did perform well over the last half of the season, and he is probably our best blocker on the line (which isn't saying much) however he didn't play well enough to warrant a raise when your unit is ranked 26th in pass-protection, and 25th overall in the league."

buccaneers,39gizd,lazybrouf,4,Thu Jun 11 15:53:39 2015 UTC,I think a big reason is I can't really recall many times anyone got the ball with any kind of open space. I think with a OC this year we can maybe have some better plays that allow for YAC
buccaneers,39gizd,Fyresand,5,Thu Jun 11 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"The issue is also that our receiving core isn't necessarily built for YAC, but for winning the 50/50 balls more consistently than other teams"
buccaneers,39gizd,SirRaava,3,Thu Jun 11 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"I think this could be partly attributed to our yards/attempt stat, in which McCown had 6.75 which was 31st in the league last season, and Glennon was even worst. Passes downfield put receivers behind the defense, in more open space and hopefully giving them a lane down the sideline which can often give atleast 10-15 extra YAC. The fact that our top two players in YAC are running backs (even though the top two in the NFL are running backs, but regardless) just shows that there's too many passes short down the field, keeping the ball in front of the defense where they can make a tackle near the line of scrimmage. I think a QB who's more of a gunslinger like Winston should open space up for WR's to make plays downfield."
buccaneers,39gizd,ballinben,3,Thu Jun 11 17:13:55 2015 UTC,Great QB's help with yac also by hitting guys in stride and on time .  We didn't have that QB.
buccaneers,39gizd,BucJason,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:53:19 2015 UTC,"I think there are a multitude of reasons why we are bad at YAC but I am going to generalize here and say we sucked in almost every metric the NFL has last year. I think the only stat we were good at was not allowing 40+ yard plays and that was due to Goldson who we have now gotten rid of. Not having a good YAC (either after catch or contact) is endemic of this team. We were simply bad at everything. Everybody's production was down including our 'superstars' VJax, McCoy, and David compared to 2013.  Schiano scared us and now we have withdrawn into a shell of comfortable familiarity. We have boring coaches and boring players playing boring football. We talk excitedly about being average and maybe, just maybe, going 8-8 this year if we are lucky. We are at the bottom of the basement for NFL teams. Stats like this is what we have across the board. We have a long way to go to be competitive and I am not seeing much effort to get us there. What I am seeing is a long stretch towards mediocrity."

buccaneers,39e13e,Fyresand,5,Thu Jun 11 06:08:33 2015 UTC,"I thought each pick had a set contract because of the CBA? Every contract is set up by where you are picked I think. Sure its not an exact set-in-stone contract, there is leeway for both sides, but i don't think it was enough to have him not sign.   Maybe it has something to do with Demar Dotson?

buccaneers,396yz4,93pfo,26,Tue Jun 9 18:27:59 2015 UTC,"All time greats definitely includes Derrick Brooks (one of the best ever at his position), John Lynch (watch his highlights if you want to see what hard hitting looked like before the league changed - and why they needed to change it) and Ronde Barber. Also look up Lee Roy Selmon, our very first pick and a HoF'er.  Current good players to watch are Gerald McCoy  Lavonte David, Mike Evans, with a handful up and comers and of course Winston.  What do you need to know? Well we build our success on defense, historically we simply don't do offense well, especially the whole QB and WR thing. We are the worst team in the league (by last season and in history) but we got a badass ship in our stadium, we love our team even if they run around with clockradio numbers and this coming season will be really fucking exciting for better or worse.

buccaneers,396yz4,IckyWilbur,6,Tue Jun 9 19:01:36 2015 UTC,"Forgot about Lynch loved watching him! One of my arguments on r/NFL was that the Bucs lost 8 games by a score and people were down voting me for saying it is reasonable to believe that if Winston has a rookie season like Wilson, Luck or RGIII that the Bucs could contend for the NFCS. And yes the firing the cannons and ship is badass! I wish the hawks nest at the clink was built like an actual nest. Who would you say is the main rival or is it just the entire division?"

We usually dislike the Falcons and Saints big time but they have been ignoring us for a while because well... we've sucked for a while now (outside of 2010). Now the Panthers are all high and mighty as well so they have a three way brawl with the main rivalry probably being between the Saints and Falcons both gunning to take down the first repeat champion in the NFCS down (Panthers) with us just waving from the bottom of the mountain and eating glue.

I watched a lot of FSU games and there were times when he willed his team to victory, Cam seems to give up and look defeated at times unlike Jameis, who is a natural leader and is really clutch. Also with targets like Mike Evens, Vincent Jackson, ASJ and Bell in the slot the Bucs could be an offensive machine. Bell is very underrated cause he was in a run heavy offense with poor quarterback play from Taylor Martinez and Tommy Armstrong, I watched him in person for the past 3 years."

buccaneers,396yz4,Sh-t_Shower_Shave,3,Tue Jun 9 20:13:30 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that Sapp is the best football player by far that we had.  He changed games all by himself.  He could shut down offenses before they started.  We all were blessed to be able to watch him play.  Simply amazing to watch.  As far as the all around best Buccaneer, Brooks hands down.  He had longevity, is a better person, more fan friendly, was a Leader/General on and off the field.  He was greatness.  Lil story: I think during the Bucs/Lions playoff game around 96 at the old stadium I remember Sapp skipping around the whole field and kicking down all the orange goal line posts.  A 300 lbs guy skipping and being an lil ass was pretty funny to a teenager.  He really enjoyed playing football.  They shut down a top 5 RB to ever play the game that night too. Barry Sanders. Wow."

He stoped near me and this little kid walked up to him, only to shake his hand it seems and he litterally yelled at the kid and his dad.  The kid cried. He could not have been any older than 7 or 8.  It was at that moment that I had a completly distane for him as a person.   He is an excellent player no doubt, but all the stories I have heard about people meeting him, or getting to talk to him all say he is a jackass.

buccaneers,396yz4,bivukaz,5,Wed Jun 10 14:46:06 2015 UTC,"Yo, welcome to the club bro, we are more than welcome to have ya!  First of all, Derrick Brooks is more than a man in Tampa, that dude is revered like a god. Him, Ronde Barber and Alstott are the golden boys of Tampa and continue to contribute to the community in a big way to this day. They will all be HoFs and Tampa loves them.   Secondly, our team will never be elite because Tampa is just too god damn fun. Before the playoffs last year there was an article in the NYT talking about how the packers play settlers of Catan, because there is fucking nothing else to do in Green Bay. This keeps people focused on football and therefore makes a good team.   Have you seen the women in Tampa??  Good god man, how anyone can stay from the beach in January is a crazy thought. Florida is so god damn amazing in the fall and winter, we have everything. Tampa is just too interesting of a town to facilitate an elite football team for too long, we are too distracting. Tampa is fucking awesome, I completely understand why you can't spend all your time thinking about work that time of year."

buccaneers,396yz4,bivukaz,3,Tue Jun 9 19:05:44 2015 UTC,"What do I need to know about the franchise?   A few bullet points: -The Buccaneers' first seasons are a story that is usually left incomplete.  Yes, they lost their first 26 games.  They also came damn close to making a Super Bowl two seasons after that, with the same coach and many of the same players. -Pretty much all of the ""miserable Bucs history"" before the mid-90s can be attributed solely to one man:  Hugh Culverhouse.  It's a miracle the Bucs are still in Tampa Bay after his tenure as owner. -However good you think Ronde Barber was, he was better than that. -Much of the philosophy on which Pete Carroll and his assistants have built Seattle's defense came directly from Monte Kiffin, co-creator of the ""Tampa 2"" set.  So our Super Bowl very heavily contributed to yours. -For a real Bucs fan experience, you have to pick a side:  Tony Dungy or Jon Gruden?  That isn't to say you have to hate the other guy, but there's a debate there that is quite definitely the Bucs fan's version of Picard vs. Kirk.     my favorite player Brett Favre   Oooh, you might want to fix that if you're going to enjoy Buccaneers football.  Favre is one of our chief villains, ever.  The others: -The Andy Reid/Donovan McNabb Eagles -Currently Drew Brees and his Saints -Early 2000s Julius Peppers, and for odd reasons, punter Todd Sauerbrun.  (He feuded with Martin Gramatica.  And took steroids.) -Personally I'm going to go a very long time before I forgive Chip Kelly for backing out on us."

buccaneers,396yz4,strikeoutlookin,2,Wed Jun 10 00:06:45 2015 UTC,"I know plenty of people who have 2nd teams in multiple sports. For example one of my best friends grew up in Denver and moved to Seattle in middle school and has spent equal time in both places. In SB 48 he didn't care who won really. Back when Favre was still playing I followed the Packers/Jets/Vikings cause Favre was my childhood hero. I have two teams for CFB, UW my hometown team and Nebraska a team I watched in person for 3 years. And they are part of the reason I am following the Bucs with Lavonte David, Kenny Bell and ASJ, I mean am I not allowed to like a team because it features some of my favorite college players? I don't care for the NBA or MLB, I would care for the NHL if Seattle had a team. I only watch CFB, NFL and UFC. I get this could piss off some hard core fans but I just love football and having another team to follow is fun! It is the exact same thing when I followed Favre. Having another team to follow is another reason to get excited for Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays."

Your comment tries to take away the success that Rivers and Gates have had together in their careers. Not saying that that's what you were trying to say, but that's how I read it.   ASJ imo is closer comparing to Gates than to Gronk or Graham. He doesn't destroy defenders when they try to tackle him, he just does his job. I'm not saying that he can't be great, but to hope for him to be at the levels of either of those 3 guys is insane."

It also said it's probably over optimistic to consider marpet starting over him at the beginning of the season at least. So I would consider that statement means Gilkey is ahead of him to start.

Gilkey is not on pace to start.  We're just serious about making our rookies earn their spot.

buccaneers,393jgc,Sauce_Master,3,Wed Jun 10 23:14:38 2015 UTC,Watching this game you realize how good Jon Gruden was as an offensive coach - and how bad the offensive scheme was last year for Tampa.  Not just that Gruden had an offensive game plan - but he utilized his players' strengths and tailored the attack to account for the Eagles.  We didn't see anything like that last year.  It was vanilla as vanilla gets.  Hopefully Koetter takes a page out of Gruden's book and mixes and matches it up depending on the opponent.  You just can't lineup and just be single minded about your guys - you have to understand the matchups.

buccaneers,3960te,SirRaava,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:48:34 2015 UTC,Kwon was drafted to play MLB for us. Nobody in their right minds expects us to not keep David. All our FO talks about is how he's the best OLB in the game
buccaneers,3960te,Fyresand,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"He would have to put on some weight to play at middle linebacker, his best fit is where David plays. I do think the Buccaneers will keep him, but Alexander still won't move inside, he'll just play as a backup. As noted in the article, I do not expect him to be David's replacement."
buccaneers,3960te,Fyresand,3,Tue Jun 9 15:43:48 2015 UTC,Kwon is going to play SLB if he does get play time (they said it already on the multiple interviews). They might try to switch him to MLB if Carter does not work as we hope with his switch.

This was the moment I knew we had something special with Lavonte.   It wasn't a big hit, he just closes so fast and his tackle is just overwhelming, there isn't a struggle, the ball carrier is just tackled immediately. There isn't a single wasted motion, just closes distance, defeats player. It's robotic and brutally effective. To see that kind of a holy shit, wtf? play in a preseason game was amazing."

buccaneers,38pm9s,fletch420man,9,Fri Jun 5 20:00:31 2015 UTC,"No player wants to spend the second half of their great career on a shitty team, especially coming from a team that only had marginal success. Great players want to play for great teams and great WRs want great QBs throwing to them.  Vincent Jackson is excited for the future as a Buc because he knows Jameis Winston is the real deal. If we drafted Mariota and Jackson said the same thing then I would be saying the saying the same thing as well. No dis on Mariota who seems to be doing good things in Tennessee so far, but I think we hit a home run on our first round pick."

buccaneers,38pm9s,TrueBuccaneersFan,-9,Sat Jun 6 10:27:53 2015 UTC,"Of course he does, because his current contract overpays the shit out of him."
buccaneers,38pm9s,BucJason,9,Sat Jun 6 00:04:39 2015 UTC,"How so? He would be a number 1 WR on most teams in the league and is getting paid number 1 WR money. He's 4th among WRs on average salary. in 2013 he made less than $1M. In 2015 he's making $9.7M. Yeah, one could argue he makes more than what his production has been, but not that much. It also doesn't help when your terrible offensive line can't block for bad QBs. If his mentoring of Mike Evans was a large contributor to his breakout rookie year, then I'd say his price tag is WELL worth it.   VJax has always been a terrific Buc in all regards. He's probably going to retire after this contract is up anyways. Let him ride out his contract and retire a Buccaneer."
buccaneers,38pm9s,ApolloXLII,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:33:53 2015 UTC,I agree with all your points but I don't think the organization will want to pay him to much. :-/

buccaneers,38pi9k,boriquaking55,10,Fri Jun 5 20:51:38 2015 UTC,David is under rookie contract... he would not hold out. Just demand more money on the next contract. Most teams have rookies play out their 4 years or whatever

buccaneers,38pi9k,boriquaking55,9,Fri Jun 5 20:58:47 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, I didn't see this coming at all. I mean he's making $1.5mil with the possibility of escalators but I agree with the holdout. Thats not enough especially for our best O-lineman, the top 10 RT guys in the league are making more than $5mil/yr with more than $1.5mil guaranteed. Hopefully they can settle on something closer to $4mil with $1mil(+) guaranteed.   This article makes it sound like they are trying to work it out and hopefully that happens quickly, we need him."
buccaneers,38pi9k,Steezewell,4,Fri Jun 5 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"...our best O-lineman...the top 10 RT guys in the league...   Those two are in no way related.  Dotson is average at best. The Buccaneers are going to continue their reputation of overpaying players if/when this happens. His leverage here is that he is the best of the worst and we are hostage to not having better, not that he is a lineman who is being underpaid for his outstanding performance.  But, as it stands now, we have nobody better to replace him so he will win."
buccaneers,38pi9k,TrueBuccaneersFan,13,Fri Jun 5 20:59:49 2015 UTC,Dotson gave up the 2nd least combines sacks/hits/hurries per snap last year among starting right tackles (and the least if you take out his games at LT).  And he did that with quarterbacks who held onto the ball longer than most.  He's one of the best pass blocking right tackles in the league.  His run blocking is average.  But to say he's average at best is wrong.
buccaneers,38pi9k,NeonSubtlety,8,Fri Jun 5 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"Dotson gave up the 2nd least combines sacks/hits/hurries per snap last year among starting right tackles   That might be because Collins was getting beat so fast, the guy Dotson was blocking never had a chance to get in on the action!

I am guessing that you are getting your sacks/hits/hurries per snap from ProFootballFocus, right? If so, those stats should be taken with a large grain of salt. If not then I would be intersted in knowing where you got them from. And where are you getting that our quarterbacks held onto the ball longer than most? I would be interested in comparing whoever's stats you are using for that to mine. My TTT has both McCown and Glennon a bit about average."

buccaneers,38pi9k,TrueBuccaneersFan,-6,Sat Jun 6 14:49:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of people trust PFF...   A lot of people believe in an invisible skydaddy too. That does not make them right.  PFF graded Anthony Collins as one of the best left tackles in the NFL in 2013 if that gives you any idea about how shitty they are. Plus, they say right on their site that they do not grade watching the coaches film of the games but watch the broadcast version like you see on tv. They cannot possibly effectively grade anything from that perspective. The only angle worth anything for grading the offensive line is the endzone angle. Any other angle is not going to give you the view to see how guys are blocking. And don't get me started on the defensive secondary. You cannot even see those guys on the broadcast version but PFF grades them too. I guess they use magic for that.  Thanks for the personal attacks too. Glad to see this subreddit is keeping its reputation intact."
buccaneers,38pi9k,TheMasiah,2,Sat Jun 6 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a personal attack, just starting that your the only one holding most of your views. Your very aggressive in the way you come off, nobody takes you seriously anymore.  But I'll ask your opinion on something i haven't seen, us taking Jameis Winston?"
buccaneers,38pi9k,TrueBuccaneersFan,3,Sat Jun 6 15:32:20 2015 UTC,"...nobody takes you seriously anymore.   Haha. When did anyone take me seriously around here? From day one I have been hated. But that is expected. I am one that does not run around saying that McCoy is the bees knees, Lovie is the next black Jesus, the reason we failed last year was because of not having an offensive coordinator, etc. and people hate that. It is the nature of in-groups that those who do not tow the party line are attacked. Sociology 101. If I cared about upvotes I could easily just post the words ""Gerald McCoy is the best defensive tackle ever known to man!"" in every thread and I would have a gazillion upvotes in a week. Thank the gods that I do not care one iota about internet points.  You can call me aggressive all day long but I have never called anyone on here names or attacked them personally. I can give you links and a long list of people who have called me names and attacked me as a person. I have a following of people who downvote everything I say. I can link you to once where I said ""fuck the Falcons"" and got downvoted to like -7. That was really good for a laugh. Somebody even commented on that about how it is silly how much people hate me. I even had one person create a username of TrueBuccaneersfanfan and he followed me around posting pictures after every comment I made. I miss him. I get called out for being an asshole here quite a bit but from my view this place attempts to be very aggressive towards me.  As for Jameis, I really do not have much of an opinion on him. He comes from a school that has never had a losing record in its history but has never had a QB make it in the NFL. He pulled off a 14-0 season but that was largely due to the defense. He has only lost one game in his two year career so that is worrying. Losing is a part of football and some people (Cam Newton for example) do not handle it well. A lot of these guys from college have grown up being the best and are used to bitch slapping weaker opponents around. They have never experienced failure. Then when they get to the NFL and get their asses handed to them they break down and cannot handle it. We will see if that happens to Jameis. Plus, EJ Manual did almost as well as Winston did with the same team and EJ Manual sucks. So it is really hard to judge Winston based on his college career. Watching him play I never said to myself ""he is going to be a superstar in the NFL"". He might turn out good but he might turn out to be a bust. We shall see.  I do think Winston has a beautiful long ball. Reminds me of Freeman in that aspect. I like his confidence and good god we could use some leadership on this team and some swagger. I hope he brings that.  I think that Lovie was forced to take Winston. Which is completely fine with me because I think Lovie is a horrible talent elevator. If I thought that Lovie actually wanted Winston then I would be worried. Lovie has never worked with a rookie quarterback and has shown a preference for veterans at that position. Him picking Winston was probably the last thing he wanted to do but he had to. The fans would have rioted. Koetter has worked with a rookie Qb before but that was Blaine Gabbert and we know how horrendous that turned out. Hopefully we will not get a repeat with Winston.  Overall I am not upset with the pick nor am I excited. We are going to continue hearing about how awesome Jameis is until the first game he plays and then we can really start to see what we have."
buccaneers,38pi9k,Steezewell,2,Sat Jun 6 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"So….Why are you a bucs fan? I mean it just kinda seems like you think some of our players are average or below average. You aren't high on McCoy, Lovie, Dotson, etc.   Those are some of the people that get me most fucking stoked about his team, it makes me feel like we have a reason to have optimism for the future.  So I'm genuinely curious…who or what do you like about this team?"
buccaneers,38pi9k,TrueBuccaneersFan,3,Sat Jun 6 19:06:22 2015 UTC,"I mean it just kinda seems like you think some of our players are average or below average.   Well, not trying to be an asshole but our team went 2-14. I think it is fair to say that our team, the players and coaches, are average or below average.  In my first post on this subreddit, I explained my position and why I am like this. For decades I have been a Buc fan who never spoke ill of the team. I always thought that was what fans were supposed to do is to support the team through thick and thin. I always thought it was ridiculous to complain about the quarterback, the coaches, the running backs, etc. and especially I thought it was silly to call for players and coaches to get fired. How can a person be a fan if they dislike their team?   I debated with people until I was blue in the face about Doug Williams. God, I remember how shitty fans were to him. Openly mocking his intelligence and I thought it was a sign of bad fans. It was quite prevalent. Same goes for Testaverde. Everyone thought it was funny to mock his vision. We could not run him out of town fast enough. I had so many fights with fans about Trent Dilfer that at one point I really thought that our fan base was invaded by other fans of the NFC North just to make us look bad. When Dungy was fired I almost cried. I could not believe that our fans wanted to get rid of the best coach we had/have ever had because he ""could not get us to the big game"". A couple of years ago, when the fan base went all ballistic on Schiano, I decided that I had enough. I was tired of defending my team against my own damn fans. So I figured, WTF, if I cannot beat them I will join them.  Now, I spend my time as a fan finding fault in the team. And I will tell you what, I picked a great time to do this. While I watched Buc fans squirm in misery last season, I was beaming with pride. For the first time I had criticized our team and I was vindicated. It did not hurt me last year when we lost. Because I got to act like an asshole and say ""See! I was right! We suck! Lovie needs to be fired!"". I can see now why ""fans"" of the Bucs act this way because it makes these crappy losing seasons actually pretty fun.   So I'm genuinely curious…who or what do you like about this team?   Lavonte David. He is easily one of the best players in football right now. I love watching him on tape. He has an incredibly good sense of football. He is like a grey hound dog who can track a football anywhere. He truly is fun and amazing to watch. I think Lovie has him playing coverage way too much but that is the nature of this defense now. David is damn good in coverage, don't get me wrong, but he is much better at hunting the ball. I feel his abilities are limited when he is confined to a zone.  Altreun Verner is a great tackler. Probably the best tackling corner in the league. His coverage skills are not the best but, damn, he sure can lay a shoulder into someone. I wish we used him in some corner blitzes because I would like to see how he does in that situation.  Clinton McDonald is one bad mofo. One of the knocks I have against the love everyone has for McCoy is that it takes away from the attention of other good players. McDonald is a perfect example. He is a beast. But no matter how good he plays everyone always brings up McCoy. During the games, if McDonald does something good, the announcers, if they even mention the play (which quite often they will not) they bring it up in the context of McCoy. They will say something like ""McDonald with a tackle for a loss on #23. He was able to do that because of the fantastic pressure put on by two time pro-bowler Gerald McCoy who has had an outstanding season with 5 sacks on the year. Nobody plays defensive tackle as good as Gerald McCoy."" You may think I am exaggerating but I am not. McDonald gets no love from the media or the fans and that is a shame. He is the only one on our line that plays with a mean streak. He throws guys around like he is mad at them. I saw him do a judo hip throw on a lineman and then run down field 20 yards to make a tackle. When he sacks or tackles the runner he does it with violence. In week 17 against Brees he sacked him and body slammed him so violently I thought for sure he was going to get a penalty. We need guys like that on our defense because we are pretty soft otherwise.  Logan Mankins. He played like shit last year. But I love his attitude. I watch how guys interact with each other and what they do to opponents and Mankins is the kind of guy you want on your side, not against you. He hits anybody on the other team who gets near him. Even after the play is over. It is like he sets his own personal space and anyone who violates it is going to get pushed. I love it. And he is the only lineman who seems protective of the quarterback. Against CIN last year, one of the dlineman crashed through the oline on a false start and hit McCown. Mankins was the only lineman who got in that guys face. The other lineman kind of milled about as they do looking like a bunch of cows at pasture.  Hardy Nickerson and Kevin O'Dea. Those are two good coaches. Both bring a level of toughness, grit, and no nonsense that I feel really motivates players.  Our receiving core. Of course, VJax and Evans (who hopefully can get through the sophomore slump and extra attention he will be getting) are beasts. They are slow as hell but I think there are very few corners in the league that can compete with them for the jump balls. I really like Murphy as our speedy receiver and the new guy Bell has really grown on me. I think he has the potential to be an excellent player.  Keith Tandy. He does not get near the playing time I would like to see. I have seen him lay some serious wood on people. He hit a guy so hard one time on special teams that they penalized him simply because it was such a hard hit. It was a perfect block but it looked so violent that the refs figured they had better throw a flag. He does that quite frequently especially considering the little amount of playing time he gets. When he does get on the field he seems to perform to a high level. Why he does not get more playing time is beyond me. I am not a fan of Lovie's talent evaluation so I will blame it on that.  There are other guys too that I want to see more of like J. Smith on the edge, Gholston, Spence (who I felt really came into his own last year, but again, no credit given), Rainey, M. James, and Lemon but I like them all from what I have seen."
buccaneers,38pi9k,iamdylanshaffer,2,Sun Jun 7 13:02:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a particularly fair assessment. He's a Buccaneers fan because you stay devoted to a team beyond the current players, head coach, or state of the team.  If remaining a fan of a team was reliant on liking the current players, state of the team, or head coach, there wouldn't be any Browns fans left in the world.  Just because most people within this subreddit like to remain optimistic and hold the players and coaches in high regard, doesn't mean that's the attitude you have to have as a fan. It's all outlook and matter of opinion."
buccaneers,38pi9k,ConcentrationKemp,7,Sun Jun 7 05:25:41 2015 UTC,You're off base here. Dotson is definitely above average.
buccaneers,38pi9k,Steezewell,3,Fri Jun 5 21:47:48 2015 UTC,"I would say he is a top ten talent in this  league at RT for sure. Even if you believe he is ""average""  I did say that he should get less than top ten talent too so I don't really understand where you're coming from.  He has been more than consistent for us in his play on the field and has been able to play 47 of 48 games, thats fucking awesome that he can stay healthy and still try to hold a terrible line together."
buccaneers,38pi9k,TrueBuccaneersFan,2,Sat Jun 6 02:23:46 2015 UTC,Dotson led our extremely penalized team with 14 penalties last year. I guess that deserves a pay raise. Dunno. I do not see anything worthy in him of getting more money other than the fact that we do not have anyone at all to replace him. We are being held hostage by that. Good for Dotson. It is not my money.  I just find it funny that everyone is in love with Dotson now when nobody chirped at all when we got rid of Penn who was much better and even more of an iron man. I stand by my statement that Dotson is average at best.
buccaneers,38pi9k,Lazarous86,3,Sat Jun 6 08:53:20 2015 UTC,"You're right. We should keep letting home grown talent walk instead of paying them average market rates. I am sure he isn't asking for top 5 money, but we should stop paying him bottom 5 money. He is good enough to keep and our line is weak enough we need him. We can argue about his talent level, but he is good enough he shouldn't be making 1.5 million on a line this bad. He has almost all the leverage here. He will get a new contract, but I am also with you that we shouldn't pay him top 10 money because he still needs to get better. Maybe they will work out a 3 year deal."
buccaneers,38pi9k,Steezewell,2,Sat Jun 6 12:10:10 2015 UTC,"Take a look at this and let me know what you think. I know, I know its Bleacher which isn't the greatest however they have him rated #5 out of 35 RT's. In 2014 they had him #4! Like I said B/R can be laughable, but it shows that others see his talent and think he consistently plays as a top 5 RT talent.    I see your point with 14 penalties (it could have been 16 just 2 were declined) that is waaay to much.  I still think he is one of the top 10 RTs in the league getting paid backup money. He has been consistent in keeping the pressure of the QB on the right side even on a horrible line."
buccaneers,38pi9k,TrueBuccaneersFan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"The Bleacher report write ups were not bad. I agree with their assessment to a degree, especially his run blocking, but they do not take into account something that I hold in high regard when grading/ranking players: the level of their opponents.  Our division is lacking in edge rushers. Greg Hardy was the best in our division and he is gone now. He generally was on the right side, away from Dotson too. So, as far as our divison goes, Dotson really never faces much tough competition.   If we look at the good edge rushers in the league like Von Miller, Clay Mathews, Cameron Wake,  Terrell Suggs, Demarcus Ware, Aldon Smith, Jason Pierre-Paul, etc. we can see that we rarely play rushers of that caliber. I think in order to be considered the best you have to play the best.   And what happens when we do play those guys? Baltimore has good edge rushers and Dotson had a pretty bad game against them. Dumervil had two sacks (I would claim 3 because one was credited against Gilkey that Dotson is at least partially responsible for IMHO) straight up against Dotson. The Packers have good edge rushers too and they got 7 sacks on us. Dotson was playing LT in that game and he gave up 3 sacks by my count in that game.  Again, I am not saying that Dotson sucks. But I agree with Greg Auman on this issue that ""Normally to get a new deal with two years left, have to really being playing above value. Just sets a precedent for others."""

buccaneers,38pi9k,fletch420man,0,Sun Jun 7 12:12:17 2015 UTC,I stand with you- This guys play (while best on that team) does not warrant a hold out or a pay upgrade. Bench him and start calling around-
buccaneers,38pi9k,nutramoil,3,Sat Jun 6 20:34:39 2015 UTC,"I would tend to agree.  Is Dotson total garbage?  No.  But he is far from being a stud on the line.  Just because he is our best o-lineman (debatable) does not mean he deserves to get paid like a top o-lineman in the league.  McCown and Glennon were our top two QB's last year, does either of them deserve anywhere near top QB money?  Of course not.  He needs to come into camp, compete, win a job and play out the season instead of holding out.  At that time, if he wants too much, I'd rather let him walk and let some other team overpay for a marginal talent.  Kind of like what we seem to do a lot these days."
buccaneers,38pi9k,Steezewell,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"Completely understandable, but McCown and Glennon are not seen by some analysts to be considered top 5 talent at their position. Dotson was our best O-lineman last year and considered to be a top 5 talent at his position. I mean we still don't even know what he is asking for, but I'm assuming its about what the other top RT's are making. I feel thats not a whole lot to ask for.  We need stability and chemistry on our line so the faster we get this out of the way the better our line can progress. Now if he was to stay at LT this year and was asking for LT money, I would be singing a different tune for sure!"

I definitely wouldn't mind us throwing him some cash,  he was the diamond in the rough last year and is currently in his prime. It's not like he's asking for an unreasonable amount.

You try being 6'6"" when all your starting receivers are a good 6 inches shorter than you.   The QB tried to force the ball into my hands all the time. Even in double, sometimes triple coverage. But dear god, did I pay for making those catches. A concussion is no fucking joke; you've never thought you could have such a pounding headache. It is literally the worst feeling in the world. I have more sympathy for the RB, WR, QB, and LB cores, then linemen. Those guys get clicked constantly, multiple times a game.  The concussion issue was honestly why I never perused football any further. After all those hits, it just felt like this was eventually going to kill me. And maybe I was smart about that, with all the concussion lawsuits and what not."

buccaneers,38f3vg,NFLVideoConverterBot,7,Wed Jun 3 20:19:19 2015 UTC,"I think it is something he needs to work on, but it is clear he is doing that. I think I remember his throwing motion was so bad mostly because he used to pitch, so I would think the fact he stopped playing baseball and is going to only play football now would mean it will (eventually) go away. He still might go back to he old motion under pressure and stuff, but as long as he works on it I think it should not be an issue later on."

buccaneers,38f3vg,RikoThePanda,6,Wed Jun 3 22:45:18 2015 UTC,The throwing motion looks much better after he worked with George Whitfield all spring .  If he can maintain the mechanics when the real bullets are flying and not revert back is the key.

buccaneers,38f3vg,beniro,2,Thu Jun 4 02:34:45 2015 UTC,It's definitely not as bad as it was before.  He just needs to keep holding the ball higher and he will gradually lose that dropping motion he adds to the throw.

Winston still dips the ball, and almost side-arms it. It's a crazy kind of throwing motion, but the ball is a fucking rocket coming out. Kinda stares Mike down and the ball is a little high, which makes me think in an actual game a DE might be able to get into the throwing lane.. but still, fucking rocket man"

buccaneers,38butf,JBProds,7,Wed Jun 3 05:22:24 2015 UTC,"To say he didn't have a great combine is very generous. Running a 4.81 40 is a fucking disaster for a DB. Hackett ran the slowest time of any DB at the combine this year. As a matter of fact, I just looked it up, it was the second slowest time by a DB since 2009. His Pro Day wasn't much better at 4.72. That coupled with the fact that he seems pretty thin and would probably need to put on a bit of weight doesn't leave me with a whole lot of hope. Which is a total shame, he is fun to watch and has a great nose for the ball. He is going to have to be mad man on kick coverage if he is going to even make it past the cut to 75 much less make the team. However, surprises happen ever year. I wouldn't have thought Bradley McDougald had much of a chance last year and look what happened. I wish Hackett the best of luck."
buccaneers,38butf,jaemarl,2,Wed Jun 3 09:20:00 2015 UTC,"Good on you for looking his stats up, it's important to have that perspective.  That said, 40 times don't always translate onto the field of play. Brooks was never a fast player, but his read/react was phenomenal which gave him an extra step, kind of a balance between being slow.  That's an apple to an orange comparison, and if a DB gets caught out of position then it's disastrous, as speed will get them back into a play. But if Hackett is always in a good position, his slow speed may not be a liability"
buccaneers,38butf,Devils_-_Advocate,4,Wed Jun 3 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not Al Davis, I understand well that there is much more to the game than a guy's 40 time. It's just that no matter how good a guy is at getting in position there comes a point where he is just too slow. My fear with Hackett is that with a 4.81 40 he has crossed that point.  You're right Brooks, and for that matter Barber or Lynch, were never considered fast players, but all three at least ran in the 4.6s. 4.8 is a whole other ball game. There won't be much to keep the receivers from constantly taking the tops off their routes against him.  But who knows, 40 fast and football fast can sometimes be very different things. Hackett is certainly worth keeping an eye on this spring."
buccaneers,38butf,jaemarl,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:55:58 2015 UTC,Derrick Brooks was never a fast player?? Are u mad? He ran a 4.67 40 time. For comparison Lavonte David ran a 4.65.  In his early years Derrick Brooks was very fast for a linebacker. He was all the over the place making tackles. He was always praised for his quickness.
buccaneers,38butf,SkardHard,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:26:04 2015 UTC,".2 seconds faster than what Hackett ran, in a straight line, in shorts makes zero difference in what you do on a football field. Brooks' instincts and reaction are what made him great, not his blinding speed"
buccaneers,38butf,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:46:34 2015 UTC,"Hackett is a DB not a linebacker so that's a big deal.   His instincts, reaction time, intelligence, work ethic, AND speed made Brooks great.  Saying Brooks was never a fast player is ridiculous."

buccaneers,38butf,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:39:51 2015 UTC,It's pretty dumb that you're comparing the speed of a lb drafted 20 years ago to a present day db. Brooks was faster than the vast majority of lbs at the time and even now.

You just sound stupid by saying Brooks wasn't fast when he ran an almost identical 40 time to Lavonte David and Brooks was always praised for his speed for a linebacker. Then you say well Brooks only ran .2 faster than Hackett, when Hackett is a DB and Brooks is a LB."
buccaneers,38butf,SkardHard,5,Wed Jun 3 19:45:14 2015 UTC,I really really like him. He has quick reactions and makes some really impressive INT's. I hope he makes the final roster because I can see him becoming a starter and a stud if he plays to his full potential of a ball hawk. The only problem is he is pretty small and maybe not the best tackler. He'll need to put on some weight and hopefully it won't effect his speed to much.
buccaneers,38butf,Ordirve,2,Wed Jun 3 05:56:35 2015 UTC,I do too. We all know this team needs secondary help & someone that can create turnovers. I feel like Hackett is someone that would easily get claimed by another team if waived.
buccaneers,38butf,INSTiiNKT,2,Wed Jun 3 06:05:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like the secondary is actually, as a unit, a team strength. We played decent defense the second half of the season without a pass rush. I'm sure our pass defense numbers are pretty bad but I would posit that's on the d-line. It also didn't help that Mason Foster was generally a liability in coverage."

People take team's like they take family, they're willing to defend their family until they can't anymore. Jameis hasn't done anything negative since being signed on, so people are naturally going to come to his defense.  I absolutely can't wait to see what Jameis does come the season, and I'm 100% supporting him, and hoping for the best, but at the same time I'm also aware of his faults, and what needs to be worked on, as I'm sure almost everyone else here is as well. Posting the same kinds of comments in every thread ""LOL RAPIST, I HOPE HE GETS DESTROYED SO WE CAN GET RID OF HIM."" are going to be met with swift downvotes, because honestly, it's uncalled for whether you like him or not.

I can link you to a thousand ""fuck Gilkey"" comments or to the ever pervasive hatred for the coach in 2013 where people were proud of their disdain. Or the name calling of Glennon. Hell, we run out Super Bowl winning coaches and quarterbacks on the regular here in Tampa.  No, Buc fans are extremely cruel to their team.

Week Opponent Result Storytime    1 vs TEN Win We squeak out a win on the strength of the defense, as the offense is still in disarray starting two rookie O-lineman, and a rookie QB in a totally new offense the players are still learning.   2 @ NO Loss New Orleans' new power run game offense with Mark Ingram and CJ Spiller put up 150 yards rushing, Drew Brees puts up 2 touchdowns over Mike Jenkins with Johnthan Banks sitting on the bench. They play solid ball control and Jameis makes a few mistakes costing us the game. Fanbase panic ensues   3 @ HOU Loss JJ Watt and the finally healthy Jadaveon Clowney make a mess of our offensive line, Winston has no chance to let routes develop, and spends most of the game running for his life. Our offense is still gelling, still learning, it's just not enough to overcome a solid Houston team at home.   4 vs CAR Loss Cam just loves the cannons at Raymond James, we put up a better fight than either of the previous 2 games, things on offense are starting to get better, but we still lose late in the 4th quarter.   5 vs JAX Win Jacksonville is just not there yet, Winston rallies the team in the 4th quarter to his first comeback win of his NFL career.   6 BYE NA The team goes into the bye week 2/3, but coming off a win on the last game has morale high, things are starting to come together on offense.   7 @ WAS Win We come out of the bye week firing on all cylinders and lay waste to the Redskins in similar fashion to last year. Doug Martin finally has his resurgence game and puts up 100+ yards and a touchdown   8 @ ATL Win Atlanta is still adjusting to a new coach, and Dirk Koetter's familiarity with our opponent's players gives us a nice edge. Ryan and Julio still do some damage putting us behind in the 4th, but Jameis has a solid 4 minute drive putting us ahead by 4, and the defense holds on for the W.   9 vs NYG Loss Just when we think things are starting to go in our favor, the entire Raymond James stadium is covered in blue jerseys as the plague of transplant New Yorkers overwhelm our fanbase and turn our home game into an away game. Odell Beckham rejuvenates the offense, and the Giants end up contending for the NFC East. We lose by 2 scores.   10 vs DAL Loss If you thought it was bad with Giants fans, the Dallas Cowboys fans invade to an even more drastic effect. Our defense gets no pressure and Romo picks us apart.   11 @ PHI Win The NFL has basically figured out Chip Kelly's shenanigans at this point, they enter this game with a losing record. Bradford's west coast dink and dunk style is easily read by our DBs and Lavonte David. Jameis has a solid game, we run out the clock late in the 4th quarter.   12 @ IND Loss Facing an opponent even stronger than the Cowboys, and an away game. We basically get slaughtered by Andrew Luck and a Colts offense that is finally done sandbagging itself with Trent Richardson. Jameis plays his heart out in the 4th quarter to bring us within a touchdown, but it isn't enough and Frank Gore bulldozes the game clock. We end the game watching them kneel it out.   13 vs ATL Win We finally beat the Atlanta Falcons in Raymond James and put those Fans back on their buses depressed about being swept by the Buccaneers. It's a long ride back to Atlanta.   14 vs NO Win This turns into an epic shootout on both sides, our offense finally has enough experience and confidence to generate a balanced attack, Winston leads us to victory in the 4th quarter.   15 @ STL Loss We annoyingly lose to the Rams, again, for like the 5th time in however many seasons. They don't do anything particularly well, we just throw the game away in stupid fashion after the previous game showed us our potential. Just rookie things...   16 vs CHI Win Lovie finally exacts retribution on the John Fox led Bears, this game is defined by our defense that plays an outstanding game generating 3-4 turnovers, media start to collapse on Jay Cutler, speculating that his time as Bears QB is over.   17 @ CAR Loss We are a game away from a wildcard berth, we just need to beat the Panthers at home. Unfortunately Cam just has one of those great games, and despite a valiant effort by our rookie QB, it isn't enough. We lose and miss the playoffs. Jameis learns a tough lesson about the level of competition in the NFL and we go into the offseason with a mixed bag, but great feelings about where we will be next year.   Final - 8-8 This is exactly the opposite of what OP is saying, I'm not trying to disagree, just how I felt the games would go."

buccaneers,387sh8,The_Big_Cat,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:55:42 2015 UTC,Sounds like a reasonable goal to me :)
buccaneers,387sh8,boriquaking55,5,Tue Jun 2 16:03:44 2015 UTC,We may have been 2-14 last season but apart from the major blowouts we had 8 games we lost within one score and 2 more we lost by less than 10 points. 10 if our games were winnable and we just screwed up enough times to screw ourselves out of a win.   So much about this season hinges in our Offensive line gelling.
buccaneers,387sh8,spideralex90,2,Tue Jun 2 15:45:51 2015 UTC,"Funny how I remember everyone complaining that losing close games in 2013 was a sign of bad coaching. Why is that not being said about last season?  Losing by one score is pretty normal. Almost half (43%) of all NFL games are decided by one score. I see nothing special about us losing half of our games by one score last year.  We won 7 games in 2012 and of the 9 we lost, only 2 were by more than one score with a total season point differential of -5. In 2013 we had a point differential of -101. Last year we had a point differential of -133. In every aspect our season last year was worse than the year before. We will be thankful to get back to the 2012-2013 performances this year."
buccaneers,387sh8,TrueBuccaneersFan,2,Wed Jun 3 03:03:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is saying we had a great coaching setup last year. Actually it is quite the opposite. Most people point to our lack of an offensive coordinator and our non attempt to fix that situation as a huge reason why we did so poorly and had constant 3 and outs/turnovers. Which falls on Lovie and Lichts shoulders. But even with poor coaching we were still 'in' a good majority of our games.   Also 43% means that the majority of games are still decided by more than one score.   I'm not trying to say that we should have won 10 more games than we did, but we had the chance and our mistakes and poor offensive play calling and general shooting ourselves in the foot killed us."
buccaneers,387sh8,spideralex90,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:10:34 2015 UTC,"You are still trying to give lovie a pass, our defense played better towards the ends of the season but they still blew coverages in critical situations and helped us lose almost as many games as the offense did."
buccaneers,387sh8,FEO4,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"The defense was no where near as bad as the offense, especially not in the last half of the season where we were rated in the upper half of the league in DVOA (if you isolated these games, the DVOA on the whole year was not great in the least.). Our defense wasn't great on the year overall but when the offense can't stay on the field it's hard for a defense to stay fresh.   I'm perfectly fine seeing what Lovie has to offer this year but if we don't show signs of improvement I wouldn't be surprised if he's gone next year."
buccaneers,387sh8,spideralex90,3,Wed Jun 3 16:00:55 2015 UTC,"Your prediction sounds to me like, ""I think the Buccaneers will be consistent.""   I don't love that prediction."
buccaneers,387sh8,MarleyandtheWhalers,2,Tue Jun 2 17:48:54 2015 UTC,"Week 1: W Titans: they have more question marks than us  Week 2: L Saints: I don't see us beating them in their place  Week 3: L Texans: JJ Watt is OP, welcome to the NFL Winston  Week 4: W Panthers: Fuck the Panthers  Week 5: W Jags: Bortles will not be raised  Week 7: W Redskins: Our D forces RG3 to struggle  Week 8: L Falcons: Way good with Quinn as HC  Week 9: L Giants: Just don't see us winning this game  Week 10: L Cowboys: Romo owns us every time we play them  Week 11: W Eagles: Most toss up game of the year for me  Week 12: L Colts: They improved a bunch this off season  Week 13: L Falcons: Nope  Week 14: W Saints: We tend to always beat the Saint late in the season  Week 15: W Rams: Primetime for the trio of 3's (3,13,83)  Week 16: W Bears: Lovie fucks em right in the pussy  Week 17: L Panthers: They always play great at the end of the year  I can see anything from 6-10 to 10-6 but after looking at how I rated the games I think the season will come down to how well they can handle losing 2 or 3 games in a row and injuries. Adversity will be key for the Bucs to string together wins. There is a chance to start the season 5-2 but then there is a very real chance they could drop the next 7 games after that. Anything over 7 wins is a successful season in my eyes. 4 wins and below and I will really begin to question what Lovie and Licht are doing with the way they manage the talent on the team."

buccaneers,385c81,waytogobucs,17,Mon Jun 1 23:35:42 2015 UTC,"My comment to NFL.com:  ""Deandre Levy huh? No love for Lavonte David? Who in the last 3 seasons (David's first 3 in the league) he's amassed 71 MORE total tackles than Levy; Moveover, 61 of those are solo tackles. David also has 10 sacks to Levy's ""impressive"" 3.5, which has taken him 7 seasons to get to. Forced fumbles, David has more. I mean, I understand the idea of not looking at a last place team for underrated talent, but if you work for the NFL I would assume you should do your due diligence, rather than pick an 8 year veteran as someone who is ""underrated"". He's had his time in the league, and he's middle of the pack. Lavonte is up there with Kuechly every year for the league lead in tackles, not just one time."""

And we only had revis for one year too and we damn sure didn't win a Super Bowl.   No, but the best CB we ever had did win a Super Bowl, and Revis didn't do the greatest job of filling Ronde's shoes.  Honestly I wish we never had him.   Mankins might play one good year for us   He is one of the most important members of this team moving forward, considering we have a rookie quarterback and he's the only member of our offense who has a history of leadership.  Mankins is going to go a long way toward Winston ever realizing that potential everyone spent the last few months drooling over.

And Cam often shows flashes of true dominance where he is the most dangerous player on the field and is a threat to score from anywhere.. So, maybe ""ceiling"" wasn't the right word.

buccaneers,383epg,DeadRosess,2,Mon Jun 1 18:59:39 2015 UTC,"And who was a veteran leader on a team with a legitimately great quarterback and offense before.  In fact, if it must be drawn back to Winston, I could phrase it to reporters like this:  Logan Mankins will go a long way in determining if Winston ever reaches that ceiling everyone always goes on and on about."
buccaneers,383epg,LansdowneStreet,4,Mon Jun 1 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"Just me personally, but in recent years, he is the player I love the most. Don't get me wrong, McCoy, VJax, Evans... are amazing, but for some reason I am always most excited that we have LD. He is our secret... for now. Co-workers will taunt me saying their team is playing mine and ill mention LD before the game. After the game, I always here ""Damn, he is amazing"" or something like that.  Im just hoping we get that contract done with him as soon as possible."
buccaneers,383epg,AvatarKuruk2,3,Mon Jun 1 17:10:14 2015 UTC,"Kind of reminds me of happier days, too, when everyone wanted to talk about Sapp and only Bucs fans knew ""he's great, but he's not even our best guy."""
buccaneers,383epg,LansdowneStreet,5,Mon Jun 1 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"That's one of the reasons I've always loved being a Bucs fan. We have a quiet tradition of having some of the best of the best on defense. Our team may have been hot garbage as of late, but I'll eat crow if McCoy and David don't become household names like Sapp and Brooks were when they retired."
buccaneers,383epg,ApolloXLII,4,Mon Jun 1 21:20:02 2015 UTC,"The most underrated LB in the league by far. They all talk about Luke Kuechly, but never even mention David."

buccaneers,383epg,thedaj,0,Mon Jun 1 18:09:00 2015 UTC,He had an awful start to the season. He missed tackles and just wasn't in the right spot.
buccaneers,383epg,sinestrostaint,-2,Mon Jun 1 21:35:50 2015 UTC,He didn't make the pro bowl because only 9 people watched any Bucs games this year

buccaneers,382vyz,spideralex90,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:37:18 2015 UTC,It's one of those stories that seems like it's written for a film script. It probably has some basis in reality though at the very least.   It's a fun read though and gets you pumped for this season.
buccaneers,382vyz,SoonerinTampa,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:25:57 2015 UTC,That is the problem with that crappy JBF site...who knows what is real and what is manifested in his puny mind.
buccaneers,382vyz,LansdowneStreet,5,Mon Jun 8 14:34:39 2015 UTC,"Logan Mankins is a very important member of this team this year.  He and Evan Dietrich Smith have an opportunity to help Winston's transition to the NFL, since they both have worked with top-end quarterbacks before."

buccaneers,383ni6,Buddy813,11,Mon Jun 1 16:53:33 2015 UTC,"He's right. I'd bet you anything you can't find a QB that hated losing more than Tim Tebow.  Basically what he's saying is that the only way in which Jameis is like Tebow, is my absolute favorite quality of Tebow? Yessir. Quite the compliment. Call him Tebow-with-actual-NFL-talent. Scary. In a good way."
buccaneers,383ni6,BucsCapacitor,5,Mon Jun 1 17:02:35 2015 UTC,"I'd bet you anything you can't find a QB that hated losing more than Tim Tebow.   Brady, Manning, Jim McMahon, Brett Favre/Favor, Roger the Dodger, Montana, Young..."

buccaneers,383ni6,BucsCapacitor,5,Tue Jun 2 12:18:43 2015 UTC,"Im not going to be too harsh on the guy for this statement. He was just trying to say that he is a competitor. He is paid to catch footballs not make amazing comparisons. You get a pass here, sir."

buccaneers,384cyg,trudatness,14,Mon Jun 1 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"I think he will probably have over 20, but 30 seems a little too high."
buccaneers,384cyg,Fyresand,7,Mon Jun 1 19:57:46 2015 UTC,The record for interceptions by a rookie is 28 right? I can't imagine he'll do worse than Bortles with 17. I mean McCown made a shit load of bad decisions on field last year and only managed to throw 14 interceptions. If Winston throws 30 I fear for how this fanbase will turn on him.
buccaneers,384cyg,spideralex90,6,Mon Jun 1 20:11:54 2015 UTC,Peyton threw 28 his rookie year with the Colts.
buccaneers,384cyg,I_Hold_Up_Buses,2,Mon Jun 1 20:59:05 2015 UTC,That's what I thought.
buccaneers,384cyg,spideralex90,5,Mon Jun 1 21:23:07 2015 UTC,"I really doubt it. Coaches aren't idiots. If he looks interception prone in training camp and the preseason then they're going to simplify the playroom and let him play safe football for a while until he catches up with the speed of the game. If there's a semblance of a run game and if the defense doesn't give up a ton of points, he's not going to feel compelled to play risky football either."
buccaneers,384cyg,sinestrostaint,7,Mon Jun 1 21:35:06 2015 UTC,"Well he threw a lot in college and there is going to be an adjustment period, it's not like a rookie can walk in and immediately be better as a pro than he was against considerably worse college defenses.  30's pretty excessive, but he will be throwing a bunch of picks.  I expect learning when not to throw the ball will be one of the bigger NFL adjustments he's going to need to make."
buccaneers,384cyg,LansdowneStreet,3,Mon Jun 1 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"Whoa easy with the logic. Try to stick with things like: Winston good, Winston best ever, Winston not need adjustment time. You will be well received by the others."
buccaneers,384cyg,Anthrazl,3,Mon Jun 1 22:27:29 2015 UTC,Jameis Hype forever

buccaneers,384cyg,fletch420man,2,Tue Jun 2 13:23:43 2015 UTC,hopefully a little negative press in terms of on the field performance will just push him that much harder to be smart with the ball
buccaneers,384cyg,ocxtitan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:13:17 2015 UTC,In all the bucs years I have never said this in my life. I believe Jameis- I think we finally scored- I'm glad people are pecking him but fuck man he looks every bit the guy we need.
buccaneers,384cyg,fletch420man,3,Tue Jun 2 22:05:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say Jameis has around 20-24 INTs. High INTs is to be expected, but damn, 30!? No way."
buccaneers,384cyg,TheWhiteBlur,5,Wed Jun 3 02:55:15 2015 UTC,"If Winston is being too careless with the ball , then Lovie will turtle it , and turn to the 3 yards and a cloud of dust running game early and often.   30 INTs will never happen."
buccaneers,384cyg,BucJason,3,Mon Jun 1 21:54:01 2015 UTC,3 yards and a cloud of dust  I think lovie might be confused about that part. Our offense looked more like -2 yards and a fumble last year
buccaneers,384cyg,FEO4,0,Tue Jun 2 06:13:40 2015 UTC,LOL true

buccaneers,382xvb,TheFencingCoach,6,Mon Jun 1 13:54:54 2015 UTC,My biggest concern now from the kid is him handling the NFL spotlight.  He is getting so much attention and praise it almost seems like it will be impossible for him to live up to the hype.  I just hope his maturity allows him to take the negatives in stride and keep on working hard.
buccaneers,382xvb,nutramoil,3,Mon Jun 1 14:37:51 2015 UTC,"If he can survive the barrage of media he got at while at FSU regarding his past transgressions, he can survive the NFL spotlight...so long as he stays in the news for the right reasons."
buccaneers,382xvb,nutramoil,2,Mon Jun 1 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"Possibly.  I just see the scrutiny and pressure of the NFL being much more than any college program.  Could be wrong.  Plus I'm more talking about the pressure to succeed, and apparently by the pressure of many here and in the media, succeed now.    He lost one game in college.  He is going to lose many more than that with the Bucs and probably a lot more the first half of his first season.  Just trying to temper the expectations showered on the young man.  He is just a 20 year old kid after all and many are calling him our savior.  I can't imagine having that type of pressure on your shoulders as a kid that young."
buccaneers,382xvb,FSCoded,2,Mon Jun 1 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though. This kid THRIVES, and I mean thrives, on this kind of pressure. Yeah his first year in the NFL will most likely net him more losses than he has seen in the past 4 years of playing football (HS included). Expectations should be tempered but I honestly think the kid can turn the Bucs around by the time his rookie contract is up."
buccaneers,382xvb,lazybrouf,3,Mon Jun 1 17:53:59 2015 UTC,I think there are two types of attention though. Positive and negative.   He might respond differently to each type.
buccaneers,382xvb,chemthethriller,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:38:15 2015 UTC,"Scrutiny and pressure is already much less in the NFL than at FSU (imo). I followed him from HS recruit and throughout college, big time, borderline obsessed... Honestly he appears the was he was prior to the sexual assault stuff coming out, where he was upbeat and cheerful, then everything came down and he was very business like all of the time.    I honestly believe Winston strived on the field during the toughest situation of his life that he may face, and if he made it through that he will be fine in the NFL."
buccaneers,382xvb,nutramoil,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:32:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree about the pressure and scrutiny in the NFL being less than at FSU.  The NFL is the big leagues if you will.  There are only 32 teams in the NFL and QB is the most prominent position in the NFL and the NFL is the most followed sport, at least in the US.  That basically means that he will be in the top 32 most scrutinized players in major US sports.  Just look at the videos of when he was drafted and his first visit to one Buc.  Licht talked to him, Lovie talked to him, the phone was passed to each brother/owner.  Then his first day there, the entire staff of one buc was there to greet him with great fanfare.  I expect he will be a great QB and lead the Bucs to great things and hopefully have a long career here.  I just think that people need to pump the brakes on crowing him some savior.  Let the kid take a snap in a real NFL game first for gods sake."
buccaneers,382xvb,Luceint3214,4,Tue Jun 2 17:52:42 2015 UTC,I'm not personally a fan of the Jameis Christ nickname. Jaboo was his nickname at FSU.

buccaneers,37zizq,TheChrisDez,10,Sun May 31 18:53:46 2015 UTC,Why are we so down on Mike James?  He ran the ball really well for the games he started 2 years ago. He seems like our only RB that can actually break tackles and convert on short yardage plays. Martin and Sims go down on first contact.
buccaneers,37zizq,SkardHard,5,Sun May 31 19:18:48 2015 UTC,"I want James to be allowed to be our main back for a few games. It feels like he's been marginalized, and I believe he can be the guy we need."

buccaneers,37zizq,Weezytheweasel,2,Mon Jun 1 00:04:32 2015 UTC,He ran a 4.53 40. Not really fast enough for a KR or PR
buccaneers,37zizq,SkardHard,2,Mon Jun 1 00:42:51 2015 UTC,Downvoted because you don't even address Bobby Rainey and his talents. Come on man
buccaneers,37zizq,SharkBaituaha,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:00:21 2015 UTC,"That's because we are not down on Rainey and he doesn't go down on first contact like Martin and Sims.

buccaneers,37zizq,SkardHard,0,Tue Jun 2 05:50:30 2015 UTC,He may have missed his shot to make a name for himself 2 years ago when he became starter and then promptly broke his foot.
buccaneers,37zizq,BucJason,4,Mon Jun 1 12:25:36 2015 UTC,This season we will come to the realization that Bobby Rainey is our best RB.

buccaneers,37zizq,sdfitzyb,1 point,Sun May 31 23:53:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, but those stats that year were inflated by two huge games. Not saying he didn't deserve it but that is a very small sample."
buccaneers,37zizq,I_Hold_Up_Buses,2,Mon Jun 1 02:52:02 2015 UTC,"I certainly hope he does get the chance to start. I believe he is our best RB, and it was the poor play by the OLine and his injuries which made him look bad."
buccaneers,37zizq,spideralex90,2,Sun May 31 18:55:18 2015 UTC,"I'd be very happy if he bounced back, but if he does I see us trading him like the Cowboys and Murray last year."

Assuming a sellout, that means that would mean only 16k Buc fans in the stadium. The season ticket base alone is larger than that.  NY fans will turn out for that game, but it'll be like 5-1 Buc fans. Which still sucks but let's be real about the numbers."
buccaneers,37wb2t,TheCenterOfEnnui,5,Sun May 31 05:20:54 2015 UTC,I feel like Winston has to change those ratios. Just the FSU fans that will come to support him will increase attendance.
buccaneers,37wb2t,Lazarous86,2,Sun May 31 13:58:55 2015 UTC,"Again, it has never been, in any game, something outlandish like 3-1 for the other team. I have no idea why my other post got downvoted but that was a ridiculous statement. The worst I've ever seen was at a Green Bay game back in the mid-90s where it was probably 60-40 Bucs fans to Packer fans....but they were beating the crap out of us in the game, and Buc fans started leaving, so the place seemed like it was owned by Packer fans. I've been to a few Yankee/Rays games where it was roughly 50-50 on occasion, but 3-1 in favor of the other team? No, that's just not even close to reality."

Don't build him up so much in May that by the time September rolls around, we'll be expecting 5000 yards and 50 TD passes.

It's like they don't have anything else and winston came in already as such a big story that they're trying to capitalize on it because flipping the script on ESPN is so hot right now.  At the same time though, they're getting asked by reporters. What the hell are they supposed to say? There is this narrative (that probably isn't wrong) that says winston is a gamer and he's willing to do anything to do well in the league. If reporters are asking about him, that's the response they're going to get.   I think my biggest fear is that this isn't real. If he really is that committed then talk about it all you want. That's who he is and what he does, so if he gets asked about there's nothing more to say. If reporters want to ask ad nauseum then let them. If this is doctored though, that's when I'll have a problem with it"

Until a guy is successful in the NFL, we have no way of knowing.  Do not trust college football to tell you much about the pros.  They're hardly the same sport, and I think everyone likes it that way.  People can talk all they want about pro-style offenses, but the worst NFL team Winston ever faces will be miles better than the best college team he's ever faced.  So we won't know until we know."

I think all true buc fans are excited to see him play in some actual games whether you like the guy or not. We know all to well the hurt that comes with overhyping our roster in the offseason just to be disappointed Sunday after Sunday come fall.

I'm planning to go to the Jags game though! I'm a UCF alum so I'm excited to see Winston vs Bortles."
buccaneers,37ll73,spideralex90,7,Thu May 28 15:24:17 2015 UTC,Great choice of game since it is one of our better chances to get a win.

buccaneers,37ll73,BucJason,3,Thu May 28 17:58:16 2015 UTC,It's basically summer until Halloween (Oct 31). That's when the first cold front generally pops through.  So I think it's fair to say 85 degrees and 90% humidity in October.

Also the sun light will be strong no matter how hot it is, unless it's raining you'll need Sun block that is unless you like being as red as the jersey and Sun burned. Even in October it'll get a little unbearable, and since you're Canadian, it'll probably seem worse to u than a local. BUUUTT!!  Dress light, deal with it via cold brews, and enjoy yourself Dude. It'll all be worth it."

buccaneers,37lrhc,ApolloXLII,13,Fri May 29 00:02:51 2015 UTC,I hate when ESPN tries to fabricate stories out of nothing. These writers get paid off of the stories that they write and theres very little to talk about in the off season. Thats why they tried to make a huge deal about Jameis' character. Ill tell you from first hand experience that the guy is a class act and works his ass off

I hit the snooze give myself a couple minutes to wake up. I sit up in bed and swing my legs off the side. Im sitting there thinking ""goddamn! my ankles are stiff."" I take a couple more minutes to loosen up and walk around. I brush my teeth with bottled water because the water from the faucets are brown. I grab some clothes from a pile and put them on. As soon as I put my hand on the knob of the door my phone rings. ""Ben, I have some bad news. You are being released. Bring your tablet and playbook to the facility. Click."" I had been anticipating it all week but it still felt shitty. That feeling of being on the outside looking in. Anyway, I pack my stuff up and head to the facility. Im directed to the player personnel office and I sign some paperwork. Im directed to the training room and I sign some more paperwork. I clear out my locker and am handed a flight itinerary on my way out. I head back to the hotel and have a few hours to kill so I got piss drunk while packing up all of my stuff. Called an Uber to the airport and fell asleep in my bed at home.  Part II: The Bay  It's 6:30AM and Im looking over the script for todays practice. Feeling pretty confident with what I need to accomplish for the day, I pack up my stuff and head to the facility. As soon as I walk inside one of the player personnel staff (aka Reapers) says ""so and so wants to meet with you."" I immediately knew i was being released. After awhile you simply realize that the NFL is strictly a business. You can't really beat yourself up about being cut because its purely a business decision especially when youre just a victim of the numbers game. Anyway, I sign my forms, head back to the hotel, pack up my stuff and head to the airport. I am currently on my flight getting piss drunk trying to shut out the screaming baby sitting 2 rows behind me."
buccaneers,37lrhc,gravy_trane,10,Fri May 29 01:15:17 2015 UTC,"Reading that felt like a punch in the chest. Yes, the NFL is a business but you undoubtedly wanted this opportunity and the fact that it's a business doesn't make it any easier.  I had a student in the London Olympics for Pentathlon. When we were chatting as the games ended, she said ""I don't know who would hire me from here."" My response (as an employer) was: ""you would be at the top of my résumé pile. Anyone who gives years of their life to their passion and is willing to put adult life aside to pursue their dream is exactly the kind of person I would want to hire first.""  You will make an NFL roster, but when your career is done, you will have a more interesting and compelling story to tell than any of your peers by far. This is not the end, it is the beginning.   We're in your corner, man. I gave you my email address. Anything you need from me as a friend of Mike Alberts I am happy to be of assistance. But that's a conversation we can have 10+ years down the road!!! Keep at it. I will be following your career with great interest, and I wish you the best."

buccaneers,37lboh,boriquaking55,10,Thu May 28 13:37:15 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I was thinking. Gerald has the face of the franchise on lock down for now.
buccaneers,37lboh,Blake1288,6,Thu May 28 13:42:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe because around the league he's the most popular Bucs player, not necessarily with Bucs fans. A lot of people watched him with Manziel at Texas A&M."
buccaneers,37lboh,SkardHard,1 point,Thu May 28 13:47:02 2015 UTC,"After only one season? I wouldn't believe it.  McCoy is forever tied to Suh, he's certainly more well known than Evans is. I don't think the Bucs have a lot of ""popular"" guys on our roster, but McCoy is certainly better known than Evans is"
buccaneers,37lboh,Devils_-_Advocate,2,Thu May 28 14:31:32 2015 UTC,I think you may be giving casual NFL fans too much credit.  Suh has certainly kept his name out there with controversial calls and what not but McCoy has just been quietly playing well.  For a small market team that's not going to get him much media attention and certainly not the attention of fans from other teams.  Evans had a great rookie year and and his name is synonymous with Manziel's.  I can see more people knowing him.
buccaneers,37lboh,DeadRosess,1 point,Thu May 28 14:42:06 2015 UTC,"Suh has certainly kept his name out there   This argument works both ways. Manziel has kept his name out there, overshadowing any ties with Evans.   but McCoy has just been quietly playing well.   Evans has been quietly playing well also. Why would people know him more after one good year vs McCoy's career as one of the best NT's in the game of football (sans his first two seasons)?"

One of the bloggers who write articles for the Bucs (Caleb, I think?) is an avid Patriots fan on his profile. So, as a reader, why should I care what he has to say about a team he has no ties to? What are their bona fides?  EDIT: Cast in point, this was his profile..  ""ABOUT  I like football. A lot, so writing about football seemed like a good career choice. But that's not where I started. My trek into the writing wilderness began at The Picton Gazette, Canada's oldest community newspaper. There I spent many, many hours covering council meetings, and I once chased an escaped monkey (no, that really happened). Then the football fun started. I spent five years at theScore.com in several positions, primarily serving as the NFL features writer and editor. Aside from covering all things NFC West now for Bleacher Report, I also write for This Given Sunday and Sportable. See, I really like football, and you just made it to the end of a football writer's bio.

Apparently Winston, Mariota, and Cooper did their deals like right after the draft. I was confused about this so I looked more into it. Turns out why I always saw certain players in NCAA wearing Beats shit on TV is because they're ""gifted"" and pretty much your popularity/exposure determined the value of the gift package you got. So yeah I was wrong on that part. I always thought the rule against endorsements for college players was stupid so I just assumed maybe they changed it since I always saw Jameis and certain other players wearing Beats shit in certain situations, lol.

Does anyone else remember the over the top fluff piece The 100 Days of Lovie that the Buccaneers did last year? Here are some notable quotes:   This is unmistakably Lovie Smith's team now.  In 100 days, he and General Manager Jason Licht have reshaped the roster and rewired the culture at One Buccaneer Place...On paper, it looks like a step in the right direction…or a dozen steps, really.    ...   The Buccaneers' day of reckoning won't come due for another five months, but Smith will have his team ready when it does.  He has laid the groundwork during these first 100 days.   ...   ""We just decided that we couldn't ask our fans to be patient anymore,"" said Smith.  ""We needed to do whatever we could to win now, and we felt like we had a plan that would work.  We weren't going to sit back and wait.  We were going to attack this, and the fans were going to see that we were serious about making this team better right away.   I could go on but I think you get the point.  edit: I am not saying that Jameis does not study film all of the time or whatever. I am saying that we are going to have a lot of Jameis smoke blown up our asses for the next few months."
buccaneers,37dfil,TrueBuccaneersFan,5,Tue May 26 21:26:33 2015 UTC,And then we lost our OC and the rest is history
buccaneers,37dfil,ApolloXLII,0,Tue May 26 21:50:02 2015 UTC,"I think you and I have discussed this before but I do not see that as a viable excuse for the shit show we put on the field. There was nothing from stopping Lovie from hiring another OC or even promoting from within. Leslie Frasier used to be a head coach. He could have stepped in that position if nothing else. But to give the offensive coordinator duties to a rookie assistant straight out of college to do as a part time role simply screams poor decision making, IMHO. Either that or a total disdain for anything on the offensive side of the ball (which blowing up our oline would make an objective observer seriously question). The least Lovie could have done was relieve Arroyo from his quarterback coaching duties and made him full time OC. But he failed to even do that.  Leadership and coaching is about handling adversity. Players get hurt, arrested, suspended, etc. Coaches get hurt, arrested, suspended, etc. Shit happens. It is how you handle the adversity that shows leadership. Anybody can do well if everything goes right."
buccaneers,37dfil,TrueBuccaneersFan,1 point,Tue May 26 22:31:36 2015 UTC,"There was nothing from stopping Lovie from hiring another OC or even promoting from within.   They did, they promoted the QB coach. And for awhile it was only supposed to be for a period of time until Tedford returned. And it's not like you can just go out and find some competent coordinator just waiting for a job literally right before the regular season starts.  Also, your defensive coordinator is NEVER going to take over offensive coordinator duties. It doesn't happen.  Look, hindsight is always 20/20 and from your computer chair/couch/toilet, it's easy to think ""oh well we had the worst record last season, so that means each choice that was made was just the wrong one and they should have done this and that instead."" We don't know what was going on in the locker room, in the meeting rooms, and in Lovie and Lichts offices. These guys get paid millions upon millions of dollars to dedicate their lives to their job. I'll trust their judgement, or at least trust their abilities to identify where they fucked up and attempt to correct their mistakes. I'm giving last season the benefit of the doubt because it's the first year for a brand new regime. I did the same with Schiano and Morris."
buccaneers,37dfil,ApolloXLII,2,Wed May 27 00:59:01 2015 UTC,"They did, they promoted the QB coach.   Arroyo was never promoted to Offensive Coordinator. He called plays during game day ""with input from the rest of the offensive staff"" but his official job was always quarterbacks coach. Tedford was not released as the Offensive Coordinator until December 5th, 2014. Arroyo was doing both Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks coach duties but kept his title as Quarterbacks Coach.    And it's not like you can just go out and find some competent coordinator just waiting for a job literally right before the regular season starts.   We did it in 2009. Morris fired Jeff Jagodzinski before the last preseason game. We then hired Greg Olson who coached as the OC for the Bucs for 3 years.   I'm giving last season the benefit of the doubt because it's the first year for a brand new regime. I did the same with Schiano and Morris.   Understandable. My fear is that when we suck again this year everyone is going to be making excuses again (I already have heard people saying it is okay if we suck this year because of a rookie quarterback and all) and then this becomes a thing for a decade."
buccaneers,37dfil,ApolloXLII,1 point,Wed May 27 01:47:28 2015 UTC,"Greg Olson was the QB coach and got promoted, I thought. and i thought Bates was fired at the beginning of the preseason. Either way, why would they go looking for an OC if you are having your QB coach step in temporarily while holding the job for when he gets back? I think it got to a point where Tedford took so long to come back that at that point, Lovie was just done. Maybe things were said behind closed doors that we don't know about. I don't know. All I know is that they were left without an OC that they thought was coming back.  And believe me I am just as scared of more shit fest this upcoming season, but I see a lot of things to be optimistic about. I said the same thing after Schiano and Morris' first years. I want to see progression and positive things to build upon. I don't have to see them win the NFC South next season to be happy. I want to see a team that has made big improvements from last season and leave me believing the Bucs are on the up and up and have a bright future.  Basically what it boils down to is I am a life-long Bucs fan. Yeah, we've been pretty shitty since the glory days, but I'm not going anywhere. So since that's the case, I'd rather be optimistic and look forward to what I believe is a bright future, than be scared of shit going south."

But what I am saying is that there is nothing here to indicate this is totally all marketing. I didn't see any Bucs gear and Beats and Microsoft don't have any interest in some joint PR stunt when they already have the NFL and players to do all the advertising they need.

Let's not crown Lovie the master re-builder just yet.   And speaking of re-building, why are we doing that? In 2013 every single analyst, media outlet, pundit, announcer, and fan said that we had playoff caliber talent. Lovie was brought in, not to re-build, but to win now with this very talented team. Now, there are growing pains because we are re-building? I think there is a serious disconnect here that nobody is addressing."
buccaneers,37axlq,TrueBuccaneersFan,2,Tue May 26 16:46:32 2015 UTC,Growing pains are going to happen any time you have a rookie QB.  The same analysts you're talking about say Jameis is one of the best pro prospects in years.  Are you saying we should've stood pat with McCown and his trusty giraffe sidekick?
buccaneers,37axlq,Landlubber77,2,Tue May 26 16:50:25 2015 UTC,"The same analysts you're talking about say Jameis is one of the best pro prospects in years.    This does not bother you that the same analysts that predicted wrongly that we were going to the moon last year are now predicting that Jameis is one of the best pro prospects in years? How wrong do people have to be before we stop listening and repeating them?  It still does not answer the question as to what happened between 2013 and 2014. Everyone said we had an extremely talented team. Everyone. The reason we got rid of Gap Tooth was because he was not utilizing the playoff caliber talent on the team correctly. Remember the bruhaha over how he was using Revis? How he was running stunts that did not let McCoy ""rush straight for the quarterback""? I have a list of about 50 articles where people are quoted as saying coaching was the problem in 2013, not talent. We brought Lovie in to win with that talent. Something went drastically wrong somewhere."

buccaneers,37axlq,TrueBuccaneersFan,1 point,Tue May 26 20:21:00 2015 UTC,Okay but your original comment to me was saying Lovie made a mistake by going against the conventional wisdom and rebuilding when the media said this team was on the verge with the pieces we already had.  It sounded like you agreed with the media.  You did an about face in your very next comment.  In contradicting yourself I now have no idea where you actually stand besides the fact that you will apparently disagree with anything I say even if in doing so you completely reverse your own position.
buccaneers,37axlq,Landlubber77,1 point,Tue May 26 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"..you will apparently disagree with anything I say even if in doing so you completely reverse your own position.   I have no idea who you are so it is nothing personal.  In 2013, the media said that we needed to run our coach out of town because he under-performed with a talent laden team. Last year at the beginning of the season they said that Michael Johnson, Collins, McCown, etc. were the keys we needed to win. Those players were going to take us over the top along with Lovie. When that failed the media then said that our team under-performed because of a lack of talent. Now they are saying that Jameis, Koetter, Marpet, etc. are the keys we need to take us over the top. Do you see where I am going there?  The media flip flopped with its assessment of our team last year. It went from ""the Bucs are talent laden"" to ""the Bucs have a lot of holes"" in a single year. This happened because everyone thought that Lovie was going to come in and take us to the top but when he failed miserably they had to scramble and find excuses. Instead of blaming Lovie, as they should have, but would not because it would make them all look like buffoons, they then turned the narrative from ""win now with all this talent"" to ""rebuilding mode because of a lack of talent"".  I preach a great deal about how the media spins things and manipulates the narrative but it does truly baffle me at how nobody seems to recall how less than a year ago we were heralded as a supremely talented team. Now, after Lovie shit the bed, our team mysteriously lacks talent. In one season it was the coach's fault and in the next it is the player's fault. It is cognitive dissonance on a grand scale.  The narrative being pushed now is that Lovie cannot do wrong. All failures are due to other people. Nobody criticizes his decisions even though he has made some terrible ones (McCown, Tedford, Collins, Johnson, time outs, etc.). Everyone he hires is lauded as a great hire. Everyone he drafts is applauded. Every trade he makes is greeted with a nod of the head. And fans go right along with it. Koetter is the perfect example because I am at a total loss as to why anyone thinks he is any good other than the media telling them that he is good. He is average at best. His history shows that. Swearinger is the only signing we have done, IMHO, that is worth a crap and he probably will not even make the roster because he is not the type of character that Lovie likes.  I was not going against you with my statements but merely pointing out how the media is changing the narrative underneath our feet. I do not think it is beneficial to us, as fans, to digest everything the media puts out simply because they are saying it. A great deal of it is written with agendas and bias.   As an aside, I think Lovie picked Jameis because he had no choice. I think the last thing that Lovie ever wanted was a rookie quarterback. Pile on the possible character issues and I am sure that Lovie would have ran if he could have. Lovie has never coached a rookie quarterback. That is its own bag of worms. But Lovie had no choice. I think the fan base would have rioted if Jameis was not the pick and he knew it. That is speculation on my part and just thought I would throw it in there."
buccaneers,37axlq,TrueBuccaneersFan,5,Tue May 26 22:19:13 2015 UTC,"there's a video at the bottom analyzing Jameis at the rose bowl and at the end of the video the guy straight up says ""I'll take this bucs squad with Winston against any team in the NFC"" gets me excited for this season!"
buccaneers,37axlq,beniro,3,Tue May 26 07:43:29 2015 UTC,"I think that all of the skill position groups have improved, at least just through some consistency. We have some new rookie weapons at wr, and we have a 2nd year player entering the season healthy for the first time at te and rb. I think it is reasonable to think that asj will be a contributor, and I think that we will cut a decent rb. I just hope Martin and Sims develop.   I think the question mark is going through  be how fast Winston and the OL come together. I am really hoping that Winston's leadership helps in this area. That, coupled with actually having an oc? We should be significantly better for that reason alone.   I think this offense will occasionally put up a lot of points... And at times make mistakes. Aka, better than last year, but a year away, given some struggles on the OL. And we still may need a TE or rb next year."
buccaneers,37axlq,Emloaf,2,Tue May 26 13:16:53 2015 UTC,"Having an Actual OC and how quickly Jameis is diving into the playbook has me excited we'll watch a decent product on the field offensively. there will definitely be mistakes, but those mistakes are understandable from a rookie QB  not when their from a ""veteran"" one"
buccaneers,37axlq,fletch420man,3,Tue May 26 13:28:49 2015 UTC,"As someone who's not a Bucs fan. A lot better. Personally I see them being a lot like the Falcons last year. You'll have a very strong passing game with Winston throwing to Evan and V-Jax, but the rest of the team probably won't be able to keep up. That being said, I really like who you picked up for the O-Line and you guys have some great defensive pieces, so I could see this team being even better than that and competitive for a winning record. That would be the best case scenario where everything goes right though."
buccaneers,37axlq,BucJason,2,Thu May 28 15:07:31 2015 UTC,"They will be solid middle of the pack better- we should plan to see some inconsistency with so many new starters.

The design, apart specifically from the logo & fonts, was tasteful & fairly innovative. The same, I feel, could be said for the new unis in general, but I think they stretched too far with the number design. I understand that designers want to try new things, this is essential to the creative process after all, but it l they just don't work. The rest of the design I like. A bit more ""flash"" than the 90s design, but overall it was tweaked rather well.   These are just my opinions, of course."

buccaneers,379ccx,Red_Pan-Duh,1 point,Tue May 26 16:13:48 2015 UTC,Personally I would rank the Bucs unis dead last. Arizona and Bengals unis are sharp as hell. I would rank quite a few other unis as far worse than those. The Jags unis are a little bit of a mess. But still not as bad as the Bucs current uniform.   I hated the creamsicle unis but I would take those in a second over the current uniform. Bruce and all. The current uniform is a color mess. And the numbers man. Why do I want to look at uniforms with alrm clock numbers on them? Those are the worst numbers in my life. Why would I want to see them anywhere else? In particular on a damn Sunday!
buccaneers,379ccx,jeff_says_relax,1 point,Tue May 26 16:39:32 2015 UTC,"""The current uniform is a color mess""  Very true. Not a lot of people actually mention this. The so called ""pewter"" looks black, and black does not freakin' go with ORANGE. And orange socks? People always get excited about when we have orange included in the unis because it's part of our old history, which is understandable. But I always associate it with when we were a laughingstock under Culverhouse. Less of that and just stick with red, white and pewter."
buccaneers,379ccx,Congzilla,1 point,Tue May 26 18:05:13 2015 UTC,My only complaint at all is I think that the helmets should be done in the finish the Vikings use with the pewter color of the pants.

buccaneers,37013q,selfcitymonster,5,Sun May 24 23:07:19 2015 UTC,"Oh I understand dude. I'm just pointing out that while the Ravens may have had a good reason to not have a home game opener, I can't think of one for the Bucs. Granted, I prefer the way things happening, beating Philly at home AGAIN closing out the old stadium and bringing in the new stadium with LOSSES! Awesome little sports trivia for a Bucs fan, but you know the NFL media wanted Philly to win both games. The Bucs always get snubbed."

buccaneers,37013q,TheChrisDez,7,Sat May 23 17:09:17 2015 UTC,". PO'd since then.   Justifiably so, man. I mean that super bowl is our organizations (so far) only win. I don't know why the NFL network would just brush that under the rug or not even show their audience that game. Pretty sketchy if you ask me."

buccaneers,36uh42,OptimusPrimeTime21,1 point,Fri May 22 12:35:39 2015 UTC,"Right. Tampa weather doesn't help the cause either. Still, I hope he does stay healthy, we need production at TE."
buccaneers,36uh42,Rorrexx44,3,Fri May 22 12:40:55 2015 UTC,Tampa weather doesn't help the cause either   Hot and humid makes an athlete more injury prone???  Never heard that one before...
buccaneers,36uh42,Jowlsey,2,Sat May 23 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"Dude Tampa, and really just South Florida in general, is just a different type of heat than compared to anywhere else in the country. Draining is an understatement. If you don't stay hydrated you don't stay out in said heat long... and that's a GOD DAM FACT boii lol  Also, I can't tell if you're restating what I said just because or being sarcastic."

buccaneers,36uh42,Rorrexx44,2,Sat May 23 19:35:31 2015 UTC,"You have to think that Koetter's plan will be to use ASJ much in the same way he used Tony Gonzalez. The cool thing about the Four Verticals attack, Koetter's bread and butter, is it's adjustable depending on coverage and available personnel.  I'm curious to see what personnel package her prefers to run that attack. I suppose a Posse/11 (3 WR-1 TE-1 RB) set with Louis Murphy in the slot, ASJ at TE and Martin in the backfield is most likely. If both ASJ and Brandon Myers stay healthy and impress during camp we could see them rely on a lot of Ace/12 (2 WR-2 TE-1 RB) sets. With as good of a receiver as Simms is we could even see Four Verts run out of a Regular/21 (2 WR-1 TE-2 RB) formation with either Iosefa or Stocker (possibly as a H-back) lining up in the backfield with Simms. Regardless of which package is preferred, the TE's will be very important. It will be interesting to see which players are favored and how the offense comes together during camp."
buccaneers,36uh42,jaemarl,1 point,Fri May 22 16:32:21 2015 UTC,Depending on what happens in camp we could see Bell as the 3rd WR in a 3-1 set.
buccaneers,36uh42,Mr-Mills,1 point,Wed May 27 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"He has the speed so he will get reps in the slot during camp, no doubt. I haven't seen much of him lining up on the inside and he seems a little stiff so it will be interesting to see how it goes. My hunch is they will want to keep him on the outside as an insurance policy this year and VJax's replacement next year."

buccaneers,36riza,LansdowneStreet,8,Thu May 21 15:46:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say its miserable being a Bucs fan but it is really hard.  Even the best teams have periods where they are not dominant and trying to find their identity again, look at the Cowboys.  The difference between the Bucs and those teams though is a lack of culture starting from the owner down.  Culverhouse was the worst and when the Glazers bought the team we had a chance to change that culture.  You had a new owner, got new uniforms, new coach and new attitude.  From the owner to the fans you knew things were going in the right direction and you were excited.  When Malcolm took a smaller role in the team and the children took over it shifted again.  Instead of continuing that culture and building on it they stopped spending, made bad decisions on the direction of the team and went out of their way to ignore the fan base.    I have been a Bucs fan since 1985 and will always be a fan.  I just want the culture back that we had from 95-2004."
buccaneers,36riza,Mordback,4,Thu May 21 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Well that's what the organization seems to be trying to do; to get back to 1997.  My point is that Bucs fans seem to wear this on our sleeves more than almost anyone else, including several objectively worse organizations.  There have been lots of bad times, nobody's disputing that, but at a certain point I'm kind of hoping for some outsider to say ""boo fucking hoo, team with six division titles, three NFCCG appearances, three Hall of Famers with one or two more in waiting, two of the best defensive players in football right now, a Super Bowl ring, and cannons in your stadium."""
buccaneers,36riza,LansdowneStreet,3,Thu May 21 17:00:22 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with that.  I think most of those fans though are people that came on board after the SuperBowl.
buccaneers,36riza,Mordback,2,Thu May 21 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"i'm confused...the Bucs won a super bowl (they have a perfect super bowl record).  Are you saying you root for teams who have never won a super bowl? (like the Lions?)  and that Bucs fans complain too much, considering we have a Lombardi trophy?  Just trying to understand.  (NOTE: I've been a Bucs fan since 1983, and I agree fans complain too much....pre 1996 our image, record, organization and output were generally horrible)"
buccaneers,36riza,Qbert_Spuckler,-1,Thu May 21 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"Are you saying you root for teams who have never won a super bowl?    No, I'm saying that if I were a fan of the Lions/Browns/Eagles/et cetera, I would be so very tired of hearing Buccaneers fans lament their terrible history.    I'm also not trying to sugarcoat the Bucs' history.  The bad times have been really bad, and there have been a lot of them.  But, football is a sport about results, and our end results actually look pretty okay.  Six division championships (three in the Central, three in the South), three appearances in the NFC Championship Game (and both losses were close games), three members of the Hall of Fame with Barber and possibly Lynch still on the way, two defensive player of the year awards (79 and 2002), a defense with McCoy and David on it, a defensive coverage set and an entire defensive philosophy both named after the team, and Super Bowl XXXVII.    In terms of overall winning percentage there's no denying how bad the Bucs have been at many times in our history.  But in terms of the end result?  We're not exactly looking at an empty trophy case.    Look around rNFL.  Browns fans, Bills fans, Lions fans, some of the teams who have truly been through football Hell without the benefits we've had, none of them bitch about their organization as much or as often as we do.  If you were one of them, wouldn't you hate us for that?  I would.    Sure, 2002 is a while back now.  Yeah, it could easily have been better with a few breaks and a few less Culverhouse moves.  Of course.  But let's stop acting like no other NFL team has had it worse when, honestly, lots of teams haven't had it any better."
buccaneers,36riza,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Thu May 21 21:10:05 2015 UTC,"I think the reason it's is so painful is because we suffered through the dregs and then we got a taste of the life we wanted. And then as quickly as it came it was snatched away from us and now we are back at the very very bottom trying to claw our way up. Lions fans are a sad bunch, especially if they still live in Detroit, but they had Barry sanders so it's not like they've never had anything to root for and now Calvin Johnson, at least they're bright spots are exciting playmakers, defense just isn't as sexy. The Eagles are one of the most consistent franchise of the last 20 years including Randall cunningham Michael Vick and the entire Andy reed era, no super bowl but way more fun to watch, and now with chip Kelley at least their fans are always entertained. The Browns haven't had any success in my life time but the way their fans have been dragged around the block does make me feel sorry for them. And   More recent expansion teams obviously don't count. I think the most frustrating part is knowing that owners are incompetent and knowing that 98% of our success came from Malcolm making one good hire and one good decision while everything else they have done has been mediocre if not detrimental to the organization, we have no consistency so we have no reason to ever expect things will turn out well, our only hope right now is that our 2-14 ""savior"" lovie smith, who has well documented struggles with the offensive aspect of the game can turn the same 2-14 team into winner with the addition of the #1 overall QB. I'd actually bet you money that the lions Eagles and Browns all have better records than us next season."
buccaneers,36riza,FEO4,1 point,Fri May 22 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"Offense over defense is a matter of preference.  I'm glad the best players we've ever had are almost exclusively defensive players.  So what if morons didn't appreciate Derrick Brooks?  I got to.  And Ronde, Lynch, Sapp, Hardy Nickerson, unfortunately Selmon was just a little bit before my time.  Now we've got Lavonte David and Gerald McCoy, who remind me of those old teams, and so what if we're not hanging arena ball scores up like some other teams?   I'd actually bet you money that the lions Eagles and Browns all have better records than us next season.   You're so aggressive at any hint of any optimism here, like it's out of place or something.  I'm never going to really get that."
buccaneers,36riza,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Fri May 22 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be aggressive but I also don't think many people would take bet, it's just realistic. Also I'm not saying it's a bad thing that we have been historically defensive but I think what makes our lows so much lower, is that our high wasn't that high because it wasn't exciting. Do you ever think back on all those beautiful three and outs we forced in critical situations? No, but I'm sure you remember rondes pick six. Why? Because points were scored. Just as influential as simply continuing to force three and outs but twice as exciting, now imagine if we ever had a memorable play on offense. I quite literally cannot think of one significant offensive play in our teams history (other than warren sapp catching a td and then doing the Beyoncé) Even the steelers who have won both offensively and defensively in the past and recent remember Lynn swan catches and Franco Harris before jack lambert hits and mean how's tackles for loss, both equally sexy in my opinion, but this is the case for most casual fans I believe. Also as recently as the Super Bowl against the cardinals, there were two historical plays, the 98yd Harrison pick 6 and the Holmes catch, but which is more remembered by causal fans? Which u have to remember is the majority, most of us on this sub are the minority of slightly more avid fans. Our glory days produced very few highlights compared to that of other teams. Also supporting the offense over defense mentality of the majority of fans is how desperately we want a ""franchise"" QB , there was a large faction of fans even on here that were so deafened by their own buffoonery that they wanted us to draft Johnny FUCKING football. Now we finally get a QB and suddenly there are rainbows everywhere and our 2-14 coach is definitely the guy, right? Even though we really did not go out of our way to fill ANY of the other remaining holes, We'll see.   The above paragraph really only apply to fans who learned football from ESPN, which is most in my opinion. But the brevity of our peak also has to play a huge role, although I think that falls into the inconsistent franchise (AKA terrible ownership) category, which is the real reason that being a bucs fan is painful for me. But, much like a poltergeist, I'm sure being a bucs fan has a way of getting under everyone's skin from a slightly different angle. I do admire your optimism though..."
buccaneers,36riza,FEO4,0,Sat May 23 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"Now we finally get a QB and suddenly there are rainbows everywhere and our 2-14 coach is definitely the guy, right?   My faith in Lovie Smith has absolutely nothing to do with Jameis Winston, of whom I am reserving any judgment until he's played meaningful NFL games.  You know that defense we're talking about? He was part of creating it.  And he's been good with it in the past.  So am I banking my hopes on us rebuilding the last great team we had, this time presumably with a more consistent offense?  Shit yes, that's exactly what my hopes are riding on.     Even though we really did not go out of our way to fill ANY of the other remaining holes   I'm going to say Bruce Carter, Henry Melton, and signing enough safeties to rotate them out based on who's playing well at the moment filled some holes.  Oh, and we drafted two linemen, so at least we'll have new starters there though who knows how good draftees ever are.  But you knew about all those guys, so I'm sure you've just decided they're not good.  I expect this team to improve next season.  Period.  And that's all I really can reasonably demand at this point.  Improvement that isn't just winning the toss-up games we might have won last year despite how bad the team was.  So 6+ wins.  Or I will be upset.    But if I preached patience all year last year and talked about evaluating coaches based on how they improve or step back from year to year, I can't go back on that now.  No matter how much a handful of people here utterly despise Lovie Smith."
buccaneers,36riza,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"Bruce carter and Henry Melton could be great additions but that's assuming they can transition seamlessly into new positions in less than one season. They are also the only additions we made other than the draft, which I'm pretty sure is mandatory for all teams. Meaning we put about as much effort into improving the talent on our roster as the patriots did. That's what I mean by not going out of our way to fill our holes. I know trades and free agency have screwed us over in the past but so has drafting a QB #1 and the exact same ""we have to take a shot mentality"" has to apply there as well."
buccaneers,36riza,FEO4,0,Sat May 23 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I'm not talking about our quarterback.  I don't believe in college football or quarterback worship, so we won't know what this guy is until a while into the season if then.  And I don't know if he'll be ""saving us"" so much as Evans and Jackson will be bailing out a rookie and helping him grow.  At least hopefully.  With a strong dose of Logan Mankins sharing tips he picked up in New England.   Meaning we put about as much effort into improving the talent on our roster as the patriots did.   TO BE FAIR, scandal aside, is it really a bad idea to emulate the team every NFL fan should be wishing their team was more like right now?  But the defense?  I can buy that.  Melton's not moving to DE, he's playing the same position he already played.  Carter's moving to Mike, but he's playing in the same scheme he played in last year (Dallas runs a variant of the same defense we do) and is known to be effective in zone, so he'll likely be an improvement over our previous middle linebacker who didn't know what a play action was."

However, I started worrying about the amount of interceptions he's thrown and his decision making.   I watched all the tape breakdowns he did with Steve Mariucci, John Gruden etc. and started understanding why he was forcing the ball to Rashad Greene. I read about Eli Manning and Matt Ryan throwing interceptions in their last college year and had it coached out of them and became less worried about the interceptions and decision making.   At this point, his Leadership qualities are unquestioned, his decision making will definitely improve, and I am not worried about him off the field at all.

buccaneers,36mrtb,FEO4,2,Wed May 20 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I expect this defense to make the leap.    Also, it needs to.  The offense is full of young, talented players who will develop much better if they aren't expected to hang 30 points a week on the board.  Need to give a rookie quarterback margin for error, especially a quarterback who is not afraid to throw an errant pass.  But the best players on the team are defensive players.  The coach is a defensive coach.  If this team is going to go anywhere, the defense needs to make the leap.  Because that's the only way to show that the system works.  (Yes, I realize it's Maddenese to say ""the only way to show a system works is for the system to work,"" but that doesn't make it any less true.)"
buccaneers,36mrtb,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Wed May 20 15:50:42 2015 UTC,I am really nervous that with all these rotational guys if we go against a paced offense like the Eagles can we keep up with them?
buccaneers,36mrtb,AerialAces,1 point,Wed May 20 23:59:31 2015 UTC,That is definitely an issue with a rotation-style defense
buccaneers,36mrtb,FEO4,1 point,Thu May 21 00:54:21 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm more concerned about the defensive backfield than you are because I don't think we have one starter quality safety besides mcdougald and he is relatively unproven. Teams passed on us at will last year, the only reason we didn't give up more yards is because teams rarely finished the game with their starters in against us, and if they did it was only to run the ball and run out time because they had a comfortable lead. I think IF our offense does improve it will put more pressure on the db's to keep teams from scoring points and I really don't think our db's are good enough, sure we are deep but are they any good? Not really. Otherwise I think our defense has improved id still prefer if we had a big run stuffing linebacker though."
buccaneers,36mrtb,TrueBuccaneersFan,2,Wed May 20 15:59:03 2015 UTC,"Teams passed on us at will last year, the only reason we didn't give up more yards is because teams rarely finished the game with their starters in against us, and if they did it was only to run the ball and run out time because they had a comfortable lead.   Holy shit I just looked into this and you are right. There were only 5 games (!) last year where we had a positive or close to .5 win probability in the 4th quarter! In 11 games we had close to no chance of winning by the 4th quarter. Damn. I figured it was bad but not that bad.  Source (this only shows the BAL game and win probability but you can look at all of the boxscores from last year and get the info)  edit: my numbers might be off a bit but the point still stands that there was way too many games where we were out of it by the 4th quarter."

It should be interesting to see what close-minded, empty-headed nonsense you respond with this time, because Lord knows you will. You can't not, no matter how demonstrably wrong you are.

Another Lovie apologist come to defend his hero. Schiano wins more games, has more close games against better opponents, yet Lovie is somehow a better coach. That makes a ton of sense.  Something like 13 games our opponents went into the 4th quarter with the lead, but, hey, you spin it how you want. We were so competitive last year that they gave us the #1 pick for effort."
buccaneers,36mrtb,TrueBuccaneersFan,-3,Thu May 21 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"I would take this guys speculations with a grain of salt. This is the same guy that was an extremely vocal lobbyist to get Schiano fired and Lovie hired. He predicted that Lovie was going to make us a much better team last year. He is now a Lovie apologist. He also said that Collins and Michael Johnson were good upgrades last year (boy did that turn out to be a failure). He has been predicting that Gholston is going to ""break out"" for the past two years even though Gholston had the perfect opportunity to ""break out"" last yearbut failed. He is also a Steve White acolyte and Steve White is one of the worst analysts and prognosticator I have ever seen. If this guy thinks we are going to have a top 10 defense then we are probably going to somehow be 33rd."

""That's what gets you excited. There are some things that we can build (upon). And we expect the guys who are coming back to really improve. So many of them who were so young a year ago and being young in the system, we have high hopes.""   Hmm...  The Buttmad Schiano man is still buttmad.  Dude Schiano is a memory.  Get over it already.  Plus, we got the 1st overall draft pick and Winston to build around.  Better than Mr. I take 500 sacks Glennon who Schiano had wood for.  The Bucs were 25th in the league in total points last season - that's including the prime time debacle.  If you look at the last 10 games they averaged 22.7 PPG given up which would put them at 17th roughly.  So yeah I think they'll be a couple spots better than that in 2015 at least - possibly even more.  Remember last year, when everyone laughed hard at Dallas's D? They jumped to 15.  The Tampa 2 takes time to install.    Oh yeah and one more thing.  I'm high on Gholston - I have been for a couple of seasons.  He has prototypical size and athleticism you want at DE and he's coachable.   ""Once he really figures it out and starts to put it all together, it could get scary,"" tackle Gerald McCoy said. ""He's a really big guy who has one of the best long arms I've ever seen when he uses it right. Just a big, physical guy, and he's more athletic than people think. He's willing to learn. If you say something to him, he'll hear you out. That's why I believe he will get better and he will be good for a long time.""   More from the article you linked:   Bucs defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier reiterated Thursday that the change at end was prompted by Smith's breakout play rather than anything Gholston had done and his confidence in the young lineman is strong moving forward. Gholston is tied for fourth on the team with six tackles for loss, twice what he totaled as a rookie.   Gholston is the best run stopping DE on the team.  He'll get his opportunities.  He won't languish on the sideline or be inactive.  It takes time for DEs to breakout.  Greg Hardy broke out in year 3 with 11 sacks after only having 3.0 and 4.0 in the two years prior.  You'll find quite a few guys who it took 2-4 years to break into double digit sack territory.  I think the guy has the chance to be a complete player instead of being just a pass rush or run stop specialist.  Remember when he was drafted he was considered to be a real raw prospect and by the end of 2013 he earned a starters job.  Then, he basically got beat out by Smith last season who got hot after the bye.  Smith has earned the starter's job (even though he was a total non-factor in the last two games of the season), but you've heard in the press already - on the other side Johnson is expected to be rotational.  I just think of all the DEs on the roster Will Gholston has the highest ceiling.  The guy is only 23 still going into year three.  He's no lock to breakout, but I think at some point he will.  If you look at what the Bucs did this off season defensively.  They didn't look to add impact players.  They added depth.  They have the 8th youngest team in the league and those guys will be a year better.  Yeah, I think they'll be better than last year.  Lastly, Steve White's browned up TP forgot more football than you know, Mr. ""I haz a blog"".  The guy won't dignify your criticism, because he doesn't want to punch down on fans.  When you play football in the NFL and then land a paid gig afterwards writing about the team, then the smack you talk will be a little more credible."
buccaneers,36mrtb,TrueBuccaneersFanToo,0,Thu May 21 02:20:30 2015 UTC,"Dude Schiano is a memory. Get over it already.   Maybe you should go and tell this dude that. Oh, wait, you won't because of circle jerking."
buccaneers,36mrtb,TrueBuccaneersFan,2,Thu May 21 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"I'm hardly a homer on this board.    In hindsight, it was too much for any of us to expect Lovie to superimpose the Tampa 2 base scheme on a defense formerly suited personnel wise for blitz and tight man coverage defensive philosophies.  There were definitely growing pains, but towards the end of the year, outside the game vs Detroit, the defense came together a bit more.  I have more confidence that they'll build upon what they did last year and continue to improve.  What I like about Lovie is that he has a full buy-in from the locker room and players like to play for him.  At the same time, he doesn't have a reputation for being lax or having undisciplined teams - at least not on defense.  His track record suggests that he's a competent defensive coach.  That coupled with what I've already mentioned in this and previous posts gives rationale for improvement on defense."
buccaneers,36mrtb,TrueBuccaneersFan,3,Thu May 21 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"Get outta here buddy. We are always going to suck and never have a chance with Lovie. You know why? He's not Schiano. The guy has no clue how to run a football team. He stays out of the locker room, he doesn't spy on the players, he doesn't attack opponents knee in the victory formation, he doesn't even belittle and berate the veterans like college kids. If Lovie is not careful his players will actually want to play for him. Just be thankful you have a guy like TrueBuccaneersFan around to sat you straight and challenge the status quo. A lot of you guys use facts and common sense, not my man TBF. All he needs is perfect hindsight, repetition of the same argument and a relentless need to get the last word. Some say that he's petty and is completely beating a dead horse with his pro-Schiano, anti-Lovie bullshit, but I say no way. Making the same statement over and over and over merely reinforces it. The same people that don't like him are probably think McCoy doesn't suck."
buccaneers,36mrtb,TrueBuccaneersFan,-1,Fri May 22 01:50:50 2015 UTC,"You sure do a lot of talking. Talk is cheap. Anyone can spout opinions. I like facts.  Fact #1: Lovie sucked last year worse than sucky ass gap toothed Schiano. In order to tie Schiano's record with the Bucs, Lovie must go 9-7 this year. That is simply to tie what Schiano did in two years. If you are going to claim that Schiano sucked then the math says that Lovie sucks worse. 2-14 with such an easy ass schedule is embarrassing.  Fact #2: Simply because Steve White played football at one time and now writes about football does not mean he is any good at what he does. I am going to just quote a few things from this article he wrote before the season started last year.   Since the Tampa Bay Buccaneers hired Lovie Smith as head coach this spring, I've been banging the drum saying that they would be a playoff team this season.   ...   Somehow, some way the Buccaneers were able to trade for the Patriots' six-time Pro Bowl, five-time All-Pro guard Logan Mankins in exchange for tight end Tim Wright and a fourth-round draft pick. The price might seem a bit steep at first glance, until you consider how much of an upgrade Mankins will be. Plus, with rookie second-round pick Austin Seferian-Jenkins, free agent addition Brandon Myers and holdover Luke Stocker, the Bucs have a ton of tight end talent even with Wright gone. It was more than worth it.   ...   The Bucs are going to have a beast of a defense this year, barring injury. Write it down, take a picture, I don't give a f###.    ...   Just imagine the kind of crazy numbers [McCoy] is about to put on the board this season in Smith's defense that is going to allow him to hunt quarterbacks for all four quarters of every single game.    ...   Safeties Mark Barron and Dashon Goldson are also better fits for this defense.   ...   Other holdovers like linebackers Mason Foster and Jonathan Casillas should also thrive with better coaching. There just aren't any weak links on the first team.   ...   The Bucs also signed former Bengals defensive end Michael Johnson. He and Adrian Clayborn are going to make sure that when opposing quarterbacks try to step away from McCoy's rush, they go from the frying pan into the fire.   ...   And don't forget about Doug Martin, Bobby Rainey and Mike James running the ball, because having to keep your safeties back to look for the pass is also going to open up lanes up front.   ...   I do not believe last season in Chicago was an aberration for Josh McCown. It took him longer than most quarterbacks to really fully understand the game and how to play the quarterback position, but everything about the way he carries himself on the field these days tells me he ""gets it"" now.   ...   Let me tell you a secret that if the other 31 teams don't know yet, it's one that they'll understand in just a few weeks: shit is about to get real when it comes to lining up against the Buccaneers. Lovie Smith's Bucs are made for two things, kicking ass and chewing bubble gum and I heard there's a shortage on Hubba Bubba in the Bay area.   So, yeah, you go ahead and keep circle jerking with Steve White. Neither one of you are ever right about shit.  And, btw, this right here:   Plus, we got the 1st overall draft pick and Winston to build around.    is not a prize to brag about. We got the 1st overall draft pick because we were the worst team in the league. It is not something to be proud of."
buccaneers,36mrtb,TrueBuccaneersFan,2,Thu May 21 03:56:41 2015 UTC,"It all boils down to one thing -   Either you believe the Tampa 2 defense is a year long project to install and it gets worse before it gets better...  Or...  You believe Lovie has no idea what he's doing, the players all suck and the franchise will continue to slide down the shitter"
buccaneers,36mrtb,LansdowneStreet,-1,Thu May 21 16:27:40 2015 UTC,...the Tampa 2 defense is a year long project to install and it gets worse before it gets better   Funny how absolutely nobody said this before the season and before we started getting our asses handed to us. This is an excuse that Lovie apologists use.
buccaneers,36mrtb,TrueBuccaneersFan,2,Thu May 21 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"You predicted the league's worst defense.  You running psyops here or something?  What's the answer genius? Fire Lovie?  You that upset about having Winston, two 2nd rd OTs, Mike Evans, ASJ, Koetter as OC & the Tampa 2 back in Tampa?  No reason for optimism? None at all?"
buccaneers,36mrtb,LansdowneStreet,0,Thu May 21 19:26:48 2015 UTC,"No reason for optimism? None at all?   No, not really. Swearinger is the only good signing I have seen and I would be surprised if he is going to make the team.  Winston, at best, has a 50/50 chance at being a bust. Nobody knows how he is going to respond to being an NFL player. I was not that impressed with his college performance anyhow. He could be an okay quarterback but my money would be on him not being a Buc in 4 years.  The two 2nd round lineman are not impressive at all. Marpet? What do you know about him other than the media hyping him? Nothing, that is what you know. He is a total unknown to everybody. Small and coming from a small school. Wow, he puts up good stats at the combine and plays okay in the Senior Bowl (that our illustrious leader decided to not coach). Donovan Smith? meh. He will probably get his ass handed to him regularly. Not impressed with him at all. Mike Evans? Sophomore slump comes to mind. You can bet your sweet ass that he is going to be getting more coverage this year.   Koetter? He is mediocre. His offensive stats across the board are average. In 8 years he has only had 2 offenses in the bottom half of the top 10 in scoring. His teams averaged 17th in scoring. Going down the line he is completely average in every aspect of the offense. In passing yards over 8 years his teams averaged 16th. In passing TDs his teams averaged 16th. In passing attempts his teams averaged 17th. In rushing attempts his teams averaged 16th. In rushing yards his teams averaged 16th. In rushing TDs his teams averaged 13th. You really cannot get much more average than that. And that is with weapons like Marice Jones-Drew, Fred Taylor, Julio Jones, Roddy White, Matt Ryan, etc. Nope, I see no reason whatsoever to be excited about him as OC.  And Koetter is the only coach on staff that has had to deal with a rookie quarterback. And that was Blaine fucking Gabbert. We know how that turned out. Lovie has never dealt with a rookie quarterback. I do not expect that to go well.  Steve White was devastatingly wrong about his thoughts on the Bucs last year (which you have conveniently ignored). Lovie ended up having a worse record than Gap Tooth did the year before. Yet you still think Steve White knows what he is talking about and that Lovie is a better coach. That makes no sense to an objective observer. You can claim you are not a homer all day long but being hyped about mediocre talent, untested players, average at best coaches, and not criticizing Lovie for that atrocious year last year has all the makings of a homer."
buccaneers,36mrtb,TrueBuccaneersFan,1 point,Thu May 21 23:11:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not really that high on Swearinger.  He's a bad fit for the defense.  His cover skills have come under question and his prime skill is crashing the line of scrimmage.  Bucs need intelligent DBs who know how to play zone.  DJ's got crazy ability and is young - which is why the Bucs had to take the flier on him - but he got run out of Houston because he wasn't coachable.  You're right in saying he might not make the team.  Maybe his release was a wake up call and now he's ready to do what is asked of him, but if not you can't run an insubordinate guy out on the field.  You can't trust his decision-making.  You're poo-pooing on Smith and Marpet based on what?  You not being impressed by them?  Marpet goes from a DIII school to the senior bowl and instead of being overwhelmed, kicked ass at both T and G.  He never played G.  They just threw him in there and he didn't.  Here's a nice little write up about Marpet holding his own against the 12th pick over all Danny Sheldon.  How can you not like a guy like Marpet?  Sheldon's a monster and Marpet handled him.  Marpet is a guy who just straight up doesn't GAF.  You have to like that he was thrown into the big mix of the combine and the senior bowl and excelled.   I was a little sketchy about the Smith pick too, especially after reading this about his work ethic, but he was projected first round and when I watched his vids and one thing I noticed beyond the hand strength everyone seems to talk about is his very good, active feet.  He's a polished LT coming out of college.    Those two guys will have their struggles coming into the league, all rookies do - especially lineman - but in the years to come, I think those guys will be good solid players.  As for Koetter...  So you're saying the guy that got a 7th ranked offense with David fucking Garrard and Quinn fucking Gray sharing QB duties is fertilizer?  2 top 10 offenses in 8 years?  How many top 10 offenses has the Bucs had in their entire history?  Once for yards and once for points.  That's it.  You give Koetter a good QB to work with and healthy receivers and he'll get you the 4th ranked passing offense in the league like he did last year.  He's not just a pass happy guy either.  In Jax, he had Fred Taylor and MGJ and they ran all over everyone when those guys were healthy.  The bottom line with Koetter is - you give him the horses he'll give you results on the field - at least that's been the story throughout his career.  Here you want to judge his career based on Blaine Gabbert.  You think Jameis Winston is Blaine Gabbert?  Steve White aside and all the other bullshit...  You're on record saying the Bucs will finish dead last defensively in the league.  I'm saying 15-10 - you're saying last.  You say Koetter is shit - Winston is a 50/50 shot and the two linemen are hyped up mediocre talent.  I'm saying 1st overall QBs have a tendency to do well, it's not a lock, but those guys generally have good careers outside Couch and Russell.  We won't have a top 10 offense in 2015, but it should be a quantum leap better than the no offensive coordinator, sieve OL, turnover-sack show Tampa had last year finishing dead last in offense."

[Swaeringer]'s a bad fit for the defense...Marpet held his own at the senior bowl (you forgot to mention his awesomest stats at the combine)...links to Bucsnation and NFL.com to support D. Smith, etc.   You consume a lot of media, don't you? I feel like I am arguing with ESPN. I think I might see the problem here.  The media attacked Gap Tooth in 2013 and so did you. The media supported Lovie last year and now and so do you. Hmmmm.   You (or should I say the media) were wrong about last year. Badly. Lovie shit the fucking bed. Badly. Unless you wanted us to be the worst team in the league? Is that what you wanted? And now you are saying we will be average and you are happy with that? WTF?   We won't have a top 10 offense in 2015, but it should be a quantum leap better than the no offensive coordinator, sieve OL, turnover-sack show Tampa had last year finishing dead last in offense.   No offensive coordinator = Lovie's fault. For one, he hand picked Tedford. Tedford was his man and then Tedford peaced out. Lovie could have promoted from within or hired a new OC instead of letting a rookie straight out of college assistant handle it part time. From top to bottom that whole issue was Lovie's fault.  Sieve OL = Lovie's fault. His first order of business was to come in and blow up our perfectly good offensive line. Dumbest move I have ever seen a head coach make. Now that I am on record saying from the beginning. My very first post on here was talking about how bad our offensive line is going to be and how dumb it was for Lovie to do that. Waaay back before the season even started I said that. The offensive line problems were 100% on Lovie last year. 100%. No getting around it. It is amusing how you Lovie apologists always fail to acknowledge that simple fact. Is it a mantra you carry around in your wallet to never blame Lovie for anything?  Turnover-sack show and dead last in offense = Lovie's fault. He brought in his own hand picked fucking quarterback who sucked balls and then refused to bench him when he kept sucking balls and sucking balls and sucking balls.  Come to think of it, 90% of Lovie's decisions last year were crap.  So let me ask you this. Are you fighting so hard to support Lovie because you were so adamantly against that idiot Schiano and you feel this is a personal reflection on you? Is that why you refuse to acknowledge that Lovie was worse than Schiano? Or is it because you are parroting the media? You pissed all over the Bucs coach in 2013 and apparently attacked any fan who supported him. You seemed adamant to not settle for a losing team. Now you are all sunshine and roses when Lovie put an even worse team on the field. Running around sprinkling hope dust everywhere. That does not make any sense. It is really hard to take you serious when you flip flop like that. But the media is doing the same thing so I think I see why you do it."

buccaneers,36k0ni,NewRedditorHere,0,Thu May 21 06:14:51 2015 UTC,The qb and rb are 7 yards behind the LOS in the shotgun. No way they can get there faster than the guy who's ass the ball is currently attached to .  Hes the 1st to know theres a problem. Turn around and fall on it ya idiot. Or at least try. Ignoring it wont help.
buccaneers,36k0ni,BucJason,1 point,Thu May 21 11:57:08 2015 UTC,"That means the center would have to 1) turn around, 2) track the ball, 3) fall on it.  The DTs can do that way quicker than the center.  It's better for your center to just jam the d-line from getting to it, as your QB has tracked it the whole way since the snap and can get to it quicker."
buccaneers,36k0ni,NewRedditorHere,1 point,Thu May 21 13:35:38 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, after the snap, an offensive lineman is not allowed to be the first person to touch the ball. It technically could bounce off the RBs big toe and EDS or anyone else on the line for that matter could have then touched the ball... had they been aware there was a fumble to begin with.  Stupid bone-headed move #253 by the Bucs o-line last year, but not immediately turning around and picking it up wasn't the worst thing he could have done."
buccaneers,36k0ni,ApolloXLII,0,Fri May 22 02:57:29 2015 UTC,"Except it was. Hence the reason Atlanta recovered and his attempting to block accomplished nothing.

Sims could easily establish himself as the official starter by week 6 but neither are the bruising workhorse back that lovie really wants. Plus sims was drafted under a different OC I think dougie actually fits koetters system slightly better, Doug is a between the tackles runner while sims is more of a zone running scheme back, our offensive line is sort of a mismatched hybrid of both schemes so I guess it just depends what koetter wants to do."

It was actually much more entertaining when our defense was on the field than when our offense was on the field. I remember fans of other teams groaning when they had to play us. We commanded a huge amount of respect. We were feared. The fans were rabid and the stadium was LOUD.  I vaguely remember some stat that during our supreme defense days, teams that played us went on to lose the next week something like 80 percent of the time because they were so beat up.  Watching that defense was truly amazing. Almost every play you could expect to see a bone crushing tackle, a sack, a pressure, an interception, and sometimes all at the same time. I do not think we will ever see a defense that dominant again for that long consistently. I mean, sweet baby jesus, our defense scored more points in the Super Bowl than the number one rated offense. We had 5 sacks and 5 turnovers. Total domination. And that happened for years on a routine basis before that game.  I think I am going to go cry now."

buccaneers,36ibxb,mjohnson062,1 point,Wed May 20 01:18:55 2015 UTC,"He had 8 seasons with 10+ sacks, which is more than LT and Derrick Thomas, plus recent HoFs Strahan and Haley. He had 3 seasons with the 2nd most sacks and a season with 3rd most sacks during those years.  He was pretty good in Arizona, he had his best season sack wise there. He just stepped up to another level in Tampa.  I'm not sure if I would elect him right now. Kevin Greene should have been in for so long and he still can't get in."
buccaneers,36ibxb,ocxtitan,1 point,Wed May 20 02:02:28 2015 UTC,The 85 bears are a bit overrated IMO. That 2001 ravens D was so unbelievably smothering but I'll honestly argue that bucs D against anyone. The steel curtain won a few which is hard to argue against but their offense produced a few hall of famers. Our bucs team was an unreal D and an average at best offense that cruised through the playoffs.
buccaneers,36ibxb,Geddyn,1 point,Wed May 20 02:31:00 2015 UTC,"Top five definitely, probably top three. The scoring of the defense those few years was insane. Sapp, Rice, Brooks, Lynch, Barber and the rest just flat out lit teams up. One of Sapp's famous quotes is ""just give us 17 points and we'll win every game for you"".  Gruden came in and told the defense they needed to be better, they needed to score more points. They did."
buccaneers,36ibxb,steven_scramkos,1 point,Wed May 20 03:00:52 2015 UTC,"Haha I love that quote and I saw that 55 told him they would score 8 tds and Gruden said ""yeah right"" and then they ended up scoring 11 I think."
buccaneers,36ibxb,schroepnuts,1 point,Wed May 20 12:38:25 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the number, but someone said if they scored a certain amount of defensive tds in a season, they'd win a championship. The last two pick sixes in the SB got them to exactly that number."

buccaneers,36g35m,klutch65,2,Tue May 19 09:12:45 2015 UTC,"God yes, that was brutal I couldn't finish it"

buccaneers,36g35m,patientbearr,7,Tue May 19 15:09:55 2015 UTC,But I've seen him get burned so many times. I know he's yound so I'm still on the fence about Banks. This season is really big for him
buccaneers,36g35m,newtothelyte,2,Tue May 19 05:23:55 2015 UTC,"He really came around at the end of last season, a promising sign since the defense we're running has an established adjustment period.  He has a couple of the instincts that make a zone CB a really dangerous weapon, and just needs to learn to hide better.    In 2013 he looked horrible the whole way through, but I'm not sure how much of that was him and how much was a combination of ""nobody ever threw near Revis that year"" and ""Bill Sheridan was a terrible defensive coordinator on an awful coaching staff.""  So I'm optimistic, but I remember how bad he can be too."
buccaneers,36g35m,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Tue May 19 15:59:42 2015 UTC,I still think his best position is safety but until we find another corner on the level of Verner he's all we got
buccaneers,36g35m,OptimusPrimeTime21,1 point,Tue May 19 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"He definitely outplayed Verner last year. He had so many great moments, and showed great growth. Should be interesting to see him play this year, as he's still only twenty five."
buccaneers,36g35m,SupaHotTrainer,1 point,Thu May 21 23:59:44 2015 UTC,Man he has a lot of potential but I'm worried he doesn't fit our system that well. I hate to say it but If he has a good season I could see us getting a 2nd rounder and/or a rotational pass rusher from the pats for him next year. Best case scenario he turns into Tillman 2.0 but he still has to transition from a press man corner to a cover 2.
buccaneers,36g35m,FEO4,2,Tue May 19 03:40:35 2015 UTC,"But if he has another good year, doesn't that mean he does fit our system? So why trade a player that's performing well?"
buccaneers,36g35m,SkardHard,2,Tue May 19 05:01:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I don't want him on our team but I think lovie and licht are pretty intent on finding their own guys. Hell, we cut an entire offensive line last year for hardly any reason. I don't think lovie has any interest in tailoring his defense to the players he just wants guys who can do what he asks, nothing against that, but banks could have a good season playing press coverage and lovie could trade him with the thought of getting a better cover 2 corner in return. It was just a hunch anyway. The patriots currently have no corners and they seem to use us like a farm league so it just kind of fits, plus he is a prototype corner for their system."
buccaneers,36g35m,FEO4,1 point,Tue May 19 05:14:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think Lovie likes Banks. Dude puts in work and improved a lot last season, I would be pretty shocked if he plays even better than last season if we trade him for a second (at least from the Pats since we know they will be at the bottom)."
buccaneers,36g35m,Fyresand,2,Tue May 19 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"I hope lovie likes banks. I really like him. I was a big schiano guy and I hate to admit it but when we drafted him I thought he could be the next Sherman, i dont think his ceiling is quite that high anymore but he could be a rock solid starter at the #2 corner position. Possibly more of a Brandon browner, minus 40 pounds."
buccaneers,36g35m,FEO4,1 point,Tue May 19 05:35:34 2015 UTC,"He seems to share some qualities with Brian Kelly, and I see no reason he can't replicate Kelly's successful in this system."
buccaneers,36g35m,beniro,1 point,Tue May 19 12:32:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he couldn't be successful, just that he could be more successful sooner in a system that was tailored to his skill set. I also don't agree with the Kelley comparison, Kelley was a prototype cover 2 zone corner drafted by dungy to fit his system. Banks has been a press-man bully type corner since college, and he was drafted by Schiano to be exactly that. Simply put banks is not Lovie's guy and he is entering a contract year, there is probably a 60/40 chance he stays, even if he breaks out."
buccaneers,36g35m,FEO4,1 point,Tue May 19 13:00:40 2015 UTC,"I mention Kelly because he was the guy tasked with man to man duties at times in the old Tampa 2 because he had that skill set. I don't see why banks' man to man skills can't be the same type of asset for this team, not to mention we run more man to man than the old school Tampa 2, I'm pretty sure.   But I guess it does all come down to his ability to perform all of the duties, not just some, but I think he deserves his fair shake this year and I believe in him. You are correct, though, that his being drafted by another regime for another defense doesn't bode well."
buccaneers,36g35m,beniro,1 point,Tue May 19 14:39:44 2015 UTC,"I definitely believe in banks but my thought is that he could have a good year and increase his value so much that resigning might not be worth it for a guy who doesn't fit the system exactly, in Lovie's mind, and maybe lovie and licht decide they'd rather have a couple extra draft picks. The difference between Kelley and banks though is that Kelley was a finesse corner while banks is a bully at the line of scrimmage, that just isn't what lovie likes to do, personally I love press coverage and crazy blitzes so banks is right up my alley, but that was schianos defense. Lovie's conservative defense needs corners who can run with a receiver just a little bit longer."

He probably got drunk post-game outside RJS and proceeded to get public indecency/intoxication/disorderly conduct. Factoring that he's wearing a jersey and I've seen those exact temporary tattoos before, I think it's pretty safe to say they're temporary."

Then we have a mixed bag of guys playing RDE who will encompass:   Jacquies Smith [who] managed 6.5 sacks last year in very limited playing time, and should see some competition from T.J. Fatinikun, another player who flashed potential in limited playing the time. With veteran Larry English as another backup   Three fucking backup players who we hope to god will step up and become starting material. Not saying it won't happen, I loved what Jacquies did last year, but goddamn this is a major area of concern.

Furthermore he sounded like he was smart enough to realize that being a receiver rooming with the number 1 pick QB is a major asset and I have no doubt that he has taken advantage of it. I have a feeling they will develop a relationship similar to glennon and Murphy jr. Where he tends to look his way when plays break down because of the extra work they put in together on the second team or in this case the rookie mini camp. Guys like this make the team worth rooting for regardless of our record."

I have noticed more camaraderie between players than I have seen in a decade. To me, that is a big indicator that good things might be coming. When players like each other the team usually plays better. Dunno. We will have to wait and see."
buccaneers,35ztim,TrueBuccaneersFan,-5,Fri May 15 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. Except I can say right now that Donovan smith is a bust, so wether that's bad coaching or bad management it'll be an issue we have to deal with."
buccaneers,35ztim,FEO4,2,Fri May 15 02:05:52 2015 UTC,How can you call someone a bust that hasn't even played yet? He may not workout as a LT but I think he would be a pretty good RT or Guard.
buccaneers,35ztim,SkardHard,1 point,Fri May 15 02:44:44 2015 UTC,"Because if you draft someone in the second round to play left tackle, which is a major position of need, and they have to switch positions because they aren't good enough to play left tackle, they are a bust. But the reason I don't think he is good enough is from what I've seen he is an average pass protector and a below average run blocker, couple that with a highly questionable motor and I just don't think he will make it through the first 6 weeks at LT especially since we will undoubtedly experience some growing pains I wonder if he can keep his heart in it. Like you said he could play guard but I think he would be better at LG meaning mankins would have to switch sides throwing off any continuity our line might have. And I don't think he'd do us any good at RT because we already have a prototypical RT in Dotson who I doubt would last at LT due to his lack of agility. As long as Winston works out though I'd be willing to give lovie and licht a mulligan for smith. But I sincerely hope he works out for us because if you look at the colts who drafted Luck and castonzo in back to back years, they have great chemistry from pretty much only working with each other thus far in their careers.  TL;DR he is lacking the effort level that successful players in the NFL have. He is also a relatively raw prospect so I don't see him pushing himself to develop his game the way he needs to."

buccaneers,3613oe,uclabucsfan,7,Fri May 15 05:19:42 2015 UTC,"What concerns me is how he will block great for a few seconds, then just stand around. He plays with a lack of initiative, which is what scouts knocked him for. You want your O-lineman to play until the whistle, because you never know when there is gonna be an opportunity to get a second block down-field that might turn a decent run into a touchdown.  The good thing is his strength is pass protection, and he is going to be playing next to Logan Mankins who is one of the greatest run-blocking Guards to play the game. If Logan can help him with his run-blocking it might be a good fit.   Of all our draft picks, I feel like Donovan Smith is the biggest risk of busting."
buccaneers,3613oe,particleman1010,2,Fri May 15 13:26:24 2015 UTC,"I don't feel this way about him. I think Smith has all the tools to be a solid RT or even Guard if he doesn't workout at the LT spot. His ""bust"" assessment would be if he doesn't workout at LT, because of how high we drafted him."
buccaneers,3613oe,Lazarous86,5,Sat May 16 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"The only thing that concerns me is that he looks like a totally different player in this game than he did against Nebraska. I'm worried that not every game on the buccaneers will be on such a big stage and he will have to motivate himself to play like that every single game. He didn't look bad against Nebraska, he more or less dominated randy Greg but, like others have said, he handles his assignment and then watches the rest of play happen in front of him, that won't fly in the NFL."
buccaneers,3613oe,FEO4,4,Fri May 15 14:31:49 2015 UTC,His run blocking looked really good but there were a few blocks that he got burned due to foot work. Then there were some that he completely let go. He needs fine tuning but he has the size and athleticism that can translate well.
buccaneers,3613oe,SpaceAzn_Zen,2,Fri May 15 10:22:20 2015 UTC,"TIL Penn State should have run more behind Smith vs Ohio State.  The guy gets really good push in the running game.  I saw one play where a swim move got him in the passing game, but it looked like might have been a little gassed in the 4th qtr there and let up on his footwork.  That was the book on Smith - that here and there he'd let off the throttle.  There are plays in that game where his footwork is outstanding.  He keeps a good motor and moves laterally extremely well.  But a handful of plays it looks like he lapses a bit.  The good news is if he dials it up a notch with the Bucs and sustains his discipline, he could be pretty damn decent."
buccaneers,3613oe,trudatness,1 point,Fri May 15 11:27:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a penn state fan and have said this since the day we drafted Smith, physically he has the tools, mentally hes lacking what you want in an olineman. He's a smart guy don't get me wrong, he graduated in 3 years, but he doesn't have the motor or the mean streak you look for in a pro bowl caliber guy. He takes plays off and displays shoddy footwork at times especially in pass protection. He had a great freshman year but never showed any improvement after that. I'm afraid his ceiling is his floor, what you saw in college is what he will be in the pros"

I guess my issue with the title and article as a whole isn't so much it is slamming Doug Martin, but more that it is just shitty ""journalism"" with a click bait headline and no real substance.  Just a ""reporter"" writing an article to fill space because they have to churn out X number of articles a day/week/month.    And to top it off, the author did no real research.  They just take the data that some other site compiled and put an ""opinion"" on it.    Guess that's just the shape of what is called journalism in the modern internet age."
buccaneers,362ah3,NFLVideoConverterBot,5,Fri May 15 15:30:12 2015 UTC,"Doug isn't Marshawn Lynch, he isn't a power running back. He is more like LeSean McCoy, smaller, low center of gravity, capable of quick cuts and short area burst. He is dangerous in the open field where he can use his speed to evade defenders.   Last year we had:   No Offensive Coordinator A downgrade at FB from Erik Lorig No relevant passing attack to spread the defense out   This year we have:   Offensive Coordinator that got top 10 offense out of an O-line even worse than ours New rookie FB Upgrade at QB with Winston to give us a relevant passing attack   http://www.buccaneers.com/videos/videos/Film-Session-Week-15/4539c3e6-036e-4bc1-897a-14e9b034029e  I think both Martin and Sims have something unique to bring to our offense, and I think both of them will have a better season than last year."
buccaneers,362ah3,ssdestroyer,2,Fri May 15 15:59:41 2015 UTC,"Both Martin and Sims were bad when it came to yards after contact and BTs.  I think Sims might even have been worst in the league for RB qualifiers.  I'll say it again, the explosion in Martin's game hasn't been there since the shoulder injury.  You could have driven a truck through that hole in the breakdown video.  That was just good scheme and execution on the offensive line's part.  You or I could have ran for big yardage there.  Doug might not be Lynch, but in his rookie season he broke over 40 tackles.  He had deceptive power blended with elusiveness.  Guys couldn't square up on him and he ran through many arm tackles.  Defenders also misjudged his strength and he caught a few unaware.  His legs always kept a great motor and his will to continue forward was outstanding.  Mix that with the suddenness he had and it's easy to understand why he had nearly 2K yards from scrimmage out of the gate.  Problem is we haven't seen that guy since then.  I'm not saying he can't be that guy again, but its pretty fucking clear to anyone who has eyes he hasn't been that back since the injury.  Last season when Sims got healthy and started getting carries, then all of a sudden Doug's game picked up a little.  Yeah there was a little flash, but still nothing like the badass he was when he was a rookie.  Did his game get a little juice because he was afraid to lose his job?  I don't know.  Remember, running backs in the NFL are here today, gone tomorrow.  They're a fragile species.    As far as Sims is concerned, his shake and bake is something definitely to get excited about.  Dude's got a shimmy, but again he's got to do better than fall down like a sack of potatoes as soon as he gets touched.  Sims legitimately had the worst yards after contact for any RB in the league with 20 carries or more (Sims had 66 carries) and averaged 2.8 an attempt.  Dude did not break tackles at all.  Here's a good breakdown on RBs in 2014:  http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/rb  I really don't know what else to say, but Tampa Bay RBs flat out sucked fucking ass last year.  Lets not sugarcoat things.  Our only hope is that somehow Doug Martin grows his nuts back and starts balling again, because if you look at the trio of guys they ran out there last year - Martin, Rainey and Sims - the outlook is fucking bleak.  They weren't even replacement level.  There's only so much you can scapegoat Marcus Arroyo for.  Me personally, I hope they give Mike James another look.  He might be the freshest guy who's most hungry.  I hope Koetter looks at some of his 2013 tape.  I like Sims in passing downs and draws, but I'm skeptical of him as a feature back.  Rainey is a replacement guy.  He's a good journeyman vet who will give you a lunch pail performance when your ace gets gets hurt or needs a blow.  Is he a top 10 or top 15 back in the league?  No.  Martin?  I don't even know if he'll be in Tampa come training camp Bucs are still actively shopping him.  Maybe it's a message from Lovie - either run tough or get a bus ticket?  Maybe the Bucs think they can get a better RB off the waiver wire (makes you wonder then who would give them draft picks when they think Rainey, Sims or waiver wire RB is a better option)?  Maybe Lovie and Koetter think they're going to throw the rock around with Winston and the receiving talent the Bucs have and RB isn't a high priority?  Last year the Bucs had a horrific running game. Downright dreadful.  Was it in part because Lovie and Licht blew up the offensive line and ran scrubs out there?  Yeah I'll buy that to a degree, but look at the 2012 & 2013 youtube vids of Martin and James.  They ran hard and looked damn good, but that shit's a memory now.  Look at the 2014 vids, Tampa backs fell down all over the place.  It was more than just bad line play - the yards after contact stats back that up.  I'm thinking Tampa had so many holes going into this offseason, they just couldn't get to RB and the black hole it was causing on the roster.  This is a work in progress.  Maybe an opportunity comes along to pick up a guy?  Maybe Doug Martin comes back his old healthy self?  Maybe they stink up the joint again in 2015?  Will have to wait and see.    One thing is for damn sure, they can't have a repeat performance of 2014.  They had 1375 total team yards rushing last year.  That's bad.  If I was Lovie, I'd be wanting to fire guys too."

Doug Williams 5 years as a Buc  REGULAR SEASON - 73 tds / 73 interceptions PLAYOFFS (3 SEASONS) - 2 tds / 9 ints..  can we stop pretending that Doug Williams was a good QB?
buccaneers,35usha,GatorMarley,2,Thu May 14 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"Stats don't always tell the whole story. You may be too young to have watched him, but those of us that did know he deserves this. He was a phenomenal qb for us, having a horrendous line blocking for him.   This was a time when there wasn't all these rules protecting the QB. He was beat to hell, and perfected the art of throwing passes while being tackled (there was no ""in the grasp"" rule). This was also during a time when there wasn't a whole lot of passing in the game, so comparing them to today's QBs is misleading. He also took the worst team in NFL history and brought them to the NFC championship game.  All this and he had to deal with being one of the first black QBs in the league and had to deal with a lot of southern racists that said black players  weren't smart enough to be a QB in the league."

It seems more likely that, no matter how 2014 turned out, Licht would have done any and everything he could to trade up to get Winston. That was always his guy.

The only place to put him would have been in the ECHL (think AA baseball) which is below his talent level. If Yzerman gave him an offer he would have 1. Been wasting time 2. Wasting a contract spot and 3.

buccaneers,35ram9,PorSiempre7,6,Tue May 12 22:06:33 2015 UTC,He's only 23 productive in the tackling department. I like it. Maybe he just needs some new scenery to fix some technique issues. Ahh the optimism only the off season can bring

Those became Lovie's guys as soon as the season started and they were still on the roster. If Lovie didn't like them he could have easily moved them, hell we got a pro-bowl guard for one of the rawest tight ends in the league in tim wright. If you actually look at it Rutgers has a ridiculously high number of players in the NFL from such a small school, I think the whole ""Schiano man"" idea translates extremely well to the NFL. It was the on field part that he had trouble with lol."
buccaneers,35ram9,FEO4,2,Wed May 13 14:47:02 2015 UTC,"I was referring to the overall product on the field. The idea of a ""Schiano man"" is appealing for teams, especially since that is more or less a reproduction of a ""Parcell's guy;"" basically someone who is all about football and won't cause a distraction. On paper, they sound great. The problem comes in with the production on the field. Tim Wright did have a great year, Tampa definitely lucked out with him. But when you're 2-14, and Schiano left because of his lack of production, I feel like all they're getting are players that won't make the headlines for off- the-field issues, but also won't make them for anything on-the-field also.  Edit: at the moment there are 3 Rutgers players on the roster (including Green) so there had to be a reason as to why they felt the need to move the majority of them..If only we were able to draft a ""Schiano guy"" like McCourty :("
buccaneers,35ram9,joy4874,1 point,Wed May 13 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"Haha either McCourty would be great or Anthony Davis. There are definitely Schiano men that produce but I can't say that any of them have ever been on our team, other than maybe Tim wright. But I like the idea of having a team full of stand up guys, also the patriots had the most players from one college in the NFL and that college was Rutgers, they also did pretty well last season."
buccaneers,35ram9,FEO4,2,Wed May 13 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I am on the same page with that also, from a personality aspect.

If he ever gets mic'd up I will be a happy person. His hits are vicious and has tried stripping the ball a lot more. Kid is improving but I think their was a conflict of interest.

DJ Swearinger - 2nd round pick by the Texans in '13 from South Carolina.  Both players probably not quite starting calibre at the moment, but Swearinger will likely compete for the starting role, if not assume that position. Greene provides at worst an extra camp body and at best another option to compete at SLB with Lansanah."
buccaneers,35ram9,dan71,2,Wed May 13 06:05:55 2015 UTC,"DJ could easily be a starter on a couple of teams, but he is very much a frustrating player at times.  He's still young and his coverage skills are sure to improve.  What'll trouble you most about his play is that he'll be overly aggressive on some reads and pursuits, and will often try to blow up a guy or strip the ball instead of going for a sure tackle.  Also, he'll get penalized every so often, usually for talking too much.  FWIW, I don't think he was cut because of on-the-field stuff so much as a combination of personality conflicts w/ our HC as well as being seen as a distraction to JD Clowney.  He's a pretty likeable player but he has some growing-up to do both personally and professionally, and the Texans didn't want to be the ones to do it."

I started watching football when I was 9 years old; that happened to be the same year the Bucs won the championship. I don't call myself a bandwagoner, because I was a Floridian at the time and would've rooted for them even if they hadn't won the SB. But I remember when I started watching football, they were the greatest team in the world! I'm in college now and to this day I'm still a loyal fan!  When he was fired in 2009, it was a sad day for me and a lot of other Bucs fans. End of an era."
buccaneers,35qd76,djob13,4,Thu May 14 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. The issue with gruden is that he liked to collect old players who were great in their prime, but had their best days long behind them. He didn't build through the draft and didn't spend a lot of time looking ahead."
buccaneers,35qd76,woodlickin,6,Tue May 12 17:37:06 2015 UTC,Yeah he did build a win now not later team but in his defense we traded two firsts and two seconda to get him so when he got here he didnt have much to look ahead with.
buccaneers,35qd76,djob13,4,Tue May 12 17:40:13 2015 UTC,That's true. But he still held on to some guys a bit longer than he should have. And we spent too much in free agency on guys we didn't even keep for two seasons.

I put him in the pool with other good coaches that have one SB ring, not sure why you put him and Belichick in the same sentence, I like Gruden but he is not in BB's class in any way shape or form sir."
buccaneers,35qd76,crackadeluxe,1 point,Wed May 13 20:34:08 2015 UTC,"Gruden is an excellent coach and when it comes to the ""X's and O's"" of football there is no better mind IMO. However, Gruden's achilles heel was talent evaluation. He could not separate his emotions from his analysis and let his personal relationships/opinions affect his personnel methodology. That's what got him in trouble. If he had a really good GM that he trusted to do his job and leave alone, he could be winning multiple Lombardi trophies with some team right now.     But if you want a really unpopular opinion that I vehemently believe I think Dungy is the most over-rated HC of all time in the NFL. The Bucs NEVER win a Superbowl under Dungy. If you think otherwise you weren't paying very close attention to the Bucs performance in the postseason.   We'd get thumped in the playoffs, not even scoring a TD for many of the games, and we'd roll out the very same team, very same players, and very same game plan the next year. Dungy never held himself or his offense to the same standards as he did his defense. Many defensive players under Dungy have admitted as much. Then Dungy gets shipped to the Colts because he was all defense, and they needed defense to get over the hump and win the big one. And now people talk like he accomplished that when in reality the defense in Indy NEVER improved significantly and were not the reason they won a Superbowl IMO. He was there for years and Indy never had a good defense much less an excellent one yet Dungy is a great coach? He stubbornly put Clyde Christianson at OC when in Tampa and I have never seen a team look more out-classed and confused as the Buc's offense while Clyde was calling the shots. It was horrible. Fast-forward five or so years later and guess who replaces Mudd as OC in Indy? Good ol' Clyde. Very little objectivity with Dungy IMO and that was his ultimate downfall."
buccaneers,35qd76,cooley1990,1 point,Thu May 14 12:27:03 2015 UTC,"Joe Jurevicious, and Keenan McCardell, along with several other key contributors, were not on the Bucs before Gruden came. So NO, it wasn't DUNGY's team that won the Super Bowl, it was Gruden's. If Gruden hadn't brought in those free agents, we likely would not have gotten to the SB. Especially Joe Jurevicious. Brad Johnson also had a pro bowl year in 2002 under Gruden.   If y'all remember, Dungy's team had their asses kicked two years in a row during the playoffs against the Eagles and also had lackluster offenses. During our Super Bowl season, that didn't happen.  Gruden played a huge role in getting us to the Super Bowl; I don't care what people say. Dungy was a fine NFL coach, but Gruden ignited a spirit and passion that wasn't in the Bucs locker room prior to his arrival.   Even after the Super Bowl, Gruden managed to give us winning seasons in 05, 07, and 08 despite having a horrible GM in Allen and a lack of talent from free agency or the draft to work with. He still got us wins and the Bucs were still a respected organization under his leadership; I'd say his biggest screw up was not drafting Aaron Rodgers in 2005!"
buccaneers,35qd76,LansdowneStreet,0,Thu May 14 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"Here's the most important thing to know:  To a Bucs fan, ""Gruden or Dungy"" is a ""Kirk or Picard"" argument.    I tend to side with Dungy.  Because of a simple fact:  Jon Gruden never really did anything with the Bucs' defense, and the Bucs' defense was always the meal ticket during the Gruden years.    PROS:  He was an awesome game-planner.  He loved football and couldn't watch enough film for his tastes.  You can tell he wants every player to succeed.  He does a great job with older quarterbacks.  He does an awesome job with teams he has little control over.  (After all, his best seasons came under Al Davis, and then with a team Rich McKay already built.)  CONS:  He took over the team's player operations, so his inability to criticize a player destroyed him.  If he had stuck with Rich McKay at GM he would have been set, but his ego got in the way and he brought in Bruce Allen, a mistake that changed the Bucs' history for the worse.  He also tried to draft a couple of quarterbacks, and he does best with journeymen.  Whatever he says to guys like Brad Johnson to get them to another level, it doesn't work with Bruce Gradkowski.  Overall, I prefer Tony Dungy and consider Monte Kiffin (Gruden's only DC in Tampa Bay) the effective ""head coach"" after Dungy.  But I like Gruden.  I'd honestly like to see him work with Jerry Jones.  Not kidding, if he had a team that he couldn't control and could only coach, that's where Gruden rocks.  The guy took Al Davis to multiple playoff appearances.  Jerry would never give him full control, and he would thrive in that, but of course he would never accept that role now.  He's also a fantastic announcer.  One of the better guys with Bucs ties in announcing, up there with John Lynch."
buccaneers,35qd76,Mezzer25,2,Tue May 12 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"You have a very strong defensive lean, which really colors how you view Gruden, but I do understand where you are coming from. However, I don't believe Dungy or Kiffin as a hc would have accomplished what Gruden did with that team."
buccaneers,35qd76,IDontWantAPickle,-4,Tue May 12 23:48:36 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think he was a very good coach.   Yes I am one of those people who think he won with Dungy's team.  He certainly didn't have the talent to draft a team like that as he proved in the years after the super bowl.   I also think the only reason we won the super bowl was that he taught our defense everything he taught Rich Gannon. He even ""played"" the role of Gannon during practice leading up to the game because he could imitate him to a tee.    On top of that he had a W-L% of .509 vs Dungy's .563 in Tampa  Overall Gruden's 11 yrs had a W-L% of .540 which puts him 66th on the list of coaches.      Dungy is #12 at .668 BTW."

I don't think Schiano was a good NFL coach, his coaching style was outdated and does not belong to NFL, but he was not a villain r/nfl makes him out to be.  First of you make it sound like Schiano came into a great situation, but in reality the team was a mess and full of holes. Freeman for example was absolutely not a franchise QB. Schiano maybe helped to make Freeman's downfall little bit steeper, but it was inevitable at some point.  Schiano did decent job drafting players and developing them, unlike Morris. If Schiano had been the first hire after Gruden then the rebuilding would have been much quicker and less painful."

buccaneers,35mwqv,Rashi9,4,Tue May 12 13:47:22 2015 UTC,Glad to see the Bucs haven't made all their rookies do a footrace yet.
buccaneers,35mwqv,Lotfa,6,Tue May 12 02:00:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't like the overall tone of the way bajakian and, to a lesser extent, koetter talked about him though.  Bajakian said he's seen him take a step back on his mechanics since his pro day."
buccaneers,35mwqv,NeonSubtlety,3,Mon May 11 21:12:43 2015 UTC,"By all indications he's adjusting his motion.  It takes time to get consistency, and right now, he is focused on the playbook.  Things like this are why we need to be just a bit patient."
buccaneers,35mwqv,beniro,1 point,Mon May 11 23:43:01 2015 UTC,"No he made the motion adjustment pre-draft. All he was working on was his motion. Now it's drop/footwork, read & react, motion/footwork (which go hand in hand so if one is off so is the other), and get the ball out of your hand. All of that in about 2.5 seconds. That's where it's gotten tricky for him and every other rookie QB."
buccaneers,35mwqv,coachhawley,2,Tue May 12 00:00:27 2015 UTC,"I know he changed his motion pre draft and did well, but I think there is general agreement that it will need ongoing work. He definitely has shortened the motion and the ball stays higher."
buccaneers,35mwqv,beniro,7,Tue May 12 02:07:11 2015 UTC,"But you have taken why Bajakian said that out of context. He said he has taken a step back in mechanics because so much information from installing the offense has been thrown at him. The vets are on part 2 of the 5th install of the offense. Jameis has been there for 3 days and is on part 1 of the 5th install. Of course a players mechanics will drop when they are trying so hard to focus on the mental part of the game. Everything gets easier with repetition, and once he understands the concepts from the installs he can then focus on his mechanics."
buccaneers,35mwqv,legleiter4ever,-16,Tue May 12 01:37:35 2015 UTC,"players who've learned good mechanics their whole life wouldn't take a step back because they're reading a playbook.  So, I reject the premise that players' mechanics naturally drop off when they're multitasking as opposed to focussing on one thing.  Jameis had shit mechanics in college.  They had improved from coaching.  According to bajakian they've now regressed.  The ""why"" doesn't matter in the least to me."
buccaneers,35n23q,teztify,4,Mon May 11 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"He would definitely play SS because he is suspect in coverage, but above average against the run. I don't see him as a huge upgrade over what we have already but he could be good in rotation. At the very least he'll give McDougald some competition.   He also definitely doesn't want to play special teams. If we were smart we would shop a 7th next year for him because he is still on a 2nd round rookie contract. If we claim him of waivers then we have to give him a new contract and it will probably be more expensive. Perhaps he would get a single season contract if our FO picked him up off waivers.   We'll just have to wait and see. He's too talented to just ignore.   EDIT: I GUESS I MISSED HIM GETTING CUT ALREADY. SO MUCH FOR A TRADE."

buccaneers,35n23q,Cash-10,3,Mon May 11 21:39:20 2015 UTC,"He doesn't like the Falcons, it seems  But more seriously: I asked a friend who is a Texans fan. He said that he is OK, but limited. He can be great on the blitz, but struggle in coverage and that he gave up a couple of very easy red zone TDs last season. He might need someone really good playing next to him.  But he also wondered why the Texans are cutting him and felt that there was something strange about the whole thing."

buccaneers,35mqvz,Devils_-_Advocate,7,Mon May 11 19:54:52 2015 UTC,"Need? No, I don't need we need to. It would be some nice depth though.  According to overthecap.com, we still have $20 million in cap room, so we could afford it. We still have to sign some rookies, and some of that should be allocated toward Lavonte and future contracts.. but even then, if he wants to play for $4 mil we should be able to swing that.   What's going to help Jameis the most? A dominant run game and a defense that helps cover his eventual mistakes."
buccaneers,35mqvz,FEO4,1 point,Mon May 11 20:03:51 2015 UTC,"Depth? I think Arrington could walk on this team and be our best corner. Then banks can play #2 and verner in the ronde role, I'd love that and I think of Jameis is able to put up points and teams go to the air more often our slow corners will be exposed even more than last year."
buccaneers,35mqvz,Devils_-_Advocate,2,Tue May 12 11:39:36 2015 UTC,"From the sounds of it, Arrington is more of a slot corner guy and gets burned on the outside. If he could walk on and be our best nickle corner, more power to him.  Verner is our #1, and I'm more than comfortable with that. Banks is solid enough at #2"
buccaneers,35mqvz,FEO4,2,Tue May 12 13:07:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think verner is a solid #1, he was the best #2 corner in the league on the Titans but he was exposed when he got here and was expected to cover Julio jones and Kevin Benjamin, I know our system doesn't ask for a ton of man to man but when coverage is blown or a play is busted he simply cannot cover good receivers by himself. I think banks would be a much better #2 if we let him press more but our scheme doesn't really fit his strengths right now, I do think his ceiling could be Charles Tillman once he really knows the system inside and out though. Arrington might not be the guy we need but he is well versed in an incredibly intricate defensive scheme so I have no doubt he could at least learn ours quickly and most likely succeed from any of the three corner spots. I'm also just not satisfied with our corners because if God forbid our offense dos get it together there will be even more pressure on our secondary which is WEAK to say the least."
buccaneers,35mqvz,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Wed May 13 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"Those are all fine points, but at the end of the day is Arrington better than Verner in a #1 role? I personally don't think so. As it stands we just need to roll a safety over the top almost all the time to help out our secondary. If our front 7 can just perform outside of GMC and Lavonte, that's not such a bad thing"
buccaneers,35mqvz,FEO4,1 point,Wed May 13 15:53:05 2015 UTC,I agree but I think a small part of being a bucs fan is the PTSD that doesn't let me trust anyone currently on the roster.

buccaneers,35mqvz,lazybrouf,3,Tue May 12 00:32:27 2015 UTC,"I like him, but I think the Bucs can do better. The slot position here is very specific. We just signed a slot corner who can, hopefully, execute the Tampa 2 slot position perfectly.  Arrington doesn't know our scheme. He performed well in the slot, but was burned outside consistently. He worked well because he had Browner and Revis covering the top 2 receivers. It's like Revis and Banks, where Banks looked better immediately when Revis was our number 1."

Anything better than that will give me hope."
buccaneers,35g79t,wananah,2,Sun May 10 03:11:59 2015 UTC,I've heard a lot of talk from a lot of sources that more-or-less say that offensive line play will improve dramatically with an offensive coordinator; i.e. that the OC has as much effect on line play as he does on other parts of the offense.  I think we have an instinct to elevate the OL coach to a position that acts more independently when compared to other position coaches.  Also this is the rhetoric that I and my optimism choose to stick with.
buccaneers,35g79t,newtothelyte,1 point,Sun May 10 03:17:24 2015 UTC,"You should expect the paper mache line. We have two rookie lineman, Garrett fucking Gilke, and Oneil Cousins starting along with a rookie qb. We are in for some rocky waters, but you should also expect this unit to improve throughout the season in the same way the defense improved last season.  If this line can rank 16th in the league at the end of the season, I'll consider that a win"
buccaneers,35g79t,SkardHard,1 point,Sun May 10 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"Who the hell told you Garrett Gilkey is starting? And who told you that O'Neil Cousins is starting or is even on this team anymore?

buccaneers,35g79t,Invisible_Griffin,5,Sun May 10 22:19:21 2015 UTC,"So anyone who hasn't checked out this thread on /r/nfl yet really ought to. Someone used PFF grades to grade every OLine, and it actually made me feel a lot better. I honestly thought we had one of the worst OLines in the league last year, possibly the worst -- but according to that data we weren't actually all that bad.  Our line really only had 2 major offenders in Collins and Omameh, both of whom were replaced in the draft. Now there will always be rookie struggles, but I can't really ask for much more than that."
buccaneers,35g79t,MrRIP,7,Mon May 11 17:58:27 2015 UTC,30-39 sacks are completely average for a team and if he was coaching the Browns he's helped make two of the better lineman in the league with JT and Alex Mack.    I really think this is more off season boredom than anything

buccaneers,35g79t,MrRIP,1 point,Sun May 10 17:30:55 2015 UTC,It's concerning when you don't put them In context. The average NFL defense gets about 2 sacks a game. We had some issues last year I don't think blaming it solely on the OL coach is the solution. Again if he was that bad he would've left with arroyo and company
buccaneers,35g79t,chemthethriller,2,Sun May 10 17:53:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a believer that the QB makes the OL better than people assume... Most people want to say to have a good QB you need to keep him upright... I believe a lot of that comes on the QB. I have nothing to back up my assumptions at the moment, but I would tend to believe outside of sacks that are let up without the QB even hitting his 3rd step, a lot of it goes on the QB, his recognition of defense and the ability to get the ball out quickly... Also it goes on the QB to make the pre snap reads and call out the adjustments... I truly believe if you put Manning behind what is consider the worst NFL OL, they will no longer be the worst, they will be more than likely right in the middle because Manning's ability to call things out before they even happen.    Watching Winston at FSU i'm confident that he will make TBs OL much better than the previous QBs did."
buccaneers,35g79t,UpboatsforUpvotes,1 point,Sun May 10 03:16:39 2015 UTC,"QBs absolutely have a big effect on how well the O-line plays, if you watch Rodgers in the pocket, he manages to balance the pass-rushers on his O-linemen like someone hiding behind a tree. I hope some of Winston's football prodigy intelligence helps him to set his protections more effectively than Glennon, or McCown, he is still gonna need our guys to keep him clean for 2-3 seconds. Another good thing about Koetter is his experience with bad o-lines in Atlanta, he was able to change the offense to fit it."
buccaneers,35g79t,Robertlnu,1 point,Sun May 10 04:42:53 2015 UTC,"I agree, however did you see us last year. There were so many times where the defense penetrated the line in less than 2 seconds. We got manhandled. A QB makes the Oline better only if he has enough time to throw and based on the fact that we have a pure pocket Passer and not Mariota, if the line constantly collapses within 2 seconds, we are in for a long year"
buccaneers,35g79t,ballinben,1 point,Mon May 11 14:26:41 2015 UTC,"Well part of it too is respect.  If you can burn the defense every time they bull rush you, they won't bull rush you anymore.   When I can sit on my armchair and know the bucs are calling a screen, the LBs can too. If Winston has the skills to show 3 deep, and audible to a screen at the line that is successful. The next time the defensive players get ready to bull rush, they might hesitate half a second to check for a screen.  Half a second is enough for even Gilkey to get his feet set."
buccaneers,35g79t,blackpirateshit,1 point,Mon May 11 17:35:41 2015 UTC,"Well like OP said we allowed 52 sacks last year but I believe the improvements we've made at o-line plus more experience for the existing players/coaches could easily shave 5-6 sacks off that number. That along with having a more mobile QB, and one that simply has better football IQ then the two we had start for us last year, could again very easily lessen the sack total by about 5-6. Last season the two teams that allowed the most sacks and still made the playoffs were Carolina and Seattle with 42. I don't think it's even that optimistic to say we can lower that 52 sack total by only 10 over an entire 16 game season, which puts us on par with not one but two playoff teams from last season, one of which is in our division."

buccaneers,35g79t,Flacracker_173,1 point,Thu May 14 04:13:18 2015 UTC,"The Buccaneers need to reduce sacks allowed from 52 to 37.  Reduction of 15 or one sack per game.  Bucs avg was 3.4 sacks per game in 2014.  Need 2.4 per game in 2015.  Additions of Donovan Smith, Ali Marpet, Jameis Winston, Doug Martin in a critical contract year and a new OC, the Bucs can reduce sacks by 15.  With the release of Anthony Collins, Oniel Cousins and soon to be released Garett Gilkey, the Bucs will reduce 11 sacks from prior year.  With Patrick Omameh out of the starting lineup that makes an additional 7 sacks for a total of 18.  Lets give Smith and Marpet 4 sacks each and our number is now -10.  Mankins can reduce by 3 now that he is familiar with the system and Dotson can reduce by 1.  That is 14 less sacks.  Throw in Winston at QB, new OC and an improved running game by increasing rushing attempts by 10% and the Bucs could have an additional -12 for a grand total of -26 or 26 sacks in 2015. (26= same # of sacks Bucs allowed in 2012) A strong running game obviously reduces sacks.  Buccaneers had 52 sacks in 2014 (353 ATT, 1375 YDS, 29 RK) 47 sacks in 2013 (420 ATT, 1612 YDS 22 RK) and 26 sacks in 2012 (ATT 416, 1837 YDS, 15 RK).  Below is a breakdown of sacks by OL.  Evan Smith - G 15, GS 15, 4 PEN, 2 SACK  Demar Dotson - G 16, GS 16, 14 PEN, 6 SACK Logan Mankins - G16, GS 16, 5 PEN, 5 SACK Garett Gilkey - G 16, GS 1, 6 PEN, 1.5 SACK Patrick Omameh - G 16, GS 16, 3 PEN, 7 SACK Kevin Pamphile  - G 7, GS 2, 5 PEN, 3 SACK Josh Allen - G 3, GS 0, 0 PEN, 1 SACK Anthony Collins - G 14, GS 14, 9 PEN, 4 SACK Oniel Cousins - G 16, GS 7,5 PEN, 5.5 SACK  If my calculations are correct, the ""George Fucking Warhop"" effect will be offset by the new additions listed above as well as 10% increase in rushing attempts.  If the Bucs do not reduce # of sacks by at least 15 in 2015 George needs to begin filling out applications."

buccaneers,35e4xp,OptimusPrimeTime21,5,Sat May 9 16:08:41 2015 UTC,Don't see that at all. The ball didn't drop below his chest and it was a deep ball so his arm would go back a little further than normal anyways.

Closest thing to a pass that gorgeous from the bucs was Simms but he capped out at ~50 yards :(  Let's face it guys the only time we have seen anything like that at Ray jay is from opposing teams :)  I am pumped!
buccaneers,35e4xp,thegreatcerebral,0,Sun May 10 04:17:27 2015 UTC,"With no pressure and only one defender on a fly route I could have thrown the exact same pass, quit riding his dick until he actually proves himself in a game. I am optimistic about him, but to say he is the best QB we have ever had before he plays one live snap is ridiculous, even if he was drafted first overall. Maybe it's not the best way to look at it but based on 99% of our previous decisions it is extremely likely this will end in a demoralizing and soul crushing failure."
buccaneers,35e4xp,FEO4,2,Sun May 10 13:11:35 2015 UTC,Exactly what I am saying!  We have not had a QB that could make that same pass.  Sure it may be simple but still we have not had that....  Ever!  I'm optimistic...  Why do you want to hate on that?    I would have been just as excited if we would have gotten mariota simply because we have not had a QB.  Seriously!  At best we have been a QB farm for other teams but now maybe we have something.  Don't be so cynical and jaded man.
buccaneers,35e4xp,thegreatcerebral,2,Sun May 10 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"No I'm saying that we have had hundreds of QB's come through here that could throw that pass, it is an easy pass for a mediocre QB especially with no defense. I'm not even being pessimistic I'm just not going crazy and calling him the best QB we have ever had after one easy throw during rookie mini camp. He could easily be the best QB we have ever had BUT that throw does not mean as much as you were implying. That's all."

buccaneers,35e4xp,billmelater,2,Sat May 9 16:40:20 2015 UTC,"The impressive thing about the throw is where he put it... During that route it happened to take forever to develop, will he get that time in the game? no. Will he be able to adjust and make a different throw that takes half the time and still put it in the same position? yes.    That throw was about 1"" from being the best possible throw you could make, if it's 1"" closer bell doesn't extend his arms further with the lunge for the ball and it hits him 100% in stride, which is what people ask for from Brady and Manning."
buccaneers,35e4xp,chemthethriller,0,Sun May 10 17:00:44 2015 UTC,LOL...I was thinking the same thing . That pass took a while to come out . Easy to look good with no pass rush.

Do something more along the lines of the Jaguars or Ravens as far as the numbers are concerned. I love the rest of the uniforms, and equate a lot of the feelings towards some of the changes to the same feelings people had in regards to the changes that were made to the Seahawks uniforms. Those uniforms are now, considered by many, to be some of the better uniforms in the league.  I think people simply need time to adapt and understand that uniforms that break some of the traditional ""rules"" can be just as sexy as the oldschool uniforms some teams still sport. But those numbers... I don't think anyone likes those, and I don't think anyone ever will.  I understand the ""reasoning"" behind them, but there isn't enough basis in the world to ever make them look like anything other than an alarm clock."

Off topic a bit here, but I think the ex factor in our young team's success is Donovan Smith. The idea of starting a raw guy at LT from day 1 is risky, particularly when it's directly tied to Winston's confidence. I hope he'll be ready!"
buccaneers,35ddcs,TheFencingCoach,4,Sat May 9 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, and the only knock I've heard against Smith is a lack of work ethic.  I think that's one of the reasons they put Ali Marpet in the same room as him.  Smith has the size and big school experience; Marpet has an attitude of always wanting to improve.  I think the two of them could push each other in the right direction.  Go Bucs!"

Sure everyone has seen that enormous hit, but unless you have watched him play on college, you probably have no clue how well he blocks.   I watched every down Kenny played at Nebraska, and if he wasn't running a route, he had his body on someone. Regardless of if he is a top 20 WR in the next five years, he will most certainly be a top 20 blocking WR, and teams won't overlook that in the future."
buccaneers,35ddcs,drewbowski22,3,Sat May 9 21:37:21 2015 UTC,The best part about watching him play was his dedication. He'd suffer multiple injuries in a game only to go back out and make a play for his team.

buccaneers,35ddcs,houndstooth37,2,Sat May 9 14:53:04 2015 UTC,"I had only heard of Kenny Bell once before he was drafted. Then I heard everyone touting how good this kid could be and how he was such a steal, practically raving over him. I don't get sold easily on rookies who haven't done anything. I figured he's a third rounder what ever.   This video was the first I have heard him speak too and I was very impressed with how articulate he comes across. I don't know what it is, but he presents himself very well. Appears to have a ton of upside and the smarts to do it."
buccaneers,35ddcs,Robert_The_Tire,2,Sat May 9 18:36:12 2015 UTC,"It would be great if he ended up like a Randall Cobb type.  Cobb had limited production but lots of potential while the Packers still had Greg Jennings and some of their old guard at WR/TE, but as soon as it cleared out (due to Cobb's excellent development), he flourished.  I could see the same thing happening here over a few seasons as Vincent Jackson approaches the end of his stay."

From what I remember, Mike & his buddies got kicked out of the club & got into it with the bouncers. That's all that came out of it.

I thought his lawyer pushed to have the accuser's the trial done in a federal court to avoid having a jury trial. This is an odd move, to say the least. I guess it's a different circumstance since he's the one filing the suit in this case."
buccaneers,35d1w9,woodlickin,5,Sat May 9 04:04:27 2015 UTC,No it was to avoid a judge who is elected. A judge who is elected is more likely to make the decision that keeps him reelected. Federal Judges are appointed.

I'm pretty sure though that both sides honestly believe their side of the story . The truth probably lies in some grey area in between.  The fact is Jameis is rich now , and has a bad reputation to go with all that money , so him suing this college girl for more money will appear bully-ish to the general public.  He'd be better off just winning the civil case and then letting this all go away .She has no more recourse  against him at that point."
buccaneers,35d1w9,dan71,1 point,Tue May 12 11:31:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, we do know what happened. Jameis sat and described in ridiculous detail what happened.

buccaneers,35bpqq,OptimusPrimeTime21,4,Fri May 8 20:25:17 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think its going to be an issue. I think he just lacked a good coaching staff to help guide him where he needs to be. Plus he needs to be surrounded by players who all want to succeed and also want to see him succeed.
buccaneers,35bpqq,FEO4,2,Fri May 8 20:27:44 2015 UTC,Are you implying that we have a competent Oline coach? I think D. Smith could be dominant in 2 years with a great coach and 4-5 years with Warhop. I'm worried we don't have that long.
buccaneers,35bpqq,BucJason,2,Sat May 9 01:49:35 2015 UTC,Here is some 11 on 11 action involving both Marpet and D.Smith.

""  But the more research I do , it really is an exciting pick . I actually think feel better about him than Donovan Smith. I think the safer pick would have been Jake Fisher at 34 , but we'll see how that works out ."
buccaneers,35a0b0,BucJason,8,Fri May 8 11:11:04 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people will agree that Jake Fisher, on paper, was the better pick. But something tells me that this front office knows something we dont or at least sees something that we havent noticed yet about Smith. I mean, the dude has size of a small giant. He could have been a sleeper pick this whole time. Only time will tell."
buccaneers,35a0b0,SpaceAzn_Zen,2,Fri May 8 12:19:20 2015 UTC,"My biggest concern is that it looks like the most common knock against him is his drive and work ethic. He can be the biggest or strongest guy on the line (side note: our 7th-round FB had more bench press reps than Smith), but if he isn't motivated than he'll never reach his potential at this level."
buccaneers,35a0b0,Invisible_Griffin,2,Fri May 8 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"Then maybe that's why we drafted him. We have plenty of guys in our locker room looking to motivate people. See McCoy, Winston, David, etc."
buccaneers,35a0b0,SpaceAzn_Zen,2,Fri May 8 18:14:39 2015 UTC,This was my exact reaction. I was like wtf we traded up to get a DIII lineman?

buccaneers,35a0b0,CaptainObliviousIII,9,Fri May 8 13:30:03 2015 UTC,"I've spoken to a few of my buddies who played D3 ball, and there's one recurring theme: D3 players are better rested and injury exposure is not as high.  So, if Marpet is an actual D1 talent, he's  had less battering to his body and joints.  Whether this is a positive factor, remains to be seen.  He was on the Giants' board for lineman, if that has any weight."
buccaneers,35a0b0,fletch420man,3,Fri May 8 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"Very cool- I didn't make the comment thinking he wasn't good, just posing the interested concern. Actually he looked strong as fuck on that tape piece."

buccaneers,35blry,thedaj,1 point,Sun May 10 03:27:44 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

buccaneers,359oen,alexinawe,4,Fri May 8 07:24:19 2015 UTC,"I think a cool idea would probably just to go check out Raymond James stadium in person. I think they offer tours at the link below that you can check out.  http://raymondjamesstadium.com/about-the-stadium/stadium-tours/  Other than that you might wanna tune in to a little bit of sports radio while you're in town. I would personally suggest 1040 the team around 3 PM on weekdays, that show is called ""the front office"" and  you can call in and chat a about the Bucs if you want. I forget who its hosted by but he's a pretty chill dude, and I think he's usually broadcasting from a different sports bar in the Tampa bay area every day and you can go meet him if you want.  Other than that I can't really think of anything besides maybe getting drunk at a bar while dressed like a pirate and burying your frustration with the team beneath 30 hot wings smothered in bleu cheese, thats the real Buccaneer fan experience.... BUT ANYWAY, check out that other stuff I guess. Go Bucs!"

I know I've only been a fan for 17 or so years, and in that time we've had highs and lows, but we will come back from this. I would have wanted the draft to go differently, but we made our selections and got some great picks and are moving forward with a plan and some awesome talent. I feel great pride in saying that I'm a bucs fan whether we're a Superbowl champ or 2-14. We have been high and we've been low, but we get back up and we take the field and play our hearts out. Its been true since I started watching the bucs as a kid and I love this fucking team for it. Go Bucs!"

Only draw back is he gets most the season off and gets to come back with six games to tune up right before the playoffs. So take away half the wear and tear of a season and... wait. ... just fuck the Cowboys. Really.
buccaneers,3575d2,Rorrexx44,5,Thu May 7 18:28:04 2015 UTC,Why we should have just used a draft pick on him. 7th round and we own his rights.
buccaneers,3575d2,Lazarous86,4,Thu May 7 19:11:50 2015 UTC,hindsight is always 20/20. Every team said no to him during the draft.

I also know he said he wouldn't sign any later than round three, but he can say whatever he wants. You would still own his rights. Even to just trade, you would have gotten back more than a 7th, unless of course he was charged."

There's no downside at all to signing him, and it's all upside upside upside. Unless Collins stabs Romo in the face with an ice pick, I don't see any downside at all."

buccaneers,35652i,Catznhatz,11,Thu May 7 12:53:21 2015 UTC,"Players want to play for a competitive team, and it's mostly a ""psychological"" thing. If Winston (and the other leaders like McCoy, Jackson, ...) succeed in bringing that winning ""vibe"" to the bucs, it will make other players want to play for us, and even better : others players from our team will step up. I predict Doug Martin to have a career year because of this."
buccaneers,35652i,bivukaz,2,Thu May 7 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"That'll be difficult as a backup, since Sims is supposed to be starting now."
buccaneers,35652i,ocxtitan,2,Thu May 7 15:52:13 2015 UTC,I think this is to stimulate Doug and Bobby. Lovie wants to create a battle for the starting job at RB.

We'll obviously see, but for some reason they have little faith in Martin as the main back which is sad as I like him and think he is the victim of poor coaching, offense and O-line."
buccaneers,35652i,ocxtitan,3,Thu May 7 18:07:17 2015 UTC,"I really wasn't impressed by Sims last year, the only impressive, explosive runs out of our offense were from Doug near the end of the season.  That said, it seems like this coaching staff makes their minds up about players very early, and Martin may just be the wrong type of RB for Lovie. Its a waste to just throw away a previous 2000 yards of offense player for stupid reasons like that, which is why I hope with better O-line play we will see a career season out of him.  The better O-line is still a big question mark considering our 2-14 O-line coach not only is still employed, but influenced our draft selection of Smith, and Marpet. If we suck this year, it will be because of Lovie's loyalty to George Warhop, and Warhop's penchant for project players like Cousins and Gilkey."
buccaneers,35652i,particleman1010,1 point,Thu May 7 18:31:54 2015 UTC,That wont last. It's going to be another oniel cousins situation where the coaches take about 4 games to see what the fans already know. Sims is pretty poor at running the ball compared to any average NFL RB.

buccaneers,35652i,bivukaz,4,Thu May 7 22:31:01 2015 UTC,His swagger will help our team and may very well (barring some success) help bring some key talent in later on.
buccaneers,35652i,fletch420man,3,Thu May 7 15:43:28 2015 UTC,"in general, I think attracting players is mostly driven by one of two things.  A winning team attracts players who are looking to win.  A team that is willing to spend (overpay) money on players will attract players looking for a payday.  With that being said, if he does ""just decent"" and the team goes 2-14 again, no, I don't think that will attract players.  Now if his play ends up guiding the Bucs to a record around 8-8, and it is clear we are on the upswing, then yes, I could see some players wanting to come here."
buccaneers,35652i,nutramoil,2,Thu May 7 14:23:43 2015 UTC,Sure. We have a nice area to live in and no state income tax. If this team was viewed as a contender in a weak division it would attract vets that want a ring.

I didn't see too many of his games, but I would often see him motivating the team, hyping up the players, and just basically being a winner. I think he is a great fit, since Gerald McCoy complained last season about players seemingly being okay with losing. Also, like McCoy, I believe Jameis will be hardcore repping the Buccaneers. He's gonna proudly fly the pirate flag"
buccaneers,35652i,WAR_T0RN1226,-2,Fri May 8 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"Does Winston bring something else to the team?   Seafood.  Sorry, I couldn't resist the low-hanging fruit. If Winston does reasonably well this year (by that I mean has an average year or better for a QB), then you might see more free agents willing to sign up, especially receivers. Having a decent QB and all-around team gives a person hope for the future; a lot of players would want in on the ground floor of potential greatness, I think."

buccaneers,35491g,This-Is-My-Moment,9,Wed May 6 23:46:32 2015 UTC,"His ceiling was originally thought to be similar to Matt Ryan, or at least I recall commentators talking about him like that during a Bucs Falcons game. He showed some great ability at times and I don't think he got a fair shot last year when we declared McCown the starter from Day 1, but the organization obviously doesn't believe he's the long term answer.   I like Glennon and I was super excited after the Steelers win last year but I don't think he's our long term answer."
buccaneers,35491g,spideralex90,14,Thu May 7 00:05:23 2015 UTC,Yes they are.  He was never given a legitimate chance.  He came in part way through both bis seasons with two different OCs.  He was also never given a full camp of first team snaps to truly prepare.
buccaneers,35491g,Congzilla,8,Thu May 7 00:39:19 2015 UTC,He is really accurate. Mobility is terrible. He doesn't seem to see the field very well and appears hesitant to pull the trigger at times. He also doesn't come across as a leader.  I still think he can be a starter in this league with a good Oline and receivers but he most likely won't ever become a pro bowl QB in my opinion.
buccaneers,35491g,SkardHard,6,Thu May 7 00:22:55 2015 UTC,Glennon doesn't suck. That doesn't make him a long term solution. Most people on /r/NFL didn't watch all of Tampa Bay games. Glennon never had bad stats but he always left a lot on the field
buccaneers,35491g,houndstooth37,3,Thu May 7 00:25:27 2015 UTC,Totally in agreement. Do I think he can be a top 32 QB in the league? Probably. But the franchise that started him full time would probably be looking for upgrade at every opportunity.  Glennon would have had better career 10 years ago when more teams were built around defense and running game and rules weren't changed to favor passing.
buccaneers,35491g,Skeuld,5,Fri May 8 15:05:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. With some development and one on one attention he could've been a good quarterback. How good of a qb we will never know, at least as long as he's a Buc. There is no doubt that the Bucs haven't put enough effort in pushing Glennon to his max."
buccaneers,35491g,newtothelyte,5,Thu May 7 01:53:53 2015 UTC,"He never had a chance. From the massive collapse of the schiano administration his rookie year to being completely overlooked by lovie last season. Plus when he did play, he played behind one hell of a dumpster fire of an o line. I think if he went to the Browns or the bills those are playoff teams immediately. He's not a guy you can put the entire team on his back like Andrew Luck, but if you play a balanced offense and have a good defense that's not going to dig you into deep holes I think he would take you where you want to go. I honestly can't wait to see this guy get traded just so he has a legit shot to play meaningful football."
buccaneers,35491g,Oneringtofoolthemall,3,Thu May 7 16:32:10 2015 UTC,"I was really disappointed that he didn't start any games toward the end of the season.  Especially when we weren't really looking for wins. It was hard to evaluate him,  he looked strong at times but also made mistakes.  Didn't really give him a chance to see if  they were just rookie mistakes.  I heard from people who attended the game that he wasn't great at finding the open receiver .  I also noticed he played alot differently when he got hit hard, so do most qbs.  Rather have him than a few other current starters.  What's nice is that he'll be good at keeping Winston on his toes"
buccaneers,35491g,krownic,6,Thu May 7 02:08:31 2015 UTC,I would still prefer if he started this year instead of Winston. Not only so Winston can just learn how to be an NFL QB but so Winston also disappears from the National spotlight for a while and doesn't get a rockstar attitude.
buccaneers,35491g,ssdestroyer,1 point,Thu May 7 01:58:53 2015 UTC,Yep pretty much. He got fucked over by Lovie; could've developed him and see what ya had in him last year instead of playing some garbage QB like McCown who's not even on our roster anymore.

We did the right thing to draft a franchise QB when we had the chance.  He's great with the TD /INT ratio though , which makes him a perfect backup QB - will manage the game and not lose it for you single-handidly.

So we could possibly offer to play Collins at RT. This would move Dotson to backup, which could be a tough call to make, but maybe not.   Of course, Collins wants to play Tackle for the money, and LTs make more, so I'm sure he would prefer to play there. I don't know if the Bucs see him as a better fit at LT than D. Smith. If they did, I suppose they could play Smith at RT, RG, or backup Tackle until Dotson is too old/expensive."

buccaneers,35279w,Devils_-_Advocate,4,Wed May 6 14:20:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, do you know what happened with LB Quinton Alston? He was a sleeper for his first three seasons in college even after seeing extensive action from the time when he was a freshman, and then, like you said, exploded in 2014. What changed?  S Chris Hackett & CB Deshazor Everett look to be a great special teams players for us. Sounds like Everett is the prototypical CB for a tampa-2 system, physical and eager to make a tackle.  DT Caushaud Lyons & DE Ryan Delaire sound like good athletes. Think one of them can crack the 53 man roster for a DE position? We're still pretty thin there.  Thanks for the write up on these guys, wishing them all luck."
buccaneers,35279w,sunnyrt,2,Wed May 6 14:33:21 2015 UTC,Quinton Alston played behind James Morris who was signed as an UDFA last year by the Patriots.

buccaneers,352xnw,Scottydoesntknowyou,8,Wed May 6 17:39:13 2015 UTC,Well no one has stated whether or not Winston will start week 1 but it's tough to not start a guy you drafted with the number one pick overall.

buccaneers,352xnw,OptimusPrimeTime21,2,Wed May 6 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"Whats radio?     I'm guessing we have close to the worst oline. JW took a lot of hits in college, he waits til the last second to throw the ball like Rothlisberger.  We play good d lines in first 5 games It's the offseason and there's really shit to talk about except your future brodcasting career.   All reasons to be watchful of how many times JW gets hit in the preseason imo."

Let Glennon take some knocks, let the OL gel, and work Winston in situationally to develop him. We're not going to be serious contenders this year. We could be next year and should be in 2017. Why screw that up?"

I don't care what our record is this year, so long as it moves us closer to a championship in the future.

buccaneers,352xnw,Exayex,1 point,Wed May 6 22:15:41 2015 UTC,"Jameis is a better talent than David Carr and that was one of the historically worst offensive lines in Houston.   While Jameis did take some hits, he showed good pocket presence, being sacked something near 20 times less than Mariota, I believe. The kid has the confidence to take the beating. I'm really not concerned about the line breaking him.   He'll start week 1. Period. He's a significantly better QB than Glennon, so there's no way he would lose a competition. He's also the number 1 pick and considered NFL ready coming into the draft. To start Glennon would be an admission our line is so bad we're sacrificing him, which isn't fair to anybody and should result in somebody getting fired."

buccaneers,350lgc,AerialAces,2,Wed May 6 14:42:07 2015 UTC,Yes If you only go by highlights you'll be convinced that every player is a future Hall of Famer.

It doesn't mean this will be a hurry-up offense.  It doesn't mean shotgun.  If we believe in Jameis' football acumen (which has been applauded by most), this is a good idea -- albeit one with a steeper learning curve than the alternative."
buccaneers,34yi0u,NeonSubtlety,35,Tue May 5 20:59:37 2015 UTC,"We've heard it all before: it's May and the Bucs offense is going to do all sorts of great things like ""score touchdowns"" or ""create mismatches""  or ""feature the no-huddle.""

These fluff pieces will not sway me any longer. The only thing that will get me excited about this team is signs of life on the field. When Koetter runs Run, Run, Screen, Punt every possession this season, it won't be a disappointment to me. I already expect it this time. Let's hope we're pleasantly surprised."

buccaneers,34yi0u,Numeritus,4,Wed May 6 07:49:31 2015 UTC,We were supposed to do the same thing last year.   Our team DOES seem to play better when we're in the hurry up. Especially with having a lot of young offensive guys starting (presumably) it should help give our guys a slight edge.
buccaneers,34yi0u,cchillur,13,Tue May 5 18:04:32 2015 UTC,Yea but we didn't have an offensive coordinator last year
buccaneers,34yi0u,TrueBuccaneersFan,-4,Tue May 5 18:10:18 2015 UTC,...because Lovie decided we don't need no stinkin' coordinator.
buccaneers,34yi0u,AerialAces,5,Tue May 5 23:24:57 2015 UTC,Or because the guy had major heart surgery weeks before the season started?

buccaneers,34yi0u,cchillur,-1,Thu May 7 00:39:56 2015 UTC,yea and why would that affect the whole offseason prep and planning? seemed like they changed the whole offensive game plan because one dude who doesn't even get on the field couldn't be there. I could see switching gears if you went from a mobile QB to a pocket QB or if a workhorse RB went down.
buccaneers,34yi0u,TheCenterOfEnnui,3,Wed May 6 02:14:08 2015 UTC,"That offense is not what Winston does best. He's best under center with time to read the D. If we wanted no-huddle, we should've taken Mariota."
buccaneers,34yi0u,beniro,9,Tue May 5 18:18:18 2015 UTC,"I would argue the opposite.  What the no-huddle does is in fact get the offense and defense both back to the line quickly, letting an intelligent qb dictate more effectively matchups, etc.  It gives the QB more time to do presnap reads and adjustments, not less.  See Peyton's famous tactic of skipping the huddle, getting the team to the line...and then not snapping until there are 5 seconds left on the clock after a bunch of real or fake audibles and motions.  That definitely suits Winston's skillset."
buccaneers,34yi0u,TheHornyHobbit,4,Tue May 5 19:31:33 2015 UTC,This.  We're not going to be like Oregon and run tempo but we will give the QB plenty of time to read and make adjustments at the line.  Jameis had full authority to do that at FSU and Jimbo had to reel him in a couple times when he thought he was changing calls too much.
buccaneers,34yi0u,OptimusPrimeTime21,7,Tue May 5 22:10:42 2015 UTC,"Don't take ""no huddle"" to mean the up tempo offense Oregon and philly run. This just means something as simple as having 2 plays plays called in the huddle then running them consecutively a couple times a game"
buccaneers,34yi0u,WyldKat75,4,Tue May 5 18:53:39 2015 UTC,Any quarterback can run the no huddle and a lot of pocket passers do from time to time. It's not going to be the main part of our offense but will still be implemented.
buccaneers,34yi0u,SheWasEighteen,3,Tue May 5 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"It can be any qb's style. No huddle doesn't mean fast tempo. Manning, Brady, Ryan all run no huddle a lot. It's to keep the defense from making subs so you can keep mismatches and prevent the defense from changing coverages. Winston did this flawlessly in the 4th quarter when coming from behind. It's not going to be our entire offense, just used from time to time when Koetter deems it necessary. Winston can run no huddle very well. It allows him to audible out and change protections (two things he is great at) without allowing the defense to get set."
buccaneers,34yi0u,Wesley420,1 point,Wed May 6 02:38:10 2015 UTC,"As long as they practice it, so they won't abandon it when it works during a game, because they didn't practice it.  I keep saying it could be worse, since we've had worse. Just be better than last year's offense. It's not that hard, since the bar is sitting on the floor.  Please don't step on the bar and injure yourself."

In the words of a fan on another message board ""Lovie took a 4-12 team and somehow made it worse"".  I know Lovie has a new QB and coaches usually buy themselves a few years with a new QB, but not this time. He needs to show major improvement on both sides of the ball this year. Even with a rookie QB. Especially since that QB is better than any QB he's ever had.  P.S. Thank You Lovie for throwing that last game for Jameis. We do kind of owe you for that."
buccaneers,34yjvq,jeff_says_relax,1 point,Tue May 5 22:22:39 2015 UTC,"It seems like everyone completely forgot we went into the 2014 with no offensive coordinator. QB coach Arroyo had no business running an offense. Pair that up with a D line that can't generate QB pressure and CBs who struggled to get it together and you've got a disaster waiting to happen. A lot of those games came down to the wire and could have just as easily been wins, too.  Were we a playoff team if Tedford stayed? Probably not. But then again, I'm totally cool with sacrificing the season to get my favorite FSU QB since Charlie Ward. If Winston busts, I will be one of the first to say I was wrong. But to take a chance on a franchise QB who happens to be a personal favorite, it feels fucking amazing."
buccaneers,34yjvq,ApolloXLII,10,Wed May 6 22:37:49 2015 UTC,"None of them are picking the Bucs because the Bucs were the popular pick in those type of threads last year.

We had a deep receiving corps and a good quarterback this year.  Besides, you're just making biased assumptions about our current crop of receivers, who have done nothing on the field outside of our top 3 guys, and Jameis Winston, who has yet to throw a pass in an NFL game and could very well turn out to be a massive bust."

I think with our weapons on offense, if our oline can be decent we can maybe not average 24 a game, but see more scores of 24 or higher. We only scored more than 24 3 times last year! thats just fucking sad man, I not proclaiming we'll be the broncos and average damn near 30 im just saying I think we can see 24 points or higher, more than half the time, and that has me excited and optimistic if our defense also gets better."
buccaneers,34yjvq,Geddyn,-1,Tue May 5 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"we can maybe not average 24 a game, but see more scores of 24 or higher.  im just saying I think we can see 24 points or higher, more than half the time   Your math doesn't add up. You can't score 24 or more ""half the time"" and average less than 24 points per game. It's one or the other.  You say you weren't optimistic last year, but if you look at your arguments, you'll find that it's essentially identical to the optimism expressed here prior to last season. The dreamers were finally sure we had a good quarterback, they were sure that all the offseason offensive line acquisitions were going to work out, we have Lovie Smith running the defense now, and so on. As we all know, it didn't work out that way.  And, honestly, I was one of those people, which is why I'm playing the ""wait and see"" game rather than making assumptions. If you look at it objectively, this team still has a serious lack of depth, which is critically important when you're relying on a bunch of unknowns to start (we could potentially have 5 rookie starters) and it's essential late in the season when injuries start becoming a factor."
buccaneers,34yjvq,WAR_T0RN1226,3,Tue May 5 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"to your first point you obviously dont do math well, if you have 26 points for 8 games (half) and say 18 points the other 8 games (half) you average 22 ppg, so yes you can have game of more than 24 and average less. its called averages for a reason sometime your under your average sometimes your above your average. last year we averaged 17 ppg. if we score 24 or higher more than 3 times our average will go up say to like 20 thats a recipe for more wins just saying.   Now I was optimistic last year just not confident in McCown we performed worst than I even imagined (I thought we'd win 5-7 games) but then again i thought Glennon would start more games. At the end of the Day I'd always prefer to be more optimistic than not because thats just more fun.   edit: im not saying one way of thinking about our team is better than another im just saying that is my preference. the whole point of my post was to rally the troops in a way."
buccaneers,34yjvq,beniro,1 point,Tue May 5 17:49:29 2015 UTC,"As far as the math goes, I assumed you were saying we'd at least be average half the time and good the other half. I wasn't aware you were predicting scenarios where our offense would come out and absolutely stink the joint up, dragging the points per game back down to mediocre levels.  You can be as optimistic as you want. I'm just going to stick with being a realist, since it'll lead to less stress later in the year if it turns out that my predictions are correct."
buccaneers,34yjvq,SharkBaituaha,1 point,Tue May 5 17:58:39 2015 UTC,"I get you on the math, but seeing as we scored 17 or less 12 times last year, anything above 17 points, which we hit on the nose 6 times, is an improvement. I think anyone on this sub would take us averaging 20 ppg.  Nothing wrong with being a realist man, I hope for both our sake tho we just get to watch a more competitive exciting product on the field!"
buccaneers,34yjvq,beniro,1 point,Tue May 5 18:08:47 2015 UTC,Yeah my friend and I looked dumb after we were talking about how good the Bucs might be in the upcoming season around this time last year
buccaneers,34yjvq,Seoul_Surfer,3,Tue May 5 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"Well, we really haven't done enough on the oline. We have the same guys, minus Cousins and Collins and we added three youngsters. Calling the OL fixed is wishful thinking. We are running a new offense with new players, mostly rookies, penciled in as starters at several positions. Let's keep it realistic. If this offense plays well out of the gate, it will be a huge bonus. I just hope that by the end of the year, mistakes are fewer and farther between. We should see some big plays early on, though."
buccaneers,34yjvq,LaGoku,2,Tue May 5 17:42:20 2015 UTC,I think if our offense puts up at least 20 points a game(barring extreme chemistry) we can make the playoffs. Our defense is gonna be good this year.

I think Jameis is that good, and your defense is going to be strong to allow him some time to grow and still win games. You guys are my dark horse for your division/wildcard.   Edit: just to add on, I've been a fan of Jameis since he's come out of high school, so I thoroughly believe in his leadership and ability to immediately impact a team, there's a story about him screaming at the offense whilst still being a Redshirt Freshmen, and if memory serves correctly it was the C who said that they very quickly bought into what he was saying. You can't teach that type of natural gravity that draws people to respect you and want to play for you."

I feel like that takes away a lot of the motivation to be great and earn the big money. Could be a reason why a lot of first round draft picks turn out to be busts.
buccaneers,34ymrb,SkardHard,2,Tue May 5 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"I agree that there's nothing to work towards. There's needs to be some sort of carrot to work for but also the franchise has to show some loyalty, where's the line drawn."
buccaneers,34ymrb,SkardHard,1 point,Tue May 5 20:45:54 2015 UTC,I feel like for a $25 million dollar contract. The bonus should be more in the range of 5-8 mil. Not 15 -16 mil up front ( basically 2/3 of their entire contract).

buccaneers,34y2gq,Geddyn,1 point,Tue May 5 17:00:24 2015 UTC,Marpet would move to center if I was to guess - with Mankins and Dotson as the only holdovers.
buccaneers,34y2gq,spideralex90,2,Tue May 5 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"Cutting EDS wouldn't save any money though. His $3.75M salary would simply convert to $3.75M in dead money since he just signed his deal last year. On the over hand, cutting Mankins would save the team $7M with no dead money. Mankins is 33, EDS is 28. Neither played lights out football last year. My guess would be Mankins gets sent packing, saving more money without Marpet having to learn a new position."
buccaneers,34y2gq,jaemarl,1 point,Tue May 5 21:15:46 2015 UTC,"I'm operating under the assumption that Mankins is only going to stick around for another year or two before retiring, which would leave Deitrich-Smith in the middle and Smith/Marpet on either side of him."
buccaneers,34y2gq,ForgiveMyFlatulence,1 point,Wed May 6 03:18:56 2015 UTC,Isn't he only able to sign for a certain amount of money as a UDFA? If so what can teams offer him to make him chose them?
buccaneers,34y2gq,Mr-Mills,3,Tue May 5 20:36:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, every team is limited to the league minimum, 3 years/$1.575M, so no one can really offer much in the way of more money. Theoretically, you could offer the entire UDFA bonus pool of $89k, but since most teams have signed a bunch of UDFAs that ship has sailed for most teams. As /u/Mr-Mills pointed out below, we don't have a state tax so he would keep the largest possible amount of his $1.575M by signing in Florida. The only other financial considerations I can think of would be offering to fully guarantee the deal and not installing any offsets in the contract to potentially recover guarantee money should he get cut and sign elsewhere.   Mostly, I think it simply boils down to a good old fashioned college football style recruiting campaign. I imagine that's why Jameis is reported to be recruiting the dude personally. Hopefully the prospect of protecting the blind side of the potential next great QB will carry some weight. If not, maybe our numerous strip clubs and cheap, plentiful drugs will do the trick. :)"
buccaneers,34y2gq,Mr-Mills,-1,Tue May 5 21:49:24 2015 UTC,"I think with the additions of Smith and Marpet that the Bucs wouldn't be interested.  If only because they don't want any more people with checkered pasts due to the flack they're receiving from the Winston pick.    Also, as talented as Collins may be they could be pretty comfortable with who they have.  With Dotson, Mankins, EDS, and the two rookies the line looks a lot better.  That's my take at least."
buccaneers,34y2gq,jaemarl,5,Tue May 5 16:06:05 2015 UTC,"Every single team in the NFL should be interested in him, including the Bucs- provided he is cleared. At this point he is not even a suspect so it appears he got pretty screwed by this whole process. In the end though, you have the opportunity to add a first round OL talent for PEANUTS. I would hope they are talking to his agent. Florida has not state income tax so that UDFA limit will spread a little farther. I'd offer him all of our allowed bonus money as well. He could start immediately, battling D. Smith for LT with the loser pushing to RG. This would let Marpet season a bit until he replaces Mankins at LG."
buccaneers,34y2gq,Mr-Mills,1 point,Tue May 5 16:24:57 2015 UTC,We still have Dotson. He's a fine RT.
buccaneers,34y2gq,Exayex,1 point,Tue May 5 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about Florida not having state tax, but I think most of that bonus money is gone. I haven't seen the actual figures yet, but after signing 14 UDFAs there likely isn't much left. Still though, if you're looking at a deal only worth $1.5M total, it would be wise to sign it in a place where you can avoid the most taxes.   Also, I would think the loser of the great hypothetical rookie tackle battle would go to LG so they could dump Mankins and save $7M. Granted, the idea of starting a rookie QB behind 3 rookie OL give me indigestion, I think it's the best thing long term. That is so long as Jameis doesn't get David Carred and survives his rookie year."
buccaneers,34y2gq,SkardHard,1 point,Tue May 5 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"I don't see any scenario where they start two rookies on the left side, just my opinion. Mankins is a guy valued for leadership and example, something I think the Bucs wont mind paying for that for one more season."
buccaneers,34y2gq,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Tue May 5 20:55:45 2015 UTC,Checkered past? The dudes pregnant girlfriend was murdered and he's been cleared of being a suspect. That's pretty harsh to throw around.  He's worth the risk as his price tag is nowhere near his value. We would be stupid to not take his fine ass out to the restaurant of his choice and try to get him on board.
buccaneers,34y2gq,jaemarl,1 point,Wed May 6 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. Mankins has one or two years left. Dotson is serviceable but no where near pro bowl caliber. EDS is a below average Center.  If Collins is cleared, then he does not have a checkered past. The only knock on him was work ethic. He was projected as the 1st or 2nd best LT in the draft. We would be absolutely crazy to not try to sign him, especially at an undrafted free agent salary."

buccaneers,34umat,infecteddh,3,Mon May 4 20:04:10 2015 UTC,I was just wondering the same.  Pretty sure at least once we also wore dark pants with white tops.  I was wondering if this is a message or just what they had around for the shoot or having him change pants a few times takes to long?
buccaneers,34umat,beerwithanolive,2,Tue May 5 00:23:37 2015 UTC,White tops with dark pants was more common than White on white if I recall correctly. We never had Red tops with white bottoms that I know of.
buccaneers,34umat,OGbuc,2,Tue May 5 00:41:13 2015 UTC,Yet those photos were all with white pants.  Might be nothing.  Might be hint.
buccaneers,34umat,newtothelyte,3,Tue May 5 01:40:17 2015 UTC,"I think they probably just started with white on white and didn't want to make him change pants during the photoshoot.  Red and white looks bad IMO. Very top heavy, and on the big dudes it makes them look like the coolaid man."

buccaneers,34umat,freddamnrock,2,Tue May 5 14:28:12 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why he picked #3? I can understand not wanting #5 because the last person to wear it. My guess is its kind of like Carmello Anthony and #7 in New York. He wore 22 in HS and 15 at SU and in Denver so 22-15=7. Makes sense if thats why. Just wondering if anyone had read anything else about it.

buccaneers,34vp75,beniro,5,Mon May 4 23:16:30 2015 UTC,Sam is not good . Period.  He is a below average athelete and his game did not translate . Not to mention he doesn't seem committed to putting in the work to be great . He's more concerned with building up his celebrity doing TV shows than hitting the gym.  There's a reason he can't make a team and it's not because he's gay .
buccaneers,34vp75,Lotfa,4,Tue May 5 11:29:25 2015 UTC,Agree the celebrity stuff is annoying but hey if he isn't getting work any other way I can't say I blame him.  As far as him being untalented...there's no way he doesn't go second or third round last year if he didn't come out as gay.  Look how dominant he was against Florida in the highlights I posted.  That kind of havoc isn't created by untalented players.
buccaneers,34uzof,MyPenLeaksFire,6,Mon May 4 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"Not a Bucs fan, but I live right by Tampa and went to UCF. I covered the team in 2013, just to give a little background.   I couldn't believe he went undrafted. If you watch games and never knew their 40 times, you'd say that Hall was just as fast, if not faster than Perriman.   He's a poor man's Percy Harvin. Not sure who your slot receiver is, but I wouldn't be surprised to see Hall get some playing time there this season.   In my opinion, he's never been given the credit he deserves. I love Perriman too, but Hall was the guy I'd be comfortable with giving a steady dose of touches. Perriman was always good for a big play or two, but Hall consistently made it happen.  UCF was never a team that passed the ball a lot, and often had a cast of players to spread the ball around to. The receiving corps was loaded during his time at UCF. Another name the Knights had was JJ Worton, who made that crazy one handed catch against Temple during 2013.   I know there's not going to be a whole lot of opportunities for Hall to get touches with Evans, Jackson and Jenkins, but just know you can rely on him when his number is called.   I'm confident he'll make the team and vy for playing time. He's a beast."
buccaneers,34uzof,I_Hold_Up_Buses,3,Mon May 4 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I spent entirely too long trying to think of who Jenkins was...lol"
buccaneers,34uzof,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Mon May 4 20:56:36 2015 UTC,"We really don't have a slot guy, so there's honest competition there and if he can get the job then more power to him. Hope he can play some special teams too though, he's gonna need to be versatile"
buccaneers,34uzof,Papalew32,5,Tue May 5 01:46:07 2015 UTC,"Went to UCF and can confirm, this guy is lightning in a bottle.   I will not be surprised if he's a solid WR3-4 and could even beat out Bell for the slot if Bell is afraid to go over the middle.   Hall is a big play guy who was the most confident 3rd down receiver on UCF (yes over 1st rounder Perriman). He won't get the return man slot because he's a step too slow but I can't wait to see Jameis hit him on some crossing routes.  Charge On!"
buccaneers,34uzof,SkardHard,3,Mon May 4 22:26:34 2015 UTC,Wow I was not expecting to be that impressed. His run after catch game is pretty fucking good. I'm surprised he went undrafted.
buccaneers,34uzof,SpaceAzn_Zen,2,Mon May 4 20:57:08 2015 UTC,"Probably has to do with his size. He is a very small guy. Nowadays, everyone is looking for those tall ""just throw it up and let me go after it"" receivers. Aka Kelvin Benjamin, Mike Evans, etc."
buccaneers,34uzof,mel_to_the_core,3,Tue May 5 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"This dude is tailor made for the Z.  Can catch in traffic, while getting hit.  Refuses to go down on first contact.  Love his spin move.  Every one is clamoring for Bell as a slot receiver but I see him spelling Jackson on the perimeter.  If Hall can maintain the same tenacity at the next level he not only makes the team but sees a lot of action."

buccaneers,34tgb8,MediumRed,3,Mon May 4 22:33:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, the Oakland game got everyone thinking the guy was amazing bc of some fluke runs against a bad team. The Doug Martin I know runs straight into the O-line's back on 1st and 2nd down setting up a 3rd and 9 Glennon incompletion."

The first one he gets knocked on his back, the second he runs out of the frame of the video and you don't see him do anything, and the third Hackenburg throws a pick on the play. Not saying he necessarily looks horrible on the plays, but I just feel like they could have picked better highlights haha."

buccaneers,34t98h,jaemarl,7,Mon May 4 12:00:07 2015 UTC,"Things I found interesting:   Licht’s brother-in-law asked him via a draft-day text last year whether he preferred Johnny Manziel or Teddy Bridgewater in the first round. “Winston,” was Licht’s reply.   On Winston playing baseball:   In the contract, a Bucs’ source said, is a clause prohibiting Winston from playing professional baseball during the life of his Tampa Bay deal.   And on Winston's recall after they tried to  overload him with new plays, formations, etc:   Licht was blown away by Koetter’s impression after that couple of hours with Winston. “I’m going to compare every guy I test like that the rest of my career to Jameis,” Koetter told Licht."
buccaneers,34t98h,Invisible_Griffin,3,Mon May 4 15:02:29 2015 UTC,"The baseball thing is very much standard.  He's a pitcher.  If anything happened to his throwing arm it would be very bad for his football career and for the team he plays for.  If he were a middle infielder like Russell Wilson is when he does his ST stuff with the Rangers, I don't think it would have been requested."
buccaneers,34t98h,LansdowneStreet,11,Mon May 4 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"The best thing in this entire article is right here:   One of the football things that convinced the Bucs to pick Winston happened in March. Winston was already the clear leader in the clubhouse, but the team summoned him to spend a day with the coaches at One Buc Place. Now came the test. They’d give this test to both Winston (first) and then Mariota (a week later). Winston reported to the facility one day in early March, and offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter and quarterback coach Mike Bajakian taught him what he’d learn on the first day of rookie minicamp. “Day 1 Install,” it was called. Fifteen plays, runs and passes, with a slew of formations, progressions in the quarterback’s read, snap counts, coverages, hot receivers if the defense blitzed, offensive-line protections. Bajakian took 90 minutes to explain the “install,” flying through it on purpose, to throw a lot at Winston to see what he’d remember—more conceptually than in memorization. Then, as part of the information-overload, the coaches took him to lunch in the Bucs cafeteria, introducing him to a slew of people, talking to him about his family, doing whatever to get his mind off the football and on to something else. They wanted to test his recall, and his football acumen.  Back in the quarterback meeting room after lunch, Bajakian put tape of the plays they’d be installing on the big screen. What’s your formation here, Jameis? The protection? Your route progression? Who’s your hot receiver? Play after play, for 45 minutes they went through it. Winston remembered it all. Koetter has been coaching college and pro football since 1985. He is not a gee-whiz coach. Licht was blown away by Koetter’s impression after that couple of hours with Winston. “I’m going to compare every guy I test like that the rest of my career to Jameis,” Koetter told Licht."

buccaneers,34t98h,fiddlestix42,4,Mon May 4 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"Loved the part about ""Day 1 install"" and the fact that Jameis had the concepts, and not just memorization, down.  He can be coached the throw the ball away more and not go for the Sports Center Top 10 plays all the time."
buccaneers,34t98h,tusocalypse,4,Mon May 4 13:19:12 2015 UTC,This is interesting -- on a later page he writes the Bucs top board picks.  Marcus Mariota was the fourth-rated player on the Tampa Bay draft board. The top five:    Jameis Winston. Leonard Williams. Dante Fowler. Marcus Mariota. Todd Gurley.
buccaneers,34t98h,mikepickthis1whnhigh,5,Mon May 4 16:04:07 2015 UTC,"I just wish we could keep our expectations reasonable with Winston.  I get the impression that if he's not great right away people are going to be disappointed, and lots of truly excellent quarterbacks were not great right away.  The best players on the 2015 Buccaneers will still be largely defensive players.  Winston has all the potential in the world, but football is still a team sport and Koetter (as well as guys like Logan Mankins) still need to put him in a position to succeed.    Hopefully the defense continues to come around so we don't put the game in a rookie's hands every week."
buccaneers,34t98h,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Mon May 4 12:55:43 2015 UTC,"If the current build we're trying succeeds we can probably expect at least 6 wins. If we striked gold, we might be over 8. Anything more would be a dream come true. Anything less would be disappointing."
buccaneers,34t98h,mistergosh,1 point,Mon May 4 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know, there's a chance the defense makes The Leap (remember, the best two players on this team and the two players with the highest ceiling--even after the draft--are Lavonte David and Gerald McCoy) and we end up with somewhere between 8 and 10.  There's a transition period to the defense Lovie was trying to install, and it should be over now."
buccaneers,34t98h,LansdowneStreet,2,Mon May 4 15:09:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, my personal expectation is also between 8 and 10, precisely because I expect the defense to step up a lot. I think our last season record can be deceiving because of how we were looking the last month of the regular season and the amount of close games we had.  But i also like to keep in mind the acceptable minimum, because we know that if we have a losing season Bucs fans are going to be all ""fire everyone"", ""bust"" and stuff. Not productive. TB media can be really fucking weird when you're not from there.  I think that minimum will probably be 6 wins with a truckload of close games. As long as there's no blowouts against us and the team doesn't fall apart after that, 6 wins should keep the current management in place and we can continue to improve in the long run. Which also applies to Winston."
buccaneers,34t98h,mistergosh,1 point,Mon May 4 15:23:51 2015 UTC,"Everyone has rammed down our throats during this whole process how ""pro ready"" Winston is. Pro ready , Pro ready , Pro ready.

We weren't there, we're not defense attorneys, and the people who take it one step farther and say horrible things about an accuser around whom we have just as little evidence in either direction can sit on a hot iron rod.  Seriously, some things aren't about football, and why people need to opine on this is insane.  We don't know what happened, we likely never will, our society believes strongly in not condemning people as guilty until we can prove it, and right now we can't prove anything about anyone.    If that ever changes I'll have an opinion on the matter.  Until then, you want to go out on that limb be my guest."

I just don't want to hear anything about it myself, so it's good to be armed with articles like these that state the facts so clearly."
buccaneers,34rlkq,LansdowneStreet,3,Mon May 4 16:27:06 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Not taking an opinion.  You want to feel it's your civic duty to defend one player on a football team because someone might dare make a joke about him, that very much continues to not be my job.  And by the way you're not defending him because you want people to know the truth.  You're defending him because he got drafted by your team, Mr. Matlock."
buccaneers,34rlkq,ocxtitan,1 point,Mon May 4 16:32:24 2015 UTC,"I just like to avoid the jokes, so if I can do something as simple as supply a link to potentially prevent hearing about it I will.  And you know nothing about why I'm defending him, I feel for the kid. He has worked his ass off for what he has accomplished and where he is, but he's still just a kid, prone to making mistakes and because he is an athlete and, yes I'll say it, black, he is going to be assumed to be a thug and guilty any time his character is questioned.  I feel very strongly that anyone wrongly accused of rape should be, as OP worded it, vehemently defended as the accuser has it so easy, being able to claim whatever they want knowing rape is such a guilty until proven innocent thing, even if not legally, then mentally for a lot of people. I had statutory rape threatened on me when I began dating someone just a couple years younger than me about 10 years ago and that threat of being pursued for a crime in something that is consensual hits close to home."
buccaneers,34rlkq,LansdowneStreet,2,Mon May 4 16:47:25 2015 UTC,"I just like to avoid the jokes   Go find a Steelers fan and ask them how much they care.  And whether any one of them feels that the burden of proof is on them to defend their quarterback.  To be honest I've read these stories and I'm not nearly as confident that I know what happened as you are.  I don't, and I don't think I ever will, and honestly with no reason to assume the worst or the best I'll just write it off as something that doesn't deserve an opinion.  I don't feel the need to defend him.  I think it is going out on a very stupid limb to talk about the accuser the way that some people here do.  I feel this way for the same reason I think Winston is treated unfairly.  How about we don't assume something pretty horrible about somebody without knowing all the facts?  Seems like a bad boat to hop onto if you ask me.  If his character is questioned again, for legitimate football reasons and not ""he celebrated something oh no whatever shall we do,"" then his character might just be questionable.  Bottom line:  As moronic as it is for people to assume that Winston did something pretty much unthinkable, it's not a whole lot brighter to go the opposite direction.  We don't know, and probably never will.  Good luck with your certainty."

My sister was raped in college, and thus, I take this kind of thing very seriously. Had I believed that Jameis was a rapist, I was prepared to drop my buccaneer fandom.   I did a lot of research leading up to the draft, and I have publicly made my concerns about Winston very clear and those concerns remain. I don't believe he is a rapist, and I will never root for a player who is one."
buccaneers,34rlkq,Congzilla,2,Mon May 4 14:55:11 2015 UTC,"I do need to know that the guy I'm going to be rooting for for the next 10 (???) years isn't a rapist.   Sorry, unless you can put yourself in the room you can't know.  You can read a bunch of biased articles one way by national publications looking for an example of something we're all vaguely sure is happening somewhere.  Or you can read a bunch of articles by local and FSU-based publications that clearly couldn't possibly be biased in any significant way...   Had I believed that Jameis was a rapist, I was prepared to drop my buccaneer fandom.   There's no opinion or belief about it.  I lean on American heritage here:  We don't know, we have no way of knowing, and because we don't know it is wrong to assume one way or the other.  Therefore, until we learn more--and we likely will not--it's best to leave it be.  Dude if he's any kind of person that hurts other people like that, I'm pretty sure the vast majority of people would not root for him and anyone remaining isn't worth listening to.  And we have no reason to assume he is.  However, I would stop well the fuck short of anything more than that.  There is, after all, a huge difference between ""not guilty"" and ""innocent.""    I have publicly made my concerns about Winston very clear and those concerns remain.   I have one enormous concern about his character, and this is the only way I can put it:  Seems like every FSU guy came out of the woodwork to defend this guy these past four months.  All of the except Warrick Dunn, who I can't find even saying his name.  If Dunn had come out and spoken on his behalf, I'm listening to that guy.  I guess his status as part-owner of the Falcons probably forbids him from saying much, but still, that he hasn't said anything makes me a little cautious."

buccaneers,34rlkq,horsedoodoo,2,Mon May 4 11:29:46 2015 UTC,"In my mind, he likely figured some crab legs aren't that big of a deal for me, but if someone was hooking him up and he's getting asked about it, he doesn't want them to lose their job so he covers it as him stealing them.  I can't blame him if that's what happened, as someone losing their job over it is much worse than me taking the fall and just getting bad jokes told about me for years to come."

This case is one where the more you read, the more you believe Jamies is not guilty. Now that you guys have the vested interest, I hope more of your fans will really look into what happened and figure out based on the facts presented, the most likely situation, is that this girl felt bad about cheating on her boyfriend, the encounter left a bad taste in her mouth, and then she got in way over her head with exaggerated accusations. Of course, I could be way off and she might be telling the truth, but if you read the SAO  report and the police report, no facts favor her."

But we do know with certainty some of the dumb shit he did get caught doing.  I can understand people's reservations.  It is totally up to him to walk the talk and prove himself worthy as the face of the franchise.  I think he can do it, but it's on him not the fans."

buccaneers,34rkl0,ssdestroyer,2,Mon May 4 21:58:03 2015 UTC,"He'll compete with a few guys during camp and I think they'll find a weak replacement that's just as good, but younger and cheaper.   Either way I don't feel like he is a major problem for us. How well the rookies pick up the offense worries me more. If we can start the season at 3-3 we'll be in good shape going forward."
buccaneers,34rkl0,illicit_injun,3,Mon May 4 01:30:26 2015 UTC,"I would have to disagree, he was something like a bottom 5 over if not worse. You don't need an amazing punter, but a good punter can help the team immensely. The Seahawks punter is an animal.

buccaneers,34q2fp,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Sun May 3 15:51:21 2015 UTC,"I think a 4-2 divison record is realistic. The saints and falcons are on the decline. I think theyre a mess on the defensive side of the ball, and although theyve strengthed their  O-line they lost their biggest weapon and are going to have a rough year. They will slide and are sweepable. I Think we split50/50 with the Panthers this year. Our home game with them is early in the season so I chose home field to split. We could lose at home and win on the road late in the year.  but 10-6 is attainable."
buccaneers,34q2fp,iamdylanshaffer,3,Sun May 3 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"You think the Falcons are in decline? I personally think they're the favorites to win the division this year. They might perform poorly early in the season, but they did amazingly well drafting this year - especially through some picks that will help ramp up that defense. I think the offense won't see much of a drop off either, and you obviously still have Ryan leading the charge.  I don't see them being great, but the Saints will struggle, and I don't think the Panthers will improve enough to beat out the Falcons this year.  I think the Saints will finish poorly, the Falcons will come out 10-6, and both the Panthers and ourselves will ride the middle around 7-9."
buccaneers,34q2fp,brownrd2,1 point,Sun May 3 18:08:03 2015 UTC,Yes They had a good draft but still have more holes than we do. Thei offense is going to take a step back this year big time. And their D is still suspect. I see an 8-8 team at MAX. The panthers are on the rise so are we. I think the Saints are the worst in the division this year.
buccaneers,34q2fp,brownrd2,2,Sun May 3 18:20:12 2015 UTC,Please explain to me how Falcons offence is going to take a huge step back this season? What pieces have the we lost that make you think that? Im genuinely curious to get a non-homer opinion.
buccaneers,34q2fp,jaemarl,1 point,Sun May 3 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"I dont believe in your coordinator. I think he's talented but his offenses have been inconsistent for a while. Matt Ryan flourished under Koetter, I don't think Shanny get's the same out of him. In the pass catching category you have Julio. Roddy is slowing down. Hester has never been anything as a WR. Freeman has flashes, but I dont see him lighting the world on fire. I don't know much about Coleman TBH, and  I don't think you have anything at TE.   With that being said,  I think you guys are going to taking a step back. Huge maybe an overstatement though."
buccaneers,34q2fp,brownrd2,1 point,Sun May 3 19:07:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, Koetter was super predictable in his last couple of seasons, he wasn't getting anything done. He would consistently run it up the middle with Jackson for no yards, and then do it again expecting different results, also WR screens all day...It got very predictable and repetitive. Shanahan should help bring an explosive passing game that this team is capable of with Julio and Roddy.  We're also going to a ZBS in the run game, which is what Freeman excelled in in college, as well as Coleman who had more than 2000 yrds last season and 15TDs. They should form a very capable RBBC, likely with Coleman getting a few more carries (although it's way too early to say this for sure), the running game has definitely improved.  We also drafted Justin Hardy, who although I'll admit I hadn't heard of until a couple days ago, seems to have very sure hands, although nothing super flashy, basically a young Roddy White.   TE is still a concern, but that's no different than last season. We signed Moeaki, and Tamme in free agency so there is at least some competition and maybe one of them turns out to be okay, basically anything is better than Toilolo.  I would be VERY surprised if the offence took a step back this season. I think Kyle Shanahan is a much better fit for ATL than the ever predictable Dirk Koetter. We have also made efforts to actually get a running game, and have shored up the WR group behind Roddy and Julio with Hardy (draft) and Hankerson (FA), although we did lose Douglas.  Also it should be fairly obvious to everyone that the defence is almost certain to be better than last season...ATL is not on the decline, although it may take more than just this season to see the full potential."
buccaneers,34q2fp,jaemarl,2,Sun May 3 22:13:17 2015 UTC,"I'd like to preface my statement by stating that I am not terribly familiar with the Falcons offensive line, but I am somewhat familiar with the type of linemen Shanahan prefers for his zone blocking scheme.   Do you think Atlanta has the right personnel to fully implement a ZBS? I fully expected Atlanta to make a bunch of moves to overhaul the line this offseason assuming that Koetter's personnel wouldn't fit the scheme (which again is only an assumption based on likelihood rather than an actual evaluation of Atlanta's offensive line). I only recall seeing Person signed during free agency. Only 1 pick in the draft. Other than not resigning Blalock I can't really think of any moves that would signal a change in blocking scheme to the outside world (other than hiring a Shanahan of course).  Do you think it's simply a matter of Shanahan being convinced the existing personnel can pull it off? If I were an Atlanta fan I would at least be a little worried.  Also, I like to get your opinion on Justin Blalock. What's his deal? How come no one has signed him yet? I recall him being a pretty solid OG that was only not resigned because he no longer fit the scheme."
buccaneers,34q2fp,Frozen_Fusion,1 point,Mon May 4 15:54:40 2015 UTC,"A lot of people were expecting to draft a linemen higher than we did, that's basically the only knock against Atlanta's draft (other than people whining about Gurley in the first, but thats just ridiculous imo). Currently the line is looking like, from left to right, Matthews, ???? (Baker probably if healthy), Hawley, Asamoah, Schraeder.   Hawley, Schraeder and Matthews should fit nicely into a ZBS, Schraeder really stepped up last season, and he's a lighter guy so should be able to move quickly and be effective in a ZBS, kinda the same deal with Hawley and Matthews. Asamoah came from the Chiefs who employed a ZBS scheme while he was there and he was pretty decent in that offence as well so he should be okay. So the line is actually surprisingly well equipped to make a quick transition into zone blocking, the big question though is LG...Baker could be okay, except he'll probably injure himself putting on his cleats. So to answer your question, no I'm not too worried the line should be serviceable this season although there is a question mark at LG still.  Blalock would not fit the scheme at all, which is why he isn't around anymore. Why he hasn't been picked up though I don't know. He'd be a pretty solid backup at least on most teams, possibly compete for a starting role as well."
buccaneers,34q2fp,Kloohorn,1 point,Mon May 4 23:40:09 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound too bad. It's very lucky, I don't think a lot of teams would be able to transition to a ZBS so easily. Unlikely the other divisional rivals I don't really hate the Falcons. I was a fan of the late 90s Dirty Birds and loved to watch Jamal Anderson. I even stayed in Buckhead for a while until I got my ass kicked by a bunch of DeKalb County Sheriff's Deputies."

If I had a dollar every time I've seen a pre-season prediction say we're getting double digit wins, winning the NFC South, or making the playoffs only to under-perform and underachieve, I could buy the team myself and finally release GARRETT FUCKING GILKEY."

Good on you for having the right attitude  I think you're overestimating the decline of the Falcons a little bit. Dimitroff has kept them on the right track since he came in and Pioli only helps things. They haven't improved as much as we have, no question there, but I see almost the exact same team skill level wise as last year.  I am right with you on the Saints though. With Drew at the helm it's hard to write them off completely for that away game but I think we can grab it especially if we start the season off right vs Tennessee"

buccaneers,34p11m,mikepickthis1whnhigh,1 point,Sun May 3 22:27:34 2015 UTC,I think this is a pretty good explanation of what is essentially the bread and butter system  of a Koetter-run offense.
buccaneers,34p11m,iamdylanshaffer,1 point,Sun May 3 22:55:28 2015 UTC,Wow -- this was a terrific read. Thanks for this.   Reading how much the author emphasized the importance of the o-line for these schemes -- it makes me really feel the importance of these new guys we just drafted. I'm pretty nervous about it. I hope they fix those problem areas this offseason.   On a side note -- do you know of websites like that for the Bucs? That author went so in-depth.
buccaneers,34p11m,mikepickthis1whnhigh,1 point,Mon May 4 03:02:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it's part of SB Nation, and they have individual blogs for each of the NFL teams. The Buccaneer's blog can be found at: http://www.bucsnation.com/, however, I can't personally vouch for the quality because I'm not a regular reader and as I'm sure you're aware, the quality is directly related to the quality of the writers, which vary from blog to blog.  But, it's more than likely that you will find some good content in there every so often, paired with some sub-par content as well."
buccaneers,34p11m,iamdylanshaffer,4,Mon May 4 03:36:57 2015 UTC,I hope we get on Hard Knocks. We need to raise our National profile.
buccaneers,34p11m,MrRIP,2,Sun May 3 15:39:23 2015 UTC,I hope that was for joke value.
buccaneers,34p11m,yardballs,5,Sun May 3 20:45:27 2015 UTC,No really I just want to see more bucs
buccaneers,34p11m,MrRIP,2,Sun May 3 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"Okay,I'd rather see something less made for TV,but I get it.Thumbs up."
buccaneers,34oysl,RainbowUnicorns,14,Sun May 3 05:27:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Winston will actually make less money this year than McCown made last year, but it isn't representative of any perceived value. For those that aren't aware, starting in 2011 the CBA predetermined the amount for both the value and length of rookie contracts depending on when you were picked. Winston gets the biggest slice, Mariota a little less, Fowler less still, and so on down the line. There is surprisingly little to actually negotiate anymore. The idea was to keep draft busts from hurting teams too badly and to get rookies signed and put to work quickly. It's kind of surprising more guys don't do what Matt Elam did in 2013 and just not hire an agent."
buccaneers,34oysl,jaemarl,6,Sun May 3 08:47:52 2015 UTC,"It also was done to avoid hold outs. Andre Smith of the Bengals (chronicled in Hard Knocks) was the 6th pick in 2009 who held out for more money, then ended up being a player who played significantly worse than their draft position. That was kind of a double whammy."
buccaneers,34oysl,Numeritus,5,Sun May 3 13:50:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I meant when I said ""signed and put to work quickly."" I suppose I should have been more clear.   I always feel a bit of satisfaction when a hold out has a shitty season. I'm glad rookie hold outs are a thing of the past."
buccaneers,34oysl,jaemarl,1 point,Sun May 3 14:45:48 2015 UTC,"Ahh, my bad. I never understood why players did it. You might gain an extra $1m or something, but you do irreparable damage to your image. You look selfish and greedy and start on the wrong foot with management and your fan base."

buccaneers,34oysl,CaptainObliviousIII,5,Sun May 3 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"For those that aren't aware, starting in 2011 the CBA predetermined the amount for both the value and length of rookie contracts depending on when you were picked.   Thankfully.  If the old system were still in place, #1 overall pick contracts would have ballooned to the point where signing Winston wouldn't leave us any room to re-sign Lavonte David or any other young guys who pan out."
buccaneers,34oysl,Geddyn,2,Sun May 3 15:17:00 2015 UTC,I wonder if they would have even taken winston without the new contracts...
buccaneers,34oysl,jkd0027,2,Sun May 3 17:58:35 2015 UTC,The #1 overall pick would have gotten an absurd amount of money regardless of position under the old system.
buccaneers,34oysl,Geddyn,4,Sun May 3 18:13:03 2015 UTC,his 2nd contract will be the interesting part.
buccaneers,34oysl,Qbert_Spuckler,14,Sun May 3 13:46:21 2015 UTC,Interesting as in please god let this kid make it to a second contract!  No QB the Bucs have drafted has ever signed a second contract with the Bucs. Fucking. Ever. I really hope Jameis is the first.
buccaneers,34oysl,Devils_-_Advocate,2,Sun May 3 13:57:40 2015 UTC,"yes that is what i mean...by the time we are nearing that 2nd contract, things will be interesting (and hopefully in a good way!)"
buccaneers,34oysl,Qbert_Spuckler,2,Sun May 3 16:33:16 2015 UTC,He hasnt played a down yet so we dont exactly know if thats too much money or too little.
buccaneers,34oysl,BucJason,0,Sun May 3 16:42:08 2015 UTC,"With how much cap we have, hopefully we front loaded his contact."
buccaneers,34oysl,Lazarous86,3,Sun May 3 13:20:06 2015 UTC,It doesn't work that way. It's a rookie contract.
buccaneers,34oysl,GooieGui,4,Sun May 3 14:02:48 2015 UTC,Rookie contracts have pre-set yearly values. We don't get to choose how the money is allocated per year.  Not that it matters. We're fine with the cap for the foreseeable future unless the Bucs go full retard in free agency again (which I don't see happening). They have more than enough money to re-sign Lavonte David and other young players who pan out.
buccaneers,34oo3l,Znomon,7,Sun May 3 02:58:07 2015 UTC,I actually wonder if there are any other professional sports voices that are also the voice of a college team. Or just Gene?

I'm a Bucs fan and a Gator fan, so I only knew him as the voice of the Bucs, I didn't know he also voiced the Noles. After the game I wanted to go to courtside and when I saw him I was like ""Gene? What are you doing here? And how did you get courtside seats?"" He replied, ""I'm the voice of the Seminoles,"" and laughed. I replied with ""No! Say it ain't so, Gene!"" And told him about my Gator allegiance. We had a good chat for a few minutes. He ended up signing my ticket."

If his name is cleared in this investigation, he can name the team he goes to and demand more money than if he was drafted. Assuming the murder thing is not an issue, I hope he looks our way. That would really cement our OL."
buccaneers,34o5ly,osubeavs721,2,Sun May 3 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"To be honest, he'll probably look to go to New Orleans (from Baton Rouge and played at LSU) but the prospect of having a chance to start could be the decisive factor in whether or not he wants to sign with us. I mean, he can play G/T and would definitely be a great player to start at G if Marpet isn't ready straight up.  Nonetheless, he would be our 6th OL and could be plugged in as soon as we inevitably get an injury on the OL (not wishing for one, but it'd be a rare occurrence when a team has 5 OLs play 16 games each)"
buccaneers,34o5ly,ssdestroyer,1 point,Sun May 3 04:35:35 2015 UTC,No he will start at left tackle and Donovan smith with be our 6th oline and eventually replace mankins at guard

buccaneers,34ncvh,OptimusPrimeTime21,7,Sat May 2 19:37:54 2015 UTC,It is because he was not prototypical size and he played for Nebraska with some god awful QBs so he didn't get to put up stats like a beast. He could be a very solid complement to Evans.
