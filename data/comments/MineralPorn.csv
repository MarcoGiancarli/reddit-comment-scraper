The different colors are strongly defined and range from the best pink to the best green with a very unusual yellow-green termination at the top. The crystal is also, for the most part, gemmy, is very nicely striated, and has an excellent luster. This scepter was found in ""The Rocket Pocket"" in the Pederneira Mine in 2001. This specimen was on the cover of the Spanish mineralogical magazine ""Mineral Up"" 2013/1, and is also featured in the ""Mineral Up"" calendar June 2014.

Most minerals have certain aspects that are more appealing to people and denote better quality, which increase the price. Also, the bigger the better, generally. You can get perfect crystals that are millimeters big, but if you found that same quality crystal but 3 inches big, then $$$! All that said, I couldn't give you an exact price on this specimen, in part because of the variability in mineral pricing, which I discuss in our wiki page...but this is a nice piece."

MineralPorn,3ddks5,One_Lurker,37,Wed Jul 15 14:24:07 2015 UTC,"A tree long ago dies, falls over, gets buried (usually rapidly), mineral rich water flows through the wood, minerals fill the pore spaces within the wood and precipitate out until the space is filled, many years later humans dig them up.  A longer and more complicated but similar process involves mineral rich waters flowing through and replacing the tree itself molecule by molecule.  In both cases structure is almost always preserved.  The first process is called permineralization, the second is replacement both are commonly required for any petrified sample."

My uncle owned a machine shop way back in the day, and did some repairs on this guys car but he couldn't afford to pay him as he had no money. He gave my uncle 5 pieces of this jade that was taken from a deposit somewhere in British Columbia, in the 70's.   The other four pieces are somewhere in the world right now, but my uncle told me he saved one for me (how could he have known I would be around is beyond me) and gifted it to me. I've been through some rough times during my short stint here on Earth, but I've had my mom hold onto it for me during those times so I didn't get rid of it to the highest bidder.. Like I did most of my things..   Anyways, it's one of my favorite pieces. I find that when you're gifted a mineral, it means some one has been thinking about you specifically- be it purchased or come across. It's (in my opinion) a good feeling on all fronts, plus the quality of this jade is.. Well, if you're on this subreddit you should know, it's quite nice."

When I look at your stone, I see fantastic color (I can't say for sure but I would call it imperial (best color) or kingfisher (the second best color).

MineralPorn,3aap75,canoxen,12,Thu Jun 18 21:57:27 2015 UTC,"malachite is Cu2CO3(OH)2. it decomposes with heat giving out co2 gas forming copper oxide, which reacts to the carbon in the charcoal, the carbon steels the oxygen from the copper oxide forming carbon dioxide leaving behind copper."

MineralPorn,3aap75,canoxen,22,Thu Jun 18 22:24:58 2015 UTC,"Will I get brain cancer if I do this at home without a respirator?   Use a respirator.  Most copper deposits contain traces of arsenic.  Hephaestus, God of the forge, was lame, because early metal workers were.  Copper age and Bronze age metalworkers are identifiable to archaeologists because they have arsenic in their skeletons.  In fact, the ""copper"" tools of the Copper Age were actually (unintentionally) hardened by arsenic into a crude bronze. Smelting malachite once is probably harmless, lapidary grade probably much purer than average material used as ore.  Also, gem cutters get sick from working malachite (I do a bit of hobby gemcutting).  The cutting process puts traces of copper carbonate into the air, which the lungs absorb.  Copper is a trace nutrient, but inhaling a big dose is bad.  Many welders have died from inhaling zinc vapors, another trace nutrient.  ebay is a pretty good source of cutting rough  edit- I can't find a geological reference for arsenic in carbonate ores, apparently it is more associated with sulfides of copper.  Still, arsenic and copper are concentrated by similar geological processes, where one is the other isn't far."

It looks like an interesting book, and probably has some tips on backyard smelting.  GuyDean mentions the formation of red copper oxide at one point, you would want the ore to be in an oxygen poor environment to prevent the copper from oxidizing at that high temperature.  Keep it near the charcoal, that can even pull oxygen out of metal oxides."

MineralPorn,3aap75,autowikibot,4,Fri Jun 19 03:37:59 2015 UTC,"i think you can get about 58% CU from it. It's a pretty standard way the industry gets copper from malachite. Nothing too harmful comes from this process. Though Copper carbonate can irritate the skin, IS an eye irritant, not likely poisonous, likely to cause only nausea and vomiting.    if you happen to ingest a lot then nausea, vomiting and a metallic taste followed by abdominal  pain and diarrhea may be expected. Secretions may be  blue/green. So wear eye protection.  You wont make nearly that much from this on such a small piece. and it only stays copper carbonate for a short while since you are just causing it form copper and co2. The black stuff that forms on the piece while you heat it is the CuCO3."

If I were to acquire a bunch of random pieces of malachite, I could theoretically melt it all down and 'distill' out my own little blob of copper?

MineralPorn,3aap75,canoxen,2,Thu Jun 18 23:07:51 2015 UTC,it's a neat project. but I'd look into the worth. some people buy malachite for more then what the copper is worth. Copper is about $2.61/lb right now.  Update: Just checked ebay. Price per pound of malachite is much higher then copper :) but not as much fun me thinks ;)

MineralPorn,3aap75,canoxen,2,Fri Jun 19 01:21:08 2015 UTC,If it's pure malachite then this can help. molar mass Cu2CO3(OH)2 = [ Cu2( 2 x 63.546) + C 12.011 +  O3( 3 x 15.999) +  OH2 ( 15.999 + 1.008)] =  221.1 g/mol molar mass Cu = 63.546 g/mol  % Cu = 2 x 63.546 x 100 / 221.1 = 57.5

MineralPorn,399b0h,pirateo40,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:27:43 2015 UTC,Not sure you meant what the above says.  A filter is absolutely required for viewing fluorescence.  Without it the visible bluish light from the 254nm germicidal lamp overwhelms the fluorescence and you can barely see it.
MineralPorn,399b0h,jmancuso321,2,Sat Jun 13 03:11:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, I meant it. The OP asked about ""germicidal uv lights"".  My reply to him specifically states ""germicidal uv lights"". The  germicidal uv lights are not meant for.viewing specimens. They are meant to kill germs. That is why they do not have a filter nor do they need a filter to do their function. Just a case of misunderstanding or.miscommunication. It is good you made sure he understands that the filter is absolutely required for viewing fluorescence.

Germicidal UV lights are used  in conjunction with a filter to view fluorescence.  Germ UV = 254nm = shortwave.  Just mineral lights need the filter.  There are sellers on Ebay (from China) who try to sell unfiltered lights for mineral fluorescence.  Terrible practice, but they discovered that certain minerals (very few, willemite for example) can be viewed under an unfiltered light, but the colors are so washed out - it's a terrible disservice to the hobby.    That's why I am so insistent on filtered UV."

As a filter ages it becomes solarized from the exposure to SW UV (254nm) and passes less UV.  Visible is not affected.  Tanning lamps are MW bulbs, mostly around 312nm - not SW.

If you're lucky that side of the glass is on the outside and the fluorescence wouldn't be too bad.  Better to use Lexan clear, or OP3 plexiglass - made just for this purpose.  UV, although invisible, is just like light.  It reflects off things and can be redirected into your eyes.  Permanent displays should have a front cover protecting the viewer."

MineralPorn,38ob9t,MajorMajorObvious,2,Sat Jun 6 04:26:44 2015 UTC,So UV causes it to change color?  Does it change back in time?
MineralPorn,38ob9t,SarahC,3,Sat Jun 6 04:39:46 2015 UTC,"Yes - even the sun will cause it to change color (that's what the middle pic shows, after exposure to sunlight).  Shortwave UV makes it turn the deep purple you see.  It takes only a few seconds to darken like that.  If exposed to a bright UV free light (halogen for example) it will fade back to the original color in seconds.  The rusty orange in the big pic is fluorescence - the rock glows under UV light..."
MineralPorn,38ob9t,SarahC,3,Sat Jun 6 05:09:53 2015 UTC,"BTW - the sun puts out all kinds of UV, but only longwave (LW) makes it to the earth (maybe a little midwave too, UVB - but not much).  Shortwave UV (UVC) is blocked by the ozone layer, thus allowing us humanoids to exist (along with every other living thing on land)."

MineralPorn,38l0ca,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:55:04 2015 UTC,"Labrador:       Labrador is the distinct northerly region of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It comprises the mainland portion of the province, separated from the island of Newfoundland by the Strait of Belle Isle. It is the largest and northernmost geographical region in Atlantic Canada.  Labrador occupies the eastern part of the Labrador Peninsula. It is bordered to the west and the south by the Canadian province of Quebec. Labrador also shares a small land border with the Canadian territory of Nunavut on Killiniq Island.  Though Labrador's area is over twice that of the island of Newfoundland, it has only 9% of the province's population. The aboriginal peoples of Labrador include the Northern Inuit of Nunatsiavut, the Southern Inuit-Métis of Nunatukavut (NunatuKavut), and the Innu. The non-aboriginal population in Labrador did not permanently settle in Labrador until the natural resource developments of the 1940s and 1950s. Before the 1950s, very few non-aboriginal people lived in Labrador year round. The few European immigrants who worked seasonally for foreign merchants and brought their families were known as Settlers.

MineralPorn,37bqxw,chris_cobra,1 point,Tue May 26 13:34:41 2015 UTC,Do you have any idea why schorl is more brittle than the other tourmaline group minerals? I've been rockhounding in northern New York and Maine and the schorl and Ca-dravite I've found there is just crumbly and brittle. You'd find large chunks just crumbling away into tiny pieces. Rather disappointing :\
MineralPorn,37bqxw,mineralexpert,1 point,Tue May 26 22:25:08 2015 UTC,"1) schorl is not a variety name but valid IMA mineral name  2) it is brittle because it crystallizes early in the pegmatite rock evolution and often gets damaged by tectonics, fluids and alterations in later phase of pegmatite crystallization - unaltered schorl is extremely hard and resistant"
MineralPorn,37bqxw,chris_cobra,2,Wed May 27 13:48:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not a variety name, but everyone here on reddit is used to the term and concept of tourmaline like it's a mineral itself. Thinking of it like that, schorl is a variety. It's like when I describe any specific mineral as a variety of the larger classification called ""mineral"" to people who are true mineral newbs. I discussed this naming convention issue in one of my earlier tourmaline posts. I have to explain why I'm doing it this way because this is how I'm going to keep doing it, for simplicity's sake, even though it's not correct.   Thank you for the information on schorl's formation!

MineralPorn,36slx5,mopeygoff,13,Thu May 21 20:12:16 2015 UTC,I second this reply. Celestite is safe to wear and hold but not safe to ingest.
MineralPorn,36slx5,chrissiibear,11,Thu May 21 20:23:09 2015 UTC,Most minerals are safe to touch. The big problem for some is inhalation and injestion. That should be everyone's general guiding principle for safety.
MineralPorn,36slx5,ISUanthony,5,Thu May 21 21:47:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like I should really make note that if you touch a mineral, and it rubs off onto your hands, then you don't wash your hands, then you eat with your hands, bite your fingernails, or somehow put your hands in your mouth, you'll ingest some of the mineral that is on your hands, but it probably wouldn't be enough to be highly toxic.

MineralPorn,36jy09,Mr-Yellow,2,Wed May 20 05:50:08 2015 UTC,I think u/kutNpaste is referring to those three spots of dark blue which are very distinct from the other colors in the stone.
MineralPorn,36jy09,kutNpaste,2,Wed May 20 08:56:50 2015 UTC,That is the blue from the Opal. It looks weird when taken with an iPhone.
MineralPorn,36jy09,ImDougAllen,2,Wed May 20 18:41:06 2015 UTC,"The colour isn't reflected but refracted. Like the wings of a butterfly which aren't pigment colour but refract light like a prism with their micro structure, splitting it and only returning  specific frequencies.  So what you're seeing is pure blue frequency, like a laser, split from the white light hitting the Opal.  Those flakes are also very close to the surface and where they've been polished through is the highest blue colour.  Camera probably has a bit of a hotspot for this specific frequency, lots of consumer cameras add more of certain colours to make the images appear ""dynamic"" and get a ""wow"". Classic is Sony consumer cameras take very red photos."

MineralPorn,36dx01,xamphear,43,Mon May 18 17:48:33 2015 UTC,It's a rare sample of Dongomite.  Also known as Penisoleum in the UK and Wangamene in Australia.
MineralPorn,36dx01,LusciousVagDisaster,16,Mon May 18 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"Quite, sir. Do you believe that we could further classify this as a chodestone? I think that the size and shape give us very telling clues that this is not quite the average dongomite. Chodestones are typically found to have less total length. The lumping in the left 1/2 of the sample is quite odd, though. You don't typically see such growths on a dongomite.  I wonder if the geologist who found this took a scratch test. I am quite curious as to where this (possible) chodestone will fall in the hardness scale. It looks fairly soft, to me."
MineralPorn,36dx01,LusciousVagDisaster,8,Mon May 18 19:25:06 2015 UTC,Good eye!  The hardness rating would certainly confirm whether this is truly a chodestone or if it is merely a rather odd-shaped sample of dongomite.

MineralPorn,366qnj,ISUanthony,4,Sat May 16 18:20:02 2015 UTC,"Locality: Pomorzany Mine, Olkusz, Olkusz District, Małopolskie, Poland  Dimensions: 11.4 x 5.5 x 0.8 cm (about 4.5 inches wide)  Schalenblende consists of alternating bands of Sphalerite (brown and yellow stripes), Galena (mirror-finish grey parts), and Marcasite (layer near the top that sparkles like sand). It's often said that Wurtzite is a part of Polish Schalenblende but could not be detected by XRD analysis of another person's specimen, so perhaps there is some confusion. The color variation of the Sphalerite is due to grain size and iron content.  This slice is cut and polished. The gif and bright light really washes out the color and makes everything lighter-colored, but it does show off the specimen better."

MineralPorn,35m3d6,greekplaya990,14,Mon May 11 21:53:56 2015 UTC,"No kidding! Before we understood science and how things work, I would definitely understand believing that the minerals we see in this subreddit could have special powers. I like learning about ancient beliefs that different people used to have about stones (not the BS that is made up nowadays). Here are some ancient beliefs about opal broken down by populations:  Arabic people:  Arabs believed that Opals fell from the heavens in flashes of lightning, which is what gave them their fiery colors.  Australian Aborigines:  The Australian Aborigines have understood the opal’s unique energy and beauty since the Dreaming times. They bestowed the name of ‘Rainbow Serpent’ upon this remarkable gem and described its creation: “The Creator took the colors of the rainbow, and put them into stone to make opal”. Another story tells of the Creator traveling via a rainbow road to spread a message of peace on earth. With each step, the stones underfoot turned into tiny, tangible rainbows or Opals.  Greeks:  Zeus, the Greek king of the gods, was so happy when he defeated the Titans that he wept tears that turned into opals upon hitting the ground.  The Ancient Greeks believed that Opala conferred the gifts of foresight and prophecy while assisting the wearer to lessen their inhibitions and reveal true feelings.  Romans:  Ancient Romans would seek out Opals more then any other gemstone due to the belief that they would bring great fortune.  Indians:  Also the Indian Goddess of the Rainbow was reportedly so beautiful that many male gods sought her favor. Eventually, as a desperate act of escape from their advances, she turned herself into the rainbow-colored opal.  Various?:  Throughout the Middle Ages (5th – 14th centuries) Opal was known as ‘ophthalmios’, meaning the eye stone which was due to a widespread belief that it was beneficial to the eyes. Blond women also wore opal necklaces around this time to protect their hair from losing its color.  However there was a period in history during the late 18th and 19th centuries that Opal fell out of favor, as it became associated with pestilence, famine and the fall of monarchies. While Europe was plagued with Black Death, it was rumored that an opal worn by a patient was aflame with color right up to the point of death, and then lost its brilliance after the wearer died.

MineralPorn,35m3d6,PuzzleDuster,1 point,Tue May 12 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"Here's a description of Ogilvie's crystal mine, which supplied much of the eye-glass quality crystal back in the day.   A very interesting occurrence of this mineral (calcite) may be seen in a large vugh in the Garibaldi Mine (Lionsville). It was interesected obliquely at one end by a tunnel... As exposed, its largest dimensions are 70 ft. by 16 ft. and 9 ft. high. It is lined with crystals of calcite of all sizes up to 2 ft. or more in diameter, some are cloudy, but most are transparent of light sherry colour, or colourless, and fine examples may be obtained of the variety which shows double refraction clearly and is known as Iceland Spar. Further exploration might show that the cavern extends beyond its known limits, but nothing has been done to enlarge it, and it remains as when first discovered. Though many of the crystals have been broken and removed, there yet remain so many intact that the damage is hardly noticeable...... Liquid inclusions from small to large bubbles as much as 2 inches long were seen containing possibly a desert-spoon full of the liquid..... upon some of the large crystals, short stout, hexagonal prisms of secondary calcite have been deposited. As single crystals and groups they are attached to the polished surfaces of the large crystals, and a very slight jar will detach them from their smooth base.   http://www.mineral.org.au/news/garibaldi.html  Underground yeah, but just around the corner you have this....  http://s1021.photobucket.com/user/yowie05/media/Lionsville/DSCF2898.jpg.html  That used to be filled with quartz+gold."

Lead can't be absorbed by the skin, but you might eat with your hands eventually and get some of that residue in your mouth. Also, if it ever created its own dust, you should be careful of inhaling that. However, galena may not be readily soluble in your body if you did ingest some, so maybe it isn't dangerous at all.

MineralPorn,353fun,ISUanthony,3,Wed May 6 20:00:37 2015 UTC,"gelled a second flash for the yellow background.    I don't really understand that, but my gut says that I don't like the yellow color. With the specimen being perpendicular to the camera, the yellow looks like it was added in with MS Paint with the fill-in bucket tool.  Also, the cool cubic part of the fluorite looks out of focus, or maybe just pixelated for some reason. Maybe the cubism is messing with my perception though and tricking me into thinking that part of the image is messed up or ""JPEGed"".  I know how hard it is to get perfect focus on a small area though, and I love it when people post their own images!"

Cities and wars of article  History of salt:       Salt has played a prominent role in determining the power and location of the world's great cities. Liverpool rose from just a small English port to become the prime exporting port for the salt dug in the great Cheshire salt mines and thus became the entrepôt for much of the world's salt in the 19th century.   Salt created and destroyed empires. The salt mines of Poland led to a vast kingdom in the 16th century, only to be destroyed when Germans brought in sea salt (which most of the world considered superior to rock salt). Venice fought and won a war with Genoa over salt. However, Genoese Christopher Columbus and Giovanni Caboto would later destroy the Mediterranean trade by introducing the New World to the market.   Cities, states and duchies along the salt roads exacted heavy duties and taxes for the salt passing through their territories. This practice even caused the formation of cities, such as the city of Munich in 1158, when the then Duke of Bavaria, Henry the Lion, decided that the bishops of Freising no longer needed their salt revenue.

MineralPorn,33lhpb,CarolinaCrystals,2,Thu Apr 23 19:38:43 2015 UTC,"About the high prices of minerals today... A lot collectors are buying high-end minerals as pieces of art, and all the overpricing follows. Because of this, people also view high-end minerals as investments, so the prices are crazy like beanie babies and other ""investment"" collectibles, but there is some potential for investment because those minerals may be in limited supply in that form or in the future. A lot of collectors think that there will be a mineral market crash making those expensive minerals much more affordable. There are still plenty of awesome pieces of minerals for $1-$100, but you don't see those posted here unless it's from one of our own collections.  If you want some tourmaline, we only show the nicest ""porn"" worthy here most of the time. I said before, you can get black tourmaline, called schorl, for relatively nothing. Also, you can get non-""gemmy"", as in ""gem-quality"", tourmaline for very cheap too in many colors. These cheap pieces will be more opaque, like schorl. I don't really like that term ""gemmy"". It adds too much value to a specimen, but those gemmy pieces do look nicer...so I understand it."
MineralPorn,33lhpb,ISUanthony,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"Can you say more about the opinion that there may be a market crash?  To my knowledge, the price of a world-class mineral decreases only when superseded by new discoveries, and when damaged.  Barring these occurrences, I fail to see how the price of a single species could drop, much less an entire market.  Unless the world's billionaires are simultaneously divested of their resources, buyers will always be in ever-increasing competition, driving prices higher."
MineralPorn,33lhpb,dontgogreen,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:45:03 2015 UTC,"ever-increasing competition, driving prices higher   Nothing can increase in price forever, and when people think like that, it usually means the price bubble is going to pop soon.  The prices for ""high-end"" minerals have increased so much so quickly caused by a relatively small amount of rich people. A lot of this is due to investing or speculating in minerals, especially after the 2008 meltdown. After 2008, people have branched out to look for more unique investment opportunities. For example, one website selling opal states, right now, ""Many Black Opals sold...have increased in value between 20 and 30% per year..."" If true at all (probably isn't), that type of hype and increase in price is a classic sign of a price bubble, which eventually leads to the bubble popping. A lot of minerals have been sold with the description that the natural supply has dried up and there will be no more, but they are described this way for decades... So you know that's part of the hype.  A lot of newly rich Chinese people are driving the prices up too. If many of these rich buyers stop paying top-dollar for minerals, the market will collapse. It's basically guaranteed that there will be another financial downturn sometime, and collectibles like minerals will feel the effects of that.  A big part of the high prices is due to the high-priced retailers. Just like at high-end antique stores, those products aren't worth that much. If you tried to sell it yourself, you'd never get that price. You're basically paying for the service of buying from a fancy middle-man. Some of the high-priced sellers will be selling at a mineral show, take a walk around to buy some specimens from other sellers, then turn around and mark up the price and actually sell the same pieces for much more. A lot of their customers are buying for stupid reasons because they didn't have the sense to not pay those prices. They're buying for a status symbol, misguided investment, or because they truly believe it's worth that much based on the fancy retailer. It's not based on rationality, so if these buyers wise up or dry up, the market will feel the pain.  I think all collector markets have expensive stuff that is labeled as an investment opportunity, and that stuff is usually over-hyped and over-priced because of that frenzy. Collectibles almost never beat the stock market as an investment.  One little interesting thing about investing in natural products like minerals or precious metals, there is always an increasing supply because as the price goes up, it becomes worth it to pay higher prices to go out and mine/find more.  What this means to you... Don't buy the hype of the super-high priced mineral market. I haven't payed more than $100 for anything in my collection, in any of my different types of collections... Like I said, there is amazing stuff well under $100, some of which is still overpriced if you're a savvy consumer. Of course some stuff deserves its high price tag, but you'll be more likely to run into the over-hyped and over-priced stuff in the really high price range, especially if you're looking at $1,000+ price tags.  I'm not the Warren Buffet of minerals or anything, but all the warning signs are there if you recognize the familiar pattern of price bubbles."
MineralPorn,33lhpb,ISUanthony,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:22:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment. I've heard it said by certain mineral dealers that the two best routes are the low end, where you get it for so cheap you can't help but make a profit, and the high end, where the mineral is so good that it can't help but increase in value.  Anything in the middle is no man's land, which sounds like what you're talking about with the privilege of buying from fancy middlemen."
MineralPorn,33lhpb,dontgogreen,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:40:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not agreeing with that advice. A piece that cost you $3 might be worth $3 forever, even though inflation made old $3 worth the future $10, so the piece actually lost value. That has happened when people look at the old price tags on their specimens, probably due to the increased availability of that mineral now, like we're talking about in this thread.  And as I stated my last comment, nothing can increase in price forever (you know, on top of regular inflation). The fancy middle-men sell some of the highest - end stuff, but they also sell middle priced stuff, relatively speaking.  The moral of the story is don't invest in minerals to make money, just buy what you like, and it might go up or down in value. But do realize that some stuff is overpriced for all the reasons I mentioned. But don't wait until you're 80 years old to buy stuff thinking that you'll always be able to buy stuff for the same price, because the prices on some stuff does increase, but not as much as the stock market over time, historically."

MineralPorn,33lhpb,RockBlock,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:09:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all the quartz-based gemstones, like agate, chalcedony, amethyst, rock crystal, etc. are a lot more easily obtainable (and identifiable) in modern times. Hell, we can artificially grow perfect crystals of quartz now, same with other gemstones as well such as corrundums. Natural topaz and fluorite also appear to be somewhat more abundant but I'm not totally sure about that.   ...But then again just from our human ability to mine, learn geology, and other advances all minerals/gemstones are leaps and bounds more easy to obtain and relatively cheaper in this day and age.  As for price, like everything it's a combination of rarity and supply and desire. (desire rather than demand as it's about how much people are willing to pay rather than how many are willing to pay.) If there are many people that desperately want something, they can be gouged in pricing. If only a rare few people want something then it can become a pricey niche product. The social perceptions attached to minerals will have a high effect on the price here. ""Oh, that's just amethyst"" and ""OMG a diamond!"" are the sort social constructed values we apply to gemstones that have a strong control over what we're willing to pay. Price is a construct of people so people are the primary control for price.  Amethyst is an uncommon mineral and is high in supply due to being actively mined for gift-shop specimens. It is however not high in desire because it is a) easy to obtain b) it is not that practical for some jewelry ie. rings due to scratchability and c) there are more rare and more ""sparkly"" minerals out there.  Diamonds are expensive because they are a) rare [countering the misleading ""diamonds are common"" myth. They're abundant in their deposits but those deposits are not widespread] and are hard to obtain due to artificially restricted supply and monopolies. The desire for diamonds is EXTREMELY high due to the jewelry/wedding industry and the fact that they are one of the best stones for jewelry due to having both very high durability and optical effects, which adds to desire from a practical standpoint.  Minerals like Tourmaline, or others more rarely seen, are usually expensive because they are simply very low in obtained supply, even if they are not rare minerals in the ground. Finding gem or display quality crystals is very difficult for many mineral species and this will of course drive up the price. As there's no lower for them as cut stone people just don't actively mine them en mass, which makes them niche lunxury goods particularly for display specimens."

MineralPorn,333hj5,TheRedditRockhound,-4,Thu May 14 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"this is lab made, they drop liquid bismuth into water and it creates this crystal structure. Very cool!"

MineralPorn,333hj5,TheRedditRockhound,3,Tue Apr 21 18:25:03 2015 UTC,If you let it cool slowly would larger crystals form?
MineralPorn,333hj5,ISUanthony,2,Tue Apr 21 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"That's correct, same way with nature."
MineralPorn,333hj5,TheRedditRockhound,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:02:40 2015 UTC,Wow. I've never heard of that. How would that even happen? Do you know of a video of this happening?
MineralPorn,333hj5,garbonzobean,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:45:14 2015 UTC,I am not 100% sure why but I know it has to do with the expansion of bismuth as it cools.
MineralPorn,333hj5,TheRedditRockhound,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:01:16 2015 UTC,Larger crystals form when they're cooled slower because they have a longer time to use the liquid mineral around them. If it is cooled very quickly then very small crystals are formed due to less time for the same process.

MineralPorn,32a6ws,nlos,3,Sun Apr 12 12:52:25 2015 UTC,"It's the brassy colored stuff. I think the silver-colored part is pyrite going through pyrite rot, where it disintegrates into a white powder. I could be wrong about that though."

MineralPorn,320rbt,PVKT,3,Thu Apr 9 17:33:02 2015 UTC,"My first thought is that I don't know a lot about the preparation of minerals in that way. My second thought is that agate is quartz, so any acid or whatever that you could use to dissolve quartz could also dissolve the agate, so you may be stuck with the quartz. If you really wanted to, you'd have to manually scrape or grind away the quartz.  Post some pictures!"
MineralPorn,320rbt,ISUanthony,2,Thu Apr 9 18:01:24 2015 UTC,There's a really nice table explaining that agate is quartz almost halfway down Quartz's Wikipedia page.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz
MineralPorn,320rbt,ISUanthony,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"Quartz:       Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in the Earth's continental crust, after feldspar. It is made up of a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon–oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall formula SiO2.  There are many different varieties of quartz, several of which are semi-precious gemstones. Especially in Europe and the Middle East, varieties of quartz have been since antiquity the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and hardstone carvings.

MineralPorn,31bm97,ISUanthony,3,Fri Apr 3 16:13:59 2015 UTC,"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/745924417/illumigems  From the creator of the fake minerals guide that was my model for our Fake Educational Albums.  These have real ground-up Celestite mixed in and makes this a long-lifetime rechargeable glowstick crystal, basically. You can get one for only $5 total (if in US). They're available in blue and/or green.  ""Celestite is a beautiful blue mineral that is found all over the world......Celestite does not react to UV light, however, if it is heated, celestite loses its color and turns powdery and white, but it gains a strong UV reaction. When this heated celestite powder is refined and excited by Europium, it gains super long lasting glowing power, which is the core of Illumigems long lasting glowing. This powder is mixed into our non-toxic plant resin and used to produce our Illumigems!""  I thought this would be something that people would be interested in. It's made with real minerals and could be a first step in collecting fluorescent minerals, even though this sounds more like phosphorescence. I think I'm going to get the $10 package. I don't have any experience with these, but they sound cool and worth a little investment. Plus these ship in only a couple of months, which is the shortest Kickstarter I've ever participated in by far!"

MineralPorn,31a4ld,pirateo40,3,Fri Apr 3 14:24:09 2015 UTC,Fluorite is normally very fluorescent under longwave (LW) - the type of UV from a flashlight or a blacklight bulb.  You should be able to easily obtain one of those in Europe.  We have many European fluorescent collectors in the Fluorescent Mineral Group on FB - join us for more discussion.

Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to natural history (sometimes faked), geology, ethnography, archaeology, religious or historical relics, works of art (including cabinet paintings), and antiquities. ""The Kunstkammer was regarded as a microcosm or theater of the world, and a memory theater. The Kunstkammer conveyed symbolically the patron's control of the world through its indoor, microscopic reproduction.""  Of Charles I of England's collection, Peter Thomas states succinctly, ""The Kunstkabinett itself was a form of propaganda""  Besides the most famous, best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of science in Europe formed collections that were precursors to museums.

MineralPorn,2zh7f8,Zidanet,29,Wed Mar 18 17:07:53 2015 UTC,"Haha positive, I tried to eat one when they got in. The resulting crown can testify to the fact they they are indeed a 7 or so on the Mohs. They are really cool, the purple ones and the ones with the brain textures are the coolest.   I know these aren't fake however they are likely oiled, forgot to mention in the title."
MineralPorn,2zh7f8,batubatu,16,Wed Mar 18 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"Oiled?  I'm obviously not a .. uh..  gemologist? so I'm not sure what ""oiled"" actually means."
MineralPorn,2zh7f8,batubatu,17,Wed Mar 18 20:51:01 2015 UTC,"Sometimes people will apply different types of natural oils or lubricants to stones, a common one is food grade silicone lubricant. It increases the stones translucency as it fills in small cracks and scratches. The same effect can be gained by wetting the stone with water first, oils just maintain the effect longer. All you have to do to remove it is a bath of warm water and Dawn generally."
MineralPorn,2zh7f8,ISUanthony,11,Wed Mar 18 21:47:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, so it's literally oiled.  I thought it might be a technical term.  Thanks for the helpful answer :)"

He snagged these from Tuscon. So I'll be able to get back to you with some in situ pics hopefully later tonight =)  No need to be mean man, I honestly don't care if you believe me or not. It's not like I'm trying to sell them to anyone haha.

MineralPorn,2zh7f8,Brobi_WanKenobi,2,Thu Mar 19 02:45:35 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your concern but these didn't come from a metaphysical dealer or ebay. They came from a old school rockhound dealer I've known for several years, among the other dealers I know he's the only one who can get these(he's also got a degree in geology). But he does too much high quality business to try to make some small money at the expense of his good name. He still has some of these among other epic stuff. His names Rusty James of Throwin' Stones Crystals Minerals and Gemstones. You can find both on Facebook.  I'll try to get back with those in situ photos asap =)"

I'm not being critical of you or the dealer who sold you the stones, just bringing up my doubt that they are natural. I have an open mind about these agates.    The Gobi Desert has held many secrets for millenia..."
MineralPorn,2zh7f8,theesotericrutabaga,3,Thu Mar 19 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"He actually has a bunch on his Ebay store here...http://stores.ebay.com/throwinstones?_dmd=1&_nkw=Gobi  The link is on his website as well =)  Haha yea it has, supposedly the people who collect these keep the exact locations secret. Which would make sense, but is certainly a red flag as well. Like I said I thought they were fake too until I got my hands on one under magnification. I mean I know its agate and I can't find evidence of any tool marks or polishing. You can see the banding in those pictures I posted right?"
MineralPorn,2zh7f8,tachyonflux,3,Thu Mar 19 15:18:33 2015 UTC,"I can see some banding and at least these agates are small. If they were industrial, I would expect larger stones!"

Also, among the 7-8 crystalline structures available for galena - the one pictured is not one of them. I am certain it is bismuth, which is silly because they aren't even listed as similar minerals to each other. The X-ray diffractions are completely different, as are the chemical make-ups of each.

But since this wasn't posted here before, I'm being a little more lenient and giving you the time of day to give you a proper response because obviously, you need it.  If you want to bring up the vast majority, then fine, let's discuss this. Yes, a lot of people post for karma in subs, but the vast majority don't constantly post the same picture or link to a million subreddits every single day. Anyone who takes a peek at your posting history immediately knows you're a notorious reposter, and you should take into account the fact that people are calling you out on it on multiple different subs and want you to go away.  Posting for community is very different than posting karma, and it's sad that I even have to explain this to you. For a sub like this, it's about generating discussions, learning new things, taking part in polls and contests, reading the educational albums from the sidebar, things like that. If people wanted karma, they would go on a subreddit with larger numbers, not here.  I'm loving the personal message you sent me, and this is me mitigating the trolls on this sub, aka you. I have a biased attitude because I think this sub is great and those who participate are being genuine, not just seeking to increase a karma count that doesn't even have any use or value. Smdh."
MineralPorn,2z8rpo,littlebabyburrito,8,Mon Mar 16 19:52:23 2015 UTC,"Regarding cross posting. Pretty much everyone knows and agrees excessive reposting is frowned upon on Reddit. Quoting reddiquette is unnecessary, since I already said this wasn't a repost on this sub so I'm allowing it.   however it was hindered by your lack of proper mitigating the troll-circlejerk in the thread, and look where it's at now. That was not on me friend, that was entirely on you.   Surprising how quickly you backtracked from your cute little message to me saying I wasn't the only one on the mod team.   Stop acting as if I have control over who downvotes you. I'm just expressing my opinions and if I were acting on them, this post would have already been taken down."

MineralPorn,2z44mz,Inc88,3,Sun Mar 15 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"preparation.paleo.amnh.org/56/pyrite-disease (pretty good website, and even has a small picture)  It is extremely common. Personally, I don't want to buy something with Pyrite on it anymore because I'm picky. Chalcopyrite, and to a lesser degree, Sphalerite can give the same look to a piece that little Pyrite crystals would provide, with no nasty Pyrite rot. A lot of specimens have neat little Pyrite crystals on it, but I'd prefer for those to be Chalcopyrite or Sphalerite due to Pyrite rot. The big Pyrite cubes like these are supposed to be stable, and luckily those big cubes are the coolest form of Pyrite, so I'd only buy those, but still be careful with them. The link above says you should keep your Pyrite under 45% humidity. You should keep books below 50% humidity for preservation, so that level of humidity seems to be a magic level."
MineralPorn,2z44mz,ISUanthony,1 point,Sun Mar 15 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"Also, here is a link to a mindat.org message board with some potential treatments/prevention for this disease. Look at Reiner Mielke's post:  http://www.mindat.org/forum.php?read,19,149266,page=2  There is a lot of discussion on the topic. They state that this rot can also affect Pyrrhotite because it often contains Pyrite and Marcasite. They also make the situation sound worse than I do, saying that once the rot starts, you basically need to throw the piece away and that there is no safe level of humidity."

MineralPorn,2yepye,thethreadkiller,4,Mon Mar 9 04:07:24 2015 UTC,"The pricing of a mineral can vary widely depending on many factors, and those factors can vary from mineral to mineral. Clarity, the presence of perfect terminations, the locale, the rarity, size, whether or not there is anything unusual about the formation of the mineral, whether or not it is facet grade, whether or not it occurs along with other valuable minerals, whether or not the specimen is still in the matrix (host rock), etc. It's impossible to give the value of a piece unless you're familiar with the market and know the exact size, weight, and locale at the very least. My impression of this subreddit is that cost/pricing isn't something that's really discussed here, it's moreso about the appreciation of beautiful and unusual mineral formations."
MineralPorn,2yepye,Iamnotyour_mother,3,Mon Mar 9 05:02:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the perfect comment. I can throw in a few things though. Mineral prices are 100% based on supply and demand. So on top of what Iamnotyour_mother said, some other things can affect price. If a mineral that is only mined in a couple places has one of its mines shut down, the price will probably go up. If a new deposit is found or becomes easier to mine due to technological advances, the prices may go down. If a mineral becomes more popular for some reason, the price will go up due to increased demand. I hear smoky quartz and amazonite has increased in price due to the Weather Channel's show called ""Prospectors"" where that mineral combination is featured prominently. Historically there is a fun example about opal becoming less popular that I've read in a couple of places but here I quote wikipedia...  ""Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death. Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.""  Also the reputation of the vendor plays a role in the price. I have read stories about certain vendors buying minerals from one vendor at mineral shows then turning around and marking up the price a lot and selling the same specimens for more because they can. Even the venue can affect prices. Some vendors ask and sell minerals for different prices depending on whether they are selling it online or in person at a mineral show.  Related to supply, if a method to create a mineral synthetically is invented or made economically viable, it can reduce the price of natural specimens because you may not be able to tell the difference or because of the cheaper synthetic option. This more affects the gemstone market.  As with other non-essential goods, the economy affects the price. If/when the global economy collapses again, the price of minerals will crash too.  TL;DR: Supply changes, demand changes, vendor factors, venue factors, synthetic creation methods, the overall economy."
MineralPorn,2yepye,ISUanthony,3,Mon Mar 9 05:44:22 2015 UTC,To answer one of your specific questions...the best price guide is to look up recently sold prices for minerals on Ebay and online mineral retailers. But it's still hard to compare 2 specimens because of all the factors Iamnotyour_mother mentioned.
MineralPorn,2yepye,ISUanthony,1 point,Mon Mar 9 05:59:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies guys. All of this is sort of what I figured. I was in a hippie type head shop / clothing shop the other day and the had a small case with some minerals in them. I wanted to buy one ore two, but I really didn't know if they were a fair price, and I figured if I bought one, that might send me down a path of an expensive new hobby. I guess minerals are worth whatever the next person is willing to pay for them."
MineralPorn,2yepye,Iamnotyour_mother,3,Mon Mar 9 12:02:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, until you get a bit more familiar with the market, I'd stick with well rated eBay sellers to get your collection started. It doesn't necessarily have to be an expensive hobby. You're not going to be buying pieces of the caliber you see on this sub, but you can still get cool stuff at reasonable prices if you do your research."
MineralPorn,2yepye,ISUanthony,3,Mon Mar 9 18:08:55 2015 UTC,Hippie or New Age shop minerals can be extra expensive if they attribute healing properties to the minerals. I guess I left that out.   EBay can have fake or altered minerals just like any seller. Check out the fake educational albums on the sidebar.  I think labradorite is the best mineral to get started with collecting because you can buy big pieces for pretty cheap and they look awesome!

MineralPorn,2xi1bz,ISUanthony,2,Sun Mar 1 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"Pica (disorder):       Pica (/ˈpaɪkə/ __PY_-kə) is characterized by an appetite for substances that are largely non-nutritive, such as paper, clay, metal, chalk, soil, glass, or sand.  According to DSM-IV criteria, for these actions to be considered pica, they must persist for more than one month at an age where eating such objects is considered developmentally inappropriate, not part of culturally sanctioned practice and sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. There are different variations of pica, as it can be from a cultural tradition, acquired taste, or a neurological mechanism such as an iron deficiency or a chemical imbalance. It can lead to intoxication in children, which can result in an impairment in both physical and mental development.  In addition, it can also lead to surgical emergencies due to an intestinal obstruction as well as more subtle symptoms such as nutritional deficiencies and parasitosis.  Pica has been linked to mental disorders and they often have psychotic comorbidity. Stressors such as maternal deprivation, family issues, parental neglect, pregnancy, poverty, and a disorganized family structure are strongly linked to pica.

It IS illegal to own pieces of the Moon that NASA brought back, as well as some that were collected here on Earth by some academic expeditions. However, there are parts of the Moon and of Mars that were blasted into space by impacts, flew around space, and eventually landed here on Earth in the form of a meteorite. These are the pieces that are totally legal to buy and sell.  I was asked where I got mine. I got mine from www.sunphire.com/ They were only $20 each (or less if you buy one of each)! My pieces are of a different Lunar and Martian meteorite than what he's currently selling. There are lists of every Lunar and Martian meteorite located below. There are only around 100 small meteorites of each that have been discovered. My pieces are 12mg each. The little white circle the pieces are in is 1/4 inch across. There is information about their specific meteorite on the back of the display. There are many graphic options for the display cases, I chose these options. They even came with the stand. The pieces are small, but Lunar and Martian material is worth at least 10 times their weight in gold when I was shopping around. I think that Lunar and Martian material is 100 times cooler though!

There were originally two blades, and then the mineral just sort of twinned off of them and fused into one solid mass.  I've seen that happen before with silver and copper, but I had no idea Rhodocrosite did it too."
MineralPorn,2ww20y,poopgurpy,22,Mon Feb 23 17:39:16 2015 UTC,"Something like that could potentially be real if someone carved some real quartz's matrix (brown rock) into a skull, but the quartz looks a little too perfect. Maybe the quartz is lab-grown or cut to the right shape.  Is there a price on this? How big is it? If it's tiny, then it wouldn't be too hard to find a perfect chunk of tiny quartz crystals.  It would be easy to glue in a couple of fake pieces of nice quartz (real or fake) in the middle of the cluster, because you can't see the base where it would be connected."

""The skull is 7.7 inches long, from front to back."" They claim it's 100% natural. It very well could be, but it's good to be skeptical when spending $2,300! Someone could manufacture one with the tricks I outlined above, and sell it for the same price, but it wouldn't be worth that much if it wasn't 100% natural."
MineralPorn,2ww20y,nvaus,7,Mon Feb 23 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"Based on the other items on the site I would say it's real.

MineralPorn,2ww20y,akerue,7,Mon Feb 23 22:22:21 2015 UTC,"I would say this is a natural quartz specimen carved into a skull. The price seems correct. Since the original quartz specimen is not particularly valuable, the price reflects the labor and skill of carving."

The ""(It's BS, and it's bad for ya)"" is a reference to the Great George Carlin. These entries are worth nothing from a mineralogical viewpoint. This album is mostly glass, plastic, and paint. The goldstone and strawberry quartz can have mineral stuff mixed in, but so does stained glass, but you wouldn't consider that mineralogical. The only reason to have any of this is if you like it aesthetically. I have a small piece of goldstone and a set of ""rattlesnake eggs"" as a toy (they make a great noise: video).  The worst thing here is the ""Andara"" crystal. I see this shit regularly sell for $1 a gram! THAT'S TWICE THE PRICE OF SILVER! The one pictured sold for $840 (over $2 a gram)! IT'S JUST GLASS! It is garbage glass leftover from manufacturing, and this one isn't even very big. There are a lot of different made-up glass crystal names out there.  The rainbow calsilica also pisses me off. People will dry layers of paint and LIE by saying it's a natural stone. Fordite is kinda cool because it does have history behind it (real, vintage layers of American car paint), and looks cooler anyway (The picture is 2 views of the same piece).  Be careful buying Moldavite and other natural glasses. Some of the fakes can be really good. Don't buy it unless you know what you're doing.  The Chinese block minerals are scary. Look at Row K.

MineralPorn,2vro5c,GratefullyMe,3,Fri Feb 13 19:14:53 2015 UTC,I collect Moldavite. Show us a pic!  The one in the album above is actually one of the better fakes.
MineralPorn,2vro5c,Kizmau,3,Fri Feb 13 16:07:31 2015 UTC,Here is a picture of the Moldavite I bought.  I don't have the correct lighting setup to illuminate Moldavite so a flash light was the best I could do haha.  I was getting in to wire wrapping stones at the time and was looking for pieces that would work for a ring.  It looks like all the Moldavite chunks I've seen at the shops so I'm pretty sure that it's real.
MineralPorn,2vro5c,GratefullyMe,5,Sat Feb 14 02:51:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, Moldavite very rarely comes in chunks... It's mostly thin irregular pieces, because of its formation as droplets or splats. If you see a collection of pieces in a store, it would be highly unusual if most of them were chunky. They're more likely to be shard-like fragments.  The surface will be rough to the touch, some pieces more than others, but glassy smoothness is unheard of. It should also be slightly lighter than a piece of glass of the same size.  What I notice first about your piece is the colour, esp. that bright spot near the bottom. That's an unusual colour. I've never seen it in real life, but I have seen pictures of supposed ""museum pieces"" with that particular hue. Most Moldavites are a more olive/yellowish green.  So in conclusion, I can't possible say that your Moldavite is real or fake just from that pic. It's not impossible that it could have that shape or that colour. Weight, size and touch are important factors that I can't judge like this."
MineralPorn,2vro5c,littlebabyburrito,1 point,Sat Feb 14 06:25:13 2015 UTC,"It's definitely lighter than glass and I feel like the characteristics match the other chunky pieces I've seen when looking at it through a light. He had some flatter specimens that look more like what you would normally see in Moldavite, but I was going for something that could eventually be wrapped in to jewelry. It makes me wonder what actually goes in to making fake Moldavite. Trying to mimic the imperfections from a lamp working perspective seems difficult."

I overheard one of the older members of my rockhounding club mentioning that there's a big trade in fake Amethyst clusters. You know, those GIGANTIC geodes and chunks that always are sold en-masse to tourists at big gem shows.  He said that they're simply grown on concrete, and that you can usually tell if it's fake because they paint the bottom green to disguise the fact that the matrix isn't a real rock.  Is there any truth to that? I'm just curious, is all."
MineralPorn,2vro5c,KingJoffreyTheBaked,1 point,Mon Feb 16 08:16:27 2015 UTC,"This could be true, but there are real pieces of amethyst with green rock (http://www.galleries.com/Amethyst). This website states that the Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, Bahaia, Brazil locality of amethyst can have a green exterior rock, and I've seen that a lot because that area is a major producer of amethyst.  There can be fake amethyst for sure, but it would look like the fake green ""Tibetan"" quartz (from the fake quartz album), except purple. The colors are unnatural looking. Also, amethyst is so cheap, that it may be kinda pointless to grow fake ones.  I've read that one way to determine if a piece of quartz has been synthetically grown, there will be tiny quartz crystals on the rock on the other side of the big crystals. They form during the synthetic growing process and it's hard to scrape it all off."

But if you ask about it, they should be able to provide an information sheet about the stone's treatments. The link I provided has info about how often specific treatments are done. For example, emeralds are basically always oiled to fill in cracks, so just assume that any natural emeralds you see are oiled. It may be synthetically grown, but that's a whole other story..."

It confused quite a few of the customers as well.

MineralPorn,2vnkfz,Dromaeosauridae,6,Thu Feb 12 21:29:03 2015 UTC,"Peacock ore is not a scientific name, but most accurately applies to bornite. The stuff pictured on the left side of that image is called peacock ore but should be called chalcopyrite or chalcopyrite ore. It is usually treated with acid to artificially tarnish it and create an iridescence like with the first picture of pyrite.  Short answer, the stuff pictured on the left is probably never natural with that intense color. If it's called/labeled bornite, then it's a lie.

I never really thought about powdering minerals, but do you think that the shade of green changes as it becomes finer because it is getting closer to its streak color, which is its true color free from light distortion from chemical impurities that give it its well-known color?"

Check out Dromaeosauridae's other Educational Albums located in the sidebar.  Dromaeosauridae wrote the comments and provided some information, and I provided the pictures and most of the information.  As you can see, this is the first of a series! The series is 4 parts and one will be released every day. Each album will deal with a different category of fakes, starting with the varieties of fake Quartz.  Deceptive may be a better word than ""fake"", but the things pictured are definitely not 100% natural. The definition of mineral includes that it must be natural, and not human made, so I'd say these are disqualified as actually being ""minerals"". A lot of these things are cool, if the seller makes it clear that these are not 100% natural and prices them accordingly. We hope to educate everyone who is starting, or growing, their own mineral collection. Some of the pictures from the series are of my own minerals, so don't feel too bad if you have one of these fakes. :)  We may update these albums over time with more entries.  I have a long list of websites that I straight-up stole some pictures and information from. I'll credit them at the end of the series so that you all don't get an early sneak peek. :)"
MineralPorn,2vf3di,Enneirda1,3,Tue Feb 10 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great post!  I have a question:  How can you distinguish prasiolite from slag?  I recently had a mineral ID exam; after the exam, we were told that the mineral in question was quartz.  The sample was spherical (approximately golf ball sized), tumbled, unpolished, and light green with a 7-8 hardness.  The surface had small bubbles (approx 1mm diameter).  I question the authenticity of this mineral, but how can I really tell?"
MineralPorn,2vf3di,Enneirda1,3,Thu Feb 12 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"Well, quartz should be able to scratch regular types of glass (not fancy things like gorilla glass), but regular glass can't scratch quartz (which has a hardness of 7)."

Also it was basically thrown in with the purchase of a huge Uruguayan black amethyst geode, so at least I don't have to feel too guilty.  I recently saw a purple crackle-quartz point on ebay. The seller specifically says in the listing that it was artificially treated, so that's good, but honestly, does that really look like something you'd dig out of the ground? Come on.  I do think it looks pretty cool, if a bit gaudy, but it'd look terrible next to natural specimens in a collection. It'd stick out like a big purple thumb.  Can't wait for the rest of this series!"

MineralPorn,2vf3di,Dromaeosauridae,20,Tue Feb 10 18:46:46 2015 UTC,I would disagree with the statement that you shouldn't buy anything from those stores that tell you about their healing properties and energies. You can find some cool things for a decent price once in a while. Just know what you are looking at and pay no attention to the creepy dude who is trying to tell you what rocks will match your aura. I also live in an area where rock and gem shows are kind of far and my wife never wants to go with me anyways.
MineralPorn,2vf3di,Satans0nion,8,Tue Feb 10 16:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was mostly hyperbole.  Those places have sweet geodes sometimes.  The new age mysticism issue is just a really big one with anything Quartz related, and I don't even think it's done out of malice.  My guess is it's just the people who sell these things aren't always aware of common treatments because they approach minerals from a new age philosophy background as a opposed to a geological one.  A lot of their consumer base approaches it from the same angle, so having a strong background in mineralogy isn't necessary.  It depends a lot on what you're collecting and the individual shop though.  I would still say, if you're a new collector and you want  Citrine or smokey quartz, you would probably have much better luck verifying what treatments were employed if you didn't purchase from a new agey place."
MineralPorn,2vf3di,raymondgaf,6,Tue Feb 10 23:06:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would say maybe not if you don't know what you are looking at. They tend to throw the carved, dyed, and man made pieces in with natural formations. Maybe the person working knows what is what, or maybe they don't. They may even lie or embellish to sell something. Not that that can't happen elsewhere, there are better places to learn about what you are buying. If anything, I would check it out and look it up on my phone to see if any names given can help you identify what you are thinking about purchasing."

MineralPorn,2vf3di,Dromaeosauridae,2,Wed Feb 11 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"I really like these.  Some of the ways you can fake or alter minerals are really quite clever.  Of course its unethical as hell to sell fakes, but I still think they are clever, especially the metal coated quartz.  I also enjoy lab grown gems."
MineralPorn,2vf3di,fewthe3rd,2,Sat Feb 14 10:13:56 2015 UTC,"There is actually green quartz, but it's due to inclusions from other minerals such as chlorite. I own a few clusters because there's a famous locality for clorite-in-quartz within my own state, and while some of them look completely pastel green in the others you can definitely make out the individual blades of chlorite.  I really want to re-blog this, though. I'm tired of seeing tourist traps pass this stuff off with straight faces."
MineralPorn,2vf3di,autowikibot,6,Mon Feb 16 08:10:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry, this is just too negative for me. Why judge people's tastes? I can understand letting people know about what is real/fake, but judging people for liking seer stones and aura quartz is a bummer. They're pretty, who cares about if they're not as awesome as geodes or touted as new-agey things?"
MineralPorn,2vf3di,mineralexpert,12,Tue Feb 10 21:41:51 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with liking those things.  I, myself own a number of treated stones, as does ISUanthony.  The judgement is directed at people who sell these things as purely natural, or sell them as magical. People are allowed to believe whatever they want, but I'm also allowed to make fun of people who believe in magical rocks.    And while you may be fully aware these things are treated and still like them, not everyone is.  So if part of your reason for purchasing a mineral is you're excited about this natural color or formation, you'd probably be disappointed later to find out that's not the case, especially if you paid a lot for it.  In fact in a quartz album I put together awhile back I included Aqua Aura because its interesting.  And the geode thing is just a theme with my albums.  There's a bismuth geode in one that's artificially created and still gets love.  You got to lighten up about this, we're a pretty judgement free group all said and done.  No hard feelings, you still get an upvote.  TL;DR: These albums are intended to be humorous.  It doesn't matter what you like, so long as you're informed about it."

MineralPorn,2vf3di,Dromaeosauridae,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"Quartz clock:       A quartz clock is a clock that uses an electronic oscillator that is regulated by a quartz crystal to keep time. This crystal oscillator creates a signal with very precise frequency, so that quartz clocks are at least an order of magnitude more accurate than mechanical clocks. Generally, some form of digital logic counts the cycles of this signal and provides a numeric time display, usually in units of hours, minutes, and seconds. The first quartz clock was built in 1927 by Warren Marrison and J.W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Since the 1980s when the advent of solid state digital electronics allowed them to be made compact and inexpensive, quartz timekeepers have become the world's most widely used timekeeping technology, used in most clocks and watches, as well as computers and other appliances that keep time.

MineralPorn,2vf3di,batubatu,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:18:44 2015 UTC,"1) There is prasem/prasiolite natural green quartz. The original prasem comes from Greece, not Brazil - but real prasem is quite rare and expensive.  2) There is real orange quartz, it can also be red - but these are iron stained quartz or very saturated citrine. However natural citrine very rarely forms clusters and never forms inside volcanic geodes like the brazil stuff. So any ""citrine"" cluster on green + chalcedony volcanic bubble matrix is fake  3) The real jet black quartz exists, its called morion. Some morions are fully black with even edges completely black - eg. from Gorkhi in Mongolia. Also Lake George or Pikes Peak etc. in CO produce quite dark smokies. Most dark smokies from Arkansas are simply irradiated quartz, the same are dark smokies with dolomite from Turt or Cavnic in Romania.    4) The other common fake is to polish damaged crystals to make them ""undamaged"", some bastards manufacture fake crystals even from massive clear quartz. This is very hard to spot for untrained eye. The polished facets have different luster, not that sharp edges as natural crystals and dont have any striation or defects - which usually occur in natural crystals. Rock crystals from China or Brazilare often ""improved"" this way.   More about quartz types including good picture are at http://www.mineralexpert.org/quartz-genesis-occurence-varietes-overview.php or more detailed http://quartzpage.de/"

MineralPorn,2vbh6s,plurwolf7,2,Mon Feb 9 18:22:27 2015 UTC,I've seen jewelry with tiny pieces of pyrite in it sold as marcasite jewelry. Apparently that's what they call pyrite in the jewelry business. I guess it may be actual marcasite sometimes though.
MineralPorn,2vbh6s,ISUanthony,1 point,Mon Feb 9 23:48:19 2015 UTC,Actual marcasite is too brittle to survive long in a piece of jewellery. Pyrite has a similar appearance and is tough enough to withstand daily wear (granted it is still brittle)

MineralPorn,2urf7q,Kizmau,18,Wed Feb 4 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"You know, it's funny: I've gone my whole life knowing how fucking valuable gold is, but I've never seen it in its natural state. I mean it looks kinda cool, but there have been things posted on this thread that, if I was an alien that had no previous knowledge of earth minerals, seem way more interesting and valuable. Why is/was gold valued so highly when there are so many rarer/cooler looking things out there? Is it because it can be melded into jewelry? No, that can't be it. You can still make badass jewelry out of shit like this. I just don't understand."
MineralPorn,2urf7q,periwinkle27,37,Wed Feb 4 16:33:51 2015 UTC,"I just read up on this because I was curious as well.  It's actually fairly interesting why gold and silver are considered valuable and used as currency.  When you start going through all of the other elements on the periodic table, it becomes clearer.  Gasses wouldn't work for currency because they have to be contained and they are generally colorless, so you wouldn't be able to distinguish what gas you have.  Similarly, liquid elements have to be contained and some are highly poisonous.  Alkaline metals would be dangerous to carry around due to their reactive states. Potassium dropped in to water explodes!  Obviously, the radioactive elements are hazardous to your health, so that wouldn't work as a viable option for currency.  The rare earth elements are hard to distinguish from each other so it would be hard to know what you have. Out of what's left on the table, the majority are either too hard to smelt, oxidize or corrode easily.  All you are really left with are the noble metals; platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, ruthenium, silver and gold.  Gold and silver have just the right amount of scarcity and are easier to extract and process in to coin than the rest of the noble metals.  Silver tarnishes easy, so gold is considered more valuable."
MineralPorn,2urf7q,ballscuntshit,14,Wed Feb 4 17:10:40 2015 UTC,"Nice answer! I'd like to throw in that because of its long historical use and value gold is still valued today. Because gold is so easily processed and smelted even primitive technology could refine it. In ancient times there were tons of undiscovered placer deposits (places where gold naturally collects because of its density) that led to people find concentrations of native gold (nuggets). You know all the Pharaohs covered in gold jewelry and Knights with gold armor and such. In modern times all the easy gold has been found, we now have advanced chemical techniques to extract and refine atomic sized gold found in lode deposits of various kinds. Most of the gold ever found in the world comes from one deposit in southern Africa, Witwatersrand. Now gold is so important because that is what makes paper money worth something and thus makes a world economy function. At different times the commodity, gold, will have a high value or a low value or somewhere in between which is based on a few things: the amount of gold in reserve, amount in process, and known unrefined gold in deposits (and a ton of other economic influences). When the gold price is high, low-grade deposits become economically viable to mine, exploration is funded and more gold is found. When gold price is low, mining stops when it is no longer profitable to refine and collect a tiny amount of gold from tons of rock. The gold stops flowing and the economy gets stagnant. I don't mean to run on here but look into gold values around the great depression and how F.D.R. did some trickery with the gold price to end the depression. Or the price of gold in the late 50's and 60's when tons of money was put into technology for the space race. Anyways, I've always been fond of a fact when it comes to gold ""In 1969 you could buy a brand new Camaro for $6000 or 15 oz. of gold. In 2012 you can buy a brand new Camaro for $25,000 or 15 oz. of gold."" The numbers might not be accurate but you get the point."
MineralPorn,2urf7q,ISUanthony,6,Wed Feb 4 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Gold is rare enough (but not too rare), shiny, non-corrosive/inert, and workable because it is relatively soft, all which made it valuable to people back in the day which has carried over and still applies to modern times.  In modern times, copper does as well or better as an investment metal because it is actually useful. (I'm not a financial adviser, but it has basically been true in the recent past, past performance does not guarantee future results, don't take investment advice from someone on the internet, or anybody for that matter) It is easier to physically store a large value of gold though. That doesn't mean much if your investment loses a ton of value."
MineralPorn,2urf7q,periwinkle27,3,Wed Feb 4 21:59:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your detailed answer. I guess it makes sense that you'd want something not too rare to use as a currency (there's gotta be enough to go around) but also not too common or anyone could get their hands on it. Therefore, due to its usefulness as currency, gold's value is raised higher than rarer materials.   I'm guessing that the values of other common currency materials (copper, nickel, zinc) are skewed above the average ""value:rarity"" ratio due to usefulness as well.   Diamonds would fit into that category as well, since they're not as rare as we're led to believe, but still useful.  Are there any materials you can think of that fall unusually low in value despite their rarity/usefulness?"
MineralPorn,2urf7q,BecausePhysics,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:45:16 2015 UTC,Diamonds don't fit in that category. One ounce of pure gold = one ounce of pure gold and can be smelted and refined. Whereas every diamond is different.
MineralPorn,2urf7q,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Feb 5 09:13:47 2015 UTC,"Fungibility:       Fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution. That is, it is the property of essences or goods which are ""capable of being substituted in place of one another.""  For example, since one ounce of gold is equivalent to any other ounce of gold, gold is fungible. Other fungible commodities include sweet crude oil, company shares, bonds, precious metals, and currencies. Fungibility refers only to the equivalence of each unit of a commodity with other units of the same commodity. Fungibility does not relate to the exchange of one commodity for another different commodity.

MineralPorn,2urf7q,theideanator,3,Sat Feb 7 21:27:39 2015 UTC,"The reason bismuth is not made into jewelry is because it's not malleable. Bi ends up being really brittle because it crystallizes at a really low temperature, making it very difficult to work when all you can heat it with is fire. Also, that color coating is a very thin layer of oxide that wears off quickly, and it will go back into being a dull grey metal."
MineralPorn,2urf7q,Archardy,1 point,Sat Feb 7 21:28:08 2015 UTC,"Gold has a whole bunch of properties that make it valuable. It's very rare, extremely malleable, you can flatten it to something like 1/1000000 of an inch thickness. It doesn't rust, doesn't lose its luster, shines from any angle, makes excellent wires, conducts electricity better than almost any other material, the list goes on and on. It's very viable for high end electronics such as satellites and is heavily desired for jewelry and as a financial commodity."
