They're terribly proportioned.  Now, about weapons. Why is it no artist I've ever seems know how the fuck a bow actually works.   Let's start with the fact that the arrow is absolutely tiny for a real arrow. Those things are a few inches short of an adult male's arm, finger tip to shoulder.   Second, the bow string is not only horribly misplaced, but also hilariously over draw for how casually she's holding that bow.   Bow strings go at either end of a bow, not the near-middle, because they bend it when you draw, which makes the arrow fly. And if the bow string were that taught, she'd actually have to put forth effort to draw it back as much as it is. A casually notched arrow sits mostly past the bow, with a tiny draw on the string, if that.  And i'm not going to criticize this artist for that, because they probably learned about bow anatomy from other artists, who also have no fucking clue."

ImaginaryAzeroth,2o5l1f,Lol33ta,5,Wed Dec 3 14:14:21 2014 UTC,"I'm always really interested in seeing more stuff done with the High/Blood Elves. It feels like there hasn't really been much effort on Blizzard's part to actively incorporate them into the recent narrative aside from Kael'thas and the Sunwell, both of which painted the Elves as mana-thirsty utilitarians. What's great about the Draenei lore is that you get this rich backstory that illustrates both their peaceful devout side against their military prowess. Especially with Warlords of Draenor, we as players get the opportunity to struggle and fight alongside them to defend their home.  The Blood Elves have a similar situation where there are two conflicting sides: their history of magic abuse pitted against their desire to move forward as a civilization and race. Blood Elves have always been portrayed pretty ""clean""; they could benefit from showing their more martial side. Blizzard has kind of been underwhelming in the way they presented the Blood Elf conflict with the Scourge and Trolls. The inevitable confrontation with the Burning Legion could serve as a good platform to put the Elves in the spotlight."

ImaginaryAzeroth,2cqgcx,TheWorldEndsWithMe,2,Tue Aug 5 23:17:07 2014 UTC,There was a time when you could melee with hunters so maybe that's why.
ImaginaryAzeroth,2cqgcx,TheExtremistModerate,2,Wed Aug 6 08:02:41 2014 UTC,"And considering this looks like it's in Dragonblight (Wyrmrest Sanctum in the background), it would likely be back during WotLK, when you could, in fact, melee as ranged."
