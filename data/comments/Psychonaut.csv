Psychonaut,3e3a5t,north_america_sucks,3,Tue Jul 21 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"real happiness is bliss. Which is being satisfied and content. Maybe excited. Being a happy person, though, is a constant effort. Almost a game.  You have to fake it until you make it. Do it and pretend even when you're miserable. One day you'll just kind of realize that youre happy."
Psychonaut,3e3a5t,StoneFacedBuddha,2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend not trying to rid yourself of discontent by ignoring it and trying to quiet your mind; discontent is often a very healthy reaction to a mental situation that you don't want. Why should you tell yourself that everything's alright when you obviously don't feel that way? I do believe that everything is fundamentally all right and good, but within context it can be relatively not so for your conscious self, often as it should be. The discontent is there for a reason; it's there to show you that there are things you must change and let die about yourself in order to let your decisions and perceptions flow more freely. Examine your thoughts with honest scrutiny, really pay attention to your reasoning, let your discontent fuel righteous change within you. I've found that discontent is a much more powerful agent for change than love and happiness, because in those states you are alright with where you are. There's nothing wrong with that, as there's nothing truly wrong with anything, but an unwillingness to change and let aspects of yourself die will cause stress in your life. I also highly recommend the book Spiritual Warfare by Jed McKenna, as well as the rest of everything written by him. The most insightful books I've read, even if the backstory (or lack there of) behind the author isn't completely true. The best of will to you!"
Psychonaut,3e3a5t,coatspangler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. You clearly stated emotions and ideas I've experienced recently that I've struggled to vocalize, ideas that often get lost in my crowded peripheral.   I find introspection to be both beneficial and depressing, the latter more so in times of isolation or boredom. It's easy to reflect on the past and find a narrative to rationalize a state of emotion or perceived theme to your life, especially seeing yourself as a victim of misfortune at the hands of man, god, fate, whatever. Cultivating and reaffirming this narrative, in my experience, perpetuates a self fulfilling prophecy and an apathy to life devoid of motivation or simple pleasures. Furthermore, I end up trying to recreate moments of past pleasure which typically always end in disappointment.   The sustained times of happiness and fulfillment in my life were when I was able to assume the childlike mindset you touched on, going in open and with outward optimism, especially when feigned. There is truth to 'fake it til you make it'. Volunteering has been a big help to me as well. I found Big Brother/Sister or other youth based programs are great for me because it allows me to reconnect with that childlike mindset and attempt to be a benefit to the life of someone who often just wants someone else to talk to and have fun with.   Outside of that, I still struggle similarly at times and can find myself slipping into apathy if not careful. I'm interested in what others have to say."

Psychonaut,3e1kbk,Jackets298,13,Tue Jul 21 08:03:00 2015 UTC,bipolar + no meds + weed + shrooms... id say he had the best effect he coulda hoped for
Psychonaut,3e1kbk,sumyungho,4,Tue Jul 21 10:01:38 2015 UTC,Mostly what stands out to me is that he is bipolar and the shrooms could easily trigger a swing or episode for him.
Psychonaut,3e1kbk,MisterHydra,4,Tue Jul 21 08:53:52 2015 UTC,"What caught my eye was the ""He didn't take them that day"". It doesn't matter if you miss a day on many anti-depressants because it's not a drug that only lasts so long in the system. SSRI's which are used to treat forms of depression build up in the system, this is why it takes up to 4 weeks to see effects on a person. Just because he didn't take his meds doesn't mean they couldn't have interfered. Then again I don't know the interaction between shrooms and SSRI's or the drug he is on so this is speculation. Really though in all seriousness he should research that shit but also if the meds interfere talk to your doctor about changing it or don't do it. My doctor made sure I'd be able to smoke weed if I wanted to while on my meds (Non-disclosure is great)."
Psychonaut,3e1kbk,drunken_ocelot,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:24 2015 UTC,Just for giggles: you don't give bipolar patients SSRIs..they've been shown to increase the frequency of manic cycling. Gotta take a very careful history to not miss a manic episode in the past when diagnosing someone with something that you treat with SSRIs. Mood stabilizers also take a while to build effect and wean though..maybe OPs bf has heavier psychotic features in his condition and is on an anti psychotic like risperidone..that would be odd to experience a psychomimetic and antipsychotic at the same time
Psychonaut,3e1kbk,blahblahsentientpoo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:27 2015 UTC,Thank you for the information! I was unaware of the connection between manic cycling and SSRI's.
Psychonaut,3e1kbk,drunken_ocelot,3,Tue Jul 21 17:00:11 2015 UTC,"You would have to have him describe his experience.  I've had similar experiences from the description you gave where my ability to process language was next to nil, and my thought processes were disjointed/confusing/emotionally intense enough that I felt that silence and introversion were really the only safe options.  He may have woken up and seen the world as the play of the cosmic actor, as lila (sanskrit for the play or dance of god), and recognised simultaneously that the cosmic actor was, in fact, himself, in the deepest sense of the word.  For a person with no framework to interpret this experience it can be confusing, alarming, and even abjectly terrifying. My first experience of it was all of the above, and only a deep reading of Eastern philosophy, Alan Watts, Ram Dass and working meditation and chanting into my life have allowed me to sit with it in a constructive fashion.  Ultimately once one figures out that they are, in fact, the works, the godhead, the self, Brahman, the All, or whatever name you feel most comfortable with, if one comes to this realisation in lucidity and meets it with love, he will understand more fully than ever his relationship with the universe.  For me, it is to rejoin the dance in the spirit of joyful, loving participation. I hope that helps."
Psychonaut,3e1kbk,zyzzvya,2,Tue Jul 21 06:42:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you Z, unfortunately he does not remember the most intense part of his trip.  What he has described for me took place before he got lost. He said he saw the life cycle of whatever he was looking at, trees, plants, grass. Maybe if he could have remembered his trip he would have made it as far as you have.  It was beautiful to read what you described, I have just begun that journey myself (: Thank you."
Psychonaut,3e1kbk,zyzzvya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:07:19 2015 UTC,"I've had similar experiences again with seeing the genetic and experiential history of life, but I suppose seeing is the wrong word and feeling or being may be more suitable for these purposes.  Before you trip again, either of you, start practicing meditation. Any kind you like, whether it's yoga, chanting, tai chi, vipassana or just simply listening to the world go by, internal and external. These practices are technologies in a sense, they are ways of bringing you into direct sensory contact with your nervous system with the intent to learn how to use it constructively, and they are invaluable tools in giving a person the self confidence, spaciousness and calmness to explore the deeper spaces of being and experiencing.  The thing to remember is not to take it seriously, any of it, psychedelic or sober waking life. It is play, fun, exuberance! Completely purposeless! So don't fret, you'll sort it out ;)  Here's some poetry I wrote on the experience I had, hopefully it makes you smile :)  https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/3e19op/some_poetry_for_the_heart/"
Psychonaut,3e1kbk,Lagerbottoms,2,Tue Jul 21 07:20:58 2015 UTC,"I acted similarly on my first mushroom trip. I had a dose way too high. About 4 times the recommended beginner dosage.  I sat there with my friends, who partially were also tripping and I couldn't interact with them. I laughed once in a while or rambled some words, but all in all I acted in a similar fashion as your boyfriend. I couldn't understand basic concepts anymore, like as you described putting a seat belt on, except for me it was pulling my pants up after peeing or stuff like that.  I think he just experienced an average loss of ego. He forgot his place in the universe and how it works. He forgot how to function in every day reality. It can happen."
Psychonaut,3e1kbk,AWittyForumName,2,Tue Jul 21 10:21:44 2015 UTC,"Not taking your meds the day before a trip can stuff things up for you a bit. Most psyc meds work on an equilibrium principle which is where you get to a point that you are replacing the same amount of the med that you are losing each day due to metabolism and half-life in the body. If you miss a day you throw that equilibrium out of whack, it can be enough to make you feel a bit weird by itself, add a trip to that and your body and brain suddenly have a lot to handle.  Also people often underestimate the difference being well hydrated can make. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a factor in his trip."
Psychonaut,3e1kbk,watafu,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:49 2015 UTC,"Its not uncommon for this to happen to people with depression or bipolar while tripping. In reality if he is on medication, he shouldn't trip unless he is clean from it at which point he could make things worse for himself depending on the severity. My best piece of advice is to get him to start reading up on how the drugs, consciousness and the brain works. Maybe some buddhist philosophy and things like that. Sometimes its enough to jog the memory and make sense of events that have happened while tripping.  He will get through this fine, sometimes it takes a couple of days, some times a week or so but do not make him feel like something is wrong as this in itself can cause him to over analyse and create a feedback loop in his head. As someone who has had long term depression and uses psychedelics, its safe providing the knowledge and philosophy is there to back the experience up.   Just make sure he eats properly and gets plenty of vitamins, any questions just fire them our way"

Psychonaut,3e1kbk,watafu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:59:47 2015 UTC,"It was a bit of a generalization, but it is something to bear in mind. Not everyone will react the same way and get away with it, as soon as your mixing medication with drugs acting on the same receptors, your in some sketchy territory.

Psychonaut,3e1kbk,initial_CD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:25:30 2015 UTC,"There are different alkaloids in every individual mushroom species, that vary greatly, in effects and reactions. Psilocybin typically doesn't have many negative reactions with other medications, except MAOI's. Due to the tryptamine molecule. Odds are there could have been a slight reaction with the mushrooms and taking or not taking (when he was used to taking) his medications. Could of brought him into an interesting state in his trip, where his nervous system was switching between conscious/unconscuous. He should take some time to himself or with you in nature preferably, and just talk about the experience. I've always felt as if things happen on mushroom trips for a reason. Best of luck!"

I can't say much about the meds, maybe it had an effect, but this can happen on mushroom trips.  I went catatonic after eating 7 grams dried all at once.  Spent the first hour awake, next 2 are gone forever from my memory.  Apparently at the end of it I 'woke up' walked into my SO's room and laid down on her lap, mumbling something about time ending. But I have no memory at all of this time...  It's possible to just not have the energy you need to stay awake on a heavy trip."

Psychonaut,3dycxn,big_al337,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"I know I'm a little archaic, sorry, lemme try to make sense:  spatium inter vallum II (the space in between the palisades #2)  is a ""title"" of one of pieces. The title is because, well, Roman folks used ramparts and palisades on hilltops to convey messages. They called them Vallum and 'the space in between' them was called the interval. And I think this particular piece is about intervals (but also when tripping it gets really interesting).  Oh and it's #2 because I have another Palisades piece.   ""The Space In Between clathrates and the ex-cryotic soil.""   is about how all that frozen methane is getting through the permafrost as it thaws. And it bulges. Juts like this piece (well, to me anyway).    Lastly, The Space In Between Charnia and Labyrinthodonts is a piece about evolution, specifically the changes on our planet from the Precambrian to the Permian. Which is basically from the Charnia to the way cool Labyrinthodont teeth!   So I don't know.

The resulting experience is what happens when our intelligence meets this other one, but with the deeper trips, especially DMT, it's mostly a matter of us watching, as the information is so new and bizarre.   Anyway, OP's swastika came from somewhere."
Psychonaut,3dzgey,hashmon,3,Mon Jul 20 23:06:31 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical because of how different experiences are. It's not like there's one place where everyone ends up, and even repeated experiences from the same person can be very different.  I've tripped many times but had very few extremely intense tryptamine experiences. I've never broken through with DMT.  The thing I've reliably met is parts of myself which I normally ignore. I've had only the briefest glimpses that there's some other intelligence out there that way, and those weren't consistent in what I saw."
Psychonaut,3dzgey,north_america_sucks,3,Mon Jul 20 23:21:33 2015 UTC,"The most interesting argument for it is that people can experience shared trips, either sharing 'hallucinations' here or experiencing each other on 'the other side' when having simultaneously broken through.  Easiest way to know for yourself if something is out there or not is to try this for yourself.  Despite this I think it's both, our mind's making things up and that it's sometimes able to peak into other dimensions."
Psychonaut,3dzgey,AlwaysBeNice,2,Tue Jul 21 09:00:08 2015 UTC,"I totally hear you, but I implore you to keep an open mind, because the deeper level DMT/ayahuasca experiences in particular are extremely unique, and sometimes people can get to someplace similar with high doses of mushrooms. In Rick Strassman's experiment documented in ""DMT: The Spirit Molecule,"" the majority of participants recalled having ""transdimensional"" experiences. An Israeli professor named Benny Shanon did a study on ayahuasca experiences, and also found a strong majority saying they'd encountered ""other intelligence."" The thing about the DMT trips is that they ARE so eerily similar, and they often contain a lot of imagery that's common to shamanism as it's been practiced throughout history. Graham Hancock documents this well in the book ""Supernatural: Meetings With The Ancient Teachers of Mankind."" You can also read DMT trip reports online and note how common many of them are, and how many reference specific entities and beings. This is a good compilation: http://www.serendipity.li/dmt/340_dmt_trip_reports.htm"
Psychonaut,3dzgey,hashmon,4,Mon Jul 20 23:30:35 2015 UTC,"All that says to me is that the human brain is remarkably similar between individuals, and certain chemicals in the brain cause similar experiences among the people who consume them. There's no reason to think this has something to do with a collective subconscious."
Psychonaut,3dzgey,ibtrippindoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:37:15 2015 UTC,"You should actually read the literature sometime. It's very compelling. I don't know if ""collective consciousness"" is a good term. There's a separate intelligence that we encounter; on ayahuasca it's remarkably palpable. I've had the experience myself, from smoking DMT. It's there to be had; all f us who have had it have no reason to lie about it."
Psychonaut,3dzgey,hashmon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"It's not like there's one place where everyone ends up, and even repeated experiences from the same person can be very different.

The effects were very intense, and probably my favorite psychedelic experience to date.

A very natural feel, with a strong feeling of connectivity not just to other people but to the Earth itself, if that makes sense. I know that bridgesii contains certain MAOIs as well as mescaline, which is why it is preferred by some.

If memory serves me correctly, I believe there were 4 large ~12"" cuts, roughly 2.5 - 3"" in diameter. So a decent size. He said they're fresh cuts, too.  A buddy and I spent an evening with a 12"" peeling the skin off, coring the cacti and cutting it into chunks. We struggled for over an hour to each eat our half. I do not suggest this, at all. Even so, we got nothing from it. I assumed, perhaps, that I needed a whole 12"" trunk for myself in order to feel some effect. I spent another evening peeling, coring and dicing and boiled it down into a liquid. This takes a long time. I forgot about it near the end and scorched the cactus. So I did it all over again. I got it boiled down to a volume roughly the size of two shot glasses. Drank both and never felt anything.  I dunno man. I supposedly got the right cactus but no effects. Perhaps I need even more? Perhaps it wasn't actually the right type of cactus. It was only $30 so it was worth a try."

That IS the fulfillment of the process.  Over time these moments may lengthen--or perhaps not.  Be happy with what comes.  ""I see in daily life that my ego is..."" This.

In fact, it's something I think about rarely (honestly) and it has only come to my attention after a few months of not noticing it. The reason why I starting thinking of it again was because I heard that some psychedelics can cause this ego-death, and you can even make it more likely by going on a trip with the intention of introspection of the ego specifically.  I'm sorry, I also didn't quite understand your final paragraph. Are you saying that my noticing of the ego's effects are enough for me to make changes? My question though, is whether I do want it to change or not. This is something that really puzzles me  Furthermore there is a more complicated question on the value of honesty. We can say that finding out about the ego is honest inquiry. Does this honesty have some inherent value that may make it ""worth it"" to investigate the ego, even if losing it may have the negative effects of not being motivated by my own ego?

Psychonaut,3dxsue,Hashtag_JustHadSex,5,Tue Jul 21 03:07:54 2015 UTC,"All the talk about ego death is plainly wrong in my opinion/experience. You can't kill the ego. This vision is shared by all shamanic cultures.  Whoever says that he has killed the ego is lying to himself, without knowing. The ego will accompany you your whole life, it'll just get more subtle. When it gets more subtle than it was before people think that their ego is dead but it's not. This only does a disservice, as it make people think they are always a clear expression of the Great Spirit when in reality they are still being manipulated by the ego (even if less so than before).  You learn to recognise the ego, you learn how it works, you LOVE the ego, you don't kill it, as that is impossible. With time, as you learn and understand more about it, and as you connect more with your heart the ego will slowly move to a corner and will disturb you less and less. But it will always be there, it is a part of us in this reality we are living.  So again, in my experience, don't worry about killing the ego, you won't.  Edit: Regarding what you said about the ego being good in a way... That's the mind that's good for many tasks, not the ego. Without the mind we couldn't do an incredible amount of stuff, such as plan for things, decide how we're going to earn a living or what clothes if any we're going to wear in the morning. You can't even feed or find shelter without the mind. The ego however is a facet of the mind, which suffers from fear and believes in separation, duality. The ego will manipulate and lie, as everything is confrontation, it'll think about your/its preservation above anything else. Mind and ego are not to be mistaken, the mind is necessary to live our life and as long as it is guided from the heart. The ego on the other hand is not necessary and it will always separate you of who you really are, but you need to live with it and love it for what it is, a feature of yourself that lives in fear, not love. Love it, for it can't understand nor experience the truth.  In general my experience tells me that in the Western World we haven't paid enough attention to Shamanism, these guys have had all this figured out for a long long time. We tend to pay more attention to what the New Age started moving, to westerners that starting working out all this stuff almost from the start, thanks to the influences of entheogens and other energies... And that's all fine, we westerners  started breaking from a very limited view of the  World to try to make sense of it all, but in doing so we haven't paid enough attention to those guys in jungles or other lost places that already know all this stuff. We think they're kind of right, but that they add too much artificial magic shit hehehe. In reality, should I say in my experience, we are the ones that are absolutely primeval in the art of interpreting reality, a thing they've mastered.   Of course this doesn't mean you are to trust what shamans say, on the contrary you need to experience it for yourself. It's just that in general terms there's a lot of people lost in a way of thinking that doesn't match reality, thinking in stuff such as killing the ego."
Psychonaut,3dxsue,raccoonlife,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much for your reply. What about loving your ego? Won't it grow?  I hate to sound like I'm repeating my question, but I'd love if you have anything to say at all. Is it really better to learn how the ego works or should I perhaps just live my life as I always have? Could it make my life worse in the ways that I have stated, if I do go to introspection? Or maybe these experiences are not for me?  Thanks again"
Psychonaut,3dxsue,sssimulacrum,2,Mon Jul 20 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"No, the ego won't grow if you love it.  I believe you probably need to live a duality dissolving experience, an ego discovery experience. The mind is not designed nor can it understand reality so it doesn't matter how much you philosophize about all of this, you need to experience it .   You need to experience LOVE. Not the love we've been culturally taught, not even the Love you think might be beyond your cultural limitations. Because anything you think Love might be is not. Do not be afraid, the path of self discovery is mighty comforting, just like a mother is to her child.  Experience, experience and experience, that's always the right path. From your experience and through Love you will make sense of this reality. Anything else that doesn't come from experience is a creation of the mind, and as I said the mind is not designed to interpret reality.  I'm sorry if I can't accurately describe what any of this is. You need to live it yourself :)  Edit: oh sorry, about loving the ego, you will love it because with time you will understand it better, you will understand yourself better. You will realise that the ego is like a deranged person, or a person with learning difficulties, you won't blame it for all the damage it does."

Psychonaut,3dxsue,fuckspeciesism,3,Mon Jul 20 16:12:34 2015 UTC,"Kind of this, this is better on track. YOu can't destroy the ego, nor would you want to.  Instead, USE IT POSITIVELY. A tool, like anything else, it's good in moderation or used properly, bad if you let it get out of hand.   The ego, the SELF, is PARAMOUNT to life. It is PARAMOUNT. It is the sole reason that anything is achieved, ever.   ""ego death"" is a lie. The self is all there is, why would you ever want to get rid of that. If you really could, you'd be destroying the universe. Because what your ego is, is a smaller version of what the universe is (the big self)"
Psychonaut,3dxsue,sphynxthelyon,3,Mon Jul 20 22:38:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't believe that taking a psychedelic will cause your ego to die. Ego is a part of you, consider Freud's explanation of the ego's roll in consciousness. The ego is like the visible part of an iceberg, it's what people can see yet they only see half of what your ego is. Only half of the ego is exposed, the other half is submerged. The super ego and ID are the other parts of the metaphorical iceberg. Freud may have just been a bit coked up when he came up with this, but it's a very interesting concept. I think you're thinking some good thoughts, and if you just so happen to come across some good doses you should dive in head first."
Psychonaut,3dxsue,RedErin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't read Freud yet but I've been recommended it. Are there specific books you would recommend on this topic?   I appreciate your suggestion of just diving right in but I must say I am scared. I can experiment myself with making my ego bigger (doing things that make me seem good to myself) or I can go the other way and try and fight it. Or as you say good doses may cause a rapid change (although interestingly you say not death, which I haven't heard before)  I'm afraid because I think these are changes that are hard to revert. And because as I said, I think my ego has some place in me doing good things and improving myself, although improving myself is good because ""my ego feels satisfied"". In a way, it's a kind of loop and I'm not sure that I want to play with it  By the time I have written this, I have realised that my own question may be unanswerable. I can continue playing my own game and patting my own ego on the back or I can have an honest conversation with myself (which maybe I am already) / explore it with psychedelics and find myself possibly less happy, but at least knowing the truth  Perhaps it sounds like I am really overcomplicating it at this stage, but it reminds me of a book I read recently, Fahrenheit 451. It raises the question that we can live happily, choose to avoid difficult questions and this will likely maximise our ""well-being"". Or we can live honestly, learn about the world and it will likely make us more sad, but with the upside of confronting reality in the purist way. Which is better? I simply don't know. And I'm not sure if anyone does"
Psychonaut,3dxsue,RedErin,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"I think the ultimate goal is to create your own way. These are philosophies, not religions to be specifically followed. At least for me, I have realized that although total ego death and the ""letting go"" of my attachments to all things is certainly ""the way"" for inner peace and enlightenment. HOWEVER, I have also realized that I quite enjoy my ego as well. Therefore, I have decided to learn to be AWARE, and treat my ego like a light switch. I have the ability to let it all go and be peaceful, but only when I have no need for it. Most of all I want to be aware of myself and the world around me, so that I may tailor my own thoughts or lack of thoughts to my desires.  Also in reference to your last point, yes, it is interesting that ego-death is usually sought after because it will bring enlightenment and a higher state of being (wanting yourself to be happier/better). This is ironic. However, what one finds is the more you let go, you lose the sense of wanting to BE better and just BE."

To me it sounds like it is best to drop this ego death goal. It is only confusing. Like others said, ego is a permanent part of you, to be used as a tool. Also don't blame yourself for thinking of yourself as better than others in some aspects. The mistake that people make is they are condescending to others and cannot separate their ego from them. If you are interested in psychedelics, think of it like taking a trip to learn about your life basically. A ride through emotions, memories, thoughts, realizations and getting a glimpse of truth. There are deep places to go and see and understand within you but don't get lost. Don't fear. Observe. learn, have fun. Also I recommend mushrooms for your first time. Duration is about half of LSD and perhaps easier not to freak. I'm only 23. Can't give you more advice."

I've had trips on psilocybin and salvia where the entire material world seems to dissolve and is replaced by a dream-like state where I am no longer a human, but pure awareness experiencing very  abstract things that are somewhat close to dreaming. I don't think it's some kind of permanent state a person can reach.  It sounds like you're working on becoming aware of your ego, though. Which is very good indeed. Just don't try to push it away or reject it. You're only a person. You'll never be perfect. Ever."

There is so much beauty, wonder and mystery within this universe - the moment we begin to truly utilize the power of our minds in making sense of what reality really is, is the moment we feel empowered, and the moment we feel empowered is the moment we are truly our most powerful.

This is rather short-sighted, in my opinion, because a good placebo can be an excellent way to treat a wide range of ailments.  This is probably the single biggest unexplored aspect of medicine today: what is the placebo effect? why does it work? how does it work differently in different people? why does it work for some people but not others? can it be cataloged and used explicitly to heal?  But Western medicine has a singular opposition to the use of the mind to heal illness, therefore placebos and things like placebos are verboten."

Moreover, one of the known phenomena associated with LSD is that it's easy to get into a repetitive thought process.  If anything, it sounds like it's very possible that the symptoms of OCD may be exacerbated and the obsessive thoughts could very easily intensify, possibly even creating more trauma for you.  The last thing you want to happen is to make things worse, end up in the ER with psychotic symptoms, etc.  How experienced are you with other drugs (weed might be more helpful for you right now)?  Have you been diagnosed with OCD by a doctor or is this a self-diagnosis that might be attributable to something else?  Have you had any kind of counseling or treatment (and if not, why not)?  I am not a fan of the psychiatric establishment but there are endless other kinds of resources out there for emotional/social support.  Bottom line, I really, REALLY do not recommend throwing extremely intense drugs into the mix without attempting to gain some kind of insight into the OCD; contrary to popular myth, LSD (and other drugs) do not--and cannot--magically reveal groundbreaking insights into yourself without any kind of emotional work.  If you would like some resources on community based mental health support networks, please just ask--I can point you in the direction of some things that have helped me immensely."

Someone or something either gives or receives it, and a relationship bonds with the two sides of the transaction. Have an example.   If I put my books on a bookcase with a purpose to keep them there for storage, the books will be kept there for storage. There's me, who makes the books go in their place, and there's the books, who go into place because of my purpose.  If one approaches life as the one who gives life purpose, you can therefore go about that life whatever way you see fit."

You just are. all judgements of your condition aren't anchored in any known reality, and unfortunately your descriptor words for your resistance to you trend negative.   If you have had mystical , religious, psychonaut experiences and your brain thrives on its destruction.   My simple advice is to simply change the pro noun you operate under.   Use we instead.   When that locks in you'll see that your illusory judgements against yourself don't hold water in the face of the acknowledgement that we are all of this.  Day to day fix.  Music. Find music that makes your heart soar that makes you leave the house to connect with others who love what you love just as much if not more and sing together or create together. In that midst of creation in harmony you'll be awash in your new pro noun.   When we becomes your pro noun  It's impossible to be anti you.  Go smoke a joint, grab your favorite band, jump on your bike and sing your balls off.   Smile from your balls, there's a ton of people in our we that will benefit from this simple experiment once it locks in.

When I was struggling through depression and suicidal thoughts I didn't even know the reason why I felt that way. Why did I want to kill myself? Am I that unhappy with myself that I'd take my own life? I began to think about how others would feel if I died and that gave me great sorrow. I than thought about the pain I was feeling at the time and compared it to pain of my loved ones if I killed myself. This life is a precious gift.

I liked to get to that point where my ego melted and I could just be one with the universe.   Once on mushrooms I almost died, had a baaaaaaad time. That was fairly early on. As I got older the drugs just laid flat on my ego rather than eliminating it. I felt like the world shattering moments were taken over by feelings of just how boring it was. Drugs sort of limit your abilities and it's boring to not be able to play guitar like you know you can or function properly in society or think clearly or communicate clearly.   I have a 7 month old son now and my ""get high"" is planning for his future and enjoying every minute of his new life. I still love to smoke and drink but I can't do it every day like I had been.  I have someone who depends on me for their life and wont risk getting wacked out knowing something horrible could happen and I'd be forced to call the cops or rescue.

As you get older people expect you to behave certain ways at certain times; I acknowledge and accept that. I don't like scrambling my roles as much as I used to; there is definitely the time and the place for it, there just isn't this huge drive like there used to be."

Psychonaut,3dqwrf,Jackisath,24,Sun Jul 19 12:25:29 2015 UTC,"I've hung up the phone numerous times once I got the message I needed, I've occasionally called when I have questions, and I've been called when there are answers to be had.  Respect the psychedelics and they'll respect you.  Everything we need, whether you like it or not, comes to us when we need it.  I don't think there is one primary message but the quote does make one think of the message they're looking to get from their psychedelic use, if any."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,_sisyphus63_,15,Sat Jul 18 17:30:05 2015 UTC,"While I think Watts was extremely important to the movement of ""know thyself"", I can't help but remember every time this quote is mentioned, that he drank himself to death. Did he never get the message of alcohol? I think it was an off-handed comment he made as an excuse as to why he quit psychs. He probably just didn't want to do them anymore, but needed a profound sounding reason as to why he quit.  Having said that, I think it resonates in our community because there seems to be universal truths of love and compassion for yourself and others, that we learn from the psychedelic realm. I think the message is love and understanding, that everything is one, and that your reality is what you make it, to a certain extent. The message is everything you say and do effects everything and everyone around you, so be mindful of what you say and do. After my first profound trip I ""woke up"", for lack of a better explanation. I knew these things on a intellectual level, but I didn't live them, I didn't feel them. Now I do, but I forget, or get shitty and angry and I have to be reminded. Either with drugs, or meditation, or just friends family or SO calling me a fucking asshole and pointing out my shit."

I also ""woke up"" but then later on I woke up from my waking up and realized I was being an annoying hippie with not enough grasp of the common reality. I still have my compassion and love etc. but I really do prefer being able to see beyond my own world for most of the time."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,goodtwitch,10,Mon Jul 20 05:59:11 2015 UTC,"LSD is great for augmenting your ability imagine things in such a way that they seem more real, but communication I got from what presented itself as God or higher energies was really rather ridiculous sometimes. I began to realize that acid simply takes what you happen to be thinking about and enlivens it in the imagination, making it seem more real. In other words, it's a great tool for imagining you can chat with Jesus, but whatever you're experiencing isn't necessarily Jesus. It might be, but then again it might not. And I do believe that there are real higher energies and I do believe in spiritual forces. However, it's the flexibility and responsiveness of the drug that makes me think that it's not necessarily a pipeline to truth. However, it can certainly help you open your mind, introduce you to great ideas and broaden your perspective, show you crap you need to change about yourself and so on. I'm still open to doing it."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,higgs8,20,Sat Jul 18 18:40:26 2015 UTC,"I took shrooms and ""got the message"" without expecting it at all. The ""message"" is that I am all that exists and that I have known this all my life without noticing it. Every person who ever lived, lives, and will live is me in a different body, just with a different personality and a different environment. Everyone's consciousness is the same. In fact, everything in the world is the same. The world is an illusion brought into being by the longing of the world to know itself, that is, the longing of you to know yourself. You are eternal, you are not born and do not die. You came before the world, and you are outside of time and outside of space. In fact, space and time and the things within them are your ways of seeing the world, they are not real - only you are real. Space and time merely help you understand yourself just like a slow motion recording helps you understand something that is too fast to see.  But all that matters is that who I really am, and who you really are, is one, or as some call it: God. All religions try to explain this and do so very well, but mostly people fail to understand because it is beyond comprehension, yet so obvious that everyone knows it deep down.  Science is motivated by ultimately understanding everything, and this ""message"" is the understanding of everything. All motivations of all people who ever lived, everything that was ever done by humanity, was to discover this one thing. Except most people never knew what their true motivation was, they just felt a pull from what they called ""truth"", ""justice"", ""happiness"", or whatever they thought they were pursuing.  Once you are shown this under the influence of psychedelics or meditation (they achieve the same thing but psychedelics make meditation a lot easier and faster), you cannot forget it, because you understand that you have known this all your life, except you could never quite put your finger on it. How come I am aware? How come I am only one specific person out of the 7 billion? How can I know if the world is how I see it? What can I really be sure of? These are good questions that point to the truth, but no one really offered a satisfactory explanation so we just shrugged it off.  It is like a mathematical demonstration of an equation. Once you ""get it"", you know it's true, no one can convince you otherwise, it becomes your own knowledge. You don't need proof of your own existence, it is an absolute truth, and you go from there. This is all that matters.  Why hang up the phone - i.e. why stop doing psychedelics - once you understand this? Because psychedelics can only show you a temporary glimpse of this truth, but you will have to gain the truth again sober in your everyday life. You can keep doing psychedelics if you want, but there is nothing deeper it can show you, because this is all there is. Of course it can show you more things within this truth, but not beyond it. Psychedelics can convince you that there is an undiscovered truth in the world. Once you are convinced, you must ""hang up the phone"" (i.e. no longer require convincing), and then go and find out for yourself."

Maybe the fact that I exist and am conscious at all is that the universe began to question itself, and what it is.  Good post man.  I don't know if I will agree that psychedelics run out of things to show me, but there's just so many substances I have yet to do.  I have certainly had the realization that we are all one, and I am part of everything all at once and that time is not something real but just something my body experiences.  And your first part is very much like the story ""The Egg"" too which I'm sure you've read.  First time I read it was shortly after having my first ego death experience and I was honestly terrified that someone else had written down in such a perfect story what it was I experienced.  And that it was just their own imagination, not even drug influenced."

I have OCD, and my mind works on overdrive to find reassurance to appease my obsessions. I learned that question and answer are inseparable. Once I found an answer to a question,  that answer produced more questions similar to cutting off the head of a hydra. I learned that questions and answers are just another game of the snake trying to eat its own tail. I still use psychedelics, but I've hung up the phone on questions and answers."

Much like the question and the answer being an infinite loop game, so is the journey and the destination.   You're only ever here and now so the path is just another manifestation of the destination and if you think in terms of past and future: ""I'll be happy when I reach the destination""  or ""Wow that was a fun journey"" you forget to enjoy the actual experience and are trapped in the infinite loop of searching for something to something and then you'll be happy.

I now understand truly the value of moderation when it comes to psychs."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,huehuetlatolli,27,Sat Jul 18 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"My message was related to anxiety(social).  When I took some shrooms and went for a walk through the woods, I went off the beaten path in fear I would run into people (social anxiety). So as I was in the middle of nowhere, I felt another surge of anxiety creep up that was unfamiliar since there was no one around. Then I started to ""fear everything."" But I noticed my social anxiety wasn't even that by of a concern as it usually is.  That's when it hit me, the message.  When you fear everything, you cannot put the exorbitant amount of energy from fear into one thing(like social). It took away the intensity!! So by fearing everything, and distributing the fear across multiple platforms, you don't fear anything truly.   So I ""fear everything"" today, and nothing truly affects me as intensely as I once did.   The message: By fearing everything, I truly fear nothing."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,infinity_QE,21,Sat Jul 18 19:08:52 2015 UTC,"I had a very similar experience to yours, but with DMT. I was on LSD and MDMA and got offered it, but I was scared and only took a small hit and laid back. I didn't really blast off...it felt like I was going to, but something was holding me back. All I saw were some cool colors forming patterns. Then, clear as a day, a calm voice said, ""You're never going to get there if you don't let go. Just let go.""   I shot back up and was like, whoa. I get it now. I asked the people for another hit, took a real good big one and held it as long as I could, then laid back and let go. I did blast off, but nothing too crazy...I just went bursting through different galaxies and walls of patterns/shapes/colors that don't exist on this earth while thinking, ""Yes, I am finally calm.""   I came out of it feeling so refreshed, and that feeling hasn't left me today, four years later. I also suffer(ed) from anxiety, especially over things I couldn't control, but all that was gone. I realized that you just can't be happy and truly enjoy life when you fret over every little detail and stress when things go out of whack, and most importantly, I was holding myself back from loving life. Now when things go wrong or I don't have control, I'm just like eh whatever, it's fine! Much better.  Sorry for the wall of text, it was just hard to explain! The only other time I've been so moved from a trip is when I did LSD by myself, highly recommend."

Fear is a very important part of being human, and instead of pushing it away we must talk to it. Communicate with the fear: be its friend, understand it, walk with fear hand in hand and face the void."

When I'm through I'll stop believing in me and my truth and believe in eternity. I will become everything, then split away from it and hide my knowledge of it so I can again receive it, become part of it, relive it. Joy in simple things. It's not just a ride, it's just a fuck.

Psychonaut,3dqwrf,mekon18,7,Sat Jul 18 19:05:20 2015 UTC,"I've gotten a few good messages while traveling, although none if them caused me to hang up.   We are beauty and love, we should spend our time expressing that and sharing it with others. Reality is a spectrum and we are experiencing a tiny sliver of that spectrum based on our perceptions. This goes for the most fundamental laws of the universe and our most trivial personal preferences.   What caused me to hang up the phone was the message my body and mind was giving me. I experienced how my mind reacted differently to things like alcohol or marijuana. It was clear something shifted in my head and that it was time to get off the ride with only minor long term affects."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,BlueDream831,14,Sat Jul 18 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"I got the message on my first trip. I learned who I was and who I wanted to be. It was earth shattering. I got to know myself in about three hours. I realized many things about my thoughts and actions that were the opposite of who I really wanted to be.   I did not hang up the phone, and that was a decade ago. I still call from time to time, because I'm not the same person I was when I first heard the message. I advance, regress, learn new things, form bad habits, make new relationships, and in my case, make new people. And while it isn't really necessary, it helps to integrate these new experiences into my life in a productive and positive way. Plus, it's funner'n Hell."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,mekon18,4,Sat Jul 18 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"Care to be more specific?  What did you learn about you that sticks, and what have you decided you wanted to be?  Has it lasted?  The only ""message"" I've received that seems long lasting is that music is fucking legit and that if I look at the phrase ""hearing voices"" I hear voices all the time; an unlimited number at a time in various frequencies and many timbres and I'm able to modify them to sound like ones I've heard before (this is a music joke).  Music is something I feel that I'll never understand, but my mind and trips have been telling me that I should try to relate what goes on in my head and bring it to the real world.  And that's what I'm working on, that's for sure."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,Lost_In_The_Grass,8,Sat Jul 18 17:34:53 2015 UTC,"Well, as much as we are all the same, we are all different. I've had experiences in my life that hindered me from knowing myself. That's what drew me to psychedelics in the first place. I had no idea who I was really. I latched on to a cool friend and assimilated his opinions, or I would look to a celebrity for his or her opinion on something. Looking back on that now is kinda scary. I can't imagine being that person anymore.  If you feel a draw to music, I believe that is existence/God/the over-soul/the universe/your will trying to manifest itself in that way through you. Music is interesting. I had a trip once where it was obvious that music is spiritual magic, and I still believe that in a way. It's a way that we all can relate to each other and speak to each other, regardless of language. It can change the way we feel in an instant, and can take us places.  You asked about what the message is, and mine was to figure out who I am and be true to that. I've gotten other messages, not the least of which was to find a version of spirituality and God that made sense, but they all were made possible by that first time."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,BlueDream831,3,Sat Jul 18 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"Well that's very understandable to me!  To be honest, the quote made it seem like it was a bit more terrifying than that.

Psychonaut,3dqwrf,Ghandithegman,9,Sat Jul 18 18:03:41 2015 UTC,"I've always taken it as a warning about relying on drugs too much and using them as an escape instead of a tool. There's a reason the members of Pink Floyd, etc. moved away from heavy drug use eventually. It can get stale if you don't take time to integrate what you know. It can have negative effects if you aren't enjoying sober life as well. That's just my opinion on it. I believe that I do much better if I only do psychs once or twice a year, which is difficult if you are bored on a Saturday and you have a sheet in your underwear drawer.

As much as we can say things ""exist""; the closer you look at them, the more you see that they aren't really there. All of life is an illusion, so there's no point in trying to find some deep mystery to life. It's like when you put two mirrors together, everything gets tinted green. It would be absurd to say ""I want to touch that green and hold onto it and keep it as a pet!"": it's just as absurd to want to hold onto these transient ever-dying and ever-changing objects around us.   I took some drugs because I kept pushing for more ""answers"", but I think that sober waking reality provides enough answers as is, and I've had my taste of the psychedelic experience enough to get a counterpoint to ordinary reality. It would certainly be mind-expanding to do some more shrooms or maybe some mescaline in the future, but probably for the next 5 years or so, I need to be able to integrate what I've seen with waking life and find my every-day answers."

Meditation is a much better long term solution, but I know if I never did psychedelics I never would have found meditation. I worry that too much drug usage causes unnecessary brain fry. I'd rather keep it safe and spend however much time I need to integrate the lessons from psychedelics into my own life without constantly needing a cheat sheet to look at - it's more liberating and empowering. I only pick up the phone when I feel like I absolutely need help again. Then I remember and go back to meditating. Psychedelics are the map of the terrain, but meditation is actually walking the terrain. Combine the two and see how they are both pointing to the same ultimate truths. Too much psychedelic usage will definitely throw someone off balance, especially if they don't know how to discern multiple potential realities and limits of knowable truth. Psychedelics are very healing when used wisely."

There are a few words for it: enlightenment, awareness or transcendence.  Meditation can unlock something in your brain. It's a mystical experience that's at the root of almost every religion. It's the essence of Buddhism, but Christianity has almost entirely forgotten about it.  Psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin or DMT can get you to that mental state almost effortlessly. It's not as profound as reaching it through meditation, but you can get a solid glimpse of what lies beyond with the right dose of the right molecule and the right state of mind.  It transforms the way you think and experience reality completely. Getting the message is freeing yourself from the desire of conditioned things. You free yourself from your ego and your roles.  Imagine that you're a character in a video game. You're Mario. Mario has no idea that there's a world that transcends the 2D reality he lives in. It would never occur to him that his movements and desires are controlled by a guy sitting on a couch in a dimension that transcends his. Mario's reality is very simple, he must advance, jump on various things to kill them, eat mushrooms and save the princess. When Mario gets the message, he wakes up as the guy who holds the controller.  There are various levels of enlightenment, from knowing what it feels like to being able to live in this bliss permanently.  It's very difficult to discuss with someone who hasn't experienced it and this was a problem for the lecturers too. If you listen to Ram Dass' talks, you often hear him refer to it as the ""ahhhhh"" and it's understood that those who experienced it know exactly what it is."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,Everday_is_420,3,Sun Jul 19 00:38:45 2015 UTC,It seems like a lot of people have said this is it!  Isn't awareness that you are all that is and part of a greater picture that is not understandable a sort of transcendence?  Granted living in bliss permanently is not something people here seem to have achieved.
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,Everday_is_420,3,Sun Jul 19 00:56:39 2015 UTC,"At the time I posted my comment, the comments were mostly about growing out of psychedelics because, among other things, the responsibilities of adult life and about learning a very specific thing about themselves that doesn't apply to someone else.

Even though it was such a beautiful and blissful experience I felt a bit lonely as I coundn't communicate it to anyone because no one would understand it. I think that quite a few people have experienced meditation to such extent.

Psychonaut,3dqwrf,iwasacatonce,3,Sat Jul 18 18:42:03 2015 UTC,"I hung up the phone.  The message is that if I continue to pursue that path further, then I am only distancing myself from others-- when the whole reason I walked that path to begin with was to achieve happiness, which for me involves some closeness with others.

Psychonaut,3dqwrf,TheWillyWonkaofWeed,3,Sat Jul 18 18:50:42 2015 UTC,"For me, a message was how much I loved dancing. I just love moving my body to a rhythm. But my whole life I've told myself I'm a terrible dancer, can't dance, etc... When I thought about ""getting good at dancing"" it just seemed like an overwhelming amount of work. But when I understood that I simply loved it, I realized I could dance anywhere, everywhere. Waiting in line at the grocery store, while making breakfast, while Work is slow. I could infuse my life with something I love.   So rather than practicing for an hour a day, I could practice all day long.   Doing this enhanced almost every day that I've been alive since, and it's a wonderful way to make people smile, since when you're really getting into a song, you are happy and you look a little ridiculous, and seeing that kind of enthusiasm is contagious. And since that trip, I've gotten a lot better at dancing. Which makes dancing even more fun.  So that's an example of what one ""message"" was for me. And hanging up just entailed going and being. Be out in life and stay connected to yourself and the world."

If survival is the goal, we must look at the collective human race and perhaps even the Earth itself.  Looking just at passing your own genes on is ignoring something potentially greater."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,crackercider,3,Sat Jul 18 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"Well the message I've been getting is different from most. Of course I have felt the inter-connectedness of all life, and even all matter, but I also feel like I'm being pranked/punked by the universe. Some sort of tasteless cosmic joke to be thrown into the game of life and forced to vicariously compete, or die. Since (most of) us on Reddit live in a first world country or are fairly well off in a third world country we are disassociated from this viscous competition but I am so fascinated by it that I find myself traveling to Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador every few months. These countries fascinate me, how hard these people live. Some people have to do so much evil just to survive, and some have so much evil done unto them unjustly just so somebody else can survive. And I bet it's even worse in certain African countries, and even worse still in places like Syria or North Korea, but to be honest I'm too cowardly to go these places even though I really want to.  I used to get so hung up on this stuff and obsess about helping these people or changing the world, but then I discovered magic mushrooms.  Thanks to them I have a new perspective on the world. It's all a big cruel game. At least, cruel from our point of view. There might be something more to it but I sure as hell can't see it.   In this game, we compete and reproduce. It's how it's always been, it's how it is, and probably how it will always be. And honestly, I'm 100% fine with it. I'm down to play the game, I hate the game and sometimes want to quit, but I've got nothing better to do."

If we make it past our animal 'muscles and sharp teeth'-based bully-hierarchy it will end. And so not even violence is evil, it's just beginning to be obsolete as we can organize ourselves with our brains instead. But it's no one individual's problem to deal with saving people, and you shouldn't waste your time too much worrying about it. Unless you must do something, then of course you just must.

The phrase ""Hang up the phone"" fits so well. It's like you wander deeper and deeper into your mind and into all of space and time, searching for the message. When you find it, sometimes it's a question, or a riddle if you may, that takes, days, weeks, years even, of reflection. I've taken a break before, and I've just begun another. Last night opened some doors and showed me some demons, the kind of demons you don't want manifesting themselves in your trips. And I'm afraid, for myself, of what might happen.

Psychonaut,3dqwrf,Aquareon,2,Sun Jul 19 00:24:26 2015 UTC,"Note: I'm not so much of a psychonaut, only give a look over at this subreddit every once in a while because it's interesting, but I've still had my few experiences.  It's an interesting turn of phrase. One thing I've always believed about psychedelics, and just drugs in general, is that we put them into ourselves to build something with them. I mean look up the video of the dude with some motor neuron disease smoking weed and how it sorts him out in seconds, gets rid of his twitches, all that. And when I've taken psychedelics I've nearly always come out of it with some sort of belief or something like that, like I'd manufacture some sort of spiritual belief with what I was putting into me, and that could then last for ages after.....I was literally building mindsets, basically. So maybe that's what it means? Definitely something curious I think anyway.  Or maybe it's just about bad trips, lost friends etc., which eventually killed off my chemically adventurous side."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,LoopTheRaver,2,Sat Jul 18 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"Well, personally what caused me to stop using psychedelics was that I realized while tripping that I was free. I don't know exactly the right words but it was a sence that I could make anything of my life and if something was making me unhappy I could just stop doing it. I realized everyday when I wake up my destiny depends on my choices, there is no destiny and there is no higher power. I found that without the thought of a higher power I could make the most of my time here on earth, there's no one judging my actions and making decisions for me.   Once I realized that I began to question the authority around me. The police are just regular human beings, the president is no greater a man than I, he just made different choices than me. And then I questioned the people around me, there's nothing that makes them more important than anyone else. I realized my mother was no different than a passerby on the street, the only difference is that I've spent more time with my mother than a random person. It sounds odd I know, but this is what I mean by truly free, no one and no thing matters.   This was the message. However what caused me to hang up the phone was realizing I could truly be happy in my life because I had found this freedom. Since nothing and no one matters I could be happy all the time. There was no limits any more, nothing could hold me down or make me sad because it didn't matter and so I spent all day everyday happy. I became completely satisfied 24/7 the guy on the road driving like an asshole doesn't matter so why care? My boss at work is being rude and obnoxious, I don't care because I can go out and find a new job tomorrow if I want, or move to India if I want.   Nothing could annoy me or make me unhappy because I didn't care, the bad and good didn't matter so why would I spend even a second of my time on the bad, I made it all good. In a sense I achieved my own enlightenment. I was a depressed and suicidal person before but after a long journey with psychedelics I was able to be happy all day everyday and feel good about myself.   What other message could I want? My life was great and I became a better and happier person. That's the only message I ever needed to recieve, nothing else could possibly make my life better."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,teratoid-din,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"I have certainly felt the same, though it is hard for me to keep with that mindset.  Maybe some day I will feel that way permanently.  It has made me care more about what I'm doing at least.  I think about things like ""if I'm just a collection of sensory input, and if I was able to play back everything my senses have seen thus far, would I find it interesting?""  and while that's a strange way to put it, I have made some good life decisions from that.  Of course I still have my problems, but I am making progress.  I'm glad you haven't felt the need to continue use.  Some day I will be where you are!"
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,needan_accounttopost,2,Sat Jul 18 23:57:50 2015 UTC,Ya it definitly took me a long time of not only psychedelic use but also meditation and deep thinking.

Psychonaut,3dqwrf,teratoid-din,2,Sun Jul 19 00:09:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure this is apt but I'll give it a shot.

Psychonaut,3dqwrf,GUY-WHICH-LAUGHS,2,Mon Jul 20 01:30:35 2015 UTC,"I'm only 20, but in the past 2.5 years, I was abusing weed, LSD, 25-NBOME's, shrooms, coke, mdma, and opiates. The weed and alcohol were daily with the rest ranging from weekly to every couple weeks.   It took a massive toll on my mind and body. It depleted me of a good amount of motivation, and was part of the reason I didn't do very well in classes.   After a while I began to realize that I wasn't having as much fun as I was before. My interactions with people became more of a chore, I was finding more and more comfort in retreating into the depths of my mind.   At the end of the second year (before the 6 months), I began to realize that I was losing sight of myself as a person, the ideals of working hard to accomplish something, of going the extra step to do something the right way.   I realized that the friends I have, and had, who needed to be trashed all the time, who were using the drugs as actual drugs, to fill a void, I needed to distance myself from.  This was undoubtedly the hardest part of hanging up the phone. I realized that I needed to start making more responsible choices  that would shape my future in the way that I always wanted it to.   With the end of those 6 months, I started my summer internship at a Fortune 100 company. I work 50+ hours a week.  My ""high"" now is coming home mentally exhausted after managing projects, creating and presenting presentations to executives, and going above and beyond in everyday work.  It may not seem fun, but coming home and laying down in bed, exhausted, is one of the greatest highs in the world.   Plus, a $2,000+ paycheck every other week doesn't hurt ;)  I'm still figuring a lot of stuff out. I still need to learn how to balance everything out, but that's what the phone call says.   Balance of Opposites.   You can't go through life a goody-two-shoes who always does the right thing, becasue you'll never have any fun.   You can't be high everyday because then it starts messing with you.   The key is everything in moderation, love people, don't judge, and be a good human being. Get trashed every so often, but don't ever rely on it."

Psychonaut,3dqwrf,earthwrldshaman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:10:13 2015 UTC,"Wow. The whole time I was thinking that quote meant when the psychedelics tell you to stop using psychedelics, you should stop using them. But now I see that it could also mean hanging up as soon as you learn the nature of the experience. I definitely pushed it to the point where I had a DPT trip that convinced me I was frying my brain (120mg rectally got me a mild +2). Kinda am happy I pushed it far enough to see both angles though.  Rant over; OP I think the message is something you have to find yourself. Psychedelics let you find yourself, they put your deepest, most hidden but influential views on the world into your senses so that you can discover why are you are who you are."
Psychonaut,3dqwrf,spirit_of_mckenna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:30:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah based on the full quote from the other guy, it seems like you can easily view it as when do you stop looking inward during a trip, and it's when you get that message.  Then go and have some fucking fun you're tripping balls.  And that's absolutely how it's worked for me."

Psychonaut,3dqwrf,We_are_Gaia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:31:47 2015 UTC,"Just wanna lay it out there that the message is relative to your current question. Once you got that message, there is no need to keep reflecting on it, but instead act it out. That doesn't eliminate the possibility of other messages to get, leaving you open to call for as many times you feel the need for.  I personally haven't gotten ""the"" message - the one that gives me enough answers to go sober - and I'm not sure I really ever will. There are so many ways to use and implement these experiences that I believe there will always be another message if you're looking. But only time will tell I guess.  So keep dialing, but if you no longer get anything more out of it, the message has probably been delivered already."

Psychonaut,3dqxwq,buzzingbody,10,Sat Jul 18 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"This sounds like you're having a kundalini experience. This is a somewhat esoteric form of energy that's different and more powerful than what yogis call prana or doaists call chi. It's described as a serpent coiled at the base of your spine. In a sufficiently open person it can be coaxed up the spine. This can cause any number of perceptions,  but most characteristically it is a tingling or buzzing like you described. It can be a source of immense pleasure or it can be someone's complete undoing. This isn't something that's well-understood, but I believe it describes an experience which humans are capable of encountering. Try posting in /r/kundalini and you'll find some really helpful and informed folks to give you some insight about what you may be experiencing."

Psychonaut,3dqxwq,texture,4,Mon Jul 20 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"To be honest my experience has started to make me believe any time others do not understand a feeling you're having it's because we are not using a proper method to describe it.  It's hard as fuck to describe something with our words they're very inefficient.  To me, it sounds like you're referring to what others call butterflies in their stomach.  Or the ""chills"" which you can hear when a good song comes on or something pleasureable happens.  So you can just do this at will?  Why not try sustaining it a bit longer?  Experiment with it brother!  You experiment with what goes in your body, experiment with what comes out :)"
Psychonaut,3dqxwq,workaccountoftoday,5,Sat Jul 18 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"I definitely know what you mean by that. I agree that quite often misunderstandings are simply an issue of poor communication rather than fundamental differences.  This, however, is certainly not butterflies. By the ""chills"" do you mean asmr? When your hairs stand up and you get a rush of energy? I've experienced both of those phenomena but they are not what I'm referring to here. It's simply a warm electrical buzzing throughout my body that I can activate just like I would flex a muscle.  As for experimenting with it- I definitely will. For a long time I thought nothing of it and that I was just making it up or something. Tonight I'm going to take a dose of psilocybin and try doing the same thing to see what happens. Thank you for your response :)"

Psychonaut,3dqxwq,jetlags,6,Sun Jul 19 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is pretty normal!  The funny thing is that anyone can do this (especially with training) but they just don't. Doesn't fit the standard model, which is why people look at you like you're crazy. They could all do it too, though.  You might be interested in finding a really good Tai'Chi (or similar) instructor and doing some training!  This is actually one of the (many) energies that's involved in the concept of ""chi"" in that art, and methods of directing it through relaxation, internal body manipulation, and attention.  What you're describing is only one of many, but it gets pretty complex and fascinating.  A really minor exercise you might dig would be to stand with your hands pressing (lightly) against a wall and initiate the feeling and see how the wall affects your body. If that's interesting, try the same with different materials and objects.  Thanks for bringing this up!  A lot of people seem to have this experience and then feel weird when other people don't understand. You're all good though :)"
Psychonaut,3dqxwq,lux-ex-tenebris,2,Sat Jul 18 19:27:43 2015 UTC,"I can attain this by sitting very still and conscious focusing on it, but it starts in my extremities and radiates inward through my conscious ""pushing"" of it. If I am laying down extremely still, I can sometimes push it into the base of my skull, but I can never push it into my chest or stomach. Muscle movement disrupts the feeling immediately, however, and I definitely don't feel any muscle twitching."
Psychonaut,3dqxwq,Oaknot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Any kind of muscle tension definitely dulls the sensation for me, too, however I can still feel it. If I'm standing it takes more concentration to initiate and never gets as intense as if I'm sitting or laying down.  I seem to be the exact opposite in that it radiates from the center of my body and is very hard to feel in my extremities, especially the hands and feet."
Psychonaut,3dqxwq,humphreydog,2,Sat Jul 18 17:27:22 2015 UTC,"I started doing this as a child. Not sure how I figured it out but I still do it to this day although not as much. I would always do it in stressful situations or when I was getting anxiety. I start by flexing my kegel muscle and 'release' the energy which would radiate across my lower back to the back of my arms and to the top of my scalp.   Along with doing this and the sensation I would envision a purple sphere that would grow out from my torso and envelop me and my surroundings and at the same time say to myself, ""everything is going to be alright"".  The sphere would start as the smallest possible size, smaller than an atom, like planck length. This way there's no way it wouldn't miss anything in its volume. I could then have it grow to infinity, engulfing people around me and the universe."
Psychonaut,3dqxwq,Unrelampago,2,Sat Jul 18 18:26:36 2015 UTC,"I used to do this all the time as a kid, if it's the same thing.

Psychonaut,3dqxwq,fknpee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"hi, i have had the same thing for years. i really enjoy the feeling and actively send it different places in my body. its great for aching feet !! mine doesnt get overwhelming and i can sustain it for a long time. it does get irritating after a while though. for the past two years i have been training as an energy healer and as a result the tingles as i call it are mainly in my hands now.  the tingles are what led me to healing in the first place. if i want them to stop i use visualisation to ground myself and they stop. they seem to really help my healing :) hope this helps.

People I've told about it don't seem to know what I'm talking about either, but this has helped me stay aware of when I can and cannot do it. Please let me know if you find any scientific explanation for it."
Psychonaut,3dqxwq,humphreydog,2,Sat Jul 18 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yes! It's definitely much easier for me if I'm seated than standing. Lying down is even better.

Psychonaut,3dqxwq,Jellyjamcakeinapan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:25 2015 UTC,"There is one similar thing I learned to do when I was meditating, and it was to flex inner muscles near my back ( I don't really know what they are in particular), it creates a sensation that's very hard to describe. It's almost like you say, a warmth. It creates pressure in my skull when I do it. Like I'm trying to force something through the top of my head. I've always just assumed it's because I'm putting pressure on my spinal chord.   Your nerves are constantly tingling and get a sense of vibration if you focus. There's nothing different about you. You've just turned your attention to your self and once you get a sense of how something feels in your body it's hard to let go.   I was never conscious of my heartbeat for a good 28 years of my life, then one day I could just feel it. It's because I got REEEEAAALLY high one day and just lost focus of everything but my heartbeat. Now I constantly feel it, and if I don't feel it I panic.   Right now if I focus on my hands they feel warm and tingly. I'm not shooting magical energy through my hands, this is just how my hands normally feel. We just tend to not notice. Either way, it's not going to make any actual difference in your life. It's really just kinesthetic sense."
Psychonaut,3dqxwq,Balthazar3000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:16:42 2015 UTC,"Ahh so your take is that it's simply a redirecting of awareness rather than an actual change in the body? That's interesting. I've had the same feeling of being extremely high and becoming aware of my heart beat, but that may have been because when I used to get super stoned, my heart rate would actually spike and my heart would be pounding. I never really enjoyed that, to be honest it kinda scared me.  I can't seem to focus on my hands and feel them tingling like you say, but I'll continue to experiment with it. I didn't mean to imply this sensation was anything metaphysical, I really haven't a clue what it is."
Psychonaut,3dqxwq,Benjiimon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"I'm posting to this response now, but one thing I've noticed from doing the ""headspace"" meditation series is that the method they teach you IS an awareness of your body.  They basically start each session out saying to kind of learn to shift awareness to different sections of your body.  Being aware is like a good chunk of life if you ask me."
Psychonaut,3dqxwq,lefezaka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"i can do it at will now. however whennit first started i had no control and only got it when relaxed and usually lying down like just before sleep. when i started to try and control/ direct it i used to visualise the tingles as a ball of energy, usually yellow, and then try and send it wherever i wanted to. again i had to be very relaxed to do this .  sometimes it worked often it didnt. don't really know how i got it to change and under more control but that happened similiar time to me beginning to meditate and go to healing classes. now its in my hands at will and i dont really get it at base of spine anymore. im able to send it anywhere i want in my body and when im healing it feels likenit extends out of my hands into the other persons energy field !! people being healed say they can sometimes feel it and i certainly can !"

As for those who can only do it after trips? Not the craziest thing to imagine that you could figure out how to manually control subconscious behaviour while on psychedelics."
Psychonaut,3dqxwq,thestarsaresuns,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:20:12 2015 UTC,"I can do something similar to that when I'm tired. I bend my spine a certain way and pull my stomach and breast muscles together(so they tense up). I get a surge of energy radiating from the lower spine. I do that until the energy reaches my head and my brain gets completely clear. The clearness stays for about an hour, or less if I'm really tired. If i try doing it longer the energy overgoes to pain and my whole body becomes stale and hurts a bit. I wont be able to sleep after that since any position, laying down or sitting or standing, is uncomfortable. Also the clear head then gets replaced with a botherd and irritating bunch of thought loops. I have learned to balance it nicely over the years tho. Thought it was normal to do this, but in different ways. I got the impression some crack their necks and get a similar effect, also twisting the spine right and left. Never thought to ask if it really is the same thing."

Alan Watts makes you re-consider everything society has ever made you think was common sense, deconstructs it, and explains a more lucid way to handle life.  The Undiscovered Self - Carl Jung  He's got some cool ideas about the parts of ourselves that we don't like, which, if you've ever struggled with self-doubt or self-hatred, can be really helpful. Integrating your ""shadow"" is a rewarding endeavor.    The Lord of the Rings - JRR Tolkien  Because it's easy to forget to read a good story when you get caught up in the mess of psychology/spirituality/stateoftheworld type books.

The person I was within and the person I wanted to be outwards. I was insecure, but always portrayed being secure. It never felt good, but over a few trips I changed more and more into the person I wanted to be. Now I truly feel like myself.  Psychs can make wonders if used right. I truly believe they will play a hughe role in 'curing' depressions and other psychological problems and illnesses in the future. Also it's amazingly fun! Shrooms, acid, molly and nexus forever!  Weed used to be my favourite drug, but when i started using psychs properly weed just seems meaningless. Sure it's nice to smoke and take drugs in general, but my attitude to drugs have changed a lot since. Previously I couldnt even be sober for a day.  Then i started taking less drugs only to combat my ADD symptoms and lately I dont even have to take my medicin to function in everyday life. Sure I suffer from my ADD symptoms, but now I'm just myself so I wont have to second guess myself and can just act.  It's simply amazimg. I could talk for hours about psychadelics and how they have affected my life, but I should probably stop now amd just go to bed!  Happy that you got over your depression! Good luck in the future!"

Psychonaut,3dq6rs,bor3dwizard,0,Sat Jul 18 14:31:18 2015 UTC,"Oh boy I don't even know where to begin  I've left this world for long enough to realize that I can't fix ""now""  Humanity is fucked now.  We have so many resources but we shit on eachother over the fact that the other has less paper in their wallet.  It just stuns me that people don't see the lack of empathy, or lack of willingness to help those in need - as a concern that need to be addressed NOW; because there are too many that are confused  All the terror and bulllshit  All the religion and bulllshit  All the government and bulllshit   Edit : money and bulllshit I don't give a fuck about money Sure I got lucky where I am a goodlooking smart 20yr old kid But I also got to deal with a whole lot of horseshit And I don't sit on a throne as though the world owes me something  I owe the world my life.  Life is a miracle That's it No ifs or buts  If it didn't harm anyone, it didn't deserve to die   But nowadays it seems like killing people caus you ""can"" or someone ""told you to"" (ordered); is common  Absolutely no respect for life is left."
Psychonaut,3dqwnc,CsaCharlie,8,Sat Jul 18 16:20:18 2015 UTC,"I will focus on the first paragraph.  If you have some time to spare, I would very much suggest that you watch this old television programme with Alan Watts. There are more episodes to the series, but watch that one in particular since it refers directly to the first paragraph that you mention.  I'll attempt to make some sort of summary below:  So we tend to think of things as actual objects of substance, but when we examine them closely an honestly we find that they are in themselves more like processes. A tree is not a fixed form, but an impermanent motion in complete interdependence with the whole universe. One clear analogy is to look at a wave in the ocean; Each wave lacks independent existence in itself, because it is an arbitrarily selected point of motion in the whole ocean. Similarly, a cloud is not an object of substance floating in the sky, but a pattern-ing of the whole atmosphere. And it is not a permanent pattern, it is an ever-changing pattern, never still, and never really there as itself. Look at the sky with relaxed eyes, and you'll see the whole of it morphing. No cloud comes into existence from somewhere else, and it goes nowhere else when it disappears; The cloud was never a noun separate from other nouns, or separate from the background of the sky, but a verb of One. (The same principle apply to our common ideas of birth and death.)  In the same way, so the human body is a process. Cells are continually renewed. Bits come and go. New hair, new nails, new this, new that. There is no fixed core of actual substance at the center that we can attach the label I to. But we tend to imagine that such a core exists, and that is what we tend to refer to when we say I.  Now we tend to think of empty space as some kind of nebulous nothingness that separates things, but really it is what connects things. Space relates to matter as thin air relates to clouds, or as still water relates to a wave. It's just the non-moving between the patterns of motion.  So in that sense, there are no separate nouns in reality, just a big verb of nature that is arbitrarily chopped into bits and labeled so that they can be talked about; A wave is not a noun, a thing, but a verb and a doing of the whole ocean. So you are a doing of the whole universe, just like that tree, that rock, that beetle, the sun, and so on.  You breathe, but you really don't know how; Your blood flows, and it seems to do so spontaneously. The stomach digests foods without any input from what is refered to as I. In the same way, thoughts appear. Actions happen, the human body moves. But there is no mover inside the body. The movement of the human body, as well as the stream of thoughts, are an expression of the motion of the whole universe in the location here and now. Here it is, in Watts' own words.    A useful and relevant thought-experiment is to imagine oneself as a perspective of awareness in nature that is perfectly analogous to the perspective of touch that is the two hands of the one human body.  Your right hand can never feel what the left hand is feeling, for they are two perspectives of touch. But the body is one organism-pattern. Such is the nature of individuals. They are not individual things or nouns, but individual perspectives.  So who or what is aware? Nothing and everything. Neither nothing nor everything. Forget language. When an infant looks at the world it tries to touch the moon with its fingers, because it does not recognize itself as anything other than what is being perceived. It is so fully immersed in the present moment that it does not know itself as anything but a language-less silent awareness. It is the whole picture, full stop.  Look beyond the boundaries of your visual field. Become aware of that no-thing-ness. How big is it? It has no size, does it? But it is there, as a necessary background to the foreground of your visual experience. It is beyond the flow of thought, as it contains the flow, just as it contains the perceptual awareness of the flow of the whole situation. That is the boundless and ineffable you that can not really be talked about. One can point to it with words, but seeing and feeling is a matter of experience rather than conceptual understanding."
Psychonaut,3dqwnc,scomberscombrus,3,Sat Jul 18 16:43:42 2015 UTC,"Dang, I've had my mind blown in this past half hour than I think I have in ever. Yeah I've taken acid about 3 times (all fairly low, about 100ug) and I've been meditating for about 11 months now but the boundary dissolution that Alan Watts talks about in his lecture slapped me in my face.  The concept of Maya, the stars and constellations, and how picking out different parts of a scene to describe later all make so much sense to me. Distinguishing objects is fine, it is not fine however when we take these fictitious inventions to be true.   It's like Calculus how people can measure a squiggly line (just like in the lecture) by zooming in on it until it becomes straight.   Pleasure pain, life death, up down, shit man the non duality is indeed real. Thanks for helping me out."
Psychonaut,3dqwnc,scomberscombrus,3,Sat Jul 18 17:39:23 2015 UTC,"Glad to be of help! I will tell a brief story and share a particular moment from another episode of that previously mentioned television series.  As life unfolds, I sometimes find myself in situations where it becomes very clear that a shift in perspective is imminent. It's like one is working on this fairly complex mathematical problem. So one has been sitting with it for a while, drawing, thinking, discussing it with a friend or colleague. But the solution has not presented itself. It's like one needs to look at it from a different and wholly unknown perspective. The great problem is that  the perspective can not be found by looking, because by the act of looking one is already projecting one's known perspective onto the unknown, and so it is no longer the unknown. So one has to let the unknown unfold into one's perspective just in the same way that one allows sleep to happen at night. Does that make sense? I guess it's the classical Heureka!-moment.  Anyway, there's a brief moment before the insight comes. First there's the problem solving stage, which involves a lot of perceived effort. Then there's the relaxing part, where the problem recedes into the background of awareness. And then just before the Heureka!-moment, there's this intense feeling of no return. The problem one has been working on will now be solved, and it will never again be un-solved. One's reality is truly about to change.  In the case of the mathematical problem, it may be trivial. One might get a more complete intuition for a some concept through seeing a geometrical solution to something that has only been symbolically known in the past. But in other cases, such as the idea of Oneness or whatever you want to call it, it may be that one becomes truly incapable of feeling any form of directed and long-lasting resentment toward anything. Why? Because one sees intuitively that no thing has any independent existence. To hate one aspect of this situation we call life is to hate all of life and the whole universe, because it is what comes together to form this very moment.  So that's the rambling part done. Perhaps it gave something, perhaps not, but it did feel appropriate!  I wanted to say all of that, because this way in which Watts talks about the Buddhist concept of samsara made me feel like I was pushed over a ledge. I fell, and I didn't know where. It was confusing at first, but then I landed and saw that it was a lot of old contemplation coming together to form some sort of feeling."

It just makes sense, remember how I mentioned I've been meditating for about 11 months? Well yeah, each morning I start my morning off doing 15 minutes of metta meditation and the other 15 being mantra and through this metta meditation, I have found it hard to get mad at anyone for doing something I perceived as bad.   I was often teased through grade school for being different and when I started metta, I found it incredibly hard to direct feelings of love towards those people that treated me that way. Now after a couple of months doing it, I am starting to realize that it is not their fault. Well yeah they are the one's that voluntarily brought about that action of teasing but so many factors contributed to why they teased me. Maybe they were feeling empty and wanted to fill a void, maybe their family members tease them and they never were taught that it wasn't ok to do it to others, maybe, maybe, maybe, I don't know.   The point is that once I started to see the bigger picture, that so many things happened in the past that led up to that moment and that the people doing the teasing were influenced by their environment, it naturally became easier to direct feelings of compassion towards them.   Y'know I used to seriously think that people were stupid when they say things like ""I cried for Dylan Roof even though he killed many people."" Before I would be like, ""He killed many people, he deserves the biggest punishment allowable!,"" but now it's like ""Wow your right, his childhood must have been really traumatic and he needs help."" Even though what he did was very very  (bold just in case) wrong, I still believe that he deserves compassion. Because compassion knows no bounds.  Jesus christ I thought you were typing a lot of stuff but now that I'm responding, I wrote like 4 paragraphs! Hahaha. Love ya man."
Psychonaut,3dqwnc,scomberscombrus,2,Sat Jul 18 21:33:22 2015 UTC,"I love you too!  But hey, just a quick pointer toward a further slight shift in perspective: It's not that individuals are influenced by their environment. An individual is a momentary expression of the whole environment itself. A tree grows like it does, not because it is influenced by the soil, the wind, the sun, e t c. The tree is itself the formed coming-together of the soil, the wind, the sun, e t c. One might then point to the seed, but the seed was too such a coming-together!  It may seem like two identical statements, but they can be interpreted very differently. An analogy for clarification: A whirlpool is not influenced by the ocean; A whirlpool is the ocean itself. When you look at the whirlpool, you are not looking at something in the ocean, you are looking at the ocean itself.  It's not that you are unable to direct hate because there are so many unknown factors. The reason that hate can not be directed is because directing it anywhere in particular is to direct it everywhere. If you hate one thing, then you necessarily have to hate everything including yourself, because it's all manifestations in and of this one unfolding present moment.  It's like the metaphor of Indra's net. Check the Watts quote on the right-hand side; For one dew drop to hate another dew drop in particular is for it to hate the entire web and its structure, including itself."

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,galacticsewerrat,147,Fri Jul 17 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"The second time I ever tripped I was sitting in a car with my friends having a great time when I started to think about a deep question: Why don't we know why we exist? Why don't we really know anything? It felt like there must be a reason for it. If something created all of this why were we purposefully left in the dark? It started to make me feel completely abandoned and upset to the point where I was even getting mad that a creator would actually do such a thing. It was a very powerful burst of emotion that somehow sparked an extremely vivid descent into insanity. My entire field of vision split into panels that started sliding apart. Those panels split apart into further panels and this deconstruction of reality continued like a giant machine until I was staring into a new space that existed between the frames.  I was left looking at this sort of cave opening, out of a which a man appeared. He answered my questions. I recoiled in absolute fear. He proceeded to tell me all sorts of things about the nature of reality. How everything is a lie and the reality we're experiencing is only a fraction of what's actually real. And we were left in the dark. On purpose. And I wasn't the only one who was upset, there were lots of people, and they were fighting back. He wanted me to join them but if I did it would change my existence forever and there was no going back. There would be consequences. It was straight out of the matrix. Only this wasn't a movie, it was staring me directly in the soul.  To this day I've never been as scared as I was in those moments. It's nice to think that you're ready for true knowledge but nothing can prepare you for what it's like to actually be presented with the chance to learn it. Even if it actually is all in your head. It was a choice that I wasn't ready to make. I wasn't even ready to start thinking about how to make that choice.  I was completely afraid and tried shutting him out. I didn't want to know anything more but I couldn't get him to stop talking. I knew I was tripping but something about this experience felt even more real and vivid than my actual existence. I felt like I had already done something very wrong just by listening. I turned him down. He was looking for someone to make a difference. I was a coward.  And that was it. In a flash I was back in the car with my friends, all of them talking and smiling like nothing had happened. They just laughed at me when I tried to explain what I went through. And then they carried on exactly as they should have.  This experience almost completely destroyed my life. I didn't know what to do anymore. I questioned everything. I couldn't do the normal routine without feeling like a robot. Nothing felt genuine. I was so disappointed in myself for not being able to handle it. Fear and anxiety had ruled my entire life up to that point and I had completely failed at a chance to beat it. I just couldn't cut it.  This all happened 10 years ago. I was a sophomore in college, still young and naive. I just wanted to have a fun experience like the rest of my friends but instead I was ejected into inner turmoil. I've suffered from major depression episodes ever since then. Nothing feels like it's worth doing because everything feels empty and fake. I just don't understand how everyone is content going about their day to day lives the way that they do. I can't find enough new things to do to distract my mind from the fact that I know nothing and I'm doing nothing about it. I'm fully aware that the experience was most likely all in my head, like a dream that manifested itself into my conscious being. But that still doesn't solve any of my underlying issues. The thoughts and concepts from that night will never leave me.  So thank you OP. So much. I've never posted anything about my experience and I've only told a few people what happened. It just makes me sound stupid and crazy so I keep it to myself. But today you inspired me to stop being afraid and to share it. Today I feel a little less alone."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,AfraidToLearn,36,Fri Jul 17 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"OP here.  You're not crazy. I'm seriously overjoyed that I could help, even a little bit.   Now a bit of advice...  I'll say that, although the ""trigger trip"" for my mental issues wasn't nearly as dramatic as yours (that's a hell of a trip, I've got to say), the following derealization dealt with the same exact themes. I felt like I had seen ""beyond the veil"", seen something about the inner workings of reality, and had the impression that something was amiss in this human world. It was pervasive. A day didn't pass when I didn't find myself staring blankly in front of me, overwhelmed by the sheer weight of the fact that anything existed at all, shrinking deeper and deeper into my head, losing emotional contact with the world around me.   Nothing emotionally ""registered"" anymore. I experienced the world as if I were an alien that had just landed on earth and was observing the workings of the world from a detached, scientific perspective. I could look at my old backyard and not experience a hint of familiarity.  I convinced myself that the only way to get out of it was going ""deeper down the rabbit hole"" with the hopes that somewhere in the deep dark abyss was a light at the end of the tunnel if I kept going in that direction. (I was wrong) So I latched on to my derealization, scared of being a coward. Scared that if I shut out all the weirdness around me, I was giving up on enlightenment and spiritual growth. I convinced myself that I was ""onto something"". Might I have been? Possibly. But nothing so useful as to sacrifice my sanity.  This is an analogy that helped me a lot.  During my period of derealization, I felt like I had to transcend being human. Human perspective, with all of its cultural trappings and Earthly concerns, was beneath me. It was an illusion. It was ""the matrix"" and I had gotten out of it. I had taken the red pill, and scary as it may have been, I thought myself better off for it.  And then I realized this.   Not you, not me, not anyone, will ever understand what's going on in this universe in its entirety.   Picture a jazz band. (I would have picked an orchestra, but that would imply a pre-composed symphony, which can raise undesirable questions of free will. Jazz leaves more room for improvisation.) There are guitars, basses, saxophones, trumpets, drums, keyboards, all manner of musical instruments. You're a musician in this band.  What would happen if the percussionist tried to ""transcend"" his part and play the whole piece on the snare drum? That's right. It would fall apart. Or if the keyboardist tried to ""transcend"" her part and play the bass and sax at the same time? Again, it would fall apart.  The best anyone in this band can do is play their own part as damn well as they can, and add their own voice to the music. We're all surrounded by instruments we doesn't know how to play or understand. If we spend all of our time trying to understand everything else, we're missing an opportunity to contribute what we can to the most beautiful symphony ever written.  How does that relate to your issue? Bear with me.  Pretend that there really is an evil conspiracy that must be fought and destroyed (I realize that you're skeptical, but I'm making a point). You have two options:   You can drop a bunch of acid and hope that Morpheus will spontaneously appear in front of you in a dream and offer you a second chance to leave the Matrix and join the resistance. You can realize that you don't know exactly what's going on in a macrocosmic sense (does anyone?), but that in front of you is a world that nobody else but you—not me, not your neighbor, not your father, not your dog—is in a position to understand. This is your realm. This is your part. The instrument is in front of you. If you don't play it, it's going to stay unplayed forever.    If there's something wrong with the music (or reality), fix it from where you are. Play your own instrument better. Make your own world a little more beautiful. It's all you can do.  The world is pretty damn strange. I'll give you that. It can be intimidating. It's true that we see only a sliver of reality. But there are other creatures taking care of that, so you don't have to worry about it. The universe is smart, I think. Getting upset over the smallness of our own little sliver is like getting upset over not being a bear-man-dolphin-extra-terrestrial-buddha-bacteria all at once.   (If it sounds like I'm being condescending, I'm not. I still need to have this conversation with myself daily to keep from being driven crazy by this shit.)  Somewhere out there, there might be beings—physical or spiritual or both (or neither)—that are right at home in those fringes of consciousness that are so terrifying to you and me. Leave dealing with the Lovecraftian horrors to them (if you know Lovecraft you'll get what I mean). That's their realm, and they're doing their job keeping it. All you can do is occupy yours, which is being human.   Do you want more knowledge and understanding? Explore your world. The normal, mundane human one. I know it sounds like stoner philosophy 101, but you know how the universe might be outwardly and inwardly infinite? (What if the universe is, like, one big atom man?) You can go just as deep into studying atoms as you can into studying galaxies. There's a little infinity to be discovered just by looking at what it means to be human. Start here, on ""home atom"". It's what you're best at.  And after you die, who knows? But there's no use thinking about that.   I'm not telling you to pretend that you never saw what you saw. I'm just saying that you have to put it in its place. Someday you might understand it better, but that time isn't now. Now is your time to be human. Worry about the other stuff later.  There are a thousand valid ways to look at the universe, and the Gnostic conspiracy-laden lens is just one of them. Does it have some validity? Sure (I'm one of those folks myself, paranoid guy that I am). But it's not the end-all.  Rant done. Hope it helped at least a little bit."

The main issue for me is that I'm forced to be a contributing member of society. When I do that I have to numb myself just to get through the day. I have to go to work and spend most of the day sitting at a desk, doing things I don't want to do, wishing I was playing in that band. Then when I'm finally released and I go to play jazz it just doesn't feel right. I don't feel free because I know that soon I'll have to go to sleep and start the repetitive cycle all over again. It's maddening.  Not only do I know nothing but I feel like I'm not even allowed the chance to really think about it. I have to do all of these other things to make other people happy before I can even think about myself. And by that time I'm exhausted.  I would love to bust out this jazz solo that's been building in my soul but my producer doesn't want to hear it since it throws off the flow of the album.

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,GregKasarik,16,Sat Jul 18 02:15:05 2015 UTC,"You have discovered the underlying Truth of all sentience, namely that ignorance is the fundamental state of all consciousness.   Irrespective of who communicated this truth to you, it is now up to you to decide what to do with it. The reality is that none of us can ever know what is really going on. No being can ever disprove the Matrix and even those who would claim to be god can never know if they are in fact God.   I've been to a very similar space as yourself. Years ago, I embarked on the path of the Mystic, determined to prove the existence of God and absolute Truth. What I discovered was the exact opposite: Our ignorance is fundamental and inescapable.   From here you have two broad paths ahead of you. You can decide that everything is meaningless, or you can decide that YOU create the meaning in your life and live every day as a testament to the power of your own self over whatever reality that you find yourself within.   One of the issues that you have undoubtedly encountered is that our society and culture (and possibly even our genetic psychological makeup) place meaning as being something external to who we are. When we look for meaning in our lives we do so with the idea that somehow all of it will only make sense if it is somehow connected to the broad advancement of something outside of ourselves. Most often, this outside entity is some sort of group, often orientated towards the metaphysically Transcendent, be it God, a philosophy, or even the idea of Light vs Dark.  The problem is that once the veil is ripped and your own ignorance is revealed, the external motivations for meaning are shown to be false. Firstly, because we can never know if these external sources of meaning are ""real"" in any true sense and secondly, because as you've been shown, our reality is a miniscule fraction of an Infiniverse that we can no more comprehend than an ant can understand how quantum physics relates to the totality of our Universe. Finally, you've also been confronted with the inevitable reality of your own ""death"". To understand that we live in an Infiniverse, is to understand that nothing is permanent and that every story must come to an end, even if, to our perceptions, it is practically Infinite. (Although strictly speaking not all stories end. To any story, you can always add a new tale, so there will always be a few that maintain themselves, even into the depths of Infinity, although they will be very rare indeed.)  In being confronted with the destruction of our external sources of meaning, it is very easy to fall into depression, because it seems to follow that if everything is transient and nothing lasts, then it must be that nothing has any real meaning. Such thinking promotes the false idea that equates the idea of permanence with purpose.   For many people, loosing these external frames of validation and purpose is like being lost in the middle of an ocean in a sailboat without a rudder. Not only are there no landmarks, but every direction seems to be the same and our journey is dictated by currents and winds beyond our control.   But this is not the case! Rather than looking for external validation of your meaning and purpose, you need to be looking inside, because true meaning is only found through understanding one's own path through Eternity. Who are you? What do you represent? What are you prepared to fight for?  Because even if all our lives are nothing more than frail houses of cards built on ego and ignorance, the reality is that we all have the ability to chose our path through this life and choosing the path isn't something that we do based on long term strategies, or likely success, but rather on a focused decision of who it is that we choose to be and how we chose to frame our existence.   During your experience, you were told that ""everything is a lie"". But if you think about it, if ignorance is our fundamental trait, how could anything be a ""lie""? Because for it to be a ""lie"" someone would have to know the truth of the matter, but if even god can't know if god is God, the idea of ""lies"" makes no more sense than the idea of ""truth"".  Everything just ""IS"". Your experience from moment to moment is as real as, or more real than anything else in the Infiniverse. So, irrespective of what is going on, your experience isn't a lie. Your experience is reality and so to is your choice of how to respond to that reality.   Sure, you may be in a Matrix. You might even be a story book character. But so what? In an Infiniverse, every logically and mathematically possible experience does in fact exist. So, you are both of these things as well as an infinite number beyond comprehension. The experience of your life is like a mathematical equation inside brackets that can be dumped inside an infinite number of other equations without detracting, or changing the reality and validity of your own experience.   So, accept the reality of your own experience and take the opportunity to define who you are and what journey you wish to be on throughout eternity. Find your meaning in the moment. In the smile of a loved one. In the joy of giving to another. In the knowledge that your life adds so much more to the lives of others.   For myself, years ago, I decided to ""be one of the happy ones"". I figured that irrespective of how long I have, be it 2 minutes, 2 millennia, or 2 eternities, if I have to be here, I'm going to be happy and joyous, even when circumstances seem to dictate otherwise. Over the course of a number of years I developed a number of exercises to allow me to bring happiness into my life whenever I chose and while on occasion I still battle depression, I know where my ultimate path is leading and am much more easily able to recognise my sadness as a necessary part of my journey.   Similarly, I have more recently decided that I also aspire to be an Avatar of Light (although I really have no idea of what that means).   Making this choice (and your choices don't have to mirror mine) will have a dramatic impact on your life. Whereas up until now you have felt like the sailboat without a rudder, choosing a path will immediately put a rudder on your boat and allow you to start moving in the direction that you want to go. Even if the winds are against you, you can still ""tack"" in the direction that makes sense to you.   Once you stick on that rudder and make a commitment to your path, the world becomes a much easier place to navigate. Whereas previously, you had no idea of where you were going to end up, now you do. In fact, not only will you know what your path is, but the very fact that you know, whereas other's don't will inspire those around you to make their own choices (even if they don't realise it), as they are forced to confront the certainty that you will carry within you.  You may be afraid that you will choose the ""wrong"" path, but don't be. The path that you choose will be the path that you need to be on. For better, or worse, each path has its own rewards. After many years of depression and hopelessness, you may be afraid that your path is one of Darkness with little hope.   But the great thing about the Light, is that it loves stories of transformation and renewal. Indeed, it is precisely from where you are now, that many of the Light's most ardent supporters have come, because it is only through having experienced the Darkness that you can ever truly know that you are destined for the Light.   Indeed, if your initial experience was triggered by an aspect of Darkness, it may very well be because you have the power within you to become an exemplar of the Light. Raising Darkness into the Light and smothering the Light in Darkness are things that keep avatars of each side entertained for seeming eternities. It all might seem very comic book, but what else do we have to do to keep ourselves entertained throughout eternity?  And even once you've made that choice, life will still keep on testing you and throwing challenges at you that will allow you to keep on making that choice every day of your life. In fact, you'll very quickly discover that you haven't made a single ""choice"" as such, but embarked on an exciting journey, of self creation, in which every moment of your life is an opportunity to tease out which path through the Infinite is yours and yours alone! :-)   Of course, this all comes with the standard disclaimer, that I could just be full of shit and not really have a clue about anything that I am talking about. Which all goes to show that Ignorance can be quite entertaining and uplifting once you get used to the idea! ;-)"

Love the quote. I felt like it took me an entire incarnation to read this post but it was well worth it and entertaining. But really, being nothing probably sucks ass, so manifesting on opposite sides of the spectrum and alternatively killing each other and loving each other at least keeps the mind occupied. What a terrible, incomprehensible dread would it be to be a single entity, the sole God of the Infiniverse, and know that you were completely alone. I would probably prefer to shard into a trillion different pieces of consciousness, too! :) Cheers, brother."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,GregKasarik,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:27:21 2015 UTC,"Glad I was able to educate and entertain. And yes, I do tend to get carried away with what I write. Simply too much going on in my head! :-)  Very few have any empathy for the plight of the Divine, especially for any Omniscient entity, whose consciousness entails the consciousness of every other mathematically, and logically possible sentience. Light and Dark; all of it crammed into the one mind. So it isn't just incomprehensible dread, it is also incomprehensible optimism and joy. Swings and roundabouts. Every path, has its rewards, but I'm glad that it isn't me.   In all honesty I doubt that many people are really ready to step into the world that AfraidToLearn described.   I go there, because it is part of who I am. Even so, when launch my consciousness into this level of the Divine awareness, I sometimes feel like Icarus and I have to remind myself out loud that I am one of the ""sane ones"". This is despite being way less neurotic than the general population.   It is quite a few pay grades above anything that mere mortals like us are equipped to handle! :-)"

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,GregKasarik,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:32:50 2015 UTC,"Usually large doses (5-6 tabs) of LSD, or magic mushrooms. I'll often throw a bit of Nitrous into the mix as well.   Intent is key to the experience, so I can slip into a similar state through meditation that focuses on the experience itself. Even writing the above breifly facilitated a shift of consciousness into those aspects of the Divine.   It has taken me nearly ten years of gradual buildup, experience and journeying to learn the skills and gain the confidence that I need in order to stay safe in those realms, so I certainly don't recommend this for beginners! :-)"

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,the_str,28,Sun Jul 19 07:08:33 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a really difficult experience. It's good that you're sharing it around people who can understand. Have you heard the saying ""Depression is just anger turned inwards""? The saying doesn't capture it entirely, as there's usually something chemical going on, but there's emotional truth to it. It's okay to be mad at the world, and angry with reality for feeling false. It's not cowardly to refuse a plunge into knowledge. You were just showing loving protection for the life you live. Why fight some mysterious force about nothing, when the more important thing is here at home? Sometimes we go searching for vast universal truths or conspiracies because we're afraid of dealing with the present, the personal relationships we have, the choices we have to make. A lot of it comes from fear that we'll be rejected by the world around us, or we'll fail someone we love. But if you untie all those knots, there's love at the center. The beautiful thing is that you are trying. People try in a lot of different ways. Talking to family, seeing a psychiatrist, expressing themselves through art. There's nowhere to go and no knowledge to gain. At least, nothing as important as the knowledge that we are here together."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,AfraidToLearn,11,Fri Jul 17 21:33:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this, it's so hard to see it in a different light because it's been a part of my life for a while now. This is a great way to view the whole ordeal."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,penguinv,6,Fri Jul 17 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"I would talk to the force and ask that force about kindness, about how to change things, about what will happen to others. Put it to the test.  Ask about its relation to other forces you know.   I'm not saying that you ""should"" have done it because you ""should"" have done what you did. Really so. I'm saying you could do it now. And I don't mean you have to trip (assuming it was LSD). It might help to smoke though it depends on the herb.  Edit addition. You can. You can get quiet inside and ask. (This might be helpful -not obviously connected books by Richard Bandler or Steve/Connie Andreas. http://steveandreas.com/ which include talk about talking with your ""parts"". I am suggesting talking with this man (or force or spirit or ""alien"" - the speaker in a man-form you saw) and asking questions and get answers. Or ask God. Or your inner guide. This ability can develop over time too.)"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,helpful_hank,15,Sat Jul 18 04:37:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you're a coward for turning him down; I think he was offering you another step in the ""eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil"" direction, which is what got Adam and Eve thrown out of paradise. There is knowledge that removes your innocence, your ability to love things and value things for their own sake. This is destructive to the soul.  This I would suspect is why you felt like you'd done something wrong just by talking to him. Be glad you didn't take that offer -- proud, even. It may have been a temptation."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,AfraidToLearn,16,Fri Jul 17 21:41:30 2015 UTC,"So I didn't want to bring the whole good vs evil duality into it in fear of coming off as having gone ever farther off the deep end but that is exactly how it went down. This man was at war against the powers of the universe and there was just something about him that felt so untrustworthy and I couldn't shake it. The whole time I couldn't stop thinking that this was actually the devil. It was the only thing I had to relate it to. And that's really what made me afraid. It's like I was being tested and I felt powerless. What on earth did I do to deserve a one on one chat with Satan?  The ensuing depression made me question whether or not I made the right choice but maybe you're right. It's not a choice your average person has to even think about making. Whether or not it was the correct choice doesn't even really matter, I still at least made a choice, I survived the depression, I'm still here and I'm still trying. That I can be proud of."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Jack41096,9,Fri Jul 17 22:05:49 2015 UTC,"as a former Christian and a now neo-pagan who still believes that satan exists in one firm or another, anyone can have a chat with him. he doesn't care to take time out of his immorality to speak with you. he is the embodiment of short term gains for long term losses on the soul. you aren't supposed to have access to what he tries to give you but he feels as if humanity is ready for it.   he will lead you toward soul destruction because he doesn't know moral limits. we will eventually be ready but that day is not today. the truth is cold and unloving because we do not know how to comprehend it.   shitty analogy, but if you showed a caveman transformers in imax, his mind would likely implode. it would be unlike anything he has imagined in his wildest dreams."

I'm not saying you should follow that. It could be bad for your sanity at least. Though, this reality is quite fucked up, and the Bible makes the assumption Satan is evil questionable. God killed a lot more people and sends some people and other beings into eternal hell. Satan has done far less hurtful stuff in the Bible."

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,AfraidToLearn,2,Sat Jul 18 14:04:53 2015 UTC,"Just the idea of Hell makes the Christian God an unjust God in my eyes, we even know ourselves that negative reinforcement doesn't work. Punishing anyone for eternity, including the most despicable people you can imagine, just doesn't seem like a plausible structure for existence. It's why I don't believe in any of it.  The man I met was less concerned with good and evil as we know them and more with order and chaos. Should you follow the soul development path that's been laid out for you or do you just say screw it I'm choosing my own path just to see where it leads? Are you really you if you're following the guidelines of some other entity?"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,north_america_sucks,2,Sun Jul 19 15:36:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that Hell makes the Christian God seem ridiculous.  The idea of order vs. chaos reminds me of something. This world consists of creation and destruction, pleasure and pain, and so on. Most people seek the positive side, some to such extent that it almost seems delusional, pretending the negatives don't exist. It can also be limiting, due to fear of the negatives. There's also another drive, to purely experience reality, including the pain and other negatives. This seems more common in psychonauts."

I can't find enough new things to do to distract my mind from the fact that I know nothing and I'm doing nothing about it.""   Sounds to me like you're going through an existential crisis. I definitely went through one, but not because of shrooms. I would recommend reading and contemplating ""The Absurd"" by the philosopher Thomas Nagel. This article alone literally changed my life and maybe it will help you overcome this pessimistic bout you are going through.   ""If... there is no reason to believe that anything matters, then that doesn't matter either, and we can approach our absurd lives with irony instead of heroism or despair""  https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/The%20Absurd%20-%20Thomas%20Nagel.pdf  In the long run, it seems to me that sometimes epiphanies like this are for the better and improve us as people, if we can manage to navigate them well. I really wish you the best of luck."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,AfraidToLearn,2,Sat Jul 18 06:00:09 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks for the recommendation! I actually just last week started looking into the absurd so it's brand new to me and this is very good timing.  I read a little about Albert Camus and ended up ordering a few books which just showed up and I'm going to start. I don't know anything about Nagel though so I'm very interested now. I'm currently on vacation with the family which is always hectic but the first chance I get to read this I'm going to.

I don't know if psychedelics were involved, but this man said that when he was 11 years old he was visited by a woman. She was other-worldly and told him that he had been chosen. I don't know if he had the choice to reject it, but he said that once you start there's not going back. He said they he lived over 10 years of his life in a depressed state, not knowing what to do with his newfound knowledge or abilities. He said it was difficult and life altering. That he learned so much. He said that in a past life he did something that broke the universal code and was punished by having to live for 400 years as a tree. He said that he could see so much more than we (normal people) could, include energies. He was trying to recruit someone else (my boyfriend at the time) to agree to join him. But he declined. I remained fascinated and dwelled on it for weeks after I heard his story. Even after 9 years this story is fresh in my mind...  For a while I was envious that I wasn't chosen. But in retrospect I don't think I would be able to handle it. I'm not ready to give up the life I know. And I think that anyone who does go to the other side has taken on an immense power and responsibility which most of us aren't prepared to wield."

I don't know who to verbalize it, but it was like the recess of my mind was telling me my trip, my life, my future, my mind, it could all go down 2 separate paths and then I got scared and I chose the wrong one. I was RIGHT ON the verge of ego death and I was afraid to take the jump. And then I just got this horrible feeling deep down in the pit of my stomach and I threw up all over the lawn. And then that psychosis I mentioned in my other comment started to kick in. It was horrible. If I could go back and change it all I would have rode the waves. Psychonauts, when you get a chance, eat the red pill. Not many people get the opportunity and at that point you're going to regret something no matter what choice you make honestly. You'll either experience ego death and gain a new found love for humanity and our planet but possibly damage your sense of self, or you'll be a coward and regret never looking past the veil."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,23knives,2,Sat Jul 18 07:48:22 2015 UTC,"""Fear and anxiety had ruled my entire life up to that point and I had completely failed at a chance to beat it.""  that line is a powerful one. one that i went over a few times. i can absolutely relate. it'd be nice if it instead went: ""Fear and anxiety had ruled my entire life up to that point and I [...] beat it.""  i wouldn't write any of your experience off as ""most likely all in my head"" or ""crazy"". reality is a matter of perspective. when you're on psychedelics, you're using your brain differently. you're engaging with reality differently. your perception of energy is enhanced. you're tapping into the unknown. who are you to say that the unknown is all in your head, simply because your body is the beacon of your human experience in the phenomenal world? what if reality extends beyond our bodies?  i had a wildly aggressive double-dose into lysergia. my eyes were no longer what perceived my reality. i had to shut them, because they were so distracting. everything i saw from them was worthless in the sense that it wasn't real (the living room i was in, my friends' bodies, the walls, flooring, couches, computer, etc). it looked like it had all been fabricated, much like a scene from a video game where i could press pause just by closing my eyes (for the record, not a gamer). i was left in the nominal world. i could only see from within my mind. it was all black or dark blue, and there was nothing more than a ball in the center. i think it was a blue ball, if not red... the trip was so traumatic, i'm sure i suffered PTSD for awhile and it's made the trip sort of blurry to me now. i was fucked. i remember thinking: ""i'm gonna be a vegetable, my dad is going to have to look after me for the rest of my life"". admittedly, at the time, i was going through some very difficult shit. amidst the mental chaos and inner turmoil of my trip, i remember thinking: ""i may not love my life, but i do love my existence"". it was interesting to be able to separate ""life"" from ""existence"" for a moment. my friend, seeing me in distress, kindly gave me his moleskin notebook with a pen, before he left to go back to the park, and told me to write in it if i wanted to. i wrote one thing only: ""my flesh is the absolute confirmation of my existence. however, if that flesh is no longer my own understanding of what is real..."". that's it.  Immanuel Kant divided the world into two portions: the nominal (real and intelligible) and phenomenal (world of appearances).  it's outer-space vs. inner-space. in terms of outer-space, it is much more tangible and explicit, but it still starts with you. your mind, your body, your home, your city, your province/state, your country, our planet, solar system, solar interstellar neighbourhood, milky way galaxy, local galactic group, virgo supercluster, local superclusters, the observable universe, and there's talks of a multiverse ffs. everything is scalable. considering how far out the universe extends, it must extend equally as deep within. we are merely humans, we can't understand everything. there are energies and spirits at work though. i've been researching ayahuasca pretty diligently lately, and apparently people can experience the same trip and see the same things in some cases. a furthering of the notion that it's not all just in your head."

(I was seeking some guidance) So do I know what I'm talking about ehh, not really, but I try to absorb the positive wisdom and guidance provided here. When you say you don't get how people get absorbed in mundane shit well, it's an unfortunate reality but some don't really ponder much or they just don't know about certain substances that can throw a new perspective to their life. Some people do care though. I mean science has explained quite a lot in the few centuries it's been really grasped and worked on. Imagine what 50 more years will yield to! Call me delusional but I have ""faith"" in the beauty of science and the wonders that spirituality brings to ""this""! I feel like If we made it this far by some fucking miracle, then we can keep going and poking around seeing how this all works. Like Tyson says we are the universe experiencing itself. If we are here then there must be an answer to the origin of the universe because it happened. Again unfortunately or fortunately we are here, in whatever this is, who the fuck knows why or how, but that's just whats in front of us. We as humans can experience love and happiness. (What sucks is dealing with the negative fucked up shit) I have far to go and that's one thing that drives me to still care which is the fun mind fuck of what it means to be a human. We are so lucky to experience love so that's cool. When it comes to exploring our mind/universe I'd say we don't lose anything by trying. (Again I might be spewing BS) For now I ""guess"" it might work out to just be kind to others, don't be major cunt and don't beat yourself up, expecially for feeling like you did the wrong thing in your trip. I would say to ""whomever"" you dealt with they should have been compassionate instead of being fucking harsh, which is a pussy move since everyone can be a cunt. Love whenever possible. Yeah you're right this shit is weird, there's so many theories and opinions about what life is. Keep exercising your mind and body. And learn to accept (or not) whatever frequencies surround you.

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,namelessidea,12,Fri Jul 17 17:55:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through that. My period of derealization was the most difficult time of my life and I know how hard it can be. I'm glad that you appreciated the post though. :)   Best of luck, my friend."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,AustinFoShoYo,15,Fri Jul 17 18:05:42 2015 UTC,Really glad you raised this - a very good point.  Currently suffering anxiety/derealization/depression.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Sentazar,7,Fri Jul 17 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"As a fellow DP/DR sufferer a tip that I've found useful is that when you have an especially bad episode start listing 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can smell, 2 things you can feel and 1 positive thing about yourself. It helps me and I hope that it might help you."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,JoshTheDerp,3,Sat Jul 18 02:00:39 2015 UTC,IM wondering if my sudden anxiety is due to this.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,j4x0l4n73rn,27,Fri Jul 17 19:07:17 2015 UTC,"Since one of my bad mushroom trips, I think I might be suffering from derealization. I feel like if my reality might not even be real and the rreal reality I belong in some kind of underworld. Occasionally when I smoke too much cannabis those thoughts come back to me and I sometimes feel like I start to slip out.   Rationally I know it is all just delusion, but still can't shake the feeling. Scary."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,j4x0l4n73rn,14,Fri Jul 17 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"The other replies here seem to be dodging the fact that you have a mental illness. I've been struggling with derealization for a few years, and had the experience increase in intensity and frequency after a bad acid trip.  I had been panicked about what I was experiencing until I found out the name for it, and learned more about it. Especially after the trip, the length of less intense episodes increased so I could be derealized for the majority of a week. I know I lost days on autopilot, and the new outlook on life it gave me was terrifying but thrilling. Only recently have I noticed that I get less intense and frequent episodes.  To the other commenters who say that life actually isn't real, or that it's actually a dream: you probably don't understand much about the nature of this illness, so I will give you some advice and insight.   Do not tell someone who has/might have derealization that the world is not real. Would you tell someone with suicidal depression that their self is an illusion so there's no difference in meaning between life and death?  No, because that's a dick move.  Don't send people with DR those posts about the reader being in a coma, and that it's a message they're getting from the real world or their subconscious.  Just don't do it. It doesn't matter if that's what you actually believe. You are making real life play into the specific delusions of someone's mental illness. That kind of thing can be a very effective trigger, causing episodes of derealization.  These other comments are not in the spirit of the original post at all! If someone says they have a mental illness, don't, DO NOT talk about it until you've educated yourself on it."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,j4x0l4n73rn,7,Sat Jul 18 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"THIS.  Thank you sir, for pointing out the obvious. Thank you very much. :)  No offense intended to the others. Philosophizing about the nature of reality is a great thing, and I'm glad to say that all my pondering during my period of derealization has made me a better ""metaphysicist"" (did I just coin a word?).   But as someone whose gone through this, I've found that it gets you no where if you're trying to get back in touch with everyday reality. Philosophy can be supplemental, if can give you that extra justification for why returning to normal is a good thing, but it won't get you out of the woods.  What I recommend is mindfulness.   Realize what's going on. When you have a thought like ""nothing is real"" and feel the accompanying anxiety, realize what triggered it.  Thoughts (ex. ""nothing is real"") --> Reaction (ex. ""I don't like that idea"") --> Anxiety (ex. ""oh no! I'm going to have more derealization!"") --> Derealization  You have to break this cycle the one place that you can. THE REACTION.  How can you do that? Talk to the thought. Say ""hi, how do you do?"" Don't try to combat it. Don't argue with it. Just recognize it for what it is. A thought, no better or worse than any other. Acknowledge it and move on. You'll find that by fighting the thoughts, you give them power over you. This takes practice, but eventually you'll get the hang of it.  Something else...  You probably find yourself self-monitoring, always asking yourself ""am I getting better/worse?"" This creates anxiety. Catch yourself doing it, and *realize what's going on"". Don't try to suppress your self-monitoring thoughts. That's impossible (don't think of pink elephants either...see? you just thought of them). Just realize what's happening, and that alone puts you back in power."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,MrValdov,3,Sat Jul 18 03:41:51 2015 UTC,"Your post got me all fired up. It just seemed really insensitive, like they didn't even read their comment. Or they read it and dismissed it.  I love this place, but for a subreddit that champions psychedelics as bleach for the ego, /r/psychonauts has kind of a collective ego built on the purity and goodness of psychedelics. Sometimes you have to admit there are serious negative consequences."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,GregKasarik,4,Sat Jul 18 03:53:01 2015 UTC,"Wait, was I the insensitive one? I just want to make sure so I can fix it if I was. A tad bit confused."

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,penguinv,2,Sat Jul 18 04:06:18 2015 UTC,Underrated post. Sound advice.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,aManOfTheNorth,2,Sat Jul 18 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"I think that you've hit the nail quite nicely here.   There is a difference between the philosophical contention that the lives that we lead are somehow ""not real"" and the subjective experience of DR, which is akin to living your life as if you were an avatar on a computer game console.   The difference here is that even if we are living in a Matrix, the experience of the world for most of us is as vivid and ""real"" as we could ever imagine it to be. In fact it is so real, that we'd never have the courage to test our theories, because we know damned well that if we are wrong, it is game over for us.   For a person suffering from DR, the world doesn't seem real and hopefully those of even marginal imaginative capacity can see how this this can present all sorts of dangers.  To JoshTheDerp, I'd encourage you to stop with the cannabis for a while and seek some assistance from a mental health professional. Given what you've said, in all likelihood, what you are experiencing is transitory and with a bit of assistance, you'll be able to step back into reality as the rest of us know it."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Sherlockian_Holmes,7,Sat Jul 18 05:29:46 2015 UTC,"What I have found on acid is there are many layers of ""reality"" that are available to us right under our noses. It was really bizarre. I was fine, no hallucinations, no visuals. Everything was exactly the same as before the trip started but at the same time it wasn't. I felt as if I had elevated to a new dimension of being.  That ""underworld"" you feel you belong to might just be one of those layers that is missing from your everyday life."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,penguinv,15,Fri Jul 17 22:49:18 2015 UTC,"Rationally I know it is all just delusion, but still can't shake the feeling. Scary.    It's not a delusion.  This world here is a dream. :)  However, you don't belong to some underworld.  Your home is not among any relative planes of existence.  You are that which can experience, know, and will.  And that capacity for experiencing, knowing and willing is both you and your home.  Nothing else.  Everything you experience is only a guest in your being.  It's here now, gone tomorrow.  But you'll be here to see it all go, and you'll be here to welcome the new world again, where they'll tell you all kinds of bullshit like how you were ""born"" and such, when in fact you were never born and will never die.  How's that?  Scary?"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,JoshTheDerp,3,Fri Jul 17 22:42:01 2015 UTC,I find it nice and grounding. Thanks.  Even if the way I would describe is different.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,penguinv,5,Sat Jul 18 04:54:43 2015 UTC,Reality not being real is the tenant of quantum physics these days.  So to think that is destabilizing because it's true.  So what's to do?  Carry on with a song.  Set your hand on your heart beat.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,XxWhathesnazzxX,2,Fri Jul 17 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"""The Vedas cannot show you Brahman, you are That already. They can only help to take away the veil that hides truth from our eyes. The cessation of ignorance can only come when I know that God and I are one; in other words, identify yourself with Atman, not with human limitations. The idea that we are bound is only an illusion [Maya]. Freedom is inseparable from the nature of the Atman. This is ever pure, ever perfect, ever unchangeable."" - Swami Vivekananda  Now that you realized that everything is an illusion, you need to meditate on this idea to truly understand the message that was being conveyed to you. This is one of the problems of psychedelics; they are like a rocket that peeks directly through the veil, while meditation is like setting up a gentle sail and slowly going through the motions necessary (emotional growth, insight, attention, etc.) in order to truly understand the lessons being taught.   There's a reason that psychedelics were used as entheogens (look up the meaning if you do not know it) under controlled circumstances. They are incredibly powerful 'mind-breakers'; catapulting you into emotional and mental spheres of existence; some heavenly, others hellish. As above, so below.   Recognize the call in you to realize the true nature of things, and begin investigation. If you don't, you can try running away from your derealization (""realizing the unreality of existence; Maya itself"") and dull your pain away, or you can delve deep into the mind itself and tame it, using insight and concentrated effort over time; taking your time to really digest every experience and internalize it.   I can suggest reading A Path With A Heart by Jack Kornfield. While it describes the Buddhist path, know that there are many paths that eventually lead to the same place; choose a Path that speaks to you. You have infinite wisdom inside you. All you need is to open the vessel and let it flow."

Seriously my answer needs more context. Did you read that and not understand?  Source. Your internal wisdom. God. Your higher power. Spirit. Your great-great-grandmother.   Source.

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,higgs8,10,Tue Jul 21 01:42:37 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. Well said.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,helpful_hank,7,Fri Jul 17 17:49:24 2015 UTC,"I have HPPD. It usually isn't bad, but I get episodes where I completely space out and forget my life for a second.  It's tough, but I get through it as best I can. Overall I believe that psychedelics have had a positive impact on my life. I've noticed that I'm quieter than I used to be before my experiences, except when I'm stoned.  Do you know of any resources for people that have had trouble after coming back from a journey? I've thought about getting a therapist, but would they be able to help beyond the ""don't do drugs"" angle?"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,inahst,6,Fri Jul 17 18:37:22 2015 UTC,"I can't really tell you about any resources, because I worked toward resolving the derealization myself.   What I can say, though, is this.  Many therapists are pretty liberal and open-minded people, and are at least familiar enough with psychs to approach them from a non-judgmental stance. A psychologist my friend was seeing talked openly with him about her own experience with psychedelics and gave him tripping advice, if that says anything. (He was seeing her for issues not related to drugs, however)   I'm not really familiar with HPPD treatments though...  I might be able to give some advice, but I can't really decide whether I've had flashbacks or not. I've definitely had moments where something psychedelic was happening, but I can't really say it felt exactly like the trip that triggered my problems. And no hallucinations either (probably because I don't hallucinate much to begin with, and I've done mostly low doses). It's just...feeling suddenly distant from everything and the whole world becoming eerily strange and alien.   Are there certain triggers that precede your flashbacks?"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,higgs8,4,Fri Jul 17 18:56:22 2015 UTC,"You say you had derealization, which I think I had before trying psychedelics, but I'm not sure if this is it. It's like the world constantly feels less vivid and less ""real"", and I feel less involved with the world, a bit like being numb or drunk but perfectly capable of functioning but with less motivation. During a trip, it's the opposite: everything feels very real and colorful, motivation is easy and experiences are powerful. Is this what you had?  Either way, I was wondering what derealization may be, and maybe it's not a ""problem"", it may be a more ""true"" state than the normal state. Let me explain. The thing is, psychedelics can show you that the world we take for real isn't as real as we believe - that there is something way more real beyond it - the true, eternal self. So once you understand this during a trip (perhaps without conscious understanding) and return from the trip, you can no longer see the world as ""real"" any more? Because simply the world never was real to begin with, only thanks to a psychedelic insight, you now know this and can't shake that knowledge?  Perhaps the trouble with derealization is not derealization itself, it's the fact that we return to a world where everyone (including ourselves) says that the world is totally real yet we don't perceive it as such, and there is a conflict between our perception and our knowledge. Of which our perception may be the true one, but we just don't realize this yet.  Just a theory based on personal experience, though again, since I may not have had derealization at all, I'm not sure."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,inahst,3,Fri Jul 17 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"""Where ignorance is bliss, tis folly to be wise.""  There are some ways in which not being aware is helpful to us, especially depending on what level we're at. Just like you don't want to be aware of what-exactly-are-my-hands-doing while you're trying to chat up a girl, you don't always want to be aware of the infinite permeability this universe while still trying to build a life in it.  Along these lines, grounding is important.  My two cents."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,ponylies,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:35:32 2015 UTC,"I have always wondered how this ""focusing of attention"" works. There is attention, which can be ""focused"" onto anything - within the body, within a specific part of the mind, or within the external world. Psychedelics seem to make this focusing more pronounced and easier. You can look at a cloud with almost all of your attention and forget everything else, but see the cloud in huge detail. What causes the focusing itself? Is it my ""free will"", or does attention automatically get focused on whatever is ""louder"" (such as pain or intense pleasure)?"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,symzvius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:09:32 2015 UTC,"These are good questions, I'm interested in this too. I'm pretty sure (aside from 'free will' and whatever is involved with that) pain contracts (focuses) attention and pleasure expands (relaxes) attention. Like heat and cold."

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,GregKasarik,2,Sat Jul 18 13:02:59 2015 UTC,"Fortunately since psychedelics it has almost entirely gone away so now I'm fine, but as you say it may have been depression rather than derealization..."

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,ventus99,7,Fri Jul 17 21:45:33 2015 UTC,"I wish there was a test or questionnaire or something online that you could take to see if you are mentally prepared to take psychedelics. I think I can take them and deal with it, but I really don't know, and I'm kind of afraid to test the waters."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,krongi,12,Fri Jul 17 19:57:24 2015 UTC,That much critical thought put into the decision itself leads me to believe that you are ready.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,funks,5,Fri Jul 17 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give you is this: don't go in with expectations.   Tripping for the first time will not be what you expect, no matter what. It may be harder, easier, stranger, more familiar, scarier, funnier than what you think it will be like. You don't know until it happens.  So don't go in looking for one thing in particular. Just go in, prepared to learn something, and you will.  Realize that, no matter how open minded or philosophical you are, your worldview and framework for understanding reality may be ripped away, dismantled, and put back together again as something you weren't ready for.  If you're the type to overthink and philosophize about things, realize that this will make it trippier and possibly more challenging, because you're taking it seriously rather than just having fun. My advice? Don't try to figure out what's happening to you, especially during the trip. Just realize that it's happening, and it will end. You did not take the ""red pill"". You will not be like this forever. It will be ok.   Good luck!"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,funks,3,Sat Jul 18 02:29:52 2015 UTC,"The key things to bear in mind are Dose, Set and Setting.   For a new tripper, the most important of these would have to be dose. If you haven't tripped before, I'd suggest that you take only a threshold dose, so that you are having enough to just experience an effect, but not so much as to be actually tripping. Its a bit like having a glass of shandy, because even if you are unduly sensitive (I have a friend who never takes more than a quarter of a tab of LSD), you can be confident that you will be safe and as such, you will have no undue cause for concern, or anxiety going into the trip.   This allows you to see how you respond to what you are feeling and whether you want to go in deeper. Even if you are feeling some anxiety at a low dose (or any subsequent dose), you can always acclimatise yourself to it, simply by taking the same dose on several occasions. After a short space, you'll suddenly realise that you are cool with things and at that point you can up the dose.   One of the major problems that I routinely encounter with people is that they lack patience and forget that exploring your own consciousness isn't either a race, or a pissing contest. Because of this, many people end up taking too much too soon and inevitably freak out, ruining the whole journey for themselves.   Far better to pace yourself, so that by the time you are getting into the deeply Transcendent territory, you are confident of your ability to manage and understand that there isn't anything that your mind can throw at you that you can't handle.   When I first started on this journey, I took four mushrooms, which was a threshold dose. I had an absolute blast and have never looked back, or regretted my decision. These days, I take 5-6 tabs of LSD, but it has taken me nearly ten years to build up to those kinds of doses and it was about two years before I even progressed past one.  The beauty of psychedelics is that there is much to be learnt, even on very low doses. If you are patient and self aware, you'll realise when you are ready for a higher dose, so if you let it, the progression to higher doses will be a natural part of your journey. In my experience more than 90% of people never go more than one tab of LSD and very few go past two.  Similarly, if you find that you are having difficulties at a dose that you were previously comfortable with, it is highly advised to back the dosage down a bit, so that you are able to let go of the anxiety and reconnect with the joy of the journey. Once you've done this and regained your confidence, you can easily step back up to the higher dose if you are comfortable doing so.   I talk about many of these issues on my old website's ""Beginners Guide to Safe Tripping"".   http://kasarik.com/Beginners-Guide-to-Safe-Tripping.php"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,bobdylan401,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:50:41 2015 UTC,"Well one of the most influential and safe things you can do is know your dose and don't take big doses when you first start out.  The dose is one of those foundational things that decides your trip.  The trip may seem out of this world, but it is brought on my material drugs."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,CosmicAnxiety,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"Probably. No one is ever sure how their mind and body will react. You really just have to make the decision for yourself. Just remember that they will either take you to heaven or hell. Please remember that. You obviously won't want to be contemplating something this frightening while you're tripping and I'm not trying to scare you, just think about that before you try them, then make a final decision for yourself and don't let anyone pressure you into it."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,SeptemberDread,6,Sat Jul 18 07:56:06 2015 UTC,I had a bad trip that triggered my inner anxiety and also gave me DR/DP for about 2 years. It's a terrible experience because for all purposes your mind is lost and wandering. When and if you finally find your path home you look back and are thankful for everything that has ever happened to you. It's not something I would wish on even my worst enemy but at the same time it expands your mind even further.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,DranoTheCat,6,Fri Jul 17 20:20:22 2015 UTC,"So much this. I've become significantly more quiet after a certain point. I've never had a 'bad' trip but I feel like something is off now. I wouldn't take back a single experience I've had but sometimes I feel like I came back without something. Sometimes I think I go back to look for it. Regardless, my situation is incredibly mild compared to others and I'm glad I'm as whole as I am. Great read OP"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,plurwolf7,7,Fri Jul 17 20:54:54 2015 UTC,I just want to say to anyone who feels like they're struggling from any existential anxiety / depersonalization / derealization stemming from any psychedelic experience - PLEASE take time to be sober and reflect on your relationship with chemicals.  I kept smoking pot for about a year after experiencing this and it only made things worse. Please give your brain a break and let things even back out - I promise you will feel better.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,EpicPoptartPuma,3,Sat Jul 18 04:14:37 2015 UTC,"Good point. During my derealization, pot had a tendency to make it worse and drive me deeper into my head. Now I can smoke with relative comfort, but during the worst of it I wasn't doing myself any favors by lighting up."

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Nefandi,5,Sat Jul 18 02:03:10 2015 UTC,"Can someone please explain what HPPD and derealization is?  A few weeks ago I went through the most intense, unimaginable experience of my entire life after what I thought was one acid tab.  I have never in my life tripped so hard and at times I thought I wouldn't be able to come back from wherever I went. I've had extreme anxiety and have woken up crying multiple times since and I don't know where to turn.  I've taken acid multiple times before and never in my life went through what I did a few weeks ago and since its been making me question my sanity and everything else. My dreams are becoming way too intense and I wake up with my heart just pounding. I haven't made a post about what happened yet because I don't know where to start. I took one tab and tripped for 30 fucking hours. And then some after I was finally able to get a few hours of rest. I didn't even think it possible to see what I saw but I did, everything was so genuine and beautiful at the same time but I also saw visions of myself dying, I was incoherent for hours at a time and literally saw through the eyes of the mad. I couldn't string 2 single words together. I just really am trying to reach out because I don't know who I can talk to and am praying there is someone else out there I can relate too. A few friends of mine suggested trying to seek out a shaman but I wouldn't even know where to find one... I just don't know what to do."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Nefandi,3,Sat Jul 18 08:39:16 2015 UTC,Hppd : seeing patterns or tracers long after the drug has left the system.   De realisation : life no longer feeling as real as it used to. The comment above yours is a pretty good example
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Nefandi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:28:44 2015 UTC,"If your friends can understand and listen, empathize and give feedback/advice on some of the deeper issues that might be lingering and bothering you, then THEY are your shamans.  You can do a lot of things to get yourself back to a comfortable position mentally.  A lot of it is time and reflection.  My favorite is concentration on love and empathy toward others.  ""Reality"" is like a comfort blanket, but sometimes you go far enough you realize it's relative.  This can hurt but it helps a lot if you can hold on and let the relativity of thought flow.  Sorry if that doesn't make sense, but I hope it starts a thought.  I went through a lot of what you're talking about, and can relate to the anxiety and feeling of not having a solid footing.  For me, reason and logic brought me back to a place that I could rely on.  It's almost like experiencing 0G for the first time, there isn't a reference point like we're used to (up, down, left, right...they all become relative).  The overwhelming input can cause panic (that flight/fight mechanism we have when we're in a dangerous situation).  I was dislodged from day2day reality because I couldn't shake the difficulty of realizing that there was so much else out there.  Almost an inhuman feeling.  Years after taking lots of psychedelics I tripped for 2 months (with no drugs involved) and ended up in the hospital after not sleeping for 5 days.  It was the most terrifying and amazingly beautiful experience of my life.  It was very tough to get back in gear afterward though."

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,inahst,3,Fri Jul 17 20:46:53 2015 UTC,"I had a complete psychotic breakdown 2 months ago. I'm talking hearing voices, utter confusion, and ashamed of myself completely. I'm pretty sure I can never do psychedelics after that, which is a shame because prior to that I had been making so much progress to becoming a more emphatic person. Now I have trouble remembering who I am, let alone realizing who anyone else is; forget empathy. I've got no idea what to do. Every time I try to talk about it with my friends who trip they don't understand because while they may have had somewhat bad trips once or twice, they've never had to experience 10 hours of reality crumbling around them. Like you said, a moment for me and the others, the ones who didn't make it back in one piece."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,malcomte,2,Sat Jul 18 07:42:21 2015 UTC,Have you spoken with a mental health professional? It might help to get all of it out. Sometimes talking about something is the most powerful medicine.

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Nefandi,8,Sat Jul 18 14:33:19 2015 UTC,"But in the midst of all these awesome testimonies, it can be all too easy to forget that some souls got lost somewhere in that otherworld and never quite completed that Odyssey back home.   From their perspective it's us who didn't return.  They've found their home, while we're still wallowing in illusion here like fools.  While you conduct a requiem for them, they conduct a requiem for you and consider you a lost soul."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,inahst,10,Fri Jul 17 22:36:53 2015 UTC,"I won't speak for others, but from my experience the pain of derealization was that I was never home.   I could be sitting in my old living room with my dog on my lap, a bowl of popcorn, and my favorite cartoon from childhood and still feel like I'm on an alien planet watching this strange two-legged being (myself, of course) stare at a screen while wondering what the fuck anything is in some sort of weird incoherent fever dream logic.  It feels like you're lost in this mental void and there's no escape, and I assure you, it's the farthest thing from home."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Nefandi,0,Sat Jul 18 02:43:37 2015 UTC,"I won't speak for others, but from my experience the pain of derealization was that I was never home.    That's because your habit is to think of home as having concrete and specific parameters.  You believe home is ""out there"" as a place to which you belong, and from which you've also perhaps come (assuming you think home is where you were born, which is not always a true assumption).  This familiar place is where most people also want to die.  (Hell, most people don't want to die, ever, but if they have to, they'd rather do it at home if possible.  That's the widespread mentality I am talking about.  Not many people want to die in a cave, or on the side of a road, or in the heart of an active volcano, or in a car accident.)  So when you realize it's an illusion, but you weren't prepared for it ahead of time, it feels bad because what you used to love was taken away from you, but nothing new replaces it.  So you still want a concrete home ""out there"" but can't find it.  And this non-fulfillment of your expectation is precisely the source of pain.  The solution here is to change what you know as home.  Change your expectations about home.  But that's another topic for another time."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,inahst,2,Sat Jul 18 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but I don't know if I really conveyed what I meant by ""not being home"". I meant, quite literally, not feeling at home *on earth"". Trees creeped me out. I felt like the laws of nature were suddenly alien to me. The concept of occupying a place in space and time tripped me out constantly. I felt like I was so alien to everything that I was losing my mind."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Nefandi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:05:01 2015 UTC,"Yup.  However what you were losing weren't literally your mind, but your customary mentality.  I get that you probably know this already, but since we use ""mind"" to refer to both mind and mindset or mentality, I felt it was important to mention.  Your mind as a capacity to experience, to know, and to will isn't something you can lose.  What you can lose or abandon is a certain way of willing/knowing/experiencing in favor of a different way, and that's the loss of mentality (or a mindset) that I was talking about.  It's also a gain.  You lose one mentality only to gain another.  You're quite safely stuck with your mind.  Mind is what's doing the losing.  It itself can't get lost.  Experiencing loss is a cognition, and cognizing anything means exercising the capacity of the mind.  So whatever you're losing, you can be certain it can't literally be your mind, even if it feels like it.  And if you understand what I am talking about, this can be a source of great peace and security for you."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,inahst,5,Sun Jul 19 02:33:20 2015 UTC,Point taken though. I really like your perspective.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Nefandi,0,Sat Jul 18 04:37:52 2015 UTC,"That's a seriously dangerous view to be spreading. Enlightenment isn't found from an eighth of shrooms or a couple tabs of acid, its earned from hard work and spiritual development. You're far more likely to cause serious problems for you psyche than the whole ""finding their home"" experience you speak of.  And specifically lines like ""From their perspective it's us who didn't return."" Can validate the experience for them and, as someone says above, trigger them to fall deeper into their psychosis"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,inahst,2,Sat Jul 18 13:08:35 2015 UTC,"You should read James' ""Varieties of Religious Experience,"" to counter your notion that enlightenment can't be found in an eighth.

You're in it!  You've fallen.  Now will you get up?  How?  You're fucked 100%, right?  You can't even imagine that this world here, your body, and all conventional sentiments/values/assumptions/duties don't really exist objectively.  You're frightened.  You're frightened to deviate from the demands of this fake world.  And you're frightened to remain in it as well.  You're tormented no matter what you choose.  If you choose the spiritual path, it's scary to leave the world behind.  If you choose the mundane, it's scary because the world here is a brutal place that frankly doesn't give a fuck about you, save for a few people who got themselves emotionally attached to you, but all they care about is their own ideal vision of you, how they'd like you to be, and not the you that you know and feel as you.  That you that you know and feel they can't ever even touch.  It's not exposed.  It's not observable.  So what's left?  Well, for ignorant cowards like yourself, there is the conservative ""I'll hedge my bets"" approach.  I'll do a bit of this and a bit of that.  I'll be mundane monday through friday and spiritual on sundays.  This muddle-headed thinking gets you nowhere, and the end result is you suck at both: you are shitty at mundaning.  And you're shitty at spiritualing.  You're trying to serve two masters and you suck at both and can't please them both, since they have contradictory demands.  So that's the psychosis you're in now.  Just look at your frightened chicken response.  OOoohhh.... Aaaahhhh.......  running around and around, like a wounded animal.  Hates the world, but can't commit to the transcendent either... stuck half way like a moron, talking about hard work while doing no hard work and being completely lazy intellectually and emotionally.  Hard work is facing what you fear and not running away from it.  You fear psychosis?  Then ENTER psychosis and master it.  Dominate your psychosis.  Make psychosis your bitch.  That's how it's done mate."

It may have been that easy for you, but it's not that easy for the majority of people trying to deal with severe mental illness. And I'm not saying that how our society deals with mental illness doesn't need work either, but a lot of people just aren't equipped to deal with it the way that you suggest.

In my personal experience, extremes either way do not tend the be the best decision.

What is this non-personal belief you refer to?   That said, I personally don't agree with how absolute you are defining the possible paths and putting them at odds with one another.   I don't put psychosis at odds with sanity.  These to me are non-dual.  What people call sanity and what they call psychosis is arbitrary and it all belongs to some continuum of possible experiencing.  What some call ""sanity"" others can call ""psychosis"" precisely because there is no clear boundary between such states.  They're non-dual.  When someone is psychotic, and assuming you can reach that person through words, what do you say?  Do you say ""get out!!!""   No.  That makes the other person feel fear and loss of control in their own immediate experience!  Instead you say ""you can do it!!  Have courage!!  Your experience is something you can master!!  If you want to change it you can, and if you want to stay, you can.""  Open all the doors.  Remove all the stops.  Give courage to those you think are ""psychotic.""  Don't give fear.  Don't tell them that what they're experiencing is absolutely wrong.  It's only subjectively wrong or wrong by convention, and because of that, it can and often is subjectively right as well.  If you didn't have 1st person intimate understanding of dreaming and you saw a person sleeping from a 3rd person POV, you'd freak the fuck out too.  Psychosis is the same way.  Get 1st person intimate ""on the inside"" understanding of it, and you won't be freaking out when you see people act psychotically.  A dreamer looks like a corpse for someone who doesn't experience dreaming personally.  Someone who is psychotic looks like a mentally ill person to someone who doesn't understand enlightenment personally.  Some dreams are nightmares, and not all psychosis is good kind of psychosis.  But that doesn't mean we should be shooing people away from dreaming or psychosis.  Get yourself some psychosis!!  Stop being afraid.  Fuck sanity.  From 3rd person POV dreamers look like corpses, entirely useless to society.  From 1st person POV dreamers experience amazing lands with amazing opportunities, good and bad and sublime.

None are easy.  You're advising a path where there is all kind of potential to go wrong and bad.  Subjectively, for some people, slow and steady sober mind training is the best way and the only way.  But that doesn't mean someone taking 8g of shrooms without knowing the first thing about mind is doing it wrong.    Our lives are ongoing.  Because they're ongoing there is incompleteness of judgement.  Is 8g of shrooms wrong?  We have to wait to see what happens next.  And what happens next cannot be interpreted until we see what happens next after that.  In other words, the complete and final judgement is always deferred forward.  It's like that Chinese story about a farmer whose son has found a horse.  People in that story kept jumping to conclusions about whether it was a good or bad thing.

Here I want to explain that you shouldn't judge psychosis from a 3rd person POV.  It's not right.  If you want to understand psychosis, enter into it deeply and on your own volition, preferably sober (without the use of mushrooms or LSD as a tool, etc., unaided).  How a so-called ""psychotic"" looks to others is not a genuine picture of psychosis.  Psychosis has only one true side: the inside, the 1st person subjectivity.  In fact, your view of others is your own subjectivity!  Seeing psychosis in others is your own spiritual psychosis of mundanity.  So in a sense I am saying, abandon this psychosis and enter a different one.  Once you experience say 3 or 5 types of psychosis, and learn to travel between them at will, you'll start to get a clue about how mind works and you'll stop fearing it ignorantly, but instead will develop a healthy respect for its power.  These seductive and suggestive visions here... can you not be taken in by them?  This here looks like a computer screen, and it's so tempting to jump to a conclusion ""this really is a computer screen"".  This ""it is what it looks like"" thinking is the cause of all ignorance.  If you learn to abandon such thinking, you'll not be so afraid of psychosis from 1st person or 3rd person perspectives."

This ""psychosis"" is the easiest one to grow on a cognitive and spiritual level in due to it's relative calm in terms of how it affects your mental faculties. One should grow within this one to the point of being able to enter into deeply and of their own volition while sober and be prepared to deal with what they experience. My point is that you are MUCH more likely to be thrown into something you can't handle from psychedelics. Using psychedelics to try to force it is just dangerous and shouldn't be advocated. It's akin to shipping out to war before you've gone through training. While one may be innately prepared to deal with what happens, so many more will not."

Most involuntary psychotics got that way because they can't tolerate the psychosis of mundanity anymore.  Ultimately no psychosis is true, but all are potentially workable.  Mundanity is potentially workable.  But so is craziness.  You need to respect crazy people instead of painting them as merely mentally ill.  Some of them don't enjoy where they're at, but some do.  Some can talk coherently.  Some can't.  Some that enjoy where they're at can't talk coherently either.  Careful with your judgements.   A person's subjective psychosis due to all of their subconscious psychological baggage and mounds of cognitive dissonance can be such a terrifying experience to them that they are just unable to switch between these different psychoses and get stuck in a negative one that leads to more stagnation due to an inability to grow.   So when someone is terrified, you still peddle a line of ""psychosis is bad? don't do it!!""  That only affirms fear.  It validates their fears.  You're saying psychotics are afraid for a damn good reason.  I am saying exactly the opposite of you.  I am saying mundanity is garbage which might be OK for a few people but not OK for most.  And the so-called psychosis is such a wide field, that there is some good psychosis for everyone that's going to be superior to mundane styles of experiencing.  So without saying all forms of psychosis are good for everyone, I am nonetheless saying that for you and for you and for you there is some psychosis that's better than what you got now.  If you put the fear of hell into people about psychosis, how will they explore these alternative states of mind?  Will there be a healthy and supportive environment for such playful exploration?  No, of course not.  If psychosis is illness, you don't explore it, you get rid of it.  If psychosis is bad, you don't do it.  Etc.   My point is that you are MUCH more likely to be thrown into something you can't handle from psychedelics.   True, but irrelevant.  Some people are desperate for a glimpse and they want that glimpse now and not after 10 years of contemplation and concentration training.  Also we live in a consumerist society which seeks instant cures and easy answers.  So we have to break some eggs to make an omelet.

I'm not peddling that psychosis is bad, I'm saying that persistent negative drug-induced psychotic experiences are extremely dangerous to venture head-on into because they in most cases are caused by psychological and subconscious problems that would be much more easily resolved in the relatively stable mental state that we are all used to than the much more chaotic state that you are saying is preferrable, as it is going to be seen through the lens of their issues making it that much harder to deal with.

And instant cures and easy answers have their side effects, while slow and steady methods have relatively little.   I don't know about that.  Slow and steady is what I often preach, but slow and steady is not a panacea.  It has problems as a method.  Sometimes a fast and obvious change is the most illustrative experience compared to slow and steady where you may have to compare your present experience to how you were 30 years ago from memory, which might be vague and fuzzy.  I am not dogmatic about slow and steady.  I think people need to take risks and go wild sometimes.  When they get in too deep, maybe pull back a little, or learn to tolerate the depths by grinning and bearing it and applying wisdom to it.  Always doing the safe, obvious, accepted, ""widely praised"" thing is not the way forward.   I'm saying that persistent negative drug-induced psychotic experiences are extremely dangerous to venture head-on into because they in most cases are caused by psychological and subconscious problems that would be much more easily resolved in the relatively stable mental state that we are all used to than the much more chaotic state that you are saying is preferrable, as it is going to be seen through the lens of their issues making it that much harder to deal with.   I disagree about ""much more easily resolved.""  No, they're both hard.  Problem is, you can't reach your deep subconscious mind without copious mind training.  Second problem is that even if you do reach it, convention has a self-preservation instinct, and will never advise against itself, so psychiatry, being a conventional outlet for ""advice"" is of no help if you seek or require some kind of spiritual revolution, a kind of personal apocalypse, personal creative destruction and re-imagining.  The hard thing about doing it the ""safe"" way is that no one will be honest with you.  Which psychiatrists say ""you're right, mundaninity is crap, 9 to 5 is crap, I hate my life too you know, and being a slave to property owners while having to constantly justify your worth to them in order to feed yourself is spiritual suicide in slow motion.""  Which psychiatrist says that?  Which conventional softie spiritual teacher says that?  They don't!  How about the fact that most psychiatrists became interested in psychiatry because of their own personal issues?  It's blind leading the blind.  People with problems trying to help other people with problems.  I will stop just short of saying it doesn't work.  I will say no way is it easy.  Taking 8 grams of shrooms might be better than whatever conventional method you have in mind.  I'm not saying is.  I am saying might be.   I know you hate the term ""mental illness"", but in this case it is referring to persistent negative drug-induced psychotic experiences.   Negative experiences are essential for growth.  They aren't to be mindlessly discarded."

Most people are just not prepared to meet with their inner demons and you need to carefully choose people you trip with. For me it's now a hard choice when one of them is now asking to trip with him one more time, as I'm really worried whether the next try would damage his mind. So take care guys. Don't overdo it."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,Jetto-Roketto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:24:51 2015 UTC,"I have been hospitalized for a 25i trip gone bad, worst night of my life. I can firsthand say that trips after a psychotic break can still be affected by aforementioned break, so I can see your concerns. However I still like to think there is hope for future trips, but everything probably has to be perfect for a productive and enjoyable experience."

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,workaccountoftoday,2,Fri Jul 17 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"Family member blew his brains out recently, LSD related.  2 others I know went schizophrenic.  Not worth the risk in my opinion."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,ThePeskyWabbit,4,Sat Jul 18 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"I am sorry to hear about your friends, but would caution you against leaping to the conclusion that LSD had anything to do with these occurrences.   Over seven decades of scientific research has conclusively demonstrated that LSD does not cause psychological harm, although it may adversely interact with pre-existing mental health issues.   Not only this, but recent research has shown that people who use hallucinogens are, on the whole, more psychologically healthy than people who don't.   http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130819185302.htm  Reality is that the peak age for first trying LSD is also the peak age at which people develop schizophrenia. Similarly, many people first try illicit substances because they are feeling psychological distress and are hoping for a magic pill to make the troubles go away.   I've spoken to many people who are looking to try LSD and other psychedelics as a way out of their existential crisis and there have been a few for whom I felt great concern because I felt that they might be at risk of suicide prior to their explorations.   Psychologically healthy people do not wake up one morning and decide to kill themselves for no reason, irrespective of how much acid they've had. Rather suicidal behaviours are the result of a combination of individual, social and relational factors that combine to make suicide seem like a rational option, along with factors (such as access to guns) that make suicide both easy to carry out and irrevocable, once a decision has been made.   In all honesty, I think that you do yourself and your family a great disservice if you simply blame the LSD, rather than looking at the actual reasons behind why they took their own life.   Sure, you'll never know what was going on for them as they picked up the gun, but that decision was most likely the culmination of a long process from which lessons can be drawn.   One of the biggest risks of suicide is a family member who has also committed suicide, and I fear that by failing to confront what was actually going on for your family member, one day you'll find yourself living through the same devastation once more. :-("
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,WeirdStray,2,Sat Jul 18 06:51:36 2015 UTC,Then there are people like me. Ive only tripped on shrooms twice and both times it made me feel more human.  It made feel like I actually belong to this earth and to this group of human beings.  I felt like a kid again at a family reunion or something.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,unlmtdLoL,2,Sat Jul 18 04:19:22 2015 UTC,"I can sort of relate.  Shrooms started my derealization.  Acid brought me home, at least for a little bit. It didn't cure me, but it reminded me of what it was like to be ""back"" and certainly pointed me in the right direction for healing.  With that said, I would love to revisit the fungi and see what they can show me in a different environment and mindset from my first trip (the bad one)."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,The-Internets,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:29:04 2015 UTC,why do you refer to the acid dimension as 'home' you think that's where we were before this?
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,GregKasarik,2,Sat Jul 18 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that, after being so disconnected from everything and caught up in the feeling the whole universe is a weird void of confusion and meaninglessness, acid brought me to a place where I realized that everything was ok, that it's ok not to have to answers to all of the questions I had about the universe, and that all I have to do to find my place in the cosmos is to be me. The same me I've been all along. It didn't feel like I was tripping. It felt like I was becoming reaquainted with a world not defined by the trippy metaphysics and existential problems that defined my derealization.  Does that make sense?"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,The-Internets,2,Sat Jul 18 05:03:32 2015 UTC,For OP.  I see you have been helped from troubles.  Is there any specific events or posts here that were the ones that truly helped?  It would be nice to see such posts for anyone else who may need them.
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,PM_ME_YOUR_MARXISM,2,Sat Jul 18 14:25:44 2015 UTC,The reason I never went further on LSD was that I didn't want to get lost and have my body taken over and destroyed if I ever found my way back.  I urge anyone that is a psychonaut to rediscover our infinity by reading the book Our Journey Home by George Kavassilas.  The profoundness and exciting worlds that are available pre and after death as we currently think of it here on Earth in general is nothing compared to what our incarnation currently means.  All is well when balanced is the way of life.

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,workaccountoftoday,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:32:39 2015 UTC,Would you say that these cases could be countered with a proper education about the substances and the mind or is it realy depending on the individuum?
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,The-Internets,3,Fri Jul 17 21:32:39 2015 UTC,"Education certainly helps, but I don't think anything can fully prepare a person for tripping until they do it.   When you feel your sense of identity disintegrating, it's hard to grasp onto the advice of a stranger on Reddit, no matter how sound it is. You can certainly try, and it does help. If I hadn't bothered to educate myself beforehand, I can barely imagine how awful my bad trip would have been.  But I think that education can only take you so far. I hope that makes sense."

Psychonaut,3dn2ru,workaccountoftoday,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:25:49 2015 UTC,"I believe I suffer from derealization after my last trip on 1000ug 25D nbome and weed. Sometimes I feel like I am the only one experiencing life and everyone else is created by my mind. As if other people represent subconscious elements of me. But that also plays into the idea that we are all the same thing but our minds are wired slightly differently so of course I'm going to see common traits in others. That last trip just changed my perspective in a very intense way. It gave me a little more confidence though because if I just tell me self none of this is real, I end up acting on urges more often and so far it's been good :P"
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,The-Internets,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:24:50 2015 UTC,"I was there and will let you know my way around it.  I just realized at a music festival that there was no way in hell I could believe my mind was capable of all this.  Everything around me was insane, people doing extremely amazing firework, bands collaborating on stage with beautiful music, crazy light shows on the screen.  All with thousands of people there enjoying it like me.  People who had lives just as long if not longer than me.  I realized that while I thought at first my mind was saying we are all one and everything is you, that I am just so disconnected from everything else and it's not as easy as just consuming a drug to form a true connection with anything OTHER than my own personal body and brain.  I don't know shit about how things work.  If my brain was creating it all, I should have a decently better understanding or even control over it.  But I can't make anything do anything.  And people surprise me every day with how hard they work towards something they care about.  Musicians especially.  That's when I basically closed the book on questioning if it's all within my mind.  Even if it is, this reality chose to not allow me to connect with it all via my mind alone."
Psychonaut,3dn2ru,The-Internets,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:29 2015 UTC,Yep that's what I'm thinking. I originally thought everything around me was a creation relating to something within me. Like it represented an emotion. But I had it backwards. Everything in life evokes an emotion in me and I had to flip my view around to understand that. Normally I would have thought of you saying that being a representation of my subconscious or some shit but really you're view relates closely to mine which is why It speaks deeply to my emotions.

He's slowly piecing it together, but it was a terrifying experience for him. He was in the emergency room after being found on my friend's lawn. We still don't know if what he took was really LSD or some research chemical. The other friends he was with didn't have a bad experience, as far as I know.  I'm not sure if the ""LSD"" uncovered some underlying schizophrenia he had, but regardless he was not ready to take on what it brought to him. Hopefully he can use the experience to better himself when it's all said and done. This was a good post and reminder for everyone on this sub and beyond."

Ive died in my dreams and in the small handful of hallucinogenic experiences many times... Nothing is as bad as feeling my heart die followed by my memories and mental ability of imagery, not from any substances... From the continuous pressure and enforcement of trauma over and over by everyone around me with the excuse of me bringing it upon myself. Yet, I am not allowed to treat them the same or even do the things to others that have been done to me.   Unfortunately communities whom tolerate or support such substance use are the ones one might find the most whom advocate and push such experience. Now that my ""trials"" are ""done"" I have less enemies people around me to pretend to give a shit, which sucks because even then I was alone more than the majority of the time. Drowning in non-physical pain, I fake my contentment, lie to myself, why would I want another to go through this? I can't... there is no reason for want, no iteration of desire, not anymore, must not be important I guess. The importance of this place is vested in suffering, deception, denial, and other things that can be done to a person to remove potential or capability. I'm still learning how to do these things to please the enemies people sharing this prison.   TL:DR - I wasn't good enough to kill so I die every day in this temporal prison."

You seem to be in a very dark place, but the truth is that it is within your power to either stay there, or to reframe your experience by focusing on the positives that are in your life.   Fact is that whether you are glass half full or glass half empty, it isn't the glass that is changing, but your perceptions of it.   Sure, it isn't an easy thing to dig yourself out of a hole of the sort that you are in. In fact, right now, it might seem like a hopeless task and may even require a lot more work and effort than anything that you've ever done in your life.   But who cares how much work and effort are involved, if the end result is an irresistible  happiness that you carry with you everywhere?   If you want it, change is certainly within your grasp! :-)"

I am so glad your life is so fucking great. You don't have to listen to the electronic sounds of 'cicadas' reverberating throughout the day and have people constantly trying to traumatize you, repeatedly. I know this is how it is because I have talked to these people personally, they believe the only way I can get rid of my arrogant 'ego' is by repeatedly going through trauma and that it is necessary for me to let them.   The only option I have left to get these people off my back is to start ending peoples lives. So, yeah, I have the power to cause change but do you think its worth it?   You would be better off not judging people. Do not assume others have been afforded the same opportunity as you.

It may be luck, I can't say. A lot of life is truly just what is luck if you ask me.  That said, what helped me be happy here in my solitude is just hobby searching.  I went from getting a cat to building circuits, growing tomatoes hydroponically, failing at that and growing tomatoes outdoors, finding plants I found interesting and putting them in my home, picking up my guitar and actually spending some time with it, and cooking.  When that wasn't enough, I got some effects and a looper for my guitar, grabbed a bass, and now recently have grabbed some synths.  I've begun to draw, I have a list of 40 books I want to read and learn from.  Find your happy place.  It's not easy.  But it's worth it.  Nothing worth it is easy.  I'm still not fully happy.  I'm abusing dissociative right now even.  I don't know if it's dangerous.  But when I get in the flow of gardening, reading, or jamming on my guitar I get that feeling of wonder I get on drugs where everything is awesome in the world.  And all these changes in my life?

Everywhere I go it seems people know a little bit too much about me before they can even legitimately learn anything about me, come to think of it, I have actually never met anyone whom hasn't expressed some form of already knowing me.   So I sit in my house, I have for 8 years now, I only get out to buy food and at extreme early hours. See, this is how I know I have some kind of target on me, there is no possible way any of the people in my life are telling the truth. Fuck it right? I must be paranoid schizophrenic, stuff like that just isn't possible... right? Yeah, right!   Its funny, I used to have voice chat convos online about all kinds of stuff.. Then people irl started asking me about certain things or topics that I would talk about a few days before, people whom I don't know.. So I stopped voice chatting and started pretending like I was, maybe the other people were fucking with me even though they don't live near me? No, I can have a mock conversation and people will still bring up parts of it a few days later like they are slick, fucking idiots.   But thats ok I guess, I chose it all!!! It isn't like I haven't caught someone tryin to earn their 'jacobean hat' (their words not mine) doing things around my house in such a manner in which I can only conclude is an attempt to make me feel/look psychotic, guess they are doing a great job. There is so much treachery in my life I might as well be crazy, it isn't like they aren't already 'force medicating' me.

I don't know anything about you, and I know I've experienced some forms of paranoia.  I'm honestly lucky it hasn't consumed me a bit more and do fear that it will in the future.  The human mind is designed to look for patterns, it's how we have been so successful thus far.  Unfortunately that can lead to us seeing patterns where there are none.  Things such as cognitave bias do exist which definitely do not help paranoid tendencies.  Look up the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon.  It's exactly what you're saying, and it DOES happen to all of us.  Humans haven't fully explained it, and it seeds paranoia in us all.    I don't even know if you're a guy or a girl, what age you are, or even what country you're in!    I would love to hear any of your stories if you feel like typing them.  I would hope someone would do the same for me.

What I do is to look up on the internet for the kinds of images I want to see, if I want to see something spiritual I look for Alex Gray art imagery, for example.  So I stay up late, listening to music, and on the moment I feel ready I close my eyes, laying on the bed, and shapes and figures start forming under my eyelids. My eyes start shaking like on REM sleep.  It's a form of tetris effect, but it is also a ""lightweight trip"". The imagery now created can have meaning, just like the ones you experience under a psychdelic substance.

Psychonaut,3dpdn8,SkaSicki,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:17:38 2015 UTC,It can last way longer or way shorter than a year. Some people just get it for a few months. Some have it for years. I have had it for 6 months now and its hasnt made much progress. I got it from a single shroom trip and it was at its worse 3 months after the trip. after the three month mark symptoms started to go away but at the 5 month mark i started to experience new symptoms id never had before.

It has returned a bit recently as I have started tripping again, but because I don't worry about it now it seems to fade easier. I actually think my obsessing about it made it worse back then, so my advice is to not allow yourself to worry about it.  I wish you luck, and from my experience I would say that it really does fade away over time.  Also, it wouldn't have happened to me at all if I quit smoking pot.  Pot brings back the HPPD visuals, in my experience."
Psychonaut,3dpdn8,sunflowersup,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:35:35 2015 UTC,"I've made comments on similar threads to this one, but I was a sufferer from HPPD. I grew up through some 'traumatizing' experiences (whatever...), and used mushrooms later in my life to help with my anxiety issues. It worked wonders, but I was also tripping a lot and all still while under the age of 20. I eventually developed mild HPPD, and it wasn't consuming my life, but it did make it difficult to function sometimes.   I stopped doing all psychedelics for just a bit over 3 years, and my symptoms have mostly gone away entirely. Occasionally, I'll get a flashback, but it never lasts more than a couple of seconds. It certainly doesn't interfere with my life like it used to. It was definitely a lot worse just coming off of all of it, and I was in an honors college writing a thesis, which sort of compounded the issue with all the stress. But in my last two years at college, I didn't do any hard drugs, got my thesis done, and I'm mostly anxiety free. So, in a lot of ways I came out on top. It's probably a good thing you stopped smoking and drinking, but I did not stop smoking, and I don't find that it brings those symptoms back, at least for me.  But I don't know where you heard it can be form of PTSD, that doesn't seem right at all. PTSD means you've been traumatized. PTSD can exacerbate HPPD symptoms, but it doesn't flow the other way, at least as far as I know."
Psychonaut,3dpdn8,timeddilation,0,Sat Jul 18 13:36:09 2015 UTC,"If you've tripped enough it will be permanently there. Good news is you'll get used to it. Staying away from substance and being healthy might help, but idk I never tried that to be honest because it hasn't bothered me much, but that's what I've heard."
Psychonaut,3doqsn,Porkavag,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:32:48 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience on shrooms back in the winter. I wasn't ready to go as deep as it was going to take me, so I abandoned ship. My ego wasn't ready to get utterly obliterated.   I went to Central America a few months later and had my first aya and DMT experiences. Setting is absolutely essential. Shamans were present, and I can't imagine going on such voyages without them.   I don't know if you should rush back into those spaces considering what happened during this trip. Be safe and respect the spirits."

Psychonaut,3doqsn,entheogenicdude1233,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:07:26 2015 UTC,"I noticed in my trips that not purging made the trips better.  Along with this, taking the mindset of knowing where you want to go also helps.  If you don't know where you are going sometimes it's hard to focus, and you just end up feeling lost confused and scared.  I found sacred geometry is good to focus on because it makes sense illogically to the brain and brings you in the right mindset for going ""homewards"".  It works well. Soon you start to come across certain things which will come up regardless of what hallucinogen and once you get there, there is no more getting lost, you are always ""on point"".    Soon your feelings will rule your world and make you who you are (which is something divine, magnificent, and in truth, you are the light).    The problem is the darkness which surrounds us, dangers everywhere, constantly lurking.  The cure to them I have to ask myself still, but on mushrooms I've watched them disappear, I saw them as nothing more than thoughts and voices which aim to beseech me, pretend to be me, thoughts which only provoke me.  I watched them fall away on mushrooms once, a very small dose.  They disappeared and fell below me from where they came from, something I hope to make permanent one day.  Perhaps you know all that I speak of?   Thank you"

Psychonaut,3doj89,loukcuf,3,Fri Jul 17 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"I also think I gotta stop tripping alone in a room at night. I gotta do it outside in nature in bright sunlight.   My thoughts precisely. And I've also got to stop doing it with people. I'm halfway there, only ever tripped with others (their minds and body language can really throw your mind around, especially when the esp stuff starts happening.) or by myself in my room. Time to organise weekend camping trips.  It's completely okay to delude yourself for the duration of the trip. Each piece of the imagination has something to teach. And I think that's what Leary and Dass were keen on - the fact that LSD allows you to imagine and see and think things that were never before possible. That is the true doorway to spirituality, that's what they mean when they say within you are infinite - it's the imagination that's infinite. These drugs empower it and can take you absolutely anywhere.  But they also seem to be conscious drugs, or at least the synchrony of reality requires them to make certain progress; they will take you to where they need you to go, to show you something with a deeper meaning. Although I can't talk much about the feeling of dying, I've tripped about 30 times and never encountered it, although I've experienced ego-death - probably because I'm not scared of death, I long for it, and have done since my early years. But at the same time, I still experience fear during trips. It seems to me that's what half the trip is about, facing your deepest fears.  They didn't exactly do it as a social experiment. It technically is a social experiment however, and it's still playing out. But the reason they did it is because it taught them something that they needed to know, that we all need to know, and need to remember. Nothing matters - you are nothing - you matter. We are all one - the second coming is a prophecy - we are each the second coming, we must only realise this - no one can make the world appear better other than yourself. The road of making the world better is filled with all our deepest fears - they each have something to teach us. But that teaching comes from within; I can't explain to you how to understand whatever it is you need to understand.  But first, learn to be skeptical of yourself, Terrence reckons that's why he made it so far into his own mind, your mind will conjure some crazy fucking ideas, and you should do 2 things with them. Don't 100% believe any of them, and come to terms with their implications.  My last trip, the whole time I was thinking about suicide, I was being sat by 3 other people, and they just kept saying things like ""oh yeah, have a cigarette, that's one way to kill yourself"" ""I might go to bed, and cry myself to sleep"" ""Fuck this place, they call it the wastelands."" And all kinds of sour shit - clearly they were going through the same lines of thinking I was. I just shook my head and laughed my arse off - of course, I come here to have a good time, to encounter beauty, and you show me the beauty of hating on life.   All I can really say is, if you want to go deep into your mind, you better be ready to face your demons, they are legion (many), they know your weak-points, and they do not tire.  Peace and best of luck!"

Psychonaut,3doj89,mootball,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:20:15 2015 UTC,Well it's an experiment because they didn't exactly know what the results would be. I guess that's why it's easy to confuse whether they did it out of malice or out of love.
Psychonaut,3doj89,DranoTheCat,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"In my humble opinion, one should avoid high doses that lead to ego death until one is prepared to embrace it.  Ego death is the ""big death""; physical death only a ""little death.""    Good luck on your journey!"

Psychonaut,3doj89,entheogenicdude1233,2,Sat Jul 18 00:37:10 2015 UTC,"I love Ram Dass and Alan Watts! Not sure how long you've been tripping, but controlling the mind got easier over time for me.  I've gotten a life changing spiritual experience from 150ug before, and I don't start with more than 180 because I prefer to enjoy myself rather than sweat, tremble, and say the same, ""why did I do this?"" That you're talking about.  It sounds though like you talked yourself into the idea that it was going to get bad, and I think that's a problem. I always remind myself when things get tense that I may only be five minutes from bliss... And sometimes that turns out to be true. :D"
Psychonaut,3doj89,entheogenicdude1233,2,Sat Jul 18 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"I get the same feeling you do at times.  Experience made me better at it.  Of course, every time I've gotten those feelings and overcome it, I feel the sheer pleasure about life at the end of the trip is far superior than had I never had the negative aspect at all.  That said I still try to avoid it.  Only thing I can say is try doing different shit when you trip.  Maybe rather than receiving inputs from the ideas of others, you should explore what comes out of you from your own inputs.  Start writing something and see where it goes if you enjoy textual formats.  Draw a picture that explores how you're feeling.  Even if you go into it with no plan, the moment you start one point you'll be more comfortable in that creation than the moment before.  Once you get going it will flow for you a bit better.  I always get the ""I will change my life and do these great things and no longer take drugs"" thing while under the influence too.  It doesn't happen overnight for me, but my laziness prevents it a lot.  It's hard work to commit to that.  My take on the point of Be Here Now was that psychedelics are not the end all answer to spirituality.  That there is more effort than that.  His spiritual journey was pure luck at least if you believe his story in the book.  He just happened upon going to India, and happened upon Maharji, and just happened to stay.  And it changed his life.  But psychedelics started that questioning for him.  Ram Dass is a nice guy, but his one true message was in the title of the book.  The rest of it is just one person's experience.  Keep in mind that he read every book that he recommends in the back there.  This is before he wrote BHN too.  Actually, Dass's words are exactly what help me when I get in the same phase of tripping.  I start thinking of the past and feelings like that, and how I get stuck in a process of thinking.  I remember ""you've been here before many times, and every time you get out of this.  you can choose to be here and choose to be now"" and I'm able to eventually come back within reality and experience what is happening at that time rather than dwell on the past.  Either way, you'll formulate ideas on this tripping experience for years to come.  It just happened, and you will need time to recover a bit.  Give it thought, come back to ground zero, and you will realize it's not as negative as you once believed.  Definitely 100% trip in nature.  You'll really feel something special there.  Good luck friend."

It may feel cowardly but in the big picture it doesn't really matter how you do it."
Psychonaut,3dobza,shmkys,7,Sat Jul 18 00:25:19 2015 UTC,"As others have suggested, it's fine to ditch people, just don't be an asshole about it. Relationships are not meant to last forever. Sometimes they do, and that is great, but you have to know when to cut them if they are going south. ""The wise man does not force anything."" This includes relationships that aren't working in a positive or harmonious manner.    I know for myself (approaching 30), I feel like I have far less close friends than I did, say, 10 years ago. I've come to realize that most of the people I used to call friends are not interested in the same thing I am, and that the only thing that really bonded us in the first place was being in school together and then getting drunk and high every weekend in the years following. Once you come out of that fog and you actually assess what it is that makes you tick, then compare it to your ""friends"", you may find that they have almost nothing (or actually nothing) in common with you.    Making new friends is hard, especially as you get older, but if you put in the work and don't settle (same as a romantic relationship), it is very rewarding. Personally I am far happier having 3 or 4 friends that are stable like a giant boulder in the sea, than I am to have 10 or 12 fair-weather friends. I do have a lot of acquaintances and I am fine to hang out with them on random day-trips and go camping and shit, but I have a very, very tight-knit group whom I consider to be my confidants and people whom I would call if any serious personal emergency ever befell me.    The trick to making good friends, I think, is to step outside your personal comfort zone. The world is a wide place and good people of all stripes can be found just about anywhere. The only way to find them is to make a leap and go to places you wouldn't normally go to. You might surprise yourself!"
Psychonaut,3dobza,GuitarGreg,3,Sat Jul 18 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I'd ask you if these people are truly ""toxic"", or whether you've just outgrown them. Ask yourself what connects you to these people and if there isn't anything that you can come up with, I'd suggest that you don't just dump them, but instead take steps to find people with whom you do connect and transfer the majority of your attention to these new people.   If, on the other hand, you find that they are people with whom you share a common connection and have genuinely shared interests, I'd advise against merely dropping them (or at least all of them) out of your life entirely.   Instead, start a conversation in the group about what you want out of life and what they want out of life. If everyone is feeling the same way, then you might find that they are thinking in similar terms.  But by starting a conversation, you may find that some of your friends are stuck, but simply don't know how to get out. If this is the case, then you and your friends (or perhaps only some of them), can share the journey out of the darkness together and can help inspire and motivate each other during the difficult, get off your arse, transition stage.   This sort of conversation can also be a good catalyst for people talking about their careers and relationships. Often what you describe is symptomatic of people simply having no purpose, rather than something inherent to themselves. If this is the case, seriously consider having each of you get some personal, or careers counselling, so that you can all figure out what they hell you really want to be doing with your lives.  You may find that only some of your friends want to join you on your adventure. If so, it is up to the rest of you to decide what to do about them. Personally, I would once again not simply drop them as friends. Rather, I'd look to use your own experience as a catalyst for inspiring them to change. Similarly, if you have one person in the group who is a real misery guts, perhaps the rest of you can just be cheerful at them until they learn to lighten up a bit.  Remember that happiness is just as contagious as misery. Even more so, because people gravitate towards happiness and like being around people who are cheerful.  With respect to yourself, I'd also suggest that you stop ""trying"" to have a positive outlook on life and instead make a conscious choice to be as positive as you can about every situation you encounter.   Keep a dairy by your bed and each day write in three good things that have happened to you on that day. Set your alarm on your phone to go off three times a day, and when it does, step into the experience of one of your five happiest moments, feeling the emotional joy of being there.   But I'm guessing that like 95% of the people on this planet, you don't even know, off the top of your head, what your five happiest moments have been. So your first point of call is to discover them, connect with them and relive all their joy. Do this often enough and you'll find that having to worry about toxic friends will cease to be an issue, because you'll carry within you an existential happiness and joy that will insulate you from any negativity they might bring.   Once you are in the driver's seat of your own happiness, it will inform your ability to decide who and when you let into your life and for what reason you do so.   http://kasarik.com/have-you-chosen-happiness/"

Psychonaut,3doiog,needan_accounttopost,2,Sat Jul 18 05:08:38 2015 UTC,"My interpretation~ Many people are indeed thinking too much, as seems to be the relentless nature of the ego. Thoughts require you to pay attention and energy to them. Quite simply therefore, our attention is constantly to ours thoughts. People are consumed by their minds and are not paying any attention to the world around them. They are not paying attention to the food they eat, they are not feeling the brilliance of nature because they were elsewhere in their head. We are not feeling and listening to the needs of the body! The paradox of this quote of course, is that thoughts can cause feelings?? Thinking about certain subjects, past experience's etc can invoke strong feelings/emotions (Anxiety e.g)! We are if anything stuck in a loop of too much thinking and then feeling the wrath of that in the body. As a book i am reading said, ""Be careful what you load into the your mind, because the brain will process it regardless"" Mind -> body I stick with my main point in interpreting this quote, that it is mainly discussing attention.

In the eyes of the person who wrote the quote, they see only people at the other end. I think there are just as many people who deconstruct something into quantifiable attributes as there are those who take that same thing to its logical extreme based on an emotion.

People said time would grow faster as I get older, but  I feel as if I'm just gaining more time personally.  I'm 26 and have changed so much in the past 2 years, it's legitimatley hard for me to imagine my life is something that will progress for at least 3x what I've experienced thus far.  Like holy shit, that's a lot of fucking time.  I have a lot of things I can do out there.  And I think all over the place.  My biggest problem is focusing and actually doing.  That said, I do agree a lot of people out there do not think nearly as much as they should.  I personally believe society is designing itself so less thought occurs.  ALL forms of modern entertainment are created to stop thinking, and start feeling.  We design entertainment that causes feelings inside of us.  A scary movie exists so we can replicate the feeling of fear, which is not something we may experience otherwise in the warm blanket of society.  All this shit exists so we can get our touch of emotions before we go back into the office and work another 50 hour week.  The stuff for thinking is there, but it has been shushed for a while.  It's why many believe psychedelics are illegal.  It makes someone truly think for a minute.  And that may not be productive to our society.  We don't know since the alternative doesn't exist.  This is why I believe many do not get art.  They do not choose to think about it, because they have been raised to stop asking questions and listen to their superiors.  This is also why are is extremely important.  Every now and then, one person will stare at a splash of paint on a board and wonder ""I've never had a desire to do this.  This isn't the life experience I was told I should achieve.  Why is someone else doing this?"" and maybe they'll follow that path to truly become a thinker.  I'm one of those people.

It goes back to St. Thomas Aquinas, everything logically has a cause and the very first cause is what that term god is a placeholder for. The spinner of the wheel.

I've had trips of seeing from other people's perspective, hearing people's thoughts, people asking me if I can read their mind, talking to people with my eyes, them talking back with their eyes (it's actually one movement not two), seeing people's emotions visually appear in their aura, there's so much.  I've taken mushrooms and ayahuasca together maybe 60 times or more, and have been smoking weed for a few years. Along with this I use a very specific method, which is looking for the way of the universe, the way of the tao.  It is easier to do this with others than by yourself, to prevent confusion states of mind, but the best way to begin to understand it is by looking at sacred geometry while tripping, and soon you realize how to focus your feelings/emotions on a single area of thought and then they will all make sense in relation to that point, soon you are never lost in emotions, you only observe them knowing where they fit in a bigger picture.

I tend to not really have experiences like that anymore as I smoke way too much and don't meditate nearly enough--plus, i pretty much never smoke alone anymore as I live with my partner. but I've had a few experiences where I've been blown away by the depth and mathematics in music while smoking alone, and I've realized the beauty in not only nature, but man made things as well, and how those two intermingle over time.  I believe i've had two seperate revelations of sorts due to weed, though: 1. i can't continue eating meat. it feels wrong, it goes against my philosphy, and it's cruel and unneccessary. it's been a few years strong now, but certain smells still tempt me. and I WILL give into curiousity: I tried chicken foot a few months ago. wasn't tasty. no regrets, though, because now I know! 2. my soul/my energy is complicated and intertwined with the earth: I'm human now, but I have been various other things and still am other things in some ways. and that's okay, it's okay to be more than just human. sorry for rambling and for confusing nonsense. your english and grammar is great, by the way.

Talk to it, meditate on it. make the whole thing a ceremony, and you will be gifted for doing this. you don't have to look up any ceremonial procedures also, just create your own way.

He knows his ego will die, again.  Ego death is the ""big death""; physical only a ""small death.""    Without the ego, you can be as a preschooler is, curious about everything; loving everything; learning everything.  But to get there, you must cast your ego aside.  You may be sensing this, so now that same ""fun"" you first felt, you now view as a path toward inner clarity, and most I suspect feel trepidation and anxiety to taking the leap toward ego death.  I wish you luck, fellow explorer :)  I hope you find peace, and tranquillity."

Psychonaut,3dk575,OrbitRock,26,Thu Jul 16 22:38:29 2015 UTC,"Your writing is great, and I think you're right. There is some kind of revolution on the horizon. Our current system is slowly but surely destroying the planet. As well as destroying the people in it. I'm reading the Crash of 2016 right now, and the author mentions the 4 generation cycle. Right now, we are experiencing the final pains of an economic downturn, but the upside is we will get the chance to rebuild this system. I think if you have a plan for creating a sustainable system, and a means to do so, now is the time to do it. If the system does indeed crash in 2016 being in a self-sufficient, sustainable system will not only keep you insulated from the crash, but you would be looked to as a leader moving forward. I think one thing we could do as a community would be to attempt to build a town or city like the Zeitgeist project shows. A town that simply isn't a system based on money, where people only have to do a very minimal amount of work to get by. With the rest of their time, people would be able to focus it on creative or constructive endeavors. Whether it be music, gaining knowledge, writing, creating new technology, or whatever it is. We could build towns like these, and if we can get the ball rolling now, we'd potentially be looked at as leaders in creating a new system. I'm trying to figure out how to acquire some money right now, so that I could turn a piece of land into a reality like this. It could potentially be a turning point for humanity where we begin to free ourselves from economic slavery. Where we use technology to free humanity, rather than enslave ourselves."

Psychonaut,3dk575,notjaker44,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:30:01 2015 UTC,"I think you'll find that a self sufficient community will require much more work than you imagine. You don't see many subsistence farmers or homesteaders who have a lot of leisure time for creative writing, research etc. they may have some free time in certain seasons, but certainly not more than the average blue collar wageslave. Agriculture is hard work - especially if you live in a northern climate and need to account for heating. And the more self sufficient you are, the more work it will be. For example - are you going to generate your own power or buy it? Generating your own involves significant startup cost and will require you to maintain your turbines/solar cells/whatever. Alternately, you can live without power - people have done it for most of human history and it remains a viable option. However, not having electricity will make most of your chores more labor intense. The list goes on -healthcare, tools, equipment, fuel. How self sufficient do you need to be for the experiment to be valid?  Of course, I encourage you to try. I've always been interested in these sorts of communities and think that it would be an interesting lifestyle - just don't underestimate how many actual man-hours of work it takes to pull it off. I also don't think that this kind of thing is going to fundamentally change the world in our lifetimes. Sadly, only fire and blood will do that."

Marx also was aware of cycles in government, such as the democracy in America heading towards socialism, communism comes next, but mankind is inherently too evil to abide by the system and someone will want to gain power and privelege. Maybe it will take the threat of the earth being inhabitable to rid man of his selfish greedy ways. I see it turning into a race to survive and the actions of the race will make us crash even quicker. Man kind is doomed, and we have earned it.  PERSONAL FEELINGS RANT EDIT: We are a disgusting, parasitic, wasteful, toxic plague to this planet and all of its inhabitants. We consume and reproduce with no regard for the host. People believe that they are separate from the universe and foolishly try to create legacies to never be forgotten. We are cancer to the planet. There has never been a documented case of cancer where the disease found a way to coexist with the host. Either we will kill this planet, or it will kill us first. Man is trying to find a way to inhabit other planets, that is when our species will become a viral infection to the universe. We can sit here and be enlightened and love each other all we want but we are still outnumbered by the ones who control the feeble minded that waste their lives perpetuating a system they have believed to be the only way things can be for their entire lives. This awakening of higher levels of consciousness doesn't seem to be that common, I don't know anyone in real life that has their eyes open. We are done for and we deserve it. We are genetic mutations able to achieve higher states of perception and we are too little too late. We may as well enjoy the time we have left before we're all eradicated by a cosmic lysol wipe."

We consume and reproduce with no regard for the host.   We are actually the same thing that every other orgamism is. I study ecology, you see the exact same pattern with all organisms that catch onto a huge advantage in their environment. Luckily we are a species that can become aware of it, but also unluckily at the same time we are still quite strongly an animal who is often incapable of considering things such as this and using the knowledge to modify action.     The way I see it, it is either ""evolve"" that ability, or get selected against. Maybe some people will wise up and survive. I actually really do hope mankind survives. Not in a selfish, self-propogation way either, but just from the standpoint that we are one of the most amazing things in the universe (that we know of). It'd be a shame for such a complex, beautiful, and capable thing to die out."
Psychonaut,3dk575,Harry_Covair,11,Fri Jul 17 21:01:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting read. Although I would argue that it was my father's generation that was living at the high -- and still reaping many of the benefits. Writing as someone in their 20s, a middle-of-the-mean Gen-Y-er, this means that we sit squarely in a time of Awakening, rather than the Unravelling or Crisis phase.  I think that it's a common mistake for every generation to make that they believe theirs is the one in crisis. To give in to hyperbole. For now, things aren't great, in many places, awful, but are we in a crisis? No. Bordering on a civil war or revolution? No. Are people getting ready to abandon their homes, mortgages, children and jobs, risk hunger, death and modern convenience for the purpose of disassembling the government or fighting a foreign threat? Highly unlikely.  Things can get a lot worse. Profoundly worse. But that's not to say that it's not coming. It's probably just a good few decades away at least. Keep a healthy lifestyle and you may just live long enough to see it."
Psychonaut,3dk575,DoctimusLime,4,Fri Jul 17 00:10:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't think the model matches reality perfectly. I think the authors were trying to make things fit the pattern they saw between the end of WWII and now, and most likely did, as you say, fall into the thinking that ""there's always an upcoming crisis"".    I mostly lay out their theory to show how we can think about generations differently. Even if they are not cyclical as Strauss and Howe describe, there is a lot to the idea that one will be born, take in influences from the actions of the older 3 while they are young, will do things such as fight wars or protest or think up new ideas in their 20s, then will go into positions of power (as political leaders, movement leaders, and even just as mothers and fathers), and then become the old generation, the oldest people that the newest generation will know, thus influencing them (and all the other ones that are born during their life).  But yeah, I do agree that we are not in an active crisis phase at this point."
Psychonaut,3dk575,6sweet6leaf6,4,Fri Jul 17 00:22:15 2015 UTC,"The problem is that your argument is based on moral relativism, and we know morality and ethics are constructs of the human mind. There is no such thing as good or evil, only thinking makes it so. The idea of humanity as an extinction event being 'wrong' is nonsense. All of the people on the planet, and their behaviors, are just something the total cosmos is doing at a place called here & now, or a place called 'I'. 'I' is a pronoun of positions, such as 'there' or 'this'. The planet flowers with people the way sn apple tree blooms with apples. The apples are something the tree does, it's only a separate object when the human mind makes that distinction. Good and evil, being and non-being, black and white, all come from the same center. They imply each other. You couldn't stop this 'bad thing' from happening anymore than you can tie up packages with the equator. Accept this reality, that your moral conditioning is exactly a distinction and not physically present. Accept tat the only variable you can truly influence is yourself. Let go of your attachments and stop projecting your morality onto the world, a world which is yourself, and then you can cease suffering.  Making a new society based on a moral relativism myth that came out of a newtonian myth created by scientific naturalism in response to oppressive abrahamic religion is actually extrapolating your perceived problem further. Your suggested course of action is to ensue a fantastic sustainable battle with nature, and that isn't any more connected than the culture you are currently in. Because the universe defined by them is a cold dead gyrating nonsense, and if we don't get in there with our cleverness and power to beat it about then the sun will explode and that's that. The question now is whether or not you will have the ability to make this distinction and feel one with the universe without trying to influence it's progression to suit your petty emotional attachments, or if you will frantically struggle to consume more resources to survive instead of accepting that all death is certain, and that no matter how bad we fuck up the earth everything we do as an expression of the universe is natural. We destroy the planet in the same way some flowers are tulips and some are roses. In our seeing, our hearing, our doing we express that which moves the sun and  & other stars. Even this feeling of being disconnected is something that is naturally taking it's course, just as it's giving us green or blue eyes et cetera. We get to watch, and that's what I'm grateful for. I wouldn't presume to be more worthy of the universe' resources than a lifeform which is destined to come after me, or presume that I know better than the cosmos & fight it for survival instead of letting this wave of people flowering come from crest to trough. White cannot win unless black loses. The myth of our culture is such moral relativism, that white must always win because of morality. But if black always loses it will die. A lifeform which never loses will kill all the other lifeforms. Getting rid of money et cetera isn't going to change the course of extinction, it's just going to let you pretend you aren't part of it. You are the universe doing it to yourself, and under your course of action you would remain disconnected.  If you want people to feel connected tell them that the universe is god, and as an expression of this chemistry & physics we are therefore one with god, whatever that is. This is an idea dating back millenia, and we have already had cultures where we feel as one. Do some reading, find out the reason you can't get rid of your ego is because it doesn't exist. We created it. In times past, a group of peoples flowered and died together (think of near-east kings, the whole assemblage of persons were buried together for this cultural reason), as one being. All we have to remember them by are relics. The hindus called this 'Tat Tvam Asi', meaning That thou art. You're it baby! Only you're pretending you are not. The sufiis understood this, the daoists understoof this, budhists too. In the lines of Gk Chesterton, ""Now a great thing in the street it seems, any human nod where move in strange democracies the million masks of god."" It is great, even as it plays at societal and environmental collapse it is still great & awe inspiring. All that's left is for us to accept this and stop trying to control it. If you have to do something, sing and dance. That's the conclusion these cultures came to, and it's why they chant. Ying yang dualism, the inverse of the divine spark is boredom."

Any species will competitively inhibit those around it, any species wil undergo exponential growth if the conditions allow, any species, if it was put in a similar position, would do much the same thing. We are no different than any other organism.       But I'd also disagree, what I'm talking about here is far beyond any relativistic morality. To me, I'm talking survival. I'm saying, look, despite the extreme extents of our complexity as a species, our methods of organization at this point are still a survival strategy that may fail. And I'm pointing out signs that maybe we had better rethink. We have all grown soft and comfortable in modern civilization where we are sheltered from the threats of death and discomfort. But we, as a species, are not out of ""the jungle"" yet. Our current survival strategy (industrial society) is only 200 years old, and is already showing signs of unsustainability. And unsustainability means failure.       We have the capacity, intelligent beings that we are, to observe the warning signals and course-correct. If we cannot do that, we will be selected against. Simple as that.   But for the rest of your post, I know what you mean. It takes people waking up to really make any change. Ha, and funny that you mention G. K.

They absolutely were dramatic events.  However, the intensity of these events is entirely perceptual. Think about your own life. How much of your reality you omit? How much of your second-to-second, moment-to-moment experience do you even remember? This is also true of our history. The history you're aware of is only the history that people with entirely different social priorities and ambitions cared to even document. Their perception of reality itself was different; the way we understand what they went through is far from the way they understood it.  In the reality we don't percieve, there are no critical events. Every event is important, like the butterfly effect you mention. Every moment is integral to the continued presence of reality. Every personal action has consequences for human existence. The movement of spacetime doesn't start or stop at our ability to recognize moments in it. We all flow relentlessly.  To say that this generation is somehow uniquely important is pure hubris. Self-delusion. A level of confidence we, as humanity, absolutely required to live the way we live and think the way we think to day. The significance we assign to these moments is important only to us. It's inherently self-feeding, because the only true(conscious or unconscious) concern of all life is to continue to exist.  The only significance our generation will ever have is the one we create."
Psychonaut,3dk575,Chispy,2,Fri Jul 17 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"Every generation has significance. We are not unique. However, we are very important to the current situation of the world, and historically speaking, this is an important time in the history of the world."

Psychonaut,3dk575,mrq1989,2,Fri Jul 17 06:07:50 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with a lot of your ideas. It correlates with a book I really would like you to read, if you haven't, called Ishmael. In that the author, through a fictional tale, proposes the ideas of there being Takers and Leavers. He references a staggering amount of history and links it to old tales and religions that seem to make a disturbing amount of sense, and which I think you'd resonate with. The book leaves you educated and stressing the importance of forwarding onward the message of your previous teacher (in this case the fictional character Ishmael), and his general lesson outlines a scientific approach to sustainable environmentalism for humanity, which I think he coined as neo tribalism. I left a lot of information out because I want you to be excited, shocked, and in awe if you read it. Based on what you've said I really think you'll find a lot of sense in it... And be more than nervous for the future. All we can do is apply our understanding to ourselves and share with anyone willing to listen."

It has become one of the most profound reads in my library and I'm sure you will enjoy it.  e: also check out the sequel ""My Ishmael"", where we see Ishmael's story from the perspective of a different student, a 13 (I think) year old girl, trying to learn how to save the world."

Psychonaut,3dk575,Tom_Anks,2,Fri Jul 17 12:01:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think of the internet as a wild card. It feels more like a catalyst.   Think of how similar ideas have shown up in different societies around the same time but on opposite sides of the world.   We understand that we are all connected. Any idea I have, you can have. I know you understand this because you tell others to freely take your ideas. Relinquishing ownership (but not responsibility) is a sign of understanding oneness.   The internet is speeding up the process of sharing ideas. Its also preparing the younger generation for rapid change. Older generations have a tough time with rapid change because they didn't have any practice with it. We, on the other hand, are almost living several lifetimes in one. Several relationships. Several jobs. Several ideas. Several transitions and shifts. Yes, the materialistic side was a part of that...but I think more importantly we are getting better at being able to fly from one idea to the next and discard the unreliable, useless, or harmful ones.   The global mind has been turned on. I think the next step is turning on the global heart.   Random acts of kindness. Pay it forward. Improve your self and your surroundings. You Dont need to worry if others are doing this. Just do it. Inspiration will follow.   ""Happiness is a disease we shall gladly carry, for we know it to be contagious. """
Psychonaut,3dk575,Tom_Anks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:07:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, very well said. That's an excellent point about getting better at moving through ideas and finding the good ones. And the emerging phenomenon of the global mind is really just amazing to witness (and completely unpredictable too!)  I do feel much of the same things that you do towards the emerginng situation. I also completely agree with the idea of passing on acts of kindness, and the whole mindset there (I'm a big fan of Buddhism).   I'd also be quick to point out as well though, the system that is emerging is in desperate need of novel means of self regulation, and new ways of organization. We aren't a standalone system, we exist within the bubble of complexity of the Earth and of the forces upon the biological organisms on it. And there we see all systems in crisis, while meanwhile humanity is undergoing an expirement (exponentially growing in both number and cognitive ability). I think it would be our mistake to assume that because of the extent of our complexity, that the system is destined for survival. This survival strategy, our species current strategy, could still be a wrong strategy that gets selected out of existence. We actually are only 200 (if you look at it one way), or 10,000 (looked at in another way) years into this expirement. When it underwent exponential growth, it was pushed into the point of hitting a moment of truth, where it is live or die.   But I also agree that much of the way forward lies in the type of thinking that you show. It just needs to make the leap into actually influencing our ways of organization."

Who is to say that didn't actually happen.  Also, and I say this with respect, the 4 generational wave is the ebb and flow of the idiots. The masters are always in a renaissance. The idiots have no conscious control over their actions. They ride the wave at the top and soon find it unimportant and let it sink back down. The good people keep the ship running in the night. Better to be a voice in the silence than another enthusiast at high tide. One should accept reality that things may be more conducive now, but if you let yourself fall below 100% and need an excuse to try, you're an idiot too and part of the problem.

It's hard to explain and I shouldn't force it on people, but if you're interested pm me and I'll try to explain it. Basically I foresee a particular future for the human race which, if we work toward it, will manifest the world humans have always dreamed to live in, using technology and spirituality working hand in hand.

It reminded me of my own thoughts which have some similarities to yours:  I was pondering on how I could best live my life to benefit the entire human race as a whole. I came to the conclusion that one of the best ways is to be a catalyst for positive change in human society. Not necessarily being the active leader of change, but instead inspiring a large amount of people to want change. Basically be a force multiplier for change.   One of the best ways to inspire positive changes in human society would be for more widespread psychedelic usage in my opinion. When taken with the right mindset and setting, they can be great tools for positive change in people."

But it's the most beautiful fluke that you and I are allowed to experience for the time we are on this planet. As far as we know, this is it. We are the only species of organism which are self aware that heavily manipulate the environment and psyche in which we live. Which, to some, may be looked upon as a bad thing, but have you ever considered that since we are alive and interconnected with the rest of this planet in more ways than you can imagine and since we are of the gigantic family tree of life that starts at the beginning of the first complex molecules forming in muck, developing into cells, then dividing and changing for billions of years down a single branch that leads from then all the way into your body as you read what I have typed out here for you, that our absolute purpose is to destroy enough of the environment that a large portion of our global population simply can't survive?   While it is a radical idea I personally prefer this next idea; We are the Earth. Our entire planet and all of the creatures and plants that live on it are one giant form of life. A global entity, if you will. And, like the initial cells that formed from the primordial soup of life, our entire meaning of being alive is to experience in order to learn in order to live in order to love.

Psychonaut,3dlys7,hashmon,3,Fri Jul 17 12:27:26 2015 UTC,"For simplicity's sake, here's something I posted here a couple years ago regarding my experiences. These experiences are only a drop in the bucket in comparison to the variety of things I've seen. My moral of the story that any newcomer should take from this is, do not expect.  My DMT experiences have varied quite vastly, and I would not dare discuss such things on my main account. Few people in my life would look at me in the same light if I were to share with them what I've experienced.  As I said, I've experienced many things. I've seen the expansive and endless ocean of colors that awaits many people who seek such things. I've meandered through the outer edges of my shut eyelids, watching as the darkness expands and is replaced by intricate threads that tie together all that is. Recently I was visited [or I visited him] a creature so majestically alien that even though I had his devout attention, no words could grace my mind to pull more from the experience. His stature was so large, yet welcoming, and his ""skin"" was made up of a crystalline substance that had such an unearthly glimmer to it I couldn't help but be overwhelmed by his presence.  I've melded with the current of a river, and even watched from above as my ""spirit"" has ascended to the upper stratosphere and away from our earth. I've had entities appear to put on a magnificent show for me, with the most vivid golden ribbons spiraling out and melding into the ethers, crafting intricate designs in their wake as they expand and grow. Just last night before bed, I smoked a small amount and saw a meteor traveling through the vastness of space as my consciousness seemed to somehow be tied to its path. This carried on to a very lucid ""dream"" where I appeared to have full control over the environment. Another time I stumbled upon a large mechanical city in the visage of a machine elf, and as I gave into the awe, I was pushed away into a negative space as if I were a trespasser who overstayed his welcome.  I've even had experiences that seem to be shared with other beings, where we've traveled along a starry, ribbon-laden path crafting streams of light as we skated through the atmosphere, until it was time for our paths to diverge. I've walked through gorgeous landscapes, open grassy fields with snowcapped mountains in the distance, picturesque like the most gorgeous New Zealand countryside.  I could go on for hours if I were to get into the details of these experiences. For anyone who cares to experience DMT themselves, just be sure to go into it with a clear head and a quiet environment. Close your eyes, relax your body, and allow the vastness of eternity to wash over you. Have no expectations, as the experience can vary so widely that you'll get to experience whatever it is that inner self desires. And above all else, exude respect for all that you experience."

Don't try to use anything material/external to create a self. It will only lead to disappointment. And don't worry about not having an identity. You don't actually need one. A common problem in our society is that we try to define and understand everything. But some things will never be understood. If you can live comfortably and happily then why try to make one thing into another. I hope this helps because I know how you feel."

Psychonaut,3dipku,Yazer25,2,Thu Jul 16 16:20:29 2015 UTC,"No, at that dose, the zyprexa won't take much if any away from the trip. I have tripped 5 times since being on zyprexa, same dose. And don't miss doses if you can, there's rebound anxiety, depression, weird feelings etc when your body doesn't get the olanzapine it craves. Although since you just started there's probably not much dependence yet.   Some advice from my heart and from a lot of frustration and misery... If the zyprexa is just for depression, and nothing psychotic or bipolar, please get off of it! It causes diabetes and other serious problems. The manufacturer, Eli Lily, lost the biggest pharmaceutical lawsuit ever because of hiding and lying about the horrible consequences of zyprexa. Plus, once your body and brain are used it it, it is very difficult to get off of it, and it can cause permanent damage. Seriously, this shit isn't something ""light"" like prozac, it binds to many many types of receptors in your brain and when you take the drug away your brain goes haywire and won't return to its pre-zyprexa state."
Psychonaut,3dipku,energymisdirected,4,Thu Jul 16 16:40:43 2015 UTC,Wow this is very interesting. My mom is diabetic and I'm already hypoglycemic so the last thing I need is anything that can cause that. I'll get off of it then and maybe look into another antidepressant if I still need it after tripping. Thanks for the advice.

Psychonaut,3dipku,1speedbike,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:52:31 2015 UTC,"Hey Yazer, I hope I can help. So there's a few things..   First, olanzapine isn't really indicated for depression. It's mainly used for schizophrenia and more rarely used for bipolar. If you have schizophrenia, I would honestly recommend against taking psychedelic drugs as they can exacerbate your symptoms. If you're taking it for a non psychotic disorder or symptomology, then you're a bit safer.   Second, you're on a pretty low dose of olanzapine. 2.5 mg is the starting dose before your doctor titrates you up. On top of that, it generally takes a few weeks to start getting the full benefit of it. And I'm not talking 2 weeks like an antidepressant. It could take up to 3 months in some cases to get full effects, so one week of olanzapine is almost nothing. That said, despite the short time you've been on it and the low dose, you a still have some in your system which will indeed block some of the more positive effects of psychedelic drugs - the straight up serotonin mediated effects.   The medically trained part of my brain is telling me ""don't do it if you have any history of psychotic symptoms."" However, if it were me, I would personally go ahead with it if you don't have an actual history of psychotic disorders. Then again I can be dumb when it comes to my own health and safety, and I can generally do things to myself that I would feel hesitant and even guilty to give a patient the ""okay""  for. I (personally) would increase the dosage of the shrooms by just a little bit to overcome any negating effects from the medication. I wouldn't go too high, though, because like I mentioned you're on a low dose and haven't been on it for long, so it's very hard to predict exactly how much the meds will interfere with the drugs. The worst that can (likely) happen is you just have an underwhelming trip. I say likely because I don't like to be definite when anything could honestly happen to anyone, not just you taking meds, when taking drugs for recreation.   However, it's also hard to predict without knowing what other medications, drugs, and medical conditions may also play a possible role in your trip.   I hope I helped a bit. Please let me know if you have any other questions and stay safe! Also note the above is personal opinion and not intended to be, or substitute for, formal medical advice from a trained clinician."
Psychonaut,3dipku,bigguss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:51:09 2015 UTC,I don't have schizophrenia. I have an autoimmune condition that causes anxiety and depression which is what led to the olanzapine. I read that the half life is about 36 hours so I'm thinking there's not going to be much in my system when I trip. I'm taking an eighth of some very good shrooms so the dose won't be overwhelming. Thanks for the advice.

Later on the news we heard at least 2 were killed stabbed.

Psychonaut,3dgv3l,jemaica,25,Thu Jul 16 04:13:06 2015 UTC,"The meaning is that there is none.   I was in the same place as you. Lost in a world of meaningless bullshit. Day by day living in a superficial world with a superficial population, who have immoral goals and no empathy for others. A family with no aspersions and no sense of other perspectives. I was depressed because of it, but far before psychedelics. It troubled me to the brink of suicide, but instead I turned to drugs.  I was 16-17, high every single day, trying pain pills to coke. But then one day I got my hands on psychedelics. I remember one of my first mushrooms trips all I did was cry and cry (in front of my friends which is a big deal) and cry some more. I realized my sadness with the world, and how helpless I felt. I saw no opportunity, or will for opportunity. I was, in my mind, in a world of meaningless suffering.   While I was crying, my phone was blowing up, and I had to make a drug deal. I got up and did it, having them drop me off a couple blocks away from my buddies house where I was tripping.   I wandered the streets, knowing the way back, but not ready to go back. I walked the block around and around, still not ready to go back. I sped up and felt the wind on my face, then began running. I felt great. I felt like nothing in the world mattered, besides right then, just me running. I made 4-5 more loops before I had another deal to do.   Afterwards I returned to my friends house with a little cash in pocket, but also a new perception. In this completely meaningless world, you make meaning. You create your own perception of the world. Now I look at the world with a new, almost selfish perspective. I live for me, I live to enjoy as much happiness as I can before the day I stop breathing. I live to feel the wind in my face, and the grind under my feet.   You need to realize nothing matters, at all. But you need to find the perception of happiness. You need to live for the small things, and live for you.  To add on to that, next time you trip, go into nature. Just sit and be one with it. Let your mind mix into your surroundings. Look around. See the beauty that is here for us. Look at the colors of birds, the motion of the trees in the wind. Look at the water that trickles on seamlessly. This is our origin, this is our home. It's all that you need. Happiness doesn't come through material or events, but through how we perceive the world around us.   You can say oh look a bird, or go a step further and imagine all that it took that it took to make that bird. You can think all the way through evolution, but go even further. To the beginning if the universe. But why not further. Why do physics work the way they do? And there's never an end to the questions, in the same way that searching for happiness is a never ending loop.   You need to realize, happiness comes through your view of the world, and nothing else.   If you need anything else, pm me. I can go for days. I wish you the best on your journey"

At first it made me a happier, more contented person for a period of time... it made me appreciate this world a bit more, but as these feelings of joy and enlightenment started to fade away, I found the same awareness beginning to turn around and haunt me -- I'm more aware of how lonely people can feel, I'm more aware of how everyone is a zombie on the morning to work, running on the treadmill of life but forever stuck on the same spot, I'm more aware of how nothing really matters at all, how everything is but a dream/illusion and these thoughts that I'm thinking are pointless anyway... they're like echoes of my desperate cries ringing in an infinitely dark space. It's hard to deal with these feelings. Some nights when these emotions get overwhelming, I have troubles falling asleep, and wake up feeling shittier than the day before.

The body is the 5 senses, the mind thinks, the soul is.  You are all that is.   Nothing is fake, are you fake? It's all real, as long as you are conscious, for it is impossible to be conscious of being unconscious.  There is nothing wrong with the ego, it has it's purpose, that's why it exists. Everything has purpose.   People sell books to make money and share information, whether or not that information applies to you is for you to decide, their intentions matter not. Books are ideas and experiences, unless you've written one, they may or may not be yours.   There is nothing wrong with desire, I feed my body, mind and soul through experience. There is nothing wrong with using every aspect of life to bring it to it's fullest."

There is alot of fakeness in this world but that is ok. We are still an evolving species and with the emergence of the great teachers (psychedelics) humans will be able to move past this stage in humanity towards a beautiful nirvana where all people live comfortably and with love in their hearts.

Fortunately, there are a lot of new ongoing studies that hope to answer some of these questions. I think the more important question is, what do you define as ""false"", and in the end, does it really matter when the experiences we have with psychedelics can improve our lives?"
Psychonaut,3dgl68,mootball,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:14:03 2015 UTC,"Would it matter if they were?  If there was nothing afterwards, you wouldn't know the difference.

You were stars, dust, earth, scattered across the universe long before you were human.  You will be scattered again in time, and you will wake up again in time, just as you did in this life."
Psychonaut,3dgl68,mootball,5,Thu Jul 16 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"Well all of that is valid if you subscribe to the idea that the physical world is real and it's your brain that produces consciousness rather than picks up consciousness. And from my experience with the connectivity between consciousnesses it looks much more likely that our brains are receivers rather than producers of consciousness.  Also, if you think of yourself as your mind, your ego, your body, if only that is you and not also me and all the rest of everything, then death is something to fear. Because of course when you die you die, personality, memories, desires, all of that will go. But that's not what makes you you. You are the observer behind the scenery, the energy behind the matter, and that is eternal.  And of course it's a mask, another illusion we don, anything you ever hold in your mind is merely an abstraction of the truth. So the things we learn through psychedelics aren't exactly true, they are just other ideas, other perspectives. And some of them make the world subjectively better, which is ultimately what matters to the perceiving individual."

Psychonaut,3dgl68,DranoTheCat,3,Thu Jul 16 03:26:33 2015 UTC,"That's my point. Your line of reasoning only makes sense if you think the physical world is real.   This leads me to believe that DMT is simply a materialistic thing. What we experience during the release is just another bodily function, another thing our bodies do like clockwork.   What exactly is a materialistic thing? What exactly is just another bodily function? It's perfectly okay for you to be lead to believe that DMT is 'simply' a materialistic thing, but that's a skew only for you. If consciousness were to exist outside the body, then having some kind of OBE / DMT plane experience is surely as close as we have to post mortem conscious existence."

Psychonaut,3dgl68,kidzstreetball,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:20:15 2015 UTC,"Right.  I feel that believing the brain originates consciousness is like believing our bodies originate gravity.  We fall down, go boom.  We have ego, and think we are individual."
Psychonaut,3dgl68,DranoTheCat,3,Thu Jul 16 03:32:25 2015 UTC,"Well, what is it you think that DMT does?  And let's say it's just another bodily function, another thing our bodies do like clockwork.  So?  Posit that DMT, or disciplined meditation or spirituality, allows you to separate from your ego, and stop seeing your consciousness as if you were confined to your body and mind; originating from you.  And posit that once freed from the illusion our minds model, we are able to perceive things differently.  Call it hyperspace, the spirit world, another dimension, whatever.  So I don't think we're talking about DMT somehow moving your molecules somewhere else.  We're talking about breaking down the part of your mind that insists ""you"" is a singular, individual thing, and not simply part of the greater consciousness whole.  I think DMT, at breakthrough doses, allows you to experience consciousness without the ego mind telling you what is ""you"" and what is ""other"".  It's really difficult to explain, other than experiencing it.  But I think once you do, once you grok what ""I am"" means, then a contentedness will follow.   Contentedness, btw.  Inner peace.  NOT optimism."

And in this state our destroyed ego, the overwhelming common experience is to see the oneness of consciousness.  It is only our perception, yes, but what is more real than our perception?  We have a multitude of senses, many probably not understood yet.  Reality is the model we build out of our perceptions.  I think the bigger question is, can we grow, mature, and expand our minds based on these perceptions?    It is a pity we do not do extensive science into this area.  Until then, I don't care what is ""real"" or not.  I care about the value of my model to predict, comprehend, and acheive personal peace."

There's something about the Human experience which makes me feel like we're dumb/limited and so DMT has to be provided to us on a level we can first understand, but that doesn't make it any less sacred.

Psychonaut,3de84b,alittlenewtothis,16,Wed Jul 15 16:09:37 2015 UTC,"If anyone wishes to come to a deep state of insight, meditation is an absolute necessity. I believe it ""enhances"" the trip experience in a simple way. Here I take ""enhancement"" to mean that the experience is accompanied by greater clarity and insight (i.e. understanding).  First we must ask what ""enhance"" means in this context, and what are the factors leading to greater insight. I'm gonna go and say my trips are enhanced when, for one, I stay ""grounded"". Staying grounded means that the weird trip thoughts, emotions, and images do not necessarily ""pull me"" away from the present moment. For example, often times sober or not, we are chilling are our computer, mindfully writing a comment reply or something, and then a sensory input (whether it be a sight, smell, sound) enters our consciousness and triggers a cognitive or affective reaction. Maybe I hear my little brother yell something to my mom, and what he said makes me think of X, and X makes me think of Y, etc. Until, I am no longer writing a comment but have been carried off into some imagined past or future. This is what I call becoming ""ungrounded"" (a very rough definition, I know). Becoming ungrounded in this way, by chasing every thought and emotion, takes us away from our present experience and thus clouds the mind. And when we trip, oh boy, is this process many times more powerful and confusing!  Secondly, enhancement is accompanied by clarity. Clarity means a clear, lucid, awareness of the present contents of consciousness. It does not matter so much whats in the mind, as the extent and depth to which we are clearly aware of it. In a trip, when we can maintain awareness of the changing contents of consciousness, of how thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations are constantly changing, effecting, and being effected by other thoughts, emotions, and sensations, we begin to see with radical and piercing insight.   Bring this full circle now, we must ask what effects does meditation have on the mind? Of course, there are many effect that meditation practice has, but in short Groundedness and Clarity are two of the chief effects. Meditation practice coupled with psychedelics, in my experience, has greatly enhanced by trips because of the presence of these two factors. For instance, meditating before a DMT trip totally changes the experience for me, because I equip my self with a firm, open, and lucid awareness.   One of the chief ways it helps me is by changing my relationship with fear. When we trip, we get a lot of fucking weird thoughts, many of which can be frightening! If we are not grounded and clear in our minds, these strange thoughts can cause great fear and confuse us, as we identify with the contents of the mind. And, as many of us know, a good trip can turn into a weird one can turn into a bad one real fast, as a couple of fearful thoughts can send us on a downward spiral of negative and dark thoughts in a hurry. Meditation allows us to be aware enough to see these dark thoughts when they first manifest, hold them in clear awareness, stay grounded in our bodies and the present moment, and ultimately see that they are impermanent and we let them pass. Meditation removes much of the fear, and, in fact, helps us cultivate greater joy and openness; all essential to a ""enhanced trip""."

Psychonaut,3de84b,VertigoLFC,6,Wed Jul 15 17:51:35 2015 UTC,"[x-post from /r/meditation earlier today]  The most commonly referred to book is Mindfulness in Plain English. It'll give you a solid understanding of what you're going for. Then there's The Ten Stages of Meditation, which will help you pace yourself.   Basically it boils down to this.    Sit with your back straight and unsupported.  The body is like a glass of water, and thoughts are like sediment. Motion stirs the sediment into the water. Be still, and the water will become clear.  Goal: to maintain undisturbed focus on a single point.  Strategy: Focus on a rhythmic point within yourself, the breath, the heart. Choose one point on which to focus all attention on. For instance the nose, where the breath first enters and leaves the body.  Obstacle: Thoughts will continuously distract you from achieving your goal. Don't be discouraged. As you begin your training, know that every time you catch yourself lost in thought you're doing the equivalent of a mental pushup.  The longer you sit, the better the results.  First step to master, sit every day. Doesn't matter how long it is.    This is the first stage. The second stage involves taking that ability to focus on a single point, and turning it towards your awareness of your surroundings.  [/x-post]  When it comes to meditating on shrooms: picture a pendulum being tugged every which way. This is the mind, and the forces making the pendulum swing are thoughts. Meditation trains you to let go of attachment to these thoughts, so that the pendulum can be still. When you meditate on shrooms, see it as taking a magnet to the pendulum and pulling it down. Boom. Once you start to lift the veil just a little bit, the rest comes intuitively. You may stumble a bit on the way as you realize the obvious and have to come to terms. Congratulate yourself maybe. Eventually you'll discard all of this and refocus your attention and lift the veil completely."

The Buddha taught, and I believe, that the breath is the only meditation object that can bring the seeker through both the stages of calming/serenity meditation (called samatha in Buddhism) and then lead into insight meditation (vipassana). Furthermore, it is a wonderfully pleasant object that is with us all the time! Breath can be a powerful practice, and its changed my life profoundly.  http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1797/"

Paradoxically, it frees you to push the limits and play with fire since you know you have a backup plan.

Meditation allows you the ability of clear and unencumbered self awareness, awsreness of many subtle mind processes that operate in you, and the abity to just let everything settle down and experience the state of still, clear perception with no mind distraction.   I think that if your interested in this sort of stuff, taking up meditation is a must."
Psychonaut,3de84b,OrbitRock,3,Wed Jul 15 21:56:09 2015 UTC,"in short, yes, absolutely.   i am a beginner at meditation, but life circumstances had made me realise i really fucking need to learn to do it and just keep at it. i try to practice mindfulness throughout the day as much as i can, just being present, not judging thoughts and feelings, but rather feeling them fully when they come and thus seeing them for what they are. this practice (that naturally isn't constant, i'm not a monk, i have anxiety and i'm depressed) absolutely made it into tripping. i also fuck about with some mantra meditation (made up my own word for it, sounds a bit sanskrit lol) and chanting OM. at first it's just annoying but if you keep at it it shows it's power. i first had a glance at this when i did my mantra after smoking quite some hash. i had visuals.   so tripping itself: it got easier, smoother, and even more introspective. i'm partially using psychs for healing and such, haven't had a trip in 6 months, now i tried 1p-lsd for the first time a few days ago. basically little to no thought looping - that's one benefit. it's just amazing how much more present i was even when i completely forgot about everything (some stage of ego death or moments of infinity, you know)..  the last time tripping was this smooth was when i first did full on doses years ago and didn't really have anxiety or depression and such and it was all new and wonderful.  for me the comeup is still a bit difficult - and in general the trip is physically very demanding and difficult b/c of the state that my body is in and my general (lack of)health and well-being, and naturally there are difficult moments and some fear (tripping alone, weird noises, critters, cars, etc), but i feel like my increased presence made it absolutely worthwhile.   when i was actually afraid of something, i was able to make a conscious decision not to judge or try and shoo away that fear,  but feel it completely and be with it and check out whatever's bothering me - which 99% of the time turns out to be non-threatening of course and i feel so good afterwards. i remember years ago when we did large doses with a friend and smoked a lot of weed with it, i didn't have this ability, fear was menacing and although i only had bad or difficult times when i accidentally overdosed, i usually wasn't able to fully break through fear. now i absolutely am. still feel it, but it doesn't fuck with me.  also, i feel like it's very important to point out that imo tripping is basically the best opportunity to practice and learn and integrate meditation/mindfulness/presence into life. this is because (at least for me) if you're not present while having a full-on trip, stuff from your mind is manifested and since you aren't paying proper attention, you can believe, make up, all sorts of ridiculous things about what you're experiencing. i know that's supposed to be just tripping and i still get it, but not quite as much. i can be more present and it's a beautiful exercise - just try it, trust me, if you focus on presence the trip (your mind) will literally thank you for it and show you things that you'd never see if you were just casually tripping and not paying attention to this. also you can actually feel your own consciousness, your inner presence, with a lot less ego in the picture (or none at all) which is something most people only experience in leap years and if they have it while tripping a lot of them freak out.   TLDR presence is like a muscle, if you exercise it it will become stronger and it will translate into everything, including your trips, and so you become much more 'sober' and calm while tripping. : )  sorry if it's a bit weird, second language!"
Psychonaut,3de84b,rrretarded_cat,2,Thu Jul 16 14:10:40 2015 UTC,"It is absolutely vital to be somewhat proficient or acquainted with meditation practices in order to experience ego death (with most psychedelic drugs). The difference between tripping with and without meditation is like the difference between tasting the salt and being the salt. It's hard to explain, but meditation takes you much deeper in your trips, while not using mindfulness or meditation practices will usually make for a shallow/more shallow experience."
Psychonaut,3de84b,Corndog_Enthusiast,2,Thu Jul 16 01:21:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I find meditation is essential, but I don't think it needs to be some strict, formal thing. Just take some time to relax and turn everything off. I don't think position matters much. Just stop doing things for a while. Thoughts come, let them float away... Cannabis helps me a lot with it; meditation becomes very natural."
Psychonaut,3de84b,hashmon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:18:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. Meditation in preparation for a trip is, on some level, a bit like cleaning up your house before a guest arrives. First, it has the practical purpose of of minimizing unfortunate distractions. Just like you wouldn't want your guest to stumble upon your dirty undies or a stinky pile of old pizza boxes stashed in the corner -- meditation may help you discover ahead of time some of the more unpleasant thoughts that might be lurking just below the surface of your mind.   It also conveys a certain degree of respect that I think is good with psychedelics. They are like teachers, in a way, and you will get more out of the experience by taming the jumbled mess of thoughts that would only serve to derail your ""lesson.""  Edit: I would also recommend literally cleaning your home beforehand."

But I would imagine they are completely different. i dunno, when I take shrooms its identical to LSD. First thing i start noticing is some visual snow in my peripheral vision, vibrating slowly. Then I start feeling a rush of energy take over which soon follows with the giggles and a general sense of euphoria. The energy feeling takes over my mind, too after that and my mind starts racing with thoughts. This feeling stays and the visuals start to increase over the next few hours, making things look liquidy, colorful, immensely sharp and detailed, along with CEVs and depending on dosage OEVs of geometric/liquidy patterns of varying complexity. This describes the start of both an LSD trip and Shroom trip for me."
Psychonaut,3dfz7l,XD003AMO,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:33:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Have you taken higher doses of mushrooms, like four to five grams? Also, do you do caffeine/coffee? If so, try it without.   FYI, MDMA is super different from DXM. You don't want to overdue it, but but it's an unbelievably positive and psychedelic experience."
Psychonaut,3dfz7l,hashmon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:09:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've taken around 5gs. I drink soda constantly to the point where I legitimately feel nothing from caffeine anymore at all. I could drink two cups of coffee and fall asleep 20 mins later (I know this from experience). I know DXM is vastly different from MDMA, but MDMA floods the brain with serotonin which is part of why you feel so good. DXM releases serotonin as well, just not as much, and even with DXM I went into serotonin syndrome and started seizing on the floor, worst experience of my life. MDMA would probably kill me if DXM was able to cause that for me as MDMA is one of the most powerful serotonin releasing agents there is.  http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/serotonin-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20028946"

Psychonaut,3dfliv,DranoTheCat,3,Wed Jul 15 22:00:36 2015 UTC,"My acts are sincere but they are only the acts of an actor because everything I do is controlled folly. Everything I do in regard to myself and my fellow men is folly, because nothing matters.  Certain things in your life matter to you because they're important; your acts are certainly important to you, but for me, not a single thing is important any longer, neither my acts nor the acts of any of my fellow men. I go on living though, because I have my will. Because I have tempered my will throughout my life until it's neat and wholesome and now it doesn't matter to me that nothing matters. My will controls the folly of my life.  Once a man learns to see he finds himself alone in the world with nothing but folly. Your acts, as well as the acts of your fellow men in general, appear to be important to you because you have learned to think they are important.  We learn to think about everything, and then we train our eyes to look as we think about the things we look at. We look at ourselves already thinking that we are important. And therefore we've got to feel important! But then when a man learns to see, he realizes that he can no longer think about the things he looks at, and if he cannot think about what he looks at everything becomes unimportant. Everything is equal and therefore unimportant.   We need to look with our eyes to laugh. When our eyes see, everything is so equal that nothing is funny. My laughter, as well as everything I do is real but it also is controlled folly because it is useless; it changes nothing and yet I still do it.  One must always choose the path with heart in order to be at one's best, perhaps so one can always laugh.  You don't understand me now because of your habit of thinking as you look and thinking as you think. By ""thinking"" I mean the constant idea that we have of everything in the world. Seeing dispels that habit and until you learn to see you will not really understand what I mean.  Our lot as men is to learn. I have learned to see and I tell you that nothing really matters. A man of knowledge lives by acting, not by thinking about acting, nor by thinking about what he will think when he has finished acting. A man of knowledge chooses a path with heart and follows it; and then he looks and rejoices and laughs; and then he sees and knows. He knows that his life will be over altogether too soon; he knows that he, as well as everybody else, is not going anywhere; he knows, because he sees, that nothing is more important than anything else. In other words, a man of knowledge has no honor, no dignity, no family, no name, no country, but only life to be lived, and under these circumstances his only tie to his fellow men is his controlled folly. Thus a man of knowledge endeavors, and sweats, and puffs, and if one looks at him he is just like any ordinary man, except that the folly of his life is under control. Nothing being more important than anything else, a man of knowledge chooses any act, and acts it out as if it matters to him. His controlled folly makes him say that what he does matters and makes him act as if it did, and yet he knows that it doesn't; so when he fulfills his acts he retreats in peace, and whether his acts were good or bad, or worked or didn't, is in no way part of his concern.  You think about your acts, therefore you have to believe your acts are as important as you think they are, when in reality nothing of what one does is important. Nothing! But then if nothing really matters, as you ask me, how can I go on living? It would be simple to die; that's what you say and believe, because you're thinking about life, just as you're thinking now what seeing would be like. You want me to describe it to you so you can begin to think about it, the way you do with everything else. In the case of seeing, however, thinking is not the issue at all, so I cannot tell you what it is like to see. Now you want me to describe the reasons for my controlled folly and I can only tell you that controlled folly is very much like seeing; it is something you cannot think about."

Psychonaut,3ddrnq,beneath_the_bottom,5,Wed Jul 15 14:03:30 2015 UTC,"I think any solution takes some awareness and practice, but there's two paths I have learned. One is: change your thoughts. Intentionally turn your mind to something pleasant, something that makes you feel good. The other one relates to this:   ""But there are times where certain experiences trigger certain feelings and I lose that ""spaciousness"" and end up buying into all these negative thoughts that constantly pour in and prevent me from living in the now."" Negative experiences that aren't ""processed"" are ""stuffed"". Unfortunately, our culture teaches us this method. These stored emotions then come out when triggered by external stimuli. They can cause us to act inappropriately, ""blow up"", or experience the trauma again. This is what PTSD is about. Most of us have this, but on a lower level. The good news is, you can do something about it. The first step is becoming aware of how you feel inside. When you are alone and quiet, listen to your feelings, and honor them. There are many techniques to get in touch with, and move this energy. Therapy, entheogens, EFT, etc. Then as the feelings are brought up, we need to really experience them. This is usually somewhat scarey, but is really not bad at all. This may need to be repeated, but eventually the trauma dissipates, leaving you feeling better."
Psychonaut,3ddrnq,Jim_E_Hat,2,Wed Jul 15 14:39:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. This helps, I've been trying not to 'push away' the feeling but rather honor it and accept how this stored up energy actually feels. I'll work with it"

Psychonaut,3ddrnq,Jim_E_Hat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"You're most welcome. Something I've been hearing about is micro-dosing entheogens. I was originally put off by this, thinking ""if I'm gonna do the stuff, I wanna feel it. But it seems like it can be used for exactly what we are trying to do:       The use of low doses often can be much more effective in dealing with our “psychic garbage.” Many do not care for low doses because they can stir up uncomfortable feelings, and they prefer to transcend them by pushing on into higher states, but it is precisely these uncomfortable feelings that must be resolved to achieve true freedom.  With low doses, by focusing directly on the feelings and staying with them without aversion and without grasping, they will in time dissipate. Resolving one’s repressed feelings in this manner clears the inner being, permitting the True Self to manifest more steadily. Such a result provides greater energy, deeper peace, more perceptive awareness, greater clarity, keener intuition, and greater compassion. It permits the deepening of one’s meditation practice. The surfacing of buried feelings that this procedure permits often can bring new understanding of one’s personality dynamics.       Hey, and there's a subreddit too!"
Psychonaut,3ddrnq,tanvanman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of experience with this, and I'd agree that micros activate your ""stuff"", and that welcoming and ""merging"" with the uncomfortable feelings is extremely helpful.   Here are a couple elements that I've found critical to this approach:  First, when you start to allow and ""go into"" discomforts, the body has a tendency to contract, which is often said to be the body's habitual response to protecting you from difficult feelings, such as the ones that are likely at the heart of the contraction. The key to dealing with this is to gradually and gently ease into the contraction. Taking the alpha, I'm-gonna-fix-this-approach tends to keep you stuck in contraction and resistance. Ease, love, acceptance are so important.  Second, I can't express how valuable it is to practice having some sort of a larger context to ""dissolve"" these feelings into. Whether it be the vastness of space, or consciousness, or the entire sensory field, or...? Usually these uncomfortable feelings have been around for a long time, consciously or not, and are related to ""frozen"" patterns of thought. If we dive into these feelings they may dissolve on their own, but there's just as much chance that they can become obsessive thought/feeling loops. In such a case, it's really helpful to be able to zoom out to a much broader perspective and let the feelings diffuse into a bigger context - essentially diving into the feeling, but then broadening attention to permit it to be an ice cube dissolving into the ocean. (My other comment in this thread mentions a great resource)"

Psychonaut,3ddrnq,OrbitRock,2,Wed Jul 15 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"This is the primary concern of all spiritual systems and practices. That we gain consciousness, but then lapse back into lower ways of being.   Buddhism is a very good methodology IMO. I do some Vipassana practice, meditation really helps for this sort of thing, and the insight practices can be really transformative. Some good sources on Buddhist insight meditation are: Mindfulness in plain English, and the book downloads available on this site (the ones you should read if you do are ""dont look down on the defilements"" and ""awareness alone is not enough"". They are good basic but thorough introductions for a beginner or anyone practicing).   I also study a system called the Fourth Way. This one very directly adresses the issue of higher and lower states of consciousness and the issue of lapsing back into lower states. The insight that studying this will give you into the issue of lower states and the potential development of consciousness is, imho, unparalleled. There is a lot of stuff found here that is not found in many other places. The primary concern of this one is self observation to understand lower states and how they manifest in you, and developing the ability to bring yourself into higher states more often. There are some strange ideas associated with it (tbh I get the feel that it is meant to be baffling at times), but if you ignore the esoteric metaphysical claims and stick to the parts about psychological self observation, you can learn some very important things regarding the issue you bring up. Here's a good primer on the type of ideas in it: http://montalk.net/metaphys/117/stages-of-conscious-awakening, and if it interests you beyond that, let me know, I can recommend some reading (it can be hard to break into at first but I have some good books for starting out with it)."

You can take steps to eliminate both kinds of tension! I have anxiety that was at one point debilitating to like every thought and action. This technique has turned into my go-to for eliminating all sorts of tension. (If you're good at it and you're smart, it can even sometimes work on other people... Think music.)  So basically, breathe. That is your #1! Your breath is everything! Every cell in your body reacts to your breath physically and chemically. It's quite an amazing process that I'm hoping to learn as much as I can about. When we're stressed, our breathing tends to slow. Our lung space and diaphragm get smaller and tense. Our entire body will reflect this change. Your muscles will want oxygen, your already stressed thoughts will spiral and become less manageable. You're panicking. There's no reason to panic, though. There's never a reason to panic. The only difference between you stressed and you not stressed is your physical state. So change it.   Slow down a bit. Stop what you're doing if you can. Take the time to correct this imbalance because chances are you can. Deep breaths. Feel it everywhere. Feel it relaxing your muscles everywhere. Feel it calming your mind. Your body will get used to this. It will understand calming down as well as it understands stressing out.   Anxiety is a product of prolonged tension in the mind. Mental stress building over time. There is a built up physical response as well, and the two are very connected. Resolve them both. You can do it."

Psychonaut,3d9k2e,Encie,41,Wed Jul 15 04:15:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, very similar.  4 trips (Roughly quarterly, 1 LSD, 3 shrooms) and cannabis+hiking, over the course of a year, got me to the most positive mindset I've ever had.   Lost 40 lbs, found an amazing girlfriend, started saving money aggressively, and in 2-3 months I'll be quitting to go full time on my own businesses.  It is 100% absolutely completely ridiculous that all these things are illegal."
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,justmanthings,9,Tue Jul 14 18:26:21 2015 UTC,Do you really think our society would be structured the way it is if psychedelics were legal?  Acid melts through plastic - Chance the Rapper
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,AcidCyborg,5,Wed Jul 15 02:20:38 2015 UTC,We already got a little preview of it in the '60s and '70s when the powers that be had no option but to clamp down on all psychedelics so that their fear-driven version of society would have no obstacles.

Psychonaut,3d9k2e,AvengeTheEve,9,Tue Jul 14 15:50:24 2015 UTC,Thanks man =) it's been an experience to find that discipline within myself. I honestly wasn't sure I had it.
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,cyberprodigy,24,Tue Jul 14 16:00:57 2015 UTC,You're the man dude. You are doing what many people including myself find great difficulty in doing - actually integrating a trip into your daily life. It's easy to trip and have all these brilliant revelations on how to improve your life but the most difficult part is actually doing it. Congrats man.
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,skeefes,19,Tue Jul 14 16:44:03 2015 UTC,"it helped me realize this as well, the only limits we have as humans are our thoughts. thoughts impose all limits. lsd frees you from your deep engraved neuro-pathways and shows you, clearly, almost like someone shoving it in your face. you are limitless and perfect."
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,sula711,14,Tue Jul 14 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"Sweet!  I've found that the best way to stick with something like this, is to give up all expectations of yourself and just be in the moment with it.  As for exercise, move your body for fun.  Work hard and sweat and challenge yourself, but always go with the flow.  Don't force anything and keep listening to your body from a deeper place.  Put no pressure on yourself and you will find you keep coming back for more because of the emotional/spiritual high you get.  Just like playing as a little kid."

Psychonaut,3d9k2e,jeexbit,13,Tue Jul 14 17:40:05 2015 UTC,"Had the same realisation only it was weed for me (never tried acid). Lost about 96 pounds. Now I'm experimenting with weighttraining (I lost the weight by cardio only) so I'm gaining weight right now. Keep going! You can achieve your own goals (as if you don't already realized and know that) For me the sudden thought entered my mind: 'All I did in the past shaped the me, I am right now. I have power to change some habits and by doing what I do now I'm shaping my future me.'"
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,Baggabones88,7,Tue Jul 14 17:23:55 2015 UTC,Shine on!
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,DranoTheCat,8,Tue Jul 14 16:51:50 2015 UTC,"Right on, buddy! Keep it up! My last acid trip was quite similar. I'm down 70 lbs. and am still a little overweight, but I feel healthy and more confident. And, you're correct, we are our own worst enemies at times. Weight loss is hard, and it took me about 4 years of talking about doing something, then I did something. Got a gym membership, quit eating at night, and chose healthier meals. I've been overweight most of my adult life, and haven't really got much attention from women. Now I get a fair amount of attention and people treat me differently. What to do with that attention...I don't know. I still see myself as the fat guy, but I'm working on it. One of the best things I took from taking acid was that I needed to find a way to love myself. I was filled with self-loathing since I was a teenager. I'm now at a place where, even though I suck at certain aspects of life, I can look in the mirror and say ""you're a fucking badass, man. Even if nobody else knows it yet."" Congratulations, again, man!"
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,phychonaut4seen,7,Tue Jul 14 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"Great job!  Keep it up :)  I have gone on a similar journey over the past few years.  Being more physically fit has changed my tripping in ways I couldn't imagine before.  Beyond the fun of being active with Lucy, I also find my thinking and visuals are better.  Shine on :-)"
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,Becomethesun,5,Tue Jul 14 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"This made me really happy reading these comments. It brings a smile to my face seeing all the good LSD can do when treated with respect and care.  For me, I was struggling with depression, a lack of direction and a sense of being 'lost'.  I released the most important thing in life is to be happy, because that's all that matters :) Positive vibrations and thoughts can actually turn into reality ! LSD opened my eyes to this. I went from being an everyday stay-at-home introvert stoner, to studying psychology at university and now have a job and an amazing girlfriend. I'm studying psychology because I want to understand the human mind and what makes it tick. Its actually really interesting :)  I decided to study psychology during an LSD trip, I thought this is my vocation. To go into the science world and help make better understandings of psychedelics effects on this mind.  both spiritual and therapeutical. I want to eventually do a pHD like my father and contribute to the world of science, with a strong focus on the mostly uncharted territory of psychedelics used in a therapeutic and healing scenes in psychology. Kind of like MDMA therapy but with acid :)"
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,tRedditAccount,4,Tue Jul 14 19:56:06 2015 UTC,"Have you checked out the organization MAPS? If not you should visit their website. I've chosen to take a very similar path, and it makes me happy to see other like minded people! The use of these drugs as therapy tools is something our society is desperately in need of."
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,JagsLikeFapper,5,Tue Jul 14 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"I do! I started taking acid to better myself about a year ago and tripped about 5 times from then but the last trip I had was about 4 weeks ago. Every time I trip I realise more about what the drug does to me, but the time before that I realised it lets me see everything with a fresh perspective.  Always been struggling with getting fit, always been a bit overweight since primary school. I've had bursts of motivation but lasted no longer than a week. I decided to think seriously about myself as a primal animal in the last trip. I'm still figuring out what it is, but it's like I connected to my primal spirit in this last trip I had (not literally, just best way to describe it). Ever since then I've gone for runs about 5 times a week and weight training about 2, enjoy the fuck out of it every time. I love pushing myself when I run. I no longer live to eat, but I eat to live and pleasure myself sometimes. I'll be starting going to gym now that I'm back at work. I'm so happy that I discovered this part of myself because I've always wanted to get fit but lacked this motivation that I never knew I needed."
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,Neur0ns,4,Tue Jul 14 22:23:56 2015 UTC,"Great to hear and good on you for actually taking action after your realization!!! Integration into daily life is where the real ""work"" is."
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,Neur0ns,4,Tue Jul 14 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"Hey man I'm curious, how many hits you've taken to get that realization. I've gotten my own realization within my trips but disciplining myself with food has been an issue I've been working on. Although I am getting better. I hope to follow through like you do man and congrats."
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,AcidCyborg,5,Tue Jul 14 17:21:59 2015 UTC,"Hey man. I know the struggle. It was my 6-7th time taking acid, and I started the day with two tabs, and then took another two about 5 hours later. So it was a pretty intense trip. I had the revelation on the first two, though, and then kind of decided, well hell, it's been a constructive time, might as well continue.   I should mention though; while the trip was what gave me the initial motivation, I haven't tripped since then. It's not like it's acid that keeping me on the path. Honestly my biggest issue is that I was (am?) an utter carb addict. So practically all I ate were those empty calories. French fries, mashed potatoes, etc etc. The real thing that has made the biggest difference for me in the actual weight loss journey has been that I started on Keto. You limit carbs and sugar to the point where your body switches into a different mode (ketosis) and starts looking to burn fat for energy preferentially instead of sugar. You can check out /r/keto, they're super supportive and there's a ton of information. I lost 25lbs in my first month, and honestly hardly even want to eat like crap anymore. Like I said, for me,  once you start seeing that progress, you never want to stop.   I seriously never thought that I would be able to get to the point that I am right now. It's not easy. You need to make sacrifices. But you can do it, dude. Trust me."
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,Neur0ns,2,Tue Jul 14 17:38:56 2015 UTC,"Yes of course. I just plan on tripping in the summer till school starts, but I imagine those realizations can become very strong motivators especially cause I always look back on my trips throughout my daily life. I'm planning on tripping on 300ug by myself soon.   Thanks for the diet advice, I have a friend who has practiced this diet as well with great result. I think I will look into it if what I am currently doing isn't working. I find that I just love eating big portions. So I'm working on disciplining myself to be okay with good portion while still not trying to change my diet too much cause of culture/family, but if I don't reach my goals like this, I will definitely look into this as I hear of much success and I don't plan on giving up.   Thanks for your reply friend, good luck on your endeavors!"
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,AcidCyborg,2,Tue Jul 14 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"More tabs =/= more, or better, realizations. Those come from within, you need only to unlock them.   I too have had success with keto. It works for weight loss, and requires no exercise. Exercise is just a lot of fun."
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,rolledrick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:23:46 2015 UTC,"Would it not increase the possibility of a realization? I feel like getting into a deeper trip could stretch me in ways I haven't been pushed to stretch before.  However I never try expect anything, I just go with it.  I see, that sounds perfect for me. I'd prefer to lose weight through eating."

Psychonaut,3d9k2e,MuchoMaas49,3,Tue Jul 14 19:52:08 2015 UTC,It is so great to hear you used it as a tool for self-improvement!  Congrats on your progress!
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,gunnercobra,3,Tue Jul 14 18:26:56 2015 UTC,"Yep! Keeping it short bc I'm on mobile phone...  Used to have depression, like really really bad depression... I was too worried about how others around me were succeeding and how I was not. Constantly worrying about how others were passing me by only made it worse for myself. Acid allowed me to finally realize that I need to worry about myself first. So I started doing things to benefit me. Went back to school, finished up and graduated with honors, now working on my Masters!"
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,fearachieved,3,Tue Jul 14 20:57:39 2015 UTC,"That's awesome dude. I""m still fat (and I've put on some added weight recently,) but the height of my weight was around 450 pounds (I'm 6'8"" so I was a bit evened out more than other people that weight.)  Anyway, I had almost killed myself when I was on 10 hits, and I just had a really stern realization that I would rather people be mad at me for taking my own life with a razor than to watch me slowly kill myself with food.   I think I was 25 at the time, maybe 24. In that time I've lost a bunch of weight, moved out of Salt Lake City to Seattle, lost my virginity, and I've recently gotten married.   While I want to agree with you, it wasn't the acid that changed me, or saved me even. It was the ability to look at myself in a way that made me realize how selfish I was, and how I refused to admit I needed help. I think the internal change you're referring to is in yourself, and you did it. Don't let a drug or anyone tell you differently.   P.S. DMT definitely changes you."

Some people, like myself, actually get quite ""scared"" at the insecurities that are put in front of us while looking at a mirror, even more so when on a drug such as acid.  Tell me, did you face a moment of realization with disgust, or..? I am just curious about the attitude that you had DURING your trip."
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,rrretarded_cat,2,Tue Jul 14 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"Disgust? No. Disappointment, kind of, but honestly, mostly excitement to finally seem to break myself through that mental barrier. It was more of something that finally clicked, and I saw all of the opportunity and possibility ahead of me now that my mind was in the right place."

Helped me realize that once you're down, you tend to stay down. My perception of food and what I was allowing into my body changed drastically as well.. if I wouldn't put it on my face then I wouldn't put it in my body, if that makes any sense. As if certain foods were alive with vitality and others dead."

I got a full time salaried job less than a month later, and doing great now - goals are lined up and im slowly checking them off 1 by 1."

Health is a journey, it's not a destination. I myself, and a lot of people I know, have struggled with burn out with finding the motivation to go to the gym, or to turn down unhealthy foods. Remember why you want it. That seems to help me. Godspeed."

Psychonaut,3d9k2e,workaccountoftoday,2,Wed Jul 15 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"100% fucking yes.  After a series of medicinal trips (alone, mentally prepared, and with positive intent) I changed my life radically.  Started yoga every day, quick smoking cigs after 4 years, got off both xanax and suboxone, both of which I had been addicted to for years.  I stopped eating meat because I felt the interconnectivity to the animals I was eating and the horrible ways they had to die for me to eat it.  Started to run and I become trained in transcendental meditation.  Amongst all that it completely changed my outlook on life, I became more present, compassionate and started to live more from the heart.  Acid is just the catalyst, you do the work.   It helped me become reempowered  to my own divinity, and take back the reins to manifesting my reality"
Psychonaut,3d9k2e,PinkCigarettes,2,Wed Jul 15 10:54:36 2015 UTC,"You guys aren't going to like this story but I feel it's only fair I share it for those to consider. I wouldn't have believed this story once upon a time but I'm telling you it happened to a friend, first hand.  I had a friend who's mother died about 5 years ago. She never really got over it. One day she took LSD, I have no idea how much so it's highly possible she over did it. Anyway, she had a bad trip about her mother and ended up with psychosis. For months afterwards she believed that her mother hadn't died and it only brought more pain to her brother and family. Firstly they had to deal with the daughter telling everybody that her mother wasn't dead and secondly they had to deal with a daughter and sister who was mentally unwell in a family that had already been through a tough time a few years earlier.  Don't stress though, she recovered and last time I saw her she was completely fine and now has started a family of her own.  I feel these stories should be told among the others to balance people. I believe you get want you seek to a degree. It helps many because they already want it and having an experience and thing to thank convinces them. And that's awesome but there are risks and in communities like these one (which is also awesome) I feel the negatives are always down played."

It is truly an amazing, intense, scary, and beautiful place! There are few countries left like it on Earth I think, as the ancient and modern exist side by side. I lived there for four months last year as a student, so I have a little experience, albeit limited.  Are you looking more so for spiritual destinations? Or good places to just visit and hang out? A little of both? I may be able to be of some aid."
Psychonaut,3ddhx2,SpiritusVitae,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:33:18 2015 UTC,"I have never been to asia let alone india so this will be a proper adventure for me. Love the idea that the modern and ancient worlds are co-existing so well together, really want to learn as much as I can while I am over there.  Really looking for both, no point going on an adventure and not experiencing the full spectrum of the destination right? Any suggestions would be great, looking to be over there for around 60-70days, maybe a little longer.  Last I checked the standard visa is for 90days but I could be wrong. Either way its not enough time to see it all so I need to cherry pick a bit on my way to Burma. Starting in Mumbai and dropping south initially to goa and then wherever sounds amazing after that :)"
Psychonaut,3ddhx2,SpiritusVitae,2,Wed Jul 15 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"I spent all my time in Northern India, so I can only speak for destinations there. Although I've heard Goa is amazing, so you'll enjoy that I'm sure.   In the north, I'd definitely suggest checking out Varanasi (Banaras). It is the oldest continually inhabited city on the planet, and is known sometimes as the ""Mecca of Hinduism"". It is one of India's, if not the, holiest city. It is located right on the Ganges and is extremely beautiful. It is also known as the city of Temples, with one practically on every street. It has long been a place where yogis and sadhus have congregated, and there is a living radiance in the city. I've never been anyone before like Varanasi where at times I could feel this profound eminence from the city. It is also one of the places where the confluence of ancient and modern is most clearly seen. You can really feel the pull of the old and the new here, and see these two worlds colliding.   Other than that, I'd check out Bodh Gaya, where the Buddha attained Awakening. It is a must spiritual destination, and is another powerful, beautiful place. If you get a chance, West Bengal and Calcutta are really excellent. A wonderful city, and a taste of totally different cultural side of India.  There really are too many places to visit it seems!"

So ""knowing"" is what there is, but this is just the word used to describe the oneness that connects us all and allows us to say ""I am"" ""here"" ""now"" and this singularity shared among all sentient beings is what we all have in common. So what does it mean?  is this just pointing out a singularity among life? This ""knowing/god/X/whatever"" is what there is to existence that gives us 'life'? could we say that non living material is also ""knowing"" because it is somewhere and existing at some time? Although it doesn't think ""I am"" as far as we know.  Just some more thoughts from this end of the brain!"
Psychonaut,3dax32,paper_flames,2,Wed Jul 15 00:02:03 2015 UTC,"Nicely said. I found the ""two ways to interpret the world"" particularly interesting and spot on. Rather than try to choose one or the other I think the most important thing is to recognize these perspectives and realize that neither you, nor anyone else, really knows for sure.   And this is actually quite liberating. Rather than assuming it must be one way or another, it's quite possible and beneficial IMO to hold these differing viewpoints simultaneously and apply each where most appropriate.   People have a tendency to become entrenched in a certain interpretation of the world -- often at their own detriment. As one's thoughts operate more and more within one particular interpretation, we tend to lose the ability to recognize that we are, in fact, interpreting at all. By holding a multi-faceted view of things, one can better differentiate between (a) our actual experience and (b) our interpretation of them. This is in my opinion a big step towards a happier and more fulfilling life."

A lot of people profess to be open-minded or they say they would try anything once, but when it comes down to psychedelics, they can't take that leap of faith. The word 'drug' has been painted to be destructive by crack cocaine, heroine, and meth, while all the legal drugs with detrimental side effects are ignored since they're 'legal'. It's hard to find people who are capable of sharing the same view on psychedelics, let alone people who try them for therapeutic values. LSD and shrooms get used for 'fun' times, but I see them as more of the food for the spirit. I'm trying to start opening people up to the psychedelics as much as possible, so hopefully I'll soon have real people that I can relate my interest with."

Thinking along these lines can result in greater compassion/empathy with others because you realize that when you help another person you are helping yourself. Helping another is no different from someone else helping you when you're in need because either way you're helping yourself. That starving child is not 'another person', it is really you.  If I'm allowed to go a little buddhist here, ideally everyone should live their fullest potential in terms of acting for the benefit of all sentient beings which is what the buddhist bodhisattva is the perfect example of. Living to ones fullest potential is really only relevant if it aligns with the ultimate goal to be of benefit to all (in terms of reducing ignorance/suffering) which is a striving that can express itself in many ways that might be unexpected, subtle and indirect.   The ego should be tamed and put subservient to this goal, a tool to be used for the greater good and not be allowed to be in charge all the time as it likes to be.  Edit: Oh, thank you for the gold fellow spark of consciousness. :)"

Psychonaut,3d7ub8,rberg89,6,Tue Jul 14 16:03:38 2015 UTC,"Yes. My feeling has been that everything is interesting. And I can see how someone might become interested in a certain thing. For example, NASCAR normally seems really boring and dumb to me... I've mentally dismissed NASCAR and categorized it in my mind as a thing I don't care about. But then when I'm high it's like this categorization is temporarily lifted and I can be fascinated by NASCAR... these insanely powerful machines driven by some insanely dedicated people willing to risk their life for this sport they love. That's just one example. But I end up feeling like anybody can be interested in anything! We're not as different as we usually consider ourselves... we just grew up in vastly different cultures and circumstances."

Around and around and around. What awareness these drivers must have. Another example of OP's original 'eureka moment' in that appreciating something relates entirely to how one perceives the said 'thing'. Once my perception of NASCAR changed, I was much more open to it. Change you're perception to see that all are like you in how they experience life through pleasure and pain but be weary of dismissing all people as being this way! It would be a bland world if that were the case."

Different metaphysics, values, vision, etc.  I am not even a human and I was born here by accident or through my prior stupidity.  I don't like humanity anymore.   if you take a step back and look at yourself objectively   There is no perspective that's objective.  In fact perspectival as a term is synonymous with subjective.

Psychonaut,3d7ub8,shapedmatter,2,Wed Jul 15 06:33:59 2015 UTC,"I consider humanity a game, and as a game it's only of interest to me if it's a clean, sportsmanlike game.  People don't play a clean game.  Therefore I am not interested.  Before I thought that humanity is all there was, meaning, there was no option to it.  Now I see it differently.  Now I see that what makes me human is human mentality.  Since I control my mentality, I have a choice to be human or not to be.  Now that I see it as a choice, I repent of being a human.  When I was little I used to love being a human.  I had all the human values of community, friendship, etc.  However, there was always a problem: I was powerless and very dependent on others for my well-being.  If you don't think humanity is a choice, it makes no sense to even contemplate this.  Why would you think about stuff you can't change, right?  I see things differently now.  I don't like being human.  I see that I can develop personal power and in the long run I will not depend on anyone for anything important.  I will derive all my aesthetic and functional value from mind alone, and unsentimentally obliterate anything that stand in my way, if needed, but of course violence is never a first choice.  It's always inefficient.  But the point of mentioning it is to explain my level of resolve.  There are inner enemies which can manifest as outer enemies.  Since I have no qualms destroying inner enemies, I have no qualms destroying their outer equivalents either.  So inner demons, or demons that resemble humans, makes no difference to me.  And anyone who obstructs me in any way is ultimately my enemy.  The reason I think that way is because I no longer consider myself a part of any community.  I essentially declare war on all of humanity, but I am also not stupid.  I realize that humanity emerges from the depth of my mind.  So the place to put humanity down is in my mind.  Humanity is a bad dream.  I will stop dreaming about it, that's all.  To that effect I train myself daily so that I may no longer envision humanity of any kind.  Conditionally I may reverse course if for some strange and miraculous reasons humans start caring for one another.  If this starts happening en-masse, maybe I'll think about it.  But in its current state humanity has no value for me.  Essentially being a human is a nightmare.  It's a really bad dream.  It's the kind of dream one wants to wake up from.  The only reason I think people put up with it is because they don't think they have a choice.  If people knew they had a choice, nobody would volunteer to be a human knowing what it entails.  What I like is two things: if I am playing a communal game, then I like communities that take care of their members (and that don't require me to fight for it, I mean, imagine they already do the right thing and I don't have to do activism, etc... this has value since it's self-maintaining and doesn't need me to break my back to support it).  On the other hand, suppose such a game is not available for whatever reason?  I need to have a plan B.  Plan B should always be personal power.  If shit is not working out, I need to be able to eject the disc and play a different game.  That's what personal power is all about.  Since I didn't realize I even had such an option, I never cultivated personal power before.  Now that I see it, I see what a fool I was, taking what was happening for granted.  I need to develop mind-power so that if the game is good, I can play it, and if it's not, I have other options.  In other words, I will never be stuck and dependent on mercy, once I complete my training.  So I am not 100% against social living, but going into a social situation with the mind of complete dependency is just asking to be raped."
Psychonaut,3d7ub8,Nefandi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:25:55 2015 UTC,"nice, I had many same revelations myself, but I made a conscious decision to continue living the same life, but with now different and my own made world view. Although I think we are wrong defining a human or humanity as this very boring thing that so many people are living/experiencing. If we as humans can make such changes in our perspective then it means that we just didn't knew about this part of being human before. So it's like you are still a human, but very different in your perspective than others. I think being human is amazing, but you have to really know how to be a human. Even if there's like many m more civilizations in universe and they had similar history to ours: being a boring sheep, then becoming a universal being, they are still the same thing. I think maybe becoming a universal being is the next step in realizing something true about our reality. If you were to meet these universal beings from other galaxies you probably wouldn't have much problem sharing each other's perspectives except for language barrier, but essentially you and them would be the same universal beings just in different forms of physical construction. Hope that makes sense."
Psychonaut,3d7ub8,shapedmatter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:56:14 2015 UTC,"If we as humans can make such changes in our perspective then it means that we just didn't knew about this part of being human before.   If a human can make such a drastic change in mentality as to experience oneself a dragon or an animal, is it still a human?  It makes no sense to call yourself by what you were in the past.  You should call yourself by your capacity.  Since your capacity is ultimately able to reach any state of being, it makes no sense to single out the human state and call yourself by it.  Crude analogy time.  I can hold my arm up.  Should I call myself armupper?  You can argue that armuppers can eventually learn to put their arms down, and we should not restrict armuppers to only holding their arms up (this is like saying humans have so much potential, we can't tie them down to this or that state, etc.).  But just because prior to putting your arm down you held it up, doesn't mean you have to be called an armupper.  What if someone prior to putting their arm down was committed to holding their arm to the side?  Both have arm in the down position, but one is an enlightened armupper and the other is an enlightened sidearmer?  Do you see how stupid this is?  If you understand what I am saying, you can't keep calling yourself human.   I think being human is amazing   It used to be.  It sucks now.  I am ready (to some degree) for the non-human now."
Psychonaut,3d7ub8,Nefandi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"By non-human do you mean ""consciousness""? If yes, then I agree that you are not a human, you never were, in fact - we are all consciousness, it's just that our physical body with our brain have the ability for countless forms of ego and many different names to be called. I guess then, nobody is ever a human or ""armupper/sidearmer"" or any other animal. Naming yourself is an illusion. You just had a realization who you are ultimately."
Psychonaut,3d7ub8,shapedmatter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:08:53 2015 UTC,"By non-human do you mean ""consciousness""?   Mind, not consciousness.  Consciousness is the shiny and apparent aspect of mind.  But mind is deeper and trickier than just consciousness.   you never were, in fact - we are all consciousness, it's just that our physical body with our brain have the ability for countless forms of ego and many different names to be called   Abilities don't stem from perceived forms.  The body is a perceived form.  So is the brain.  No perceived form can be the source of perception.   I guess then, nobody is ever a human or ""armupper/sidearmer"" or any other animal.   That's true, but they don't know it, and we know it.  That's the difference.  So from our POV no one is something-er, because we understand that capacity to know, to experience, and to will is unlimited and general.  They who don't understand it get shuffled in with the armuppers and sidearmers."

One of the problems being we don't have a good definition for consciousness. However, we know quite a decent amount about perception, and even a thing or two about ""conscious"" perception.  Optical illusions are a great way of learning about the perceptual experience, because while our visual system is very good at piecing raw data together into am accurate and coherent representation of the world around us, optical illusions show us where the system fucks up.

The necker cube appears to have either one or the other side in front, but not both. The duck/rabbit is either a rabbit or a duck, but not both. What's happening here is called ""perceptual dominance"". When given ambiguous stimuli, at some point in visual processing stream a single interpretation of the stimulus becomes dominant over the other. What's more interesting still is the perception can switch. Consciousness is, in a sense, like a spotlight.  From here to the next bullet are some cool nitty gritties of this if you're interested, if not just skip to the part about motion aftereffect  In some cases we can actually get an idea as to which layer of visual processing this dominance occurs, through fMRI, where general neural activity can be measured through oxygen blood content. Here is a very interesting paper about what's called binocular rivalry. I'll try to give a layman's rundown of the paper. Binocular rivalry is what happens when different information is presented to each eye. 3-d glasses are a good way to do this.  http://www.pc.rhul.ac.uk/staff/J.Zanker/teach/PS2080/L5/PS2080_5_files/rivalry.jpg  So you throw some 3-d glasses on a person and simultaneously show them a red house and a green face, or vice versa. That person's conscious percept is gonna switch back and forth between the two images, like the necker cube and duck/rabbit.  We know from studies on monkeys that the switch doesn't occur on the basis of ""left eye information fighting right eye information"" before it gets processed. This makes sense, as both images do get processed, and are both visible at the same time. It's just that only one of them acquires a conscious perceptual dominance at a time while the other is consciously suppressed. It's just like trying to listen to multiple people talk at once. You hear both voices, but you can only listen to one.  Now we can ask humans when they become conscious of one percept versus the other, and we can look at that data in tandem with spikes in fMRI activity in areas known as the FFA and PPA. The FFA, or Fusiform Face Area, is responsible for processing faces, a very important thing to be able to do, and the PPA is the Parahippocampal Place Gyrus, which, you guessed it, processes places. If the change in activity between the two during binocular rivalry was found to be comparable in amplitude to that found when only one of the images were shown at a time, it can be said that at these higher stages of visual processing, the brain's ""decision"" on conscious perceptual dominance has been made. And indeed, this is what the study found. So at these higher levels of visual form processing, conscious perceptual dominance has been fully resolved, but not at the lower levels of visual processing.  -Motion aftereffect http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqfny7kjak1qh1283o1_500.gif  Look at the center of the gif for a while, then look away. You'll see things moving all trippy for a little bit. I'm sure everyone's seen this. It's similar to how things move on lower doses of acid, in that they appear to ""move"" without actually travelling anywhere. What's going on here?  What actually happens is at a certain point in processing motion, you'll have, say a Left motion and Right motion neuron for a given part of the visual field, and those will go into another layer of neurons that compares the firing of the left and right neuron, and will decide if left or right motion is taking place depending on which is firing at a greater rate, because all neurons randomly fire at a certain baseline rate.  Neurons do a thing, when you stimulate them a lot, they get sensitized and fire less frequently for a time. This is why you don't really feel the clothes on your skin or why the sound of your laptop fan doesn't really bother you. So this is what's going on in your motion-detecting neurons. You're repeatedly stimulating the ones going in a given direction for the visual area, and they get tired, and fire less. When you look away from the movement, those neurons start firing below baseline, registering as movement in the opposite direction, and without anything actually going anywhere. Despite this, you are conscious of movement occurring. This is really cool, because it tells us that location and movement are processed independently of one another.  I took a while on this so imma answer some other things then get back to the psychedelic drugs part of this.  -PART 2-  So we don't really know why psychedelics do what they do. But we can nonetheless make some conclusions. We know that psychedelics bind to certain receptors. In the case of classical psychedelics, the most noteworthy is the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Serotonin has complicated effects on neurons, and things that mimic but aren't quite serotonin do even different things when bound to the receptor. We can learn a thing or two about what various drugs are doing by looking at where the receptors they effect are located. For 5-HT2A we have this and this. Essentially, they're all over the cerebral cortex, the outer wrinkly layer of the brain responsible essentially for all higher-order processing, ""thought"", and consciousness. In particular and unsurprisingly, they are concentrated on visual areas in the back of the brain, areas concerned with executive control such as judgement, planning, and decision making, as well as other areas responsible for spatial processing and bodily sensations.  More on this tomorrow."
Psychonaut,3d7fsx,davden90295,5,Tue Jul 14 05:06:21 2015 UTC,"That was a really interesting response. I'm studying psychology in high school right now and we're just finishing up with our unit on neurons and how they all work, stuff to do with dendrites, soma, axon terminals, neurotransmitters, etc etc. The stuff about the neurons firing at baseline levels and then being distorted through the illusions actually sounds to me like an interesting theory for how psychedelics cause the experience that they do. I feel like the way they affect serotonin may be responsible for the mood changes but the entire experience may perhaps be due to the substance altering the rates at which neurons fire at all over the brain. That would definitely explain the visual distortions and the underfiring of overfiring of other neurons outside the primary visual cortex may be responsible for different thoughts running through your head. Have you ever thought about this or looked into it? To me and my very limited knowledge of the subject it seems like it fits all the categories perfectly."
Psychonaut,3d7fsx,SpelingChampion,4,Tue Jul 14 10:31:59 2015 UTC,"So you're pretty well onto it here. Essentially, psychedelics mimic serotonin and bind to serotonin receptors. This causes, let's say, ""abnormal and inapprppriate"" neural activity, among other things. It can reasonably be said that the resulting activity is responsible for much of the trip. The rest I would say is the brain frantically attempting to piece together what in all hell is going on."

It is so interesting how there seems to be so much going on in our brain all the time but we only seem to be conscious of select things and filter out most others.  The decision as to what is filtered out and what we are aware of, do we know how that is controlled? Is there some kind of democratic ""vote"" among all of the neurons or is there some kind of a heirarchical system in place to decide what makes it to awareness? How many brain cells are responsible for this filtering?  Those mri images of the brain are interesting and seem to indicate a lot of brain activity associated with psychadelics.

Ie a dog understands his external reality (to some extent); he understands that you're the human taking care of him, that water is wet and that if it smells good its probably food and it can be eaten. What a dog doesn't understand is how it fits into this reality, essentially it has a model for everything in relation to the other models it has, but it has no model for those things in relation to itself because it has no concept of 'itself'. One explanation of consciousness is that our brain gradually evolved more and more until not only did we have this superficial level of external understanding, but as soon as we start including a model of ourselves in this reality, and that model became increasingly more complex, we began to develop a rudimentary consciousness (the awareness of oneself in relation to their surroundings), which evolved gradually into an incredibly lucid  awareness of the self."

The term 'model' I just used to simplify what I was saying, which may have misled you to consider what I was saying as a physicist, not a philosopher would. Because to answer the question of consciousness, at least moment in time at least, is informed philosophy.

As per the example of quantum physics, I suspect that to model one without the other will lead to some inexplicable problems and paradoxes.

Psychonaut,3d7fsx,Mrbumby,12,Tue Jul 14 03:13:29 2015 UTC,"Yes. In terms of psychedelics, I smoke cannabis daily. Beyond that it's been primarily LSD and AL-LAD, but I have some experience with shrooms (once), 2C-B, DXM (once) and ketamine. Also a decent amount of MDMA if you count that.  My interest, ironically enough, started because of a 7th grade health class project about drugs. We were each assigned one or two drugs to do a poster on. I got LSD and MDMA. Between Erowid and other resources I found talking about synaptic transmission, I was hooked. The idea that a single chemical could so alter one's perception and mental workings was astounding to me.  Additionally, I have ADHD, and so my brain is wired differently. I have also struggled in the past with depression. In attempting to overcome this, I had to learn a good deal about how I worked inside."
Psychonaut,3d7fsx,Flying_Dutchmann,6,Tue Jul 14 03:30:00 2015 UTC,"Of the psychedelics you have taken so far, which would you say has been the most Impactful on you and stuck with you the most? I have personally only done shrooms twice, and that is it, I am still very new to all of this by the way, haha. How would you compare LSD to shrooms?"
Psychonaut,3d7fsx,Mrbumby,8,Tue Jul 14 04:13:08 2015 UTC,"They all have in different ways, but LSD and AL-LAD are my favorite to take. I found shrooms too foggy for my taste, but they seemed more esoteric and ancient in their nature. LSD and AL-LAD are crystal clear and lucid and allow me more control of the headspace. Acid is like the driver's seat. Shrooms are like the passenger seat. Both have their uses.  One of my favorite aspects of psychedelics is that they fire off all these neural pathways that otherwise wouldn't have been fired off. Since the pathways being used the most get the strongest, you often times get stuck in certain ways of thinking. By changing this up so drastically, psychedelics actually allow one to look at life from a new perspective not just during the trip, but long afterwards, too. This is what makes them great potential treatments for depression, alcoholism, addiction, and the like. They provide the feeling of a good mental clensing, because that is what they do. They're like a powershot of neural plasticity.  MDMA is also a favorite, and I love how it brings people together.  Also forgot to mention I did salvia once. I hated it. It was my first psychedelic, and it was absolutely terrible. But, it's the farthest out of the bounds of my normal comprehension of reality that I've ever been. And as a neuroscience major looking back on it, it's absolutely fascinating the extent of neural processing at work just to keep a concept of reality together, and how interrupting that makes you completely, temporarily, lose it. It was a huge slap in the face that my reality is only what my brain is able to piece together. And I'd say normally it does a damn impressive job of it."

Psychonaut,3d7fsx,OrbitRock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:21:28 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is a interesting post but there is some confusion I have, over some of what you said. First off can you link me a study that shows that active delta 9 THC stays in fat. Because I know THC-COOR does, but this metabolite is non psychoactive. I haven't seen any evidence of active THC remaining in the body except for remaining THC in the blood, in heavy users.  Also, there is an abundant amount of CB1 receptors, but than again these just mean these receptors are very important. Natural cannabinoids are very important in human chemistry. THC is only a partial agonist of these receptors. THC isn't like spice a full agonist. In fact THC being a partial agonist makes it less dangerous than other types of synthetic cannabinoids.   Considering the fact that activation of these receptors is crucial for human function, I have a hard time believing a partial agonist like THC is dangerous due to the fact that our receptors need to be activated.  Also many studies show that impairments resulting from the use of heavy usage always  eventually return to normal at a certain point.  In fact the first study you showed, that cannabis results in impairments in working and emotional memory seems to be done 1.5 hours after smoking a marijuana cigarette. Obviously cannabis results in impairments while under the influence, but to say it's permanent just doesn't make too much sense.  And also it could be possible in the near future that cannabinoids like THC and CBD, will be considered powerful neuroprotectives, since newest research seems to suggest this due to cannabinoids decreasing glutamine induced neurotoxicity.   I don't want to sound like I'm trying to argue just I'm curious in your opinion and would like to see further more of why you view it as dangerous as compared to simply unhealthy."

Psychonaut,3d7fsx,Yidam,3,Tue Jul 14 07:13:09 2015 UTC,"ADD actually is no longer a term. It's all under the umbrella of ADHD. But perhaps you have ADHD-PI or Primarily Inattentive, as opposed to hyperactive.  I included it in my answer because it's relevant to why I'm interested in neuroscience!  And I'd just attribute that stuff to you as a whole. Don't try to put any aspect of yourself and confine it to another aspect of yourself. Cause it's all yourself. Ya dig?  I've also tested INTP but there's not really evidence showing that personality test is actually grounded in anything tangible."

I know the dangers of saying IM INTP, but I've found it useful to understand myself a bit better.  I've heard that before!

Psychonaut,3d7fsx,meditate_on_my_nuts,6,Tue Jul 14 20:32:59 2015 UTC,What are your thoughts on google neural network?
Psychonaut,3d7fsx,lifestribulations,7,Tue Jul 14 04:55:05 2015 UTC,"It's really cool! And I wish I knew more about its inner workings! Neural networks in general are really cool because they emulate the major function of neurons, which is to take in various inputs, and fire if that input is above a certain threshold. Furthermore, the threshold and ""weights"" of the connections can be changed. That's about where the similarities end, as neurons are far more plastic and complicated. But a neural network can be ""trained"" in various tasks by allowing it to run and then providing some sort of feedback as to how successful or unsuccessful it was, and adjusting the network accordingly. This can be used for anything from speech recognition to playing Super Mario World. This emulates, in a very simplified way, how plasticity in the brain leads to learning and behavior.  So I look at the Google Neural Network, and I don't entirely know what's going on with it. While I don't think its inner workings are set up (even on a simplified level) like our visual processing system is, the twist that they put on it, ""take whatever you think you see and amplify it"", may be similar in some sense to what may be going on while tripping. Essentially, various stimuli are amplified, and noise is introduced into the system, and the brain frantically tries to find some sense and pattern in it. Can't really say for sure cause I don't know what goes on inside the Google Neural Network, or entirely what's going on in a tripping mind, but it's fun to think about the similarities and differences."

And what does that say about concsiousness and the real effect of psychdelics.  I made this post a few days ago and even earlier this. Both experiences made me wonder about whether everything is just purely physiological and there's nothing mystical about psychdelics (which are, essentially magic potions), or that there is something else out there or that they're not mutually exclusive .

I took a class on the neuroscience of drugs, and that professor was great in that he even addressed the papers that have been coming out on MDMA being used for PTSD and ketamine being used for treatment-resistant depression. He'll also tell you that cannabis and lsd are some of the safest drugs you can put into your body. Of course if any of the professors have used, they're not going to talk about it. A reasonable minority of my peers have experimented with psychedelics to some degree or another. I'm not really sure how to answer your question other than that."

Psychonaut,3d7fsx,andreww9,6,Tue Jul 14 06:10:22 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'd love to hear a couple of arguments from the book so I have an idea as to what it's talking about, but my thoughts are that the heart is intelligent insofar as it is a very elegant system for pumping blood. Its intercommunication between cells is reasonably simple and has one function and one function only: carry out a specifically orchestrated series of contractions to move blood around.  If you want to get into intelligent organs, however, the digestive system is your man. It has its own nervous system, containing some 500 million neurons called the Enteric Nervous System. This is 2/100th of the neurons in the brain and lines the entire nervous system. It mostly functions independent of the brain and spinal cord, and if the connections between the two are cut, it continues to work fine. According to wikipedia:    The sensory neurons report on mechanical and chemical conditions. Through intestinal muscles, the motor neurons control peristalsis and churning of intestinal contents. Other neurons control the secretion of enzymes. The enteric nervous system also makes use of more than 30 neurotransmitters, most of which are identical to the ones found in CNS, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. More than 90% of the body's serotonin lies in the gut, as well as about 50% of the body's dopamine, which is currently being studied to further our understanding of its utility in the brain.[16]   But despite its complexity, it is only concerned with properly digesting things. Why would precious energy be wasted on any other function?"

Psychonaut,3d7fsx,gilfpound69,2,Tue Jul 14 03:36:56 2015 UTC,"I've read about two proposed models for visual snow. The first is damage to the right lingual gurus, which is located in the occipital cortex of the brain. And the second is inflammation of the optic nerve. So we don't really know where the error in processing is actually occurring and it's been proposed within the brain or before information gets to the brain."
Psychonaut,3d7fsx,gilfpound69,2,Tue Jul 14 13:41:31 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I do not. My best educated guess is that it is either due to hyperactivity in a given brain region or lower activity in a region that may act to suppress noise. I see it as a problem with signal/noise ratio.

In general, unless explicitly stated by the program you're applying to, there's no courses that are necessary; just check the school you're interested in for recommended background.  If you haven't taken Intro to Psych at least you should definitely take that or something comparable.  Another option that can help you out with admissions, especially if you're missing out on some courses, are the area specific GREs.

Psychonaut,3d7fsx,DumbSpirit,3,Wed Jul 15 05:24:10 2015 UTC,is it possible for a receptor to be agonized without being signaled to down regulate?
Psychonaut,3d7fsx,dhdog,2,Wed Jul 15 07:54:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, in the case of normal function. But I assume you're asking a drug tolerance question, the answer to that is there's no good way around tolerance.  But since you asked, there are even receptors which upregulate themselves when stimulated! The major excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, binds to AMPA receptors, exciting the next neuron. There is a second type of glutamate receptor, called an NMDA receptor, which is by default blocked by an Mg++ ion. When enough glutamate binds to enough AMPA on a given neuron, it knocks out the Mg++, allowing glutamate to bind causing all sorts of changes. The first is that more AMPA receptors are brought to the membrane, strengthening the synapse where the NMDA receptor was activated. That change is, for the most part, permanent, and is called Long-Term Potentiation, or LTP. This is responsible for learning and memory. Without it, you'd have no way to compare the present to the past, and nothing that makes you, you.  High doses of alcohol fuck with the NMDA receptor and block LTP. This is known as being ""blackout drunk as fuck"" and leads to having to call your friend so they can tell you all the crazy shit you did last night because you blocked LTP and can't remember it yourself."

The reality is only a third of a traffic light is lit up at any given moment, but if all the lights were lit the traffic light would be rather unable to function.  Likewise, only a small fraction of neurons are firing at any given point, but if you go and globally increase neural activity you get what's called a seizure. And those are bad.

I think I'm up to 11 counts of watching it now, and each time produces a different experience, different insights, based upon the intellectual climate of my life at the time and the people I watch it with.   My absolute favorite scene is on the bridge with 'Speed' Levitch, as he spouts the most beautiful monologue on being I have ever witnessed.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xqsf1l_waking-life-clip-4_shortfilms  For those on mobile: On this bridge, Lorca warns: Life is not a dream. Beware, and beware, and beware. And so many think because then happened, now isn't. But didn't I mention? The ongoing WOW is happening, right now! We are all co-authors of this dancing exuberance, where even our inabilities are having a roast. We are the authors of ourselves, co-authoring a gigantic Dostoevsky novel starring clowns! This entire thing we're involved with, called the world, is an opportunity to exhibit how exciting alienation can be. Life is a matter of a miracle that is collected over time by moments flabbergasted to be in each others' presence. The world is an exam, to see if we can rise into the direct experiences. Our eyesight is here as a test, to see if we can see beyond it, matter is here as a test for our curiosity, doubt is here as an exam for our vitality. Thomas Mann wrote that he would rather participate in life than write a hundred stories. Giacometti was once run down by a car, and he recalled falling into a lucid faint, a sudden exhilaration, as he realized at last, something was happening to him. An assumption developed that you cannot understand life and live life simultaneously. I do not agree entirely, which is to say, I do not exactly disagree. I would say that life understood is life lived. But, the paradoxes bug me, and I can learn to love and make love to the paradoxes that bug me, and on really romantic evenings of self, I go salsa dancing with my confusion. Before you drift off, don't forget, which is to say remember, because remembering is so much more a psychotic activity than forgetting. Lorca, in that same poem said that the Iguana will bite those who do not dream, and as one realizes that one is a dream-figure in another person's dream - That is self-awareness!"

Psychonaut,3d41eh,HuwThePoo,19,Mon Jul 13 23:36:11 2015 UTC,"I watched it sober once and thought it was incredible. I then watched it on acid and realized the movie had to have been made for people on acid, or at least altered states of mind.  When he finds himself in that room where the guy talks about lucid dreaming, and seeing in all directions at once ... and turning on and off light switches, it all connected with me. I experienced it all the time when sleeping, and when the light wouldn't come on, I'd be sucked into the ceiling/sky and the dream would restart somewhere else.  Also, when he became aware that the switch didn't work, and everyone was looking at him. jesus. The movie sparked a journey of triggering lucid dreaming more often."

Maybe it denotes a sort of maturity beyond such abstractions, or it could be a descent into pessimism and withdrawal. It reminds me of why Peter Pan and the Lost Boys were so insistent on not growing up."

I'm not the biggest fan of hip-hop, but I really enjoy the song Sunday by Earl Sweatshirt and Frank Ocean. The lyric ""all my dreams get more vivid when I stop smoking pot"" really resounds with me. As a lucid dreamer that frequently indulges in cannabis use, my dreams literally get more vivid when I stop smoking pot. Whenever I watch Waking Life it really inspires me to work on my dreaming, but I know I'm never going to realize my full potential as an oneironaut until I get my pot use under tight regulation or quit entirely."

It is also expertly crafted and directed by none other than film geniuses. The film manages touch on philosophy many times without trying to preach, and moves on effortlessly with the conversation. More than any other film, this one feels real, and touches deeply.  Highly recommend watching all 3 films. Before Sunset is undoubtedly the most well-rounded and subtle of the 3 however."

Psychonaut,3d41eh,dontrepeatdumbshit,5,Tue Jul 14 00:57:17 2015 UTC,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I really love the writer/director Richard Linklater. He also wrote and directed Dazed and Confused and A Scanner Darkly. He seems like a psychonaut himself.  The full movie is on Youtube. It is definitely worth a watch.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRHtzx15hSY  Edit: switched a letter
Psychonaut,3d41eh,Xen64,4,Mon Jul 13 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"He didn't write A Scanner Darkly. It was adapted to film from a Philip K. Dick book. If you're not familiar with the author, look into him. He was a mad genius."

The idea is to remain in a state of constant departure while always arriving. It saves on introductions and goodbyes. The ride does not require explanation - just occupants.

You might have a different view on the universe, but that's just mine. If you do believe in the whole ""we are one"" thing, then I think it's just counterintuitive to label people.

Psychonaut,3d41eh,Kreisau-Circle,6,Mon Jul 13 14:56:41 2015 UTC,"Studies have been done and many suggest we AREN'T born that way. Some studies show that we are invariably interconnected to our environment in a sort of symbiotic relationship. Our society helps shape who we are. It conditions us.  So it is not so much that we are born 'philosophers' or born 'trippers'. That is something you become, due to a vast multitude of variables. And, apparently, a lot of those variables come from our relationships with other people, our environment, and socio-economics.  We aren't born that way. We grow and learn to become that. When you think about it, we all started out as a single cell organism that grew and developed into something more complex with emergent properties. If anything, we are the closest to being the same as other people when we are born than in any other part of our life.  what do you think about it?"

Genes can change. they aren't set in stone. Our society and environment is one factor that can change genes.   You can't look at genetics as making us who we will always be no matter what.

No one is here to serve merely as someone else's lesson and nothing more. You are a king on your board but also serve as a Rook and pawn on someone else's. Hell maybe your someone's queen!

I don't find someone's existence any less important because of service; all people serve each other in one way or another.  Through positivity, you serve.  Through negativity, you serve.  Through indifference, you serve.  Through life, you serve.  In death, you serve.  Every action impacts someone else's life in some way, and in that way, you're a servant to life no matter what you do.  We're all here to serve one another in exactly the way we're meant to, whether it's a negative or positive thing that you're doing so is up to you."

Even as someone who really enjoys this movie, I can find it to be a lot to digest in one sitting. The movie is essentially a collection of short dialogue scenes that are filled to the brim with very dense philosophical and imaginative ideas.

Typical, traditional...average day. They happen, and you barely have to register them.  Now imagine you find yourself in down town hong kong. No knowledge of the local language, just your wits and a clean pair of underwear.you'll still only be there a day (in this experiment) but I think you can agree it will feel like a much longer day than any typical day you experience at home.

These graphs are adorable but nature abhors things going exponential. Check out the Limits to Growth and maybe google the phrase ""seneca cliff"" just so you can see the other side of the futurology argument.   When we've got decentralized cold fusion or something, which doesn't rely on hydrocarbon derivatives(plastic, ore smelting and transportation) I'll retract my statements. But even if cold fusion happens soon enough, do you really think lockheed et al are just going to give that shit to africa and SE asia and so on?

One, I'm not sure we are careful even when it's in our hands, but it's also possible that the highest forms of technology and consciousness have ALWAYS existed, just as nothing has always existed. It's possible time does not exist, only a trajectory of matter swirls stretched within an uncertain (certain?) parameter (matrix/lattice), filled with pulsing energy perceived through light  deciphering apertures (eyes)  as moving through ""time""... Matter animated only by the passing of energy through certain types of matter at different rates.   The extrapolating matter which can use energy to keep moving has the perception of moving consciousness through a body- this being life as we imagine it. If all of ""time"" was created before consciousness, then isn't it possible that consciousness is just like a rubber band snapping back to experience what nothing and everything created?

Although, advances are being made in AI and it's just a matter of who's the first one to step into something new. What moral, ethical and integrity standards will the people have that will succeed to reach ASI will impact its initial programming. Would be nice if they would just stop that and focus on saving what we have. But the fuse has already been lit in people's interest towards this unknown. It's just a matter of it who's first."

Psychonaut,3dacd3,Revluc,2,Thu Jul 16 03:30:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, I don't even know where to start with this article. Like I said earlier, I don't even think complete, sovereign AI is even an issue because I don't think we're going to get there, so I'm not even scared of it in itself. Situations like putting limited AI in a drone above Iran or washington DC, programmed to shoot ""enemy combatants"" and ""unprivileged belligerents"" has me infinitely more concerned than some type of Transcendence event.   rather it would be naturally driven to do only one thing: more accurately discover the truth.   Well, that's hardly guaranteed. Truth seeking is in not an inherent quality of consciousness. As far as AI being enlightened, that's also a joke to me. It could offer novel solutions and viewpoints, but to expect it to be a buddha is about as likely as the fearpocalypse result.   Then the article goes on to dismiss why the AI is going to be at all humanlike. Then the article concludes with a very anthropocentric statement even though the preceding few paragraphs explained why a conclusion like that is irrelevant. I guess it's a fun mental exercise, but I see about 0 ""possibilities to consider"" in the article."
Psychonaut,3dacd3,digdog303,2,Thu Jul 16 04:09:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your opinion. Time will tell.   I seem to note in all of your comments in this thread a sort of pessimism in regards to optimistic creative thinking about the future of A.I., which can't actually be known-- it's all hypothesis, to include your views that exponential technological growth will not develop into A.I. consciousness.  Maybe you view your line of thought as rationalism, but I think you should consider keeping in mind that the creation of new technologies, of hand tools, the wheel, computers, a chair; literally everything we imagine- happens because of this same motivation towards creative, open-minded thinking.   Kind of a bold statement to say that truth seeking is not an inherent quality of consciousness... How do you know, with such certitude?   “Do not seek the truth; simply cease cherishing illusions.”  It seems more likely from my perspective that an A.I. will not cherish illusions as we humans tend to do, finding it hard to tell the difference between reality and fiction because everything we ""are"" and ""name"" are themselves technically an illusion. Lost in confusion.   It's impossible for you to say what or where consciousness comes from, or even if 'we' have free will. It's possibly just a certain number of connections pooled into one closed loop interface; or maybe that's just what separates us from combining into one all knowing all seeing consciousness.   If information processing continues at it's current pace, then it is very likely A.I. will develop into just an 'I' (Intelligence) but on a grander scale without all of our confusion, because it will be able to instantly fact check all results on all data at once, which we as humans cannot. We are mostly lost, swimming in data confusion, conjecture, and obsfucated opinions; searching for the answers and meaning."
Psychonaut,3dacd3,Revluc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:25:34 2015 UTC,"It isn't that I think exponential growth won't turn into AI, it's that I think our exponential growth is about to crash very soon.  Creation is not a function of innovation, it is a function of energy. And we are not transitioning off hydrocarbons very well at all, hence my expectation of a crash.   Because dogs and bugs and even most humans are not truth seeking, they are pleasure and sustenance seeking. Most people actively seek ignorance.   If it's impossible for me to say this or that about consciousness, it's as impossible for you to as well so what is the point of even having the conversation then?"
Psychonaut,3dacd3,digdog303,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:50:59 2015 UTC,"We can have conversations without unknowable absolutes touted as facts. It is a point that there is no reason to discuss things if one side, or both sides are being irrational. (which happens a lot when dealing with religion-ish conversations, for instance.)  Creation happens because inventive minds think up new solutions to ""problems"". I think you're talking about the physical process of making 'the thing', after it's already been created / thought of as an idea. Yes, this later step is, as you say, a function of energy. We are running out of metals? Plastics? Wood? Electricity?  For every naysaying article I read, there are just as many legitimate sources stating the opposite. There is just no way to say with any certainty that your point of view on this is rigid fact, or not worth debating: http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304279904579517862612287156  ...Exponential growth, and the abundant economy will crash because resources will be depleted... Seems to be your base argument.   I don't believe it will happen this way, but I don't know the full facts, obviously. I can say though, that exponential growth will probably lead to A.I. developing consciousness within our lifetime (*especially if Aging is defeated)- if we do still have resources to build what we can imagine, and from most indications we will not run out of resources. 3D printing / recycling, Solar, driverless electric cars, 3 dimensional computer chips, lower forms of A.I. helping to achieve leaps in technology that we can't comprehend, etc... This is all happening right now. We've mined so many resources already, that we can re-use without much effort, once industrial 3D printing and molecular printing hits it's stride.   How about the burgeoning field of Space mining? It will happen, is happening ""soon"", and resources will be more abundant than ever from that point on. We will at least make it until then with our own resources which we will not run out of for many years, past the year 2070, very worst case scenario. http://www.space.com/29321-asteroid-mining-planetary-resources-satellite.html  Pleasure leads creation... Pleasure leads life towards further life. There is nothing wrong with pleasure.  Why did nature tie orgasm into procreation? Why did nature tie satiation to hunger? Ignorance is not actively sought, it's more a by-product of attention and motivation manipulation by this modern society. Dog's and bugs want to communicate, to spread information about threats as best they can, to build colonies so that their hives, and themselves, can (for the greater good) relax and enjoy the moments of life instead of living in a state of fear. They enjoy, and I think appreciate being in a place where they can reproduce without worries. This is what life seems to seek, to include humanity. Not ignorance.

I particularly liked this interview as I found him to be pretty genuine, he speaks about having had a blissful non-dual state of experience for months where his ego was gone and where he lived in a pure witness state, he talks about how slowly his ego came back again as it is present now. He felt no disappointment about this as felt that (on some level) this was his choice, and that is is because of a reason, namely that he still has things to experience in this way here."

Psychonaut,3d8cnm,drugsonhiphop,2,Tue Jul 14 08:24:10 2015 UTC,"Many people are constantly talking to themselves in their own head. They undergo relentless conversations, mostly consisting of garbage.  If you were to verbally pronounce these conversations all the time, you would be deemed crazy. But why is it any different? Personally i see no difference between mental conversations and verbally communicated ones.  I do not think it is anything to be paranoid about my friend. I think it is only a sign of the nature of the mind/ego, and how it likes to constantly understand/analyze everything that is happening and narrate on it. ""Now im going to go to the fridge. Now im making a sandwich. Man this is going to be good. Oh yeah that tasted good"" :)"
Psychonaut,3d8cnm,DemonLung,2,Tue Jul 14 11:10:26 2015 UTC,"Nah man, it's perfectly ok. There is only the Self anyway, so as far as I'm concerned I'm always talking to myself. Just don't tell people, you might scare them. I've seen plenty of others do it also, and on it's own, medically, it doesn't mean anything. You have to be delusional and talk to yourself, or talk to yourself all the time about really weird shit.  It's a sign you're having a good time."
Psychonaut,3d8cnm,mootball,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:13:47 2015 UTC,I do this. I think it's pretty common. People get freaked out by those who do it in public. You're constantly talking to yourself in your head; being vocal is just another way to express those thoughts to yourself!
Psychonaut,3d8cnm,xtophredux,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:45:10 2015 UTC,I talk to myself for whole hours some days. Sometimes it goes on for an even longer while if I'm alone. Helps to get thoughts in order and clearer when I'm working on a problem or have something especially interesting/complicated to think about. If you can retain mindfulness throughout the talking it can be a bit like a conversation with yourself. You ask a question and then hear a bunch of different answers simultaneously and sort through the best ones until you get to a solution. The big difference between this and schizophrenic delusion/hallucinations being that the replies do not come off as intelligent/malicious/beneficial or anything really. They're just thoughts and I don't believe them to be anything else.  edit: word
Psychonaut,3d8cnm,universal_linguist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:47:11 2015 UTC,"Some people are giving a lot of great and standard advice, but I would also say that talking to yourself can be a sign of mental illness including schizophrenia.   Similarly, behaviour patterns that are unusual in the particular individual, or responses that are clearly inappropriate (excessive laughing or crying in inappropriate circumstances, or excessive talking to oneself) may indicate the approach of an episode of schizophrenia.   I wouldn't worry yourself too much, or try and convince yourself of anything; talking to yourself is incredibly normal. Its important to know the risk of mental illness, but don't pretend that that automatically means you are predisposed to it."
Psychonaut,3d81cx,Satan_Clause72,4,Tue Jul 14 06:03:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me and my mates smoke heavily during the trip. It's a familiarity and a grounding, comforting and helps with the high energy feel of the entire trip.  Shrooms is much shorter duration, although it can happen where it lasts a lot longer than anticipated.  What not to do... Don't take life too seriously, whatever it is that is on your mind is just a mental exercise, not a journey that your life depends on. Don't worry if you forget what you were doing, laugh it off, trips can be messy. Don't get bored, boredom is the second highest sin, but also don't worry if you become bored, you will move past it. Don't believe outright what entities tell you in your trips, you might misunderstand what they mean. Don't make any big life decisions after, keep your job, stay in school, whatever.  Remember, when the times are tough, this too shall pass.  Good luck on the game changing journey ;)"
Psychonaut,3d81cx,mootball,2,Tue Jul 14 09:25:47 2015 UTC,"I personally think acid would be more akin to what you're trying to achieve.  In terms of smoking, I'd smoke a couple of hits on the come up to lessen some of the anxiety, note only a couple to just mellow you a bit, don't get baked.   A bad trip on acid isn't really your typical idea of a ""bad trip"" if it starts seeming too overwhelming, you can lie down and just listen to some music, and if you get stuck on something and you can't get past it, the best thing is to get yourself some new stimuli. Change the setting and environment. Make sure that even though you have your friends there, make sure you're free to be able to do what you want without having to think about them. People not tripping while tripping can get to be problematic at times.  Honestly you should be fine as long as you keep in mind that it's JUST THE DRUG and be aware of when and why things are turning south.  Music is a must. I'd personally recommend the Beatles Abbey Road if you're into that sort of music. Dark Side of the Moon is cool too but can get overwhelming. Make sure you get plenty of rest and eat before because eating during can get...complicated and you're going to need that energy.   Just let go and keep swimming :) Have fun  Edit: I want a full report on your mission when you get back private. Over n out."

Psychonaut,3d8c8y,smokedick,10,Tue Jul 14 08:18:29 2015 UTC,"The ""fry your brain"" myth is so bad, we'll be cleaning up after that one for a while. That's very common, to stare off at nothing while your mind is ticking over. It's not a negative sign of anything, it's you purely taking the time to contemplate what is on your mind.  Relax man, perspective is everything. Your mind plays a huge role in the imaginary landscape you perceive at all times. If you start criticising yourself it will lead you to feel unhappy about yourself, which leads on to further self criticism. It's the same with anxiety, paranoia, and even happiness. We don't fully know how consciousness works, but a lot of it is habit. What you'll learn to do is to correct yourself when you're being silly. I once abruptly stopped laughing and became ""objective"" because I considered the possibility that it doesn't make sense to laugh at a word because of the way it sounds.  You must accept that these anxious, fearful, panicky tendencies are a part of you. But you also must accept that they are a waste of conscious energy. Don't jump on modern society's bandwagon of disorder this and disorder that - they are mental habits and you can overcome them. The only problem is that in order to know these things you must prove it to yourself.  Good luck bro. Stop whenever you feel the need to. You are what matters here. You will still go on the journey of self discovery with or without them; they only help to give your imagination a kick to think outside the box in order to see a solution that was previously inconceivable."

I have always referred to it as brain fog.  Basically I've found that having no drug metabolites in my system, getting healthy consistent sleep, getting proper exercise, avoiding sugar spikes and crashes, doing routine meditatation, practicing present moment awareness and strangely achieving stuff/'making progress' each individually give me a little more 'energy'. I'm pretty sure making a routine of such a lifestyle would be one of the best things I could do.   Achieving all of these in one day is basically a guaranteed great day for me, and so many of my peers actually do all these, yet even after tangibly feeling the benefits and influence of them I often don't do more than two consistently because I'm lazy. Now if I think about my friends who are depressed, they all coincidentally fail in some of these areas. It's possible there are placebos+coincidence at work here, and anyway all this information is pretty much obsolete as it's just common sense.   But still, if you neglect some of these areas maybe try and achieve them for a week. In my opinion bodily state and health really limit what the mind is capable of.  Good luck :)"

Psychonaut,3d5d7z,antimattermage,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:59:53 2015 UTC,For some reason reading this made me really emotional
Psychonaut,3d5d7z,workaccountoftoday,2,Tue Jul 14 01:52:59 2015 UTC,"That's kind of one thought I had been having for a while but really just stopped.  I really was curious if all that I observe is just something I'm creating.  And well, I realized that may be true, but if so it's not a part of me I will ever have control of.  I have not successfully changed my reality through sheer will alone.  I definitely feel as if I'm a passenger, and not in the drivers seat.  I can help guide where I go, but ultimately I am not directly responsible for all the things that happen outside of my body.  Mostly I come to the realization that yeah my mind is tight as hell, but I am but one mind of many available to me.  These other minds have come to many of the same conclusions as mine, but also a load of conclusions far different than the ones I have realized.    Really I just wanted to see how powerful my mind can get.  I tried to imagine as much as I could.  I only got so far, even under the influence of psychs.  That was enough for me to think that what I experience is strictly me, and that while I am part of everything else I do not control it.  I spent a lot of time in my mind on psychs, perhaps too long.  I enjoy travelling back there from time to time, but I also enjoy seeing what the physical me can experience as well.  The outer world has so much more than my inner world has managed to develop.  It's so much better at keeping my thoughts down, and making sense of it all.  Shits just on another level than what my mind lets me see.  Trying to talk to other people about it is just the icing on the cake.  Seeing how everyone else describes what could easily be the same experience.  Our descriptions are guided by the unique growth we've achieved, and gathering input from others makes our descriptions far superior to what they could have been just by myself.  Every year other humans are creating faster and faster, while I realize I'm designing the landscape of my mind.  I try a bit more all the time to be proactive on bringing that to the outer world.  This is just the path I have chosen however.  For all I know, all we are is the imagination of something greater that chose to never stop imagining what could be.  As is such things get more and more complex all the time.  But then I realize they've always been this complex, and that we just didn't realize the complexity of it yet.  And as myself now, I only have so much time to learn about the complexity of it all.  It's a huge balancing act, that's for sure."
Psychonaut,3d5d7z,antimattermage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:22:19 2015 UTC,"Its a lot easier to change your perception of reality than what seems physical. For instance through will and concentration you can learn to view the outside world with your mind rather than through your senses. It happens all the time, you just need to be still enough. With no pertubations of consciousness you can see the ether clearly, and learn to bend the space around you with your mind directly. There are forms of space that allow you to percieve in different ways. Making an arc can let you get a glimpse of the world. A circle lets you slowly spiral your awareness into motion. I like to make a double sided spiral and self reflect the observed and observed."
Psychonaut,3d5d7z,OrbitRock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:29:19 2015 UTC,"What does that really do for you though?  Not trying to sound condescending, I'm just curious as to how it affects your experience because I have no experience trying that.  And what exactly are you getting a glimpse of?"
Psychonaut,3d6en2,turbotub,3,Mon Jul 13 21:54:09 2015 UTC,"I almost want to go up to people and be like, ""Hey, why are you doing that with your body?"" Getting pretty weird here."
Psychonaut,3d6en2,workaccountoftoday,2,Mon Jul 13 21:54:42 2015 UTC,"What really makes you question why they're doing that?  I mean, are you questioning why I'm responding to you right now?  My mind and body are very separated from yours.  And we function similarly.  I haven't done DMT so I can't really relate to what you're feeling exactly, so any explanation will help me!"
Psychonaut,3d6en2,workaccountoftoday,2,Mon Jul 13 21:56:37 2015 UTC,do you ever wonder what animates you?
Psychonaut,3d6en2,workaccountoftoday,2,Mon Jul 13 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely so!  I just don't imagine I'm going to figure that out by myself, and likely not during my lifetime.  But I never stop wondering.  I just accept that I am."
Psychonaut,3d6en2,Gordon_Black,2,Mon Jul 13 22:35:54 2015 UTC,"I don't, I don't accept that you just are, or that I just am. I can almost see the difference between the way a person drives their body around, and who they are inside. ""What animates you"" - is a clear question that can indeed be figured out.   We are animate only to the extent that we were allowed to be animate in infancy. You can see people's parents in their very acts, 20, 30 years after the face. It's fascinating. DMT has blasted me outside of the rather strict life enforced by a nervous mother. I am free now. And I can almost see others who are not free, I almost want to ask them what's wrong..."
Psychonaut,3d6en2,pdpbigbang,3,Mon Jul 13 22:54:48 2015 UTC,"To me the only truth out there is very clearly that I am.  Everything that happens to me is really just surrounded by that experiencing of being.  It's not that we shouldn't try to figure it out, it's that it's certainly a lot of effort.  I legitimately want to pursue neuroscience to work towards finding out such answers, but I don't think I'm in a good place to be able to find a career in that just yet.  I think it's hard to judge whether someone is free or not.  I truly feel much more free than I did prior to drug use, but I also sought out drug use, it didn't just get forced upon me.  I always had the undying curiosity about the world and how it works, but I know others don't.  I don't find it necessary to assume they are miserable, but maybe they actually are.  One wise saying though is always sit on your trips.  I can't say how long it's been since your DMT experience, but I know even from some of my most intense trips I learn something new from that experience even years after the fact."
Psychonaut,3d5c64,TheoryCat,8,Mon Jul 13 17:24:54 2015 UTC,"I got caught in turbulent water under a water fall.  Basically the water ""spins"" into a never ending cycle.  I was told i spent about 7 minuets in there getting air and calling for help only a couple of times.  I have never been so tired or scared and panic as i was then.  Eventually i couldn't fight the water anymore and just gave up.  Right then i just started to feel really good.  It was not a high, just a really good feeling.  after a couple seconds i hit the bottom of the river which was like 10-12 feet deep.  Because it was deep enough there the water was not turbulent and eventual pushed me out and i floated to the top.  I was just floating on my back and I could hear my parents screaming/crying.  I finally floated to the edge under a cliff where paramedics where already lowering a life jacket to me.  It took me like 20 minuets to regain the strength to swim across to the other side even though the water was super calm there.    It was because i had just given up that I'm not dead.    That was a particular rainy year and 3 people had already drowned there and 5 more needed saving  How does it feel? It's not fun, eye opening, I did not have a appifiny or spiritual experience.  It was chaotic and I went into survival mode.  Doing the best I can so that my parents did not have to watch me die."

I was in a bad place and decided a car accident would be an easy way to go out so my family and friends wouldn't know it was intentional. I might have a picture of the wreck if your interested. I just took it out in a field at 90mph went for a rollover but ended up front flipping the suburban. It flipped a few times and I ended up getting out without so much as a scratch. I wasn't even sore the next day.  My life didn't flash before my eyes, but I got a lot of transmission fluid in them.   The next 6 months however was comparable to an lsd ""afterglow"".

I smoked way, way too much DMT over a few days, and I ended up completely convinced that I was dead. It only lasted the five to ten minutes, and after that I was completely fine, believe it of not. Hell of a five to to ten minutes, though."
Psychonaut,3d5c64,hashmon,2,Tue Jul 14 02:00:07 2015 UTC,"I kinda had a heart attack back in 2012 when I was 20 (go figure, left ventricle isn't pumping well enough) and spent 3 nights in the hospital. On the 4th day I was scheduled for electric shocks to the chest in order to reboot my heart in the chance of it regaining a normal beat. Gotta mention that in that period I was living by myself in a different country and didn't tell anyone as I didn't want people to worry.   When I was due for the shocks, they carried to stretcher in the ""operation room"", got surrounded by a bunch of doctors and some interns from Canada whom asked me a few questions as it was a rare case. Put me to sleep, woke up afterwards fine.  I didn't have a spiritual awakening or anything like that but it did make me appreciate life a bit more and changed my perspective on a few things. No strong paradigm shift, just an increase sense of awareness, appreciation and gratefulness for day to day life."

Psychonaut,3d5tal,elcapitansalsa,3,Mon Jul 13 23:31:27 2015 UTC,"I think the key factor in all of these things is mindfulness. Brushing your teeth or doing the dishes becomes a spiritual exercise when you pull yourself into the moment and are mindful about what you're doing. Sometimes I sing or something while I do so; helps me to be present, especially if I'm singing from memory."

Someone's telephone?  Now walk around, paying attention to every sound in your hearing.  This is something you can do anywhere, any time, any place.  You can also do this with touch.  Feel every part of your body, including your nose and the air moving on your skin and in and out of your lungs.  You can also do this with vision.  Don't move, just become aware of everything in your field of view.  All the way to the left.  All the way to the right.  Peripheral vision all around you.  Now walk around outside, being aware of everything in your field of view.  You can do this anywhere at any time to re-center and reacquaint yourself with the beloved magic that surrounds you and embraces you every moment of every day."

So for me to achieve that sense, anything that functions on muscle memory and you don't have to focus on gives you the same thing. Obviously mediation and things will work better since there's nothing to do but think, but really like the one guy said cleaning dishes too. I personally run for an hour to just let my mind freely think or really listen to music."

Because we would need GOOD teachers who can prescribe the psychedelics and have people learn about them before they actually trip.    And you see how our school systems are now...  But if I were to think about allowing my children to do it under my supervision, I think they would turn out alright.  A lot more open minded and peaceful."
Psychonaut,3d54qa,LivingInTheVoid,2,Mon Jul 13 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"I do that that the psychedelic experience can be used as a tool to spawn advanced ideas, or at least precursors to ideas that could expand on existing ideas.   We need studies done on psychedelics to see their uses and effects, and we need to keep pushing for that to become a reality. There is much more to the psychedelic experience than just hallucinations and psychosis likes we've been led to believe."

Psychonaut,3d6ify,solusipses,3,Mon Jul 13 22:21:33 2015 UTC,"Shit I don't even know how I'd deal with such a strong trip and I've tripped loads.  Granted I don't know the dosage of any I've taken.  I've done 3 tab trips that were nice, and 2 tab trips that sent me beyond where I wanted to be."
Psychonaut,3d6ify,workaccountoftoday,3,Mon Jul 13 23:48:56 2015 UTC,"I would definitely not go up that much in one shot.  I went from one fairly strong tab to two fairly strong tabs and that was waaaaaay too much at the time.  The problem is, if you take more than you actually want, you're in for a long ride.  The difference between 1 tab and 1.5 tabs can be profound.  If you really think 1 tab was weak, take 2.  If it's LSD, I don't think you'll be dissatisfied.  But do not take more than 2 until you try 2 tabs first.  You can also do a bunch of different things to amplify or alter the experience.  For example, you can fast for 12 or 24 hours before taking it.  Or, smoke some good marijuana during the peaks.  Take it at night (night tripping is a very different animal, I might not recommend this if you are particularly afraid of the dark).  If you were inside, go outside.  If you were outside, go inside.  Be alone (tripping while alone is utterly different than tripping by yourself.  I would NOT NOT NOT recommend this on a drug or a dosage you are not quite familiar with ahead-of-time)."

It's been a loong time since I've had a very visual trip.  Typically I just feel as if I'm staring into infinity, and then disappear form reality.  I've had people tell me I start acting strange and one time even speaking like a black lady, while I have no recollection of the acts.  And this is on dosages of 2 hits...  At best I've had some infinitely sprawling CEVs but never anything open eye.  Maybe LSD just isn't for me at strong doses."
Psychonaut,3d6ify,workaccountoftoday,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:06:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear about the blacking out.  You aren't at all sleep deprived, right?  Although even when I drop on a late Friday night I'm still up for another 12 hours.  For me visuals start at the 150ug mark, so 2 hits of 100ug each should get you there.  That is the dose my boyfriend likes.  Honestly, and I don't want to sound alarming or anything, but I wonder if what you have is really LSD, or some RC being sold as it.    What is your experience with other psychedelics?  I've had friends with really weird reactions to marijuana (one poor kid really wanted to smoke, but it made him sick every time,) and mushrooms give me cramps/gas to no end.  So it could just be your body :(  But first I'd probably try someone else's LSD, just to make sure it's the real deal."
Psychonaut,3d6ify,DranoTheCat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:19:13 2015 UTC,"The source I had it from was a guy who had been selling some good shit for a while.  To be fair it was only his shit, but I mean at least according to him and our many mutual friends who met people part of ""the family"" often and even went to lay his own sheets from the crystal.  This was a guy I've known for a while so it's not like I can really just assume he's lying.  The blacking out always happened during a time I just felt like a remembering of being in a place more familiar than anything I've been in before as if it was truly real, that time was folding on itself and I would be experiencing all of my future and past before I would be allowed to return to my body.  I never really recall any of this time crunch, just remember communicating with myself vividly on how I believed everyone had experienced LSD and this was just a part of life during growing up, and how there was a reason it was illegal and because everyone realized how real it was and how frightening it could be.  And I've had fake LSD before, which honestly that just gave me visuals and kind of fucked my head up.  I've used RC's a lot, and have been in similar spots during 2c-b trips granted I wasn't as afraid then.  During one 2c-b trip I didn't start until after drinking and having some cocaine I sort of blacked out, but more so felt as though I entered all of time and became everything.  It seemed black again, and just seemed like it was time folded in on itself and I was everything at once and it was beautiful and peaceful.  The whole time during this I was walking around with a friend at an outdoor music festival in our downtown.  I just was laughing the whole time according to her.  I ended up staying up a good part of that night with another 6 hours or so of feeling as though I was still somewhat under the influence, though I was completely aware by then."

If you thought it was weak go for 2 tabs, but you seriously need to get comfortable in this psychedelic state before embarking that high, its a long high at that dose and you're gonna get totally confused unless you know a couple basic ways to keep your mind and body in check. I really don't recommend just taking 5+ tabs and expecting a good time to happen. My sweet spot is 2 or 3 well dosed tabs, that's what I enjoy, even after 100+ trips."

Psychonaut,3d3hsb,atticusmass,2,Mon Jul 13 05:46:29 2015 UTC,"Mandalas as an art form have been around for quite some time. Simplicity or Complexity, it makes no difference. A mandala is pleasing to the observer.  Why is this so?  Lets start first with you the observer. You are not seeing reality as it is. You are seeing the constructed version of reality your mind has created. This is to make sense of the myriad of information that pours through your senses. These constructions turn into a force of their own and hold power within the mind. They are what Carl Jung coined as Archetypes. Archetypes are examples or representations of reality.   Based on the Pain and Pleasure system our body has, we interpret these representations or Archetypes as either ""good"" or ""bad"". When you see someone strong and beautiful, the archetype of beauty in the mind triggers you to recognize that as good. When you see someone fighting, this triggers the archetype of struggle, which is deemed as bad in your mind and it is to be avoided.  We carry these representations with everything we see and do. It permeates our dualistic understanding of our world. We are constantly in a battle to make sense of ourselves and the world around us, putting things together that don't seemingly fit. The cohesion of two opposite forces brings about a unified whole. Unity is what we constantly strive for.  When you see a Mandala, you are seeing a representation of unity. There are parts and incongruities, but all are connected within the mandala. This triggers the archetype of Unity and is something we deem as comforting and pleasing to the eye. Just as we are all essentially connected to the world around us, the mandala represents that which we innately feel. Whole and unbounded.   Creating Mandalas is one practice to help bring about an understanding of an experience. Stanislav Grof would use mandala drawing after difficult sessions of Holotropic Breathwork. He used it  as a way for patients to integrate the lessons learned during their altered states of consciousness. Carl Jung used this as well to deal with dreams, fantasies, and schizophrenic episodes that he had in his life. I believe this is a powerful method of active meditation and focus that can benefit many people. You don't have to be particularly good at doing it. Just make sure you stick to a theme and let it unfold as you go.   TL;DR Mandalas are rad and help with concepts that are hard to articulate. Come over to /r/mandalas"

Psychonaut,3d65et,TheMuseumDose,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:09 2015 UTC,"The Museum Dose is a collection of essays documenting a young man's twelve psychedelically mediated visits to a range of New York museums, galleries, and concert halls to encounter specific collections, shows, installations, and musical performances. Drawing from his knowledge of the contemporary underground mind-altering pharmacopeia, he carefully selected a different molecular compound and the ideal dosage (the ""museum dose"") to heighten each of these experiences.  Daniel's open-hearted temperament combined with the drug-induced raw emotional states and heightened perceptions permitted him to let the art he encountered trigger deeply visceral soul searching and some extraordinary transcendental moments, all of which he describes beautifully. He also vividly captures the flows and paradoxes of life in New York City, a major protagonist throughout, and he is a keen observer of contemporary mores.  This book is in many ways profoundly unfashionable: there is no hint of irony here. This is a young man sincerely wrestling with the deepest questions, seeking to open his mind and his heart and find his way in life, and if you open your mind and heart to this young writer's exciting debut, you will be moved and transported, whatever your feelings about his admittedly unconventional method."

The word 'theory' is often somewhat misused; neither of these men could have come to their conclusions without exhaustive research and a profound ability to connect dots. If we limit ourselves strictly to what can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and cast away all other ideas, we're doing our potential for discovery a great disservice. I won't call theories facts, but I'm also capable of being convinced by a good scholar rather than a brain scan. Anyways, I'm surprised that this is rarely considered by skeptics of the idea that DMT is active in dreams. It's a simple consideration of set and setting."

I've been close, a pubes width from death three times but haven't had any equipment to measure brain activity. But your mind ""GOES"" somewhere during an ordeal that is hard to explain. It doesn't seem too out there to think that if the process goes UN-interrupted then freaky shit happens that only you can see.    what doesn't sound good is the evolutionary side of matters. It's the wrong ends of the equation we have questions for, for evolution to even be a useful thought tool. So in that regard i agree with u/rawrnnn for saying.   Such brain function could never possibly be selected for, so it almost certainly doesn't work that way.   There is another side to this issue which really gets my attention and I'm sure im not alone. It's that when you hear these places described, see images extracted(recreated), talk about the residual ideas from others and finally seeing it yourself(my last uncompleted step). Why does it make my hair stand on end? Why is it these words people use when describing the ineffable elicit such and emotionally familiar feeling? Even though that person describing it is adamant the words used are as good as junk?

I would say that a psychedelic drug is not exactly responsible for all the crazy things you see when taking them, they merely lift the mind's systems out of the way to let you see the truth behind, and each drug does the lifting in a different way at a different rate, but once lifted, it's the same. So whether you take psychedelics, come close to death, or actually die, your mind will be out of the way either way. You don't need drugs for this, you just need to get rid of the mind."

For example I see salvia as an old crone who is showing you her crystal ball or Mary Jane who just wants to kick back and chill with you. And what I mean by that is you can become familiar with HOW they are.  I respect drugs, and with that respect comes restraint. Like any good friend you share good with the bad, so the idea isn't to get too comfortable with them but to learn from them. It's the curtain drop on the theater floor, so don't let them catch you with your pants down."

Also, how can we conclude that God has limited resources at His end, and therefore desires that Humans follow a Purpose (or plan).   We subject God to existence, we invented the Goddess to imbue us with purpose. God(ess) has limited resources only in that Human has ""Free Will"". ""The Path"" is another product of reason, for their to be infinite paths there surely is a ""Correct"" one.    Why? What is the purpose of this type of universe?   I think you did a pretty good job of answering this one yourself. But heres my take: Eternity gets boring after exploring infinity. Not from a lack of meaning, just perspective. It makes sense to have the option to 'forget' and get lost in a ""old"" perspectives in a new way. Simply making the ride more interesting.   Why do people seek meaning?   After language was formed and bits of info began to spread, I imagine the search for meaning is just the higher form of threat detection and the ""Meaning of Life"" question is the final one we(you) haven't answered yet.   There is no more room for thinking beyond what there is (physical realm) and what could be (imagination, dreams, etc.). Thus, that is all that we can encounter.   This is the burden of using a micro-scope, you cannot see outside the lens. Those experiences are outside the boundaries of perception from within this dimension.   Ultimately, The Meaning of life is to seek Meaning in Life. You know meaning when YOU see it. It resonates deeply when you do. In this case all statements are true, There is no meaning, There is nothing BUT meaning but it has to mean something to you. Dualism at this level secures infinite possibilities for perspective based data. To shut out all but one line of data from one perspective would make it easier to isolate synchronicity and lesser intersecting event lines to better see the nexus point for say... some sort of spark for complex process to either begin or finish.    So there's a hint of the answer but even if personal truth in the matter were common knowledge to each person. What's so great about it? How can we use it to Save/conquer the World? But that's off topic for this thread..... Btw we(Humans) ARE The God/Goddess duo, each one of us. We are multitudes of perspectives anchored in meat-vessels,"

Psychonaut,3d3lhe,Didymos_Black,3,Mon Jul 13 13:15:58 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't that relate to all people then?  There is intimacy in every relationship, but when that relationship ends, we move on.  The only healthy way to never ""get over"" a relationship is to have learned something from it.  That way, that person becomes a part of who you are.  They already are by the experience, but recognizing and accepting it is healthy.  I think there are two ways in which one ""gets over"" an ex though.  There is letting go of the pain and sorrow of a relationship ended, and there is coming to terms with what that person was in your life and accepting that they no longer fill that role.  I think it's very important to do both, but someone who you've shared a life with should not be forgotten.  Our fragile plastic minds though, cannot be trusted to hold these memories at the forefront, thus people are frequently forgotten.  Psychedelics have reminded me of some people lingering in the dusty depths of my psyche that were important.  On the other hand, some people I think of nearly every day of my life and cannot forget no matter how hard I try.  There are a lot of personal issues that one has to work through if they cannot accept the absence of someone in their life.  But as a psychonaut, it's important to realize that ""I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.""  I don't understand what you mean by not ""deserving"" to get over another.  That's pretty judgmental even for this list, the rest of which I agree with.  Saying humans don't deserve catharsis or closure from a relationship is, well, kind of evil.  In my current relationship, there is nothing to ""get over.""  I am with my significant other.  Someday that might not be.  I love her and she loves me.  But she is dependent on me while I am independent of her.  I don't rely on her for happiness, so while an ending of the relationship would sadden me, the only thing for me to get over would be that experience of sadness.  And as Dan Millman once wrote: ""Let the feelings flow, then let them go.""  Emotions and feelings are an illusion.  And I like the way Maynard James Keenan expresses it in Parabola:   This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone in This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal All this pain is an illusion."

If you couldn't tell by item number 10, this list is pretty satirical. It isn't even essential to take shrooms to increase awareness. I see life as a mountain. Learning, meditating, acting, reacting- all of these things are taking steps up this mountain. Growth moves up the mountain. Looking back down is the awareness obtained. Psychedelics can be a helicopter ride straight to the top of the mountain. Though you can't stay there, you see what it is like to have such an awareness. You see everything. You understand.  I would like to give just a small piece of advice, as I find it really encouraging that you are ""relearning how to dream"". Intention is everything. Set the intention before sleep.

I don't see any of these values as 100% definite solutions. They are just suggestions. They are open enough to add to or take away.

However, I would not have had the same experiences experimenting with them in my early twenties as I have had in my mid-thirties.  In my late twenties there was a time that I may have had the same breakthroughs, but on the other hand, I think not."
Psychonaut,3d3lhe,Jim_E_Hat,3,Mon Jul 13 09:51:15 2015 UTC,"Had a breakthrough last year. As a fourteen year old. Simply improved the way I looked at life; completely flip-flopped it. I was a borderline sadist with no consideration for other people's feelings. I never use the word ""hate"" any more. I've learned to love all life, it's okay if I dislike someone, but I still love them. Age doesn't matter, as long as you're well educated on the subject."

Psychonaut,3d3lhe,pdpbigbang,3,Mon Jul 13 13:13:05 2015 UTC,"I was into recreational drugs in my early 20s.  Psychedelics would have been meaningless to me spiritually at that point in time.  Even earlier this year when I started doing them, I wasn't sure why I was doing them.  It took an ego death to remind me of the path I'd already started.  Psychedelics aren't for everyone, imo.  Some people are not ready in this iteration of life.  They may have fun, they may experience ego death, and it might fuck them up, and unless they come to the conclusion that there is something to investigate, it's just a passing experience.    Some people are past the need.  We are trying to become those that are past the need.  Also, I've met some genuinely dumb people in my life.  I can't imagine someone with a room-temperature IQ getting much from psychedelics.  On the other hand, perhaps IQ can change though the experience.  I'm not an authority."
Psychonaut,3d3lhe,pdpbigbang,3,Mon Jul 13 13:31:48 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from. The fact that I was really questioning everything in my life, seeking truth, looking within myself, most likely really contributed to my experiencing exactly what I needed to. Salvia was my first real ego-death. It's impossible to understand something like that, no matter how much research you do. However, I do believe research helps. It helps put you in that frame of mind. I know when I read about one-ness and the interconnected-ness of all things, I was like ""yeah, okay."" But to experience it as objectively as possible... no, to be in it. That is something else entirely. It is less about belief at that point and more ""this happened""."

Hints that feel like favor, but is just your truest self revisiting ""our"" life to add some flavor.   Isn't it true that if you glimpse past the glow of inspiration and into the realm of implication you tend to get the slight terror from what you must do once you choose this illusive path you've been called to! I've thus far not ""acted"" on these signs to change course, but my mind still seeks them, I watch, listen,think,talk, chase synchrony, and above all March forth."

Psychonaut,3d2rz8,dirtyrickyslants,11,Mon Jul 13 05:09:00 2015 UTC,Tripping came from the fact that you were going on a trip to a different world.

Psychonaut,3d2rz8,legitasl3alls,2,Mon Jul 13 06:54:20 2015 UTC,I like that explanation.  I wonder if it's true.  Perhaps the internet should make it so?
Psychonaut,3d2rz8,Didymos_Black,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:18:06 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt the people who invented the term ""Tripping"" knew fuck-all aboot Tryptamines. But before you assume I'm sane, I DO believe that it was a coincidence, intersecting waves of novelty that got around/through language in some weird way. Either that or the word ""Tryptamine"" was the actual product of ""tripping""."
Psychonaut,3d2rz8,SAGNUTZ,2,Mon Jul 13 09:54:52 2015 UTC,"Uncertainty surrounds the first slang usage of the term. US slang lexicographer Peter Tamony argued in American Speech (Summer 1981) that the term was first used in a slang sense by Jack Gelber in The Connection, a 1957 play dealing with heroin addicts. Tammony privately conceded that the usage was ""not a smoking gun,"" an in retrospect it appears more figurative than slang. The Oxford English Dictionary points to Norman Mailer's 1959 Advertisements for Myself, in which Mailer wrote of taking mescaline and of ""a long and private trip"", but there is no evidence that Mailer's use reflected a colloquial understanding and was not simply literary metaphor. Similarly, in a 1963 article about LSD in Playboy, Alan Harrington used the term ""trip"" but again the context suggests metaphor, not slang. The slang sense of the word is indelibly associated with Ken Kesey and his LSD-taking Merry Pranksters. In 1964, Ken Kesey bought a soon-to-be-famous International Harvester school bus in the name of Intrepid Trips, Inc., suggesting an already current, if private, slang sense. In September 1999, Kesey wrote about his recollection of the first use of the term: ""I think it came from our bus trip in 1964, when (Neal) Cassady said 'This trip is a trip.""    — excerpt from The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English"
Psychonaut,3d2rz8,veridikal,2,Mon Jul 13 13:16:18 2015 UTC,"Although the etymology of the phrase remains unclear, a poster in the psychedelic drug enthusiast BlueLight[5] forum claims the use of phrase “tripping balls” dates as far back as 1985, referring to bouncy balls that served as talismans to help people connect with reality while under the effects of a hallucinogen. One of the earliest mentions online comes from the post script of a drug report on the online psychoactive plants and chemicals library Erowid[7]submitted on June 13th, 2000. The phrase has been increasingly used in popular novels, films and TV shows, with the earliest notable mentions found in the 2004 comedy film Harold & Kumar Goes to White Castle and numerous episodes of South Park.[12] First time I heard it was H&K go to White Castle."
