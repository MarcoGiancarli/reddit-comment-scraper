Gameboy,3e4e9x,Pablos-Corner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:05 2015 UTC,It looks like a shit load of vertical lines. I think those are the easy to fix ones but I would wait for someone more experienced to answer.
Gameboy,3e4e9x,Aintence,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:12:17 2015 UTC,I thought that was the case but it seems to be more than just dead lines. The screen seems kind of garbled up vertical-wise.
Gameboy,3e4e9x,Aintence,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:18:03 2015 UTC,Yeah most of the cases I've seen have few lines. In ur case it seems like most of them are broken.

Gameboy,3e30bm,the_8bit_kingdom,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, If you're using something like 90% isopropyl you dont really have anything to worry about. Just like slather it on there and rotate the wheel all the way in both directions for a min or 2. add more alcohol, scrub a little, wiggle the wheel around a bit more. Make sure it's totally dry before turning on. like 8Bit said use compressed air or quickly and sharply blow into it to remove access liquid"

Gameboy,3e0mss,HWTneub68,2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:18 2015 UTC,"Nooo those are NOT the typical vertical lines that are fixable with a soldering iron. Those lines are just plain dead all the time, and you'll find that YOUR vertical lines change with the display, and they line up with what's on the screen. Look at the lines coming off the letters in TETRIS. The effect will be more pronounced once you start the game and move pieces left and right.  I have a gameboy that does this as well, and I haven't found what the problem is. There must be a loose connection somewhere, but I don't know where it is. Keep us posted if you find anything."
Gameboy,3e0mss,alanbbent,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:54 2015 UTC,"Seconded.  I've seen this exact symptom before, but couldn't figure out what caused it.  I found that putting pressure on certain parts of the PCB affected the lines by either making them disappear or get worse.  It's definitely not the same issue that can be fixed by soldering the ribbon cable at the bottom of the screen."

Gameboy,3dvv8e,Aintence,4,Sun Jul 19 23:31:47 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that you get either a Gameboy Color or a GBA SP. A frontlit Color is very good if you want to have the old school feel to it, if you feel like frontlighting the experience gets much more enjoyable. I would even say that my frontlit GBC has as good, if not better screen than my AGS-001. It is my favorite gameboy by far. (over AGS-101)  If you want just to play the games and thats all you care about I would suggest that you get a GBA SP. This is because it can play DMG games, GBC games and GBA games. However I don't really feel its worth it to even buy a AGS-001, the AGS-101 is like 100x better."
Gameboy,3dvv8e,20V_Mk2,2,Sun Jul 19 23:46:34 2015 UTC,"How did you mod your frontlit color? I have two so far, one I did myself and one I bought from eBay. On both I've been disappointed as the screen looks washed out to me with the light over it."
Gameboy,3dvv8e,iliekgaemz,2,Mon Jul 20 04:17:45 2015 UTC,"What method did you use? Mine is a HHL frontlight bonded with loca, and I have a glass screen for it.

Gameboy,3dvv8e,20V_Mk2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:54:35 2015 UTC,"I have one I did with the Kitsch Bent light. That one doesn't have LOCA. The other one does have loca, I don't know what light they used. The one that has loca isn't too bad, but a lot of the nuance in the GBC's color palette is still stripped out. It wasn't too annoying at first but after I decided to play my stock GBC in full light for comparison, I was blown away by how rich the colors were in comparison to my frontlit."
Gameboy,3dvv8e,iliekgaemz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:02:01 2015 UTC,How does one back light gbc. I've only seen front light.   I go to a lot of local car boot sales and look for anything gameboy relayed (got gba fairly cheap but I think I will sell it).  My budget is under 20 quid so  ags101 (35-60quid) is out of question. Micro goes for even more.
Gameboy,3dvv8e,gewehr7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:55:33 2015 UTC,"Next best thing to an ags101 is an ags001 and after that, a normal Advance. In this case, ""best"" means most features out of the box. If you want to play as many Zelda and Pokemon games as possible, you should only get a version of advance if you are only going to get one gameboy because they can play all gameboy games. But you said you can't stand no light. A lit gameboy is more expensive so you need to make a choice. Sacrifice the light to save money or spend money for a light. As a side note, I backlit a Gameboy Pocket for 20USD total cost. Gameboy cost me $10, $6.50 for backlight, $3.50 in total shipping costs. The problem with that, in your case, is that the Pocket only plays original Gameboy games and a very select few Color games. You are probably going to have to compromise somewhere."
Gameboy,3dvv8e,20V_Mk2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:09:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant to say frontlight. Not really sure why I kept saying backlight. However my backlit DMG is also very good.  As for price, you just have to watch the local classifieds. I just found a AGS-101 for $25, and it came with FireRed and Emerald."
Gameboy,3dvv8e,iliekgaemz,4,Mon Jul 20 01:29:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly the AGS-001 isn't that bad. I used one for years before just recently trading a bit of my collection for a 101.   It will play every Game Boy game from the original DMG games through the GBA ones.  The frontlight is just fine visibility wise. Yeah the backlit 101 is pretty but the frontlight gets the job done just fine.  The rechargeable battery is a lot more convenient than constantly swapping batteries out.  Don't feel bad about not getting a 101. You can get one eventually, as funds allow, they're not going anywhere.   As for the Micro, that is one cool piece of hardware, but it is not an ideal primary console. It can only play GBA games and nothing else. The screen is also a lot smaller so text-heavy games can be a pain. Save that one for later on down the line too.  TL;DR get an AGS-001. Play all your games. Be happy."
Gameboy,3dvv8e,20V_Mk2,3,Mon Jul 20 04:16:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that a AGS-001 is the best Gameboy to enjoy the games, if you are on a budget."
Gameboy,3dvv8e,onemorereddit,3,Mon Jul 20 05:05:50 2015 UTC,"To everyone mentioning the AGS-001 --- I find that the dim screen is just fine for for any GB/GBC game, and sometimes too dim for GBA games. It's probably a matter AGS-001.  For what it's worth, I have an old DS Lite that I use to play GBA games and the screen is gorgeous."
Gameboy,3dvv8e,kc0nlh,2,Tue Jul 21 01:13:54 2015 UTC,I recommend a frontlight GBC or a GBA SP AGS-001
Gameboy,3dvv8e,jamesjoyce1882,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:32:36 2015 UTC,"You can find an ags 101 for $40 or less if you're patient on ebay. The key is to look at all gba sp offerings that are not marked as 101, and then look at the pictures.  If you can afford only one machine, I would highly recommend doing that. The 101 has by far the best display of all consoles from the gameboy line.  I would strongly advise AGAINST a front-lit GBC. Not only is that more expensive than a 101, it also looks like crap in comparison (and I got mine from one of the best modders here, still no good).  The DS Lite is the best display for GBA games, but the ergonomics are a bit awkward. You might also look into the Revo K101, if you don't mind non-original hardware."
Gameboy,3dvv8e,jamesjoyce1882,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:36 2015 UTC,Ags101 never made it to UK aparently so if I were to find one on ebay then they are advertised as super ultra rare with price tripled.
Gameboy,3dvv8e,megants,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:09 2015 UTC,"Well, in that case I concur with the advice to get a normal GBA SP.  Just one more thing to be aware of with all GBA SPs: classic gameboy cartridges stick halfway out at the bottom, leading you to touch the cartridge and possibly the label with your sweaty palms.

Gameboy,3dwg12,ArcadeGoon,0,Mon Jul 20 02:47:36 2015 UTC,How do I do that?  is there any other way?
Gameboy,3dwg12,ArcadeGoon,0,Mon Jul 20 02:49:10 2015 UTC,Dumping requires a device to do it. Its a waste of money.
Gameboy,3dwg12,grem75,3,Mon Jul 20 03:09:38 2015 UTC,GBA dumps can be done with a DS and a slot-1 flash cart.
Gameboy,3dwg12,kc0nlh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:28:05 2015 UTC,I find using a device to dump my retail carts to be a very handy thing as it lets me backup the SRAM from my carts with ease. Anyone that wants to get into chiptunes etc would want a dedicated reader writer for easy backup of their carts with lsdj on them. I have a Mega Memory card but I dont trust it. the whole trick of backing up a save to the megamemoy and then from the mega mem to a flash cart is inherntly risky foir the data and I find the direct reader solutions to just work better if you can find a reader that works with modern systems. Id recommend if you want a reader to get the ASM Altane once they release the consumer version. I love my Altane as it makes backing up my Gameboy camera pics a breeze.
Gameboy,3dwg12,Aintence,0,Mon Jul 20 03:32:21 2015 UTC,Ok.  Thank you.
Gameboy,3dwg12,kc0nlh,3,Mon Jul 20 03:12:15 2015 UTC,Mate no one cares if it's legal or not. Ebay doesn't care about fakes being sold so why should you. Police won't arrest you.  In all seriousness. If you were to download roms from a website then Nintendo can't do anything to you cos u didn't break the law. Owner of the website did.
Gameboy,3dwg12,kc0nlh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:14 2015 UTC,That is a good point about ebay.
Gameboy,3dwg12,ArcadeGoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:22:00 2015 UTC,even dumping the ROM's yourself Nintendo frowns on but you know what it at least you feel a bit better knowing you own a legit copy of the game. If you want truly free games I recommend looking into the various homebrew games.
Gameboy,3dwg12,bargainbinz,0,Mon Jul 20 03:02:12 2015 UTC,Thank you.  Is downloading ROM's particularly risky?
Gameboy,3dvigz,maddirtyplumber,3,Sun Jul 19 21:43:02 2015 UTC,Pokemon and Zelda are my typical go too for long trips.
Gameboy,3dvigz,mothman607,3,Sun Jul 19 21:55:53 2015 UTC,My vote goes to Pokemon Silver/Gold/Crystal or Wario Land 3
Gameboy,3dvigz,gewehr7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:28:38 2015 UTC,I never played those. I used to have blue. Are they very similar?  I really liked blue.
Gameboy,3dvigz,gewehr7,3,Sun Jul 19 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"It is similar but very much improved. If you liked Blue, you'll love Silver. There were improvements to gameplay such as a organized backpack, EXP bar that can be seen in battle, a day/night feature that's really cool, real color, and a bunch of new pokemon. It still follows the basic pokemon formula of 8 gyms then the elite four."
Gameboy,3dvigz,gewehr7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:08:41 2015 UTC,Sounds good...what would you say a fair price might be?
Gameboy,3dvigz,metilco,2,Sun Jul 19 23:11:17 2015 UTC,I got a copy on ebay with a new battery in it for $16. I think $20-25 is pretty average.
Gameboy,3dvigz,kc0nlh,3,Sun Jul 19 23:30:16 2015 UTC,"If you've never played past Gen 1 of pokemon, pokemon Gold, Silver, or Crystal would be an awesome way to spend those hours. Considering pokemon resale is high, anywhere from $20-30 is probably fair."

Gameboy,3drdld,chris2webby,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:42:30 2015 UTC,Nintendo never really has crooked labels at all. It's probably a fake bud.

Gameboy,3dtytg,elliottstanger,4,Sun Jul 19 13:09:52 2015 UTC,I'm surprised with how nice the old design of the Gameboy looks on a modern device like a smartphone. Also the modular parts where the cartridge would go is an awesome idea. Much more feasible than say project Ara or something like that.
Gameboy,3dtytg,Kordan9090,4,Sun Jul 19 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that thinks this is dumb as shit?  ""Game Bat"" is a stupid name. Like baseball bat? Vampire bat? Where did they get the bat name?  It attaches in the center, with no supports on the ends so it can easily snap the 2 connectors when it rolls on that axis.  There's no place to put your hands. If you're looking at any Game Boy, the buttons go in the middle of the X-axis so when you wrap your hand around, it's well supported between your 4 fingers and thumbs are in the correct position to press the buttons.  Lastly, ""Power Saving '8-bit' mode""? Forcing the display into grayscale wouldn't save much battery power. Most of the drain of a smartphone battery comes from backlighting the screen. But nice job appealing to nostalgia. /s   we have a friend who specializes in bringing fantastic phone concepts to life   No so much. This is the exact quality of tripe I expect from Gawker Media."

Gameboy,3dtytg,HellsAttack,3,Sun Jul 19 14:56:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that was just my gut reaction. I love my Nintendo handhelds but I really believe they couldn't bring much to the table.  Smartphones trade on the latest tech in the smallest package and Nintendo handhelds always use affordable, durable, years old components. It's very telling that Nintendo's never made a device with a glass screen.  There's really no overlap."
Gameboy,3dtytg,Aintence,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:18:26 2015 UTC,They look cool and all but I wouldn't pay over 300 quid for such smartphone when there are better ones out already.

The bags I use are readily available by the hundred at most major craftstores.  Ah, they are good stands at a great price but I've found that they only really fit GBA, GBA-SP, Pocket and Micros. The rest of the systems in the GB family seem to either not fit or slide off.  I really, really like THESE the best.

You can use a blade or something similar to peel it off the same way as you would the back one for a back-light mod. Some gb mod shops online should have replacement front polarizers with adhesive on them for easy attachment. I think kitch-bent, asm retro or non-finite should have some.   Alternatively, you can try obtaining a sheet off the front of another handheld's lcd screen, like a GBA, nds, dsi, etc."

Gameboy,3dgynn,DieKatzchen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"Wow that's... really something.  How did they do that through the lens?  Anyway, it's possible to polish glass, but lets start with the least destructive option first.  Clean the screen real good, then apply a screen protector to it.  Just buy one for a smartphone with a bigger screen and cut it down.  The optically clear adhesive will fill the scratches and make the whole thing look good as new.  If that doesn't work then you may have to resort to glass polish, but you might be better off using the parts to repair a DMG in better condition."
Gameboy,3dgynn,DieKatzchen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:35:08 2015 UTC,I can definitely try this. What's the best way to clean the glass?

The battery is a standard lithium ion, sort of like the ones used in a DS except a lot bigger, its connected to two PCBs: a charger and a regulator to give 5volts. The screen is literally mounted in using hot glue and for the buttons, I got the common ground PCB from kitsch-bent and wired it up to the pins on the raspberry pi which runs a program to change the input on the pins to certain keyboard letters to press buttons in an emulator."

I hear that horizontal lines are not easy to fix, if they can be fixed at all.

Gameboy,3d9o7l,ship_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:40:21 2015 UTC,Overall it is an amazing little controller... but I wish the d-pad and buttons were just a bit less mushy and maybe a sticker with pairing instructions on the back.

Gameboy,3d74j0,the_8bit_kingdom,2,Tue Jul 14 05:14:45 2015 UTC,True looking at the pics the screen seems to be in good shape. But you never know might have a bad Ribbon cable etc. I'm sure the cartridge slot could use some cleaning.  It's very hard to Kill a gameboy.

Iwata was the fourth president and CEO of Nintendo Co., Ltd., and CEO of Nintendo of America. When he worked as a programmer at HAL Laboratory in his early career he was considered to be a ""genius programmer"". [citation needed] He joined Nintendo in 2000, and succeeded Hiroshi Yamauchi as the company's president in May 2002. Barron's Magazine named Iwata one of the world's top CEOs, due mostly to the Wii sales, as well as Nintendo's increased stock price. He was the first Nintendo president who was unrelated to the Yamauchi family through blood or marriage.    Image i     Relevant: Nintendo DSi | Wii | Super Smash Bros.

The yarn one I'm particularly proud of, as I think the puzzles get appropriately more difficult and the whole game takes about an hour to finish.  The ball one is actually a remake of the very first game I ever made back in high school. The premise was pretty much the same, but I did make some UI and gameplay adjustments that I thought made it better.   Each game was a new learning experience, and for that one, it was a lesson on structs, which I had just learned and provided a way for me to do pseudo-""object oriented"" programming in C."

Plus: The people that sell those cartridges are making a profit of other peoples work (translators, game devs) so it's not a hair better than piracy or flashcards. In fact it is piracy.  My suggestion would be to spend the money (a little more) on a decent flashcard to play those games you can't get hold of for a reasonable price, those hacked games and those translations you want to try.

If you're searching specifically for the AGS-101 you're going to run into people who know what they're selling and sell it for what it's worth. I've scored a couple of 101s for around $20 by checking all of the listings. Look for ones that have extensive pictures and read the model number off the sticker.

That one was also in flawless condition, and was complete in box.  Given the fact that yours is just the system itself, and the condition its in, I'd say you could probably get around $100 for it. Like others have said, I'd recommend not selling that if it's near and dear to you. I've sold things from my childhood, and almost immediately regretted it.

Gameboy,3d23d6,AH_starwars,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"I have owned one for awhile. It works way better than what you'll find on eBay or Amazon. Its great for DMG, MGB, GBL, GBC, and GBA. GBA SP and the DS family will need a smaller one, and I haven't found a quality one for those yet."

My personal favorites are mainly aesthetic mods with LEDs, this one and this one I made last night.  My soldering and  modding skills haven't gone much farther than backlighting and LED aesthetics.  My most unique non-modded GameBoys are probably my Manchester United red 'Play It Loud,' my white 'Play It Louds' and my Daiei Hawks GameBoy Colors.  My rarest game is definitely Trip World."

Gameboy,3d0n9j,Mowen55,-3,Sun Jul 12 15:01:55 2015 UTC,"So, how do you tell if it is low on battery? Does it blink like the 3ds does? And i don't have any micro-usb adapters/outlets sadly, a wall would be preferred, but thanks for looking ;).  Edit: Also, can it not be from ebay? I would prefer to get it from amazon. :P"
Gameboy,3d0n9j,Mowen55,2,Sun Jul 12 15:26:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure there is not really any way to tell if its low, maybe the LED would be a little dimmer due to less power but besides that its always red. Oh yeah forgot about the amazon prime thing :P (I don't know of any being sold on amazon) and do you not have like a phone charger? like a standard android phone would usually have a microUSB charger.  Also, you say wall charger, somebody correct me if I'm wrong but the wall adapter doesn't actually charge the batteries? Its just for powering it without batteries?"
Gameboy,3d0n9j,autmed,3,Sun Jul 12 15:37:53 2015 UTC,Can confirm.  The LED will always be red as long it is ON. When batteries are low it will be dimmer and/or flicker.
Gameboy,3d0n9j,Mowen55,-2,Sun Jul 12 16:09:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have a phone. And i know the wall charger is for the system, that is just the term that is typically used for the charger for the internal battery, and I don't want to spend a fortune on batteries, so i want the wall adapter (There, i said adapter, you happy? :P)  P.S.: Also, the rest of my family have iPhones which use normal usb."

Gameboy,3czg88,TimesFather,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:34:16 2015 UTC,"Well you should start with whatever you feel is best, I would advise planning what you want to do. For example I'm doing my first gameboy mod too and I started with the DMG as I just happened to have a broken one and it has loads of possibilities. I also used the notes app on my phone to make a list of gameboy parts, locations and prices.  As for soldering I just use a really cheap iron with like no temperature control, I just turn it off when I feel it is getting far too hot.  I have a standard roll of lead free solder and it seems to do the job fine. As for sponges, its probably good to have one or some wire cleaner to clean the tip of the iron after use. Tbh I don't even have one, I just remove excess solder from the iron with a little desolder pump.  For storage you could buy some of those parts bins or component drawers, I myself have everything separated into used mint tins :)"
Gameboy,3czg88,Mowen55,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:50:41 2015 UTC,"Start with what you have on hand and can find around. Avoid eBay when you can but snag those deals when they come up. I love my ifixit screwdriver kit, the only thing it lacks is the security bit for GB games. Grab a small tackle box from big5 (or wherever) for parts. I don't remember my soldering iron model but if you can spend $35 on something with changeable tips I'd recommend it. I thought I was bad at soldering until I got the one I currently have (they all work though) get a cheap brillo pad and sponge. Liquid tape is great too and makes everything look very professional.  Soldering is tough at first but becomes second nature. You have to touch it to both components long enough to get a good bond with the solder but not too long that you fry a component. All I can say is practice and watch soldering videos.   I'm curious about anything I haven't listed as I'm still learning myself. LOCA and UV are something I'd like to get into for GBC mods."
Gameboy,3czg88,howdoinintendo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:48:58 2015 UTC,"If you want to mod just for fun you can start with the DMG and work your way up in the future, but if you want a ""definitive"" modded Gameboy console, invest your time and money in an Original GBA. Great ergonomics and plays the entire Gameboy line (GB, GBC, and GBA)"
Gameboy,3czg88,LJSway,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:40:41 2015 UTC,"For the soldering you'll be doing, you want a low wattage iron.  15 to 30 ought to do you.  Get one with a really pointy tip for soldering to test points and the sides of smd components.  Radioshack sells one that I've never had any trouble with.  Radioshack also sells a tiny little tin of tip cleaner/tinner.  Best investment I ever made, my tips last way longer.  Just wait for your tip to get hot and jam it in the compound.  For solder, the important thing is getting the right diameter.  Again, you're going to be soldering to test points and the sides of components, so get something nice and fine.  As for sponges, this brass sponge with holder seems to be out of stock, but it's what I recommend for wiping off your tip.  It's less fiddly than a sponge and you don't have to wait for your tip to heat up again after cleaning.  If they don't come back in stock soon, I guess you could buy just the sponge and put it in a tin can."
Gameboy,3czg88,DieKatzchen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, and rule one of soldering.  If you lose your grip and drop your iron, STEP BACK and DO NOT TRY TO CATCH IT.  Burn that into your mind.  Very important."
Gameboy,3czg88,DieKatzchen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:12:58 2015 UTC,Ah yes. I remember this one time I sneezed while soldering. It was not a good time.  Always solder while wearing shoes!
Gameboy,3czg88,Saloncinx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:48:19 2015 UTC,"Here's a list of everything you need to do soldering http://www.joshuanewell.com/electronics/getting-started-with-soldering-what-to-buy  For triwing screwdrivers if you want something decent that will last you, I really like moody tools brand screwdrivers.

Gameboy,3czxqy,Nintendofreak18,2,Sun Jul 12 08:36:15 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong as I've not really done a GBA backlight before, but my understanding is that all the backlit SP screens have the same number of pins but the GBA has either a 32 or 40 pin screen. If ur GBA has a 40 pin connector you would get a 40 pin adapter. If you have a 32 pin GBA then get a 32 pin adapter. The SP screen will fit in either adapter."

As the DS plays GBA games on its own backlit display, I would not bother getting the AGS101 unless you really want one.  And a flash card?

Gameboy,3ctq1h,Saloncinx,3,Fri Jul 10 19:14:06 2015 UTC,Also just realized who you are. You do some amazing work. /u/the_8bit_kingdom told me to look at your posts for painting guides. I love the inner surface painting you do.

Gameboy,3cu3ds,PapaMurf,2,Fri Jul 10 20:00:28 2015 UTC,I think some of your liquid is leaking from the LCD panel.  I think that white in the bottom you're seeing is actually the backlight panel.
Gameboy,3cu3ds,Saloncinx,2,Fri Jul 10 20:26:08 2015 UTC,Is there anything I can do to fix it? Or at this point can I only stop it from getting worse?

Gameboy,3ctr59,asdfqwer426,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:30:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all an expert at this, so take it with a grain of salt, but I recently fixed a DMG that had a few stubborn vertical lines that kept coming back. Applied a bit of heat over the entire ribbon, not just directly below the screen, that helped initially, but it came back when I assembled it. Wiggled parts of the ribbon a little bit, making the lines disappear and reappear, but a couple pieces of adhesive paper below the screen kept it tight and that did the trick. Maybe this helps."

Gameboy,3ctr59,elliottstanger,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"I've been working with it on, and doing that. i'll keep trying it though. I think the one with a quarter missing might be gone.   I might try soldering the screen that goes black onto one of the other boards, as that one seems more like the board is at fault instead of the LCD. that or try a capacitor swap first, as the way it goes black almost seems like it could be cap.   I still hope to fix the stubborn one with the 2 bad lines though."

Gameboy,3cozbx,gibsonlp223,2,Thu Jul 9 16:43:33 2015 UTC,"If possible, I'd recommend trying it on another gb, just to verify that is indeed the game pak. Next thing I'd try would be taking the cartridge apart and lightly scrub down the circuit board with a little isopropyl (rubbing alcohol) on both sides. Particularly the contact pins and small components. If the actual contact pins have thick residue or anything blocking, you can try to scrape it off with a small screwdriver or similar tool to try and improve the connection.  I've fixed several problem carts in such manner as described above."
Gameboy,3cozbx,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"I might have to give that a try. It's interesting because the game plays perfectly, when the colors change it doesn't freeze or anything. I wonder what would cause that to happen, I've never seen anything like it before."

The original parts are injection molded and have some features that aren't going to come out well via casting. for example, the screw holes, the bumpers, etc.      I wonder if you could polish a replacement glacier case to get it closer to clear?"
Gameboy,3cphgk,_imjosh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"No, the glacier shells have a little blue pigment throughout them. Besides, those arent for sp's. The bumpers could be removed from a repo shell and a drill bit could thread any screw holes than dont turn out right. As you say its not really practical, a lot of work would be needed even after making the mold and that in itself would be a lot of trial and error. It could certainly be done, but making more than one would be a gigantic pain the the arse."

Gameboy,3cku0y,n0fumar,2,Wed Jul 8 18:15:46 2015 UTC,"Hi guys.  First off I would like to thank the 8 bit kingdom for his help.  Without him, I would've bought the wrong screen.  Secondly, thanks to Handheld Legend for having all these items in stock.  Really stand out store and had lots of things I needed in stock (replacement screen, two frontlights, and a GBA screen).  I created this video to demonstrate roughly what it took to design and build a dimming front light mod for a Gameboy Color.  I essentially took a 47 ohm resistor and a 200 ohm trimpot and added them in series to the front light.  I don't actually think the front light will turn on without a resistor in series with it, in case you're having issues.  I run into a few issues along the way, one major one was the LOCA glue I received had this weird jelly like substance stuck in the top, and when squeezing it out, it mixed up with the regular glue and pretty much rendered that application useless.  Good luck trying to wipe extra glue off, you're better just putting the screen on and letting it spill out over the sides and wiping it off later.  A few tips I have:  Try your best to not use paper towels when cleaning things.  Always try and have some micro-fiber cloths handy and use those.  The paper towels tended to leave some dust and particles behind, and made a mess.  ESPECIALLY if you are cleaning off some of the extra LOCA glue that creeped out.  I also used a little mineral spirits on the micro-fiber cloth to clean a little better.  Take your time when wiping down the screen and front light once they have been stuck together.  Especially when wiping that extra glue away, as once or twice I accidentally smeared some across the screen.  Don't take off the screen cover which covers the side that has the dimples until after everything has dried and you are just ready to install.  Take that cover off, give it a gentle wipe if there is any dust, and install it.  I can't tell you how many times I wiped it down, and had dust or something get stuck between the dimples.  Had to stick it under a microscope and use a plastic tool to scrape some out.  Please for all that is holy, cut holes at the bottom of the screen housing for the wires to go through.  It will save space, time, frustration, and snacks.  On a similar note, take your time.  Do not force things to fit.  I didn't do this, but I could easily see someone snapping something or ripping a cable/wire if they are impatient.  I saw a tip in a video that helped me get the LCD screen out; if you notice in my video, I carefully torque and twist the casing left and right to help break the seal, and then I just peel it up and out.  If you decide to put the trimpot in the same place I do, cover the back in either hot glue or tape.  This is because it butts up right against some odd circuit piece on the back.  Not only that, but you may have to adjust how tight you screw the bottom two screws in, since if you tighten them all the way, it pushes on this piece and then the battery compartment cover doesn't close 100%.  Test your setup outside of the Gameboy if you can (the screen and resistors).  This will help you decide if you want to go brighter, or less bright.  That's pretty much all I have!  If you've read this far, I really thank you and hope you enjoyed the video.  You don't have to watch it all the way through, but I'd at LEAST recommend watching the first 4 minutes and the last ~3 minutes.  This shows how I set up the electronics, comparison pictures of with and without LOCA glue, and even a short blooper reel.  Thanks again /r/gameboy.  Feel free to share the video with whoever you think would benefit and you can add it to any guides you may have, or blog site.  Just give credit where its due :)"

Well sometimes when you install the backlight (meant for dmg) into a pocket, you may notice one or more dark or light blotches which look like wet spots or pressure points, mostly due to the backlight's thickness.

Gameboy,3ckwq6,Dat1Person,3,Wed Jul 8 18:33:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't buy a sealed game unless I intended to open it. Why? How else do you verify you're getting what you expect? With so many fakes floating out there, especially with anything video game related, I wouldn't take that chance.  If you just want a box to display, step around the issue and get a printed reproduction box. At least there you know up front what you're getting. Chances are, an unsealed box in good shape is going to be a reproduction anyway, particularly in the current market environment. Sealed too, the machines to do those seals are expensive but not unobtainable (or un-borrowable) for someone really motivated to scam.  Full disclosure: I'd never take that chance again. I've been burned with ""sealed"" games that had obviously used manuals and scuffed up carts and while ultimately I did get my money back, it was a huge hassle."

Sent two emails, 8 days after ordering and 12 days after ordering, still nothing. 14 days later (yesterday) I opened up a PayPal dispute and he canceled the order in about 15 minutes. I think it's absolute shit that he doesn't honor the fact that I used express shipping. He closed his shop a few weeks back to catch up on his orders, and he's still two weeks behind.   HandHeld Legend is going to start making DMG buttons, and since that's all I really dabble with (along with frontlighting GBC's, which they just started selling) I probably won't be buying from KB again. I'm beyond disappointed.   I don't want to flame his store or his brand, but I can't say I've had good experiences with him.

Gameboy,3c7gqt,dividebyzeroZA,9,Sun Jul 5 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"It looks amazing on the Super Gameboy (albeit it runs at a slightly different framerate iirc) as a result.  60fps used to be an (un?)spoken industry goal at some point, before fidelity overtook fluidity in importance."
Gameboy,3c7gqt,zeress1,10,Sun Jul 5 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"60FPS used to be the refresh rate. The next frame's going out at the next tick of the vertical sync whether you're ready or not. You had to make sure your game logic took less than one frame or else you'd have hardcore lag.  The Super Game Boy used a clock input from the SNES that was considered ""close enough"" rather than including the clock generator from the Game Boy in order to reduce costs. The result is that the games run 2.4% faster (1024/1000x), which is mostly noticeable in the higher pitched music.  Interestingly the SuperGB 2, which is unfortunately hard to find, does include the original clock generator and so doesn't have this quirk. (Perhaps because it also had a link cable port and they feared the timing difference would mess up some games?)"
Gameboy,3c7gqt,RenaKunisaki,5,Mon Jul 6 01:06:50 2015 UTC,Perhaps because it also had a link cable port and they feared the timing difference would mess up some games?   I'd say that's a fairly safe assumption. I know speedrunners disallow the use of the SGB1 for the speed increase and I wouldn't be surprised if it would mess up synchronization badly between 2 (or more) non-turn based games.
Gameboy,3c7gqt,zeress1,2,Mon Jul 6 03:08:41 2015 UTC,"With speedruns it's more because the game is actually running faster, so would give a bit of an advantage. (And I guess nobody can be arsed to scale the resulting time appropriately.) But I bet there are also a lot of games that would freak right out if one side is running faster than the other during linked play."
Gameboy,3c7gqt,RenaKunisaki,2,Tue Jul 7 04:15:40 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely the whole issue though. I can think of at least one case where the game running a different speed (in this case slower) allows for a skip that isn't normally possible.  PAL Super Metroid runs at 50Hz due to how TVs were at the time, resulting in the game actually running slower than NTSC variants of 60Hz. It allowed a skip that was exclusively possible in the PAL versions as a result of this."
Gameboy,3c7gqt,zeress1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:18:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I can't imagine how running faster would make any skips easier, though.  Some SNES PAL games (such as Super Mario World) actually changed the physics to make up for the lower frame rate. For example Mario runs faster and jumps higher in PAL SMW, which makes some tricks possible that aren't in other versions. Maybe it's the same for Super Metroid?"

Gameboy,3c8ydl,TheGoodly,3,Wed Jul 8 04:34:54 2015 UTC,"Sticking to the original one entirely (non color/hybrid) I'd go with Final Fantasy Legend 3.  The first two in the series are a little rough around the edges and they also have any armor/weapon you use break after X uses which sucks as you have to waste inventory on extras for dungeons and traveling.  The third one feels more like an early SNES era rpg, good grounding to it, nice story, quite large and no breakables.  With the GBC though, if you were to exclude the obvious Dragon Warrior 1+2 or DW3 carts which are GBC remixes of the Super Famicom upgrades I'd probably go with Revelations the Demon Slayer (it's a SMT world spinoff rpg) or Dragon Warrior Monsters.  If you figure in action rpgs into this group the old GB I'd put Final Fantasy Adventure (Seiken Densetsu 1 prequel to SOM on SNES) as #1.  With the GBC, tough call, either the Legend of Zelda DX game or maybe even Crystalis even if it's not as nice as the NES version it's solid."

Red/Blue/Yellow are awesome games as well, it's just that the second gen ones take that as a base and add a bunch more cool shit to it.  The games are excellent at ""self-adjusting"" to your own level - you can sprint through the game in 20-30 hours if you know what you're doing, or take 200+ hours if you want to catch every pokemon or train a competitive team.   My general pacing for all the GB/GBC games is pretty consistent in that I usually beat the elite four at around the 80 hr mark - this includes lots of time for backtracking and training up useless rattata's etc while I eat cereal. The gen II games have a bit more content and I usually get to around the 110 hr mark before the gameplay starts to feel a little thin.

That means you can't give it more than around 3.3V without problems, Li-Ion is 2.7-4.2V. You'd need to use a buck regulator set to around 3V.  The GBC runs on 5V, so it can handle the 4.2V from a fully charged Li-Ion.  I've looked into a way to use the GBC's EXT port for charging, but it would require a little extra circuitry."

Gameboy,3c3c35,Phants,2,Sat Jul 4 21:08:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you ! I didn't take any picture while building it because I was in rush and working in secret (it was a gift for my girl) so after every working session I put it directly in a secret spot to keep it out of anybody's view :p The only picture I took was the system just before applying last coats of paint after the ears broke (in an attempt to make a mould in silicone, which turned really bad), so nothing interesting here unfortunately :/ I might build another one which I might picture or film during the build, and eventually making a mould out of it. Nothing sure yet ! Thank you again !"

Gameboy,3c4c4b,beach_boy98,3,Sat Jul 4 17:29:41 2015 UTC,"If you just want to play games, get an SP. Perferably one of the backlit ones. Backlit ones cost around 60 though, but you can play every gameboy game from the original no-color games, to the Gameboy advance games. If you just want to play and don't care about brightness, get a regular SP or an original GBA."
Gameboy,3c4c4b,Boe6Eod7Nty,2,Sat Jul 4 17:49:20 2015 UTC,Thanks is Ebay a good place to buy or should i be looking else where?
Gameboy,3c4c4b,Boe6Eod7Nty,2,Sat Jul 4 17:51:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, just make sure you get a fully working one is good condition. If the description says something that contradicts what you receive, you can get a refund, but it could be hard to handle. Look for good Ebay feedback scores. Just use your brain when buying ;)"
Gameboy,3c4c4b,Saloncinx,2,Sat Jul 4 17:53:45 2015 UTC,I would agree with this. A backlit SP will be your best bet if you only have the money for one handheld. It will play all of the other GameBoy games and the GBA games :)
Gameboy,3c4c4b,NavNavsGotARocket,3,Sat Jul 4 17:52:24 2015 UTC,Thats great man. I wish I could get my cousins into the retro scene but I mean they are all way to into Call of Duty and such to ever like the older games. A lot of people recommend getting an SP if you are into playing the games. While I agree I just wanted to say if you are the type that likes to tinker with things or mod your stuff  to personalize them why not go one step further and make youself a front light gbc or a back lit gba. The backlit gba is a bit more expensive but totally worth it if you want a personal and unique retro gaming console.

Gameboy,3c4c4b,dividebyzeroZA,2,Sun Jul 5 02:04:32 2015 UTC,"It depends what you're after in a way.  I still have 2 original GameBoys with the link cable for 2 player Tetris battles (back when I was your age we could play certain games multiplayer but it had to be physically linked using a special cable).  If you want to experience where it all began I'd recommend an original GameBoy (but be aware it's tricky to play without lighting as the screen itself isn't backlit).   There are some classic games for the system and some of my favourites include:   Tetris (mandatory!) Super Mario Land (1 and 2) Metroid II Zelda: Link's Awakening Kirby's Dreamland Pokemon (Blue or Red) Castlevania II Gargoyle's Quest Kwirk (cute little puzzle game) Revenge of the Gator (pinball)   Another option is to get a GameBoy Color which came out quite a bit later that allowed you to play original GameBoy games as well as those made specifically for GameBoy Color.  Color games however did not work on the original GameBoy.  If you're keen to delve into a wider catalogue and include the GameBoy Advance games you should opt for a GameBoy Advance SP.  It plays older games as well as the GBA titles.  I just have an emotional attachment to the original GameBoy design since it was what I had as a kid.  I bought it on eBay - just read the description to make sure the screen doesn't have any ""dead"" pixels or lines which can be an issue on older models.  Dead meaning the entire row doesn't show the graphics.  Please feel free to reply to this with any questions you may have and I'll happily respond where possible.

Gameboy,3c12s8,AnthonyJBentley,5,Fri Jul 3 22:01:35 2015 UTC,Homebrew is a specialized skill and it takes a lot of talent to squeeze every last bit out of the gameboy and gameboy colors cpu. Not everyone has the tools to build new cartridges and the tools to program cartridges. You can find a fare bit of gameboy homebrew online but most are just tech demos or music creation tools like LSDJ. I tend to find that homebrew creators tend to focus more on the gba and ds due to their greater cpu specs. You still find new homebrew for the GB and GBC just not as often these days and several of the once thriving link sites with technical documentation are riddled with dead links.
Gameboy,3c12s8,kc0nlh,2,Fri Jul 3 21:27:10 2015 UTC,The only homebrew games relased on a cartridge I know of are http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/03/furrtek_software_engineering_revives_the_game_boy_scene_with_medieval_puzzler_airaki  and  http://www.retrocollect.com/News/brand-new-game-boy-homebrew-super-connard-released.html  oops forgot about Chunkout for the GBC. https://youtu.be/V1FnJ15gR2g?t=22s

Gameboy,3bwoc8,Saloncinx,3,Thu Jul 2 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"I think it does look quite cool. But at $110, its just too steep for me. Especially since it looks like it hasn't been top coated and so the paint looks kinda beat up. But yeah it would look dope with a blue or maybe orange backlight!"

I can't find the thread, but one of the consistent contributors called that person out and they deleted everything.   In any case, a legit pre-modded GBA is getting to be a costly purchase. The parts alone have broken $100 and there's no talk of new parts being manufactured. Unless you go with a reputable modder, you don't get much of a quality guarantee."

Thus if the game looks brand new, you're probably safe. If it looks authentic otherwise (i.e. a good fake), you might also be fine. If it looks like a crappy fake (e.g. no Nintendo logo on the PCB) I would not play it, as you might run into trouble.  EDIT: P.S. If you don't mind playing non-original games, you might want to look into other ways of doing that, like a flash cart, which might be more robust than trusting fakes."

Gameboy,3bjdp7,TheComicArtist_,5,Mon Jun 29 18:31:04 2015 UTC,"(Ripped from my sub's FAQ)  --> RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEWCOMERS TO THE HOBBY: 1.) Become very familiar with the GB models(s) you are interested in modding. Disassembly, reassembly and familiarity with all of the components within them is key. Start simple with disassembly, internal cleaning and reassembly. Once you're familiar and comfortable with all of that, move on to more complicated tasks and build on that experience.  2.) Look for some good bargains on places like Craigslist or Ebay on ""broken"" units. Sometimes you can spot some very good deals and most of the time, they may just need cleaning and/or some simple replacement parts, like a speaker or silicone button pads. Also, you can really use the extra parts to fix other units with from systems which are damaged beyond repair. Broken system lots are great for getting started if you can find them for decent prices. Persistence and a keen eye is key!  3.) Get good practice doing the mods which interest you the most. Once you become adept at each mod, you'll find that you may come up with better and more efficient methods and will be ready very soon to learn more mods to add to your repertoire.  4.) Keep a clean and organized work area. Having all your necessary parts and tools in an easily accessible area will save you time and stress."
Gameboy,3bjdp7,the_8bit_kingdom,2,Mon Jun 29 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"Great tips. Definitely start with repairing game boys, then move on to modding. It will help get you into the habit/mindset of looking at problems and deciding how to fix them. Sure, do research and ask questions on /r/gameboy, but you'll soon be able to just figure out your own solutions to your specific situations.  I started with DMG's, since they're generally cheap and plentiful. For a while I only did mods that other people had done, carefully following step-by-step guides, and then I started getting my own ideas for mods that I wanted to try. I think that's a great way to learn. Once you're doing your own ideas, it's a cool feeling to know that there's no step-by-step guide for what you're doing, and maybe you could write one!  Now I'm modding all kinds of crazy crap, and I'm going to attempt making an N64 portable, wiring an N64 motherboard into a GBA carrying case like this one, wiring in a screen, speakers, batteries, controller. etc. and it all started with DMGs..."

I know what the shipping fees are likely to be.  I've thought of installing a lighting kit myself - I can solder ok and I've done a few basic refurbs so I know how to put them back together - but for that price I think I'd rather let an expert do it for me.

Gameboy,3bgqyb,Kemakill,2,Mon Jun 29 03:12:42 2015 UTC,Thanks I try.
Gameboy,3bgqyb,bargainbinz,3,Mon Jun 29 03:24:14 2015 UTC,This was a very nice read. I agree that the best portable games are those that support short play sessions.
Gameboy,3bgqyb,bargainbinz,2,Mon Jun 29 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yeah it was a little confusing. My last review on here was for Final Fantasy Legend, which came out in 1989. Even that game allowed you to save anywhere the same way Pokémon does."
Gameboy,3bgqyb,bargainbinz,2,Mon Jun 29 18:34:06 2015 UTC,I loved FF Legend as a kid. A great game on the long car rides when my family traveled from California to Utah. I'll have to look your review up. I never played any of the other FF Legends but just happened to pick up a copy of FFL2 on a lot auction so I am looking forward to it.
Gameboy,3bgqyb,slade2501,2,Mon Jun 29 21:48:50 2015 UTC,Here you go
Gameboy,3bgqyb,slade2501,3,Tue Jun 30 01:47:09 2015 UTC,Thanks. That is about what I remember of the game. I remember getting stuck in a room of orbs and I had trouble finding the correct one. This is way before the internet so there was no where to turn and I was extremely frustrated about getting through. I eventually found the solution and it was a very rewarding experience.
Gameboy,3bgqyb,bargainbinz,3,Tue Jun 30 14:43:26 2015 UTC,I was a beta tester for this back in college.

Gameboy,3bgqyb,rainstorm88,2,Thu Jul 2 13:20:03 2015 UTC,Should have told them about the save points lol.  That's pretty cool though seriously. I wonder if companies still do stuff like that now.
Gameboy,3bgqyb,DeadMachineStds,2,Fri Jul 3 02:45:12 2015 UTC,"So now that MN is finally over with, I've started playing through Ultima: Runes of Virtue.

I just wrapped that one up today. I'm not counting it as an RPG though."
Gameboy,3bgqyb,ZucriyAmsuna,2,Mon Jun 29 02:12:40 2015 UTC,"FF Legend II, I am about to get into that game and would like to see your insights."
Gameboy,3bgqyb,ZucriyAmsuna,2,Mon Jun 29 16:21:42 2015 UTC,Most definitely. I've been itching to see the improvements over the first one anyway.

Gameboy,3bh9kn,joeyman00,6,Mon Jun 29 05:17:33 2015 UTC,The 101 is worth it  Ask your friends/relatives to see if they have at least one good game you can borrow. Super Mario Advance is probably the cheapest good game I can think of
Gameboy,3bh9kn,swrrga,3,Mon Jun 29 09:39:18 2015 UTC,"Get advance 2. I like what they did with super mario world, updated graphics and some new sounds. It's a little jarring at first, but I've gotten to like it."
Gameboy,3bh9kn,boredcanadian,5,Mon Jun 29 15:15:59 2015 UTC,"Well, considering the games have been out between 1989 and 2004, and that they're not going anywhere, AND that you can emulate and have them all for the price of 1 or 2 of the better ones, I'd say go for the gold and get the best gba-sp, the 101 baby!

Gameboy,3bgm6f,industry-standard,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:30:36 2015 UTC,Seconding that. GBA games on the DS lite are beautiful.
Gameboy,3bgm6f,iliekgaemz,0,Mon Jun 29 01:53:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I realize that as an option but as stupid as it sounds I like the one screen simple design of the Gameboys."

Gameboy,3bgm6f,boredcanadian,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:20:15 2015 UTC,I'd try eBay first.

Gameboy,3bg9e9,kc0nlh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:47:35 2015 UTC,I like he 001 better as you can turn the light off when not needed to extend battery life
Gameboy,3bg9e9,onefish2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:52:29 2015 UTC,There is no comparison between the two. Once you see a 101 you will not even want to turn on a 101 or anything else for that matter.
Gameboy,3be2i6,ZadocPaet,3,Sun Jun 28 10:08:56 2015 UTC,I just got that exact gbc on eBay for $26 cause it has a dead speaker and missing battery cover. It's a beauty and I'm going to mod the shit out of it and make it my new baby. :-)

Gameboy,3bda3f,TimmyB_,3,Sun Jun 28 04:29:27 2015 UTC,I like this color scheme. Good job.    I had a nDS that needed a new case. So I installed new black housing to replace the old scratched pink housing. However the hinge ended up breaking. So I used pieces of the pink case. Perhaps not as nice as your scheme but I likes. http://imgur.com/8B0rZE2 http://imgur.com/nhnPHZG
Gameboy,3bda3f,Northwait,2,Sun Jun 28 21:54:23 2015 UTC,Is there an LED attached to it or is it just light leaking from the backlight?
Gameboy,3bda3f,Kordan9090,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:56:13 2015 UTC,There's an LED pointed into the switch on the top. I'll post a DIY next time I do one. I bought a few loose parts from Kitsch in my most recent order so I might go back and do a few more of these in my other systems.

Gameboy,3bc4pn,enovah,2,Sun Jun 28 21:01:34 2015 UTC,I tried using the LOCA that HHL sold but it did not work very well for me. I cured it outside for over an hour and it created pretty horrible light columns. Yours look so much better though! What type of LOCA did you use and how did you cure it?
Gameboy,3bc4pn,a_can_of_solo,3,Mon Jun 29 01:51:17 2015 UTC,"Hello there! I use OSAKA loca, do not use anything else. When I first started a long time ago, for my first run through I used generic LOCA from eBay and it made bubbles, the screen wasn't very visible because the adhesive gave a dark blue hue. Now I've always used OSAKA since I bought it,  it 10x clearer and it doesn't create as many bubbles. Remember practice makes perfect! I don't get bubbles anymore, only now and then a front light might come defective with dust embedded which can't be removed. For curing,  I have made my own UV station, mine bonds in 30-60 seconds. I rather have my front lit screens concentrated under my UV lamp then outside in the sun where UV rays are pointing many different directions."
Gameboy,3bc4pn,enovah,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:13:19 2015 UTC,Thanks! The concensus really seems to be using Osaka LOCA and getting  UV light.

Gameboy,3bc4pn,McFlem,2,Mon Jun 29 03:17:18 2015 UTC,Same predicament here. I did a corrected orientation ags 001 mod and if i decide to do a frontlight LOCA mod with another gbc then I'll probably buy some Osaka LOCA.

Gameboy,3bbzxy,grem75,2,Sun Jun 28 09:05:53 2015 UTC,"The GBA emulator is VBA-M, which has the Memory Viewer showing the contents of the RAM on the emulated system. Bless is just a general hex editor showing the original NES version.   I couldn't find it within the .gba ROM, I could only see in RAM when it was running. Even if you could find where and how the ROM is stored, there is still no way to write to the ROM of an original GBA cartridge.  If you did have the ability to write a ROM to a cartridge (EEPROM cart/Flash cart), you wouldn't use their emulator. They had to hack up the original ROMs for compatibility. That made them incompatible with a good NES emulator, I could get them to run, but they were not playable. PocketNES is a far superior emulator, it even gives you save states."

Gameboy,3b9385,tresanus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:16:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   Ah, to maintain cleanliness, I keep my workroom door always closed, keep a plastic tarp over my work table, lightly blow off the surface of my work table with compressed air before I begin, and do my modding work in minimal, thin clothing.  Aside from that, during the local application, I simply move quickly and concisely to ensure minimal contamination.   Sounds like a lot, but it's become a way of life. Like getting up to pee in the morning. :-)"

Gameboy,3b5p5s,Northwait,3,Fri Jun 26 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"Of course, these pictures won't stop a seller from putting pictures of an original system and shipping one that has an aftermarket housing, but at least you've got a fighting chance to tell them apart especially if you haven't touched an original so you don't know how different it feels."
Gameboy,3b5p5s,n0fumar,3,Fri Jun 26 04:33:49 2015 UTC,Is this how they stop being sued by Nintendo for infringement? Making a few miniscule changes?
Gameboy,3b5p5s,NotTheNews,3,Fri Jun 26 04:49:15 2015 UTC,No. They're just poorly made and won't get sued because they're made in China.
Gameboy,3b5p5s,_Zubatman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:50:26 2015 UTC,"Factories and production lines get started and shut down constantly in China, if they get sued they just disappear and start up a week later with a different base of operations."
Gameboy,3b5p5s,Markbro89,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:36:55 2015 UTC,"We use ""aftermarket"" (well, I use the word anyway) as kind of a euphemism. It's definitely the same kinds of operations that make bootlegs and counterfeits. The goal is not really to reproduce things, it's to get close enough to generate sales.   It's also kind of an unfair comparison because the GBA SP has a much more complicated housing design with much more demanding molding technology compared to every other GB.   That said, I love having the option available to me to recondition these things, especially since there are so many out there that were outright trashed by their owners. It's when people are selling as new items that are clearly refurbs that I start getting upset, and people getting taken that just want to get into the hobby."
Gameboy,3b5p5s,namesareforfriends69,2,Fri Jun 26 16:32:08 2015 UTC,"I bought one of those prebuilt AGS 101s from Ebay last year and immediately returned it.

Gameboy,3b5p5s,the_8bit_kingdom,2,Fri Jun 26 12:11:25 2015 UTC,"In no way am I defending these aftermarket shells, but when your original shell snaps in half, the aftermarket shells come in handy."

Adhesive for those."
Gameboy,3b5p5s,syrupdash,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:53:08 2015 UTC,I've tried two from eBay and they're not good. I'd sooner have a scratched up well made shell than a shiny new piece of crap.

They do breathe a new life but I never use them for daily use. The shell doesn't feel right in my hand. Also, don't bother using the replacement buttons that comes with the shell. I just used the original ones on the GBA SP and swapped them over instead."

Gameboy,3b4wzm,WizardPineapple,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:37:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I would agree. I LOVE the clickey buttons of the SP's.  Having GBA shoulder buttons that would actually feel responsive would be cool!

Gameboy,3b53qj,Northwait,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:00:43 2015 UTC,"In answer to your second question: yes, palettes and colors in the game were purposefully over-saturated to compensate for the screen's [comparatively weak] color intensity. In the GBA also. I know at least one game (Final Fantasy Tactics Advance) had an option to tone it back a little for display with a TV.   It's not terribly distracting, but I did notice a little weirdness playing one of the Warioland games that clearly depended on the white-is-not-white color of the GBC screen to add a nice shade to Wario's yellow suit that looks really odd on an AGS-101.  For my money, though, I honestly like playing GBC games more on original GBC instead of a GBA. I just think the picture looks better, like it's sharper. IMO monochrome games on original hardware look best on a MGB."
Gameboy,3b3km6,bargainbinz,3,Thu Jun 25 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"Pokemon Ruby perhaps?  I don't know, even then it seems overpriced. Maybe the unit is a AGS-101?"

Gameboy,3b4he1,bargainbinz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"ebay for bundles of games, shopgoodwill.com for really random clumps of games/systems/accessories.

Gameboy,3b4he1,alanbbent,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:45:48 2015 UTC,on shopgoodwill make sure you check the shipping on every single item that you like because it ranges from $5 - $20 on each item. Also understand that on shopgoodwill unless specified the items may have not been tested. I received a lot with a GBA copy of Magical Quest w/ Mickey and Minnie and the game didn't work. I opened the cart and found what looked like grape jelly on the inside of the cart. Q-tips and alcohol solved the issue but just remember that everything out of shopgoodwill is sold AS-IS just like the normal thrift stores. eBayers will usually test the item before they sell it and notify you of any issues and if there are no issues mentioned in the ad you are protected by a guarantee from eBay itself.
Gameboy,3b4he1,bargainbinz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:05:57 2015 UTC,Thank you everyone. I'll look into those websites.

Gameboy,3azf1b,SteXD,2,Wed Jun 24 18:59:42 2015 UTC,I bet it's possible to design and manufacture replacement screens but it's just not worth it. It would cost thousands to start up the project and I don't think the demand would be high enough to make it cost-effective.
Gameboy,3azf1b,razor546PL,2,Wed Jun 24 19:42:04 2015 UTC,At least 30k$ is my best guess

Gameboy,3b04br,nrq,5,Thu Jun 25 07:41:19 2015 UTC,Minimum of 50 pieces. Let's say they 30 bucks a piece it's still 1500 dollars. Quite a lot to put forward. I'm sure if someone put together kickstarter then it would be possible to get it cheap enough.  I would love to buy one as long as it would go for less than £20.

Not 50 people that say ""ah yeah sure I'd love to do that!"", but people who actually front the money and then have to wait a few weeks to fit the product.   Definitely not impossible, but it would take a lot of effort to get going. I would definitely be willing to help."

Gameboy,3b04br,WizardPineapple,3,Thu Jun 25 06:24:21 2015 UTC,"Do crowdfunding sites do things like print out shipping labels and stuff like that? If we did a Kickstarter everyone would have to put up the money when the crowdfunding finishes, then whoever started it would take the money to the manufacturer to get them made, and ship them out through the site portal. You could do different tiers of how many screens you want, charge the wholesale price, plus 6-8 bucks for shipping and to offset Kickstarter's cut of the funding. USPS gives away free Priority Mail boxes and envelopes. Think how many 101 screens you can shove into a $5.25 small flat rate box...  I think I could do it, I don't mind not making a profit, I just don't want to lose any money personally. I live in North Carolina, which is where Kitsch-Bent is located.

Gameboy,3axbji,switchie15,2,Wed Jun 24 19:29:23 2015 UTC,6 is quite a bit thicker then 7. It's alot easier to work with because you can apply the correct amount with out it flowing out too quickly. Also less prone to bubbles. It works great!

Gameboy,3atvgq,explodingbaconman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:33:10 2015 UTC,"I play on the SP probably more than any other iteration of the GB line, and to help alleviate some of the hand hurt I bought some grips off of eBay. Madcatz grips I think they were called. They're basically silicone rubber, but they help to keep your hands at an angle and further away from the gb housing, so it hurts slightly less.  Of course, it doesn't look nearly as pretty any more but it's still the best way to play the SP. Although, a backlit modded standard GBA would probably be a better way to go (cart slot on the bottom for GB games, is a pain on the SP), but I don't think the grips cost more than a few quid, so it's a good first step."

Gameboy,3au7za,baby_shoo-shoo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:42:18 2015 UTC,"That's a different kind of flickering, I have the correct solder points, the screen looks fine upon first glance, but when playing games you get a very subtle strobe effect which gets really annoying."
Gameboy,3au7za,Saloncinx,2,Thu Jun 25 12:56:19 2015 UTC,Can you post a vid? or send it to handheldlegend@gmail.com?  I'm playing my modded GBC right now and don't see this happening. Also are you using a GB game or a GBC game?
Gameboy,3au7za,the_8bit_kingdom,2,Thu Jun 25 13:31:24 2015 UTC,"I'm currently using pokemon red, which is a GB game, I also saw it on Pokemon Silver although it wasn't as noticeable due to the color, and I believe I saw it when I was playing Oracle of ages which is GBC, but I'll have to double check. I will make a video when I get home from work, it might be hard to get it on camera though, because like I said, it's very subtle although noticeable enough to be annoying."
Gameboy,3ar81s,jgoettig,3,Mon Jun 22 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"From this thread:   -After i was done, the screen worked great but it was TOO bright and colors were all washed out. First thing I tried was the potentiometer that I read about on the GBA motherboard. I stuck a small flathead screwdriver through the back and turned until it got a little bit dimmer. It helped, but it was still washed out. Then I stumbled upon this forum post http://forums.modretro.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=13374 which explains that you MIGHT need to solder a wire to REVC to GND (ground) on the GBA motherboard. THIS WORKED!!! Screen was no longer washed out and was perfect!! I suspect it may depend on who/where you get your ribbon cable converter from if you have to do something like this."
Gameboy,3ar81s,nrq,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:32:54 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I was really hoping there was something like this

Gameboy,3ar81s,enovah,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:20:13 2015 UTC,"It worked! Granted it was an additional solder, not just REVC to GND, that actually solved it. I'll post a direct link to what I found when I can later."

Gameboy,3aqg59,PatchworkSoul,3,Mon Jun 22 17:53:48 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good deal to me. Most used DMGs I've seen in retro game stores sell for $40-50. Repairing it to get rid of the vertical lines isn't too difficult. So yeah, I'd say $35 for all of that isn't bad."
Gameboy,3aqg59,bargainbinz,3,Mon Jun 22 18:34:48 2015 UTC,I think some of the best deals can be found via lot's like these. I have found in my area DMG's will go for $20. The batman game is likely $9.95 retail here and the combination of Tetris and Dr. Mario would probably push $6-7. So that gets you to a little over $35 and everything else is just gravy. :)
Gameboy,3aqg59,VikingFirebeard,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:57:04 2015 UTC,Nice! Got these off a co-worker actually. I made him the 35$ offer. He knows nothing about the market value of these but at the same time i didn't want to low ball him.

It's what I did when I blew one by accidentally putting the battery on the points wrong for testing and haven't had any problem since. You just need to make sure whatever made the fuse blow doesn't happen again, or your system will be fried."

Gameboy,3aonsu,alanbbent,3,Mon Jun 22 17:22:50 2015 UTC,"You can buy replacement fuses from ebay. Sure, you can just bridge the gap, but it's risky if you're still tinkering. If you're done tinkering and you just want to play, then you're probably ok. It's not a particularly expensive machine to replace if something goes awry. And yes, those fuses are extremely tiny!"
Gameboy,3aonsu,asdfqwer426,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:43:35 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for the reply! I think I might just bridge it for now. I have a second DSL mainboard hanging around with a broken power switch. So if I really mess up I'll have a backup at least.  Thanks again!
Gameboy,3aonsu,delti90,2,Mon Jun 22 17:22:06 2015 UTC,"what the other guys said, just bridge it. BUT! fun fact, if the fuse ruptured and got liquid around it that then dried, CLEAN IT OFF FIRST. it is conductive and can stop the console from running. had this issue once. fuse blew, i bridged it and it just would not run. finally cleaned it better around the bridge and it still works fine."
Gameboy,3ao4j0,smes3817,3,Mon Jun 22 02:52:22 2015 UTC,"It does a little, but the GBP screens are already sharp enough that a lot of people don't bother with the bivert chip. It's possible to find room in the case for the chip, but it's not near as easy as a DMG, with loads of empty space inside."
Gameboy,3ao4j0,alanbbent,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, actually its not that noticeable of an upgrade as a dmg with bivert chip.  Not even sure why anyone would bother with biverting a pocket. It's already crisp and clear. Especially with a white hhl backlight."

Gameboy,3ak2yp,xRead,3,Sat Jun 20 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, The screens are hard to come by nowadays. I had to order a broken AGS-101 to get a backlit screen for my GBA. If you want to play it safe, get a working AGS-101, but that'll cost you more. Also note that you need an adapter for the screen to work, either 40 pin, or 32 pin. It depends on your GBA's model.  As for the buttons, The SP has a very distinct click when you press them, but the Advance (and all older gameboys as well, they have the same button type) has a more soft, 'shquishy' feel, but you can still tell when it's pressed. It's mainly a preference thing, personally I like both and couldn't care less, but some people are very choosy. I have had some trouble with the start and select buttons on the advance, but it's not major in my opinion."
Gameboy,3ak2yp,Boe6Eod7Nty,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:57:57 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on how much you want to spend. I have a backlit GBA like you described, but screens have become harder to come by. You'll have to use a GBA SP's screen, and that could be as much as $50. There is no good solution to the button mushiness.   You might just be better off getting an SP"
Gameboy,3ak2yp,WizardPineapple,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:19:10 2015 UTC,I could probably get ahold of a used AGA-101 pretty inexpensively and use its screen in the GBA. SPs go for dirt cheap here compared to other countries.
Gameboy,3ak2yp,enovah,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:47:21 2015 UTC,"You would think that, but to get an AGS-101 will run you about 25 on a good day. AGS-001 are the ones that are cheap. Plus you have to find and buy an adapter. Sooooo, I guess if you got the time, cash and  skill. If you are just looking to play so old games, just buy a SP. They are more comfortable to play in bed."

I've been really wanting and meaning to do an in-depth yet simplified tutorial on this method to make it more newcomer friendly. I know the ""Mylk""-man has a thorough one already, but I feel it's a bit too daunting for most.

They take care of my gbc shells, glass lenses and gba ribbon adapter cable needs. Other stuff like battery covers are easily covered by U.S. sellers there too for a decent price. Other small stuff like back labels and repair stickers I just make myself. Spare oem parts are obtained from junkers off eBay and custom buttons from kitsch-bent.

VERY slow ship time. upwards of 15 days AFTER you purchase and pay, so it usually takes 20-25 days to get your stuff even though he's US based.  Hand Held Legend is awesome for GBC Frontlight kits, some some other miscellaneous parts for DMG's and Pockets. They also have the backlight kits for DMG and Pocket.

Sounds like they dropped it.  Unless you can get it for less then $10 out the door i'd pass.  EDIT: didn't notice you were across the pond. $10 is like £6.50? I would not pay more then that :)  EDIT EDIT: Definitely a reproduction shell. Looks how weird the ""GameBoy Color"" logo looks on the screen lens.

Hmmm, I suppose the only options that come to my mind is painting/spray-painting a cheap grey cartridge (maybe buy some kind of sport/wrestling game with one). But then transferring the sticker could be an issue...  Or you could spray paint the one you have and cover the sticker decal, whilst also making sure to remove the ROM cartridge.   Or conversely buy Pokémon Green, and then switch the insides with For the Frog the Bell Tolls insides. But then the big problem is the sticker...so maybe just stick with Red, might be too much of a hassle!   Either way, the colour doesn't really matter when its in the Game Boy does it? ;D."

Gameboy,3ag7sm,distinctlydoyle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:56:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I've heard that Mother 1 is a bit rough around the edges (being a famicon game and all) so I'm going to start with Mother 2/Earthbound and then do 3, then come back to 1 if it's really for me. I just don't want 1 to turn me off to the series if it's really not very polished. That said, I played about 2 minutes of 1 to make sure it worked and I already fought a lamp and there's a ghost in my house. I think I'm going to like them"

Gameboy,3aj53z,HumDar,4,Sat Jun 20 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, install Chinese repro silicone pads. But responsiveness will take a dive. :-/"
Gameboy,3aj53z,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"Not exactly unfortunately. The GBA SP uses very tiny momentary switches under the buttons and D-Pad giving it that nice solid 'click'  All of the other GameBoys use a piece of silicone that acts as the switch, and essentially the spring. This is why they feel 'mushey' because you're relying on the silicone to 'spring' the buttons back up.  The only slight work around to this is if you use new 3rd party silicon pads from eBay/China. They are quite a bit more stiff. The trade off is they are less responsive because you have to press harder.  For what it's worth, it may be worth trying for you. I personally prefer the feel of the original OEM silicon. :)"

Gameboy,3agcmp,the_8bit_kingdom,2,Sat Jun 20 19:54:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, its the same process. Just solder each wire to a solder point on the new speaker and you're in business."
Gameboy,3ag76f,Saltyorphans71,2,Fri Jun 19 21:54:17 2015 UTC,"I like the GBA port better, I hate the screen scrolling of the GBC version."
Gameboy,3afozm,enovah,2,Fri Jun 19 19:29:08 2015 UTC,"I pretty much took a razor blade and just ""scratched"" it across the leads multiple times. I cut the top layer of the PCB but I didn't cut all the way through the PCB if that's what you're asking. This tutorial has some pretty good pictures of what it should look like afterwards."
Gameboy,3afozm,dibmem,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yep - that's the guide the OP is referring to...  It is admittedly vague when it comes to what exactly needs to be done in regards to severing the traces on the board.  I had weird stuff happening on my screen the first time I did a bivert mod (I called it 'artifacting' earlier, which may have been inaccurate as I don't recall specifically what it was doing other than 'looking WEIRD') but I always cut the traces now, as I've gained a better understanding of what exactly the chip is doing."
Gameboy,3afozm,dibmem,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:44:27 2015 UTC,Try a sharp razor blade instead.  You may not be able to feel the blade of a box cutter working through the traces.  It is a delicate cut.
Gameboy,3afozm,dibmem,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:40:12 2015 UTC,"so the bigger question is, do i just cut into the PCB?"
Gameboy,3afozm,robert812003,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"Depends on your skill level.  I've done both - Lifting the legs / cutting the traces.  I can redo the traces if I needed to  - Lifting the legs is tedious and cutting the traces achieves the same goal.  If you don't cut the traces (one way or another), you'll get weird artifacting on your screen with the chip installed.  If you have more than one Gameboy - I recommend learning both methods. (I hope that's what you were asking :-P)"
Gameboy,3afozm,dibmem,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"I wish someone could show how this is done...   I somehow installed a bivert chip, got to the step OP is questioning and sorta shrugged and moved onto the next step. I had no idea what it was talking about.  My bivert somehow works great and I've got no artifacting =D"
Gameboy,3ad9k9,Saloncinx,2,Fri Jun 19 04:19:21 2015 UTC,"Looks great. In your opinion, Whats the best overall? Price, installation, power, effectiveness, ease?"
Gameboy,3ad9k9,WizardPineapple,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:28:56 2015 UTC,"THB. I think these HHL ones are the same as the kitsch-bent ones. I like these kits way better then any of the other mods (like using a GBA SP Screen) they are much easier to install and setup/install.  In terms of price. it's really a toss up between KB and HHL.  HHL offers free shipping with orders over $50 and they ship FAST. Order on Tuesday get it on Saturday.  KB charges $5 to $6.50 for shipping and it takes FOREVER upwards of 4 weeks from time of purchase. However they also sell buttons and other little things like that, so it may be worth it for you.  Both sites sell the screens for nearly the same price. $11.50 to $12.50ish."
Gameboy,3ad9k9,WizardPineapple,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:37:09 2015 UTC,Good to know man! Keep up the good work!
Gameboy,3ad9k9,xZPFxBarteq,2,Fri Jun 19 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"I've installed one from KB in my GBC and regretted it so much. You gain the ability to play in darkness but you lose like half of the colours. Not really worth it for me, playing Link's Awakening DX with it was.. sad.  I'm an amateur so it wasn't done perfectly, yours is certainly done better than mine but looking at the photos with Pokemon I still wouldn't go for it.  This is just my 2 cents, usually when I come across the topic of GBC frontlights everyone is like 'awesome!'.. so I just wanted to point out that you should really consider the cons before going for it."
Gameboy,3ad9k9,gibsonlp223,2,Fri Jun 19 22:25:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah this really is one of the downsides, unfortunately it looks like there's no way to win with the gbc in terms of playing it comfortably: you're either going to sacrifice eye comfort by straining to see it in anything except direct sunlight or you sacrifice accurate color reproduction. I installed one this weekend and while it looks awesome I am a little disappointed by the washed out look it gives. But oh well, if I want the games to look good I can play them on my sp, but nothing beats that OG console feel."
Gameboy,3ad9k9,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:33:58 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you there. My personal belief is that if done correctly the frontlight mod will still look better then trying to use a wormlight device.  You are correct though, you do lose some of the color accuracy :("

Gameboy,3a5y31,Aylesbury,6,Wed Jun 17 21:37:54 2015 UTC,"I can think of quite a few reasons, including still ignorance. More people than you'd think can't even remotely fathom why someone would want something like this (ie. ""I played with this as a child so that's a kid's toy, no kid today wants this""). Maybe they just moved onto the next iteration (GBC, GBA or whatever they got). Either way, as a result it got stored in that corner of a house most households seem to have where many things go to be forgotten for years.  Perhaps they could make good money and honestly couldn't care less about making some cash. Then again som people don't just can't be assed in general to try to sell it for ""hardly anything"", regardless of their income.  EDIT: Sheesh, get downvoted for throwing out possible explanations?

If these come with box and manual you're looking at a hell of a steal there, if they're loose carts I'd say the price is just okayish.

Gameboy,3a9gps,Saloncinx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:31:58 2015 UTC,"I would agree that the Corrected Orientation SP mod is the best looking. but it's a PITA, and requires getting your hands on SP screens. Going with the HHL or Kitsch-Bent GBC frontlight kits will probably be less expensive.  Each mod also depends on the quality of LOCA you are using. OSAKA brand is second to none, and is the best quality made.  I personally use the KB screens, and they are very easy to install and set up :)"
Gameboy,3a9gps,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the k/b front light is actually pretty damn clear with Osaka.

Gameboy,3a45o7,Saloncinx,2,Wed Jun 17 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"Stay away from the vintage licensed nylon bags, most of them are in rough shape and even if they are in decent shape the insides are deteriorating since they were made as cheap as possible in the late 80s / early 90s.  My favorite so far is the Asciiware / Nexoft plastic hard cases, comes in a big (Carry-All) and a small version both can be had on eBay for less than $15 USD in good shape."
Gameboy,3a40nb,paperclip_bandit,5,Wed Jun 17 01:34:31 2015 UTC,There are pokemon edition Gameboy SP's that can play both GB/GBC/Advance games.  Here's the pikachu version
Gameboy,3a40nb,dangerfieldxx,3,Wed Jun 17 05:21:24 2015 UTC,"If I wanted something for the collection I'd get the color, if I wanted something to play I'd get the micro.  If he's never had a micro I'd lean towards that. I love my micro, the small display makes the games look so crisp. You can also get a USB charger cable if you don't want to pay for a charger, they work really well and they work with a USB battery pack which is just amazing for travelling. Micro + pokemon + 15000mah = about 165 hours continuous play."
Gameboy,3a40nb,robot_swagger,3,Wed Jun 17 08:54:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he'll really enjoy either. if he's a Pokemon fan, he'll love the GBC for the look and nostalgia, but he'll love the micro because it's so portable and more playable (the screen is actually lit, so it's not hard to see). So if you want to get him something he'll play, the micro is the way to go. If you want to get him something to add to his collection, they're both great options."
Gameboy,3a40nb,the_8bit_kingdom,3,Wed Jun 17 05:14:03 2015 UTC,"What would be really awesome would be to get him a pokemon gbc with a front light mod, sorta like this one.  http://m.imgur.com/a/5z5VN#"

Did he grow up playing the GB/GBC games or later games? If the former, I'd probably go with the special edition GBC, which is a nice piece and fairly affordable, I believe, especially if you get it loose."
Gameboy,3a40nb,alanbbent,2,Wed Jun 17 01:42:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to link things on here and I'm on my phone I'm so sorry!!  I honestly do not know what he plays, I just know he's interested in both systems from going to a gaming store with him. He specifically asked for the micro at one point, but then talked about wanting to buy the limited edition color all night.  I'm pretty sure he's familiar with both though. I guess a good idea would be to snoop through his games and see..."
Gameboy,3a40nb,Grimages,2,Wed Jun 17 01:54:51 2015 UTC,"No worries. Hmm. Did you find that Micro in your price range? I wasn't familiar with it, so I tried to find what you're talking about; if you mean the Pokemon Center one (which was the only Pokemon-themed Micro I could dredge up with a quick search), then it's probably going to run significantly more than $100. But I think you can snag the GBC within your budget."
Gameboy,3a4s8t,boyfromthebush,2,Wed Jun 17 05:47:14 2015 UTC,"this gameshark will work for yellow and gold, as they are a color and regular game. it will not work for emerald and firered however, as these are GBA games. as far as i know there isn't a single gameshark that will do both. you need two for all these games."

But if you must do it the legit way, you can get a gamecube, a gameboy player, and a capture card for the gamecube (not sure which one will work, you'll have to do some research here). GameGrumps did it that way at least for their FireRed playthrough. It's a really silly workaround though when you can just emulate on your PC and skip the capture nonsense."

It basically needs one side to be textured (sanded?) and the other side to be smooth, which the GB backlight kit merely has painted on bumps on one side (upon disassembly of it).  Using loca may help, but I doubt it would be in a usable / enjoyable state.  If you're looking for an alternative to the two main, known methods, I recommend using the light panel of an old or broken PDA. Those results are actually very close to that of the gba-sp's light panel.  But, you should explore your curiosity in the name of science if you wish. Who knows, you may discover something new. :-)"
Gameboy,39zl01,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"Really?  It was honestly that bad?  The only reason I question is because in the pictures it doesn't look horrible.  Specifically the first image.  I know you're the pro with all things modding, but It just looks, to me, like it'd be okay.  But if you say you've experimented with it a few times.  What differentiates this from the kitcschshcshcshch-bent version?"
Gameboy,39zl01,the_8bit_kingdom,3,Tue Jun 16 02:58:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because backlighting is different from frontlighting.  The GB backlight kits (dmg and pocket) are made to disperse light behind the LCD (2 smooth sides, one of them with artificially painted bumps / light panel placed behind LCD (hence ""backlight"")) , whereas frontlight panels are designed to disperse the majority of its light to one side (the smooth side, which should be facing the LCD screen (hence "" front light"")).  I'm actually not a pro with ALL things modding, but certainly the gbc. Thank you for your high regards nonetheless. :-)"

I picked it up, didn't really look it over, and took it home. I read the label, I turned it on and noticed the screen only had one mode, and posted.  Now I look at the label again, and it says AGS-001.  The ad stated ""It's the model with the screen brightener,"" but not that it was a 101. I'm dumb for not checking beforehand.

Bad business IMO and I have had issues with him in the past. I'm going to be opening a claim with PayPal to get my money back.

Gameboy,39us8z,A-Honkey-21,2,Sun Jun 14 23:33:26 2015 UTC,Afraid I can't help you ATM but I frequent www.shopgoodwill.com and they always have a lot of the old Pokémon games for sale. I'm currently looking for Silver. If they have the pair up for sale I'll let you know and maybe we can go in on it together :)

Gameboy,39us8z,elliottstanger,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:00:14 2015 UTC,There is 3 silvers on that website
Gameboy,39us8z,swrrga,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:01:51 2015 UTC,Right but I'm only willing to spend a certain amount. For whatever reason individual games on that site sell way high (plus shipping can be outrageous) but multiple games are cheaper when you factor in shipping. If there's a Silver/Red combo we could split it and each save some moolah.
Gameboy,39us8z,AndrewPH,2,Mon Jun 15 00:04:13 2015 UTC,"Lots of people look at the ""buy new"" price for classic games on amazon - $389.99 for pokemon red as of writing - and go ""holy shit!!!""  Prices on ebay are much more reasonable. You should be able to find it for $20 or less, especially if you're handy with a soldering iron and can put in a new save battery.   I would ballpark   ~$40 - Mint-looking cartridge, new save battery  ~$30 for a great looking cart (some little scuffs) with a brand new save battery.  ~$20 for a good looking cart that saves, but is still on its original battery that will probably die soon.  ~$12-$15 for a good-looking cart with a dead save battery, or a missing-label cart with an original working save battery.  ~$5-$8 for a missing label, dead battery cart.  If you don't know how to solder, get the cheapest cartridge you can find that has a NEW save battery. The original batteries are only rated for 10 years and they're now almost 20, so even if it's working today there's no guarantee that it won't glitch and fail out on you in a few months after you've put 80 hours in (very frustrating).  If you do have experience soldering you can save a few bucks by putting a new battery in a ""WONT SAVE"" cart, I'd recommend doing this as soon as you recieve it."
Gameboy,39us8z,st1tchy,2,Mon Jun 15 03:13:42 2015 UTC,"Even if you don’t know how to solder, you can replace the battery fairly easily. You just have to make sure the tabs are electrical taped very tightly to the battery after replacement."

Gameboy,39mv6r,Red-Blue-,3,Fri Jun 12 21:32:22 2015 UTC,"The Black one (""Onyx"", with dark grey buttons) is 001 model, front-lit. The Grey one (""Graphite"", with black buttons) is 101 model back-lit.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_SP  But if you stumble on a mix of these, more than likely someone has switched parts. You can count on scallowags doing stuff like that to get 101 money for a 001 sp, so when buying, be wary and do your research.  One way to tell the difference when the units are off is that the back-lit LCDs appear much darker than the front-lit LCDs."

If it's plastic, and this dust really bugs you, consider picking a new one up and replacing it like the old OEM screens advised: stick one of those sticky tape hooks onto the screen and pull it out from the front. Or use the a single edged blade (broad edge, not a corner). If it's glass though, probably only safe to remove by pushing out from the inside.

If you have a new shell, then who cares if the buttons are all messed up, the shell is all dinged up, screen lens is all scratched to hell.  I never understood why people think eBay is sketchy. Just do some basic research. Does the seller have less then 20 feedback as a seller (not just buyer feedback)? Do they have less then a 99% rating? It's safe to assume if they have more then 25 feedback as a seller and 99% positive feedback you're going to be okay :)  EDIT: Another good eBay test is to message the person and ask them a question. See how fast they answer. If you are serious about eBay like I am, my phone gives me a notification and you'll get an answer with in an hour.

Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright and trade secret infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions.

Gameboy,39f51i,TheRandomWolf,4,Thu Jun 11 08:37:42 2015 UTC,"Ebay works fine if you are an informed buyer. You need to spend quite a bit of time to become an expert though, like read through the last 20 counterfeit discussions here.  This is worth it if you want to become a collector on a larger scale. If you just want a few pokemon games, it might be worth it to pay the premium with a trusted vendor, as time is money.  I personally only bought fakes once from ebay, but I see them every day. And >95% of people are happy with them, as judged by the reviews of the sellers of fakes."
Gameboy,39f51i,jamesjoyce1882,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"For very popular or expensive games, I wouldn't bid if the seller didn't have pictures of the front, back, and inside of the cart.   I'm sure some that don't have all three are legit, and that some sellers will use pictures of the real thing and then send a fake. Dealing with a fake that lands in your lap is troublesome to get your money back and risk getting retaliatory negative feedback, so why take the risk? Pokemon games in particular were produced in massive numbers."

BulletGBA is one I'm eager to try out soon, also bullet hell, but looks good also, although rotating the gameboy to play might be a problem for playing on an SP system.  I don't know a lot of homebrew for the GB or GBC. Most of the ones I played around with when I first got a Flash2Advance 10 years ago refused to run on hardware. Later I found out most only run on Bung carts or emulator only."

They look better than originals scratched to oblivion. I recommend using the original's buttons and rubber pads though, the ones that come with the shell are pretty bad. Also screw the screws in once before you put it together, the holes aren't pre-drilled and if you strip a screw during reassembly you're in trouble. Personally, I think these shells are worth it."

Price recently went up, but $12 is quite fair for a quality screwdriver. While you're at it, pick up some JIS spec drivers, too, to avoid stripping the other screws as they go into the shell.

The higher risk of fakes depresses prices so your collection might not be worth as much as it would otherwise.

Gameboy,38x5y0,enovah,4,Sun Jun 7 16:29:12 2015 UTC,"Try installing a 1k ohm trim potentiometer. That way you can adjust the sweet spot brightness level at any time.  Other than that, personally, I use the left column (1 and 4) exclusively with no issues. I've used other solder points but those work best for me.  Another good set of points I use are on the front, on the long row of pins from the cartridge slot. I believe its 1 and 32 if I remember correctly. But they're labeled ""grnd"" and ""vdd"" anyway, if that helps.  Here's a sample link to the trim pots I use.http://www.ebay.com/itm/301489856462?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT  Another issue it reminds me of is the loca type, it could be causing those column of light issues. Since I got off the no name stuff I haven't had those issues anymore.   In addition, I have a sub which I specialize in GBC customizing and modding.

Gameboy,38x5y0,Saloncinx,3,Sun Jun 7 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"/u/the_8bit_kingdom is the best with his tutorials and information! His subreddit will be very helpful for you.  Also, I would agree, odd-brand LOCA will not look great. Bite the bullet and get the 30mL of OSAKA 6 for like $26 shipped. 30mL is enough for like 20 screens easily. I could get 3 to 4 screens out of the no name 5mL LOCA."
Gameboy,38x5y0,Saloncinx,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"So I noticed these white cracks at the bottom of the frontlight/LOCA screen. I opened my GBC up and it looks like......my LOCA somehow melted. It was also soft enough that I could actually peel off my frontlight and then I slowly peeled off the ""cured"" LOCA.  It was really weird. Has that ever happened to you?   And as a side note, I cured the LOCA outside in the sun for over an hour. I'm pretty sure it was nice and cured when I brought it back in."
Gameboy,38x5y0,the_8bit_kingdom,2,Thu Jun 11 04:07:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the brand of LOCA, or more like, it wasn't actually LOCA.  I have personally left a GBC screen with OSAKA 6 in my UV light for well over an hour because I forgot about it (work bench in basement) and it was totally fine. I have one of those 36 watt nail UV lights. If anything would melt my screen or over cook the glue that'd be it."
Gameboy,38x5y0,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:07:59 2015 UTC,Well the weird part was that it started to melt about a week later. I did leave the gbc color upstairs where it's usually warmer but I didn't think that would be enough to cause the adhesive to melt.

Gameboy,38tffp,alanbbent,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"Toothpaste, plastic polish, etc are all just micro-abrasive substances. So instead of filling the scratch, they just ""widen the valley"" of the scratch, so that in certain situations, it's not as noticeable. Works great on car headlight covers, since thousands of tiny scratches will keep light from passing through that thick plastic, until the grooves are widened out, essentially grinding down the rest of the plastic to the depth of the scratch, or close to it. Not sure how well it would work on a gbc lens, but it's worth trying it on an old discarded one first, maybe a DMG one, before the real deal."
Gameboy,38tffp,_imjosh,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:57:00 2015 UTC,I bought a three-step plastic polish. I will be trying to repair DMG lenses with it as soon as I have the time.  I had some marginal success using it to remove scratches from the clear plastic on top of a gamecube.

Gameboy,38ppuc,honkey-tonk,4,Fri Jun 5 20:33:34 2015 UTC,"They are ""Water Slide Decals"" that are applied to the inside of the shell before it is painted.

Kudos on leaving the front layer of black adhesive around the screen. Not many do that. It also helps make a better seal to block dust and crap from getting on the LCD."
Gameboy,38ns1s,baby_shoo-shoo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:00:41 2015 UTC,"That adhesive gasket thing is the #1 thing I wish were available aftermarket.   I picked up a broken GBC with a cracked screen and when I opened it up I discovered they took a screwdriver to the screen with too much force, which shattered the glass. I would never have been able to remove all the microscopic glass shards embedded in it, and I had to remove it altogether or else risk scratching the new screen or having them work themselves loose and get crammed somewhere else where they'll do damage."
Gameboy,38ns1s,Northwait,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:17:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm, didn't know they made something like that. I'll have to look into it next time.

I was just being kinda lazy about it last night."

Gameboy,38keqq,explodingbaconman,2,Thu Jun 4 22:11:03 2015 UTC,Those are real for sure; fakes never use the holographic stickers; it's too difficult (impossible) to print without a special industrial printer. People who fake these games can't afford that stuff  Nor is it worth the investment
Gameboy,38keqq,Bernkastel-Kues,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:43:06 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that firered and leafgreen were in translucent cases. I never owned either but I thought it was a good initial fake test.

Gameboy,38jhcz,Ketalar,5,Thu Jun 4 17:21:38 2015 UTC,"90% of the time you see 5 or so GBA pokemon games on eBay they are fakes. Selling counterfeit goods is illegal so if you received them and they were not real, you could file a dispute and get refunded."
Gameboy,38jhcz,Nomnom_downvotes,3,Thu Jun 4 17:20:33 2015 UTC,i would say over priced. But its legit!
Gameboy,38jhcz,geomaximus,2,Thu Jun 4 23:13:03 2015 UTC,The Micro is a bit scratched up to be that much and the Pokemon games' labels are a little too messed up to add up to 200 bucks. The games can even be fakes but at a glance they seem alright.
Gameboy,38jhcz,Wensleydale_Gaming,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"Real pokemon gba games will have a shiny label.

Gameboy,38f1x5,asdfqwer426,5,Wed Jun 3 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"I installed a handheld legend green backlight in this thing and biverted the screen. regretfully its a bit too thick, and has some pressure spots. the other fun bit is the DSi rechargeable battery installed. regretfully, i fried one of the LEDs in the backlight experimenting with this. do not do this without installing a resistor! i went with a 33ohm 1/4 watt. seems to work fine.  I crammed a PAM8403 into a corner, and cut a hole for a micro USB port for charging. I had to cut out the entire battery compartment, minus the bottom part with the screw holes, to fit the DSi battery, but its a great fit. the door holds it securely in place, it has a short wire running to the charging circuit, so it can be pulled out to unscrew the case.  I'm still seeing how the battery works, it's been running 6 hours straight and working great so far. heard the pocket has bad battery life, so hoping this will help. when it comes time to recharge, the PAM board has a red led that will turn on when its plugged in, it changes green when charged. the clear case works great for this.   I'm definitely considering installing a battery indicator led and replacing my screen lens, as i have an early model pocket with no indicator. i'm not sure the indicator will work right with the different battery and backlight. we'll see.   EDIT: updated battery run time.  EDIT: so it finally peaked out at about 9.5 hours. the backlight started to get unreadably dim right before the screen started to get all sorts of squiggly lines from the signal breaking down. the testing was with pokemon silver in. most of the time it was sitting on the title screen running the into over and over again, but i did get a few hours play time in as well. I'll gladly take 9.5 hours rechargable battery life. these little PAM chips are awesome."

Gameboy,38f1x5,Saloncinx,2,Wed Jun 3 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"thats what seems really popular for pockets. i'm considering it, since i burnt out one of the LEDs, which is part of that hot spot.

Gameboy,38h6hr,Saloncinx,3,Thu Jun 4 05:17:35 2015 UTC,"unfortunately it's usually better to buy a trashed GameBoy and harvest it.  For example, you can buy new GameBoy Color LCD's for $19.  However, you can find GBC's that are in absolutely horrible condition, that don't have sound, or don't turn on at all, screen cover is all messed up, covered in sticky goo from tape holding the batteries in ect... for like $5-$8 and 9 times out of 10 the LCD is totally fine."

I know you've been trying to find a way to frontlight without an SP screen or kitsch bent, but diffusing that light seems key"
Gameboy,38cra5,xwatchmanx,3,Wed Jun 3 13:51:31 2015 UTC,"The screen looks absolutely amazing in person. I can't seem to get accurate enough clear photos but the light is diffused.

Could be my camera too. I'll try and do a video sometime, see if its any better."

Gameboy,38cyc1,asdfqwer426,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:26:14 2015 UTC,I run into that exact same problem now and then. I'm of the opinion that certain backlights are just a little too thick. I've tried a bunch of stuff to try and fix it but no dice yet.
Gameboy,38cyc1,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"thats unfortunate. is the size difference a manufacturing thing, where 2 from the same seller can be different, or is it dependent upon where its bought from?   regretfully my attempts at a dsi battery mod burned out one of the 4 leds on my handheld legend screen. maybe i'll buy another and hope for the best."
Gameboy,38cyc1,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:33:47 2015 UTC,"It may be a batch size or something similar cause I only occasionally run into this issue. Lately, I've been using almost exclusively HHL backlights, and I've only had problems with some of the color ones, never the white ones.  Before that, I've had issues with DMG only backlights from other shops like kitsch-bent, asm retro,etc. I'm guessing they're older batches cause the more modern ones are sized to fit DMG and pocket. But all of that is just my wild guess."
Gameboy,38cyc1,Elysiom,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"This. I've used backlights from…  ASM Retro Destiny (currently my favorite but seems to be hard to find in stock for colors other than pink) - clean install, integrated 100 ohm resistor, no cutting and its thin - doesn't cause any issues with the LCD half / pressure points / bulging screen lens  Nonfinite Electronics v5: - really clean install, no cutting and its thin - doesn't cause any issues with the LCD half / pressure points / bulging screen lens - it's as good as the Destiny but I'm not a fan of the required 100 ohm trim pot for my own stupid reasons other than I just want to keep the install dead simple.  Hand Held Legend 4-LED Backlight: If you want to save a few bucks its decent but I'm not a fan of this one - it's and older backlight so you have to cut the white LCD plastic frame and also solder the included 100 ohm resistor, it's way too thick and causes LCD pressure points / bulging screen lens - the way I have dealt with this in the past is back off the 4 screws a little bit on the top half of the LCD until it feels and looks right."
Gameboy,38cyc1,Elysiom,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:55:15 2015 UTC,"thanks for the info. I'll keep an eye on asm retro in hopes they get other colors, if not i'll probably check out nonfinite electronics. is the trim pot a requirement, or just that it needs some sort of resistor. as in its not built in into the screen like the ASM?"
Gameboy,38cyc1,Elysiom,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:54:59 2015 UTC,"The trim pot (included) or supply your own resistor, I think it's required I've heard stories of v5s getting hot"
Gameboy,38cyc1,honkey-tonk,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:04:29 2015 UTC,Just want to update my post -  After doing a few more of these… Nonfinite Electronics v5 is my new favorite even if you have to solder the trim pot - nice thing about these backlights when you do a bivert mod is that they have the polarizing film installed in the correct orientation right out of the box. So there is less chance for any dust or junk on the polarizing film :)  Also I have a few biverted DMGs with ASM Retro white backlights installed for sale (with a free game for $70 shipped) if anyone is interested.
Gameboy,38cyc1,enovah,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:46:33 2015 UTC,"Asm retro has backlights which fit the pocket very well. You could repurposed that one with the blob , sell or trade it to fund your new light."
Gameboy,38cyc1,enovah,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:07:45 2015 UTC,I actually had the same question after putting my HHL backlight into my gameboy pocket. Had a pretty bad pressure spot on the right side due to the thick plastic piece underneath the lcd ribbon. Unfortunately for me I messed with it too much and now I have an lcd screen with some messed up vertical lines :/ Gonna see what I can do to try to fix it.

But a word of advice to those who love his wares, any time you can, stock up on that stuff cause it takes awhile to get back in stock or he may need to play catch-up like he is now.  I think he's done an outstanding job so far considering he's been taking on the world basically alone."
Gameboy,38di48,honkey-tonk,3,Wed Jun 3 16:02:37 2015 UTC,"While I agree in the fact that it is not easy, and his products are AWESOME, I have a problem paying extra for expedited shipping only to have the thing ship over 5 days later, then receive 4 days later. I think that's where my issue is. I get stuff from China faster!  And yes, stock up! However Hand Held Legend has free shipping over $50 and they normally ship the next day or day later, and then I get it in like 3 days. Not trying to bash KB, I was just wondering if there were other options :) Again, KB's work is amazing, but if you're charging $5 for the basic shipping, and all your stuff is pretty small I expect it to being a $5 USPS flat rate box that gets delivered in 2-3 days. Buy a Zebra label printer, find some highschool kid that loves retro stuff and pay them minimun wage under the table and call it a day."

I've been wanting to make a backlit DMG that has a potentiometer on the backlight, so it can be as dim/bright as I need it.  Do you have a headphone adapter for your SP? That would be ideal in a situation like yours."

Gameboy,387n8u,Raulitoyeah,2,Tue Jun 2 16:32:44 2015 UTC,There are a number of new/used/custom faceplates on eBay.  I linked to the particular custom aftermarket one I bought in a comment above.
Gameboy,387n8u,robert812003,3,Tue Jun 2 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"Looks like the one sold on rosecoloredgaming.  How did you manage to buy anything from them? It's like snagging a leprechaun...  edit I see the vendor you linked sells reproductions of the faceplates from the custom RoseColored GBMicros. Seems the quality is lower than what RoseColored sells, but lower quality plates are better than watching the 'sold out' icons change to over 'never producing this again' at RoseColored any day of the week =D"
Gameboy,387n8u,Zabii,4,Tue Jun 2 17:11:45 2015 UTC,I honestly just think that RoseColored gets their shit from the same supplier.
Gameboy,387n8u,Kordan9090,2,Wed Jun 3 02:03:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm pretty sure of that as well. The quality actually looks exactly the same as the one I got from RCG.

The only problem with this method (or at least only problem I've encountered) is that the light screen itself is incredibly delicate. I rubbed it down with glass cleaner and it had tears in the film that you can see when the GBC powers on."
Gameboy,384t7j,Shroudedheart6,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:59:21 2015 UTC,"""Best"" is always going to be subjective.  The clearest is sp horizontal, but it sucks up dust like a dirt devil, which can make you want to tear it down and clean it like every freakin week. lol  The kitsch-bent one is not as crystal clear, but it's brighter and with a trim potentiometer is very versatile. Plus it's more durable and you won't get any further dust in between the light panel and lcd.   Aparently there are many ways and variations to frontlight a gbc, hell, someone even did it with a PDA backlight panel) and that's very cool to know cause most people will tell you there is only 2, but that's just becuase they don't know any better. lol"

Gameboy,383lh3,honkey-tonk,2,Mon Jun 1 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"I won an auction for $42. It was the seller's for personal use, at least that is what it said in the description. It has the original shell, only the screen lens is new.   I am not sure entirely what light method was used but it looks like the kitsch-bent screen to me. The seller said he used LOCA on the light panel and it shows. Not a perfect mod but it's in good shape and I'm pretty happy with it. I'm probably never going to get around to finishing my mod on mine so..."
Gameboy,383lh3,Saloncinx,2,Mon Jun 1 20:10:49 2015 UTC,Not bad. I usually charge more then that for my non custom front light GBC's

Gameboy,3835md,pohatu771,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"For more information, my younger sibling broke the screen back in the day (at least 6/7 years back) and hid it until I found it about a month later. Yes, I did cry - a lot - but I always kept the console itself for some reason. I've been tinkering with my DS Lite lately to fix a broken hinge, and found this at the back of a draw and realised I could fix it. It still switches on, charges, and everything else - it just needs the screen swapped. The other GBASP is red, and I can't remember the model atm - but I picked it up at a yard sale for £5 a couple of years back and have never been paticularly attached to it quite like this one. I would probably cry all over again if I could get it working again. (Also, the bite marks - never put it in a soft chewable case with ill-behaved puppies around. It was otherwise unscathed, thank goodness)"

They literally never have any systems in stock for longer than about an hour after they go up. I remember they put up 50 GBAs in the middle of the night (4am CST) for $265 each and they sold out so quickly someone actually bugged the system and bought a 51st unit. It is a complete lottery to ever buy a system from them in my experience.  I gave up on them a year ago when they were basically just making excuses as to why they couldn't meet demand."

Gameboy,37p8o0,bishopk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:20:43 2015 UTC,They make limited runs of nearly everything they produce; that's their prerogative. They're fairly good at giving advance warning on their Facebook page when new items go up for sale.
Gameboy,37p8o0,SC2_Bench,1 point,Fri May 29 14:10:25 2015 UTC,"Most of the stuff on their site I recognize from well over a year ago. I would say most of their stuff are staples they continually produce (things like Dingy DMG) and they make limited runs of stuff here and there. I would be less critical if they sold out of limited run stuff quickly but managed to keep their staples fairly in stock but that isn't the case.  I also remember them buying a bigger workshop just to increase production which doesn't seem to fall in line with purely limited releases.   Regardless of how much advanced warning you get for stuff being put up, it usually sells out instantly. I went through the frustration on several releases of quickly buying stuff the moment it went up only to find it not allowing me to check out at the end of the process because it was sold out already.  I mean, now that their GBAs don't even use a lighting mod (the whole thing that set RGC apart from other customizers) it shouldn't take someone longer than about 30 minutes, if even that, to assemble a unit. It is literally just moving a PCB to a new set of shells and buttons, popping on a glass lens and changing out the stickers. I used to build and sell prosound backlit gameboys on the side and it would take me MAYBE an hour to solder and put one together once I had the stuff in front of me. I don't know if they need to order more buttons and shells (probably not given those always seem to be in stock) or if have a hard time tracking enough units but they could be making way more money if they put forth a more concerted effort, I feel."
Gameboy,37p8o0,_imjosh,1 point,Fri May 29 14:42:15 2015 UTC,"it shouldn't take someone longer than about 30 minutes   to be fair, some of their custom packaging likely takes more than 30 minutes a unit - just for the packaging. And I know I've spent more than 30 minutes just trying to find a piece of glass with no noticeable flaws and clean it properly.  For some of RCGs GBAs, they are taking the stock glass, removing the paint, and applying their custom decals.  not to mention that a lot of their shells are custom paint jobs.  it's painstaking stuff. honestly I don't think they were charging enough considering the amount of manpower that goes into it and, considering that they could sell fifty $250 game boys in like three minutes, it seems they could have charged a lot more."
Gameboy,37p8o0,SC2_Bench,1 point,Sat May 30 03:05:09 2015 UTC,"aren't most of their non-limited run units just died/custom made shells? I could be wrong but I thought they just got their shells made at a factory or dyed existing shells.  Also, the stock lens is plastic. They get glass ones made that just get popped on after removing the stock plastic one. I don't think they make the lenses themselves.   Like this unit: http://rosecoloredgaming.com/uploads/3/3/0/0/3300087/6472251_orig.jpg?357  This is just a painted/dyed unit. They remove the screen, put on one of their glass ones, change out the buttons and the sticker on the back.  Even their more expensive units don't seem to have anything artist oriented going on: http://rosecoloredgaming.com/uploads/3/3/0/0/3300087/5029332_orig.jpg?515  I will give it to them that the packaging is pretty complicated now that I have looked through some images of it."

Those lenses come from the factory w/ all sorts of defects that I would not expect to find in a $200+ mod.  They also do not come perfectly clean and it's a huge pain to a) find one w/ 0 scratches or defects and then b) get it perfectly clean w/ no spots or dust particles.    http://rosecoloredgaming.com/uploads/3/3/0/0/3300087/5029332_orig.jpg?515   now that one is an example of where they've taken the stock replacement lens and removed all the original paint and affixed their custom decal to it.  there's a blog entry somewhere on how they do it and it's a crazy lot of work. not only that, but the yellow and red buttons were custom made, hand molded. that's crazy."

The SNES ones are glass lenses too so wouldn't they just get them made with the alternative logo on them? Are these glass lenses not something they custom order?  Sounds like there might be more work that I know of.  Also, I don't think they hand mold EACH button :P I make prop replicas, I would have just made a vacuuform of a stock button and turn it into a simple pour mold. I could churn out a dozen buttons in like an hour probably."

Also, I don't think they hand mold EACH button :P I make prop replicas, I would have just made a vacuuform of a stock button and turn it into a simple pour mold.    well, yeah. they made silicon molds for the buttons and cast them probably a dozen at a time. but it's not like they just order them from some factory.

Ignoring all the ""features"" it still doesn't work very well and takes far to long from cold to actually play a game.   The roms had to be perfect in mine, I had to manually mess with a load of the roms to stip dodgy headers and it would still bug every now and then.    It takes forever to load. I got so frustrated when playing final fantasy tactics, you randomly get restrictions like no swords and no white magic and sometimes you just can't complete a level with a certain combinations of restrictions. So you have to reset, and reload.  I have always been extremely bitter about my purchase and for the money I wish I had just bought a few legit games. I love having a flash card but the ez4 takes to much for ""convenience"".  I also have the mini sd one which is just retarded, I have never even seen a mini card.

It actually plays physical GBA carts and roms (via its own flash cart).    IMO the other interesting features are: You can link with it. It has a real time clock so you can get berries, etc when playing a pokemon rom. It has a cheat engine. TV-out via a 2.5 mm AV cable. It has a few emulators, supposedly NES, Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gamegear, Master System, and PC-Engine/TurboGrafx-16 systems all play ok. The device essentially uses the PocketNES, Goomba Color/Goomba Paletted, SMSAdvance, and PCEAdvance emulators."

There's actually nothing illegal in the US about selling a hardware clone, so long as it was done properly. The emulators are also perfectly legal. Everything about the K101 is, to my knowledge, perfectly legal in the US. A user grabbing ROMs from the internet is a different story, but that's not actually required to use the device, as it has a physical cart slot for playing legit games. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe you can even use it to rip ROMs from your own carts. If not, use a DS for that, and the whole thing is legal."

The emulation of other systems was a little disappointing; NES and Master System games suffer from skittish performance and ropey audio, while PC Engine emulation is so sluggish it's practically unplayable on some games. The primitive Game Boy is emulated more faithfully by the hardware, but in all honesty, we wouldn't recommend investing in this system as a means to experience such games - you're not getting a decent representation of them, and are much better off either tracking down the original hardware and carts or obtaining them via one of Nintendo's download services.   So probably not great for emulation."
Gameboy,37p8o0,cheapshot,2,Fri May 29 14:18:50 2015 UTC,That's weird. The price they're asking (roughly the price of a GBA SP + half of an EZ Flash IV) doesn't justify making it.

I'll see if I can get something typed up with them. Basically I use sprat paint in very light coats, and cure/dry it between coats very quickly with a super bright/hot 1000w spotlight that hangs over the top of them. Makes the layering process only take 5 min between coats instead of like 30 min.  Other then that.... tape. lots of tape. Go ahead and buy the combo pack of 2 inch wide 3M blue painters tape. then go back to Home Depot and buy some more tape. can never have too much tape.....  Also, there are some parts of the gameboys that are a PITA to paint. for example the 'bulge' around where the batteries go, like the part you hold in the palm of your hand is hard to paint. It is very deep, and has alot of those little support pieces of molded plastic, so you have to give that part alot of TLC with out 'glopping' the paint on the easy to paint parts.  Krylon paint is VERY nice for this. Krylon is the only brand i have found that sprays in a 'column' and not like a circle if that makes sense. and you can use this column on spray to really get into the hard to reach spots with out dripping paint all over.  Also, also: first few coats are the most important. layer 1-5 need to be very light, and not drippy at all or else the whole thing will look like crap. after it's mostly opaque you can be less careful  :)"

Gameboy,37jisc,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Thu May 28 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"Nice galleries.  BTW if you are worried of cross talk (something I doubt would happen in audio signals in this case), twist the cable pair, or better even, get a shielded audio cable with a bifilar core (two wires, twisted preferably) and solder shield to common ground at both ends or one of them. Liquid tape has no magnetic isolation properties, which is what cross talk is about (hence why LAN cables for instance are twisted pair, to confine the magnetic field).  Other than that, excellent work! I can't check now but yesterday my search for aliexpress or ebay sellers offering generic frontlights proved unsuccessful. They are gone.  Have you restored GBA SPs? Any personal tips to clean the damned frontlight assembly? Any ideas on what to do with a working unit that has had its frontlight removed? Are Chinese sellers still selling complete GBA 101 backlight kits?"
Gameboy,37jisc,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Thu May 28 18:45:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Ah, good 'ol cross-talk (cross-chatter?). I have actually yet to come across that issue so far. But the method you described is very interesting!   I have indeed restored gba-sps and they're one of my favorites to work with. As far as cleaning the front light panel itself, I find that using virgin q-tips with a dab of isopropyl alcohol to gently wipe off the panel in a back and forth motion (with the grain of the textured front) works well enough for me to stick with it.  A working gba-sp with its front light removed can be modded to be a functional nds, sp and dsi battery charger, or simply parted out to repair or complete other units. Of course its always useful for gaming in the sun when out and about. Perhaps a vacation on the beach? ;-)  I've heard the backlight kits are available on some odd site, but only in large bulk. I'm surprised RCG hasn't jumped on them if its true, but I personally haven't seen any sign of them or the sp front lights which were available awhile back. :-("
Gameboy,37jisc,_imjosh,1 point,Thu May 28 21:38:57 2015 UTC,"PM me.  Don't worry too much about cross-talk seriously, or just twist the wires or use thin audio cable with braided shield and two inner wires, twisted helps too. Route them away from crystals/oscillators, coils and DC transformers and you are safe. At the level the GB has those signals you won't be dealing with too much trouble hehe.  I would like to make a custom frontlight for testing, see if it helps. I have several SPs with worn out cases but working internals, mostly. I don't have chargers for them though!"

Seems like a no brainier after you use the kick starter money for R&D. Get the cost down to like $60 a panel, sell them for $99 and use some $5 flat rate boxes. Im sure im over simplifying this but really, the technology is 17 years old"
Gameboy,37jisc,Saloncinx,2,Thu May 28 20:05:31 2015 UTC,I do what I can moi son. ;-)  I know right? Kickstarter is just what this thing needs. Whatever the cost you're right. This is wayyyy overdue. I imagine it will be the next big event in the world of game boy modding. Fingers crossed and I'm still fiddlin' with my tinker toys. Haha
Gameboy,37jisc,the_8bit_kingdom,2,Thu May 28 21:42:14 2015 UTC,"Acquire 100k on Kickstarter Contract some Chinese LCD manufacturer ??? Profit    EDIT: Did you ever try LOCA'ing the backlight to the LCD panel? and then LOCA'ing the polarizer to the front? Seems like there is an awful amount of light loss/refracted in those pics. Obviously LOCA'ing and curing everything together would mean it would be for nothing if it didnt work, but you never know."
Gameboy,37jisc,_imjosh,1 point,Thu May 28 21:47:43 2015 UTC,"At this point, I'm trying to see which configuration and orientation of film and light panel before I do any bonding, but yes I agree. I imagine reflective   shielding inside the LCD frame should help a little. I've noticed it helps with front lighting.  Thanks for the input. I believe we're on the cusp of solving this great mystery."
Gameboy,37jisc,Saloncinx,2,Fri May 29 00:30:07 2015 UTC,I tried to get some quotes to have new screens made but was unsuccessful.  I had one manufacturer at least tell me they would be able to reverse engineer one of the previously available backlit screens to be able to make them but they stopped responding to my inquiries after that.
Gameboy,37jisc,_imjosh,1 point,Fri May 29 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Im assuming it would look similar to the GBA backlit mod, where you have the full ribbon cable like normal, and then have to solder a wire or 2 for the backlight. Seems odd no one like RCG has looked into this. I can only imagine the amount that R.C.G, 8 Bit Evolution, Kitsch-Bent, Hand Held Legend and Thursday Customs would order!!!"
Gameboy,37jisc,Saloncinx,1 point,Fri May 29 05:10:44 2015 UTC,"actually to be clear, I was trying to get GBA screens made.  can you explain the appeal of a GBC when GBAs can play GBC games?"
Gameboy,37jisc,_imjosh,1 point,Sat May 30 04:58:37 2015 UTC,"GBC's are more customizable. and nostalgia. Same reason the original GameBoy has wayyy more custom parts available, when in theory the GameBoy Pocket, or Color is superior. All personal preference suppose :)"
Gameboy,37jisc,Saloncinx,1 point,Sat May 30 05:29:48 2015 UTC,thanks for the insights
Gameboy,37jisc,nrq,2,Sat May 30 08:30:07 2015 UTC,I would 'Kickstarter' the heck out of a true backlit LCD panel for the GBC! Someone needs to make this happen.  Also a kitsch bent front light with OSAKA LOCA seem to be the best method for now. and you dont have to eviscerate a perfectly good GBASP :)
Gameboy,37jisc,grem75,2,Thu May 28 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"Just ordered two kits, I hope they include LOCA glue since this is an intl order and I can't source that brand locally... I'm a bit swamped but I don't think it would be too difficult to create an I/O compatible screen IMHO, if you can source the right screen with the right pixel count or resolution.  I'm restoring two GBCs from a 'for parts' grab-bag I had around. I need replacement screens however, but there are some for sale out there. Should be fun. Already have two working GBCs in mint condition, but the other ones will be 'for the kids'. Haha."
Gameboy,37jisc,Saloncinx,1 point,Thu May 28 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"I think there's a knockoff GBC called the GB boy color or something like that. $25, comes preloaded with some games, plays GBC and GB games, and has a backlit screen. I'm thinking about getting one and trying to just swap shells with a real GBC because I'm sure it doesn't feel as good as a GBC."
Gameboy,37faad,SacKingsAmiiboHunter,7,Wed May 27 05:06:38 2015 UTC,"GBA SP and Micros all want 5V, doesn't matter where they come from.   You can even get a USB cable that will charge them from any port or USB charger. Here is one for a Micro. That is what I do with my SP, much more convenient since USB chargers are everywhere."
Gameboy,37faad,grem75,4,Wed May 27 05:42:33 2015 UTC,Just use a usb charger. Really handy with an external battery pack. Great for flying.
Gameboy,37faad,robot_swagger,2,Wed May 27 10:04:19 2015 UTC,"It will work fine, you can even use the Japanese wall charger if it comes with one.  The US and Japan use different wall voltages, but the difference is not great.  I have a Famicom that I play all the time, and I just use the original AC adapter."

Gameboy,37f0oh,lllluminati,3,Wed May 27 03:39:02 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume the ones on Amazon, Ebay and just about everywhere else are Chinese aftermarket. Finding OEM shells, short of taking another GBA SP apart, are probably going to be hard to find, if not impossible."
Gameboy,37f0oh,VikingFirebeard,3,Wed May 27 03:59:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only real way to do this is by finding another SP. I can vouch for the quality of Chinese shells. They feel pretty good, but not perfect."
Gameboy,37f0oh,killing_buddhas,1 point,Wed May 27 12:20:03 2015 UTC,An x-acto knife and a file go a long way to making these more tolerable.
Gameboy,37f0oh,TriwingModder,4,Wed May 27 12:29:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It's more of an issue with the quality of plastic than the molding, because  imperfections can be fixed. I'd still take an aftermarket shell over a beat up original shell."
Gameboy,37f0oh,killing_buddhas,1 point,Wed May 27 14:16:17 2015 UTC,"Dunno about that, probably you can fix a beat up shell and have a good thing. I have an old SP: with some stickers or paint the scratches/imperfections you can make it way better ;)"
Gameboy,37bu4b,rectangular_fruit,5,Tue May 26 14:00:32 2015 UTC,"I had bought a micro last year and the battery only lasted an hour or so. I thought I'd have to shell out cash for a new battery, but I just let the console run until the battery completely ran out, then charged it until it was completely done. Don't turn it on while it's charging, and don't unplug it.  That completely fixed my battery issues for my micro. It's worth a shot."

Gameboy,3781zt,tanooki-suit,2,Tue May 26 03:25:13 2015 UTC,So which way did you go with this?  101 screen and ribbon cable adapter?  I've been wanting to upgrade a white gba I got a week ago that's spotless and the no light thing just bugs me a lot.
Gameboy,3781zt,tanooki-suit,1 point,Tue May 26 02:00:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry for that late reply. Yep this was a 101 screen and a cable adapter. You just have to make sure to get the right one, as there are two models of the GBA motherboard. One has a 32-pin cable while the other is a 40-pin. Interestingly the 40-pin model doesn't require soldering for the light to work, however it will be stuck on the low setting unless you attach the wire."
Gameboy,3781zt,tanooki-suit,2,Fri May 29 07:03:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't know there was a low or high setting.  I wouldn't mind attaching a wire really, but it's more confusing trying to find a supplier of the correct 40pin adapter cable that is a trustworthy person."
Gameboy,3781zt,mysticentity,1 point,Fri May 29 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"I got all my parts for this here, and was very satisfied with my purchase.

Gameboy,3781zt,thedymtree,1 point,Fri May 29 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks, bookmarking that second link.  I'll just need to somehow dig up a 101 screen at a cheap price and then it's all there."

Gameboy,3771n8,industry-standard,2,Mon May 25 15:00:00 2015 UTC,"A DMG is quite a bit better to do it with, you can have a bigger screen and there is more room inside. You need room for batteries, at least 3000mAh worth, to get any decent run time."

Plus its cheaper, being the slightly older stuff.   You really can't go wrong with either of them though. Its a great brand.  Here's a site which also discusses the differences.http://blog.etechparts.com/2014/03/19/differences-between-osaka-6-and-osaka-7/"
Gameboy,377hz0,the_8bit_kingdom,2,Mon May 25 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"That was one of the links I found when researching this topic, it's super useful but I wasn't sure if one of them was preferable to this specific mod. All I got was people swear by the Osaka brand. I was kinda leaning towards 6 since it is less prone to air bubbles, I figured that'd be a plus since this is my first time attempting this mod."
Gameboy,377hz0,the_8bit_kingdom,3,Mon May 25 16:06:10 2015 UTC,"Go for it man. If you happen to find too many bubbles prior to curing, you can lift the light panel off and reapply a bit of loca. Sometimes that's better than settling for too many bubbles. Rubbing alcohol can clean spillover as well."
Gameboy,377hz0,Saloncinx,1 point,Mon May 25 17:30:16 2015 UTC,"I use Osaka 6. Much easier to work work because it is more viscous (thick). Gives you time to really apply the correct amount, then reseal the 2 caps on the LOCA tube, then grab the light panel and triple check there is no dust, then carefully apply..... ect.... All with out it dripping or sliding around all over :)  In terms of clarity I would assume it's going to be 100% identical. We're talking about GameBoys here, not 4 inch 1080p LCD screens for phones LOL.  EDIT: +1 for http://www.etechparts.com That's were I get mine, free shipping via FexEx and it's typically pretty quick (They're US based, not China). Order Tuesday, get Saturday, not bad for free shipping :) Also, there is only a $3 difference between the 10mL and 30 mL. So make sure you get the larger one :)"

Gameboy,3768gn,superdbop,1 point,Mon May 25 14:36:38 2015 UTC,Thanks! At first I forgot the transflective sheet and adding it helped its visibility when on without the backlight. Did yours get screen cancer too?
Gameboy,3768gn,superdbop,1 point,Mon May 25 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"No mine had a few horizontal lines missing. When I opened it up, it looked like a previous owner had already tried to fix it using a soldering iron and ended up melting some of the cable.  I can't tell in the pictures, but is your new screen brown when the backlight is off? That's the only part I don't like about mine (caused by the polarizing film.) It's minor though, since I really only play it in bed. One of these days, I might muster up enough courage to bivert it!"
Gameboy,3768gn,honkey-tonk,2,Mon May 25 18:13:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, interesting. Yes, mine is a shade of brown without the backlight on. I'm really glad it worked. It was a fun project on a $45 junker.

There are plenty of people who will (rightly) argue that we've come a long way and that a 3DS or iDevice is a huge step up from a lowly Gameboy, but that ignores its impact at the time.

This hissing is present with the oldschool GBA, the GBA SP (3.5mm only via adaptor) and the Gameboy Micro. For me, the audio improvement in the Nintendo DS, the successor device, is more relevant than the screenupgrade when compared to the AGS-101.   Unfortunately I have never read about a sound mod for any of the GBA. There seem to be some for the GBC, but nothing for the advance."
Gameboy,36vaxr,jamesjoyce1882,2,Fri May 22 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much what I gathered as well. There's a sound mod for the GB and that's about it. I found that not having my earbuds all the way in reduced the distorted sound, so I'll settle with that for now"

Do I think they are going to go to the trouble to do something like that? Probably not.   And yes, you are again correct regarding C and the LR35902; I first started farting around on the gameboy using GBDK.   I'm (perhaps overly) critical of 'game' developers these days.

Very good graphics and music. Fun and original gameplay. This is the first kirby game to feature his animal friends. Honorable mentions: Link's Awakening, Kid Dracula, Pokemon R/B/Y, FF adventure, many many others  GBC= Pokemon Gold/ Silver. This is where the franchise really hit the high water mark in terms of story, having both worlds, and a solid addition of new Pokemon. Honorable mention: Shantae, Oracle of seasons/ages (really could be number one), Harvest moon, DWIII, Wario3, Others...  GBA=Advance Wars. The second one is the better game, but I'm giving it to the first because it really brought some fun new things to tactical RPGs. The second perfected it, but the the first one was, well, first.

Gameboy,36q3hj,albertosramires,5,Thu May 21 12:12:22 2015 UTC,"As I recently wrote a gameboy emulator the idea struck me as well, however I see several problems:   The cpu is only 16 MHz while the gameboy is 4.2 MHz (and does not use the same instruction set). This means that you will almost certainly need to write a recompiler, hard, but possible (however performance may still be shaky). The arduboy only has 32 KB memory. This is actually the same amount as the gameboy, however this leaves you no room for a runtime (which you will need to handle drawing and such). This can maybe be worked around by exploiting certain things on the gameboy platform, but you will certainly lose compatibility. This also means no ROMs > 16 kB. The screen appears to be black/white only, the gameboy actually supports 4 shades of black/white so you will lose color depth (some dithering may make things better, but still).   Edit: I just realized the GB actually has 64k memory, which probably make this totally impossible."

It's just better designed than every other other port of the original title, many of which were programmed at gunpoint by war orphans who had never seen the original arcade game.   Compare the moves to execute the elbow punch: here, it's just a matter of turning your back to your enemy, waiting for them to draw close, then hitting the attack button, and listening to their ribs snap.  On the 7800: Push up and diagonal to be dropkicked in the skull for trying to elbow punch any of an army of your color palette swapped clones.   On the Master System: Still looking. Is it even in this game?  On the NES: Gain experience to unlock the elbow by grinding levels...in a linear path, only marching forward. Oh, and your enemies don't re-appear when killed. And how you beat them determines how much exp you win. Happy button mashing! If you thought Final Fight was repetitive, you haven't seen anything."

So before I triple-check my connections and whatnot, I want to make sure I'm at least using a correct diagram. Sure, there are different ways to do it, but I find it odd that those 2 diagrams, which are on the same image file, do not agree with each other.

Gameboy,36eva1,_imjosh,1 point,Wed May 20 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"I have yet to bivert a pocket, so I'm not sure if its harder or not. I would imagine it would be since the solder points are smaller."
Gameboy,36eva1,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Wed May 20 02:39:28 2015 UTC,I meant just backlight in general. I just watched a video of it and it actually looks easier since you can pull the whole screen out.  I'm a soldering ninja so the bivert chip install doesn't scare me as much.
Gameboy,36eva1,_imjosh,1 point,Wed May 20 02:46:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry. I mis-read. Well, I'm sure the levels of difficulty of modding each individual GB model are subjective to each modder, but in my opinion, yes,  back-light modding the game boy pocket is easier than the original DMG.  Its easier because like you said, the LCD is removable, assisting in the removal of the back polarizer. However, this LCD comes with the extra hurdle of 2 ribbon cables to carefully avoid which can potentially destroy the functionality of the LCD screen.  I'd recommend some practice on a broken GBP for those new to it. You'll be glad you did.   That aside though, these things are hit or miss as the difficulty of removal of the rear polarizer can come down to how the unit was kept, cared for, temperatures it was stored in, etc."
Gameboy,36eva1,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Wed May 20 03:35:58 2015 UTC,"Ugh, the first pocket screen I tried to backlight was SUPER sticky.

Gameboy,36eva1,alanbbent,1 point,Wed May 20 04:56:14 2015 UTC,I hear ya. Those problem ones are exhausting and frustrating. I remember my first trouble dmg like a year and a half ago. I must have spent like 4 hours on that sob cause of that and some other stuff was messed up that I eventually fixed.   Big pain in the ass. haha
Gameboy,36eva1,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Wed May 20 06:57:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say backlighting a pocket is about the same difficulty. Maybe slightly trickier, since there's not as much extra space inside the pocket. It's neat to be able to remove the screen completely from the pcb, but I wouldn't say it's any easier to peel the reflective layer off.   Biverting is definitely Hard Mode, since there's some extra grounding to be done on the chip itself (if those diagrams are correct) and the solder points on the pcb are smaller. The dmg ones are big and already covered with solder. I've been having a tough time getting solder to stick to the pocket pcb with my cheapo soldering iron. Definitely give it a shot, it's a good learning experience, and it brings back some of the excitement of backlighting a dmg for the first time.  Also, maybe it's just me, but it seems like a backlight with a resistor doesn't wash out the pocket screen as badly as on the dmg. Maybe that's why there's not much talk about it on the interwebs."
Gameboy,36eva1,alanbbent,1 point,Wed May 20 02:59:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's any easier to peel the reflective layer off.   that was the main thing I was worried would possibly be much harder   since there's some extra grounding to be done on the chip itself (if those diagrams are correct)    You're actually supposed to do that on the DMG mod as well per the the inverter chip's datasheet.  A lot of people find that it works fine w/o doing it though. If you want to do it by the book you should ground all the unused outputs but YMMV.   I've been having a tough time getting solder to stick to the pocket pcb with my cheapo soldering iron.   are you using flux? it makes soldering 1000x easier.   but it seems like a backlight with a resistor doesn't wash out the pocket screen as badly as on the dmg.    the pocket screen is vastly superior to the dmg's so that makes sense   Maybe that's why there's not much talk about it on the interwebs.   I don't follow?  The pocket seems to be a lot less popular for some reason, or am I imagining that? If anything the fuzzy DMG screen is nearly unplayable compared to the Pocket until you backlight it so in that way there's less ""need"" to backlight a Pocket.    If I ever get around to doing a bivert mod on the Pocket I'll be sure to make a video so there'll at least be one available on youtube."
Gameboy,36eva1,_imjosh,1 point,Wed May 20 03:15:26 2015 UTC,"You're actually supposed to do that on the DMG mod as well per the the inverter chip's datasheet.   Oh. TIL. I've just been insulating them. Now I'll feel guilty if I don't do that in the future.   are you using flux?   Yep, but maybe I need more.   The pocket seems to be a lot less popular for some reason   This is true. I guess it's not a shocker that there's not as much info. I guess it just seems (to me) like it would be SO COOL to have a biverted, backlit GBP that I expected more online interest. I understand that the DMG has more retro appeal, but shoot, pockets need more love. Oh well.  Thanks for your insights!"

When I first booted her up i was disappointed to see a dreaded horizontal line and some vertical lines on the side of the display, however, after about 15 minutes of playing, the horizontal line vanished! I'm really happy about that, since I've heard those are next to impossible to fix compared to the vertical ones. So my questions are:  1.Do any of you know what would have caused the screen to slightly fix itself like that  ? 2.If I wanted to fix the few vertical lines on the sides, what kind of soldering iron , tips, and solder would be best for this sort of job?"
Gameboy,36belh,industry-standard,3,Mon May 18 00:40:18 2015 UTC,"Horizontal / Vertical lines are usually due to the poor electrical connection in the ribbon cable between the PCB and the LCD matrix.  Horizontal lines, to my knowledge, are near impossible to fix. I would consider it good fortune that yours went away, but expect it to return later, and perhaps permanently.   Vertical lines also are prone to appear / disappear, but they are pretty easy to fix. Basically, you want to use a soldering iron to reflow the existing solder connecting the ribbon cable to the LCD. You can do this by very lightly, quickly running your soldering iron over the cable. I would use a pretty low wattage iron, maybe a 15W or 30W iron (your basic firestarter model). Make sure you take off the sticky foam from the ribbon cable first though. You likely will not even have to make contact with the cable; I've repaired many DMG vertical lines just 'waving' the iron VERY close to the ribbon, and slowly pulling it away to let the reflow solder harden. The easiest way to confirm LCD operation is to just do this with the screen on.   Good luck and have fun!"

Reference this picture for the following instructions:   unscrew the two screws circled in red pry the screen up at the access point circled in blue the ribbon cable is located on the underside of the screen in the area circled in yellow.   Reference this picture for the following:   the ribbon cable is the white portion circled in red eyeball the spot on the white area where the horizontal lines are, and run the soldering iron around that area until you see the lines flicker.   be careful when you're handling the screen, as the solder points circled in yellow have a tendency to break if you're too rough, and you'll have to resolder them"
Gameboy,36belh,robert812003,1 point,Fri May 22 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a loose connection on the right ribbon may have reestablished itself with a bit of juice and a good bump or shake while you were playing. That doesn't sound like a reliable fix though as industry-standard mentioned, you might put it down after a gaming session and find that the impact was enough to loosen the connector again.  As for the vertical lines, no solder or soldering needed, but you do need an iron. Around 300-325 degrees is what I heard the sweet spot is to loosen the solder beneath the brown ribbon directly below the screen (you won't see the solder points, they are beneath the ribbon and it is not removable) without beginning to melt the plastic of the brown ribbon cable. Have the gameboy on, then you move the soldering iron around lightly on the cable or even slightly above it without making contact, directly beneath the problem lines for 3-4 seconds at a time tops. Give it a few seconds to solidify and see if the lines are still present. Repeat as many times as needed.   I've heard of people having luck using a heat gun and even a blow dryer on one occasion, all with luck and it solved the issue. I do not suggest you do this though as you can easily overheat the surrounding components into non-functionality."
Gameboy,36belh,robert812003,1 point,Mon May 18 13:38:08 2015 UTC,"Time to get myself an iron then, thanks or taking your time to explain the prcoess to me."
Gameboy,36belh,letsfolding,1 point,Wed May 20 17:15:00 2015 UTC,Absolutely =)  I actually did this myself yesterday as I was missing 15-20 lines on each side of my screen. It took a little longer than I thought and I think I heated the lines waaaay too long since now the lines appear and disappear if I press down on the cable even lightly. I think I caused the solder to run all over the place under that damned ribbon. I might try to soften it again and hold down with a pencil eraser so solder solidifies on the connections rather than being pulled away and solidifying on the ribbon alone.  (The videos on youtube make it seem soo easy to get the connection back but mine took much longer and a lot more heat before I began to start seeing any of the dead lines shifting in and out again.)  Less is more in this case. Little by little without overdoing it and you'll be golden~

It's a pretty sizeable difference between the frontlit screen. And yeah, the easiest way is to take it from an ags-101. Hopefully you can find a broken one because it's a shame to tear apart a perfectly good SP, because all you need is the screen to be in good condition."

Gameboy,367v3q,Vaeryn,1 point,Sun May 17 00:37:57 2015 UTC,"No2 is unfortunately the norm. Sound is really the GBA's Achilles' Heel, the console could have been so much better with a decent sound chip and decent audio output quality. This hissing is present with the oldschool GBA, the GBA SP (3.5mm only via adaptor) and the Gameboy Micro.  For me, the audio improvement in the Nintendo DS, the successor device, is more relevant than the screenupgrade when compared to the AGS-101."
Gameboy,367v3q,jamesjoyce1882,1 point,Sun May 17 02:05:48 2015 UTC,"You think you can get a video of the first problem? It might just be the GBA being the GBa, but you never know."
Gameboy,367v3q,tsukinousagii,1 point,Sun May 17 04:12:53 2015 UTC,"For #1, people usually call it interlacing, but it's not really an interlace because all lines are indeed drawn per frame. It's just that the rows alternate between ""normal"" and ""slightly darker"" in order to improve the LCD response rate. I think the GBA and AGS-001 are the most noticeable with these flickering lines. The screens in the GBM, DS line, and the AGS-101 are much better in that respect and on those devices I don't see it: but that doesn't mean it's not there, some people are sensitive to that.  Number 2 is definitely legit. I wish I knew how to snuff it out. On old GB/GBP/GBCs, people would tap the audio signal from the volume dial to get a cleaner signal. I've never heard of anyone doing the same to GBAs. I suspect with how tightly integrated everything is, that by the time the audio signal leaves the DAC, it's already kinda hummy. If audio is a big concern, I would lean more towards a DS (finally stereo sound without headphones!) for GBA games and a GBC with the pro audio mod."

Gameboy,35z4oo,ckoatonnom,2,Thu May 14 18:56:44 2015 UTC,I was just thinking this the other day .The gba had the worst/darkest screen out of all the gameboys IMO. Maybe Nintendo did it on purpose to make more people buy the SPs when they first came out.
Gameboy,35z4oo,tanooki-suit,2,Thu May 14 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"It was them being cheap, they're always being cheap.  That's why you get revisions.  They're not stupid and know what they're doing wrong, but they always to the harm of the system will stay under a set budget.  Wii with the non-accurate motion tracking until the plus module and then controller.  GBA to the SP to then the SP 'Brighter' with the modern backlight.  GB forever being not in color for the longest time against color systems.  WiiU being grossly underpowered so they could do the tablet.  Nintendo is all about cheap and an angle for better or worse."

Gameboy,361008,AndonisLP,4,Fri May 15 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"Don't buy the $100 screen kit on eBay. If you are patient, you can pick up a used AGS-101 in bad cosmetic condition for around $40. You can remove the screen from that and use it for the mod.   I just did the mod about a month ago. It's a tedious process. Grinding down the plastic on the front piece of plastic with a craft knife took awhile. Keep in mind you will need to buy a few other things for the mod:  Soldering iron Ribbon adapter (preferably the one with a brightness switch so you aren't stuck on the lower setting) Tri-wing screwdriver Philips 00 screwdriver Craft knife or dremel Replacement lens (glass is optional - IMO it's a nice finishing touch) 3MM double sided tape (to attach the new lens)  It's a fun weekend project that will take you a few hours. If you want the pleasure of modding the system yourself, go for it! If you don't have the time or patience to make it, I would recommend buying a nice condition modded console on eBay. If you wait, you can probably get one for around $100-120. Try to find one with a brightness switch if you go this route."

Gameboy,35tr51,swrrga,1 point,Wed May 13 14:01:52 2015 UTC,Fold a bit of a clean t-shirt over a credit card and wet it with rubbing alcohol. It slides in easily and won't leave any lint behind.
Gameboy,35tr51,killing_buddhas,1 point,Wed May 13 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"Get a triwing screwdriver to take them apart.  Make sure you don't overtorque the screw when you put the games back together!  Then use 2-26 to clean the contacts, prevent corrosion, and improve electrical connection.  It's only $3 if you buy it at Home Depot.  Yes, alcohol works.  It's just that this is exactly what 2-26 is made for.  edit:  If you wanna go that route, search for ""anhydrous isopropyl alcohol"" to find 100% isopropyl alcohol.  It's better than a dilution.  Also for a source: I used to fix arcade games for a living, and I had a collection of 290 NES games."
Gameboy,35tr51,BadGrammarSucks,0,Wed May 13 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"Seems that 91% rubbing alcohol is the way to go, try not to leave any fibers from the cotton swab on the contacts as they can cause a short.  If it's not really dirty but you'd like to go over it routinely to prevent build-up, distilled water on a swab works well. The distilled water leaves no mineral impurities on the contacts or electrical components, the way normal water would."

I had a bunch of people asking to buy them, so I've been doing a ton of work on the casing and features of the Macro, which I've been putting up on the site and the facebook page (facebook.com/gbmacro)  It'd be difficult to use some sort of limited edition case, since you have to cut it and fill it with bondo. But if you don't care about looks you could just remove the top half and leave it like that."
Gameboy,35roll,JohnSmith7621,2,Sun May 24 22:48:34 2015 UTC,I'm trying to find the exact same one  I started taking it apart and you need a tri song screwdriver which is like 2.50 on Amazon. I also got an R4 and an ezflash. I think you'd be fine with the ezflash 4 but I got the 3 in 1
Gameboy,35roll,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Wed May 13 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"I've been interested in this as well. From what I can tell, you only need a tri-wing screwdriver. As for flash carts, the EZ flash IV is the best for the GBA and I've been using a R4i for a while for my 3DS and it's great. Not sure if you need a different one for the DSi though.   I'd use a DSi if I were you. It's more sleek and comes in matte plastic which is nice.   I don't know how good the screen is though. It's a touch screen and I think it might be front lit. Not positive though."
Gameboy,35roll,the_8bit_kingdom,3,Wed May 13 01:02:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think a DSi is possible tho because the DSi doesn't have a GBA slot, unless you get a DS flashcart that supports GBA games and plays only on the bottom screen.  for me it comes down to:   Original DS will have a flush design, the GBA cart will fit all the way The DS Lite's smaller form factor"
Gameboy,35roll,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Wed May 13 01:47:00 2015 UTC,Does the DSi not have a GBA slot? Maybe I was thinking of the DS lite. I can't keep them straight anymore
Gameboy,35roll,nomnaut,5,Wed May 13 01:56:06 2015 UTC,The GBA cart slot went away after the ds lite. The ds lite was the last nintendo handheld with a gba cartridge slot.

Gameboy,35mojw,Elysiom,2,Mon May 11 19:36:19 2015 UTC,$50 in that state. $10 more for internal prosound and another $10 for a bivert chip installed.
Gameboy,35mojw,baby_shoo-shoo,-1,Mon May 11 20:42:01 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I usually see unmoded DMGs selling for the ~$40 range. A backlit one would add more than a $10 value to that IMO."
Gameboy,35mojw,Zarek09,3,Tue May 12 13:08:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure who would pay $40 for a gray DMG, unless it was absolutely sterling mint condition, but I'm certainly not one of them."
Gameboy,35mojw,baby_shoo-shoo,2,Tue May 12 21:30:29 2015 UTC,"True enough, I've been picking up the occasional DMG at $15-$20 or so, sometimes cheaper. There are tons of them in the wild.  At $40 it had better be completely original and in pristine condition (basically opened up and almost immediately put on a shelf and forgotten). Finding one like this is not at all common.   Most at the $30-$40 price range are simply overpriced worn & torn DMGs by people who don't bother with realistic prices because they don't care... I don't get how they make money."
Gameboy,35mojw,robert812003,1 point,Wed May 13 15:12:53 2015 UTC,"I'd happily part with ~$100 for a pristine backlit Japanese DMG. Try adding the inverter. It's a cheap, easy mod that makes a huge difference."
Gameboy,35mojw,letsfolding,0,Mon May 11 22:37:02 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about a bivert chip? You can easily invert by just rotating the polarization film.  The Biversion has me worried, I don't want to destroy a motherboard - you have to cut a trace to install it."
Gameboy,35mojw,Northwait,1 point,Tue May 12 00:01:37 2015 UTC,"Well if you're feeling ambitious, you can always design an adapter that plugs between the board and the LCD's cable that includes the an inverter chip and altered wiring. Maybe even an on-board DPDT slider to alternate between single and double inversion depending on whether you want to sell a dark border or light border version."
Gameboy,35mojw,letsfolding,1 point,Tue May 12 00:56:07 2015 UTC,"The 'bivert' mod uses an inverter chip. The chip inverts the video drive to the LCD, then you restore the video by inverting again using rotated polarizing film. Double inversion, hence 'bivert'. Sounds dumb but it looks amazing.  Fitting the inverter is easier than peeling the reflective strip off the LCD. If you can use a soldering iron you're laughing."
Gameboy,35mojw,onefish2,1 point,Tue May 12 02:03:42 2015 UTC,I'll give it a shot - I've got an extra DMG CPU 06 board that I can use as the sacrificial lamb.  In about a week or so I'll have a few Japanese DMGs ready for sale with just the regular white non inverted backlit LCD.  One is a DMG CPU 06 and the other is an 03  I want to put about an hour on each of them to make sure they are good to go for the next owner.

Gameboy,35mojw,LosAtomsk,1 point,Tue May 12 04:06:57 2015 UTC,"If you start selling these I will buy one, as long as it is a good price."
Gameboy,35mojw,LosAtomsk,1 point,Fri May 15 16:20:10 2015 UTC,"I'm actually trying the same thing as you and considering going legit.  Setting the price has been difficult for me as well, but here's my experience thus far (one month and about 8 sold units in):   There's too much original, non-refurbished, second-hand DMG-01's out there, that sell on the cheap (€ 5 to € 15), disregarding the condition. The refurbishment process is too lengthy and costly to leave a margin in the sales price. My refurb process is almost like yours:   Test Take everything apart and separate washable components (shell + buttons + rubber pads) Handwash washable components with hot water, second rinse with vinegar + detergent + hot water, last rinse with detergent and hot water. I use a sponge, nail brush and tooth brush. The vinegar doesn't affect the plastic or ink, but is great at removing musty attic smells. Clean PCB's with rubbing alcohol and q-tips (DMG display, connection port, headphone port, DC port + any grime + speaker) Check/clean battery contacts with vinegar, mostly replace with aftermarket contacts, because they're often bent out of shape Test display PCB for vertical lines and fix if need be, test speaker/audio, test buttons Check rubber pads, especially D-pad for wear-and-tear and replace if need be Retr0bright (homebrew'ish variant) shell ONLY if shell is NOT too yellow. Yellow'ed cases are discarded for spraypaint jobs.  Reassamble Replace lens cover with aftermarket version. Took me a few months to find a cheap, but stable, quality provider that doesn't sell lens covers that scratch easily.  For details, see: http://www.retro-grade.net/daskal_tutorial/cleaning-gameboy/ I usually try to buy and treat batches by 5 units. This takes an entire evening (about 5'ish hours, depending on the state), not including the Retrobright process, which usually takes about 1 hour to apply and 4 hours of waiting.     This will return a fully, as-OEM-possible refurbished unit.   Seeing as how most second-hand units are sold online, the buyer can never really check the condition of the Gameboy. Moreover, the condition of the Gameboy almost always has at least one flaw: scratched lens cover, grime in the grooves of the back/battery cover/speaker, missing battery/link port cover, dust underneath the lens cover, broken speaker or torn D-pad rubber pad and vertical lines in the display. Most buyers are not always aware of these common defects. Hell, most sellers aren't even aware.  This results in a fairly low demand for refurbished units (to my dismay). Don't misunderstand, if you find the right groups (here on reddit or closed trading groups on Facebook), you will and can sell these, but there's little interest as soon as you go over € 50 as asking price. My best results was selling at € 55 - € 65 wíth game. - Adding a crap game is a failed strategy from my experience and in hindsight, it's only natural. I'm not entirely interested in selling refurbished units as-is, but want to offer a game. My perspective is to tap into nostalgia, not just a novelty product. From that perspective, why buy a Gameboy if you do not have the game to play it? A crappy, little known junk game does not entice your potential customer. - In my experience, enticing and increasing added value to a refurbished Gameboy is getting higher quality, known games. The advantage: There's tons of cheap, second-hand Tetris/SML games out there. Everyone knows those games. These games will enable your customers. Downside: you'll need to factor in the cost price and add a margin. Making the package deal even more expensive. I also tried adding a custom made, cute, protective cloth sleeve  (cost me € 6) but it didn't affect interest.   Bottom line: Per unit sold, my margin is about € 10 to € 14 MAX, per unit EXCLUDING work hours as a cost, seeing as I'm just doing this for fun. That is not good enough if I would ever do this more seriously. Also take in account that the interest wanes as soon as you try to push the price or try to add product value, because everyone's in this for getting cheap electronics from the past. Again, don't forget that I've only sold 8 units in the past month, so I'm only sharing how things went for me. However, I do feel I've experimented enough. Oh, last but not least: shipping will also cost you, not just the shipping, but the shipping materials as well (boxes, bubble wrap, those rubbery thingemajiggers to fill a box, tape, shipping labels).   BUT, modding Gameboys, that's where the added values lies. A good backlit kit (I recommend ASM Retro, Kitsch Bent or Hand Held Legend), a custom color, backlit buttons... That's where I'm going to experiment next. Thinking about themes, like a matte, black, custom color buttons/lens cover and backlit screen + Batman games for a Batman'ish theme.  Another crowd that could be interesting (as mentioned here earlier), is the chiptune crowd, but I have zero experience there.   Find me at retro-grade.net if you have any more questions. Not to shamelessly promote, but I'll be honest: This little hobby of mine has gotten out of hand and I think we both have the same idea. Don't know about you, but I just can't shake and keep thinking about trying to find the right thing to do. Would love to bounce off ideas or share experiences.  Ian"
Gameboy,35mojw,the_8bit_kingdom,2,Sat May 16 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"This is some great info and kind of what I'm seeing out there as well. I'm using 4 white LED ASM retro kits and after the restoration process I would be happy selling it for $70 US shipped + random game or two. I say random game because I have acquired quite a few carts from the DMGs I have purchased... usually the seller includes a few carts with said ""broken"" DMG. There isn't much room for profit here but maybe just the satisfaction of resurrecting these old battle axes."
Gameboy,35jc4q,Cyime,4,Sun May 10 22:54:24 2015 UTC,Do you have a Gamecube with the Game Boy Player? How does it compare in the video and audio?
Gameboy,35jc4q,Northwait,3,Mon May 11 02:16:59 2015 UTC,The Gameboy player is better in my opinion it has a few more advantages like better picture.   The best picture you can get out of the N64 without modding it is S-Video and RGB if you mod it and the N64's native resolution is 240p while in theory the GameCube can do 480p with component.  Sound wise I couldn't tell you the difference both the Wide-Boy and the Gameboy player just use Gameboy hardware with no emulation or clone system.
Gameboy,35jc4q,Northwait,2,Mon May 11 14:18:13 2015 UTC,"GBC owner here. The N64 looks worse than the small screen, especially when the GBC is well-lit. The sound seems pretty close, though."
Gameboy,35jc4q,robert812003,3,Mon May 11 04:51:23 2015 UTC,The picture looks brighter on my TV. I run my N64 with S-Video via the XRGB mini at 1080p. I might test it with scanlines to see if it looks any better since I don't own a CRT.  I wouldn't recommend this over Gameboy player or a Back-lit GBC.

Gameboy,35hga5,truename_b4,5,Sun May 10 12:05:40 2015 UTC,"For me, I enjoy the minimalist purity of the gameplay. When the DMG does a platformer, it's stripped of distractions, and boiled down to the essentials of the genre. It will live or die based purely on your enjoyment of the actual mechanics themselves.   Some of the best include  -  MegaMan IV. Better than the NES original. The levels are knocked down to Megaman 2 length, which does wonders for pacing. Slowdown, while probably unintentional, also turns it more strategic - there's no excuse for taking most hits anymore. And the upgrade system allows you to set your own difficulty.   Kid Dracula. Imagine if Megaman could shoot upwards? Add a pinch of Castlevania. I'm really not doing it justice, but there are some games which are just fun, without really bringing anything new to the table.  WarioLand 2. Also playable on the Gameboy Color, this game encourages you to hurt Wario in order to fully explore some of the best level design in any console game.  There are many more, if you're still curious?"
Gameboy,35hga5,FallingSnowAngel,3,Sun May 10 14:22:17 2015 UTC,the whole wariolad series is a balst I love Warioland 3 but it's GBc only and will not play on older systems.

This game plays more like a fan hack, rather than an officially licensed product, but in this case, that's actually a good thing. It means there's a surprisingly solid game engine underneath the lazy cash grab.  Prehistoric Man. If you're ever curious about the hardware's limits, this game will show you what it can do in the hands of a master programmer. Minus the 4 shades palette limit and lower resolution, this could easily pass for a 16 bit title."

Gameboy,35hga5,Beefive,3,Sun May 10 16:21:45 2015 UTC,"I always suggest the Kirby series to new GameBoy owners.   When I bought Kirby's Dream Land  (recently - no nostalgia goggles here) I ended up beating it in one sitting. I mean, you have to beat it in one sitting because there's no save or password system, but I wanted to.  I've replayed it several times since then and its still very fun. It's simple, beautiful (for a GameBoy game), easy without being boring (lololo/lalala and DeDeDe can be kinda tough) and it has some truly classic songs that have come to define Kirby.    It's important to remember that Kirby's Dream Land is the very first Kirby game so things aren't exactly what you may expect as a fan. Kirby doesn't have his copy ability yet, though there are a few power ups in the game. He can still float and inhale/spit out enemies but he doesn't get an army of abilities until later games. The only real downside is the length (30-40 minutes if you know what you're doing) but I think the quality of the levels is high enough to justify the short length, and it's hard to criticize a handheld game with no save feature for being short.   Kirby's Dream Land 2 is everything you'd expect from a modern Kirby game. It's longer, has a save system, has tons of cool abilities, a few animal companions, and is a more modern-feeling game.   If you have a GBA then Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land is the one to get. It's an enhanced remake of Kirby's first console game, Kirby's Adventure for the NES. While the original is a classic, the remake improves upon it in almost every way. It features new graphics and sound, slightly lowered difficulty, a few new mini games, and a small multiplayer mode. This is one of the more challenging and lengthy handheld Kirby games so you'll definitely get your money's worth.   I could go on, but the majority of Kirby games are inexpensive, creative, charming games so it's hard to go wrong. Unless you need your platformers to be tough as nails or really long I strongly recommend Kirby."
Gameboy,35hga5,ChipOTron,1 point,Sun May 10 18:16:35 2015 UTC,"Kirby's Dream Land 2 is excellent and still holds up quite nicely.   I missed out on Kirby's Dream Land (1) the first time around and recently picked it up, but was less impressed with it - the lack of any save system and the swallowing powers was kind of a downer. I've played it to about the 20 minute mark multiple times but never really felt the urge to keep going.  Kirby's Pinball is surprisingly fun, though a bit frustrating."
Gameboy,35hga5,swrrga,3,Mon May 11 09:00:19 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to say thanks folks for the enthusiastic, welcoming, and very helpful comments.  Glad I checked into the /r/gameboy community!"
Gameboy,35hga5,TheGoodly,2,Sun May 10 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"I will never stop recommending Wario Land 3. If you want a game that's compelling not because it's a twist on Mega Man or Castlevania but something COMPLETELY different yet still a platformer, play it."
Gameboy,35hga5,curtisagain,2,Sun May 10 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"If you go the GBA route, definitely get rayman advance. The port is some of the most beautiful pixel art I've seen on the console and the game is literally a couple of dollars. Nightmare in dreamland is fantastic. The gameboy has some stripped down classics for fractions of the home console price (Duck Tales 2 will run you about 20 dollars). Pocket Bomberman is quite possibly my favorite game for sentimental reasons and brings a tear to my eye when I play it."
Gameboy,35hga5,the_8bit_kingdom,1 point,Sun May 10 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"I find myself coming back to the tried and true classic series  Iike Mario, megaman, castlevania, ninja gaiden, contra, ghosts & goblins, wario, Kirby, bonk, duck tales, adventure island, etc.   But I also favor the GB exclusive games like shantae and trip world, or lesser known games like the adventures of Mary Kate and Ashleys (actually pretty entertaining yet simple puzzle / platformers).  There's so many good platformers for the game boy family. Are there compelling reasons to play GB platformers? As many as there are to play any other retro games if not more, being portable and all."
Gameboy,35hga5,Cyime,1 point,Sun May 10 14:53:45 2015 UTC,I would recommend Trip World it's a really fun if not slightly easy game from Sunsoft.  It has amazing graphics and music for Gameboy by the only downside is its very rare.
Gameboy,35hga5,ShikiRyumaho,1 point,Sun May 10 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"Bit Managers made a lot of good license games, but my favorite gotta be Asterix and Obelix. Never heard of them? Doesn't matter. It's on the GB and GBC and I recommend the GBC version since it adds a password save system. The soundtrack is superb.  Also, Hammerin' Harry: Ghost Building Factory. But that shit is expensive, at least the PAL release.  You might want to take a look into racketboy's list of hidden gems.  I think there is still value in a lot of GB games, since I love the simplicity and the GB soundchip. Well and ofcourse the nostalgia!"
Gameboy,35hga5,LonelyCannibal,1 point,Sun May 10 18:29:26 2015 UTC,"The Mario Land series is classic.  The first one has some of the best music on Gameboy, and the second is Wario's first appearance."

Gameboy,35fyg8,TheManWithoutBeer,8,Sat May 9 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"Get a GB BOY COLOR from AliExpress.com. It is a Chinese clone of the original Gameboy Color, except it has a bright backlit screen, and some units even come with 50 or 100 games built in. They cost around $25 or so, and are one of my favorite purchases of the past year.   Combine that with the EverDrive for Gameboy, which lets you load every Gameboy game ever made on a single SD card, and play whichever one you want by choosing it from a menu.  Some people have said the audio sounds slightly different than the original Gameboy, but it sounds fine in the games I have played. The backlit screen makes all the difference -- the dim unlit screens really ruled out the original Gameboy, Gameboy Color, and Gameboy Advance for me, and I don't like the form factor of the GBA Advance 101."
Gameboy,35fyg8,mr_arkadin,1 point,Sun May 10 04:30:14 2015 UTC,"Link? I searched aliexpress but couldn't find the one you're talking about. Sounds nice though! I'm definitely interested. EDIT: nevermind, I'm retarded, I think I found it: http://m.aliexpress.com/item/1566759257.html"
Gameboy,35fyg8,RealDiels,2,Wed May 13 02:17:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, that looks like it -- they have a clear blue, a clear green, and a few solid color models on there as well. For $27, definitely a great value.   Mine didn't come with any games built-in (nor did it claim to), so I can't speak to the quality of the games these models claim to feature. I would consider them purely a bonus feature rather than a deal-breaker when buying one of these, to avoid being disappointed. The GB Boy itself will play your original gameboy cartridges and the everdrive perfectly, with that snazzy screen -- that's what makes it a good deal at $27."
Gameboy,35fyg8,mr_arkadin,1 point,Wed May 13 04:15:54 2015 UTC,How are the buttons? They look kind of cheap so I was just wondering if they felt right or not.
Gameboy,35fyg8,RealDiels,2,Wed May 13 12:16:13 2015 UTC,"They are not as good as an original Nintendo d-pad or a/b button, but they are still usable. For the money, this is a great little device, so the buttons are one of those things where I felt they could have been better."
Gameboy,35fyg8,mr_arkadin,15,Wed May 13 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"Game Boy Micro, since its so tiny it can fit in any pocket. It'll be easier to hide if need be. ;-)"
Gameboy,35fyg8,the_8bit_kingdom,9,Sun May 10 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"The ""best"" is probably a GBA SP AGS-101 in my opinion at least. They'll play Gameboy, Gameboy color, and Gameboy Advance games, plus it has a nice backlit screen which no other Gameboy except the Micro can say. Another option would be a Gameboy Micro, or a DS lite. The Micro only plays GBA games, but is super small and can fit in your pocket really easily. The DS Lite is bigger, but can play GBA games as well as DS games. The DS has a great library as well, so that's something to think about.   As for RPGs, the Harry Potter ones are pretty good, there's fire emblem of course, Golden Sun, and Mother 3 which you can buy a fan translated GBA version of on Etsy or somewhere."
Gameboy,35fyg8,TheOswaldo,4,Sun May 10 00:39:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would suggest a DS Lite, they're just as expensive as gba sp nowadays and I think the ds had a lot more RPGs to choose from. The ds lite can also play gba games.  Some ds flash carts even support gba roms which gives you access to basically every game on both ds, gba, and I believe even gameboy and gameboy color games.   You should be able to get a DS Lite + flash cart for under 100."
Gameboy,35fyg8,Boomkin1337,4,Sun May 10 04:51:57 2015 UTC,"Micro for the size, SP for the backwards compatibility."
Gameboy,35fyg8,the_fella,3,Sun May 10 07:32:30 2015 UTC,"I like the GBC. Pokemon Blue is one of my favorites. If you like RPGs, I recommend Harvest Moon (the N64 version is also quite good)."
Gameboy,35fyg8,bigted41,2,Mon May 11 00:22:51 2015 UTC,"i would suggest the SP also, as far as other RPGs to play, i definitely recommend Dragon Warrior III for GBC"

Gameboy,35fyg8,xXLukeDaDukeXx,2,Sun May 10 01:06:28 2015 UTC,You should get the Golden Sun series. It's an amazing rpg. You can transfer data from the first Golden Sun to the second Golden Sun
Gameboy,35fyg8,Skyline969,2,Mon May 11 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm enjoying my modded AGB-001 with an AGS-101 screen. Best form factor of any handheld console ever made in my personal opinion. Currently waiting for a Revo K101 as well, just to see what a hardware clone can do."
Gameboy,35fyg8,avensvvvvv,2,Tue May 12 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"SP 101 + a good GBA flash cart  + a good GB flash cart  For both I'd wait for krikzz (krikzz.com/shop.retrogate.com) to release his first GBA one and the second version of his GB's. If not, get an ez flash IV."

Gameboy,35fyg8,3583Bytes,3,Sun May 10 18:41:17 2015 UTC,The SP is nice but game boy games stick out which is a pain.  Game color is nice if you sit by a window
Gameboy,35fyg8,Helicuor,3,Sun May 10 03:58:07 2015 UTC,"SP disadvantages:   GB and GBC games stick out   GBC disadvantages:   bigger unlit screen no rechargeable batteries can't play GBA games worse controls (IMO)   I think the ""games sticking out"" thing is negligible."
Gameboy,35fyg8,kc0nlh,1 point,Sun May 10 07:23:03 2015 UTC,how are the GBC controls worse? I find the GBC has a much nicer from factor then the GBA SP. If you have big hands the GBC will just feel so much nicer in your hands and the controls are great.
Gameboy,35fyg8,Helicuor,1 point,Sun May 10 13:06:46 2015 UTC,I really enjoy the feel of the SP's buttons.
Gameboy,35fyg8,xXLukeDaDukeXx,1 point,Sun May 10 13:29:36 2015 UTC,The SP's buttons aren't spongy like the ones before it. Clicky tactile buttons make all the difference in fast paced games.
Gameboy,35fyg8,lufty,1 point,Sun May 10 17:01:31 2015 UTC,The SP buttons are too small for me and are indented.
Gameboy,35fyg8,oscillating000,1 point,Mon May 11 18:18:21 2015 UTC,Another GBA SP disadvantage: no headphone jack.
Gameboy,35fyg8,Helicuor,0,Mon May 11 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"I think the ""games sticking out"" thing is negligible.   This is true until you set down the SP just a little bit too hard one time, jar the cartridge just a bit, and lose all your progress for the last two hours because you kept forgetting to save your game."
Gameboy,35fyg8,oscillating000,5,Sun May 10 09:49:56 2015 UTC,That... That still seems like a negligible reason to get a GBC over a SP.
Gameboy,35fyg8,sushidubai,0,Sun May 10 12:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this happens way too often for my comfort. You can always mod a GBC with a backlight, but the cart connector in the SP is just not sturdy enough to handle even the most minuscule shock."
Gameboy,35fyg8,baby_shoo-shoo,2,Tue May 12 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"My personal choice is the SP. The screen is protected when not in use and gives user the option to play games retro style (sans backlight, toggle original gameboy screen ratio or gba ratio with L/R buttons) or with backlight. I would also say the micro for its size, but I think it isn't backwards compatible with the original game boy cartridges. Fire Emblem series is pretty good."

Some lose your savefile, some don't contain the whole game, some crash at some point during the game, and some work just as well as the original game. Downside = unreliable.  Some fakes can link with other games and trade pokemon, but when you link it to a ds game (palpark) the ds wil recognise the fake and delete your savegame."

Now I'm actually wondering if I really could make a wooden GB cart... I'd need harder wood..."

Gameboy,35af4s,Chiramijumaru,8,Fri May 8 13:37:09 2015 UTC,I'd have to say the micro.  The sp needs a headphone adapter and the micro is one of my favourite nintendo devices period.  It's soo cute and the screen is slightly smaller which makes the games really pop.  That being said a SP-101 with the DSi battery mod is also a great choice.
Gameboy,35af4s,robot_swagger,1 point,Fri May 8 16:02:23 2015 UTC,Shit. Gonna haveta try this battery mod. No soldering!
Gameboy,35af4s,baby_shoo-shoo,6,Fri May 8 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"SP because it plays all GB, GBC and GBA games. Micro is great too, but its more of a collector's piece now."
Gameboy,35af4s,honkey-tonk,2,Fri May 8 15:28:29 2015 UTC,Why not get both?
Gameboy,35af4s,killing_buddhas,2,Fri May 8 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"Because I work minimum wage. At least, NY minimum wage."
Gameboy,35af4s,killing_buddhas,6,Fri May 8 13:44:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely SP then. Find an AGS-101 at a pawn shop that doesn't know the difference, and love it and cherish it forever."
Gameboy,35af4s,Beral,1 point,Fri May 8 14:07:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help!
Gameboy,35af4s,curtisagain,3,Fri May 8 14:14:57 2015 UTC,"New sp shells are also super cheap on ebay, just make sure to get a tri-wing screwdriver (some auctions will have one included).   I just recently bought a used ags-101 model that was pretty beat up but looks brand new in its new shell. There are how-to videos on youtube that make the process of changing shells rather simple.  Edit - pictures of my SP in the old and new shell. http://imgur.com/gallery/SyCXZ"
Gameboy,35af4s,the_8bit_kingdom,6,Fri May 8 17:56:49 2015 UTC,"Sp then. I LOVE my micro, but it only plays GBA. If you can't get both, get the bigger one that can play everything from alleyway to tony hawks pro skater 4. Best bang for the buck and you can get an AGS 101 if you're lucky."
Gameboy,35af4s,rensch,2,Fri May 8 13:48:10 2015 UTC,"For medium large hands? Back-lit, agb model GBA is the way to go. Best form-factor, comfortability and arguably best control setup.   But between SP and Micro, the SP has the most versatility, unless you get a flashcart to properly support GB/GBC game roms, which at that point, it would come down to preference of form-factor, button setup / input preference and the lcd screen. But sometimes just making you smile simply by looking at it can be good enough. ;-)"
Gameboy,35af4s,MattsRedditAccount,2,Fri May 8 18:38:05 2015 UTC,I'd say the SP because it also plays GB and GBC.
Gameboy,35af4s,baby_shoo-shoo,2,Sat May 9 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"Hello! I own a frontlit (the most common) SP, GBM and the mythical backlit SP (AGS-101). I also own a DS lite and DSi XL.  In my personal experience, it goes:  Backlit SP > GBM > Frontlit (normal) SP > DS  The Micro was phenomenal at the time, but I find that these days I carry a bag around with me everywhere, so end up shoving it in there. I'd only have it in my pocket if I was gonna play for like a 5 minute burst, but smartphone games are great for that kind of thing now. I do, however, adore the screen, it's by far the nicest looking screen of all the consoles, the blacks are blackest and whites are whitest on a micro screen. The Micro also has the best D-Pad of any nintendo console in my opinion, feels very similar to the DS lite's.    That being said, the AGS-101 backlit SP is better. I prefer the A, B and shoulder buttons on the SP, which are bit spongey on the micro by comparison. And the screen is a much nicer size, it more than makes up for the less-sharp picture, which I can't notice unless I hold the GBM and SP alongside each other.  By trying to find a good comparison of the button responsiveness...on the Wii remote, the A button and the 1 and 2 buttons have the same tactile response as the Micro, whereas the little home and + - buttons have the same tactile response as the SP (and DSi/XL).   In a choice between the Micro and frontlit SP, there is NO competition - get the micro. The frontlit SP is so dull by comparison, though it's battery lasts ages and its absolutely fine if you're playing in the dark."
Gameboy,35af4s,dj32milli,1 point,Fri May 8 18:02:04 2015 UTC,"SP, by far.  I bought a Micro when it came out, and hated it.  The screen is just too small."
