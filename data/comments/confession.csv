""Do you want to put your ego and me over your wife and kids' feelings, trusts, and emotions?""  I started seeing it as an insult, and that's what I told the third one.    I suppose if I was single, the FWB or Red Pill game might make sense to me.  But I'm old and that part of my life is long dead.    (BTW... I am by NO means trying to say that I am good looking!  In fact, I was shocked when I was asked.  But after talking with them, they explained how they are divorced, raising kids, working full time, don't have time to date but still have desires.

confession,3e02lp,BrakemanBob,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:16 2015 UTC,Being FWB is pretty great if thats what you like. Its nice not having all the stress and effort of a relationship when you don't want one but still having good sex with somebody who is a friend. It requires a lot of communication and trust though and manipulating people into it is not only dumb but also incredibly cruel.  The Red Pill game makes sense to people who are incredibly desperate and bitter. I know the Internet hates to believe it but being interesting and nice to normal good looking women is what most want.

I'm weak toward that kind of behavior myself, not because I like to be abused or because I'm desperate - quite the opposite normally, I'm pretty solitary and happy by myself most of the time.   I'm weak toward it because I'm drawn to wounded men. I've run into these RP guys before, I didn't find out he was a terp until we'd already sparked off some heavy ozone, but if I'd never seen /theredpill I probably wouldn't have picked up on it and we'd probably still be together.   I'm not at all mystified by that man being a prick. They're not the enigmas they think they are, man. The meanness and elusiveness is a thin veneer: you can see the shadow of his heart inside him, glowering and reaching out and quailing back over and over. That's how it looks when they do that shit that they do, the abusiveness and then the affection and then the withdrawal and the straining back again. You can tell it's a huge put-on and there's something weirdly charming about it, like they're confused by their own emotions and all they really need is a reason to recognize their own passion for what it is, or break that evil spell. That's what's so compelling about it: some of us are drawn to people in pain, and all terpers are whack-ass rappers who are barely comfortable with the stage they're on. Sometimes they pull it off charmingly enough that you think you see a really strong, willful man in there, whether it's true or not, and that's compelling too. You want to coax him to stop faking and start making on the thing.   The problem with terpies is that they 'maintain frame', which is another way of saying that they will always be trapped in their acting cult, always knotted into hopeless snarls of mistrust and fear inside themselves, always haunted by the imaginary audience of other men. They will always see the gentlest attempt to untangle them as an attack. Eventually they bring forth their own prophecies, because that shit gets old.   I had the most interesting, intriguing fights with the one terper I met, and honestly was so instantly attracted that I still think about him almost two years later, though after his first revealing descent into pretty cruel negging I left the job we met in and never saw him again. He really was so hurt, and he did let that slip a couple of times. He was sensitive, touchy. He was protecting himself. In an obtuse way, that's the appeal."

They act like little shits in public and private, can't find real love, because the love most people really crave is a really difficult but rewarding process that involves a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. On both sides. And that's okay.   You become resentful, spiteful, and you devolve into a hate filled troll. You start thinking only nasty people have a chance, so you have to turn nasty too. It's a dark hole you can easily fall into.    Aw, but that's the desperation, which is totally no shame, because people shit on desperation but the people who do are the sort who have found something else to lean on. We all need something, someone, to lean on. The trick to get out of that is to redirect all that reaching need back into yourself - into knowledge, creativity, whatever it takes. You have a quality in you that you're proud of. That's not a shame, that's a lifeline. You make the absolute most of that and fuck the world and that's what builds up the framework that makes you okay with yourself. The point isn't to attract lovers, the point is to be okay with who you are to the point where you can pick and choose your lovers. They come to you, then. They see it. And even then there's no shame in rejecting them if they don't suit you.    I'm still not having much luck finding someone special but at least I'm well liked by the women currently in my life.   I understand. It's fucking hard, especially early on, but truth is that life is long, it sorts itself out, and the best thing you can do to be happy in the future is to love with your heart and not your John Hancock.

In my opinion it never meant he wasn't capable, my taste wasn't that bad, he just wasn't ready or able to deal with what he really was deep down. I was never trying to break them, whatever bastards they may have been once the wire was stripped or the shit hit the fan. That's the peril of being attracted to the injured. I let the few of them go, it was okay.  Who's innocent of a bad or stumbling approach to love? We do the best we can. Time will tell, you stick to what you really believe of men (or women). Sooner or later the right one will come along, it's all good."

confession,3e02lp,catcatherine,45,Tue Jul 21 00:12:36 2015 UTC,"If you read my post, you'll see I don't put that much effort into being friends with him. I don't invite him to do anything outside of work or integrate him into any of my other friend groups. He's a coworker I do things with occasionally. I know everything about his background, his hobbies, his past romantic relationships, his friends from out of state, his favorite sports teams, and his current emotional state because he tells me everything about his day to day life - yet he knows literally nothing about me. He couldn't tell me my favorite food, my favorite color, what genre of movies I like, what I majored in in college. Because I don't volunteer that information.   It doesn't take that much effort to be aloof towards him, I'm naturally aloof towards everyone. He's just the first person I've ever met who seems to be actively trying to counter my aloof personality in an attempt to develop a FWB relationship, because he thinks he'll eventually ""break through my shell"" and get a shot sexually, being the heap big playa that he considers himself to be. What he doesn't realize is that I'm not just testing his friendship to see if he's someone worth bedding. I'm not being coy and I'm not leading the chase. I just only give half a damn about the relationship.  It is a game, in that I'm meta-aware of what is going on, but it's not a game, because for it to be a game, there has to be some kind of stakes. And I don't have any. Just a morbid fascination that refuses to let me dissuade him from trying to be my friend. I don't think he's making shit up for attention - I've seen the texts from these women, so I know they're real. I just don't find it quite so amazing and admirable as he apparently thinks I should. I'm not against fucking around or even fucking on the sly. Do what you want - I do. But how are you going to try and tell me about the friendzone and how you were ""done"" with this and that girl because they refused to put out for you and then expect me to respect you as a man? Like you're trying to impress me? No, sorry. I just can't. It's hard for me to even keep a straight face sometimes.   I could tell him, ""Hey man, I really don't care that you fuck all of these beautiful women. Have fun. But I'll never fuck you. And I'm only mildly interested in being your friend."" But that would make my work environment awkward and would unnecessarily injure him emotionally. I may be kind of a calculating bitch with a long game, but I'd rather not Hannibal Lecter my coworkers and emasculate them straight to their faces.   Hence /r/confession.   But I'm showing him what it feels like to feel disposable. It's a taste of his own medicine, as he ""nexts"" women as soon as he gets bored of them sexually or as soon as they show any kind of monogamous tendencies. I've seen him go through a lot of them.   Or as soon as they cheat on him - he gets cheated on a lot, apparently. Which doesn't really surprise me, considering a lot of the women he sleeps with are the girlfriends of other men. So is it really cheating if they fuck their real boyfriends too? Who are they cheating on? I dunno, his exploits confuse me. I tell him to be careful he doesn't get shot by a husband.   Mainly I stick around because some small part of me thinks we actually could be friends, except that I have so little respect for him because of this elaborate peacock show he puts on in order to gain my attention as a woman. To show me how little he needs women and how disposable he sees them as.   I just don't understand what's supposed to be alluring about that, but I'm trying to figure out why he would think I would be impressed by it."

confession,3e02lp,v_____________v,17,Tue Jul 21 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"You remind me of myself. I have a very analytical mind and obsess with understanding things, particularly people, that do not make sense to me. This has never really been a bad thing before as it allows me to understand and accept the workings and thought processes of many different people. It opens my eyes to so many different walks of life. This typically involves me asking a lot of questions and being very open minded. There have been times when I go as far as playing along with someone's ""games,"" simply because I was intrigued and quite frankly fascinated that they think this shit works.  What I eventually realized was it can be a dangerous path. The guy you are humoring is toxic to you. He sees you as a game, an object that, if pushed the right way, will mold to his whim. There is no respect and there never will be. You say you think you want to stick around because you think you ""might"" be able to be friends with him. My question to you is why? You can safely assume his only goal with you is sex. He does not value you as a friend and does not think you contribute anything to a relationship other than your body. Take a look at the redpill subreddit to see how toxic these people can get. As confident as you are now, interacting with this kind of person, even KNOWING what they are doing, impacts you negatively. Even if you want to argue that it won't, what positive would that friendship give you? Do you think he would foster a healthy friendship? He doesn't even ask you questions about yourself. He very clearly does not care about anything but ""winning"" his game.   Now do a thought experiment for a second and say you are his ""friend."" You know him for having a particular reputation with girls. Do you think you are the only one who knows of this reputation? If people see you out together what will they assume? Do you want to go out and associate yourself with someone who you KNOW has no respect for and uses women for sex. Even if you never have sex with him, why associate with someone who so obviously has no respect for you?   Now don't get me wrong, I understand the satisfaction of what you are doing. That ""apathy"" you describe often regarding him is the reason you are currently winning the game. This game, whether you win or not, turns into a slippery slope of losing self respect for yourself, simply because you tolerate and sometimes push his behavior further. Just my warning. Toxic people, whether romantic, friend, or acquaintance, are always draining. The less association the better IMO"

I'm just doing the normal things someone who isn't really interested in being more than a casual friend would do. I just don't want any intimacy in my life, either with friends or people who I have sex with and breakfast the day afterwards.  It just randomly occurred to me that the stuff I do naturally (make my attention and attendance valuable to people by making myself scarce) is stuff that PUA/RP folks do deliberately in order to seduce women.   I'm not trying to seduce anyone, I'm just trying to maintain a certain level of social competence in order to get by in public and at work, but not let anyone get emotionally close to me. So I have to lead people on to a degree and be friendly with them for the sake of social competence in the workplace, but push them away once they try to become closer friends or develop romantic feelings for me."

Just getting my two cents in about how silly PUA tactics are and the possible mindset of the guy. Much like what you've been doing.  I think he is probably in a different situation than I was in but the point is that people who do this are doing it because they have been put down so many times and they want control or a change in their life.

I've lived here ~10 years, but not consistently - I've moved away several times, and always had to come back for various reasons. This has done a great job of eliminating social connections outside my friends each time.  Maybe it's just because I never got their perspective. I recognize that the same situation can look extremely different when looked at through a different lens. I lost the source for it, but I can't help but think of a video I saw where it was one incident seen from three camera angles. In the first, it looks like a guy is dodging a car racing out between two buildings. In the second, it looks like he's attacking someone. In the third, it's clear he's tackling someone out of the way of collapsing (scaffolding? something with a ton of bricks on it). This is actually what got me thinking a long time ago that perhaps something else is going on here.  So how would I go about meeting some good black people?

Black people aren't a monolith, you are bound to find some hanging out doing the same things you do.  Just don't make a beeline for the first black person you see, people can tell if your reason for striking up a conversation isn't authentic and black people aren't receptive to being appointed someone's ""new black friend"".  Don't worry about your body language too much...unless you actually flinch visibly, there's nothing that can't be attributed to just plain social awkwardness and nice people, regardless of race, won't judge you for being a little awkward.

However, he is the one that ultimately decided to kill himself, and though he may have been depressed in part due to you leaving him, the final act of going through with it is all on him.   Take this revelation about your behavior to heart make sure to better yourself in the future. It's the only thing you can do really."

Perhaps there's something in your background that triggered you. It certainly wasn't the best way to react as a girlfriend, so understandably you have some guilt. Talk to a therapist about getting through it. No one is responsible for a suicide but the victim, but you should try to understand why you weren't emotionally able to handle your ex's assault."

confession,3e1uw5,letsgosmoke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm going to buck the trend here and point out that being the partner of someone who has been raped is, itself, traumatic.  Not everybody can handle that, and in any event, it is not really the job of a partner to be the other partner's sole emotional support anyway.  That, all by itself, does not necessarily make you a bad person.  Being disgusted with them for being victimized, however, really is a shitty response.  So there's that.  However, it happened.  It's in the past.  You made a horrible mistake, but you can't change it now.  Beating yourself up over it won't achieve anything, won't bring him back, and won't make anything at all better for anyone.  You were a different person then, hopefully.  If you want to make a difference, use that to become an even better person in the future; get some therapy, sort your shit out, analyze why you reacted that way, and maybe do some kind of work for other people to make life better for someone else."

Seriously though, I'm in the same position as you. When someone asked me a few years ago what the most important thing in life was I'd probably answer love, family or even money. It's not though - I find the most important thing is a purpose.  I'm in a sort of purgatory where I spend most of my time doing unproductive things that I enjoy while postponing real responsibility or choices as long as possible. But it can't last, obviously. I read a lot, because I feel it's at least somewhat useful, and I play videogames and hang out with friends aside from working some loose jobs.  I guess you should just keep an open mind, find something that evokes more than mild indifference from you and then explore that option, even if it's something outlandish like being a deep-sea explorer. Don't retreat into yourself, because you won't get any inspiration. Put yourself out there, but don't waste money on education or training before you know it's the right thing for you.

You're oil and water, you don't mix. He's undeveloped.  Sure, some 17 year olds can be gorgeous, tall, sinewy, sweet, sexually developed and bright, but at the end of the day, they lack the neurological development to truly function in an adult relationship and I learned that the HARD way by having my heartbroken by... let's face it, a kid.  You're not a pedophile by any means and this isn't immoral. I don't subscribe to the social stigma of an age-gap in a relationship, but it's already so simple:  He's told you he's not romantically interested, so do NOT even think about pursuing. He wants sex from you. I'm assuming there's already online sex in this relationship? I can guarantee that's virtually all he wants.

Women release oxytocin after sex, the hormone that makes you feel attached and lovey-dovey. That's why typically, women find it difficult to sustain an NSA sexual relationship.  The fact that you're combining this friendship, sexual-relationship and these potential romantic feelings, it does sound like what you say: A dead end."

As an adult I get why you have to keep on teenagers, but on the other hand, teenagers still deserve privacy unless they've given a reason (failing grades, trouble at school/with the law, smoking/drugs) for all access into their rooms.

If you ask, they'll deny it and spout some circular bullshit about ""I am an adult and you are a child"".  It's ALSO a symptom of the huge divide between a teenager's mentality and an adult's mentality. You view your property as your room, but your parents view their property as their whole house. While not necessarily wrong about owning the house they paid for, they are failing to give you basic respect. It does not excuse their behavior, but understanding it will help. Home ownership is a feeling of entitlement and pride young people cannot easily understand until it really happens.  Above all, I'm sorry you have to deal with this. It isn't right."

And why does a teenager not deserve to have a private space for those things anyway? They are humans, aren't they?

As someone who was bullied and went through a period of self harm, my mother's way of invading my privacy instead of being involved only pushed me further from her.

And forcing yourself to trust and have faith in those you love even if u have doubts, your mind can fuck with you and reality, it's tough work but learning to get past those insecurities and paranoia are huge for trusting and happy relationships."

confession,3dvgg7,ravia,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:21:12 2015 UTC,"It's fine because you were kids and it happened and that's about that. The issue I have is with the incredibly pervasive reply that kids are curious and experiment. Frankly this doesn't appear to have been experimentation so much as an actual sex life and functioning sexuality. The problem I see is that, absent some social/cultural support for this, while some kids may engage this way successfully, others may not be able to handle the lack of basic support and affirmation that says, basically, ""you're ok"". If some parents find out, they freak and the kid gets a real complex about it, while the bonds can be complex and deep between the kids. Add sex to that and it's a matter of being able to handle all that, or not being able to. Girls especially can strongly crush and experience this very naturally, though boys can, too. Big emotional ties, dramatic, tearful breakups can all take place and follow a natural course, but only if the a adults aren't so stupid a to make it all unmentionable.   So I'm saying it's not just experimentation, but mini relationships. Adults should be ready for this and learn how to keep their distance, make room for it, maybe intervene at times if truly necessary.   As a boy who sexualized pretty early, I can tell you it totally fucked me up. I spent years fearing I would wind up with VD for brief sexual play with other children, while crushing was a mess of unsupported, abortive emotions. What an mess. Unfortunately, this was compounded by other traumas.  I felt incredibly dirty. Just the other day, I had such a vivid memory of my one friend looking at me as we were playing by the road. I was in my cutoff shorts and dirty as I was all summer, bare feet, no shirt, my purple shorts cut jagged like the Hulk. He looked at me and said, ""You're dirty."" I knew what he meant, but I said, ""Well I have dirt on me."" ""That's not what I mean."" Later he would casually inform me that his parents told him that soon he wouldn't be friends with me.  The quiet movements in Mr. Rogers neighborhood are among the most brutal."
confession,3dvgg7,mmm_egg,-17,Mon Jul 20 05:03:39 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the consensus here and say that what you experienced was child-on-child sexual abuse. While it is normal for young kids to be ""curious,"" it's not normal for that curiosity to be focused on sexually stimulating acts. It's typically because one of the children was abused by an adult and then repeats what they ""learned"" on other children.   If you're having any current problems stemming from these interactions, like an unusually high or no sex drive, difficulty maintaining relationships, or substance abuse, there is treatment available. You can look for a therapist with experience in treating traumas and EMDR therapy works really well with this type of trauma."

We aren't talking about some kid being manipulated by an adult here. We are talking about kids experimenting with EACH OTHER. By your logic, I've been assaulted countless times in games of tag because ""yeah, I wanna play!"" didn't really mean anything.  I never knew being abused could be so exciting. You are projecting a lot of adult feelings onto a voluntary ""play"" experience between children.  Just because it has a lot of different meaning to us does not mean children see it the same way. It's a different kind of play that has new, interesting sensations, and a little feeling of mischief because they pick up on how taboo adults treat it around them. That doesn't mean they feel violated or abused. It's not the same as when it's involuntary, or coerced by someone they feel has great power over them that they can't say no to."

I know an absolutely gigantic amount about HR, new hire psychology, corporate culture, and so on. The reason I spoke to literally over a hundred technologists about our tech is that my field was not web frameworks. My developer has the experience, background, and track record to show he knew what he was doing, but it took so long, tech conversations came up with a LOT of people.   Simply this: WordPress was never once mentioned as a tool to build our service. Even in discussions with start-up experts on how to rapid prototype web services, with a cohort group of 40 other grad students on 6 other teams, not a single mention of WordPress was ever made. The only thing I knew about it was that it was a blogging tool, which is a laughable oversimplification.

That would make the recording illegal. So check on that before you do that. Second, unless your parents make good on their threats to kick him out he will keep doing it. And he isnt going to become a better person. Nope. Wont happen. The truth of the matter is you wont convince him of his behavior being disgusting. He knows what he is doing. He wont wake up and realize and apologize (unless he wants something from you). So fighting with him really doesnt do anything. And it could get you in trouble. Sounds like he may be a decent liar. The thing is, it doesnt matter what you say to him. So stop worrying about it as far as that goes. The problem is with your parents. They need to kick him out, change the locks, and then when he comes back threatening and kicking the door down to have him arrested. I doubt they will do it, though. So you need to get out.

confession,3dw1y4,AllisayinKY,2,Mon Jul 20 03:46:46 2015 UTC,I have talked to several vets and they have mentioned that it might be a slipped/herniated disk in her back.
confession,3dw1y4,vaginadeathsquad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:12:31 2015 UTC,"I love that there are people like you in this world who would sacrifice to help a pet. I am sure you are well very intentioned giving this advice to OP.  I am a little more pragmatic about these sorts of things - I love my animals (cat and dog) and would do just about anything for them... but when it comes down to it I look at the quality of life of the animal.  I have a Bernese Mountain Dog.  (yay! - /r/bernesemountiandogs) These animals are notorious for health problems.  We have taken good care of our dog over her life - and we have had her for 6 years now.  In that time she suffered hip dysplasia when she was 10 months old and had to have 3 separate surgeries to correct her hips.  She was laid up for about 4 months where, for 2-3 times a day, I had to help her go to the bathroom by putting a scarf underneath her hips to allow her to squat enough to go without causing too much damage to her healing hips.  I love that dog - and she reciprocates with unconditional love back. These are some of the most loyal, loving family dogs you can get.  This breed has SO many problems as they get older that the Swiss have a saying about them:  'three years a young dog, three years a good dog, three years an old dog ... all else a gift from God'.  There will come a time - sooner than I will admit - that a hard decision will have to be made... and I will have to weigh the full life she has had to the specter of the miserable life that could be coming for her.  I don't want to let her go - but I don't want her to suffer because I can't let her go.  So I have had to steel my heart for that day.  The day that I am going to have to tell the vet to put her down.  It  affects the relationship I have with her because every time she sits next to me during dinner, or wants to go outside and play, or puts her head on my shoulder while I sleep and starts wagging her tail to wake me up - I think about that decision I will have to make.   It makes me a bit sad - but I know that I have given her my all and she has given me her all in return.... and she will need me to be strong for her in the end."

It hurts us just as much when we have to do it. But I will say its not nearly as sad for us when we can see the animal suffering and we know there is no cure like last weekend we put down a 21 year old cat it stopped eating and was on its last leg. We provided a pain free death when it was obviously going to come and the last days of it would be struggling to stay alive. You sound like an amazing owner and that dog is lucky to have you most people would never do what you did. Also last weekend someone came in with a cat with the flu it needed to be hospitalized but ""that's just too much money"" so she put it down instead I cried because it looked just like my little cat and it was just awful. No reason that cat needed to be put down also it could have been cheaply cured if she didn't wait on it for a week before bringing her in."

confession,3dtmd9,par6,22,Mon Jul 20 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"It's easy for attractive people and just plain average people to say that looks shouldn't matter/don't matter.  The truth of it is that looks do matter. But so does determination, personality, hard work, intelligence, and a bunch of other things. There's a quote I like from an author I love: ""It's a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money"" (Albert Camus), and I think this equally applies to other things like looks.  But on the upside, there are a lot of other things that matter in the world. If you want to live a meaningful life then start focusing on other things. The world desperately needs more good people. Not pretty people, not rich people, but good people. So be a good person, and be the best one that you can be. If you focus on doing what you love, or failing that if you focus on doing important things, then when someone stares at you for being ugly it won't hurt nearly as much. And you aren't going to dwell on it nearly enough.  That determination and drive to live a good, meaningful life takes a lot of time and effort. It doesn't leave you with much time for self-pity.  And in the meantime if you feel like something to read then try out some Stoic philosophy (personally I like Seneca's letters a lot, though Marcus Aurelius is a bigger name in that scene)."

When anyone is always going out of their way to talk to you, that means they really like you. She used the word only for lovers once when she made the mistake and didn't use it again until she gave you that piece of paper correct. She knows what it means and is obviously interested in you. GO FOR IT! DO IT! DON'T MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY! This is your chance, don't put too much pressure on yourself, just go for it. You may not think you look good but that's your opinion of yourself, that doesn't mean other people aren't interested in you. So it sounds like she gave you a kokuhaku, so at this point she has already shown her interest and is kinda asking you out. So take her to a nice small cafe and just talk to her, tell her that you are interested too. Seriously dude life is too fucking short to be alone and miserable, inexperience is nothing and some women really find it cute. Go for it you idiot, you may never get the chance like this again.

confession,3dt4nj,TheGoodAmerican,30,Sun Jul 19 05:03:21 2015 UTC,"I wish that you didn't feel ashamed. It seems fine to me that you feel a loss. Smoking isn't the healthiest thing in the world but neither are a lot of things that people indulge in. I live in a place where pot is completely legal, so most everyone here just kind of accepts that it's a thing people do, and a lot of people see it as medicinal and therapeutic.  There are other things you can take up that may help you feel better, like a regular meditation practice, a healthy diet, and working out. They're not quite the same but they do give you something positive to focus on that is just for you. I hope you find something that works to replace your weed smoking habit."

If someone said that they fucking LOVED getting pizza on friday night, and looked forward to having their favorite meal every Friday because it was something they did solely for themselves, because they loved it, and then for no good reason had to stop, nobody would pass judgment and say they were ""Weak,"" we'd say ""man that's bullshit you had to stop something you loved that was harmless for no good reason."" So you shouldn't feel bad."
confession,3dt4nj,GuyForgett,7,Sun Jul 19 14:32:48 2015 UTC,"I'm 35 and had much the same reasons as you do. For me it was mostly paranoia that I'd get caught somehow and it would put an end to my career (I'm in University training to be a social worker).   I feel like my quality of life has deteriorated since I quit, I often fantasize about moving to a country where it's legal. I'm from the UK and my wife is American and from Washington state but she has no desire to ever live there again.  Shortly before I quit smoking it my dealer was arrested, it was a big factor in me quitting as I had no method of getting hold of anything anymore. I don't have friends that smoke as they all stopped a long time before I did and have no contacts that are able to get anything. I'd reckon that not being able to get hold of any is the biggest reason that I've remained clean of it as the craving for it and desire to use and memories of just relaxing and playing video games or watching movies while on it are just always at the back of my mind.  I mean I get days, even weeks where I don't think about it. But it comes back constantly. Sometimes I walk past people that smell of it and it brings on massive cravings. It's not like I can stop random teenagers in the street as a middle aged man and ask if they can sort me out with some, I remember being that age and it would have been unbelievably weird and suspicious.  It gets easier in a sense, in that you do get time where it's not on your mind and not worrying about facing criminal charges is good but yeah, kind of sucks. It's annoying in a sense since a lot of my friends and even the people I work with drink regularly as a method of relaxing and to me, smoking has always been safer and left me much more in control that drinking does."
confession,3dt4nj,weedbearsandpie,4,Sun Jul 19 07:38:31 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting and I am so glad you shared. I come from a family of heavy drinkers and I've been out of AA all my life. But once I smoked marijuana, I felt like an anxiety was lifted. Instead of resorting to that glass of wine after work (which would lead to 6 glasses) I would just share a spliff with my partner after dinner and that would be the end of it. It's helped my quality of life...over drinking. I don't think using weed or alcohol is a good substitute for coating one's problems. Perhaps marijuana worked for you in the same way it does me--it's a substitute to cure your anxiety or depression. I would say it's worth trying to find out what outlet is going to substitute for weed--hopefully not anti-depressants...but maybe exercise or therapy, meditation, or writing. I encourage you to find a new release. I think being in-tuned with your sober body and emotions is a hard thing to first grip--but once you do, you'll be glad you kept with it."
confession,3dt4nj,poolgirl666,10,Sun Jul 19 16:38:59 2015 UTC,"I was a smoker myself -  a heavy one. I would spend half of my salary on weed/hash, sometimes even more. The other half was for my rent, other expenses and food. Leaving me with nothing at the end of the month. I lost contact to family and friends, lost my job and was a hazard to my own health and sanity. All I cared was about getting/staying high 24/7. This lasted about 7 years of my life.  I am turning 35 this Year and have been away from smoking for another 7 years. I have a job I like, a SO I want to spend the rest of my life with and a beautiful son of 9 months. Not to forget a car and a dog. Everything I would have not been able to accomplish while being high 24/7.  I would lie if I would say that the last 7 years have been easy. The urge to get totally shit faced is still there sometimes and it is hard to resist, knowing all I have to to, is to pick up the phone, make a few calls and I would be in possession of some dope.  I had a few minor relapses, they where all in the first couple of years after deciding to get clean. It was one hell of a ride when I would take a few puffs with friends or would take advantage of my SO being out of town. But every damn single time I would feel like shit afterwards and sometimes even immediately after it started to kick in.  What I'm trying to say is that I went through the same urges and feelings in the first couple of years. There is nothing you have to be ashamed of, it's normal - even for a ""light"" user like yourself. A lot of people underestimate the addiction of weed/hash. It might not be a physical addiction like other drugs - more an psychological addiction , but it is an addiction. Be aware of that.  You are aware of your feelings and it seems like you are fighting against those urges - which is a good thing. Stay focused on positive things like /u/Gerenium said before me. Please do not try to find an equivalent substitute like alcohol, don't get me wrong there is nothing against a couple of beers now and then, but not on a regular basis to ""help"" you wind down from work. Trust me, I went down that road and it was a dangerous one - but thats a other story to tell though.   Stay focused, talk to someone. get out of the house when you have the urge, do exercises, anything that will keep your mind off of it.   It will get easier and better with time.  If you have have the urge to talk, feel free to message me.   Take care of yourself buddy.  Edit: typos"

Denture making process takes 3-4 appointments with 3-4 weeks of lab processing. You will first be fitted with interim complete dentures. After about 4-6 months of wearing them, you will need to go through the same process again to get your permanent complete dentures. Interim dentures are essential because after extractions, your bone level will change and interim dentures allows the dentist to make immediate adjustments to it so that it sits properly. After your bone heals from the extraction, that is when you begin the process of making permanent complete dentures. It is a long process, but you will be paying at a fairly large discounted rate for extractions and dentures. The only downside is time and patient-student dentist commitment."

confession,3dsrs6,iTackleFatKids,25,Sun Jul 19 09:13:40 2015 UTC,"I hope to shed some light on what I believe is a very serious issue with health care in the United States (among others).  For the doubters, I don't know what OPs situation is, but I would not be surprised in the slightest if the state they live in has virtually no programs to help them. Realize that it is not absolute that Medicaid or other assistance programs will cover dental in your area. For Medicaid, it depends on the state you are in. I'm not saying OP is being truthful, but I do know that Medicaid does not always cover dental.  Here in Utah, unless you are a pregnant woman or a child, Medicaid only pays for emergency teeth removal. As in, the pain is so severe or the infection is so bad it's going to kill you. You have to get prior approval from your provider for that. It's very difficult to get that approval. This isn't much of a surprise considering Congress keeps pushing Medicaid cuts.  I'm personally in a difficult situation with my teeth and can find virtually no assistance in my state what-so-ever. In my town, there is one charity clinic that does fillings and other kinds of dental care. All others are either dental schools that charge 50% of the cost if you're at the poverty line or are clinics that focus on pulling teeth only, typically for the homeless.  I spent a long time trying to get treatment at the one charity clinic, but because of the overwhelming number of people that rely on that clinic for dental care, they do a daily raffle where 2 or 3 people in about 50 get treatment that day. You have to be present at the clinic during the raffle to get treatment. Treatment consisted of either an xray, a single filling, or getting a tooth pulled.  I had to make the tough decision of dropping a term of college so that I could devote every day to going to this clinic because my tooth hurt so bad. Over 6 months of visiting it daily, I was only able to get in twice, once to get an x-ray of my teeth and the other to rebuild one particular problem tooth. I was very lucky to get the rebuild. They told me if I had waited any longer, the tooth would not have been recoverable. While that rebuild was happening, over the partition next to my chair, they were telling a sobbing woman that they would have to pull out all of her teeth. Sadly, that wasn't the first time I heard that at the clinic.  I have a friend that is much worse off. All his teeth are pitted, eroded, black, and infected. They cause him a lot of pain; enough pain that he sometimes passes out from it. He goes to the emergency room and they tell him he's not covered for surgery and prescribe him antibiotics instead. That temporarily solves the issue, but the infection invariably comes back.  It's bad enough here that we have annual fairs where dentists donate their time to do some general dental work. Most of what they do at these clinics is pull teeth because most people on welfare in this state have no dental coverage and cannot afford to get treatment anywhere else. That's a once a year shot where you're competing with thousands of people just to get a little bit of relief.  The situation is pretty dire here. Medicaid coverage isn't the worst, but being in a conservative state makes being on it very difficult. As a person on disability, I'm reeling from it.  I've been working very hard for years to work through my issues so that I can gain stable employment and take care of this issue. I managed to get a couple of associate degrees and I am working with a state office to work around my disability so I can gain employment. When health crises crop up and I don't have the resources to take care of them, it becomes very difficult to focus my energy on becoming self-sufficient.  Every time my teeth hurt, it reminds me of just how bad my situation is. When I go into the clinic, I stare at the homeless and hope to God that what I'm looking at isn't my future because I'm trying so damn hard to do something with my life. There are days I just want to put a bullet in my head and be done with it because I just don't have the energy to cope with it all. It's the most demoralizing thing I've ever experienced. I can't maintain my integrity. Sadly, I know I am not the only one in my area that's going through the same thing or worse.  I can't say much for OP, but if they're in a similar situation, I hope they get the help they need."

confession,3dsrs6,Sir-Climhazzard,2,Sun Jul 19 17:06:50 2015 UTC,Thank you for your kind reply. I really appreciate you sharing this story.
confession,3dsrs6,Sir-Climhazzard,2,Sun Jul 19 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"Of course!   You hear ""dentures"" and think the old people teeth in the glass of water on your bedside table.  But dentistry has progressed so much since then.  You can get your teeth replaced and not only will no one be able to tell, but you won't have to do too much special stuff to them either (besides the cost and actual implantation of course)."
confession,3dsrs6,Sir-Climhazzard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:24:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I was shocked to hear a few of my friends in their twenties also have dentures... I would have never known!
confession,3dsrs6,Sir-Climhazzard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:27:11 2015 UTC,"You are definitely not alone, and you shouldn't be embarrassed. This is something beyond your control -- a genetic illness. I hope you got some advice here that will help you get the work done at a cost you can afford. Good luck and best wishes for a speedy recovery.  I have a relative who had to have all her teeth pulled and replaced with dentures. The recovery was no fun, but it was fairly quick (she was older than you are, so you'll probably have even more luck in that respect) and now you'd never know. I actually know a few people who have dentures and I had no idea until they told me. Dentists can work magic these days."
confession,3dsrs6,crazy15,7,Sun Jul 19 05:59:30 2015 UTC,"I went through the same thing you are now.   My mom's side of the family is just like yours. Mostly with the females. Aunt's and cousins went through it to varying degrees.  My mom had to get dentures at 16. My sister did it at age 22 and I had to do it when I was 24. What's weird is that quite a few people on my dad's side of the family had extra adult teeth, if they lost an adult tooth another would grow in. You'd think it'd balance each other out with me and my siblings, but nope.   I can tell you that you are going to feel amazing when it is all said and done and you can smile at strangers, like cashiers and such and not worry what they think of your teeth.   Being able to really laugh around friends without covering your mouth is an amazing feeling and a huge confidence booster.   My biggest advice for when you are able to have this done, is to make sure you have someone who can take of you afterwards and for the next few days. You will need it.   And please, follow all aftercare instructions. Don't smoke, no using straws. Dry socket from dislodging a blood clot is more painful than you'd think.   Good luck, OP."
confession,3dsrs6,Phooey138,4,Sun Jul 19 12:41:17 2015 UTC,Wow that is a heck of an experience to go through. I had no idea so many other people were going through the same thing I am... I felt so alone that I was the only one around my age with such bad dental issues. Thank you for the advice of having someone else go with me... I am sure that would be a fantastic idea in case I am too much in pain to drive.
confession,3dsrs6,OklasChica,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"Oh honey, even if you only have the top done, you will be in severe pain. And if your wisdom teeth haven't popped up yet, they'll want to remove them, too, when they do the rest, so they won't pop up later with all that space they'll have to do so.   And wisdom tooth removal is painful as hell. So is canine teeth removal on the upper jaw, when those are removed it opens up straight into your sinus cavity. They'll put stitches in for those.   Honestly, the best thing to do is get your top done first. You can live with not getting the bottom done at the same time. Because it is going to hurt. I was knocked out to have my top done, had to be. I didn't really ""wake up"" from the anesthesia until hours after getting home. Thankfully my husband at the time was right there with me.   And no dentist/oral surgeon will remove that many teeth at once on a person who doesn't have someone there with them to take care of them afterwards."
confession,3dsrs6,KeeperOfThePizza,7,Sun Jul 19 05:55:14 2015 UTC,"Hey dude! Don't feel so upset about it, I'm 21 and had to get 7 teeth out, including my front four along the top (so i have dentures) along with 5 other fillings, All up it was a 2 hour operation. It's a lot of money (mine was only $6000) which i had stressed about for months, but i managed to get the money together.   There's no embarrassment in admitting you have a dental condition, I'm sure they'd understand. Have you asked your employer about some type of money-loan help? I really do hope you manage a way to come up with the money so you're no longer in pain, it'll definitely change your life!  But really dentures at such a young age is no big deal I thought i'd get a negative reaction from co-workers and others when i told them but they were all supportive - They'll improve your life ten fold. I have practically no photos of myself with my family throughout my teenage years, while there are plenty of my siblings, and the ones i managed to get in i never smiled. I refused to smile. But now, I've got this confidence to smile and it's great!"

She won many awards nationally for being a great dentist who actually cares about her patients without the judgment.

Cargill  Website: http://www.nldentalofgrandrapids.com/staff.html  I would highly highly recommend her. She is honestly the nicest, friendliest dentist I have ever met. She changes peoples lives and she is so happy to see people when they come, especially when they are coming in to have their teeth fixed she gets especially excited because she loves to help people! She's a dentist for the right reason!  I would call and ask them when she has 5-10 minutes to speak with you and then you can explain the situation to her and see if it's feasible for you to come up and see her.   If they're quoting you 10K+ other places, it may be cheaper for you to fly up here and get the work done. But depending on what you need done, you usually will have to have 2-3 separate sessions. 1 session for extractions, then a few weeks for healing, then you come back in for mouth measurements, then they order the any partials/replacements that you need, then you come pick them up.   Once it's all done it is honestly the best feeling and you will be a totally different person, I guarantee it!"

I don't know if me correlating the Duggar scandal and my childhood memories are right, but you are correct, that is a form I use to punish myself. Yet the similar circumstances seems as though I can push myself in that category.  This may be way out of your range but, do you have any suggestion on how to go about perceiving this the way you or others do. Maybe it's chemical, but I don't believe in that too strongly as my medications haven't helped too much.  All I want is to enjoy things without feeling guilty of happiness or feeling as though I'm not even worthy of doing simple things in public without feeling judged. Maybe it's a odd disorder(though my psychologists haven't said).  Anyway thanks, Tomrhod"

Of course I have a bias against myself, yet I ""feel"" it's justified with similar sources such as JD.  Just because no one is hurt or that I was a kid, doesn't mean it's okay? Is that a fair statement?  I feel as though I'm just hearing rosy things to make me feel better. But I know people are more than likely speaking from the heart and I'm being stubborn.

Listen, any one of those things would make it very difficult for anyone to succeed in college. Considering everything that you were going through, it's really very impressive that you made it as far as you did. You were only a kid, you were still in the very early stages of learning to take care of yourself, and you made some mistakes because that's what you were supposed to do-- that's how we learn. I know SO many people who dropped out of undergrad because of alcoholism, depression, PTSD, and other mental health issues. It's practically a rite of passage. It happens all the time and I think that the vast majority of people understand that.   I know this is unsolicited advice, but if time and money permit, I would really encourage you to go back. 25 is still a totally normal age to be in undergrad. When I was in college, I had quite a few classmates who were in their later 20s and early 30s, and they were always the smartest people in the class because they were so much more mature and experienced-- everyone really looked up to them. You can be that!   I don't know very much about your ex-boyfriend or your parents at all, but I will say that if your parents give a single fuck about what your ex-boyfriend has to say, they are not very good parents. Of course he's being shitty and vindictive, he just got broken up with and clearly he's an asshole-- any rational person would know not to take a single thing that he says seriously. It's not your job to take care of your parents or lie to protect them from the truth about things that they did, it's THEIR job as parents to own up to their past mistakes and do whatever it takes to support you through this difficult time. Clearly they're not doing that, and unfortunately you can't make them be better people, all you can do is focus on taking care of yourself and your child. Your parents are adults, they will get over it in time.   You sound a little dejected, and I really feel awful that you're in such a bad place right now, but honestly? There's a lot shining through your post that makes me think that this is your ""rock bottom"" and that things are going to get a lot better for you from here on out. You're in therapy, you dumped your asshole boyfriend, you're self-aware and reflective (even though you're too hard on yourself) and you're really dealing with your negative feelings about all of this. You are going to be ok."

In fact, it does make me wonder if she was under so much pressure to get pregnant, that you cumming inside her was something she thought would be a relief to her. Almost as if she hoped you'd get her pregnant just so she could finally have the damn baby and not face the reproductive stress of her relationship.

It does really make me think that it's a possibility that she wanted you to inseminate her. Especially since she told you not to bother using contraception.  I'm not saying that was her SOLE purpose in the affair. I think she was sexually-frustrated, stressed and having to face the pressure of reproductive issues in her relationship. I think you provided her with sexual-satisfaction and the bonus was that if you came inside her over and over again, not only would she get good sex out of it, but IF she were to become pregnant, hey, that's just something she's been trying to be for ages, it wouldn't be the end of the world if this affair resulted in that.  It's a shame the child couldn't be the biological product of the father instead of you, but I hope all can go well and that this was just a slip-up."

She would have known when she was ovulating so at that time she was ""insatiable"" and when she was pregnant she was done with you - ""by mutual consent"".

It's just that he lost his libido when it really mattered.   She did suggest the proper hospital version of the turkey baster - basically he'd have to jizz in a cup and the doctors would squirt it right up in there. But he was pretty opposed to the idea.

Maybe she was willing to do anything to get everyone off her back?  We'd see each other once or twice a week,  but she came to me way more often, almost daily, when she was frustrated, which was usually when he was stressed about performing (around ovulation time, i think)  As for him knowing, I really hope that's the case.

Usually I think the cheated-on partner has a right to know what kind of a relationship he's in. He has a right to make an informed decision about continuing his marriage, and how they're going to handle paternity questions for themselves, and for the kid.   That said, I would be torn. What's best for the kid? They seem happy. This kid has 2 parents- is wanted and loved . Who knows, dad may even suspect something and prefer not to know. But mostly, that poor kid doesn't want to know. That kid just wants the family he knows to be ok and together.   Anyway, maybe you should distance yourself from them? Maybe your instinct is to just let their relationship and family take its course without any further interference from you. You're not a good friend to either of them, because you broke his trust and you helped her complicate and possibly poison her marriage. They may not know that you're not a good friend, but you do. And you're probably not in any position to be the kids ""godfather."" At this point, it might be too weird to decline or retract your position, but you can just fade out (by moving or just withdrawing from their lives) and someone else can fill that role.  And, honestly, if the dad or the kid ever confronts you with suspicions, questions, I think it would be shitty of you to lie. If they come to you, it's because they want and need to know, and you're not making the call- they are. If that makes sense? There is going to be fall-out, but it's a natural consequence of the choices you all made."

One, the kid will grow up living a lie because it's easier for you. Two - and most importantly - is medical. If/when that kid gets sick or has some serious illness, doctors will be referring to the wrong family history. This could cause even bigger consequences for the kid because again, it's easier for you.  I'm not judging you because we all have done things we are not proud of. In fact, I think many who judge you harshly are doing so to elevate their moral values at your expense.  But do the right thing for the kid.

For example, what if the kid has a blood type that isn't compatible with the husband?  First, you need to find out if the kid is really yours. Everything up to this point is just speculation.

confession,3dpp66,BeerMan684,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:49:46 2015 UTC,"I had to create a throwaway for this one.  Back in 1985, after Army basic training I was at Fort Stewart, Georgia and a friend of mine was stationed at Fort McClellan, Alabama. (now closed)  We kept in touch and he invited me to his wedding and I drove over a couple of days before to party and meet everyone.  I had driven through the night and got to his apartment right at dawn, as he was reporting in a few hours then going to be off.  I laid down in their extra bedroom and after about an hour his ""almost wife"" comes in with just a towel on, cuddling up next to me.  I've already beat myself up over what happened next for the last 30 years, so nothing you can say will make me feel any worse.  We had sex, kind of a hot quickie as he would be home soon.  I spent the next three days trying to forget it ever happened as she kept winking at me, kind of being a wild bachelorette on her last days I guess.  I left to go back for Georgia after the wedding and then he called me one weekend, about 4 or 5 weeks later to tell me how happy they were that she was pregnant.  We were all barely 20, but he was one of those guys that just wanted to be a dad since he was a kid.  I was happy for him, but wondering too, so I turned down invites for the next three years or so until lo and behold, he was transferred to Fort Stewart too.  His daughter was almost 5 by then, and I had already seen the resemblance in the pictures he had sent.  I felt like shit, and to make matters worse, he said they had been trying for another but no luck, and his doctor had told him his sperm count was almost zero.  ""Gonna keep working on it tho, it might kick back in""  His positive attitude was infectious.  I had gotten married the year before, but he couldn't attend because his wife's brother had died a few weeks before and he couldn't get the time off.  His wife and mine kind of hit it off and were  a couple of Army Wives.  We had a daughter later too, and also a son, and even though there were some years between the two girls, I got to hear it all again ""how much they look like sisters.""  I never brought it up with his wife and she seemed happy to forget too.  He loved that little girl, and she's almost 30 now, a mom of two of her own.  I lost track of him after the 90's but reconnected on Facebook.  We're both Iraq War vets, settling gently into middle age, but the thing that gets me about him, about why we became friends in the first place is that he's just the nicest, most positive person I've ever known, and I know if the tables were opposite, he'd have never done that to me.  Even IF I helped him, I sure as hell didn't know that at the time.  I've never told anyone, but one time, my daughter was about 9 and she saw Rachel's picture as a teenager and said ""that's how I'm going to look.  IS she my sister?""  I just blurted out, yes, but I think she thought I was kidding.  Feels good to get all that out.  Thanks for listening.     I meant to add - The top comment says ""Don't say anything.""  This is my recommendation too."

I didn't get a date till my senior year (and my first real relationship wasn't until I was in my early 20's). Trust me when I say this, being single and alone is way better than being in ANY toxic relationship like that. Fuck that. It's all well and cute to think cheating is OK when you are that age because ""hey, at least, they have each other."" Bullshit. That will cause trust and relationship issues later down the road when shit actually matters, after high school. Trust and believe, you want no part of that shit. Instead, do what i did, and take notes. Notice all the really heinous shit they do, and do the exact fucking opposite. It's high school my friend. Chances are, you probably won't even be friends with most of the same people after a few years. Take this time to learn as much about yourself as possible, try out new shit, say yes to as much as possible and just experience everything you can. When I was 14, I played Warhammer, watched pro wrestling, listened to Blink-182, and had a bit of a weight problem, used to be self-deprecating and no sense of who or what I was. Now at 28, I live with a beautiful woman, make music everyday, I found a love of cooking, cannabis, fighting robots and battle rap, I lost some weight and really found out what I am all about. Oh, and I talk to a whole... 5 people I knew from high school with any sort of regularity. Come to find out, I'm actually a pretty decent person. Don't let the single thing bum you out. Cause chances are, you'll find a better stronger relationship when the time is right, and that person will be good to you. Trust when I say, the amount of bullshit you put up with in HS relationships just aren't worth the hassle they create as opposed to when you are older, independent people and you aren't tied down by other things like homework or after school activities and all that nonsense.  Basically, what I'm saying is, don't let something you don't have run your life because you think it's the end all be all of your time on this earth. 10 times outta 10, I'm gonna talk with the person I can learn things from and have new experiences with, than the person who just wants to constantly vent about their lack of a love life.

Figure out where you want to go career wise.  AND START WORKING out or getting serious about your physical well being anyway.  Focus on yourself and the women will come.  The way you learn to get a girl to go out with you is honestly trial and error, but don't do it at your school because then you become the weird kid, instead go to the mall on the weekends and just talk to females.  Even if you talk to 100 girls and only get 1 number, you still got 1 number.  TRUST ME! Been there done that it will help in the long run."

I know your pain. The question is, are your choices helping or hindering you?  Do you play a sport? Is fitness a priority for you? I will tell you with full candour that my resentment of singledom peaked during my WoW addiction, and I sure as sunrise wasn't doing anything constructive then.  My advice would be to start a sport you enjoy. Running on treadmills and pumping iron is about as attractive to the fitness newcomer as grinding in an RPG. I eventually took up tennis, and love it. It takes me outside, I can practise alone or with friends, and I feel much better about having constant exercise opportunities that aren't cause for dread.  The results will speak for themselves. Youll lose weight and trade it for muscle, stamina and self-esteem. You might even be motivated to hit the gym to get the most out of your performance in your other sport. These are all attractive traits, even to women who aren't high schoolers who'll be pregnant/absent fathers before their 18th birthday.   Make no mistake: your life at the moment is frustrating. I know, I've been exactly in your position at exactly your age right down to the rejections, the tears and the horny friends. The question is whether you see this as a chance to improve or a reason to withdraw from the world even further.   Best of luck, friend. One day, you'll look back on this situation and laugh."

Once my IUD was in for a few weeks, I hardly noticed it. A tampon is way more obtrusive for sure. But if it's the idea of having something in you, yeah, you've got me.

In your post you said you used this method with 2 of your partners. 1 partner for 4 years, and the most recent partner for 1 year.

Yaz was awful, I am convinced I could have died had I stayed on it- I literally was so fatigued all the time, like I literally couldn't stand a lot because I felt like I was about to pass out and I could hear my heart pounding a lot. I constantly felt like I was about to have a stroke so after 6 months I noped the fuck out. The second pill, I had two blood clot scares..amd it was the lowest dose bc pill available! On top of that, I just get the worst fucking side effects from the pill (constantly sick/throwing up, turn into a raging emotional bitch plus weight gain) and ultimately my obgyn just told me I'm too sensitive for most hormonal contraception, and recommended getting the IUD.

This includes movie stars or celebrities, male models or men who think they are sexy just make laugh.  I like it when he cums, I ask where he wants to cum and he gets to choose. At first I didn't, I just let him cum over himself and my hand. Then when it moved onto bj‘s I knew he'd never cum into someone's mouth so I pretended that I was going to stop and finish him by hand, then as he was about to cum I put it back in my mouth and swallowed.   He liked that, after I just asked him what he wanted to do and where he wanted to finish...in my hair, mouth(does he want me to let it dribble out), over my face (should I run it in etc). He gets to choose anything. (Recently he likes to ‘ram‘ it whilst grabbing my hair, and also likes me on my knees as he is standing over...so he's getting dominant. Which is fine.)  Then I'd strip off so he could cum on my chest or back and rear if he wanted.  I enjoy letting him have his desires fulfilled but if he never asks to do it again I'd not miss it, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't go out and find someone else to do it."

confession,3dpm9g,drderpderpenstein,2,Sat Jul 18 09:54:16 2015 UTC,"If human sexuality is a spectrum then why do people act like being straight is a binary state - you're either 100% straight or not straight at all? That's kind of bullshit, you know? If I'm like, 95% straight, and identify as straight, what makes you feel you have the right to label me as something I'm not? More importantly, why does everyone (friends and a lot of my family) feel this overwhelming neeed to tell me who I really am?   What you really described is ""biphobia"" and it exists in both the hetero- and homosexual communities. My ex-boyfriend is a bisexual, and he's faced down this sort of bigotry. Apparently, bisexuality just can't exist in some peoples' minds. A common statement I've heard before is ""Oh, so you're straight/gay NOW?""   Like, do you not understand how being bisexual really works? It's ignorant, plain and simple. And then, there are people who hate on the bisexual people stating how much more likely they are to cheat or some other bullshit. Sure, bisexual people cheat...but so do straight and gay people. Cheating isn't about sexuality, it's a conscious choice that an individual makes. Anyway, that went off topic a little bit. Sorry for that.  Anyway, you yourself can only define who you are...nobody else. You don't need to explain yourself. You don't need to justify anything. You don't need to answer to someone else. Live your life for yourself. If you define yourself as straight, then you're straight.   Sexuality is a confusing topic. Some people's are more fluid than others. The Kinsey Scale is probably one of the best examples of sexuality. It's really rare that someone just fits into ""Totally Straight"" and ""Totally Gay"". Most of society, whether they want to acknowledge it or not, falls into the grey area; the middle portion of the scale. I've known some straight men to enjoy blowjobs from  other men and gay men to enjoy eating a girl out from time-to-time; but it doesn't make them less than how they define themselves. I once had a friend who although identifies as gay, be in a threesome with another man and the man's wife and enjoyed it.   I myself, although I'd like to think I'm totally gay, the reality of the matter is, that I also fall into this grey area. I've enjoyed touching women's boobs and rubbing them over my chest. It doesn't make me any less gay. This is how I identify.  On another token, we can't always help who we are attracted to, sexually, emotionally, or mentally; it just plays out that way. What we do with those attractions are up to us."
confession,3dpm9g,WildRaphy,3,Sat Jul 18 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"Sure human sexuality is fluid. But we use words like hetero, bi and gay as identifier to know what sexual relationships you have been in and are open to. You identifying as hetero when you are clearly bi could be very traumatising for a future sexual partner that does not share your values. And it's just blatantly false and make the words completely meaningless (which might be your goal)  You might think it's all about you and your feels, the world should accept you for who you are etc.. The thing is that you are accepted for who you are by everyone except yourself. Very few people actually care about your identity crysis, they just want the basics down so that they can make a decision. And that's the gist of it, you know some people will judge you so instead you chose to trick them and yourself into thinking you are straight with super intricate wordplay justifications that sidelines what straight, gay and bi even means."

And other people who simply just don't like gay people.   2) why would you think this is tricking people?   Because some people have sexual preferences, if you say you are in line with their sexual preferences, then afterwards reveal that you were not then wouldn't that be tricking them into having sex on false premises.

But op is saying that she is straight when she is really bi.  When someone says they are one thing, when they are something else then that is a form of trickery. But sure, if she adds her explanation along with it every single time she says she is straight then that's not morally wrong. It's just abuse of language. I could refer to cats as dogs and have my own special logic that demands that this is the new truth and that would be very much the same issue.

A very active person suddenly get depressed, doesn't want to cook for herself, doesn't want to get up and do anything as much, and the weight is very easy to put on in that case.  I would say if his wife gained the weight recently and she's open to seeing a doctor that she go see a GP, get a full hormone and lipid panel and the doctor may ask how she's feeling emotionally and may refer her to a mental health specialist.  That's at least how it went with me."

confession,3dpcce,MoistFlappertino,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:57:22 2015 UTC,"It makes sense why you would feel guilt. These guys did this for you. However, your girlfriend seems a little too clingy if she wants to go to the same school regardless of getting into a better on. Realize if she already realized she fucked up, you guys will get into a hell of a fight. You guys should be putting your future before eachother and obviously she wasn't thinking and you're torn from guilt. You're young and the chances of you guys getting married to eachother is low so why would anyone settle for less with someone thats only there for now?  If you're literally moving just because you want ""the adult experience"" then that's a common reason but at the same time, extremely selfish unless you're already paying your own way. If your parents are paying for college and support you 100% leaving so you can live on your own, then hey, that's great. But if you're not in the best financial situation, it might not be the greatest.  Leaving home and having a long distance with your girlfriend is also not for everyone. Especially since she sacrificed a better school to be with you.  In the end, think about if it's worth it or if you can wait litterally a couple years to finally be on your own. It's completely different from having your parents care for you your entire life"
confession,3dpcce,monkeypamper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:07:29 2015 UTC,"What I have pondered intensely about is the choice between    going to this mediocre university, living high school all over again for 3 more years or transferring to a better university, living an independent life, but being several thousand in debt.   My parents berate me almost everyday about the university that I go to despite the fact that the reason I needed to go to this university was due to our financial situation. I definitely could have gone to a better university. In my family's current financial situation, we have not gotten better or worse. Yet, when my younger sister says that she wants to go to a private university like NYU or Harvard, my parents are completely willing to share a burden of her expenses.   This little fact makes me wonder why I decided to go to a mediocre university in the first place. I wanted my family's financial situation to be stable but if they're willing to pay for my sister instead of me then I feel that I should have been selfish from the beginning."
confession,3dpcce,monkeypamper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:54:06 2015 UTC,"Well thats very commendable that you're going to a crappy university because you're not in the best situation financially. But honestly, when I was in highschool, that was the only way some of my classmates were able to go to school. Again, if your parents are willing to let you go to a better school and pay for it along with you being able to be accepted, then that's great and you're lucky. But theres situations like my family that wanted me to go to school and I couldn't get into a good one so I had to move hours away. I felt so terrible making my parents pay extra money they didn't need to.   If its jealousy you're feeling, then don't go purely off that. Think about your future and whats better for you. Think about what you guys can afford because saying ""fuck you. If you're going to let my sister go to school hours away and pay a shitload of money then you're doing the same for me"" that's probably the shittiest thing to put on your parents. Talk with them and see if they are actually able to pay for you if you didn't already. If not, make your own Damn money and pay for your own rent and food and try to bargain with them if tuition is the same because if you were my kid, you better believe ""i want to grow up and live on my own"" isn't a good enough reason to move away. Your only reasons should be a better future. I would pay for my kid to go to harvard and graduate from there. Im not gunna pay for my kid to move 2 hours away so he can fuck around.  Coming from someone whose lived on their own and moved back home, the only difference I found was you're just not under their rules. It's not all that thrilling and things get old quickly. Prioritize your future. Not the experience"
confession,3dpcce,monkeypamper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"I do have a hint of jealousy but I was not going to burden my family with the expenses I would need to pay in order to attend another university. What my parents decide to do with their money is their choice and if I decide to go to a university and label myself as an independent, that is my own choice. I personally feel that I am not jealous of my sister for the money that she will receive from my parents but for her personality and drive in doing what she believes in and attending a university that is fit for her. I admire her for that.   I will never know the results of choosing between one university and another prior to making the choice and committing. You are absolutely correct that I should be thinking about my future and what's better for me as well. I fear not being able to find a job graduating from my current university. I feel that if I transfer to a far better university, I will have a higher chance of networking and landing a better job.  I did not mention it before but I am trying my hardest in all my classes and I currently have a 3.97 GPA. I may get high honors at my current university or even in another, but I am not sure how employers will judge me. If I knew that if I had a high enough GPA and an excellent understanding of my major (at my current university) that employers would still hire me despite not going to a great university, then I would definitely decide not to transfer. I have read many articles about employers not caring where their employees graduate from but there is definitely a different maximum understanding and level a university can teach you and I know that these employers know this. I want to learn and I can learn, with or without a better university. Sadly, how will my future employers know of this fact."

Therapy is flippin awesome. It takes a while to kind of get into it, but the disassociation is typically a symptom more than the actual problem.  So, the trick is to find what that is. It's pretty hard to do when you're already not connecting, and that's where therapy rocks.  I recently went through a pretty serious period of disassociation (including some amnesia). I'm happy to tell you about my experience and what I'm going through."

confession,3dlv9e,SoWhatComesNext,5,Fri Jul 17 11:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Sometimes it takes a bit to find a good therapist. Cognitive behavioral therapy is pretty great and those sort of therapists tend to be a bit more nurturing  Did anything happen recently?  I'm no counselor, so all I can offer you is the bit that I have learned through everything. For me, it was a recent traumatic incident that caused it, but I'm not sure of all the causes.  But, here is what google brought up:   What is the cause of dissociation and dissociative disorders?  Research tends to show that dissociation stems from a combination of environmental and biological factors. The likelihood that a tendency to dissociate is inherited genetically is estimated to be zero (Simeon et al., 2001).  Most commonly, repetitive childhood physical and/or sexual abuse and other forms of trauma are associated with the development of dissociative disorders (e.g., Putnam, 1985). In the context of chronic, severe childhood trauma, dissociation can be considered adaptive because it reduces the overwhelming distress created by trauma. However, if dissociation continues to be used in adulthood, when the original danger no longer exists, it can be maladaptive. The dissociative adult may automatically disconnect from situations that are perceived as dangerous or threatening, without taking time to determine whether there is any real danger. This leaves the person “spaced out” in many situations in ordinary life, and unable to protect themselves in conditions of real danger.  Dissociation may also occur when there has been severe neglect or emotional abuse, even when there has been no overt physical or sexual abuse (Anderson & Alexander, 1996; West, Adam, Spreng, & Rose, 2001). Children may also become dissociative in families in which the parents are frightening, unpredictable, are dissociative themselves, or make highly contradictory communications (Blizard, 2001; Liotti, 1992, 1999a, b).  The development of dissociative disorders in adulthood appears to be related to the intensity of dissociation during the actual traumatic event(s); severe dissociation during the traumatic experience increases the likelihood of generalization of such mechanisms following the event(s). The experience of ongoing trauma in childhood significantly increases the likelihood of developing dissociative disorders in adulthood"

The disassociation can actually make it easier to run since you essentially zone out and let your legs do their thing.  For me, it's rock climbing. It's nice to feel challenged like that.  I'm sure you have heard the thing about exercise a lot. Unfortunately, it's a true and valid point. I know starting something is really hard, but it's probably your best bet.

With rock climbing, there is definitely a point where I feel very separated from myself and it's more like I'm just ""doing"" rather than thinking. I'm not sure if that's the same sort of feeling.  Does this sound somewhat familiar?:   ""Some may ask why I am running such long distances. There are reasons. During the ultras I come to a point where my body is almost dead. My mind has to take leadership. When it is very hard there is a war going on between the body and the mind. If my body wins, I will have to give up; if my mind wins, I will continue. At that time I feel that I stay outside of my body. It is as if I see my body in front of me; my mind commands and my body follows. This is a very special feeling, which I like very much. . .

Hey guess what bud, for people that actually suffer from clinical depression, it doesn't just get better and go away. For me personally I am on anti depression and anxiety medication and I can't function without it. I understand the stigma behind it, and it may take a few tries to figure out the right meds and dosage, but it's totally worth it. Marijuana is NOT medication for depression. Sure it might help some people relax and feel better, but it's obviously not working for you. I understand how hard it is to take the first step to get some help, especially when you aren't motivated to do ANYTHING. You need to snap out of it enough to reach out and attempt to fix it.

I struggle every day to divest myself of the notion that there's nothing wrong with me a bit more effort couldn't fix.  Why?  Because it is, in my case, a toxic idea.  An incredible amount of effort has been put forth in my life to succeed, and I've hit the bounds of what that will do for me.

Some time mid junior or senior year, I, in tears, had to be talked down from dropping out and abandoning my full ride.  And yet that two week stretch at the end of senior year when I had a to-the-minute schedule for things like sleeping, pooping, and completing final assignments (and, you know, an allotment of maximum 4 hours of sleep each night)?

""I wish my brain worked as fast as yours,"" one coworker remarked recently.  Yes.  It's fine.  It's like a dog with a lot of energy.  It's fine as long as it has enough to play with, but if you ignore it and it gets bored, it starts destroying your house.  There are a million ways in which you will tell yourself you're normal.  Fuck it, maybe you are.  Maybe you're just a fucking slacker.  Maybe you forgot to pay that bill because you're irresponsible.  Maybe you spent too much time on your phone at work because you're lazy.  Or maybe you need to approach these things a different way because you work differently.  Maybe there is a drug that can help you manage the other things.  I'm not a doctor, but this sounds like me four years ago:   I'd like to try Adderall once to see if it would help, although I feel like drugs are a cheap shortcut and I reject the notion that I actually need it.   With the skepticism bordering on irrational that was drilled in to me regarding psychiatric medication.  Look, there is no gradient scale.  There is no point where you're going to say ""yep, I'm sad, but this is too sad, so this must be depression"".  You will never rationally convince yourself you have ADD.  At least until you can't take it any more, and your coping mechanisms break down.  I'm not a doctor, and I'm not qualified to tell you if you have a condition, and much much less qualified to suggest how you could or should deal with it.  Just... don't be afraid to ask the right person the right questions.  In fact, don't be afraid to just spill everything to the right person, without trying to explain or couch everything in the way you may have been convincing yourself all your life that such things were ""normal,"" because I don't think it's about that.  I really really don't.  I think it's about what can help.  I'll leave you with this thought.  It's the thought that finally made me willing to embrace, eh, ""behavioral medication"" as a concept (though one I still approach cautiously, because this stuff is not something to screw around with, and I'm not always certain of my doctors' competency).  I'm a transhumanist.  This is not to say that I have grafted robot parts on to my body, but that I embrace, on a philosophical level, the possibility of using technology to augment myself for the better.  Robot legs?  Sure.  New senses plugged in to my brain?  I'm for it.  A little button that I can press to get 8 hours of sleep in 10 minutes?  I'm fuckin' on board, man.  Anyway, the thought is this:  How can I oppose chemical augmentation and embrace physical augmentation?  It broke down the barriers.  I told my doctor I was concerned.  This is what I've been having problems with.  I'm concerned it could be this.  What do?  Christ, dude, the Adderall wasn't even given to me for ADD at that point.  My doc gave it to me because I couldn't wake up in the morning, and it felt like pieces of my brain started working that had be shut down for years.  Somewhere around a year later, after some other issues and more than one case of my doctor... not living up to the standards I thought he kept as a medical professional, I sat down with a proper psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis.  We talked for 20 minutes, during which time I spoke very little.  In fact, I could hardly get a word in.  When I finally spoke up and made a point of the problems I'd been experiencing specifically and how I reacted to the Adderall and how I wasn't sure but I thought that maybe--he cut me off mid sentence and spoke these words:   You don't have to convince me, I know you have ADD.   Ask someone.  Ask someone who doesn't know you.  Tell them you have trouble focusing.  Don't wait like I did.  Don't wait until you're scared for your job and you hate yourself.  Don't wait until you've skipped work one too many times because you curled up on the bathroom floor and cried, or simply made yourself so late trying to get ready in the morning that it just wasn't worth it.  Don't wait until you're anxious and depressed and filled with self-loathing, because it's goddamn hard to pull yourself out of that.  You have nothing to lose if approached safely by a competent medical professional, and you might just find something you forgot you lost."

It's calculated people spend about a third of their waking hours daydreaming.  Drugs suck and destroy people. Adderall was horrific and turned me into a shell of who I am. It did serious harm and my parents should have sued the doctor for the batshit insane dosage he prescribed.  Protip: Useless information is what matters in real life. Witty quips and trivia, they get you ahead socially, and most careers advance either with a Nobel prize or with strong social skills. Don't sweat getting distracted. Reddit is the modern world's version of idling at the clouds and getting lost staring off into the distance, except staring at a screen is worse for your eyes.   If you think internet addiction is a real thing, you're either an old fart or an impressionable youth. Psychological addiction is the process by which a stimulus feeds the reward center of the brain in place of social stimuli.

confession,3dnl7b,acctmade4confession,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:57:50 2015 UTC,"I got sucked into the ADD trap, it is a trap because its a catch-all. Have you tried any tests ? I believe you can find them on line. The tests describe half of the boys I grew up with who were bored with a typical classroom situation.  I ended up trying Ritalin which was a waste of time.  ADD is like depression, sure you can use drugs but its a shotgun method that masks the symptoms with out getting to root cause. Ideally drugs can give you temporary relief while you adress the real issues with a psycologist/therapist.  In my case my being easily distracted was really avoidance of meaningful tasks, I had a subconcious fear of failure due to issues from my childhood. Sounds like usual psycobabble except in my case getting the root cause helped and I stopped being easily distracted.  On the other hand if I walk into Home Depot or the Grocery store I find all the products on the shelf over stimulating, I know what it is but still it really tires me out and I have to leave. I am not going to take drugs just because I get over stimulated in some situations and I resolved the major issues.  So I cope with some issues and resolved others, I dont need drugs or the ADD lable."

I think I share some of the same symptoms, I don't like shopping for clothes because there's a lot to choose from, groceries too I stick to what I know and avoid getting creative usually due to their being so many options. I've had that tired feeling at restaurants also, just wanting a simple list and almost getting frustrated by the choices.  I do think it could be like what you're saying about the avoidance of meaningful tasks. That might be a better way to look at it, as ADD not being the problem so much as it being a symptom of a bigger problem.    I might look into the tests, I don't really believe in the accuracy on of most of them however.    Thanks for sharing"

I don't know you guys but from the story it sounds like their is some tension surrounding drugs. Does he have an aversion to illicit drugs?
confession,3dl3b5,SavageSavant,9,Fri Jul 17 09:45:24 2015 UTC,"he is using his mental health problems to justify emotionally abusing you. it sounds like a very toxic relationship.  i had a friend who sounded similar.  it was always very difficult and he was always trying to manipulate the situations for attention while he did whatever  the fuck he wanted and treated everyone like shit.   I cant imagine how much more difficult it would have been if we had been in a relationship.    Eventually I had to stop talking to him.   His negativity was affecting other parts of my life because I spent so much time trying to deal with him I didnt have the energy to deal with the rest of it.     I think you need to look at how much you can handle.   You arent a bad person now, you didnt cause all of this.  Dont listen to him when he blames you.

He is bipolar and ended up having a HUGE meltdown and my friends house (tried to break a musicians recording equipment and was acting completely insane) and was a colossal jerk about a lot of stuff the whole trip and also didn't pay for anything. I broke up with him. Its so hard and I am crying a lot but honestly you sound like an intelligent person and you can probably do better. His anxiety about going on the trip is probably because he doesn't want you to take the ayuhuasca (I want to try it myself for your same reasons) which will definitely make you a changed person. He doesn't want to change, he wants to stay at his parents house (my ex was the same) and when you get back from your trip you'll realize this relationship is not serving your higher self.

confession,3dl3b5,Need_a_Ladder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:39:45 2015 UTC,"I think you should talk with him. Give it a day or two for you both to calm down and clear your heads, then perhaps eat dinner together. Explain to him that you believe that the experience you wanted could be very beneficial to you personally (it is) and that you don't want him to feel forced into anything. Of course, you can't make him go with you, but if he is adamant on not going, you should go yourself. I can tell you that it is a very positive experience, but also very intense and scary at times.   I think it's important for him to realize that you want him to come with you because you love him and want to be able to enjoy your life together.   You said that he's more interested in conventional medicine and that's fine. But if that doesn't work for you and you still feel that you need help, you need to try other options. I'm sure he loves you very much and wants what's best you, so I think that if you two talked, he might realize how important this is to you.   If this doesn't work out and you don't make the trip, and you still feel that you need unconventional methods of dealing with your problems, maybe you should try LSD. Part of the ingredients in Ayahuasca is actually LSA, a sort of ""cousin"" of LSD that is 10 times weaker (but amplified when mixed with the other ingredients).   You both already have depression and I bet all this stress isn't healthy. Good luck and I hope you two can reconcile."

I think the trip was a mistake in the first place, by the sounds of things just the unknown prospects of such a trip can be too much. On top of just a normal sight seeing trip you added the Ayahuasca treatment ( I know what this is) which really is probably frightning to him. Your arguments as you presentented them are I think legitimate, he is not holding up his end and clearly indicated a reservation about this trip, he was dragging his feet. He came out and surprised you with backing out and your reaction might have been a little angry but it sounds more like exasperation. And really there is so much going on here that simply saying ""ok, stay the fuck home"" should not in itself be enough to derail him, I think your have overblown that confrentation.  And he is an adult, he chose to undertake this trip and did not hold up his end.  I think this is all about the trip, he committed to it and to you but then due to the money issue and the prospect of all the unknowns of this trip undoubtedly drove his anxiety through the roof."

confession,3dihoq,pickelsurprise,135,Thu Jul 16 15:22:27 2015 UTC,Let's address the fact that you've never seen Futurama...
confession,3dihoq,woodsoffeels,17,Thu Jul 16 16:50:21 2015 UTC,I guess it's because I grew up surrounded by people constantly saying it was just a worse version of The Simpsons. I've only started hearing people say it's good within the past three years or so.
confession,3dihoq,journemin,82,Thu Jul 16 17:28:53 2015 UTC,"Back then it was ahead of its time. People thought it was crude in the sense that there were suicide booths and one of the main characters was a criminal robot, the appearance of some of the characters (especially Leela) turned people off, smart jokes flew over viewers' heads, people still had that ""cartoons are for kids"" mentality, and sci-fi wasn't nearly as popular as it is today.  Futurama can definitely be considered a trail-blazer for current shows like Space Dandy and Rick and Morty. One of the many great things about the series is its timelessness and rewatchability. Another is the way it makes you care about the characters. A few episodes really pull at the heart strings, the series finale being one of them.  It's a really smart, funny, light-hearted show that everyone should check out at least once. Jurassic Bark is a bad first episode."

Don't watch that one first.   That aside, I agree with you on the Archer thing. I can't stand the animation either, and is why I don't watch it.

confession,3dihoq,jtcglasson,18,Thu Jul 16 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"The focus of the show is on the characters and more specifically their banter.  Improving the animation quality wouldn't really do much for the show as the vast majority of it is people looking at each other while throwing witty remarks and obscure references back and forth.  Sure there are some action scenes but again, it's not the focus of the show.  It's the same reason why you have great anime series that have poor or minimalist art styles.  .Hack Signs is a character study where (again) the majority of the show is dialog between characters with minimal action, it doesn't need high quality animation to be a good show because the point isn't to look pretty but serve as a medium for the study."

confession,3dihoq,AnalogDogg,5,Thu Jul 16 20:26:43 2015 UTC,The sparse animation style actually leaves your mind open to fill in more of the blanks based on voice/sound cues. It is interesting to learn it offends some people because it's different. Maybe it is lazy but it is interesting to me because of the lack of visual cues and reliance on the audio.  Watching Archer I often try to imagine the actors trying to pull off the script as they're recording it. The dialogue and timing of the jokes/scenes is unlike anything I've seen.

Maybe I should have mentioned this in the post but after it happened, she started to hide under blankets when we would be downstairs in the living room and I could see like ..movement.. and she would be under there for a long time and then come out all disheveled, sweaty, and breathing kinda hard. She would ask me to go under the covers with her and of course I'd say no. Sometimes she'd be under there and we'd suddenly say her name and she would come out quickly like she was caught doing something bad. Whenever it would happen, I'd look at my dad like ""what the heck is she doing?"" So maybe he would stop her but I also felt like I was responsible for this weird sexual awakening of sorts."
confession,3dk4cv,throwawaymyguilt157,3,Thu Jul 16 23:25:11 2015 UTC,I have done the exact same thing with my younger sister. (I was actually thinking of posting it here haha) but I think it stemmed from pure curiosity. My mother was always breastfeeding in front of the rest of us (why shouldnt she) and from a young age I would breastfeed my dolls. So when my little sister was born (i was 13) I was curious. I think as adults we tend to over sexualise things.

Guilt can manifest itself as a way to handle pressured responsibility, like ""you SHOULD feel guilty about this!"" and then people eventually do even if the act isn't as heinous as some people make it out to be. Guilt isn't a direct response to blame or fault; it's a tricky emotion. Don't make this so black and white, that's really irresponsible."

You have a job, so make a payment plan and pay your depts.yeah, you might screw up sometimes and still spend money you weren't supposed to spend, but partly, you'll get stuff paid and at least show a little good will to be responsible.   Break up or really work through your relationships with those men, but consider working on yourself before hurting the men you have relationship with and make sure they are healthy relationships.  Use a condom or take the pill instead of having abortions.  Like really, what's the deal? seek help for your anger and drinking. Therapy or counseling, aa meeting, talk to someone online on 7cups of tea or something like it.   You probably invest souch energy in all this negative stuff right now, change it doing stuff that will benefit you. It'll be tough at first but it'll be worth it.

It's true that it makes things easier, as far as social interaction goes.   But people are also attracted to confidence — even if it's faked, so long as it looks real, people tend to gravitate towards ""I know what the fuck I'm doing"" kind of body language. Which can definitely be attained by you — it is definitely possible.   Also, as far as limp dicks go, people can be into a whole bunch of things. Different breast sizes; whether or not the person has glasses; quite possibly even different nose sizes (I'm not so sure it actually makes a difference to most people). Either way, being beautiful would definitely be a plus, but beauty is only tied to what others (and yourself) think of you.

Of course just use this enough for the confidence, try not to actually be a dick. kill em with kindness. funky advice sorry if it's confusing).   Part 2 of this advice: sublime acne medication (r/skincareaddiction), WORK OUT daily (not only makes you look good makes you feel good -releasing happy endorphins), try mussing up your hair different or getting a new cut, get some new clothes that make you feel good, and get contacts.  Obviously if you try acne meds and working out for a week and get bored and stop, bring on the shittay.  If you try it for 3 weeks and stop you'll feel shitty after the 4th week when the workout glow fades.  Keep with it and make some beneficial changes and habits and see how you feel after a year of keeping with it.

Even if you did sense that it was 'naughty' you could not possibly have known how it would ultimately affect you and your family.  Bud it is PERFECTLY NORMAL for children to be curious about their body and the bodies of others.  I would go so far as to say that sexual play or pseudo-sexual play is very common in childhood.  Hell... I played games of 'if you show me yours I'll show you mine.' Lots of children do. It's almost a right of passage.  You CANNOT put an old head on young shoulders. You CAN'T look back in retrospect and think that you should have known better. You couldn't and you didn't.  PLEASE realize that this behaviour in children is far from unheard of. You need to find a way to forgive yourself and I hope your brother finds a way to forgive you too.
confession,3dh974,N4k3d,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:32:50 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I absolutely agree with everything you've posted, but I still struggle with the guilt. I think it's because my stepfather has twisted my childhood and condemned me so harshly to my siblings that it has now become a fear of mine that I am thought of as a predator. One day, my stepfather pretended to be my brother and he sent me a message saying ""I'll get you for what you did to me."" I know it wasn't my brother. This is a glimpse into the kind of behavior my stepfather engaged in around my siblings. I'm terrified that I'm thought of as a monster for something I honestly view as an immature mistake."

I think this may be quite normal, but maybe you should ask a professional to help you figure it all out. I think now that you're an adult, you are viewing it with adult feelings and emotions, but you shouldnt. You were 10 then! I'd really suggest speaking with a therapist. You shouldn't have this guilt at all. But that's my unprofessional opinion."
confession,3dh974,Lodi0831,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:39:03 2015 UTC,A therapist could definitely help. I also don't want to deny him his perception though. If he does view what happened as abuse I'm not prepared to dismiss it. I'll have to just accept his perception and heal from there. That makes me feel sick though.. having to allow him to think of me as an abuser.
confession,3dh974,Lodi0831,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:52:31 2015 UTC,I totally agree. But do you know his thoughts on it? Do you think he would be open to going to counseling with you just to get everything out in the open?

I hope you're able to resolve this within yourself. I don't think you're being fair to yourself. Makes me really sad for you, but I totally understand why you feel like you do. I'm sure that would be a very hard discussion to bring up, and I wonder if your therapist could reach out for you?   I still have guilt for things I did when I was a kid and it makes me cringe when I think about it. Kids can sometimes be assholes, but thinking about the things I did from an adult perspective sometimes makes me hate myself. I hate that I possibly hurt someone. I just tell myself that they probably don't even think about it. Still makes me sad though."
confession,3dh974,KazanaBoom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"would it be impossible to reach out to him?   Nah, it wouldn't.. but I don't know if that's smart. His father forcibly separated us and has been spreading lies about me and our side of the family for about a decade. I don't know how much of it my brother has believed or how he views me. He'll be 21 soon, and he seems like a smart guy, so he may be handling these things internally. When I briefly spoke to my sister she said he was an asshole so I shouldn't feel sad for not being able to talk to him, but I think it's because 1) she's 17 2) son/father relationships can strain brother/sister relationships and 3) he's much older. He may seem like an asshole to her, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's gone through his own personal hells. He didn't have the best relationship with his father from what I hear. His dad made them block me on Facebook, but I found out some time ago that I'm no longer blocked. I don't know what that means."

You apologized sincerely, there's really no more you can do.  It also doesn't show you being selfish. You're allowed to keep your own personality and ideas. Watching porn is fine. Not wanting to live somewhere is fine. You're both adults. If she didn't want to move with you, she should have made it clear."

I never heard of a man who did not watch porn (if he had access to it).  Not sure why some women make such a huge deal out of it. Just the fact that you feel so bad over the few things that happened shows that you are a very nice person.

That seemed to wake him up a bit, and he immediately started apologizing for not doing more around the house and thanking me up down and sideways for handling so much of our lives. But tonight when I said I wanted to clean and he asked how he could help and I suggested dusting he said he ""wasn't very good at it."" He's doing dishes now instead, which is something, I suppose, but just goes to show that saying and doing are two very different things. Idk. I'm going to look up free counseling services in my area tonight. I need to talk to someone objective in person about this.

confession,3dfnjm,asmodeuskraemer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:27:42 2015 UTC,"Hi OP, I'm really glad I read this. I had/have the exact same problem with my fiance. I love him so, so much and was really unhappy when I felt like I wasn't getting help around the house or being appreciated for what I did do. It took a really really long time for me to understand that it's OK for me to tell him how I feel (in a nice way, I had a really abusive upbringing so communication in a ""normal, nice"" way used to be goddamned impossible) and that I need more help around the house. We also talked a lot about sex and while we still don't have it as often as I'd like, I'm much more satisfied with communication.  As for ""not knowing how to dust"", I had to teach fiance how to Laundry when we moved in. He also didn't know how to use my canister vacuum and I had to show him. It's fucking stupid as shit that people don't teach their sons how to clean and that makes me really angry, but if be says he's not good at something, you can always tell him that it's a good time to learn. Also comprimise is good. Fiance doesn't like to do dishes which is OK with me as long as he does other things. I'm sure you understand/know all this but sometimes the anger and frustration can impede logical thinking. Sure does for me! I suggest that you sit him down and have a ""come to sexy, clean Jesus"" talk. If he's not willing to change to help you out, make your lives together happier and healthier, then you have your answer. To clarify, these aren't things you'd like of him, these are things you NEED from him. Be sure to use that specific language.  I hope it all goes well for you!"

I do try my best to communicate clearly with him when it comes to these things, but I know that our relationship so far has been very forgiving and lenient as we've both needed time to grow and learn as people. But we're not kids anymore and I think we have wildly different priorities. And as for the dusting thing, I offered to teach him, and he got kind of salty about it. Which isn't the first time. When I've come to him about things I'd like to work on in the past, he usually gets pissy and doesn't want to talk to the point where I can physically see him withdrawing into himself and I have to try very, very hard to get him to even talk about things or voice his opinion. Even when I use ""we,"" even when I say ""I feel"" instead of ""you"" even when I say ""and"" instead of ""but."" He still gets sensitive to the point that he almost won't talk. He says I should just keep talking to him and he'll come around, but my god! Is this going to be the rest of our lives? Me saying ""I feel like we could work on X together, what do you think of Y and Z?"" And him being mopey for a while, coming around a bit, backsliding, and me landing back at square one a few months later trying to iniate the same damn conversation again? Ugh! I'm just full. And more than anything I'm tired of feeling like I'm carrying this relationship.  Sigh. These big decisions are never easy. And our lives are so thoroughly entwined that a breakup would be more like a divorce, even though we're not married yet. I really don't want to throw it all away.

This street goes both ways. What has he done to help you become the best person you can be? I'm guessing not a lot since you're on this subreddit asking for advice about this. If you've attempted to get him to change so that he can become the best person he can be and won't, that's all you can do. If he's preventing you from being the best person you can be (a happy, fulfilled individual), then it's time to find someone who can appreciate you and grow with you in the present.  Remember. You are responsible for your own happiness. Only you can make the changes that will require you to be happy.

confession,3dfnjm,bajapanty69,2,Thu Jul 16 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"Call it off. Immediately. Apologize to the friends and family for the cancellation, they don't need to know the reasons. (They can adjust their flights or just come for a big party to celebrate your new life, whatever.) Your issue is not sexual incompatibility, it is completely incompatible lifestyles. What you've described is pretty typical of a 'first real relationship', where one partner expects to become a parent and the other expects to still have a parent and they fit for a while until the responsible one (you) realizes the bullshit.  Unfortunately, this isn't the sort of thing that can change. He is who he is, you are who you are. Momentum will prevent that from changing while you're still together. I'm sorry. I'm pretty sure you already know that.  As for the middle class bit, that's amazing. Nowadays basically nobody gets ahead. However you might be interested to learn that 'class' is a matter of lifestyle, manner, manners, and inclinations. Income has very little to do with it. From your vocabulary, apparent responsibility, and sense of social obligation, I'd like to formally welcome you to the middle class. =)  But seriously, the biggest economic difference between lower and middle is what money is spent on. Lower class buys weed and pays for the cable deluxe package, middle class buys coffee and pays for Netflix. (The latter group ends up having a lot more discretionary funds which can go towards savings, college courses, or unexpected car repairs, which improves the debt:equity ratio, which is a sign of economic stability.) Another economic lesson (from someone with an MBA) is 'sunk cost'. This matters for both time and money. What has been spent is gone, both for your years and dollars. You spent 10 years and learned a lot about yourself, your preferences, your likes and dislikes. Great. You can't get that back. Do you put more years into the slot machine, more money on the table betting black? Or do you leave the casino? Statisticians only play blackjack, because every hand has improved odds. You've been doubling down for 10 years instead of calling new hands. You can either do so for the rest of your life, or walk away.  If you're looking for housing, check crime maps. Always go for better safety over better price - Shady characters walking around shifts people into 'fight or flight' mode which impedes rational decision making. Broken windows, shouting neighbors, 3am bass-drops - All of that crap just undermines peace of mind. Welcome to the middle class, we have statistics and police immunity. (Not really, but it sounds cool.)  I wish you the best of luck!"

We've been married now for many years.  She is full of rage and resentment.  I've made many changes--do much more housework, try to work together as a team.    The sexual incompatibility is really tough, though.  She takes it as rejection.  In reality, it's just really low sex drive; we've discovered I have really low testosterone levels (well below normal).  Even knowing that, she takes it personally.  I take prescription testosterone, and it helps, but it's not enough.  If you can, get your fiancé to have his T levels checked.  We're in counseling together, but her rage is so profound I don't know if it can be fixed.  Our counselor said she didn't think she could help us and wanted to refer us to someone else the last time we saw her.  We still love each other.  The situation is very heartbreaking for both of us.  I say all this out of concern for you both and to provide support.  Can he make changes?  Yes, I did.  Are there possibly underlying physical issues that can be addressed? Yes, possibly.  My wife nonetheless over the years more and more told me how I was disappointing her and became more and more angry.  The changes I made didn't seem sufficient to overcome her anger.  And I did fall back into old habits from time to time.  It's hard for a leopard to change its spots.

confession,3dbgee,AbCynthia956,4,Wed Jul 15 21:25:08 2015 UTC,"Can totally relate to that - and to OP, and to u/StillAnAss.  Just got out of a 27-year relationship where the last few years were exactly how you all described.  I couldn't stand going home, I was just existing from day to day, hoping things would get better.  They didn't.  I even planned how to off myself in an 'accident' (the road I drove to work crosses a very isolated and precipitous moorland, and there was a rock just at the side of the road, in exactly the right place) but every time I drove past it there was oncoming traffic.  The disappointment I felt in myself for not going through with that made me get my shit together and leave. OP, try to remember what you were like before you met her.  Listen to your own music, listen to bands you liked before you met her, start doing things again that you liked to do before you met her.  Cultivate your own sense of self as a separate person, and remember that a marriage does not define a person, rather the other way round.  Think of your younger self meeting you in the street and asking you what the fuck you're doing.  Think of yourself on your deathbed, despising yourself for wasting your life on this woman when all she did was drain you. One of my problems was admitting in the main that I had made a mistake in marrying her - it's easy to say the words, but to actually admit it deep down is cathartic.  Once you have done that, once you have regained contact with your old self (which does still live inside you, no matter how cramped or neglected), your strength will come.  It is better to live on your own than to put  up with the shit that you appear to be suffering.  It is not easy, it is scary, but being alone must be better than that daily torture."

O_o   To address OP, I decided in my early twenties I wasn't going to ever marry anyone to avoid this situation entirely. Nothing about married life - constant intimacy, compromise, conflict - speaks to a life experience I want to have.   But if I was in YOUR situation, OP, I would get the fuck outta there.

And I knew I did not want to be with this person but it was so hard to be alone. And then when I learned how to be alone, it was hard to be with another person. Life is short but it is lawn when you're in the wrong situation. Only you can decide what is more valuable to you but if you really don't like your relationship and don't feel you are growing or happy in it, Think about the next however many years. Do you want to be there for all those years? Do you want to die in that relationship? Those were the questions I ask myself and personally, it was extremely difficult, but I left. Leaving was not easy. Learning how to live alone was not easy. Learning how to date again is not easy. But it can happen. And it can be better than what you had. And maybe, I can't speak for everyone but for me, being alone was better than being in a relationship I did not want to be in. Good luck hope op."

I almost died that day. I loved her absolutely until that moment.   My advice....  Go do your own thing for a while. Go do hobbies you love and go to events you love. Eat at restaurants that are your favorite and listen to your favorite albums everyday, multiple times if you can.   You won't be lonely if you love yourself. You just have to remember the awesome guy you really are inside.  The ladies will follow, and you'll be worth it to them. Fine taste in food, music, hobbies, events, etc...

We separated and I realized that the only reason I was alone was because she was my wife. Without her around I was able to build a life that I love, make friends that I enjoy being around, and do things that bring me joy.   Just leave, let those around you know that you're newly free, you'll find that invitations to things will come your way. All those after work events that you only heard about? You can be there. Parties with adults? You can go to those. Maybe you're introverted, maybe your not. I thought I was, turns out that I'm not. Even if you are, opportunities will still come your way.

Now that you are in your 40s,  the dynamics have turned on the male vs female courtship end of things.  The odds are in your favor.  As long as you get out there and do it. Please, please,  see a therapist and take steps to improving your life.  Start putting money on the side in a new account so you can find a place of your own and save up for an attorney. Having a therapist will definitely help your loneliness.  If you have to,  get massages so you can have that physical contact you crave.  Join a dating website and just start going out on dates just to be around other people.  You can do it."

My emotions got the better of me, I gave up, I am ready to move on and my childs illness will never change so I watch him all happy, while I feel like a failure, but now I realise that the only thing stopping me is myself, and low self esteem from years of internal stress and trying to keep my emotions together as best as I could, but I need people around me to keep me motivated whereas before the problems, I didn't need anyone, so I figured I lost my self worth, my mojo, you had mojo before you met her, so try and reconnect to the old you. I am doing the old things I use to do before my child like reading, swimming etc... to reconnect to the stronger me and returning to study at 40, so if I can do it at 40, you've got a few more years advantage to me, so don't give up on your self just because of her. Don't feel bad, self hate anymore or feel like you failed when it was her actions that created a part of your result. My childs illness is part of my result, that's reality, but It's in the past and when you're ready, you have to let it go, be SELFISH.... believe in planning and knowing you deserve as many chances as it takes. I did get this mind set that I'm going to fail again, but I can see, you and I are planners, life altered our course of direction, we fell down, but we're optimistic, because deep down inside we sublimely refuse to give up, that's why the fail and regret feeling is persistent, ignore the negative voices trying to predict the future, these voices are not true, before my child I was confident, free and did everything I set out to do, so beam that old smile you use to wear, before your ex came along with her lies, she's living with her lie, keep your soft heart untangled and away from relationships, it's too much of a distraction, get up!  your conscience and gut feeling tells us don't give up.

But call girls do and can make way more than we're charging. They can make as much as 5,500 an hour. It's just that usually they work for agencies in NY and so a lot of those goes to commission/fees.

The only problem I have ever had was from the men's bathroom was that we sometimes had graffiti in there but my boss told me to leave it as it would take too much time to clean off. The women's bathroom on the other hand, my god. At one point they had actually smashed and broken the automatic flushing thingy (can't remember the word, I'm tired, it's 2:46 am) and the toilet wouldn't flush. Now that wouldn't be too difficult to fix, except they didn't stop using the toilet and it was a horrible mess by the time I found out about it. It was like someone had died and no matter how much bleach I used the smell just wouldn't go away. Something similar happened to the public restroom on the sales floor only this time the toilet overflowed and guess who had to clean it. The only other thing that really stands out besides general nastiness has got to be when the bathroom flooded but it wasn't dirty. Somehow when somebody say on the toilet or maybe even over time the toilet bowl had completely cracked and was leaking pretty bad. Had to get a whole new toilet."

He was the first pet I ever thought of as mine (even if he was ""ours"") and that I ever had that kind of bond with.  I was fortunate enough that we had Buddy's sister, Mitsy. So she was virtually buried with attention and affection from us. But it was a few days before I could even look at his favorite toys or his favorite spots without the pain being too much. It's like losing any other close family member. It's OK to grieve.  Eventually we were able to bring a couple more members into our family, including Harvey, which also helped. I'm well aware, though, that all that does is guarantee I'm going to feel that all over again someday. But it helps to give Harvey what I can't give Buddy anymore. It took a little more time really be able to do that, though.  I took some of his favorite toys to sit on my desk at work. That helped a lot. And I have a few of his things on my dresser to see every morning, too. He's gone, but I still have his favorite things to remember him with.  Keep a few of Iggy's favorite things around to help remind yourself of the happiness that you were able to give him. It's sad that he's gone and you can't give him more right now, but don't forget how awesome it was that you got the chance to give him what you did and how happy that made him. Your own happiness was just icing on that cake.  And do take time to grieve. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. But it'll get better. It will never go away. You'll always miss him. But for now, take care of yourself and just try to remember that, sure, all lives have to end eventually but that you had the privilege of making sure that Iggy's was a good one."

He seemed ok after coming home from the hospital and just yesterday got worse. The disease is painful and incurable and I hate seeing him in pain.

confession,3d8nzp,Maven3,3,Tue Jul 14 11:45:44 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you are going through this.  My first cat, MoMo was the sweetest creature on the planet and we had him for eleven years after a very rough beginning for him.  It amazed us how sweet he could be after what he'd been through.  Putting him to sleep was a decision we really struggled with.  We tried to keep him going for as long as possible with hydration treatment, and you could just tell he was suffering.  The drive to the vet to put him down was incredibly difficult.  He climbed into my lap, and he wasn't a lap cat by nature.  It was heartbreaking.  I mourned him for months.  Now I have two beautiful cats, one of which was hit by a car last year and we paid thousands to treat.  He's doing great now, but everyday I worry about the day we're going to have to say goodbye.  We first adopted him in China when we were living there for a few years and then he flew over the Pacific ocean with us when we moved back to the states.  He's been our companion through so much.  But when he goes, he'll be making room for another cat that needs us.  I know that's so difficult to think about right now, but there are so many amazing, beautiful creatures out there that have so much love to give, and they are patiently waiting for their turn to have a place in someone's home and heart.  I think Iggy Cat would want to pass on his inheritance of your love to another cat in need.  All he has to give is his place in your heart."

You are doing him a wonderful service that most cats don't have the luck to benefit from.   The reason I keep getting more cats despite the sadness their losses bring is because I imagine them sitting in a shelter somewhere not being adopted just because someone was too afraid of being hurt when they pass. I don't know if Iggy Cat was a shelter baby before you got him or not, but I can't imagine MoMo rotting away in a shelter forever and never having the chance to live and be loved properly. It's not fair to them. We can't protect ourselves from being hurt in life, we just have to embrace the joy we get and bear the pain fully and completely.

He would follow me all around the house, we would play games where I would peak around the corner and he would bolt towards me then run away. I would get him pretty high on catnip and he would play with all his toes while rolling around in the cat drugs. Fast forward to his last day at my house. I was with my ex-gf from the time hanging at my house, and I went out of my room to get a drink. Upon reaching the stairs I saw Bubba just laying there awkwardly. His legs were both behind him as if he was dragging himself. It took a few times trying to maneuver him to realize that he has become paralyzed from the waist down. I was heartbroken. This was the second let that I have lost and definitely the worst. He was there for me from when I began first grade until just after I graduated high school. My parents brought him to the vet and I just stayed at home with my girlfriend pretty much crying uncontrollably. They called me and told me I had a chance to go say goodbye to him. I mustered up the courage to drive down to the vet and see him one last time. I am so greatful I did because looking back it would have been a huge regret for me. But anyways, I arrived at the vet, trying to hold back more tears as I walked into the room. He sees me, and tries to crawl/drag himself under a chair (he was placed on the floor for some reason). This killed me, because I knew that he knew it was his time. Animals will try to go away from their loved ones when it's their time. I picked him up and held in and said my goodbyes as I started to cry again. It was a very unexpected experience but that is life. I wish I could hear him purr one last time. It gets easier OP, just make sure you say your final goodbye no matter how hard it will be."

I'm also of the firm belief that therapists should never have romantic/sexual relationships with former patients, regardless of how much time has elapsed after the therapy.  I personally don't think it's the place of the licensing boards to go much further on this issue than they already have (with the time limits), but it's something that I don't ever think is healthy.  What I was referring to was what your lecturer said: ""She also taught as that the moment a patient discloses sexual or romantic feelings we have to end therapy and recommend someone else.""  As I said in my other comment which I still think you should read, it is potentially a hugely important development for a patient to develop feelings for the therapist.  At the very least, it is not something that should necessarily result in a termination of therapy, and certainly it isn't something that should always result in a termination of therapy."
confession,3d5l09,Rain12913,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:29:03 2015 UTC,"I see where youre coming from. I think maybe my lecturer was being overly cautious? I dont know how common it is but i can see someone potentially getting into trouble. For example say a patient devlops feelings for you, its recorded in your notes and an allegation is made either by the patient or the patients spouse/family. I can see a scenario where the very first question is ""why didnt you immediately terminate therapy and recommend someone else?"".   Like i said maybe my lecturer is overly cautious or has had some bad experiences in their professional career? I had another lecturer tell us that personally she wouldnt recommend anyone treat someone with anti social pd or borderline pd. Then explained her experiences with such patients. I guess what im trying to say is their personal biases might have come across in their teachings rather than whats in the syllabus?"
confession,3d5l09,slimmsy,6,Wed Jul 15 02:42:07 2015 UTC,"As a psychologist/therapist, I want to add to that: it is indeed true that most licensing boards for therapists designate a certain period of time that must elapse before a therapist is permitted to become romantically or sexually involved with a former patient (and this period of time varies).  However, waiting that amount of time does not at all mean that the therapist's career won't be very seriously damaged by something like this.    Most therapists have bosses (whether they work in a small private practice, a community clinic, or a large hospital), and a relationship with a patient - even if it conforms to the licensing board's ethical guidelines - will in most cases get the therapist fired.  Employer's simply can't risk a liability like that, and will often have this policy set in stone.    Furthermore, it's important to remember that this is a business where reputation is king.  Depending on the area, the community of therapists can be an incredibly insular one, and once word gets around that a therapist has had a relationship with their patient, it's going to be tremendously difficult for them to find a job anywhere.  Even if they elect to start their own private practice, a large portion of patient referrals come from other therapists, and people won't refer patients to a therapist who has had sex with a former patient.  In short: this will have a strongly negative effect on the therapist's career regardless of the time frame."

Before making any major decisions, OP should tell his therapist about what has happened.  As odd as it may sound, some of the best work in therapy comes during moments like this when the client and therapist are pushed to discuss their feelings for one another.  In many types of psychotherapy, a client's feelings of attraction towards their therapist can even be a critically important development in the therapeutic process.  While there are certainly times when such feelings can impede the goals of therapy, it would be a terrible shame if people simply found a new therapist anytime they started feeling attracted to their current one."

confession,3d5l09,congratsyougotsbed,29,Mon Jul 13 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy to explain what I mean.  This will be kind of long, so bear with me.  For many decades, a school of thought called psychoanalysis reigned supreme in psychotherapy.  One of the major tenants of psychoanalytic theory is something called ""transference.""  Wikipedia defines it quite well as ""a phenomenon characterized by unconscious redirection of feelings from one person to another.""  Essentially, psychoanalytic theory (and many others) posit that the way we think and feel about people is largely based on the ways that we've thought and felt about other people from our past.  According to this theory, we unconsciously take little shortcuts in order to gain some form of mastery when it comes to interacting with other people.  In doing so, we protect ourselves from a whole lot of pain by modifying our expectations and changing our behavior to suit what we anticipate the needs of the relationship will be.    For example, if we've had past experiences with police officers who have treated us very well and with respect, then we'll tend to approach new relationships with other police officers with the expectation that we'll be treated in the same way.  Even before meeting a new police officer, we might already feel quite positively about him, because we're redirecting (transferring) some of our previous feelings from one person to the next based on our appraisal that the new one is similar to the old one.  Over time, we come to accumulate a whole bunch of these little emotional/interpersonal shortcuts and expectations, and they shape the way we form new relationships.  This enables us to approach relationships with various types of people with somewhat of a ""head start,"" and gives us a roadmap of sorts for how we ought to conduct a relationship with them.  However, there are times when this process can negatively influence our ability to have healthy relationships.  The classic psychoanalytic example of this would be a person who was abused by her father at a young age.  Such a person might develop the unconscious expectation that men will hurt her, and this might continue to shape her relationships with men for the rest of her life.  In therapy, the goal is to modify these ""harmful"" transferences so that new relationships can be approached with more openness.  One way of doing this, according to psychoanalytic thinkers, is to encourage the transference to manifest in the relationship between the client and therapist.  Once this happens, it can be broken down and reconstructed.  In the previously mentioned example, the therapist would be watching closely for signs that the client unconsciously identifies the therapist with her father, and that she is, accordingly, treating him as a ""father figure.""  By identifying this transference, the therapist and client would be able to ""work out"" the unresolved feelings of anger that the client has towards her father (who may or may not be alive), and ideally these feelings would have less of a negative impact on her relationships with other men.  To draw this back to the notion that feelings of attraction in therapy might be a positive development: therapists who subscribe to this theory might hypothesize that a client's feelings of attraction towards them are a manifestation of transference.  They might posit that some old feelings that the client has towards another person in their life are being unconsciously activated in therapy because the therapist has somehow - again, unconsciously - reminded the client of that original person.  Therefore, by exploring this idea openly with the client, the hope is that these feelings can be worked out and the client will be able to free themselves of some old ""defective shortcuts"" in their relationships outside of therapy.  Psychoanalysis is no longer widely practiced, but one of its theoretical successors - psychodynamic therapy - remains quite popular.  Even more broadly, most therapists who draw from a variety of theoretical inspirations (which makes up the majority of them) would have this idea in their toolbox.  So, yes, many therapists would consider what OP is describing to be a potentially important development in therapy."
confession,3d5l09,Rain12913,9,Tue Jul 14 00:38:19 2015 UTC,"Another part of this is that you are supposed to re-experience a parental relationship with your therapist and then get through it in some good way--by feeling accepted by your therapist. So you transfer your feelings as a child to the therapist. The therapist is actually supposed to have some feelings towards you (which they can handle as a very mature adult--hopefully much better than your parents). Then, you kind of re-live your feelings the way they should have happened in childhood but instead everything is good and positive and you are accepted and loved for yourself and then you are kind of healed in some way.  Note: Not a therapist. This is a very crude explanation."

confession,3d5l09,mrcaptncrunch,2,Tue Jul 14 00:41:47 2015 UTC,It's something to do with freud and pushing your feelings onto the therapist. Projection I think it's called. So for example if you have an anger issue you then become angry at the therapist or if you lost your mother as a child the therapist fulfils that role and you project your feelings about your mother on the therapist. I presume it's something to do with that.

The same catastrophic importance was hammered into my mind all my life as well, and when I had sex at 20 I was let down at how much it didn't actually matter. It's not some mystical life milestone. All it is is shoving one body part inside of another. (Barring obvious preventable complications like STDs or pregnancy. You know what I mean)  Additionally, by putting sex on a pedestal, you're placing an enormous obligation on your spouse to fill this probably impossible expectation you've built up.  Most importantly, please consider that sex is a popular method of control that adults and other leaders use to keep you in an ""us versus them"" mental box. It is control. You have already demonstrated how this opinion on sex is controlling your entire future! Control sex = control a life.  Lastly, is it possible you're more interested in sticking to your guns out of pride and wanting to be successful?  Good luck man. I used to be just like you.  (P.S. There is also the possibility you're asexual and don't know it yet, if sex is unusually easy to ignore. Asexuality is an orientation where you don't experience sexual attraction to men or women.)"

What if sticking a pinecone up your butt gets you off, but she thinks its horrible?  What if anything/everything is a turn off for you/them?

confession,3dasua,poisonivysoar,2,Tue Jul 14 20:53:34 2015 UTC,"The first thing I would suggest that you do is to google a clip made by the World Health Organization that is called Black Dog Depression. It gives some really good, hands on advice on how to work through things. It is not a substitute for counseling (which is free for college students and you should go to one when in college)  but take a look at the clip because it contains readily available tips that can help a great deal.   Create an exercise program. Let us say for example, you decide to jog everyday for like half an hour or an hour or so. This is simple and it is not. It is simple because it is just one task that you have to do, it is not because it will require effort and discipline. After a while, you will begin to notice that you are successful in your efforts and you will be proud of yourself and begin to get more and more confident. Confidence is a very attractive quality in a person. Look into something called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This simply means being aware of your thoughts and countering the negative thoughts with positive. Like you say, that you will never find someone who loves you. Counter that with saying that you will find someone who loves you. If you start saying, I can't do this, counter that by saying, I can do this, etc. Find your own special way to express your feelings. Everyone has that special something that when they do, everything ceases to exist. I like to write. My sister plays the guitar. My mother likes to go for long rides with her bike. Everyone has something that works for them and if you do not know what works for you, then it because you have not found it. This, then, would be an exciting time because now you can go 'shopping'. Like I said, I advocate for creative arts. There are many online schools that offer a trial course of 4 weeks with full refund. There are also many schools that offer musical lessons where the first lesson is free. You can try out the creative arts until you find what works for you. Personally, I would describe these activities are being more active than passive, so binge watching Lost, Last Airbender, Breaking Bad, Dr Who and all your favorite shows on netflix and other sources should not make it in your list of things to try. I also understand that some people like to shop when they are stressed, but if finances are the cause of your stress or you are an impulse buyer or you have a tendency of maxing out your credit card, then retail therapy should most definitely not make into your list of things to try out. My point is, find something that allows you to express yourself on a constant basis, so that when those pressure moments arise, you do not say things that you will later regret.   These changes work and I know they work because they have worked with me. These tips work, but you gotta stick with it. I started working on it years ago and it was almost a year before I got to see any tangible results. Now I can barely imagine being the person I was.  At first, there is the initial euphoria when you begin. You are starting something new and you can already see the new life in your head. At some point, the euphoria begins to become less and less. This is nothing more than the honeymoon period of starting something new and exciting begins to end. Now what will keep you going is the discipline that is left. You just have to keep going."

Plus, as a boy, there's all this macho bullshit about how you're not supposed to have emotions (except manly rage), or express them if you do. That's enough pressure to grind anyone down.  I strongly suggest going to see a counselor or therapist. It can be hard, especially since there's so much stigma around seeking mental health help. But it's really no different that going to see a doctor because your knee hurts. You don't have to tell anyone else that you're seeing them.  If you're in college you can probably get free help there. Please look into it as soon as you're able. You'll find it's much easier to go through life once you have someone in your corner who's got your best interests in mind for once."

I'm sorry for your loss.   Ten years ago, my grandmother lost her husband. She went from being relatively lucid and capable to infantile and incapable of moving without assistance, inside of a year. My family did the hospice routine at home, taking turns caring for her. It's that quick. It's that hard.  She passed away the day before I was supposed to go back to college. Like the fucking masochistic idiot that I am, I went back to school instead of taking the semester off to cope with the loss of a family member. My grades plummeted, because who really gives a fuck about tests when you've seen someone you loved expire in front of you?   Do not make the same mistake. Call your adviser and tell them you're taking care of your dying mother. Ask them who else you need to notify. Admissions, Records, Financial Aid, all of your professors for the courses you're planning to take, your department head, everyone and anyone who should know you're going to take a semester off. There's nothing wrong with taking a semester off, especially for this reason. You'll get your head back in the game when you're ready.   They may even recommend people to talk to. Take them up on it and talk to them. It'll help.   Your mother may die very soon. It sounds like it is. Be ready, it can be sudden, or you might see the signs and prepare. Either way, you are doing what billions of people have been doing for thousands of years before you; taking care of the people who loved and raised you through their final days.   You'll be ok, OP."

If he didn't want you to come, he wouldn't have asked.   Third. If you want to be a professional sex worker, look up and contact the brothels in Nevada. Start with the Mustang Ranch and the Moonlite Bunny Ranch they're the most famous. I've been told there are waiting lists, background checks and such; it's a job like anything else.

But I'd also encourage you to try to be introspective about the root of these feelings and why they make you feel guilty. Are you lonely? Do you feel inadequate or rejected by those you spend time with, or are you generally supported by those around you? Do you see yourself as deserving of love and friendship? Let these questions take you where they will, and be painfully honest with yourself. Then you can take those conclusions and grow from them.   Talk to someone you trust, too -- saying the words out loud to someone you trust will put things in a new perspective.

You're not responsible for the decisions he made, and you're not responsible for fixing them either.  If his life was ruined - and that's only what you feel, not what may actually be the case - then it was ruined by him alone.   NOBODY has a mandate to exist. Each one of us is a weird and wonderful accident, the result of countless trillions of coincidences and chance interactions, stretching back to the Big Bang. You have no more or less right to exist than someone who was conceived after years of IVF by parents who spent their whole lives wanting a child.  Better still, you were clearly born with your share of brains, if you're able to be this introspective and eloquent. So focus that intelligence on yourself, and work out what you want to do to make your own life great.   If you're still in school, do what you can to ace your exams. Apply for EVERY scholarship, bursary or other support payment (I'm assuming your fuckup parents aren't loaded and able to pay for your education themselves). Your background probably opens you up to a bunch of them. Research them NOW, because they often require you to apply well in advance.  I'm not saying that because university educations are completely awesome, I'm saying it because getting your parents out of your life ASAP would be a very good thing for you. It's hard to become your own person when you're stuck with your parents, and harder still if they're not supportive or have negative emotional effects on you.   If you don't want to go to university or can't for some reason, that doesn't in any way preclude you from having a great life. Just focus on finding a career path that will provide you with financial and personal independence. If possible, move to another city.   Or look into getting work abroad. If you're not already in the US (not clear on where you moved to, but you say ""mom""?) Camp America will let you spend a summer helping kids at a holiday camp, and give you the money and visa to travel there a little bit after. You could also look into teaching English abroad - it's not a long-term career, but getting out of your parents' hair (and vice versa) could be a very useful thing, and give you the room to grow and develop as a person.  Also, wherever you go, put in the effort to find like-minded people. What are your hobbies? Try to find (or even start!) book groups, art classes, film societies and similar casual events for enthusiasts. A wider social circle means a wider support group. There may be listings magazines and websites in your home city that reveal some options - or if there's a subreddit about your city you could ask there.  Hope none of this sounds too harsh, but you shouldn't let other people define your life for you. You especially shouldn't let other people turn you into an emotional punching bag. Feel free to PM me or reply here if you want me to elaborate on any of this."

Countries all owe money so if you run out you can't pay it back and might get kicked out. Greece have been all like ""you guys, come on..."" and those guys, headed by Germany (who not entirely unsuspiciously are in charge somehow) were going ""no, you all have to be poor and have shit lives and pay us back"", to which Greece responded by electing these dudes whose gameplan was to wind everyone up by making Greeks officially not want to spend generations in the financial doldrums, thereby making it harder for Europe to be hardcore with them. It has been pointed out that Greece voted to let Germany off with quite a lot of debt because it was all for the greater good sometime shortly post WWII, and that Germany did a right number on Greece financially during the war itself, so maybe people should be cool with Greece now. In the end, they figured something out, which might be called a compromise.  As far as the coverage goes, it was always fairly obvious the compromise would be reached, because the confidence in Europe if it failed would be catastrophic in world markets. It's just that each side had to be as lairy as possible right up to (and slightly past) the last minute, because egos. All of which meant the press were able to go on and on and fucking on about it like they do with every big issue that'll probably just get sorted eventually because that's what politicians do and if they didn't, we'd lynch the cunts.   tl;dr - storm in an ouzo glass.

We all have such times and I just have to push through. I deal with stuff by writing it down.  In your other post, you said that another person was suing the company for the exact same reason. Can you find out who it is and team up with him? That will make your case stronger. If you are where you I think you are (which is a country in the middle east) you will have no chance going against your employer, unless you have connections to an equally strong or even stronger family than they come from. You could, however, have a better chance if you teamed up with the other person you are working for.  Work with your current family member to get some connections so you can sell your furniture at a reasonable price and not get cheated to selling them for much lower.

confession,3d3eo4,AgeOfWomen,10,Mon Jul 13 08:32:36 2015 UTC,"Let me put it this way, there is no family higher up.   I was concerned this would be the case. DO NOT team up with the other guy. Whoever that person is, is as good as unemployable in the entire country.  Also, sell your furniture through connections. If you put them on the internet and if people know you are desperate, you will be taken for everything you have gotten.  It is really now time to reconnect with the ""right"" shoulders that you have brushed in a tactful way. Many westerners like to be direct, but this can come off as offensive to some people so be sure to always start with some banal chit-chat about....life or stuff. Create a rapport and even if your life depends on it, do not talk negatively about your former employer and employment, even with friends or even as just chit chat, especially with your connections. I know it is standard universal knowledge, but as you have now experienced, in some countries, there are some families that you always want to be on their good side.  It is a half waiting game, half reconnecting. Yes, take each day at a time, and at the same time, reconnect with those connections in a friendly manner. You can invite one out to lunch or something and chat about normal stuff, then casually mention how you are looking for a job in a chatty way. In many cases westerners like to be direct, but in some cultures, being so direct comes off as cold and unfriendly, as if you are just using your connections but have no genuine concern for them. Does that make sense?  If your family member has been in that country for long, you can sit with him/her and start to get a feel of how the culture works.   It is all about connections and knowing the right kind of people."

Problem is, if I have any outstanding debts in the county I'll stay jailed until I clear them, which I don't have any debts unless my employer decides to make a false claim against me, which I've been informed that he can do.  You're right about the media, I post all of this through multiple proxies. People can't seem to fathom that things are a little different in other parts of the world. I've mentioned it before, speaking out against your employer publicly gets you jail time here. Westerners have gone to jail over Facebook posts."
confession,3d3eo4,hicctl,2,Mon Jul 13 15:40:18 2015 UTC,"While you are waiting, you should also work out a strategy for the worst case scenario. Ok, you do have a lot of debt, but is there any way for you to work it out so you can pay in rates? Is there anything that can be reduced? Start making phone calls and look for ways to sell your furniture, but at a reasonable rate. Make sure you do this with connections.   What about your relatives? What about the people you have come to know? Do not ask them for favors on how to deal with your boss, rather how to unload your furniture. You have a kid? If you are close enough with someone who is powerful, make a play date or a family day out. You do not have to do something extravagant. You can just go out for a picnic or something and when you are there, casually mention that you are looking to unload furniture and if they know something who is looking to buy something, then they can contact you.  The best example I can think if it is in the movie Wolf of Wall Street. When Jordan Belfort  goes to Switzerland to do business, he immediately wants to talk business after meeting the banker. The banker then tells him that in Switzerland, normally before business is done, there is 10 minutes of blah, blah, blah. If you understand the Swiss culture, Jordan Belfort comes of as very rude. It is the same here, even with business. There is a certain line you need to navigate in order to be successful and maintain friendships.  So, prepare for the worst case scenario, that is he cancels you and you have outstanding debts, and start liquidating. If you want to do this effectively, then do it over connections. If you want to do it successfully, then learn to navigate the culture."

I am assuming he got butt hurt by the fact that you, in one way or the other, did not kiss his ass. So he is trying to show you who is boss (even though it may ruin your life, I know, I know, but such is the ego of some rich people who think they are untouchable). On the other hand, for him to demand that you repay your salary would be considered as weak and petty.

Maybe she's just not into dressing ""like a girl"", as you say, but I think you should take a second to think about what she wants, instead of just thinking of her as a being to follow your whims. No offense, but if you're willing to end a two year relationship because you're unhappy that your girlfriend doesn't follow social customs the way you want her to, I think she'd be better off without you. Maybe just keep in mind for the next time you get in a relationship that everyone is their own person. Everyone doesn't follow social customs, and everyone definitely doesn't act the way you think they should act."

confession,3d2h2j,Mooglemonkey,2,Mon Jul 13 07:39:20 2015 UTC,"You're feeling guilty about this and don't want to tell her about it because it would make you look shallow. I think that means that you probably are focusing on this issue for a deeper reason. Probably you are just falling out of love with her and her fashion choices are just starting to irritate you because it's the easiest thing to pick up on. Because really, if you were in love with her, you probably wouldn't be ready to dump her without even broaching the reason with her.   There's nothing wrong with falling out of love with someone and calling things off for that reason. That's far preferable to trying to force a passionless relationship. So think about it. If she dressed better would you feel like she was someone you could spend your life with?"
confession,3d2h2j,Natty_Ice,2,Mon Jul 13 13:07:04 2015 UTC,"Female here. I think you can do this and make it into a fun activity. My gf and myself love to get new clothes but we don't have much of a budget for it so what do we do? THRIFT SHOPPING!   Take your girl to  a couple of thrift stores and each of you pick out three outfits for the other person to wear. This gives you the opportunity to pick out something that you would like to see her wearing and she has the freedom to do the same to you. Try on the outfits and ultimately each of you will have the ultimate say in which one goes with you when you leave, be sure to leave the ultimate decision up to her of which of the three outfits she likes. Also, be sure to pick up the tab on this one. Once you have each jointly chosen an outfit for each other, go home and wash the outfits while you get ready for.... date night! Keep it simple on the date, you want to encourage her to step out off her comfort zone but you don't want to push her out into it. Maybe hit up a small pizza joint and go for a round of putt putt or a dollar movie. Compliment her, let her know how attracted you are to her and tell her what you like about the outfit that she picked out for you and encourage her to do the same.  In the end, remember that fashion is fun but it isn't everything and there is a good chance that if you ever decide to have children, the lady who is with you (whomever she may be) will probably be posted up in sweatpants and t-shirts for a long while afterwards if not indefinitely."
confession,3d2h2j,Mooglemonkey,7,Mon Jul 13 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"I know I'll get downvoted to hell for saying this, but please don't feel guilty. Clothes and style connote a great deal about our mating choices. This is why appearance driven apps like Tinder are so popular. Wanting a fashionable mate, or at least one with more of a sense of fashion is not inherently shallow;  its biologically driven. It didnt bother you two years ago but you are not the exact same person you were then, neither is she, and neither is your relationship. My impression of non-girly girls is that they are low maintenance. If that is true for her and an important quality in a partner for you, be prepared for a change. I'm very girly, and pretty demanding. Just being honest. Not like like bat shit crazy and extremely unreasonable, but I in turn have demands of my partners others might consider superficial. But, after knowing this, you still think the pros outweigh the cons and want to leave her, god speed. As far as those saying help her, well I think that takes away from a woman's goddessness and mystery. With the plethora of information out there, women who are so inclined have figured out how to be more stylish. With all the advertising geared towards women, it's darn near impossible not to. Also, while making changes for a partner can strengthen a relationship, it can also lead to resentment. And knowing how sensitive women are about looks (because we kinda have to be) you're taking a huge gamble if you ask her to change."

She went from being a girl that was always dressed up in cute skirts and dresses, particularly one very tight sweater dress I LOVED. When she came back from college one year, she had gotten rid of almost all of those outfits, wore exclusively yoga pants and sweaters, and cut off a lot of her hair. (Down to about 1.5 inches) It crushed me, but she just was a completely different person. Lots of other reasons for the break up, like the fact that she was a manipulative bitch, but still a major reason for the break. Totally know how you feel, and honestly, don't feel bad. It's more than just a sense of style, it's how much effort she puts into the time she spends with you."

You're both shallow but his is worse.

You are right though about breaking off something that you're not into, and I will apologize for saying you're shallow, you said you had many reasons for the break up. That being said, if a relationship is great in every single other aspect except a person doesn't like that she wears jeans instead of dresses (especially if like op she always dressed that way) then that does make them shallow."

What makes this different than all those prostitutes who choose their choices? (Except for the barely legal age of course) Don't they have family or friends who care about them?! But of course all those prostitutes or porn performers are not real people it's only when a manly male penis takes to reddit to describe how badly he's affected by it - how tragic being the one to have loved a prostitute what with men being the only ones who can make rational decisions and all. When millions of women are against prostitution and porn it doesn't mean anything but it only becomes a concern when a man is affected.

But I actually look at it from a lifestyle point of view, at 50 many are ready or on the verge of retiring into the sunset. Others still have a career going on, are still building a life etc. What you need to do is play the odds on a bell curve where the peak is around 45, a fair but not radical age difference. You could go as low as 35-40 if you want children which is low end of the bell curve and on the other end of the curve at 55 you may find someone in your age range who is what you want, they cant all be that bad. The thing though is that you need a large sample, if your not near a big city with thousands on your favourite dating site you may not find many.  When I was single there were I would guess to say 1000 in the 40 - 50 range, I was able to whittle it down to 100 and out of that I dated 10 and found the one."

Squash any romantic thoughts that you might have. Crush any romantic dreams. Indulging yourself in dreams of a relationship that isn't going to happen is nothing but emotional masturbation. Kill the dream, kill the fantasies. Directly pursue other romantic options. Sleep around, if you like. Or just go on a lot of dates with other people. Eventually you may be able to accept the reality of the situation, and enjoy your friendship for what it is.   2- If you can't do that (and by this I mean you've made a concerted effort but it's not working, not that you've decided you just don't want to try) then cut him off completely. Delete him from Facebook. If possible, move elsewhere. Eventually he'll just be someone that you used to know. It may be possible to rekindle the friendship; it may not.

It's not a fix all, it didn't make me happy, but it lifted that bottom up so I wasn't having those bouts of suicidal depression.  That was with a regular doctor. He also recommended I see a psychiatrist to make sure I'm taking the right meds and also to see a talk therapist. He asked me first if I would be willing to do those things and I agreed. My first appointment is next month and I'm actually looking forward to it.  And often times it's our perspective and how we look at our situation. You might be able to work out a deal with your creditor and go on a different payment plan. They can be flexible, after all, they just want some money. The last resort is filling bankruptcy. That's not as terrible of an option as it seems. Usually only a few months after filling, your credit score starts to go up and you actually look good to creditors as they know you can't file again for another 7 years.  And 30 is still really young. You are just barely out of your 20's. Considering the current life expectancy and the advances in healthcare that will happen in our lifetime, you probably have 40 or more years left. You have more life ahead of you than you've already lived. So much can change in a year or two, imagine all the great things that could happen in the next 20 years or more.

But everything, EVERYTHING is cyclical. The sun rises, lovers come knocking, debtors piss off, and the life swings back to good.  The bright side of debt is that bankruptcy and consolidation are options which can drastically improve your situation. And the longer you're overdue, the less value is put on your balances, so if you feel like gaming the system for a year and pocketing everything, the debt consolidation will have much better terms. Weird, I know, talk to some experts before taking my advice on that.  As for love, OKCupid seems to have 3- to 6-month cycles.

confession,3cyjqn,Buffalo__Buffalo,15,Sun Jul 12 02:47:30 2015 UTC,"Dude, she had a lot of issues, well before you met her. And she didn't have the ability or the resources to deal with them.  Nearly everybody goes through awful breakups and deals with rejection and even abandonment in their lives. If your breakup didn't precipitate her suicide then almost certainly something else would have.  I shouldn't speak for other people, but I get the feeling that she would have felt a lot of guilt over the fact that her issues ran you into the ground and nearly destroyed you, and that because of that she probably felt like her problems destroyed the relationship. I wonder if it wasn't the breakup so much as her inability to deal with things that really brought her to suicide.  I guess you can look at it as if you are the reason she took her life. Or that you weren't strong enough to support her. But you could also look at it from the perspective that you gave a very tortured soul your heart and you showed her love, brought her happiness, and gave her meaning and a reason to hold on just a little while longer which is probably more than she was ever expecting from her life. It's your choice.   The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.   — David Foster Wallace"

Your girlfriend was not suffering from a bad breakup, but a lifetime of depression.

But one thing you should always remember is that no one can ever take responsibility for another persons thoughts or feelings. This was in no way your fault. Mental illness is a horrible thing that damages not just yourself but those around you as well. It was no one fault - it is just a horrible illness.
confession,3cyjqn,flowerpuffgirl,4,Sun Jul 12 02:01:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds like if she'd never met you she would have killed herself two years earlier.  It's been said so many times here but it really isn't your fault. You supported her for two years and she wasn't strong enough. That isn't you, that was her. Some people are chronically depressed. They can't help it, depression is a terrible thing, but you stood by her and gave her two more years. If she'd had cancer and died three months after you broke up, would you still be beating yourself up so bad? You gave her two years which sounds like hell for you, but was important to her. That's more than enough.  As someone with depression, I am fighting to get better. I look back on myself a year ago and know that if I was still like that next year, there would be no helping me. I would want my boyfriend to leave me so that I could off myself without burdening him. I'd know he'd tried and I was still in the throes of depression, so he wasn't right for me. I'd know that even with the best person in th whole world, I would always be depressed and it was time to give up. Maybe that's what she did.  At the end of the day, it's what she wanted.

confession,3cyjqn,kaikeekat,2,Sun Jul 12 01:26:39 2015 UTC,"Please, do not blame yourself for her death. Its not something that is good for you or anyone to have to live with.   All that matters is that you loved her. You helped her, even if you don't wan to believe that you did. Just by being there for her, and being so supportive. All of your actions were trying to take care of her, even asking for a break. You just keep trying different things to help, I know that desperate feeling when you want nothing but for someone to be happy but it seems impossible for you to help make it better. Sometimes you wonder if you've started to contribute to the problem.  Point is, you can say that you tried. It is impossible that you were in any way selfish, since you gave her your whole self in an effort to remedy her pain. The effort, time and emotional investment is more than many people can claim to in similar situations.  On top of that, In a relationship it is your job to take care of yourself, especially if it keeps you in a position where you feel more comfortable. Neglecting yourself would likely have made things worse because you would both feel badly about the whole situation of making each other feel bad. I strongly suggest clinical therapy, as i myself never thought it was something that I could put myself through. Never the less, I found myself willing to try it to the best of my ability since my way of handling things was not working. After years of self-subjected suffering, I've caused more problems for myself on top of the existing ones. PTSD and anxiety are problems that I unwittingly submitted myself to.  Please take care of yourself and don't make things harder than they need to be. Sounds like you have enough to deal with as is. I'm glad that you are able to reach out to others like this and especially, that you seem able to express your feelings rather thoroughly in this setting. I hope you find the strength and see the benefit of this, and are able to comfortably do this in the future.  I have a profound amount of respect for you, friend. :)"

Do you seriously think you can solve a depressed persons problem by cheering them up ? She was struggling before, during and after your relationship, there was nothing you could have done. Only professional help would have helped, did she seek it ? This was always out of your hands. Even though you put your life on hold and loved her completely it was not enough because it could never be enough, she was seriously ill. Let me add one more thing, if a person is seriously depressed do you think taking them to an amusement park for the day or the beach etc would cheer them up ? you might think so but in reality it makes them feel worse because they know they should feel happy and they see everyone is happy but they are still sad and depressed so it makes them feel even worse."

confession,3cyjqn,FmMan3,6,Sun Jul 12 02:35:45 2015 UTC,"I find it pretty disgusting to claim that someone who was going through hell in their own head was selfish, because she was trying to reach out for help in the only person she loved and could trust.  No, OP was not selfish, but neither was his ex. I am 23, and have been struggling to exist for the better part of 15 years. You have no idea how it feels, to have this deep, longing urge to just die, as you critically analyze every mistake you've made in your life, every person you've hurt or upset. You look toward the future and see nothing but lonely emptiness. While all these thoughts are going on in your head, you are battling with yourself, the other half of your consciousness is trying so very hard to convince your bitter other half that it's okay, things will get better. Yes, in the end we are left with nothing, we all die and all would have been for nowt, but let's get up out of bed, go down to the gym, get to work, make dinner, say hello to your friends and tell those you hold dear that you love them.  People like yourself, who try to wave your hand at anyone that truly suffers this fucking piece of shit affliction that I suffer, endlessly, and on occasion more viciously, should seriously reflect on how lucky you are, truly, to be able to experience happiness for longer than a week, or a month at a time. You honestly have no fucking idea.  OP needs to understand that it's not his fault that these are the thoughts she had, he needs to understand that when she spoke of harming herself, when she spoke of death, it wasn't out of the desire to force his hand, but because like myself, we have nowhere to go, we're trapped in our own head with someone that despises us. We only seek a caring person for nothing more than a hug, a kiss, and for somebody other than that ""good"" part of our mind to tell you that it's okay. She got to a point, where that shitty part of her mind won out over her, and she couldn't take it much more.  I want you to do me a favor. Tonight, when you're tucked in bed, tell yourself, non-stop, that you're a piece of shit, that everything you have ever done has been nothing but a disappointment to your family, to your loved ones, that in the end, no one is ever going to care for you in the grand scheme of things, and that you should stand up, go into your kitchen and get a knife and slice your wrists open. When you tell yourself that those thoughts are ridiculous, and you get to sleep without issue, take a moment to think about those out there, like myself, who haven't been able to sleep tonight (it's 6am, I woke up yesterday at 7am ) because all night all that has been on their mind is death, loneliness and self-loathing. That due to genetics, due to unfortunate circumstances at a time where it was critical for brain development, that a child not experience trauma, I will now, until the day I die, suffer these thoughts along with millions of others. Then read your comment, and ask yourself what gives you the right to call us selfish? Is it really selfish that I want to live without feeling this way, or not live at all if that isn't possible?  In the end, OP was there as a beacon of light for as long as he could be. He made her happy, and gave her something special to make her suffering ever so slightly more tolerable. He's not at fault for wanting out, and neither was she. It's just life and death, and it will go on long after you or I have departed this rock."

So do I - I have no ill feelings towards anybody who makes a comment like /u/NoOneKnowsMyName as often times its made out of ignorance, without a perspective on what it is like to live with depression of any kind. However, nothing annoys me more than when somebody tells me to ""cheer up,"" or to ""be happy,"" because it isn't that simple. I just honestly hope that more people speak up whenever comments like that are made. I see no difference between calling a depressed suicidal person selfish, and calling a deaf person rude  because they don't answer you when you call their name. If someone explains to you that the deaf person simply can't hear you, you would never (I hope) then tell the deaf person to, ""just hear,"" or ""open your ears."" - Which is what leads into my frustration at the whole, ""just smile,"" idiocy.  I don't know, I think I'm mostly just in a shitty mood because for the past week I've gone off the deep end of my bipolar, and got a bit irked by what I saw as a ridiculously ignorant and misguided comment.

I'm sorry for what you're going through, and for what OP is going through, but the ACT of suicide is selfish. The pain people feel isn't selfish, but the act is. Maybe I've had someone commit suicdie in my life and maybe I find it very selfish because it hurts so many people. Maybe I've been through years of counseling to deal with the issue.  So please, don't judge and tell me what to think about at night before I go to bed."
confession,3cyjqn,FmMan3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:14:54 2015 UTC,"There's no need to be sorry for what I go through. Unless there's something you're not telling me, it's not your fault I'm the way I am, and nor' are you the reason OP had this experience.  My only quarrel with you, is your insistence that the act of suicide is in any way selfish. I once used that excuse in order to convince myself not to commit suicide, and to this day, my main reason for not getting to a point where I do carry out the act, is that I would never want my parents or my siblings to go through it. Is it not, however, selfish to force someone to continue to suffer with depression, because you don't want other people to have a moment of grief? Where do you draw the line between forcing somebody to live a life of torment within their own mind, and giving their families a moment of grief, yet often times is the case, relief, that their loved one no longer has to suffer? Then you need to factor in scenarios similar to one that recently happened in the conflict zone of Syria, where a jet pilot had his aircraft shot down, and had a choice to either take his life, and experience a brief moment of pain, or to be captured by ISIS, and suffer prolonged and agonizing torture, that would have likely ended with him being slowly and savagely beheaded with a blunted knife. Was it selfish for that pilot to take his own life in order to spare himself the horrors of having his trachea sliced apart so that each gulp of air he took exited his body before it had even passed his neck? Selfish, really?  Suicide has never, and will never be a black and white, right and wrong problem, and there will likely never be a consensus, especially not within our lifetime.  I am honestly happy that you have gone to counselling and I hope that it's working for you, but there are many more out there who are going through a hell of a lot worse, mentally than you or I, and like myself, counseling hasn't worked, and medication only makes the chemical imbalance just that bit more out of whack, making it so much harder to cope.  I do not, and will not judge you, I simply believe that your view of suicide is flawed, for a number of reasons. The only judgement I've seen thus far, was you judging OP's ex girlfriend, and insulting her memory and adding insult to her suffering by declaring her choice of salvation to be a selfish act, and judging her as a morally reprehensible person in the process."

Don't fear conflict...it will happen in everything close relationship and even healthy relationships have some conflict. Its a natural thing to happen and isn't a sign of something bad. But as a result of this you haven't really been able to connect with anyone in a way that has led to anything intimate. I mean if your ultimate goal here is sex then being emotionally available isn't necessarily a requirement, but if you want anything more than that...a lasting relationship for example...

Firstly lets address the issue at hand: Riot has stated very plainly that their ranking system has glitches and some players unavoidably end up against other gamers of significantly greater skill level. Silver V is nothing to be ashamed of (I have 8,000 games played and over 2,000 as Rumble and I am firmly Bronze 4 and proud) so you should keep this in mind: Top rated Challenger and Masters players have over 20,000 games played PER SEASON. So unless you play for a living you shouldn't compare yourself to others. Also, you have school, maybe work and apparently family too. You do not have the time to master LoL.  Play casually. Fill roles, compliment your opponent, put your abusive team on /ignore and just yolo into silver 4. If you go on a losing streak take a break. Play ARAM or just go socialize for a bit. Eat something. If you get tilted you're not going to do better, you're going to do worse.  The guy who's trying to shame you is a shitstick. Look at his MMR, is he higher than you? Tell him to spend his time doing something productive. I know the pro scene makes people feel like your rating is a factor in your life but it isn't.  Put people on your friends list who were supportive or kind. Allies or enemies. Then when you duo, even when you lose it's not awful. I have friends I met in Bronze that later went on into Plat. My best online buddy is Plat 2 (extremely impressive) and when we play together we play people in diamond sometimes. I regularly get destroyed by my lane opponent but it's all in fun. It's just a game.  Lastly don't get too involved in LoL. These are the second best years of your entire life and you should be trying to get your grubby college hands into some panties or drinking too much. You should be having your first acid trip and shitting on yourself in some poor girls closet. You are going to make one or two friends at this time that you will talk to for the rest of your life so you need to look for quality people you vibe well with. I wish you all the best luck."

I placed platinum in season 3 and season 4.  I quit playing after season 4 (7 months ago) because I got fed up with the toxicity.  It only got worse the higher I climbed because people expected more perfection.  The highest I got was Platinum 1 with a couple shots at Diamond.  I failed 2 promo chances at Diamond and decided I had enough.    I started playing again 2 weeks ago and It has been a great experience.  I got placed in Gold 5 (even though I was a high plat player) and It has been really fun!  I have been climbing steadily,  currently gold 2 around 60ish LP, but the toxicity is at a minimum.  Probably because I am playing in a league lower then my skill level and I end up carrying the game 7/10 times.    However, I have had a couple bad games where the other team has a better smurf or just a guy that has things rolling his way and I make a risky play and I get flamed.  I just don't worry about it.  I literally had a guy tell me I should kill myself after a particularly bad game I played.    Keep in mind I am a high plat player and even I get flamed by people.

And I am sorry it happened to you as a secondary survivor. It can be very difficult for family and friends of survivors of sexual assault, rape or childhood sexual abuse. I was sexually abused for most of my childhood by my older brother. I started therapy for it at age 47, almost two years ago. I ended up disclosing the abuse to my family and it was horrible and I felt re-traumatized and my husband lived that with me. He became clinically depressed and was afraid to leave me alone. I also have a bunch of chronic health conditions and I was diagnosed with PTSD and had to start seeing a psychiatrist along with my therapist. He has a strong need to protect me and that went into overdrive for about a year. It is still very strong, his need to protect me & keep me safe but it is more manageable than it was before. I am so glad you both are in counseling separately and together. You should ask your therapists about EMDR. There is a post about EMDR on the front page of this subreddit today.  I just want to validate how you are feeling and reacting. I think it is a normal yet extremely difficult response. I highly recommend you try going to the site pandys.org for support. Find the forums and sign up. I think you have to set up a username/password to access the forums. There are several forums that would benefit you and your wife. The one you want is for secondary survivors of individuals who have experienced rqpe, sexual assault and childhood sexual abuse.   I wish you and your wife peace, comfort and healing. (((hugs)))  Good for you on the decision to sell that house!  Edit: I am not sure where I saw the EMDR post. Just do a reddit search or a Google search. It is very helpful therapy for trauma."

You didn't have premarital sex because that led to pregnancy out of wedlock which led to single mothers, which led to unstable communities. Society is much different now, our capability of preventing unwanted pregnancies notwithstanding. Many of the Christian ideals are quite frankly outdated, no sex out of wedlock being one of them. I'm not criticizing your religion, but you just have to realize that and take with a grain of salt that what you've been taught was useful 50,100, 100 years ago, but is not as applicable today as it was then.

Because 1 Corinthians 11:3-10 says you should be (at least when you're married - the word 'wife' here could also mean 'woman'; different translations disagree):   3 But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. 4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, 5 but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven. 6 For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. 7 For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. 8 For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. 9 Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 10 That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.   Ever had a lady teacher? Because 1 Timothy 2:11-15 says no - but don't worry, if you make enough babies, you'll be cool too!:   11 A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 15 But women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.   Do you seriously agree with all of this? Because that is what following the Bible actually means, not the peace and love crap a lot of modern churches promote."

The people at church who attempted to drill into my head that 'sex is bad' are actually part of the reason I ended up having sex in high school.  Sounds dumb (I know), however their constant ""reinforcement"" had me questioning why it was so bad, and lead to more curiosity due to their vague answers.    I understand what they're trying to do, but they go about it the wrong way.  I'm sorry, but as a horny teenager, warning me and saying abstinence is the only way to avoid STD's, babies, sin, etc etc doesn't cut it."

Weirdly I always wonder how my sister will feel when she has sex the first time. She has not had sex and she is in a long term relationship with her boyfriend. They've been together 2 and a half years. When they get married will it be joyful because they waited or will she feel ashamed because of the ""sex is shameful"" vibe we've grown up on."
confession,3cwq9r,AslanComes,2,Sun Jul 12 14:42:55 2015 UTC,"A few people I've talked to who waited for marriage found their first time to be anticlimactic, overall. They had built up sex as this life changing event, something with all these connotations applied by the church and modern society.   In the end, it's just sex. It's fun, and can really make you feel close to your partner, but it's not as important an event as you can build it up to be over the years.   To them, it wasn't boring, it wasn't shameful, just not as big of a deal as they'd thought it would be."
confession,3cwq9r,AslanComes,2,Wed Jul 15 18:19:22 2015 UTC,"I took it upon myself to read books and go to conferences about sexual purity.   Ah, some of my fondest teenage memories. Just kidding. The conferences we went to weren't even exclusively about sexual topics. They were Catholic retreats. The adults would do their thing, and then the kids split off into the youth group. And for most of the time, it was older teenagers talking to us about how masturbation is wrong, don't even think about pre-marital sex, chastity is the only option, ""I'm saving myself for my future spouse/Jesus"", birth control is bad. Heard horror stories of people that had had premarital sex and the ensuing consequences, STD's, abortions, feeling like a whore etc and how they were reborn virgins or something. I never really bought any of it. I'm not really religious anymore but I still hold certain beliefs but nothing about sex. Sex is natural, marriage or not.   Apparently 1 Corinthians 7:2 declares sex before marriage to be ""sexual immorality"". And there are countless verses condemning sexual immorality, ex. Acts 15:20, 1 Corinthians 5:1, Jude 7, eg. sex before marriage is bad. Hebrews 13:4 can be interpreted as being a little more explicit in saying one should be abstinent before marriage, ""let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.""  I learned all this ^ from a simple Google search, bible verse sex before marriage is a sin. I guess you're not very familiar with scripture (neither am I) if you weren't aware any verse condemning premarital sex. But if you were actually looking for a verse, you must not have tried very hard.  One must understand the historical context the Bible was written in, these were tenets for people of a completely different culture, literally thousands of years ago. I would suggest not taking the Bible literally and attempt to apply it to our modern culture. I will never understand these people that want to pick and choose what rules of the Bible to follow."
confession,3cwq9r,cheif702,0,Sun Jul 12 00:20:56 2015 UTC,That's not what I was saying at all. I know that pre-marital sex is immoral. What I could not find in the Bible is that you cannot have a healthy relationship after you've done that sin.

I mean the New Testament is filled with stories of forgiveness, redemption, I mean Jesus befriends whores.

confession,3cwq9r,Individual99991,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:12:53 2015 UTC,Part of repenting is turning away from that sin. If I'm going to keep having pre-marital sex then there is no point in repenting because I don't mean it enough to actually stop doing it.

Sometimes the consequences of disobeying Him are not obvious, they may take years to show up...and sometimes He gives us grace to avoid or negate the consequences.  What I tell my teenage daughters is, if you and the guy are not serious enough about the relationship to make a lifelong commitment, is that really love?  I suppose if both parties were just open & honest about wanting a fling, that's one thing, but I think if we're honest here we both know a ton of people who wanted more out of the hook up than the other party did, and wound up getting hurt.    ""Better to have loved and lost"", is what Tennyson said, but I think God is trying to spare us that pain."

I mean, I'm not saying I agree with them, but my point is that pretty much everyone in America breaks some of the rules in the bible, because they are reflective of life 3,000-2,000 years ago, and not the modern day. Probably the closest you'll find are ultra-orthodox Jews, and obviously they skip the entire New Testament.  Unless you're going to live in a hovel somewhere, covering your head and trying to reconcile the contradictions between the Old and New Testaments, it's probably best to just follow the spirit of Christ's teachings (basically be a decent human being to your fellow man) and not get too hung up on what is basically a cross between an ancient farmer's almanac and a 3,000-year-old copy of Men's Health and Fitness."
confession,3cwq9r,pngnk,3,Tue Jul 14 02:41:42 2015 UTC,"I was told that if you have pre-marital sex you will be miserable in your future marriage.    I imagine this might be the case with some people, but I can't see why. Wonderful sex between two loving people shouldn't change because they signed a document in a registrar's office or went through a ceremony together.   If anything, getting to know one another - romantically, emotionally, intellectually and sexually - before making a binding commitment will lead to a happier marriage. What if you marry someone and it turns out you're sexually incompatible (different kinks or interests, etc)?   If you have multiple partners you will feel an overwhelming amount of regret.   The only way I can see this being an issue is if your significant other judges you for it - which would be their problem, not yours. My girlfriend (whom I fully intend to marry, because we complement and fulfil one another wonderfully) was a virgin when we started dating. After a while, I realised that she was bothered by the fact that I'd had more experience than her and knew that it would be an issue down the line. So we entered into an open relationship, in which we could pursue other people sexually while continuing to be a couple. I haven't really bothered much, but she went out and had experiences, and she is now a lot happier about herself and our relationiship, and it's helped solidify our relationship wonderfully.  That wouldn't necessarily work for some people, because they wouldn't be as comfortable divorcing sex from love (or, more accurately, understanding the difference between loving sex and recreational sex), but it works for us.  Er, yeah. So basically everybody's different, and everybody has different expectations, needs and fears. There is no ""one size fits all"" rule for life, and the best thing we can do is be understanding of one another and try not to judge.  As for Christianity's rules about marriage and sex - they came about back when contraceptives were at best made of linen or animal gut and at worst consisted of trying to time the sex to the least fertile part of a woman's monthly cycle. Enforcing sexual intercourse between legally bonded couples helped to maintain the society as it was structured, ensuring that children that were created unintentionally received the financial and emotional support of the father and were not just foisted upon the mother.  These days we have a multitude of different contraceptives that obviate that problem. Just like (I'm guessing) you no longer follow the Old Testament verses about not eating shellfish and pork (because those meats spoiled quickly in a time before refrigeration) or regarding women who are menstruating as ""unclean"" and untouchable (so that women would only have sex during the times in which they were most fertile - also dudes were way more squeamish about periods back then), so the rules about not having sex outside of marriage have become basically irrelevant.  Some other cultures use a different method, such as the matriarchal Mosuo tribe in China's Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, who have a fairly open system of, essentially, ""free love"" in which consenting adults are allowed to express themselves sexually without guilt or restraint, and any resulting children are raised communally within multigenerational, female-led households."
confession,3cwq9r,Thanks12321,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:48:59 2015 UTC,"I have yet to read a bible verse that tells me I'll have a miserable marriage now that I am not a virgin.    Isn't it within the realm of possibility that when (if) you do get married, you will compare your husband against past lovers, and he might not be the best? This is one potential pitfall that you would have dodged by staying celibate.    I think the Church probably does worry overmuch about sexual purity.  If you had not been raised Christian, and converted in your 20's after a typical 'lost' (promiscuous) lifestyle, the Church would tell you to repent and be chaste until marriage, but you can't undo what's been done.  Sexual purity is important to prevent diseases, unwanted pregnancies & abortions, and emotional/spiritual connections that are basically between strangers who won't commit to teach other.  Too often the Church teaches what to do but not why we do it...the why is important."

I wrote out my life story because it kind of mirrors yours in a couple of ways, then I decided it was a bit self-indulgent. I'll post it as a reply to this comment if you want to read it.   Otherwise, here's a brief summary: weird kid, OCD; no friends from 14 onwards; messed up university, didn't make the most of it; moved back in with parents, got job in call center but it helped me develop a kind of fake, outgoing ""sales personality""; did journalism diploma then used ""sales personality"" in journo job as a kind of shield, or an excuse to not be myself; realised that ""sales personality"" was just a modified version of my own personality - it started to become part of my persona; moved abroad for work, had to pretend to be shit-hot nightclub reporter while not being overly fond of nightclubs, found this new persona also became part of my standard personality; made a bunch of friends, realised that it's okay for someone to not like me because other people will; moved country again, went on to become managing editor of magazine.  ""Still TL;DR - what's the message, asshole?""  The message is, I could've got to this point sooner if I'd done at university what I did much later in life:    Force myself out of my comfort zones, and stop doing anything that gave me an excuse not to hang out with people; Discard hobbies that were anti-social and unproductive (well, some of them; I still play video games) and pursue ones that would make me meet people: drama clubs, movie societies, tabletop RPGs, sports (ha! Maybe not), creative writing groups, book groups, philosophy discussions, just getting twatted on cheap booze with strangers; Don't care if the things I like are ""nerdy"" and ""geeky"" - OWN the nerdiness and geekiness (this is maybe easier now because fucking everyone watches superheroes, and shows like The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad are mainstream entertainment now whereas that kind of thing was the preserve of weirdos growing up); Construct a ""fake personality"" that's really just amplified aspects of my own personality, and use it until it becomes a natural part of me; Meet LOTS of people, all the time, until I realise that not everyone is going to like me, and that's okay because I generally don't like those people either;  Recognise that I am an interesting and smart - and interesting because I'm smart (this also describes you, believe it or not); Recognise that the people who were weird and goofy and oddball at school are the ones that are interesting and charismatic and attractive in their mid-20s and 30s, once the rougher edges get sheared off and the late-teen/early-20s pretension gets toned down a bit.   The one bit of advice that I would give that doesn't come from my own personal experience, but that of my friends, is to not use drugs and drink as a social crutch. As a social lubricant, sure - a couple of beers among friends (esp at uni) can be fun. But as you've discovered yourself, you don't want to become ""the shroom guy"" or ""the stoner"" or ""the raging alcoholic"". Drugs and drink are great in moderation, but they're not a replacement for a personality.  Obviously this assumes you go to university. If not, DO NOT KILL YOURSELF. There is no reason why you have to spend the rest of your life in your home town. As /u/fatvoodoo says, you can look into teaching English abroad - some companies require university degrees, some do not - and that will give you the dramatic change of scenery that you need. I met a guy who came to China to teach, and he came from a genuine redneck background - grew up in a trailer park, mum smoked meth, absent dad - and he worked, saved up money, and then went to the other side of the globe. He's since built up the experience and confidence to go back to the US to take up teaching as a proper profession.   That's just one guy and one story, but there are millions more like him. Give yourself the chance to write your own story, regardless of what your school grades are like.   Shit, you don't even have to leave America. I'm not saying just pack your bags and move to New York (actually, don't do that - NY is a tough place to live, and expensive as hell) but there's no reason at all why you have to spend the rest of your life in your home town. Work a crappy job in the next town over if you have to, until you've saved up enough money and built up enough confidence to go your own way and build your own plans.  I know this is pretty rambling and sometimes vague, but if you have any questions at all, please just reply to me here or in a PM and I'll give you whatever advice I can. I know we're different people from different countries, but I think your position is at least a bit similar to what mine was 15 years ago, and knowing how happy I am with my life right now, I'd hate to think you cashed out before you got a chance to experience a similar transformation."
confession,3cwdnm,Individual99991,2,Sun Jul 12 05:16:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, so that life story...   When I was in junior and high school, I had a few discrete sets of friends that didn't really cross over - there was the kids across the road that I hung out with with most days; the kid I'd known since primary school who lived pretty far away, but whom I used to visit every week; and the kids I hung out with at my actual high school, plus a few other acquaintances at school.  But around 12-14 things changed. The primary school kid and I kind of got bored of each other and stopped hanging out. The kids at school all became absorbed into ""cooler"" groups, of which I wasn't a member. The kids across the road also started hanging out with tougher kids. Pretty soon I had no friends. As someone who was a slow developer physically, I was kind of being left behind by my peers. I'd also been subjected to bullying by various kids since my first day at primary school, and pretty soon the only contact I had with my peers was being bullied. I'd also had OCD tendancies since I was at junior school - having to touch objects a certain number of times, closing my eyes and controlling my breathing in certain situations - that meant I also became known as a weird kid.  With no friends, and that history, I turned into The Weird Bullied Kid pretty much full time.   From about 14-16 I literally had no friends outside of some internet chat rooms (thankfully the internet became ""a thing"" around this time - the mid-'90s - and I think that saved me in a way. This was long before Twitter and all that shit, too). There were a few kids from the slightly rougher side of town who had hearts of gold, and would occasionally extend the hand of friendship, but I was too paranoid about being rejected and too insecure about allowing myself to get close to them. I also basically shunned a few girls who were interested in me, because I was too afraid to get close to someone and open up to them.  I'm from the UK, where at 16 kids can choose to leave school if they want, either to find employment or go to a technical college. A lot of the dipshit bullies left this way, which made my time easier, but I still didn't really make many friends, and the ones I did I would only hang out with if they invited me, because I feared rejection so badly, and because I couldn't really believe they wanted to hang out with me.  Then I went to university! And, er, fucked it up. I was still too shy and introverted. I wanted to join the drama society, but thought I might freeze on stage. I signed up to the anime and film societies, but didn't go because I was worried about people rejecting me. I made a handful of friends and am still in touch with three of them to this day, but I failed to throw myself into the mix properly.  After university, I moved back in with my parents and again had no friends - everyone I knew from school that I actually liked had stayed in the cities they went to uni in. Weirdly, what changed for me was getting a job at a call centre. That forced me to talk to dozens of people every day, and to be as interesting and charming as I could manage. To get over my anxiety, I created a sales persona, and then I started carrying it with me, taking it to the bars when my colleagues went for drinks after work - I still didn't really have friends as such, but I felt more confident.   I saved up some money and got a little more from my grandfather, and did a diploma in journalism, and used that sales persona more and more to do my job. It felt like the job gave me an excuse to be this other me, and this other me was someone that people liked. And I started to realise that this ""other me"" wasn't a false persona, but just a facet of my personality that was there before, and had to be pushed out by circumstance.   After a couple more years working on local papers and magazines, hanging out with people from my course and job (but still not having a terribly wide social circle), I applied for a job in a foreign country, basically because I thought ""why not?"", in an area of writing that I really didn't have a lot of experience in. I managed to blag the job, and that forced me out of my comfort zone again. Now I had to write about nightclubs, something I'd never really been a massive fan of, which meant a new ""false"" persona, and a shit-ton of research.  But as before, I realised that the false persona was still a part of me, and I was becoming that guy organically. You know the phrase ""fake it till you make it""? Like that. My social circle grew, people seemed to like the ""new"" me - and more importantly, I felt comfortable liking them. I stopped being afraid of rejection, because I realised that the people who were going to reject me for being me weren't worth my attention in the first place - at best they were people who just weren't compatible with me; at worst they were arseholes.   And that's how, in my mid-20s, I finally became the person I should have been about 10 years previously.   A few more years and another country after that, and I was the managing editor of an internationally branded magazine, with a staff that respected me, and a wide circle of friends and acquaintances. I now have a beautiful girlfriend with whom I know I'm going to spend the rest of my life, and my life is so much better than I ever could have dreamed of as a teenager."

confession,3cwdnm,Individual99991,2,Sun Jul 12 09:01:19 2015 UTC,"PART 1  No worries! If it helps you feel more hopeful gives you some perspective then it was time well spent.  I started answering your first question, then wrote the longest answer in Reddit history (probably), so I'm going to do these in a different order, if that's okay with you... I'm also going to have to do this as a series of posts...    how different would you say it was from your normal personality?   I'd say that all of the individual parts were just extensions or expansions of natural parts of my personality, but the total effect was a me that was more confident and seemingly very different from my usual persona. More than the sum of its parts, I guess.   It was certainly a mode that I ""got into"" before I started the work day (and then later when I was socializing), but after a while it became a natural reflex when I was in a social situation, and then just how I am in general.  It's not like multiple personality disorder or anything – I'm not like Daniel Day-Lewis turning into Abraham Lincoln for six months – but I suppose more like taking away the mental blocks that made me too shy or introverted before. Or giving myself permission to do the stuff that I was too embarrassed or scared to do before, because it was ""work me"" doing the thing, not ""regular me"", so if people had a problem with ""work me"" it wasn't quite so personal.   I achieved it through a series of physical and mental exercises that kind of reinforced each other (you know if you smile, your body releases endorphins – pleasure chemicals – that will actually make you a teeny-tiny bit happier? Like that). More on that later.  I suppose you could say that it's kind of like doing cocaine, except better because it's free, your septum won't fall out and you're less likely to turn into an enormous fucking wanker.   (Like I said before, and for reals this time: don't drink or do drugs unless they're purely for social, recreational, fun purposes. Don't drink or do drugs as a crutch or replacement for your personality. That's the real danger of drugs. Well, that and the heart attacks, tar-filled lungs, collapsed veins, disintegrating septum etc.)  A quick tangent about the drug thing: a friend of mine works in PR and told me about how one time they had Daniel Craig doing some kind of a presentation speech. Now this guy is James Motherfucking Bond, right? He does loads of his own stunts, he's a hot property in Hollywood, and unlike Pierce Brosnan he can fire a gun without flinching. He's a pro.  BUT, apparently before he got up to do this speech he was a nervous wreck. Turns out that in real life, when he's not jumping off buildings onto crash mats and firing machine-guns he's actually just a regular guy who gets anxious about appearing as himself in front of crowds.  This is a guy whose entire career is based around standing in front of Hollywood film crews (which can mean 30+ people), and he's freaking out about a three-minute spot in a ceremony.   So she said he basically had to take a few moments to steel himself, control his breathing and put on a stage persona before he got up there. What persona that was, I don't know – he was a lot more charming and less scary than his James Bond, at least – but the point remains: he coped with this pressure by creating another persona to carry the weight.   A few years earlier I'd interviewed a DJ called Fatboy Slim (ask your dad. Or a thirtysomething Bri) for this mag I was working on. Saw the show and it was a laugh – he's got all eyes on him, he's dancing about on stage, gurning for the camera, putting on a show. A while afterwards, he admitted himself into rehab. Turned out that for the past 10 or so years he'd been DJing internationally, he needed to get hammered on booze before he got on stage. Doing the same thing Daniel Craig was doing, but with alcohol. And then he wound up an alcoholic and had to go sober.   So basically, do whatever it takes to overcome these problems without illegal drugs and booze, because that shit will seriously not solve anything.   It sounds like something I've been trying to do a little, but I find that it works for a little bit, but then I always just end up keeping to myself again. How did you manage to keep it up    Well it helped that I started doing this when I was working at a call centre, so I never had to talk to any particular person for more than ten minutes (unless it was a ""problem caller"", but they were relatively rare). So I would be able to switch it up pretty regularly, rather than having to sustain it with a single person for ages.   I guess the question I have there is how long is ""a little bit"" and what signals the end of the personality switch – is it mid-conversation? Also, what is it that makes you ""keep to yourself""? Exhaustion? Shyness? Worrying about people's reaction to you? Something else?  (The long message continues in a series of replies to this post - you might have to do to your /r/confession/ thread to read the rest, rather than use the messages section of Reddit.)"
confession,3cwdnm,Individual99991,2,Mon Jul 13 12:03:08 2015 UTC,"PART 2    Would you mind expanding a little on the idea of a 'sales personality'?   Oookay, this is the start of the long bit...  ""Sales personality"" maybe isn't the best name, since there are some pretty bad associations with salespeople (insincerity, manipulativeness etc), but I started developing it during a sales job, so that's the name I chose. Maybe ""people persona"" might be more appropriate.   None of what I'm about to say is a foolproof solution or a prescription or a guide to anything. All I can say is my own experiences and hope that you replicate the relevant ones in a way that works for you.   So first off - what was the people persona? Well initially I used it as a way to try to sell car insurance (to people who wanted it - I wasn't cold-calling!), which meant getting people to like me. The stuff I consciously did was:  Projecting my voice  This meant speaking from my chest/lower throat rather than the front of my mouth, which meant I spoke more clearly and also didn't mumble (I also enunciated a bit more, which was important because we had people calling from all over the country). It also made my voice a tiny bit deeper, which people seemed to respond to (thank god I'd finally passed puberty by this point).  Note that this is not doing a shit Christian Bale husky Batman voice (I always think he sounds like an eight-year-old trying to sound like a grown-up), nor is it shouting.   Imagine that your voice is a ball and you need to toss it a certain distance - imagine you're able to control words coming out at a particular speed and direction, like your vocal chords and mouth are one of those machines that fires baseballs. For me, I imagined the people on the phone were stood maybe two or three feet away (we were in cubicles, so I imagined talking to the person on the other side of the partition opposite me).   You can practice this (ideally when your parents are out of the house and nobody's around) by finding the biggest room in your house and talking to an object or stuffed toy, ideally about head height. Move it (or yourself, if it's a heavy object) a foot or two back at a time, and try to project your voice to the object.   While I was at uni I worked briefly on a local radio station (just in an admin role, nothing glamorous), and I learned this is actually what some radio DJs do when it's just them in the recording booth - they'll put a stuffed toy or something on the other side of the room and talk to that. Otherwise it's tempting to talk to the microphone, and because the microphone is like a foot from your face, you inevitably start whispering.   While doing this, you will probably feel like a complete tit. That's fine, it's just you by yourself. If it helps, here's another fact: in some stage-acting schools and classes, one of the first exercises new students do is get up on stage and act like animals - elephants, dogs, wildebeest, whatever. The idea is to break through the embarrassment, because if you're embarrassed then you're too busy being yourself and not being the elephant. Is an elephant embarrassed? Hell no. So when you ""become"" the elephant onstage you have to push yourself into that role - people will stop seeing ""you the actor"" and start seeing ""you the elephant"". Similar deal here; stop being ""you the quiet guy"" and become ""you the dude who's just engaging someone in conversation"". Just don't try to peel a banana with your trunk.  Anyway, this works on the phone and in person too. Projecting your voice (not shouting! If you have to take a deep breath before you project you're doing it too hard!) two feet in front of you to the person you're talking to doesn't require too much effort or too many decibels, but it does stop you from mumbling into your mouth.   Personally, I also found that it made me feel more confident, knowing that I could communicate like this, once I'd overcome my inherent cringeyness and discomfort at drawing attention to myself. And in turn it made me feel confident about attracting attention. Sounds like you don't have that problem yourself exactly, but FYI.  Also, look on YouTube. There will definitely be videos on how to project your voice. Just remember that the dudes doing it onstage are trying to reach the back of massive theater   Mimicking people's voices  As with voice projection this needs to be done in moderation, lest you wind up seeming like a nutter. And no, I don't mean copying their accents.  I'm from the North of England, and have a Yorkshire accent. I don't know if you watch Game of Thrones, but that's basically the accent that Ned Stark and Jon Snow have. The call centre was specifically set up in the North because British people find these accents reassuring and trustworthy (seriously!), but there can sometimes be a certain amount of snobbishness towards the accent from people in the South (think of it as kind of the inverse of the South-North divide in the US; the North of England is associated with farming, mining etc).   So if I got a call from someone with a particularly distinguished sounding Southern accent, I'd purposely soften my Northern vowels. If they sounded very middle-class, I'd speak with more care towards my grammar. If they sounded like they were from the North or Scotland I'd thicken my accent up. On the other hand, if they sounded young and/or working class I'd speak in a more relaxed tone - I'd say ""mate"" or ""man"" instead of ""sir"" and speak more like a friend than a customer service drone.   Likewise, if they were softly spoken I'd turn down the projection a bit; if they talked fast, I'd try to match their pace; if they were verbose I'd do my best to join in; if they were taciturn I'd try not to be too talkative.  I wouldn't change my base accent (like, if someone called up who was from the Bronx I wouldn't try to sound like Al Pacino) but I'd try to match the general tone, energy and volume of their voice (unless they were shouting, in which case I'd try to remain calm and let customer services deal with it!) and speak in a way that wouldn't alienate them, or make them feel like I was being too friendly or too distant.  The specifics of this are obviously very much based in a British context, but the basic principles are the same: people tend to like (or at least respond better to) people that they think are like them. If you talk to them in a way that reinforces their own identity, they will like you more. That doesn't mean changing your personality to suit everyone you talk to, nor agreeing with everything someone says (both of those are massive turn-offs to everyone) - it just means saying what you believe and want in a way that they will find it easier to empathise with and respond to.   So for example, I have a friend who's fiercely intelligent and well-read, but also, especially when he's in new company, tends to speak in Pronouncements (with a capital P); long-winded, slightly pretentious-sounding sentences with lots of obscure words. It's kind of a defence mechanism (his own kind of persona, partly as a result of growing up in culture-deprived Australia) and it tends to be toned down when he's more relaxed. This is great when he's in the kind of company that he enjoys being in - lots of arty philosophical types - but he also tends to turn it on when he's talking to just some random people, and it immediately creates a big gap between them. He looks like he's aggressively showing off (when he's actually performing a pre-emptive defence) and they feel stupid and alienated.  What I do is turn up the big words (to an extent - he has a more impressive vocabulary than me) when I'm hanging around with his sort of people, then turn them down when I'm in less pretentious learned company. I'm saying the exact same stuff I would - expressing the same kinds of opinions about life, movies, TV, politics, whatever - but I'm tailoring my vocabulary and tone to ensure that people are paying attention to what I'm saying, not who's saying it. Making them feel like they're talking to a peer, rather than someone who is higher or lower on the social ladder than them.  It's also important not to use slang if you're not comfortable with it - your persona should be an extension of your own personality, not a replacement for it (this is where it differs from acting). So if you're a middle-class suburban kid, dropping gangsta slang is probably not going to convince anyone (or maybe it will? I have no idea how well you can pull that off). Again, if someone called from a South London estate (equivalent to a US inner-city project; see Attack the Block for some idea, with the added bonus of aliens and action).  As with everything, this gets easier with practice and experience. The more people you meet (and the more varied the environments in which you meet them), the better you get at reading people and getting an idea of how you should pitch your voice. Working in a call center was really useful, because every four-to-ten minutes I'd have another person to practice on, and I did that for a year. I think any customer service job would be useful for this, but call center jobs allow you to meet a wider range of people, and focus on your voice without worrying about your appearance.   Now I know you're black and America is pretty fucked up about race (among many other things) so maybe that's going to create some issues that I can't foresee or give advice about. But I still think that judging someone's social comfort level (wish I'd thought of that phrase earlier on, but I can't be arsed editing it in now) and meeting it will go a long way towards getting them on-side. And if they're going to dislike you because you're black then they're not worth your energy or time anyway. Fuck 'em."
confession,3cwdnm,Individual99991,2,Mon Jul 13 12:03:36 2015 UTC,"PART 3  Mimicking people's postures  This is (of course) something I started doing outside of the call centre work. Obviously don't exactly copy someone like you're a bedroom mirror or something, but generally approximating their body language will make them feel more relaxed and open to you. If they're tilting their heads a little, tilt your head slightly too – not excessively, but just enough. If their body is turned to you, turn yours to them. If they're standing tall, then don't hunch your shoulders (and if they're hunched up, don't loom over them).   You probably do this anyway when you're getting along with someone and are in deep conversation; it shows that you're in sync with one another. This also works in the other direction – if you subtly mirror their body language, it'll help build a connection between you.  This sounds like some creepy PUA shit, but it's just basic human psychology.   Don't be constantly calculating whether you're doing exactly what they're doing, though, because they'll work out that you're not actually paying attention to their conversation, and even if they don't know exactly what you're doing, it'll put them off. Just take a mental ""flash"", like an instant photograph, adjust your posture subtly in that moment and then focus on the conversation. If your mind comes back to it, take another one and mimic again.  Smiling   If you smile at someone – and they're not in the middle of a major emotional state like screaming at someone else or in a fistfight or something - they will instinctively smile back. A woman called Mo Asuman – the daughter of a black Ghanian father and a white German mother – recently made a documentary called The Aryans in which she interviewed KKK members and other white supremacists. According to an interview with The Huffington Post, ""I think it totally confuses them because I'm not like they want me to be… So I stand there, maybe I smile at them, and because it's a human reaction, you wanna smile back. So I see them trying to hold down the smile, and that's something very very interesting.""  And it's true, just smiling – a friendly, non-judgmental, easy-going ""hey, what's up?"" sort of smile – helps. Not the creepy, insincere kind that so many waitstaff use in America, mind you. And not the weird perma-rictus grin that Beyoncé has plastered across her face in interviews, that doesn't drop for a second, even when she's talking. That shit's creepy. Just a quick smile when you meet someone, maybe a few more times as you chat and interesting or fun things come up.  Matching someone's energy  Like a lot of the above stuff, this is something people tend to do anyway, but if you're conscious of it, you can use it to get in sync with someone. If someone is high-energy – smiling, back-straight, enthusiastic, speaking fast – then match that, so you don't ""bring them down""; if they're a bit more dry and laconic then go with that rather than annoying them with a chipper chipmunk attitude.  This works in person and over the phone.  Again, you don't have to change your opinions, thoughts or personality here – just be aware of how people are feeling and don't either overwhelm them with excessive energy (which can be annoying at best, or actually a bit scary/intense at worst) or drag them down with muted energy.  As with matching their movements, once you're in sync, you'll find that people will probably start changing their own energy to meet yours. Some people won't, but that's just the kind of people they are.  Asking people questions  You seem to want people to focus on you, and to have something to tell them about (which is why the shrooms thing was great for a while), but honestly what makes people like you is letting them talk about themselves. I can't find the report (I live in China ATM and my VPN is glitching) but there was a study a couple of years back that concluded that people who ask questions are seen as better conversationalists by strangers than people who talk a lot about themselves (even if the would-be conversationalist is trying to be entertaining).   This is totally true, and helps to build rapport in sales jobs. While I was taking people's info, I'd try to identify little facts about them – where they live, what hobbies they have, what their job is, stuff that is actually relevant when taking info for car insurance – and then get them to talk about that. ""You live in (famously warm part of England) Torquay, eh? I bet it's sunnier there than it is here..."" ""You've got lowered suspension and (insert other ghastly modifications)? Man, your car must look sweet. What are you going to mod next?"" ""Sir Reginald? I've never talked to a knight before! What services did you perform for the country, sir?""   The first rule of asking questions (when you're trying to actually get people to open up, rather than push them down a particular conversational path, which would be counter-intuitive) is to ask open questions. That is, questions where the answer can't be ""yes"" or ""no"". That forces people to give more elaborate answers, and engage more fully in the conversation. It also means that if someone is naturally closed off, they won't be able to just close it down with a word.  The second rule is to listen. If people think you're not paying attention to what they're saying, they won't want to keep talking, nor will they be able to relax. Listen to their answers and ask follow-up questions. Ask them to elaborate on some points you don't understand, or ask them what something was like. Try to imagine yourself in the situation they're describing, and ask questions based on how you would feel (""You were falsely accused of buggering pigeons? Man, I'd have freaked out when the police were questioning me – how did you react?""). Paradoxically, the more they relax and talk, the more interesting and cool you seem. (Having, as of right now, written close to 3,000 words, you are officially the most interesting-seeming person I've encountered in months.)  The third rule is to give a shit. A lot of what I've said (and will say) in this post makes me sound like a psychopath or a robot or, worse, a PUA. But I am genuinely interested in people and their stories, and I like hearing people's points of view. Maybe you're like me, maybe not. In which case don't ask questions for the sake of asking questions, but enquire about the subjects you're interested in. Hopefully this person will have some experiences or viewpoints that reflect your interests, and you can connect on that.  The fourth rule is to not be over-eager. Don't machine-gun questions like you're interrogating a spy. ""What's your favourite TV show? Great. Did you see the Rangers game last night? Uh-huh. Do you have any brothers or sisters? Mmm. What's the biggest egg you ever saw?"" You'll sound like a maniac, especially if you use the last two questions. Let the conversation take its own flow, and let the other person expand on their thoughts.  The fifth rule is to offer up your own thoughts. Make it a conversation, not a Q&A. If you disagree, say so (politely, and justify your opinions with explanations – I tended not to do this while selling, obviously). If you've had similar experiences or thoughts, offer them up. Just don't let it get to the point where you're the only one talking, like you're on a stage doing ""An Audience With Asscreditgeddit"".  Not judging people; treating them as equals  These are variations of  the same message: make people feel good about being themselves. If someone feels good whenever they talk to you, they'll think that you're a cool person to be around.   Don't tell them that their taste sucks (I mean, not until you're close enough friends that a bit of joking around doesn't matter) or make them feel wrong about their opinions. If they enjoy doing some nerdy shit – trainspotting, LARPing, listening to prog rock, writing My Little Pony fanfiction – don't turn your nose up at it or try to look too horrified/amused. If they say, ""Sorry, that's really nerdy"" or something, tell them it's cool – ask questions about it if you're interested in learning, more, or open up about some of the nerdier shit that you like.   Likewise, talk to people as equals. Don't approach people feeling like you are worth less than them. If they're decent people it'll just make the conversation a bit strained as they try to simultaneously talk to you and buck up your confidence. If they're arseholes then they'll use it as an opportunity to boos their own egos. And if someone feels that they are of a ""lower"" status than you (for example, I've bumped into a few Southern US guys and gals when visiting northern states, and sometimes these people have felt self-conscious about their accents because of the bumpkin/redneck stereotypes) then build them up and brush off whatever it is they're self-conscious about like it doesn't mean a thing (because it probably doesn't).  Plus, you know, not judging people and trying to build a world in which we all co-exist happily is a nice way to live your life.  Obviously if they're white supremacists or something, judge the fuck out of them."
confession,3cwdnm,Individual99991,2,Mon Jul 13 12:04:00 2015 UTC,"PART 4  Not demanding attention without offering it  In my first year at university, when I came home for the first time, I got roped into a meeting of some of my high school peers. These were people that I sort of vaguely knew, but not really friends. They all knew each other pretty well, though, so I ended up sitting to one side while they got caught up in conversations about this and that. At one point (and I wince to remember this) I grumped, ""Well nobody talk to me, then!"" And the girl next to me quite reasonably pointed out that I can't just expect people to talk to me if I'm not going to talk to them.  That sounds obvious, but sometimes it's easy to forget that nobody owes us an audience, and that a conversation is a two-way street. Likewise, if you retreat into your shell and don't communicate with people, you can't expect them to chase you and give you attention – like the birthday messages on Facebook (unless I've misunderstood the context of that; if so, I apologise).  Make an effort to talk to people and be interested in them and their stories, and they will reciprocate (unless they're clinical narcissists, but that's beyond your fixing and you should drop them like hot potatoes the moment you come into contact with one).  Taking a joke and being self-deprecating  I found it very hard to take a joke – even a well-intentioned, matey joke (guys in the UK definitely like to mock one another to show our friendship, since we're so uncomfortable with other forms of affection; it may vary depending on where you live). Even now I have certain topics that make me wince if someone pokes fun at me about them.   One thing that helped me was learning to be self-deprecating, and using that to learn the line between self-awareness and self-loathing. Sometimes I'd be too self-deprecating and people would go from laughing along to genuinely worrying that I hated myself; it made me aware that people really don't want to listen to someone complaining about how little they think of themselves, even if there's a good punchline at the end. Learning to deploy self-deprecation in measured amounts is useful if you want to level the playing field with someone who feels self-conscious themselves, but you don't want to overdo it.   Self-deprecation is a very British value, however, and I don't know how well it will work in the rather more sincere and positive world of American culture (unless you're Jewish, I guess).  Instead, I'd suggest thinking about the parts of yourself (body and mind) that you feel most vulnerable about, and the worst things you can say about them. Muse on it, let it sink in. Build up a tough skin. Just maybe take a break and do something fun every now and again, and think about the awesome stuff about yourself, so you don't get caught in some super-grim mental whirlpool.  Also meditate on the fact that not every mean thing someone says is intended with malice – and those that are intended with malice aren't worth the minuscule amount of mental energy it'd take to bother listening to them  Accepting that not everyone will like you. And some (not all) people will just find you annoying no matter what you do  Sometimes you meet people and you just don't connect. At all. It's not like either of you are arseholes or anything, but you just have no chemistry whatsoever. All the small talk, all the positive energy – it doesn't matter, because their brains are running on a completely different wavelength to yours. It's nothing personal – nothing you did or have done; you're just not compatible, like putting an Xbox disc in a PS4.   Most of the time it's going to be painfully apparent to both of you. Some of the time it's only going to occur to one of you at first, and it'll sink in to the other later.   Either way, it's nobody's fault. Not theirs, not yours. You're just different people.  Sometimes you might even have negative chemistry with someone and you'll find yourself repelled from them. Maybe they have a voice that reminds you of someone you hate. Maybe they just like stuff that you can't stand. Maybe you just get a weird vibe from them.  Again, you're just not compatible. Pheromones? Subconscious associations? Just completely different personalities? Who knows?  Don't blame yourself and don't blame them. It happens! Sometimes it doesn't make sense, because this person is friends with someone you get along with, and you figure that you should all get along, right? Wrong – it's common to be compatible with two people who are just not compatible with each other. Sometimes it hurts, because that person is kind of hot and you were hoping you might be in with a chance – well you're not, so toss that thought off a bridge right now.  But that's fine, because hanging around with people you don't really like is a massive waste of time anyway. Friendships should be reciprocal – if you're getting love but not giving it (or neither getting nor giving it) – that's not a healthy friendship. You should be aiming to use your new skills to surround yourself with people who both like you and are like you – and vice versa.  The good news is that there's over 7 billion people living on the planet right now – more people than you could ever possibly meet in your lifetime – and there will be plenty more out there that you do connect with. So try...  Meeting as many people as possible  This was made easier for me in the early stages because the nature of call centre work meant there was a constant rotation of people to talk to. Still, though:  If you go to university, get out there in the first couple of weeks and join all the societies and shit that you can. Join a fraternity if you want (that looks like an inane fucking hell, if the movies are anything to go by, but whatever). But make the effort to get yourself around and meet as many different groups as you can – ideally things you already have some interest in, even if you don't have an in-depth knowledge of the subject. Anime, painting, debate, sports, whatever. Some will stick, some won't, but they'll all introduce you to new people. Sign up to anything that takes your fancy. Don't let your insecurities stop you from trying stuff that you're interested in (it turns out I fucking love being on a stage, and I kick myself for not signing up for the drama society, or pursuing am-dram while at high school).  If you don't go to university, then get yourself the fuck out of your hometown (if it's really holding you back; can your parents help with this?) and see what opportunities are available wherever you end up. Again, try to find stuff connected to things you like. Read listings magazines and websites – go to open-mic nights, amateur dramatics clubs, improv comedy groups, book groups, whatever. The bigger the town, the more people there are and the more shit there is to do.   But why wait for university? Unless you live in the one-horse village from Tremors, surely there's something you can do in your home town that would let you meet people who don't know you. Or could you borrow your parents' car, see if anything's happening in the next town along, or the nearest big city? (You can drive at 16 in the US, right?)"

confession,3cwdnm,worksafemonkey,2,Tue Jul 14 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"Well I've been out of the country for eight years so perhaps they don't still say it!   Remember that I only figured this stuff out over the course of years, so don't expect everything to just change tomorrow. Take it a bit at a time and see what you feel comfortable with (but also don't be afraid to push yourself out of your comfort zones – that's another reason why moving to a different town or city is a good idea, even if you don't go to university. Like I said, there are plenty of opportunities available if you don't get into uni).  I think the most pressing issue is giving yourself permission to do things – permission to talk to a stranger, or have a ""bigger"" personality. For me, the job was a great subconscious excuse – I HAD to talk to this person for my job; I HAD to be a bit more outgoing with folks – and if people reacted poorly I could blame it on the job/persona I was projecting. Of course, I realised that the persona was really just aspects of my own personality dialed up, and that really I just needed to let myself do this. I know it's all sounding a bit like a pound shop copy of The Wizard of Oz - ""The magic was in you all along!"" – but it's true.  The other pressing issue is allowing yourself to be hurt. I missed out on so many opportunities – for friendships, for romantic relationships – during my A-Levels and at uni, because I was too afraid that I would lose these people like I'd lost my other friends, or because of some irrational fear that this was all some Carrie-style trick to make me miserable. Or, more typically, because I was just too afraid to let anyone get close to/see the real me, in case they didn't like what they saw.  It took me a long time to get over that. And since then, yes – I've fallen out with people (though not many); I've made friends with narcissists and other bad people who just live for drama; I've fallen in love and been dumped. And it hurts, of course it does. But the hurt doesn't outweigh the good stuff you get, and the more it happens, the more you realise that so long as you don't wallow in the misery (ie. don't become one of those pathetic bastards who refuses to date anyone because they're ""in love"" with someone they broke up with five years ago, when really they're in love with the feeling of being ""broken-hearted"") then you will get over it, and you will meet other people, and life will not only go on, but be great again. And then shit again. And then great again. And then shit again. And then great again. Because that's living!  Like I said – nothing will change tomorrow. But take the first step today. Stay focused on your studies, to give you more opportunities to get out of wherever it is you live. Avoid drugs and drink unless you're sure you're doing them recreationally and not to fill a gap in your life (and never do them alone). Take opportunities you're given if you want to do them – even if it seems scary beforehand (better to have a great cringey tale of disaster for the pub afterwards than a lingering ). Don't say no unless you know it's not in your interests to give something a try. And never let someone else put limits on your life, or make you feel that you don't deserve a great life.   You're going to be fine.  Better than fine, in fact. You're going to be great.  And 15 years from now, when you've seen and done things you never even imagined you might do, come back on Reddit (or have it beamed into your skull or your hologram machine or whatever) and find someone else who was in the same position as you, and pass it on.   Hope this has been of some help, and please do keep in touch if you want to. Happy to field any more questions, or if you just want to talk about stuff - totally fine by me."

By reminding her of it, she develops an aversion to you, and distances herself. The less you mention it, the more things will return to normal.  For your own part, it sounds like you've developed a kink or fetish for your mother. I couldn't tell you what to do about that; a true fetishist has trouble getting off without their thing. A kink, many can do without, it just makes it more fun.  You could try to find someone who will roleplay with you, and see if that floats your boat.  Further, the 'shoe being on the other foot' with how you previously viewed incest is rather common in a great variety of things. For example, many cheaters previously looked down on infidelity, thinking that cheaters were weak-willed, unreasonably hedonistic, or had the poorest self control. The same is frequently true for closet homosexuals. The truth of the matter is, this is just perspective, and the old saw ""don't judge until you walk a mile in their shoes"" has some truth to it, even if nearly no one actually walks a mile in someone else's shoes.

Sadly, most of the incest discussions I've dug up are pure fantasy/bullshit.  Although looking at my other post, I can see how some of it might be construed that way.  The point is- when it comes to incest and other taboo things, it's hard to separate the wheat from the chaff, as most people aren't going to have 'proof' of the relationship for obvious reasons.

Parent/offspring incest is rife with power inequality issues, among other things. If you could actually have the conversation with her, it might be hard to get the point across: she may think that she has created an environment where you feel that you are consenting, but a person with more perspective or a different upbringing would not necessarily consent.  She also might be reeling in the ""I can't believe I did that to my own daughter"" way, and feeling massive amounts of guilt over it.

People I've talked to are torn on fetishes. On the one hand, sometimes they are so narrow that finding a partner willing to accommodate seems impossible. On the other, I'm told that the experience of having it fulfilled is, at least some of the time, almost transcendental (I am not a fetishist myself, but I have a few kinks).  Thankfully Craigslist is not the only place to find people. fetlife.com is a place to start; there you will find people with fetishes of all sorts, though, obviously the more common ones will have more people willing to entertain them. I think, though, you will probably find more people understanding of your situation, and a greater likelihood of someone willing to accommodate even if it isn't their thing (and, as in all relationships, you may have to accommodate something they want).  Finding exactly what you want... that might be hard. Some fetishists I know write their own fiction, and get off on it. deviantart is where I've heard some of it going down (they do have the art of writing, after all), but I couldn't swear to it, and I wouldn't know how to find it.

And I'd been horny/aroused plenty of times before it happened but it was like... whoa.  Turned my world upside down.  I feel like I'll always be 'chasing the high'.  I almost get angry at her about it sometimes, for giving me a taste of something amazing and just ripping it away.  On top of being angry at her for other things.  But I'm trying not to blame her and just be understanding.  I've heard of fetlife, but I thought it isn't really a dating/hookup site.  Writing down what happened was both cathartic and arousing, so I might try writing my own fiction to channel some of my emotions.  I'm not a writer, but I've never tried my hand at smut (before today).  Maybe it'd be good enough to deal with some of the frustration I have until I can find something more fulfilling.   Thanks again for your lengthy reply and concern."
confession,3css85,sloboznia,2,Fri Jul 10 17:19:42 2015 UTC,"Turned my world upside down.   Yeah. At least one fetishist I know is barely able to get off without it. I completely sympathize; really great sexual experiences are intoxicating, and once you have a taste, regular fare pales in comparison. The phrase 'mind-blowing sex' is not for nothing.  Fetlife, as I understand it, is specialized social media with concealed identities. Since many fetlife members are actual participants in these sorts of things, I imagine finding a genuine group that is relevant to your interests might be easier there. I don't personally have experience with it, so I can't swear to whether it will have what you want.   Writing down what happened was both cathartic and arousing   That's a good direction to pursue.

Maybe also let her know that if she feels uncomfortable about airing it out you will respect that as well and will not bring it up again.  I would leave your desire to do it again off the table at least until she's come to terms with the first time and you understand how she feels towards the situation.  Honestly your both adults and my view is if your not hurting anyone else you should be free to do as you please.   Good luck I hope you get your mom back

Honestly as much as I want to, I'm pretty sure I can get past it.  I'm pretty damn sure that some of my extreme proclivity for M/d fantasies stems from the fact that we now have an essentially broken relationship and I'm craving her comfort.  And I agree; although it would be kind of devastating if, say, my grandparents found out, I see no reason why they would have to be informed.  I'm sure if we continued to have sex we would still be able to behave and hide it when we see them.  Past that, I really don't think it's anyone's business but ours, and no one would really need to know.    Thanks for your response and well-wishes."

She sees it as a mistake and didn't enjoy it (or at the very least, didn't enjoy how it made her her feel afterwards).  I know this sounds counterintuitive, but I believe that the wisest thing for you to do is not to bring it up ever again and let her heal. She has chosen to pretend that it didn't happen. Trying to talk to her about it will shatter her defense mechanism. Let her slowly heal.   You're not guilty of a goddamn thing as it was consensual, but you must understand that incest is taboo for a pretty good reason - it can have devastating consequences for the previously-healthy relationships between family members. You two made a mistake and are suffering the consequences - there's no way around it, except let the healing take its course."

You are her child and she loves you and is most likely dealing with guilt.   Who initiated it and was anything said during it?  Like regrets during or saying it shouldn't happen?  Also, I don't think she wants to talk about it and probably doesn't want to hear that you enjoyed it (sorry...but i think that will make her feel worse).

If you show your attraction at all, it brings up all these issues again and again.  If you are unwilling to go to a therapy, I think you need to have some time/space between you two. If you can, spend 6 months away from her (or longer), after leaving her a note saying you are giving her time, and that you miss the relationship you once have.

Also, if you think your husband will find out about an abortion, you're probably right. That means intense conflict if you go through with it.   Here's a secret about abortions that people don't talk about: they end one problem, but all the others are still there. In your case there might be a few more. The problems that led to this situation will remain regardless of whether you abort.  Of course, carrying the pregnancy to term won't fix them either. Only counseling will.  Seek counseling, now.  Edit 1:  You have three choices:  Have an abortion. You will have to figure out the logistics, which may be simple or impossible. Your husband will almost certainly find out. There will be screaming, crying, anger, and resentment. All of the anguish towards your child and husband will still be there. It will be hell.  Don't have an abortion. You will continue to feel overwhelmed. You will continue to hate the pregnancy. There will be screaming, crying, anger and resentment. All of the anguish towards your child and husband will still be there. It will be hell.  Have or don't have an abortion, and seek counseling. You'll work through your issues. You'll figure out your needs. Your life will improve.  Edit 2: If you decide to carry the pregnancy, here's what I suggest. Give your husband an ultimatum: support me or I abort. Tell him you need counseling, days off, and a lot more support. Don't be manipulative. Just tell him that you are a team, and while you are gestating/nursing he needs to be picking up the slack. Demand a broader support network, a babysitter, et cetera.  Make it clear that either pregnancy and childbearing are done as a team, or he has no right to complain about you aborting.  Edit 3: I'm sorry I keep adding updates. My wife and went through something really similar and we came out ahead. I'll add future ""updates"" in another comment."

He is being an asshole for not listening to you and for pressuring you into doing something you don't wanna do. If you need to do so, you should leave and take some time for yourself, go through with the abortion if you wish and calm your head and decide how to handle your existing parenthood obligations.

There was nothing illegal, and there was no discovery of a fetish you don't share -- you just have a problem with the appearance of the actresses and the actors? He might not even have thought that hard about these details. As women, we encounter the slightest thing ""off"" in porn, and we're no longer into it. Men encounter the slightest thing arousing in porn, and they're into it regardless of surrounding details they're not aroused by.   So maybe you guys won't be watching porn together.

I was 6 years old. Does this mean I wanted it? Maybe its my fault and I asked for it.   The short answer to this is No.  You ""letting"" this guy rape you in return for material objects was your/your mind's way of ""rationalizing"", ""justifying"", and ""making acceptable"" a situation that you knew you had no control over. It was your/your mind's way of making the situation less painful --- less traumatizing --- and more ""survivable"". You know: Self-protectionism!... And your dreams are the same, albeit many years after the fact.  I know because two things happened to me when I was randomly physically assaulted by a person with mental health issues out on the street once upon a time: (1) I had an out-of-body experience as the guy was beating me up, where my body went numb and I could ""see"" myself being beaten up from above; and (2) at the end of it all, I quickly justified it as a case of me being ""in the wring place at the wrong time""... and that was that.

I dunno.  This started happening to me last year where, out of the blue, I started getting this urge to thank the person who stepped in and stopped the asssult/made sure I was okay --- six years after the incident... The only issue for me is that I have no clue who the person is and have no means of contacting them, so it will likely remain an 'unclosed' thing for me... (shrug)"

Maybe reminding him of it and how that past is making you feel now is something you need to do to 'free' yourself from it?  Sure, it'll make him and your dynamic uncomfortable for a while, but what is a bit of discomfort in light of everything that has happened?... And who knows: perhaps it will help you come to terms with it better once you know that he knows how you feel (if not how it feels to be reminded of something you would rather forget).  Silence and pretending that things didn't happen can eat away at victims.

The fact that you said yes doesn't let your rapist off the hook for an instant.  You were only 6...no one that young can understand the consequences of self harm that you went through. The nightmares and self disgust you're feeling now is proof of that. Besides this, no six year old has any idea what sex is unless they are taken advantage of and that knowledge is horribly forced upon them...as what happened to you by your rapist.  You are not guilty of consensual sex, not even the tiniest bit. That's because the innocence of your childhood was stolen by this person; you didn't and couldn't know what you were doing, not anywhere close to the way two mature adults consent to intercourse for favors or gifts. Your rapist drilled this behavior into you...it was his idea from the start, he used your naïveté against you to rape you, and he got completely into your head so that you didn't know how to resist him any more but simply got used to it and accepted it as the way the world works. This is how any child learns; they take notice of what behaviors bring rewards and what brings pain, and they will repeat the former and avoid the latter. That is not consent or comprehension in the adult sense, but is merely adapting and trying to survive in an unfamiliar world. It's instinctive. But, there are also boundaries that the adults who are raising or teaching or interacting with a child must never and should know better than to violate, but your rapist willingly and knowingly did so. This makes the blame 100% his."
