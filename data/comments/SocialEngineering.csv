What I suggest if you don't want to confront them is to mention in casual conversation that you don't like to be called names. You can do it in a way that they don't feel directly attacked but take note that it offends you.  You could make up and scenario where you had a fight with someone at the grocery store and they called you ""honey"" and you replied saying something like ""first of all, don't call me honey. I hate being called names, by anyone..."" or something to that effect.  It's a really passive approach, but that's what you're looking for, and I guess it could work.  Good luck.

That's my point: The guy who responded ""it's definitely illegal in (parts) of Europe"" doesn't seem to know the actual answer to the question.  For instance I could say ""Fireworks are illegal in some parts of America"" which would seem odd to any outsider, considering the traditional Independence Day celebrations. But it's true: They're illegal in Madera County of California (among other wooded California counties, such as Mariposa). Not just illegal to buy or sell but illegal to use.   But just saying ""Fireworks are illegal in some parts of America"", while true, doesn't really tell me a thing. Same thing here: The guy only pretended to convey information. He didn't actually convey any.

Are they similar? Abso-fucking-lutely. Are they the SAME??? No. Only an idiot who knows nothing about social engineering would say that.    The question the OP asked was what methods do those heavily familiar with social engineering use to their advantage when it comes to sales. Social engineering has unique aspects of itself which, when used alongside something like sales, makes it powerful. Technically we can say Larry who's selling his lawnmower on Craigslist is ""using social engineering"", but it takes away from the art. Might as well say psychology is sales and sales is psychology; it's a nice quote to make you sound intelligent to an ADHD internet forum, though it doesn't make you right."

When I was going door to door I always found people would allow me into their house if with in the first 10-20 seconds I could relate to them in one way or an other.  Keeping this in mind I always scanned the front patio, as far inside the house as I could see when they opened the door and the person themselves. If I found ANYTHING I thought might be something ""special"" to them I would just say something along the lines of, "" oh wow I see you have a signed base cap. You a fan of (what ever team was in the area)"". It works so well. When people can relate to you as a person and not a product they trust you more and open up."

Educating them on a product may create an air of trust, or telling them not to buy a certain product because it is not a good deal, then use an up sale / direct them to another product. Then there is the basics such as smiling, eye contact, positive body language, matching verbal cadence, asking open ended questions (how can I help you, etc.), neat appearance.   If it's for donations, asking them and knowing what the donations go for and where.   If they have kids be nice to them. Treat them like you already know them.

Don't put it bluntly, they might get offended and dig in even deeper. mildly suggest it. Back away if you feel pressure and attempt again later.   You could also go risky and straight off tell them that if they don't do their job, it will leave a mark on their history. I. E.

They may need not care about their current job no more but you can be sure they will do it proper if their future depends on it.

No amount of sweet talking or bias-manipulation will help here if the person knows they are being laid off and are only there for a paycheck.  Keep the emails short - classic phrase is ""3 bullet points and no more"". People tune out and will skim anything longer (if they even read it at all).

At most 3 lines per paragraph. People have to sort through tons of information daily and they appreciate to-the-point-ness. Have a clear appeal at the end, hopefully just one line of text. Make sure the e-mail name is clear in explaining the content. Write the e-mail around how the task or whatever helps them or helps to fulfill a common goal. Always thank in advance and make the recipient feel good for being helpful. Act how you expect people to be, and people will reciprocate. (If all else fails, make sure you insist in a timely fashion. Be a pain in the arse if you need to be, but a nice one. Never in a butthurt manner, always keeping a friendly tone and giving a chance for people to redeem themselves. Never blame people either.) (This is more of a habit to build around rather than a tip but make sure you yourself always answer e-mails quickly if you want people to do the same. Even if they send you the information and nothing else is required, a short ""Thank you"" reply goes a long way)"

I end my emails with this  Thanks for your time. If I don't hear back from you, I'll follow up tomorrow at 1:20.   Many times I would not hear back from them, so I would send at 1:22ish:  Just following up on my email from yesterday. I know you are very busy. Please email me any questions you might have.  If I don't hear back from you, I'll follow up with you tomorrow at 9:35.   As you can see, I try to never show any judgement or emotion with the follow-up.   Adding a time that does't end in :00, :15, :30, or :45 sticks out as ""abnormal"" and therefore ""special"", as if I have some type of deadline.  After a few email like this, I find that I start to get timely responses, because they know I will be sending another email (or calling) at a specific time.

You're spot on about this one piece of evidence as well. It generates a lot of questions.   We could individually look through all the listed users and whatnot but frankly, I'm not going to do it.   We could arrange a test to post selected stances in world news and see how they are up voted and down voted but that won't really be that telling bc this group appears to be both new and small.   The only other option is to open it up and see who comes out to embrace/argue against it. It's clearly polarizing info.

SocialEngineering,3dsp59,antonivs,12,Mon Jul 20 05:14:18 2015 UTC,"Hi redditors,  I was alerted to this thread because I was mentioned as as one of the users to be targeted. I am not surprised and this confirms suspicions that I have had. This will be a long post, sorry.  (1)  First of all, it's been reported by news sources all across the globe and the political spectrum that pro-Israel users target popular sites to be spread propaganda.   http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/   JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel is looking to hire university students to post pro-Israel messages on social media networks — without needing to identify themselves as government-linked, officials said Wednesday.  The Israeli prime minister's office said in a statement that students on Israeli university campuses would receive full or partial scholarships to combat anti-Semitism and calls to boycott Israel online. It said students' messages would parallel statements by government officials.   One organization that is involved in this is the JIDF, the Jewish Internet Defense Forces, which have targeted Reddit by name in twitter posts on a banned account.  http://www.newsweek.com/israeli-pm-buys-pro-israeli-tweets-260157  http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/.premium-1.541142  http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Israels-newest-PR-weapon-The-Internet-Megaphone  There's a ton more links on this.  Also, as for targeting users to dox them and get their personal information, after I started to post on worldnews and Israel/Palestine threads, I started to get odd messages from people who don't even post on worldnews fishing for personal information on me in subtle ways. This is also also a well known tactic of pro-Israel groups also documented by the press.   http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/27/website-targets-pro-palestinian-students-harm-job-prospects  An unknown group has launched a website that profiles people affiliated with pro-Palestinian student groups – publishing their names, photos, occupations and sometimes universities and majors – in an effort to dissuade potential employers from hiring them.  Canary Mission went live in mid-May and includes profiles of 54 people, primarily university students and professors, with photos and links to their social media profiles.   Now, especially recently, if you look at my history of recent comments on worldnews you can see how this tactic has been played against me. On non Israel threads on worldnews or on other forums, comments deep in a thread are barely responded to and get little upvotes or downvotes. On Israel threads, I am guranteed 5 or 6 downvotes within minutes , although sometimes comments are rescued. Usually even when Reddit is hostile to your opinion on a specific thread, you can be upvoted if you catch another user straight-out lying. Not so on Israel threads.  Here is a recent example.  https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3dnax0/israeli_pm_calls_palestinian_president_in/ct7068h  Internet Karma is the last thing in my life I am worried about so I don't care if these pro-Israel posters want to downvote me into oblivion, I just think it's wrong because Reddit is supposed to be a place for open banter and I think it's offensive that users would try to harm Reddit with this type of vote brigading.  If you want to do something about this, I suggest messaging the mods of worldnews, and the Reddit Admins who are supposed to be attentive to users after the Pao Affair. Admins can see who downvote and upvote a post, and if they bother to look into I/P threads with their internal data, it won't be hard to confirm the already documented brigading that's been covered by the NYTIMES, Guardian, and others.  If you want to message worldnews mods, send a message and in the To tab, hit /r/worldnews. For the admins, r/reddit.com in the to tab."

""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is a great book. I read it a few years ago when I was struggling with my own identity and it helped me a lot. I haven't read the updated version but I would highly recommend the original. If you follow the advice it gives, you will never have trouble keeping up with a conversation.  As for your so-called friends, if I was in your situation I would cut them out of my life completely. Break all contact with them and start working on improving yourself. Pick one thing in addition to your choice of friends that you would like to change about yourself and focus on that for the next month. When the month is up, sit down and evaluate where you are then as opposed to where you started. Make note of what you could have done better, what worked well for you, and then start thinking about something else you would like to work on and start the cycle over again. Don't let yourself get stuck on any one thing for too long. The goal is to keep moving forward and improving. If you get stuck on something, you are hindering your progress and will get discouraged.  Also, study up on some basic social engineering techniques. This might help you in the future to avoid ""friends"" who might try to use you for their own benefit. Hope this helps. Good luck."

SocialEngineering,3dops7,0x2k,15,Sat Jul 18 17:47:33 2015 UTC,"I totally understand what you're going through right now because I am experiencing the same phenomenon.   Just realize that if you're constantly  improving yourself, things will eventually secure themselves in a better way than before. Sometimes, there's nothing specific you can do to get ahead. I understand you must be frustrated (I know I was/am), but if you realize that the world doesn't revolve around you, and there are a multitude of thoughts going on in each head that is involved with your day-to-day, it will help. Someone else pointed out that a change in power dynamics could set off some conflict. This is true. But if you approach this in a negative way, you're only stooping lower and are the loser in the end.  With that said, I talked to my parents about it, about how I feel like I'm not being respected enough by them. They responded with the same shtick I grew up with - ""You're always a baby in our eyes"". And it's true, so there's not much you can do to change that.  If you find this hard to understand, think about it like this. There's a character in a game you've been working on mastering for 17/18 years. You adore this character; you've learned every mechanic, strategy, every random trick in the book to get it to win for you.  Then, you spend time - a year or two - away from the game. In that time, a new version of the character was released. People rave about the changes, claiming he's improved so much. He's quicker, he's stronger, etc.  So you log into the game and select that character again. He looks different now.. Kind of cooler, but you kinda grew used to the older look, so you continue a bit unsettled. As you get to the battlefield, you notice the difference in his speed. He walks so much faster now. But you'd gotten used to the slower gait! You were able to overcome that with a special tactic you'd developed in your many years of learning the character!  In that train of thought, the enemy character had approached and had started to attack. You respond with a deflecting combo. But wait! Since the strength stats had been upgraded, the attacking animation was slower, and your combo no longer works!   Soon enough, you realize everything about the character is different now. While the play style remains the same, these supposedly 'upgraded' stats rendered the strategies and trick - ones that served you well for years - useless.  You're a bit salty about the changes, of course. Who wouldn't be if they were in your position? But since you love this character, you've gotta get used to it. You make mistakes here and there - you sometimes play him the same way you used to, disrespecting the fact that he's different now. He's stronger, he's faster. Who could blame you though? Old habits stick, and it's so hard to change them sometimes. You'll get there though, with every single match.  And in this, you should find your answer. Spend more time with your parents. Help them with the house work, talk to them about your friends at school, about your professors. Ask them about their day at work - how awful their boss treats them, what projects they're working on lately. Show them how you've changed by action. They will learn to respect you as the person  you are now, rather than you were.  As a side-note, what may obstruct your reasoning with this phenomenon is the the concept of 'child vs adult'. A lot of people struggle with this because they look at it in such a divisive manner. In reality, both are still people. There are many older people who behave in a childlike manner, as well as those young who have an older soul.   What I'm willing to bet that frustrates you is that you believe yourself to be an 'adult' - an improved individual over the 'child' you were before college.  The only REAL dynamic present between you and your parents is just that. They are your parents - the people who brought you into this world and raised you from infancy to adulthood. Whether you like it or not, they are responsible for your likelihood for survival - this includes your safety, as well as the development of a sound moral compass. Even if you become a responsible, contributing member of society, there will still be ways in which you can improve. Your parents are the only ones who care enough to bitch at you when you're doing something they believe to be wrong. As they're only human, sometimes they will make mistakes in their judgement, call you out for no good reason. An actually mature person can reakize the potential for misunderstanding (as one person's perspective is limited to the extent of their knowledge) and effectively communicate his point of view to alleviate such situations without further conflict.  I hope I helped."

Smile a lot. Tell your parents what you missed about them or something they did that helped you at university, but keep it small.   Again, this is generic advice because you don't have much data, and it's extremely basic to call SE. It's just basic social skills.

If the ratio is heavier on ""I/me"" words, that's a good indicator that you may be being too self-centered and coming off as arrogant.  Also keep track of how many sarcastic statements you make, or jokes you make. While it's completely fine to poke fun at people, it takes a little skill to have them be with you on the joke, rather than have it be at their expense.

Both of these messages need to get conveyed too them.  In the first line you establish group mentality & dominance. This is actually similar to what you do at the office. ""WE, US, OUR"", what this is really saying is ""Me, and everyone else behind me"". When it comes to your target, you are going in for a head on fight & you more or less have to convert them to your side.   Using the singular forms to address others ""You, Your""(maybe, name droppingcanbackfire) you make them aware of their role in the problem and how it goes against the ""WE"".  The ""we"" that they were once part of, but are now not, they are ostracized.

Even if venue scouting was necessary, you wouldn't CALL them all straight away. How about looking for the venues on Facebook and checking to see whether your targets are 'Fans' of the venue ?

The issue is I find a lot of people doing it, tend to be between 12-21 and the ""better"" and I use that term lightly, SE'ers of those sites mentioned, tend to be envied by the younger, newer members, and it goes to their heads, I have scouted many of these sites, seen how they operate and its nearly always the same.  They act almost like a pyramid scheme and essentially scam their own community members, always asking for donations, and saying that the best ""methods"" are in the VIP section, which you have no way to know unless you pay up.  my main issue with these ""methods"" as they often call them, is that they are bottom of the barrel stuff. You are dealing with a person, who has a script to work from, a predefined list of what is and is not acceptable, usually a minimum wage customer service employee, with no vested interest in the actual product or company they work for, its not hard, its literally harder to take candy from a baby, at least the baby wants to keep the candy. However, because of the tiered system, the elitist attitude, and the perpetual praise from younger members as well as the sense of accomplishment gained by the small followings they gather, they become an echo chamber for conceited minds and egotistical behaviour. preventing them growing as social engineers. This is why we see someone selling keurig coffee makers they scammed to get money to then go and buy the x-box they wanted, rather then social engineering an x-box directly, or maybe getting a job in a field where they can use their knowledge to help a company avoid such attempts at warrant exploitation. in the end they are just kids reading a script, and patting themselves on the back for a job well done. the term script kiddy, fits them as well as the baby hackers for which the term was originally coined."

However, he would be more likely to find a quiet corner alone to play games on his phone at a social gathering than to buttonhole someone.   My father, long deceased, however, was very fluent and well-spoken, no repetition issues, seemed pretty ""normal"" much of the time, but my mother told me that he would often latch onto someone in a social situation and talk long and hard at them without pause. He would just steadily monologue without the give and take of a normal conversation, and be oblivious to the other person's obvious increasing discomfort and attempts to break away politely.   She said it was pretty mortifying, and she of course felt obligated to rescue his victim by distracting him long enough for them to escape. My dad was apparently under the impression that she was a complete social klutz, always driving others away.

They've talked enough now that I know it'll be about the daily news or the weather we can clearly see out the window, peppered with generalities and common phrases (y'know?, what are you gonna do?, time to check out, it's always something). The body language just screams insecurity: talking with hands in face, walking down the hall with arms crossed, never directly facing you when talking.  I don't want to encourage more conversation, and I don't want to seem like an asshole, but I can't think of any approach other than silent treatment. Just make eye contact, look stern, and wait for the talking to stop. If I'm feeling particularly peeved, I'll return questions with one word answers and selectively acknowledge certain things over others.  This approach is leading me to use the above tactics when they ask work-related questions, and that's a problem.

I think having a willing audience that is eager to help and impress the boss (most of the company, including me) was a big reason his tactics were so successful. Let me give you an example: a white board/brainstorming session with me, my boss, and another employee. I started to notice that he was shooting down anything that came out out of my mouth, causing me to try harder and come up with more and more ideas.    At the same time, he would praise everything that my co-worker suggested (even some of my own ideas that he shot down), causing her to try harder and come up with more and more ideas.    And he was absolutely brilliant for exploiting the differences in our personalities. Had he praised my suggestions, I would have shut down: ""OK. Problem solved. What's next?""    Had he criticized my co-worker, she would have shut down: ""Oh no! All my answers are wrong. I'd better keep my mouth shut!"""

He continues talking, framing it as if you said 'yes'. Do a loop-the-loop with the conversation and bring it back to the original topic, you end up voicing the solution you'd thought of, that you never wanted to do, he says ""Great!"" and you're like ""...shit"".

I had one person go from outright fuming to apologizing profusely at the end by staying calm yet continuing to listen and understand in attempts to help or compromise.  Stoicism works wonders."

If you want to build those relationships, with different types of people (not just successful or ambitious kinds like you), youll have to work on the empathy part and find a way to connect. From my experience, engineers are boring to other people, they think about different kinds of problems in ways most regular people dont care about. So youll have to throw in some extra effort to expand your horizons.  I picked up football (and a few other sports later) just so Id have more things to talk about with more people. Find a popular TV show, a hobby you can share, run a tough mudder, go volunteer. Youll have fun doing something different thats not related to your money or success.

I think that remark highlights the problem (and why people are downvoting).  First and foremost it seems you are focusing on a divide between you and other people - if you believe you're different than other people then other people will treat you that way.  You're focusing far too much on the differences; income is a measure of success to some, but it is not the only thing that determines whether you are successful in what you do.  Engineering or quantum mechanics topics could be interesting to people who don't know much about them, but it depends entirely on how you talk about them.  If you get too technical not only will some people begin to tune you out, but many will start to resent the fact that you know that much more about it than they do, particularly when you use terms they don't understand or bring up concepts they aren't familiar with regularly.  If you want to talk those topics (and nothing is wrong with that) you've got to remember to put it in a context people who haven't focused on those areas will understand, and without making them feel inferior.  Even better than talking about you (what you know, what you do, etc), is to become a better listener.  What do the people you're trying to socialize talk about?  What are their interests?  Frankly, there is no absolute answer to this.  Pick up football to have more things to talk about... that might work with some people, but not everyone cares about sports.  If you start trying to familiarize yourself with things outside your own bubble and it's not what they're interested in you're going to have just as much trouble relating or finding common ground as you do now - only if it's apparent you're trying to be an ""average joe"" (these people notice you're picking random topics to try to appeal to them) it's going to backfire.  Try asking about things they seem to be interested in.  Ask probing questions.  There are a ton of ways to elicit information, and that's exactly where you need to start.  Don't just get interested in everything they do, find things that you can genuinely curious about and learn more about that - then you will have your common ground.  The more you make this about you (even though you're trying to improve upon faults you see with yourself and your social interactions), the worse you're going to make it.  If you're interested in interacting with other people be interested in them"
SocialEngineering,3cfdy3,haarp1,6,Tue Jul 7 22:02:54 2015 UTC,"While I agree that you seem a bit self-centered and socially oblivious, what I find most obnoxious is that people are downvoting you for seeking an outside perspective on your behavior.  I think the fact of the matter is that you have made a choice to focus your time and energy on things that most people are either not interested in, or that are not relatable conversation topics. You admit that your peers are having a drastically different life experience than you right now, and yet you don't seem to be interested in shifting your own perspective to accommodate that or make up for the disparity in your respective situations.  I've gone through a similar experience over the past few years (I am also in my 20s). I too earn more than most of my peers. Having disposable income has made me very interested in personal finance. I read lots of books about it and frequent blogs and forums that cover the subject. I often see my friends making uninformed financial decisions and am tempted to give unsolicited advice, but I have come to realize that it usually comes across as condescending and tends to create an unequal conversational space where I have all the answers and all they can do is ask questions or sound inexperienced. This is not a recipe for a healthy interaction, and so I now steer clear of broaching this subject in social settings, unless someone explicitly brings it up.  Finances in particular are a very touchy subject because they can easily make a person feel devalued, even if the work they are doing is incredibly valuable. When someone who makes significantly more money than us wants to talk about finances, it can seem like they just want to have a conversation whose context tends to put them in a superior position; it feels tone deaf. One way to address this is to take a step back and try to empathize with your peers. What is their current situation and how might that affect their mood, interests, worries, hopes, etc.? What do they spend their free time doing, and why? Is it possible they might have learned or experienced something that you could find valuable or enjoyable? Maybe they would be willing to share that with you.  Just because you are paid well does not mean that you are any more interesting or inherently valuable than people who earn less than you. Taking this to heart and understanding why it is true requires time and effort, but it will massively improve the quality of your interpersonal relationships in the long run."
SocialEngineering,3cfdy3,wolfram184,3,Tue Jul 7 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"Great post. What I've also found as I've gotten older is that youre not bound to your peers as much. While you're in school, theres no choice, but once youre an adult - youre free to socialize with whoever you please, as much as you please.  In this context, if engineering topics are really important to OP, then the other option is just to find new peers that have a similar worldview and move on from people with which you cant seem to ""get level"". I think thats fine too, the worlds a big place and not everyone will be your friend, ultimately.   What do you think about this strategy? You mentioned that you changed your behavior to account for the unequal conversation space, does that ever wear on you? If youre passionate and knowledgable about something, shouldnt you feel good about sharing it, and seek company you can share it with?  I find myself holding my tongue when my friends broach topics Im knowledgable about- some days its no big deal and I chalk it up to everyone learning things at different times. Other days, I wish they were on the same page, so we could just have the conversation and maybe both learn something.

SocialEngineering,3capyf,Insert-Tip,24,Mon Jul 6 12:57:24 2015 UTC,"Stand straight up Mouth closed if you are a mouth breather If you walk, walk decisively towards your destination Smile, but caution: not too much. Practice it in the mirror, and smile also with your eyes. Manage your eye contact appropriately. Don't look away or down, but also don't give everyone the death stare.  Listen, so your responses in a conversation are witty, relevant and empathic. Don't speak too much, you are not a priest in church Groom well. Good haircut (go atleast every 2-3 months), well dressed (not superold clothes) and nice shoes (essential!) There are subreddits for this and good sites. Try too have humor, but don't become a clown. People laughing with you will give you confidence. Basically be witty and not too serious. Work out. Easy way to gain confidence (beginner gains are awesome) and helps posture. Check /r/fitness for tips, it is not just lift a dumbbell. Watch movies of confident personas and emulate. George clooney, brad pitt etcetera. Think about how you percieve your inner self. Why are you asking this question, are you inherently insecure? Why is that, did you have bad experiences, do you think you look ugly, are you overweight, etcetera. Try to get to know yourself.  Realize that EVERYONE is at some point insecure and at other points confident. No one is born with only confidence.  Stop comparing. The people you compare yourself with compare themselfs aswell. And no one is better at everything you do.  Ask yourself if someone is constantly judging you for the worse. This could be your gf, brother, parent, a good friend or whatever.  If there is one, realize that the worst critics are the most insecure. They are not out to get you, but this is just them venting their insecureness. Tell them that you don't like this and you want them to stop. Burning bridges is not advised. Always try to be positive. Positive thoughts create positive words and is infectious. So is negativity. If you have negative thoughts, only vent them in a safe way (to your SO, parents) but not constantly. Speak slow. Slow down in general. Dont run around hiphopping everywhere and racing your words out of your mouth. Give someone a sincere compliment. This sounds weird, but people barely compliment each other. Use this to your advantage to make people feel great and they will return the positive feeling. Beware for cliches (nice eyes blabla) Ask yourself if you have behaviour that only comes from external. You should stay true to yourself. Speak out loud every morning and night: I am a confident person and I can do anything if I put my mind to it.    Confidence is not a destination, or a physical state like in chemistry going from liquid to solid. It is more a transient result from your feelings and behaviour.    Practice these things alone in front of the mirror. Look up a movie with a confident character and emulate the scene, mannerisms, walking talking.  Next step is acting confident around your closest peers (family, best friends, SO) This is easy, because you are probably already pretty confident with people you know very good. Final step is acting confident in the hard situations: people you don't know well, sudden situations, big group conversations or public speaking.   Very important thing you need to believe is what I call the 'Apple-myth'. Apple is the biggest company in the world, and iPhones are a phenomenon. But technologically, iPhones are by far not the best smartphones and insanely overpriced. How?  Steve jobs created this insane image of how Apple is superior. Pure marketing made people believe that apple > rest. Customers have barely knowledge about smartphone technology, so they just go with their gut which leads to apple.   Basically: Style is transparent, but substance not. If the style is good, people will believe the substance under it is good as well, even though it is not (like apple). So acting confident will make people believe that you are confident. Then their will be positive cues toward you so you will believe it as well.   Goodluck (Sorry for spelling mistakes, I am not a native speaker)"

SocialEngineering,3capyf,horja_mekan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:25:47 2015 UTC,"Because when deciding other people's worth, most people do it mostly with their emotional brain and not so much with the most advanced brain we possess.    Smiling is a sign of agreement  and too much agreement is interpreted as submission and fear of stating own opinion and as someone that is giving approval to what everybody does. We are naturally attracted to those in power and tend to respect their opinions more than others.  Of course one might smile a lot for good reasons but since most people just let their emotional brain take full control in deciding other people's status, it is interpreted wrongly.  Plus, if someone's normal state isn't smiling, when he does smile, he has a much bigger impact.  You could start practicing smiling in different amounts and situations to see for yourself where is the optimal level."

SocialEngineering,3capyf,pieandablowie,2,Mon Jul 6 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"My 2 pennies, or what has been true for me on the path to actual confidence, after I grew tired of faking:  When I have those days of tripping over my own tongue, I used to have trouble embracing that awkwardness. The more friends I have, the more I learn that everyone, even the most charming among us, feels this way sometimes. Their secret, and now mine too, is that I refuse to let it make me feel unworthy, and thusly, I'm impervious to shame. In order not to feel shame, you must accept yourself fully. To accept yourself, is to own yourself.  Ownership over my own most hated qualities, over how I look, how I feel about myself, and how I feel about the outside world, was the opposite of my feeling awkward (and at the root of that, ashamed).   I don't always make a joke out of my social blunders, depending on your audience, that doesn't always work. I do whatever I think will put them at ease (I call it ""easing the sympathetic cringe"") and move on, not only in the conversation, but in my head.   Illustration by example: I trip and stumble on my way up to speak to a group of people.   Option 1: Bungle around a bit and bow, or curtsy, perhaps slightly Charlie Chaplin-esque. Continue as if nothing happened and give them a chance to laugh.  Option 2: Call out how mortified I am. ""Shit, that's embarrassing, sorry to interrupt you. I wanted to ask about the...""  Option 3: Straighten my clothes and smile, continue to talk as though nothing happened...  I'm sure there's a bunch more options... I choose my option based on the person in the group who's opinion I need to/should care most about, not the person most likely to make negative judgements about me...since I no longer feel shame, they don't have much of an effect on me. If I feel at ease with whatever is happening to me without my permission, then the witnesses will to...and if they don't, it's no longer my problem.   I hope this helps.   Disclaimer: Shamelessness is not license to make a fool of oneself."

SocialEngineering,3c44ku,ThelemaAndLouise,3,Sat Jul 4 19:09:00 2015 UTC,i used the subreddits you linked to as context for your statement of what you thought social engineering was.  how is BIFL social engineering?
SocialEngineering,3c44ku,Etular,2,Sat Jul 4 19:11:40 2015 UTC,"Uh... Did you read that page at all?   Stating the obvious, and I'm pretty sure you're well aware of this already, but this subreddit is for the other, security-based, definition of social engineering.   This type of polysemy is the same as how, to a mechanical engineer, a ""crane"" is mechanical vehicle; whereas, to an ornithologist, a ""crane"" is a type of bird. You're like a mechanical engineer, chatting about cranes to a bunch of ornithologists (i.e. this subreddit) and telling us that we've got the wrong definition of the word.  By all means, as a social scientist myself, I would love to see a subreddit devoted to the political definition of social engineering (trying to find one, actually, is what led me here in the first place), but this is sadly not that subreddit."

SocialEngineering,3c44ku,ThelemaAndLouise,5,Tue Jul 14 00:41:44 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's what i'm saying isn't really social engineering, at least not from the perspective of this sub.  from the actual wikipedia article on the poli-sci definition instead of the disambiguation page:   Social engineering is a discipline in social science that refers to efforts to influence popular attitudes and social behaviors on a large scale, whether by governments, media or private groups.    and:   A social engineer is one who tries to influence popular attitudes, social behaviors, and resource management on a large scale. Social engineering is the application of the scientific method for social concern. Social engineers use the methods of science to analyze and understand social systems, so as to arrive at appropriate decisions as scientists, and not as politicians. In the political arena, the counterpart of social engineering is political engineering.   the other context is in infosec, which is the other article linked from the disambiguation page:   Social engineering, in the context of information security, refers to psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional ""con"" in that it is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud scheme.   and again, the sidebar:   /r/socialengineering is a subreddit dedicated to the art & science of human manipulation & social hacking, as well as public relations at an individual level.   and   We appreciate any content on social interaction, however occasionally some content requires a basic explanation, as such any links that are posted should be accompanied by a comment with a bit of written context explaining why you think it belongs here.   so me asking you how it applies is within the guidelines of the subreddit"

SocialEngineering,3c345l,LongLiveBacon,37,Sat Jul 4 08:21:43 2015 UTC,"As /u/the-garden-gnome says, network. Once you start knowing and maintaining relationships with a lot of people, it snowballs because you become the guy people talk about when they say ""I know a guy who knows a guy.""  The people who actually do stuff also tend to give you discounts and other freebies because they know that when they need something cheap, good, and fast, they'll be coming to you to ask if you know a guy. Which you will - or if you don't, you'll have a large network you can query to see if any of them know a guy - and then you add them to your direct network, and now you know a guy for that, too."

SocialEngineering,3c345l,the-garden-gnome,14,Sat Jul 4 09:19:17 2015 UTC,It's a long process of building your network. Every time I meet someone and find out what they do for a living I make it a point to not just talk with them about what they do but while I'm doing it I think of who I know in their field or who I could introduce them that could possibly help them out. Over time this translate into me knowing someone for almost every situation as well as knowing people in the right places at the right time. I'm 32 now and have been doing this actively for about 6-7 years. It's a constant process of giving and passing referrals forward but your network grows steadily.
SocialEngineering,3c345l,gootecks,2,Sat Jul 4 11:27:39 2015 UTC,"This is great advice. When you make it a point to recognize where you can help people connect up with people that could help them (either by hiring them or providing the right service at the right time), you become the guy that knows a guy for everything. This is easiest in ones own field; when I get a job offer that I can't do because of schedule or it's out of my area of expertise (i.e. somebody wants to rent lighting well beyond the scale I can provide or needs turntables or a full backline beyond what is in my inventory), I'll refer them to someone else that I know is competent and charges reasonable prices, if I know someone.  If you're always thinking of what value you can provide to the people around you, you're more likely to be the goto guy for things, even if it's just advice. It's also good for your own bottom line, because when you refer for others, they're more likely to refer for you when things come up that fit you better."

But the reality is much more complicated.  You may recall a couple months ago when /u/karmanaut made this post. The gist of which was management has been constantly ignoring the moderators that run their site for free while devoting numerous man hours to frivolous features. Despite this, business continued as usual. Then there was the FPH fiasco. While most of us agree that it was the right decision, the brunt of the fallout came down on the mods whose subreddits were brigaded. Again, we persevered without thanks or compensation. Because we love this site. Yesterday, we were informed that the new reddit search was being rolled out. Many moderators rely on the old search tool to do their job, but their pleas for access to it fell on deaf ears. Tensions were high.  Then came the straw that broke the camel's back. Victoria was let go. Whether they had good reason or not is irrelevant. She was in the midst of organizing AMAs for multiple subreddits and they received no consideration whatsoever in the decision. No one was tasked with taking over her responsibilities. The mods were left to figure it out for themselves. They either forgot about the mods, or they just didn't care. Either way, it was enough to push most of us over the edge. If they don't think they need us, then let's see how reddit works without us.

SocialEngineering,3bwqnt,Aiadon,5,Thu Jul 2 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"Taken from this page: ""In a variable-interval schedule, the reinforcers appear on an interval schedule, but the timing is varied around the average interval, making the actual appearance of the reinforcer unpredictable. An example might be checking your e-mail: You are reinforced by receiving messages that come, on average, say every 30 minutes, but the reinforcement occurs only at random times. Interval reinforcement schedules tend to produce slow and steady rates of responding.""  Here's a helpful figure.  The example of checking email is a good real world one that allows you to get out of the rat pressing a lever mindset.  Not sure what you're using intermittent reinforcement for, but I hope it's ethical, cause it's certainly effective."

SocialEngineering,3bwqnt,Coz7,2,Sat Jul 4 00:27:17 2015 UTC,"Intermittent reinforcement is not using reinforcement strategies all the time; nothing more, it has nothing to do with the type of reinforcement. If you have an entrained response, and skip positive reinforcement, the target will try harder next... up to a point, that is, there's an optimal amount of positive reinforcements, and you'll have to look the specifics of this by yourself. However, if you do it with a negative reinforcement it's detrimental, as the target might react by 'trying to see if they can get away with it', but you can lessen the effect by making the punishment so big that it's not worth the risk.  I see no circumstance where punishing the desired behavior is beneficial.  Also remember that reinforcement should be immediate, and that punishment should be accompanied of providing an alternative, desired behavior.  Some gamblers will have negative thoughts, others will not give a fuck. It's variable."

If its local, ask others who work there, if it has a website or wiki page read up on its history, etc.  Showing you have the enthusiasm to learn about the organisation and the potential role you will play is far more important than displaying confidence during the interview, and you may find a bit of research and additional knowledge actually gives you a boost in confidence for walking in there.  True confidence in the workplace is built with experience, and displaying a willingness and interest in gaining that experience will impress a potential employer much more, than a cocky young lad mouthing off about how great he is right at the start of his career."

When you get out of the Army you get put through classes that teach this kind of stuff because they're tired of seeing homeless vets. I took the course like 6 times because it meant not being at work, anyways.  For job interviews:  1) Show up 10 minutes early. Not too much earlier, and not later. Too much earlier (like a half hour) and it shows you're way too anxious, later and it shows you're retarded.   2) Dress one level above what the workplace is. If its casual, wear a nice shirt with dress pants. If its business casual, wear a suit. If everyone is wearing suits, wear a nice suit. If everyone is wearing tuxes, you're applying to be a butler.   3) Turn your phone off. Not on silent. Off.  4) The interviewer will ask if you have any questions. Ask questions. Ask good questions. Ones that imply you're going to be there for the long haul. ""How are promotions handled"" and ""Does your company match and 401k/retirement contributions"" are great questions. Also asking why this position is open.  5) The biggest mistake people make is not asking for the job. You don't have to say it outright, but you should say something like ""I think I'd be a good fit here.""   6) Know a little bit about the company. They'll ask you why you want to work there. ""I need a job"" is a bad answer. ""I like the things they've been doing and I dont have to worry about them going out to business"" is what I used on my last interview (and got the job)"

So, I'll just say this works for me personally.   You've got to honestly evaluate your worth, and what you bring to the table for the intended workplace. Have several backup plans. The intent is that while you want this particular job, you can live without it. This lowers the stakes mentally, and allows you to be more relaxed. Try, before the interview, to do some small thing you love or that makes you comfortable. Gets you in the right mindset. During the interview, try to view the person as a friend who's also your boss, and you're at work. You have casual familiarity, but you still have to show respect and restraint. After the interview, cleanse it from your mind save some regular time to check up on it. It's in the past."

It is said that us humans have a desire to discover patterns in other's behaviors, to see when they react bad, when they react good and intermittent reinforcement done right can make the person try so hard to find those patterns that will make them obsessed with it and if the tactic is done by a person, the obsession might just be associated with the manipulator.

SocialEngineering,3br1ji,DaemonXI,3,Wed Jul 1 18:59:39 2015 UTC,"A lot of what youre asking depends on so many other factors.  Your own attitude and abilities, the environment youre working in, there are too many other details.  i.e. does your job depend on this? do you care if it does? is there any reason not to be more direct / borderline hostile when approaching them about bullshitting?  is that something youre capable of?  sometimes being polite isnt the right way to deal with certain people or types of people and you can come off as even more of an asshole (dont beat around the bush). how do your colleagues, individually and as a group, view the situation(s)?  have you sat with them individually, behind closed doors, and asked them?  more information comes out when you can talk to people individually and ask questions there, then bring the facts to the situation.  drive the conversation without asking questions in the group setting.  try first bringing specifics to everyones attention behind closed doors and seeing if you can get more information.  without divulging that information (and making your allies look bad)  use that to change your approach.  maybe dealing primarily through email stating facts (if your company is the type that needs that level of thoroughness) or if the situation calls for it, being more direct in the group meetings.  you can be direct and to the point and tell folks you just want things right, youre not there to push them out but to help them do the right thing.     at the end of the day it may be less about backroom dealing and more just about life.  meaning, some people realize that you could have hired company A, B or C and they all are going to have issues.  You have to make the best of the situation and figure out how to get it done with whoever you hire or risk losing a lot of contract time, relationship and work experience building that has already taken place.  figure out what needs to be done to make you more successful then work with individuals or smaller groups to understand the problem on more levels.  use that information to build a stronger case for whatever youre trying to accomplish."
SocialEngineering,3br1ji,DaemonXI,2,Wed Jul 1 15:27:02 2015 UTC,"My job does not depend on this but I do need to work with others on my same managerial level.

I am at the point now, where it is so cut-and-dry (she is making uneducated statements of legal opinion which are not accurate) that I feel a confrontation is becoming unavoidable. I'd be happy to just move on but doing so seems to mean accepting her false information as fact and that could be causing us some problems down the road. Problems we could possibly avoid by confronting them now."
SocialEngineering,3br1ji,kite_height,3,Wed Jul 1 21:14:55 2015 UTC,"If you have to contradict someone, a good way to start out is ""I may be wrong, but my understanding was..."" which helps because it doesn't sound like you're calling them out on false information. If the job depends on having the right information, it sounds like by saying nothing you're doing a disservice to anyone involved. I'd be delicate in bringing it up, but just make sure that you're just working for the best interests of all parties. Be persistent and hopefully it will start happening less."

He should have kept all of that the same to do a true test (i was impressed with how many busses he tried it on in his Tux at the start)."
SocialEngineering,3bmbm9,ra13,15,Tue Jun 30 13:37:16 2015 UTC,"The thing I noticed most was the change in confidence. In a tux he almost always already went to the back of the bus before he even asked if it was OK, which he never did when he was dressed poorly."
SocialEngineering,3bmbm9,TheCi,8,Tue Jun 30 18:00:24 2015 UTC,"I was disappointed with this as well; he totally dropped his confident ""I can do this, it's OK, we both know what's up, everything's cool"" attitude when he changed clothes. While his demeanor likely affects the final outcome, judging from the snarky responses and shitty attitudes of the drivers, it's possible their minds were truly made up from the moment they saw him. They were just plain mean to him."
SocialEngineering,3bmbm9,sthprk33,5,Tue Jun 30 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, his first demeanour could have been indicating that he left his wallet on the bus and was going to get it, he sits down and the driver just doesn't want to get up because they just realised they said it was ok and there was a misunderstanding.   E.g. ""Oh you thought I meant on the bus? I wanted a ride and you said it was ok"" - this makes the driver the look like a rude asshole.   His second demeanour actually challenged the right to pay, instead of offering a confusing double ended question with dual interpretations (one for the driver, one to use to play the fool).  E.g. ""So you are saying I cannot get a free ride?"" - this makes the guy look like a rude asshole and forces a correctly interpreted response from the driver."
SocialEngineering,3bmbm9,Seesawkarma,4,Tue Jun 30 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"Granted, few people wear tuxedos day-to-day and it is expected that he is not a typical bus-rider. When you look typical, you're treated with the typical rules."
SocialEngineering,3bmbm9,AcidCyborg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:31:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe the way he was dressed had an effect on his body language and confidence. Also, he was carrying bags while he was 'homeless' so that obviously is going to affect his body language and gestures."
SocialEngineering,3bmbm9,shatteredcell22,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:18:18 2015 UTC,I disagree. His tone/confidence wasn't that different. Appearances mean a lot and I think you could be inferring his confidence went down because of how he is dressed.
SocialEngineering,3bmbm9,particularindividual,15,Wed Jul 1 01:35:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting! What is the Heuristic in play? Might it be that bus drivers have been conditioned to reject street people, bums, homeless, etc., because they often misbehave? And a smiling, confident man in a tuxedo on a bus asking an odd question is a pattern interrupt? Too many variables unaccounted for. Change in time of day, weather, also did the ""bum"" use the same body language, eye contact and voice quality? Hard to say. No doubt we do judge a book by its cover. Fun video. Thanks for posting."
SocialEngineering,3bmbm9,AvidWanker,14,Tue Jun 30 13:39:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the drivers think that a homeless person would be more likely to try to cheat their way out of paying because of how tight money is, compared to a rich person for whom the fare is inconsequential."
SocialEngineering,3bmbm9,itsjh,4,Tue Jun 30 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"I hadn't even considered that... There could be several thoughts running through their heads when the snazzy dressed man gets on the bus with his confident attitude: ""obviously he can afford to pay"", ""he probably did purchase a ticket already"", ""who is this guy, could he cause trouble for me if I deny him?"", etc.. So many variables!"
SocialEngineering,3bmbm9,sthprk33,3,Tue Jun 30 17:07:33 2015 UTC,Nah its a false correlation. A more accurate evaluation would be: Guy who looks like he dropped his wallet in bus asks to look for it VS Guy who has no money wants a free ride

Same goes for aggression, the other heavily associated social response to eye contact.   So basically you are both trying to not show aggression, or attraction.  Because of this, you can actually make someone act super submissive by maintaining eye contact. It feels weird, but try it out (not on an aggressive person). But you will probably start questioning your attraction to the person you are doing it to if they are a friend purely because of your association of it with attraction - not because you are actually attracted to them.  It's one of the reasons couples fighting can go the other way so quickly, they both get confused at which eye contact they are making. I.e. You don't love fighting with her, you just love the eye contact that feels identical to her high attraction eye contact."
SocialEngineering,3bkd67,phlosys,4,Tue Jun 30 04:54:12 2015 UTC,"In most cultures, eye contact longer than a few moments is associated with being deeply intimate.  This is why heterosexual men generally have no problem looking at attractive females, in the eyes for prolonged periods of time, it subcommunicates intimate intention. Unfortunately because of this, we take it to mean that the other person in all situations wants this deep intimacy, which is why most heterosexual men associate it with homosexual intentions."
SocialEngineering,3bkd67,CandyQueefdom,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:04:05 2015 UTC,"I was thinking something along the lines that we teach men to be very independent, emotionally and otherwise... So, extended eye contact being a very intimate thing would portray vulnerability, which seems like something men are taught to be ashamed of.   Even though they are close, true friends.. They can't break passed society's limitation on the rapport of their relationship."
SocialEngineering,3bkd67,TomC0x,3,Tue Jun 30 10:37:27 2015 UTC,"Uhm, I guess that's one way of looking at it and it seems plausible enough unless you take into account all of the carious other contexts it happens in (e.g interviews) and then it doesn't seem nearly as consistent. Fist of all, prolonged eye-gaze is a sign of a interest, not affection. And I'm sure we're all familiar with how unwanted interest can feel like an intrusion.  Somewhat off-topic but feel like sharing it anyway. I don't know if any of you explicitly know of this but if you unfocus your vision you get to see at a wider angle (albeit at the cost of fine details). Which is a very useful trick for observation (you get to see the persons facial expressions, body language and the car driving past in the background without having to keep your eyes darting all over the place. So last year I set out to make it into a habit. I was doing it for over 6 months. After around 3 mths it was basically automatic, it became the normal state for my eyes to be in. And then I realised that despite being very useful for observation it gave me that vacant uninterrupted stare that apparently psychopaths in movies often get depicted with (someone told me that). I wonder how that made people feel :P"

SocialEngineering,3bkd67,TomC0x,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:06:33 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, Social Psychology sees it as a defensive (avoidant) behaviour, where the eye-gaze is shifted so as to get rid of the stimuli that was causing us discomfort (for whatever reason) out of our field of view.  Now, what makes us feel uncomfortable and why, is a huge topic, especially so for aversive eye gaze because its both very common and very diverse. So pinpointing the reason behind it would be pretty hard to do. Except for OPs case, where they're clearly in love but are too afraid to show it. What would people think, right?! - It's 2015!

SocialEngineering,3b6rdf,Fartoholic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:46:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly get what you're saying. Having stimulation in a conversation is exciting because you learn what inspires someone through external facts and news events.  However, sometimes people don't have facts or are even aware of the current events happening around the world. But a resource people will always have is personal experience, emotions, and the ability to relate towards another person to some degree. Stimulation is great, but it'll be meaningless if you have nothing to go with. That's the excitement about telling people your embarrassing moments, your scared experienced, and your happy past. It no longer becomes a conversation based on how much you remember about this or that. It becomes a conversation on how much you can dig into your own emotions to add into the conversation. That's where it becomes effortlessly."

SocialEngineering,3b4kb7,kevinambrosia,9,Fri Jun 26 01:24:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, is this your understanding of how people around you actually think of you or is it how people around you actually think of you? There is a huge difference. Saying things like ""my demeanor strikes people as arrogant"" is not so much defining the problem so much as it is putting your judgement on the problem. This is a very subtle difference, but it is important to understand in order to actually fix the problem.   For instance, if your problem is being arrogant, the only solution really is to think less of your self, to err on the side of humility, play with being lightly personally derogative, and keep on going. Point out your mistakes and laugh at them, talk less about your achievements, mix in pointing out what you don't know along with pointing out what you do. And most importantly, don't try to one-up people. However, this may not fix the issue entirely, but it's a great step to help. It is very revealing, if you think other people think you're arrogant; chances are, you are. But that does not mean that a more humble you will be any less intimidating to talk to.   Conversation styles are also important. What you might read as intimidation due to arrogance may be actually just be that they don't like how the conversation flow is going. Maybe it's way too much about you, maybe they don't feel you're listening (are you actually?), maybe they aren't interested in what you have to say. If you keep talking about how amazing you are at Kerbal space program, it might not be that they think you're arrogant (although in the hypothetical situation, that may be part of it) so much as they might not even give two shits about Kerbal.   To sum up, yes, you might be arrogant and that might take some work. But also, pay attention to your conversation style and make sure your conversations are about shared interests, too."
SocialEngineering,3b4kb7,Seesawkarma,2,Fri Jun 26 00:39:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting points, thanks for the reply.  It is my understanding. Jugded by the looks I get, the lack of common courtesies (e.g. I'm often not even getting a ""good morning!"") and the overall vibe I percieve. I strongly believe that it's mainly because of the visual cues I put out there and because of the way I speak. I naturally have a very stern face, I like to dress spiffy and I talk in a bloated manner from time to time. Granted: Attributes of a douchebag. But I don't think it's fair to judge only on the basis of looks and manner of speaking, without knowing the personality behind it. I am actively trying to look for chances where I can be humble or self-ironic. The sad thing is that I don't even get to the point where I could apply any of that.  So I guess what would help is to put on a happy face, act humble (especially towards older co-workers) and try to make myself more approchable.  ... and man, I suck at Kerbal!"
SocialEngineering,3b4kb7,Fartoholic,14,Fri Jun 26 01:20:48 2015 UTC,"You just describing yourself and actions already started to make me think you are arrogant.   Expecting a 'good morning', expecting different reactions from people, expecting that 'being more spiffy' or committing humble or self-ironic actions matters all lead me to the same end point.   Respect.  Your problem is that you either do not accurately respect others, or over value the respect that you think you deserve.   But, respect is often hard fought and sometimes unfair. But you almost never get it because you'deserve it'.  People pick up on this like a bad smell, as an expectant air of self respect also implies your clear belief in self importance. Or, in other words: They can tell you want respect, so they don't give you any.  Respect is totally different from one person to another, to get the respect of a stranger you may just have to hold a door open, for another you might have to take a bullet for them. It is being able to tell which type of respect people use that will help you here.  Now you could decide to find out how to build trust with each person individually, but this takes a lot of time and effort on your part - and it is hard not to take the easy way and lie about being trustworthy to them.   Or, you can target the most humble person at your work and befriend them at any cost. Learn their ways, open yourself to their knowledge and try it out. Wear their skin and see how it fits, metaphorically speaking of course.   Otherwise, you could always remember the dog analogy of attention. If you want a dog to stop hating you, stop giving it attention. You devalue their importance in your own mind, and theirs. They start to wonder why you do not want their attention, and they start to inquire about it. Whether they come to you and talk about it or ask discretely via other people - the group of people around you are talking about you now and that is the attention you desired. Do not make your friendship so easily earned itself perhaps. Let them come to you, let them set how long the conversation goes for, let them be the ones who control the topic and level of discretion being used, but make it a two way process. Don't mindlessly banter or copy them, experience the conversation with them and show them you enjoy talking to them and most importantly show them that their reactions to you are seen and interpreted correctly. If you think they think you said something arrogant...ask them if that is what they thought. Make them be the person who shapes you, let them know you are clay to be moulded by them because you respect them."

SocialEngineering,3b0dqk,EquipLordBritish,16,Thu Jun 25 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what /u/sygo 's link said. Squatting down next to a table is an easy thing to fuck up. It will benefit you most with Baby-Boomers and children between ages 4-12. It's important to smile and look for eye contact. Don't squat down to bother a 2 top though, unless you are being greeted with a sincere smile.  There are  a number of reasons that could bring a guest into your restaurant, it's important to determine what the occasion is for these gatherings and act accordingly.   Posture is a HUGE indicator when it comes to knowing how to talk to your tables. If they are engaged in an interesting conversation then both parties will be leaning forward, and the person doing the listening will be sitting relatively still. To these people, you should try to become invisible. When you walk up to the table to check on something: use your eyes instead your mouth. Make sure you walk by this table a number of times to make yourself available, but never engage unless they seek out eye contact in passing. When you drop the check make sure to reassure them that they are welcome to stay as long as they like. Most of the time I'll set the check down and say something simple like ""It's no hurry"". Once you run their payment it's somewhat important to humanize yourself and ask them if they have any additional needs. These kinds of tables are really good tippers, and they also have very specific needs.   I wrote a bit more than I expected, I would be happy to talk more about the different table types if you like."

For example, if you think a $25 tip is appropriate, write the number 25 in the corner and circle it. The customer will see it and think it's the table number or something, but subconsciously, when they are searching for a dollar value to tip, that number you wrote will be in their head and they are more likely to use it.

Mostly because I'm lazy and 20% is easy math.   Last time I got mad and gave the guy a 9% tip was because of the following: Wifes food was missing avocado on the sandwich no big deal happens all the time plus he had no control over that. However took him forever to check on us. had to wave him down, once we told him he went around doing other stuff like getting refills for other people, took 10minutes to get them.   He was super rushed running here and there. Never show you are rushed. He was talking to us while walking away.   Ordered some desert and wanted to add something extra to it before I could he ran away plus wanted coffee. So I had no coffee and didn't have the desert I wanted.  I was so upset almost left no tip.   I have had some amazing waiters you could tell they were busy but never showed it. Stood there and talked walked away and then started to quickly walk. Never interpreting a conversation just did his thing. If we weren't talking he would ask how things were.  Made sure that we knew we could stay as long as we wanted. Overall perfect waiter gave him almost 30% on 100 ticket.    Most I have ever tipped was $150 on a $60 meal with some friends at ihop at 2am. Just because she was cool middle age woman. She didnt do anything special besides keeping a smile after being on her second shift. We asked for the information she didn't just say it. As we walked away we saw through the glass her jumping up and down in enjoyment.   Bottom line, keep a smile. Makes the guest feel welcome.

And if i have to ask twice or remind you then you're at 10%. If it happens twice 5% tip. 3x; nothing. Be attentive, courteous, and prompt. You do all of this perfectly you get 20%. Grow a pair of tits for a chance at an extra 5% if you're an exceptional waitress. Also going that extra mile [when appropriate] can land a 25% tip from me; but this happens very rarely. Like once a year.  Fail anything on the list you'll be lucky to get 15% even if it's the busiest day of the year, the cook is in a coma, and the geriatrics home is visiting."

""I enjoyed being your server, and there is no rush to pay this. In fact I am in a great mood. Another table just gave me a 30% tip, and it really made my day.""  The wording needs fine tuning. The goal is to leverage social pressure. They too want to be thought of in a positive light. If they give a generous tip, you might be telling the next table how great they were. And also they know you will appreciate the generosity.  If anyone tests this, then let me know if it works. I'd love to hear my idea resonated with you. It's silly, but when your comment gets lots of up votes, it really boosts your mood. :-)"

Can't completely trust them all. I've worked around enough offices to know not to make friends with anyone at work, regardless of how nice they are. When push comes to shove, they will exploit your kindness and throw you under the bus for reasons big and small.  TL;DR: Don't make friends at work. It's okay to be friendly and nice, help each other out, but remember that you aren't friends. Because friends have each other's backs and look out for each other, regardless of who's wrong or right (unless you're a rapist, pedophile, or serial murderer)."

This was the one I worked alongside the most and who's work load was going to be impacted the most by my absence. That being said, it was a small company and it was made clear that I had already been promoted as high as I was going to get, and that the company was going to have to grow before my pay would increase. That is the definition of a dead end job.  Oddly enough the one who seemed not to care either way was the one who cut the checks... I don't know if he made that call or what.  Anyway, the one who was happy and proud of me is the one who did all of the business networking and has all the good connections so she will always be a good reference for me.

It is also a dead end job for me and it wasn't gonna help me a lot more career wise, and never did money wise. I don't know what anyone would take that personally, that I want to work towards something in my life.  He made me sit through meetings about how they'll have to organize and work when I'm gone and comments in front of me about how it'll be complicated for them... And has been looking at me and saying ""only x more days, huh? You happy?"" For the past 2 weeks... Like in a friendly manner, but anyway.  Anyway I'm doing fine.

It only guarantees that your line will be on the same plane--meaning in the same realm, no certainty that it's in the same direction.  Then with two markers, you know the realm and direction, and with three markers, well I can't remember how it goes after that--I just mean it to illustrate that until I see at least one more episode I'll remain nervous and completely uncertain of where it's going, and afterward I'll feel a bit more secure but still nervous.    I mean, even The Wire got too confident in itself after season 4 (the best season/show that has been aired of anything to date in the medium of television) and just got kind of weird and unhinged in the final season 5, so... my trust is forever wary and contingent.  And if you're a silicon Valley follower (I'd be surprised if anyone who really likes one show, doesn't also really like the other show--they're entirely different with very little overlap other than the basic ""computer/tech"" genre, and yet they both have strong appeal to the same population segment, albeit for different reasons), you may have seen how enraged a lot of people were by the penultimate episode of this season, how ""they built up so much goodwill and threw it all away in the end of one episode"".  Personally I was fine with episode 8 (it's nothing special about me, it's pretty much random that my particular viewing of the show wasn't damaged by the substantial technical dissonance in that episode, but I totally respect why it would hurt so many viewers)--just citing it as an example of how you can think a show is hitting all the right notes, but you didn't quite know the showrunner's mind, and they turn it in a direction that you think destroys everything you loved about the show... which somehow makes sense to them even while it alienates a huge segment of the cult audience.

SocialEngineering,3alqvp,TexasComments,2,Sun Jun 21 20:24:38 2015 UTC,"In Bitcoin? Most cumulative cryptographic proof of work wins when determining which blockchain (version of the transaction history) to use. An honest majority will accumulate proof of work through mining on top of an honestly generated chain faster than any malicious minority can.   In some other protocols you rely on gatekeepers (closed group) and at least 1 honest node, like for example in group random number generation using commitment schemes with cryptographic hashes.   What's so fascinating is that with many of these protocols, any distrust along the participants will actually amplify the trust in the correctness of the result to outside observers, since the participants likely would not agree to any one malicious change, and conflicting attacks will either cancel out and thus preserve the security or make the entire protocol run fail such that you get no output at all."

I definitely understand where you're coming from when you said    It has required training and endless education, and it has changed my life in nearly every aspect.  But for some, the term is used for when a free warranty deal is obtained or a loved one is tricked into exposing a secret.   but I think it's important to keep that under the same term, even though I personally would like to distance myself from such people when I use the term ""social engineer.""  While it definitely doesn't require anywhere near the same amount of research, education, experience, etc it is still uses some of the same techniques and exploits the exact same (people) flaws.  Much like skiddies, there are probably far more of these types of ""social engineers"" who simply look for the lowest hanging fruit to make some quick cash.  My interests are more in line with cognitive hacking, and other larger scope, or more complex aspects - but I still think it's still important to keep up on some of the techniques the skiddie type SE is using.  Not because it's revolutionary, but because it still works - just like internet scams we've known about for decades still work.  Many companies are still failing to properly educate their employees and are paying the price for it... and waiting until tutorials start popping up on the typical refunding type sites is far too late to be addressing the problems that allow for people to do these sorts of things."

Things can go wrong at every step, like the delivery person may leave a calling card which goes wrong, or they may just lose your parcel at the depot. Truth is you really needed to keep that tracking code (check your receipts?).  But it is also the least likely situation that the seller is screwing you over. You are showing all the hallmarks of an impatient customer. Things take time, people involved have other roles to fulfill apart from just processing your parcel especially. Just chill, wait and see. I'm sure the parcel will turn up.  And if he is screwing you over there is literally nothing meaningful you can do without the tracking number. But I would bet $100 he isn't."

SocialEngineering,39maam,InsufficientMemory,3,Sat Jun 13 03:47:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't say anything about being fancy. Exactly the opposite, in fact.  A clipboard elevates you above the grunts. Puts you in a position of authority. It draw attention. Makes you look like a coordinator or inspector depending on where you are.  There are many more grunts, making them easier to blend in with. Often they're spread across many different groups from many different companies meaning nobody's going to assume you're working for them and will let you go on about your business. You'd be much better off with a hard hat, a reflective vest, and a power drill."

But she wasn't 100% sure, and I appeared to be, so she wavered, and boom.

SocialEngineering,39i51y,Aiadon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:46:58 2015 UTC,"That would make sense. And gang activity would be bad.  If you can do it, why not?"
SocialEngineering,39i51y,jenkinsonfire,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that from the perspective of the school staff.  There are rules against any sort of flag or unique identification in the way you dress or whatever in order to reduce gang activity in schools.  We were told we couldn't wear bandanas or have different colored shoelaces in school because it could be considered gang colors.  Pretty idiotic.  If you guys all start a trend to visually identify yourselves as part of a group, the school will stop that very fast.    Perhaps create a societal structure and then place yourselves in positions of power from the beginning.  Propose the creation of a school club that would have some benefit which you would not receive if you were not a part."

SocialEngineering,39bwgx,NutterButterLoverxx,2,Wed Jun 10 20:29:25 2015 UTC,first step is to define your goals. what do you want out of the interaction? do you want to go unnoticed? do you want to make friends? do you want to get them to buy things from you?

SocialEngineering,39bwgx,cruyff8,2,Thu Jun 11 03:27:34 2015 UTC,"That's rather simple. Beware, personal experience:  Sustained eye contact is 90% (made up number, but I'm sure not so far from reality) of the time an invitation to approach; avoid if you do not want to interact. The other 10% is unimportant, as approaching and ending the interaction, if it was not an invitation to approach, is not expensive.  If you already know this, but you just want to know which would be a better way to start the interaction, approach unless you have crafted a scenario where the person will be strongly compelled to approach you (given that you're asking this, I doubt you can craft it). Approaching is better simply because you are 100% sure that there will be an interaction, while if you wait, often the other person won't approach.  Worst case scenario is waiting until the person breaks eye contact then you approach the person.  Note that 'how to approach' is a completely different and very broad question.  TL;DR: approach."
SocialEngineering,39bwgx,Coz7,4,Thu Jun 11 04:37:40 2015 UTC,Id say it all depends on your motive.   If you're attracted and just want to say hi then definitely crack in with a happy smile and greeting. But if you just want a quiet drink...
SocialEngineering,39bwgx,rfdevere,2,Wed Jun 10 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"It depends on what exactly you're looking for. I've got some experience in ""pick up artistry"" literature on how to tip someone a little off balance in an initial encounter.  You want to give them some feeling like they're trying to impress you. In general, you might stand beside them and say hey withough looking at them and wait for them to produce some nugget of conversation before they ""attract your attention"" and you turn around. That way, it's sort of like they're trying to get your attention.  Of course, this is very easy to get completely wrong and look like a huge creep. If you just want to talk to someone, as mentioned, /r/socialskills is what you want. Don't think you need to trick someone into talking to you.

I realise it's highly judgemental to assume social engineers from around the globe can be placed into such neat boxes but you see little clusters.  German gothic hackers from Berlin...  My favourite would be the professional con men and old time fraudsters on the streets on London. This truly is the stuff of films (think Thomas crown affair)   You see clusters in America, Israel and Russia especially that are quite simply über technical. I'm slowly working my way through it all. Tripwire are publishing a second article soon for London.  The music Sakawa believers like is a little like this: http://youtu.be/uBUdKfz1kUY it's a little bit like Sean Paul/Shaggy beach vibes with usually a story underlining some scam. Catchy! If nothing else.  In the case of African emails, you can identify with the persistence and nature/frequency of the mails. You don't pay a large sum of money and visit a priest simply to forget it all over a few unopened emails. By the time of prayer the scammer already has an attachment to the mark and would be constantly researching. The cliche mention of poor spelling is a little give away but they have evolved skills that still to this day don't get the credit they deserve. Also any scam email that goes into religious territory unneeded ""we shall pray for this emails safe return"" etc.  Keep them coming if you want."

They do this every day and are probably bored /lazy/angry buearocrats who get little to no respect from whoever they encounter.  My suggestion is to ""Jack Nicholson"" it.  Be high energy, a little flirty, make jokes.  When you meet them going in for a strong handshake with full eye contact.  Call then Sir or Ma'am, unless they tell you those first names and then call them by that exclusively, a little more than you normally would.  Rule #1 of social engineering is that everyone's favorite word is their own name.  Obviously, there is no one-size-fit-all, but I find this works in most situations. If the person seems visibly annoyed or angry, DO NOT start this approach without diffusing the situation with self-depreciating humor.  E.x.  ""Hi I'm the next asshole you have to put up with."" etc..  Also, homemade cookies never hurt anybody.    If they accept the cookies and then make a comment/joke about you trying to bribe them, look them in the eye and say yes.  EDIT:  This will only tip you over the edge if you are borderline.

Fraud is both a civil wrong (i.e., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud and/or recover monetary compensation) and a criminal wrong (i.e., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities). The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, such as obtaining a drivers license by way of false statements.

It is a fine line between good social engineering which is often fraud and great social engineering which isn't. though the costs of perusing such a case, out weigh any gains.

My point is that, while I agree with you, that many people are into social engineering for personal gain, usually at the cost of others, It is only bad in my opinion because it is short sighted, and as you said often at the expense of others. It is not hard to apply social engineering to make your life better, for personal gain, with out malice, or callous behaviour.  Making personal gains by shaking the right hands, rather than stepping on peoples backs. it is a small difference and to an outside perspective maybe indistinguishable. but I think if we are being open and honest with ourselves we don't make friends IRL our of a sense of giving and altruism, if we are going to do it for personal gain, we may as well but some thought and foresight behind it, should we not?"

I ran a check and returned the name of the person who owned that website and his phone number   good preparation.   I found a friend of his, not a close acquaintance but not distant either, they had attended university together and hadn't seemed to have spoke since.   good, everyone with in 1 degree of separation of the target is always useful.    Fuck it, I was going to pretend to be his friend from university, I sent him a text.   so close, still a great job I'd rate it 7-8/10 you got what you wanted but you are slightly exposed. if he contracts his friend again he might get wise, as well as I assume he has your phone number, and what ever info might be associated with your game account.  in the end it was a lie, a small lie but one you can be caught with, and technically fraud by misrepresentation. again not a big issue, though some people here will say its stealing and they are technically right, that can be avoided.  Instead of pretending to be his friend, you could use the information to befriend him, its a fairly quick conversation to ""what do you do for a living, Oh make computer games, thats really cool I'd love to try it"" and suddenly you have gone from stealing to receiving a legitimate gift. it is a very fine line indeed, but not breaking laws, not lying or having done or said anything to be caught out on is what defines a perfect social engineer.  I wouldn't bother making this comment if I didn't think it was useful or you were capable, I definitely think you could aspire to a bit more, and those with plenty think nothing of sharing what they have with friends, good luck."

Plus, he could easily obfuscate his tracks using a throwaway VOIP number (like Google Voice) or a service like TextEm. Sure, if dev talks to his friend, he might know that he was taken, but there is little he could do about it if one hides their identity (unless the game has some sort of tracking feature, which is doubtful)."

I know people that have thousands of friends on Facebook; that doesn't mean that they actually have a relationship with even a fraction of those people. All that your ""100% Facebook friend accept"" means is that people don't dislike you enough to immediately turn you down.  Your problem is that you come off as a salesman. You're only interacting with people for the sole purpose of selling them something, but you're trying to pretend to care about them. Try talking to people for more than 10 minutes, get to know them, and don't try to sell them your product right then. Add them on Facebook, and then, a couple days later, talk to them and say, ""Hey, I've got this project I'm working on, I thought you might be interested in it."" If they say no, then let it go. If they're not interested, they might have friends that could be, but you don't need to ask about it - they'll tell you, or they'll tell their friends - if you have a product that's actually useful.  You'll create fewer, but more powerful relationships. This way, instead of having, for example, 500 people ignoring you on Facebook, you'll have 100 people that are willing to play your advocate to their friends or coworkers, even if they themselves aren't interested in your product."

Bill Clinton is known for his attentiveness when talking to people. He engages audiences and individuals by listening to them, not selling his political agenda. It may ultimately be self serving, but it works because the person believes Clinton is genuinely interested in their life. It wasn't: ""Hey I'm Bill. You in politics? No? Pizza guy, huh? Any skills? No? Wanna vote for me? Cool dude, see you on facebook"".  Politicians also spend a great deal of time strategizing where and when they'll be campaigning, and choose places that have high probability for success. They even brand themselves with apolitical hobbies and skills to seem relatable (i.e Clinton's sax playing).  I have networked at parties, but first you need to determine if someone gives a fuck. There've been people I've met at parties who did have a concept/product/business model that I could've been interested in, but was ultimately turned off by because they were obviously only interested in talking to me to advance their own career. Huge turnoff.  So much of social engineering involves the right place, the right time/setting, and the right audience; it doesn't seem as if you have any these three in this situation.

On the topic of group pressure, this can be very powerful. I've experienced this first hand and knew it was happening but was incapable of stopping it... I was at the final table of a charity poker event. It was a $100 buy-in and half the proceeds were going to the charity and half to the payouts. We were all in the money at this point, but first place was something like $800, second $600, third $400, and fourth $300. Others who had already been knocked out had collected some smaller sums.  There was a crowd around us, watching the game play out, and one of the other finalists announced, loudly, that he would donate half of his payout winnings to the charity, too.  The rest of us were basically put on the spot and had to make an immediate decision whether to also do the same or disagree (and look like an asshole).  We all agreed, of course, to do the same. And guess what. Mr. Generous was the next one out. I went on to win and only took home half of first place's payout, which was half of the money raised already."

A person affected by peer pressure may or may not want to belong to these groups. They may also recognise dissociative groups with which they would not wish to associate, and thus they behave adversely concerning that group's behaviors.

Sure, rationally you can look at a complainer and realize there is something wrong with them and that you should also recognize their positives.  That's great, and keeps you from making negative assumptions about them that may not be valid.  But incessant complaining is still extremely annoying, which is an emotion that doesn't go away.   If you have to work in an office next to a guy with Tourette's, even knowing that it's a condition that is beyond his control won't make it less annoying - it just helps you not hate the guy.    I think peeps in this sub would likely be more interested in methods for getting said person to stop complaining as often around them as opposed to methods to get their brain to a zen place where they just didn't care.  Though both methods would solve the problem, if they worked."

SocialEngineering,37qjmm,illjustcheckthis,24,Sat May 30 13:06:44 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he's interested. Navigating romantically with a woman is hard if you haven't put time into developing the skill set, because women will softball both when they want you to leave them alone and when they want you to be persistent.   Don't reply to his texts. Turn off notifications for his texts, and call him to discuss business, never mentioning anything that isn't business related.   Women usually drop the boyfriend line if they want to dissuade you. Even if you're not seeing someone, tell him you're meeting up with or calling your boyfriend. If he says he didn't know you were dating, tell him you like to keep your personal and professional life separate.   The difficulty women have in dissuading interested men often comes from not wanting to be accountable for the repercussions  of the action. You might hurt his feelings no matter what you do, and he might stop calling you for work once he realizes he doesn't have a chance with you. Prolonging the situation actually makes this more likely.  And a critique, ""I'm not a big texter"" would be more effective without ""so don't expect responses"" because the tag is an apology for how your behavior appears."

SocialEngineering,37qjmm,RoNPlayer,1 point,Fri May 29 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"You said that the behavior OP described (his own) in the post can be found both by women interested in the other as by women not interested. I got a similar response (""I'm not the kind of person who texts much"") from a girl i'm interested in.  Are there ways (or can you link me to posts) how to identify which kind of ""softballing"" this is? Because on the other hand she showed no kind of attempts of rejection when i asked her if she wants to go to the theater with me next week."
SocialEngineering,37qjmm,ThelemaAndLouise,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:02:13 2015 UTC,"I think you just have to discern it based on context over time. If a girl said she didn't text much, I would probably call her when I wanted to see her. It's a better way to communicate interest, and sets you apart anyway.   If I'd invited her several time and each time she rejects without apology or doesn't respond, I would move on. It might be worthwhile to change the character of what you invite her to do each time. No theater? Rock climbing outside of the city. No rock climbing? Dinner party at your place."
SocialEngineering,37qjmm,RoNPlayer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"I will think about calling her in the future, instead of writing.  So far she was really open when i asked her to do stuff together (like going to the theater), yet the signals are mixed."
SocialEngineering,37qjmm,ThelemaAndLouise,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"I find for myself it's generally best to not think about ambiguity too much. If you're interested and she hasn't made it clear either way, you can't come to an accurate understanding except by chance, and it just makes you tired.   In other words, wait until you have enough data before trying to calculate things."

SocialEngineering,37qjmm,ThelemaAndLouise,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:56:24 2015 UTC,"I mean that you should ignore mixed signals. If you invite her to things and she doesn't go, doesn't try to reschedule, and doesn't seem apologetic about it, that's a clear signal. The most important thing until you have actionable data is to maintain frame and follow your joy.   Additionally, you should be talking to other women and inviting them to things. There is zero chance that she is not being invited to things by other guys.  From a social engineering standpoint, you should endeavor to be the person to terminate communication and a hangout. You should try to have it be because you are going to do something with another friend, and you should sometimes let her feel excluded and sometimes invite her to tag along if you think it's appropriate.   Out of curiosity, how old are you both?"

SocialEngineering,37qjmm,Wystie,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:21:29 2015 UTC,"Being 17 changes the context a great deal. She might be afraid to hang out with you because people could taunt her for liking you. Her parents might restrict her activities a great deal.   Have you hung out with her as part of a mixed group outside of school? If not, that could be your next step. Maybe something like bowling, which is non threatening and unlike a movie will provide uninterrupted social interaction.   How long have you been hanging out? Schools out now, right?

Also i'm pretty good at not-being-nerdy-around-people-who-are-not-nerdy and got good contact to people who are not nerdy.  Nor because of her parents.

If the relationship is going rather well, she might worry about it, little  by little. Let her marinate a not-too-long, not-too-short moment, and when she finally ask you ""What's going on"", tell her that making trips to hers is costy and you can't afford to always be the one that pays for everything... and that if she wants to see you in the future, she'll have to contribute.   It might sound strange, but by experience, some girls will panic a bit if you become anormally distant. On top of that, since she's in that ""panic mode"", she will most likely accept your inquiries."
SocialEngineering,37m3t0,5steelBI,38,Thu May 28 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"they're all the same woman?   1: impromptu photo, the pose is confident, i.e she knew the pic was taken and had a second to pose. chin out, brows raised, obvious make-up. basically all the marks of an impromptu shot. no teeth bared suggests that it's an unusual shot, whether the person behind the camera is personal to the subject or impersonal is not able to be determined by the shot alone. may be a self photo or a 'selfie'.   2: basically, a photo identification picture used on id badges for use to access employee only area of operations or for other identification purposes. had time to pose and prepare for the picture wearing specific clothing.  3: a glamour photo, at some event. the clothing, hairstyle and pose were predetermined and all chosen for the specific shot.   to be honest, it's obvious these are the same woman in all shots. the necklace gives it away, even if the features could not be matched up because of different levels of make-up, lighting, etc. That the necklace appears in 2/3 shots implies sentimental value of the necklace.   edit: as far as presentation is concerned, all can be differentiated by the lighting. photo 1 is characterized as impromptu by way of the obvious flash from a cellphone or other low end cameras. The subject knew the photo was being shot, had a second to pose, but not prepare with clothing, hair, make-up, etc. The first photo stands out as the only shot with glasses on, which is typically a set-up photo no-no and indicates it's an impromptu shot.  Second photo is obviously taken for identification and the subject had time to prepare and pose. the photo is taken on a blank background, with mute clothing, the only shot that features obvious ear rings and includes the basic 'stock' smile and pose.  lighting also indicates it's a stock photo for id purposes.   Third photo is an obvious glamour shot, pose and posture tailored to the photo. this photo was probably part of a series for a specific event. clothing suggests a funeral, unless at a wedding (and I can only speculate on USA wedding/funeral traditions) and the subject was not part of the wedding party and simply attended (however, i have no idea if it is in bad taste to wear black to a wedding so i can't really comment, as I just wear a suit).   simply based on the necklace and the pose, these photos were all shot within a few years of eachother. just spitballing, but the third photo could be a senior photo, as those are popular now, but (forgive me for speculating) I don't think the subject is that young and I would predict the subject is at least 30 if not late 20s.   edit 2: in case this is actually a study on reactions, the first photo may not be of the same subject, and is playing on the human tendency to accept that one out of place shot is similar to the others by way of the subject having the same hair color and appearing the same age. the first photo lacks the necklace in the other two, and features the subject wearing glasses that we don't see in the other photos. while that may imply that the first photo is impromptu, it does not preclude that all the subjects are the same person."

SocialEngineering,37m3t0,Neebat,2,Thu May 28 20:24:12 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, and i think we're splitting hairs. The photos themselves say as much about the subject as anything in the photo, at least how I see it.   I described the photos because photos are typically contrived, i.e. they don't actually present anything about the subject other than what the photographer chooses. the photographer manipulates light, wardrobe, background, etc. i described the photos to give some insight into how and why the photos were taken, which can give actual insight into the subject than one off 'i think the subject is pretty' reactions. But, i bear you no ill will and appreciate your concern that i may have misunderstood the post.   edit: going back now, i will give my 'impressions' of the subject:  1: assuming the photo isn't cropped, the subject is alone, wearing obvious make-up on a dark background, so the subject may be at a night club, house-party or in a park. That the subject is alone when many of these sorts of impromptu photos are taken with 'friends', it could be assumed the subject is out on the town solo. based on the pose in the first photo, I believe the subject to be slightly inebriated, because I myself pose that way for photos when drunk. Impossible to say for sure because we can't see the pupil dilation from the flash on the glasses and the poor resolution. From the lack of other subjects, I think this is a self photo. These photos are typically taken to soothe feelings of anxiety from being alone in an almost clearly social setting (i draw this conclusion because we can't see the background which means the photo was not taken to show off where the subject is) or it could be for the subject to check her appearance! We'll never know.   2: The subject dressed up/down for the picture so it is important to the subject. the ear rings are significant because they show a little personal flair of the subject. I myself do not wear ear rings but from what I know, dangling jewelry is hit or miss in some groups. The subject wears green outer-wear to contrast her red hair, or the red background. We can't know for sure, but I suspect it is to contrast her hair. A very boring photo, she may be part of a group photo but someone cropped the group out.   3: The subject is posed a certain way, so we know this is definitely a photo for some event. She could be a model, or attending a wedding/funeral of a friend/relative, or both, but her facial expression betrays nothing. Her black dress has no sleeves, so we can conclude it is warm outside, so the subject may live in a temperate or tropical climate (this makes the color of the dress even more important). Her expression isn't very strained, so either this is the first or second photo of a series (in the case of a model) or she is simply part of a collection of subjects at a personal or commercial event. However, there is another way to look at it. Her 'smile' seems almost forced, as if she is smiling for the camera, rather than herself. Her eyebrows are not raised, so she is simply posing. The photo looks cropped, I suspect she isn't the sole subject of the photo. If she is not the only subject, there are many wild assumptions to be made. Is she part of a photo where her lover is marrying another woman/man? Is she part of a funeral party burying a family member that was close to her? The photo is not enough to tell anything really."

Subject looks older, and looks like an office worker. Picture looks like it was taken in haste, with good intentions behind it. Probably a congrats for winning a draw or something.

This will help teach your roommate that this is where they should go. After they do go, be sure to give them lots of praise and love to let them know they did a good thing. Refrain from using pee pads they can be confusing to your roommate. Pee pads may lead to them peeing on the carpet or blankets. You should always make time to take them to the bathroom because you want to teach them to only go with the door closed. Roommate crates are a positive thing for your roommate; it is like their room or den. It is their space! Refrain from using the crate as a way to punish your roommate. When they are in the crate be attentive to your roommate watch for warning signs that they need to go to the bathroom with the door closed. Accidents Happen! You should only scold or punish them if you catch them in the act. Punishing your roommate afterwards or rubbing their nose in their mess can be very confusing for your roommate.   Source"

SocialEngineering,37fad2,the_rabbit_of_power,4,Wed May 27 05:07:34 2015 UTC,"You say your father is a pathological liar...are you sure? I ask because the motivation is different than someone who lies out of fear. Pathological liars enjoy deception.   When you're dealing with a pathological liar, don't look for the usual signs of lying (shifting gaze, sweating, swallowing). Pathological liars will look you in the eye and deceive you, maybe even tear up on demand. Look for any slyness in facial expressions, a tiny smile, a little glint, walking away as though they've gotten away with something, any betrayal in body language. If you are having trouble reading expressions or micro expressions, try messing with his script. Interrupt his train of thought, then come back to things when he's not expecting it. Try to catch him off-guard. Use something from the past, engage psychological warfare, if it's that crucial. Each tactic is only good maybe once or twice, as he'll probably get wise.   The most important thing to do is not to let him make you panic. It's fine if you act panicked as a diversion, but actual panic will make you less receptive to the small details that will give him away. Stay calm, at least inside.   You can read up on the tells of liars all day, but paying a little attention and getting yourself in the room with him during these discussions will do more for you than all the books available. Use your gut. If you know him, you'll know when he's lying.  If he's really pathological, in my experience, he's lying when his lips are moving. I'm so sorry.  Any way you can draw up a contract? It could help cover your ass if you're concerned he'll come after you for interest."
SocialEngineering,37fad2,Lady_badcrumble,1 point,Thu May 28 00:17:05 2015 UTC,"Great advice, thank you  I'd say almost pathological, not a full blown I meant it more in the informal sense, my mistake. Though my mother who I haven't talked to in years is very literally. He has told the truth about somethings. I usually force him into some detail and mull things over. I go with my gut. I can usually find a counterfactual and then he comes clean about that part.  He lives in a different state, so unfortunately I only have voice and facts to figure out what is what.  That's not a concern. He doesn't lie for money he is just hyper avoidant of disagreement (even though I never get upset at bad news), so anything he thinks might be negative news he lies about. I wouldn't care except it's caused me to not do things, miss opportunities that I could've taken had I known my actual schedule. He's also a lawyer so I don't think I could use a contract as a trick."
SocialEngineering,37fad2,Lady_badcrumble,2,Thu May 28 00:33:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, if he's a lawyer, and a liar, you should definitely have a contract. There is no not having a contract, in this situation. If you don't believe he has your interests at heart, it would be silly not to have a written agreement. You could even use it as a point of pride for him.   if I were you, I would ask him to draw it up, then give it to a contract lawyer that's unrelated to him, and therefore not invested.   A lawyer who is hyper-avoidant of disagreement? Is he a trial lawyer?  If he's as cagey as you are, I wish you luck.  Edit: Actually, if I were you, I'd work until I earned the money for school. It's more satisfying and ultimately less stressful."

I did a group project like this in college. It was for ""user security"" in 2nd year a compsci course, most of it was myself covering how to read your address bar for clues. But we had a interest talk about passwords done by my partners.   They started by explaining the biggest risk to security is you. Going over password basics. Finally we were then going to figure out who was the biggest risk with a couple test. The tests were 2 fake ""personality surveys"" which a friend of mine put together.  The first survey was a classic Forer/Barnum personality test, this was done only for rapport building. After each student took the test they were taking to the side & talked to about their results. Each one privately giving the results was pretty happy with it, even tho they were all the same.  The second test, was much longer about 75 questions. This was the important personality test, and it looked no different from an internet/blog survey at the time. With ""Getting to know you!"" blazoned on top of the paper. Favorite color, favorite teams, pets, first car, etc...While these questions seemed harmless blended in were a few important ones(email, maiden name, what bank they used). However all 75 questions were common security questions.    After everything was collected a students paper was chosen at random. Then my partner would look over the test, and picked up the phone on the desk. The call was put on speaker phone, and within about 3 minute he had full access to this girls bank account. She wasn't to happy, but he was the kind of guy that could just smile and you'd forget being mad.   So point proven(we hoped),and we got high marks for it. Simply to prove that the weakest link in the chain is still the human one."

SocialEngineering,36icwb,Rain12913,1 point,Wed May 20 03:13:59 2015 UTC,Or they'd just treat it like a normal sales enquiry and set up a home visit. If the address was already listed as a customer they'd call the account holder and figure out what was going on.

Sorry, as i said my gf normally does this. Can you go by my name, phone number or address?""  Then i can start listing the details of the target...

SocialEngineering,36icwb,Zennxr,1 point,Wed May 20 11:11:28 2015 UTC,"Social Engineering is usually harder at companies like alarm places because most customer service representatives are trained not to give out this information. That being said someone practiced at it or with some inside information might be able to do it. Additionally, you would have to be dealing with a very smart criminal, and most criminals aren't that smart. All of these things together make the likelihood of this happening fairly low.   Most criminals do not break into a house with a security company placard out front, most don't take the time effort to call and confirm. As such there are people (typically upstanding citizens) that steal ADT or other alarm company placards out of people's yards, and put them in their own to scare off criminals even though they don't have an alarm."
SocialEngineering,36icwb,donasay,1 point,Wed May 20 14:16:28 2015 UTC,"Years ago my brother's house was broken into 3 times in 2 months so he had an alarm installed. He asked me to go check to see if it was installed while he was away and gave me the code. I went into the house and the code didn't work so I set off the alarm. I then called the 1-800 number and told them what happened. They started asking me questions and I hardly knew any (They had the wrong year of my brother's birth as he gives out the wrong one consistently to screw with marketers), I didn't know the civic address, I didn't know his phone number (new phone) I certainly didn't know any details about the alarm account other than that he just had it installed. So I actually had less information than someone who just looked at his mail would have.  So they gave me a code to punch in that would silence the alarm (not his code either) and told me to have a nice day. I then waited an hour for my sister to come by as we were having lunch so no cops were called.  So at least with this one alarm company I would say that the answer is yes."

I would throw out the trash and try stuff that would never fly. False tells, talking too much, calling people's hands to their face and seeing how they react, turning over folded cards for credibility."
SocialEngineering,36jv1l,PAdogooder,6,Wed May 20 03:49:12 2015 UTC,"Have you ever played before? Do you know if you have any tells? Have you played with these people before?  If you have played before and don't have any money on the line, go wild. Play the polar opposite from what you use to. If you are conservative, play every single hand; if you go for everything only go when you have something worthwhile, nothing less than a Face card/pair of 7.  Try to pay attention to what you are doing, and make fake tells. I personally do a look-at-cards-look-around routine when I get bad cards, but play anyway. That way I psyche them out when I have a  good hand. So pick your nails, lick your lips, blink twice, or frown. Establish that you have a VERY BAD THING.  And speaking of cards, pick a hand and play it no matter what. Literally any hand will do, because what you want to do is to bluff with those cards. I always play If the flop gives me a chance of making a stair, because it is a) a decently good hand if I can pull it off and b)People know what I am going for, so if they see that there is a 6-7-8 on the table and I am going in, they nope out of there.  Try to string people along. If you have a trio of queens and the cards on the table are trash, don't make them run, simply call their hand, or raise it a little. Basically you want a game of chicken, after which you go ""Ta da!"". This is easier to pull if you are at the last position of the table (everyone else went before you)  Play the pot. If a person raises and you are going to play it, raise it at least for 1/3 of the value. Ex: If there are 10$ in the pot already and everyone is calling 3$, call the 3$ and add 3$ more. It will weed out the weak and give the illusion that you have a good hand. Don't do this every time tho, only when you have a reasonable chance pf winning OR when you want to thin out the participants. This one goes especially well with the one tactic above.  Call on the flop and the turn, and raise on the river. Is a good strategy to have when you have a decent hand. On the other hand, remember that you can always abandon in the river, so if you see/think you are going to get wrecked, get cut your loses, that 1 chip might be the difference between going home and making a comeback.  and most important of all: WATCH THE PEOPLE! Watch what they do, what they don't do, what they play. I have seen newbies keep their eyes in their cards all the game and go home in 4 hands. Is there a person who always plays a 7? Someone who keeps calling until a K came up, when they raised? Was someone going all the way until the River but threw the cards away at the end?  And remember the golden rule: To play, all you need is a chip and a chair.   Good luck!"

You mention a couple in your text.  Tactics like humoring people's opinions subtly, expressing apparently reasonable (but undue or unrelated) skepticism... any tactic that will place the person off-balance.  The essence is to do this in such a way that any given action, and indeed the whole chain of actions if you are good, can always be clearly identified as coming from a positive, helpful, encouraging mindset.  How do you keep people from doing this to you?  The easiest tactic is to intelligently pick and choose your reactions to environmental stimuli.

The more information you know about your mark (including what they know about you) the better you will be at predicting their responses to the stimuli.  You can mentally flowchart their response to a specific action and if it is not something you can deny you pick a new action.  Some people might ask why you did what you did and give you an opportunity to explain and others won't care why and they'll just tell you to fix the problem.  I don't know if this helps at all.

Fulling knowing that I could beat them both in a race, sober or intoxicated (we were all intoxicated), I challenged my friend's friend (who we will call Stacy). At this point, I already made the assessment that she was a jerk (""Hey I'm a germaphobe; can you roll me my own joint from your weed for free?"" then she proceeded to make out with her bf, hit our joint, and share cups with multiple people at the party....germaphobe....right...) so I had no qualms about what followed.  I first stood on the side and watched my friend and Stacy race but Stacy was very eager to start the race. So I elected to do the countdown, paused JUST ENOUGH before I said go so that Stacy would jump the gun. Then I accused her of cheating. ""How dare you call me a cheater? You aren't counting right! blah blah blah."" Nobody else could tell that I was counting off so I was lucky there. She already assumed I would continue counting wrong so I started counting right. She kept jumping the gun and we kept harping on her for it.   Finally, it's my turn to race. Mind you, we're on a narrow lane way on a blocked off roof top so there wasn't enough space for a two person race. But she wanted it so I raced her. Accidentally cut in front during a turn. She flips out and makes a big deal out of it. I pretend like I had no idea what she was talking about. This goes on for a little while longer (cut-offs, early starts, etc.) Until she finally runs a good race and I beat her. She's pissed but she wants to be a good sport. So what do I do? Holler as loud as I can that I beat her, then nonchalantly shake her hand and say good race. Leave her alone for half an hour.  When I see her again, we're somehow in a gym and my friend and Stacy are trying to see who can squat more. Stacy sees me come in and tries to be all, ""I'm a boss ass bitch so don't fuck with me."" I stay quiet. Stacy's turn to do squats. She puts herself in position and I chuckle. She glares. I smile. She does her first squat, then says, ""I wish I had my gym clothes here."" I laughed. She explodes. I just shrug. She storms out in a huff.  Final interaction is when she's leaving. She's saying bye to everyone and everyone gets a hug. She glares at me almost the entire time. I go to give her a fist pump and she tries to punch me in the face. I dodge and she almost falls down. I chuckled. She turns red and just tries to play it off but, at this point, she's too far in a hole. She just looks like she's been getting worked up all night over nothing.   Long story short, let them do most of the work. Once you have that base, they usually dig themselves their own grave."

I imagine something similar happened with the special forces branch after the release of that movie and act of valor..."
SocialEngineering,367zkx,Quest4life,45,Sun May 17 02:59:17 2015 UTC,"I seem to remember reading..   Hollywood and the Pentagon have an interesting deal: the Pentagon will supply military hardware of nearly any sort (think air craft carrier even) to be used in a film under one condition: they get the final word on the script.  Sources:  - Al Jazeera America   The U.S. military offices usually ask to see the entire script, not just the parts that relate to military involvement and, based on the entire script and the portrayal of the troops, will move it forward in the approval process. If based on a historical event, it also needs to pass muster with the Pentagon’s historians.   - USA Today   If Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle comes across as particularly heroic in the new war epic Pearl Harbor, the credit goes as much to the behind-the-scenes influence of the Pentagon as to the vision of Hollywood filmmakers. Likewise, if the Marines get a special mention during a rescue sequence in the coming movie The Sum of all Fears, it was their idea. In exchange for providing Hollywood with military advice, personnel and awesome equipment for movies and TV shows, the Pentagon gets an advance look at scripts and has a chance to negotiate changes.   ..   ""We do it because we see it as an opportunity to inform the American public about the military and help our recruiting and retention programs at the same time,"" says Philip Strub, head of the Pentagon's film liaison office in Washington.   ..   For example, Green says he persuaded filmmakers to give Lt. Col. Doolittle, played by Alec Baldwin, a more prominent and sympathetic role than in the original script, which depicted the leader of the first bombing raid on Tokyo as ""a boorish, oafish type of fellow.""  ""Doolittle was rewritten and made a little bit more of the real hero he was,"" says Green.   - Salon   The Journal, for instance, quotes director Peter Berg saying that his upcoming cinematic tribute to the SEALs was approved by Pentagon-compliant studio execs specifically because the project avoids any nuanced take on the politics of war. “The idea of a good old-fashioned combat yarn, in which the politics are very clear – we support these men – was more appealing to them,” he said, noting that his film will be “an unabashed tribute to the courage of (the SEALs).”   - Movie Line   U.S. Navy documents, acquired through a Freedom of Information Act request via Muckrock (where you can view them in their entirety), show that the Department of Defense’s decision to work with Berg and Universal hinged on one main question: “Do we believe that [the movie] could have a positive impact on recruiting?” The Navy concluded yes, confidently declaring, “Battleship will certainly continue to be a conversation starter that carries our ‘brand’ to many Americans who aren’t familiar with their Navy.”   ...   Specifically, that meant the Department of Defense had veto power over every word of the script, with any military-related changes having to go through another approval process. The DoD also mandated contractually obligated screenings of the rough cut, when changes to the film could still be made, as well as a screening of the final cut in Washington, D.C., before the film’s theatrical release.   Yeah, no question, most military films are shot as propaganda first, entertainment second.   The one saving grace is this (from USA Today):   It all happens at no cost to taxpayers, since moviemakers reimburse the military for any out-of-the-ordinary expenses.   Would you like more information? Courtesy of an FOIA request, here's the most comprehensive list to date of movies the DOD has had a hand in. PDF here. Surprising or not, the KKK classic Birth of a Nation is included."
SocialEngineering,367zkx,itty53,12,Sun May 17 05:25:23 2015 UTC,"The most blatant recruitment propaganda movie I've ever seen was Transformers. The first action scene, when the scorpion attacks the army base in the desert, the level of realism and detail on how they coordinate and execute the counter attack seemed quite high (allthough all the boring stuff was left out, of course). The audience gets a close up of soldiers on the gruond, calling in CAS, that happens of course (CGI? Real? Who knows?), some guy gives air support from a minigun attached to a C130, and to top it all of you even get an exiting shot from the control room, where an anxioous, bubblegum chewing CO is walking around tensely consentrated with his arms crossed, looking over the shoulders of his minions (everyone's important here!) sitting at various screens and working strategy and communications or whatever. In between the action we get to listen in to what seems like perfectly realistic radio chatter, just to drive home the feel of sitting somewhere inside a vast and well oiled, immensely powerful complex of weapon systems and badassery. Fuck yeah!   They lost though. But hey. It was against a super robot from outer space, so what are you gonna do."

But then again I actually am the IT department to some of these companies and can get the client's override if the ISP wants to make things difficult. I usually can get around this though.

The birth of another child in the family? A funeral? Find their motivation. Then, let what motivates you, come from a place of magnanimous acquiescence. Be kind. If your kindness cannot be met with like kindness, at least you've done your best within yourself. You can feel good about that.  If they're power-mad you cannot win by engaging them. Give as much as you feel is appropriate and maybe a little more, in the spirit of good-will. If you need to draw a line, be prepared to have a good reason. And stick to it.  Remember, this is not a competition between families. This is about your sister and the love of her life.   If they refuse to let your elderly grandmother have a close parking spot, and make her walk two miles to the rehearsal dinner, you have my permission to key their car. They're clearly inconsiderate bastards and can only be met with passive aggression."

However, my sister and her husband are 100% ready to rock 'n' roll. I think if maybe my brother-in-law has a word with his parents and lets them know that they should take this much more seriously then they'll stop being so laid-back about everything and putting it all off.

Okay this is absolute nonsense, firstly the forum software which you HAVE to buy because any free options are absolutely awful and would not be suitable for any kind of community/forum with more than 3 active users, vBulletin and XenForo are used by ALL the biggest/best communities/forums.   Cost of XenForo licence: $140 a year. https://xenforo.com/purchase/  Cost of vBulletin licence: $209 - $359 a year. https://www.vbulletin.com/en/purchases/  Then you have the web hosting space to pay for because if you're planning to run a large scale community thats always online, accessible and protected against the real ""skids"" who love to DDoS you can't be using XAMPP and your home network.   I'm not even going to go into server costs for the right VPS with the right specs then the added DDOS protection which isn't cheap either.  Then you have cPanel and WHM to pay for because it is completely unnecessary to completely manage a large scale site purely through command line via SSH when you can have a user-friendly web script that enables you to do things easily and quicker ever than you could via SSH.   Now if you want the added protection and security and if anything a good piece of mind of course your forum/website needs SSL encryption, something else that costs yearly.   Clearly this silly opinion is coming from someone with absolutely no experience in running or maintaining an active WEBSITE and thinks managing a SUB REDDIT is like running and managing a forum, it isn't.

Here, you are talking about public forums anyone can register to and start posting on that allow and advertise such content, yeah places more HQ like Astro and especially our forum ForbiddenSE do have a huge community around warranty exploitation but you're simply tunnel visioned and narrow minded if you believe such closed communities with strict application and interview processes don't have members and discussions who do much more.  Oh and there is no ""VIP"" or ""VIP M3th0dZ"" on ForbiddenSE as you bring up in every single post/comment you make about social engineering forums, to see better content you simply contribute, the more you contribute you get automatically upgraded into different groups, if you stop contributing eventually you get automatically downgraded, you're trying to form an opinion on a website you can't even access.

Show them that the slut is actually a fun and interesting girl who they would like to hang out with, either in a sexual or platonic setting. Later, if it's the right choice for the couple, they can make the decision to get married. So basically, instead of devaluing virginity, you devalue marriage.

As a note, it is 'how would we address that', the wording that makes you a part of this very agreeable group. 'How would you address that' would be taken as distancing yourself from the colleague, and possibly by extension with the group. 'How would we...' places you as a helpful ally.

Example: The Titanic  Realizing the iceberg was close, the Helmsman turned the wheel counterclockwise as fast as he could, in the opposite direction he wanted to go.  Only he forgot that this was a new model where the wheel must be turned clockwise (in the same direction he wanted to go) to avoid it.

SocialEngineering,35ivas,danger_robot,9,Mon May 11 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"everytime I read a thread, my mind/perspective expands.   Sweet! I don't get to post here often(I stay busy) but I'm glad to hear this community has become a beacon of light for you. It hasn't always been that way >.>  First, let me stress how important staying relaxed is. For the SE at heart(which this is a case where SE is a no-no overall) staying calm in the moment is crucial to success. You literally can't half ass it. If you try and dial it in for even a sec and you're not ready to pull the trigger it can go up in smoke in the blink of an eye. In this case(topical discussion) you really need resolve, fortitude and a can do attitude to apply your ""hacks"" to work for you.   So the more at ease you are the better your session should go overall and that's honestly what you need to be focused on for the time being(there's time to freak out after its ova :P). In general I'm a nervous guy, but when the stage lights come on and it's show time, you have to suck it up and stay busy being awesome or else... What... do you think this is a game!? ;P You were picked for this because you're qualified, willing and obviously the top choice. I mean seriously? Go get em'! :D   Whether or not this talk is discussed after the interview is going to directly correspond to how it is received overall and(i.e. the student body and/or anyone reporting directly for the school) particularly by your guest(s). Frankly this is mainly going to depend on the scope AND the core of your audience. The scope will be the general audience probably the student body. The core will be anyone else from the school that's attending, teachers and anyone else watching but not in direct attendance like the principal or friends of your guest speaker. You want to be able to engage ALL repeat ALL parties at once while making sure you're attending to your guest onstage 100%. Remember to put yourself in your guests shoes because you want to be accommodating if at all possible. If you can do this successfully it's a ticket to impressing your guest of honor!   The last piece is the formality, or how serious this particular engagement will be. Is it being broadcast? Is it just to your school? Will it be available to watch online afterwards? On what grounds is this speaker negotiating? Is he here to open your minds to new ideas? Is he here strictly to be interviewed about business or business practices? How big of a celebrity are we talking? Is this a political discussion? Are you being broadcast on live TV? Once you've answered all these you can get a feel for how much room you have to breath and what kind of style you need to bring. So like, If it's just to your high school or something then no need to panic... but if it's being broadcast to live TV you need a plan and you need to execute on said plan to the fullest extent possible.    Either way as long as you and your production crew are well prepared and giving it 100% I'm sure you can deliver a stand out performance. Lastly just be yourself(more Anchorman and less CNN). It's really easy to get caught up in the moment or stumble(it happens to the best of us) but as long as you bring your A game there's no reason why I couldn't see you making an impression on your celebrity guest. How much of an impression(good OR bad) depends on you ;)"

SocialEngineering,35ivas,curtains,2,Mon May 11 20:25:27 2015 UTC,":> you're very welcome   So is there any techniques to calm down etc?   Yea :)   I trained martial arts as a younger man and one thing that will really help is meditation. Find a place where you can sit/lay down without interruptions and close your eyes. Try and focus on relaxing your body and regulating your breathing. Try and let go of your daily thoughts and try your best to find your center. The main focus of this is to clear your mind of all thought and finding tranquility. This is what monks do to help reduce stress and promote healthy living.    Please keep in mind that EVERYONE gets nervous before an event like this. I saw a singer I really like say that if you don't get nervous before you go onstage, you're doing it wrong. Try and stay calm and focused on your goal(the interview). You want to be as relaxed as you can for the interview so that your guest speaker feels at ease(because they probably get nervous as well ;P) Just try not to let your nerves get the best of you in the moment :)  Good luck with your event!"
SocialEngineering,35ivas,curtains,6,Tue May 12 01:52:03 2015 UTC,"Tell a personal story. What event in your life led you to seek entrepreneurship. Keep the story as short as possible. The last sentence should be a generalization of the story's point (experience thrill/lesson learned/loss/compassion/empathy/inspiration/etc), broadly worded so that it's more universally relatable. Also, it'll make future opinions/talking points easier to relate to your personal story. Do not bring up the story again during the q&a, it'll look bad. If you tell the story well enough, people will draw their own conclusions. This advice will only work if you're honest. Judging from the first paragraph of your question, you aren't great at bullshitting. So don't try this if your personal story isn't both true and meaningful. The upside of being honest is that it's okay to be nervous. Shrug off a gaff or stumble in words, with a quick smile and laugh. (The Chris Farley Show is a good example of how being yourself/relatable can overcome flaws.) Being personable, being yourself is a good thing. The more personable you are, the more there is to remember you by. But don't ramble/interrupt/one-up people. Enjoy yourself and keep the story short.  edit- Don't worry about coming off as perfectly professional. There isn't anything you can say that won't make the businessman see you as more than a kid. The personal story will show self-reflection/character/drive and most importantly, potential."

But one thing you can do though, is to change your texting style a little when you begin texting her and when you're about to ask her the thing thing. So it'll be more convincing if you would to tell her a friend was playing a prank.

She loves to go on long tangents about what's wrong with her and how it drives her insane and I know it's complete bullshit, so whenever the conversation goes that way, I stop her and repeat her points back to her and tell her I understand then immediately change the subject.  I'm definitely not an expert though."
SocialEngineering,35fjyv,Puggy_Ballerina,2,Sun May 10 06:40:49 2015 UTC,"Look at the root cause of the ""ramble"". People like talking about themselves, especially if it's something they really care about and don't get the chance to often. People often forget themselves in such a situation and they just need a bit of a nudge to remember that not everyone is as interested in their thing as they are. In these cases a simple interruption of any kind will jolt people back to the now. Just don't ask questions about their topic. Ask short answer questions like ""Hey, how are we on juice"" followed by checking the fridge and then saying ""Sorry, ADD, you were saying?"" can work. It'll break their momentum but give them a chance to finish. I come off as obviously ADD so I have an easier time pulling off quick asides. However, some people need a bit more of a rib because they're either more narcissistic, oblivious, or actively trying to convert you to their cause. But, they'll take any rebuff more in stride.   One tactic, that takes a bit of practice, is to begin the conversation with artificial time constraints. Not that effective for someone like your roommate, but all interactions with them is a whole other bag entirely. Elsewhere, artificial time constraints also make you seem less threatening and easier to talk to; which is arguably a better use than an easy out (is that a good use of a semicolon?). Either way, simply starting the conversation with, ""hey I gotta go do this thing here in a second but first"" is worlds better than saying it later and gives the conversation a foreseeable end."
SocialEngineering,35fjyv,under_psychoanalyzer,3,Sun May 10 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"When someone is talking at length, expressing an opinion you don't share, one way to take back some control of the conversation and remain polite is to ask questions. This can also give both parties in the conversation a chance to explore a new viewpoint more thoroughly. Even if her explanation doesn't change your view, you will probably have a chance to steer the conversation a bit.  If you're really having trouble staying interested, you might have to gently cut them off, something like, ""--hey sorry to interrupt but I didn't want to waste your time, I'm not really THAT interested, I was mostly curious. Thanks for explaining all that.""  I find that asking questions about others' beliefs, especially if they are different from mine, can be very rewarding."

The rest of it completely misses the question asked. Keeping yourself open to other viewpoints is a great LPT but the question is about how to get away from a conversation. Because honestly, there are many things in this world (homeopathy being one of them) you really don't need to hear anymore about.   Asking questions is the absolute worst thing you could do if you don't really care. Most people on diatribes are feeding some sort of inner need for attention/venting and they don't really care if you share their view or not. If that's the case not only is asking a question is the best way to be stuck in a conversation till the death heat of the universe but saying ""I'm not really THAT interested"" will absolutely crush their self esteem and end any willingness to listen to anything you ever want to say again."

It was named by psychologist Edward Thorndike in reference to a person being perceived as having a halo. Subsequent researchers have studied it in relation to attractiveness and its bearing on the judicial and educational systems. The halo effect is a specific type of confirmation bias, wherein positive feelings in one area cause ambiguous or neutral traits to be viewed positively. Edward Thorndike originally coined the term referring only to people; however, its use has been greatly expanded especially in the area of brand marketing.

SocialEngineering,352a0d,dontdrinktheT,3,Wed May 6 14:37:42 2015 UTC,"You should probably look into general sales strategy. The art of sales is getting people to need something they didn’t even know they wanted.   Manipulating someone into having life goals certainly isn’t impossible and there’s a lot of strategies, but it’s a very long term con and it’s going to depend upon their personality and your own charisma. If you’re dealing with a relatively submissive person who is approval seeking, you make them dependent upon you and then you can just scold or praise them selectively depending upon how they react to your suggestions. If you’re dealing with a dominate person, you need to convince them (rationally or emotionally) that it’s their idea to do this goal and you’ll be a more loyal follower to them if they do it.  As for your fat friend, if he’s dominate you’re going to need to discover your friend’s motivations and desires in the world, then make him understand that weight loss is the only way to achieve those things, but you need to do it delicately enough that it becomes his own idea. For example, maybe he wants to live longer, maybe he wants to get laid more, maybe he’s afraid of dying young – although, maybe he doesn’t give a shit about any of these things and that’s why he’s fat. This can be especially difficult to do with overweight people because the conditions that result in being overweight are often through impulsive addictions – these addictions transcend all rational appeals. In other words, it’s very irrational and emotionally troubling to be a fat person, so appealing through rational and emotional channels is difficult.   Another approach is to rush your friend into hitting rock bottom. If your friend is really keen on getting laid, then you need to bring a hot girl around who can either shame him for being fat (“You’re such a nice guy, and kinda cute in the face, you’d be a real catch if you weren’t such a fat fuck. You look disgusting and smell bad, can you even see your own dick?”) or otherwise sweet talk him into losing weight (“If you drop 40 pounds I’d go on a date with you.”). As with all addictions, a person needs to hit a low point in their life in order to be self-motivated into change.   If your friend is submissive then you have an easier route depending upon your personality and ability to exert dominance. You need to start eating healthier and exercising more and demand your friend does the same. You need to yell at him if he’s unwilling to participate and praise him when he does. Your friend will probably try to avoid you, but you need to impose yourself in their life and totally dominate them. You’ll have to be a bit fragile about emotionally damaging them though, because if their weight loss is associated with emotional abuse, they’ll fall back on their old ways at every opportunity for emotional comfort."

I do it as a 'golden rule' thing: if I'm interacting with someone who I may see on even an occasional basis, I always appreciate when they remember who I am. At the very least, recognizing someone and calling them by name makes most people happy. And occasionally, you'll notice unintended benefits, like a coffee lady upsizing your coffee for free, or a free slice from the pizza guy, for example. Note that I'm not saying to do it only to benefit in a tangible way, or game the system. Sometimes good things just happen from it. Disassociate yourself from downers and haters, and cultivate friendships with those who matter. This was a very unconscious effort on my part, but I've become much more aware of it over the past few years. I'm very fortunate to have fantastic friends, all from very different backgrounds, but their commonality is that they're all people I'd be happy to have crash at my place for a week, a month, etc. I'm an empathetic person, so others' moods affect me easily, and I think I found (again, unaware of this until reflecting on it) that over the years, the people who didn't make me feel good in interactions were people I did not maintain friendships with."

SocialEngineering,34txw2,Master2u,4,Mon May 4 22:35:44 2015 UTC,If you just have standard residential or cell service you probably can't do it.  But you could play those tones at the start of your voicemail greeting and then don't answer calls from numbers you don't recognize for a while.

Each phone has a unique serial number (imei) (ESN) that is traceable as far as whose account is it on, if its active , etc etc. When we switch phones and reactivate them this requires newly purchased phones to have their serial numbers swapped or changed on a customers account first before they can even turn connect to the network . on top of that the serial numbers are used in return and exchanges to VERIFY the right phones are being swapped. Besides this is such a common thing people try its just petty and most people will just tell you to leave . you never know you might get lucky though"

I just don't need this added stress since my job is already stressful and I'm learning a huge number of new things on top of it all. I want him to go away and be like any other coworker.

Do Not try to be first to your boss with info on him and don't engage your boss about him again unless something serious happens otherwise you run the very real risk or becoming another ""dobby"" in the eyes of your boss, absolutely keep a log because solid written information will always trump b.s. from a know bullshitter but, only deploy the information as a killing blow.

I haven't mentioned dobby since,  and won't unless I have to. Ugh I can't stand working with this guy,  he makes every day drag on which is really crap because I loved my job before this happened. I looked forward to going to work!

Never mind,  at least the pays decent!"
SocialEngineering,34sqqz,lps2,22,Wed May 20 09:42:22 2015 UTC,"This has a simple solution. Just remember to communicate with your boss. That's it. Once or twice a week, at the end of your day, 7:05 for example, or whenever, as you wrap up shoot off a quick message to your boss:  ""Hey [Boss], just wrapping up for the day and wanted to make sure I updated you on the status of [Blah] before I forget the details....""  ""Hey [Boss], since I know you get started earlier than me (thanks timezones!), and I know you've been keeping tabs on [Thing/project] did you have any feedback about [blah]? I'll take a look first thing in the morning.""  That sort of thing. Since you work in what looks like self assigned hours, or at least shifted hours from what some of your team does, you have to make it a policy to simply stay in better communication than the other guy, without becoming a pest. Limit it to business communication.  Apologies if this isn't exactly 'social engineering' but as someone who works with remote employees and is sometimes remote as well, good communication skills are simple to develop if you have the self discipline to enforce them, yet 100% effective at getting out in front of issues before they start.  If you have a call with your boss, or he's on it, just shoot him a quick summary after the call:  ""Hey [Boss], just summarizing the call as I heard it, anything I missed?  -summary points""  Over time (more rapidly than you might think), it'll rapidly become you being an excellent remote work facilitator, and him being a bothersome tattle tale/nag.

SocialEngineering,34sqqz,decemberwolf,20,Mon May 4 17:04:04 2015 UTC,"gaslight him.  Move his stuff, then move it back when he isn't looking. swap his mouse for a slightly different, tattier one, then swap it back when he has complained to the boss.  The goal is to make him look like he doesn't have a good grasp on reality and he is just petty. Gaslighting works fantastically for dealing with tattle tales because they just inundate the authority figure with inane, pointless bullshit and get their reputation ruined.  Once you have him solidly looking the fool to management, make a passing comment to him about it having been you all along messing with him. Then when he inevitably tattles about that too, you feign complete ignorance and suggest that this man may have some sort of issue with you personally and start talking about a 'hostile working environment' and 'professional harrassment'. These trigger words have a subtext to them which will make the boss take your side just for his own peace and quiet (no need to involve HR!) and will also leave you feeling victorious."

SocialEngineering,34sqqz,PM_ME_YOUR_NITS,12,Mon May 4 12:21:18 2015 UTC,"I actually suggest you not ""mess with"" him. There's a line between giving him enough rope to figuratively hang himself, and actually giving him real things to complain about. If you keep yourself actually blameless in the situation, by doing nothing wrong, your life will be much simpler. If your boss ever discovers that you have given this co-worker an actual grievance, your credibility will be shot.  TLDR: be aware of the high price of deception, in terms of effort and risk."
SocialEngineering,34sqqz,benbuzz790,13,Mon May 4 14:19:24 2015 UTC,"^ This. Gaslighting exposes you and distracts from your work, though the payoff is slightly higher. You'd be better off under most circumstances documenting everything and keeping lines of communication open to your boss.   Also, the lowest risk approach to discredit someone is to defend their motives but acknowledge that their actual moves are ill advised. ""I'm sure he only wants (naive but positive goal) and doesn't realize that (obvious unintended consequences that you'd have to be incompetent not to think of)."" Then you look like you're a team player and they look bad. It's possible this was the move he was using on you--it's the deft choice to minimize risk--but if he were any good you'd be getting pressure from your boss and he'd be a sympathetic colleague as far as you were concerned."

SocialEngineering,34sqqz,Aiadon,2,Mon May 4 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yup,  that was my major concern which is why I wanted to know if there was a safe way to get him to show his true colours. However,  I suspect he's already started losing credibility because I had proof I had actually spoken to him about being there a bit later a number of times (things he failed to mention to our boss) and I did stuff like made a local phone call before I left (we are allowed) from my work phone to prove I was there. It's been good ever since but I'm so worried about going back,  I don't have the energy to play all these rubbish games,  I just want to do my job. It's infuriating!"
SocialEngineering,34sqqz,Shaojack,4,Mon May 4 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"The trick is to act with purpose and like you are supposed to be doing whatever you were doing. People will remember the time that ""fairies wear boots was hanging around dickhead's desk looking shifty"" but nobody will bat an eyelid if you look like you are just over there dropping off some papers. If you need to mess with the back of the computer and it is on the floor, drop your phone or a coin down there so if anyone asks what you are up to you can say ""I dropped my phone and now it's gone under the fucking desk, for christ sake!"" and act frustrated, which will cover things up nicely.  Above all, just pace yourself. You have to do it two or three times to get him to tattle, but once you know he has tattled about a specific thing, change the annoyance. If you use windows 7 machines I can also show you how to set his PC up so pressing shift 8 times will shut it down even when he has locked it, which is fantastic for winding people up and causing them lost work. lost work also has the added benefit of making it look like he is blaming you for his own fuckups."

SocialEngineering,34sqqz,Kazuke86,2,Mon May 4 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"Did you try talking to him?  Not your boss, I mean have you tried talking to the annoying guy?  There are all kinds of tricks you can do, but they make you as petty and underhanded as he is.  First I would talk to him, and try to get him to tell you why he has a problem with you.  Don't force him to say anything or corner him, just stay calm and professional and express your concerns.  Let him know that what he's doing bothers you.  He may not understand what he's doing is socially unacceptable, or that he has to tell the boss every time someone breaks a rule.  Figure out what he's thinking and why he's acting the way he does.  In the best case, the talk works outright, but he might flat out deny everything, or just not understand how it's bothersome.  That's fine.  Just act like you believe what he says.  Pretend the conflict is resolved and all is forgiven.  From then on, be nice to him in a genuine and not sarcastic way.  I bet he'll appreciate having a ally, since it sounds like this guy doesn't have many.  He'll be surprised at first; just stick with it.  It may be a little annoying to be this guy's friend, but it's better than open hostility.  If he still reports everything, then confront him again.  If you've been nice to him, he may be more willing to listen and talk than he was before.  You need to convince him that breaking little rules is no problem -- that the boss doesn't mind, that everyone breaks some rules, etc.  Keep in mind that it probably bothers him that you're doing these little things but that he's ""playing fair"" so to speak.  It'll be a tough conversation, and maybe you'll even need the boss to confirm some of the things you're saying.  If that doesn't work, only then would I resort to the tricks others described here.  Understanding is almost always the best way to approach hostility.  Finally, if all else fails, just tell your boss what you said in a post here: ""you used to look forward to working, and this guy is ruining it for everyone.""  Tell your boss how it feels to work with him and make your boss understand how big of a problem it is.  Maybe he'll be asked to leave."

SocialEngineering,34s216,hockeychick44,6,Mon May 4 01:57:25 2015 UTC,"actually, with only two weeks to prepare you will have to focus on the basics. Doing a good presentation in the sense that it gets your goal means conveying 'You Know Your Shit (tm)'. It does not need to be perfect and dressing confidently is important if it makes you confident. The essence of a presentation is to sell you as well as the topic and people respond primarily to the sub-communication.  So here is my recipe for a acceptable presentation. I got this from a professor of mathematics and pedagogics. (He started out as an applied math professor but got so interested in education that he now has two professorships.)  There are primarily two traps that needs to be avoided when doing presentations. Distract the viewer's attention or loose their attention. Examples are:   a) To much information on each slide (forces the viewer to choose between reading or listening).  b) Reading verbatim from a slide (people can read twice as fast as you can talk, halfway through the slide they will loose attention). c) Trying to cram to much information into a presentation (information overload => either forebrain shuts down (lose attention) OR forebrain gets over-engaged (analytical mode gets engaged in mental nitpicking).  So, how to avoid this:   Create a skeleton for the story you are telling, and make no mistake, it is a story your telling, not a reiteration of key bullet points.  As part of this skeleton ask yourself What is your goal? The main message? What are the elements that support your main message and can you present any self evident truths to support your elements? No more than two self evident facts for each element, let the element be the ""3rd"" self evident fact. Having done this create keywords for yourself, keywords that you'll use to remind yourself what comes next. DO NOT try to memorize whole sentences or paragraphs unless your a professional actor or presenter. Stick to keywords for memorization.  Only then you start creating slides, usually no more 1 slide per 2 minutes of presentation (so 20 minutes ~10 slides). If you have 30 minutes in total, leave 10 minutes for Q&A. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse! Keep your back to the screen and do the presentation in front of an imaginary audience at least 10 times. The first 5 times you will be tempted to watch the slides but force yourself to keep eye contact with the imaginary audience. Ask a friend or trusted colleague to be the audience. You don't need any feedback from them, just someone to rehearse occasionally locking eye contact with. This is the single strongest ""cue"" that people look for when they perceive someone as confident, the willingness to talk about ""Your Thing"" while watching someone in the eye. If you can get a larger audience for the last 2-3 rehearsals then invite people over and practice switching eye contact between people in the audience.   Now, it is important to remember that after having done enough rehersals your goals is NOT to give the exact same presentation, the goal is to feel confident in being able to present what you want to convey. Having a strong story (skeleton), good support (elements) and showing confidence will raise the quality of your presentation far above the average, and being above average is sexy!  PS. I hope some others can provide references and material to read, but I stress that you don't have a lot of time. Less reading up and more rehearsing is my recommendation."

SocialEngineering,34s216,robstillman1202,1 point,Mon May 4 12:04:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/ixian_probe that with two weeks you should focus on the basics. I do have some book recommendations if you had more time, but since you don't here are some things you should think about:  Planning   Who is your audience? Depending on who you're talking to, you may want to focus on different things, and emphasize the points that resonate with them most. You may also want to change your language depending on who you're talking to (e.g. Talking technology with IT people vs non-computer people). You may also want to make some changes whether you're talking in an auditorium vs a small conference room. What's the one sentence that you want people to take away from your presentation? People will not remember the entirety of your presentation, especially the further way they get from it. Figure out the one thing you want people to take away, and set up your presentation to focus on that. This is especially important when figuring out the talk - what is your purpose? to persuade, to inform, what? If someone who wasn't there asks an audience member ""What was the talk about?"", they should basically say this one sentence. What's your story? People love stories and they are easier to remember. This could be a literal story, or a logical progression of thought through the presentation. You don't want people wondering ""How did we get here?"" or ""I don't know why he's talking about this"" Why do I care? Remember that your audience is taking time out of their day to come listen to the talk. Make sure you relate it to them and their needs, or at least something they care about/why it's important.   Okay great, once you've got all of this figured out, write down your main story progression and any detail you want to add. Ask yourself the above questions to figure out if it's appropriate.  Slides  You may or may not have slides. If not, skip further down.   Jack of all trades, master of none  Your slides are not your notes. They are not handouts. They are slides to be presented. People often try to use their slides as handouts, etc. Don't do it. Trying to do two things at once makes it harder to do well at one or the other. Make separate handouts if you want handouts, and use the notes field in the software if you want that or a separate sheet of paper. One thought per slide People often try to cram to much into one slide. Have people take away one thought per slide. If you have a title, it should be the takeway point, not a useless header. (e.g. ""Growth"" vs ""Sales have increased 20% since 2010."" On that note, on every slide ask yourself ""what's the one thing I want people to take away from this slide?"" If there's stuff besides that, take it out. Minimize extraneous elements If it doesn't help get your point across, don't do it. Don't do stupid animations, or stupid transitions. If you really want a transition, do a fade, not a star wipe, or having every letter fly in. On that note, don't do sounds unless it helps make your point (e.g. don't do typewriter noises) It's okay to have whitespace! Also, make your text bigger so people in the back of the room can read it. Focus on the story Remember that story and points from above? Make sure you get your point across, focusing on the story, why the audience should care, and what they should take away.   Practice   Practice, Practice, Practice This is its own point. Once you've gotten a draft of your slides and know your story, practice your presentation. I mean, really practice, as close to the real thing as possible. Don't just sit there and think ""i'm going to say this on this slide"" [next] ""i'm going to say this on this slide"". Do it out loud, standing - however you're going to do it. Make sure you stand up, look ahead at where people would be sitting, and not down, etc. Make changes to slides and notes as necessary The process it not a one way process. Make changes as needed to make your talk smoother, flow better etc. It's an iterative process. Rehearse until you've got it down! I'm putting this down again, I can't emphasize how many complete talks you have to go through before you're ready. You should be able to go through an entire talk smoothly without resorting to reading off the slides. A glance at your notes is fine, reading it off sentence by sentence is not. You want to practice until you can say it and look natural. You don't want to practice so much that you've got every word memorized, but enough you can talk through several slides or points without looking at your notes. I'm serious though, practicing is the best way to calm your nerves so that once you start your talk you've got it down. You should go through an entire presentation perhaps 5-10x, or until you've got it down and smooth. You should be able to go through your entire talk without notes, and with your back to the screen/slides. You may forget some minor things here and there, that's fine as long as you get your main points across. Breathe You want to pause between your statements/thoughts so people have time to digest. Count to 3 seconds before continuing, if you need to. It may seem like an eternity up front, but it's not to the audience. If you have time, after feeling confident in your talk, find someone to practice with They can give you feedback on where you can improve, both in your story, slides and presentation style. You may also want to record yourself practicing to see if you have any distracting behaviors you may not be noticing."

Strauss addresses this relatively early into the novel.  ""It was then I realized the downside to this whole venture. A gulf was opening between men and women in my mind. I was beginning to see women solely as measuring instruments to give me feedback on how I was progressing as a pickup artist. They were my crash-test dummies, identifiable only by hair colors and numbers - a blonde 7, a brunette 10. Even when I was having a deep conversation, learning about a woman's dream and point of view, in my mind I was just ticking off a box in my routine marked ""rapport"". I bonding with men, I was developing an unhealthy attitude toward the opposite sex. And the most troubling thing about this mindset was that it seemed to be making me more successful with women.""

I started - unintentionally - thinking less about myself when I was in social situation because I wanted to know if it was true: so I started noticing the other people more, where they were looking at, what was their face expressions when talking. Was this true? Where they giving me the attention I was giving myself? Or where they really all focusing on themselves too? And since I started not paying attention to myself, with time, I got more confident. I started to stop giving a shit because I saw so many people act - because I was studying them - that I had so many examples to follow (or not) that I became... good. Not consciously because I wasn't trying to act good, but unconsciously. Just like any other art. That's how my Social Engineering started.   So here's my advice - and I'd say you choose a damn good subreddit for an advice like this:   Stop being self-centered and pay more attention to people when you're in social situation, be curious of them and don't be shy about it, people love attention. You're on a one-on-one conversation with a coworker? Look at him/her and asks question. Sure at first you might stare  or think you're asking stupid question and they'll think you're weird, but you'll get the hang of it.

SocialEngineering,34ggry,autowikibot,1 point,Fri May 1 01:36:27 2015 UTC,"Spotlight effect:       The spotlight effect is the phenomenon in which people tend to believe they are noticed more than they really are. Being that one is constantly in the center of one's own world, an accurate evaluation of how much one is noticed by others has shown to be uncommon. The spotlight effect was first reported in 1999, when Thomas Gilovich and Kenneth Savitsky coined the term.  The reasoning behind the spotlight effect comes from our human tendency to forget that although one is the center of one's own world, one is not the center of everyone else's. This tendency is especially prominent when one does something atypical.  Research has empirically shown that such drastic over-estimation of one's effect on others is widely common. Many professionals in social psychology encourage people to be conscious of the spotlight effect and to allow this phenomenon to moderate the extent to which one believes one is in a social spotlight.

Depending upon what type of reviews you're watching, some of those reviews are the modern equivalent of PR. I know, for example, this is very true in the gun community on Youtube. If you have a popular channel, manufacturers and the industry will provide you with everything you want: new toys, more ammo, free trips, ect. It's kept very quiet, except for the few genuine people who have explicitly called out manufacturers for doing this and trying to bribe them. If you look at gun reviews on Youtube for any type of gun, there's a good chance that the top videos were paid for.   The article linked above ends on this note:   When I think how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional media, I can't imagine they'll work any less hard to feed stories to bloggers, if they can figure out how.   They figured out bloggers, Youtube, and social media already. If you think social media and Youtube are not rife with PR, you're mistaken.  I think you're also mistaking the purpose of PR - it's not a direct offering like an advertisement with a specific ""call to action"" or even a branding awareness campaign. It's a tactic to manipulate and change people's perspectives of life, so that their lifestyle might more align with a product or service you are offering. For example, if you're a gun manufacturer, a PR article headline would be ""Women reconsidering their perspective on firearms"", a good advertisement is a ""impartial review"" video on youtube."

Re-reading what I wrote, I realize that I deviated from the point that I really wanted to make.  The submarine imagery that this article evoked really highlighted the reason that I find this sort of public relations so repulsive. People don't like feeling manipulated. And the PR industry's response to that fact is to try and hide the manipulation. I think a better long-term approach to winning hearts and minds is through transparency.

I say chain to primary because I want to see that a comment has been typed by XYZ Media for BM Media working for ChemCo.  Then make the fines astounding.   A number of years ago the Canadian Telcos didn't like a potential government decision and one of them told their employees to take all the time they needed to go out and shill every social media/comments section everywhere.   I am fairly certain that they must have been working off some central forum directing their efforts because some newspaper would write about how this government decision would really benefit the customer, then about 10 natural people would make a comment agreeing with the article, then suddenly within about 2 hours there would be 80 comments saying how it would destroy jobs, be bad value, and taste like poo.   I would have loved even a single one of those comments that was unattributed (in that in this case they were company directives to go out and make them) to have had a fine that the company would find nasty. Certainly this pattern of abuse should have have resulted in fines that the company would have reported in their year end as to why they didn't make as much profit.  So instead documenting the various ways that we can all detect shills (and help the shills be better at their jobs) we should push for something to stop them dead.  In newspapers for instance it is generally good form (and I think FTC enforced because of fraud like rules) that an advertisement that looks like an article must be marked as such."

I may stick around a while yet :)"
SocialEngineering,34bbno,potato_theory,3,Thu Apr 30 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"The subtle distinction between psychopaths and sociopaths is one of the reasons why Theodore Million is one of my favorite thinkers when it comes to personality.   Under his model, sociopaths are your classic antisocial personality, similar to a narcissist but more impulsive. Their violence and abuse of others is more instrumental and driven by tangible motivations (fear, greed, means to an end etc.).   Psychopaths on the other hand, fall under the sadistic personality. Sadistic and antisocial personalities have a lot of overlap, but a few key differences, mostly stemming from the pleasure/pain reversal in the emotional wiring of sadists. Most sociopaths don't achieve gratification from the suffering of others in and of itself. To a sadist, the ability to punish and harm others is salving to the ego, makes them feel powerful and in control. However, in order for this to happen, a sadist must have a degree of ""one-way"" emotional sensitivity that gives them the ability to perceive the emotions of others while remaining unaffected unless they're in pain. Most sociopaths by comparison are numb to the emotions of others. Sociopaths also have a limited ability to form and maintain relationships, usually with blood relatives and long-standing or essential allies, while still maintaining a ""me and mine first"" worldview. Sadists however view people purely as objects, to be abused, exploited, coerced, conned or manipulated and feel zero remorse for their actions. That is where the famous ""mask of sanity"" comes in. It allows sadists to interact with others while avoiding revealing their true selves, who most people would avoid or destroy if they knew the truth or had a choice.   And this plays out perfectly in the stereotypes of both. The classic sociopath is a gang banger or Mafioso-type who pursues a predatory lifestyle using violence and coercion to achieve tangible goals such as wealth, power, and security. Whereas a psychopath hides in plain sight and exploits others/society to achieve a position of power that enables them to engage in sadistic behavior without fear of retaliation. That's why infamous serial killers are always unremarkable or have a socially desirable persona that conceals their inner viciousness.   A good example of these contrasts would characters on the Walking Dead. Guys like Shane and Merle are classic sociopaths. Notice how they do have some genuine relationships, experience remorse/guilt, and while violent, the violence is mainly impulsive and as a means to an end, rather than an end in and of itself. Whereas characters like the Governor, the Termites, and Pete are psychopaths. They all wear a non-threatening ""mask of sanity"" that serves to disarm others while they engage in violence almost purely for emotional gratification. Rather than reject social norms and group alignments, they seek to draw others in and gain their trust so they can use them to further their own goals. Also, if they do feel anything resembling remorse, it's driven mainly by failure to achieve their goals, rather than guilt over the harm they've done.   What this means for normal people is the following: sociopaths can evolve and can be trusted provided they respect you and you're not under any illusions about their loyalty (think Jayne from Firefly, Tony Soprano, or Bellamy Blake from the 100). A psychopath on the other hand cannot be trusted, and the only sane response is to avoid them like the plague. If avoidance isn't an option, an effective strategy is to turn their lust for sadistic gratification against them by leading them into a trap where you can gain the upper hand and/or expose them (cutting them off from their power base). But this is very risky as psychopaths are very cunning and very ruthless. If you must face down a psychopath, you must be equally ruthless, as standing up to them makes you a target for their sadistic desires and they won't stop until you're at their mercy, which is the last place you want to be."

SocialEngineering,345ao9,cdddfe,58,Tue Apr 28 12:32:54 2015 UTC,"I've had some success with agree-and-amplify (as /u/dzunravel suggests), and also with the politician's tactic of imposing a completely different narrative, as if the other person hadn't spoken at all.  Smashing the cadence of dialogue in this way is actually moderately difficult to get used to doing, because people are hardwired by society to respond to narratives with something that continues that narrative and makes coherent sense. It's what allows people to control the direction of a conversation. Tossing convention to the curb can give the impression that whatever the other person said, it just wasn't important enough to be responded to, and whatever you're saying is much more so.  Don't let them regain the upper hand in the conversation from that point; steamroll them, change tack unexpectedly to throw off the responses they're building, and generally drag them along stuttering in your wake."
SocialEngineering,345ao9,Geminii27,20,Tue Apr 28 13:23:14 2015 UTC,This is my approach.

SocialEngineering,345ao9,lamb_pudding,2,Wed Apr 29 00:41:43 2015 UTC,"It can depend a lot of on context. Pretty much anything which doesn't make immediate sense as a response, or simply starting a completely new conversation.  Grabbing the conversation and hijacking it by responding in a way which initially makes sense is more agree-and-amplify, as you're starting out moving in the same direction. This can work as a less confrontational tactic, but it does have the potential downside that you get bulldozed before you can make the turn, and it then looks like you were agreeing that the antagonist had control of the conversation.  Repeatedly smashing cadence can just make you sound concussed, but if you do it once and then barrel along controlling the flow hard, hardly anyone ever even notices because their brain fills in the gap and they assume the original conversation took a hard left somewhere rather than it being brutally stomped on. Control can then be established by hitting the antagonist with a pile of cadence-response forms so that they're compelled to answer in a certain way without much time to think.  Questions are a good one, especially if they're the kind which can't be answered snappily, or if the answer is going to be a magician's force or a red herring. Stage and street performers often have huge volumes of these up their sleeves if they interact with audiences. Watch someone with a line of snappy patter work an audience volunteer almost like there's puppet strings involved. The words themselves often don't matter all that much; the issue is the way the interaction flows and is perceived by others to be heading: who has control of the topic, and who's being dragged along in their wake?"

Agree and amplify at first, because you should laugh at yourself. If they say something again make assertive eye contact with them and say in a friendly but serious voice that you would appreciate it if they stopped. Something along those lines.  Another option is to pull them aside when you're in a group of people and say something, or catch them when they leave the group and tell them.  The trick is to let them know it doesn't bother you at first. If they keep going, you want to let them know that it's disrespectful and you'd appreciate if they cut their shit out. Overall, you don't want to make it a big deal or make a scene out of it because a lot of these types of assholes will take that as a challenge. You also then look like someone who can't take a joke.

Also, you don't always have to amplify. For example, if somebody calls you lazy, just agree wholeheartedly with them and move on with the conversation as if it doesn't matter.

SocialEngineering,345ao9,Kazuke86,23,Tue Apr 28 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"The key is an air of confidence that you truly don't care if you are the butt of the joke.

However there are a few key points in pulling off...  First you must realize your not showing weakness, you are showing off your armor/tough skin.  Second, this like everything else in SE is based on confidence. This requires a straight spine & a firm clear voice. This also comes from the fact that you know you're fucking awesome and you shouldn't stand for that shit.   Third the hardest part of this, is the initial pivot point. This is where you gain control of the situation. This part will make or break you, you need to hold on to that control. Once you have it don't let it go, keep amplifying. Start to weave the STFU whenever they try to rebut.  Now about that feeling corny, if you're feeling it relax don't worry.  Corny is exactly where you want to be, with A&A you're soap-boxing!

If something is funny, it's FINE to laugh with it! Just leave your ego out of it. If you're taking it personally, you're taking it as an ego-hit which only makes their ""attack"" more effective.   The point is, while the person making the insults may feel like they've ""upped"" you, if you're able to genuinely laugh with them about what they're saying, they're the ones that will end up looking like dicks. This is where the power of the amplify comes in too.  Corny-ness you mentioned above simply comes from your mind state. It's a subjective opinion, and if you honestly feel like you're being corny that's exactly what you're going to sub-communicate to everyone. If you can actually, truthfully laugh at it and show that their words are meaningless to you, having the stronger frame will make everyone else feel the same.   If their words hurt you, people will accept that reality. If you're entirely unaffected by what was said and can even laugh at it too, people will accept that reality as well."

SocialEngineering,345ao9,dzunravel,2,Tue Apr 28 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"This might sound bad but I'm not trying to be mean. Usually if you are always getting picked on with jokes etc, it is by people with low self esteem. They might even hang out with you just to do this. Or it could b co-workers who you can't control that you have to be around them.   There is a few ways to deal with this besides ignoring them and/or not hanging with them if you can.   Usually a one time remark that really exposes that person does the trick. You don't have to know their weakness buy it helps. Their wife left them ? Say is that why your wife left you ?  It shows them that if they want to attack you, you will fire back and you will say low ball shit. Obviously you don't want to get in a back in forth with this person as then you are just slinging mud. But from my experience one remark such as, ""trying to say shit about me don't change your small penis"" or whatever does the trick. Look at them directly in the eyes when you say it snd then don't look at them again. It shows that you don't respect them nor care about their shitty remarks. Again don't drag it out with them.   One comment to defend yourself, and point out that they are just picking on you to the rest of the people there, and you sent a shot back.   Again usually these types of people have low self esteem and one shot back is enough to knock em back.   Another tactic I use that works depending on the setting is just a very confused ""what"" with a confused look on my face and then ignore.   If it continues, or you can use it on the first time, just say something along the lines of , ""do you like me cause your just staying on my dick"" or ""chill man your on my dick pretty hard today""  It makes other people see that they are attacking you or all about you and you handled it pretty good.   It deflects back onto them and you don't have to say anything again."

Simply saying, ""don't use anything reheased -- just be yourself"" is unproductive.  Giving them a starting point is important.  And yes, it might be rehersed, but its in order to build confidence to get them to the point where they can wing it and be successful on their own.

SocialEngineering,345ao9,SOwED,0,Wed Apr 29 10:26:11 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not missing the point. It's not like being bad at picking up girls in OP's situation, because pickup requires approaching random girls, which isn't easy for everyone. That isn't necessary in OP's situation, because he's already in the thick of it, and he needs wit to help him.  Maybe using lines for pickup would help just to get over approach anxiety, but this isn't applicable in OP's situation.   You can read my other comments in this thread to see how I told OP to deal with the situation.  By the way, going on the offensive with your defensive tone looks a little silly."

Further, I didn't say it isn't like picking up girls at any point.  What I'm saying is that prepared lines could help with approaching, an aspect of pickup girls that doesn't have any counterpart in OP's situation. Do you see what I'm saying? You seem to be reading my comments looking for ways you can make me look incorrect, but I don't think you're truly digesting the actual content.  Prepared lines don't work in real life situations in general, be it countering an insult or impressing a girl. OP wants to make his opponent look pathetic. So he should do that by clearly revealing to everyone that these situations have affected him so much that he prepared responses?  A situation-based, in the moment response is always better."
SocialEngineering,345ao9,m1tt,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:28:01 2015 UTC,"You don't get it.  (also, don't ask me to dig for your comments then criticize when I pick ""the wrong one"").  I'll put it as simply as I can.  I'm giving him some ways to swing a bat to hit a baseball.  Will these ways always hit every pitch?  No.  Will they hit some pitches?  Yes.    You're telling him these prepared ways won't always hit the baseball (duh).  Instead -- just try and react to whatever pitch the guy throws.  That's pretty obvious (and useless) advice.  You are teaching them nothing. Anyone can do that and will be as successful as their natural talents and gifts will let them.    Watch this wonderful example. Carr is a professional dealing with hecklers.  A professional among professionals  We all wish we could do as well he could do.  This is the epitome of what we could hope for OP.  But still, STILL there are prepared lines (3:33  and 9:10).  HE HAS PREPARED.  He's not just 100% winging it.  So don't give me bs about prepared lines not working.  Even the best of the best have a few they trot out every now and again.   These are building blocks to get some confidence.  Are they going to hit a homerun every time?  Hell no.  But you absorb, refine, adapt.  Crawl, walk, run.  Learn, practice, actualize.    So don't pretend you're helping by telling OP he should use a situation-based in-the-moment response and expect him to be immediately successful.  You might as well be telling him to just get up there and be Jimmy Carr."
SocialEngineering,345ao9,auriem,0,Thu Apr 30 02:40:57 2015 UTC,"This is the first comment in this entire thread I'm writing from my computer.  It's kind of a hassle to go find comments and link them on mobile.  Also, you didn't even look at the context of the comment you quoted me on.  Good grief.  Here's one of the comments I was thinking of  You're training him to hit a ball off a tee then sending him into the major leagues.   That's pretty obvious (and useless) advice. You are teaching them nothing.    None of my comments that you've read have been in response to OP.  Every one of my comments that you've read and responded to have been in the thread starting with your comment here.  You're attacking me for not pointing OP in the right direction, but all I've been doing in these comments has been saying what not to do, which is your prepared lines.  I'm not the only one who thought they were garbage, so I'm not sure why you're singling me out for trying to defend them.  As for the video you linked (and the specific times where he uses the same line), I thank you for providing evidence against yourself.  Yes, he uses a prepared line, but in both instances he ad libs, then uses the prepared line for the final blow.  Your suggestion was to jump straight into the prepared lines, which is not what Carr did at all.  I never said prepared lines have no place at all.  I said using them as a freestanding offense or defense is bad advice.  Again, I emphasize, I never at any point suggested to OP the vague idea that he should use the situation and leave him stranded wondering what that meant.  I figured you had read other comments in this post and knew what I meant, but apparently not.  If you still don't get how terrible your advice was, let me explain.  ""You seem upset, is something else wrong? No really, are you lashing out to me because something happened to you recently?""  For starters, why are you making things personal.  Maybe something actually did happen and you're turning a situation of you getting teased to you getting your ass kicked or getting shunned by others present because they know that your opponent's mother was just diagnosed with cancer or something and this party is his only distraction from the news.  Being a prick alone just makes you look like a prick.  You have to have something clever rolled in with it if you're going to come off looking superior in any way.  ""They do make decaffeinated coffee you know.""  Maybe the guy's on coke or very drunk.  This would be a ridiculous thing to say.  What situations are you using this line in?  Maybe just joking around with a few friends at work or something it would be appropriate, but in a somewhat hostile environment against someone who's giving you shit?  Please.  It makes you look like you've never been out of your house.  ""Meth is a hellava drug.""  Yeah, again, if you're at a party and you use this line against someone who already doesn't like you, things may not go well for you at all.  ""Is this you're way saying you're attracted to me? Hey, I'm flattered. No really, I understand -- you made your point.""  This one I agree with, as OP said his sexuality is being questioned, so it at least is takes the situation into account (though I don't know if that was your intent).  Regardless, this line doesn't take things far enough.  You're agreeing and being neutral, but you need to agree and amplify.  ""I could try to explain it further, but I don't have crayons.""  This one is a great line.  I heard it first somewhere on reddit used as the final blow after a series of witty lines.  Obviously if someone insinuated that you were gay or that your friends didn't actually like you, this line would make no sense at all.  Really, it sounds like you are the most clever person in your friend group, but also that your friend group consists of high schoolers who are just shooting the shit in the cafeteria.  There's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't sound like it applies to OP's situation."

SocialEngineering,345ao9,harrisz2,5,Wed Apr 29 08:16:00 2015 UTC,"The trick, no matter what the situation is, is remaining completely calm. I mean at-ease. Keep your voice down. Do not show any signs of strain. A lot of people are saying agree and amplify. If the situation calls for it, sometimes it will work but like I saw you say, it can easily bite you in the ass. Especially if you are up against a crowd.  I prefer redirection by means of pulling out the insecurities of person who is insulting you. A lot of the time there is no need to even address what is being said to you.  You really need to actively think about WHO is insulting you. Usually within a few times of talking to a person you can kind of pick up on their insecurities, or at least where an insecurity can be planted. Physical apperance is usually a good bet if you don't know the person well.  The thing everyone seems to be missing is that insulting someone is entirely in the delivery. You NEED some amount of charisma to make an insult stick.   Hastily delivered insults tend to end up like,  ""Dude fuck do you like want to look like a big idiot in front of everyone each time we hang out""  is a lot less effective than a calmly delivered,  ""Johh you're making a fool out of yourself. Why don't you calm down before your fetal alcohol syndrome eyes bulge out of their fucking sockets.""  My favorite things to insult people about is their intelligence, percieved drug/alcohol abuse, physical apperance, social standing in a group, problems with a significant other, lack of a significant other, family problems, really any of the low balls. If you really want to stand up for yourself, don't be afraid to really hurt someones feelings."

SocialEngineering,345ao9,MACP,2,Wed Apr 29 02:45:41 2015 UTC,"I got fucked with a bit in highschool. I was shy and quiet, on top of being fairly awkward and quite ""weird."" There was about five times I can think of anyone tried to actually do anything to me. I immediately got aggressive and loud.      First time, the kid called by bluff. I told him I should kick his ass for putting something on my shirt. I couldn't kick his ass at all, and got apples thrown at me on my walk home.  The next few times I just made jokes. One kid said he wanted to meet me at some park, my friend and I asked him for a ride because we didn't have a car. Another time I put my hand to my head and pretended I was talking on a phone, asking if the fake person would help fight someone with me.      The next time these two kids fucked with me a few times in the hall way, and while I was alone one pushed the other one into me, into a locker. I yelled at them as they walked away to get the fuck back here. Either one of them could have kicked my ass, both avoided me the rest of the year in school.  Another kid would say shit on the bus, one day he said something so I yelled back at him and told him to say what he said louder. He said something and I told him I'd talk to him after we stopped, since we lived a block away from each other. I got off the bus first and waited for him and immediately asked him what was up and kept calling him a cunt and a faggot. Him and his friends started to walk away, so I headed home. Then they said something, so I calmly turned around and walked towards them and they booked. There was I think three of them.  The final time someone had a problem with me and my friends. He told my friend he was going to kick his ass, so I stepped between them and in a joking tone I said ""even me?!"" He pushed me, so I grabbed him by the mouth and slammed him against a locker. I stopped and started laughing, and while I did he jumped off the locker onto my back, forcing me to my knees. He punched me in the back of the head a couple times. When I stood him his face was all bloody because he hit himself in the nose.      I've never been one to give a fuck, and I think people tend to realize that. I'm not an outwardly aggressive person, nor confident. I keep quiet to this day, and avoid confrontation when I can, but if someone is fucking with me I'm not afraid to speak up. A couple weeks ago some guy at a house party, in a city I'd never been before, was being a dick to this girl I knew. He tried to make a shitty joke (""You're hanging out with this guy? He's got more hair then I have pubes.""), so I jokingly asked him if he even had pubes. He pulled my hair, so I just laughed and walked away.      Another time I found myself in a ""brawl"" between a bunch of girls, three of them being my friends, fighting four other girls, and two guys. I pulled one girl off my friend's sister, then her boyfriend got in front of me and asked ""did you just touch my girlfriend?"" I said ""no, of course not,"" because I'm not about to fight someone. I went inside, got my car keys, went out to my car and took my little kids purple metal baseball bat from the back seat. Slammed it on the ground and yelled ""everyone get the fuck out."" Everyone got the fuck out.  That was the second time that bat has helped me. The first time some kids in a car followed mine after they cut me off at a 4 way stop, and I drove up their ass then passed them. I reached behind me, grabbed the bat, which they saw then immediately stopped in the road and turned around and hauled ass.      Most of the time if someone is going to fuck with you they expect zero resistance. They probably don't want to fight either, because they're probably a bitch deep down. How you handle it is your call, but if you're going to make jokes, don't stop. Be a dick about it. If you're going to call their bluff of getting physical, be prepared to get physical because they might call yours. To be honest, the ""huh, what?"" should work pretty good most of the time. Otherwise the old ""No I will not make out with you!"" is a pretty good one because it's lame as fuck; why waste good material on douches? Another good one is laughing obnoxiously at their jokes, but make sure it sounds SOMEWHAT realistic, and don't stop. If they get up set, tell them they're the funniest girl you've ever heard."

No.   However, you can write that same letter to the CEO, COO, and every other executive officer in the insurance company detailing your complaints and the people you talked to and their ineptitude. Go on LinkedIn and find them all. Print 45 copies of the letter if need be.  If even just 1 of those people reads the letter above, they could simply dictate that it's handled.   Escalate the problem within the organization you are fighting. ""Writing the press"" is an antiquated version of ""Writing a scathing Yelp review"" - although it may legitimately hurt the public relations of the organization, it does nothing to actually further your cause.   Ask yourself: what is your goal? Will the newspaper help you achieve that goal? Probably not - if anything, the newspaper might just elevate (through public news) your problem to that same executive you could write to directly."

SocialEngineering,344bfh,thetemple,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:27:28 2015 UTC,"First, consider the credibility of the accuser. If the person making the accusations is just some insane clown from the internet, ignore it entirely. If it’s 1,000 insane clowns from the internet making the same accusation, ignore it entirely. If it’s 10,000 or 100,000 random weirdo clowns from the internet, ignore it entirely.  But – when that one reporter or person with credibility and an audience accuses you of something, that’s when you need to step in.  Then, it really depends upon the nature of the accusations because there’s different strategies. For example, if someone calls you a sexist, you can’t do anything to refute that, in fact you shouldn’t even refute it, you should minimizing your acknowledging of it. So, one has to first ask: should I even acknowledge and debate the legitimacy of these attacks? Will acknowledging these attacks further damage my reputation by associating my name further with this controversy?  You’ve got accusations that fall into two categories: those that are true, and those that are false. Sometimes it’s easier to just come clean, but to come clean in a limited way, “Yes, I did use steroids, but only once, in 1999 while at Gold’s Gym in San Francisco.” This will attract sympathy through apologies and “transparency.” Other times you should just deny, deny, deny. Following that, you attack, attack, attack (""These accusations are baseless! Only right-wing extremist conspiracy theorists would ever accuse...."")  If you’re owning up to something and trying to gain sympathy, you should not justify why you did it at all, but instead talk about the victims you impacted. The strongest public manipulation is focusing on the emotions of the victims and then the vengeance. People are moved by sadness and easily enraged by revenge. So, if you did steroids back in 1999 at Gold’s Gym, talk about how it impacted your loved ones, family, professional associations, ect ect ect through this very tight lens of guilt and regret (even talk about how your balls shrunk and you want to apologize to your wife because she was unsatisfied, people eat that shit up) – then bring it all back to how, because this experience, you are going to dedicate your whole life to getting people off of steroids use, changing everyone’s lives for the better, you’re going to fix the world, ect, ect… If you can, affix your story of vengeance and redemption on one easily understood target: you're going to close Gold Gym, because of their history of steroid abuse, ""either clean their act up or close down!"""

SocialEngineering,33jglh,69ing,45,Thu Apr 23 00:32:46 2015 UTC,"The term ""conspiracy theorist"" is only pejorative because it's associated with whackjobs making up crazy shit without sufficient evidence. If most theorizing about grand conspiracies turned out to be well-supported, the term wouldn't have any negative associations. When you have enough evidence to prove that a conspiracy actually occurred (e.g. Watergate), most people celebrate your investigation into the facts. So even if the CIA popularized it, they picked a pretty neutral term.  But this article doesn't really prove what it sets out to. The whole argument is just post hoc ergo propter hoc. It does show much greater use in the 45 years after the CIA memo, but that could just be due to a generally increase in the prominence of conspiracy theories in American life (the memo came out after the Warren Commission Report, after all) and the gradual, natural popularization of the term. Instead of comparing 45 year chunks, it would be interesting to compare the years immediately before and after the memo was released."
SocialEngineering,33jglh,thizzacre,15,Thu Apr 23 02:10:06 2015 UTC,"Consider the words ""feminist"" and ""fundamentalist"".

SocialEngineering,33jglh,TheVeryMask,9,Thu Apr 23 04:52:57 2015 UTC,"I think this is also true with a lot of political speech: ""fascism"" and ""capitalism"" are so loaded of terms that you can't even begin having a conversation about these topics because people have such a strong bias. When I was doing political organizing, especially when working with leftist anti-capitalist folks, I would insist that they create propaganda that instead explains the specific element of ""capitalism"" that they're objecting to (maybe, for example: exploitation, environmental concerns, inequality, et al). Because otherwise if you say ""capitalism"" to another person they're thinking it means entrepreneurialism, economic freedom, opportunity, ect. Meanwhile, ""fascist"" is so directly related to Nazism directly that if I'm trying to describe a public policy I have to use words like ""authoritarian"" (or ""totalitarian"") which doesn't come with the same sobriety as recognizing a policy or action as ""fascist."""
SocialEngineering,33jglh,fidelitypdx,8,Thu Apr 23 05:47:55 2015 UTC,"The problems here is that those who are feminist who are not overt and obnoxious don't get recognized as such.   Even those who claim to be feminist but don't qualify as the whack job nuts you find on twitter and tumblr are told they're not even feminist by ""feminists""  While no true scotsman is definite in high regard here,  the reality is that words are defined by contemporary usage.   A second factor comes into play.  When you have feminists who are of a normal and standard demeanor and belief,  one that is simply equality and not lunacy, rape culture, and oppression at every turn,  people generally agree with them,  by this agreement you find that the general population doesn't see them as requiring a second term to define them because they hold views that are, even if not pronounced, a general consensus.      All cases of pejoration of group labels adheres to this, although other caveats may exists.   Fundamentalism for example by definition is a strict view of literalist interpretations of the holy books, regardless of religion.   Given that this is far removed from even the normal religious groups,  it results in this sort of view.   It is rare to find fundamentalists who do not hold views that are very much agreeable with the empirical knowledge of the world and as such the view there is likely properly applied and not a bad apple pejoration.     With conspiracy theorists you see a similar case as I we did in feminism above.     A ""conspiracy theorist""  who discovered Watergate would be seen not as a conspiracy theorist but as an investigative hobbyist/journalist or some other general term,  because while it relates to a conspiracy properly,  the finding of ""conspiracy"" in general is a quite prevalent thing,  as almost every crime involving more than a single person is a conspiracy,  and we do not refer to police detectives as conspiracy theorists,  though regularly you they apply theories to their work in understanding and routing conspiracy in the criminal world.     You have to consider the function language at the root to understand how it works,  it isn't so simple as a term becomes a designation to a certain group with its meaning representing the actions of loudest and most radical members,   rather you also have to consider what groups the less radical members of the similar belief system / view / whatever belongs to,   typically they move away from that designation as they approach the median view point.  Other terms such as communist,  liberal, and what not,  do not have a specific designation,  rather they  are over generalization pejoratives,  which   blanket lots are tossed under for the sole purpose of describing it as such typically for  a fallacious ad hominem approach to the discourse.   These terms generally are not viewed to actually represent any specific set,  except when the actual usage is properly used,  which is not in favor in the pejorative form."

You're on reddit, where both feminism and fundamentalism are held on low regard (though these words come from different categories: fundamentalism is only ever used by someone outside a fundamentalist group, wing, or cadre, whereas feminism is both what feminists usually self identify as and what non feminists call them). As a feminist (who'd call herself an egalitarian if she were trying to social engineer you into listening instead of dismissing her views on feminism, but I'm talking about SE and language, so bear with me), I can definitely point out that while ""fundamentalist"" is thus at best neutral and at worst pejorative on the level of the stance within the word itself, feminist is a different class of term.  I don't know how many conspiracy theorists self identify as such, but I'd expect it's more comparable to the word fundamentalist.   By contrast, in plenty of social contexts, feminist is a neutral to positive descriptor. In the world where I work, you don't want to be known as anti feminist, and even being known as ""not a feminist"" will lead to a skeptical ""really?""

It is a multifaceted phenomenon that can affect different stages of designs, processes, contexts, and situations.  Hindsight bias may cause memory distortion, where the recollection and reconstruction of content can lead to false theoretical outcomes. It has been suggested that the effect can cause extreme methodological problems while trying to analyze, understand, and interpret results in experimental studies. A basic example of the hindsight bias is when, after viewing the outcome of a potentially unforeseeable event, a person believes he or she ""knew it all along"". Such examples are present in the writings of historians describing outcomes of battles, physicians recalling clinical trials, and in judicial systems trying to attribute responsibility and predictability of accidents.

Tell them you're doing an investigation into fraud (maybe your mom sent a bill from the hospital and you're investigating that, when they say ""she was never here"" tell them you need that in writing? either way,) you need a document stating that they have no patient files or that they have files, but you just need some sort of confirmation one way or another. Perhaps though, just acknowledge the existence of the file is HIPPA information and you'll encounter lots of barriers. You'd need a fax machine too (throwaway eFax account), because everything is done via fax and you're not going to have a @insurancecompany.com email address - the hospital might insist upon mailing it, so you'd need a PO box too. You could use a PO box in the insurance company's real physical HQ's city, lots of places (like UPS as an example) offer PO boxes and will forward you the mail no questions asked.

In any case, use something you have actual knowledge to use, and something which fits your personality.  2) Develop rapport immediately. Start the call mentioning how you just got off the phone with somebody who you figured out some tough way to help, and ask if they have had to do that recently. You have to show that you have sincere interest in the person on the other side.  3) Indicate some sort of hardship in which they are the only solution. Try something like, ""My boss is breathing down my neck, I've tried everything, and my deadline is tomorrow.""   4) Make sure the person you are speaking with has the ability to do what you're asking. If they don't, ask for the number for the person who will, and get the name of the person you are speaking with.   5) Give them a fax number, your name, and your ""company"".   6) If you have to speak with somebody else, name drop the person you just spoke with and repeat.   7) All of this has to be consistent.  8) Do whatever they say needs to be done to get the docs. Don't put them through hardship, so be ready to fax a HIPAA Auth.

Then call the police to that location, say you saw someone there shooting another man, encourage an armed response. If these guys are armed to carry out the threat they are currently making, and the police turn up, they should have everything they need to warrant a suspicion to be searched and incriminated.

What would help your father is a skilled mental health professional.

It's an unfortunate situation, and I'm sorry to hear you're going through it. Know that many people have family members who are intentionally manipulative, deceitful, and abusive.

SocialEngineering,330b5e,bobodod,7,Sat Apr 18 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, first of all thanks for the extensive comment.  You touched on a couple of points I've been dealing with with him.   I do think he is manipulative in various ways. For example he is a pathological liar, at least in my perception.   Bear in mind that he is of Indian descent, where he was born and raised, whereas I was born and raised in Central Europe. So there is a cultural difference there regarding the meaning of lying.   But given my definition of a lie being a deceitful statement that has the purpose of benefiting him or harming me, he is a liar. I know this because I always question everything he says. And quite honestly it disgusts me. This is one of the reasons I'm very averse towards Indians.   He keeps people near to him by keeping them dependent on him, primarily through financial means. He doesn't like the fact that I'm not in that situation anymore and has on more than one occasion tried to offer me deals that would benefit me but keep me dependent on him.  He has no concept of personal boundaries and will do all kinds of stuff such as immediately ask me where I am when I answer the phone, ask me about my business or other things. He would also regularly open my mail when I lived with my parents or barge into my room as I was not permitted a key.  Recently I've been coming more to terms that I really enjoy my life without him. When thinking about the past and my childhood I remembered how, as a child of 8 years, I literally prayed for his plane to crash and him to die whenever he was traveling. I really resented and mistrusted him from a very early age.  A big issue between us is communication. I don't speak his language and his vocabulary of my first language is rather simple. He can't understand a lot of the things I've tried to tell him in the past and I believe he doesn't want to.  So all things considered, I feel that I'll have to distance myself from him and break off contact.  Wow. Writing this feels good and I did not expect it to become this long."

I need this one, with these and those measurements.... etc. yada, yada, yada"" Me: ""OK Dad, got it. I know which one you need. I'll get it shortly before I leave."" Dad: ""OK, thanks.""  Every second week: Dad: ""So regarding big-bulky-thing, you know I need these and those measurements right?"" Me: ""Yes, you've told me that."" Dad: ""Did you get it yet?"" Me: ""No. I'll get it shortly before I leave""  Rinse and repeat with a slight variation of his reason for bringing it up every second week."

SocialEngineering,330b5e,Lunra,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:12:03 2015 UTC,I am similar to your dad where when asking for somebody to do something I will repeat it back for confirmation. And I will follow up to ensure somebody is doing said task. For me it basically comes down to trust and if I think they are capable of getting the thing done. So your dad might not trust you to get the task done within the time frame. The way people have been able to have me stop nagging them is to reassure me occasionally. So be proactive (saying to him I'm doing it) instead of reactive (telling him you will do it eventually).

Remote living, large land, jackass neighbor with an ATV being a nuisance.  This guy would even shot deer on my friend's land, knowing there was a family with small children there.  My friend ended up having to move.  Not ideal for everyone, but if it comes to that.  It is a viable option for the welfare of your family.    The Swordfish option:  Make messing with your family such a bad idea that no one in their right mind would dare do so.  I'm not advocating anything illegal or anything that would endanger your neighbor, but make damn sure the repercussions for encroaching upon your peace are reprehensible.   This may be the most difficult.  Honestly try to befriend your neighbor.  Invite him and his family over for a cookout or something.  Include his family into your lives.  Make it to the point where he is genuinely considerate of you and your family.  In short, earn his respect.     tl;dr:  Move, get creative or earn his respect.    edit:  word"

Why would you avoid the most effective and efficient way to handle this guy?  Your goal should be to get this person evicted.

The cops might be interested in noise violations, illegal drugs, and other problems. The county might be interested in building violations, fire hazards, and other non-compliance to code.

When i was younger i could never understand why my neighbors had a problem with my doing something noisey or partying until the wee hours just a few times a year but i never did stuff that caused my friends any real grief because they were MY friends.   IN any case, document the evidence, video tape his behavior, covertly if possible.  Have your lawyer write a strongly worded letter to the landlord and pursue legal action if necessary. If there is going to be revenge/blowback then so be it but i would suggest some video or trail cameras.

Keep the video clinical, 60 Minutes style, don't be emotional in it.  If the cops blow you off over the phone, record that and put that at the end of the video.  You're entitled to law enforcement and protection, you pay for it, and they're simply not doing their jobs.  This situation, if it goes on long enough, is sure to get the attention of the press.

It's well proven that people are in some ways completely different people when they have little of no chance being identified online.  I for one am extremely glad to see some more content on this sub that isn't just a ""10 tips and tricks to get a raise"" type deal, but if we look at this for what it is, it's really just people looking to get laid or see some breasts on a platform that is almost principally used as a medium for that sort of exchanges. I also would like to point out that it's unfair to make sweeping generalizations about men in particular, like ""guys will say anything to get what they want"", when we all know that it's a certain sort of personality, not a certain gender, that's manipulative.  Also, I'm genuinely curious about what you meant to prove by doing this.

I, like you, never flirt with them or lead them on and yet I am bombarded with this type of behaviour.   I am not even talking about kik either. I'm an avid gamer and am subjected to this behaviour when I am simply trying to relax, have fun and play some games.  I'm glad you could see why women tend to hate the 'overly friendly' guy as it always turns out that he's just doing it for some ass.  There are lonely people out there, I've met a lot of them and have become friends with some of them... But a majority of the male population online (when interacting with women) behave this way, unfortunately (in the gaming community at least).   I can't set my avatars to a picture of myself because I am scared of all of the harassment I will cop.   If we don't get abused, insulted or told to get back in the kitchen 'where we belong', we are harassed for naked pictures and bombarded with creepy PMs/dick pics.

I wish people could seperate their primitive/biological/instinctive behaviors from rational thinking and respecting other people as being human."
SocialEngineering,32lbj1,Gnomish8,18,Wed Apr 15 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"I agree to a point. To me, the guy that got rejected wasn't ""friend zoned."" He got rejected. It happens to the best of us.

SocialEngineering,32lbj1,nomdeanon,14,Tue Apr 14 22:36:05 2015 UTC,"I've done similar ""experiments"" and come to the same conclusions as you.   I would take MFC girls and post on /r/gonewild. No matter how average, ugly or fat the girl was, I would get dozens of notifications and at least a few dick pics within a few minutes. It was insane. Especially if I posted a hot girl, I couldn't refresh the page without getting new notifications. I've done similar things on POF and it was practically impossible to keep up with my inbox due to the high volume of messages I was getting.   I've used Male Model profiles on POF and would not get the same results. I would get girls who messaged me here and there. I could get away with saying the most ridiculous things but when I asked to meetup or for nudes, it was really rare for them to reciprocate. They would want me to talk to them a lot more. With my girl profiles, I could literally just tell the guy where to meet in my first 2-3 messages and they would be there in a heartbeat. Whereas the average/ugly guy profiles literally get no messages and hardly any replies."
SocialEngineering,32lbj1,nomdeanon,3,Tue Apr 14 22:52:00 2015 UTC,"Regarding the male profiles it is not and will never be the same to be a hot guy compared to the power a hot girl yields.   Girls have fragile egos and require more investment to let their guard down.  They are not used to rejection.  Guys on the other hand are much more used to being rejected.   That said find the right niche and it's easy to find girls down for most things.  For example using the moderated omegle (not unmoderated)  you can find some level of success with mutual fapping  with girls by having a decent body and a good sized dick.   What you're doing is screening all the normal girls and looking for the ones that are horny in that moment.  But everyone likes to maintain the illusion that they're not on Webcam for the opposite sex or to get sexual but most of the time they are.  It's just finding the people in the right approach to protect their fragile egos and let them go with their desires.   Exact same method for tinder.  Incidentally, those who use tinder may use it abroad,  I have no idea why people are reluctant to do this,  your value is never higher than as a novelty cock for foreign women.  You speak a high level of English and that is a lot of value in and of itself.  Just be nice,  good looking and well spoken and it's easy to get away with most things.   What people don't realise is that attractive people should not 'overgame'.  They come off as arrogant and even if they are bright,  it doesn't add anything to the feelings of the people around you to brag about your achievements.  Your looks like it or not,  are achievement enough for most women. They are your Amex black card to go anywhere and do anything.   That's a reality few want to confront.  Women feel insecure around a man that they value much higher than  themselves. And in order to unlock their ability to be free about how much they want you,  you have to give them some kind of investment or plausible deniability.   For guys around a high value woman it's much the same but the competition is far greater,  so lower value guys have a punt a bit like it's a lottery ticket rather than a calculated use of resources.   Number one rule of anything:  know the odds,  do more of higher probability success activities and less of lower probability success 'negative traits'"
SocialEngineering,32lbj1,wildmetacirclejerk,4,Tue Apr 14 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"Well written and spot on.    I agree completely about foreign Tindering.  I used it in Japan for one week, with great success.   In fact, I use it whenever I travel to a new city in the U.S.   Somehow guys from out of town are disposable, and I understand the logic, but it makes women more willing to invest a little time and possibly get laid, without having to deal with the emotional fallout of an over attached guy."
SocialEngineering,32lbj1,Imsomniland,2,Wed Apr 15 05:27:01 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing on Tinder, made a profile and fake facebook (it's harder than you think) with a very good looking guy friend's pictures (with full permission).    I got 100 times more matches than my normal profile, but I learned a few things:  Once they get over the initial ""tittering"" attraction, they settle back into the same basic formula.    It's a sieve:  Is this guy boyfriend material, marriage material, or fuckboy material?    Does he have money?   Does he have social value?    Is he dominant or submissive?     Is he intelligent / educated?  (usually educated has more value than intellect).     There's a reason why most successful hiring managers are female, they can identify a quality guy much more effectively than a male can.    Also, women are intimidated by attractiveness.  Some normal looking women were at first bringing their A-game, but then their insecurities would leak through and they'd say ""why would someone like you want to talk to someone like me"".   And that insecurity was decidedly unsexy.      I would even offer to meet that same day to the ones who were very attractive and interested in me, and they would flake, hard.     Another lesson:  No matter how attractive you are, perverted and overtly sexual comments made before comfort and trust have been established are always met with negativity.   Always.     Here's an example conversation:  Joy:  Wow, you're incredibly handsome.   My god, what are you doing on Tinder??  Me:  I'm just interesting in spreading some Joy.  :)  Joy:  ?  okay, creepy much?    However, relative to my normal profile, that would have been an instant unmatch -- but they'd just drop the conversation at that point.  Sometimes I'd get a message a day or two later, ""Hey, what's up?""  As if they'd forgotten that I was a creep.    Lessons learned:  Be confident.   Be aggressive but NOT overtly sexual at the onset.  Don't take bullshit, and take the high ground often.   Be direct in your intentions, but again, not overtly sexual.   ""I'm taking you out this Friday.""    the response is almost always ""oh really? :) not even asking?      Sure, why not.""        Relationships between men and women are a negotiation for power and control.   The presumption is that men wield the power, but women have control.  If you take control from the beginning, it works amazing wonders."
SocialEngineering,32lbj1,know_comment,-5,Wed Apr 15 13:30:32 2015 UTC,"You have to also take into account there is a learned behaviour afoot as well.  A lot of the better looking guys have learned that rather than spending time and effort uniquely tailoring and crafting a beautiful response they have to capitalise on how horny the gone wild poster is.  A 2% success rate is still a success rate for them.   So they show their goods and then wait for the girl who's interested to reply back.   There's the law of reciprocity at work as well because if the guise you have is off a gw poster the guy would have to be comfortable being naked too,  in order that they can mutually swap pics,  Skype and more.   There's a specific subreddit for Webcam advice for omegle and chatrandom and so on about how to seduce women on it.   The learned behaviour the guys demonstrate may be a successful low effort strategy for the alphas in the group. The value derived from the interaction is what gets them off. Not just the body.   Now here's the strange thing, losers may also adopt the same mindset as winners and as such either degrade the strategy (nudes4nudes) or entirely put off the person they're trying to connect with (thus fucking it up for all involved).   It's still not the same as approaching cold and if they're comfortable with the size of their cock they might think that's enough in lieu of any decent attempt at seduction."

You intentionally showed off sexual attributes.  If you were a muscle-bound guy in a skintight shirt, the response from girls would also be more sexualized.  Try it.  You get what you put out.  A picture of a gorgeous girl in a sweater without makeup is not going to get the same response as a picture of a girl in a low cut shirt with a ton of eye shadow.  These are visual cues that we tend to associate with what people are looking for.  If I post a picture of myself in short shorts, I can expect to get messaged by gay guys.  The ""i should be able to wear whatever I want"" attitude is ridiculous.  You're dealing with other people.  How you present yourself sends signals.  And did I miss it or did you not even post your picture here?  C'mon man, you catfished yourself around as someone else in this ""social experiment"", and you're not even going to provide the a citation of the most significant variable?  And you say multiple times that you felt dehumanized.  You are a PRETENDING to be someone you aren't on the internet, with a focus on sexuality.  Why would you expect to be treated like anything other than what you are?  I appreciate the sentiment, but this left a bad taste in my mouth.  I'm going to do a social experiment to see how homeless people are treated.  I'm going to stop shaving for a month, piss myself and walk around asking for money, then get mad when I get a bad reaction."

It was ridiculous, but a large part of kik's initial population was guys trying to get some more permanent contact with people they met on Omegle.  And it seemed to be almost strictly guys looking for a sexual outlet.  My point is that in your post, you kept saying what ""guys"" will do and how ""guys"" think.  The fact that you're a guy should show you what's wrong with talking about this clear subset of males like it's the entire population.  It takes a specific type of guy to think he will find success just hounding females and sending unsolicited dick pics.  Finally, where the hell did this come from?  ""They'll blame women and well, that's how /r/TheRedPill/ happened.""  Are you just saying that to get extra karma?

Here's my cleavage"" vs. posting that you want to chat about pokemon and college basketball or something. Obviously a guy posting either of those things will receive little attention, while a girl can post one of them and receive a LOT of the attention she's implicitly looking for, or post the other and probably receive some attention of varying intention."

How do you define a 'meaningful conversation'?  Talking about philosophy, art, history, science, or mathematics?  Or maybe current events and geopolitics?  You might be surprised to find that many TRP members have tried to hold 'meaningful' conversations with women they were interested in and found that it led nowhere sexually.  When the same members then began to speak less, lead more, work out and focus on their bodies, skills, interests, and hobbies, and be clear in their sexual intent, suddenly it was like a switch had been flipped in how girls responded.  I believe that TRPers are perfectly capable of holding meaningful conversations with women, as they are with men, but in the right contexts, and not when there is sexual interest."

It does bother me however, when people criticize something when they clearly have not spent much time or effort trying to understand that thing and coming to their own conclusions.    Personally, I simply found many TRP principles to work and to be effective empirically, particularly in dealing with women and in understanding sexual value.  There are certainly some fucked up members in the community, as there are in most polarizing communities.  I simply ignore them."
SocialEngineering,32lbj1,MauPow,5,Tue Apr 14 20:42:09 2015 UTC,"I think TRP's anger would be more productive if were directed at narcissists, psychopaths and dark triads in general, not just the female ones.   Abusive parents can cause their children to be blind to abusive behavior inflicted by their adult children's mates.   My mother was just like the quintessential entitled TRP boogywoman, she enslaved my father and I and abused us both for years but I'm not like my mother. When I was younger I was in some shitty relationships because any asshole treated me better then my mother. Dark triad personality types have a knack for spotting vulnerable people to target. If I was born a straight male to my mother, I'd probably have the same opinions about women as Elliot Rodger. I'm a woman and I've read a lot of posts on TRP and I know the monsters they're describing are real and I see how much pain they're in but their anger is misdirected at women in general instead of specific asshole women.   TRP, KiA, raisedbynarcissists, satanism, fatpeoplehate, gamerghazi, racism, howtonotgiveafuck, are all subreddits against the same dark triad personalities but they will never unite against their common enemy."

I made a post a while back explaining why high level social engineering can cause users to fall into the dark triad, and the self importance from narcissism and ego can convince the social engineer that these are positive attributes causing it all to self perpetuate, eventually leading them to become out of touch and unable to properly social engineer which causes anger and frustration. I have always been anti Redpill and anti dark triad because they encourage the echo chamber mentality. that is just in my experience."

If you can find out what they want, what their motivations are, wealth, power, reputation and so on, and encourage them that working with you, towards your ends will get them what they desire, most people will do it, because they think it benefits them. everyone will do what's in their own interest to do.

I distinctly remember a time when people would move awkwardly after I had said something, where people seemed disinterested in the topics of conversation i broached. I've told many jokes that were not funny, still do, but my margin of error is shrinking. Every time I make a mistake I learn another parameter of social interaction. I learn where the line is in general and how to predict individuals lines, to an extent.   You can ""learn by wrote"" but even if you do eventually you'll have to practice the techniques you learn in order to master them. Might as well get a jump on it. What's the worse that can happen?

The issue with ""practising"" is that I literally get a mind block when I ""run out"" of comfortable topics to talk/joke about. My mindset, even though it might be the downfall of me, is that I need to have a base that I can jump off of. So, let's say, I have a base thought of ""films"" for small talk, I'll go on about it for a bit until I exhaust the appropriate topics relating to films and/or jump to the next ""base"" topic.   This is the reason I'm asking for a book(ish) reference. I actually need to set a different kind of mindset when approaching conversations.

If they do happen to notice, they're not likely to care enough to make an issue out of it.  Most ticket takers would rather just wave your through than risk having the deal with the drama of you making a scene.  If the tickets are electronically verified, they're more likely to notice that the tickets are expired, but you can probably still get in.  Just show up and act as if you fully expect the tickets to work, and when they get denied, ask (in a civil manner) to speak to a manager.  Explain the exact truth of what happened, only leaving out the part where you realized that they were expired already.  Since you did pay for the tickets, they're likely to honor them by comping you new ones.

SocialEngineering,327d3c,uncovery,19,Sat Apr 11 05:28:05 2015 UTC,"Replace ""no"" with an impossible ""yes"" condition. I don't mean anything fancy; just something like ""not today"" or ""maybe another time"" does a lot of work.   If it's someone you care about maintaining a relationship with, make the ""no"" palatable almost every time by following up with ""but here's what I/we/you can do.""  Body language speaks louder than words. Turning your hips and feet away from the person signals them that they're not going to negotiate your ""no"" away. Conversely, if you stop and wait for them to allow you to feel okay about leaving, you're just signaling them to keep pressing.  Say something ridiculous. I knew a crazy guy who'd blurt out in the middle of another person's rant, ""What'd Scooby say?"" and the person would go, "".. What??"" and then he'd use that pause to say what he needed to regain control of the interaction.  If someone disses you and you don't have a witty/positive response, a personal favorite via Neil Strauss is to give them credit by looking at them, saying, ""Respect,"" and moving on/changing the topic like they didn't say anything. Alternatives there include ""touché"" and ""well played."""

SocialEngineering,327d3c,mistypixelfan,3,Sat Apr 11 05:51:14 2015 UTC,"The problem with short phrases is that the ones that have power tend to be rather brutal, which might be fine when dealing with annoying strangers that you can walk away from, but may not be ideal in other circumstances.  In situations where I don't care (e.g. door to door sales person) I basically just say ""sorry, no"" and then follow that up immediately with action/body language that says 'this conversation is over' (hanging up/closing the door/walking away etc).  I think it's less important what you say rather than how you say it - the key is not to allow a response from them, as this would put them back in control.  Where I'm trying to shut down a persistent person that I don't want to alienate, I'll use a similar tactic, but instead of forcibly ending the interaction - which is pretty unfriendly - I'll try to take control and redirect the conversation.  For instance, if a friend was trying to persuade me to go out, I might say,  ""no, sorry, I'm really not up for going out tonight, I'm exhausted.  But maybe we could see a movie tomorrow - I heard [movie name] is good, have you seen it?""  In dealing with angry people, I actually actively avoid short phrase responses, as they tend to be inflammatory.  I find it's important to keep my tone calm and respectful and my body language engaged but non-threatening, so where possible I'd stand at a slight angle/off to the side, and ensure that my body language communicated that I was fully present with them (so, for instance, I wouldn't have my arms crossed and be staring at the ceiling, or frown when they made a point I disagreed with.)  I'd empathize as much as possible and let them vent, but interrupt as needed to deescalate if they are working themselves into an angrier state.  Once the situation was appropriately deescalated - and not before - I'd take my turn to offer solutions or communicate the other side of the story.  Doing this too soon can come off as being defensive which tends to make people angrier."

Please don't.  IT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS!  I would advise anyone considering ""cash baiting"" to think again. Not only is it extremely dangerous for inexperienced scambaiters to try, but legally you are also skating on very thin ice. Whilst morally you may think you are giving the scammers exactly what they deserve, technically you are still obtaining money by false pretences, and whilst you may just get a slap on the wrist from law enforcement officials, the greater danger is from the scammers themselves.  It is stressed on this site a lot, but again, PLEASE remember that these people have been known to beat, torture, and in some cases even murder their victims. Although most of the scammers you may read about here seem to be bumbling fools, you certainly would not want to meet up with them in person. You may feel you are safe baiting a scammer many thousands of miles away from you in another country, but remember, even though they themselves may not be prepared to go to the time and expense of flying across continents to come and deal with you, they may well have relatives or contacts living much closer to home!  I implore newcomers to scambaiting to never lose sight of the main goal; to waste the scammer's time as much as possible, to mess with their minds, to make them jump through hoops. Of all my most favourite scambaits, not a single one of them involved extracting cash - or even a trophy picture - from the scammer. It is much more satisfying to drive a scammer mentally insane over a period of weeks or months than it is to spend a week or so convincing them to send you a bit of cash. None of my own cash only baits are remotely near any of my favourite baits in terms of overall satisfaction."

So listen with a smile (smile with your eyes and your mouth), nod occasionally, ask open ended questions. The more detail they go into, the more they believe you're paying attention. Stay away from dark topics.. Don't express very strong views or give your opinion on everything the other person says.. Wait for them to ask questions too.   If the conservation gets boring, here's some topics you can introduce: girls usually like talking about movies, travel, hopes/dreams etc. Guys like sports, gaming, books, TV shows etc. Food and music are great topics for both sexes.  Don't be too inquisitive, gauge how they're responding, and then build from there.  Look man, making friends is something that takes a little time and effort. But these tips will help you speak to people comfortably, which is half the battle.  Finally, the most important thing is to remain calm and relaxed. Just tell yourself you're going to have a good time, and you will. Don't overthink communication, do what comes naturally, because everyone has their own style of speaking/body language.

This way you won't have to worry about banal conversation or social norms and customs- you can focus on the thing both you and the others present are deeply interested in. Conversation and friendships will grow naturally and organically around the common interest, as long as you approach the entire situation with honesty and make a good faith effort to perfect the thing you are interested in or are skilled at. Focus on your interest and invite others into your interest and be kind if they are not as proficient yet, then the friends will come.   Also, never be afraid of awkward silences. It is not your responsibility to fill silence or voids in conversations. Instead, if you feel uncomfortable with silence then get back to focusing on the common interest that brought you together."

There will be times where you screw up and other people will likely not remember it a few minutes later. Accept that now and you'll have a much better time. The goal is have fun, not perfect interaction.  If you do make a friend who's good at being a ""social seeing eye dog"" then ask them to help you get better by pointing stuff out to you (in a few weeks of on-and-off interactions, like texting and hanging out a couple times. Not now.)"

Honestly, if you get people talking, and you listen to what they say, they'll love you.  So ask a lot of questions, listen to the answers and ask more!  To avoid creeping people out, start with really superficial things.  I find, ""What brings you here?"" is always good.    Asking about work can be dull - I sometimes say, ""If it isn't too boring or painful, what do you do?""    Asking people for advice is great, everyone loves to be an expert.  ""Can you recommend me music like [this]?""  ""I need a good book to read, what's your recommendation?""  ""I need something to watch on Netflix.""  Now, they're going to ask about you.  You want to tell them enough that they believe they know you better, not enough to bore them.  I'd go for one or two complete sentences per answer.  If you can make a (self-deprecating) joke, so much the better.  Nod while they're talking, and sometimes smile.  Smile while you're talking and sometimes nod.  Don't fake smiling, it's fine not to smile if you don't ""feel"" it.  Keep answering as long as they keep asking.  Don't clam up - asking questions means they are interested in you.  Volunteer a tiny bit more than they asked, but not too much.  If you are interested in people, really interested in them, then they'll be interested in you.    And people are super-interesting.  I'm a loud-mouth, a ""good conversationalist"", and yet often I manage to shut up for a bit and get strangers talking to me and I've learned so much that way.  Look for something in common.  I remember when I was in early high school - standing around with a bunch of cool kids who didn't really like me.  One of them mentioned a Zeppelin song and then said, ""But you probably don't know it.""  I said, ""I know that song really well, but it's not as good as [another Zeppelin] song, with this great guitar break.""  Ten minutes of chatting about Zeppelin and we're all on good terms.  None of them became my friend-friend, but I felt mutual respect.  Best of luck!  You can really do this.  I have friends who were hopeless Aspies in their 20s and now have a very satisfying social circle, friends, lovers, spouses."

Leon Shimkin of the publishing firm Simon & Schuster took one of the 14-week courses given by Carnegie in 1934.

SocialEngineering,31zts1,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:45:21 2015 UTC,"Making friends involves the other person liking you. But why would someone like you if they don't want to like you? You can listen to them blab all you want (like others have suggested), but why do they want you to hear what they have to say? Of course they'll be polite and hold a conversation with you, but what is going to make them want to keep that conversation going? What's going to make them be open to/interested in continuing talking to you even after the night ends?   You have to get the interest of these people and you have to do so by showing them that you can be valuable to them. I very basic example of this is if you're a millionaire and you tell people that, people will definitely be interested in talking to you and finding out about you. Of course, many would just be interested for the money in that scenario, but it gives you the opportunity to see what they like, what their interests are, and (if you like them) to emphasize the parts of your personality that are compatible with them.   There are a ton of things that you can tell others about yourself that can attract their interest.  It doesn't have to be money. Talk about your interests and the things you do, whether it's your job or hobbies. But make sure you present positive things, things that make you look good and like you have your life under control! An example would be that you have a job which you really enjoy and that pays decently. But don't brag, instead emphasize how you feel about it, what you enjoy about it and so on. Try to find people who have the same interests as you and appeal to them with whatever you have about yourself.   Don't fixate on any one person and don't try too hard. It's important that it feels natural. You have to be cool, collected, and above all confident! I know it's hard and I would say don't try to push yourself too hard because if you're lacking confidence at that point, it will certainly show.   Overall, try to get others to be interested in you by showing them that you are a valuable person and someone they can gain from. They could gain entertainment if you're funny, important lessons if you're similar but you have different experiences, they could gain valuable input from someone who's been through more challenges or different challenges. They could gain someone who's just fun to hang out with, or someone with whom they can discuss their passions and interests like gaming or music or art.   TL:DR; Bring value to the table and be polite and listen to others, but you have to gain the other person's interest or this isn't going anywhere."
SocialEngineering,31zts1,DidoAmerikaneca,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:45:59 2015 UTC,"Shared interests  Don't dominate the conversation  Ask them a lot of questions about their passions  At first if you are unsure, it's probably best to try for a more neutral mood - don't try to be too high energy or low key because you'll exaggerate your quirks.  Also, I think the real key to forming friendships is seeing people on a regular (near weekly) basis.  That's how you bond."
SocialEngineering,31zts1,reduser80,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:57:39 2015 UTC,I've found the best/easiest thing to do is smile a lot and contribute to conversation where you can at least seem interested and generally stay positive.

SocialEngineering,31w760,DepthHug,42,Wed Apr 8 17:13:15 2015 UTC,"Eminmen says, “There ain’t no such thing as”… and the audience chants with him because they know exactly what he is quoting from “Halfway Crooks!” a line from a song by Mobb Deep (I did their website back in 1998), another huge East Coast rap group. So now Eminem has established lineage between himself and both the West Coast and the East Coast.   The instrumental he's rapping over is Shook Ones (pt II) by Mobb Deep.  The line ""ain’t no such thing as halfway crooks"" is in the hook of the song.  That's why everyone knows it."

SocialEngineering,31w760,fidelitypdx,14,Thu Apr 9 00:46:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree with one part though:   This is a direct line from Snoop Doggy Dogg’s first song with Dr. Dre, “Ain’t Nothin But a G Thing.” It is the first line in the song and perhaps one of the most well-known rap lines ever.  Eminem directly associates himself with well-known successful rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop when he uses that line.  He then uses Availability Cascade again by saying, “one Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four.” First, he’s using that one, two, three, and to the four again but this time with Pac, which refers to the rapper Tupac. So now he’s associated himself in this little battle in Detroit with three of the greatest rappers ever.  Eminem points to random people in the audience and says “You’re Pac, He’s Pac,” including them with himself in associating their lineages with these great rappers.  But then he points to his opponent, Papa Doc, makes a gesture like his head is being sliced off and says, “You’re Pac, NONE”. Meaning that Papa Doc has no lineage, no credibility, unlike Eminem and the audience.   My understanding of this scene is nothing like that. He’s calling out Papa Doc’s team as being repeats of generic rappers, “You rap like Tupac, you rap like Tupac, and you rap like Tupac, but Papa Doc barely raps at all.”  Borrowing lines from Snoop Dog doesn’t lend him any credibility, I mean, everyone and anyone could recite those words. Was his credibility based upon, “Hey look guys, I know lines of extremely successful and popular songs out of LA too.”  I also thought this was a weak point too:   In a rap battle, (or a sales pitch), if you address everything your opponent can say, he’s left with nothing to say.  When he has nothing to say, the audience, or the sales prospect, your date, your kids, whoever, will buy from you or listen to what you have to say.   That's not how sales works. You try to answer your prospects objections, not highlight them to scrutinize. If one wanted to compare this to a sales pitch - it's Eminem talking directly to his client about Eminem's competition saying, ""This is what my competitors will say, and it's true, I'm transparent about mistakes in the past, but we are still a better option."" It's a technique called disarming. The theory is that it's better if you tell mom your broke the cookie jar than your brother telling your mom.   There's probably more I could knit pick, but meh.

He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake.  He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $1.5 Million US Dollars Moreover, Barrister George Alex, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email address as one of the beneficiaries, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you.

As soon as you contact him he will send you the payment information which you are to use in sending the payment to him in order for him to obtain the document from the court of law there in Nigeria so that your fund can be transfer to you without any delay just the way mine was being transfer to me.  Send him the following details if you know you are ready to have your FUNDS so that as soon as he receive your information he will send to you the payment details for sending him the $570USD that is needed for him to get the document that is needed to make the transfer a successful one and that is that only payment i made to Barrister George Alex and he help me in the transferring of my FUNDS and i most say that you have to contact him so that he will help you the way he help me to Get my FUNDS without any further payment.

About five years ago I found out what SE was.  I read a few books including Art of Human Hacking, Influence (Cialdini), Games People Play (not really SE, but still sort of interesting), What Every Body Is Saying, Lie Spotting, 48 Laws of Power, You Are Not So Smart, The Demon-Haunted World (Carl Sagan)...a few more that I can't recall right now.  Some of these books aren't SE at all, but they were useful.  It's an interesting subject, and it can obviously be used for nefarious purposes, but I don't have it in me to take advantage of people on a level that is immoral...however, I think things like free coffee for example (in the way I got it) only hurts corporations and I don't really feel any moral qualms with that.  So, the coffee example happened on an airplane where they charged $2 for a cup of fucking coffee.  I used the study from Influence that demonstrated using the word ""because"" makes it 77% (or whatever) more likely that you'll get what you want.  The example in that book is cutting in line to get a copy from a xerox machine in a long line.  You probably know what I'm talking about since you read that.    Anyway, I got my coffee by saying to the stewardess, ""can I have a free coffee because I don't have $2,"" and it worked.  That trick works all the time.  In fact, I was playing blackjack in a casino about two weeks ago and I had lost my last $25 dollar chip at a $25 minimum blackjack table (the $25 table has double-deck blackjack instead of six-deck blackjack, which increases the odds that I win...unfortunately it wasn't my night).  The guy at first base (the position all the way to the right at the table) had just gotten $1,000 of chips.  After I lost I asked him, ""can I have a black chip ($100), because I lost all my money!""  He gave me one.  I lost it, too.  It was a bad shoe.  But he was super nice, and we had a good time so it was okay.  It's things like that which make SE fun, relatively harmless, and totally hilarious.  That's the way it should be used.  Another way I use it is for work...sort of.  When I work, I dress to the nines.  I wear a tie, a jacket, and nice shoes.  Most people who do my job don't dress as nice because it's not required.  But I've found that when I dress well, I demonstrate more authority than others and I get my job done faster that way because people subconsciously (I think) respond to a man in a tie and jacket more than they do someone with a polo and khakis.    SE has helped me to a large extent, but I think understanding human psychology is really the ticket.  Read up on Pavlov.  Read up on Charlie Munger's approach to business - Start here on the Charlie stuff...the way Charlie suggests a person learns about business and investing is useful in a much broader context.  SE is a great tool, but learning about human psychology and other ""worldly wisdom"" as Charlie puts it will get you even further.    And read voraciously.  But make sure they're the right books.  Start with text books if you have the discipline.  iTunes U is another great resource if you prefer audio learning.  I spend a lot of time in my car for work, so I absorb podcasts and iTunes U courses every single weekday.    Let me know if you want a list of the resources I've found useful.  And enjoy yourself!"
SocialEngineering,31ldkj,bmxtreme32,2,Tue Apr 7 04:58:16 2015 UTC,"Looks like we have read similar materials. I have read a couple of body language books including the one you mentioned I'm a keen body language observer. Than I thought body language wasn't enough to know if someone was lying there is more to it, than I read a couple of lie catching books including the one you mentioned. Now I will start reading about SE, will start with 48 laws of power and art of human hacking. I liked your coffee trick, maybe I will use that for the cheap headphones that they charge at planes. And I think you were lucky with the blackjack one, I wouldn't have the guts to ask to someone for it so kudos for that but I feel like the answer would be almost always no, the guy was too nice I think. Or maybe I don't have confidence to ask for 100 dollars haha, seems like it can backfire in too many ways. I will read the charlie stuff, thanks for that. I have only been studying maybe for like a year, I have theory knowledge but don't really have the confidence to use it. I don't think I could even ask for a free coffee. So thats my main weakness which I intend to work on it but don't really know what to do, maybe I will try to start with small manipulations. I would like the list of useful resources that you used, thanks for that and thank you for your long reply."
SocialEngineering,31ldkj,curtains,2,Tue Apr 7 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"As far as body language goes - there's a lot of research to suggest that it is not a good indicator of deception.  The best way to determine if someone is lying is to ask the right questions (which is also hard to do); the body language portion of it is pretty miniscule if you believe the scientific research.  My opinion is that the research is probably correct...after all, it's science.  But I wonder if the specifics of the various research tests were not robust.  For example, maybe they weren't studying people who were good body language interpreters.  I haven't looked at it closely.  But I have devised my own test for detecting deception, and I think I'm pretty good at it after reading What Every Body is Saying!    I could go on and on about body language - the different types and their robustness - if you like.  But for now I'll leave it at that.  I think 48 Laws of Power was an interesting book.  I've read it twice now.  If anything, it's a good history lesson.  Every ""law"" is demonstrated by a few lessons from history.  But as far as the laws of power being used in modern society, I haven't had too much experience with them.  Nevertheless, I think you should read the book - not to become a powerful asshole, but to protect yourself from them (if, in fact, they exist).  Just read the book with a skeptical eye.    Art of Human Hacking by Chris Hadnagy is interesting, but a lot of the applications of the book happen in the context of technology.  It's still worth a read even if you aren't a penetration tester (odds are you aren't), but it's not some bible of SE.    It seems that you're a more of an introvert than me.  I don't think that's a bad thing.  In fact, I've tried to be a bit more closed up than I've been in the past!  But if you don't have the confidence to be a bit forthright, I think you should endeavor to be.  I can't recommend strongly enough that you forget about 48 Laws and Art of Human Hacking and go straight to How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.  No other book will help you gain the confidence you seem to want.  My copy is worn from so much use.  I can't recommend it enough.  It's an older book, but the concepts hold up.  You've got to practice the ideas in that book, and you've got to have the guts to talk to people.  Just keep in mind that it doesn't matter what people think about you, because people are too busy thinking about themselves to give you much thought.    Here's an example of how that book helped me:  I had a room mate once who was super embarrassed for me because I asked a girl out who denied me.  He was with me when I went up to her, made some small talk, and asked her on a date right in front of him (she and I weren't complete strangers).  She flat out said no.  As we were walking home, he was red-faced and couldn't believe what I had done.  I'll admit I felt embarrassed, too.  No one likes being denied by a woman.  But the way I rationalized it (and you should do this too) was to think about the worst case scenario.  The worst thing that could have happened - in fact it may have as far as I know, but I doubt it - would have been if the girl I asked out went home after denying me, called all her friends, got on myspace (this was in 2007), and told everyone she knew that I had the balls to ask her out and that I was a complete loser for thinking I had a shot with her.  But there's very little reason she would have done that unless she was a complete dick and a head case.  If anything, perhaps I gave her a confidence boost by asking her out!  Approaching people and asking for things can seem scary, until you realize no one cares except you.  And once you stop caring, you can ask anyone anything.  And if you do it right, you might get it.  (By the way, the same room mate was with me when I asked the next girl out.  She said yes, and now we're married.)  Start with How to Win Friends, and throw 48 Laws and Art of Human Hacking in there somewhere.  Make sure you read the Charlie Munger speech, especially if you are interested in business/investing but even if you aren't.  Other than that, here's some resources I've found useful.  I'm not going to provide a description, because that will take too long.  You can look them up on your own time!  These are in no particular order:  Useful Books   Thank You for Arguing by Jay Heinrichs You Are Not So Smart by Dave McRaney Complete Book of Etiquette by Amy Vanderbilt How to Be a Gentleman by John Bridges Propaganda by Edward Bernays Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (Hays translation) Seeking Wisdom from Darwin to Munger by Peter Bevelin Art of War by Sun Tzu The Prince by Machiavelli Six Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman  The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb Agnotology by Robert Proctor Self-Reliance by Ralph Waldo Emerson Brain Rules by John Medina The Autobiography of Malcolm X Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely Language Intelligence by Joseph Romm A Guide to the Good Life by Wiliam Irvine The 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss   Useful Subjects   Human psychology The human brain Stoicism Etiquette Physics Magic (sleight of hand) Rhetoric Skepticism/rationality Economics   Podcasts   Art of Manliness The Art of Charm (a bit douchey, but still sometimes good) Brain Science Podcast Dan Carlin's Hardcore History Dan Carlin's Common Sense EconTalk History of Philosophy (no gaps) Listen to Genius Point of Inquiry Radiolab The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe Skeptoid The Social-Engineer podcast Tank Riot The Tim Ferriss Show You are Not So Smart   iTunes U   Khan Academy - anything by them, but Banking and Money was really good Introduction to Psychology from MIT All the psychology courses from Berkeley Rhetoric 10 from Berkeley   There's a lot more on iTunes U that I had on my old computer, but I don't have it anymore.  Just look up some of the hard sciences and psychology, but make sure you don't watch anything from Liberty University or any of those charlatan schools.  Always google the school that's putting out the course!!  Good luck!  Don't forget to practice talking to people!"

I can talk to people so I'm not in a really really bad shape but I would say I have a lot of confidence to gain. I will read how to win friends then, I have also heard a lot about it, then I will read the rest. those look like amazing resources, I will check all of them out thank you. I can read and study a lot but without real life experience its all worthless so I need to get onto that. I will join a public speaking club to enchance my abilities and will start going to flea markets and try to negotiate on prices. At least it will be appropriate to the context so I can feel safer. you are right actually people care/think more about themselves then they care about others. but still, I have anxiety, I have had social phobia. social phobia is really reduced now I have worked a lot on that and anxiety part is still there. so even if I keep telling myself ""nobody cares or whats the worst that could have happened"" for a million times, my stomach will keep having that weird feeling after weeks maybe. I kinda don't care anymore about anxiety, I keep ignoring it but still annoying. I read that anxiety is a learned behaviour so I'm trying to unlearn it. thank you very much for your time, really appreciate your resources and your opinions :)"
SocialEngineering,31ldkj,curtains,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about what you must experience with regard to anxiety and social phobia.  I have a few friends who have gotten panic attacks in public, but I just don't understand how it must feel.  I'm sorry you have those ailments, but at least they're simply learned behaviors.  I would guess you've had some bad influences in your past, especially during your childhood years and perhaps your adolescence.  That's extremely sad, if it's true.  Thankfully, your brain's neural pathways are still flexible.  You can rewire your brain, and change your social phobia and anxiety, but you are absolutely right that you have to work on it.  A lot.    You could make a SE game out of it!  Get How to Win Friends as soon as possible, and then start small but as you read it put the concepts from each chapter into practice in the real world.  You will be shocked, I hope, how easy it is to make people like you; and hopefully that will help your mind heal.  My thinking is that since you're interested in SE, if you do this idea under the guise of SE, perhaps that will ease the tension you might feel speaking to people in public.    Anyway, just an idea.  Good luck!  Maybe check out Brain Rules by John Medina - or go to www.brainrules.net if you want to see videos about the book instead.

You conduct your own matters in a different way. Social experiments, every personal interaction like say portraying false information about yourself/playing a role, learning how to better guard against people like you etc.  You're far from God and you won't be able to ""do/get whatever you want"" but it changes things pretty drastically."

Once I realized the cause of people generally not liking, trusting and respecting me, I started looking at what successful people do and implementing it in my behavior with some success, but not very much, as I didn't fully understand the reason and strategy behind their actions. As I got a little better, I began to make friends with people who had knowledge of psychology, human behavior and were pretty successful socially themselves. In parallel to this, I began reading all kinds of materials regarding this matter(didn't hear about the term ""social engineering"" until recently) and putting everything(legally possible) to the test. If you want practice, you are on the right track, try to practice with your friends and family and make all techniques non harmful and make it a point to analyze and disect every social encounter that you don't have an explanation for.Remember to read many books, find what is wrote there in actual social situations and never settle just for what one opinion, see as many as you can and make your own opinion. If you dedicate some time of every day to this, you should see huge gains in influence at first and you'll begin to understand how social dynamics are related to each other. Regarding body language and voice, these too are a bit tricky because you need to make sure that what you think your body language is expressing and how your voice sounds like is the same as what others see and hear."

SocialEngineering,31baum,Gimme_The_Loot,2,Fri Apr 3 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of social engineering involves selecting the right targets, this is one of those cases. Knowing the reasons any random person might have for not wanting a call will help you anticipate when they wouldn't mind or would even like to receive a call.   Determining a good time to call, depends on examining the person you're calling. If the time is right for them, then it's a good time. This takes paying attention to them, their wants, needs and schedules.   Plenty of younger people really shun using phones for talking, if you must use a phone, your best targets are over the age of 65, you can call them anytime they're awake.  Frankly anyone who just ""likes to talk"" on the phone, is cut out of my life pretty fast, and I renew my phone sporadically to see who gets angry about that, and when I get accused of ignoring their calls, they get their number blocked, I've no time for narcissists and it's a pretty handy way to tell who's a real friend and who's needy dead weight. Contrary to the people I've encountered, it's not illegal to not have a phone in the United States, but I've been treated like I've committed some sort of felony by crazy people for not answering or telling them I don't have a phone.  If you must talk to younger people using a phone, make sure to confirm that they actually enjoy using a phone. Friendships aren't rekindled over the phone, they're rekindled in person after coordinating a meet up using the phone.   Always let people go as soon as they seem like their attention is divided, and people won't grow to hate or fear your calls. Calling for no reason, doesn't increase likability nor does calling about a manufactured crisis. If you're a phone person and your buddy isn't and you keep trying to force your buddy into becoming a phone person, he won't want to be your buddy anymore since you're not accepting him for who he is, a phone disliker. If your buddy is a phone lover then you're all set.   Feel free to AMA about why I hate using phones, my reasons are various.   tl;dr anytime is fine as long as you're already known to be respectful to the phone loving person you call."

If they let you walk, they're either terrible at their job or they were already at the absolute best they could do. Either way, they'll be calling you soon.   Fourth, if they do bring out the manager to negotiate, check the name tag. You're looking for either the Used Car Manager or the General Sales Manager. Anybody else is either a desk manager or a floor manager. In either case, they're literally just a closer. Edit to include:the General Manager or Managing Partner would also be acceptable.   Fifth (this is golden), try not to buy anything in the finance office other than gap insurance and extended warranty. Most stores sell shit like life insurance and tire warranties and they're worth slightly more than the paper they're printed on and that's only because ink costs money too.   Hopefully, I've been helpful."
SocialEngineering,318te6,dubbya,11,Fri Apr 3 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"There are way better articles out there, but, use Edmunds TMV and not KBB.  It's a much better metric.  I generally aim for a price between 'average' and 'clean' for most used vehicles assuming they are in decent condition.    In this particular case, a 2012 challenger R/T (8cylinder) with 36k on it, from a private party should go for $19k or so.  Around $20,500 from a dealer.  $24k is ridiculous, even from a dealer if this is an R/T.  If this is an SRT, it looks like you should be paying around $27.6k privately or $29.3k from a dealer.    If using a dealer, I'd simply just say you are looking at a similar car at another dealer.  Having alternatives always puts you in power.   Finally, strongly consider your car choice.  Muscle cars are fun, but Dodge is notorious for some of the lowest reliability and resale values in the industry."
SocialEngineering,318te6,reduser80,7,Thu Apr 2 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"This depends entirley on where OP lives. I can't find a single R/T in my area for under $25K, and if it was a fully loaded 2012 R/T I wouldn't even be surprised to see it pushing $30K around here.  I find that just looking around at used car prices the KBB is typically more representative of what's actually on the market.  Also, we are talking about a 2012 Challenger here. There has been no notable reliability issues with those cars and most issues with Chrysler vehicles in general were resolved by the 2011 model year. This whole thing with Chrysler being notoriously unreliable has simply been untrue the past few years. Plus the whole poor resale value thing is looking to he false too, I'm seeing plenty of R/Ts from 2010-2014 being sold in the $30K-$35K range locally, considering the base price for a 2015 R/T is around $35K and fully loaded they get to be just a little over $40K that's actually pretty good resale value if you ask me.  Also, it's not like there are many options in the market. Camaro and Mustang are vastly different cars than the Challenger."
SocialEngineering,318te6,backwoodsofcanada,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:13:48 2015 UTC,You consider the camaro and mustang vastly different?  Why's that?  All pretty much just bulky muscle cars with big v8's.
SocialEngineering,318te6,reduser80,2,Fri Apr 3 14:19:44 2015 UTC,"The Camaro and Mustang are both significantly lighter and smaller than the Challenger. The Challenger can seat 5 and actually has a usable rear seat, the Mustang and Camaro are both 2+2 and the rear seats are so small that basically only children or adults with no legs could sit in the back for any length of time. The Challengers suspension and ride, along with the kind of seats they use, are much more comfortable and more suitable for long distance drives. The trunk capacity in the Challenger is significantly larger than either the Camaro or Mustang. The list really goes on and on. You can comfortably sit 4 adults and a child in a Challenger, fill your trunk up with a bunch of suitcases, and go on a big road trip... that's something you would find much more difficulty doing with a Mustang or Camaro. If OP plans on using it as a daily driver or thinks he'll be frequently driving with multiple passengers, the Challenger Is his best bet.  Then there's the overall car, the idea behind the car. Now we are moving away from factual stuff a little bit, into the realm of generally agreed upon opinions and whatnot in the community. Many say that the current (2008-) Dodge Challenger is the last true muscle car. The Challenger is all about burnouts and drag racing and cruising down the highway at double the speed limit, the Challenger is about personality and style and making a statement about who you are (or who you want to be). The Mustang and Camaro are different, they've changed over the past few years. They're light(ish) small(ish) and surprisingly nimble. They're creeping out of the muscle car territory and into what most would call a sports car. They make some tradeoffs and sacrifices, but they're also great handling cars, they are true drivers cars. The (previous generation) Mustang GT base could tie an E90 M3 around a race track, the Camaro SS was even faster than the GT, and then you have things like the GT Track Pack and SS 1LE, and then the monsters we call the Boss 302 and the absolutely insane Z/28. Those cars still have their own style and personality, but they're really different than the Challenger.   Take a Challenger to a racetrack and it's going to be rolling thunder, lots of sideways action, huge plumes of white tire smoke, it would honestly be a very messy affair... take a Camaro SS 1LE around a track, it would be very precise, it would grip and dive into corners and likely be way faster than the Challenger... but which one is more entertaining? The hectic and violent display of power and gluttony that is the Challenger, or the precise and calculated maneuvers of the Camaro? That's going to depend and vary greatly from person to person. The Camaro and Mustang are like finely crafted swords when it comes to performance driving, the Challenger is like a sledgehammer that was left soaking in gasoline and lit on fire before being carried into battle, totally unreasonable in a fight (race) and is going to get cut down by the sword men pretty quick, but that's only if the sword fighters don't shit themselves out of pure fear and awe first.  The Challenger is a hugely different car than the Mustang or Camaro and I am just scratching the surface here, I could go on for hours about this.  TL; DR the Challenger is a V8 coupe that retains the classic muscle car philosophy and could be reasonably used in place of your average mid to full size sedan, given the size of the vehicle. The Camaro and Mustang are both much smaller and lighter and are better suited to a sports car application liken carving a twisty road than they would be for extended trips."

SocialEngineering,318te6,SicilSlovak,6,Fri Apr 3 00:12:46 2015 UTC,"First, do your research on prices, then be willing to eat a few hours negotiating. It sucks, but it'll save you thousands.  I could do a much more detailed breakdown, but many people will tell you all the basics, here, however, is the key to getting them to drop that last $1K off, even after they claim that they can't go lower.  Are you paying cash or financing?  If financing, do you already have an offer quote from your bank or a credit union? If not, do that first. It gives you a lot of leverage.  Tell them you already have the cash/loan offer, but you're willing to consider financing through them if they can help you out on the price. Dealers make a lot of money on financing, so if they think they're getting money there, they'll be more willing to drop the price up front, expecting to make it back in financing.  Get them to agree to what that ""help you out"" price is. They'll put it on what is called the ""pencil sheet."" It's where the price is listed, and they ask you to sign. It doesn't bind you to buying the car, sign it. This now obligates the dealership to sell you that car at that price (they can't increase the price or tack on any new fees, this is it).  At this point they will have their finance officer walk in and congratulate you, and begin to discuss loans. This is also when you tell them they will have to beat X% APR for you to finance with them. At this point they know they're screwed because they're not making the money on the sale, and they're not making as much money on the loan interest. Because of this they'll be willing to do almost any APR just to get some money.  But if you have cash just say ""I've decided to pay in cash."" You are free to do this as you're not obligated to finance through them. Remember you said you'd consider financing through them if they dropped the price past what they said was possible.  I used this tactic to drop the price of my car, which I had already negotiated down several thousand under true market value, an additional $750, and get an APR of 0.99%."
SocialEngineering,318te6,proROKexpat,4,Fri Apr 3 01:05:32 2015 UTC,If you get a dealer to repaint a car you are a god among men.  I'm in car sales. I wouldn't even consider your offer.
SocialEngineering,318te6,jojowasher,5,Fri Apr 3 07:53:51 2015 UTC,"ALWAYS keep in mind there are other cars out there, this one may be just what you are looking for, but there are going to be others, and don't mention that this car is exactly what you are looking for, then they know they have you, start off by saying things like, well, its not my favorite color, I wish it had a sunroof, stuff like that.  Lay down your bottom line, give them your contact details, then leave, tell them you will let them think about it, guaranteed they will contact you again to give you a counter offer.  Don't take your turn - this is a hard one, but when negotiating, dont participate in the normal back and forth haggling, when they tell you what they can do, just say no, don't counter, but instead bring up something negative about the car, or maybe mention another car you looked at yesterday, lack of sunroof, etc."
SocialEngineering,318te6,ryanadanderson,4,Fri Apr 3 00:03:18 2015 UTC,"Best way to buy a car, for males and females alike.  1) Do your research online first. Find a couple of cars in your price range with the features you want that you might be interested in.  2) Visit nearby dealerships for test drives. Do not waste the salesperson's time, but do get their cards.  3) Decide upon which car you are going to pursue with which options.  4) Visit several dealerships which have the car in stock (this works best in major metropolitan areas, obviously).  5) At the dealership you went to for the test drive, ask for the salesperson who took you out. At other dealerships, any salesperson will do.  6) Let the salesperson know the car you are interested in and the options. Ask him (usually a him) for ""the best out the door price including tax, title, and license that you can give me."" Tell them that you will be applying for financing as well, but will not require any optional insurance. Car, options, tax, title, license, financing...nothing else. Whatever price he gives you, say, ""Okay then, thank you very much, I will be in touch.""  7) At this, the salesperson will likely look at you as if you just bitchslapped his 90-year-old grandmother with a socket wrench. Calmly explain that you asked for the best price they can offer, you received the price, and now you are going to shop around. If their dealership has the best price, you will come back to make the purchase from them.  8) They are going to want to haggle with you. They will want to play Numberwang with you. They want you confused, because, if you are confused and they exude confidence, you are likely to feel like YOU are the fool for not understanding what they are talking about and will be more likely to go along with whatever they say, which I assure you will cost you more of your hard-earned dollars than you'd care to pay.  9) DO NOT HAGGLE. ""Out-the-door price on the car, options, TT&L."" NOTHING ELSE.  10) When the salesperson hears that you will be visiting other dealerships, he will probably say something along the lines of, ""You know, whatever XYZ dealership offers to sell this car to you for, we will beat it."" This is probably true, because these guys want to make the sale. They'd prefer to make a fat commission off of you as well, but you will make it clear in your conversation with him that this will probably not happen. Nonetheless, he will still want to make the sale to make something...he just doesn't want you to waste his time.  11) However, you will not play the ""We'll beat their price"" game either. You let him know that you understand that he is trying to make a sale and keep his livelihood like the rest of us, and that you promise to keep his price in the strictest confidence, that you will not divulge it to any salespeople from any other dealerships. You just want the best price you can get from each dealership, and you will choose the best deal. No muss, no fuss, no wasting anyone's time, no haggling, just get it done.  12) Hopefully, the salesperson will recognize that he isn't going to make a fat profit off of you, but that, if he gives you a good enough deal (obviously with a little commission for himself), that he just might make the sale anyway with minimal hassle. If this occurs, he will hopefully come back with a better price for you.  13) Thank him for his time, get his card, tell him you will be in touch.  14) Repeat at XYZ Dealership (and all the rest).  15) When you are done, you will have the lowest price on the vehicle of your choice.  16) Call back the dealership with the best price, and make sure that your salesperson is available. Go in and meet him to finalize the sale.  17) If the quoted price changes in any way, remind him that the quoted price was supposed to be all-inclusive. If he doesn't back down to the agreed upon price: stand up, walk the fuck out, and go to the next dealership down the list.  18) When you make it to financing, just get financing on the car. NOTHING ELSE. No Gap insurance, no nada. Just the fucking car.  19) Here's where it gets a tad shady. The next day, go to a local credit union, and start the process of setting up financing on the car through them (stick with me here...). You have a few days ( at least here in Texas…might check with credit union where you live first) to change your mind about where you get financing. You will get much better financing from the credit union. Tell them you already got financing from the dealership, but want financing through them instead. They will contact the dealership and ask them to tear up the paperwork you signed there. The dealership will not be happy about this, but fuck ‘em…they made a sale.  20) The reason you did it this way is to make sure they give you truly the best price they can on the car. They will expect to make up some of the money they didn’t make playing number games with you by getting you financed through their bank which will have a higher annual percentage rate (APR). After getting financed, you have finalized the sale. The price of the car is now locked in. When you go to a credit union for a lower APR, the dealership cannot at that point raise the price of the car you have already purchased and driven off of their lot.  My dad clued me in to this way of buying cars, and it has worked for me. Think about it…you don’t buy cereal by haggling with the lady at the customer service desk at the grocery store, do you? No, you see the out-the-door price, and, if it is cheaper across the street, you will probably go across the street. Why should it be any different with cars?  TL;DR – How to get a good, fair deal on a car with minimal commission doled out, no hassle, no high pressure salespeople, with good financing, and with you always in control.  Edit: Some salespeople have commented that this will not get you the best deal you can get on a car. I never said that this would get you the best deal. I said it would get you a fair deal without having to play games. I fucking hate salesperson games.

A town hall in the metro I live in has two officers at each desk and they will badge you when you come in claiming to be an authorized user - all visitors are badged and recorded at the desk.   The alphabet soup buildings are generally - so long as they are publicly known - the easiest to get into either legitimately or illegitimately.   Legit you can simply get a job as a contractor working for a laundry, janitorial services, or waste removal company and work your way in there although there will be logs of where you are supposed to be and what you are supposed to be doing.   Illegitimately generally tends to be illegally and since there is a rule here about that I would suggest not doing it. However if you are doing penetration testing there are ways, but the 'ole clipboard and ""sorry need to get through"" will land you in a detention cell."

Help the people who seem alone, whether striking up a conversation with them or introducing them to other people. If there's something interesting, point it out to other people. If things look slow, get them moving. Start up a game or an icebreaker. Pretty much act like you're damn near hosting the event and look to make other people more comfortable/ get them having more fun.  This does several things. Obviously, it shoots your social proof through the roof. Also, by taking your mind off yourself, it changes your perspective tremendously.  Try it one time and see if I'm wrong."

SocialEngineering,30mrmu,abqnm666,3,Sun Mar 29 15:45:56 2015 UTC,"It's probably not common, but an example of escaping UNlawful custody would be the reason why you ask cops ""Am i being detained"" ""Am I free to go"", ""what crime am i being charged with"", etc. If a cop stops you walking down the street and tries to arrest you for not showing ID, you can legally walk (or run) away if you know that they have no justification for holding you.   You'll still need a decent lawyer to fight the charge but it's totally possible. My lawyer once got charges dropped (on appeal) on someone who had ran when police asked for his ID because he knew he had a warrant but the police where not stoping him because of the warrant and had no legal reason to demand his ID (which he knew would lead to being arrested)."
SocialEngineering,30mrmu,evilgold,2,Wed Apr 1 14:30:15 2015 UTC,"Lawful or unlawful, the police would be still charging you with escaping lawful custody.

Basically, day one is your day to find out as much as possible about the people you will be working with, because open interest will be expected and welcomed more than on other days.

SocialEngineering,30kti6,harkrank,2,Sun Apr 5 21:17:55 2015 UTC,"Well,  the woman who seem to dislike me are one of two people,  they are older than me,  like rules to be followed and a professional office at all times. The others in the teams are brusting to have some fun but too scared to. Then I come along,  confident (acting,  not real,  at heart I am quite an emotional person but try not to let that show in an office environment.) anyway,  they seem to follow my lead and the head honcho does not like this. I am instantly on the bad list,  even if I do my job well and deliver on time. The most recent complaint was I had spent too much time on another level. My job involves building relationships so I am required to go to people rather than flick them an email,  I had been to that level twice in three weeks for a matter of ten mins at a time all work related,  so I suspect just seeing me was enough to set her claws in and find a reason to make a complaint. I avoid these people as much as possible,  do over and above the work I am assigned to try and stay out of their war parth but it seems no matter what once I am disliked that's it. Now,  I will let you in on a little secret,  one day she let her guard down and told me I was just like her. I feel that perhaps the ones who do not like me feel that I am out to get them or want to take away from what they have. Which is not the case,  I actually just want to do my work without feeling like I'm in jail and then leave for the day. But clearly I come across wrong. So the other type that seem to dislike me are the ones who are exactly like me,  they feel that I will threaten their role in the team (and I don't mean job,  I mean the hierarchy they have established. If they gave me a chance they would realise I am quite happy to sit back and let them take that role,  I do not particularly want it, but I also can't just sit there when no ones offering solutions so nothing getting done. So I speak up,  get a conversation going and put options on the table. I suspect just my being there annoys these people. They can't understand why other people like me when I often create more work etc but it's work that leads to a better future for all of us. They seem bitter. I see a lot of myself in them as I have to work very very hard to remain positive while at work and not become bitter. I try to leave my rants etc for when I get home so I don't push buttons. Something I have learnt recently that works in my favour is to ask these people for advise (even if I already know the answer) it makes it appear as though I think highly of them and really respect their opinion. It has been working well but it's just a beginning so I'm working on being less uh vibrant? Around the office,  stirring up less work and just watching at the moment to try and not cause trouble. Egos are heard to work with and work out. So I'm trying not to make the mistake in this job by guessing who people are and how they work,  instead I am sitting,  watching and learning right now. .  I'm not rushing anything."

Don't spend too much headspace worrying about Stockholm syndrome; you're clearly self-possessed and able to think lucidly about the situation.  Yes, there are doubtless ways to change her dynamic with you, though (1) this will be difficult; people very rarely change their habits of interaction, particularly with their subordinates and (2) I think we'd need to understand her motivations (she has a crush on you and is presenting it abusively? she's just enjoying seeing you squirm?) a lot better to be able to provide specific suggestions about how to do this.  I'm going to recommend the more mundane approach of (1) continuing to document her weirdest behaviors and (2) mentioning the issue to someone in a position of power whom you think you can trust to be discreet (such as her peer, or her supervisor, or HR).  One tactic that may reduce her incentive to be weird toward you is to minimize the reaction she gets out of you, if possible.  She's already categorized you as ""easy to get a reaction out of"", so it may be hard to change that perception.  But if you consistently respond to her strangeness with a noncommittal, bored, apathetic ""I see"" or ""gotcha"" or ""okay"" (and you manage to maintain that composure until she's gone), eventually she may give up on trying to provoke you, no matter what her reasons are for wanting to provoke you.  Easier said than done."

The fact she might have a crush actually crossed my mind a couple times, based on some comments that had sexual innuendo and my own intuition, but I don't know, she's married to a man for decades so maybe not. I tried to have less reaction to her but she commented on that behavior and tried to call me out on it. Maybe I'll be more gradual.  I honestly feel like there's no one I can go to. She's the head honcho basically. In one desperate moment I spoke to a couple people on staff and they were 100% empathetic but they can't do anything either."

SocialEngineering,30hprt,autowikibot,2,Sat Mar 28 03:24:09 2015 UTC,What you're experiencing looks awfully like double bind and as explained on Wikipedia is a form of control. She's trying to establish her dominance on you by confusing you about her behavior (she may not do that consciously). I think she sees you as a threat as shown by her different behavior around others.  You can't really do anything to change her behavior that I'm aware of. What you can do is cutting through the bullshit and not take personally when she's trying to harass you with petty remarks and behavior because you can't win so set your own winning condition.

SocialEngineering,30fj4x,mizel_is_daydreaming,32,Thu Mar 26 23:14:47 2015 UTC,"Oh man! I can contribute to this thread. I was a bartender in Canada for 5 years while going through school. I've worked at a number of different bars/locations and I've got some great stuff on tips.   Fishing  If you don't do this already, do it. Fishing for tips is when you put a couple loonies or toonies on the bar between you and the customer. It's supposed to give the appearance that other people have tipped you already and you've just been too busy to pick up the change. This signals to the customer that they should put down some money too, and in my experience they do. The trick here is to not go overboard. If you strew only lonnies and toonies across the bar it'l look like a plant. I would typicaly put out a loonie, a tonnie, and two quarters. Highly recommend.   Tourists  For my first two years in the industry, I worked at a waterfront bar that catered to tourist clientèle. We got a lot of people from Japan for whatever reason and they weren't really used to tipping. We tried a couple experiments where we would put out a jar with a $5 bill and various change. Seeing the $5 occasionally prompted tourists not used to our currency to match it. I'd say it happened about 1/10 times. Just an interesting thought.   Sliding the Money Across the Bar  So to get back to a more realistic line of advice, I find it's pretty important that you hand customers their change on the bar instead of in their hands. I found that slamming down the drinks and the change on the bar would trend customers towards sliding me back a loonie or a toonie but when I put it in their hand it went straight to their wallet in one fluid motion. I think my guess is that it takes some time and dexterity to pick up a bill and change from the surface of a bar. In that time a customer doesn't want to seem cheep (if their with someone) or figures I can more easily notice them not leaving me anything.   Drop the Change  Honestly, I would sometimes get someone really cheap (or from another culture where tipping isn't a thing) that would plague me all night. In those rare cases, I got good at fumbling some change. I would go to hand them their change, I would let my thumb slip and drop a loonie or something, I would then find it on the bar, apologize, and hand it back to them. About 1/2 times this broke the no tipping spell and the person would just slide it back at me or say ""forget about it"" while I was getting it for them.   A Final Thought  You mentioned you have a problem getting tipped the small change based on the drink price (like 50c). I'm sorry to say that for the first 3 or so years I did this, I was at the mercy of the drink prices too. There's no avoiding it. Honestly, the way to get out of that trap is just to become a better bartender. Learn some flair, learn some better mixology, make people laugh, and you'll blow past that barrier in no time. Personally, I went to bartending school and upped my game pouring drinks and interacting with people. It made a noticeable difference in my income that following year."

SocialEngineering,30fj4x,Dollface_Killah,14,Fri Mar 27 09:44:46 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a small sample size combined with observational bias.

SocialEngineering,30fj4x,MycTyson,7,Thu Mar 26 23:56:16 2015 UTC,"Simple: make it easy for us to drop a ~15-20% tip.... for drinks in the $5-6 range, make sure I have a loonie in my change.

And, then there's this article (previously posted by /u/WTF_SilverChair) which states that actions of ""will"" are witnessed almost a full 7 seconds before the user is aware of their decision... which further supports the dismantling of the ""free will"" dualism argument you're vehemently defending despite a lack of evinced citations.   We could proceed into the materialism and determinism arguments but no one can really agree upon a unified definition of what ""free will"" really is so I'm not sure such a discussion is warranted.

It was like living in the dark and suddenly, a floodlight showed up. It's a great blessing, but also a heavy curse, it doesn't just shut off for the uncomfortable stuff. Anyway, I constantly see people who are easily manipulated, and the way they react to things can show you not only the possibility but the path. Bad or good, idk but it sure is useful."

SocialEngineering,30bsj8,Klebsiellapneumoniae,9,Thu Mar 26 02:05:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe practice by telling self-deprecating stories. They are easier to believe than stories of awesome things happening. Also let the story build itself, don't be too excited or pronounced at the beginning because then people expect a large punchline.    It's hard to know exactly how you could improve without hearing you tell a story. Maybe post a video of you telling an interesting story of something that happened recently?"
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,FirstNameSmitty,5,Thu Mar 26 05:08:53 2015 UTC,"practice by telling self-deprecating stories.   100 times this. I tell a really dumb but true story about a time when my family adopted a cat that was used to living indoors that was now going to be an outside cat. It had trouble adjusting and would frequently paw at the door to get inside which made an annoying sound. One day I thought I was clever and decided I would spook it. I lay down on the floor and reached up to the doorknob. Then I quickly popped the door open and yelled ""BOO!"" right in the cats face.  It hissed like a demon goblin, clawed me in the face and ran inside the house and hid terrified. Spent the next 40 minutes searching the house for the cat with puffy red welts on my face.    It's a funny story about me being a dumbass, it's easy to visualize and depending on the setting I can be more or less animated when I tell it. People generally get a good laugh and it's an easy story to segue into naturally. I never have to say ""Let me tell this dumb story about me and my cat."" or some sort of unnatural conversation shift, and usually someone has an equally exciting story to tell me afterward (which I'm more than happy to hear because it keeps them engaged).  This has helped me bond with new people over dinner and typically introduces a good series of crazy stories. I have some stories that make me seem cool about me hiking mountains in Norway, or breaking a school athletics record on my first try, but they generally don't have a punchline and would just seem like I'm bragging or trying to impress someone.  Self deprecating humor is great, makes you seem human and likable. And even if that cat story wasn't true it's still funny and I can kind of act it out as I tell it which people tend to find engaging."
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,Toribor,3,Thu Mar 26 17:14:10 2015 UTC,"Don't oversell it before you arrived to the point. In fact tone it down if you can. Stories are often salted, but don't salt all over the dish! When telling the story, salt when it comes to amounts not factual things that happen. I.e litres of water poured over the police officer upon entering the house or slices of beef on that huge hamburger your wife had for lunch. Keep the stories short and simple, use pauses but not too many. Read your audience and don't buckle or allow someone to move in on your story unless you failed it badly. Pick yourself up and try again."
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,tapzoid,2,Thu Mar 26 06:17:48 2015 UTC,Well what do you mean by can't tell a story? Are the stories just so wierd that they seem to be bullshit or do you just studder alot.
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,squirtle53,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:07:11 2015 UTC,"The main problem is when I tell stories that are a bit unusual. That's when I come off as weird and bullshitty. Let me try to explain  If I were to tell you how I was walking my dog, he pooped, I had to pick it up and it touch my hands leaving it smelly; you will believe that because it would be quite easy for me to tell you the story (knowing it's stuff that happens times to times to so many people), and I won't try hard to make you believe it  But, if I was to tell you about this time I got drunk in Soho (London), visited almost all the gays bars there until I found one with half-naked pole dancers (which obviously you, or my group of friends haven't heard of) and got chatted up by this old weird looking guy and it was creepy; then people wouldn't believe me because I would naturally say it in a way that I am trying to convince my audience just because these events are unusual.  .  An that is what I refer to by ""can't tell a story"""
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,obie_wankenobie,3,Thu Mar 26 10:25:37 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem is that you give too much background story. Liars are known to elaborate more and give a lot more details,  which is why it sounds like you're bullshitting. For example, with your second story,  is the getting drunk in Soho, going around to nearly all the gay bars,  and finding one with half naked dancers relevant? Or are you trying to talk up about the creepy old guy? If it were me,  all I'd say was ""One time when I was out,  this old dude blah blah blah."" or,  if the information was relevant,  I'd say ""So,  I was really drunk one time and decided I NEEDED to find half naked dancers. So after awhile,  we finally find the right bar. I'm finally enjoying myself when creepy guy blah blah blah"". Make the story your focus, not the background details. It'll be more creditable and fun to listen to."
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,Toribor,2,Thu Mar 26 19:23:28 2015 UTC,That's really good advice to my answer. Thank you!
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,Toribor,2,Thu Mar 26 21:45:02 2015 UTC,"You don't have to prove anything when you're telling a story. In fact over-explaining yourself makes it seem like you're lying even more so than just stating simple facts. The most you should ever go toward justifying your story is to say something like ""Crazy, I know."" Address the ludicrousness of the story to show that you understand how unbelievable or strange a situation seems. Saying something like ""I know that seems really weird but Matt was there and he can back me up, we even still have the coaster that we stole from that place and everything."" is just nonsense. Legitimately if your story is interesting, plausible and you aren't bragging, no one cares.  Tell your story, feel free to acknowledged how otherworldly or unbelievable it is, but don't feel like you have to justify, explain or validate it. If the story is interesting no one really cares if it's real. They just want to be engaged and feel like you're not trying to halfheartedly sell them some sort of fiction."
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,nsgiad,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:20:41 2015 UTC,So how do I know that I am over-explaining? I feel like I don't know my boundaries here
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,Happyendings4all,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:39:47 2015 UTC,"I think the easiest way to get used to it is to just listen to a good storyteller. If a story has a lot of backstory or in jokes it's going to take so much setup that people will be bored by the time you get to it or you go into to so much extraneous explanation it feels forced. A good funny/crazy story told amongst a small group of friends should include the absolute minimum detail necessary to get the point across, with overly embellished detail for the important bits.  Listen to Kevin smith tell this story.  He's in front of a microphone so clearly he has a captive audience and can go on at length more than most people. But he does an excellent job of telling a very complicated story with great punchlines and jokes the whole way through. There isn't any more explanation than necessary for the boring details, but when he's describing something funny he goes into a lot of detail to help capture the funny or interesting bits. He's animated and engaging. No waiting around to explain who someone is, what there name is or why they are in the story unless that in itself is interesting. He doesn't qualify anything he is saying, he doesn't have to.  Obviously that's a pretty long story for a more casual setting, but once you are comfortable you should be able to hold a small audience captive to tell a story with the same level of charisma.  Listen to some good speakers and get the feel for how they organize their thoughts. I don't think telling a story or anecdote is that different from just being a good conversationalist in general. Be confident, brief and engaging."
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,Kitchner,2,Fri Mar 27 02:56:09 2015 UTC,I don't really see the gay bar thing outside or the realm of reality at all. Do you have really boring friends perhaps? Maybe they just can't fathom your shenanigans because they are things they would never do.
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,nmp12,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"Unless you are really good at shaggy dog stories like Kevin Smith, in that clip, your stories should maybe have a point? Like your funny story about the poles raises more questions than it answers. Why were you looking for them?"
SocialEngineering,30bsj8,rickrocketed,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"To be honest the best way to solve this is by making sure you do this kind of stuff with your friends.   Theres a guy i know who if I told you the sort of stuff that happened when I was out drinking with him you'd think ""Ha, yeah right!"" but the fact is I'm telling you about someone else, and he will back me up. I've even got photos to prove some of it.  Since everyone thinks you're a bit of a bullshitter you basically just need to set out to prove them wrong. Photos, introduce them to people who were there etc.  Then you'll get them doubting ""Well if he didn't lie about that, maybe he didn't lie about the other stuff"".  Ultimately it's not a big deal though, if everyone thinks you're a bullshitter despite the fact you're not you already have an advantage, which is you know they wont believe you're telling a straight story.   You can use this to your advantage in tons of ways, just watch How I Met Your Mother and look at Barney Stinson. None of the group believe half his stories but this means they get caught out when he is telling the truth."

SocialEngineering,309dpw,senjutsuka,7,Thu Mar 26 00:49:34 2015 UTC,Practice is probably the most important thing.
SocialEngineering,309dpw,taH_pagh_taHbe,3,Wed Mar 25 16:44:23 2015 UTC,"OK, I have this problem and just recently I found something that helps. I read things out loud. Sounds silly, but it really seems to be helping me. I feel less nervous about the way I come off because I have practiced talking.  In the moment, you're thinking of what to say, there is little time to consider how you say it, so practicing the way you want to sound makes it more fluid when it comes time to speak."
SocialEngineering,309dpw,PMtrained,3,Wed Mar 25 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"This is amazing advice, and helped me a ton (thank god, acting classes!).  The more you can make intended delivery automatic, the less problems you'll have when interacting with people on the day-to-day.    I'd also add in to practice adding in different emotions to the reading to generate a desired effect.  Slightly happy, slightly annoyed, screaming, giggly, etc.  It'll give you more control over your emotions in a real interaction"

There's also a bit of Parkinson's Law going on too: the perceived importance of the interaction grows the more time you have to think about it.

SocialEngineering,30cgdv,qngd43gfe59g7,5,Thu Mar 26 06:04:47 2015 UTC,How about not stealing? And if you do...don't get caught.
SocialEngineering,30cgdv,parawing742,3,Thu Mar 26 06:14:50 2015 UTC,"Hold on now. They were probably left out for the convenience of the residence and presumably their guests. The mistake came in in the demeanour of OP's taking of the tea. Stuffing tea bags in your pocket with your head down? Even in text that reads like stealing, even if it is a convenience item. Imagine how it must have looked like in person. Don't play into people's biases about young people.   In a proper socially engineered situation you look exactly like you belong there. The goal is for the conscious mind of those around to never be alerted that something is off, so they never come out of autopilot.   BUT, in that situation when they were first caught, after making the mistake of shoving them in pockets rather then just walking out with some (hell, I'd take a box) at that point you have to play to people's assumptions. You've already got this guy thinking deliquent stealing tea, that assumption is hard to modify, but if you can slightly alter it by giving off the 'rebellious' while also appearing to be following the rules then you're golden. I'd probably play it, after he says you can't take those, with something like ""Man, I don't even want these fucking teas. My dad told me to go get them, says he gets them all the time, but this time I have to get them. Fucking bullshit."" Makes it seem   1) Like your following out the orders of one of the residents which implicitly comes with more caution, and  2) Makes it seem like by interfering with your fetching of the tea they are interfering with parenting. Almost no adult will challenge the parenting of other adults. This can be used both as a parent and as the child."
SocialEngineering,30cgdv,NoAttentionAtWrk,0,Thu Mar 26 06:50:32 2015 UTC,"That's genius, that would've been a really good way to handle it.  Just play it off like you don't even want it, and that you were just told to go get some, that would short-circuit the entire motivation for pursuit as per your 2 reasons.  You obviously know a shitload more about this than I do, and I just didn't follow why you said putting your head down makes it seem suspicious.  I would think the opposite would be more suspicious, like you too jumpy if you're noticing everything.  I would think that someone who belongs would not give a shit who shows up around them, and so they would just continue on their task, and have some actual goal to the task.  Anything other than finishing up what you're doing and then going where you have to go, then I would think that this would seem shady.  I don't mean head down as in scared and intimidated head down, I meant head down as in 'doing what I have to do here and ignoring everything else because it's not important' blissfully-ignorant type of head down."

Given the scepticism and controversy surrounding psychological priming, I thought this study offered a neat illustration of the way our decisions can be controlled by unconscious factors - often designed by other people. And I found it amazing how the brain creates an illusion to hide that fact. Let me know your thoughts or queries, and I'll do my best to answer them. Best wishes, David"
SocialEngineering,305fmq,Spore2012,3,Tue Mar 24 17:08:04 2015 UTC,"The part about the letting people persuade themselves is actually very important in the field of psychology and addictions.  For example, if someone has a problem, you wouldn;t want to come at them with ""You have a problem with X, You need to listen to me and fix it because I've done it."" even though that may be exactly what they need, it's not going to work most of the time.   Instead you have to use a technique like, ""You have a problem with X, I wonder why that is?"" or ""... I wonder how we could fix that?"" this gives them the idea that they are in control and they are more likely to seek your help.  A lot of this stuff applies in many areas to life as well. eg; as a waiter you get more tips if you kneel down to eye level of a table, lightly touch the customer (kino) on the shoulder, arm, or leg. Leaving a smiley face or some candy on the bill, etc. And these same techniques work in sales situations as well. They build rapport subtly. And of course everyone on reddit knows about PUA and TRP and how they adapt these life skills for attracting and keeping a mate."

SocialEngineering,30871q,ElectronicFlesh,2,Wed Mar 25 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"Who do you intend to spread the word to if you have no followers? Managing social media accounts for an organization is more than just posting when you have something. You should be strategic about what you post, what time of the day you post it (when is your target audience on Instagram the most), and how often you post (people will unfollow accounts that they perceive as spamming them).  So you should probably 1) take more pictures, even if they are of the same thing (you can post only the best of a series) 2) post more pictures and 3) explain that you don't post all of the pictures for the reasons above."

SocialEngineering,2zyjnn,talkercb,7,Mon Mar 23 00:49:06 2015 UTC,"Say 'Hi'. Imagine what you would want someone that you are not currently interested in saying to you?   After 'Hi', just follow with what you want to talk to them about.   Dating: Hi, how are you? Having a good time? My name is x, you looked interesting so I thought I would see if you wanted a chat.   If you are after more than that, like a way for them to keep going, then just ask some basic questions to find out about them, and ask them about it. You essentially want them to go on a rant, and then realise it, and then realise that you enjoyed it. Religion/Politics/News/Movies/etc are great for that, but only if you can ignore your own bias. You do not want to tell them they are wrong or you think otherwise. You have to be able to enjoy anything they mention. Look at religious people. This is how they do it because they all have the precept of being selfless. This is what gets their foot in the door for almost everyone. It is only when they start to tell people about their views on reality that people lose interest or detect lies/half truths.   One of the best things to do is make them try and convince you of something, then (for real of feigned) change your belief to theirs. E.g. This band sux I hate them, person tells you they love the band. Get them to explain why they like them, and make this a reason for why you now changed your opinion. People love having their opinions acknowledged via transference.   It also allows you to become more controllable/malleable in their eyes. Shifts the power to them in the friendship. It also makes you appear dumber sometimes, so use that as the occasion fits."

CNN is a private, for profit, company and therefore it's product must match the interest of its viewers. This is not manipulating the news but rather choosing what stories are relevant for viewership.  Propaganda is RT assuring you Putin is a great and admired leader who has no involvement in recent political assassinations whereas American news is  'How soon will ISIS hurt American values?', 'Is recent Russian turmoil a risk to YOU at home?'.  US news will chose stories and facts to suit the narrative it wants to tell, it will not create stories and facts to tell a narrative.

Which they objectively do because there's only so much they can cover."
SocialEngineering,2ztnlb,GothicFuck,3,Sun Mar 22 06:17:45 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion, based on observations that led to me essentially rage quite most major news sources in the U.S., but I think many, Americans and elsewhere, still hang on to an ideological view of the press, that it serves to inform the people and protect them from tyranny through information, education, and exposure of misgivings.  That may have been the case before, but the truth now, at least in America, is that news is no longer a service, it's a business. Fox News is not designed to be right wing skewed because that's what its founders believed whole heartedly in, it's because its founders saw an untapped market that wasn't being fulfilled by the other news stations. They gained a flood of previously unserved conservative viewers and reaped the benefits to the tune of millions in advertising, from companies eager to reach new audiences.   A business, such as news, needs to keep you captivated and constantly coming back, so they can sell advertising slots at higher and higher costs. They will play on your survival instincts, just to keep you there. If one news station tells you four people were murdered two towns over, and the other doesn't, then you may tend to follow the one that told you, that warned you of the danger. This leads to a snowballing effect, where one news station will tell you how ISIS may have sympathizers in your tiny Oklahoma town. If the other station isn't reporting it, then your survival instincts, wanting to know what danger is there, will tend more towards the former news source.  It's about what sells, and fear sells. Yes, there are certainly alternative motives as well, but, by far, the greatest motivating factor to all this culture of fear, and obsession with terrorism, racism, and the like is that it is profitable to scare and piss you off, and they know it, and informing you takes a back seat. It's not about propaganda, it's about profit.  The truth is, the news media are some of the greatest social engineers out there, and they're making millions off it."

SocialEngineering,2zg445,ElectronicFlesh,43,Wed Mar 18 08:31:11 2015 UTC,"+1   I'm just a casual participant in this subereddit, so take these comments with some scepticism. But it seems that you are dealing with a person who has very little to lose in terms of social standing or economic opportunities. i.e. He doesn't have a job to lose, or peers that will hold him to account in any serious way. If his payoff is to get a reaction from you, then almost all attempts to reason with him are payoffs for him in this transaction.  There is the slim chance that talking to him in front of his 7-8 peers, explaining how his comments and actions are affecting your life might reach him somehow. But realistically, unless you have a lot of nerve and are willing to risk an escalation that possibly makes things worse and drags you further into a situation, I'd stick with the conservative option.   I think the tactic which is most likely to achieve a good outcome, without a great deal of risk or effort on your part, is to wait until the next situation occurs and once he has over stepped the mark, say to him you consider his actions harassment, and that if he continues that you will call the police, if he does so, wait there and call the police. Don't make a threat and then not carry it out.  Unless he is completely unreasonable, he will probably apologise to you and be completely respectful in the presence of the police and never speak to you again. I think being homeless forces you to realise when its prudent to back down as you have little recourse in law or support from your peers. Do this in front of the other 7-8 people he hangs around with. They don't want to the police being called either."

The only way you can prevent this in the future or further escalate is to give him consequence to his actions...deal with it now or it will continue to escalate.. Like a dog - he will get bolder and bolder if you do not establish a boundary.. If you cannot record him, can't walk with your bf regularly, and are unwilling to press charges and call the police on such you have limited your real options tremendously. Ideally in this situation you want the police involved--just inform them of this wheelchair bound homeless guy sexually harassing and taunting and bullying women--enough complaints and they will eventually park a car near by to observe and deal with him.  The guy has little to lose when he is not challenged..some bully's you cannot ignore as it feeds to what they want--you expressing weakness and somehow you did by either walking away faster or ignoring him or appearing intimidated..the only way this changes is if you change your response.  You either have to confront him in some way via the police or charges or something IMO..or you learn to find a new route to work.  If it were me - I would make the police call or mace him...but being a guy my first thought really is to stop and say to him lets go somewhere--then get behind his wheelchair and push him in front of a moving bus or oncoming traffic...

After about a week, or if you feel threatened, call the police and show them the videos. Explain that this went on for months before you started recording. If you manage to record him throwing something at you, even if it's just a condom, or blocking your path or trying to touch you, they can arrest him for assault. If the officer feels that based on the recorded incidents he has made you feel threatened, they can arrest him for harrassment. If neither of those apply, the cop can still go down there and scare the shit out of him and it's unlikely he'll ever bother you again after a conversation with the police about it."

SocialEngineering,2zg445,Mr_Bignutties,3,Fri Apr 3 07:51:23 2015 UTC,"You've gotten some good advice on here, and I agree strongly with those who are recommending calling the police, videoing his behavior, and asking an intimidating male to step in.  Chiming in to comment on your suggestion that you might be able to ""turn this guy into a possible ally"" -- I don't think that's realistic.  People don't change their mindsets dramatically more than a few times in a lifetime.  This guy actively harasses you and does not have his life together -- that tells you that he's not likely to be converted to a friend and not likely to be responsive to reason.  He speaks the language of intimidation and power, not respectfulness or reasonableness.  (Which is sad for him, but not something you can change.)  What you can realistically hope for is intimidating him into leaving you alone or finding a new tree in another neighborhood.  Your most promising tools in that effort are the police, your boyfriend, and carrying pepper spray as a last resort."
SocialEngineering,2zg445,jshlif,3,Wed Mar 18 16:00:28 2015 UTC,"Perhaps telling his neighbors that once the cops come, they'll harass each one of them, so it is in their best interest to get him to stop.   If that fails, violence either from you (mace), BF, or cops."

SocialEngineering,2zg445,EquipLordBritish,3,Wed Mar 18 20:02:53 2015 UTC,"Edit: I'd just call the cops before doing all the stuff I detailed below, but you did say you're looking for a social engineering way to deal with the situation.  He's obviously getting, or hoping to get, some sort of reward out of treating you this way.  If you figure out what's rewarding his behavior and remove it, he'll stop behaving that way.  The hard part here is that the reward is probably simply the interaction he has with a beautiful woman, and any attention you give him -- even disgust or walking away more quickly than you were before, which is still a way of acknowledging his presence -- will encourage him to maintain or increase his attacks on you.  You could also try punishing bad behavior, or rewarding good behavior.  There are two kinds of punishment and reward: positive and negative.  A positive punishment/reward is when you introduce something new to their environment; a negative punishment/reward is when you remove something from their environment.  So a negative reward would be that you remove something they don't like, and a positive punishment would be introducing something they don't like, such as pepper spray to the face.  Negative punishments and positive rewards are usually the most effective.  If we assume that what's rewarding to him is as simple as seeing you walk by and getting a reaction from you, then you can create a negative punishment by avoiding his corner.  You can reinforce the punishment by telling him, or his friends, that you're avoiding that corner specifically because of the condom incident.  You can also reward him for good behavior, and you have a perfect opportunity to create and immediately reward good behavior: every time you walk by him with your boyfriend, he behaves the way you want him to.  Say something nice to him when you're with your boyfriend, and make sure to tie it specifically to his behavior.  For example, ""Wow _____ I appreciate how respectful you're being right now!"" and smile at him.  Boom!  Huge reward, and he knows why he got it.  If you can get him to associate respectful behavior with rewards, and disrespectful behavior with punishment, you can control his behavior by giving or withholding your attention.  This does require you to consistently reward his good behavior, and punish bad behavior by taking a different route.  It also requires you to have crystal-clear boundaries: if he starts out polite to get you to talk to him, but then says something that makes you uncomfortable you must immediately tell him that what he said was inappropriate, and then walk away and avoid him for the next day or two, depending on how bad it was.  It will take effort and persistence and absolute commitment to consistency, but if you're up for it you should be able to train him to treat you respectfully all the time."

But, in reality, the only real useful way to do this (and it working) is to use proven psychological techniques. And those must be specifically applied on a case by case basis.  So, I would suggest you get a decent psychology textbook (look at local textbook listings for unis) and conduct little case studies and experiments.  Example 1: The guy and the slut might be a case of showing the guy he has a social coping mechanism that he self suggests, like: ""I cannot be in love with this person because I believe I can find someone better"". Fixing this would involve something along the lines of getting him to self diagnose himself of this coping mechanism and when that happens you give him a pre-planned new coping mechanism to deal with it and accomplish the goal.  Example 2: The guy who wants his aunt to stay and leave might be experiencing some kind of cognitive dissonance and might need you to teach him about a method of balancing his priorities to solve the problem. Or it could be a completely different situation of psychological codependency. Either way, you need to read up on some things and do a bit of analysis."

My go-to is to call people ""brother"", not ""bro"" or ""brah"" but a straight and deliberate ""brother."" Strong eye contact and strong body language is also important because bullies will go for someone who seems weak. You want to seem empathetic, non-aggressive, and apologetic. For example, ""What is wrong brother? Did I do something to offend you? I'm sorry.""  I've talked down all sorts of pissed off people who were angry at me: racists, drunks, and general assholes. Usually, at least in America, most people try to provoke the other person into fighting so that it's somewhat mutual, if you just back down they normally won't attack. If you express too much pride they'll attack you.   Meanwhile, you should also be pre-positioned to strike first: get your hands out of your pocket (unless you have a weapon in there), focus on their eyes, look for a weapon, and be ready to fight dirty as fuck. No one has a legitimate reason to strike in aggression, but if you really think someone is going to attack you and won't back down: punch their throat, kick their balls, pull their shirt/jacket over their head, and run away."

SocialEngineering,2z5lmp,Hyoscine,4,Sun Mar 15 22:14:20 2015 UTC,"I think ""brother"" still works better because it's formal, this is part of the element that I speculate throws people off balance. Start addressing men as ""brother"" and women as ""sister"", it really changes around the dynamic of conversations.   For example, when women address men as ""brother"" they're entirely disabled from flirting. I've seen very angry men calm down by addressing them as brother. Talking to people as if they're a sibling or kinship fucks with people's heads in ways I'm still experimenting with. I see results all the time."

If they persist, you verbally tell them to back off. Again - calm, pithy sentences. Don't come off as aggressive, come off as cool and most importantly as someone in control.

SocialEngineering,2z5lmp,mayor_ardis,3,Mon Mar 16 02:25:42 2015 UTC,"Do not listen to anyone who suggests using reason or a logic set of things to say. You want the fight to end? Show fear of the other person, as public as possible. Give them the power they want. No one really wants to fight, it hurts both parties always.  But an asshole on the street or in a bar wants dominance - and if you give it to them, they are more likely to stop (perhaps even respect you out of acknowledgement of their superiority).  The moment you try to keep any semblance of your own dominance, the aggressor has a chance to escalate. Trying to talk down a psychopath will almost never work, because often when they can sense their own anger subsiding - they take it as you beating them."

A group of about 12 lads approached me and there was a gobby one at the front who offered me out.    My cousin would have been useless as backup (she's was about 10 years old) and I couldn't get back inside so I figured I was in for a kicking (12 vs 1 1/2 are not great odds).  I went with asking the gobby one if he needed his mates to help beat me up.  He replied that of course he didn't need them as he was tough and I was a ponce.  I told him ok then let's go over to the car park, just me and him, and we would have the fight.  Unless he was soft and needed his mates to help.  He didn't want to back out but now couldn't fight me with the backup I was hoping he was relying on without losing face infront of his mates.  Plus he's just spent 20minutes watching me throw people about so he said ""I know someone who could beat you up"" and I invited him to go and get him.

Your local junkyard probably has stacks of the parts you need and they take cash, no ID required.    I can usually attack most security hardware with what I learned in engineering school.

I even had this dickies outfit that had ""honest achmed's computer repair"" or something embroidered on it.  I look a little nerdy and I carry a laptop so that got me into all kinds of crazy places.  It even got me into places I wasn't trying to get into.  I accidentally wore it to court on laundry day and the deputies at the security checkpoint were actively trying to wave me through to fix one of the computers.  It's not really about a clipboard or a martini glass or any specific object getting you in.  It's about following the script, like in a play.  Everyone has a script in their head.  Their internal script, their script for their dentist, their script for their boss, their script for Turkish people, whatever.  You want to figure out the script that ends with ""and then I let the guy in the building,"" then do whatever the script says.  It's true that a clipboard is a part of a lot of scripts, and I do remember having a few in my work van when I was doing pen testing.  The clipboard alone isn't usually enough though, it's just one part of a much larger script.    The script for the pest control guy involves a dude with a camera, a clipboard, a flashlight, and a blue collar outfit with a pest control logo.  He wanders around checking pest traps, poking at the ceiling, and taking pictures of the crud that falls out.  He tries to give out business cards to anyone who expresses interest in what he's doing because he wants to come to their house and inspect that too.  10% off for new customers, he says.  No one wants his 10% off and they avoid making eye contact with him.  He gets let in the building even though he has a DSLR around his neck.  The script for the fire inspector involves a sedan with some antennas sticking out of it, a fire inspection company logo (btw, vinyl cutters are the best thing ever if you want to dress up a rental car), and two dudes in half a fireman outfit each.  Dude #1 is the boss dude and says stuff like ""did you remember seeing a maximum occupancy sign in the cafeteria?"" to dude #2, who doesn't know because he's the new guy; his job is to hold a clipboard and shrug a lot.  They get let in the building by the facilities guy who then unlocks everything for them so they can look at it.  If you just walk in with a clipboard without getting those other details right, it might work but it significantly increases your changes of getting made.  It's really not that hard to do your research on a particular script and hit up a thrift store for the stuff you need to flesh out the character.  What's part of nearly all scripts is a lack of hesitation.  Professionals don't hesitate because their time is money.  It only takes a quarter second of hesitation for someone to notice you're not supposed to be there.  More than any specific object, an appropriately dressed person trying to accomplish an obvious goal at a reasonable speed without hesitation can go anywhere it looks like they might belong.     Did you ever have to use your get out of jail free paperwork?    Lots of times.  Sometimes it didn't work because I caught the rent-a-cop sleeping or something.  Joke's on him: I get a free sandwich and double overtime until someone came and bailed me out.   If I have a large storefront with several doors and lots of transient items what would the best thing be to focus on security wise?   I'm not a loss prevention guy so I'm kind of the wrong person to ask, but I suspect you'll get the most benefit from investing in cameras and a good loss prevention officer.  If you don't have that kind of volume then I'm not sure."

SocialEngineering,2yuxax,bigjew222,14,Fri Mar 13 03:32:23 2015 UTC,"Being able to bypass computer security is pretty useful but it took me something like a decade to be able to do it semi-reliably and I have to put in a ton of continuing education.  It's a lot of work.  I've always been interested in it and had the resources to pursue it as a hobby, I can't imagine anyone doing it without having both a drive to learn it and the cash to fuel it.  Lockpicking is also useful, also takes a long time to learn.  You have to be a little obsessed with checking out new locks you find, which leads to some awkward conversations..."

SocialEngineering,2yuxax,CoffeeMetalandBone,23,Fri Mar 13 02:18:19 2015 UTC,"First, Do you have a standard metric by which you evaluate a physical location? Numbers? Grades? Or specific reports based on the clients wishes?   The firm had a word template that I filled out and it had two checkboxes per item: ""needs attention"" and (I think) ""urgent"".  If I found a problem I checked one of the boxes.  Kind of like a homeowner inspection except we had to think about deliberate damage.  At the bottom we totalled up the checkboxes and that was the ""score"".  Like golf, higher is worse.  As far as I know there isn't any kind of standard for facility security outside of industry specific stuff like the DoD.    There was a separate narrative section where, if they paid for it, we would  try to break into the facility in a benign way.  This wasn't about whether we could do it.  The goal was to identify mismatches between policy and our observations.  It was still a thrill to put stickers underneath stuff in locked rooms for them to find later when we claimed to have broken in.  Realistically any patient, smart group of 3 criminals with about $10k can break into nearly any commercial facility with a month of work.  It's just not cost effective to stop them.  Commercial security is the business of letting the customer know someone's trying to break in as quickly as possible at the lowest cost.   Second, I assume your clients normally ask you to test their own sites, but have you ever been asked to pen test a rivals place, perhaps? Would that be legal?   Nope.  Because of the chance of arrest, we didn't do business with anyone unless someone with officer authority could write us a get out of jail free letter that we would keep on our person during any practical testing.  It's totally illegal to hire someone to break into someone else's property.  That's probably a dozen different offenses."

I'm actually an engineer by training, I don't have any formal credentials except I was licensed as a locksmith for a while because of a contract I had.    Many other pen testers don't have formal qualifications because their track record is good.

Usually there's the master power switch for the building, the fire panel, 66 blocks full of phone circuits, sprinkler control... and I've never seen a camera in one.

The last time I put my resume on a hiring site my phone wouldn't stop ringing for a month.  Most of the calls were from recruiters who were so green it hurt.    It sounds kind of dumb, but my real start was being lucky enough to be born to some rich, slightly irresponsible parents in an affluent area.  Hanging out with your friend's dad and being his slave labor when he's going through a WinNT 3.51->4.0 migration at a hospital is solid gold career prep.    The thing about income inequality is that it has this positive feedback loop that's probably going to cause my kids to benefit from the same effect.  It's not about the money, it's about having mentors in your neighborhood and the time to hang out with them.  If you want to make pen testing your career, my advice is to find one who needs help and lose a year worth of weekends helping him or her out."

A lot of the practical knowledge you have to get from someone who already has industry experience.  That's why alarm companies will only get a license if the owner has a lot of experience under another alarm company already, for example.

This xkcd is painfully true:  http://xkcd.com/538/  Most CISOs try to cover their ass by selecting some compliance methodology like SAS70 or ISO27xxx without walking around and looking at stuff like a criminal would.  Security standards help make sure you didn't forget any details, but they aren't a substitute for common sense.    In the military there's this term they have, HUMINT.  It's a fancy word for asking people questions.  The best security I ever saw was at a military facility where all the guards interviewed you when you got access.  There were no passwords on anything, once you were in you could do whatever you needed to do.    But to get in you had to be on the list, then talk to the guards.  They would try to trick you!  During the interview you'd get to know each others' favorite beers, sports teams, wife's bad habits, etc.  They'd ask you how things were back in Detroit knowing damn well you were from Kansas City.

Later on when you were trying to get in they would have a brief chat, that's when they would ask you questions about your wife's Toyota.

SocialEngineering,2yhmoj,bryanleichter,27,Mon Mar 9 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"The essence of what you're talking about is equivalent to a lawyer's cross examination. The main trick is to use language that makes the answer obvious and narrow as you go down the path. E.g. ""Is it fair to say X?"" ""Wouldn't you agree with Y?"" While also restating the other person's position in such a way as to highlight the problems with that person's perspective. E.g. 'Is it fair to say you don't think john's drug use is a problem because he's generally high functioning?' 'Wouldn't you agree that he wasn't functioning well that one time?' 'So is it your position that we should assume it happened only once and won't happen again?' 'Well then you'd agree with me that we should help him avoid situations where he loses control?'   The main caveat to the above is that it's far more formal than a natural conversation, but the essence is the same. Get the other person to keep saying yes as you restate his position."
SocialEngineering,2yhmoj,SufferableFool,13,Tue Mar 10 00:12:19 2015 UTC,"If I can presume that the enabler in the situation is aware of the same set of facts you are, you might want to try a different approach altogether. Trying to tear down someone's line of reasoning can be an exercise in futility if their position isn't even based on reasoning. Sure, when someone has a position that is logically untenable, they must necessarily be have to rest said position on an untrue premise or a fallacious line of reasoning IF you can get them to lay it out logically. However, the emotional person will resist this more and more as you make them feel threatened.  It's a trap I've fallen into many times myself, especially when discussing politics, or some issue where a persons religion is to blame for their unseemly conclusion. Getting a person to lay that out into neat little logical steps that are small enough to examine properly is just a fools errand unless you have hours to spare. You'll spend way too much time looking up statistics and numbers, and if you're dealing with something that isn't even measurable or perhaps not quantifiable -- like the quality of life of your addict family member, the hypothetical QoL post-treatment, etc. What works for me a lot of the time involves asking a lot of ""why"" and ""how"" questions, but not to trick them into contradicting themselves. The first goal you should work toward is just getting them to state their goals. When they say something that is specific or nearsighted, follow up with, ""OK, but why do you want to have X happen?"" The idea is to really get at the center of the persons motivations. At some point, you will share a common goal. I imagine the enabler might say something like ""I just want Addict to be happy"". This is where you begin your emotional argument. Anything you propose has to connect back to the positive emotion that your enabler family member associates with this goal of theirs.  The sooner you can show them that you really do share this goal with them, the more open they will be to your points. Once you've worked down the emotional defenses, you might be ready to sink the claws in a little bit like ""So as much as a lot of treatment centers might make our family member unhappy and probably wont work"" (that might be a fib, but you need to deflect the knee-jerk emotional reaction to start another disagreement), ""BUT I found this ONE place that is actually great, for X Y and Z concrete reasons."" It's best if those reasons tie into positive emotions that the two shared together, like if they used to play tennis together and the place has tennis. Alternatively, it could be good to say something like, ""I know we disagreed on this before,"" (create some distance from the old arguments), ""but now that I see we have the same things in our hearts"" (reinforce the hooks you've already set in) ""do you think you could agree to intervene with us IF we could find a treatment center that meets criteria X, Y, and Z? That wouldn't be so bad, would it?"" Now, this can work really well if you already know the place that does X Y and Z, but leave it veiled as a hypothetical. Bonus points if you can engineer the enabler into finding the place themselves. But since you may not get that lucky, you should be open to ironing out some criteria with the enabler and engaging them in the process. At this point you might wind up engaging in a true compromise instead of a bit of ethical emotional manipulation dressed up as a compromise, but if the end result is better than your current state, then it's a step in the right direction.  In summary:   Do not dismiss the other person's emotional arguments, but instead use them as pointers to their true motivations in the matter Highlight that your goals align, and that any disagreements that you have are solely matters of ""how"" and not ""what"". Emphasise your agreement on the ""why"" Bonus points if you can make this process seem super organic, like you yourself are moved by your new-found connection Don't be afraid to express emotion yourself. If the other person notices everything is centering around their own emotions, they may feel manipulated. Still, a little acting is okay here, since it's for a good cause Try to get them to agree to the smaller things when possible, i.e. a specific treatment program rather than treatment at whatever cost Flipside of the above point, help the other person avoid having to admit they are wrong (unless this thing directly contradicts your end goal), because doing so is hard. Think of this like helping them past obstacles as they make it back onto the right track   I expect it may go something like this, the enabler doesn't want anyone to force the addict to do something, you get them to realize their decisions are already being forced in part by the need to avoid withdrawl, and you agree that if you can convince the addict to seek treatment voluntarily, then they will wind up with more control in their lives, which was really the thing that the enabler was worried about in the first place.  LASTLY, don't be afraid to end one, two, or even many discussions after making only partial progress. It is a big mistake to get frustrated, push too hard, and get the other person frustrated as well. Frustration is a very negative emotion and it will undo what progress you have made. It is better to leave them with gradually more and more positive emotions to associate with the new type of thinking that you ease them into entertaining. These emotions will exert their pull over time, and eventually they will come around. For poilitical matters where family members lives aren't at stake, I always say you have won at least a small victory if you can get the other person to just reconsider their position, or sincerely consider yours. You'll probably want better end results than that, but it's still a distance race and not a sprint. It often takes a long time to change your mind about something you feel strongly about. Remember that."

What else do you think we could do to support Y? What would your solution be?  This way, you're not telling them anything; it's your questions that lead them to find their own answers, which will hopefully gradually bring them around to your way of thinking, and they'll have a lot more buy-in to the solution as opposed to being told 'you are wrong, what I am saying is correct' etc.  Hope this helps!"

I'm not disregarding it completely however, I just think that it missed the ball by a margin and that is simply down to humans trying to understand something more complex than they could conceive on their own, so they use a computer matrix as we're all familiar with that concept.  The second point of the video, regarding our ever closer growing relationship with technology, has also got it's good points and if anything outlines a possible future if we were to continue straight along the path we're on now without deviating from it.

SocialEngineering,2ybcdi,-SoItGoes,15,Sun Mar 8 21:04:02 2015 UTC,"As a current salesman, so much of this advice is uniformly terrible, and is honestly making me question the utility of this sub.   I don't give two fucks about the amount of money you budgeted - if your offer is unreasonable, my first response is to kick you out as quickly as possible because you're a waste of my time. We're trained to call your bluff as quickly and abruptly as possible, so good luck with that.  If your offer is near reasonable, i'll probably take it and move to the next sale. What is reasonable is highly dependent on the other vehicles available and their prices, also the condition this vehicle is in and any repairs to be made.   If you try to devalue my vehicle, it puts you in an awkward position of both liking and disliking a car. One of my coworkers had a customer who kept doing this, and we all stifled laughter as he showed them to the door, saying 'if you really think this about the car then you obviously don't want it, so i don't want to waste any more of your time. have a good day'. The customer capitulated on his price shortly thereafter.  Also, dealerships have mechanics, detailers and vendors whose sole job is to appraise and repair damage to vehicle. You complaining that something is off about the car is tantamount to you saying you know much more about this than some mechanic/vendor/detailer - so if you bullshit it just shows that you're trying to lie about something. If you pick out too many imperfections, it again puts you in an awkward position - why are you trying to buy such a  cheap vehicle when you obviously want something new?  I'd suggest leaving the poor negotiating gimmicks at the door, do some research as to what current prices are, ensure that the vehicle you're looking to buy is in good condition, and if there are major flaws, ensure that they either repair them or deduct the cost of repairs from the price."
SocialEngineering,2ybcdi,-SoItGoes,2,Sun Mar 8 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"In my experience, when buying from dealers it's more about giving them the lowest price that they will accept than it is about bargaining with them.  Private sellers seems to be the other way around (although there are so many people that think their car is best around because ""it's got aftermarket alloy wheels"", ""yes, but the paintwork is shite and it's done 120k miles"".)"
SocialEngineering,2ybcdi,Saliiim,35,Thu Mar 12 12:10:52 2015 UTC,"What's the make, model, and year, and the bluebook value? $2750 is exceptionally low from a dealership, I hope you're not planning on this ride lasting too long.  Arguments specific to cars aside, generally the person who names their price first gives up the power in the negotiation. If they're opening with $2,750, it means they'll go lower.   I like /u/findingnewglory 's tactic of telling them you only have $2,300, but to expand on that, be prepared to walk away. Waste a bit of their time, kick the tires, take a test drive, act excited, then give them your ""highest"" offer. If they're at $2,750, you offer $2,300, they'll try to bump you up to at least $2,500. Tell them you have to call you mom to see if she'll loan you the extra $200, walk to the corner of the lot with your phone at your ear, then come back telling them no dice.  The first car I bought was a sweet camper van, and I brought my best friend with me, telling the salesman we were planning a road trip to British Columbia, then down to California. We were two kids in our early 20s, getting ready for an awesome road trip across the country and we had a pocketful of cash to burn; I didn't realize it at the time, but looking back on it this was an amazing negotiating tactic. What salesman wouldn't want to facilitate a sweet adventure like that?"
SocialEngineering,2ybcdi,birthday_machine,11,Sun Mar 8 07:29:07 2015 UTC,"Money tricks might work, but car salesmen are negotiators every day and know most of the tricks. If they give in it is usually out of sympathy because using all the tricks in the book makes you seem more pathetic to them.  I would also try to get them to admit a fault or something, then they will blame themselves for 'giving you more reason to drop the price' and accept their own failure sale for less.  E.g. Ask for a look at the engine. Then see if any of the seals (especially the head gasket) is fairly new (read: not covered in tons of dirt).  Ask them if they have replaced the head gasket - if they say yes...then grumble about that being a sign the engine is on its last legs (what about the pistons? were they checked? They may need a change and that will cost me a lot!). If they say no, then point out it looks like it hasn't been changed for ages and might be a costly thing you need to do (ask if they would fix it for no charge) offer them if they did then you buy the car at their price, if not, ask them for 2300 considering a new head gasket will cost more than the gap in price drop."

By just by looking at the manifold, you should be able to see the edges of the seal, if it is really clean it has probably been replaced recently. Also if their are oil trails running down the side, you can suggest it is leaking.  The point being, it is ambiguous. These are potential signs that could be interpreted that way. To give you a 100% response, they would have to take off the head - which both the mechanic and the salesperson do not want to do. You are not trying to claim superior knowledge, but point out one of the many things in engines that can be a sign of future trouble.  But yeah, basically find a costly repair job and infer that it might be needed, and because you are taking that on, price should come down. Used cars are full of them."

SocialEngineering,2ybcdi,bitshoptyler,24,Sun Mar 8 18:23:27 2015 UTC,"I've bought a few cars before. I got a van for 375 the guy was asking 800. I'm no shark though, and I can't say my tactics will work for you. I always bring a second person along. He's my ""family mechanic"". Tell him you're a local. Know the area you are buying in. Search craigslist for similar cars and see for yourself how far out of range the price is compared to private sellers. If it is, don't bother. It's probably a lemon anyway.  Never say you can get it from a lower price. If it's a dealer, they'll just tell you to go get it from them. /u/demigodforever has it right. Come in, ask them about the story of the vehicle. Who they bought it from, what their story was. Cars have stories, and unless they bought it at an auction, the person who sold it to them had a story. No matter what, ask for the carfax. Make a joke about it, but not a stink. If it's a used only dealer, they probably won't pull it up for you. It's not important, the important part is you're putting them on the spot and telling them you're not just going to buy the car outright.  Next, have your ""Family mechanic"" look at the car. This guy is important. He's your ace in the hole. Before all this starts, tell him he is not to talk to the sales person at all. If the salesman asks him anything, he just grunts. He checks all the fluids, voltimeter on the battery. Air filter. Push on the belt. Start the car, rev it lightly a couple of times, get out, listen to the engine. It helps if he knows what he's looking for, but you should definitely know what he's looking for and follow him like a shadow. When he's done, he asks you to step away.  You talk for about 1 minute 30 seconds, He doesn't say no to you. But he doesn't say yes either. If he knows what's up with cars, he can actually point to stuff that is actually wrong, otherwise, best if he doesn't.  You go back to the salesman. ""My mechanic isn't sure about the car, but he doesn't think it's worth 2750. He says if I tried to sell it now, i could expect to get 1200."" This is going to piss the guy off. Just nod your head, and agree with him. ""I know you have to make a profit. You're running a business. I've worked in sales too."" This is very important, ""I know we can both agree that 2750 is high for this (insert model). What's your low ball offer?"" You need to say that verbatim.  In sales, the markup is generally 33%, no matter what the product . Sometimes as much as 50, sometimes as low as 25. If he tries to hit you back at 2500, walk away. Don't settle for anything less than 25% the asking price. If you've followed all the steps correctly, you should be able to walk off the lot with the car for 2065. That's your max. But if you don't play the game, he won't take anything less than 2400."

There's nothing you can say to lower his perceived value. He knows what the dealership payed for the vehicle, he knows the book values and he knows that every penny given up is profit given up. The thing you have in your favor is that he would rather make less money than no money. It's often best to just explain that your budget is x and you're ready to take the car home now if he can get you to that number. There is no 100% tactic because some salesman are greedy and sometimes your budget won't meet the minimum they are willing to sell the vehicle for. In my experience the willingness to buy now for a specific number is the greatest motivator. We are all taught to try to keep you from leaving because once you leave we'll likely not see you again.   It may help your case if you can start a little lower on your end of the negotiations so the salesman can feel like he won a little bit too. That will really only matter if you get a salesman with an ego. Most salesmen are just trying to make a living."

It's a manipulative, but clever way of playing hard-to-get.    The only important thing to keep in mind is to make it genuinely seem like the trick you're pulling is not a trick.

Showing up late in the afternoon on the last day of the month is even better.  The pressure on them works greatly in your favor.   The key point is that there are so many used car lots, that if you leave their lot without purchasing something the odds are you won't return.  Nothing bad against their lot, those are just the odds.    With that understanding, they will usually hold out on their best offer until you are walking off the lot.  Sometimes you have to walk away and see if they call you, but if you are going in on the last day of the month this probably won't happen.   Also, don't expect miracles.  They are a business.  There is the price they paid for the car, maintenance they performed (if any), salesman's commission, pay the bills, and still come out ahead.

The book 'Influence: Psychology of persuasion' mentions a number of principles and you can use that as a crutch.  They are: Reciprocation Commitment & Consistency Social Proof Authority Liking Scarcity  To start with, be a nice person and talk to them, like really talk to them, like how you would talk to a buddy discussing said car. You should ask a few questions that genuinely interest you and you should come across as someone on the same level as the salesman. If the salesman is professional, be professional, if he's casual, you be casual too. This leads to establishing some things like commitment and liking.  While talking, do agree with him on the positive points on the car and even bring up a few ones, say stuff like how that particular model is good for some particular purpose or something. You have to be open and talking outside of personal gains here. This gains you more on commitment and liking, and also gives him grounds for reciprocation, even if he doesn't understand it. The book explains this, when someone talks against their own profit, it leads to reciprocation.  Then bring up some reason to reduce the price like how new ones of the same model are cheap or how you can get lower price somewhere. This gives you reason to negotiate the price and also establishes social proof advantageous to you.  Then add some incentive for him to close the deal with scarcity, like how you'll close the sale on that price point then and there with no further bargaining, or something like you'll pay cash right there, idk, something to make you look like a good customer that doesn't come every day."
SocialEngineering,2ybcdi,sstults,2,Sun Mar 8 07:15:06 2015 UTC,"A follow-up tactic would be to actually give them the envelope of cash. This is another gem from Influence.

They pay for 2 classes per semester. If you go through the summer, that's 6 per year. Full time is 8, so it's a little slower, but not much.    If you take a grad program that allows part time students, then you pay the tax on tuition. Outside of books, undergrad is free. You do have to work full time and go to class year round for 5+ years though.  I never would have gotten into Penn with my high school record (not bad, but also not ivy) but did, and managed to go there for free. Still seems like some kind of loophole.

I never needed anything growing up, our house was always well kept, we went on vacations, and everything we owned was in good working order. As far as I understood it, we were completely middle class.  It wasn't until I graduated from the local state school and landed an entry-level engineering job that I realized how much ""middle class"" people were making. I remember sharing my salary with my dad and him saying something to the effect of it being ""every man's dream to have children that are more successful than them.""

SocialEngineering,2y4nie,I-M-That-Guy,40,Fri Mar 6 12:07:50 2015 UTC,"I have just the cream for you.  Joking aside, there are some important things to think about here.  First of all, each and every person gets played from time to time. This is the normal state of things. The problem is that some people get irrationally angry (or angrier than warranted) and depressed about it when that happens and bash themselves by saying ""god I'm so gullible, I'm no good"". Make sure this is not the case. Some people just have the tendency to do emotional self harm. When something bad happens (as it happens from time to time) they immediately consume themselves with self-blame and doubt and it gets irrational. Those people suffer the most not because of the actions of others, but because of the internal reactions they have because of them. Just adding this here because you need to find out if you are definitely and objectively more gullible than average.  If you are objectively gullible, you just need to remember that people, in normal state of affairs, are not always honest. In my experience, they are honest and want to do good most of the time, but not always. And sometimes, it doesn't matter if they are honest or not, because the thing you need to do by believing this person is of little importance, and it doesn't matter if you are tricked into doing it. Worst case, you do it, experience unexpected betrayal, then figure things out and cut that person out of your life or if that isn't possible, then don't do any more things for that person. In this case, that person had their calculations entirely wrong and lost your valuable, free and unending support for this shitty little thing they wanted you to do. They lose once and it ends for them. You lose once but win in the end because you won't have that kind of person in your life anymore. You got out of a shitty relationship by doing this little thing, it's a bargain. You levelled up.  The last part is important: If someone betrays your trust, your should really really reevaluate your relationship with them. You don't act like a pushover and pretend what happened didn't happen. This way you filter people. You filter bad people, bad friends, bad friend groups and reach to the cream of the crop. If you don't do this filtering as it happens, you will always be surrounded with shitty people. You will always have to have your guard up. That's no good way to live.  I think learning to be not gullible is hard and it's a sharp edge, you can easily default to not trusting anyone and that is harmful for you. Instead just use the method: Let your intuition do the work for you and when it fails (it will), filter that person out of your life as you go. If it is a friend and the infraction is large enough, cut them out. If it is someone you can't cut out of your life (family, coworker) then be untrusting towards them (and only them) by default. Accept apologies but accepting an apology doesn't necessarily mean ""ok you've changed I trust you now again"".  When you do the filtering, over time, your environment will change, the people you associate with will change and you won't find yourself making hard decisions as often as a result. Many people suffer in toxic environments (toxic friend groups, toxic romantic relationships) and never stop to think that they can easily get out of them."

Know what alternative/similar apartments are going for. Even though you are buying, know what the rental cost of the apartment would be, which is important if you want to sell or rent it out later, as know what the apartment's ability to bring in in income is useful for your peace of mind, and for looking at the property as an investment, not just a home. Ask about issues with the apartment. Write these down as notes and send them to the realtor afterwards (saying, this is an email confirming what you have told me, please let me know if any of the following points are inaccurate). Have there been any break ins/what is the area like? Since you're buying an apartment, ask about service/rental charges. This is often broken down by square footage. Compare this with the area. Is this as expected? This is an important long term cost that is almost impossible to renegotiate or change, so know what you're going to be paying. Ask about the previous bills of the apartment. What are the current occupants paying for electricity/gas/water every month? Are there any other charges being paid? What is the insurance on the property/area like? Do you need parking? Does it come with it? Are there extra regular charges? How much has property value gone up in the area in the last 5 years? Research this. Is it likely to continue to rise?

However, if it's just general negotiations, hire one and watch what they do. Do the same for everyone in sales & negotiating positions. Watch carefully, and you may pick up things. Get a job telemarketing, going door to door, or selling used cars, that should boost your skills a lot. But overall, I think that things that you'll rarely need to do, you should hire someone, although you can always try and learn as much as you can as well.  Fixing your car, minor house repairs and work, fixing your computer, these are all things where other people will be more qualified, but are worth learning, as doing so will save you a lot of money. The opportunity cost of learning how to negotiate on a house is not worth the very small number of houses you'll negotiate on in your life (unless you're buying/leasing commercial property perhaps, and even then, you'd need to have a hell of a lot of locations for your business to make it worth it).

SocialEngineering,2y0nxn,Eslader,2,Tue Mar 10 02:20:01 2015 UTC,"You’re trying to help your parents, and that’s very admirable.   Negotiation on purchases is a battle of valuation.   It’s paramount to understand why the apartment is valued as it is. Then your job is to convince the other party why the apartment is worth 95% based on data.  Assuming you know all of this, and you’re looking for tips on how to phrase that email to the seller’s realtor, then here are some suggestions:   Develop rapport throughout the process. Sob stories can sometimes work. Be sure to explain the situation about your parents, and how you just want to see them happy. I can’t believe this shit works. I’ve lost some bids to others with less money and a good sob story.  Always be polite when rejected. No doesn’t mean no. Upon a rejection, you can say: “We understand. We know you’re only looking out for the best interest of your patron.” And then start another pitch.  When offering a low price, you can sound genuine by starting with positives, and then moving to the negative points of the house which would bring it down.    “The apartment sure has great potential to be beautiful, however the windows and doors are showing their age and the safety inspection shows the roof needs to be replaced in the next 2 years. Furthermore, the degradation in the local school district these past 4 years is a deep concern. For these reasons, we believe $80USD is a fair price for this property.”  Remember that price is not the only thing being negotiated. You can also get them to leave the appliance. Or hire painters. Or get the carpets replaced and inspected before sale. Or fix anything you found concerning in the safety / foundation inspection."
SocialEngineering,2y0nxn,Gorsum,6,Thu Mar 5 16:25:21 2015 UTC,"Unless you're paying cash, you will be required to get an appraisal for the loan - that's because the bank doesn't want to be lending you $200,000 on something that's only worth $80,000. All offers should be made contingent on appraisal -- i.e. if you offer $120, and the appraisal comes back to $110, then you aren't required to pay $120 - they can either lower their price to the appraised value or you both walk away.  This will help ensure (though not guarantee) that you will not end up paying too much for the place.  You also want to get the home inspected on your dime (should cost $100-200) by a qualified home inspector. He'll poke through the whole house looking for problems. Problems that he finds can be noted in the offer - - i.e., the inspector discovers that the water heater has rusted through and is leaking. The seller can either replace the water heater, or deduct the price of having it replaced from your offer so that you can replace it.  Carefully read the realtor's description of the house and be sure it's accurate. The realtor is just asking the homeowner about any features - if the homeowner is wrong, ether through lying or because he just doesn't know, then the description will end up wrong.  Example, when I bought my house it was advertised as having an insulated garage. Where I live, this means the walls, ceiling, and garage doors are insulated. Turns out only the walls had insulation - the homeowner added it when he drywalled the garage. the doors and ceiling weren't, and I knew I'd have to spend about $800 insulating them myself, so we asked for $800 to be taken off the price of the house. The homeowner then offered all the (very nice, very expensive) furniture on the porch as a tradeout for the garage insulation, which we were more than happy to jump on because we could never have re-furnished the porch for that price.   Basically, you're not really looking to use social engineering tactics - - you're dealing with realtors who have seen just about everything you can think of regarding trying to haggle a lower price, and you're dealing with lenders, who don't give a crap about your social engineering skills, and only care about the bottom line.  You're looking to pay a fair price for a house, and you're looking for things which can knock that price down. Even if I didn't care about the garage being insulated (I do, I work on my cars and it's cold out there) I would have wanted the money knocked off, because when I go to sell the house I'm going to be out that money myself.   You also need to be aware of the current real estate market where you are. If housing is in short supply, and there are a lot of buyers, you're not going to be able to negotiate below what the place is worth -- someone else will be more than happy to step in and offer more.   That brings me to my final tip: If you're financing it, arrange financing beforehand. If you have a letter that says you're pre-approved for a loan of up to X-dollars, you will have an edge over people who don't. We were actually the second highest bid on our house - but the guy who bid the highest had not arranged financing yet, so the seller accepted our offer because he didn't want to be in limbo wondering if the financing would come through. We were a sure thing, he wasn't, so he lost even though he'd have paid a fairly significant amount more than we offered."
SocialEngineering,2y0nxn,spyWspy,4,Thu Mar 5 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"Find and use your county assessor's web site.  It should list what price the house was bought at last and its neighbors.  The assessed value is useful but don't expect that price.  What you really want is how much other comparable properties in the same area where sold for.   Find out what the typical realtor commission is in your area.  Just because you aren't using one doesn't mean the seller isn't.  The price that it is listed at will have that commission factored into the price typically.  So in other word a typical house list price has +10% price for realtor commission. With that said with out a realtor you will need to make sure that you get an inspection of the house from a qualified service, get the age for the appliances, average heating, energy, and cooling cost, and etc.  Those won't necessarily be huge impacts in the price, but they may be negotiating areas.  It isn't always a one to one relationship.   For example, just because the fridge is old as dirt doesn't mean that the price should drop equivalent to the price of new fridge.  My finally piece of advise is your negotiating position changes a lot based on how long a place has been on the market, whether the owner is still living there or is paying two mortgages till that is sold, or how much they still have left on their loan. A lot of this information the realtor will be in a better position to get or know because they have been looking/showing these places for year.  Good luck."

SocialEngineering,2y0nxn,spacecataz,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"If a buyer's agent's take home commission is 1.5% of the sales price, he would make $15 extra by convincing you to spend $1000 extra. That is hardly the big incentive.  The buyer's agent does want you to buy the house, because otherwise they earn nothing. But the agents that stay in this business, are the ones that can find a steady stream of new clients. The most effective way of marketing for them is to get referrals from satisfied clients. Pushing buyers to buy houses they regret is not a long term strategy.  Approaching the sellers agent directly could work, but if you don't trust buyer's agents, I expect you to be wary of seller's agents that have a duty to only look out for the seller's interests.  Buyer's agents will earn nothing if you never buy a house through them. If you refuse to eventually commit to working exclusively with one agent for a reasonable length of time, a smart agent will have doubts that they will ever be paid.  Perhaps your outlook on real estate agents is a self fulfilling prophesy. No one good wants to help you because you told them you didn't want their help. If you do sign an agreement, but find out you really don't work well together, many contracts allow you an out by signing with another agent."

By that, I'm trying to highlight the mindset you have in your meeting.  If you aren't mentally in control, nothing else you do is going to matter.  If you have a charter from management to lead this meeting and you're sure they'll back you up on it, you should go into the meeting with that mindset.  If you're position of ""leadership"" is actually tenuous at best, then that's an underlying issue that's probably affecting the culture of the meeting. From a participation stand point, are the six listeners supposed to be participating? I.e. do they have constructive information that should be shared but isn't?  If so, you should be directly engaging them with questions.  ""Sally, what do you think about the widget situation?"" etc.  If they're there to absorb information and not provide it, you can still engage with them to make sure their understanding of the information is the same as yours. ""Bob, what do you think about Sally's suggestion?"" If you're dealing with sarcasm and blaming, I would recommend setting clear ground rules at the start of the next meeting, and then actively enforce them.  It will take people a few meetings to integrate the new rules into their behavior, but it'll happen.  ""Bob, I understand your frustrations with the situation, but this meeting is about how to move forward, not who got us here.  Given the situation as it stands today, what do you think we should do to fix the problem?""   ""Jane, let's save the sarcasm for the break room and focus on solving the problem right now.""

All the plans are identical (well, at least the 20-something contracts I looked up) within their timeframe/quarter. Like, plans change over time, but no one is getting a different deal than the company signed last week.  The emails included are only copies of orders filled online by those businesses.

Lastly is what I have to say. That matters only once you've actually been given or have taken an opportunity to open your mouth, but then that can also ruin things...

A lot of successful business people come from old money, not from their personal success. People dont really judge all the time and are usually preoccupied with worries that are more of a priority and doing mundane tasks on a sort of auto pilot. The dominant people in my social group usually dress nice only if there is a dress code, besides that they like being casual . Social engineering goes way beyond just words, timing is really important and the background of the people being targeted. If you are going in for an interview for a job, its because they need someone to help them make profits while getting paid amount below those profits, coming on as successful already can be threatening to managers or people in higher positions, dressing too nicely can have the opposite effect. Did you conduct this study ? Or are you just trying to defend it because you have been subjected to such visual scrutiny in some isolated events? People dress nice for several reasons, most are insecure, or showing off for potential sexual mates which they might come into contact  with unexpectedly (visuals are sexy) and some are just fashion enthusiasts. If anything, people judge your smell subconsciously at the first meeting and the tone in your voice. Anyone that has half a brain knows visuals can be faked as a signal."

SocialEngineering,2x53h7,HeliosRises,3,Thu Feb 26 00:22:06 2015 UTC,"The one who speaks first, in my experience, often controls the conversation.     No, it's a power-play thing. The person who speaks first is put into the position of asking something. So, if you speak first - even to ask about the weather - you're in the weaker position of trying to show respect to me. Imagine the dynamic if I sit there quietly for a couple beats before answering – how I respond to your answers determines my power level in our conversation.   Think of an Indian tribal chief, or walking into the Oval Office – powerful people do not greet every person who comes into their presence – instead, the weaker person waits for their turn to speak to the leader. This is the power dynamic you take into the meeting.   In Japanese culture there is a similar tradition to bowing – the first to bow is showing more respect to the other person, the one who bows deeper shows more respect, and it’s disrespectful not to bow if someone bowed to you. So, it’s not uncommon to see two businessmen doing a bow-off after a meeting because they’re both clamoring to not be disrespectful, and this almost-competition of humility can last several minutes. But - a ruler does not bow to his subjects.   It turns the conversation from a “collaboration” to a quid pro quo – and you’re asking for my something and I can say no. Once you open your mouth to talk about the weather, I say, “Yeah, it’s nice.” Now what? I sit here contemptuously waiting for you to start the meeting by you asking something of me. You’ve already open your mouth and acknowledged my presence, so it’s rude to waste my time and not ask something of me. The situation is now: you came to me to ask something of me, that's power - it's not ""us coming together"".  This parallels the whole Power of Silence dynamic."

That's why interrogations are so powerful, police asking questions and providing evidence to only ask further leading questions.  Of course you can ask questions back, and if you can make people question themselves, then a feedback cycle happens where people will adjust of their own accord. But it tends to align with what they already know and what/who they trust for information.  You see extreme examples of this in stockholm syndrome where entire environments are manipulated and people question themselves, and they start to believe their attacker.  But this is a perversity of when in normal multiple-people interactions, most people don't do us harm, or else we would all be dead."

The plot focuses on a prank caller who pretends to be a police officer and convinces the manager of a fast-food restaurant that one of her employees committed a crime, and gets her to carry out intrusive and unlawful procedures on the employee. It is based on the Bullitt County McDonald's strip search prank call scam.

The incidents involved a man calling a restaurant or grocery store, claiming to be a police officer and then convincing managers to conduct strip searches of female employees and to perform other bizarre acts on behalf of ""the police"". The calls were most often placed to fast-food restaurants in small towns located in rural areas of the United States.  Over 70 such occurrences were reported in 30 U.S. states until an incident in 2004 in Mount Washington, Kentucky (population 9,117), finally led to the arrest of David R.

On October 31, 2006, Stewart was acquitted of all charges in the Mount Washington case. He was suspected of having made other, similar scam calls.

SocialEngineering,2wowfd,kafka_esq,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:04:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah well that's a balance I think a lot of people tend to lose. In my eyes SE isn't about morals so much as learning to play the guitar is. It's teaching you how to better present yourself and read others to achieve your goals. What those goals are or what you do with them is a different matter.  While some naive fellows believe that simply having good intentions is enough it simply isn't. That's how marketing is done, and you need that in order to sell. But the truth is that you can't sell without a decent product. Ethics, goals and what you want to do with your life is a whole different question which I don't think is the point of SE. But sadly many people are too short sighted and only want SE to get into a baseball game for free or some shit like that.  Of course, I may have misread your comment. But if you're interested in ethics and where one's goals should be I recommend reading some philosophy. Albert Camus' Myth of Sisiphus and Kant's Metaphysics of the Morals are some great books on the subject matter. But I really recommend starting with the Oxford very short introduction books. They're a great start for getting a general picture of things (on almost any subject really)."

SocialEngineering,2wot9j,Deightine,5,Mon Mar 2 11:25:55 2015 UTC,"To 'social engineer' as a verb, you maneuver social activities toward a desired social outcome. As a teacher, you are not expected to covertly manipulate children, you've already been given a measure of authority. It's handed to the school when the parents drop them off and from the school's administrators to the individual teachers who will oversee them. You have the power to alter those children's environments to achieve a desired outcome. That's all you need much of the time, unless there are extended circumstances such as abuse, bullying, etc.  To do this once is easy... The kids are loud and rowdy, you know they are bored with the current curriculum, and you introduce something novel and interesting to draw attention to something you want them to learn. That is basic behavioral alteration, but it only nets you a regular pattern if you are consistent in applying the incentive material whenever they get bored. It also creates an expectation which you can then betray.   ""Mr. D always brings cookies to his classes on the Monday after tests that more than half of us pass. We just need to make it through this test, and I'll get a cookie. Sweet."" but when Monday rolls around and there are no cookies, they're resentful. If its because less than half passed, they'll resent the other students. If its because the teacher forgot to bring them, that was an act of betrayal. After all, why work so hard if there is no reward? This teaches a child to expect to be let down if it repeats. But if the cookies show up consistently, the student associates working hard with a reward.  It's actually a really bad methodology to use with young children because it can make them internally competitive, especially toward the 'weakest' performers. It's the same method used when one soldier gets out of line and their whole unit has to do pushups because of it... The group then, in private, corrects that soldier's social problem so they don't suffer the 'weak' one. Kids can already be complete jerks to one another, so its not a great approach unless you're a diehard supporter of survival of the fittest.  It's better to create a social feedback loop. Mentoring is a good example of this. Student shows interest, Mentor supplies a potentially scalable obstacle, Student scales it, and Mentor rewards them with a measure of open respect or a reward. Do this a dozen times and you create a higher achiever. The goal is getting them to show interest in the first place. You need to bait that interest. If you need examples that will titillate your more active brain parts, lets go with this clip from Good Will Hunting or this one from Finding Forrester.  Once you have a person hooked, their interest invested, as a single person or as a group... you distract them from the behavior you want to stop. Then you reward an existing behavior to make it more frequent, or offer a reward for a behavior you want started. Alternately, you can remove the stimuli bringing about the initial behavior you didn't want in the first place, but the outcomes are less predictable. Best of all worlds is to extinguish an old behavior by presenting a new one, discouraging the old behavior and encouraging the new one, until such a time as a person maintains the behavior on their own.  I could probably write a treatise on this... But I'll cut it down to this:  Learn this: ABC - Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence.  Then, here is a worksheet for homework."

Make sure these thoughts, consequences, and anything else is laid out to parents in a form that can be returned to you acknowledging that they know this will happen to their child if they don't behave properly in your class. May want to run it up your chain as well.  Encourage the parents to step in and seek their own solutions, as a teacher you can only enforce so much before the parents must help you."

If you screw over someone in the business world for a one time reward, that can easily come back to haunt you later on. Lying for an hour is easier than lying for a month is easier than lying for decades.  This isn't to say that shady tactics have no value in real world situations, just that they're more difficult to achieve things with and should not be relied on.  Also, we should take into consideration that Will's description of his own thought processes may be less than honest. He might have been playing for the cameras just as often as for the people he lived with in the house. When he claimed the fast was intended to test people's willpower, for example, that seemed like a new idea he'd just made up to himself afterwards - his initial descriptions of the fast said that it was intended to make himself seem like a leader."

Any winner should be a decent example too.  Russell Hantz (most notably in Samoa and Heroes vs. Villains)-if you ask a Survivor superfan, they will tell you he sucks at the game because of how rude he was to people. This is why he didn't win the jury vote at the end, but his ability to manipulate was bananas.  Tony Vlachos (Cagayan) -  He was a lot like Russell, but he did it without being too much of dick. He won.  Kim Spradlin (One World)  Boston Rob Mariano (most notably in All-Stars and Redemption Island)  Rob Cesternino (Amazon)  Jon ""Fairplay"" Dalton (Pearl Islands) - look up his ""grandma"" lie   Chris Daugherty (Vanuatu) - masterful player.

He's able to be either honest or dishonest when the situation calls for it without seeming unstable since he tries to make it a part of his smarmy charm.  makes up alliances while asking for advice on what to do so that they vote out the person he wants without him being the one directly responsible for the idea. one of his best strategies is participating in all the games they have to do but only doing well enough that he's seen as a valuable team member but not strong enough to be seen as a threat. His feigned vulnerability also includes making sure contestants that do see him as a threat are able to see him cry during the rare times he feels like it.  picks his battles so that he doesn't destroy bridges and not have long term success such as possible alliances for people who may not have liked him in the early part of the game but feel he's capable enough to be a necessary evil from using disarming complements with those he hates along with the aforementioned vulnerability play.  In the beginning, tests others with a one-day fast to see who has the most willpower. He seduces one of the girls who broke the fast first.   His biggest asset is coming off easy-going and comfortable with his flaws like he's playing the game for fun and not to win when it's really both."

If you don't, one of his key points that would help you the most in this case - people usually follow along with whatever one of their leaders / social groups believes or particpates in. Bernays was hired by tons of companies to market their stuff, and what he would do is find an influential organization or group that could be convinced to support the product, and then all of the followers would be convinced too (e.g. League of Women Voters, a church group, The Boy Scouts, etc.). In other words, it's much more efficient to convince a few key people who will spread the message to their networks through their influence than it is to try to get buy-in from the masses directly.  So for your case, identify the groups that are not familiar with you or aren't aligned, figure out who they look up to or respect (not difficult in a school setting), and dedicate your time to finding out how you can help them; in turn, they will help you out.

I think I do it more because of a philosophy than for the game-theory benefits: I believe that everyone is their own hero, doing what they wish to in the world because they believe that they are doing good. I personally think I do good and I believe there is beauty in my values, so I try to find what people see as the beauty in their own values. Doing it with more people makes me a more compassionate and empathetic person.   The only thing that really holds people back from exploring the people around them is dogma. I often feel uncertain and afraid of being outgoing because I'm afraid of rejection. The mitigating idea that has helped me most in fighting this fear is the notion that our biological imperative is to stay in a group of humans, so our fear of rejection is strong. Compared to an environment in which it would be a good idea to be insular to a social group and where rejection is a matter of life or death, our world has plentiful social capital with little repercussion for rejection. Instead, we can take a humanist approach in which we connect and share the existence of as many people as we please. It really is a wonderful time to be alive if you have that perspective."

SocialEngineering,2vgev0,stairmaster,5,Wed Feb 11 03:23:11 2015 UTC,"Friendship paradox:       The friendship paradox is the phenomenon first observed by the sociologist Scott L. Feld in 1991 that most people have fewer friends than their friends have, on average.  It can be explained as a form of sampling bias in which people with greater numbers of friends have an increased likelihood of being observed among one's own friends. In contradiction to this, most people believe that they have more friends than their friends have.   The same observation can be applied more generally to social networks defined by other relations than friendship: for instance, most people's sexual partners have had (on the average) a greater number of sexual partners than they have.

It's not like you can keep guard over her all night, or like you can intimidate every guy at the party, or like she can with high reliability prevent any guys from hitting on her or brushing up against her. Either accept it's inevitable she'll be hit on, or avoid the circumstances that make it inevitable. Decide what matters most to you based on your values, then make a choice about what to do.

The girl might be okay with what happened, but if her friends get a hold of the letter it's just going to make them more pissed off.

From what you've shared it seems like you got excited and accidentally hit her too hard. Take away this lesson, and remember it for as long as you live: ask permission. This girl probably should've told you to stop, but she sounds just as inexperienced as you. Seriously though, if you want to spank, choke, restrain, finger, eat out - pretty much anything other than kissing - just ask. It's not awkward. It won't break up the flow. It takes one second and it keeps your ass safe and the sex happy for everyone.   That being said, you need to apologize and explain yourself. Something as simple as, ""I got excited and tried to do something I saw in porn"" is all you need. In fact, the more simple the better. At this point you can't let shame over the fact that you watch porn or have sex stop you. While you apologize and explain what happened, it's best to have an adult that you trust with you. It will probably be best to arrange a conversation with your parents and her parents. It's going to be very embarrassing but the truth needs to come out so that this doesn't get worse for you or her.   More advice: don't send that letter. Doesn't matter what it says. Don't send it. Arrange to meet with her and her parents. If you don't want to go with your parents ask a coach or teacher or counselor you can be comfortable discussing all this with.   Final piece of advice: don't be having sex with someone while you're intoxicated on alcohol or weed or anything else, until you've had sex with this person sober a handful of times. Hooking up - even if the person is a good friend - while intoxicated is only asking for trouble. Someone could get hurt, catch a disease, or do something they're not entirely comfortable with, and sex is best when everyone involved is relaxed and comfortable."

Going into lots and lots of different environments gets you used to being alert, and eventually, being calmly alert. Travel, go to concerts for music you don't like, visit new bars, seek out anywhere with people that aren't 'your people'.   That said, if you're in the same environment, day after day, you can afford to zone out - and if you get even the slightest feeling something is wrong, even if you don't know why, then you act on it as soon as the feeling arises and assess wtf set you off later on. Your subconscious is picking up on millions of details that it doesn't bother to show to your conscious mind, and if you feel completely comfortable and at home, everything is most likely fine. It's only when you are having to tell yourself 'everything is fine, honest' that you're likely to be in danger. I've gone the long way home many times just because it felt like the right thing to do. It might feel silly, but not as silly as realising you've just walking into a street where a gang fight is just about to happen, and not as bothersome to the nerves as being the only person on a long street with someone larger than you walking a few yards behind and keeping pace.  BTW, contrary to the advice given in the article, I would never tackle that man with a gun.

Scanning, checking six, back to walls, and assigning a mnemonic to people so you can find anomalies is fairly standard behaviour for anyone who just likes to be aware.   The counting people, and remembering colours is something I never do on purpose (I associated people in my vicinity by their clothes by default) but I can see how focusing on it a little more could improve detection of hidden motives in certain areas. But I assume the reason it is not as natural as the other stuff is because noticing other peoples irregular activities can often cause problems.  e.g. Noticing someone nearby is not buying food at a restaurant, but buying some drugs off the cashier under the counter.   This info would make you more aware, but the mere fact they see you noticing may cause them to react."

Although some would argue the lines are awfully thin, apparently there is no line for people like you.

The subgroup could either initially go after the leader’s allies, in an attempt to weaken the leader, or if you think you are strong enough then go directly after the leader. So in the case of the male feminist, the moment he found out that they where plotting against him, the ideal target would be the transgender. The transgender is not really a woman, and he could dig up all sorts of nasty gossip about him, he then could have his own purge.  Personally I choose to avoid getting involved in groups ...   This is stupid beyond belief and sickening to boot. The last sentence doesn't surprise me, and I don't think it's a personal choice that makes it so you're not involved in any groups."
SocialEngineering,2v1st9,JiminyPiminy,5,Sat Feb 7 04:37:42 2015 UTC,"It doesn't particularly seem like a coherent analysis. Unfortunately, I think that ""social engineering"" is a term that draws the interest of a lot of people who fancy themselves undiscovered Machiavellis but aren't. Yes, it's quite possible to attempt power struggles with group leaders, and yes, it's quite possible to pick scapegoats if you're looking for a lightning rod, and no, there's not enough information to offer a germane analysis from a Jezebel article about a community meeting of Portland-based activists (but as a general rule, in such a group dynamic, a male feminist accused of rape generally won't earn back the trust of group members by spreading gossip about a trans person who's one of the people accusing them of rape). Different group types have different dynamics, and even mildly effective social engineering requires meaningful and inisghtful analysis of social groups. (There are definitely groups/contexts where it'd work pretty well to find a scapegoat, though long term that approach tends to lead to the destruction of one's group as a force in the world--there's no free lunch for the careless.)  There are enough short-sighted, cruel, malicious people out there who can socially engineer for temporary or local profit, but I respectfully submit that being them isn't always fun."

SocialEngineering,2v191w,IDontWantANewUser,1 point,Sat Feb 7 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"No, the real trick isn't practicing your own standup comedy or even comedy in general. What you need to do, what you must do, is to learn to speak from someone else's position of authority.   Listen to a group of comedians from your region - this is important as your more localized word choices will be present in the initial stages. Lets suppose you live in the southern United States on the coast from North Carolina all the way down to say Texas you would listen to Ron White, Bill Engvall, and Ralphie May. These comedic choices were not arbitrary they were chosen because of their penchant for telling stories and finding comedy in their life stories as well as their dialect conservation for the aforementioned reason.   The website Pandora works exceptionally well for this, start listening to the selected stand up comedians and after a few days you will being to recognize specific stories keep listening until you can begin to speak the stories as the comedian speaks them. Now, you can do this with any great speakers Reagan, Kennedy, M.L. King and the like; however, speeches of those context will not often be useful in causal conversation.   Now as you get to the point where you can say the vast majority of the words with the comedian being copying their inflection in their voice, the tone, and cadence; the word choice also warrants looking at however with our base choices of local comedians the word choice should be relatively transferrable. Once you can deliver the joke adequately enough that you can tell a comedian's joke to friends begin copying the stylistic choices (tones, inflections, and cadence ) of the comedian in your own stories. This will have to be done gradually and always mixed with two or three comedic stylings so you don't come off as a carbon copy.    Depending on your audience you will have to alter your verbal delivery style - for instance a board meeting is not the place for me to act like Dave Chapelle or Lewis Black - as well as diction choices.  There are a couple more tips for those who have done the above but its early and I'm catching a flight in a couple of hours."

SocialEngineering,2uw6k6,equippe,9,Thu Feb 5 18:06:09 2015 UTC,"they are absolutely not thinking about whether apple cares about being defended, obviously. Corporations market 'lifestyles' (especially Apple) so that people identify (or identify who they want to be / think they are) with the product and become repeat buyers.  I'd guess people who go on the defensive are particularly sensitive to this and instead of hearing a corporation be criticised, they're hearing it as disparaging the chosen lifestyle / values that led them to pick that corporation in the first place.  I'm new to this sub as well and still know very little. But, at a guess, potentially a way around it would be to fish for (or just guess) what values they perceive in the brand, and try and start your critique with 'Apple likes to act like they're so Y but they're not because X'.  I don't have any book recs yet either but I hope some other people add some. This is an interesting topic."
SocialEngineering,2uw6k6,jniamh,7,Thu Feb 5 18:42:30 2015 UTC,"I think it was the guys from Penny Arcade who talked about people defending and arguing over consoles and how it came down to not wanting to be wrong. If you can only afford to buy one console you want to buy the best one. So people will argue over and defend their choice not because they think Microsoft is better than Sony but because they bought an Xbox and don't want to be wrong in there decision. Being a fan boy of anything comes down to trying to reassure yourself about your decisions. I like Xbox and Xbox is better so I'm better. I like movie star A so what they did wasn't wrong, or else I'd like someone who did something wrong, and I'd never do that so, what they did wasn't wrong."
SocialEngineering,2uw6k6,mick14731,2,Thu Feb 5 21:53:43 2015 UTC,"I have the same thoughts as well, yep. It's about defending whatever you invested yourself in. However, I'm interested in why are those feelings so strong.  Think about the investment / defense ratio. You buy a disposable product (phone, console, whatever) or you attach yourself to a celebrity and their world view...ok....fair enough. Why are you willing to go thru the fire to prove to others that you made the right decision? If someone challenges your investment, we all know how it ends, you will label that someone a hater. But that's a whole another story.   It baffles me to see how hardcore people can get over seemingly menial and trivial things. Fascinating, really."
SocialEngineering,2uw6k6,mick14731,2,Thu Feb 5 22:07:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's a couple of things, firstly nobody notices the vast majority who don't care or will let it go so it seems like a bigger thing than it is and I also think people will chase a victory no matter how trivia. On top of that people will attach themselves to the success of the product or person. It seems like everyone on Reddit is pulling for DiCaprio to win an Oscar, if he dose a bunch of people will feel a little bit of that victory. It doesn't make sense but it is what it is."
