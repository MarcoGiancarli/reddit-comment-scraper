OneTrueBiribiri,3e3nt0,RozenMaidenFanClub,5,Tue Jul 21 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"I'm awful at descriptions, sorry!  During the elimination phase, you voted through all the characters you wanted in the brackets. If I recall correctly, there were about 4000 entrants or some crazy number like that. Anyway, for a bracket to work, it needs to be a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32...)  So, the elimination phase narrowed the entrants down to, I think, 512 entrants. The seeding is determined by how many times that character was voted on from the elimination round. 1st seed is generally the most popular and has a high chance of winning. This is because it was voted on by the most people to progress through to the main bracket.  Here is an example of a completed bracket (mine!) There were 90 entrants, it needed to be cut down to 64 (power of 2). The small number next to their picture is their seed. In this example, Biribiri is 1st seed, Last Order is 2nd seed and Accelerator is 3rd seed. Whereas, minor characters like Unabara (64th seed) and Juufuku (63rd seed) didn't rank very high but still beat out the 26 entrants who didn't make it past the elimination round.  Phew!"

OneTrueBiribiri,3bxpr3,spanishmonkey,6,Fri Jul 3 02:35:21 2015 UTC,Understood.
OneTrueBiribiri,3bxpr3,Hdloser,2,Fri Jul 3 03:26:10 2015 UTC,Accelerator's va was another low point in the dub.
OneTrueBiribiri,3bxpr3,Hdloser,8,Fri Jul 3 07:07:54 2015 UTC,I actually enjoyed Austin as Accelerator. He had this quiet insanity about him that fit his character.
OneTrueBiribiri,3bxpr3,literallyallah,5,Fri Jul 3 12:48:47 2015 UTC,He had less voice direction than the sisters. Sometimes I literally could not figure out who he was talking to if there were multiple people.

OneTrueBiribiri,3b3t65,Racecar_Driver,7,Thu Jun 25 19:51:37 2015 UTC,That makes me wonder. If some people have thousands of pictures of Biri Biri on their computers. I wonder about Kuroko's Biri Biri folder.
OneTrueBiribiri,3b3t65,jonythunder,5,Thu Jun 25 20:29:08 2015 UTC,"I feel as though having a thousand or more just proves you're saving every picture you see.  I have a lot, but not nearly that many.  Then again, if you're Kuroko.."
OneTrueBiribiri,3b3t65,Locusts,4,Thu Jun 25 21:37:43 2015 UTC,"Or... you could be me and use a script to download the entire redditbooru repository of pics with the tag biribiri/railgun/misaka mikoto/etc and have them displayed automatically as background, changing every 10 minutes...  Never let together a nerd and a weeaboo. It's not going to end well"

Do you really have to use the term ""weeaboo"" though?  I'm not insinuating you're using it on anyone in particular, but it is derogatory after all.."
OneTrueBiribiri,3b3t65,Locusts,4,Fri Jun 26 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"Words have exactly as much power as you give them. For instance, whenever people ask what my friends and I are playing when we play Weiss Schwarz, we tell them we're playing weeb cards. We will regularly call each other ""fucking weebs"" jokingly. Don't put to much stock into the opinions of people who would try to ruin your reputation just for watching anime."
OneTrueBiribiri,3b3t65,Undecided_User_Name,3,Fri Jun 26 01:29:12 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Also, come on, let's face it. In this world filled with people who only watch CSI/Hawai 5-o/etc, we are the ones who are different, who dare to think unlike the norm, who dare to question what society claims we should see.  Do my tastes fall under the tag of weeaboo? Indeed. But I ""wear"" that word with pride, because it means I'm a free thinker, a free spirit, someone who values more what he likes than what society demands he like.  Don't be afraid of the word weeaboo! Wear it as a badge of honor, for you are special, you are different than other people, and in this world of ours where society dictates what we must do/like/watch/play, we are the only ones who are free!  Unless you are a 10 yo who just got into anime thanks to naruto/one-piece/bleach/etc and go ranting about how so much better anime made the last season is so much better than anime made before. In that case, you're not a weeaboo, you're a dumbass :p"
OneTrueBiribiri,3b3t65,jonythunder,3,Fri Jun 26 01:40:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think I, personally, would take it that far. I still like Western shows, it's more, for me at least, that anime has a wider selection more easily accessible. For instance, I have yet to find an anime that would compare to Star Trek TNG. If you think about it, any given anime is like Firefly, but with the option of reading the source material when it doesn't get another season."
