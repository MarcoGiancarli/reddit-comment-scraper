Hedgehog,3e159x,valeriekim86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:50 2015 UTC,Thank you!   I was absolutely devastated when I found the dog in the room with him and his tub rooted through. But since we left the vet he's been acting like nothing happened at all. He wants to run and climb and be the cranky mamma's boy he was before.
Hedgehog,3e159x,valeriekim86,2,Tue Jul 21 06:27:04 2015 UTC,Well that's really good to hear!!!
Hedgehog,3e159x,99drumdude,2,Tue Jul 21 06:28:27 2015 UTC,"Hedgehogs are hardy as hell. Theyre tough little suckers. Between falling off things and taking on animals 100 times bigger than them, idk any other pets that could pop back from something like that"
Hedgehog,3e159x,Mlmkiniry,3,Tue Jul 21 12:57:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed! One of mine, much to my horror, fell off the kitchen counter, gave himself a shake,and then cruised away like it was nothing.  They are very durable! OP, I am glad he is fine!  Keep an eye on the wound for signs of infection.  I would do daily foot baths just to be on the safe side."
Hedgehog,3e159x,Mlmkiniry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:13 2015 UTC,I'd like to but he has stitches in his rear and I need to keep those dry. I'm worried he might try and scratch with wet paws.
Hedgehog,3e159x,Mlmkiniry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:41 2015 UTC,Maybe baby wipes?  That way you can remove his poop boots and keep his feet dry?
Hedgehog,3e159x,Mlmkiniry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:16 2015 UTC,That seems more feasible.

Hedgehog,3e159x,MoreWeight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"I appreciate it. My biggest worry right now is him eating. He's been doing it, but in very small amounts. By pure coincidence I got the food he was fed by the breeder, so he should be used to it and hopefully the change won't be too stressful on him considering the timing. Just nobody near me sells what I normally feed him. Everything else seems fine. I can tucker him out letting him run around my room since I've taken out his wheel until the wounds heal and he's drinking fine."

Hedgehog,3e370j,Misguidedx,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:37 2015 UTC,"Hedgehogs are defensive by nature, and they use defensive behaviors (raised quills, huffing, popping/clicking) to try to intimidate perceived threads (i.e. you) so they'll be left alone. It's not that he's ""terrified"", it's a strategic attempt to control the relationship and make you go away. You have to completely ignore it so he learns that it isn't effect, which particularly means being confident and hands-on with your interactions. Also, if the cage is large, make sure to fill at least 3/4 of the total space - hedgehogs like clutter, and too much open space can cause more defensive behaviors because they feel exposed. Other than that, it can take a few weeks of confidence handling for a hedgehog to get over the period of exaggerated defensiveness that comes with a transition to a new place."
Hedgehog,3e370j,VolcanoView,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:41 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that's normal behavior. My hedgie never really huffed even from the beginning but the more time you spend with it the more comfortable it will become. Just takes lots of patience, confidence and consistency. And love!!!"
Hedgehog,3e370j,valeriekim86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"he doesnt know who you are yet. What i would recommend is placing a shirt that smells like you in the cage with him. Make sure he doesnt get his feet caught in teh fabric, but it will let him acclimate to you. THen you have to still ahndle him despite the hissing so he gets use to it."

Hedgehog,3dsqrw,VolcanoView,3,Sun Jul 19 04:47:03 2015 UTC,"Vet immediately. Emergency vet right this second if at all possible.  It's called a proptosed eye, which is when some sort of inflammation/swelling causes pressure that pushes the eye out of the socket. It can be caused by anything from a scratch or some sort of debris in the eye, to an interior tumor pushing up behind it. The latter is much less likely, but regardless of the cause, it needs immediate treatment in order to have any chance of saving the eye. It may end up needing to be surgically removed. The vet should prescribe an eye ointment, antibiotic, and painkiller/antiinflammatory, and also you'll probably be given a sterile saline solution to rinse it with several times a day. If it stays out like that for too long, it will either shrivel up or the hedgehog will dig it out from discomfort, both of which would then require a surgical procedure to remove what's left and stitch it shut."
Hedgehog,3dsqrw,VolcanoView,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:19:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, we took him in and it seems the best course of action is removal. He'll be spending the night at the emergency vets office and surgery will be tomorrow or Tuesday"
Hedgehog,3dsqrw,VolcanoView,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:02 2015 UTC,Good luck! Fortunately it's a fairly simple procedure and the outcome is usually very good. They don't have any trouble getting around as normal with one eye. I have a girl who went a year with one eye and recently lost her other.

Hedgehog,3dog21,lleef725,5,Fri Jul 17 22:57:46 2015 UTC,"Hedgehogs aren't social animals; she's never going to seek you out. The relationship is what you make of it. It's normal for her to seek out some sort of shelter when out with you; use that as an excuse to get some cuddling with her, instead of being disappointed by it. Handle her with direct hands-on interaction, as well as more indirect methods (like snuggling in a sleeping bag, or toting her around in a carry bag over your shoulder) whether she seems indifferent, or even defensive. If you're busy a lot of the time, use the indirect methods to get in time with her when you're doing other things, but try to get at least 30 minutes of direct handling in each day (less is fine if you're getting plenty of indirect, but ideally you should be doing both daily). Ignore any defensive behaviors; it doesn't sound like she's very defensive at all, but it's worth reiterating that point. Leaving her alone or acting timid when she acts defensive (balling up, huffing, quills raised, etc) just reenforces the behaviors. You can use a playpen to give her some enrichment while not worrying about her getting under furniture and whatnot - either a fold-up fence style, or something like a plastic kiddy pool. Add in her wheel, some hideaways and toys, PVC pipe, and whatever else; the more clutter the better, as a lot of open space will trigger that hiding reflex. Other than that, try to remember that your expectations should be realistic for this kind of pet - they make wonderful companions in their own way, but they aren't social like dogs are, so you only get as much out of it as you put into it."
Hedgehog,3dog21,VolcanoView,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:31:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply!  I read so much about how they weren't dog-like before I got her, but then when it didn't seem like the bonding was getting any easier, I wondered if I was doing something wrong.  I like the idea of the enrichment pen... are there any toys your hedgies really enjoy?  She likes her toilet paper tube and crinkly mylar cat toy, but hasn't really warmed up to cars and balls and random stuff."
Hedgehog,3dog21,VolcanoView,2,Mon Jul 20 22:47:58 2015 UTC,"Ours like a lot of clutter, and will bulldoze and push things around. PVC pipe, different kinds of hideaways (both plastic and fabric), foam tubes (like TP tubes but better), rubber ducks, various small rubber toys (including squeaky toys and toddler bath toys), small plushies and pillows, cuddle buddies, sleeping bags, dig box with fleece strips or smooth aquarium stones inside, mini porcupine balls, random chunks of discarded boxes/cardboard they can mess with (though they quickly need to be discarded), and so on."
Hedgehog,3dog21,valeriekim86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:32:24 2015 UTC,It takes time and patience! I think I lucked out with Fiddlesticks but she rarely huffs and I don't think she even knows how to put her quills up cause she's so comfortable with us. But we spend anywhere from 1-4 hours with her a day. And in the beginning when she did huff I would just keep petting her till she stopped and now she just doesn't bother lol

The largest of hedgehogs do great with 11"" bucket wheels, and 12"" cake cover wheels are the next size up; you can find both of those here. Unless you're talking a different species of hedgehog (such as if you're located in the Middle East), larger than 12"" isn't necessary. If you're wanting something larger because a 12"" store-bought wheel doesn't work well, that has more to do with the width being too narrow."

Hedgehog,3d0s1t,bonez656,3,Sun Jul 12 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"Experienced breeder here. 69g is a serious problem. He needs a high fat diet (minimum 18% fat). Since you have Royal Canin available, look for the ""Mama and Babycat"" formula to help him put on weight. He's about 1/3 the appropriate size for a weaned baby, and unfortunately a lot of times babies sent to new homes that small end up dead because the new owner doesn't realize it.  Can you PM me? I'm currently on my phone and can't easily type long paragraphs, but will get back to you as soon as possible with more information."

Hedgehog,3d0s1t,kemekokitten,2,Mon Jul 13 05:01:43 2015 UTC,"Don't use litter, and if you can't use other shavings just stick to fabric lining the cage. I use care fresh but I'd rather fabric lining I just don't have access to a washer and dryer as often as he needs cage changed. All other bedding the carefresh and wood shavings can get into their eyes, penile sheath, and dust in their lungs. Majority of poop from hedgies come from when they run on their wheel. Not saying they can't be litter trained, but I wouldn't focus so much on him pooping in just one spot. Heck my guy pooped in his water dish once. =(  As for food, lots of websites says what % of fat and protein they need. That's what your looking for. Some hedgehogs over eat, and some don't. You said it seems like he isn't eating a lot and that's fine. I believe it was about 2 tablespoons a day for an adult hedgehog. So if he doesn't over eat that it's fine.   Stick with bowl for water, some don't mind the bottles but they can drink more if it's in a bowl.   Handle him everyday, for at least 30min to and hour if you can. If you have them out longer just make sure they have access to water if they need it. Temperature wise they like about 20c/68f to 25c/77f. They like to sleep during the day, so allow them to see natural light if possible. It help keeps them on a schedule.   They occasionally needs baths, you guy is young he will go through quilling. Read up on how to help them. My suggestion is organic oatmeal in warm water (not to hot or cold). They need foot baths more often, just a small tray of water, let them run through to clean their paws. Make sure they are dry, hedgies can get I'll easy with a breeze. So if it's windy in you house put up a partial wall on the side of the cage to help reduce air flow, not so much that they lack air though.   Edits: many of them. I could only remember so much and I'm on a phone. When I'm on pc I will check for spelling errors."
Hedgehog,3d0s1t,kemekokitten,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:42:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'll cut out some triangles of fleece for the litter and see how he does with that.   The food is 37% / 12% and 19.6% / 14.9% Protein to fat which averages to 28.3% protein, and 13.45% fat. Does that sound about right?  Bowl is definitely the way to go he hasn't touched the bottle.  Handling is no problem, I've been putting him on my chest when I'm laying down and just using the computer and he seems to like it he gets to run around and explore my bed (I'm careful not to let him fall off i know they have bad eyesight.) My room has two windows (south and west facing and gets lots of light during the day).   I've read about quilling. I'll keep an eye out for it happening. I have to run the A/C 24/7 or else it would be far too hot in the house for him (and me) day time temps are >100 most days so he gets some breeze when he is on the wheel but I have his bedding area blocked off."

Hedgehog,3d0s1t,tilyd,2,Sun Jul 12 17:06:13 2015 UTC,"Okay got you, I'd put that down and make sure the edges are covered. If you can come across one, and cheap good idea for a cage is plastic bins:  http://www.oocities.org/heartland/hills/1514/cage1.gif  I use one for my hedgie, it helps me moderate his temperature, I live in Canada so it's often below 20c 8 months out of the year. Also no open edges or places their feet can get stuck."
Hedgehog,3d0s1t,tilyd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:12:56 2015 UTC,"I dislike the bins, I wanted something with more airflow because I'm way more concerned with cooling than I am heating."
Hedgehog,3d0s1t,meofcoursenot,2,Sun Jul 12 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah and when I says 10-15% fat, it doesn't mean you have to be at 15%. My hedgie likes to chill so I have to lower his fat intake or he gains to much weight. Play it by ear the fat content. I was told if you pick them up and they can't ball into a tight ball, your hedgie is over weight. Meal worms are fine too."
Hedgehog,3d0s1t,tilyd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I'll stick with it though and just monitor him he seems to need the weight gain from what /u/tilyd says."
Hedgehog,3d0s1t,DavidFrattenBro,3,Sun Jul 12 17:17:40 2015 UTC,"Your off to a good start! In regards to his food though, your hedgie is still small (probably smaller than he should be at 69g :/ ) so the amount of fat in your blend is probably good till he is full grown. After though, I would consider dropping the fat content to about 12%, which is pretty standard I believe. Also, don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure dog food isn't recommended because in the long run it to too hard for their teeth and can damage them. Typically, on here at least, most people go for a cat food because it it smaller, less hard, and easier to chew. I personally use dry blue buffalo weight control chicken blend for cats, which has 12% fat and 36% protein.  Also, my hedgie eats about 2 tablespoons of food a day, which I give to him around 9pm and he eats thoughout the night and the next day."
Hedgehog,3d0s1t,lifesatunnel,3,Sun Jul 12 17:41:51 2015 UTC,Both the foods are cat foods. The brand is royal canine but they make both cat and dog foods. I'll keep an eye out for other food options.
Hedgehog,3d0s1t,Wubalubdubdub,2,Sun Jul 12 17:44:06 2015 UTC,"Your food mix seems okay, I'm not sure how much they should eat every day but make sure he always have food. He's very tiny for his age (mine weighted about 200 grams at 2 months), you can give him live mealworms/superworms to help him gain weight.  For your litter, try putting a pan under his wheel instead, hedgehogs mostly poop and pee while running so it will help keep your cage clean. For mine I use puppy training pads instead of bedding, I think it's easier to clean and it's easier to see if there's any problem with your hedgie (like blood in the urine or things like that).   The coroplast / futureboard is better inside the cage, so he cannot get his toes stuck in the bars and hurt himself. It's also easier to clean that way. You can use zip ties to fit it.  Also, hedgehogs like when their cages are very cluttered, you could add some stuff to fill in the open areas, like a pvc pipe (4"") and maybe a little blanket or cuddle sack! :)"

Hedgehog,3d06eq,tilyd,2,Sun Jul 12 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"I use carefresh as a floor to the habitat and a tray of ""Yesterday's News"" litter under his wheel. It's just little pellets which are significantly more quiet and easier to clean up after than some other brands of non-clumping litter."

Fleece bedding is a good option since it's pretty cheap to go to the fabric store and get a bunch and cut it up into pieces, plus it's washable and reusable.   I've also seen people mix bedding by using wood chips/paper bedding near their wheel and where they're most active, then fleece in their food/sleeping area."

Fleece is super easy. I put a towel down with fleece over top. I just throw it in the wash once a week after shaking all the poops off. Then I grab a clean one and lay it down. Super quick. She mostly poops and pees on her wheel though, and I have a pan under her wheel to catch stray poops so generally her fleece stays pretty clean beside food crumbs and occasional poop and pee.  Also for washing fleece, I use unscented dye free detergent, and sometimes add a bit of white vinegar.  I use yesterday's news cat litter for the litter box."

Hedgehog,3cz2q9,Betwixt_Between,4,Sun Jul 12 02:14:08 2015 UTC,"For dry skin in general, including the ears, Humilac spray is the best remedy. You can also use various oils - coconut oil works well applied directly, and some other ones (flaxseed, olive, etc) can be added to the rinse water after a bath. Of the various oils, I prefer coconut, but Humilac is definitely the best option out of everything.  For just the tatters on her ears, you can use any of those, or something like bag balm or vaseline. Massage it into the edges of the ears daily - it will soften the tatters and they'll eventually come off."
Hedgehog,3cz2q9,VolcanoView,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:52:21 2015 UTC,Thank you for all the advice! I guess I was mainly concerned with the tatters; poor girl :( I have coconut oil and vaseline at home; although I am not familiar with Humilac spray. I will find it for Nettle!

Hedgehog,3cpved,Zullwick,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:05:24 2015 UTC,I'd agree with that but it's not an answer being asked. It's asking whether they stick to one burrow or generally will wander and build/find a new burrow almost daily.
Hedgehog,3cp9e6,skibbityboo,9,Thu Jul 9 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"I would say no. One of the biggest reasons is that hedgehogs need a heat source to keep their cage at a constant warm temperature. If you stop with the hedgehog in your car, what would you do with it? Also, I am not sure how constant travel would affect a hog, but my guess would be not well. My hedgehog is ok with 2 hour-ish rides up to my family's cottage, but more than that she gets antsy (she's in smaller cage for travel, I don't know how a big cage would do in the event of a minor collision or something) Not sure if hotels would like having hedgehog guests, and you'd have to check all of the places you travel to allow hedgehogs (I believe there are some states/municipalities that don't allow them, but I'm Canadian so don't quote me)  There's probably more reasons but those would be more than enough to dissuade me if I were in your position."

Hedgehog,3cidvh,thisbusisempty,3,Wed Jul 8 03:38:40 2015 UTC,Let me huff and scuffle at you to remind you im not here
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,dylanbalde,2,Wed Jul 8 16:08:24 2015 UTC,"Potty training isn't too hard! DDoS learned fairly quickly. Every time I would clean her poop I would leave a piece two inside the litter box and move her to it so she could see it was in there. Also every time she would be out and about to poop I would plop her in her  litter box so she could do it there.   Im a super clean freak as well and what I do to minimize poop mess it use liners that i made as bedding instead of loose bedding, and every morning I pick up her poop since its easy to see and pick off the fabric and change the liner and put it in the wash every 5-7 days. Also when I let her out for a bit to walk around or go in her ball I give her a bit of a warm up. When they wake up their metabolism speeds up and they let go of their poop(hence why they poop while they run) I let her run back and forth in a spot or my hands until she poops a few times and pees, then after I let her loose. She never makes a mess as long as I let her warm up enough. Also to reduce the amount of poop on her wheel I do the warm up thing at night before I go to bed, that way she doesn't have as much poop to poop out while she runs in her wheel. Another thing, if you have a saucer instead if a wheel the poop is more likely to get stepped in and mashed in her pee vs a wheel. I've found that in a wheel it falls to the floor unlike the saucer. If you have a bucket wheel just put a litter pan at the bottom and it will catch all the poop that falls off.   Her pooping while she runs is inevitable so you will get a slight mess every morning but you can do the stuff I mentioned and it will reduce it. Every morning I clean up her poop with a baggie, wash her wheel if its bad, empty the litter, and check her feet. If her feet are a bit caked I put her in a pan of warm water and rub it off. Poop that gets caked on her feet is usually from it getting stuck at the bottom of her claws/nails. If you keep them well trimmed and cut then it shouldn't get cakes on as much.   With cleaning her, her wheel, tank, and litter I spend 10-15 minutes every morning. Its not long at all and I love seeing her and her space clean :)"
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,serenitysanctum,2,Wed Jul 8 19:14:54 2015 UTC,"Some can be neater than others, but in my experience, yeah, they shit like horses. They get better over time at controlling it, but they shit on their wheel and run through it and you have to clean it ALOT (carolina storm bucket wheel saved my life because its so much easier to clean) Their poops are also the consistency of human poops; mushy logs and not pellets so if its fresh, it is wet, hard to clean up and it can stankkkk."
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,HeyHowdyHeyImOnAYoyo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:04:17 2015 UTC,"Oh shit (pun intended lol), really? D: It's wet? Some of the owners I've talked to said their hedgies' poops are dry; like they only become wet when the hedgehogs are sick or frightened."
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,nivlheimPL,2,Fri Jul 10 16:59:19 2015 UTC,"Healthy hedgehog's poop will be dry indeed. It's really easy to clean, becouse it's not smearing around - you simply pick it up."
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,HeyHowdyHeyImOnAYoyo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:03:22 2015 UTC,"not wet so much as moist... kind of reminds me of a humans poop.... ""soft serve ice cream"" but slightly less wet lol."
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,kmullins131,3,Sun Jul 12 05:59:58 2015 UTC,"Our hedgy pooped a lot for the first few months we had her, every time we would get her out to play she would poop. But now she never poops when she is out. But in their home they poop a lot. I don't know if other hedgehogs do this but ours poops on her running wheel. I wake up and there is poop all along the inside of the wheel, its like she poops and then just keeps running. So I clean it every day. Also since they poop so much you will need to clean her home out every week or two depending on how big it is.   Tldr: pooping machines"
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,ClockworkCow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, a poopy wheel is the daily delight in our house. We did have frequent escapee behaviour, where she'd wriggle out the pen somehow and gleefully crap all over the apartment, presumably doing a drop-dead-fred just to be annoying.  Now, the wee darling, while wandering about, always tends to go in the same two corners in the apartment, both of which are hidden and dark. Yes, the fearsome size makes my eyes water, just thinking about it, but she's consistent so it's less about me toilet training her, but more about me, putting paper down in her happy place."
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,PlayaD,2,Wed Jul 8 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"I just got mine last week and she shits everywhere and there's a ton of it. And yes, they shit all over the wheel too. I just cleaned mine last night and it's already covered in shit again. She shit on my couch last night and then pissed on it so it started to spread the shit. Definitely didn't realize this would be an issue before I got her. She also gives 0 fucks about her litter box and has shit everywhere in the cage but in it."
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,99drumdude,2,Wed Jul 8 22:43:05 2015 UTC,"Nah. Maible is pretty good at holding her poops. If i let her run around she might find a good spot to pop a squat so i always keep an eye on her just in case. Shes been out for hours before without poopin.   You can tell shes about to let'er rip when her tail starts to poke up. If you grab her then, then she'll stop before anything comes out, then ill just put her in her cage to do her business."
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,Zillibean,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"So true. You can tell if they are gonna poop cuz that little tail stands straight out.  Also, 9/10 times my little guy will go in his litter box when I put him in it.  Yes he poops everywhere at night, wheel included but he's feet are oddly clean in the morning."
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,99drumdude,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:45:14 2015 UTC,Hmm is his poop dry or wet? Dry poop is definitely easier to clean than wet ones.
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,prettyx2pwnies,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:01:29 2015 UTC,Is there also a warning for when they're about to pee? Also is their poop dry or wet?
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,SonicFlash01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:00:48 2015 UTC,Ehh they do a little squat when they pee but they usually do both at the same time. Their poops are dry and dense and easy to pick up. They dry completely pretty fast and get hard. Cleanup is easy
Hedgehog,3ckbsu,SonicFlash01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:02:47 2015 UTC,"I've been taking care of my roommates hedgehog for a few months now and the pooping has gotten a lot better. When we got her we think she was about 4 months old, and she did pop a lot more than she does now. We also have been fairly diligent in litter training her. She still goes on her will occasionally (especially on days when we don't get her out to play) but she is pretty consistent about peeing in her little litter box, which is the really smelly part. We started training her by watching her very carefully and moving her into the box when she was about to do her business, but that was going very slowly, so we picked up a container of freeze dried crickets and started rewarding her when she went in her box, that sped things up quite a bit.  tl;dr: It takes some diligence but you can train them. They poop more when they are young and while getting used to a new smell/new place."
Hedgehog,3clpra,Jailbroken_iPod_4G,2,Wed Jul 8 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"I would call your vet personally and see why they can't see him. I understand they can be busy, but that seems a bit odd that they'd just refuse with out any help."

Hedgehog,3clpra,breeps,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"Hi there, sorry to hear about your hedgehog. You will have to visit the vet to get a proper diagnosis and its probably the sooner the better to avoid further injuries from the leg not working.   That being said, Ollie has been having similar symptoms and I have take her to 3 different vets in the past few months.   There are a few things that can be going on. If your hedgie has a wheel she could have fallen off and damaged her leg or even it's spine. You might want to take a trip to the vet and see if you can get some x-rays done or see if the leg has been hyper extended.   If it's been hyper extended some anti inflammation drugs should do the trick. A back injury will probably require shots in the back fat from something like Onsior. It won't fix the problem bit it will aleviate some of the symptoms.  Sadder possibilities could be anything from having a stroke to a brain tumor or WHS. WHS usually starts in the hind legs but not always. Simple things could be a string or hair wrapped around the leg. Check and make sure there is not anything cutting off circulation. If there is something wrapped aound it's leg do not take it off yourself, there could be a blood clot in there or something depending on how long its been like that.  The only way you're going to get answers is visit the vet. I wish you the best of luck and hope your hedgehog has a speedy recovery. Sorry I couldn't be more help."

I take him from his cage often and let him sleep in there while I go downstairs or something. I found him and this large amount of white foam next to him. Is this from anointing? Or was he just horny? Or what is this?  I'm doing research now, but I know there are some experts here that could have some insight.  EDIT: The power also went off in my house (and surrounding area) so it may have got too hot in the room if that affects anything."

It's reassuring to hear that you see improvement even after the first year, so I have high hopes that she'll warm up even more to me. I guess maybe I was underestimating how happy she would be with some solo time. As somewhat of an introvert myself, I can understand that! Thank you for sharing your experiences.

When he's fully woken up, he jumps out of it before I get to stretch him out fully. It's really silly and makes me giggle because his arms are stretched forwards and legs backwards, makes him look like a superhero. Superhog."

Hedgehog,3c644h,IndorilMiara,3,Sun Jul 5 04:39:48 2015 UTC,"Treats and fresh foods aren't at all necessary, as long as you're using a food that meets the requirements, and many hedgehogs have no interest in anything but kibble. You're more likely to have luck with insects and meats than with vegetables, usually. Some of the more popular options you can try are watermelon, sweet potato, meat baby foods, scrambled eggs, Gerber meat sticks, unseasoned cooked meats, bacon, and this treat mix (designed for even very picky hedgehogs and often called ""hedgie crack""). For insects, live crickets and superworms are more effective ""gateway"" insects to introduce them to the idea of eating/hunting bugs.  That being said - the food you're using is drastically too high in both fat and protein. You'll want to switch as soon as possible to something that has correct percentages - under 15% fat (10-12% works best for most adults) and 30-33% protein (absolutely no higher than 35%). Long-term use of a food too high in fat and/or protein leads to unhealthy body weight, organ strain, fatty liver disease, and particularly problems with the liver and kidneys - overall a lot of health issues and shorter lifespan. This list will help you pick a food, or mix of several, that more closely fits the requirements."

Hedgehog,3c0sxb,kemekokitten,2,Fri Jul 3 18:52:18 2015 UTC,"A male's penis will come out of the penile sheath when he's peeing (not always, and if so, not usually all the way) and when he's masturbating. It sounds like he was doing the latter while you were snuggling last night. Semen is very sticky, so most likely the blanket got stuck on it and pulled a little inside his sheath when his penis retracted. That you had to cut it away, and didn't get it all, is definitely concerning, and leaves you with no good way to access the rest of what's left in there. For future reference, not that you're likely to deal with this again: letting him, and the blanket, soak in a warm bath would have made it much easier to pull away the part that was stuck to him. For now, keep a close eye out for any signs of infection, and hopefully whatever is left will come off on its own within the next few days."

Don't worry it's only hose water) and then I wash it with the sheets and fleece I use in his cage. He has like a whole box of his OWN stuff...spoiled brat. But he's my spoiled brat and I love him

So I don't know if she was sick last week or something or if it was just too hot in our house or what.

Topokki's skin was always dry but since i got back her skin is so dry whem i hold her dandurf just flies everywhere or my dark clothes get white patches. Today i was filming her when i realized she is pretty pink. Keep i. Mind that i live in utah so its pretty dry and its pretty hot right now. Outaode is ussualy 95 but i keep the house around 74_80.  I honestly dont kmow if ita more pink or red than ussual but i  think it is or either she is losing hair. She wheels all night. Havnt seen her scratch much. Sometimes she sneezez once or twice. But not something regular. Im considering taking her to vet even though she already went around 2 months ago. But anyone has any suggestions? Is she very red in picture?
Hedgehog,3b8y89,Zillibean,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"Have you tried using Humilac for the dry skin? If it is just very dry skin, Humilac will work wonders."

Hedgehog,3b7bse,Grayson_the_Doc,4,Fri Jun 26 15:36:33 2015 UTC,no way. unsafe and really irresponsible to breed without any experience.
Hedgehog,3b7bse,Charliethehog,4,Fri Jun 26 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"Regardless of if the two species can breed together you have no way of knowing what the health history of the male would be if you are using a wild hog. That is hugely irresponsible breeding. You should ONLY breed after you have done research and know the genetic background of both animals. Without knowing that, sure you may get cute babies, but you also can get very sick babies with lots of genetic issues. Please don't breed your hog, especially if you only have a year owning one. You need to spend lots of time researching and understanding genetics before you even begin to consider breeding an animal responsibly."
Hedgehog,3b7bse,goblinish,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"I've been doing my research, and I would never use a wild one. I couldn't find any places that breed them in captivity. And yes I don't have experience in breeding hedgehogs but I'm definately not irresponsible when it comes to breeding. I've been breeding rats and bearded dragons for about 4 years now, and I know that has nothing to do with hedgehogs but I'm showing that I have a little bit of background as a breeder in general. And you guys are right I shouldn't start with a brown hedgehog, if I'm going to begin breeding for the first time I'll get another African pygmie. I just wanted to know if those two species could cross. Thanks for the positive response :)"
Hedgehog,3b7bse,VolcanoView,2,Sat Jun 27 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you shouldn't be breeding, period, if your only motivation is ""cute babies""."
Hedgehog,3b7bse,VolcanoView,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:39:03 2015 UTC,"No that's not my only motivation, I'm not a fucking 5 year old. Thanks for your helpful response"
Hedgehog,3b7bse,NoCommentsYaDingus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"Here's helpful: if you've had your female for almost a year, she's likely too old to be bred anyway.  Breeding is not something to be taken lightly. When approached incorrectly, the animals suffer. Your OP and comments seem to be entirely interested in the appearance of the babies, and nothing else; if you actually have other motivations, and are interested in properly educating yourself and making preparations to approach breeding in a responsible manner, that's awesome. I can only go by what's within view. Please, by all means, elaborate about what your motivations are, how you're setting up a hedgehog room for this purpose, have a vet lined up with experience with hedgehog breeding/pregnancy problems, have a minimum of $1k set aside, have thoroughly researched all aspects of breeding and babies, have found a reputable and experienced breeding mentor who is willing to walk you through everything and be available at any time of the day or night to help with problems, and have verified that your hedgehog has 5+ generations of pedigree that are known to be good quality and free of any genetic problems.  If you don't have all that figured out, or are in the process of figuring it out, then don't get offended when someone suggests that you should stick to having your hedgehog as a pet, and not use her for breeding purposes. There are enough BYBs in the hedgehog world who stick them together to hump and make babies without considering any of those things, or the long list of other details that come after those, and for most of them, ""cute babies"", ""cool colors"", or ""yay, money"" are the motivations - which is why when that's the only interest someone seems to have in breeding, it's going to be met with a guarded response. Particularly from experienced breeders and rescuers, like myself, who are all too familiar with the damage those people do, and are continuously cleaning up their messes."

Hedgehog,3aw03s,Lettucelove185,3,Tue Jun 23 23:13:22 2015 UTC,"I will say that my hedgehog (first experience with these animals) was super aggressive when I adopted him. Think he is two or three, came with the name Grumpy because he would hiss and bite and spike up like mad.  I just let him get comfortable with his new habitat by giving him some space for a couple months, then eventually I could pick him up. You have to be confident picking them up, I know it can be scary but you have to go for it. But that's just what worked with my little guy, good luck with yours."
Hedgehog,3aw03s,hazeofthegreensmoke,2,Tue Jun 23 23:47:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback. Kevin doesn't hiss or ball up, he just bites when we hold him. Or when we put him on the bed he attacks anything that is skin. :("
Hedgehog,3aw03s,VolcanoView,3,Tue Jun 23 23:56:15 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've basically reenforced the behavior, and he's learned that he can use it against you. Hedgehogs don't bite aggressively unless it's been ""taught"", which generally happens unintentionally by the owners reacting to unintentional or curious nipping the wrong way. The best way to deal with a bite is to react as little as possible, because strong reactions, especially ones that are followed by putting him away, leaving him alone, or acting nervous around him, are basically telling him, ""This is a good method to get what you want."" The methods you've described, therefore, are making it that much worse.  Using mealworms as bribery when you first take him out may be the original source of the problem, as well, as doing that habitually can make them expect them, and then demand them when they want them, through biting the ""source"" (your fingers/hands). You may have also, at some point, had a strong reaction to him nibbling you because he was interested in your scent; doing that a few times in reaction to unintentional, non-aggressive biting can begin to create an aggressive biting habit.  At this point you're going to have to work to re-teach him by adjusting how you react, and it's probably going to mean dealing with biting for a while. When you handle him, don't be timid about it, but keep in mind that he's going to try to bite because he's been taught to do so - so try to keep your hands away from his face to reduce his opportunities to do so. When he does bite, you need to ignore it. Don't react at all. Yes, it's harder said than done, but it's the only way to break the habit. By not reacting, consistently, you'll show him that biting is no longer an effective strategy to intimidate you, get you to leave him alone, etc. As he continues to bite without getting a response anymore, he'll gradually give up that behavior. Don't make noise, jerk away, blow on him, poke him in the nose, or do anything at all. Grit your teeth and wait it out. If he absolutely won't let go, the one way to get him to do so, which won't reenforce the behavior, is to dribble a small amount of water in his face. He'll have a reflex reaction and let go, without making the connection that it's coming from you.  p.s. Not related to the biting, but tanks really aren't an appropriate housing option for a hedgehog."
Hedgehog,3aw03s,jbrown5217,3,Wed Jun 24 00:22:18 2015 UTC,"We've tried sitting through it but he'll stay latched on. That's when we decided to do the alcohol thing. How long do you think this process could take? He's broken skin several times and it hurts. Right after he bites the first time, he bites again. And it's not always our fingers. We only push and blow to get him to let go because pulling away makes him bite harder. I only tried giving him the mealworm outside of his cage yesterday but he launched to my boyfriend and grabbed onto his arm. And we left him out of his cage because we don't want to reinforce his behavior by giving him what he wants. Also, we had a regular big cage but we got the tank because he bites the bars on the cage and we didn't want him to hurt his teeth.  Update: I'm doing what you're saying, avoiding letting him bite me, having more confidence, and ignoring his harsh nips. He seems to be letting me handle him and not trying to eat me. I put him back within 10 minutes of him not biting me. I'm seeing some amount of progress. I'll try again tomorrow. Thank you!"
Hedgehog,3aw03s,jbrown5217,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:52:32 2015 UTC,You can get a large sterilite bin which is appropriate housing that doesn't have bars
Hedgehog,3aw03s,NoCommentsYaDingus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:02:27 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why a cheap bin from walmart is appropriate but a wide 40 gallon tank is not? This tank accommodates his giant wheel, food and drink, litter box and sleep areas way better than any bin I could find."
Hedgehog,3aw03s,RedJayRioting,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:20:36 2015 UTC,Because hedgehogs only need about 2 square feet (minimum) of space in their cage.  A 110 quart sterilite easily meets this requirement.  Also note that width > height.  So you want something that is wide and long instead of long and really tall (somethings aquariums do poorly).  Lastly glass aquariums aren't great for maintaing consistant temperatures and they can get cold/hot really quickly causing a hedgehog to get uncomfortable.  This is because generally speaking they are glass an aquarium glass isn't the best insulator.  The sterlite bins are much easier to keep at a consistant temp.
Hedgehog,3aw03s,nivlheimPL,3,Thu Jun 25 15:24:11 2015 UTC,Did you name him after the reddit Kevin? That might be the reason. I suggest a name change

Hedgehog,3aro4a,VolcanoView,2,Tue Jun 23 12:53:47 2015 UTC,"For that, the rubbing is what's important. The tatters are from built up dry skin, dirt, oil, etc, so you need to use Humilac (or vaseline, olive/coconut oil, bag balm, etc) to soften it and massage the ears for a little while. Doing that daily will work it loose after a little while."

When you switch food introduce some of the new food to the old food, and keep increasing the amount.  Don't just use 100% new food right off the bat.

""Top tier"" can be used as a single food, and ""second tier"" can be used in combination with other foods, but aren't ideal on their own. In most cases picking one that's around 10-12% fat will work best, and protein should always be around 30-33% (never over 35%, which will cause health issues in the long term)."
Hedgehog,3anubo,davos_the_smuggler,3,Mon Jun 22 01:15:50 2015 UTC,"I've read that hedgehogs have a bald spot on their head so they can roll into a ball, they said it was like a reversed mohawk. Lewie would scratch and sneeze a lot when I first got him. I kinda chopped it up to allergies and switched him to fleece liners, which has stopped his sneezing and the scratching has calmed down a lot. That's just my experience with it, I hope I helped a little though!"
Hedgehog,3anubo,Kitcatkatiecat,3,Mon Jun 22 01:31:05 2015 UTC,My hedgie has that kinda bald spot too and will not stand to have the quills above his head touched.

If you are using wood shavings as bedding then that may be causing him to scratch. Try fleece!
Hedgehog,3anubo,Vonbonnery,2,Mon Jun 22 02:25:28 2015 UTC,"You aren't supposed to bathe your hedgy too much as they are prone to dry skin. So that could be a possible reason he/she is constantly itching. If and when you do bathe him/her use a gentle oatmeal shampoo for babies like aveeno, and also there is a spray you can use after the bath called Humilac that will condition his/her skin. Foot baths are encouraged tho because of their poopy paws!"
Hedgehog,3anubo,lilames,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:25:36 2015 UTC,"Hedgehogs have a ""reverse mohawk,"" so they do have a bald spot right down the middle of the top of their head. How old is he? He could be quilling (when babies shed their baby quills and get their adult ones, much like human babies teething).  The itching could be dry skin or mites, really. Or even just little Simon being irritated from the quilling. I would invest in some humiliac and/or give him an oatmeal bath to see if that helps soothe it, and if not I would schedule a quick vet appointment just to be safe. :)"

You also need a heat source (not heating pad) and a digital thermometer in the cage. Otherwise, it looks great for a DIY cage. I personally prefer liners over carefresh, but that's just preference. Maybe add some more accessories and hideaways to fill up more space."

Hedgehog,3afgz7,VolcanoView,2,Fri Jun 19 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"How long has she not been eating? When that happens for more than 3-4 days or so, syringe feeding is required. Weakness from not eating, and a long list of other possible problems, can cause mobility and balance issues. One of those is WHS, but a vet should be looking at testable and treatable possibilities first, which are also more common. If it came on suddenly, stroke is a possibility. Leaning only to one side can also be an indication of an inner ear problem, ear infection, etc. Especially given the green and slimy poop, the vet should have started her on antibiotics, and if the first one doesn't work, a second one. I would also suggest a full blood panel to help narrow down the possibilities."
Hedgehog,3afgz7,nmmtns,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:53:43 2015 UTC,"First I would like to thank you for your reply.  It is very insightful.   She has been eating every little for the past 4 weeks.  She used to be eating twice a day but she has slowly been eating less and less.  It has however gotten really bad last night.  She only ate three pieces of kibble.  I have no idea how to syringe feed a hedgehog so any pointers would be great.  Do i just wet down here normal food, mash it up and put it in a syringe?    When this first started happening a month ago the first vet I took her too thought it might be an ear infection, she got her ears cleaned out and some drops put in them as well as being put on an antibiotic.  However she still has the symptoms and they are getting worse.  She was also put on an anti inflammatory in case she injured her leg or something.    The second vet I took her too yesterday also prescribed her an antibiotic and a steroid.  She also got a full battery of blood work done, the test results came back today and everything is normal.  The vet said that was bad news since it is probably something neurological at this point.  However there are no neurologists where I live that are willing to see a hedgehog.  So she referred me to an exotic pet specialist about a hour away.  I just had her out and she made the tiniest hedgehog poop I have ever seen.  So like I said any pointers on syringe feeding you have would be appreciated.   Thanks again."
Hedgehog,3afgz7,VolcanoView,2,Fri Jun 19 22:57:05 2015 UTC,"I have never syringe-fed a hedgehog, but I imagine your vet would have advice for you on what food to use.  This thread a few months ago had some advice on how to get them to take the syringe: www.reddit.com/r/Hedgehog/comments/2skyg1/someone_please_help_me_give_petey_his_medicine/  ETA: The hedgehog diet and nutrition forum on www.chins-n-hedgies.com looks like it has a lot of posts about hedgehogs not eating.

Hedgehog,3afgz7,VolcanoView,2,Sat Jun 20 02:43:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I have been watching YouTube videos but your links are a lot more useful. When i am at the vet again tomorrow I will ask about syringe feeding tip and tricks.  Thank you again."
Hedgehog,3afgz7,VolcanoView,2,Sat Jun 20 03:07:22 2015 UTC,"How much has she been eating over the last 4 weeks? If it's been drastically decreased, without getting food in her via syringe, she may essentially be starving and wasting away. That's very capable of causing all sorts of issues.  For syringe feeding, you'll need 3cc oral syringes (which you can get from the vet or ask for at a human pharmacy), and I'd recommend Carnivore Care as the best soft diet for a sick hedgehog. Your vet may have it on hand, otherwise you can order it from Amazon. In the meantime, you can either grind up kibble and add water to make it into mush, or use meat baby foods. Whatever you use, get it to a liquidy consistency that goes through the syringe easily, scruff the hedgehog, and squirt a little at a time into the corner of the mouth, toward the throat. A hedgehog that isn't eating at all will need at least 12-15cc over the course of a day, in smaller sessions of usually 3-6cc each time. I would also recommend syringe feeding pedialyte a few times a day, as a starving hedgehog is usually dehydrated as well."
Hedgehog,3afgz7,VolcanoView,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:56:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply, she has been eating progressively less in the last month.  The other night she only at 3 pieces of kibble.  We had another vet visit today and she was diagnosed with WHS which is heart breaking because she is so young.  The doctor gave us Carnivore Care for her and a syringe.  However when she is fed the Carnivore Care she just throws up...  So she that does not really seem to be helping her.  She now seems to have an aversion to the smell and wont even let it near her mouth.  I will pick up some pedialyte tonight and see if she is willing to take that.    Thank you for responding I really appreciate your help and everyone's help that has responded to this thread."

Hedgehog,3afcbm,drodeo,2,Fri Jun 19 17:52:04 2015 UTC,I bought a playpen designed for small dogs for camping. It's a tent-like material with a zip-off top just tall enough that she can't run away. It's easy to clean and folds flat for storage! caption

Hedgehog,3a1xz8,bl629d511,6,Tue Jun 16 16:25:17 2015 UTC,"Hold him/her every day. Get him used to you picking him up. Be dilligent. Mine actually looked forward to it because he was used to it. Make creative play areas with boxes, craft supplies, etc. Don't use wood chips for bedding because 1. they're messy and 2. they hold mites, which hedgehogs often get. Use fleece bedding, go to petco and get the foam/fleece little pineapple houses, etc. If it's a boy, he will ejaculate and it will be weird. He might also get aggressive during his 'puberty'. No scented things on your hand. It makes them want to eat your hand and it will lead to painful biting that they won't unlearn. If your hedgehog isn't pooing, warm bath on their tummy. Or plain canned pumpkin as a laxative. If your hedgehog is losing quills other than during quilling times, probably mites. Go to vet. Get revolution not ivermectin for mites. Use a carolina storm wheel not the kind of wheel that has a seam in the middle. It will cut their feet and make them bleed. Say your hedgies name to him/her every day. I swear, I said it so often that when I let him play outside and he couldn't find me, I said outloud ""Sonni!!!!"" and he turned and ran towards me. Keep the blankies clean. Contorting back/spreading back legs while standing means he has to poo and will go right there. Anointing is adorable when it's with pumpkin or grass - they'll have orange or green spots no their face/back. hedgehogcentral.com saved my life. He loved sugar snap peas, mint leaves, crunchy cat food (he wouldn't eat soft), other fresh herbs, meal worms. NO AVOCADO - IT'S TOXIC. Trim nails often. Regular clippers work. Put him in water up to his belly so he has to swim and let his legs down (can't ball up) and gently grab the leg and don't let go. Then trim carefully. Wrap him in a big towel after a bath and hold against your chest. It's the best and he'll be so cute and playful."
Hedgehog,3a1xz8,justminick,2,Tue Jun 16 17:38:21 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! This is all very helpful! :)
Hedgehog,3a1xz8,cspikes,2,Tue Jun 16 18:09:30 2015 UTC,"On nail trimming, it really comes down to how squirmy your hedgehog is. Mine can't sit still even during baths, so I just cut a nail or two a day depending on how long they look. It's less of a headache than trying to trim every nail at once over a two hour session."

Hedgehog,3a1fys,ForeverAWino,3,Tue Jun 16 14:07:24 2015 UTC,"Those wheels recently started being made with plastic, not metal, at the spot the saucer spins on, so they break a lot faster now. Invest in a bucket wheel - it'll outlive your hedgehog."
Hedgehog,3a1fys,VolcanoView,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:37:19 2015 UTC,That does look a lot more durable.  Thank you!
Hedgehog,3a1fys,Whitechocolatekrispi,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:39:12 2015 UTC,Can you recommend one of those bucket wheels for a huge hedgie?
Hedgehog,3a1fys,VolcanoView,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:02:28 2015 UTC,"Any of the 11"" bucket wheels (non-translucent colors), or the cake cover wheel, are great options for larger hogs. All of our hogs, including our largest (over 700g), use the 11"" bucket wheel without any problems."
Hedgehog,3a1fys,Whitechocolatekrispi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:06:42 2015 UTC,"Do you mind me asking how wobbly they are. My current wheel the component holding the baring part to the stand is slightly wobbly, and I've noticed it freaks my hedge out when if he isn't careful."
Hedgehog,3a1fys,VolcanoView,2,Fri Jun 19 11:19:26 2015 UTC,"Bucket wheels are very sturdy and don't wobble at all. Cake cover wheels, because the cake cover is so large, will dip a little bit when the hedgehog is on it, but I wouldn't call that ""wobbly"" either."

Hedgehog,3a0d4j,cschick22,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:12:10 2015 UTC,"Can she get into it herself?  9 weeks is still a bit smaller than a full sized hedgie.  As long as she's getting exercise somehow (e.g. running around her cage) she should be fine.  Make sure she's not climbing her cage for said exercise though.  Hedgehogs can climb up, fall off, and sustain internal injuries.  It happened to one of mine last year :("
Hedgehog,3a0d4j,5hinycat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:38:55 2015 UTC,"She seems tall enough to climb into it herself, she just never does. Most days and nights too she just sleeps, which is also quite concerning."
Hedgehog,3a0d4j,5hinycat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:41:47 2015 UTC,"Are you sure she's sleeping at night?  There'll be plenty of nights when I don't hear a peep from Cecil, but I'll wake up and his entire cage is trashed.  He likes to have parties or something, I don't know.  Anyhoo.  It could also be the wheel.  I have this one - amzn.com/dp/B001AT62G6/ - and my hedgie runs on it all night long.  I also have an upright one that he won't touch.  Last thing I can think of - do you have a pet thermometer and some kind of heating set up?  They can be very lethargic if its not warm enough.  Too cold and they'll start hibernating.  Hibernation in domesticated hedgehogs == bad.  Just some thoughts from me and my iPhone while I'm procrastinating at my day job."
Hedgehog,3a0d4j,VolcanoView,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:17:50 2015 UTC,She gets up to go to the bathroom and eat/drink but then it's right back into the igloo.
Hedgehog,3a0d4j,VolcanoView,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:34:50 2015 UTC,"What kind is it? Are you seeing any mess on it in the morning? Most hedgehogs won't run in front of anyone or when there's light in the room, but you should be seeing poop on it if it's being used. Make sure the temperature is comfortable (mid 70s) and that the wheel is the correct size, tilted properly, and there's no light at all during the night (even a computer screen or something)."
Hedgehog,3a0d4j,Whitechocolatekrispi,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:44:15 2015 UTC,"The room is completely dark at night and the lowest the temp gets is 74°f. It's just a smooth plastic wheel with textured notches in the plastic for texture. I'm not seeing any mess or bedding or anything on the when at all, she only ever interacts with it when she poops behind it. What do you mean by correct size?"
Hedgehog,39zxkt,fuckyeahglitter,3,Tue Jun 16 03:34:50 2015 UTC,"Try it again. He probably couldn't recognize his house, being overwhelmed by the changes and all. In this case they dig and explore, often knocking over everything in the process. Set it all up again, use the shirt you wore today as the bedding where you want him to sleep."
Hedgehog,39zxkt,VolcanoView,3,Tue Jun 16 04:46:22 2015 UTC,"If it's significantly larger and more open than the previous cage, that's a normal reaction. They don't like a lot of open space, which is why ""bigger is better"" doesn't actually apply. You can try making sure most of the space is filled (at least 3/4), but if you do that and find that your hedgehog is still wrecking things or you're seeing other behaviors that suggest he doesn't like it (pacing, more defensive, etc), it'd be best to switch back to the old one."
Hedgehog,39zxkt,99drumdude,2,Tue Jun 16 08:42:57 2015 UTC,Maible does this when i switch out her wheel sometimes. She throws a tissy and trashes her cage. THIS. IS. NOT. MY. WHEEL!!!

Hedgehog,39vnp9,fat-wh0re,9,Mon Jun 15 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"I was cleaning out his cage, so I put Octavius in his ""vacation cage,"" a small plastic container that used to belong to some arts and crafts. I had to leave in a rush and his wheel and cage weren't yet dry, so I said ""eh, what's he gonna do, climb out?"" And left him in his vacation home. I come home a few hours later with no hedgie to be found. Luckily, he's very loud when he's uncomfortable, and my bedroom door had been closed, so finding him was a matter of ""you're getting warmer!"" whenever I heard a hiss. I found him hiding in the space between my bed and dresser, safe and sound! I gave him a warm bath to clean off the dust bunnies and now we're cuddling. Sorry little fella!"
Hedgehog,39vnp9,deadbeatengineer,6,Mon Jun 15 04:25:35 2015 UTC,"Gideon has done something like this as well! We have one of those folding fence things we let him roam around in when we put him in the living room. I leave for a bit with a friend to go to her place to help with her computer, and my fiance goes into the bedroom real quick but ends up conking out. When I got home he shows me that he woke up to get a drink and on the way back to the bedroom he noticed that the little shit found out how to open the fence, and it took him over half an hour to find Gideon hiding underneath the corner bench of our dining table. He put Gideon back in the cage not even 5 minutes before I got home."

Hedgehog,39uw5v,theoreticaldickjokes,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:56:34 2015 UTC,The shampoo for kids that is hypoallergenic can not be hypoallergenic for hedgies. It's much more safe to use chemical free natural products.
Hedgehog,39uw5v,lanug0,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:23:10 2015 UTC,"A gentle bath wash - NOT shampoo. Shampoo of any kind, including ones labeled for babies or pets, are still designed to strip away oils in the skin, so they're too harsh for hedgehogs and will cause dry skin. Aveeno, Dove, St. Ives, or any of the off-brand version of those, particularly the ""moisturizing"" or ""sensitive skin"" varieties."
Hedgehog,39uw5v,VolcanoView,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:38:44 2015 UTC,I just let Daisy swim around in warm water. It's usually enough to soften anything stuck to her. Anything else I gently rub off with my fingers.

Hedgehog,39c1vc,JetSetRadioFuture,3,Wed Jun 10 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"Buy from a reputable breeder. Get all of the required supplies ahead of time - including a good food, heat source (NOT a heating pad), and invest in a good wheel (like a bucket wheel, which won't break after 6 months like any store-bought wheel). Make sure you have a clear understanding of how hedgehogs are ""wired"" and what their behaviors mean. That, and overall confidence, are the two most important things when it comes to building a relationship. Understanding that defensive behaviors are strategic, being able to ignore them and not take them personally, will save you a lot of frustration along the way. It will also ensure that you don't accidentally reenforce unwanted behaviors by reacting to them the wrong way. You can find a detailed discussion of handling and bonding (along with other care info) here."

Hedgehog,39c1vc,VolcanoView,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:57:30 2015 UTC,"Handling, you are going to want to handle the little one on a daily basis. I would say an hour a day, which seems like a lot, but if you consider you can just let them sleep on you while you watch Netflix, it's not soo bad. They need to get used to being handled regularly and get used to your scents as well. The more you touch and handle them at an early age, the more friendly they will be.   Mealworms are great snacks. You can get dried ones at any pet store. My Pepper loves them, and can't get enough. It's also really funny to watch them eat mealworms, they just sort of suck them up. Hilarious.   I would also get a small pouch. You can use this to pick her up out of her cage as well as just someplace to sleep, hangout when she's outside. They love being under blankets and tight spaces.   If your hedgehog has been outside of their cage for a while and starts moving around a lot (walking for the sake of walking) they are about to pee and poop. Scoop them up and put them back in their cage!   You said you are using fleece to line your cage. Do you have anything else to line it? I would get some paper pet bedding as well. Soft and easy to use. If you use the paper kind you shouldn't have to worry about brand or anything... whatever works for your budget.   Put a small shirt or hat or something article of clothing of yours (or your boyfriends) in the cage at night. This way the hedgehog can smell it and recognize that you aren't danger, or a predator.   I think those are all the things we learned when we first got a hedgehog. That has helped us a lot. They are really a low maintenance pet, and just awesome to have all around.   Please take pictures and let us know how it goes!"
Hedgehog,39c1vc,VolcanoView,2,Wed Jun 10 20:33:36 2015 UTC,Fleece on its own is great - there's no use to use paper bedding along with it.
Hedgehog,39c1vc,fat-wh0re,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:33:25 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, thanks! Buying fleece at the craft store now. I wonder if they have any cotton-blend fleece; it sounds more absorbent."
Hedgehog,39c1vc,VolcanoView,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:34:21 2015 UTC,"You don't really have to worry about absorbency, as hedgehogs don't pee very much, and most of it will be on the wheel. Stick a tray with absorbent litter (pine pellets or paper pellets; no grainy, clay, or clumping litter) under the wheel and you're pretty much set. The point of fleece is that you can cut it to size without needing to sew it, because it won't fray and unravel at the edges, whereas other kinds of fabrics will. If you want it to be a little more cushioned on the floor of the cage, buy a piece twice as long as the floor size and use it folded over. You'll want enough for at least 3-4 liner changes so you have spares when you change it out."

Hedgehog,397prm,poethedog,11,Tue Jun 9 21:22:26 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: your hedgehog does not understand the tradeoff between quality and quantity of life.  All he knows is that he's suffering right now.  He has no concept of the future where he might not be hurting.  You have the responsibility to decide whether the suffering during his operation and recovery experience, plus whatever suffering and loss of ""quality of life"" that being shy a leg will cause for however long he'll live, will be worth the tradeoff in possible additional time lived in comfort.  It's a hard decision, and we can't make it for you."

Just my take, I feel there's nothing to lose in this case."

Hedgehog,397prm,AllyPent,2,Sat Jun 13 22:36:23 2015 UTC,"I would have them do more tests first. See what type of tumor it is. Some are more spreading than others. Also, a full body xray is a good idea to see if it has spread anywhere else, like organs.  If all is needed is the amputation after that, yes. It will extend his life and animals adapt well to missing limbs.  Ive seen animals live with quite large tumors and be totally fine, it is when it is causing pain and hindering quality of life that they need to be addressed ASAP.  If you are unwilling to do surgery, please elect humane euthanasia if it is truly causing suffering.  Hope that helps.  Resource: I'm a Vet tech"
Hedgehog,397prm,Asseman,2,Wed Jun 10 02:36:48 2015 UTC,The tumor was too large and it was impairing his mobility. I decided to go through with the surgery. He seems to be adapting quickly. Thank you for your advice!

Hedgehog,397prm,Whitechocolatekrispi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"Both of my two hedgehogs developed large tumors - one at 5 years old, and one at 8.  We ended up electing to put both of them down once they began to show any signs of discomfort.  Do remember that 5 years old is already quite senior for a hedgehog - the chances of full recovery and still having time to enjoy a pain free life are fairly slim.  As someone who has been through it I know how hard it is - I balled for a few days straight both times - but ultimately I know I made the right choice for my spikebutts."
Hedgehog,397prm,AliB3,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:24:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry OP, but in my opinion, putting a 5 year old hedgehog through a leg amputation when he maybe has 1-2 years of life left anyway seems inappropriate.

Hedgehog,38zdcl,as_stated_above,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:00:06 2015 UTC,"Research and figure out all the supplies you're going to get ahead of time. Find a reputable breeder in your area - I'm happy to point you in the right direction. Remember that they're not ""delicate"", and sheltering them or treating them like they're made of glass won't benefit your relationship with the hedgehog. Understanding how they're wired, and what the behaviors means, is one of the two most important things. The other is confidence."
Hedgehog,38zdcl,VolcanoView,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:15:00 2015 UTC,"I'm in Tennessee, do you know which breeder in or around the state would be best?"
Hedgehog,38zdcl,meofcoursenot,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:26:01 2015 UTC,"You need to socialize them! This means at least an hour+ a day of handling and playing time with you! Can not stress this enough, my friend's hedgie was so un-socialized that they had a panic attack (maybe a heart attack) and died while meeting someone new. They are spazy little critters that aren't naturally good with humans so you need to be patient with them coming around to you."
Hedgehog,38zdcl,VolcanoView,2,Mon Jun 8 03:57:12 2015 UTC,"Did you actually see this occur? I find it highly questionable, and if it really did happen, then it wasn't related to the hedgehog being unsocialized, but an existing health problem, such as a heart defect. Whereas some animals, like rabbits, can literally get so stressed that it kills them, that's not something that occurs with hedgehogs."
Hedgehog,38zdcl,meofcoursenot,2,Mon Jun 8 23:16:26 2015 UTC,"Also, just double checked about stress killing them. Although it is uncommon, according to the British Hedgehog Preservation Society it can occur when they are in an unfamiliar situation. Again, not saying that this was for sure the cause of death in my friends situation, but its not impossible."
Hedgehog,38zdcl,VolcanoView,2,Tue Jun 9 00:05:22 2015 UTC,"I go by what's known for pet hedgehogs, as they're quite different from European hedgehogs. Theoretically any animal, including humans, can die if they get stressed, but preexisting factors would have to already be in place, and in my experience (USDA breeder for 3+ years, working with some breeders with as much as 15+ years experience, and admin of a hedgehog group with over 6k members) death by stress isn't something that I know to have ever occurred. Hedgehogs need daily handling to be well socialized and to have a good relationship with their owner, but outside of some sort of freak occurrence in an individual who already has a weak heart, there isn't any sort of threat of them passing away because of not being socialized."
Hedgehog,38zdcl,meofcoursenot,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:20:44 2015 UTC,"Although I was not there, this story was from a close friend of mine who adopted a 2 year old hedgie. Specifics on an underlying heart conditions were not know (why I included heart attack as a possibility above) but the incident occurred while being stressed around a new person- the hedgie was already known not to like people. Whether it was coincidence or not, an un-socialized hedgehog is not fun to deal with!"

Hedgehog,38y9re,serenitysanctum,3,Sun Jun 7 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"I think you're just underestimating haha. My hedgie's food is pretty crunchy and sometimes he scares himself with the crunch but he has no problems eating it. If you just got her she might just take a couple of days to adjust before she is eating regularly. I don't really measure out his food daily, just make sure there's some in his bowl all the time, unless he's gaining too much weight. Also make sure to get her a wheel if you haven't already. Bucket wheels are the best IMO, but anything with a flat running surface will do. I tried a few different ones but they all gave up the ghost within 6 months. Throwing a worn shirt into her cage will help her get used to your scent too :) good luck!"
Hedgehog,38y9re,Black_Orchid13,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:53:46 2015 UTC,I bought her a saucer because that fit better in her tank. She didn't have a wheel at her old home :c Thanks for the advice! Ill throw my shirt in there tonight!
Hedgehog,38y9re,VolcanoView,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"What's the exact formula you're using? (Just asking because some BB formulas work well, but most are too high in protein/fat.) BB actually has a fairly small size, so unless she has mouth problems, which is unlikely at her age, that wouldn't cause her to not eat much. Don't soften it - that ruins the crunchy aspect and will negatively impact her dental health in the long term.  Is the food you're using the same as what she was previously eating? How long have you had her? A reduced appetite is normal during the first few days in a new home. Also, if you're switching her cold turkey from a different food she was used to before, that can get in the way as well."
Hedgehog,38y9re,VolcanoView,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:07:19 2015 UTC,"We are on day two, but first full day. At her old home they were giving her a random dog food. I'm giving her the healthy aging, 32% protein 15% fat (I'm afraid that might be a little high!) 5% fiber"

See if you can use the previous food for a gradual transition. Since she's already nibbling at the kibble a little, she'll likely get more of her appetite back once she's been with you for 3-4 days. I'd recommend going with a food that has more like 10-12% fat (should definitely be under 15%, but that range works best for most adults)."
Hedgehog,38ukr8,bonnablues,2,Sat Jun 6 23:21:30 2015 UTC,RIP op. Cute hedge
Hedgehog,38ukr8,bennn30,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:44:26 2015 UTC,"So adorable, that little mask is so perfect."
Hedgehog,38twyx,federalabang,4,Sat Jun 6 20:02:27 2015 UTC,"I love the title and the hedgie look you captured in the mirror! ""Why can't I stop doing it?!!"""
Hedgehog,38ud6v,99drumdude,2,Sat Jun 6 22:15:45 2015 UTC,Hedgehogs and chickens!?! My favorite! Is the chicken for keeping or eating?
Hedgehog,38ud6v,theoddowl,2,Sun Jun 7 04:44:37 2015 UTC,They are layers. Maible likes scrambled eggs :D.
Hedgehog,38ud6v,theoddowl,3,Sun Jun 7 04:48:29 2015 UTC,"That is so cool! I kept chickens... sort of. We didn't eat them and they didn't lay us eggs. In fact they were wild chickens who lived in our front yard. So I guess it's more apt to say I lived near chickens. They were awesome though, and super cute."
Hedgehog,38ud6v,theoddowl,2,Sun Jun 7 04:55:28 2015 UTC,"The night after that photo was taken, three hens disappeared. Theres only feathers in the front yard D:"
Hedgehog,38vilx,theoddowl,4,Sun Jun 7 04:36:20 2015 UTC,"It's the ""mount me"" pose. Rubbing certain areas on a female's lower back or hips can get them to stretch and stick their butt out the way they would if a male were trying to court them, as those are the areas being grabbed by the male's mouth or front feet. So it's basically a reflex; not a bad thing."
Hedgehog,38vilx,VolcanoView,3,Sun Jun 7 19:31:27 2015 UTC,Oh Jesus! Lol!
Hedgehog,38vilx,Whitechocolatekrispi,2,Sun Jun 7 20:26:48 2015 UTC,"It's the ""mount me"" pose.   Hahahahahhahhahah"
Hedgehog,38vilx,Whitechocolatekrispi,3,Sun Jun 7 19:51:25 2015 UTC,"Generally if a hedgehog doesn't like something, it'll huff like crazy, ball up and twitch/jab. If a hedgehog is hurt it'll squeak and cry.  If your hedgehog does nothing and stays in that position she probably likes it. I wouldn't worry too much."
Hedgehog,38vs9r,CaptainPhoenix,3,Sun Jun 7 06:26:25 2015 UTC,"His names Bilbo? That's adorable. Mine's Pippin. All I can say is to put him in a lukewarm bath where the water isn't high enough to submerge his face. Pippin usually, after struggling for a bit, stays still when I grab one of his feet, but it takes some coaxing. I use a little kitty nail clipper. Make sure not to cut too close to the quick because they bleed a bit and I always feel so bad :("
Hedgehog,38txgf,Davadam27,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:06:07 2015 UTC,that's almost seizure inducing
Hedgehog,38t2de,Wensleydale,3,Sat Jun 6 16:02:59 2015 UTC,That farm's seen some turbulent times
Hedgehog,38t2de,SonicFlash01,2,Sat Jun 6 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think the lesson is that cats are terrible things to have on farms, it's always helpful to have a bear, and farming is much too fast paced as a lifestyle for a hedgehog.  I think she needs to try life as an acupuncturist."
Hedgehog,38t2de,Nimbacinus,2,Sat Jun 6 19:56:45 2015 UTC,Damn Quentin...
Hedgehog,38qv7s,ghotis,2,Sat Jun 6 01:18:17 2015 UTC,Hey there Waffles!! He's a cutie!
Hedgehog,38qv7s,Deedee1979,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:10:13 2015 UTC,I want to smooch his little nose.
Hedgehog,38qv7s,HopefulNebula,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:09:33 2015 UTC,Cute!  However it almost looks like he had a bifurcated tongue and is locking his nose from both sides lol
Hedgehog,38q07v,bonnablues,3,Fri Jun 5 21:22:21 2015 UTC,"Oh no, she melted!"
Hedgehog,38q07v,atomiclolz,2,Sat Jun 6 01:42:30 2015 UTC,"so that's what they look like underneath!  My hedgie has never been that relaxed around me. I can carry him around alright and all, but no showing of the belly."
Hedgehog,38q07v,terradi,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"Aww, look at that belly."
Hedgehog,38qxz3,thisbusisempty,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:41:43 2015 UTC,My hedgie Pix is either trying to scramble away or shitting on me/something. I can relate xD
Hedgehog,38qxz3,Bumbleonia,2,Sat Jun 6 02:01:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my guy didn't take to litter training at all. He poops wherever and whenever he feels like it, which is rarely when/where I want him to. At least he always goes into this pose so I know when it's coming."
Hedgehog,38qxz3,Bumbleonia,3,Sat Jun 6 02:15:44 2015 UTC,"Im usually holding her when it happens, and she just goes dead still....and then - a hedgehog sized surprise.....also...just saying, I am sometimes impressed by how big it can be. Im like....dayum, that came from you?"
Hedgehog,38qxz3,fat-wh0re,3,Sat Jun 6 02:28:57 2015 UTC,Best description I've read is that it's just like squeezing a tube of toothpaste. My friends didn't believe it until they saw it for themselves.    They're very talented little creatures.
Hedgehog,38pyey,cfang,2,Fri Jun 5 21:09:25 2015 UTC,Plug her nose and she should pop right off to breathe  Just kidding I have no idea
Hedgehog,38pyey,umaros,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:38:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is the best advice,  but I read to blow in their face to make them stop. I did it once, and it worked (he was clamped on my armpit)."
Hedgehog,38pyey,umaros,3,Fri Jun 5 21:45:22 2015 UTC,I often let her crawl in my shirt. One time I guess I moved too much and I got my nipple pierced by the hedgehog. I stood up and she was just dangling off of my nipple.
Hedgehog,38pyey,hayjaylove,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a good time!  Yeah, quickly blowing a puff of air in their face usually works. It's the same with rats, too."
Hedgehog,38pyey,reverendfrag4,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:55:25 2015 UTC,mine got flung off my arm once onto a pile of pillows lol I kinda just yank my arm away now
Hedgehog,38nnqc,hayjaylove,3,Fri Jun 5 11:39:10 2015 UTC,Just so yes u know they have it posted already. File a DMCA complaint sooner rather than later.
Hedgehog,38nnqc,goblinish,2,Fri Jun 5 17:17:36 2015 UTC,Can you send me a link? I want to see if they post with the user name still on the picture  Because I can't tell that it is incredibly easy to Photoshop off
Hedgehog,38nnqc,Iceland190,4,Fri Jun 5 17:27:58 2015 UTC,Here and yes it still has the watermark and your full title stating you don't give permission for them to use it.
Hedgehog,38nnqc,goblinish,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:31:31 2015 UTC,Haha I'm not OP but not changing up the title on tumblr is hilarious
Hedgehog,38nnqc,Iceland190,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:34:44 2015 UTC,"It's so sad, this is the second one of my photos where they didnt even change the title hhahah"
Hedgehog,38nnqc,OnlyHeStandsThere,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:01:56 2015 UTC,It's a bot that does it. They just take the text right out of the titles of the posts on reddit.
Hedgehog,38q8es,Charliethehog,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:21:32 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned their girl doing something similar on another thread... a breeder said it's the 'mount me' pose for females. Just a reflexive action and nothing to worry about.   Not sure if this is the same pose or not, but if she likes you scratching her back, keep doing it!"
Hedgehog,38lowj,bonnablues,2,Fri Jun 5 00:55:04 2015 UTC,So cute. Here's lots of best wishes and happy thoughts for a long healthy life together.
Hedgehog,38lowj,goblinish,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:20:06 2015 UTC,Thank you so much!
Hedgehog,38lowj,Iceland190,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:59:14 2015 UTC,You have really nice fingernails
Hedgehog,38lowj,ndpugs,2,Fri Jun 5 04:16:28 2015 UTC,"This is reddit,  yet your compliment creeped me out a bunch. I am going to start complimenting strangers fingersnails  now."
