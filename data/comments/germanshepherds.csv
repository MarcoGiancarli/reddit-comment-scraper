Dog aggression came out after about 2 weeks and was one of the most stressful experiences I've ever had with a dog. If she does start to show aggression, don't give up on her! She can be worked with and she needs the help!"

germanshepherds,3e3gff,drewbee311,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:47:17 2015 UTC,"She is well loved, and that's all that matters now.  I love the video in the end.  It really shows her attitude and how she is still a little timid.   I would love to see her transform to be more confident around other dogs.  You can see how her tail and head are still very low, but she does like to engage with the dogs she trusts.  Beautiful girl!"

germanshepherds,3e3wwv,solarsunspot,3,Tue Jul 21 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"The rescue is One Dog Arizona, https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=264395940284595  We're estimating her age at 2. She is either fixed now or will be before adoption.  She has no training and no manners. She's climbs on the couch (which we allow all of our dogs to do) but she tends to do it by jumping on, over, or through you.  She loves face licking, with a vengeance. She's still counter surfing too. She is not food possessive or aggressive. She's great with kids, even young ones, other than the jumping.  She gets along with my other dogs (two mastiffs, one GSD). She is curious about the cat but not aggressive. She doesn't even care about my chickens.   She's a beautiful girl with a ton of potential for someone with the time and space to dedicate to a GSD."

germanshepherds,3e3yxq,CaptainCoral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"It's not any different for females than it is for males.  Just slightly different specific reasons.

germanshepherds,3e3yxq,CaptainCoral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yep.  It ain't the end of the world and the thought is that you avoid some risk of mammary cancer by doing it before their first heat.  It's definitely not a cut-and-dry situation.  I'm sure either way, you'll love the hell out of her :)"
germanshepherds,3e3yxq,jarnish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:22:28 2015 UTC,"I don't have any advice but I'm interested in this topic as well. From some limited google research I've learned that the rates of some cancers, hip dysplasia, and a couple other medical problems are reduced if you wait to neuter until after sexual maturity and the growth plates close. So around 1-1.5 years old.  I also have a 5 month old pup and I talked to my vet about it. He's on board with us waiting until puppy is around a year old to neuter. If we wait any longer than that we will be in violation of our contract with the rescue."
germanshepherds,3e3yxq,caffeinatedlackey,2,Tue Jul 21 19:51:50 2015 UTC,"For the larger breeds, a lot of people are now suggesting to wait to neuter until they are fully done growing. As the hormones are important for their development.  In addition to any research you do on your own about this, I would also suggest you talk to your vet and your breeder (if you acquired the pup from a breeder that is).  Not neutering is of course an option, but you have to really be willing to watch your dog to prevent any accidental litters."
germanshepherds,3e3yxq,Testing00112233,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's any reason to neuter if you're able to keep them from fathering an unintended litter. I'm not a ""naturalist"" per se, but I do see value in leaving things as nature intended when possible. There's also evidence out there that suggests that spaying/neutering before adulthood can lead to greater health risks down the road.  That being said, I'm all in favor of it if there are health issues directly related to repro organs.    If you're going to  neuter, at least 18 months, 24+ is better.. but only if you're 100% able to keep him away from females in heat :)"

germanshepherds,3dj8ys,Kid_sasquatch,3,Thu Jul 16 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"I've owned two and have worked with and babysat several others.(:    First of all, don't go into it expecting a quiet dog. Some dogs are, but I've found GSDs to be a bit more on the loud scale. My first boy wasn't too bad in that regards but my current girl likes to make noise. Whether it is pushing a metal bowl around or barking, she seems to be loud when she's outside just for the heck of it. Definitely make sure you nip behaviors like that in the bud and keep your dog occupied if noise would be an issue for you. My girl loves water and often makes a mess with her water bucket because of it. She drops her kong in the water purposefully just so she has to paw around in it and dunk her face in to grab it. We've had to buy her her own kiddie pool just so she doesn't keep dirtying up and spilling her drinking water. She behaves well during baths, but doesn't necessarily like being wet against her will. x) GSDs can also be prone to same sex aggression, so I'd keep that in mind. My first male luckily did not have much of an issue with this besides being a bit grumpy towards our terrier every now and then. He was excellent with people and animals alike. My current girl gets along great with our male terrier/poodle mix and adores our Mal, but has developed some SSA in adulthood and doesn't usually mix as well with other females. She loves people and does great with kids, and behaves extremely well on-leash. Early socialization is very important, both to make sure the dog behaves properly with kids/people/dogs and to make sure a nippy puppy doesn't become a bitey dog. GSDs can be very nippy. If you are getting an adult rescue this bit about early socialization probably won't apply to you, but you still need to be sure the dog you rescue will be ideal for the lifestyle you lead and will be comfortable and safe around kids/people/dogs etc if it will encounter them with you. Rescue dogs can come with baggage so I would keep that in mind, but I'm sure the organization you are talking to would be happy to help you find the ideal dog for you.(: GSDs are are relatively easy to train because they are eager to please you and very smart, but trainability does vary. My girl is more lazy than my other dogs and tends to get impatient with learning new commands(i.e high five) so teaching her tricks isn't all that simple unless I can manage to keep her avidly interested. She does well with behavioral training(leash and such) so that isn't really an issue. Sure would be fun to get her to learn tricks like my terrier, though. x)   I'd be happy to answer any specific questions you might have, but this is just a bit of info off the top of my head."
germanshepherds,3dj8ys,QuackAnnie,2,Thu Jul 16 22:00:41 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem but was determined to adopt one as well. After having one, I believe there are a few major problems that the previous commenter has already explained a bit about.    Resource guarding. You need to know how to handle this. My boy is the friendliest shepherd I know of. He goes up to everyone and every dog to look at you and see if you'd like to pet him or give him a treat. However, when he feels he's got something important whether it be a ball, stick, or water, he will not hesitate to hurt you over it. Of course, you'll get all the warning signs. My dog needs to have solid recall, leave it, and drop it. I also need to be vigilant about possible bad situations.  They play a lot rougher than you'd initially think is okay. My dog plays with his shepherd friends like bears play fighting. You have snarls, growls, and sometimes yelps. I mostly only worry about yelps. Otherwise, if other people understand, that's really just how they play. You've gotta let that go.  Don't mess with their coats! Trimming and shaving them can absolutely ruin their undercoats.  They live to be around you! My dog absolutely will not leave me alone. In his mind, where I go, he goes too.  To echo another point, they are a very vocal breed. My dog's bark is the least scary thing about him. He barks about everything when he feels he needs to.    Please feel free to ask any more specific questions."

Probably health code violations, and all the other stuck up non-pet loving people who would throw a fit if there was another dog anywhere near them.  Sometimes, pubs/bars/restaurants that have outdoor seating will let you have your dog leashed with you, but that's about the extent of dining with our furry best friends."

Females do tend to be smaller than males, though, so there's that.   I did a random Petfinder.com search for German Shepherds (I picked Miami because there tend to be TONS of shepherds in shelters in Miami), and found this guy who's listed at 38lbs. Another one, 42lbs. 2 years old and 45lbs. So yeah, they exist! Just keep looking. Maybe contact a GSD-specific rescue and let them know about your weight restriction- they might keep an eye out for you."

The one thing that's a must is a German Shepherd head. Shape and ears. That's the part I love. Thanks for the info. I'm in the Dallas area.   The thing about the private rescues and societies are the ridiculous application processes. I'd rather get one at a municipal shelter. They are for the most part kill shelters. So I'd like the chance to save a life if I can. I'm not in a real hurry to get one. Sometime before the end of the year.
germanshepherds,3dc3qt,court67,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:38:49 2015 UTC,"Rescues do have ridiculous applications, but that's for a good reason. They're generally a lot more invested in the breed so they want the adopting family to be a perfect match and the dog never enter the shelter system again. It makes sense. But I totally get wanting to go through a local shelter. I follow quite a few local shelters on Facebook and post updates almost daily. If you're willing to travel a few hours potentially, Austin Animal Center is a great one! Super active on social media, and it's a shelter environment rather than a rescue."

germanshepherds,3da4ss,Dwill1980,2,Tue Jul 14 18:10:38 2015 UTC,You might not have found the right toy for your pup! Take her to Petsmart and let her pick out her own toys. Then you can offer those instead when she starts chewing on something she shouldn't. I would personally recommend an antler. I've never met a dog who didn't want to chew on one and it can keep a pup's attention for way longer than your standard Nylabone.
germanshepherds,3da4ss,caffeinatedlackey,2,Tue Jul 14 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"An antler, okay I haven't heard of these before, I'll certainly try it. Also, taking her to Petsmart is a great idea, I honestly didn't consider taking her in to pick toys out. Thanks very much!"

germanshepherds,3d2yoz,perfringens,3,Mon Jul 13 02:44:46 2015 UTC,"i'll just give you some general pointers:   something happened and she doesn't think walks are fun. not all dogs like to walk. i would start over by walking her a block and then take her home and immediately play ball with her. or better yet take her to an unknown location, walk her a minute to an empty field and then play with her. basically teach her that walking means there is fun coming at the end of the walk. then you can slowly increase the duration of the walk.  for the pulling get a prong collar and teach the dog leash pressure. google on how to fit in correctly (high and tight) and just hold the leash by your side. when she pulls just immediately walk the other direction. the moment she turns around and follows you, release all tension from the leash. she basically learns that if she follows the leash then there will be no pressure applied to it. give a negative marker when she pulls and a positive one when she starts to follow. praise, treats, whatever. do not be one of those people who take a year to get their dog to stop pulling. pulling is simple and should be fixed within a couple of walks.  when teaching leash pressure start slow. do put put her in front of another dog where she is aroused and expect her to follow you. start in a non stimulating environment so she can learn and then slowly introduce distractions.    -its clear that treats are not working. she sounds like a normal dog where treats are awesome inside but not so awesome outside. bring her rope or ball on walks. you can even walk a block and then stop and just play with her a little."
germanshepherds,3d2yoz,packen4,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:33:12 2015 UTC,"+1 for the prong collar.  Only piece I'd maybe suggest slightly different after some research is don't necessarily walk the other direction for corrections. When you're trying to teach the dog to not pull using a prong collar, it is better in my opinion, to plant your hand holding the leash on your hip. And then just stop. Depending how the stop/turn-around and go the other way is done, the dog could feel that the correction was coming from you (the handler) -- for the best use of a prong collar, you want the dog to feel like they're in control of whether they get a correction or not. And the easiest way to avoid it is to pay attention to you; to stop when you stop and walk where you walk.   With a little training with that inside, it might actually help with not wanting to walk more than 10 minutes. She'll want to follow you."
germanshepherds,3d2yoz,cobra447,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:50:13 2015 UTC,"while both methods work, in my experience, the stop method sometimes produces a dog that gets smart and goes slightly ahead of you but is close enough that when you stop the dog can stop before there is enough tension on the leash for a correction aka the dog forges.   if the moment the dog forges ahead and i do a 180 and walk the other direction, it stops the dog from ever forging. the dog either stays right by my side or slightly behind me b/c that is the only way it can anticipate my change of direction fast enough. of course a lot of people have no problem if the dog forges as long as it isn't pulling. for me i am nitpicky and like the dog to stay slightly behind me. i've had dogs in the past that i didn't really care if they forged ahead a little bit but what i found is over time i was having to remind them to heel every block or two."
germanshepherds,3d2yoz,packen4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:09:21 2015 UTC,"I totally understand where you're coming from with this. My dog has the same ""hey come here so I can get a good sniff!"" bark going on when he sees a dog... on leash. A gentle leader is supposed to stop all that, and my dog trainer advised us to use one too. My dog won't even walk with it. He feels it's very uncomfortable on his snout.   I use this harness currently and absolutely love it.   Here's what I've been doing to minimize his nasty behavior. When you notice a dog or something else that will trigger his bad response, do your best to get her attention back, mark it, and treat. Eventually, you'll be able to get closer and closer to the stimulus. This is just to reinforce the idea that when your dog sees something it wants to go nuts over when she's on leash, she'll check on you first.   We also taught him loose leash walking the same way you're doing it but treating more randomly. Whenever she is doing something correct, you can mark and treat that. For example, whenever your dog checks in with you on the walk (makes eye contact), you can mark and treat that. Whenever the leash is loose and she's walking nicely, mark and treat. The idea is just to keep telling her to do things you like. This has taken me his entire life time (He's 13 months now.), and we're still working.   Hope this all helps! Good luck with Lucy!"
germanshepherds,3d2yoz,SpecCRA,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:06:28 2015 UTC,"/u/packen4 is bang on.  The only other thing I'd add is that you can use ""down"" to your advantage when you see her getting excited, as well.  Dog approaching?  Gather most of your leash and put your dog in a down.  Make them wait until the stimulus is gone.  Then proceed.  What you're teaching is ""capping drive"", and there are a number of videos/methods out there if you'd like to look deeper into it."
germanshepherds,3d2yoz,jarnish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:07:21 2015 UTC,My dog used to have issues with barking and being obnoxious when other dogs passed. I know it is controversial but I used an e-collar (set to vibrate) to snap her out of this behavior. When I triggered it she would be distracted by the vibration and stop barking at the other dogs. It only took a few corrections and now she just ignores them unless they come up to greet her. The e-collar is also great for off leash because I can let Jada know if she has gone too far for my liking. Now she judges the distance on her own and I only use the collar in case of emergencies like if she is getting to close to the edge of a cliff on a hike.   These collars are not for everyone but I found it to work well for me. Jada still gets lots of treats and positive reinforcement and I have never used the shock function on her because I didn't like the way it felt when I zapped myself. If you do look at this as an option make sure to educate yourself on this training method by watching videos or consulting a trainer
germanshepherds,3d2yoz,serebear,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a dog trainer but from my experience with my GSD.   I no longer use treats as a ""distraction"" because they reinforce the bad behavior and make the dog want to replicate the behavior more frequently My GSD is rather small (60 pounds), but I fixed a lot of her bad leash behavior with a choke collar. A choke collar punishes the dog by constricting their breathing when they tug or are being tugged."

Is this Degenerative Myelopathy?  It's hard to tell from the description, but since the onset usually occurs after the age of seven years, I think you're in the clear.  It's up to you.  Yes, it will be expensive to treat this.  I've paid for several MRIs over the years for my GSDs, but if you're dedicated to this, then you're in for the long haul.  I would set up a gofundme or payitforward page to help with treatment costs.  Only speaking for myself, but I donate thousands every year to redditors and other people who need help with their vet costs.    Reddit is a place full of jerks, but it's equally full of heroes.

That said, we were introduced to what the owner claimed were the parents and grandparents, and they were definitely pure GSD.  That, and his seven brothers and sisters were all a bit smaller and with smooth fur, rather than fluffy like he has.

germanshepherds,3cp1dn,doppelganger_eidolon,2,Fri Jul 10 00:56:02 2015 UTC,"No. His ears aren't likely to stand up, but you shouldn't worry about it.  In all the pups I have seen they are up by 6 months. When the ears look like this it is because something went wrong. They were damaged by rough play, the owner, or just different.  I have yet to meet a flopped eared GSD that wasn't as awesome as the next pup. The only drawback is you might lose a little in expression. But owners that haven't had a GSD before have no idea.  cute pup. Love black GSDs.  Is your pup fresh from a bath in this pic? That fur looks interesting."

germanshepherds,3ck23m,ironshoe,5,Wed Jul 8 18:10:14 2015 UTC,He is ~45 lbs right now and growing quickly. His mom is pure GSD but the dad is ? so we're trying to track his growth against pure GSD puppies.  Obligatory photo!
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,Green_Bay_Fappers,3,Thu Jul 9 08:24:42 2015 UTC,"I am not a vet or an animal specialist  Now that that's out of the way, some things about this sound fishy. But let's talk about it one by one...  Biting: This is an issue that will not resolve after one week. 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 120 weeks, it's something GSDs need to learn over time. Mouthing and biting are not directly related to leaving the mother too soon, but you do need to teach the dog that biting is not ok in the mother's stead. If the dog stayed with the litter, he would learn this by interacting with his siblings and his mother scolding him when he does it.(With yips, nips, and grips)  I don't see how an accidental pregnancy has anything to do with the pup's current age. The breeder should not have released the pup until 8 weeks.  100 miles is a long way to go to drop the pup off for a week, and I don't know how much time has passed since you got the dog. I don't really know the right answer but if it were me I don't think I would take it back, it sounds like the breeder is not very responsible. I would socialize the pup with as many other dogs and as much as possible, though.  There are a lot of developmental issues that come with the pup leaving the litter too soon so you should be careful. But, biting is something every GSD owner has to deal with, taking the pup back to the breeder for a few weeks will not magically make that go away."
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,smallof2pieces,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:24:45 2015 UTC,I'm teaching him not to bite by hand feeding him for some meals and tapping his nose and saying no when he does. A friend told me that i should tap the dog on the nose so he gets an idea of what's wrong.    I will definitely take my dog to the dog park and my cousins house a lot as soon as Monday because he just got his vaccinations.   I just picked him up on Tuesday and to me it seems the breeder just wanted to get the dog out ASAP. And since you told me that GSDs will learn not to bite over time I'm relieved because I was worrying that he'd become aggressive because he left the litter too early. I will definitely get him socialized asap and hopefully he'll learn a thing or two from the OGs.
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,cobra447,2,Thu Jul 9 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go for the tapping on the nose piece, tbh. Dogs' noses are really sensitive.   If the dog doesn't show any signs of dominance, go for a yelp, get up and walk away. Face away. Your pup will quickly learn that biting can hurt and not to bite you, or play time is over.   If there's signs of dominance, you want to be more careful with the above.   I do agree with /u/smallof2pieces -- I wouldn't bring the dog back at this point. Breeder should have waited until 8 weeks -- if they didn't, they're probably not a very responsible breeder. I wouldn't want my dog spending any time with him that it wouldn't need to.  Please don't take the dog to the dog park. I'm not big on dog parks as a whole -- too many irresponsible owners bring misbehaving dogs, without shots, it's just asking for issues imo. BUT more so for your pup. S/he's just a baby at this point. Interacting with other dogs is great for her. But you want to make sure it's dogs you know and trust and thats' owners will be responsible and make sure your dog doesn't get nipped/hurt/afraid.   A dog at a young age getting attacked by another dog can make the dog ""dog aggressive"" for the rest of its life.   If your cousin has a dog, that's a great option. If any of your neighbours you know have dogs that are well behaved it maybe a good idea to help introduce your pup to them."
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,jasonhuber,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:48:26 2015 UTC,Okay I'll just yelp to show he's hurting me and just walk away for a little bit. The puppy is really calm but always wants someone around to olay with which is understandable. So the whole taking the dog back to the breeder is now out of question and I will just take him to my cousin's house and he can play with his dog. And also dog park is out of the question now that you told me.
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,jasonhuber,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"Yes. When my GSD bites (she was a real biter when she was a pup) I will stop scratching her or whatever. She immediately closes her mouth.  Now it isn't biting, but any mouth or teeth on skin I stop and she immediately closes her mouth.  Unless you run. Then she will stop you from running by biting your person. No running."
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,jasonhuber,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:24:41 2015 UTC,Yeah he bites me on my legs and hands whenever i try to get his leash out from under his legs. I tell him no dont do it but he continues and I yelled and he stopped and he licked my hand after and didn't want to bite no more. That just happened.  Right now he is sleeping in front of my legs. Does that mean anything if he sleeps under my legs or right next to me?
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,signpostlake,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:00:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah he is play-biting, but it needs to stop. He isn't mad at you.  So if you yelp and move away and ignore him that is your only hope. When he comes around to be nice you be nice too of course."
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,signpostlake,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:21:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it works sometimes, and then I'll leave and come back and he's back to the same. It'll just be a lot of repetitions to get it right"
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,signpostlake,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:51:52 2015 UTC,Yes it will :) Stick to it.
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,CranberryMoonwalk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"My GS is still biting at 5 months. The only thing that works if he's getting a little out of hand and it hurts is a really short time out. Either he goes in the kitchen or I leave the room. It takes seconds for him to calm  I keep finding his baby teeth everywhere so I'm hoping once his adult ones are though, the mouthing settles down"
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,smallof2pieces,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:40:13 2015 UTC,"Oh man, so this thing really can't be solved in a couple of weeks then with the mother huh? It seems that GSDs really need to be trained a lot with biting and nipping then. Would only hand feeding help a lot?"
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,smallof2pieces,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:39:49 2015 UTC,"I think hand feeding helped our pup be more gentle but biting has nothing to do with the breed, it's a puppy thing. Difference is you don't notice when a smaller breed is biting you as much as a GSD, they're really big puppies!  Also I found our pup to be extremely smart. He learnt come, stay, off and house training so quickly which makes me think that the biting is down to teething more than anything else. I know it's difficult but it's really important to be patient. Don't physically punish him or his teething bites will turn aggressive"
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,jarnish,2,Thu Jul 9 17:48:46 2015 UTC,Yeah he is more gentle with me and even listens to me when i say sit without even having a treat! He likes to sleep around me and follows me everywhere but hates being in a crate. He pees in there but sleeps outside of it. So he's very smart but a little whiny which all dogs are. I sometimes just put my hand in his mouth to see what he does and now he'll usually take it out and lick it a little.  He nibbles on my feet and slippers a lot which kind of hurt but not too much. And yeah i don't want to physically harm him in any way at all but a friend with a gsd told me he taps on his dogs nose and he'll usually stop what he's doing and pay attention. But if itll cause aggression then I'll stop that and do you know if speaking in a loud voice will cause aggression?
germanshepherds,3cnlnt,rightneardabeach,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:38:08 2015 UTC,I don't think shouting will directly cause aggression but it might frighten him which may cause him to lash out. If he's anything like my pup he won't like being told no full stop. We've had lots of growls when he's being told to stop doing something. It is getting less frequent though
