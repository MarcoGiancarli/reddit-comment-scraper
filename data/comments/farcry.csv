However, yes it's very weak. An APU is a CPU and GPU combined, in the future they might benefit us more but for now they're more low-end and essentially just for laptops and desktops without* graphics cards.  That's why the game is so slow, your only option is turn the game settings down as much as possible and make the window resolution smaller so there's less for the computer to calculate."

The game also uses RAM, you would benefit a few frames per second by upgrading not the size of the RAM but the clock speed, or Mhz rating.

I'm overclocking my card 15%, but that's all, I used to run it on high settings, then upgraded my cpu and ram and was able to push it to ultra without ever seeing lag, even during crazy gameplay. I refuse to get into a lesson-argument where I teach how games work and how ram and cpu are important as well as gpu, so if you don't believe me that's fine, I tested it myself before and after and know what I saw.  Also, people say things like ""the textures alone are more than that"", well guess what? It doesn't load the entire texture file to play the game."

At least the GTX750Ti delivers a more consistent experience, with the same minimum fps as the GTX980!  EDIT: I wasn't going to say this, but changed my mind.  Of course everyone is entitled to their preference, but my take on ""high frame rate"" in games is much the same as some criticisms of HFR movies.  Because it is more a ""realistic"" presentation, it exposes more harshly any shortcomings of the material being presented.  For instance, when I watched ""The Hobbit"" at 48fps instead of the traditional 24fps, I disliked it, because it looked more obviously like what it was: actors on a set.    The same is somewhat true of games.  I remember the first time I played Far Cry 2 at 60fps (on my humble rig, after playing it at 30fps on a PS3) it just felt odd to me, more real yet less real.  Of course, there are also issues of responsiveness, but I don't find 30fps hard to manage.  I would not want to go significantly lower, but I don't feel the urge to go a lot higher either.  But, as I said, to each his or her own."
farcry,3e2ire,Kieffers,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:42:19 2015 UTC,"My 970 never, ever dips below 60FPS in Far Cry 4. Ever. It's a pretty well optimized game, and averages around 70FPS with everything maxed out.   When in the context of gaming, lower framerate has no upsides, no matter what. There is no reason to like it, as it is worse, plain and simple, it's objectively better in all regards. movies are a different story entirely, but there is no debate when it comes to games."

And we don't really have any more info on whether or not there will be another ziggy's mod than you do. Although I believe the majority of limitations the mod imposed in-game can easily be replicated through an appreciable amount of options added into the game since 3 including the option to turn off all kinds of things like the detection meter, enemy tagging (including for the camera), minimap, co-op marker, whether or not you see objective markers etc.  Personally I just craft the first upgrade in each category (so I can only carry around a primary and a pistol), ramp the difficulty up (which is thankfully MUCH harder than FC3's hardest difficulty) and turn off all of that HUD clutter. It was fun doing the terminator schtick for the first run through but I always felt Far Cry was better suited for by the grit of your teeth guerrilla style warfare over automatic grenade launchers and explosive snipers.

I promise once China steps into play that you will find yourself scrambling to keep formation and set up firing positions it gets tough especially if you cut out your HUD and combat indicators then all you have is your eyes and a tac map that you have to get into cover and lay low to use.

farcry,3coi5d,Treviso,3,Thu Jul 9 16:49:43 2015 UTC,"M79 as my sidearm, no question.  You can do a lot with this weapon alone, take out vehicles, groups of enemies, heavies, rain hell down from a buzzer.  Lately I have been carrying an assault rifle because most enemies drop assault rifles so ammo pickups are easy.  I have not unlocked the bushman, so I use its ordinary counterpart (P416).  Not the highest damage per shot, but rate of fire makes up for it.  Since it is not silenced, I tend not to use it unless I am in a fire fight.  I generally carry a silenced sniper, because I like to snipe and stay undetected.    I have also grown fond of the autocross.  Quiet but deadly, and you can pick up most of your bolts so running out of ammo is not usually an issue.  Sometimes I swap it out for The Bull (signature silenced shotgun).  EDIT: note that the Bull has super long reload, so don't use it when standing there reloading your shotgun one shell at a time might put you at a disadvantage. :)"

Rain some hell with the gl flank around when they come looking and pick em off.

Depending on the mission there may be other weird effects going on also.    I think they are dumb quests, but i think some or all of them are required to progress through the game.  Theres also a bit about drugs in the main story, amita & sabal have different plans for how to fund the rebels.

The game is simply not old enough I think, and Ubisoft especially likes to create new versions of games with similar engines than rehashes.  If you want better graphics load it up on PC and play with a controller.    I understand the apparent ease or frustration that anyone with a PS4/XB1 would have with missing a library of games, but they aren't from this console generation.  I personally would hate for the next 3 years to be rereleases just to satiate that market.    Onto the second point of it being the best in the series, FC has a very unique role much like FF in that they can keep some core mechanics and switch up everything else.  Story, locale, protagonist and weaponset can change from game to game making the series much more like a snapshot than a continuing saga.  For this reason FC3 will be the favourite of some, and others it might be FC2.  FC2 remake, it being the older game, is much more likely in my mind."

Humans and elephants can swim in FC4.  2) AI is lot more smarter, behaves much better. e.g. Enemies in FC3 would detect faster when enemies are killed with bow.  3) Drive and shoot.  4) Player can hide bodies.  5) Bait.  6) New types of side missions. Most of side missions in FC3 were killing someone with knife and killing animals with bow.  7) Grapple hook.  8) Lot of new weapons.  9) Crafting syringes in FC3 was mess. FC4 simplies this very much.  10) One of the syringes makes enemies visible through walls without tagging. Enemies were hardly visible in FC3, FC4 tags them by default.  11) Hunters - stealth and deadly.  12) Shangri-la. New enemies.

Mines are thrown in FC4. Mines, C4 and grenades can also be sticky in FC4.  17) Choices. You get missions based on your choices. Destroy or defend.  18) Improved radio system.  19) Loot animations can be disabled.  20) Disabling one alarm would disable all alarms in FC3.

In fact, the only upgrade I completed was weapon holster since everything else felt like overkill.   2) Getting knocked down. I don't remember this happening in 3, but enemies like the Yak can get an instant kill by repeatedly knocking you down without a chance to heal or run away or even fight back.   3) The wingsuit is much less useful when you have so much more trees to run into, something annoying design wise.   Some stuff I'll add that it did better:  1) The grappling hook was a cool new mechanic.   2) Bait was interesting, though I didn't use it much.   3) Elephants! Those guys made charging into an enemy outpost so much more fun.   4) Buzzers were a great way to get around, and if you tok the grenade launcher sidearm it got even more fun.   5) Pimping out your house is entertaining. Nice to have a home base."
farcry,3bk0f4,tomaneion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:24:21 2015 UTC,"1) Same. I just use old save with all crafting done.  2) There was skill in Far Cry 3 that disabled knocking down by enemies. FC4 has removed this, you will knocked down by enemies unless you use a syringe that disables it for a while. FC4 also removed few other skills like gun cooler, but adds better skills like cover and vehicle takedowns. You can still get knocked down by buffaloes in FC3. I think Yaks are just reskin of buffaloes.  3) Same. I just want to jump and suddenly wingsuit will open and I will lose 3 bars of health. They need to change key binding for wingsuit."

If they were just rare weapons that were more than a base gun with all three attachments it would've been awesome, but most of them just made me stick to plain guns.

If someone were to play 1 and 2 without the name identification anywhere I pet 95% of people wouldn't make the connection it shares a name.

There's an article where Ubisoft said they wanted player to immerse into game, so they gave minimum dialogs to Ajay. Ajay is the most boring character in all games I have played. He doesn't even have any opinions, doesn't ask any questions back. Sabal: Kill Pagan Min. Ajay: OK."
farcry,3bk0f4,outtokill7,5,Wed Jul 1 08:10:49 2015 UTC,Character development in 4 wasn't that great. Ajay was silent the whole game and did everything he was told and seemed to be a master with weapons right off the bat. Amita and Sabal got annoying very fast.

However, I f----g HATED the story. The drugged/supernatural missions were particularly bad. And it was clear early on that Amita/Sabal was a lose/lose game and it was something that I was just going to have to endure if I wanted to complete the game.  Personally, I'd have shot them both in the throat and looked after the country myself - particularly as I'd done all the bloody work.

It felt like a really bizarre way to kill Yuma especially, since she basically had every opportunity to finish Ajay off, and then during his acid trip of a dream (the foreboding of who you currently supported in the balance of power was cool), you kill some random other guy with a bow and when you wake up? Bam! She and the guards are all magically dead. Seriously, wtf?"
farcry,3bk0oc,DrFlatSoda,3,Mon Jun 29 21:14:56 2015 UTC,"Well FC3's map editor was purely for competitive MP maps while FC4's is for custom missions to be played either solo or co op so the product of each's are hardly comparable. I much prefer the ability to create missions even though I do miss custom MP maps, a lot of them could be pretty bad and there weren't a huge amount of people playing them anyways, despite how many people apparently miss them.  Idk if you meant to write that you played FC3 on pc and last gen since you're asking how the FC3 editor compares to FC4's.  So, in terms of assets since the game takes place in your average northern hemisphere coniferous forests so there's actually a relatively lower amount of variation between environments compared to FC3, although some of the texture assets are still there they did not carry over any fauna or vegetation so while we do still have a healthy amount of possible settings to choose from there's quite a few textures that don't actually have any matching vegetation for them.  Overall the tools and interface are mostly the same. It's cleaner and quicker which I like and I never personally had any issues with controls or thought there were any features missing or something I wish I could do but couldn't, if there is it's usually because I haven't figured out how to do it with the tools I already have yet. There are some cool new things like the ability to change ambient lighting and background vistas which can totally change the feel of a map, but they've also taken away our storm factor and there's actually no rain in the game (only a light snow setting) which is lame but eh whatcha gonna do.   Modifiers are the biggest change I think, and allow you to custom tailor your mission to be how you like it: you can make it fail upon detection, fail upon the alarm being raised, how much health players have, which pieces of the HUD are visible, player's starting loadouts, make it headshot only, make it one shot kill (for players V enemies or enemies V players, there's a setting for each one individually) etc etc.  If you want to get some ideas of what can be done with the editor once you get it, look on youtube/play some of the ""Featured"" maps, many of them are made by people on the ubisoft team and the ""Top rated"" anythings are basically nothing but god mode bullshit."

It's Dances with Wolves, it's The Last Samurai, it's The Last Mexican, it's Avatar. It's FC3 and it's FC4 as well, even if FC4 tried to expand on it and had a lot of interesting ideas the writing staff of the far cry games never were the biggest fans of fleshing out the story.  The most interesting part was the amita/sabal power play. All Sabal ever did was talk about how awesome shit was gonna be when he was made king when pagan min was dead, and oh hey yeah while you're here ajay can you go kill pagan min for me? Cool! I listened to each of their proposals and more than once was Sabal ready to react with a literal ""That BITCH!"" and being ""moral"" only gets you so far when you do absolutely nothing for your cause and have no tactical thought process whatsoever.

I've only finished the game once so I haven't really experience any other endings to compare to, but I didn't kill anyone in the campaign. It just never felt like I had any reason to, none of them had personally wronged me in a way I felt was personal or avoidable. Even Pagan Min, despite doing the stupid Borderlands 2 thing where his primary characterization as the main villain mostly involves giving you a ring at random intervals in the story to read you the latest list of help staff he had executed, it didn't feel like there was any point. Even if he did deserve to die, it wasn't at my hands, he hadn't personally wronged me, only retaliated once I joined the rebellion and started mass murdering his military. The uprising had begun, happened, and finished, and there was nobody left to listen to his orders.

I agreed that the only way to keep Kyrat going is to establish a market on an international stage by selling anything we could find, even if that meant opium. Sabal's POV really seemed unnecessary to me; i didn't really care about the culture or the religion, i wanted the best for the future of Kyrat. But in Yuma's hallucination, i saw Amita draw more and more comparisons to Pagan Min; killing civilians in the name of Kyrat, destroying religion we were trying to keep for the locals, and she was biased on the POV of Kyrati customs and traditions. I was pretty horified, so i had no choice- Amita had to die. I never cared much for Sabal but push came to shove and eventually i shot Amita. And to keep things short, i let Pagan Min live. I never wanted to kill him, i wanted to side with him and i wish i could have. I wanted him gone however, and i'm glad i got the option to let him leave.

Or maybe a couple of smaller daggers instead of your daily machete capable of doing the classic double takedown, at the expense of not being able to do heavy takedowns.  All attachments for all guns, ESPECIALLY all the fucking upgrades and attachments in multiplayer that they never let you use in single player.

Instead the entire games map was this boring forest, every place in the games world looked like everyother place.  I think a good setting could be some where along the Andes mountains in South America, perhaps on the edge of Bolivia & Peru. You can separate the map into 3 regions; the eastern half is lush rainforest and rivers, the central band is a tall snowcapped mountain chain in an alpine region. And then on the western side of the map in the mountaisn rainshadow have a high desert valley complete with volcanoes, canyons and towering dunes close to the coast."

Also I'd demand the animation team create no less than 5 different animations for switching off the device, just so we don't have to see the same one every time. maybe you see new ones as you capture more, so it's like the character is more familiar with how to deactivate them.  -Blow out the take-down system. Take-downs would be a huge focus for ""my"" FarCry, as I love them. They only added 2 to FC4 and actually REMOVED the dual death from above. I'd make it so there are take-downs for every weapon type (so obvi some are loud) but there'd also be move-specific take-downs as well, like a sliding take-down, and a crouching take-down different from the standing one. Multiple melee weapon types, so takedowns depending on what you're using. ANIMAL TAKEDOWNS, if you can sneak up on an animal, or get the drop on it, you can do a takedown on it, double skins to boot! No more strafing around a tree to get that 4th rhino skin! Also clearer representation of if you'll actually connect with a takedown, like DFA, so you can avoid just loosing half health when you land right in front of an enemy because for some dumb reason it decided not to let you get the DFA you were going for....  -New/ replacement weapons. No one I know actually likes using the scorpion, get that thing outta there and bring back the micro-uzi from FC2! also the USAS12, add in a SCAR, get rid of some of the random lame pistols and put in more modern weapons, but some cool new ones as well. SPEARS! slower than a bow and less range, but way more damage! and a specific takedown as well!  -Speaking of, weapons are no longer free for deacivating the EMP devices, instead doing that unlocks a mission you have to do to get that weapon! Deactivate the EMP, then do a mission that ends with finding a new weapon/ gadget or something.   Better move-set/ navigational skills! In ""MY"" FarCry, player characters have human to slightly above human ankle strength!! No more 1&1/2 bars of health gone from a 4 foot drop! If anything, you'd be able to fall from an unrealistically HIGH height before taking damage than an annoyingly low one.   -Outposts obviously make a return, not a whole lot needs to change to the system, but rather than outposts you're leaving being the only ones getting attacked it'd just be one you're nearby so it's not like, ""hey, i know you were just running out of here, but come back cause now they're here' and if you don't help it'd actually get taken back rather than just nothing happening....

Keep signature weapons, but don't do weapons that are ordinary guns with three attachments and a skin. We can make more interesting rare guns than that.   LESS DRUG/TRIPPING BALLS/HALLUCINATIONS. I don't know why every boss battle revolves around these and I don't know what they keep adding them for. It made the game feel like it had plot holes in it more than anything.   Jason was a kind of interesting character. Dump Ajay, he basically says nothing and is magically a rebel hero within the first 20 minutes of the game.   Plot wise: don't acknowledge that you can literally solo outposts and bases, or at least not like Ajay does for the first outpost of the game. At least give the story some time before you become a crazy god.   Moments in 4 where you discovered who your father, mother, and the half sister were awesome! Do more of that.   Better enemy variety. I think there's a total of 6-8 unique soldiers in Far Cry 4? The animals are good but the human soldiers need a bit of work.   Add little bits more of detail. After beating the campaign, and seeing the hidden cutscene with Sabal/Amita post game, you have the opportunity to kill the new dictator. I chose to kill Amita and the game didn't even acknowledge it. Add the little bit of detail, its worth it to the players!  Change towers. The mechanic is a little worn out now. I like the idea of having to quest and search for a map or something.   More attachments. 4's campaign only lets you add extended mag, new sight, and a suppressor to every gun. Stuff like they have in the multiplayer should be there too.   Something huge I think they butchered: the skill tree in Far Cry 4 was awful. I loved the concept of 3's and felt like the fourth was jist a dumbed down version of the previous game's. Plus, I thought many of the perks were flat out useless.

I thought the main story was excellent, but the side-quests were very weak (except for the Fashion Week quests - I thought they were hilarious). Shangrai-la with Reggie and Yogi made me want to tear my hair out. It did annoy me that you constantly had to chose between Sabal and Amita, I would've like the option to unite them. Pagan Min was such a jerk and was one of the most entertaining characters I've found in a game in a long time.   Combat was relatively easy. I like a challenge when I'm playing and this is where FC4 really lacked for me. By the time I had gotten to the end of the main story I was ready to finish playing - free roaming and gathering collectables just bored me. Liberating outposts were far too easy once you'd up-skilled your character and acquired attachments.  One of my favourite features was the Arena. That was a feature I had a lot of fun with.

You start out stealing weapons and supplies (every single building has supplies/weapons in it, and the map has a few hidden locations with extra firepower) and work your way to more advanced firepower/tactics, like stealing a truck with a mounted MG on it and going to town or taking over an enemy mortar emplacement and luring enemy soldiers into your area of effect with your coop partner spotting.

farcry,3a2j5y,ThexJwubbz,-1,Wed Jul 1 08:55:07 2015 UTC,"I would love to show you my newest map!  So my old comment got deleted so i'm going to keep this relatively short. I have made over 100 maps in both FC2 and FC3 and love the map editor; its my favorite part of the fallout series. I just made a map that has all you seem to be looking for: forests, rivers, lakes, mountains, beautiful landscaping. Using different types of shaders, the sky is pitch-black. A village is tucked away in these mountains, and it has been through an earthquake and many other hardships, as many buildings lay demolished. In addition, enemy molotov and flamer units have burned whats left of the city while snipers stand guard on the rooftops. Using the cover of night, murder the guards, disable the alarms.  Now, it gets challenging. I aimed for this map to be as intense and difficult as Far Cry 2 was if you have played it, and it is very difficult without getting impossible. Once you clear the first wave of troops, 2 waves of molotov and flamer troops come in to try to finish the job. After that, a wave of beheaders rush in from all sides to try to storm the village. Not hard enough? This whole time, an enemy mortar team will try to blow you up from a hill outside the village. Still too easy? The last round consists of 5 squads of 2 flamers and 1 rocket trooper to try to storm the village all night long, lighting up the sky as well as the village. And if that wasn't hard enough, there is also 2 more mortars to take care of on the surrounding hills outside of the city. You finish when the sun comes up. Good luck.  Starting Loadout #1: D2, M-700, Autocross, Recurve Bow, Revolver, limited ammo.  Starting Loadout #2: SV Sniper, D50, Scorpion, flare gun.   LD1 will drop you in a mountainous forest far away from the burning village, LD2 will drop you beside a lake on a mountain overlooking the village. Limited ammo makes for an intense and hectic city of chaos.  EDIT: this was not relatively short."

Once you start getting your own weapons, the missions get better, all the tutorial stuff is over with and the whole malaria situation is taken care of, that's when it gets rewarding to play imo.  Taking out the convoys in Far Cry 2 is my favorite thing of all time in a Far Cry game. Rigging the bridge with C4 and blowing it up from football fields away was my style.  Far Cry 2 feels more desolate and dangerous too, you don't have any allies at all you're just alone out there. Especially at night it's quite unsettling to travel around."

farcry,39wfww,allWoundUp357,9,Mon Jun 15 18:42:03 2015 UTC,"===SPOILERS===  .  The only problem I have with FC4's story is that Ajay really has no reason to stay in Kyrat after he finds out what's going on. He could probably just call up Pagan himself and ask him to arrange transportation back to the states. I really didn't like the whole ""your parents started the war, now you have to finish it even though you were too young to even know about it and had nothing to do with it"" angle. Putting myself in Ajay's shoes, that doesn't compel me at all to fight for you. If anything, I should accept Pagan's offer because it's the safe, easy route and both of the Golden Path leaders are completely insane, perhaps more so than the guy they want dead.  At least in FC3 you're trying to save your friends so you have incentive to fight the pirates. But I really hated how Vaas died. You kill him while under the influence of psychoactive drugs, just like you did Yuma in FC4, which was also a really really bad fight sequence. This is the main antagonist, the guy responsible for your brother's death and your friends' suffering. You want to see this guy suffer the same way. But instead you just stab him a few times (which may or may not even be real) and it's over. At least in FC4 Yuma was just an annoying side character.  As a side note, what is it with female characters in Far Cry being really naggy and ungrateful? In FC4 it was Amita flipping her shit when Sabal sacrifices the other guy to save you, even though to the Golden Path you're practically Jesus Christ himself. In FC3, Liza gets mad at you for killing pirates who are literally just tried to burn you alive and are currently trying to murder the two of you."
farcry,39wfww,FrightenedOfSpoons,5,Mon Jun 15 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"You can actually side with pagan and end the game in 20 minutes, the way you said. When he takes you to the table for dinner at the very beginning and says to stay there, if you wait for about 10 minutes, he comes back. You scatter your mom's ashes and go home. I noticed that too with the Far Cry women. Nagging bitches."

farcry,39wfww,allWoundUp357,2,Mon Jun 15 19:49:41 2015 UTC,"I see it as more than just an Easter egg.  Like FC2, FC4 was more about choices than FC3, which really gave you no choices.  You had to choose, at the start, to join that civil war, even if you did not appreciate it as a choice at the time.    There is, to my mind, a division between people who like to be told a story (FC3, you are Jason, and this is what Jason thought and felt), and people who like to participate in the story (FC4 and especially FC2, the protagonist is mainly silent and you get to decide what he is thinking and feeling).  Neither is more correct, of course, but it leads people to prefer one over the other."

farcry,39wfww,ThatGuyGaren,3,Mon Jun 15 23:51:58 2015 UTC,Yeah fuck joining a civil war you know shit about just cause your father started it decades ago. If anything I'd have sided with pegan rather than Amita or Sabal. They're worse than pegan.
farcry,39wfww,ThatGuyGaren,5,Mon Jun 15 19:05:08 2015 UTC,"There was a real sense of growth to Jason. You start off as kind of a preppy asshole that has no idea what he's doing, but as you level up and get skills unlocked, you turn into this nightmarish jungle predator that's so far removed from how you started out, you really do feel like a badass.   Ajay is cool and all, but you pretty much start off the equivalent of Rambo. The Golden Path rescues you, hands you a machine gun, and you're suddenly killing trained soldiers like you've been doing it for years and tearing up the countryside like you've lived there your whole life. There's some profile background about him having a ""troubled upbringing,"" which you might consider code for ""merciless murderer,"" but that's unlikely.   Sadly, this second option has been discussed by Ubisoft's president as the way most of their games will go in the future, because players aren't all that interested in story development or character growth... according to him, all they want to do is wreck shit."
farcry,39wfww,Namkcalb,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:34:17 2015 UTC,"But Jason is killing bloodthirsty pirates within hours (actual time is more like ten minutes) of landing on the island. It's kind of silly to judge the playable character's development by their willingness to kill since it's all on the player. Jason may have been reluctant at first, and he almost seems remorseful when he stabs that first guy... kinda like how Ajay was visibly shaken when the driver of his getaway vehicle was killed when they got run off the road.  And it's not like Ajay starts off with all the skills unlocked, you know."
farcry,39wfww,ThatGuyGaren,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:57:56 2015 UTC,"A lot of it, at least for me, had to do with how they unlocked the skill tree.  Sure, in FC3 you could go and liberate the entire north island right after the first mission but you aren't going to get any of the cool abilities until you progress far enough into the storyline.  In FC4 most of the skill tree was side quest driven, meaning that after you unlocked the entirety of the first area you went from zero to rambo in nothing flat.  And the copter made it way to tempting to do so."

You automatically become a higher up, basically second in command to whomever you choose to lead, no one doubts your judgement either.

That said, the great stuff about FC3 is mostly there - solid, varied gunfight on pretty terrain. The weapons on the whole feel more hefty and the emphasis is on slower-paced, methodical (almost tactical) planning. Since you don't have takedowns, stealth is more challenging.  The story is also amazing, and the lighting and fire effects still looks better to me than FC3/4. Definitely worth a shot."

You can die easily, so the gameplay is more focused on stealth and planning. Very hostile game world.  You have a buddy system.  Your buddy will come rescue you when you die every now and again to give you a fighting chance.  This game is really hard, especially on higher difficulties. Weapons will rust and jam during firefights, i like this feature. You have Malaria.  If you run out of pills, your Malaria will kill you. The story is centered around you being one of a few selectable mercs who come into a war torn african country to hunt and kill an arms dealer named The Jackal (possibly jack; the main character from from FC1).   Voice acting is very odd.  Everyone speaks in mushed together sentences and they all speak very quickly.  I don't know if this was a design choice or if they didn't wanna bother with voice actors.   The game feels like it's always trying to kick you when you're down and it feels oppressive, so the gameplay, while mostly similar, feels completely different at the same time.

farcry,39v3fj,Benlarge1,5,Mon Jun 15 01:18:58 2015 UTC,Far Cry is pretty unique in that it doesn't penalize you whether one goes with stealth or chaos. In that sense there really isn't any modern stealth game that gives you such a choice without penalization or ability to play with such versatile and strong options.
farcry,39v3fj,thestuffedone,0,Mon Jun 15 03:41:35 2015 UTC,I find locking a skill until you take 2 outposts stealthy is penalizing the player. I noticed this in FC4 when I had taken all easy outposts except the first one in Rambo manner.  Took me some time to find a medium outpost which I could stealth to unlock that !#%* skill.
farcry,39v3fj,HonkHorn,4,Mon Jun 15 12:14:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, you do not have to do it stealthy, just undetected.  Easily done with a silenced sniper, pretty much every outpost has a conveniently located knoll that overlooks the whole camp.  This works in FC3 and FC4.  In FC4 you can also use the rocket launcher with cluster munitions, you can take out a whole outpost from a long way away with just a couple of rounds.  Or chuck in some bait and let the local wildlife handle it.  That's what I love about these games, so many choices!"

You then have the choice to kill him or not.  if you choose Amita, she kills Bhadra and forces every kid into becoming soldiers, and then again you have the choice to kill her or not.

An FC3 remaster or some kind of Blood Dragon-esque standalone DLC would be nice, but I don't want the series to just be more Far Cry 3 in different settings, since I really enjoyed the major changes in tone and gameplay between the first 3. Of course I think to accomplish this they need more time to hopefully move in a new direction and avoid the problems FC4 had with being hard to run and being  too similar to FC3."

Hunt, early and fervently, to craft the various inventory upgrades available to you. Use syringes. I know I said that already, but you just won't believe how worth your while it is to give yourself an advantage over your prey. And upgrading your syringe pack will just make it that easier to feel encouraged to use its contents.  Don't bother buying any weapons, just complete side missions and take radio towers, and very nearly everything will be given to you without needing to spend money on anything but ammo and weapon mods.  Oh. Except signatures. Buy the signature weapons. Mmm...  Loot everyone and everything. Sell anything that won't make syringes or get you a bigger and better wallet/holster/munitions bag/whatever. Swim in the fabulous wealth of a drug addled third world paradise, and never want for anything again because you only need to spend it on the copious ammo you'll be pumping into pirates and wildlife.  Don't be afraid to ignore story missions to explore for relics, journals, or treasures on the map. The true joy of the game is in exploring the open world, because each crevice and cavern and cave is like a small exploration puzzle, each usually with accompanying narrative that is communicated through what you find there.

Lakshmana, to someone who chose that ending without knowing the others, was symbolic for the land of Kyrat and its fallen people.

I know it's generally better, but I don't see the point in a stealth weapon if it's a not a 1-hit kill.    THAT ASIDE   1) Bow, as stated above.  2) D2 for everything invincible.  3) Either a silenced SA-50 or a Shredder, usually.  This slot changes a lot.  It's either a sniper or assault weapon, though.  4) Sidearm GL (forgot its name) or the Buzzsaw.  Usually the GL though, for driving.  Basically I run around with a D2 in hand in case I run into some serious shit, but I switch to the bow at the soonest opportunity.  The Shredder is for big fights where I can't use the bow because of battle pace, and also when I get attacked by an animal during an outpost takeover (which happens all the fucking time).  The GL is a last resort for heavies, helicopters, and cars.  Sticky grenades are basically bottled badass.  If you get your timing right, you can give the Royal Army a surprise frontflip in their trucks.    I like to stick to mid- or close-range, or at least within bowshot (so about 100m or so) and scout the place first, memorizing enemy search patterns and such.  I'll pick a target order and find places to hide each body.  Well, I sometimes do all this.  Other times I just Leroy Jenkins my way in.  Once I actually just camped in a Buzzer above an outpost and rained grenades down on them.  It's like a mortar, but better.    For story missions, I ended up siding with Amita the first time, then Sabal, then Amita again.  Of course, out of moral concerns, I killed them after I finished the game (also blew up Pagan post-Lakshmana but that's not relevant).  I ended up giving up on making moral choices in the game, and just rolling with the fun.    I absolutely HATE the missions preceding and including killing Yuma, so I blast through those as fast as possible.    On to FC3!!!  I usually stick with only one weapon here--either a silenced MS16 or a bow (sometimes a repair tool as well).  I play on Master with every option turned off, just because I'm too used to the game for any lower difficulty to be fun.  I've memorized all the outposts, so I need a fresh challenge.  Have't modded at all, so I can't get rid of my minimap, but after playing Mirror's Edge, I'm sold on HUD-less games.  I can deal with not knowing my health--the trick is to not get shot!    The only really shitty part about FC3 is the lack of underwater combat.  At least give me SOMETHING to kill sharks and gators with.  They're worse than the eagles in 4.  I always do a 360 when I jump in the water to scan for marine asswipes.  That's pretty much all.  Only played a little bit of FC2, so I can't say anything about that one."

farcry,38oxqu,crockpocket,28,Fri Jun 5 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"Far Cry 3 had a much more interesting main character. Jason was, for the most part, a rich, immature, Californian early-20-something thrown into an insane situation that slowly corrupted him to the point where he actually started feeling a sense of accomplishment with every person he killed. The story started pretty fucked up, and it only got darker and more fucked up as it moved along.  Spoilers ahead, FYI.  Jason's brother gets killed right in front of him, Buck (easily the best character in FC3) rapes one of his friends, he brutally murders Vaas, he tortures his own brother, he zones out and slaughters a roomful of Hoyt's guards, and get to the point where he is ready to kill his friends for Citra. The moral roller coaster that is Jason is absolutely crazy, and this makes for a very engaging experience. The black and white, good and evil endgame choice does take you out of it a little, but it's overall a good story.  Far Cry 4, on the other hand, had almost none of the moral development that its prequel did. Ajay is more or less an empty shell with a loose backstory who suddenly becomes an almost messianic icon in the resistance for no other reason than mommy and daddy were resistance bigwigs back in the day. Beyond that, most of his actions seem to be motivated by nothing more than the fact that Amita or Sabal told him to do it.  And while I'm on the subject of Amita and Sabal: what poorly written characters. Sabal is at least believable; he's trying to help his country while also preserving its culture and gets corrupted by power as time passes. Amita, however, is not even marginally passable as a trustworthy figurehead. As soon as she is introduced to Ajay, she comes off as a massive bitch. Her reasoning seems sound at first, but after two or three conversations with her, it becomes painfully apparent that she is not to be believed. She flip flops between a borderline tearful, struggling to get the respect she's earned woman and a power hungry dictator-to-be, ready to rule with an iron fist with pretty much each conversation you have with her. It's hard to believe that anyone would trust her that long, let alone sympathize with her cause.  The moral choices in the game felt incredibly shallow, and what was supposed to be a hard choice between two equally shitty situations more often than not turned out to be choosing the mission of the character that was less of an asshole when asking you to do it. Even shooting Amita or Sabal was boring. Sabal dies sitting down after basically surrendering to you and Amita just sort of slumps over in her chair and silently passes (I'm aware that you don't have to kill them, but it just feels like the more reasonable choice). There's no drama, no gravitas to it. Despite the two of them being major characters, killing either of them felt like you were merely tying up a minor loose end. Pagan, however, is intriguing, and probably the most interesting character in the story, even if his screen time is rather short.  I liked the concept of the ""no right choices"" approach to the story of Far Cry 4, but it was executed far less spectacularly than it could have been.  Jesus fuck, that was quite the rant. Sorry."

farcry,38oxqu,MarquisHalimOndore,3,Sat Jun 6 04:00:22 2015 UTC,"On top of it all, Pagan is the one who is actually right. Sure, he's a dictator, but when the alternative is a drug running criminal or a religious extremist, he's the lesser of three evils.

farcry,38oxqu,FrightenedOfSpoons,16,Sun Jun 7 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"Far Cry 2 had the best story by far.  Far Cry 3 was too blockbuster and storycutter.  There were clear badguys and goodguys.  There was no real sense of urgency.  The villains are extremely stereotypical.  Vaas and the other guy I forgot his name are just so plain.  Vaas was well acted and executed, but was extremely shallowly written.  Far Cry 2 is the complete opposite.  There are no goodguys and no clear badguys.  The villain becomes your ally and your allies become your enemies.  Really the only people that are good are the people trying to hide and escape the country.  The Jackal was so well written as a character and turned out to be the most sane out of all of the other characters.  The Jackal is clearly the most interesting and most three dimensional character villain than all the other villains.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJBOZC7XdQ  No other FC game really captured the bleakness of a war torn land from the visuals, to the script.  FC3 was just a fun little blockbuster full of color and a mediocre story.  FC2 has a dark brutal story about morality and war."
farcry,38oxqu,ian356094,6,Fri Jun 5 19:35:56 2015 UTC,"Yea, FC2 was the ultimate Far Cry experience. I quite enjoyed the mechanics too, weapon jamming, malaria and diamonds. Sure, some things could have been polished more but it was definitely my favorite."

farcry,38oxqu,ThatCoolBritishGuy,5,Fri Jun 5 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"That's just silly. Blood Dragon had the best story. But 3 is definitely much better than 4.  Far Cry 4 is in some sort of uncanny valley - the characters are just realistic enough that it's hard to suspend disbelief but they're just too shallow to be interesting characters. Amita and Sabal are just comic book villains, and for what reason? They could either tone them down a bit to provide interesting moral choice system or go all Far Cry 3 everybody is insane way."
farcry,38oxqu,taw,2,Sat Jun 6 12:19:44 2015 UTC,"I played FC2 for about 10 minutes before it glitched out, and I haven't pursued it since, but I imagine I will in the future. I've played FC3 and FC4 on the PC.  Personally, I loved FC3 because it had an absolutely beautiful setting, I loved the islander nature of it and there was no better place for the game to have taken place. What made it one of my favourite games though was the story, and mostly because of the way it dealt with insanity as a theme, with the constant tripping out instead of action packed boss sequences, and the quotes from Alice in Wonderland at the start of every chapter, right down to the conversations Jason has with his friends, it makes you sympathise with him and agree with him until you just take a step back and have a moment of clarity and realise he's going insane too. You see Jason get caught up in such a fervour that it sweeps you along with it.   Vaas also made that game's story brilliant, mostly because he was such a good character. Everyone rips on Hoyt for not being as well written or thought out as Vaas as a character, but come on, it's always gonna be tough trying to write a better character than Vaas. I actually really enjoyed Hoyt, seeing him as the son and product of Apartheid South Africa transplanted into an area with total lawlessness where he profits from pretty much every sort of crime, and how he's so terrifying he can even manage to keep Vaas in line, was pretty interesting.   TL;DR yes Far Cry 3 had the better story"
farcry,38oxqu,GrimThursday,4,Sat Jun 6 02:44:59 2015 UTC,I think the the that made FC 3 better in terms of story was that it had a better build up in the beginning of the story.  FC4 didn't really have that.  Both choice you're given for who to finally work for ultimately suck.  It further suffered by not letting you play the game on Pagan Min's side.

If one side was obviously less shitty, then there wouldn't be an actual choice. You would just pick the choice that was obviously the better choice. They both had to be equally shitty so there was an actual choice.   not letting you play the game on Pagan Min's side.   Technically you can, it just shortens the game to 15 minutes. ;)"
farcry,38oxqu,Hawkfiend,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"They both had to be equally shitty so there was an actual choice.   No, Pagan makes it quite clear that there is a third choice-- kill the remaining person and take over, which was basically what he wanted for you all along.  Would have been great if the story continued after, maybe a few years down the road, after learning that they were a horrible choice to go with, and you needed to track them down or something."

farcry,38oxqu,allWoundUp357,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:09:12 2015 UTC,"I think FC3 didn't fuck around with giving you lose/lose choices like FC4.  It was a linear story, making you feel like the character had a mind of his own, which worked.  Some people want control over their characters, but I think it's okay for them to be a separate entity."
farcry,38oxqu,SputterNutter,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:57:52 2015 UTC,"I personally feel that the actual writing of both games sucked pretty equally. However, FC3's story at least 'felt' good. Feeling Jason's character slowly twisting into a madman was nice, and that gave the game a nice action-y feel, but that was pretty much the only good part of that game's story. FC4 on the other hand did much better with filling out the world with side quests and I felt it did much better at fleshing out the side characters, but it sacrificed the main character to do so."

He says whatever task you don't do, he'll do the other and kill himself. If you choose to blow up the mountain, he'll pay the border guards and just not shoot himself. Whereas if you pay the border guards, he'll blow up the mountain by igniting the dynamite with the flare gun he's holding before you depart. Also, I'm fairly certain 2 took place in Sierra Leone."

In FC4, it's implied he's just returning from Russia (he takes off the Ushanka he's wearing and says 'Won't be needing that anymore').  It obviously isn't mentioned or even implied how long he may have been in Russia but we can surmise that it was about two years, the length of time between FC3 and FC4.

farcry,370zhd,Eternal_Atom,2,Sat May 23 23:14:12 2015 UTC,"Alright OP, I'd love to clear some misconceptions, I don't care if people downvote me or not just hear me out.  Firstly yes, it does cost money to build a PC. But it also does depend on what you want to do with it. You can build a PC that could cost 450USD. You're probably thinking ""Why should I bother switch?""  Well, firstly games are ridiculously cheap on PC, you can get Humble Bundles and then in the steam Summer sale games go ridiculously cheap. Then you have higher frame-rates, better graphics, mods, the list goes on.   You're still probably thinking it costs an awful lot. Well look at it this way, here's a PC for about 450USD (For the sake of my ease I m gonna do this in euro, that's 410€). So a PS4 off gamestop (once again in Ireland) costs 400€, then PSN is 50€ per year.  Let's assume the current generation lasts 5 years... that's another 250 for just the console and the PSN to play games online. So the total about now is 650€, then let's assume you want a few games to come out soon and you want to buy them off the bat on release day, they're about (I'm gonna be kind here) 50€ each. Let's say you buy 3 new games per year, that's now costing you 800€(Of course you will want more than 3 games but I wasn't bothered doing more maths I think my point has been proven) to have a PS4 + PSN + 3 games in total. Only for you to repeat it all again in another 5 or so years.   While if you build a PC, you can upgrade parts as you need them if you want to upgrade at all over the time period that is. But remember you get to keep EVERY game you ever bought and play wii games, ps2 games on PC and everything before it, the catalogue is limitless. You can also build a better PC to last longer like this one that would have no trouble running 60FPS 1080P everything..   If you or anyone else has questions just ask away."
farcry,370zhd,siejhfzj,-2,Sun May 24 11:59:30 2015 UTC,"Have you even played this game? 280 can't even handle Far Cry 3, it will stay between 40 and 50fps with high end processor. Far Cry 4 is lot more demanding than 3. Anything below GTX 970 or 290 will give big stutters while driving and running."
farcry,370zhd,Eternal_Atom,1 point,Sun May 24 12:38:40 2015 UTC,"I find your statement hard to believe...... In fact I'd almost call bullshit on it.. Here are 2 different videos that show Far Cry 4 that you said is ""a lot more demanding than 3"" running at about 30-49 FPS on Ultra EDIT: Running on low medium->low still grants better frames... My point still stands. A cheap 450 USD PC manages to out preform an Playstation."
farcry,370zhd,tutitata,2,Sun May 24 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"1) In both videos, player is not driving. There's huge framerate drop when driving. You can see this drop in first video when he is flying with wingsuit. SSD doesn't help here and PS4 is not affected.  2) Your build suggests weak processor that doesn't stand against processors used in both videos: http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-4670-vs-AMD-FX-6300 , http://cpuboss.com/cpus/AMD-FX-8320-vs-AMD-FX-6300 .  3) PS4 settings are between very high and ultra. Your build will average at 20-30fps at these settings. Buying a computer to run same game in low-medium settings is foolish.  So how does this outperform PS4?"
farcry,370zhd,Daxelol,1 point,Sun May 24 18:48:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not attacking your argument itself but you use a few logical fallicies. You might want to read up on them.  Firstly, it's evident you didn't even look at the 2nd video as you would have noticed that he was  driving the car for the first 30 seconds or so.....You originally said ""will give big stutters while driving and running."" I saw no* ""big stutters""* while the person was running in either of the videos did you? maybe your definition is different than mine...  You'd also notice I gave 2 different builds, one as a cheaper build another more expesnive. Both of these builds were examples of what a PC could be like.   The i5 4440 is close enough to the 4670 used in the video.. In fact the i5 4440 that I used in the 2nd build beats the both the amd 6300 and 8320.  How does it beat the PS4? Taking the cheaper build, on very high it gets about 35FPS+ all the time, That beats the PS4 in the regard that the PS4 is capped at 30 no matter what. If the person used the 2nd build it simply blows the PS4 out of the water.  EDIT: The thing about PC is that a person can spend as much as they want on it. They're not restricted and locked in for years. So in that regard it will always win as a gaming platform hands down. Comparing PC a gaming platform to a PS4 can be very vague which can cause confusion since they're are high end and low end PCs."

farcry,370zhd,Nanabas,5,Sun May 24 01:51:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely not true, first off, for console equivalent graphics, you can turn the settings down a few notches anyway, and second, a solid budget build can be had for $500. I recently built my girlfriend one for just around that price, and it handles GTA V, as well as pretty much any game we throw at it. Not saying consoles are bad, because they are not, but there shouldn't be false information on either side."

farcry,370zhd,Nanabas,2,Sun May 24 18:54:34 2015 UTC,"In his situation, definitely. A console is a good solution for many people. A lot of people simply don't want to deal with the extra hassle, and slight price increase of a PC."
farcry,370zhd,siejhfzj,3,Sun May 24 19:55:44 2015 UTC,Exactly. Why bother buying something new for higher cost to play same thing?
farcry,370zhd,PinkFloydPanzer,2,Sun May 24 07:54:24 2015 UTC,"It is a good solution for certain people, not so for others. The advantages for a PC are that it is far more than a console, it is a full fledged gaming system as well as a powerful PC. It is also easily upgradable if you want more power. The downsides are that the initial cost is higher (monitor/accessories) and it is more complicated that going to buy a PS4. There are pros and cons for both, and IMHO, there is no black and white answer on which I better."
farcry,370zhd,eqldfaje,1 point,Sun May 24 20:00:28 2015 UTC,You will need at least gtx970 to get 60fps constant at high/veryhigh/ultra. My gtx960 can barely keep up even though I have i5 3330 quad core 3.2ghz. gtx970 alone costs almost close to price of full ps4. Also Far Cry 4 is not very well optimized.

farcry,36t7ht,KicksButtson,1 point,Fri May 22 18:38:25 2015 UTC,"I've always liked the map editor feature in FarCry games, although since FarCry 2 came out I've been very disappointed in the limits of their map editor. In FC2 they began limiting the amount of memory a map can utilize which really holds you back, even with relatively small maps.  Now with the newest edition of the map editor I'm amazed at how many glitches and bugs it has for an otherwise well polished game. There are textures missing, object angles are mathematically incorrect, and NPC character behavior triggers are faulty. And as though that weren't bad enough, they still have some pretty extreme software limitations!"
farcry,36t7ht,DarkNinjaPenguin,1 point,Sat May 23 14:25:03 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough I still think Far Cry 2's editor was the best one. The new features in FC3's editor (like placing water at different levels, and making holes in the map so caves are possible) were brilliant, but there were much, much fewer objects and the ones that were there weren't very adaptable and had stupid built-in occlusion blocks, so you couldn't place them at funny angles or risk your entire map being invisible to players. Far Cry 2's editor was excellent for being creative, the number of extraordinary maps was outstanding.  Now we can't even publish maps for multiplayer anymore, which was the redeeming feature of Far Cry 2's multiplayer. It's rather sad as this is really the only decent FPS game with a brilliant and easy-to-use map editor."

The Sandman is fun through most of the game, and is a great suppressed pistol, probably one of the best I've seen, but late-game it gets outshined by the Auto-Cross, D50, and the M79. The Double-Barrel is one of the best guns I've ever used. Wildlife sneaks up on you? Nope. One blast to the face, and anything is dead.
