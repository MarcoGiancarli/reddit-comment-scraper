If that is the case you should be able to plug the SDV into the cablebox if I am not mistaken.  Otherwise you could use an hdhomerun prime to do the same.    But to be honest no program is certified to record TV other then MC if it is marked with the no copy flag and you are basically stuck if you want to dvr channels with that.

What made me turn to Linux was hardware requirements. My Kodi clients run on 64 GB SSDs, and are dual core 1.6 GHz Atoms with an Nvidia GPU onboard. The whole system pulls 17 Watts at full load, is fanless and fits in a mini ITX case. Pretty much every tablet has more computing power these days.

The TV is obviously a place that MS have wanted to be ever since the OG XBox and even WebTV in the 90's. I just find it almost tragically funny that this giant so clearly knew where the market was going to, where they wanted to be a decade or so in advance, and had all the resources in the world to make it happen, and yet due to their own ineptitude never quite got there. Just like they did with smartphones, and just like they did with tablets.  They have the right ideas, they just never implement them very well.

I actually want the DTS-HD MA for my audio file to take advantage of my 5.1 surround system.

It'll be a quarter of the file size.   If you're running these through Handbrake, you're going to have some significant loss of quality. At that rate you might be better off looking into something like Plex or Emby. They can transcode on-the-fly and save you the hassle of having to run your entire Blu-ray library through handbrake.

htpc,3e1e2m,ZippyTheChicken,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:14:52 2015 UTC,I don't rip DVDs I record TV Shows though and reduce their file size. When you reduce the file size of any image or video which is just lots and lots of images / frames. you are going to lose quality.  What you have to do is decide how much quality you are willing to lose for the reduction in file size.  I always start with HD Video when the tv station is available in that and then I reduce the video down to 720p with a reduced bitrate of 1000 to 1200 bitrate.. this is a lot lower than most people can live with but for me its fine because it lets me take a 10GB file and drop it down to about 750MB to 1GB and if I am recording old tv reruns it really does not matter that much to me. If I was doing movies I care about I might have a higher bitrate.. but then again i really don't care because i normally just have the tv going while I am working or doing other things. I can't even remember when I have had time to sit down and do nothing but watch the TV... maybe 15 or 20 years? yeah so   anyway thats the deal .. reducing bitrate or width means reducing file size but it also means reducing quality.  On the other hand you can keep quality and just change the file type by ReMuxing not ReEncoding.. remuxing just changes the container type. Its like pouring your beer into a Pepsi can so you can get drunk while you drive HA... everything inside stays the same

htpc,3dxd5j,fudeu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:51:00 2015 UTC,I'll definitely consider doing this. Is it just a 3 or 4 pin connector on the PSU? or do you plug the fan into the motherboard or molex?

It is now my go-to PSU for cheap builds.  I'll never buy another Thermaltake PSU as long as I live.  I had a TR430 in my desktop, and it is so loud that my wife didn't want it in the livingroom.  I assumed it was a defect, so I exchanged it.  Same result with the next one too."
htpc,3dxd5j,LifeIsOnTheWire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:26:31 2015 UTC,"I used to do reviews for Thermaltake back in the day when they were nowhere near as big of a company. Free products and all. They used to be a little more original back in the day, now they copy a lot of the competition and the quality isn't usually there. I already knew what I was buying when I got the thermaltake - an ultra cheap PSU, I've got another older one sitting on the shelf which has got a few years of use on it and still going.  I'll take a look at the Antec, thanks."

htpc,3dxd5j,vigillan388,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:32 2015 UTC,"I was going to say go fanless, but you did say inexpensive...  The main issue for me is that even with a quality power supply, you can get a noisy fan. I bought a Seasonic 850W PSU and was really disappointed by the noise level. Everything else was really on par and their usual quality, but I had only bought fanless PSUs from them before.  Their 120mm fan was noisy as hell, and always ran at 1200 rpm. To top it off, they had a wimpy clear plastic piece to supposedly funnel the air somewhere important that was sitting right below the fan arms and wobbling like mad, producing a low-frequency whirring noise all by itself.  So I invested 15 Euros and bought a Noctua PWM-controllable fan. Opened my PSU and replaced the stock 120mm fan. Made a small hole in the PSU case, led the fan connector out and connected the fan to the mainboard. Completely shut the thing up. I let it idle at 500 rpm and spin it up when system loads go high.  So if the warranty on your PSU has expired, and you have nothing to lose by removing the dangerous ""Warranty void if removed"" sticker from that one screw, go ahead and do that. Definitely cheaper than a new PSU.  Here's a link to the fan I used"

htpc,3dukg4,caolanowens,3,Sun Jul 19 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"I don't have one, but a friend of mine has one, and I helped him figured it out.  When the Fire TV first came out it did not support hosting media on USB, but I've read that now it does.  The only thing I have against the Amazon Fire TV is how inconvenient it is to side-load apps.  And once you sideload an app, you cant add it to the home screen.  You have to use a 3rd party launcher.  And based on the 5-10 minutes I spent playing with it, installing a 3rd party launcher wasn't that easy.    Maybe take 10-20 mins watching Youtube videos on the subject, to find out if you are okay with the options you have for interface, and launching the apps.  Things may have changed since I touched one, but I found it really inconvenient.    Personally, I prefer a more 'vanilla' android experience.  I would look for an RK3288 powered Android box.  Or one powered by an Amlogic S805 / M805 / S806 / M806 / S812.  Those are chips that are best supported by Kodi for H264 and H265 decoding."

htpc,3dukg4,LifeIsOnTheWire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"Getting a standard Android box gives you alot more control over your interface.  You have your pick of 3rd party launchers, and other tweaks.    Also, side loading apps is as easy as downloading the APK, and launching it in your file explorer.  I'm sure you can accomplish most of the same things on the Fire TV, but personally, I don't like buying something that is deliberately designed to fight against everything I do.  And who knows, an Amazon software update some day might ruin all the hacks and tweaks you did."
htpc,3dukg4,LifeIsOnTheWire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:54:44 2015 UTC,That is true.  One thing however that I do like is the return policy and the fact that it is Amazon.

I think there were issues with copyright (HDCP) protection and allowing HD.  Not sure if that's been resolved or not.  Pretty much any cpu can decode 1080p h.264.  If a lot of stuff starts ending up at higher bitrate HEVC (h.265) they may struggle a bit at the higher bitrate ones. (10-15Mbps+)

But SD's tuners are better at network sharing, so there's that. Personally I prefer to have my DVR functionality centralized, so that all recordings are in one place. In that kind of setup, there's no need to share tuners to other devices (live tv gets streamed from the central DVR server rather than by sharing out tuners)."
htpc,3dplga,RandomRageNet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:17:50 2015 UTC,"Ceton definitely has the superior hardware, but WMC is now on deathwatch and Ceton is dependent on it. SD at least has a DVR solution in place (and if they come out with great 10' SAF friendly software for playing protected content, they'll own the market)  Ceton has gone quiet after the announcement to kill WMC in Win 10. Hopefully they're engineering a DVR replacement of their own but they're a family company and don't necessarily pivot all that well."
htpc,3dplga,boxsterguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:47:23 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I believe Ceton has b2b type income and services (hotel video distribution iirc), so loss of wmc may not kill the company."
htpc,3dplga,RandomRageNet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the company will be fine, I'd just advise against any of their consumer products until they make an announcement about how they plan to handle DVR software moving forward.  They did hire a pretty awesome programmer (the MyMovies software was the result of that), but they also spent a lot of time and resources on the Q which Microsoft essentially killed for them (Thanks, Ballmer)."
htpc,3dplga,boxsterguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:21:01 2015 UTC,"What currently works shouldn't stop working, and I guarantee you there are many of us who will stick with 7 or 8.1 indefinitely until WMC comes back or a true viable option appears (SD's kickstarter is interesting, but too much vaporware-ish for my tastes right now; plus, I don't trust any company that uses Kickstarter ...).  So it's still a safe bet to buy InfiniTV products for 7/8.1, at least IMHO.  Also, Ceton's cards work in more than just WMC.  They're supported in backends like NextPVR and MythTV, for example (obviously minus the copy protected channels), and I don't see any technical reason why they wouldn't be supported by SD's software.  CableCard interfaces are pretty standardized, so unless SD's relying on their DLNA streams the Ceton cards should just be plug and play.  And if they are relying on DLNA (which would be a bad idea, IMHO, because IIRC the HDHRs are transcoding MPEG2 -> H264 on the DLNA interface which would be an unfortunate loss in quality for mainline DVR scenarios), that's also a standard interface that Ceton could easily bang out support for.  I'm not really sure how much Ceton was invested in Q (that was Windows Home Server; there was a very brief period of time where Microsoft toyed with incorporating WMC into the v2/2011 version, but that was scrapped very early in the process and not something that Ceton would've ever dealt with).  And I believe the dev you're thinking of was Mikinho, maker of Yammm, not Binnerup Consult, the guys behind My Movies.  Yammm is the backend for the My Media Center app from Ceton."

HDCP checks what kind of equipment you're using and if it isn't a traditional piece of equipment (such as a TV or XBOX), it will not display certain channels (such as Showtime, HBO, etc... just to name a few).

My only thought before going into things is you should get a separate stand for your computer (obviously your choice).  Now! What I would build IF I were you is getting a micro-ATX or mini-ITX.  (I would go with Min-ITX if you wanna go as small as possible.)  I would say build something similar to:  MotherBoard  Processor  (You could gear down to an I3, but I think this one is fairly well priced & it'll leave you some over head.)  Memory (pretty good latency & good speed. If you felt the need to you should go for 16GB. But, in more real world applications 8GB is all you need)  Graphics Card  (Since you are focusing on the game 'Civilization V' this card will be able to handle what you throw at it & more.)"

It sits somewhere else in the house since it's massive and holds 9 hard drives. I can control that server via remote desktop or web app so it's pretty much out of the way of everything and hardly ever need to be looked at physically.   For my main system, it's just chromecast/fire tv stick straight to the receiver onto the projector. The main system just needs to play stuff from Plex through either the chromecast or fire tv. I don't need to know what my sonarr is doing there. This makes the main system a lot cleaner. I don't have to stare at the massive PC with a bunch of fan spinning making noises and blue LED shining everywhere.

htpc,3dlliz,ecb29,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"It's best to not transcode as it's a very CPU intensive process and degrades visual quality. High CPU load means it will draw more power and generate heat. A small case is generally less able to remove heat than a standard size case so it will run fans at higher RPM and generate more noise.  Get client hardware that can hardware decode the major codecs rather than use H.264-only boxes. Even a Raspberry Pi 2 can handle VC-1 and MPEG-2 natively (with the purchase of $5 of licenses).  If you must use transcoding, obviously use a fast CPU such as the Intel i5-4000 series or AMD FX-8000 series. (Don't get a NUC as they have lower wattage and slower laptop class CPUs)."

htpc,3dlliz,GeneticsGuy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:20:06 2015 UTC,"For sure, streaming media outside your home is an obvious scenario when transcoding is helpful.   Streaming inside the house is what I was referring to.  I don't have any 40gb rips.  My files are all under 5gb, and I usually Handbrake them to 1-2gb.  When I'm away from home, I VPN into my home network and stream the videos natively.    There has only been one occasion that I've wanted to downscale a video, and watch it remotely.  I was staying in a hotel with a 2-3mbps connection.  So I did a remote desktop to my home server, and used Handbrake to downscale the video to a 1.5mbps bitrate (AMD FX-8320 is great for transcoding, if nothing else), and then watched it."

This gets you a CPU with a passmark score of 3000 (remember you need 2000 to do a single Plex stream, so this is most of your CPU power).  If you built a Mini ITX PC, you could have far more CPU power than that.  Below is a build for the same $360 price, but this gets you a CPU with a Passmark score of 5500 (enough to run 2x plex streams simultaneously, and still enough CPU power leftover to do something else alongside that).

Good to hear you disagree. Now I can put more into storage. Should I get a SDD or an additional NIC?  Since this board only has 5 SATA ports I am thinking I should start with 5 2TB drives in RAIDZ. This should give me 8TB of usable storage with redundancy. Or should I spilt the disks into two datasets, one for production and one for backup?   Also since this board can only handle 5 drives, should I go for a different case and PSU?  One more questions about storage, I just read that once a dataset is created you cannot add additional disks to it.

If you're downloading it all, you can just go download it again if the server blows up. If you're painstakingly ripping your own BluRays, you'll need some backup. IMO, boot from the SSD and store on a single RAID5 array.    Also since this board can only handle 5 drives, should I go for a different case and PSU?   Depends where this machine will be.

Dell offers the media for about $10 .. then you can pull the drive out without mirroring it to the new drive and use the license key on the case to install to a fresh drive...

I bought a similar machine about a year ago (it's an ex-corporate PC) but I didn't do the homework and it has an irritating drawback.  The power supply is only 240W. Obviously for an office PC they're not going to need high power equipment. Unfortunately this isn't enough power to supply a graphics card. I'm stuck with the fairly basic on-board graphics which works well enough. The problem is that I want to connect two screens - an HD monitor and a TV - using it as an HTPC (sometimes both at once). The onboard graphics output doesn't include an HDMI connector, just the standard VGA and a Displayport. I've managed to use a Displayport to HDMI cable for the monitor, but I can't use it as an HTPC, and I can't add a graphics card because there isn't one that will work with such low power. I've pretty much maxed out the power by adding a simple USB3 card.  I can't even change the PSU because it's a non-standard design and the motherboard isn't compatible with a standard PSU.   (My specifications: it's an HP Compaq 8000 Elite Small Form Factor Business PC - Intel Core 2 Duo CPU running at 3GHz. I have 8GB of RAM and it runs Windows 7 well - it would be an almost perfect HTPC with a graphics card - the machine itself is pretty near silent.

htpc,3day7c,PriceZombie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:06 2015 UTC,"So a week or so ago I posted in the /r/buildapc sub asking about my potential build.  I didn't get much of a response other than avoiding the 3TB Seagates I'd selected (Seriously AVOID 3TB Seagates).  In the end I bought almost a completely different batch of hardware in an effort of cutting the cost as much as possible, while still retaining the functions I genuinely wanted.  All told I spent ~$675 though if I were willing to use other vendors or wait for sales I'm sure I could have gotten it below 600.  In the end I went with an AMD FX-6300 on an Asus M5A78L-M/USB3 motherboard.  I stacked on 8GB of Kingston 1333 RAM, a 64GB SSD OS drive and a pair of 4TB WD Green HDD's running in Raid 1 (for the moment, when I need space I'll convert it to a RAID5).  Probably a little bit of overkill for the power demands but I chose a simple Corsair CX600 watt PSU.  Some people claim that they are bad PSU's but it's like everything else in the world, some are just duds.  If you're interested you can see the PCPP build list here; however the price shown does not include the Asus ROG 5870 (price is shown as $0.00) because I already owned that (salvaged from my current gaming rig when I upgraded).  I did try and use the M5A78L's on board ATi 3000 but even playing low-res video's it would stutter.  Additional side note - if you're wanting the same Rackmount case do NOT get it through the vendor AmaMax on Amazon.  NewEgg sells it direct for about $30 less but I was impatient and paid the extra to (try) and get it faster than NewEgg could (hence the reason the whole build is on Amazon; Free Two-day).  In the end they sent it ground instead of expedited like I paid for and I got it almost a week after everything else; had to complain to get a partial refund.  Lastly, in the second picture you can see a tiny-ass keyboard charging on the front door.  That's the iPazz Mini Wireless keyboard and it's well worth the 15 bucks I paid.  I had planned to just use a generic remote with a USB IR receiver but that wouldn't work with my end goal.  Yeah, I bought a rackmount server case for an HTPC; stupid right?  Stupid like a FOX.  You see, a while back this was posted to /r/battlestations.  A house wired with a central rack; and terminals wherever was wanted.  To me that is my ultimate goal.  Plus finding a decent HTPC case that could hold as many hard drives as I expect to is a nightmare.  The few that I could find that didn't look like garbage, AND had the room I wanted were substantially more than I wanted to pay.  As for software; I'm presently running Gentoo Linux, with the standard mix of samba et all for file sharing; and a fresh compile of Kodi 15 - Isengard.  At the moment, Kodi is displaying on my 70"" TV though at some point in the future I do intend to upgrade to a projector based system and make it a TRUE home theater.  (Before anybody points it out; I'm absolutely atrocious at cable management and yes, the case already has dog fur in it.  We vacuum every day but with a GSD and a Husky there's no getting rid of it.  All the more reason to get an enclosed rack and put it in the basement)"

The BackBlaze report is only really useful within the context of backblaze.  For example, they intentionally buy the cheapest drives they can get, which often means buying external USB drives and ripping off the external case (theoretically these are the same disks as you'd buy retail, but in practice that's not necessarily the case).  They're also likely running in a hotter, noisier, vibration-ier environment than you'll see for typical home use.  Besides, the entire point of RAID is that drives aren't necessarily all that reliable.  So you build with redundancy, and you plan to replace drives as needed.  With RMAs, this shouldn't cost you any more than the cost of a single hot swap (drive fails, you swap it out, then RMA it -- once that arrives, you now have a new hot swap ""for free""; repeat until warranty expires and you can no longer RMA, and then start over).   a pair of 4TB WD Green HDD's running in Raid 1 (for the moment, when I need space I'll convert it to a RAID5)   How'd you set up the RAID?  I'm not aware of any RAID software that lets you convert from mirrored to parity without data loss, so your plan for expansion really ought to be to update in pairs (striped mirrors or mirrored stripes).  But if you do eventually decide to go parity, you really want to go with RAID6 when dealing with drives > 2TB.  Reason being, larger drives means longer RAID rebuild times.  Longer rebuild times means more stress on the drives.  More stress on the drives means one is more likely to fail during the rebuild.  And if you're rebuilding because you lost a drive already and are thus running without redundancy, losing that second drive will lose all of your data.  Play it safe and either stick with mirrors or go with 2+ parity.  HDDs are ultimately not all that expensive.  Also, if you didn't already you probably will want to get a copy of wdidle3 and increase the aggressive sleep timeout on the Green drives (aggressive sleeping can cause the RAID controller to think the drive has dropped out).  One of the biggest causes of HDD death is spin-up count, and an aggressively idling Green drive in a RAID will spin up and down way more often than a mostly idle single media drive would."

Another post   Over the past few years, cable companies have turned to encrypting all but the local broadcast channels (ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS). All other channels that you pay for may be encrypted (Clean QAM Tuners cannot pick up encrypted channels) at the cable company's discretion and thus, require a set top box from the cable company.

htpc,3d2unf,boxsterguy,2,Mon Jul 13 16:55:22 2015 UTC,"Make that generic -- it applies to all S/PDIF.  TOSLINK is just a physical interconnect.  For example, there's also coax (normally an orange-colored RCA jack).  S/PDIF only carries two PCM channels.  Lossless audio needs 6 or 8 (5.1 or 7.1), which HDMI provides."

I am going from a fireTV and HTPC via optical only to an older Onkyo receiver with optical inputs.  I use HDMI solely for the video channel.  I have gotten used to stereo + sub instead of true 5.1.  Is this my clue that I need to step up to an HDMI-switching receiver?"
htpc,3d2unf,boxsterguy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"You should upgrade.  It's not that expensive to get a decent AVR with HDMI inputs.  However, that's not necessarily your actual problem.  S/PDIF can carry compressed multi-channel audio like Dolby Digital and DTS, and most people won't really notice the difference between that and HD audio.  If you're only getting stereo out of your firetv and HTPC, it's probably a configuration issue or it could be a platform limitation (FireTV + Plex I believe is still limited to stereo output, though FireTV should be able to play 5.1 from Amazon video and maybe Netflix).  The one caveat is with an HTPC and gaming (video playback can be configured for passthrough).  Unless you're using something like Dolby Live or DTS Connect, you'll be limited to raw PCM out, and with S/PDIF that means 2-channel stereo vs. 8-channel surround with HDMI."
htpc,3d2unf,boxsterguy,4,Tue Jul 14 21:43:18 2015 UTC,"When you say ""via regular audio ports"", I assume you mean mini jacks?  That's analog 6-channel audio.  The only way to get that into a receiver is to have a receiver that supports analog audio input.  And that also means that DD5.1 and DTS decoding has to be done on your PC rather than passed through to your receiver (which, being dedicated to the task, can generally decode things better/faster than your PC can).  Since you're running through a VGA to HDMI converter, I assume that your PC doesn't have HDMI output at all.  Thus your best bet would be to upgrade your GPU to something that supports HDMI including audio.  Like an older Radeon 5xxx or 6xxx series, or an nVidia 430/440.  Those are cheap, can be found in low profile form factors, and can even be found with fanless designs.  If your PC is newer than ~7 or 8 years old (and possibly older), it should be able to run one of those GPUs just fine.  Shouldn't cost you more than ~$50 or so."

htpc,3d2unf,trustmeep,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"Well, whatever you're using now is causing you more pain than using either of those.  The GTS250 would probably have been okay if you hooked up the internal s/pdif connection (unlike newer GPUs, it didn't have audio built directly in but could pass through audio from your motherboard/soundcard).  Why not buy something like this?  $40, will do full HDMI audio including uncompressed HD audio (Dolby TrueHD, DTS-MA) if your receiver supports it, has more than enough grunt for game streaming, and should be compatible with your existing system if you once had a 250 in there.  $40 to make all of your HTPC-related headaches go away seems like a deal to me."

The video card is the easiest route, though the secondary option is possibly just as cheap, but requires a bit more work.  As a third option, you could buy a standalone sound card that supports 5.1 audio, but there's more complexity there than you might seem obvious, and it's not always cheap.  If your goal is to have a standalone PC for HTPC use, you could also buy a Dell or similar major manufactured PC from their outlet/refurb stores.

Biggest draw from using MPC-HC are the filters, otherwise I'll stick with the standard player since it's more than good enough for the task.  I don't want to emulate anything beyond the N64. The onboard GPU should be fine unless I was running hires packs for N64 games (which I don't like, I'm a purist). bsnes Accurate requires a lot of power, but Balanced is still very accurate and not as demanding."

I've heard of issues with DXVA2 hardware-assisted decoding and monitor issues in this kind of virtualized environment.   The easiest way to make this work the way you want it to is to use Plex Media Server on the backend and Plex Home Theater on your BayTrail HTPC. That way the media server is in charge of maintaining the media database and artwork. It'll lighten the load on the BayTrail box for scrolling/seeking since the server will be handling the most difficult aspects of that. I'd try that first."

Honestly though, I'm on the verge of tossing it because PCI passthrough for the video card has just been too much of a pain.  If you're REALLY comfortable with graphics card setup in Linux, then maybe it won't be so bad, but I have a 50/50 shot of my HTPC rebooting properly, and I've had no luck finding any solutions to fix it.  Keep in mind that you cannot pass a keyboard/mouse through ESXi unless you pass an entire USB controller through as well.  Once it's running though, it's streaming 1080p lightly compressed movies (20 GB typical size) over a network without a single jump.  I'm happy to go into details or answer questions you might have on my exact setup, just let me know what you want to know.

Its great, but you will need to think of a creative way to make it wife-accessible.  Make a desktop shortcut or something.  But you will still need to think of a way to make it fullscreen.  You can launch ""chrome.exe --kiosk"", and it will load chrome in a fullscreen mode, but that will cause Chrome to always launch in kiosk mode, so its not that convenient.

Remote control support might be iffy, and I hear keyboard support is, too, so you're stuck with that.  Browser-based solutions (like Chrome and NetfliXBMC) are limited to stereo audio and sometimes 720p streaming.   As far as unifying the launcher, I think you have two choices:  Use the Win8 Start Screen and customize it with pretty, big tiles for the apps you want to access. I don't do this, but it's popular and it's easy to implement.  Use Autohotkey to map buttons on your remote. You can have a remote control button kill XBMC's process and start the Netflix app, for example and, I assume, go the other direction. But that's going to be more like programming.   Somebody needs to build an HTPC launcher interface that does nothing but help with this very problem. A lot of people would install Plex Media Server (or Emby, don't forget Emby) and stream their local content to a Roku or other set-top device that also has good Netflix support.

htpc,3cmm8r,majesticjg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:13 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're using HDMI audio output, when the HDMI device is powered down the NUC sees that it's ""gone"" and therefore removes it as a valid audio device. It will re-add it when the HDMI handshake happens and it gets new EDID data.  Basically, you need a full-system reboot, including your TV and AVR, if you have one. That should force them to exchange EDID information again and identify that, yes, there is an audio device out here.  I don't know Mint, but that's a somewhat common problem in Windows."
htpc,3cmm8r,boxsterguy,2,Thu Jul 9 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"I have an older HDMI Detective Plus that solves this problem elegantly.  Apparently there's a new model out now that's unfortunately ~$30 more expensive, but IMHO still worth it as I haven't found anything else that both maintains EDID while the receiver's off and supports HDCP.  Another option is to try a different receiver, as some are better about maintaining EDID info even while ""off"" (in power saving mode) than others are.  And a third option that's not really available here is to try a different GPU, as some are better at handling loss of EDID than others (older nVidia GPUs like the 220GT and 440GT had issues all the time for me, while an AMD A10 APU did not; I haven't personally tried an Intel IGD in my home theater).  I'm not sure if it's something that's solvable with drivers or if it's a limitation of the GPU hardware itself, but lacking updates from the GPU manufacturer the only thing you can do yourself is clone the EDID with a tool like the HDMI Detective."
htpc,3cmm8r,majesticjg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"The hardware solution (HDMI Detective or Dr. HDMI) is the silver bullet, here, but it adds hassle and expense where none should be necessary."

So for now, at least until GPU companies wise up to the fact that people want HTPCs, I just consider the HDMI Detective as part of the cost of running an HTPC."

The Core M 5y10c is a little tough to measure up next to other CPUs.    It has a base clock speed of 800mhz, and boosts as high as 2ghz, based on temperature.  So its performance can vary, based on how well engineered the device is (how well it dissipates heat).  Its Passmark score varies from 2000 to 3000 depending on what device it is."

NAS devices are really cool and you could easily use something like unraidOS or freenas to get the most out of those drives while protecting your data. But you also have to consider how much your are willing to spend for all the other components required to build a Nas. Do you have a budget for the rest of the computer? Or better yet, do you have any spare parts sitting around? A Nas doesn't need much horsepower unless your thinking you'll need to transcode a lot of your media. Also, power consumption might be an issue for you too if your electricity bill annoys you so if you are either buying the needed parts or using leftovers you already have, you will want to make sure they are relatively efficient.  Otherwise you could also buy a premade like a qnap but those are generally considered under powered and over priced. They also can't transcode hd media worth crap unfortunately."

Those things are less distracting than the antennas and can be removed if you ever want to go without wifi.  I've read that the V300s have had performance issues. Actually, I'm not sure if that's still the case or old news, but I'd do more research before settling on an SSD. I know you won't be storing media on it, but I'd still get a bigger drive. You get more gigs per dollar and it's better to have extra space just in case.  Lastly, keep in mind your graphics card has to be single slot and low profile to fit that case. I have yet to see such a 750ti so you may have to go with a different GPU or case."

htpc,3caamw,Fruddy91,8,Mon Jul 6 09:41:19 2015 UTC,I think you are confusing your internet speeds with your local home network speeds. Upgrading your internet to 20 will not make a difference to local network performance if your local network remains the same. It would increase internet streaming speeds though.   However you are right in that if you connect an external hard drive directly to the htpc you will eliminate any loading or buffering of local content.   You may find that the cause of your current problem is that your ps4 may be connected via wifi and the connection may be of poor quality connection.

Some Intel integrated GPUs got an update in January giving them hardware acceleration of HEVC content. 1080p HEVC content has very low CPU usage, but 4K HEVC content stutters. Otherwise the only other x86 CPUs with hardware acceleration of HEVC are AMD ""Carrizo"" and Intel ""Brazwell.""  As for H.264, every single currently sold desktop CPU handles it in hardware.

So in a best case scenario the NAS -- and generally the any other server pieces, like plex media server are in one room; the device(s) which play the media are in another.  Which is why roku units, fire tv, raspberry pi are so popular as htpc front ends -- or even small low power pcs, like chromeboxes or intel nucs -- they are quiet, small, unobtrusive, and can blend into the living room.     That being said, I don't have any experience with DVR capabilities but especially if you're looking for something to be on 24/7 it seems like it would be counter-productive to have it be the same device which is hooked up to your tv.

htpc,3bwlwr,theonyxphoenix,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:06:25 2015 UTC,"I have my main PC setup with steam streaming, emulators, PC games, and Kodi.  I have my phone set up with Kodi, Limelight, and a few emulators.  I also have a tablet hooked up to my living room smart TV via HDMI running Kodi and Limelight.  I added non-steam games and emulators SNES-PS2, etc. through steam to my main PC and can stream over wifi to either my tablet or phone.   PC games work fine and I can access big picture mode through Kodi/Limelight  I found that there are certain emulators that won't allow the controller to work and I had to switch to Mupen64 and bsnes for example.   I also set up a Google Drive account to synch up my emulators on my phone to save to the cloud so I can play on my phone on the go.  I ripped all of my DVDs to a hard drive on the main computer and access them via Kodi on other computers and phones in the house.  My cellphone acts as a remote for Kodi on the living room TV or I simply watch on my phone.  I can stream all of my library to anywhere in the house.  As for Netflix/hulu...I have access to them on my smart TV and phone, so I cannot really speak to the integration of those.   I hope this helps, or at least gives you some ideas."

When I try to set it up it lots the organization I set up (for each system) and didn't show any meta data or photos that I attached on my main machine.  I have a one drive account (windows phone) and do the same with emulators on my phone).
htpc,3bwlwr,Creel27,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:06:38 2015 UTC,"I used ICE for steam to set up the pics which pull from ConsoleGrid.com to populate the images.  For the ones missing, I saved them one by one to a shared network pictures folder so they are accessible by all computers on my home network. This is only necessary if you have Steam on the main PC and then streaming to Steam on the secondary computer.   When I use my phone or my tablet using limelight, that is just streaming the full big picture mode from my gaming PC to the receiving end.    As far as metadata.  I haven't seen how to include other info on added non-steam games other than the grid image."

I'm sure there are tutorials over at /r/buildapc and sites like PCpartpicker.com do a pretty good job of stopping you from buying something that cannot possibly work together. Best of all, it's really hard to screw it up so bad you damage something.   You can handle this.  I would not suggest a Mini ITX build for someone who's new. They're teeny tiny and sexy, but they can be tricky to work with to get all the parts in where they go without a hearty dose of blasphemy.   Go with something like a Silverstone ML04 and don't put an optical drive in it. That was a very easy build and if you're not sure and have to check your work, it's laid out in there accessibly."

If you're tech-minded and don't mind troubleshooting when things go wrong, you'll probably be OK. Putting the parts together is just a matter of putting the right pieces in the right places. The instructions are usually adequate and YouTube can help you with the rest.   The real issues can arise when it doesn't turn on or when something else goes wrong. Did you put the CPU in properly? Does the motherboard need an update to recognize the CPU? Is the RAM seated properly? Maybe one of the sticks of RAM is bad. Why is the CPU constantly at 70C without load?  etc.  If you're expecting it to work as soon as you put it together, don't do it.

htpc,3bp1o2,straighttokill9,3,Wed Jul 1 02:46:52 2015 UTC,"So ... you have a loose speaker?  That's it?  I have a rock, how do I make soup?  If you're serious, well ...  First, you need more speakers than just a driver (which I will assume is a woofer).  Depending on the sound you want, you'll need multiple drivers of multiple sizes, from woofers to tweeters.  Times two for the front R/L speakers, plus more for center, side R/L, and rear R/L..  Then you need to build all of the enclosures to put them in (wood + glue + mesh + staples), with the appropriate math for the resonance chambers so things don't sound like shit.  And you need to wire up the electrical connections to the speakers.  Don't forget a 12"" subwoofer, enclosure, crossover wiring, etc  So now you have a bunch of shitty homemade speakers.  Next, you need something to drive them.  A PC isn't going to cut it, because it doesn't output enough power.  So you need to build an amp.  Good luck with that, hope you don't fry yourself shorting caps.  If you're only doing analog audio, you're now done.  Run analog 7.1 output to your amp, to your speakers.  But if you want to support Dolby Digital, DTS, lossless codecs, etc, you need something that can take in digital signals (time to learn about S/PDIF and PCM and convert them to analog for the amp, or a DAC (digital to analog converter).  Lots more electronic knowledge, wiring, soldering, programming, licensing fees, etc later and you now have something that you could've bought for $200 (an audio receiver).  And the $200 receiver will undoubtedly work better than whatever you can cobble together.  tl;dr: What you're asking is ridiculous."

The real downside is that if you need a keyboard and/or mouse for anything, it makes it a pain in the ass. This is even true for games like Fallout 3 and New Vegas, that have one splash screen that requires you to click play with your mouse before going into the game itself.  Overall, for gaming, I'd give it a B, but for an XBMC box, it gets an  A because it has everything loaded, and you can just plug it into the network, browse to your NAS, and you've got things ready to roll."

htpc,3bgk04,UnmannedVehicle,7,Mon Jun 29 01:05:50 2015 UTC,"I have a similar setup to the one you're thinking about.   I use a NAS for my media simply because it's easier to maintain as a self-contained unit. I have a QNAP TS-469L with 4x3TB WD Red drives (RAID 5). This unit serves as media storage, backup storage (my 2 PCs and my wife's Macbook Pro), and iSCSI storage for my ESXi server.  The entire unit runs about 32w on average and it's on 24/7.  For my HTPC, I use an Intel NUC i3. The Celeron NUC would have worked as well, but I wanted a better CPU in the device in case I wanted to move it to another use later on.   I love my setup. It's rock solid and I don't have to worry about software on the NAS. I've also got the added benefit of the RAID setup which will help protect against a single drive failing. The catch is that it isn't cheap. The QNAP NAS + drives will set you back at least $750. Plus you should have it connected to a UPS in case of a power failure, so that's another $50-$150.   You can get a Synology for cheaper, but I've had some horrendous luck with them (two DoA units).  I've worked with almost 10 QNAP boxes that are all still going strong. A 2-bay QNAP NAS might be good for your needs. Just set it for mirroring and you can get a couple 4TB WD Red drives for use with it.  The Intel NUC was much more cost effective. I got it on sale for $300 (CAD) and I already had a spare 2.5"" hard drive for it. The celeron one will run you $150 US if the pricing is similar to what it was earlier this year. Power consumption on my NUC is around 11w when playing a 1080p video.   Hope this helps!   Edit: If you're looking to seed, see what apps are available for the QNAP box you're interested in. If I recall correctly, you can just seed directly from the NAS."
htpc,3bgk04,fishy007,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:29:03 2015 UTC,"Is a NUC effective for HTPC use? I'm Canadian and would rather not build a pc from various vendor parts, NUC seems easy but concerned as to whether its worth it or not. Would be used for some home office work, torrenting, streaming tv/shows to ps4 or chromecast (should be 1 device at a time).  I assume this sort of use requires it on 24/7 or can it be awoken by my ps4/chromecast remotely from sleep mode to start streaming?  If you could help it'd be appreciated, cheers"
htpc,3bgk04,i0dog,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:14:28 2015 UTC,"The NUC is quite effective for the type of use you're looking for.  I believe that if you want it to be a streaming machine, it needs to be on 24/7....or you'd need to turn it on manually. It's possible to set something to wake it up remotely, but it's beyond my expertise.   I'd get the i5 NUC if you plan on using it to stream movies TO another device though.  The i3 might be ok, but I can't be sure. When you're playing movies on the device itself, the GPU part of the setup is doing the decoding. So a Celeron or i3 is more than adequate. When you're streaming movies to another device across the network, the CPU is doing the heavy lifting, so it needs to be robust enough that it can keep up the stream.   I haven't tried to stream shows to my PS4 yet, but I've heard that it's getting MKV support. If that's the case, you might be able to point the PS4 at the storage on the HTPC and have the PS4 do the decoding. That way the HTPC doesn't need to work as hard.   I'm in Canada as well and bought my NUC through NCIX. However, this was last year when there were sales and the dollar was a bit better than it is now."

I use a amd a10 which Isn't the most efficient apu on the market but it's still pretty efficient and It has played everything I've thrown at it.

htpc,3bdt5g,Night-Man,3,Sun Jun 28 07:20:04 2015 UTC,Why do you want to use mouse functions?  You should use Kodi and/or Windows Media Center and have it setup to use s remote only.  You could then have an emergency mouse and keyboard tucked away somewhere or do like I do and use Remote Mouse to turn your cell phone into a trackpad and keyboard.

htpc,3bdxzn,goeatsomesoup,2,Sun Jun 28 08:43:23 2015 UTC,"So, there isn't a lot of detail here.  With the blu rays, what are you picking for audio, the high def surround, the stereo track, etc?  I assume that power dvd lets you pick that?  (I use makemkv for ripping my bluray) And how are you playing the audio -- through your TV's speakers, an a/r receiver? 5.1, 7.1?  As far as the pirated versions sounding better, I guess I don't hear a lot of a echo through my crappy laptop speakers, although there is a change in dynamics which again makes me wonder which audio track you are taking from the disc. Aren't most pirated versions sourced from blu-ray? I just don't know how they are getting different mixes.  I have a feeling you're just used to stereo presentation and somewhere in your audio chain it's trying to present surround (perhaps poorly downmixing to 2.0) from the blu ray discs.    Also I'll bite, what is RWBY? [Edit: googled, apparently that is the actual name of the series, I kept trying to parse those initials into a show I had heard of... lol]"
htpc,3bdxzn,achilles_cat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:32:22 2015 UTC,"I play the audio through a 5.1 system. I went into audio settings and it was in 2 speaker mode. I switched it to 6 speaker and turned on Dolby true theater mode. The echo disappeared and the sound was clean and warm just like the pirated versions. That totally helped man, so I guess the blu ray player and discs weren't a wasted purchase after all, thanks man :D  Also, RWBY is the first American take on anime i think. It's really good, the fights are well choreographed and the cinematography is excellent along with the characters and story. There's no fan service so none of the ""moe pantsu"" crap you get in many Japanese anime. Most of the time, CG isn't used well in anime and clashes in the style and the frame rates don't match but RWBY being entirely CG actually uses it very well. The NA voice acting is very good, there are some pretty famous voices in there including jen taylor, VA for Cortana, Zoey and a few others i can't recall atm. If NA VA isn't your deal with anime style, the show is becoming quite popular in japan and there's a fan dub, but there's an official dub coming soon by some pretty big shots too. Anyways /fanboy rant  Thanks for helping me fix that damn echo, it was driving me nuts lol.  edit: Do you know any free/low cost alternative to powerdvd? I dont know if I want to pay 90-100USD for a media player when I'm using MPC-HC with SVP and VLC that works really well and is free, but doesn't play blu ray.  Edit: If you're ever intersted, RWBY is available free to watch on the official RT website and you tube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sGiE10zNQM&list=PLpPG3lhd8vu_uXBSjPFFjBRZPG7xCGekC  You should also watch all 4 trailers as they are the prequels to ep 1 and introduce the character as well as provide some foreshadowing to season 2.

I've got a Pentium G630T which is a 2.3Ghz dual core and I use the onboard graphics. Never skipped a beat. Could even handle some moderate Photoshop usage without any great slow down.  That PSU is pretty price for only 300W. Being a HTPC you don't need anything stronger really, but I HIGHLY recommend the Antec Earthwatts 380W PSU. I've bought two of these so far and they're reliable and put out as much power as needed. I can't vouch for any actual power savings but I would assume with a name like ""EarthWatts Green"" it'd at the very least be as efficient as the one you posted. And it's only $40. Heads up though, it doesn't come with the power cord that goes to the wall outlet, they didn't include it so you can ""recycle your old cord"" (but we all know it was so they could save a buck)."

What that means is that if you have it outputing to your TV at 1920x1080, and you are watching a video that has a resolution that doesn't multiply evenly to 1080 (any standard definition resolution), it is going to have some video tearing through the middle of the screen.  I had the DN2820FYKH NUC, which has a CPU slightly more powerful than this one, and it suffered that problem.  For me it wasn't a big issue, I just avoided standard definition video.

htpc,3b9rik,Lord_Zero,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:31:36 2015 UTC,"Hey OP. I have a Pi2 that I just bought for this exact purpose. My setup is slightly different than yours but the concept is the same. I have a NAS which is basically a computer with a couple harddrives in them, and I have them on one big share. I then use the Pi and Kodi to pull them down off the share.  Some things I have learned. Wireless through the Pi's USB ports are SLOW. I experienced lots of buffering so now I just drag out my super long Ethernet cable when I have to play anything over 720.  How are you planning to wirelessly stream them? A share as well? I feel like a Chromecast would be a better option if he doesn’t want anything complex. Make sure you have a good wireless router (maybe at least 'n' or better, same goes for the laptop), and then get an Android app called LocalCast with that you can actually tell the Chromecast to play stuff off your share.  IMO his needs arent enough to justify all the work the Pi would require. For the $80 (after components) you should look at little set top boxes that can play media off of shares and then call it a day. Either that or build a cheap HTPC and put Windows on it and add his laptop share as a networtked drive.  Personally I regret going with the Pi as an HTPC. I love it as a development box, and a tiny server like a VPN. But I want to build my own windows box where ill have more power and it will be easier to setup and use for my guests/family, so if you want my Pi2 (I bought the CanaKit on Amazon) then ill strike you a deal."
htpc,3b9rik,NedSc,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:58:48 2015 UTC,"Wifi from a Pi depends on the adapter you use and the signal range.

htpc,3b9rik,NedSc,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:26:40 2015 UTC,"A Pi2 will totally do everything you need. If it's the cheapest option or not depends on various things, like if you have a spare mSD card or spare power supply (or open USB port by the TV), etc. A lot of people have all of the ""extras"" laying around their house. If you have a TV that supports CEC then you can use the TV's remote to control the Pi.   A Fire TV stick also works really good and comes with a remote and power supply, all for $40 (sometimes less). Wifi is decent, but you might need to use the HDMI extender (included) to prevent rf interference from the TV itself. The difference of a few inches for the wifi antenna can he massive when it comes to the wifi signal.   In summary:  Look at Pi2 if you have the parts laying around (and a good USB wifi dongle, something around $20 and not the $5 cheapies).   Look at the Fire TV stick if you need a remote and power supply. You'll have to sideload Kodi, and be sure to use the ""FireStarter"" launcher to make it easy to open Kodi by default instead of the Fire TV interface.

htpc,3ba1wv,HTPCgamerNewb,3,Sat Jun 27 05:38:33 2015 UTC,"Check out powerline ethernet, for example the TP-LINK TL-WPA4220 300Mbps, which I use due to wireless not reaching through multiple floors.  These systems work a lot better than they did a few years ago, and basically you can attach cat5 to the powerline base stations on each floor for a more direct connection, and they can also act as wifi repeaters.  I'd suggest buying them from somewhere with easy returns in the event the wiring in your house isn't compatible (it's rare and has to do with how the electrical system is organized in your breaker box).  Powerline networks are not ideal for serious internet gaming on the extended network (there's a little extra latency), but it's fine for streaming via Plex or other HTPC systems.  Just to give you an idea of a basic setup:   The router is wired to my HTPC and my Powerline Base station. The Base station plugs directly into a power socket. The router broadcasts ""HomeWifi"" On the second floor, there's a Powerline Repeater plugged directly into the a socket.  I have one computer attached to the repeater via cat5. The repeater also broadcasts the extended wifi as ""HomeWifi2ndFloor"".  You can keep it all the same name, but I've found wireless devices get less confused by grabbing the strongest signal when it has a different name."

The G3258 (at stock clock speed) has almost equal performance, but is overclockable.  Might not interest you.  Also, 8gb of RAM is not necessary.  I run a G3258 with 4gb RAM, and its plenty enough.    And, that motherboard is a bit spendy, unless it has some specific features that you need.

htpc,3b7ki2,sylocheed,2,Mon Jul 6 03:24:21 2015 UTC,I'm in Australia so prices may be a little different but it was about $200 AU for the NUC itself. I paired it up with a $60 128GB SSD and 4GB of DDR3L that I had lying around. They are/were listed on Amazon for around the $129US mark from memory.  I'm running Windows 8.1 with Kodi paired up with PleXBMC and NetfliXBMC.  I'm still fine tuning it but so far so good. Steam Game Streaming works fine and everything runs relatively smooth.  All the content I've tried has worked fine but I don't really ever require anything more than 1080p so I'm not sure how it would go with 4k or those fancy anime codecs.  But for the size and power consumption I'm very happy.
htpc,3b7ki2,stratreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:09:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is super helpful. I should a little clearer with context: So when I last built a silent, low-powered HTPC from scratch back in 2009, the most inexpensive low-powered CPUs did not have the compute power to do software 1080p video, and these setups depended on GPU acceleration which works most of the time with Windows MPC-HC, but not all the time.   Do you know if the new Celeron in your NUC has enough CPU compute to handle pretty much any kind of 1080p, with or without the benefit of hardware decode?"
htpc,3b7ki2,sylocheed,2,Tue Jul 7 02:52:25 2015 UTC,Everything I've thrown at it has worked fine (I assume with hardware decoding which apparently is one of the improvements with these new low powered chips).

With Windows 8 Media Player it plays fine sitting at about 15-45% cpu usage (GPU accelerated). Through VLC it sits at 100% CPU usage and drops frames all over the show (I'm assuming not GPU accelerated).  Not sure how that compares to older ones but unless power usage is an absolute concern you may be better off spending a little extra and getting the I3 model."

It is not reasonable for MS to just abandon people when they have software that will work with Win10  I can't imagine if they lost 10% or more of their customers..   But I would bet that many won't be upgrading .. i know I won't until i am sure there is a free solution for Media Center to be replaced with..

htpc,3b3y4e,amfjani,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:12:24 2015 UTC,"GMA 4500 is actually the first Intel GPU capable of 40 Mbps H.264. Unfortunately only the Windows driver and codec (Microsoft DTV-DVD Video Decoder) works. In OpenELEC, Kodi on Windows, or even MPC-HC with default settings you get rainbow artifacts. The only software stack I've found that delivers <5% CPU usage and glitch-free playback is MPC-HC with the internal codec unchecked so it falls back to the system one. VC-1 assist appears to only work in Windows Media Player. YouTube CPU load on this Core 2 Duo & GMA 4500 system is about 20% compared with <5% on a Haswell system or any system with a 2009+ AMD card.  You can disable hardware acceleration in Kodi to eliminate the glitching, but the increased fan noise due to high CPU load may be annoying."

I just saw this on neweggs ad today and thought refurbished workstations would make a descent HTPC. They are usually quite and they are a good form factor that would fit in with an receiver, or other components of a home theater setup.  The price on Newegg and most other sites are the downside because you could throw in $50-70 more and build and brand new computer with modern hardware.  But I was thinking finding classified or local surpluses would be a better way to go. You can find some for under $100 if you look around.

Also, notwithstanding that it's a horrible idea for any device from which you want to serve content, if you must have WiFi on the machine it'll be cheaper to get a non-WiFi equipped motherboard and buy a $10 USB dongle.  CPU-wise there's no real reason to use the 4130T over the cheaper and faster 4130 model; at idle they're going to use the same (low) amount of power and chuck out the same amount of heat, and you're not building some ludicrous ultra-SFF box so heat dissipation isn't an issue.  4GB of RAM should be sufficient for your purposes for now.

Micro ATX, Mini ITX, etc?   It's whatever fits in your chosen case. Lately I've been going Mini ITX because there's nothing they can't do, since you don't need a multi-GPU gaming setup. (Few people do.) You can put a Mini ITX board in a larger case 90% of the time.   Do I consider the addition of a SSD to supplement mechanical hard drive?   For what you're describing, you're not going to be rebooting this machine or switching apps that often. An SSD is great if budget isn't an object. If I were you, though, I'd consider one of these. Lots of space and they still boot in under 10 seconds. I've been using them in gaming rigs for a while now when an SSD would be a hassle.    Anything else to consider?   Go with a Pentium G3450 instead of that i3. It's actually faster and cheaper. You don't need hyperthreading for this. Also, use the factory heatsinks and fans until you determine that you really need something else, which you won't.   You really need to read the FAQ about Live TV. There aren't many really good options for it on Time Warner, as they DRM all the channels. That's going to be your biggest hurdle.

htpc,3b07gc,spriggig,3,Thu Jun 25 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"I want to build a small lightweight PC to run plex and act as a lightweight NAS server, while also being able to use steam in home streaming. Basically, a NAS server capable of streaming at the same time (I assume using it as a steam streaming client is similar to streaming with plex or Netflix) do you think your i3 would still be powerful enough for all that? I want something low lowered but asked in another subreddit where most users said id need something like an i5/i7."
htpc,3b07gc,unvaluablespace,3,Thu Jun 25 03:14:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, it will handle as a server just fine, but the only concern is that since you want to use it for Steam streaming, is this the main PC that will powerhouse the games to stream to other devices?  Or, are you only accepting the stream from your other gaming device?  Receiving the stream takes very little processing power.  I tested it out on an old Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 and it worked perfectly, just to see.  But, if this is going to be the main gaming PC as well that then streams your games to other devices, you need to then consider what games you play.  If you want to stream a lot of the newer stuff, then you will want an i5 processor (i7 unnecessary as games, for now, don't really take advantage of hyperthreading, however be aware, if you are running lots of transcoding signals from a Plex server simultaneously, an i7 is best), a decent amount of RAM, and of course, a solid GPU.  If you are just playing simple graphic'd indie games, or classic games, you'll be fine without."
htpc,3b07gc,GeneticsGuy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer, man.  :)  Lol yes, the PC in question would just be the client, not the host. My gaming rig is an i7 with 16gb RAM and gtx 670 (for now) lol. That would be the host machine only used to stream out my library to the TV pc I want to build.   To go into more detail, what I'd like to build is a media center/NAS server/steam streaming client box, that would hopefully be low powered. I was hoping for something possibly fanless (I've had bad experience a long time ago with an older machine that caught fire on me, so paranoid n not comfortable running my gaming rig or something similarly high powered 24/7.)  The theoretical PC in question would be powerful enough to play locally, as well as stream,1080p content, probably via xbmc. Act as a NAS file server for storage (considering just using a couple USB 3.0 devices), and be able to stream steam games from my gaming rig to my TV when needed. Was considering also possibly adding a bluray drive for bluray/DVD movie playback. The machine would be setup for the end user (my gf and I typically) to ONLY access xbmc,Netflix,and steam, all of which mostly for video streaming/playback. I could access this PC via remote desktop or whatever on my gaming rig for any configuration or adding/removing content. End user experience would only be controllable via remote or game controller.   Are my demands too high for my expectations of hardware? Lol. I feel like it really wouldn't, since most usage is just streaming related (steam prefers devices capable of hardware decoding/encoding h.264)"
htpc,3b07gc,unvaluablespace,3,Thu Jun 25 06:06:10 2015 UTC,"These kinds of questions are actually kind of fun so I'll try to hit your points lol.  Gaming rig is fine, probably aren't even bottlenecking that i7 at all with your gaming, just your GPU might be a little now.  First off, if you want your system to be able to do everything you said, you don't need something really powerful.  I assume you want something fanless because you want a ""silent"" HTPC, also powersaving?  You could do this with even the intel Celeron anniversary edition that is so hot right now lol.  But, be aware, that only supports 2x USB 3.0 slots if you have more Drives than that.  Again, go based by your needs.  Imo, as I have done the fanless thing, it is nice, but occasionally you hit like max-load on those CPUs, and unless you undervolt them, and deal with that hassle, sometimes they are not really worth it.  Just get a fan.  Almost all bios' or lots of fan software out there lets you customize your own fan profiles if you really want to, so just set low-fan speed.  Most fans will be completely noiseless at below 40% speed, and you could say, have zero fan speed, thus being fanless, unless CPU hits like 50C or something, and it boosts up to 20% on.  I think this is the best solution as it gives flexibility.  Fans take incredibly a small amount of power anyway.  Oh and the whole fire thing, modern CPUs ""should"" actually have safeguards in place now that actually auto-underclock and the CPUs and shuts them down if they get too hot to stop the risk of the old fire hazard issue lol.  You can easily play and stream locally a 1080P signal on something as weak as a raspberry pi machine.  This is not gonna be an issue for practically any device you run.  Integrated intel graphics are more than enough to handle a 1080P signal flawlessly.  A NAS also requires very little processing power.  Just remember a NAS just means, Network Attached Storage.  You can just throw in a bunch of Hard Drives (if you want, Raid them for one giant drive, but this has risks if you don't have an auto-backup system, as if one drive goes out, you lose the data on ALL drives), and then connect the system to your home network, allowing the folders to be ""shared"" between devices. Boom, it's that simple, all of a sudden you have a NAS.  Now, this is where operating system comes in to play, and imo, it seems like your only 2 real options here are either some Linux Distro or Windows.  Typically, if it was ONLY a NAS, you could install some really lightweight server program to manage the data, but since you want to have Steam on it AND you want it to be your media center AND you want it to be your NAS, you need something that can do all of the above.  Windows is kind of overkill, but it is also incredibly easy to use and get most of the programs up and running without issues or much tinkering to get all your drivers working right.  If you are comfortable with the command line, it's nice to go with Linux as you can just SSH into your system, but since you said you are looking to remote desktop to it, windows 8.1 I think has remote desktop built in (does win 7?).  Either way, Win 10 coming out for free soon if you have a win8 or 7 license, so ultimately win 10 does have such a feature.  You can also configure this specific OS to boot into say, Steam big picture mode for streaming or straight into XBMC or Plex, whilst keeping bigPicture Steam open in the background or something so you can easily swap back and forth.  Blu ray drive is interesting because unfortunately, you have to PAY to be able to watch Blu Ray movies.  They are licensed through Sony, and to get a fully movie playable BluRay player, you have to pay for the software to watch the movies and then use that software.  It's REALLY annoying, hence why I have forever ditched the blu-ray player for playing moviesand just rip all my movies Lossless quality, fully uncompressed with ""MakeMKV"" software (which is still currently Free while in Beta, yay!).  But of course, I have a Blu-Ray player because I need it so I can rip my BluRay movies! MakeMKV also strips all the annoying menus.  But again, I understand, as sometimes you grab a Redbox movie and want to pop it in as soon as you get home, not spend 20 minutes transcoding and ripping the disk and copying it to your server before watching it lol.  Blu Ray drives that also come with the license to play the movies aren't that pricey, often see em go on sale for like 50 or 60 bucks (I should say this includes the BD-RW, not just readers, but writers too).  So, just be aware, that you can do that, and again, it's no different than playing another 1080P signal and a Blu-ray player doesn't somehow cost a lot of CPU power, but you gotta use specific software that is licensed through Sony to play the official discs.  Even VLC won't play Sony Blu Ray movies.  Though, you can add some decoders that are out there, but it seems like Sony is updating the security every month on those discs and often these decoders are not up to date, so you will have a tough time with the newest stuff.  While Steam prefers devices capable of hardware decoding, feel at ease here because essentially everything decodes with hardware lol.  Think of it this way.  Since your PC is just streaming a video signal, and you are only giving it some input with say, the controller, it's not all that different than just streaming a 1080P video on youtube.  Ya, I am simplifying it a bit, but Steam streaming is really mostly just that.  All the work is done on your gaming PC.  The ONLY thing to really be concerned about it say, if you are using a Plex server, instead of XBMC, Plex does a lot of transcoding.  Whilst they do a lot of direct streaming, if the device supports it, it also will transcode files.  Plex is really cool because of how much compatibility it has with Linux, Apple, Windows, and pretty much all the smart phones and tablets out there.  It has apps for your smart TVs and everything.  This is really awesome.  So awesome in fact, that this past weekend, I was flying Jet Blue which has free wifi internet on board, that at 40,000 ft, I was streaming a movie from my home Plex server on my tablet. This would not have been possible with XBMC because it doesn't do transcoding.  It would have to buffer forever (remember I rip all my movies in 100% lossless quality, so 40GB Blu Ray movies might take a while to Buffer lol).  However, on the airplane, whilst it technically was high speed and free, it wasn't crazy high speed unless I wanted to pay 10 bucks an hr, so I just lowered my bit-rate and quality of the video to 2Mbps streaming, and it streamed my videos perfectly from home, whilst my wife, in the seat next to me, was also busy streaming on her own tablet her own video from our home server, whilst my brother was sitting in his room streaming a TV show at full quality to his house, since I shared my server with him.  However, now I have 3x signals being transcoded, and all of a sudden that intel Celeron might not be so great as my media server CPU, and that is why I use an i7 for my media server. This is where you need to determine your needs and for most people, this is complete overkill, as most people just don't need to decode so many simultaneous stream, and/or they don't even have the upload bandwidth to provide the streams anyway from their ISP.  Just know your needs and go in accordingly.  Imo, going with at least an i3 promotes the best user-happiness, and then only move up from there if you know you are going to need it.  My advice is that of someone not an expert, just an enthusiast, so I wouldn't take my advice as the end-all of advice in these regards, and it might be wortwhile to get multiple opinions.  I just find often people on this subreddit like to suggest the bare minimum for one's needs. And, while they work, I would rather lean more towards overkill than bare minimum, as it gives me room to expand in the future, and also, I love everything to be super snappy.  Just make sure you have your OS installed on an SSD... that's actually really important imo lol.  You don't need a dedicated GPU for what you intend to be doing."

htpc,3b07gc,Kratzyyy,2,Sat Jun 27 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"I would recommend buying an Amazon Fire TV Stick, installing Plex on your PC, and streaming your content from your PC to the stick. There's a Plex app that you can install onto the Fire TV simply through its on screen market stuff.  The Fire TV stick is basically like a Chromecast, but for £5 more you get a bluetooth remote, an extra processor core, twice the RAM and 4x the storage. If you have Amazon Prime you can also stream instant video, plus Netflix, YouTube, iPlayer etc.  This is the setup I currently use, albeit with a NAS running Plex rather than my PC, and it works flawlessly."

htpc,3b07gc,GeneticsGuy,2,Wed Jun 24 23:02:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, so when I was new to the whole HTPC thing, I was in the same situation as you, and my solution was to just buy a really long HDMI cable... Distance was 24' needed, so I bought a 25' HDMI cable for like 10 bucks (through Amazon, you'll spend like 30-40 bucks for that length going through Best Buy or something lol).  I stealthily ran the cable around the edges of the room, taped it tightly into the corners, behind the couch, along the wall to behind my TV center.  Well, it worked, but... it SUCKED doing this!  Why?  Because it sucks bad to have your main PC and your HTPC as the same center.  Yes, I could use the Plex Home Theatre or XBMC this way, but let's say my wife wanted to watch something on the server whilst I wanted to work on the PC?  I suppose if you don't have to deal with that situation, no big deal, BUT, it can become a further annoyance when you want to VPN your home PC whilst downloading some torrents of some TV shows, but your server now won't work right as you VPN that PC and all of a sudden you can't access your Plex server on another device anymore whilst you have downloads going.  At the end of the day, you WILL eventually come to want a solitary HTPC.  It is worth the minor investment to do it.  I eventually built myself a home server, as I wanted to go all out, and now have 3 HTPC nodes in 3 diff. rooms, but that is completely unnecessary if you are not looking for that.  There is nothing wrong with wanting a solid HTPC and since you say price isn't a big deal, I'd recommend building yourself a moderate HTPC to do the job.  Just my opinion.  You don't need to go as cheap as a raspberry pi, since you are not on a minimal budget, but you also don't need to build a system with an expensive GPU either.  It really comes down to your needs.  Since I like to stream something in my home on my own TV, and the wife might stream something in the bedroom, and since I gave 2 of my siblings access to my Plex server, I might have 4 1080P streams going simultaneously (You need good upload Mbps speed to do this of course too), so my server runs an i7, as Plex does a lot of transcoding, and it handles all of it flawlessly and I don't want to have ""just enough"" I want it to do it with ease..  Most people are not in my situation, so judge your own needs and you may find that even a low-end Celeron is all you need for your HTPC as at the most you will only ever have 1 signal streaming.  Way more than enough.  Feel free to bug us for more advice after you contemplate your needs.  But ya, again, you CAN do the long HDMI cable... I've been there, but it sucks after a while because of ""minor"" annoyances.  So, if you were poor, you might just deal with it, but if you can afford to not deal with them, build a dedicated HTPC.  Just my opinion."

A set of original large Advents (which I had to refoam myself) for $10 at the flea market . Take headphones (1/4 inch plug) with you to check out the electronics.

htpc,3ay48z,SloppyGrandma,5,Wed Jun 24 12:58:37 2015 UTC,"Tuners do Exactly what you think they do. WMC is just a front end ( A very Good one an that) that allows you to watch and RECORD OTA TV signals but there are others. WMC will continue to work on those platforms it's currently on for the foreseeable Future.  Tuners are Tuners. Some are cards you place inside the machine, Others will be exterior Dongles hanging out of a USB port. Then there  is the Network attached devices like the HDHOMERUN line of products. They all do the same thing though. Antenna Source IN, TV out (via WMC in this case)  The only thing you should be aware of Is the number of Tuners.  2 Tuners means you can watch/record (or a combination of) 2 channels at once.  4 Tuners = watch/record (or a combination of) 4 channels at once and so on."
htpc,3ay48z,Random_CAPS_guy,5,Wed Jun 24 13:49:06 2015 UTC,"The tuner converts the signal from the antenna (or cable company) into a format that software on the computer can use (separating the channels).   You will have to hook either a cable signal or an antenna to the tuner, so you'll only get the channels that you can get with whatever service you have available (you won't get cable channels if you have an antenna, and you won't get channels that you cant pick up with the antenna).  All tuners will give you the same channels, but there are different types of tuners depending upon the type of signal you are trying to use (OTA Broadcast vs. Cable).   WMC will continue to work on older versions of Windows, and there is other software available if you want to move to Windows 10 (as long as you don't use cable with premium channels).  As for the rest, there's a FAQ on the sidebar >>"
htpc,3ay48z,hdsrob,3,Wed Jun 24 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"Not all tuners work on every system. I have two Avermedia tuners that only work on Windows, I wouldn't have bought them 5 years ago had I realized this. I now have a Silicon Dust HDHomerun Connect that is cross-platform and easily accessible from my HTPC or laptop. I say network tuners are the only way to go."
htpc,3ay48z,climb1000,3,Wed Jun 24 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"A tuner by definition is device that takes a broadcasted signal, whether that broadcast is over the air via radio waves, or over a cable, and tunes to a certain frequency and extracts the video content.  WMC is simply the front end software that takes the data from the tuner and displays it on your monitor/tv.  Over their air radio signals very greatly on your location and where your local stations broadcast towers are and you only get the basic openly broadcast local channels usually 2-13 and a bunch of garbage channels.  If you chose to, you can however use your tuner card with your existing cable service but requires a cable card be rented from your cable service similar to renting a cable box.  In this scenario you will get all channels that you are paying for with your cable subscription.  The cable card will be coded with your account information and will decrypt the channels you are paying for.   EDIT: keep in mind you need to by the type of tuner base on how your planning on using it.  If over the air, get n over the air tuner.  If your going to pay for cable, get a tuner with a cable card slot."
htpc,3ay48z,SynXacK,2,Wed Jun 24 20:38:22 2015 UTC,there are two types of tuners.. ones for Antenna .. ones for CableTV within those two groups you can get a tuner thats on a internal card or one on USB... you can also get a network tuner but they are more expensive and normally do 2 to 6 tv shows at a time which is overkill for you to test.  If you can get Antenna TV in your area without a roof or attic antenna then get a $10 usb Tuner Stick and give it a shot.. they normally come with a cheap garbage antenna but it probably will work for you.

Either HDMI or DVI (thru HDMI adapter) will allow you to hook it up to any modern TV.  That said, onboard video on any PC from the last 10 years is probably fine as a starter HTPC (meaning capable of playing, storing, and streaming 1080P video no problem).

I think anything around the 2007 year or older would be a bad choice. You're also dealing with some ""well used"" parts at that point.  A good idea might be to target a second-hand machine that fits the form factor you're looking for. Something like an Optiplex 780 ultra-small form factor - Link  These sit on their side and kind of mimic a DVD player, in a way.

htpc,3avg8x,Mike-W,2,Tue Jun 23 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"Apparently NAS is a better option, but I don't want to stream, I'd rather play straight to the TV via HDMI.   Is there a reason why you don't want to stream over your local network? A Gigabit LAN is actually faster then the local USB2 connection you had with your External drivers and the WDTV Live. There will be no signal degradation streaming over a Gigabit network, your HTPC will play the files to the TV via HDMI exactly the same as it would if it was stored on a local drive.   I like LAN streaming because I have a central storage location every device can access HTPC, Normal computer, Tablets, and Cellphone. Also a dedicated NAS will have a better options on backups and redundancy. Plus it lets be setup very small and low powered computer's a HTPCs. With Local storage you need a bigger box to house the HTPC.   However local is nice because it takes out one piece of hardware that could break. No network hassles and you only need to manage one computer. It will also take less power because one less computer needs to be running.   Is there a limit to how much storage you can put into an HTPC before it gets too loud/power hungry/hot?   You can get around 6 Hard drive in a ATX mid-towers easy. Most ATX mid-towers have about 6 hard drive spaces. The average motherboard has about 6-8 SATA ports.  If you really need more there are SATA PCI cards you can buy to add more SATA ports to your system and you can buy something like this that will go your DVD drives slots on your case.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817994155  That will hold 5 more hard drives. At this point you will probably run out of power connectors on a standard power supply. But 11 Drives is quite a bit of storage.   Power and Heat can be a problem, but with good ventilation and fans you will be fine, it will be louder but as long as you can control the fan speeds it shouldn't be to bad.  I think I would go with low RPM drives, like the WD Green drives. Normally I hate green drives with a passion on because they are worthless for most things. But for a HTPC storage they will do a good job and keep the heat and noise down."

Either way, I'm not in a position to have both a NAS and an HTPC right now, so it looks like an HTPC will be the way to go.  I think it would take me a long time to outgrow 12TB of storage.

htpc,3anc1g,AMidgetAndAClub,5,Sun Jun 21 23:27:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to talk bang-for-your-buck, NUCs are terrible value for performance, because they use Ultra-low-wattage laptop CPUs.  A laptop i3 is far less powerful than a desktop i3.  An i3 NUC will cost you about $360, once you add 4gb RAM, and a 120gb SSD.  This gets you a CPU with a passmark score of 3000 (remember you need 2000 to do a single Plex stream, so this is most of your CPU power).  If you built a Mini ITX PC, you could have far more CPU power than that.  Below is a build for the same $360 price, but this gets you a CPU with a Passmark score of 5500 (enough to run 2x plex streams simultaneously, and still enough CPU power leftover to do something else alongside that).    Not to mention the Mini ITX build gives you lots of more storage options (this case gives you room for 4x HDDs), and room for a video card if you ever wanted to game on it.

As long as the machines have a solid, fast network connection, the share on the NAS will be more than fast enough to feed Plex transcoding to stay ahead of the viewer.  In my case, I use wired gigabit.  If you can, I'd recommend you do the same.  If you must use wifi, 802.11n or ac on a 5GHz channel located near to your AP is your best bet."
htpc,3an8uf,boxsterguy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:43:26 2015 UTC,"Would it be possible to have my computer still stream media if it was accessing it via the router attached storage?   Yes.   I share some streams, would those be able to access it without a major hit?    Maybe.  My server has similar stats to yours (4790K + 16gb) and I can handle 10+ streams.  Your limiting factor here is going to be bandwidth, and how well the router/HDD combo work together.  If you are sharing remotely, your internet upload is going to most likely be the limiting factor depending on your ISP and tier.  After that, I would turn my attention to your asus/HDD combo, to make sure it can handle multiple streams.  After that, the wifi connection between your media and your PC.  Those 3 points will be your main troubleshooting points if you have buffering or other hiccups.   Also, is it possible to have plex stream from the router/nas/external HDD?   Yes, but isn't this the same as the first question?  When you add a new library to Plex, it doesn't have to be local, it could be a share.  I know a couple of people that use Plex + Drobo or similar NAS devices.  Keep in mind, Plex (PMS, PHT) is free, and is pretty easy to set up and test, and remove if you don't like it.  Set aside a couple of hours one day and install it, then stream to as many local devices as you can in the house, and then as many remote devices as you can.  You can add a small test library with just your highest bitrate stuff and a few other diverse test media, then stress test all your limits (max number of people you would have using at once, transcoding/streaming, etc)"

I used to live in Belgium and I could get everything from Norway all the way down to Egypt. Although it makes it a pain to do a channel list... so many channels.  It's been a few years since I've lived in Europe, but you should still have to option of buying a Dreambox receiver or something similar with a Linux OS.

htpc,3abu0y,geezfools,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:59:09 2015 UTC,I build htpc's for my friends and always include the k400.  I had same problems as you for nearly a year!   Finally realized that it was getting interference from wifi (even when plugged into the front of the htpc). This keyboard uses the over crowded 2.4ghz spectrum.   The solution was to buy a 10ft usb extension cable and move it almost to the ceiling. Now it works even beyond 33ft.

htpc,3adwqn,jamesn86,2,Fri Jun 19 09:24:37 2015 UTC,"well the first thing you should understand about HTPCs vs a Desktop or Gaming Computer is that you don't really need that much power but you do need enough to get things done with a bit of spare room.  Storage will probably be your main concern .. Right now external 5TB Drives are the most cost effective purchase if you can find them on sale for $125 or less. You can also open these external USB drives and place them inside your computer.. If you got 2 of them and put them in a RAID you would be pretty safe for loss of storage and have lots of room to store stuff. You don't need a SSD or High Speed Drive unless you expect to record live tv off an antenna or off of CableTV.  Second I would go with a MATX sized motherboard and you want one that has HDMI out so you can hook it to your TV. Then you will want to use the onboard Audio from the back of the case .. make sure it has the 7.1 if that is what you want.  You can get on motherboard Wired and Wifi but a wifi USB dongle is $10 .  I would choose an Intel Processor because they have on CPU Graphics and if you want to re-encode videos you can you the GPU to speed up HandBrake by about 50-70% depending on the quality you choose.  you will want a usb wireless keyboard with touchpad or also a mouse.  Cheap cases are probably best you can get a $27 case from MicroCenter with a 400watt power supply included.  8gb ram but choose a motherboard that will allow you to expand that to 16 in the future if you can find one cheap.   Expansion Slots at least a 16x and 1x  That is what I would use.. for a starter. Try to keep your price low you don't need a i7 an i5 will be more than enough and a quadcore i3 might do ok. A Celeron might also be ok but not if you expect to record live TV off an antenna or Cable .. or process a lot of video constantly..  I am on an i5 8gig and between general use, webbrowsing and such and also...  recording up to 4 stations at a time and then re-encoding and storing all those shows constantly .. I use between 25% and burst to 50% of CPU for short periods.."
htpc,3adwqn,ZippyTheChicken,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"I second this but would just like to add that though I don't use raid currently (one of these days), if you spend any amount of time in a FreeNAS forum you'll see the phrase ""raid is not a back up"" used often. I'd stick with the i3 as well unless you think you'll be using Handbrake at all in the next couple of years, in which case an i5 would be in order.   I'm assuming the 1x expansion slot would be for a tuner? If so I just unplugged one of two AverMedia HD Duets for a HDhomerun Connect and will be replacing the other Duet with another HDHomerun network tuner (maybe the Extend) when the new seasons start up. So just one 16x that accepts graphic cards I would think is enough."
htpc,3adwqn,climb1000,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:43:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys, this is quite useful. So I'll look for an Intel processor because then I don't need a separate graphics card? Get a MoBo with HDMI out and something that can process 7.1. I will be using handbrake so I'll be sure to get an i5. Then I think an optical drive of some sort and one or two 3/4TB hard drives (maybe 5400rpm) for storage. Anything I'm missing? I've got a wireless keyboard, maybe I'll look for a Harmony remote down the track."
htpc,3adwqn,davrax,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:58:38 2015 UTC,"Will you being doing any transcoding (for instance, streaming a file from your HTPC to your phone or iPad)? If so, you'll need a more powerful processor than if you were to just use the HTPC as a storage/playback device (plugged into your TV). What file types are you looking to play? DVDs shouldn't present too much of an issue (Blu Ray playback is where it gets tricky on PCs)."
htpc,3adwqn,FrostMute,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:31:57 2015 UTC,Well I guess that's a longer term goal: to be able to stream when my wife and I are away from home. In that instance would I not be better off buying a NAS and just stream directly to my TV from that?  There's just so many options that I can't figure it out. Do I want local storage or front-end only? It seems from what I've read that my Samsung TV doesn't have the processing power to deal with bigger movie files? I think I want local storage but then a front-end system also seems an equally logical route to go especially if you're wanting to stream from elsewhere.  File types are a mix between MP4 and mkv.
htpc,3adwqn,FrostMute,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:42:50 2015 UTC,Do I want local storage or front-end only?   I don't understand what you are talking about here... What do you mean 'front-end only'? You mean like Plex Home Theater or Kodi? Why would you have local storage OR a front-end... You need the local files to serve to the media player (front-end?).
htpc,3adwqn,climb1000,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry, by front-end only, I mean have my media sitting on a NAS somewhere in the house and having Plex or Kodi retrieve from there and serve to the TV. Does that make sense?"
htpc,3adwnx,borlandoflorida,2,Fri Jun 19 09:23:19 2015 UTC,Entry level? That's kind of over-kill for an entry-level HTPC.

htpc,3adwnx,majesticjg,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"I just built a G3258 based HTPC, intending for it to playback and transcode two streams (respectively) simultaneously. I feel it's just about perfect for that. One thing to keep in mind, most of the H97 based mobos don't allow overclocking, and the G3258 is easily overclockable to 4.0 GHz with stock cooling. I went with one of the ASrock Z97 motherboards. I also opted for 8GB of ram, but that's largely because I already had it laying around. I skipped the SSD and put in two 4TB WD Reds due to the fact that I plan on leaving the machine on 24/7 (SSD boot times are nice, but not really worth it for a weekly reboot).

I didn't really notice any playback issues when watching 1080p mkv files or watching live TV from my HDHomeRun (OTA). However, it was sort of slow when navigating menus while watching live TV.

Though, at the same time, don't be too terribly surprised if you end up in a similar situation in a few years.  If it were me and I was just getting a discount I would drop Onkyo completely and go with a different brand.  They said they have fixed their build problems but their past history makes me leery of them.  A lot of your wishlist you're better off buying a Roku or getting a cheap HTPC to serve these functions.  If you're playing AVI files then you need to go the HTPC route as the Roku cannot play them without transcoding from a Plex server or the like.

If you want to play movies from your NAS, you don't need an AVR, you need a specialized device, like a Chromecast, FireTV, etc.  And pushing audio OUT over bluetooth isn't something I think is available. You're going the wrong direction. The AVR is there to decode signals and pass them through to your speakers and TV.   As for using your existing speakers, you can, but you shouldn't. Go to /r/zeos for some advice on inexpensive speakers that still sound great. Or just buy these."
htpc,3aa27p,MDMAmazing,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:38:24 2015 UTC,How has no one mentioned the customer care program from Onkyo!!! Someone from Onkyo should have told you about it. I had the audio chip go out on my receiver and they mailed me a prepaid box to send back to them and I got my fixed unit back in a week. They shipped and fixed my unit for free. I did have the option of get a discount on another refurbished unit but the discount wasn't that good. The customer care program covers both the loss of sound and network. You just have to put in the serial number located on the back of your unit to check but you sound like a prime candidate for the program.
