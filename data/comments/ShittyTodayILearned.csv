ShittyTodayILearned,3dbix0,teaearlgreyhot1701,3,Wed Jul 15 00:06:23 2015 UTC,"Thousands of years ago, I was testing out my new headphones. They were pretty cool for a sixty dollar pair. My sound card had some kind of proprietary crystal sound clarity guy ability that supposedly took my crappy voice or whatever I shoved through my headset's mic and turned it into something that could be understood by human beings. Naturally, I thought it was bullshit, so decided to test it.   To test it, I turned on the feedback option thing that plays crap from your mic right into your ears, then turned the volume all the way up, so the sound of my voice would drown out the sound of my voice. It worked really really well. I was honestly shocked and horrified at how clear it was. I sat there for a while, just saying things, so I could hear the sound of my own voice. I'm pretty sure I said ""Testing"", and ""Wow, this thing actually works"", and maybe I said ""Pogopogopogopogopogopogo"" for a while, too.   Then I farted.   This wasn't just any fart. This was some kind of kungfu-powered super fart that had spent half my life building for this one moment. It was loud. It hurt. It made the entire room reverberate.   It was picked up by my mic. The soundcard did its thing. It clarified that expulsion of wind into its purest aural form, then pumped it into both my ears with the power of a thousand suns.   On that day, I farted myself to deaf."

At best he'd get a bible, but I doubt he'd get any food, and the story shared would not necessarily be his.  In fact, I think they just find random pictures of starving African kids on the internet, make up a name, and ask for money, those horrible fucks."
