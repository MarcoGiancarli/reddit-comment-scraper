Also worth a look is the place in Titarangi, they don't do a souvlaki  but have some other interesting dishes. All mentioned places use proper meat, not the Kebab's on Queen style pseudo meat."
auckland,3e6982,insanefreak,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:51:43 2015 UTC,thanks :) unfortunately i live in Mount Albert so a trip to Belmont Kebabs is probably unlikely haha but will def keep in mind! Kelston is definitely do-able.
auckland,3e6982,OldWolf2,2,Wed Jul 22 08:16:38 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you are trying to say about shaved meat. All of those places use shaved meat, it comes on big spits.  The best way is to have it cooking on the spit in the shop, and shave it off to order, and then sear it on the hot plate.  Some places have the spit but don't cook it after shaving, which is bad both hygiene-wise and taste. Avoid those places.  If you didn't see a spit in the souvlaki place, either they had it out of plain sight, or the meat would have been shaven and cooked elsewhere and reheated onsite.  Great Northern Kebab at Surrey Crescent used to be absolutely fantastic, although I haven't lived there for a long time now so IDK its current status."

auckland,3e4fjt,SneakyTangiwha,2,Tue Jul 21 22:39:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that there should be some concern, but provided that the building code is ""solid"" (now that its addressed leaky homes, etc.), then free-market economics will take place.     Developers are out to make money, and they make more by providing a quality development.  If its a studio apartment for sale/rent, and you think its too small?  Don't buy/rent it.  I think that this will help in the small term, but long term, there needs to be more apartment blocks, with 20+ levels."
auckland,3e4fjt,ThunderSteaks,2,Tue Jul 21 23:25:36 2015 UTC,There will always be someone who wants to live in a shoe box. If not only international students who are used to tiny dwellings from their home cities.
auckland,3e4fjt,master5o1,2,Wed Jul 22 03:16:03 2015 UTC,"but that can be hard as there are many people who have to be in auckland so they maybe forced into renting small accommodations at high rent prices unless the necessary supply of medium sized dwellings exist. But we still need high density/mixed use developments and this is a step towards that. But also a concern is shit tradies who cut corners, no matter how good the policy or building code is if they just ignore it all."
auckland,3e4fjt,SneakyTangiwha,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:24:22 2015 UTC,"Ya, that's definitely always a concern with tradies, but I think those guys kill themselves off in the long run.

auckland,3e4fjt,QueenBeeYacht,4,Wed Jul 22 07:22:44 2015 UTC,"We need a combination of quality higher-density housing around suburban centers, and quality higher-density housing in the CBD.  It's not feasible for everyone to have their own detached dwelling on a big chunk of land...we need higher density - but it also needs to offer some choice and alternatives for living right in the city versus living out in suburbs."
auckland,3e4fjt,Hubris2,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:46:37 2015 UTC,"Agree with you about the higher density housing in suburban centers, certainly.   The problem with apartments is the extra costs involved in building and maintaining multi level buildings. Things like elevator maintenance,  building lighting, fire alarm monitoring and testing, specialised insurance, and body corp management all add thousands of dollars a year to the cost of an appartment.  Dense two level townhouses don't suffer from these problems, but significantly increase the density."
auckland,3e4fjt,bpkiwi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:55:31 2015 UTC,I was told by my sibling that a person at their work pays $15k a year in body corp fees. so those costs can certainly add up!
auckland,3e4fjt,SneakyTangiwha,2,Wed Jul 22 07:27:06 2015 UTC,That sounds more like ground rent on a leasehold than body Corp.  But being a work premises I suppose that amount would be correct for a large workspace.
auckland,3e4fjt,tomarata,3,Wed Jul 22 08:41:09 2015 UTC,"I'm all for it. Pockets of higher density housing are really good for an urban area: good for local businesses and more people on the streets makes people feel safer.  And there's less commutes by car, assuming that we can get businesses to stick around the urban areas and not move out to the fringes."

auckland,3e4fjt,Synixx,3,Wed Jul 22 10:24:32 2015 UTC,"Houses in AKL are hugely expensive, traffic is terrible on the motorways. Making dense centers with effective (and ideally cheap) public transport between them will, in theory, kill two birds with one stone. Developers make money, council makes money off developers, urban sprawl is held back, people have less travel time, sure we are living on smaller sections in smaller houses but is that so terrible, look at the housing in London, it will still be better than that."

Auckland is hella expensive right now (even for renting) but the central suburbs which have a younger vibe, and all border the city are Kingsland, Grey Lynn, Ponsonby, Grafton, Newton... pretty much any inner city suburb.   Auckland is a great city don't get me wrong, it's just really expensive to live in at the moment. Wellington is also nice, but a bit boring at times. You could also look in Christchurch, as they are rebuilding the city so there should be a few IT jobs down there."

I am an American expat and you can't underestimate how expensive it is to live here.  I have a tiny drafty house in one of those 'younger' areas and I'm paying $950 a week.  A typical IT salary seems to go from about 70k-100k depending on experience of course.  The work life balance (as an American perspective) is amazing and I don't regret it one bit.

auckland,3dx17w,PNR_Robots,2,Mon Jul 20 06:20:25 2015 UTC,Try buying your diamond + ring from diamond wholesaler not from retailer.  More selections and wayyyy much better pricing.    It is straight away 40-50% off when compare with retail price and you can add another 15% tax free on top of it.
auckland,3dx17w,StephenDNZ,2,Mon Jul 20 09:58:56 2015 UTC,"Check out some online retailers like jamesallen.com or bluenile.com.  If you import just the diamond, you'll only pay GST and no duty. If you import a ring, duty of 5% will apply.    Also use online tools like the holloway cut advisor on Pricescope.  That website also lets you search stock across a number of websites.  Most NZ diamonds at retail stores are terrible quality.    I bought a 1.4ct G VS1 triple excellent diamond from JamesAllen last year and was very impressed with the service.  Admittedly the NZD / USD was 0.8611 at the time!  If the diamond you're buying locally doesn't have a GIA certificate, don't even consider it.  Companies like Walker and Hall do their own diamond grading which can be a long way off independent Grades. I.e a GIA G colour can be advertised as an E if not independently graded.  Good luck!"

auckland,3dx17w,logantauranga,3,Mon Jul 20 20:40:24 2015 UTC,"It's a bit more involved (importing, paying duty, etc), but buying online can save you a shitload. I got my wife (gf at the time) a nice engagement ring online (bluenile.com) and it ended up being half the price of similar ones that we were looking at in auckland stores. I got it valued for insurance and it was genuine and valued at more than we paid for it.

Extreme Edge Panmure: $10? to boulder, gets busy in the evenings. They're currently re-setting their boulder caves, so hardly any problems tagged at the moment. Need to fill in waiver online at www.extremeedge.co.nz Also has yoga on Tuesday nights from 8.45pm for an extra $10-15. There's a group of strong, regular climbers that boulder in the evenings.  Extreme Edge Glen Eden: $10 to boulder, no need for online waiver, just sign in on when you show up. Busiest Monday evenings. 2 boulder caves including the upstairs training cave, plus long traverses set around entire gym. Definitely has the coolest staff (I'm totally biased about this though haha).  Auckland Uni Rec Centre: $12? casual gym entry, or join the Uni rock and alpine club and get free bouldering Wednesday evenings. Small wall, but lots of boulder problems, and very social.   Birkenhead Leisure Centre: council owned, unsure of price. Small upstairs boulder wall, plus boulder problems on the bottom of their lead wall.  Some strong climbers train here.  Long Bay College has a wall but unsure of bouldering their, only open sometimes as it's pretty much run by a couple of Uni students.  I know you say bouldering only, but if she wants someone to climb with send me a message :)"

Housing: Speaking as a long term renter, it is a LOT easier to find a place IN the city than the city fringe suburbs, due to planning regulations and lack of medium-density housing.

They have other sorts of Indian bread. Vegan: Satya. I don't know if any of the others do vegan food. Dum Briyani: Top in Town (but they do take away only). This takes hours to cook. Different from those you order off the menu at other indian restaurants. Paradise is also good. They are South Indian muslims. It is alcohol free in that restaurant. Fijian Indian: Taste of Fiji Sri Lankan: 7 Siri Vegetarian: There's a few including Mumbai Chaat, Jai Jalaram Khaman and Shubh.  If you're after North Indian dishes, they have them but I don't know if it'll be as good as a place that serves North Indian food.

auckland,3dgk6x,as_above_so_below,11,Thu Jul 16 02:34:49 2015 UTC,"We recently almost bought a house. It was going to be $625k. Pretty cheap actually. It was out of town. Can't buy anything where we currently rent for under $7-800k (it's not a great area of town). We had about 18% of that $625k. So our payments were likely to be around $7-800 a week with rates and insurance. Now we can afford around $900 a week because we have higher than average incomes (household $150k). Right now we pay >$550/week for an insulated house in a decile 2 school area. So buying a house-which we wanted for a multitude of reasons, none related to capital gains, would have eaten up all of our savings and any money for luxuries or emergencies.  Which isn't particularly financially sound. I mean wages are not rising, consumer spending is shrinking, but house prices are still increasing. The just work harder/save more narrative is concerning because people will put all their money into houses and less into consumer goods etc. Consumer goods and other investments are necessary for economic health. So basically this house shit is unhealthy.  Essentially anyone who is earning a wage or relying on a wage for deposit costs can not buy.  Things we cannot do, that we had planned on, because we can't buy a house:  Foster a child (though maybe they don't care if you have to move all the time and take what you can get!)  Have a pet. Like a dog or a cat.  Be assured that our kids will be going to one school instead of many.  Landscaping/gardening-though a garden is possible sometimes in some houses there's no guarantee we'll be around long enough for harvest.  Painting children's room(s) and other general house improvement-replace carpet, insulate etc.  So how many industries/etc is that that we aren't contributing to because it requires owning a home?"

auckland,3dgk6x,derwhalfisch,5,Thu Jul 16 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"I live in the house i grew up in, instead of me moving out and renting when i became of age, my parents did so i rent from them, my parents have owned this house since '84 they bought it outright for 69k its a small 3 bedroom on a quarter acre lot in a decent suburb, i walked to primary school (10 mins) i caught a bus to intermediate (5 mins) and if i had gone to the nearest high school it would have been 5 mins as well... so i was on a good bus route.. close to shops, relatively quiet neighborhood except for the road which is long and straight and some cars speed past on Friday's...  The house across the road which is relatively the same setup but 2 story with built in single garage and workshop was owned by a couple that had lived there for about 5 years longer than us, after her husband passed and her self sufficiency changed she put the house up for Auction.. the yard was always tidy but it (like ours) was unlanscaped 60-70's style just tidy mowed grass and a tree or two, the day of the auction i went over to watch the proceedings.. the auction was at 9am but cars started turning up at 7am, by 7:30am there was a crowd and no place to park along the road... the driveway was standing room only.. the starting price was 250k and quickly rose to 500k (the rice she was quoted to expect as her ceiling) then it slowly dwindled to 2 bidders out bidding each other by 20k.....10k......SOLD for 650k and change, the lady was pleased... one bidder who turned up at 8:30am pushed his way to the front was not... he quite audibly threw his hands in the air and cursed once the bidding went past 500k, he left before the auction was closed.. a lot of people looked disappointed.. the lady moved out 3 weeks ago and the new owners have since moved in.   Over the past 5 years i have watched every house around me sold 3 houses on either side, 4 across the road, except for my neighbor who have been here 5 or so years less than us have changed ownership or tenants, and this may seem racist or racially observant but each of those houses are now owned by Indian or Chinese owners.. and in each of the Chinese cases, weeks after they buy the house they sub-divide and develop a back section house, now looking down from Google maps (considering their maps are at least 2 years old) my parents property is one of only 3 properties in the neighborhood with a yard...(1/4 acre) and i have a 2.5 car garage... in the case of the Indian owners, they seem to go from one family to 1.5 families in the same house then a month later .5 then a different family will join and so on.. there are no ""kiwi"" familes living anywhere around me that i know of.. you know.. couple gets married, have a kid buy first house to start a family... i guess its just too expensive.. which is a shame because there are 7 schools within 5 mins drive.  The most recent headline i read in /r/newzealand about the housing problem said that labour was saying that foreign buying of nz homes would be stopped.. i think this is both fair and normal.. i looked into moving to Samoa or Fiji to live a quiet life but found out i was barred from owning property as a non Samoan/Fijian, a lot of countries ban foreign ownership of land.. and with the current mass buy up of international properties by Chinese stock market brokers leaving the stock market and dumping all their finance into real estate it is getting out of control.. every day you are reading about how the government are raising the minimum amount of time you can own a house before putting it back on the market to stop pump and dump on sellers that are raising the prices of homes to levels un reachable by first time home buyers, playing poker with house titles artificially raises their value and it created this bubble (if i understand it correctly) now i like most kiwis can't afford to buy a house and are forced into the ever increasing money hole of renting, my only hope is that i inherit my parents house or that i can get a huge generation of debt loan to buy it off them should the decide to sell.

auckland,3dgk6x,Tabdelineated,2,Thu Jul 16 05:20:38 2015 UTC,I think its an elaborate scheme to get investors to buy property then later on enforce a new law that requires all properties to have <item a + standard b> before it can be rented or leased  pretty much getting them to fork out for upgrades to the suburban infrastructure and raising area values which incentives them to sell for profit and gtfo leaving an improved suburb  lol

auckland,3comws,meplur,5,Thu Jul 9 21:55:56 2015 UTC,"Oh man, maybe this is a thread of fulfilling lost restaurant dreams. Can anyone help me? When I was a kid around ~2000 my mother would take me to a yum cha place. It was on an upper floor of a glass and metal building that I'd estimate to be maybe three or four stories high. It was very boring and old architecture. They served the typical yum cha food but I specifically remember they did the layered red/yellow/white jelly that I haven't seen in other yum cha places, and fortune cookies. When we went back to the parking building we would turn right upon exiting the restaurant doors and walk along the block.   I can't ask my mother because she passed away and I don't know the location either but in good traffic it was within a 30 minute drive of West Auckland. I googled recently and suspected it was Grand Harbor but I never got around to checking. Does anyone know if GH matches my description or if my restaurant shut down?"
auckland,3comws,ShankingTonberry,4,Thu Jul 9 22:12:14 2015 UTC,"Grand Harbour sits on the ground floor, so that doesn't sound like it.  The yum char places that were on upper floors, within 30 minutes drive of West Auckland and were around in 2000 are Pearl Garden in Newmarket (picture of the entrance), Ocean City Restaurant (closed) opposite Victoria Park (street view) and Coral Reef Restaurant (closed) on Beach Road.  One other place that I can think of is Crown Restaurant in Papatoetoe, but that might be a little far.  If there's anything else you can remember about the place, let me know.  edit: one other place that is on an upper level is Golden Phoenix Restaurant in Birkenhead. Not sure if it was there in 2000, I know it was a snooker place in the 90s."
auckland,3comws,larndecarabas,2,Fri Jul 10 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm, it may have been Coral Reef because I remember the first time I drove along Beach Road as an adult I passed a building that looked very similar to my memory. Thanks so much!"
auckland,3comws,ShankingTonberry,3,Fri Jul 10 02:31:35 2015 UTC,"Was it perhaps Ocean City?? It was an Asian restaurant that used to be on Victoria Street but closed quite a few years back. It was on the second story of a large building and I distinctly remember as a kid going there and having coloured jelly!  Edit: Damnit didn't see you had written West Auckland, never mind hahaha I got too excited when I saw you mention the jellies"
auckland,3comws,meplur,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:25:55 2015 UTC,Oh it may have been! We lived out west but we could still make the drive into town within that time frame. From everyone's answers though I'm guessing whichever restaurant it was closed down. Thanks heaps :)
auckland,3comws,ShankingTonberry,2,Fri Jul 10 23:32:48 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help. With regards to the jelly you mentioned, it could be 九层糕, which roughly translates to nine layer cake."
auckland,3comws,meplur,3,Fri Jul 10 02:40:43 2015 UTC,"Yes! That's the stuff! I always feel like such a fail Asian because I never learned Chinese or the names of the foods my mum would make and then I get stuck trying to explain what I mean. While I've got you, I don't suppose you know the names of those little red paper bags with the gold writing on them that you put money in and give on Chinese new year? I tried explaining it to another Asian but they looked at me like I was nuts but my mum always told me it was a traditional thing."
auckland,3comws,19832526,2,Fri Jul 10 05:33:46 2015 UTC,I always feel like such a fail Asian because I never learned Chinese or the names of the foods my mum would make and then I get stuck trying to explain what I mean.   Lol ... it's all good ... I can't read/write and know all this because my friends in high school were from Hong Kong.  紅包 pronounced ang pau or hongbao which translates to Red Envelope. Greatest things ever during Chinese New Year when you're a kid ... not so much when you're married since you're the one that has to deal them out :)  Not usually one to judge ... but your other Asians are pretty fail too for not knowing this ;)
auckland,3comws,meplur,3,Fri Jul 10 06:07:22 2015 UTC,lol been to Grand Harbour and I personally dont think its the one.  I think GH only has two floors and the interior is not that boring...they might have changed though.
auckland,3comws,19832526,2,Thu Jul 9 22:45:57 2015 UTC,"It's the most authentic Malaysian place in Auckland, which is why this review puzzled me. Maybe they caught the chef on a bad day or something."
auckland,3comws,meplur,3,Fri Jul 10 01:13:45 2015 UTC,omg lol thats harsh.  What I dont like about online reviews sometimes is people can just write anything without worrying about the consequences.
auckland,3comws,1210M3D,3,Fri Jul 10 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"Many variation food! Malaysian, western, Chinese.... Malaysian food, it looks like curry with naan, isn't it? I love curry-rice, pepaloni-pizza, ramen (chinese style noodle). I think I can live in Auckland with no problem about foods. lol Architecture is also nice. Civic Theater is good. Corner tower (with clock) have simply wall and less ornament, but other part of building is very decorative. This contrast, impression so nice. I feel about Civic Theater, basically Europe, with little of taste of something Maya, Aztec. So nice design.  Auckland Town Hall seems classic Europ style. Very beautiful with light up. St. Paul's Church is lovely. I feel something friendly, human, familiar, close-to-people. I think I can imagine about character of people of your town from this church, very lovely. Thank you for many photo, last night, too late time, but you talked to me very kind. :)"
auckland,3comws,meplur,4,Fri Jul 10 03:28:13 2015 UTC,"Yup ... in terms of food it's very good here. Dominion Road near the city is full of restaurants, my favourite one being Thai. We even have good Ramen, Yakitori and other Japanese food here in Auckland :)  Because Malaysia is a multi cultural country, you will find that there are many types of Malaysian food,  the popular ones include Nasi Lemak (Malay), Roti Canai (Indian) and Char Kuey Teow (fried noodles) (Chinese). Lots of Malaysian food is spicy, more so than the traditional Japanese curry rice :)"
auckland,3comws,Dead_Rooster,3,Fri Jul 10 03:53:32 2015 UTC,"Yeees! Thai food is very hot and tasty, I love coriander. Ramen,Yakitori, I smiled, there is no difference between Auckland and Japan about Ramen, Yakitori. Nasi lemak, I didnot know this food, make me so hungry, so, now I go to take dinner. Thank you many many photos. You are master of food in Auckland. :)"

auckland,3comws,Yamahebi,10,Thu Jul 9 16:22:22 2015 UTC,"Auckland is very spread out, when you see photos of our harbour and the city it's only a very small part of it. Not many people live in high buildings, we mostly live in detached houses, and we are always close to a beach. There's a lot of farmland too, drive an hour north or south from the modern city and you'll be in the middle of countryside :)"

Japanese city also have good areas and bad areas. like this Shibuya good areas Shibuya bad areas Every country, every city have good side and bad side.

I'm a huge fan of Pokemon, and its a dream of mine to travel to Japan to see some of the Pokemon stores that exist in Japan.  Unfortunately, my understanding of Japanese language is very little.  Can you (or anyone else here)  provide me with any information on any helpful phrases, or how much Japanese language i could learn?  Just enough to get my by, if i were to travel to Japan?  Thank you for any advice."
auckland,3comws,DinaDinaDinaBatman,6,Thu Jul 9 21:41:07 2015 UTC,"Probably the most important word is ""sumimasen"" which means excuse me, or sorry. Use it to get people's attention, or when you have to push past them on the train. Can also be used instead of ""thank you"".   Actually, just buy Lonely Planet's phrasebook, it's the best one."
auckland,3comws,as_above_so_below,3,Thu Jul 9 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"""sumimasen""     I laughed loudly. Yeeees. You are so good teacher of Japanese culture."
auckland,3comws,as_above_so_below,5,Fri Jul 10 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"Hi. Thank you for your question :D Very nice question. I am so glad to hear that you try to travel to Japan. I want to answer seriously, so, give me a little time.     Edit: This is my thought. For simple traveling Tokyo, you need only basic words. Like this, sumimasen (excuse me) arigatou (thank you) uresii (I am happy) oisii (taste good) doko (where) dare (who) ikura (how much) kore (this) and so on....      But many Japanese can catch and understand  such basic English words if you pronounce slowly (Japanese can't catch sentence, especially long sentence when you pronounce fast). So, if you pronounce basic words slowly, somehow, you can communicate with Japanese people in English. Of course learning Japanese language will make your travel easily. But only you have some adventurous spirit with good smile, you will have nice experience in Tokyo, I believe. After Olympic, maybe good, because many English-signs will be provided.    I hope you will have good travel, and sorry for poor English. :)"

They're cramped, dingey, loud, the utilities are monopolised by two way overpriced companies (we were actually told we had to go through a certain power company which was insanely expensive). All the buildings managed by Impression real estate are as bad as each other.  You're better off buying an apartment on a train route- try Kingsland or any of the central suburbs."

For a decent sized apartment that's in a good location and carpark will set up back 500-550 dollars. Anything under that isn't really worth it because you're getting a tiny shoebox and no space to move around
auckland,3cnhtl,hrrrrsn,3,Thu Jul 9 10:15:25 2015 UTC,Thought of converting some office space in K Rd or outer inner city? Plenty of apartments above the shops along KRd. For a decent apartment its still going to cost in inner city because of the low quality builds in the low price ranges.  Would avoid those buildings unless you buy an apartment to rent to students etc.
auckland,3cnhtl,sarahmohawk,2,Thu Jul 9 20:37:29 2015 UTC,"From someone that has brought several apartments in the city before, these are extremely overpriced shoeboxes.

I just feel like if this is the financial approach from the outset, the likelihood of staying above water for a prolonged period of time is slim."
auckland,3ciwkx,mrd_stuff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:28:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I thought it odd they needed to use KS. Hence asking what it was for. I'll likely visit, but I don't think I'll be helping with funding."
auckland,3ciwkx,_-Redacted-_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:20:36 2015 UTC,"At no point do they state this is their main funding source but additional donation funding surely can't be unhelpful. Also, if rewards are due by September, they must be a fair way through the process of opening.  Or really underestimating the cost/time it takes to do this. I'm hoping for the former."

If a small donation, from me, helps increase the chance of it happening I'm more than happy to help. If it fails to happen for whatever reason, and my donation goes to waste. I DO NOT CARE.  I have faith  Emma and James would have tried their best."
auckland,3ciwkx,openxmind,3,Thu Jul 9 08:23:43 2015 UTC,I hope your venture works out well though! Lots of shelf space for games.

A video of you and James would have made an enormous difference, telling us who you are, what you do for a living.  With a bit of internet sleuthing I found out you are a professional librarian. Who doesn't trust a librarian? Because of this single fact I will be donating. You and James are obviously good people. I look forward to meeting the two of you when the cafe opens. Auckland's first true boardgame cafe."

Brown's Bay is OG, Ponsonby is still new, so can be busy. Maruten Ramen — Top place, dirty food court, broth good, noodles ok. Ramen Do — The old favourite, opened in town briefly, people didn't know where it was, closed, now just on Symonds St. Genzui — Good place, weird location, but always busy. Chop Chop — Fusion Ramen, wannabe Momofuku, fails, but noodles are still good, broth is ok. Weird fit out and staff uniform. Part of Blue Breeze Inn. Tanpopo – Not the best, but if you're after ramen and near by worth a look. Mentatz – Don't know why people still go here. Average Daikoku Ramen – Feels like a legit place, but really lacking in flavour and execution. Britomart Zool Zool – Not quite right, Mount Eden village Japanese. Everything seems a bit off here. Ichiban – Place on Albert st, was ok, I know people that like it. Dragon Bowl – I want to like this place, but the ramen isn't great. On Dom Road, same block as Barilla on the corner."

Yes, peak hour commuters are always driving into the sun, so poor visibility.  Yes the entire motorway has been a construction site for, what is it now?, 5 years?.  That means more constricted spaces, and the road layout changes on an almost weekly basis. (I wish I was exaggerating). Even regular users have no idea what the road layout is going to be from one day to the next.  Also, there are numerous bad design decisions along that motorway, that seem intended to cause problems for drivers. eg. What idiot decided that the best place for the westbound onramp from Rosebank, was 500M before the westbound Off-ramp at Te Atatu (on an exit only lane to boot). It could have been put next to the Rosebank/Patiki offramp, 1km further away...  And that's without mentioning the clusterfuck that is the Southern Motorway onramp. (there's nothing safer than having traffic in the middle lane at a standstill, while the lanes on either side are doing 100km/h, then having that queued traffic join another motorway from the outside lane  /s)  All that said, I see a lot more inconsiderate assholes, dangerous driving, and tailgating on the Southern.."

(there's nothing safer than having traffic in the middle lane at a standstill, while the lanes on either side are doing 100km/h, then having that queued traffic join another motorway from the outside lane /s)   I get on the mw at Western Springs and get off at Nelson street, it should be a fair straight forward affair but often the queue for the southern is backed up past the WS onramp, so it is completely clear in my lane except for some turd who has come to a complete stop because they want to neck into the queue for the southern.  Hopefully the tunel/loop will fix some of this, but I bet it wont."

It doesn't happen a lot but every so often I'll get some lunatic cunt who sits comfortably on my bumper waiting to be that morning's nose-to-tail.  Happened a few weeks ago actually, I flashed my brake lights at her a few times and she was reacting really slowly then getting straight back on my arse. I changed lanes and a huge silver SUV who is the fucking hero we need pulled in front of her and proceeded to slow down to 30km/h. She stayed on HIS ass the entire time and didn't even try to pass. It was hilarious."

auckland,3byzrm,kensai11,2,Fri Jul 3 11:19:01 2015 UTC,Got there around 17:30 and there were only two stalls which didn't have crazy queues.

The lines were not too bad at the start and I avoided the crazy ones (Al Brown and the one behind them, I think that was the Ribs and brisket sandwich).   By the time I left around 6 the seats were all full and more people were coming in. The DJ towards the start was okay, didn't find the singer great but not overly offensive.  Overall I thought it was okay, similar to daytime/weekend event they had there last year.  I got:   Hotdog Cheese and Onion Pasty Pull pork slider from the Korean place near the main exit, melted on top with a blowtorch A couple of sweet bagels to take away   Overall I thought it was okay. Not much you can do about big crowds of people. Some of the stalls were perhaps more suited to a quieter weekend market than a ""feed big crowd"" sort of event.  Would security have taken my can of coke if they found it or were they just looking for alcohol?"
auckland,3byzrm,slyall,2,Sat Jul 4 01:03:32 2015 UTC,"I've worked in security before  It would depend on what the policy for the night would be,but generally if its non alcoholic and its unopened you're allowed to bring it in.

auckland,3byzrm,LordJauncey,2,Sat Jul 4 05:36:34 2015 UTC,"A lot depends.  Their first priority is alcohol because due to liquor licenses and such it's illegal.  Their second priority is to promote business and they don't want people bringing stuff in that will take away from sales inside.

So we are 50 out of 75 most expensive.  Then someone took it a step further and rang around to find out how much Heinekens cost. Or perhaps they chatted up someone behind the bar at The Shakespeare (Across the road from NZ Herald offices) and  decided to survey price of bottles of Heineken.  Obviously ppl here prefer locally brewed craft beer right? Here's /u/hughthewineguy's article on Auckland's Top 21 Craft Beer Retailers.

I drive past there in the mornings and theres always an array of horrible looking women sneering at the peasants ie normal people. The smirks, the sneers, and to boot they are all unattractive lol.(to be fair its the sneering etc that makes them unattractive)  It does my head in a bit as Im not even sure they qualify as 'new rich'.

You may want to check out the Peace Foundation, they do unpaid internships. Also as someone else mentioned Amnesty International sometimes offers internships or paid work that you might find rewarding. You will have to plan financially as living in Auckland can be expensive sometimes, but it's manageable if you find a job. I hope you make it out here, it's beautiful on this side of the earth! :)"

Are you looking for sightseeing...or just for being social (ie just not eating another meal alone)?
auckland,3bhryr,NeoPhoneix,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:30:03 2015 UTC,Both! It's always good to get the locals' perspective. :)

I'm proposing that we name either a bar or restaurant where a few people can show up for Thursday after work/dinner and then figure out something social to do after that.  Easiest is probably central/CBD - would that work for you?"
auckland,3bhryr,d-danny,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:30:22 2015 UTC,That would suit me actually. Yes! Count me in. I might be meeting another Redditor during the day. Might get them to come along too. Let me know the deets! I'm apparently staying near Brito mart or something. Should be pretty central.
auckland,3bhdyu,yournoodle,3,Mon Jun 29 06:09:16 2015 UTC,"Hiya  I work in hr so will try give you a couple of tips.   What kind of work are you looking for? Most entry level type jobs aren't usually too concerned about work experience, any work experience is good experience especially when you are studying. Obviously you aren't in as good of a position as someone who has consistently worked, but don't worry its not hopeless at all!   A good place to try can explain your situation is in your cover letter, say something like you were contracting while you were studying so you could build up your skills while still being able to focus on study, but you are now looking to get into permanent work. References normally aren't required until the  end of the process (when they pretty much know they want to hire you) and they are more of a confirmation of what you have put in your cv, so don't worry too much about that. You can explain why you can't give the recent one when the time comes.   Good luck! If you have any other questions feel free to pm me =)"
auckland,3bhdyu,Slimey_tomatoNZ,2,Mon Jun 29 06:40:55 2015 UTC,"Give it a go putting it in your cover letter and keep it brief, don't spend ages explaining why you haven't been working but glance over it and frame it in a positive way. Make sure your cv is formatted correctly, consistent fonts and sizing etc. There's nothing that makes me disregard a cv faster than when it looks like the person has spent no time on it. If someone can't spend an hour or two perfecting their cv and cover letter, especially when they are obviously generic, I tend to think they won't put a lot of effort into their work.  Spend a bit of time reading the adds you are applying for and make sure you use key words from the add in your cover letter. They want accuracy? Tell them you are accurate. Often we get hundreds of applications and normally we don't have time to read every single one in complete detail. I usually skim read for things we have asked for, and if I can see words that relate I will read over everything again more thoroughly. If not, it goes in the no pile.   I don't immediately disregard people with gaps In their employment history, especially if they are studying. My style probably isn't the same as every other recruiter but I'm guessing other people have similar styles =)"
auckland,3bhdyu,Slimey_tomatoNZ,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:06:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put anything about your illness, but if they ask you something about it on your application form you will have to declare it...."
auckland,3bhdyu,Slimey_tomatoNZ,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:22:15 2015 UTC,"I posted this on your r/newzealand thread as well but here goes:  My recommendations would be this:  Put a large list of skills you have, and then describe how you've used those skills in the positions you've had. People who look at CVs are more looking at how experienced you are at the skills they're wanting.  Secondly, I know you don't like the idea of going to WINZ, but they do have a number of amazing programs that will ensure you won't just be sitting on your butt and doing nothing. I'm starting one tomorrow morning actually. The Auckland Chamber of Commerce is a really good way to get into admin roles and they work alongside WINZ.  Thirdly, look for a local work broker. They can work with you and give you a good reference you can put on your CV because, just by talking with you, they can see your passion and understand where you're at.  Finally, If you can find out where you can volunteer in the meantime if you're able. The people you work with while volunteering can scratch your back as you scratch theirs.  Not all of those will be completely helpful to you, but I hope you can take something from that :)"

Try buy clothes from op shops (thrift stores) such as salvation army if you're into it or a shopping mall called dressmart in onehunga 70% off clothes there. Buses,trains can be easily found to there. Wherehouse is like a very small version of Walmart but it can save you money (all this is easy to look up online). For food saving, buy bulk from asian food stores which are around if you ask other students, but the best info would come from other students since they will be in the same boat.

Mentatz on Lorne Street is a great place for general japanese food, like donburis etc. Just speaking from personal experience and lover of Japanese food! Hope this helps"

auckland,3azaeb,naturalborntechie,5,Wed Jun 24 18:24:51 2015 UTC,I believe your landlord should pay any fixed charges of the water bill and you pay the amount for what you use.
auckland,3azaeb,gizzyguy79,3,Wed Jun 24 23:41:12 2015 UTC,"your landlord should get the water bill each month and pass it onto you. we usually bank it into their account and they just pay it but you might have to pay it directly - ask your landlord. we use powershop for our power. according to my husband, it was the cheapest he could find :) and yes sign up asap. internet as well if its not included"
auckland,3azaeb,himynameiswho,2,Wed Jun 24 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"If you're in an apartment, it's possible the water will be included in the body corp that your landlord will pay. Double check with your landlord how the water works in your building - you may not have to pay a water bill at all because it's covered in your rent. For power, go with Powershop. They're easy to sign up with. Take a meter reading on the first day so you get charged the correct amount."
auckland,3azaeb,chocfish,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:53:07 2015 UTC,"You'll have water and power, but you should sign up with someone before you move in.  Once you've moved in you can give the power co. a meter reading (and I can second Powershop, for fuss free account opening and their app is pretty good, you can track your usage etc etc).  Your landlord will either pay the water themselves, or they will get the bill and send it on to you, and you will pay them."
auckland,3azaeb,shimmycat,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:28:03 2015 UTC,"The power will be on when you move in, but you'll need to sign up with a provider within a week or two of moving in or you'll start getting threatening letters.

Phone and internet will likely be disconnected when you move in. Simply pick an ISP and sign up."
auckland,3azaeb,sixincomefigure,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:29:33 2015 UTC,"As others have said, go with Powershop for power. When signing up (if you do it before the 30th of this month) be sure to ask for the 250 NZD signup bonus. If they say no, just insist on it.

auckland,3arp7q,closed_caption,2,Mon Jun 22 23:36:44 2015 UTC,You could talk to some high level coaches but they're more tailored towards competitive archery. Another option would be the beginners course at AAC (Cornwall park) and than negotiate private lessons with one of the coaches that runs the course.   Most places will emphasise the beginners course as super important (which it is) to teach you the basics of the sport and the technique. They therefore often make it a prerequisite to join the club.   I'm not sure who is the head of coaches at AAC at the moment but if you asked them you could maybe negotiate something private.
auckland,3arp7q,levenburger,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:39:11 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good idea. I'll see if I can contact AAC and see if they will put me in contact with their head coach.

I was surrounded by others there for their initial interviews in (in some cases well soiled) t-shirt/shorts/jandels etc.  I also took all the resources I'd take to a regular interview; note-book, pen, bound copy of my C.V. (hard and digital copies) etc...  After my interview my WINZ agent basically said I was way over qualified for any of the positions they usually have on offer so instead of wasting both our time I could use their resources to job hunt if I wanted (I went and checked their listings online for possible leads as well as the usual resources) and I emailed proof of ongoing job hunting/interviews to them. I only had to go back and physically check in every 3 months.   Not sure if this is still the case though...  Edit: - I should've proofed before posting..."
auckland,3ane6v,_-Redacted-_,3,Mon Jun 22 00:25:57 2015 UTC,Had a similar situation after I graduated.  Very much anecdotal but if you show you are actually looking (and having some interviews lined up helps) they don't really bother you too much.
auckland,3ane6v,couchlol,2,Mon Jun 22 05:56:58 2015 UTC,Same here. As long as you tell them you are searching and show them some proof they stay off your back pretty much.

Sometimes, positions can lead to hiring, although it will usually be a lower level. It also helps get into businesses where you can then look for positions as well.

auckland,3ane6v,CapytannHook,2,Mon Jun 22 10:05:20 2015 UTC,"How long it takes has a lot of factors - what field you are in....how many competitors you have...how in-demand is that role...your qualifications and history etc etc.  When you move to a new market (or one where you haven't worked for a while), particularly when you are also considering a change to your field - you may need to drop your expectations slightly with regards to the seniority or level of the job compared to your history.  I would recommend expanding your searches to those which may not be 'ideal', but which would still give you an opportunity to progress towards your ideal role (don't apply at Maccas if you are wanting to do marketing).  2-3 months is normally the longest I would go while holding out for a specific role, before I started to cast a wider net."

I'm working 2 jobs now, neither in my chosen field but am saving up to either do the rounds around the country or jump ship over to Aussie at the end of year.   To me it sounds like you're being a tad too picky.  Get work, even if it's for a day or 2 a week and not really related to what you're good at then devote the rest of your time to finding a job that is ideal for your qualifications. Even getting $200-300 a week will cover food or board for your parents and maybe they'll back off a bit."

Holy shit.   Bro you need to do anything before you get back into the industry youre qualified in.  No ones gonna hire some twat sitting around with his thumb up his ass doing nothing.

auckland,3ane6v,as_above_so_below,11,Sun Jun 21 22:58:00 2015 UTC,While it is good to work while looking. It is not fair on the new job if you join with the intention of leaving in a few weeks. If you know the new job will take 6 or more months to land then it is another story.

auckland,3ane6v,_-Redacted-_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:52:36 2015 UTC,I guess so. There are always jobs out there that need next to 0 experience. Money is money at the end of the day
auckland,3ane6v,Kiwi-vodka,9,Mon Jun 22 00:33:08 2015 UTC,"Professional here whose had to go on the benefit before (I had been out of work for months due to being 'over qualified')   Quoted from my post here. Its not an 'entitlement' mentality. look at it as if you were hiring someone for your own business. you have 2 viable candidates after interviewing 5 people:  Candidate 1 is qualified and currently seeking a job. Any job. rather than going on the benefit. Looks like their a pretty hard worker (you'd need to be to get that degree in 'whatever') and is a nice personable character, perfect for the job. You can see their down on their luck for the time being and admire that they'd rather work anywhere than go on the dole.  Candidate 2: Seems Similar to candidate 1 the only difference is they never went to university or worked in this industry/trade before. The yhave a solid history of performance in other work during the years that Candidate 1 was at uni and they seem just a 'switched on' mentally. really other than the quirks of personality from person to person there's not a lot separating the two candidates.  Except. Candidate 1 is likely to leave as soon as they find better work in their chosen field, Candidate 2 is more likely to stick around as without a qualification or profession they need to get a foot-hold in the job world. And after all both have said they'd rather work than go on the dole.  Meanwhile between the time/costs of advertising for an employee, a few hours here and there interviewing the 5 potential applicants, doing a couple of reference checks on candidates 1 and 2, follow up interviews and the loss of regular business that could have been done in those hours the process has cost you about $5,000 (random number picked out the air for this example, I hope you get the idea though).  If that's your spent time and your business (ultimately your money) spent hiring someone let alone the time its going to take (and hours paid to two people, trainer and trainee), are you gonna go with the 'over qualified but keen' Candidate 1 or the 'not qualified but equally as keen' Candidate 2.    Personally, I'm hiring Candidate 2. As soon as Candidate 1 finds a position in his chosen field hes gonna give notice and your going to incur all those costs again."

Go and check it out that day and you're generally only competing with dealers who don't want to spend a cent more than they need to so you can pick up some real bargains.
auckland,3al684,borkslipa,3,Sun Jun 21 07:42:14 2015 UTC,"We had good experiences with Turners Auctions, although this was a while ago.  They have actions on Wednesday that are $8000 and below.  Needless to say, being an auction, it's buy at your own risk, and you'd be well advised to check them out beforehand, have a mechanic look over them, and give them a quick test drive before the auction starts.  We bought a Legacy for $2000 about 6 years ago. Spent less than $1000 on repairs and maintenance since then, so you can get good deals."

Depending on what you want, most of the houses directly in town are pretty old/cheap/less nice.  Racecourse road, and the roads off it are newer and accordingly nicer. Likewise with any of the newer subdivisions specked around the place. They are all on the periphery of town though.   Spent all of my time living there growing up on a lifestyle block just out of town. Its nice, but small as fuck, and basically anything you want to do is in at least Pukekohe.  Work is limited, the biggest and closest employer is the steel mill, so the majority of people who live there tend to be tradies / semi-skilled."

I've found being honest but civil with them makes it easy to refuse the offer. I like hearing about their group trips as well, they go on some odd retreats hah! I view them as gentle people who see this as a way of making the world a better place.

Book selling is mostly during the day, I see them on Queen St around the Wyndham Street corner. They will sometimes have a bookseller near the singers but usually it's a guy giving away pamphlets rather than the hard sell.  The Bookselling trick I see is they get the book into someone hand and then for money. The person took the book thinking it was free and then is surprised by the request for money, I guess it works often enough to stick with it."
auckland,3adkjr,Lightspeedius,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"I get annoyed by them because they act all like they're spiritual, but when they hit you up on the street and they find out you want to talk spiritual matters rather than buying a book, they turn cold.

auckland,3a1mbi,xsqr,2,Tue Jun 16 14:59:50 2015 UTC,"Hey there, another yank here living in Auckland. Not sure if I am answering what you are looking for, but our working holiday visa with nz is nice bc we have no restrictions on employers we can work for. So, you can really work for anyone. However, if you wanted to stay on board for more than a year you will need to transition to a work visa, which is a little involved. If that interests you, pm me and I would be happy to answer and questions."
auckland,3a1mbi,DemEat,2,Tue Jun 16 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"Well this is good to know because I assumed my potential employers may have been limited, nice to know that's not the case. I was more looking for what kind of jobs are easiest for a working holidayer to find, which ones are horrible, and other general info from those who know a little more"
auckland,3a1mbi,DemEat,2,Tue Jun 16 20:53:07 2015 UTC,"Ah Right. If you have a degree or certification in anything on the skilled shortage list of NZ, you have both an awesome chance of getting a job and also getting a work visa to extend your stay (if that is what you're interested in). Hit up trademe or seek for job openings in the area."

My old landlady made some nasty comments about not wanting Indians because some tenants years ago had made the flat smell of curry. Of course, she was smart enough not to put that on her ads, but you can be damned sure they wouldn't be offered the place. I giggle a little every time my partner and I cook up a nice pungent curry or a kimchi jjigae."

auckland,39yxi1,dangus_eREKTus,9,Tue Jun 16 15:24:26 2015 UTC,"Racism is shitty but on the upside it helps you avoid flatting with jerks right?  I know when I was advertising for a flatmate a few years back for a good price in the CBD, there were a ton of weird people applying who clearly were going to be incompatible. I think I was getting around 30 emails per day, even though I was clear about our interests and age there were a lot of people with clearly nothing in common with us (30+ year old dude applying to my flat at the time only made up of 20yr old girls, etc). Flat hunting is a bummer so best of luck dude!!  My advice would be if you're introverted to be clear about it. There's nothing I like better than flatmates who are quiet, clean, and don't bring their goddamn significant other over to practically squat the place. If you make these clear I would have accepted you on the spot -haha. Sharing your schedule is a plus too especially if you're applying to live with a couple."
auckland,39yxi1,sarahmohawk,6,Tue Jun 16 04:41:52 2015 UTC,seems the listing has been edited folks.
auckland,39yxi1,EndlessOcean,17,Tue Jun 16 08:15:43 2015 UTC,....now op can apply and be rejected.
auckland,39yxi1,Kiwi-vodka,10,Tue Jun 16 00:45:19 2015 UTC,"My mum used to have a silent no Indians rule when she was renting out a flat so yeah, I would say you might be overlooked by a lot of people who don't say anything outright (at least the trademe ad is honest?).   I've also found that people in general are more receptive to you if your name doesn't sound ethnic :/ Good luck mate."
auckland,39yxi1,mewslie,9,Tue Jun 16 00:47:31 2015 UTC,"My old flatmate had the same thing with Indians. She had some pretty bad experiences with Indian men specifically (getting harassed and stalked to pretty insane degrees). I'm perfectly aware of the stereotype of Indian and Arab guys in clubs and town and how they treat girls there (because I've seen it myself). People have the same bad experience over and over with the same race, they're going to start becoming a bit racist in order to stop having those experiences.  They'll usually give you a second look if you come off as personable and a bit more integrated/kiwi I guess. They're just not looking for a huge culture clash...  Saying that, I'm not really excusing what they're doing. My name is Mahmood and I get almost no responses from all flats I've applied to when I use that as my name. If I go by Moody, I magically get a whole bunch of responses. Whether or not it's actually stated on the advert, there's definite racial bias. You can bitch about it all you want, but then you won't have a place to live.  Otherwise, take the lease on a place yourself and discriminate against whatever you feel like discriminating against (dirty dishes and pee on the toilet seat would be my picks. Pee is still pee regardless of whether or not it came from an Indian person)."
auckland,39yxi1,sadmoody,7,Tue Jun 16 00:28:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, I just think that everyone wants a flatmate from Harry Potter, Mad Eye."
auckland,39yxi1,mexicanweasel,3,Tue Jun 16 01:10:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you will get screwed over, they've probably had bad experiences with a few and don't want to try and find a good one. You could always message them and see why they don't want an indian flat mate."

auckland,39yxi1,Kiwi-vodka,5,Mon Jun 15 23:10:56 2015 UTC,It's not like a hotel or public service. It's inviting someone to live in your home. Your own private space.  That's not to say that the listing isn't a little off colour of course.
auckland,39yxi1,Mr-Science-Man,9,Tue Jun 16 00:31:27 2015 UTC,But it's okay when it says Asians or Indians only? Talk about a double standard

auckland,39yxi1,Dead_Rooster,4,Tue Jun 16 00:12:28 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying. A lot of these listings have ""Asian's only"" or ""Indians only"" but when it's the other way around, suddenly it's racist?"
auckland,39yxi1,_DecoyOctopus_,15,Tue Jun 16 00:24:47 2015 UTC,"It's racist both ways around and both should be reported to TradeMe, if it is against their rules."
auckland,39yxi1,Dead_Rooster,8,Tue Jun 16 00:27:08 2015 UTC,Really? Trademe stipulates you have to accept applicants that you would ultimately reject? It's not against the law or human rights to choose who you live with.

auckland,39yxi1,RightWingFanatic,5,Tue Jun 16 01:04:29 2015 UTC,Not everyone is a douchenozzle like Maya and her flatmate.  As a white guy I kinda sucked at the flat interview because I'm tending toward the introvert.  I think introverts tend to fake some social interactions to get by.
auckland,39yxi1,PM_ME_FISHING_QUOTA,9,Tue Jun 16 01:12:25 2015 UTC,There are a few bad apples which have given rise to stereotypes which might influence some - but I wouldn't expect people interviewing a prospective flatmate to have a bias unless you really appear to fit those stereotypes.  People are people - there are racists out there who would actively-avoid anyone who isn't white (and probably even justify things in their mind about it not being about race but about compatible culture or the like) but I don't think it's hugely-widespread.
auckland,39yxi1,Hubris2,18,Tue Jun 16 00:40:43 2015 UTC,Isn't white? Mate there are a tone of Chinese landlords only accepting Chinese.
auckland,39yxi1,as_above_so_below,4,Mon Jun 15 23:22:04 2015 UTC,"Very true, but ironically enough I had a Chinese friend who recently tried flat hunting but was rejected by a landlord who was also Chinese simply on the basis that he didn't speak Mandarin"

auckland,39yxi1,ashuraRen,4,Wed Jun 17 07:16:38 2015 UTC,"There's definitely something to be said about culture compatibility.. I've had bad experiences in the past, more or less because of the culture differences.  Also living with people can be difficult."
auckland,39yxi1,shmuckerz,4,Tue Jun 16 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"When I was looking for a flat I saw quite a few ads that were sort of the opposite, where they were actively seeking Indian flatmates. Ethnic minorities tend to stick together, probably due to cultural similarities making it feel easier to fit in. When I lived with Indian flatmates it seemed that the friends they brought round were almost always Indian too. My current Indian flatmate is the exception.. she seems to only know asians. True story."
auckland,39yxi1,maroondoom,3,Tue Jun 16 07:53:46 2015 UTC,"I'm Indian and I've had no problems. I think if you put forward a non-ethnic name then you get a foot in the door, then from then on you gotta convince the potential flatmates you won't be cooking curry every night and you'll be fine. I've had an Indian flatmate and a Brazilian flatmate who refused to open the windows every time they fried garlic and that pissed me off to no end, the whole house stank. Also calling their relatives and talking loudly in another language at 4am isn't nice either. State you don't do these typical things and you'll get somewhere."
auckland,39yxi1,keyo_,2,Tue Jun 16 09:38:29 2015 UTC,"These are the kind of problems I've had before. Curry spots on my clothes when I've left then to dry. Loud as fuck talking on the phone. Using my TV all day for cricket watching. Not treating my girlfriend like a real person . I'm a risk averse person and would never choose an Indian flatmate after my bad experience. If I see a weird name I ignore it. The Indian culture seems sexist and impolite.  Your tips are spot on though. Maybe I would consider someone if they had an Anglo name, a kiwi accent and a good career."
auckland,39yxi1,Brown_Wizard,3,Tue Jun 16 06:29:07 2015 UTC,"It's a huge hindrance for a half way introverted individual like me who's clean, responsible and wants to leave home.    Over the phone they'd think of me as a 'Brett' or a 'Sam' but when they see me... Oh boy they'd be in for a rude awakening."
auckland,39yxi1,19832526,5,Wed Jun 17 11:44:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have experienced that too though I am not indian.  But when I was flat hunting, I found a few ads that says ""guys only, no girls"" ""only LGBT"" and ""Japanese/thai/chinese only"".  While the ""guys only"" one seems reasonable and they interviewed me anyway even I am a girl (their reasons is all 5 flatmates are guy who is into video game, drinking and car racing and they think girls would hate that) .   One of my former flatmate told me once they he would ignore all the messages if its from Indian because he doesnt like his indian neighbours...  Smell is also one of the main reasons from what I've heard, though I am sure that korean and thai food can be worse..some people are just being retarded."
auckland,39yxi1,airnoone,3,Tue Jun 16 09:07:15 2015 UTC,"From living with Koreans and it's also a matter of the smell itself, which usually isn't that bad (tonnes of kimchi can smell funk tho). The Indian 'spicy' smell a lot like B.O to me (as a kiwi) . Also with Asian food the smell doesn't stick into the upholstery and carpet or come out in through pores.   I'm sure others may have a different opinion but that's what I perceive!"
auckland,39yxi1,EndlessOcean,9,Tue Jun 16 01:32:03 2015 UTC,"I would have loved a flatmate that was introverted and boring. Much easier to live with than someone extrovert and excitable.  That person/lister is a racist cuntbag. What world are we living in where people are literally excluded from something because of their race? Fuck that, it makes my blood boil.  I know plenty of Indian guys who had no trouble finding apartments/houses to rent so keep looking, it's just shameful that people are so blatantly bigoted."
auckland,39yxi1,Lightspeedius,2,Tue Jun 16 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"Being introverted and boring will count against you in some flats. A positive in others.  I have found flat hunting difficult in the past without being Indian. Sometimes it's the time of year, sometimes it's just random luck.  Persevere, good luck!"
auckland,39yxi1,SabinaR,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:57:17 2015 UTC,"I never felt like this. Even I was welcomed everywhere wherever I lived.   My landlord is really very helpful and friendly.

auckland,39yxi1,lionessssss,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:06:21 2015 UTC,I remember when I was flat hunting there were so many listings with Indians only wanting Indian flat-mates and kiwis only wanting kiwi flatties. A lot of people only want to live with their own kind for some reason.

The rule is to prevent passengers from distracting the driver. If you're not driving with obvious signs of distraction then you're unlikely to be pulled over.

auckland,39yks1,fraudo,3,Mon Jun 15 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"I've talked to the NZTA about this specifically.  Their response on this is ""yes you can, but you will have to provide proof to the police if pulled over"". They wouldn't elaborate on what proof you should provide, seeing as most de-facto relationships don't really have any legal proof stipulating the relationship I don't really see how you can provide proof.  You can also take dependents and parents on your restricted as passengers (unlikely your parents won't have a full licence however). And how can you show proof of that? It's not like you will carry your childrens birth certificate with you at all times. It may well be that the police still ticket you but you can challenge the ticket in writing with proof provided later, in regards to partners that you live with, a tenancy agreement might suffice."
auckland,39yks1,My_usrname_of_choice,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:01:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information! I guess the only thing you could prove in this case really is proof that both the driver and the partner have the same residential address.

auckland,39yks1,My_usrname_of_choice,2,Mon Jun 15 23:11:39 2015 UTC,Yes a tenancy agreement would show you both live at the address but it won't say you are a couple.  Its pretty stupid agreed. I was driving around my gf in wellington and Auckland later when we moved up here on a restricted licence and I never got pulled over. So as long as you stick to curfews and don't drive like a moron then I'm sure you will be fine until you get your full licence :o)
auckland,39yks1,Hubris2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:14:25 2015 UTC,Why don't they have their full license anyway?
auckland,39yks1,My_usrname_of_choice,2,Mon Jun 15 21:49:13 2015 UTC,Well my flat mate now has his full licence. I'm also not my flat mate's partner. Just realised how confusing all of that sounds. Just settling an argument!
auckland,39yks1,Hubris2,3,Mon Jun 15 21:55:34 2015 UTC,"You cannot normally carry passengers, unless you have a supervisor with you.  The only passengers you can carry without a supervisor are: - your spouse, or the person you live with as if you were married or with whom you are joined in a civil union. -children who live with you and are under the care of you or your spouse (that is, you or your spouse are their parent or guardian. -your parent or guardian. -relatives who live with you and who are on a social security benefit. -someone you look after as their primary caregiver.     So yes, if you live with your partner, they are allowed to be a passenger. How you would prove this to a police officer is beyond me though"
auckland,39yks1,My_usrname_of_choice,3,Mon Jun 15 22:11:19 2015 UTC,"So a person can drive a people carrier with their spouse, their parent, and 3 kids - while on a restricted license intended to limit distractions for new drivers.  I can see how they decided these exceptions were reasonable, but introducing them means there are holes big enough to drive the aforementioned people carrier through.  ""5 of my friends on the car with me officer?  No sir, we're in a polygamous civil relationship""."

auckland,39yks1,My_usrname_of_choice,2,Tue Jun 16 00:53:40 2015 UTC,How often does someone with their learner's license try drive a bunch of their young friends around causing distraction?  I would imagine that is the specific situation the restriction on learner's license was intended to address - so fairly often.
auckland,39yks1,Hubris2,2,Tue Jun 16 00:56:44 2015 UTC,"Young people with friends disobeying the law are likely to do stupid things.  A family who are obeying the law are not likely to do stupid things.  Distraction is distraction, yes, but you're drawing parallels where they don't exist."
auckland,39yks1,Axist,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:07:40 2015 UTC,So you are saying that having children in the back of a car while driving isn't a distraction?  I'm assuming you don't have children.

auckland,39yks1,eruat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:27:08 2015 UTC,"I believe I did.  You said that a family who are obeying the law, are not likely to do stupid things.  I agree that the cause of the distraction is different, but having kids in the back of a car with the driver responsible is equally-distracting as having friends being silly.  If I were king, I would say that someone who is on a learner's permit and not permitted to drive passengers because their lack of experience is a risk to themselves and the public - is not permitted to drive ANY passengers."
auckland,39yks1,theskudder,2,Tue Jun 16 01:32:31 2015 UTC,How you would prove this to a police officer is beyond me though   If you say you live together they won't bother pushing it I don't think. Too much effort on their part.

Haven't checked the CBD branches if the discount applies   Velvet Burger IMO was also good. I think it was like $8-16 for a burger and chips $4?   Another recommendation is Alis Deli, Up on queen street at the upper area next to a steep slope leading to a wilson carpark.   Good diner, the price is reasonable.

auckland,39xqfr,apwong,8,Mon Jun 15 17:34:06 2015 UTC,"I just moved here from Vancouver, Canada! Auckland's a neat place. Nice scenery in the city and easy to get out into the country. Though the New Zealand life is vastly superior to parts of America (like the South or the Mid-West, etc.), you'll likely not find it ""better"" than life in Seatle. Just...different.   On the plus side   Kiwis are very relaxed and cool with most things. Public health care is better here than in the States, but not as good as in Canada. Also, as I understand it, if you have a good employer in the States, you generally have good health insurance. Getting benefits from employers here is very rare. I work for the university and I only get my salary. When working for a major university in Vancouver I got extended health, dental, vision, etc. Again, natural beauty of the place. Nightlife is quite good, with many options. Though, I'm often surprised to see so few people in any given bar/pub even on ""busy"" nights. Strange. not like that in Vancouver.  Aucklanders complain about how bad their traffic is, but I think that's because they haven't lived in a city with bad traffic. The traffic really isn't too bad here most times.   The cons:   Auckland is mind-numbingly expensive. It's probably alright for a single person with a good job, but if you're moving a family here your standard of living will definitely take a hit. The housing market is likely quite a bit higher than Seattle's - my wife and I make well over $100K and will not be able to afford a house in Auckland. That, and it is normal to pay $10 for a pint of beer when you go out.  Generally, New Zealanders overpay for everything. People say that's because NZ is so remote, etc., but the real reason is because the population here is low, and that there are no close neighbouring countries to compare to, that the conditions for capitalism to actually work are not present.  Most houses are made of ""weatherboard"" (read: cardboard) and are not insulated. They really are nowhere near the quality you would expect in North America. So, even though the Winter here isn't so bad, it feels cold in your house because there is little separating you from the outdoors. I imagine condos and newer houses would be better, but it's something to be aware of since it can drive up your electricity costs dramatically.    So, should you move here? Yes, definitely! Permanently? Maybe not...but it's certainly worth checking out."

Compared to other cities in NZ we're much bigger, much more a city of separate ethnicities and areas. Other nz cities like wellington and chch, seem much more inward looking (like, everyone knows everyone).  Compared to the US city I've lived in (houston, tx) we have less music/performance art, but much more sports, both participating and watching.

I have never been to Seattle but I've been to Scandinavia counties, LA etc.  I think that food here is Auckland is very good, though it's too expensive but there are varieties of food here than anywhere else I've been.  Nightlife here isn't good in my opinion. Wellington is way better.  I love blues, psy rock and electronic music and there are only a few bars I can go .  The rest are just very normal clubs that play trashy dance music.  Though, for just drinking and relaxing, there are a few nice ones in the cbd.  There are cool events here! .

You have to take advantage of this, its one of the huge benefits of living on this lovely island. And goddamn it, you have to head down to the South Island. If you like epic landscapes, the North Island is a little lacking in this regard apart from Mt Doom :) And the people of the South Island are pretty fuckin' great. Food is expensive, however: The quality is pretty good. You'll generally pay Whole Foods Market prices and generally, get that quality. NZ wines are underrated, and are good value. A Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc or Otago Pinot Noir is pretty nom. Kiwis are very easy going, and if you're used to a more formal  culture, this may take getting used to. Also, it's not uncommon to find that people say things in the workplace that in the USA could get you dismissed :) Since I'm from a pretty forthright culture as well, I like it. You'll want to be earning north of NZ$90k if you're going to be living in Auckland and single. If you have a family, it's more comfortable if you're also in the NZ$150k to NZ$200k range, especially if you're going to be purchasing a house. Auckland is most similar to San Francisco in terms of the unaffordability of housing relative to income, for similar reasons.  Most older NZ houses are not that well insulated, so winters are not that great. Newer houses or apartments are generally fine though. If you get an older house, check that it has floor, ceiling & wall insulation along with double glazing if you want it to be comfortable. Quality of Auckland apartments is average to shit though, mostly geared towards foreign student market. However, it never gets really cold here, coldest is usually around 3 or 4 degrees Celsius (40F). Public transport is average to poor, you'll want to have a car. Cars are quite a bit more expensive in NZ than the USA, so you typically want to buy a Japanese domestic market 2nd hand import. Especially if you're keen on outdoor stuff.  While you typically don't get health insurance through employer, insurance is relatively cheap here. Public health care is good (but better in the UK or Canada) -  only generally accessible to residents and citizens though. You'll want insurance so you can go to private providers if you like. To give you an idea, to insure myself and my partner with average coverage runs about $140/month. However, we are young (and healthy). Internet is not that great, welcome to the land of the bandwidth limits. However, if you are in a zone where you can get UFB (100MB fibre), you can get uncapped plans, so you'll want that. Spark has the best infrastructure for Fibre, Snap has great service and are pretty decent as well. It doesn't quite rain as much as Seattle, but it does rain quite a bit, and similarly. Like Seattle, when the day is good (like today, not a cloud in sight), it is very good. When you're here in summer, for the love of god put on high SPF sunscreen whenever you go out. Seriously. I can spend a day in North American sun and only be slightly browner, 30 minutes in NZ summer sun, and I'm painfully red the next day. UV here is off the hook. Nightlife.... Auckland suffers from being widely distributed, and you don't really have a ""happening"" district to speak of. Auckland CBD gets a bit feral Thursday, Friday & Saturday nights. People tend to binge drink a bit here, be ready for shouted abuse and that kind of thing late at night and early hours. There are pockets of nice little bars and pubs here and there, but as a previous poster noted, Wellington is nicer for this, and has more of a tight knit feel.    But you could do worse than Auckland :)"

auckland,39sl0n,Futurama_teacher,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:31:31 2015 UTC,"No, don't! Values only go down with leasehold as the land value is the only thing that increases - which you don't own. Banks generally will only do a 50% mortgage that has to be called in before the next ground rent increase. The ground rent always increases as that is where the value is - which (as stated earlier) you don't own! There are f all buyers for them and when the ground rent is even higher after the next rent review there will be even less buyers for them. I'm a real estate agent and I see the trouble people get into with them all the time. It's really not a good investment at all - especially for someone inexperienced with leasehold tenure."

auckland,39ofm0,yournoodle,6,Sat Jun 13 05:58:08 2015 UTC,"Only reduce your speed if there is a temp sign up.  I took my restricted years ago so dunno if its changed. But I kept a bit under 50 lol and the driving tester didn't mind  if theres no posted sign, just keep your speed bouncing under 50  EDIT - According to the poster down below its changed and you have to reduce your speed regardless"
auckland,39ofm0,CloudSorrow,2,Sat Jun 13 06:00:05 2015 UTC,"Just go with how you feel and use your own judgement. Obviously if there is road works with no posted sign and the road conditions look like you would need to reduce your speed then slow down a bit, otherwise just keep a bit under 50 and you'll be fine as well   all in all. Just look confident. My test was only like 10 minutes or so and was only asked to go to the open road and do a 3 point turn. They will make you do more tests if you're shaky with your driving  also pro tip. When there is a stop sign. Stop completely still before checking. Couple of my friends had failed cause they didn't stop completely"
auckland,39ofm0,CloudSorrow,4,Sat Jun 13 06:02:02 2015 UTC,"Vehicle check is pretty quick 5 mins max.   Stop signs: stop completely, count one - two - three, then when it's clear proceed.  Changing out of you lane of travel to go into the median, check your blind spot.  Indicate in cul-de-sacs like it's a u-turn.  Changing lane or merging to the right, you have to indicate. moving left or merging left you don't have to, but might as well to avoid problems.  At intersections when the line in the centre becomes solid, turn you indicator on then.  If a car has to brake behind you, when you've turned into a road, they can fail you for that."
auckland,39ofm0,ManpunzelsBeard,2,Sat Jun 13 06:04:46 2015 UTC,"I did my test a couple weeks after the giveway rule change, got them mixed up - fail.  If you're ready to drive, you'll be fine. it sounds like you've had lessons and practice so it should be alright"
auckland,39ofm0,ManpunzelsBeard,3,Sat Jun 13 06:10:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, looks like they changed it heaps , Good luck!   I think another tip would be looking at all your mirrors when driving. My driving tester got grumpy at me for not looking at my side mirrors while driving and just looking out the back"
auckland,39ofm0,CloudSorrow,2,Sat Jun 13 06:19:59 2015 UTC,"You don't fail for going too slow, at worst you would lose a point or something if your tester though you were obstructing traffic. Driving safely to the conditions is always a good idea. Speeding does usually result in a fail."
auckland,39ofm0,shard013,2,Sat Jun 13 06:28:52 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, still far less likely than for speeding though. Too slow would be too slow for the conditions, not just for going under the speed limit."
auckland,39ofm0,shard013,2,Sat Jun 13 06:43:56 2015 UTC,I went through temporary roadworks and got pulled up for doing 35km when the sign said 30km. Seriously. Guy was a total dick. Definitely lower your speed to what the sign says

It's generally pretty logical, follow the road rules and you'll be fine.  I remember in my restricted test they asked me to do a 3 point turn and I managed to do a u-turn instead. The guy just got me to do a 3 point turn in another place."
auckland,39ofm0,cynical_genius,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:00:11 2015 UTC,I don't think they'd think every 20 seconds was often enough.
auckland,39ofm0,nouncommittee,2,Sat Jun 13 07:02:07 2015 UTC,"I find the problem with testers/restricted/full tests that they are much harsher on you than what the actual road user rules are.  For instance, my AA instructor guy told me also, around road works you should automatically go to 30 km/h but if there's no temporary signs (http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/roadcode/about-limits/speed-limits.html and http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/roadcode/about-driving/road-works.html) then you are not legally bound to travel at that speed and if a cop pulled you over for doing anything over 30 km/h then you would have a damn good argument to say he can't ticket you if there's no temporary signage.  However it is a good idea around road works to slow to the conditions, there will be workers, cones and machinery that are hazards and if you slow down to drive safely then the tester will see you are driving well. Use common sense basically, regardless if no signs are there.  Remember to check your blind spots, when changing lanes, exiting parks, parking and roundabouts! Good tip is to always do a full 360 check, back left to front left to front right, to  back right, when parking."
auckland,39ofm0,fraudo,2,Sat Jun 13 07:09:28 2015 UTC,"I did my test maybe 1.5 years ago, and there were roadworks around the Meadowlands roundabout. I was slowing down to reach the sign-posted 30km/h speed but the instructor told me to carry on at 50 because there was a guy in a ute right on my tail.   At the start of the test they'll inform you to follow their instruction, so do exactly that. If they don't specify it, then follow the road rules which includes temporary speed signs.   I remember there was a post on Facebook not that long ago that police were sitting around roadworks and ticketing people for not doing 30km/h.  So I would suggest driving exactly to the road rules. All you have to do on the day of your test really is to get the instructor to tick all the boxes on his sheet he has in front of him.   One thing I should mention that I failed on during my first attempt was not indicating when crossing over the center of the road, even if there were no center-line markings. Remember to indicate properly going around roundabouts and watch your speed!   Good luck :)"

auckland,39gsbz,my_point_exactly,13,Thu Jun 11 16:49:45 2015 UTC,"The theory is, the prices are not sustainable because:  The median income is not high enough to pay a median mortgage. An ""affordable"" house costs 3x annual income. In auckland it's 8.3x annual income, nearly 10x on the shore. Incomes need to nearly triple (lol) or prices need to fall by nearly 2/3rds to make this ""normal"". http://www.interest.co.nz/property/house-price-income-multiples  The median rent is not high enough to pay a median mortgage. rental yield is 3.6%, interest rates are around 6.5%. Either rents need to double or prices need to halve to get back to ""normal"" territory. Rents are tied to income (you can only pay what you have, not what you can borrow), and income is flat, so there's not much room for rent to go up - people will just start leaving. http://www.interest.co.nz/property/rent-ratio  My theory is that the aucklanders are justifying paying absurd amounts of money for housing in the assumption that the prices will keep going up. Which, if they do keep going up, is a totally reasonable thing to do. It's far too risky for me, and if the market ""corrects"" to anything like the figures above there will be a lot tears."
auckland,39gsbz,steveh7,3,Thu Jun 11 20:37:11 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind I'm talking purely about prices based on a rational economic measure - which has no real bearing on reality. The market may well keep on going up, it might totally crash, nobody knows."
auckland,39gsbz,steveh7,3,Thu Jun 11 20:41:31 2015 UTC,"I think there's just way too much demand and not enough supply for a ""crash"" to occur.   Growth may slow, but it will likely continue to go up.   House prices here, are comparable to those in Toronto, Canada.  Where it's a large city and available land for new homes is limited."
auckland,39gsbz,ThunderSteaks,2,Thu Jun 11 23:34:42 2015 UTC,"House prices here, are comparable to those in Toronto, Canada. Where it's a large city and available land for new homes is limited.

auckland,39gsbz,tonylee0707,2,Sat Jun 13 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, NZ is not an isolated system.  Prices may be sustainable provided steady inflow of wealthy immigrants who find beauty, nature and position of NZ worth the price tag."
auckland,39gsbz,dlagno,11,Sat Jun 13 21:47:57 2015 UTC,"So, a lot of people saying it will bubble and will crash stems from what happened over in USA.  To put it simply, they were building more houses than the demand required.  So, if you bought a new house for $100,000 (numbers chosen for simplicity).  You assumed it was worth $100,000.  However, since they were building more than they needed, people could always buy a brand new house for $100,000.  Therefore people wanting to sell would have to sell for $90,000, in order to compete against new houses.  Here though is a bit different.   There is a lot of demand and not enough supply; and no way to rapidly increase supply.   Unfortunately Auckland is in a terrible location, with minimal land and lots of hills/valleys, making it harder and more costly to develop land.  My personal opinion is that prices won't go down. They might grow at a smaller rate (2-5%/yr), but won't drastically decrease.   (10,000+ houses can't just pop up overnight)."
auckland,39gsbz,ThunderSteaks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:36:53 2015 UTC,"It depends, I'm sure if enough news gets out of people moving out of Auckland - which I already know a few of which have - then we may see many foreign investors may start scrambling to sell once they realize the costs of property tax top whatever income they would generate from renting out."
auckland,39gsbz,the_grandmysteri,2,Mon Jun 15 09:11:50 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  You would have to have 1000s of people move out of Auckland to have an impact like that.  But where will those people go?  Where in NZ are there that many jobs for people to go and get?  As well the property taxes are so extremely low here that I doubt it would have an impact on investors.  For example. $600,000 house; $480,000 mortgage, has $1500/mth in interest costs; and that same house has $140/mth in property taxes."
auckland,39gsbz,ThunderSteaks,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:22:21 2015 UTC,"True. I think it's mainly the fact that property taxes being so low that people can do this, not to say investing in property is wrong, but there needs to be some serious changes to property taxes"
auckland,39gsbz,the_grandmysteri,2,Mon Jun 15 10:47:46 2015 UTC,I 100% agree!   Property taxes are roughly 25% of what they are in Canada.   Easy way to help fund some public works (specifically transit) would be to raise property taxes 1-3%/year for the next few years.     But suggesting that is likely political suicide.
auckland,39gsbz,ThunderSteaks,3,Mon Jun 15 11:48:23 2015 UTC,"A bubble roughly means that the market is driven by people expecting the prices to increase rather than the income they will get from the property.  So if you paid $1M for something that is only generating $25k of rent per year (2.5% gross return) you are either betting that rents will greatly increase or that your property value will increase.  So long term the prices are unsustainable ( and getting worse at the rate of 10% a year) but ""long term"" could be a few more years and the ""correction"" could be anything from a huge drop overnight to just flat prices for 10 years.  Yeah and it is all one market really so don't believe anyone who says that ""family homes"" are different from ""CBD apartments"". There is plenty of ability to substitute one for the other at the edges."
auckland,39gsbz,slyall,3,Thu Jun 11 20:33:57 2015 UTC,"The bubble could keep bubbling so long as foreign investment money is buying the houses, and nobody knows how long that might be. Could be decades.  Perhaps in 30 years the only people living within 30km of Auckland CBD will be rich foreigners, and families of those who bought in well before now."
auckland,39gsbz,OldWolf2,8,Thu Jun 11 22:03:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a great way to launder your money that you're taking illicitly out of your home country. I suspect this is more of a factor than initially thought."

This is a great article, and points out that it isn't actually foreign investors causing the problem:  ""Eaqub estimates about 8% of the Auckland market are identifiable cash buyers and likely to be foreigners, while investors are 45%. Whenever we have conversations about Auckland, you can’t say it has been driven up by investors. It was foreigners, it was everybody else, but it wasn’t investors.

NZ economy collapses.  The amount of cash settled in houses at the moment is ridiculous.  One of the fundamentals of investing is diversification.  when peoples assets are tied up 80% in real estate, there's a problem.  NZ doesn't have a shining economy right now .. interest rate cuts will tell you that.  Foreign investment dries up.  Demand is hot right now with pathetic attempts at increasing supply.  Less people leaving and record high immigration .. this is the core of the problem.  Supply and demand.  Demand dries up .. kiwis can't afford to pay ridiculous prices .. (I know I sure as hell can't afford a million mortgage). Sudden increase in supply.  Open the floodgates with supply .. take that red tape off and just let people go nuts.   In reality, it's going to take something big to burst the bubble.   And not just a stabilisation of housing prices.  There are many people waiting to pounce on any sign of weakness  (myself included).. which just goes to show that it's going to take a hell of a lot."

auckland,39fhiy,redicine,2,Sat Jun 13 05:09:43 2015 UTC,I will never understand why stuff like this gets downvoted. What is the bloody subreddit meant to be for if not asking questions about Auckland and stuff going on here... goodness.
auckland,39fhiy,redicine,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:25:12 2015 UTC,"Same - at Digital Nationz? I'm looking forward to it becoming more mainstream as a gaming device. Along with the Virtuix Omni, gaming looks like it's gonna go to pretty awesome levels."
auckland,39eeob,random6654,3,Thu Jun 11 04:33:41 2015 UTC,"might be the wrong time of year, could be that you're asking too much.. i know it hurts but try lowering the price by a grand... the general idea when selling a used car is to start with what you paid for it, then half it, then add an amount for things that are of note..  example:   you paid 10 grand for it from a dealership x amount of years ago start with 5 grand as a base price was it regularly serviced (add 500) have you recently replaced the timing belt/waterpump (add 500) low kms? (add 500)   etc... unless the car is a popular model, collectible classic, known car of the year type you'll never get what you want for it... selling cars is more like a lesson in punishment, how low are you willing to go and how long are you willing to suffer the process.  another option if you dont need the money right away and have another mode of transport.. is Park and sell... there are lots all over the city just google park'n'sell or park and sell...or similar and look at their terms... another option is to look around and use your car as a trade in..(if that's what you're doing..upgrading) find a lot with a car you want that will have minimum trade in value.. in which case you'll still get reamed but at least its gone...  another option (I'm not even sure they still do this) is a car fair.. i bought my second car many years ago from a car fair held at Ellerslie racecourse on Sundays... you should look into those.. you just take your car all cleaned up to the grounds early on Sunday and park in a value group (under 5k, 5-10k,10-20k,over 20k) you stand/sit next to your car and answer and questions as people walk past...kick the tires... like i said i don't know if they still do this...  Good Luck..."
auckland,39eeob,DinaDinaDinaBatman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:33:56 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the tips! Yeah i have realised im going to have to start reducing the price :/ Im actually going overseas so can't really do a trade in. I will definitely look into the park and sell and whether there are still car fairs that i could go to.
auckland,39eeob,Kristiejoy,2,Thu Jun 11 09:10:11 2015 UTC,I struggled to sell both of my cars on there an they were both in great condition. If you're buying a new vehicle it might be best to go to a dealer and do a trade in?

auckland,39cv78,soultrack23,5,Wed Jun 10 22:25:51 2015 UTC,out of curiosity what vinyl are you selling?
auckland,39cv78,Dildofaghands,3,Thu Jun 11 01:04:54 2015 UTC,"Seconded, would be keen to hear what you're selling."
auckland,39cv78,Salphine,7,Thu Jun 11 02:24:45 2015 UTC,A significant mark up. Which isn't all that unfair considering most CDs are going to sit on the shelf for decades. Don't expect to get an amazing deal but know it's likely the best deal your gonna get without selling them individually yourself.
auckland,39cv78,Timzor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:30:14 2015 UTC,"Cheers - Yeah I figured. I'm probably going to be getting rid of vinyl mostly, and hopefully not bargain-bin level stuff either."

Since it's usually pretty poor for those type of things I never thought making the trip would be worth the effort. Trade me selling always worked out better. I guess the CD market on Trademe is shitty though."
auckland,39cv78,robinsonick,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:46:29 2015 UTC,"I know EB Games payouts are terrible, but I was particularly curious about RG with respect to records. For anything semi-popular or a little rare they seem to have a reasonably quick turnover. (Compared to say, a bunch of NSYNC CDs, or Need For Speed Playstation games.)"
auckland,39cv78,SickNoteNZ,2,Wed Jun 10 23:55:52 2015 UTC,"Last time I went to Real Groovy to sell stuff they took the time to find the prices on TradeMe for them and gave me 80% of TradeMe value or $2.50, whichever was the lesser. These were for special interest Christian CDs (Stan Walker, halfnoise, MaliMali etc.)"

auckland,39dhyc,pictureofacat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:20:28 2015 UTC,Don't think so. Different livery and the model looks more like what NZ Bus use.
auckland,397vpu,itsbradsworld,12,Tue Jun 9 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"I hope they find a decent new location, one of my favourite things to do if I have a couple of hours to spare is lose myself in their vinyl section."
auckland,397vpu,Betamax-Bandit,5,Tue Jun 9 23:38:15 2015 UTC,"K'Rd would suit them, but I'm guessing rent would be higher than Upper Queen."
auckland,397vpu,pictureofacat,7,Tue Jun 9 23:57:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like Krd in 5 years will look like Ponsonby road, and they will just have to move again as their rent increases beyond what they can afford."
auckland,397vpu,Betamax-Bandit,0,Wed Jun 10 00:18:54 2015 UTC,"""upper"" (regular) Queen St."
auckland,397vpu,couchlol,0,Wed Jun 10 05:15:24 2015 UTC,"An errant capital, although it isn't uncommon to see the area beyond Mayoral Dr referred to as that. It's like the section of Queen St that Auckland Council have long forgotten about."
auckland,397vpu,pictureofacat,-1,Wed Jun 10 09:04:03 2015 UTC,It would take time to build the apartment block & RG will want to keep open during that time.
auckland,397vpu,garscow,6,Wed Jun 10 09:11:52 2015 UTC,"That building has nostalgia value, sure, but boy is it a shitheap. Real Groovy are still going strong, stronger than ever due to the massive amount of Vinyl I purchase from them. I hope they find an awesome new location (perhaps with some decent parking maybe?) and I will keep on coming back."
auckland,397vpu,Mitch_NZ,3,Wed Jun 10 13:06:42 2015 UTC,"That's a shame. End of an era. Still, CD/DVD/vinyl business probably isn't big enough to justify such a huge premises. I wonder how much they are selling it for.    I wonder if the Council could or should do something to stop the cbd turning from the ""city of sails"" into ""the city of soulless apartment blocks"""
auckland,397vpu,Tabdelineated,3,Wed Jun 10 06:07:34 2015 UTC,"I hope so, because it's looking like that area north of Mayoral Drive is going to be pummelled by the things."
auckland,397vpu,pictureofacat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:12:45 2015 UTC,"Are you are suggesting we need some apartment blocks with a different design than at present?  The city desperately needs more housing and higher-density housing - particularly within the CBD.  London UK is not known as the ""city of row housing"", although it probably has 2000x the number of multi-family dwellings as does Auckland."
auckland,397vpu,Hubris2,3,Tue Jun 9 23:30:27 2015 UTC,"Not at all. We desperately need more high density housing, but if we aren't careful I think we'll find too late that big sections of the cbd are featureless ghettos. And the real groovy building has a lot of character."
auckland,397vpu,Tabdelineated,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:55:00 2015 UTC,Plenty of fancy non shoebox apartments going up alll over the place. But the one that will replace RG is a shitter.
auckland,397vpu,Timzor,0,Wed Jun 10 01:23:27 2015 UTC,"I won't disagree - however the more 'interesting' an apartment block/high rise is, the longer it generally takes to bring to completion and often the more expensive the result.  If it takes 10 years to go from buying a piece of land until you have a 'cool' 20 story apartment tower - that is still 10 years until we address our housing woes.  I agree - the debate between 'quick fix' and 'doing things right' is not an easy one."
auckland,397vpu,Hubris2,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:40:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, intensification is welcome, but different designs are a must to prevent that stretch of Queen St being overrun with structures resembling that heinous Volt block on the Mayoral Drive/Queen intersection. That area is already devoid of personality, and adding crap like this Queens Square complex is only going to make it worse."
auckland,397vpu,pictureofacat,3,Wed Jun 10 04:07:49 2015 UTC,"I remember when Real Groovy was in Ponsonby, and my father visited it with me in tow. I first started shopping at the store when it was further up Queen Street, in a building that has now been demolished. The neon sign used to be outside on the corner of the old Queen St shop.  I am sure they will find a new space."
auckland,397vpu,nicbrown,2,Wed Jun 10 01:45:02 2015 UTC,"This is a bit upsetting, ive always loved that Real Groovy building and i think that it ads as much character to the building as the staff do."

auckland,394z3s,tinypip,2,Tue Jun 9 09:34:47 2015 UTC,part of it is because heaps of the pretty stuff is outside of the city :( piha wasn't included for example

auckland,394z3s,Dead_Rooster,2,Tue Jun 9 19:42:07 2015 UTC,Just curious but how was the immigration process and are you moving with an employer awaiting you?
auckland,394z3s,dangus_eREKTus,3,Tue Jun 9 23:35:00 2015 UTC,"Immigration couldn't have been easy. Since the US and NZ have a peace treaty, trade agreements, and a defense pact it's almost as easy entering and exiting the country for Americans as it is the British or Aussies. I do not have an employer lined up but I am a programmer and can take contracts from anywhere in the world. As for the actual process, I simply filled out an online form, proved my identity and was award a work visa all within 3 weeks."

It's not too bad, though the roads are far narrower, and the bike lanes less consistent, than in my home and native land, Canada, and this can be a bit off-puting for many cyclists. The upshot is that it saves buttloads (heaps) of time off the commute, especially since traffic filtering (cutting through traffic) is a thing here. Have fun on your commute!"

Total: slightly more than 1 hr.  If I drive, 1 - 1.5 hrs at rush hours (7:00 am - 9:30 am; 3:30 pm - 6:00 pm), ~45 min at shoulder hours, and then ~30 min at non-peak times (8:00 pm - 6:00 am). In the morning, the stretches from Papakura to Manukau, from Panmure to New Market and then in the city centre (off the motorway) are the most congested.

I also have itchy eyes a lot, and sniffles. Although I have asthma, I have not needed any medication for it for a long time before I came to Auckland - now I use my Ventolin almost every day. I've heard dehumidifiers can help with the mould and moisture, but I don't have one myself. I try and keep the place well ventilated, and I bought some Damp Rid, which helps a little.   ETA: The place I lived in last year had mould on the ceiling in the bedroom, and in the carpet. And on the windowsills, and on the furniture. It was horrible. Now I live in a place with little visible mould, but it's also recently been repainted, and I can smell the damp, so I'm sure it won't be long. Trying to find a mould-free house in Auckland is an uphill battle."

auckland,38n7so,thevagabondpursuit,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:39:42 2015 UTC,High humidity inside the home is bad for asthmatics.  You need a high capacitor dehumidifier like the biggest Panasonic unit to deal with a whole house. Small dehumidifiers are only good for a single room.  An air filter may help with asthma. Some new heat pumps like those from Daikin and Panasonic have advanced built in air filters. Or you can buy a standalone air filter from Daikin

auckland,38n7so,aphrael,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:52:28 2015 UTC,"you need to remove the mold from your room, then you need to use either a dehumidifier or something like damprid. The most important thing for you to do each day is to open up all your windows so that light and outside air can flow into your room. This will help to get rid of moisture and the light helps to stop mold growing."

If you do a dollar reserve, it's probably worth splashing out on the 25c to get a 10 day listing so at least there is more chance of someone who may actually need that particular model finds it.   Make sure you put all the relevant model details in the title, so if someone is searching that particular model they will find it."

I got shitty internet so I had to write that on phone and my friend was so confused and shocked that he was unable to give me proper info.  Here is information I got from him  ""The police took the liberty to share some information: there were 4 juveniles involved, of which one was the driver and 'at least one of the others' broke the windows and started throwing objects towards the chasing police cars. However, there is no footage so we can't identify which one was the driver, and which people threw objects.  After a while the police spiked the tires, not enough to stop these juveniles as they drove another whopping 15 minutes on the rims.   For some fireworks to end this adventure they smashed my car into TWO police cars(!!!!)  They will likely end up with a warning and not paying back anything because: A) they're juvenile B) police can't find out who did what (hence they're all innocent?!) C) they don't have work D) we can't make them work"""

auckland,38b8b6,DinaDinaDinaBatman,7,Wed Jun 3 11:33:37 2015 UTC,"exactly, this is the main reason you do auto checks 35 bucks aint looking too expensive now is it?,   when i was looking for a car to buy i found one on trademe, went across town to look at it, was about to buy it the next day, had the money in hand ($5500) thought...""i better check this out, something doesn't feel right""  did an autocheck, found out that the current owner not only had to have mechanical work done to repair something major (that he didn't pay the mechanic for) that he also had finance from instant finance to buy the car, AND had listed the car as collateral for another loan from a different finance company..  it kinda pissed me off that i drove to the other side of town, paid for this check and came out without a car but i'm glad i didn't buy the car, it would have been repo'ed... they should totally make those online auto checks free or part of the cost to sell your car on trademe... no more bullshit.  TL:DR some people are dodgy when they get themselves into debt."
auckland,38b8b6,slippersnz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:15:16 2015 UTC,You're kind of lucky by the sounds of it....because from what you have said. It sounds to me like your friend purchased a car (cash) that was either still on finance or was used as security for a personal loan.....? Is that right?  And therefore if that is the case then irrespective of the vehicle being insured - You don't own it because the sale was unlawful and the transfer of ownership would not have been approved.  ...Therefore the person who sold your friend the car is liable to refund the $3000.........Tell him to go back to the previous owner and get his money back.
auckland,38b8b6,COCK_SOFTLY,0,Wed Jun 3 06:55:27 2015 UTC,"Tell your friend to go to a Community Law Centre for advice. There are lots of things you can do, but the specific approach depends on the complete set of facts. For example, if the original owner didn't alert the police that the car was stolen, and your friend checked this, then a referee in the Disputes Tribunal will likely split the losses between you and the original owner or completely rule in his favour.  If your friend paid cash for a car and didn't do anything to register it in his name though, he'll probably have to recover the $3000 off the person who sold it to him."

Maybe it would be a lot of work, but if I could see evidence of my 'donation' being used how they describe I'd probably do it more often.  On that note, does anyone know of anything like this where I can be a lot more directly involved in the process of a donation?  I've taken a look at volunteer type websites but they are a lot more demanding and expect a long term commitment of some kind.

auckland,385m9c,kopkiwi,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:32:37 2015 UTC,This is why i asked for advice! Lol picking fruit seems like an easy job to start. Thanks for the input! Im looking about a year into the future so ive got plenty of time to choose a location.
auckland,385m9c,Sandunen,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:34:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely avoid Auckland if you can, from a living perspective. Great for a trip, but the cost of living and commuting will pretty much ruin your year long experience.  If fruit picking is the name of your game then the Hawkes Bay is where you want to be playing. Beautiful weather and an easy drive to a lot of tourist destinations."

It's colder outside in Michigan during the winter, but it's colder inside in Auckland because the houses lack central heating, use single-pane glass, and have little or no insulation.  You're expected to sleep with a hot water bottle warming your bed.  It's worse further south, though, where the locals are unsurprised to see their breath indoors."

auckland,385m9c,12happycamper,2,Thu Jun 11 19:53:39 2015 UTC,"I second the comments about housing being a major issue.  Also, have a job secured before you arrive, or at least a work visa. Most places will not even look at an application if work visa is pending.   Start by not having a car so you know the public transport system, but sooner or later you'll realize a car is essential. To search for secondhand cars, look to carfair.co.nz.  Two other websites I've found useful for Auckland is seek.co.nz for jobs and trademe.co.nz for pretty much everything else."
auckland,385lyw,flamingo44,4,Tue Jun 2 00:43:55 2015 UTC,As long as it's sunny I like the Matakana Sunday market or (if it doesn't happen to be a Sunday) go to the Brickbay Sculpture Trail (http://www.brickbaysculpture.co.nz/) which is just a tiny bit further than Matakana village.

auckland,3850qn,sheepshagger1994,4,Mon Jun 1 22:16:03 2015 UTC,Might pay to park at a different stop and take the train from there.  There is a train station in Panmure (5 minute drive from Sylvia Park) which has a large parking lot which is free to park in. The Panmure train goes to Sylvia Park on it's first stop so you'd only add 5 minutes (if that) onto your train trip.
auckland,3850qn,LuckyCharmer,2,Mon Jun 1 23:32:34 2015 UTC,Yeah Panmure is my other option. I'll be staying in botany so its actually closer than Sylvia park
auckland,3850qn,Pugcow,2,Tue Jun 2 00:37:25 2015 UTC,Just be aware that the carpark at Panmure gets full pretty early and then people start parking up Mountain Road so either get there early or be prepared for a walk down to the station.
auckland,3850qn,eruat,2,Fri Jun 5 09:18:04 2015 UTC,There's deliberately no parking for people using the train. Came up in The Herald a week or two ago. Will find the link. Personally would go for Panmure =)
auckland,3850qn,eruat,3,Tue Jun 2 00:51:58 2015 UTC,"While there might seem to be plenty of car parking around Sylvia Park Station, it is all on privately owned land and is for the use of customers of the Sylvia Park shopping centre and their employees.  The motorway and Mount Wellington Highway are highly congested in peak periods and Auckland Transport tries to avoid encouraging Park & Ride at train stations in environments such as this. Car drivers accessing the train here would add to the congestion on the surrounding roads when AT is trying to provide public transport services that relieve congestion.  The New Network for bus services in this part of Auckland will be the subject of a public consultation exercise later this year. It will propose better bus services to and from Sylvia Park, with the aim of encouraging more bus-train commuting through this station.  source"

Just getting an estimate off Reddit is unlikely to work for your location and your room requirements.   You will probably also need to save up 4 or 5x that amount for bond and rent in advance.   Weekly expenses: Add in 15-25 (depending on what the house consumes/number of people) for expenses each week, and your food costs will vary (can go from 30-100 for one person quite easily).   Moving out is fantastic and you become your own person. Highly recommend."

I know you can rent a apartment for under $300 but its shit. I don't see how anyone would want to live in a shoebox lol. Unless you're out all the time and just need a apartment to sleep in.  if its the CBD you want to live in. Use the ball park figure of $500 a week and work out how much you would have for your own spending, internet, food etc from your yearly income.  If your financial situation isn't great then I would suggest living at home till you have enough to pay for all the expenses. It would suck having your pay check pay more than half of your expenses and nothing left over for personal use"
auckland,37zvlj,thevagabondpursuit,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:15:05 2015 UTC,"Suggest checking trademe as it's a pretty variable question. Depends on how nice a place you want, you're going to get answers from both ends of the scale.   Also I would factor in if you have a car and where you work. Car spots are a pain in the a** in the CBD, so I would stick to near central. However if you are working in the CBD than paying extra for the car spot probably offsets public transport/convenience.   For a mid range place in the CBD with 1 or 2 other people you're looking at around $200-250 per week for rent."

auckland,37kl66,chelseameowmeow,8,Thu May 28 08:49:01 2015 UTC,"SAS training? Not sure if that's why, and probably never confirmed, but they've done that before."
auckland,37kl66,PhelanKell,3,Thu May 28 09:07:31 2015 UTC,"Likely to be SAS training. One year when I lived in an apartment they were training - one helicopter landed on the ASB roof while another hovered back, navigation lights off. The noise of the Huey's rotors reverberated around the apartment complex in complete darkness, very imposing"
auckland,37kl66,Zoltuger,3,Thu May 28 09:16:45 2015 UTC,There is an off coloured window on the BNZ tower that is removed so they can helicopter in and practice abseiling and entry.
auckland,37kl66,nicbrown,1 point,Thu May 28 22:07:23 2015 UTC,"yeah i think one landed, whilst 2 others hovered near, and there was 1 more circling around at distance with lights off apart from red blinker. going over vic park, right around the tower in a huge loop."
auckland,37kl66,-benjami,1 point,Thu May 28 09:19:14 2015 UTC,Possibly a Special Tactics Group anti-terror training operation?
auckland,37kl66,1210M3D,19,Thu May 28 09:15:28 2015 UTC,"considering the response level of the police in that hammer attack the other day, where they shut down a road, had more than 20 cop cars, stg, k9s, road blocks with m4 bushmaster rifles, tactical stg quick response vehicle, helicopter over watch.... I'd say it was something like a kid was found downloading the latest fast and furious movie so special forces were sent in."

auckland,37kl66,KiwiSLT,25,Thu May 28 09:58:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, so maybe someone important is there too."
auckland,37kl66,HerbertMcSherbert,4,Thu May 28 11:21:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, SAS training. Can't find it right now but they notify of it beforehand in the NZ Herald classifieds section (they're legally required to notify, and probably figure no one will see it there)."
auckland,37kl66,intelligentrogue,2,Thu May 28 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"so the ad heralded the arrival of the SAS... yep, publication name checks out."

auckland,37jnd1,nilnz,8,Thu May 28 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"I work near here too and I went in to look at the menu, nothing exciting. Didn't see anything about free coffee though.  The cafe next door 'giving away' free muffins is Hollywood. You have to buy a coffee to get one of their free dry muffins."
auckland,37jnd1,acid-nz,2,Thu May 28 03:19:45 2015 UTC,I don't know anywhere in Auckland that makes a decent muffin. Everyone makes mini-cakes. A muffin is not a mini-cake. A muffin has a different texture and taste to cake.
auckland,37jnd1,Lightspeedius,5,Thu May 28 04:25:29 2015 UTC,I've had decent muffin or two on k road.... cough.
auckland,37jnd1,acid-nz,1 point,Thu May 28 04:33:34 2015 UTC,Try Hinemoa Street Organic Cafe in Birkenhead on the Shore. They do pretty decent muffins and they're not cakey. I had a really nice blueberry and cream cheese one from there :)

There was a young waitress and two older Asian people who I assumed were the owners, no one said anything and just stared at me, it was kinda awkward."

The coffee is fantastic, and the staff are doing their best to get to know people. Pluck up the courage to steer clear of your usual coffee joint and give this place a shot!"
auckland,37jnd1,Hannahmcdowell,1 point,Thu May 28 06:29:03 2015 UTC,New cafe hoping to attract new customers by offering free coffee. Apparently cafe next door was giving away free muffins.  Their Roma coffee supplier suggested the free coffee.   So has anyone in here tried it? Are the queues long? Is the coffee good? Is there really no catch?  Any other cafes in auckland offering free coffee or free muffin?
auckland,37jnd1,pillihp,1 point,Thu May 28 02:49:33 2015 UTC,I work nearby and walk past it often - there never seems to be many people in there and I've not yet tried it because I assumed there was some sort of buy x get a free coffee type catch and all I want is a coffee.
auckland,37jnd1,Hannahmcdowell,1 point,Thu May 28 03:17:10 2015 UTC,"Its all good, I've had it twice this week...!"
auckland,37jnd1,slyall,1 point,Thu May 28 07:14:50 2015 UTC,"The Hollywood cafe in Dominion Road often gives away a free muffin with every coffee, at least on weekends which is the only time I'm around there."
auckland,37jnd1,slyall,1 point,Thu May 28 23:52:33 2015 UTC,I got the free coffee a couple of days ago. Tasted okay. Interior and food look slightly better than average but nothing special.   There were a couple of people eating in an someone else bought some food while I was waiting for my coffee.

auckland,37fze3,AdrianwithaW,4,Wed May 27 10:27:04 2015 UTC,"We moved to waiheke 5 years ago, still absolutely love it.   It's not for everyone, there's some people who come here for a few years and decide island life isn't for them, but generally people are really positive about the place. It's the only place I've ever lived where the standard introductory small talk when you meet someone is about how amazing the area is.  Pros: Beaches, boating, kayaking etc all great.  Restaurants, vineyards  Community - very strong, sense of we're ask in this together. Easy to make friends, you see the same people popping up. Commute -  is great if you work in the cbd, a drag otherwise.  Cons: No nightlife No city amenities you might have got used too, food delivery etc. Not much to do if it's raining.  All in all, I think most people here feel lucky to live here, I know we do. Best place I've lived by a huge margin. You have to expect and like ruralish living, but if that's doesn't phase you you'll probably love it."
auckland,37fze3,Alfiegerner,1 point,Wed May 27 10:50:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much! Very interesting to hear. Do you mind if I ask whether you bought a property there or are/were renting?  I wouldn't say I have much desire for the ""ruralish life"" so that certainly makes me wonder. You make it sound great though, thanks again!"
auckland,37fze3,Alfiegerner,2,Wed May 27 10:56:50 2015 UTC,"We rented for the first 2 years, owned for the last three.  Yeah I think the ruralish bit takes people by surprise, and accounts for most people who leave within the first few years.    I'd recommend getting a self contained apartment and coming over for a week with a car to see how you get on.  The good thing about commuting is that you still get a taste of city life, do drinks and shopping in town, so you don't have to completely give it up. Living on the island 24/7/365 would be a bit much."
auckland,37fze3,quickreactor,2,Wed May 27 11:06:08 2015 UTC,What's the internet like?
auckland,37fze3,meal-mate,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:01:56 2015 UTC,Yeah great question! Just spent the long weekend their and the internet at the house we were at was pretty flakey. Not sure what plan it was intended to be.  I see they're slated for UFB this time next year though.
auckland,37fze3,gtphanta,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:32:28 2015 UTC,You have to use Spark as they are the only ISP with decent cabinets on the island. They are actually faster than my place in the city which is on Slingshot. I hate Telescum but if you want decent Internet on Waiheke you have to use Spark.
auckland,37fze3,travelling-grump,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:13:03 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at Waiheke, and whilst I work within walking distance of the Ferry Terminal, the challenge I have is needing a car for work appointments or visiting friends/family all over the place. Any suggestions on how one could solve this?"
auckland,37fze3,thevagabondpursuit,1 point,Thu May 28 02:53:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a concern for me also.  A colleague at a previous job had a permanent spot at the downtown carpark, their car lived there overnight as they had frequent use of a car in town. I think they just considered it part of the cost of living on Waiheke, and from what I understand it wasn't really that expensive if you considered the cost alongside the likes of you rent/mortgage."
auckland,37fd9c,Kiwi_Nibbler,6,Wed May 27 05:38:28 2015 UTC,"If they download popular recent music then they might attract some attention, but nobody has been prosecuted for downloading TV or movies yet.  Even in a worst-case scenario, they get two warning notices before they're in trouble, so they have plenty of time to change.  What I would suggest is that they subscribe to a Usenet service like TweakNews to ensure high download speeds, as torrents can be slow sometimes and are more likely to be tracked."
auckland,37fd9c,logantauranga,2,Wed May 27 06:01:19 2015 UTC,"Your pretty safe using anything tbh, any generic torrent site like TPB etc.  The issue is what source your getting, always look for anything thats out well before the sceners are out or from anyone that really doesn't have a rep or old account.  Just grab the most popular download with decent seeds and your sweet. Obviously be smart about it.  Ensure stuff isn't seeding when it's finished (unless it's a bitch to get, sharing is caring, but no so much in NZ as ours speeds are shit)  Other then that, can use private DC hubs or torrent sites if you get invited."
auckland,37fd9c,nzkfc,2,Wed May 27 06:53:01 2015 UTC,"I recommend Tunnel Bear.  It is about 5 dollars a month, the user interface is a breeze, and you have a list of a dozen or so countries you can choose to connect through."

auckland,373d4b,paulfknwalsh,3,Sun May 24 21:30:39 2015 UTC,"Transit is good not great. I'm not terribly familiar. Certainly it runs more often on weekdays.   There is a tour bus that essentially shuttles you between most of the sights I mentioned and some others. It's $45 for adult 1 day $75 for 2 day. Free for under 4. I haven't used it but it certainly would be convenient if costly solution.   The city link bus service is a cheap and easy way to get around downtown (runs between silo park and k road) every 7-8 minutes during the day.   The other link buses can be useful , depending on your destination. The essentially go in big circles around the city starting at britomart.  One more thing I forgot. if you do hit Kelly Tarleton, its a short bus trip to Mission Bay with decent food, great playground and nice beach."

Speaking of farms, Ambury Farm is a short drive out of town, it's a Council-owned farm that you can wander through; friendly goat and sheep, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, pigs, peacocks, etc. Nothing amazing, but pretty fun.   And like others said,  Kelly Tarlton's, it's my favourite.."
auckland,372nos,BrotherOfBrother,7,Sun May 24 08:03:02 2015 UTC,A lot of Redditors meet at Fort Street Union and Brew on Quay on Friday nights. They range from 18 - 45.  I'm not qualified enough to tell you about good dance places but I do like Bungalow 8 and Carpark. Globe and Waterfront are rubbish - don't even bother going there.  I've heard Ponsonby is nicer.

I'd make it clear upfront that I wasn't after a hook up and I never once had a guy complain or anything. I think it's silly how many people shit on Tinder or its users because it really did help my social life out a lot. Not everyone is after sex, and I met a lot of guys who were keen to just grab a beer and play pool and chat about this or that with no expectations."

auckland,372nos,bellla98,2,Mon May 25 06:22:59 2015 UTC,"Funny, because I've made moves on male friends before who have complimented my appearance and been rejected because ""it would be weird"".

auckland,371moo,girl-brush,10,Sun May 24 00:47:12 2015 UTC,"Congratulations.  Fortunately champagne goes with just about everything because of its cleansing nature, very similar to beer. And you're absolutely right seafood and cheese are a great place to start. There aren't too many rules when it comes to food and wine matching. And usually the rules that do exist on the subject, are shit rules. Don't be afraid to just experiment. Most enjoyment of food and wine comes from context. Your mood, the people you're with, the setting etc. You can have a shit wine in great company and it will be amazing. Likewise a good wine in bad company is a waste.   Anyway I'll stop ranting and give you some suggestions:  If I was going to a BYO I'd go Chinese and order a whole snapper. They're often cooked with a range of fresh and fermented things that will both reflect and contrast the nature of champagne. It's also a really fun and social way to eat. Maybe grab a plate of spicy squid and some greens too.   Cheese: Grab a few fresh baguettes and three good cheeses, fresh grapes and some butter. I'd get goat cheese, a brie or similar and a hard\sharp cheddar or a good salty Parmesan. And eat them roughly in that order, from lightest to strongest. Use the wine to cleanse your palate in conjunction with the grapes.   Do a pork roast with sauerkraut and crackling. And spuds and gravy of course. I'd also include mustard or horseradish. The champagne will cut through the fat and bring out all of the sharpness of the cabbage and horseradish. you might find the champagne also takes on a pleasant yeasty character.  (This would work with a chook too.)  You could just order a fish and chips (somewhere decent obviously). Get a range of fried fish and oysters and all that good shit. Make your own tartare sauce and side salad to jazz it up a bit and get a bit of variety and freshness into the meal. Then have some malt vinegar and good fresh lemons on hand. Again, the champagne will cut through the fat and bring out the flavour of the pickles in the tartare and acidity of the lemon and vinegar. Another fun and unpretentious way to get rid of a bottle of fine french plonk.   So in conclusion most of the things I've suggested have a pickled, fermented, aged or yeasty element. Different enough to give contrast but similar enough to not be jarring or mask the nuance of the wine. But at the end of the day you could probably drink Moet with a box of KFC and enjoy it, if you're in the right frame of mind and in good company. (actually champagne and wicked wings sounds pretty good)"
auckland,371moo,My_usrname_of_choice,2,Sun May 24 02:50:30 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! Fancy fish and chips actually sounds wonderful. NOW - where are the best fish and chips?
auckland,371moo,somebodyalwaysknows,3,Sun May 24 05:39:33 2015 UTC,Depends of where you live really. There's one on Sandringham road that's pretty good called The Fish and Chip Shop.   You might have to ask around for the best in you area. F n C doesn't hold up so well on long car journeys.

auckland,371moo,Bezerkcunt,2,Sun May 24 01:37:20 2015 UTC,"Seafood is a great option, or otherwise white meat. Lobster would be great, or sushi, sashimi. Some foods with a little more salt can be preferred. Have a look at Zomato and Heart of the City website for possible BYO's. Other than that, the best food comes down to your preference. If you opt to make the meal yourself, just keep the ingredients simple - maintain the basic flavours of the central food item and enjoy."

Stoner doom is often bass-heavy and makes much use of guitar effects such as fuzz, phaser or flanger. Stoner doom could be viewed as the heavier and slower form of stoner rock, as the two styles emerged simultaneously. It was pioneered in the early–mid-1990s by bands such as Kyuss, Sleep, Cathedral, Acid King, Electric Wizard, Orange Goblin and Sons of Otis.

auckland,36w35w,itoldyouiwouldeatyou,4,Sat May 23 05:50:06 2015 UTC,"ITT: people who don't watch rugby.  The Blues have lost one game at Eden Park in the past two seasons, and that was last year to the two-time defending champions (Note: I said this before today's game, where they're playing the best team in the conference by a landslide).  Last year, the Blues beat the Waratahs at Eden Park (the Tahs were in excellent form, and went on to win the championship), and this year beat the top of the Australian conference (Brumbies), and then three weeks later beat the top of the South African conference (Bulls).  If you go to a Blues game at Eden Park, I think it's fair to say that you can expect a solid performance by the Blues at the very least, and it's not ridiculous to walk in expecting a win.  It's worth mentioning though, that the Blues are nowhere near playoff contention, and their two June opponents - the Highlanders and the Crusaders - are fighting to make/maintain the top 6.  These teams have a lot of beloved All Blacks in them, so don't be scared to cheer for good things the opposition team does.  Due to having a bad season, the people in attendance at Eden Park will be the die hard fans, so you'll be in excellent company.  They do gate sales, so just show up, buy the cheapest ticket (West/East stands), and roam around Eden Park.  If you've got a cheap seat and it's raining, I highly doubt they'll have any objections to you moving a little bit so you stay dry - provided you remain in the lower levels.  Eden Park staff go full Nazi about the top levels.  Get a train from Britomart to Kingsland, wear as much blue as you can, wave the free flag, and make as much noise as you can.

Depending on where youre located theres gaming on thursdays at hobbymaster ellerslie/takapuna from 6.30-9.30, freemans bay on a sunday afternoon, mt albert group meets on a tuesday night, north shore club meets on a wednesday night, theres lunchtime board gaming at the queens arcade in the CBD. Hobbymaster has a fb page and they hold games almost every night from MTG nights to the netrunner league on fridays. Theres also a 10% discount on all games from Hobbymaster for those who attend the Thursday meetups :) Apologies for my syntax, currently a wee bit high haha"
auckland,36tqkj,MyNameIsJoey2,2,Fri May 22 02:15:40 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! Thanks for the info. We live on the north shore so it's probably most convenient for us to check out that club. We go to hobbymaster in taka occasionally, usually just to look at games and we drop by King of Cards after work from time to time.  From my experience though, it's quite difficult finding a group to play games with at shops. Most people are playing Magic and unless you organise a game beforehand, it's difficult to get one going. So I guess joining the north shore club could be good.  We are also keen on having board game days if people are too! Great way to make new friends and play new games. We used to have full weekend days of just playing lots of board games. If anyone's interested they should definitely message back! :D"
auckland,36tqkj,Sandunen,2,Fri May 22 02:34:11 2015 UTC,From what I see on their fb page the north shore group has ~20 people on their wednesday night session being all tabletop gaming and some play-testing :) If you end up setting a day we'd happily attend with our small library of games  =D
auckland,36tqkj,Sandunen,2,Fri May 22 03:23:57 2015 UTC,"I'll let you know if I ever end up going! Weekdays are a little difficult for me to be honest, and that's why I've been looking for small groups who host games during the weekends. I might visit one day though! Just to see what it's like. My friend's boyfriend used to go quite a bit."
auckland,36tqkj,DunnerzKid,2,Fri May 22 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  We're out west (Glen Eden) but have a regular crew of board gamers. Twilight Imperium is the big one we book a month or two in advance (families, kids etc). I run the Auckland Blood Bowl League (Table top Blood Bowl) so obviously pretty keen on the Team Manger version too. Between the rabid collecting friends we have too many games to list. Also try the AUckland City Guard, meets every Sunday at Freemans Bay Community Centre on Hopetoun St - tons of board gaming there in addition to miniature gaming.  If you're keen for some real TI, we'd love to have you join - we've got a game coming up on the 30th I think. We've probably played a full dozen games(usually 5-6 players), sometimes we can even get 1 done in 6 hours!"
auckland,36tqkj,Sandunen,1 point,Fri May 22 03:15:54 2015 UTC,Oooh yay Twilight Imperium! That's awesome. I'd probably bring my boyfriend along as he would have to drive me. He dabbles a fair bit in wargaming as well but I think he's joining the North Shore Wargaming club.  I'd be keen to give Blood Bowl a go. The actual miniatures game I mean. Team Manager is boatloads of fun. We have two of the expansions and they aren't let downs!
auckland,36tqkj,Sandunen,1 point,Fri May 22 04:03:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome stuff! Will definitely keep in touch, can certainly organise some Blood Bowl - we do occasionally run Rookie Rumbles at a pub in Grey Lynn. Get the veterans to oversee a few games with some pints.  I also organize and run the Greenstone Cup - one the 3 NZ Blood Bowl tournaments and the de facto National Championship - our 12th year now in September :)"

auckland,36t8o0,kovrik,5,Thu May 21 22:53:33 2015 UTC,These are the rates from Watercare (PDF) so I assume that they're just oncharging from there. You should compare and contrast.  I imagine the water heating charge is because the water heating is centralised in your building? It should at the very least lower your power bills because otherwise you'd be heating your own water and paying for that through your electricity charges.
auckland,36t8o0,pondandbucket,1 point,Thu May 21 23:06:06 2015 UTC,"""Total Water Use"" is $18, which is 1.375 (from that PDF) * 13. It's OK.  But I don't get it why water heating and waste water are so expensive!  Also,   It should at the very least lower your power bills   We pay about $65 for electricity. I don't think it's cheap.  Anyway, as I stated above:   Basic (Electricity, Heating, Water, Garbage) for 85m2 Apartment - 175.48 NZ$   Our apt is not 85m2. And we pay $165 (water) + $65 (electricity) = $230 per month."
auckland,36t8o0,pondandbucket,1 point,Thu May 21 23:16:07 2015 UTC,Can you post a copy of the bill? (blacking out any sensitive info)
auckland,36t8o0,pondandbucket,1 point,Thu May 21 23:49:54 2015 UTC,Here it is: http://i.imgur.com/V10XOGe.png
auckland,36t8o0,pondandbucket,5,Fri May 22 00:06:07 2015 UTC,Quick notes.  WATER -- it's not quite equal to what Watercare charge since their prices include GST while this excludes it. This means there's a 15% difference.  WASTEWATER -- you're getting charged about double what a domestic customer is supposed to be charged. It looks like a business rate to me. You're also only supposed to be charged 78.5% of your water usage as Wastewater rather than 95%. So that's another reaming.   FIXED CHARGES -- Fixed charge for Watercare is $195/year. Which equals $16.25/month rather than the $33.26 (incl GST) you've been charged.   Can't really comment on the Water heating aspect but it does seem high.  Ignoring the Water Heating you're being charged $116.84 (INCL GST) for your water. Under Watercare you would have paid $58.22 (INCL GST).   You're definitely being way-overcharged.
auckland,36t8o0,pondandbucket,1 point,Fri May 22 00:25:27 2015 UTC,"That is sad.  What can I do with that?  Move to another apt/house where Watercare is a supplier? Or what?  I mean, I guess Easy Energy will say like ""It's our prices. If you don't like them - then move."", right?"
auckland,36t8o0,Ballzak,2,Fri May 22 00:29:29 2015 UTC,Try calling Watercare and ask if you can switch to them. Explain the situation and see what they say. You may not be able to switch (even if you do you'll probably still have to pay the water heating charge) but they might give you some good info.   From there talk to Easy Energy and your landlord.
auckland,36t8o0,Co-opCat,2,Fri May 22 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your help! I wrote an email to Watercare to learn if I can switch to them.  Easy Energy say like ""Near CBD prices are higher. And yeah, your water usage is pretty high, we will check usage for the next month.""  So, nothing helpful."
auckland,36t8o0,bluearbitrarycat,1 point,Fri May 22 00:46:51 2015 UTC,"Also, as far as I understand, it's not that they add their 15%, right?  They overcharge multiple times:  first, cold water is 15% more expensive.  second, wastewater is not 78.5%, but 95%, hence additional 16.5%  third, fixed charges are 100% greater than Watercare's.  And I guess water heating is overpriced as well..."
auckland,36t8o0,thevagabondpursuit,2,Fri May 22 03:49:22 2015 UTC,I think what's going on here is that Watercare treats the entire building as a business rather than domestic and charges them business rates. The Wastewater rates that Easy Energy pays are very close to business rates. So it's entirely possible that they're telling the truth here. It's just a horrible deal for the tenants.   Maybe the building was forced into it since they decided to centralise the water heating rather than have each unit have one. Save money/save space on their end and the tenants get screwed over with high rates.
auckland,36t8o0,UsernameNotForPorn,1 point,Fri May 22 04:24:41 2015 UTC,That's sucks :(  Guess I need to think about moving to another house/apt.  I will write if I get any update on that.  Thank you again! :)
auckland,36t8o0,personhole,1 point,Fri May 22 04:40:54 2015 UTC,"I'm in another apartment in Auckland. I've tried to argue this with the body corporate that we shouldn't be charged commercial rates for wastewater, but unfortunately due to the fact there are 5 commercial shops at the bottom of our 500 unit apartment running off the same supply watercare won't budge.  To be honest, it is a design issue with apartments here, the residential units should be on a different meter to the commercial."
auckland,36t8o0,Waimang_NINJA,4,Sat May 23 01:56:45 2015 UTC,"This happened to me too, was paying 120 for two a month.  This was at the zest appartments on nelson st.  Turns out the water price was managed by a coorporate that owned the building or something. This basically meant that there was nothing we could do, the building manager said it was gonna be changed in 5 years . So i moved out.   Water is now $40 a month, and theres 4 people.  Basically, get out if you can."
auckland,36t8o0,bluearbitrarycat,2,Fri May 22 07:42:08 2015 UTC,x2. Water charges in apartments are very high and there is usually nothing you can do about it a the water supplier is for the building.

auckland,36lvas,aguybrowsingreddit,3,Wed May 20 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"The Matakana Markets are pretty cool. The Saturday Farmers Market is the best I reckon, but I think there are different ones on a Sunday too. There's good food, veges and crafts etc. Plus quite cool shopping in the normal shops around there too.  My parents have been to Morris and James pottery and said it's pretty cool, getting to see behind the scenes on certain days. This Saturday is listed as one of those days.  From the main Matakana roundabout you can walk down Matakana Wharf Road and there is a walkway that heads up the river a bit and you can walk around some waterfalls. The path then comes out at Plume Cafe, so you can enter from there if you want too.  There's a really secluded quiet Bay on the way (slight detour) called Scandretts Bay that is cool to walk around. The original homestead is still there and can be looked through on certain days, as well as all the farm buildings, boat sheds etc. You can stay there in three doc batches too but i think need to book in advance.  A nice beach (prob better in Summer) is Anchor Bay, which you get to by driving through a kind of bird sanctuary, so there's heaps of Pukeko and what not hanging around.  All of the pubs and lunch spots I've been to are really good too. Rusty Pelican for one. Friendly service, good food, the ice cream place is great too!"

A little bit further up the road from Matakana you have the Sawmill Inn which has its own brewery attached. My favourite beach, Pakari, is around there too. A gorgeous white sandy beach. Ideal for a quiet walk. A bit further up the coast you have Te Arai beach which is a cool surf spot."

auckland,36d843,narufry,1 point,Mon May 18 15:37:12 2015 UTC,I recently learned that private parking can add extra % as an inconvenience fee which gets paid to the carpark owner. When a mate got towed in CBD recently it was $250 I think. Sadly having a shitty sign is never a functional argument!  EDIT: I also heard that if you can jump in your car while it's getting loaded up by tow truck they technically have to stop towing you.
auckland,36d843,sarahmohawk,1 point,Tue May 19 11:14:11 2015 UTC,"hello no, this thing that you heard about jumping into your car is not true. It is also very illegal and dangerous. You can be fined greatly for doing this, you could also be hurt if you are stupid enough. Please do not do this ever!  Depending on who you are being towed by, if you return to your car before it is connected to the truck, the driver may let you go without paying(If he's in a good mood, if you're in a good mood, if his boss is in a good mood, if the stars are aligned the right way), or if you return when your car is connected which is more likely, you will have to pay a call out fee, which is a small percentage of the full fee you would pay if your car was taken while you were not there. Generally towies are nice guys, the nicer you are to them the nicer they will be to you!  What do you mean by this extra %? from who? to who?"
auckland,36d843,narufry,2,Tue May 19 11:32:49 2015 UTC,"Allegedly the overall fee is a combination of $$$ mostly towards the tow company, but also a fee goes to the carpark owner (parking cost, administrative fees, etc etc). Citation needed, as I can't find a source for this right now. Some of the city tow fees are exorbitantly high though.  Re: The tow jumping rumour. Found out where I read it. consumer.org.nz   What happens if I arrive back as my car is being hooked up to the tow truck? After considering a case in which a car was towed away from a parking lot with the owner still in it, the High Court ruled that distress damage feasant does not apply where the owner of the car has possession. This is based on the principle that there is a risk of breach of the peace attached to exercising distress damage feasant in the presence of the owner.  So if you get into your car, effectively gaining possession and control of it, a tow truck driver must release it.  However, most tow truck operators will attempt to charge you a call-out fee if they have already broken into your car in order to hook it up. You do not have to pay."
auckland,36d843,sarahmohawk,1 point,Tue May 19 22:10:17 2015 UTC,"That article has a lot of incorrect things in it. It's been disproved in court multiple times, I believe. They wont change it... I don't have the law here but Im sure it's illegal (there are some really high fines), as well as really dangerous/stupid, and quite selfish to be honest. It's something about entering a multiple hazard area with machinery, without safety precautions or training etc.. You can damage a lot of property, including your car, the carpark, the tow truck, the driver, and most importantly, yourself.  If you dont want to get towed, honestly, Dont park on someone else's land without permission. It's so simple yet so many people dont get it. People pay to own and use that land, they rely on it to bring them customers, or give their tenants a place to park. It's like someone coming and parking in your driveway while you're out, or even while you're home. You're already a jerk for illegally parking, dont make yourself look like more of an idiot by fucking up someone who is just doing their job, and a business that is really there to help people.  You'll find that of the few companies that are likely to tow you in the CBD, all of them have similar prices, which have all been disputed in court multiple times and have been dismissed. It takes a fair amount of money to run a business, there are costs for the trucks, the fuel, the administration, combined with other numerous costs that you wouldnt even think of.  As for carpark owners being paid by the companies, that used to happen a lot, not so much now. I'm not so sure about that but it makes sense to me, and I dont see anything wrong with it imho."

(ultra fast broadband)  (check addresses here https://www.chorus.co.nz/maps)  If it's a standalone house with no shared driveway, then you can probably get UFB installed without too much trouble assuming your landlord isn't a dick about it.  However, if you plan on living in an apartment, this becomes even more important.  For apartments, don't just find somewhere that appears to have coverage on that chorus map - that means virtually nothing.  You need to check with the building manager that UFB has already been successfully installed in at least one apartment. If it hasn't been put into at least one of the apartments, then don't expect your apartment to EVER get it.    Finally, make sure you go with Bigpipe as an ISP because we're totally awesome. :)"

auckland,36d843,evolutionise,2,Mon May 18 14:18:43 2015 UTC,"I quite like the City Fitness gym in Newmarket.  Their prices are reasonable and the Newmarket location is pretty good - the city one isn't great, though.   If you're working in Newmarket, maybe look around Eden Terrace or Grafton. A lot of places will require a 12 month lease if you are going to the be the leaseholder, perhaps look instead at moving in with flatmates until you become more familiar with the area and know what you want.  The housing market is a bit crazy at the moment.  When renting, only companies can charge you a letting fee - if you're renting directly from the landlord, they can't charge you that.  They also can't enforce professional cleaning when you leave, which is standard in a lot of contracts - they want a receipt, but they can't legally insist on it (although both of these are from hearsay)."
auckland,36d843,CaroOaks,2,Tue May 19 02:48:07 2015 UTC,"Working in Newmarket should be pretty sweet.  Live in Parnell, or anywhere East or South of Newmarket but within the central Auckland landmass (not Panmure or beyond, no further south than Mt Wellington) so you'll be reasonably close in proximity but also via the major bus lines. Newmarket itself has lots of new-ish apartments which aren't to my taste as they can be dark and overlooked, but some people like them.  Do you need your own place or would you flat?  You could get a mean room in a shared house in Epsom, Royal Oak, Remuera, Ellerslie.  Close to Ellerslie village would by my current pick thanks to handy local pubs and restaurants.  Catch the bus to work, and run or walk home, maybe nipping up some hills on the way if you're into that kind of thing.  Save money on gym and petrol and spend it in bars and restaurants (priorities?) and have few drink drivey concerns unlike your colleagues.  Keep your car off road in free safe parking until you need it on weekends.  Go to church shops or red cross or SPCA shop for boring house stuff like bookcases."

The outer bus goes to Newmarket and all inner-city suburbs. Parking is a rip off in the city unless it's included at your workplace so public transport or two wheels (scooter/cycle) is a better choice.  If you're looking for safety vs. CBD proximity Parnell has a reputation for being extremely docile, but not necessarily the cheapest option."

The first time I was told by the girl that she couldn't remember the company's details and she'd contact me back which never happened. It would also be polite for your staff to remind customers that they need to cancel the debit of their own accord because after a year or so of membership, not everyone will remember that there's two companies. Yes it is the customers responsibility to remember this (which I did) but your staff still never said anything upon my cancellation.   I mentioned the payment method of your gym to other friends and some gyms/PTs when I shopped around again for prices a year later and they all told me that having a separate debit company that you need to contact separately from your gym, which they don't bother to contact for you or even remind you of upon cancelling is a shitty form of profit gathering. It may be used in other gyms like you claim but you know what? Gyms are still well known for having terrible payment schemes like that and the fact that some other places have them doesn't change that.   I may have lost my debit contract but I did still remember the terms on it and that doesn't change the fact your gym has a terrible payment method and your staff are extremely unhelpful."

I went in to get the debit companies details and the girl screwed around for ages and said she didn't know and she'd get back to me. This never happened.

Set in a medieval steampunk metropolis called the City, the game follows Garrett, a master thief trained by a secret society. An expanded edition of the game, Thief Gold, was released in 1999.  Thief was the first PC stealth game to use light and sound as game mechanics. Its use of first-person perspective for non-confrontational gameplay challenged the first-person shooter market, which led the developers to call it a ""first-person sneaker"". The game combines complex artificial intelligence with simulation systems to allow for emergent gameplay. Thief‍ '​s influence has been traced to later stealth titles such as Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and Hitman.  The game received critical acclaim and has been placed on numerous hall-of-fame lists. With sales of half a million units by the year 2000, it is Looking Glass' most commercially successful game. Thief was followed by three sequels: Thief II: The Metal Age (2000), Thief: Deadly Shadows (2004) and the reboot Thief (2014). Looking Glass closed after Thief II‍ '​s release, and so the latter two games were developed by Ion Storm and Eidos Montreal, respectively.

Try freestuff.co.nz for free junk. There's also other accommodation sites like nzflatmates. Sadly either way getting a flatmate online has never worked out that great, usually they make a great first impression and then turn out crazy later. Maybe that's just my age demographic though (students).  Trade & exchange used to be the shit back in the day of paper classifieds. Online really destroyed that though. Better deals can be had when there isn't an easy way to compare price, and get competitive pricing."

auckland,364jq8,thevagabondpursuit,5,Sun May 17 06:41:47 2015 UTC,"I would try finding an airbnb (https://www.airbnb.co.nz/) while you look for longer term accommodation. You could probably rent a place for up to a month, and probably more cost effective than a hotel. You could offer to pay the rent in full in advance (6 months/1 year), this worked for a Dutch friend in Australia. IT - think you will find work pretty quick.

auckland,364jq8,BornInTheCCCP,3,Sun May 17 06:45:24 2015 UTC,"Talk to your hotel about providing a reference for rentals. Smaller ones will usually be happy enough to help you out if you're friendly. In regards to finding a rental, all I can say is check listings every day (sort trademe by latest listings. If it's been listed more than a week it's probably taken), call agents and be prepared to sign a 1 year lease to make yourselves attractive tenants. Maybe have a bank statement with your savings until you have a job. You may have to expand where you are looking to live just to get something.  I'd also go talk to some of the bigger property managment companies (barfoot and thompson, harcourts) and see if they have anything they need rented out. HomeAds is private landlords (and advertised on Trademe) and you might get a break there."

As you might have noticed it is not simple to get around the city without a car.   As many pointed out look at tradme, loads of info.  For current address, just put your hotel.  If you cannot find anything that you like, look at holiday homes those are usually cheaper than hotels, and easy to get and full furnished.  Having a cat might actually be an issue, as most landlords will skip applications with pets."

You're being risk profiled and rejected because, frankly you are statistically likely to cost them a lot. Young males are way over represented in accident stats. Unfortunately the 350Z is also overrepresented in crashes, not because it's a crap handling car - but because owners generally hoon them and don't have the skills to control the vehicle.  ""Topping the list of deadliest cars on the road is another Nissan: the two-door 350Z from model years 2005 to 2008.

Then the local traffic cop wanted to go for a blast in it too and he also wanted a burnout in it and then some LOL."
auckland,362aa8,antidamage,-1,Fri May 29 00:35:05 2015 UTC,"The places that WILL insure you won't honour it. They're notorious for finding ways to get out of it or even bending the agreement. NAC is a good example of this.  It might not be a bad idea to transfer the car into your parents' names and insure it via them, with you as a driver. Even if you're not insured as a driver, at least you're insured against theft.  An even better option would be to use an insurance broker. They'll go into bat for you if something happens and won't tolerate the insurer's bullshit. I used to use Circle as my broker, they were decent. That said, I've heard mixed stories about brokers just caving too, so make sure you get one that someone you trust will vouch for."
auckland,362aa8,Turborg,4,Wed May 20 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"I have to completely disagree with you here. Of course they're going to try and get out of paying anything they can... LEGALLY. It's a business, that's how business work.   You're the one reading the contract and signing it. If you've done something that falls outside of the contract and they don't pay out because of that, it's no ones fault but your own. It's not the insurance company ""finding ways to get out of it"" or ""bending the agreement"" which would be illegal. they're simply operating a business the way that all businesses run and complying with their contract that YOU HAVE SIGNED."
auckland,362aa8,antidamage,-2,Fri May 29 00:58:43 2015 UTC,"I'll give you an example then.  Many years ago I had an accident. I was young, silly and was called in to work at 3am to fix what turned out to be a broken link on a webpage (""...because the entire product is down! You have to get in there now or you're fired!"") I was tired, it was wet and I crashed. I lost sight in one eye and partially in the other because of the accident and my employer never did a damn thing to help me, or answered for their contribution to the situation. But that's another story.  I was insured with Tower using Circle as my broker. Because I was on a restricted license and driving outside of my permitted hours the insurance company rejected the claim. They said I was breaking the law so they didn't have to pay out. Circle - like I said you want your broker to do - went into bat for me and pointed out that the fact I was on a restricted license didn't actually contribute to the accident at all. How could it? Those conditions can happen any time. And so the insurance company came to the party and covered the claim.  It's not even a grey area. They initially declined to cover the claim in breach of our contract. And all they have to do in most cases is continue to refuse - people won't risk going to court and having costs awarded against them. Casual justice is for the wealthy. Anyone who rights that balance are good people in my books.  And I have more stories like this. I have a friend who saved all his money from working as a teenager and bought a nice car in his 20s, insured it with NAC only to have his claim thrown out after the vehicle was stolen, with the insurer suggesting he sold the car and made it look like theft. It's outrageous and unfair and absolutely fucking bullshit. And we shouldn't have to stand for it, not with premiums like what NAC charge.  So for all your obnoxious capitals about signed contracts, the party with all the lawyers doesn't give a shit what it says or what they signed, they're only in it to fight it until it's unprofitable to do so. And that is why we need harsher penalties for insurers who bend or break the law.  tl;dr: Insurance companies actually do break the law routinely. But you can stop them if you're willing to fight or smart about it in the first place."
auckland,362aa8,cynical_genius,2,Fri May 29 08:26:17 2015 UTC,"Tower were right to decline your claim. A fully licenced driver (with more experience) may have reacted differently and not had an accident. Now, granted that's a big maybe, but the fact is you were breaking the law by driving at the time and were thus in breach of the contract.  You have the right to dispute the decision but this must be done within 3 months of the initial declinature, this information should all be in the declinature letter. Firstly you have to go through their own internal disputes resolution service.  It sucks, but to get to the ISO (Insurance and Savings Ombudsman) you have to do this. Getting your Full DL in this time would definitely help (not sure if you're able to drive though given your injuries).  If they uphold the decision you need to get a Letter of Deadlock to go to the ISO within 2 months. This process is absolutely free for you as a consumer.   I can say in all honesty that the ISO would have upheld Tower's decison. I work in insurance (not for Tower) and I have seen many claims like this.  As for your friend he has the right to go through the same process. NAC would have to need a huge amount of evidence to back up that claim.  TL;DR You're incorrect. You can challenge the decision to the highest level at no cost."

My 20 year old girlfriend has her 300HP turbo monster fully insured with AMI as a restricted driver.  It's modified to shit and they never saw it as a problem.  I have a 92' MR2 Turbo insured without an issue as an under 25.  A friend has his 5.0L V8 insured with State as a 19 year old restricted driver.

I hate that in the herald article you were refereed to as a ""boy racer"".  I hate that term!  Great to hear you've worked hard for it though.  Not many people can say they have a clean record either.  Sounds like you're flying the straight and narrow and can't see why insurance is so hard for you.  I'm in to classics and early '90s cars.

I got my a Supra in the start of the year when I was 20 and AMI gave me the best rates by far and had no trouble figuring out if it was okay to give me cover. Simple phone call was all it took.  NAC gave me very overpriced quotes compared to AMI. Youi is the worst though, stay far far away from them.  Edit: For reference, I'm on my full license."
auckland,362aa8,JoshFiles2,-3,Fri May 29 09:33:36 2015 UTC,"This happened to my son also. He is 22 has a Mazda RX8. youi took on his insurance. I actually went to the Human Rights commission over Tower. I was with Tower for over 20 years for all kinds of insurance and yet they still denied my son insurance. I cancelled ALL of my insurances right there and then, youi got 5 new policies because Tower wouldn't insure him. He has never lost his licence, has a good clean driving record, never has had to claim on his insurance, but Tower....NO!!!!! You guys do have a case with the Human Rights Commission.  The following paragraph is on their website.  'In the provision of goods and services:  It is unlawful to refuse to supply goods, services or facilities, or to provide them on less favourable terms or conditions, because of someone’s age. The definition of facilities includes banking, insurance, grants, loans and credit or finance.'   Go on guys, email. write to them, also write to the CEO's of all the insurance companies that deny you because of age, car, etc.... I did and my son did also."
auckland,362aa8,chrisdawitch,4,Fri May 29 00:06:41 2015 UTC,Nope. Section 48 of the Human Rights Act allows discrimination on the basis of age in contracts of insurance so long as the basis for discrimination is grounded in statistics.

auckland,35mz9r,bbqroast,5,Wed May 13 07:48:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. Rail already makes it to Puhunui Rd Station which is 9.3km away from the airport. I think we could easily provide a shuttle bus that runs from Puhunui Rd Station to the airport.  If we're going to make railway lines to the airport, that's fine - it should be a 9km link from Puhunui Rd Station (or nearby) but the line should be used for both cargo and people."
auckland,35mz9r,gtphanta,3,Mon May 11 23:06:59 2015 UTC,"But so does the council, who's 10 year budget includes around $20 million for the early stages of rail to the airport (mostly just route protection, and not starting on even that for 5 years yet) and 3 times that amount for 45km of new bus lanes.

As much as I'd like rail to the airport, it's very expensive and that money could be beer spent in the meantime on public transport within the city which will reduce commuting time.

auckland,35mz9r,BuckyDoneGun,1 point,Tue May 12 12:55:05 2015 UTC,"Always felt an airport link would be better connecting to the Southern line at Puhinui/Manakau, rather than extending the Onehunga line. Heavy rail direct to the airport is a nice idea but not needed.  Having a simple transfer from the main PT lines to a specific airport service isn't unusual.

auckland,35k4yu,123felix,11,Mon May 11 06:06:01 2015 UTC,They have taken the article down because it was so inaccurate fyi.  Fares will not be rising under the new scheme.
auckland,35k4yu,couchlol,3,Mon May 11 05:40:44 2015 UTC,"Existing monthly zone passes already cover transfers - I buy a monthly zone A pass which saves me about $20 per month given that I have 2 trips each way each day.  It sounds like they are going to really load up on cash fares - I know they want to move everyone to HOP cards, but jumping to $9.50 to a 4-stage trip sounds crazy.  We need a better analysis than I have yet read explaining why the Auckland infrastructure is so much more expensive per trip than Wellington.  Reports like were posted earlier today indicate that in Auckland we already pay more for our transport...but that we pay a much smaller portion of the actual operating costs.  What is being considered 'operating costs' - a move from diesel to electric is more one of infrastructure than actual operations in my view.  Agree with OP - if we get a significant increase in transit fares in Auckland where there is already a fairly strong bias that public transit is slow, unreliable, and only for people who can't afford a car - then we'll drive people back into seeing the roads and their car as the preferred method of getting around."

They beach to lay eggs. It is unusual that this came up on a boat ramp. Maybe it is a bit confused. Also I don't think this is the right place(not warm enough etc).  There's certain beaches where it happens regularly and like penguins in Otago peninsula + Caitlins, you can watch this happen. Later on when the eggs have hatched you can watch the baby turtles run to the sea for their first swim.

Trademe seems to have the problem with shipping and listed charges plus you still get a fairly low hit rate.  My guess is:   If you are prepared to accept $1-$3 per book then probably list in reddit and tell people on facebook/twitter etc If you have plenty of time try listed on trademe to get good prices for a few of the books and re-assess what you'll do with the remaining.. You can probably get 50c to $1 each at a second hand book shop, maybe (not tried this recently) Try some of the charity options.

auckland,356ixg,MyNameIsNotPat,2,Fri May 8 06:34:05 2015 UTC,"The Warrant of Fitness (WOF) is worth paying attention to, depending on where you come from, it can be a big change.  Every 6 months (less for new cars, but you said cheap), your car will need a safety inspection.  It is pretty strict, basically if they see rust, you fail until it is repaired (not covered up).  It can easily cost more to repair a cheap car than it is worth.  Driving without a wof is not a good plan.  When you park the car, the parking wardens will hit you with a $200 fine if they notice, and they do look.  Also, if you don't have a wof, then you can't renew your registration ($200 per year), and that is another fine of about the same amount.  Get your car checked out before you buy.

If they are going to spend $33M on this and expect to make $3M back per year from people walking or cycling when there is less cost for driving or taking a bus....I think they are drastically under-estimating the usage and revenue that will result.  You don't encourage a healthy choice to driving by making it the most-expensive and least-appealing alternative."

The council need to stop building things half-arsed. Those bridge clip-ons have already past their expiry date.
auckland,34zjp5,noface,6,Tue May 5 21:56:35 2015 UTC,"First up, the council isn't building it, simply underwriting it. It's being built by a private outfit, hence the tolls. NZTA (the government) are unwilling to fund it and the council can't afford it for some time.  Secondly the clip-ons aren't past their expiry date, a couple of years ago NZTA spent $80m strengthening them with 900 tons of extra steel, and took into account the added loading of a pedestrian structure.  The limited number of people thing isn't something to worry about, they aren't going to be saying ""only 10 people at once!"" it's about managing overcrowding - every structure has a maximum loading.  But yes, the idea that it has to be tolled to pay for it is utterly ridiculous, and it's the type of project that NZTA should be paying for, if it weren't for the fact the RoNS programme is bleeding them dry to build poorly scoped and uneconomic highways.

We've got beaches, the peninsula with seals and albatrosses, the Caitlins a few hours south, Queenstown not too far away, and heaps of tramping close by. If you're only here for a semester the uni offers their own flats - they provide a room, furniture, power and internet for about $4000 a semester. 99% of American exchange students stay in them cause you it's just so much easier. You share common areas with a few other people - mostly other exchange students with one kiwi host.   Auckland is a different story - you'll definitely want to have a car and studios will cost much more. There are a lot more food and entertainment options though, but if you're from a moderately sized city in the US it'll all seem basic to you anyway.   What are you studying? The two unis have different academic strengths too."
auckland,34wk00,Spoonsandturtles,2,Tue May 5 04:21:28 2015 UTC,Awesome! You're my guy from now on ha. There's a program at my community college that'll let me finish up my bachelor's in business in one year at otago and it'll work out to be cheaper than doing it in the states.   When it comes to housing I prefer to be on my own as possible if it's not too crazy (AT LEAST my own room and toilet).   What are the differences in campuses? I really want a university experience since I'm paying for it you know? Lots of people to meet and things to do. I want to enjoy my time there as much as possible.
auckland,34wk00,Spoonsandturtles,4,Tue May 5 04:36:53 2015 UTC,"No one shares rooms here (except for couples and weirdos) haha, but if you want your own bathroom that'll have to be a studio. Take a look at trademe for listings in North Dunedin or City Centre to get an idea.   If you're thinking about staying in NZ long term Auckland might be better because there are more networking opportunities, but that might not even matter.   Campuses are HUGELY different. Otago has a traditional campus with all everything in one place. Most students live within 15 minutes walk and the city is like 20% students - freakishly empty over summer. Right now I'm taking an ice hockey course and dance classes - our rec centres also do rock climbing trips, horse riding, kayaking and all that. You've also got shit like bone jewellery carving and tribal drumming classes. Most people at Auckland commute since many students don't live in the CBD - the campus is sort of like Boston University where it's buildings scattered around a few streets in town. They've got a meat club though so I'm jealous of that. Also the only 2am drunk food you can get here is McDonalds and Subway, if that matters at all. :P"

auckland,34wk00,chmbrln,3,Tue May 5 10:00:41 2015 UTC,"Hey.  Are you going to Otago University in Auckland?  Dunedin is where the main campus is located (which is a 2hr flight from Auckland), and (from my limited understanding) they don't have a full Auckland campus.  However, if you are, then yea, Auckland is a great place.  Safe, public transport isn't terrible, but not great by a long shot.  If you're living in the city and aren't travelling too often outside of the city centre (or its surrounds), then public transport should suffice.  The housing is quite expensive, but as a student, you'll probably want to look at student accommodation."
auckland,34wk00,EndlessOcean,2,Tue May 5 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I'm still trying to decide between Dunedin and Auckland honestly. Do you know anything about living down there?"
auckland,34wk00,EndlessOcean,3,Tue May 5 03:53:20 2015 UTC,It's pretty but it's very very far away. It's also cold. The people are nice though and the quality of life is a lot more peaceful than up here in Auckland.
auckland,34wk00,nouncommittee,8,Tue May 5 04:22:56 2015 UTC,keeps the cold away.
auckland,34wk00,thevagabondpursuit,3,Tue May 5 09:13:40 2015 UTC,Auckland is in the midst of a severe housing crisis so housing should be much cheaper in Dunedin. Go to the trademe.co.nz website to see rent prices. If you choose Auckland over Dunedin you will have to make a large compromise on either rental costs or commuting times if not both. Dunedin has some of the worst housing stock of a New Zealand city so make sure you get something warm as their climate is similar to London's. Students in Auckland should be more serious while Otago has more partiers and socialisers.   Auckland has twelve times the population of Dunedin. Google Earth and Streetview should give you a good idea of their differences. There is no way I'd feel safe on two wheels in Auckland with the traffic. Your biggest crime risk would be having stuff stolen from your room.
auckland,34wk00,ThunderSteaks,1 point,Tue May 5 09:43:46 2015 UTC,"Go to Dunedin! Boyfriend was studying at Otago (Dunedin), we now live in Auckland. Dunedin is a student town, cost of living is cheaper, south island is great for travelling and where a lot of the scenic NZ sights are. If you live in town easy to get around.. I loved Dunedin when I visited and sometimes wished we stayed down there."
auckland,34wk00,logantauranga,2,Tue May 5 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"Moving from the US, you will find day to day items much more expensive here (I'm Canadian and thought that).  Housing here is relatively affordable if you're renting, and depending on the type of the place can range from 100-400/wk, depending on if you want flatmates or not.  I haven't found security to be much of a concern since being here and as long as you get the right insurance, it shouldn't matter anyways.  You'll probably want to get a car while here, you can find a get-around car easily for $1000-2500.  It won't be pretty but it'll work.  Gas (petrol) is more expensive here, expect to pay ~5.43 USD/ gallon.  Car is a better option, insurance on motorcycles here is very high, plus you can use it year round (lots of rain).   Transit is available, but won't help you get out of the city for weekend trips etc.  Hope you enjoy it!  I know I am."
auckland,34wk00,Toxicable,3,Tue May 5 10:14:21 2015 UTC,"It's not that it rains a whole lot, more that showers can start and stop really quickly and motorcyclists get caught out."

auckland,34b7w5,alleycatd,6,Wed Apr 29 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"If Auckland was in the US, it would be the tenth largest city. It has similarities with San Diego, San Francisco, and Boston, but culturally it's closer to a Canadian city. It is mostly white and has a large Asian, Pacific Islander and Maori population. If you watch ""The Flight Of The Conchords"" you'll get a sense of what New Zealanders are like and what they find appropriate and funny. Sports are big here, but not the ones you're familiar with. Rugby, cricket, and rugby league are prominent. You can find sports bars that screen NFL/NHL/NBA/baseball games if you look hard enough. Most things are more expensive in New Zealand than in the US, especially food and clothing (about 50% higher prices). On the plus side, all our beef is grass-fed because that's the only way we do it. Be sure to get out Auckland on a regular basis and see the country. Some tourists get stuck in the city and never see the best parts of New Zealand."
auckland,34b7w5,logantauranga,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:59:31 2015 UTC,The stuff are more expensive but isn't the exchange rate in favor of the $US? Also how easy is it to travel around outside of Auckland/ Where are some cool places to go/ What are they like?

auckland,34b7w5,lastflightout,5,Thu Apr 30 04:08:39 2015 UTC,"Hey fellow international student! I'm also a guy from the US who's currently studying at AUT! (I'm writing this from my apartment on campus actually) Auckland to me is a bit weird to compare to other places haha. It's really not a very big city compared to anywhere in the US, but in the center of the CBD (Where AUT is) there is a lot going on.  Everyone here is in love with Rugby, and I would recommend going to a game as long as you are here, but other sports are around too. Clothing here is the same as in the US so I wouldn't worry about that. As for nightlife, you can drink when you are 18 so the culture is a bit different here. A lot of the Kiwis I know are 18-20 and so being able to drink is a big deal, and they tend to drink a ton. But they can also go to bars, and there are a couple ""student bars"" where you can pretty much be sure there will be AUT students every day of the week. People can also drink in the WSA Apartments but they will come by to shut you down between 10:30-12 depending on the day. Other than that it's a fun city. The best part for me at least it the ability to get out of the city and into nature. This county is incredible and so take advantage of it while you are here!"
auckland,34b7w5,lastflightout,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:42:47 2015 UTC,How were the classes compared to American ones? Also how easy was it to make last minute plans to travel? I am really social and what to do everything I can to take advantage of this opportunity.
auckland,34b7w5,lastflightout,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:27:29 2015 UTC,"My university back in the states is quite competitive and difficult and so I think the classes here are really easy. That being said, I do have work to do, and I can't just sit back and relax 24/7. In terms of having time to travel, that not a problem at all. It's really easy to travel the country and lots of international students will be wanting to go as well"

Rugby is the sport of choice in winter, but there are plenty of teams around if you wanted to play.  You don't say what part of the US you are from but you may find our winters very mild and very wet. We have a similar population size to San Antonio TX.   Edit: Sorry I'm a little old for the nightlife question.  I did study at AUT and look them up on Facebook.  They have a really active page and you'll get a feel for the uni. Drink the coffee from #hashtag on the city campus. It's the best other than the library cafe at Akoranga."

auckland,34b7w5,RightWingFanatic,2,Thu Apr 30 03:24:23 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be at the beach at that time of the year. The water is far to cold to swim.   It gets into the single digits in Celsius but Auckland doesn't get snow. (My husband in forms me that it's 40-50s in F) The lower half of the north island does. There's some pretty good ski fields a few hours south of the city.
auckland,34b7w5,Hubris2,2,Thu Apr 30 03:54:19 2015 UTC,Awesome that is great to know when it comes for me to start packing. So this coffee place you recommend is called #hashtag? Are there any other cool foods/restaurants I should try in Auckland/NZ? Where would be the most unique place to visit on the North and South Island too?
auckland,34b7w5,benjamding,3,Thu Apr 30 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"Eggs Benedict and a flat white, you can get them in almost any cafe. Friends from the US love them.  My husband is American (from Texas) and loves meat pies (specifically mince and cheese), Tim tams, L&P (it's a soft drink), and roast lamb. Apparently surf and turf is a kiwi-ism as well, steak and seafood usually prawns.   If the uni puts on a hangi, food cooked underground, it's worth it. You probably won't find a restaurant that does them   #hashtag is just a good coffee joint on campus.   Edit: last line got redditafied"

May be annoying but if you roll with it they will drop it pretty quickly. Drinking age is 18, so you will find a different pub/party culture. Take advantage of the outdoors, even in winter there - go to the beaches, gulf islands. Skiing on the Mountain (Ruapehu http://www.mtruapehu.com/winter/) or in the South Island."

Generally online stuff is historical (1800s) and revolves around personal histories rather than areas. If you do a Google Image search you'll mostly turn up black-and-white photographs.  I live in an historic building and the foyer has photos of its construction and origins, so you could visit the buildings you're interested in and talk with people there to see what they have."

Also, people used to ride elephants at Auckland Zoo.  The casino and tower went up from 1994-97, so if you can find newspaper archives from that period I'm sure they'll have editorials and headlines. The central library has a research room on the top floor with some staff old enough to remember -- you could ask them about it.  There used to be a huge windmill on K Rd and it got pulled down for no good reason. The outcry kickstarted the Auckland historical preservation movement, so that's pretty cool."
auckland,344t8c,logantauranga,3,Tue Apr 28 09:42:39 2015 UTC,Reminds me of Calgary and Toronto where they dig that far down for everything in the CBD because of all the underground shops they have. I guess in Sky Tower's case it was mostly for car parking - it would be cool if all the carparks in Auckland were subterranean.
auckland,344t8c,logantauranga,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:20:32 2015 UTC,"Underground shops? There might be some in the area if there are underground trains, but in general digging underground is required for having foundations below the frost line, not to build underground."

If you like the idea of living here, take that offer.  You'll be taxed on your income identically to an NZ resident on the same income, but whether or not you still have to file and pay taxes back in Austria will be a question you have to sort out for yourself.  The NZ IRD's online income tax calculator tells me that $100k will be $6,219.23 per month in your hand after tax.  The average pre-tax individual annual income in Auckland is (off the top of my head) somewhere around $55k, so that $100k per annum / $6200 a month after tax is quite comfortable for a single person. On that income in Auckland you should be able to rent a one-bedroom apartment, buy a decent second-hand car, and generally live pleasantly while still saving money each month."
auckland,33uo5p,jrandom_42,4,Sat Apr 25 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"We have a double tax agreement with Austria.

To give you some real numbers, last year in Auckland I spent, in total, around 20,000 NZD including rent in a suburb near the city centre. This includes lots of craft beer, and restaurants. Although I didn't own a car and used PT exclusively so that saved me a bit."
auckland,33uo5p,KiwiNachSchland,0,Tue Apr 28 10:01:29 2015 UTC,I'm sure you're right. I was a bit too conservative in my evaluation there.

auckland,33uo5p,jrandom_42,2,Tue Apr 28 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"Wait, are you saying that you need more than 100k a month to survive?"

auckland,33uo5p,jrandom_42,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:08:43 2015 UTC,Ah right. That still sounds like a lot! So you have a family that you're supporting plus someone else's family through child support?

Topman just opened and there were queues around the block for a week. public transport is okay for the central city but to go away at the weekends you'll want a car, an a place to park it.

(Anyone else goto that 550 person house party in Parnell two weekends ago?) With a bunch of very nice restaurants as well as great cheap eats.  Auckland is a great launching pad to other great parts of the country, an hour or less from amazing beaches and bush walks etc.  Aucklanders are ok, but you'll generally find them friendly and the ones from smaller towns more so (global norm).  Tech industry is pretty cool here, few neat startups and some bigger ones that are awesome.   What else...  Put it this way: I know a good amount of people who turn down 250k+ to take 150k and live in a smaller house in Auckland just for the lifestyle.  That all being said, life is what you make of it.

It's definitely enough to live a good and comfortable life.   Houses are much more common here than apartments, although that is beginning to change. A lot of single people/young people live in flats, which are like a WG in DE/Ö, and this would be cheaper than renting a place by yourself.

Declining use of article  Public transport in Auckland:       Auckland had an extensive tram network, but this was removed in the 1950s, with the last line closing in late 1956.   Ambitious rail transport schemes for the city and region were mooted several times in the 20th century. In the 1950s these were ignored in favour of a Master Transportation Plan emphasising motorways, and the influential De Leuw Carter report of 1965 and the passionate championship of mayors like John Luxford and Dove-Myer Robinson could not achieve funding for the proposed rail extensions.

Short sightedness in the 1950's, thinking that we could keep building roads and highways to meet private car demand. I wasnt around then but I reckon there wasn't much of an argument against ripping out the tram lines, everyone was in love with their cars.  More freedom, independence etc."
auckland,33n8zm,nicbrown,8,Fri Apr 24 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"If all the things required to make a light rail service run well were instead applied to a bus route along the same route, wouldn't the bus be just as quick?  Things like get on any door, pay while moving,  dedicated lanes that it was absolutely unacceptable to block, platforms, clarity over routes and a constant frequent timetable so no one stops to ask where it goes. None of these require investment in rails and rolling stock, and all are required for light rail to be effective.   Why not just get on and do all these with buses?"
auckland,33n8zm,carkell,14,Fri Apr 24 05:23:25 2015 UTC,"Trams are far more comfortable and attractive to passengers than buses. Tram and LRT projects internationally have attracted 30-40% of patronage from former car drivers. The best BRT systems have attracted less than 5% of their patronage from cars.  And trams have a 'fuck you' factor far in excess of buses. Buses are traffic. Trams, even on mixed mode roads, move faster because other vehicles keep out of the way. There is no better 'dedicated lane that it is unacceptable to block' than a tramway. This is actually a serious argument that has been put forward for consideration when planning PT in European cities."
auckland,33n8zm,Shapeshifters,3,Fri Apr 24 05:44:47 2015 UTC,"The problem with buses is that if we give all of the major corridors as many buses as they need, once they all converge in the city centre there just isn't enough room for them.  Countless examples around the world show that people are more willing to catch a tram than ride a bus. The other big advantage is that the  light rail infrastructure is permanent, as opposed to just a bus lane.  This means that high density, transit orientated mixed use developments (shops and apartments) can be built confidently near the light rail route.  Which is the key to improving transport in Auckland, IMO."

Your options are extremely limited. Google only allows a certain intake per annum for dating website adclicks and the adspace is extremely expensive.   Also almost all social media platforms ban dating website advertising(facebook especially you can have a page but any paid advertising is against policy unless your spending more then $10,000 a month). Your going to have to make sure your SEO is almost perfect for your website to even be recognized and rely on an already flooded print media market for dating.

Don't be a negative dick, put on a smile and some clothes you feel awesome in, make small talk, actually give a crap about the places you go to.   Make a list of all the places you handed your CV to. Wait 2-3 days and call each place back, ask for the manager (don't tell the person who picks up the phone what you're calling about). Once you get the manager, tell them why you called and why you're awesome and why they need you. It's cool (slightly misleading, but totally sweet) to not tell them you're only going to be there for 3 months. Minimum wage/slightly higher jobs usually have high staff turnover; 3 months is the average, you'll be sweet. The last thing bosses want to hear is the prospect of not having someone under their chains for aaages. You can always hand in your notice 2.5 months in.   Doesn't always work and it can be soul sucking, especially when you're a teen because people don't take you seriously at all.   Shit! This got long, but I hope it helps a little. It's kind of cool to work somewhere that you hand picked. Who knows, they might hire you through uni and that's usually pretty sweet, unless they get cunty in which case, that sucks. GOOD LUCK."

The Tribunal will look at your financial situation and make a ruling on paying it back, and then so long as you stick to that, the insurers won't be able to send you to collections.  As other posters have said, protect your credit history at all costs.  If I were you I'd:  (a) Call the insurers, tell them you're obviously keen to avoid being sent to collections / having a default listed, and ask them if they're willing to let you enter into a payment arrangement. I'd be very surprised if they said no.  (b) If they do say no, immediately file with the Disputes Tribunal. Your claim should state that you dispute the cost of repair the insurers are trying to hit you with.  The CAB should be able to help you with both of those steps."

Poor guy.  Perhaps there is something you do about it here.  I had the opposite. As a student I saw a real estate lady scratch my car as she pulled out from a parallel carpark. She gave me card then later denied the whole thing and refused to answer calls/emails. I still have that scratch haha.  You need to come to some arrangement with the company to pay it back. You also need to be clear that you WILL pay the money but need a payment plan.  This is a hidden cost of having 3rd party insurance only, try write off (in your head) the 1k against the savings in premiums and excess if you had full insurance.   Let us know how you progress."

Not as subtle as hickory or fruit wood but still good. I'd say 90% of NZ smoked foods will use manuka and it's widely available.   If you're intent on using a more traditional American style BBQ\smoking wood you could ask firewood sellers on trademe if they have any fruitwood lying around. Someone might've cut down or pruned an old fruit tree recently. You never know  Plan C would be roaming the streets with an axe looking for fruit trees in people's front yards."
auckland,33fxv0,th3government,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:54:13 2015 UTC,"I looked around for hickory chunks a while back but I couldn't find anything.  Oak is a good wood for smoking, milder than hickory though but it works well with all meats.  If you've got the tools and don't mind the upfront cost get yourself a used wine barrel off trademe and break it down into staves.  You can then cut the staves any size you want.  There's enough wood in a barrel to last you for years and works out cheaper per kg than those bags of chips you get from Mitre10/Bunnings.  You could try a tree fellers for fresh fruit wood but it really needs to age for a while from what I've heard.  Good luck with the butt, dat pulled pork."

auckland,33c5om,Forevrica,6,Tue Apr 21 09:30:45 2015 UTC,"There are about 5 areas in Auckland for this; Ponsonby, K Road, Britomart, Viaduct, and Drake St. Yes, there are others and places in between, but these places have concentrations of places to go.  Anyway, my suggestions. If you're using the sky tower as a meeting place then I would suggest getting some food & drinks at Depot or the Federal Delicatessen (If they're back open now... please be). Play a little in the casino, if you want to (not advised, you'll lose, don't do it). If either of those places are closed walk down to the Cityworks Depot go to Odettes Eatery if you have money, go to Food Truck Garage if you have less. From there, if you want a craft beer go to Brothers Beer (still in the Cityworks depot and they do Pizza if you don't want the Food Trucks healthy alternatives), their own beers aren't amazing but they stock and have some good stuff on tap, the place is like someones lounge with lots of beer.  Once ready to move to a more intimate but still bar area, walk down to the end of Drake St to Matterhorn (formerly Libertine), the outdoor area is great for drinking and chatting, the service is quick but sometimes a bit creepy, also nothing like the Wellington Matterhorn.  If you're not into lounging and want to dance then the — terribly named — Sweat Shop (formerly Sale St) is the place to go, I don't really recommend, but there are plenty of people dancing and having fun.  But really Britomart is probably a better place to meet (trains, buses), so pre load a little at home then come into town. Start off with a nice Shochu cocktail at Fukuko it's a small bar in Britomart, the Nori chips are great and their pork buns once were, but are now hit or miss. Then for substantial food and more drinking head to Orleans, Chicken Waffles and cocktails and once it gets late Racket will start getting good too, but Orleans will move most of the tables and get more of a dance floor going. If you're on the cheap go to Better Burger I rate the burgers (about $6 each too), you can also get drinks from Britomart Country Club while in Better Burger, but not vice versa. Also if you have money to burn and feeling fancy Ostro in the seafarers is great, the architects have designed it to have a view of the city and the harbour from respective sides.  Getting a bit later 1885 is the place to really get a club experience, generally cover charge and a big queue though. But a fun time, I would consider it Auckland's premier club.  Anything near Fort St is generally full of backpackers, which can be fun, but not always the best. There's also Roxy (club) near by, but you may as well head to Britomart if your at Fort St.  Holy shit, I should be a party planner."

auckland,337c58,MA3LK,2,Mon Apr 20 09:28:09 2015 UTC,what's up with the guy and the dalmatian?
auckland,337c58,bee3,12,Mon Apr 20 05:52:09 2015 UTC,"He used to busk outside my old workplace and that's how I met him. Started seeing him everywhere and over the next few months we got on a first name basis, knew about each others lives and had each others phone number etc. He was always friendly and down to earth. He wasn't homeless, he just liked the freedom of playing the guitar for a living.   About five months later (January 2012) I agreed to hang out with him (luckily I told a couple friends as a precaution) and long story short, he locked me in his car for five hours and told me really fucked up things, like ranting on about how much he wanted to smash his baby mamas face in (and how much he also loved her), how hot his cum was when he had anal for the first time two weeks earlier, how much he wanted to fuck me and make me his 277th girl, etc. All the prostitutes he'd fucked, how his baby mama fingered herself in front of him, all the people who had screwed him over. And so much more. He was getting seriously intense and kept leaning in and pressuring me. He kept insisting we were on a date despite me stating multiple times that it wasn't.   I was scared as shit because we were at Titirangi Beach and it was now midnight and I couldn't escape because he had the car and I didn't. I finally managed to convince him to take me home after playing up on being some sweet innocent virgin that still believed in true love so he wouldn't want to hurt the one innocent thing his life. Luckily it worked.   A few months later he cornered me in a takeaway shop in Glen Eden and ranted on at me about my mother who had died the month before. I started crying like a little bitch and other customers intervened to get him away from me.  I still see him every two months or so because we live in the same area. I haven't spoken to him since June 2012 but he remembers me and stares at me whenever I walk past. That's why I'm really wary of even asking this Queen St guy his name, just in case the friendliness is just a facade like with the dalmation guy."

auckland,337c58,melimalle,-1,Mon Apr 20 23:46:59 2015 UTC,I'm not reporting it as verbal assault because he never threatened me. I hear worse things from random catcallers on the street.   It also wasn't kidnapping because I willingly got in the car and he took me home the first time I asked him to. I just didn't ask him sooner because he was extremely intense and I didn't want to make things worse by him thinking another person in his life was abandoning him. I thought there was very real chance he'd put his hands on me if I did that so I only asked after he'd calmed down a lot.

With that hair you must be into Opeth, Dimmu Borgir sort of shit yea? reddit will love this social stereotyping"

And yeah to Opeth, not so much Dimmu Borgir though. I'm really into interesting stuff like Meshuggah, Gojira, Tool etc. I also really enjoy local acts. At least for the metal that is, I like all sorts of course. What about you?"
auckland,332g83,enginette,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:37:29 2015 UTC,"I'm the one giving the finger.  Yea I would consider Tool as my favourite band. You should check out a band called Jova on iheartradio, the unsigned bands station. They are very Tool-ish and quite cool. I like pretty mainstream stuff tbh as I don't really have muso friends anymore introducing me to cool new shit. So old favourites include Metallica, Pantera, Pink Floyd, Led Zep, Arctic Monkeys - particularly the old stuff, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, GNR, etc."

But yeah, it's probably one of Auckland's busiest gyms (talking about the Victoria Park one). It's pretty popular with the gym-fanatic types. If that's your thing then you'll probably love it. Not shitting on the culture at all but as someone who prefers a quiet, low-key workout I found Les Mills wasn't really for me. Each to their own etc.   If that's not your thing either you can probably find a smaller place that still has the Les Mills' classes as they license them to other gyms (all over the world actually). There's also a Les Mills down at Britomart but no idea what that's like."
auckland,32j8m7,Dildofaghands,2,Tue Apr 14 07:03:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my main hesitation. I am very much a regular gym goer, but I definitely prefer working out in peace and without selfies etc. Might look into some external classes though. Thanks!"
auckland,32j8m7,Dildofaghands,6,Tue Apr 14 07:52:02 2015 UTC,"So les mills is really good for classes, all free except rpm. They have recently dropped there rates to be more competitive, so unfortunately I couldn't tell you what they are at the moment. I know the one in britomart is 24 hours, however it's very very much the typical selfie addicted, posing for photos kind of place. I mean these people put in hard work so reap the rewards I say. I just don't know what your type of workout exercise preference is.   I go to the new lynn one and its friendly And reasonably quiet during the days. I'm heading down tomorrow and I know they're always sending out free trials vouchers, so as long as you haven't trailed at les mills before, I can try get a 2 week trial voucher for you to go and see what it's like. Before you commit. Go test the waters.   They also have awesome showers and saunas. Which are always a bonus."

auckland,32j8m7,nweatherburn,1 point,Tue Apr 14 09:26:47 2015 UTC,"I went to the Britomart Les Mills and absolutely loved it. I do powerlifting and their facilities are great: deadlift platform, great squat racks and great benches. The only thing that annoyed me was that there are a huge number of members and you'll find yourself fighting for equipment.   I've now moved to BodyTech which is 3x more expensive but thankfully I have a corporate discount so it's actually half the cost of Les Mills. They don't let you bang the weights such that it's difficult to go heavy on deadlifts without dropping the weight too hard.   So I guess Les Mills is great if you want to do heavy lifting but you must time your workouts carefully around rush hour."

They have heaps of different ones as well which is great for motivation levels (I feel ya).  I signed up for the 3 year contract which was the cheapest (somewhere between $20 and $30 per week from memory??) and I sold it with a year and a half to go on TradeMe. Check trademe for memberships as lots of people sell theirs when they move/go overseas etc.  The only thing I didn't like was the prancing show ponies (men) at the Vic Street one doing weights, and you have to walk right through them to get to the classes and they all stare at you like a piece of meat.  The staff sometimes came and talked to me when I was on a piece of equipment like cycling or cross trainer or whatever - just general chit chat like how are you how was your day what do you do bla bla - which is nice, but not when you're working out. When I work out I'm a hot mess and I def don't go there to make small talk, and I would prefer they leave me alone to sweat and wheeze in peace.  But classes = good. I knew of some people who ONLY went for the classes."

My student offspring got a student discount to attend and is surviving it they have a 6 month contract for students, just need student ID.

Better Burger does a quick and dirty impression of In n Out Burger that works great on a night out drinking - i.e. good, greasy and tasty.  Velvet Burger provides quality ingredients and provides decently sized burgers as well as other creative options.  Burger Fuel is pretty mediocre in my opinion, but they do have some inventive ingredient combinations.  The best by far, while in Ponsonby and a little expensive relative to the others, is Burger Burger. Their meat, quality of ingredients and overall deliciousness makes them the best burger joint in Auckland, hands down. They serve cracking shakes and great potato skins.  Special shout out to Big J's takeaways who do awesome burgers with cool ingredients at takeaway prices. They're also, unfortunately, out in Mt.

auckland,327fio,Iseeyou82,2,Tue Apr 14 10:53:12 2015 UTC,Personally what I would do without inflict much harm is to put chewing gum over her car door's keylock during midnight.  I did this to this cunt in my neighborhood for a month who had been a racing hoon on our street and enjoyed watching him trying to scrap the gum off for 30mins every morning untill he got the message and stopped his antics
auckland,327fio,datommyboy,2,Sun Apr 12 03:10:21 2015 UTC,"One guy drove into the front wall in front of my garden one night. I got his details and we agreed that he would pay for the wall repair after I organised some quotes. Suddenly became uncontactable when I forwarded the quotes. Looked into county court claim system and it's crazy, you have to pay for it (sure its more than $90 total), drawn out for weeks, with no guarantee of getting your money back even if you win (if bailiff goes to their listed house and they don't live their anymore, nothing you can do).  I ended up sending him a warning letter with an ultimatum pay the bill or I'll set the insurance company on you. He chose the latter and no doubt it will have cost him more than double the amount of debt to repay (insurance companies have more powers to debt collect immediately). I reported the incident with the insurance company within the first couple of days and asked them to hold on chasing until it was clear whether or not we were going to settle privately. Hope that helps"
auckland,327fio,localsworld,2,Sun Apr 12 02:14:36 2015 UTC,"Do you have contents insurance? If so, raise a claim under your insurance with all the details provided. For contents claims, when the insurance company is able to recover costs, the policy holder will have no change in premiums.  The potential issue you will have is that it appears you have repaired the bike already. Hopefully you have photo's taken immediately after, as if this was to head to the Disputes Tribunal, the referee will want as much evidence of damage as possible.  Simply using the invoice from the repair will not be sufficient. Also, if a third party is liable, they ought to be given the opportunity to see three quotes for the repair and even seek quotes themselves based on a damage report. This stops people claiming for hundreds of dollars of repairs for something that could cost a few dollars, but will also take into account preferred repairers.   Keep in mind, DT costs $90 to apply if I recall and you can not claim this cost back.  Best avenue at this point is to contact your insurer (please say you have contents insurance..)."
auckland,327fio,somebodyalwaysknows,2,Sun Apr 12 03:02:05 2015 UTC,"I'm the vindictive type and recommend the following: epoxy their car door locks and windows shut. 5 minute araldite does the trick. If you really feel like screwing with them, do the same to their house. That'll cost them more than 90 bone, and many many hours of their time.  But straight up, making a claim through insurance may not be worth the trouble. You might lose your no-claims bonus crap. I had a motorcycle accident with some inattentive bitch in a company car a while ago. Not my fault, but she worked for a corporate who decided to try and blame me for the accident (or maybe she spun the story with her superiors). I had to file a claim with my insurance company to fight theirs. It was either that or go to court against it myself. So now I now have to pay an additional $200 a year in insurance for an accident that I didn't cause.

Windy as shit (curves not wind) so you can lean in and have a thrilling ride without needing to exceed the limit. Never boring, like your interstates. Low enforcement levels. Only thing is it's a lot more expensive to hire a bike than a car. Starting at NZ$150 per day for a 250-650 up to $250-300 per day for a big Harley with saddle bags. So if you're here for a month or more, it might be better to buy and organise a guaranteed buy-back from a dealer. They might sting you a couple of grand difference in the buy price but it'll probably be cheaper than 2 weeks renting. Otherwise, assuming you're flying into Auckland, best value rental is Wild Freedom Motorcycle Rentals in Henderson (30 mins from the airport). I think he'll do a V-Strom 650 for $155 per day with saddle bags. That's plenty of grunt here for you and a passenger and a damn cosy smaller touring bike. Small business, I think he only has 4 or 5 bikes so for a longer rental he'll probably do you a special deal.  Licence-wise, we have a separate motorcycle licence system here, but so long as you're licenced to drive in your home state or it comes under your car licence then that's fine for up to a year. Insurance is typically cheaper on a bike than a car as you typically just write your own vehicle/self off. Also there is no health insurance requirement here. If you bang yourself up we do our best to fix you for free, called ""ACC"" and covers foreigners too. Please note also that we drive on the left!"

auckland,323kb9,chocfish,2,Fri Apr 10 08:04:06 2015 UTC,"I've lived in an apartment in the city and I can say the property manager had very little interaction with us. One or two inspections; nothing else, I would struggle to justify paying the property manager an amount each week for the work they do especially if you plan to live in Auckland while you could do the inspections yourself.  The one thing you may want to use a property manager for however is to find tenants; they will get the letting fee but it saves you the hassle of advertising the place and meeting with those who wish to rent there plus I can guarantee you will be contacted a lot for viewings.  You could alternatively get them to manage it for a short term period; say 2 to 3 months and judge for yourself after that if a) it's worth it and b) the tenants care for the place.  Side question: how many bedrooms and how much you looking to rent the place out for? I currently reside in parnell and am curious how much other places around here are going for."

When I purchased a couple of years ago, the rental appraisal said $350-$420, but when I took a nosy at another apartment in my building recently their rental appraisal was $500-$550 for a smaller apartment, so I'm guessing it'll probably be around the $450 mark."

In fact a lot of things we do would be considered rude in Brazil.    Speak a mild amount of Portuguese so I have a few brazillian friends and all of them are wildly depressed. The sex is always terrible, you guys tend to hate the food as it's either to expensive or doesn't suite the brazillian palette. Also Kiwis rarely get excited over things and complain a lot like middle class England which again tends to bum out alot of brazillians since you guys are normally extremely passionate about a lot of things. Also we can't party like you do, a normal brazillian party that goes for 3 days straight with 2 hours sleep would probably kill most Kiwis. Just be prepared for the culture shock and remember new zealand is a giant retirement village with 3/4 of kiwi youth leaving to go overseas until around the age 30ish mark."

auckland,31wr6h,yourderogatory,0,Thu Apr 9 10:24:00 2015 UTC,"And I agree to an extent, however there have been a lot more Spanish immigrants over the past 20 years etc. Than Portuguese speaking migrants considering there's mainly just brazil a Portugal while Spanish is 4th most spoken language in the world.  But it's sort of like saying oh your Hong Kong or Singapore Chinese you'll get along famously with these Beijing or China Chinese. Which is not the case in most circumstances considering the cultural gap.  Brazillians and Portuguese also have very different cultures, food and even language. Also it depends on what part of Brazil you come from because there's those who live near the amazon, those that leave near southern brazil, those that leave near the northern parts. Those that live in Rio those that came from farvellas and those that live in Sao Paulo. All have reasons to not enjoy or enjoy each others company. If you lump them all together like some kind of ghetto and assume they should all get along it tends to not end well.  What I was mentioning before wasn't going into specifics either, those are just general issues that majority of brazillians have coming over here and not even the smaller things that tend to pop up.   And having to come to a new country and segregate yourself from the locals just to enjoy people's company is not ideal."

As for the affection, yeh it is extremely different from what you would be used to.   For instance just walking up and touching/grasping girl's in nightclubs would be considered taboo, however in brazil that's mainly how you would greet somebody or attempt to create a connection with somebody.   Also ODA(Open Displays of Affection) of a brazillian standard in a lot of place's is not exactly practiced, Not exactly wrong just a lot of kiwi's are shy to do so.   Kiwi's are nice people and will always help you out, But very small town minded and tend to more recently be a lot more conservative. Which means gossipy, whiney and passive aggressive if you do something wrong by kiwi standards(So you will never know if you have pissed them off you will just sort of be outcasted). And there's a huge exposition on social Hierarchy, it's who you know not what you know.   If it's nature your after, i would probably suggest Coromandel, Mt Manganui or the South island for living. Most of the north island is farmland and the nicest beach's/Area's are usually owned by some older lineage family or are sacred maori or would just be way to expensive to live in regards to having a job and commuting(Bay of Isles etc.)."

Rent depending on where you live I am west Auckland and in a shared house I pay $160 a week including expenses food you can go cheap from shopping at markets or expensive by eating out. Alone I spend give or take $100 a week which includes cooking at home and going out a few times a week Health insurance as you are an international you will have to get Health insurance from your home. There is a good company that I used when I was travelling overseas http://www.worldnomads.com/ They are good if you run out you can renew while overseas. Most insurance companies won't allow you too.  Gym - I pay $7 a week at City fitness, they have great prices. That price doesn't included classes but I don't use them anyway.   other expenses would be transport around Auckland. Most Aucklanders have a car. But if you live in the City and work in the city you can use buses or walk. I spend about $40 a week on transport.     Any other questions give me a shout.  Also coming to NZ if someone invites you over and says bring a plate, they don't mean just bring a plate. It means bring a dish of food. Every Brazilian (or anyone not from NZ) gets really confused by that!"

So I suggest if you get a job out of the city, to live near there. The trains are getting better though.  Most Aucklanders live outside of the city and work in town.

I'm thinking about a two or three bedroom house, not on the best part of town but not on a bad one also."
auckland,31wr6h,Hubris2,3,Thu Apr 9 00:13:14 2015 UTC,I was paying about $400 a week for a 1 bedroom free standing house in Onehunga with a reasonably sized backyard.
auckland,31wr6h,S0CIOPATH,2,Thu Apr 9 00:45:22 2015 UTC,Hard to say exactly. Each area is different further away from the city the less you pay.  I pay $420 for a three bedroom house including water rates. I am almost in west Auckland (Avondale) where if you were to live in grey Lynn Ponsonby you would easily pay double that. But the houses would most likely be a lot flasher as well  Your best bet is to look on www.trademe.co.nz  If you are not sure on the area ask and I will let you know if it is good.
auckland,31wr6h,steev506,2,Thu Apr 9 00:56:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth mentioning that utilities (water, power, and internet (if you've arranged it)) are often separate costs from rent.  $400 a week can cover rent and utilities in outer central suburbs for 1 person, with access to $5 public transport to town, or $25 taxi.  Chicken is more expensive than beef in NZ.  I believe you can eat healthily for an average of $6 per meal.  Gym memberships range from $7 - $25 a week, for basics."

Then Die and Krust got really drunk, drinking bubbles out of the bottle and passing it round the crowd like we were all in a park or something. They were dancing in the crowd too, taking turns spinning. Die played some hip hop and got booed by some purists, including Krust.

auckland,31q5og,EndlessOcean,11,Tue Apr 7 09:20:26 2015 UTC,"The Grove is damned good, Baduzzi is also really good with a great atmosphere but isn't terribly 'high-end', more of an informal slurp-your-spaghetti kinda place but the spaghetti just happens to be peerless. They also have a really good dessert guy, Pablo, (whose name isn't Pablo) who makes some really avant garde stuff that looks like modern art on a plate.  Depot is decent, The Grill does amazing meat dishes in a classy space, decent service and very easy to get to. Masu is just over the street and I like it just fine but I do think it's a little overpriced. the open kitchen is cool though and if you're interested and polite you can lean over and talk shop with the chefs.  The Sugar Club is great for memorable evenings. The view is the best in the city given that it's 52 floors up but you need to book it quite far ahead, especially if you're looking at weekends. But the food is great, the menu changes frequently and it's not as wanky as you might presume.  Clooneys is great. Des is a top top chef and one of the nicest guys you could meet. The staff there are probably the best trained I've encountered. They're knowledgeable, polite, discrete, and they're one of only two places in NZ to have their own wine master on staff (at Clooneys it's a guy called Gary)... a wine master is like a sommelier but can spout way more bullshit and it's a pretty prestigious gig. So if you want to impress someone, Clooney's would get my vote and they do a sweet as degustation thing for around $90 where you get to try a little bit of everything. If you go there ask if Des has any black garlic handy and if you can try some, he was raving about it when I last met up with him."
