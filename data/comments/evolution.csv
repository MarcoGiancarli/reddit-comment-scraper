evolution,3e4ab2,rubystarfruit,6,Tue Jul 21 21:08:07 2015 UTC,"Short answer: yes.  Long answer: depends on whether we're talking about old school, conventional, paraphyletic Artiodactyla or a relatively recent, new-fangled, monophyletic Artiodactyla.  Cetaceans are definitely nested within Artiodactyla according to abundant molecular and morphological data.  However, some people still consider Cetacea and Artiodactyla to be separate orders, making Artiodactyla paraphyletic.  When Artiodactyla is made monophyletic (i.e. that the clade is defined as all the descendants of the artiodactyl common ancestor), whales are included.  Since this nests an order within another order, some people have proposed the clade Cetartiodactyla replace to Artiodactyla."
evolution,3e4ab2,Melivora_capensis,2,Tue Jul 21 22:21:59 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's a great explanation, and it mostly makes sense to my stunted, liberal arts brain. Thank you!  If I can ask a follow-up, am I to assume that this phylogenetic chart, with Cetaceans nested pretty deeply within Artiodactyl is less correct than this one, which keeps Cetaceans on the outskirts, where it could be lopped off to make its own category?"
evolution,3e4ab2,AnecdotallyExtant,4,Tue Jul 21 22:50:56 2015 UTC,"You're not going to believe this, but those two trees are pretty much identical; I think not totally identical, but pretty much. With a phylogenetic tree you can always rotate the branches at any node and the tree will be identical. So you can see in the larger tree if you started rotating things around at different nodes you'd be able to get the Cetacea towards the center of the diagram without too much trouble."
evolution,3e4ab2,AnecdotallyExtant,2,Tue Jul 21 23:27:06 2015 UTC,Ooooohhhh... Very interesting! Thanks for the clarification. I have to study these better and try to wrap my head around this.
evolution,3e4ab2,Phylogenizer,5,Tue Jul 21 23:36:36 2015 UTC,Phylogenetics is one of the best parts of the modern science of evolution!!    It takes old ideas like Linnean taxonomy and turns them on their head. Now we put things together in their family trees rather than just lumping similar looking things together. And suddenly you have orcas hanging out with giraffes.     But the coolest part is that there is only one illustration in the Origin. Darwin included this sketch in his book and it really took the rest of us around another 100 years to really catch up on that one.

evolution,3e0py5,Ripsyd,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:39 2015 UTC,"You probably already know this, but I'm just lecturing to the general audience...   Humans are omnivores, so we can exploit both worlds of digesting meat or vegetable matter. We scrounge, similar to raccoons.  We aren't terribly good at digesting vegetable matter, since our digestive tract isn't optimal for it, Vegetable matter is harder to break down, so a long and large digestive tract is required, Horses, cows, and gorillas are good examples of creatures that have a long digestive tract for the vegetarian lifestyle. Lugging that big digestive system around requires a large gut.  And we aren't really well evolved to be a carnivore, either. No long claws or long canines like wolves or cats.  Studies of extant human tribes living the primitive lifestyle show extremes of some cultures living 90% or more on vegetable matter, to some that survive mostly off meat. We eat what is available."
evolution,3e0py5,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:22 2015 UTC,"I would contest the notion of 'we aren't really well evolved to be a carnivore'. I don't think long claws and canines are necessary for predator classification. Our cerebral capabilites (neural hardware optimised for hunting strategy, inclination for tool/weapon making), stamina and musculoskeletal physiology (humans are endurance/social hunters. we're not the fastest, but we can run down and outwit our prey) and our digestive physiology could potentially place us as carnivores. (of course there is the counterpoint that digestive physiology may well be indicative of scavenging behaviour). I'm no expert on these matters, but my understanding leads me to come to this view point.  But your point of 'We eat what is available.' is a very good one and one I am also inclined to agree with. Perhaps our brain capabilities just make humans flexible in this regard. probably a result of being omnivorously inclined. I dunno. Hard to say without more knowledge I guess."
evolution,3e0py5,CN14,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Humans are what I call ""the incompetent ape""... we don't have the standard tools of a predator, so I believe we make up for the standard tool set of teeth and claws by making stone ones. I like the idea that during this switchover from herbivore towards carnivore might be a evolutionary pathway to increased brain size, to compensate for our incompetence.   The brain is a tool that has allowed us to remain physically incompetent. Sounds kind of good, huh? No real proof, though. I like it."
evolution,3e0py5,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:00 2015 UTC,"The brain is a tool that has allowed us to remain physically incompetent   evolutionary trade offs bruh. Why waste energy optimising canines and claws when we have a better solution? We can use fire to cook our food and make it easier to eat - the knife will cut up our food. What small canines we do have can do the rest. Those tool making skills can be put to other uses too. Though it would be a great leap to assume all these skills came about together.  I also think our social behaviour is worth including in the conversation. That no doubt influenced early hominin dietary tendencies. In what way, I am not entirely sure."
evolution,3e0py5,CN14,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"Some of the earlier fossils and archaeological evidence (about 4+ million years ago) shows that the fossils and very primitive stone tools were used, early in our evolution. This gives credence to the idea that our reliance on the use of those tools gave no selective advantage to our acquisition of carnivorous claws and teeth. Just as you mention above, why bother if the problem is solved by tools?  Chimps can make tools also, but with their vegetarian diet they don't really need them as much as we do. We need to cut and dig and smash... they just pluck some vegetation and eat it. I think the radical change in the environment of our ancestors created the dire need for these tools, we are so incompetent in our new environment.  I've worked a bit in primate research, and one thing I saw was that chimps have the ability to make tools more sophisticated than the currently do, but just don't give a damn. Humans seems to be creators and hoarders of tools. Chimps don't do that, as soon as they are done with tool they normally cast it aside.   I worked for Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and her team for a while, and saw some amazing things, and got to know some amazing chimps (bonobos)."
evolution,3e0py5,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:19 2015 UTC,"It is my understanding that chimps use basic stick tools to extract termites from mounds, and some primates, including but not limited to chimps, use rocks to smash nut shells. I think some new world monkeys also smash shellfish with rocks, though I may be mistaken. This makes sense, as proteins and termites are no doubt highly nutritious and a good source of protein/salts/fats. i only really know this from watching David Attenborough documentaries haha.  that's real cool that you've done actual research in the field. What was the focus of the research?  (Also, I'm pretty sure Bonobos are recognised as distinct from chimpanzee's now.)"
evolution,3e0py5,CN14,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:39 2015 UTC,"Sue worked with the common chimps (Pan troglodytes) and also with the bonobo (Pan paniscus). Her research was mostly on cognitive abilities, so it was pretty fascinating. The bonobos have a much more mellow temperament and are easier to work with. The wikipedia page mentions her working with two bonobos, but she worked with many more than that, and had what she called a ""colony"".  One experiment was if you taught a chimp how to make stone tools, would they learn it, would they develop on it, and would they pass the knowledge down? She found they would easily learn it, didn't seem interested in all at developing the idea further, would show other apes how to do it, but had a real lackadaisical attitude about the whole thing and would just chuck the tool in the weeds when they were done.  These chimps don't seem to have the necessity of stone tools in their native habitat. They don't seem to see it as very valuable to do these things. Lack of motivation seems to be the major issue, not lack of skill or intelligence.  One common chimp was in a cage, and saw a workman working on the cage with an adjustable crescent wrench. He reached over and stole the tool, and when the workman went away, the chimp disassembled the cage with the wrench, and was found sitting in a pile of parts later on.  I designed a RF wireless keyboard for talking to the bonobos. It was all Sues idea, I was just following orders. The researchers talked to the apes through this keyboard and the conversations were captured to a computer and video.  Sue did an experiment about passing on learning and on how much they could communicate through their vocal speech. She created an exciting event of having one of the bonobos go for a walk at the lake, and a researcher dressed up as a ""monster"", and ran around the lake. When the bonobo was taken back to the colony, he was put in a room and another bonobo was put in the adjacent room, so they couldn't see each other. There was a lot of hooting and screaming, then the other bonobo was taken out and questioned with the keyboard. This ape that didn't see the event knew what happened. A monster was at the lake!  I really hated leaving that job."
evolution,3e0py5,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:29 2015 UTC,"Oppss... one more thing.  The larger brain isn't necessarily devoted towards us becoming a carnivore (since we aren't one), but it does make us a more potent scrounger, like the raccoon. It makes us a better omnivore."

We may not be exclusively carnivorous, , but we can be predatory/hunters - and I believe that's the core subject of OP's question. Just like many bears I guess - omnivorous, but top predators. I dont think I made that distinction earlier and that muddied what I was trying to say.  You're absolutely right, though, we're not good carnivores, because there's no need. We eat what we can (as you said), and plants and stuff can fulfill some of (if not most) the nutrient deficit."
evolution,3e0py5,CN14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"People psychologically want to be ""predators"", but we really aren't.  There is an admiration of predators that borders on something like an instinctual religious belief. Our life style is more like raccoons, as I mentioned.  Sometimes I call humans predatory monkeys when I'm in a bad mood. =-}  But animals are classified as herbivore, omnivore, and carnivore. Predator and prey is a game they play while hunting, but isn't really a classification of the animal.  So the question, properly worded, should be ""Have herbivores ever evolved to become Carnivores?""."
evolution,3e0py5,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree. How would an early human who hunted their prey using a spear/club not be a predator? How we classify the modern, settlement dwelling human may be a different matter, but looking at it from an evolutionary perspective i struggle to see the reasoning here.   People psychologically want to be ""predators"", but we really aren't.   Like, why aren't we? Haven't humans historically hunted food? Didn't early humans hunt mammoths? A grizzly bear is a omnivore but it hunts salmon. It is the predator to the salmon. The terms predator/prey describe an ecological relationship, not necessarily a full run down of their digestive biology.  I do not agree that herbivore vs carnivore necessarily equals predator vs prey for these reasons. - they're 2 different questions."
evolution,3e0py5,CN14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:05 2015 UTC,"Omnivores can hunt. The word ""predator"" is a behavior, not really a classification of a species. This question would be more understandable if people used the classification rather than the behavior. That is why I keep mentioning herbivore, omnivore, carnivore.  Raccoons go frog hunting, and that omnivore is acting as predator in that behavior. It is fun to watch them, because they sometimes fall in the water while trying to catch the frogs.  Chimps are mostly herbivore, but they sometimes will go hunting, and act as a predator, because that is how the predator-prey game is played. But they seldom do this, and it is not a significant contribution to their diet, so they are still a herbivore."

evolution,3e17cg,redlawnmower,5,Tue Jul 21 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"It's very tempting to ascribe evolutionary reasons to all sorts of behaviors. It's one reason why pseudo-scientific evolutionary psych seems to be all the rage. Somehow every little thing can be traced back to our caveman days?  DBSmiley already mentioned that sleep schedules are heavily based on non-genetic factors. For the sake of discussion, let's assume genetics do play a major role. Scientifically, where can you go from here? First, for something to be a hypothesis it needs to be testable. Just wonder, ""It might be possible that..."" isn't enough. Try to think of a way to test and demonstrate evidence. Maybe late sleep schedules among this age group is practically universal. That'd definitely be a start, but it doesn't necessarily prove that it's genetic, let alone that this habit came about to guard against predators.  Okay, let's tackle the genetics bit next. Maybe you find certain young people who don't seem to stay up late. You sequence parts of their genome and compare it with wild-type (i.e. ""normal"") individuals and...success! You find a specific difference related to a particular sleep-related gene amongst the individuals. Expanding your investigations leads to find definitive evidence that staying up late has a major genetic component.  Great, but that's not all you were saying. How do we prove this is because younger people were better able to guard at night? This is where the issue gets much hairier.   It's hard to discount other reasons for staying up late. Maybe younger people were more likely to do paleolithic version of late night partying and hooking up. That'd certainly be one way to pass on your genes. Maybe staying up late was a good time to hone your skills at carving stone spears and axes or discussing hunting strategy. Who knows? As you can imagine, it's not trivial to come up with ways to test this. It's not hard to find reasons against staying up late. Young people in their physical primes would also be really useful to have around in all the other survival activities, like hunting and gathering. Imagine if your fastest hunters or best gatherers were asleep for half the day. No matter how many nights are successfully guarded, starvation would still suck. And besides, humans already had one of the best predator prevention tools: fire.   Genomes are incredibly complex. Wires get crossed all the time and a gene for one particular trait may by chance be linked to a gene for something completely different. Even if staying up late was genetic, it might have just become as prevalent as it is by chance, there are several ways this can happen. Sorry to blast you with this wall of text, but I figured some of the stuff might be food for thought."

Nitpicky, and I agree with all you say otherwise. I really believe the simple but fundamental concept of testability could be taught at a very early age as it is almost intuitive, and I hypothesise that it can in fact help tremendously with learning in general as it gives a good framework for rational, results driven, and critical thinking. Yet I have met many university educated people who were blind to this."

Test and repeatability of results are needed to filter out conjectures from possible theories. Otherwise a mythology builds up that is just pseudo-science.  So how could this be tested? We can't test ancient civilization, so we could test what happens in cultures that still lead a life in wild environments.  The hormone melatonin is released by the body when the lights go dim. and the melatonin causes sleepiness. Comparing the melatonin release in young vs. old people might give clues.  Hypothesis like this often don't have a smoking gun evidence available, and rely on piling up supporting evidence. It is like a jury trial, you need to pile up so much evidence that it silences critics, and hope the somebody in the future doesn't come along and find some powerful evidence to sway the jury in the other direction."

evolution,3e17cg,seldor,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:44 2015 UTC,"A strong argument against any nocturnal hypothesis is that we have one of the worst night visions of the mammals. Stumbling around in the dark would be a good way to be injured or eaten. Also, how would they find food if they can't see anything?  Humans get sleepy when the lights go dim. This is nature's way of telling humans to stop their activities and seek shelter.  Most birds are like this. When the lights go dim, a lot of bird species become almost catatonic. People who keep birds know this trick, to catch a bird you wait till dark (or turn off the lights) and then just slowly pick them up. It seems like they are stunned by the darkness. This is likely an adaptation because flying at night with poor night vision would be dangerous. Don't try this with birds like owls, because they do have good night vision and they are most active at dusk, and you might get bit."

No matter how right or wrong you think that hypothesis is, how do you even go about testing it? Is it even possible?  Also, yeah, science is always going to have a political underpinning, as they'll try to leverage it when it supports their narrative, and discredit it when it goes against their narrative. It's like saying global warming is just a political ploy because the liberals can leverage it to push their ideology of taking care of the planet.

Granted.     3) Scientists study the evolutionary origins of animal behavior, right? Isn't that what the field of ethology is?     Not really. Ethology is more descriptive of patterns that exist and how those patterns affect the ecology and evolution of the animal. It's not at all an attempt to retrospectively assign a speculative reason for the evolution of the behavior, and it's never assumed that a given behavior is adaptive.       4) No doubt some enthusiasts of evo psych have socio-political motivations, but I'd be surprised if this didn't apply to it's critics as well.      This may well be true. But those are not my motives. And I am criticizing the field.     But I want to be very clear about something. If the field was called Adaptationist Psychology I would have had no solid criticisms prior to a recent conversation with a student of Evo Psych. That conversation has led me to believe that the student in question has been taught a mythos surrounding a particular evolutionary biologist who was instrumental in ending the adaptationist paradigm and was also openly critical of evo psych.     From what I gleaned from that conversation, he's been taught what could only be called blatant lies and propaganda. And it seems like a strange coincidence that his conception would be so skewed against a biologist who happened to have been critical of evo psych.      Outside of that, admittedly sparse and potentially false bit of information, it would be fine if only re-branded to reflect the adaptationist paradigm that is no longer accepted in evolutionary literature."

Otherwise people could have come to the thread and believe that on the basis of authority.  I believe that, as people with a training in science, we have some duty to justify what we say when requested. Especially for you, whose ""Sexual Selection"" flair advertises you as someone who is involved in making science. If you don't bother justifying your claims when requested to do so, then you are free to promote basically any kind of nonsense on the basis of an authority argument.

The linked article notes research that traits are encoded in the maximum number of ways possible, reflecting this principle of robustness.  It doesn't say, but inferrs, that a trait that for some reason could not be encoded in multiple ways would be less advantageous, and selected against.  (There would be no more direct way to test that proposition, short of developing a viable alternative evolutionary path in the lab or a supercomputer - and even eperiment that would still probably just spit back whatever assumptions you put into it.)  Now, this seems to me like an entirely different principle from survival of the fittest.  When you look at a fitness function you only see fitness - no traits.  Common traits might in fact be spread all over that diagram.  The concept of entropy in physics means the number of microstates per macrostate (i.e. per trait).  It's not based in calculus, as we usually think of fitness."

There are some proteins that are used in metabolic processes that have low tolerance to variation, so mutation just means the organism dies. The gene for encoding it is required because the protein is required and it has low allowable variability, so it can't be selected out. The gene is persistent and static in the population by fitness selection. These types of proteins and genes are the ones that you see persist over long periods of time and through many branches of evolution, they can't find a way to permutate.  I can see that if a species was tolerant to losing a trait, then having less redundancy for keeping that trait would mean the trait is more likely to be lost. The redundancy and redundancy with variability do create robustness of persistence."

A way to control for taxonomy could be introduced as well, because controlling for size/weight only could be biased by biodiversity and then we'd have to start messing with the median and variance and stuff. Average ratio for a size group per time period.

I think Tyrannosaurs lost a finger and gained small arms to get rid of the need for a good sense of balance and house a more intelligent brain. I think they might have been smarter than raptors. They're already considered more intelligent than most of the raptors. Birds are smaller than us and require smaller brains to function. They also don't really require fine motor skills. They just need to grab stuff with their beaks and claws. Most can't make complex noises and don't require high control over that. Grey parrots can and they have pretty large brains for small birds. In addition, problem solving abilities alone don't define intelligence or sentience. I included sentience in the description to avoid that issue.

While larger animals can house larger brains, it doesn't mean they always do, nor is it always true that a larger brain is equal to higher intelligence, such as antiquarian_bookworm pointed out. I think it is a fair point that fewer need for motor skills requires less brain power. I do however not see the connection between intelligence and motor skills, I view them as separate.   You would have to give me a definition of sentience so I can understand what you mean with that. If you mean consciousness, there's some evidence for non-mammals to (possibly) have that.  Also please note, I am not an authority on evolution, I am merely interested in the subject.   And I personally have a problem with the whole concept of intelligence, there has been a better understanding (like that study), but the concept remains vague.

About fine motor skills - I meant that if we assume T-rex has only the bare minimum of fine motor skills required to survive, then we can assume that its brain, which hasn't decreased in size along with the decrease in fine motor skills, basically has more ""space"" to house other functions such as increased intelligence. T-rex didn't really need to manipulate objects, it just needed to follow prey, kill it, not fall down while trying to eat it, carry food to babies quickly and without making itself vulnerable, and maybe sleep. This requires more planning and keeping track of multiple things than intricate dances and finger movements. This makes mating the riskiest endeavor, maybe requiring a tree for support."

So you're not going to find any steady increase within the arthropods. And you wont find any trend within the mollusks. Really all reptiles are not the cognitive titans that the bird can be.     Once you throw in the birds and mammals you'll see an apparent trend through time that could be fit with a linear regression and it would look really good at first.    But then you actually have correct the data for the mammals and the birds. It's very clear that the mammals are of greater intelligence than nearly any other creature on the planet, so it would represent a significant skew in your results if you just threw them all in there without correcting the data.

Someone asked me a few years when the bugs would take over the world. If you think about, they've ruled the world for very long time. Look at your own yard. Assuming you're still living in ruffed grouse territory, your yard is probably visited by maybe a dozen species of bird, we'll throw three rodents in there, even chuck in the domestic dog and cat, then, I'll assume you're at the south end of the grouse's range so you may get frequented by a few reptiles.     All told, including humans, throwing in some odd things like bats, you'll get no more than say 25 species of vertebrates in your yard ever.       You'll be able to find that many species of insects in any given tree, or on any given bush at any given time. Through time, while your yard gets visited by a couple dozen vertebrates, you're probably housing around 10,000 - 20,000 species of insect.      One in every six species is a beetle. That's world wide, across phyla, plants and animals. One in six is a beetle.      And, as it turns out, each of those beetles probably has a specialist parasitoid wasp that feeds only on it. And those wasps specialize on all insects. So there are even more wasps than there are beetles.     And even weirder; the insects were already in charge when the dinosaurs started to think they were cool.     While the dinos thought they were in charge of the place the insects reshaped the entire planet by deciding that they liked flowers. It only took the insects 20 million years to cover the planet in flowers and eliminate entire higher level clades of other plants.      When the dinos died out, the insects shrugged it off. As the mammals have come to think they're pretty cool, the insects wait. They eat us. They use us to spread around the world.

An increase in body size came with an increase in specialization which often requires an increase in intelligence.  I think that this is why small dinosaurs went extinct. Despite being small, they were to specialized to adapt.

evolution,3dqrdn,AnecdotallyExtant,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"they were too specialized to adapt   Yes, when a species becomes dependent on a specific resource, to the exclusion of all else, it has climbed out onto a precarious limb. If the limb gets weak, then extinction.  A generalist species has better odds during an extinction event, because they draw their resources from many sources. It is like a gambler who hedges his bets, to play safe.  One of the old theories about who made it through the KT event was that it was burrowing animals who were generalists, hiding underground from the climate change and scrounging for any food, and birds that could fly over long distances to find scattered and scarce resources. Dinosaurs didn't do these things. Except didn't I read some years ago that somebody found a burrowing dino? Well, it was probably rare for them to do that, while mammals had a history of burrowing and scrounging."

That is why I'm talking about overall population within a size range.  If we take taxonomy into account, then we'd have to look at mammals of every size. Then we would notice a large increase, since a larger body can hold a larger brain. These two results together can demonstrate a confirmation."
evolution,3dqrdn,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:10:51 2015 UTC,Body size is another thing that the data would need to be corrected for. If I understand your question you're wondering about a a sort-of linear increase through time?

I'm wondering where the connection comes from?     But, just to add some useful info; I'd think cephalopods would have been the first intelligent animals to appear and they showed up during the Cambrian, but most of those early forms were wiped out in subsequent extinction events and I think there was only one group left at the beginning of the Silurian. And I know that Ammonites really appeared around the beginning of the Devonian.     So this group was going through a lot of extinction and changes. Anyway, may want to look into those."

An increase in body size came with an increase in specialization which often requires an increase in intelligence.  I think that this is why small dinosaurs went extinct. Despite being small, they were to specialized to adapt.

evolution,3dmgbk,JurijFedorov,15,Fri Jul 17 13:40:25 2015 UTC,"It is a really cool picture.   HOWEVER, I think it is necessary to emphasize that evolution does not work that way. I think a better representation should be in the form of some sort of phylogenetic tree, as the different species portrayed did not progress one into the other, but are just different ramifications in the whole tree, as observed here.   Although really nice, that picture implies two common misconceptions: 1) humans as some sort of evolutionary pinnacle, and 2) human coming from monkeys or apes when in reality we just really are another ape species. This second misconception could be the source of the infamous ""if we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?""  Now, I don't say this to discourage you from making more images or to say that this image is bad because it's inaccurate. On the contrary, I do it because, as you mentioned, it is a source of inspiration/information for making a better one, in this case with more accurate information.   I really want to emphasize that I don't want to come out as an ass, sorry if I do. I only want to be helpful as much as I can. :)"

What you imply is that I should have added other species to that did not progress into humans? The image I uploaded is correct. It does not imply that evolution works in a line - that's something you read from it - which it does not say. The misconception is really not blamed on a image like this. It is blamed on ignorance and not seeking out information. I can't tell everything about evolution in one single picture. If someone finds it interesting they have to look up other pictures or texts too - I encourage that.  Here is a picture that you are asking about - it already exists. It just has added species that are now extinct: http://s3.amazonaws.com/edcanvas-uploads/107988/local/1374147820/1362626618-human-evolution.jpg

evolution,3dmgbk,Angiru14,4,Sat Jul 18 11:35:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, but those extinct species are the members of the evolutionary tree that displays human evolution. We have to remember that evolution is as much as the species that evolved as the ones who didn't. It is also a process in which we observe divergence (speciation) from common ancestors, not progress from one species into another. The second image that you posted IS the timeline of hominid (not human, as H. sapiens is just one branch in the tree) is evolution, the march of progress is not.   Also, in the march of progress many of the species displayed DID NOT evolved into Homo sapiens, as it displays, for example, lemurs, which share a common ancestor with primates, but their divergence (not progress) happened about 60 millions years ago (more or less), way long before the evolution of humans (and Hominids). The same for examples that include images of chimpanzees in the picture.   My point is that, even though The March of Progress is a really cool image, and perhaps the most common thing people think about when they think of evolution, it not an accurate representation of the actual evolutionary relationships in human evolution (or any of the other observed species for that matter). My main critique it about its use for such explanations.

But this pic illustrates the process FROM Homo sapiens to the prehistoric fish - not from the fish forward. This is why Homo sapiens is the first in the timeline. We go backwards - and then show how the progress went. If we keep this in mind I think  it is very useful."

It is whole point of the image. However it does so incorrectly by not being clear on the concept of common ancestry, which sort of explains the relationships between the species displayed. Even if we look from humans to fishes it's still a bit misleading because we did not came from those fishes, we shared a COMMON ANCESTOR, that's the key concept here. Thus, simply looking backwards does not show progress (of which there is none, is just evolutionary change.   Also, both natural and sexual selection can select for or select against.

Just because the ratty creature from 100 million years ago looks like a current species does not mean that that ancestor is an extant species. There is 100 million years of evolution between the ratty creature then and the modern rat, in exactly the same way as there is 100 million years of evolution between that ratty creature and the human.    I don't read much Dawkins, but I doubt even he would use that kind of image.    He used the idea of a progression of ""photographs"" showing individuals from our distant ancestors to today. It's a great way to think about it.    That's why we adopted the phylogenetic tree decades ago.    The phylogenetic  tree is just another way of looking at it. It is also just an abstraction, and it also could be misleading if combined with incorrect teaching.   There is a single, uninterrupted line of individuals going back in time from you  to that ratty creature 100 million years ago.

And furthermore I see nothing wrong with the animation used in Cosmos, apart from the fact that it is out of date.   The phylogenetic tree is also an abstraction, and is also easy to misunderstand and misinterpret. Evolution is a difficult concept and it badly taught - we can both agree on that.

evolution,3dmgbk,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Sat Jul 18 01:04:06 2015 UTC,The timeline is very much incorrect. Nearly every image there is of an extant creature.     The correct timeline would have them all at the tips of branches.     They all exist today.

evolution,3dmgbk,SweaterFish,2,Sat Jul 18 09:01:51 2015 UTC,"Yes! Absolutely I have some suggestions about this. First I would reverse the order. This way it is not a march of progress toward humans.

I would use that as a jumping off point to create a new iconic image that doesn't give the wrong impressions.

Given the opportunity that image would my first priority. It is the single largest factor that has caused the most common and basic misconceptions.     All of that being said though, I'm not suggesting just changing it into a tree; I'm more suggesting that you use the MoP as a template, then kind of meld it with a tree like the this one that the other redditor linked.      It would be far more aesthetically pleasing, but would also be a vast improvement on the scientific accuracy of the image.      And using the MoP as a template would give an initial frame of reference that people will already recognize; so it would really be a very positive effect in showing the phylogeny.           I suggested reversing the order so it doesn't give such an impression of progress. Evolution doesn't progress. The idea of showing progress is one of the most fundamental problems with the image; it should show divergence instead.      (Edit: what I'm picturing would have humans on the left of the image and walking forward, over a hill kind-of toward the fish.)"
evolution,3dmgbk,Melkor_Morgoth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:00:58 2015 UTC,I will take a look at it. But I think maybe someone else should do it. As I think reversing the order would make it even more confusing. I get that some people might think that we come from chimpanzees but it is a very small minority of people and it is based on rumors they have heard not seeking out real knowledge. I'd say it is less than one in 10.000 that believes that in my country if even that. The worst thing is people not getting natural selection or not believing in evolution. But in 99% of the cases it is because their religion makes them dislike the evolutionary theory. So nothing can change their mind.
evolution,3dmgbk,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sat Jul 18 10:28:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe I can try to offer another suggestion that would also be scientifically accurate, would correct the gross inaccuracies of the other image but would also preserve the progressive nature of your image.      You said you're making more, and I assume you would plan to post them here. Would you consider? Rather than having a single lineage that uses extant animals to represent extinct ones.     First, obtain the correct ancestors; then your progressive kind of picture is no longer misleading. But also include other things with the human. So it would kind-of be like laying the tree on its side.     Then maybe at the correct node you could have a lineage for birds split off and trace its ancestry while it flies along above the human.         Then maybe have a dog diverge at the correct node and trace its ancestors as well, walking along side the man.     This would all:     Eliminate the incorrect sort of progression and substitute for it a scientifically valid idea of descent. It would illustrate the nature of divergence, rather than progression. Again, making it actually valid scientifically. It would also very well illustrate the commonality of animal ancestry."

This is why it is simple and will remain simple as the people I made it for are not users on this sub. Users here want complicated graphs and images and that's fair enough. But my goal is to make sure that even more people will learn about evolution. If professors don't like it they can make their own timelines!

As a very broad example, shifting diets from carnivorous to herbivorous or vis versa will change the entire ecology of an organism. From their niche to their reproductive strategies to their morphology. I can't for the life of me ever remember or find the organism I'm about to describe and if anyone here knows what I'm talking about I'd be forever in your debt if you tell me!! There is at the Utah Museum of Natural History a fossil of an animal from an herbivorous clade (I want to say Artiodactyl) that had become a carnivore. That's going to shift it's entire way of life. Territory size, litter size, offspring investment -- really everything would have changed compared to the rest of the clade.        But I actually have a better example from an extant animal. Someone recently asked about pandas in /r/askscience  and I'll copy my answer here:       The question was : ""Why do pandas eat bamboo?""     And my answer was:      Well, there's an answer, but it doesn't paint a great picture of the panda. It seems like it's the result of yet more panda incompetence ^(not my word choice, please don't hate me!) .      There was a pseudogenization of the umami receptor gene in pandas, which means that the gene for tasting umami became faulty and they stopped preferring meat. And there is also a defect in their dopamine reward system which makes them make poor food choices. Add a little adaptation to their poor choices and they gained the ability to better digest the bamboo. Source: PLOS One (2011)      The pseudogenization of its umami receptor gene T1R1 is coincident with such bamboo dietary switch. But there are probably other factors involved in such a switch...the dopamine metabolic system is probably not that competent in the giant panda      (Evolution does not seem to have been kind to this creature.)       The panda's entire ecology has changed a result of one gene becoming defective.        Diet will have profound impacts!"

Crows and parrots have large brains for their size, and are considered the geniuses of the bird class, but they mostly eat grain. Chimps and gorillas are mostly vegetarian.

Eating 2000 calories a day in just vegetables takes a long time to eat. Meat, especially cooked meat, allows us to get our daily requirement very quickly, freeing up time for other things.

That creates free time, but the question was does meat have anything to do with the evolution of brain power, and field data shows no correlation. The animals that are the smartest are not carnivores. Some people might declare an anti-correlation of meat and intelligence, but I wouldn't go that way either. It seems they are unrelated.  Parrots and crows both eat grain, which is high in calorie and low mass and easy to digest, so it is similar to the high energy and nutrition of a meat diet. But then even chimps and gorillas have a lot of free time with their vegetarian diet, too.  I'm on a really slow link, and can't do audio or video. I'm thinking that the link is talking about the reduced time gathering food allows for more time in creating things? I would agree with that for our species.

It's more about how cooking our food (meat or otherwise) could be related to human brain evolution.   I'll drag some numbers out of the video for ya.  So it seems that a billion neurons need something like 6 calories per day, and with the average human brain being 86 billion neurons, that equates to roughly 500 calories per day, or thereabouts.  Moreover, it seems there's a trade-off between body size and the number of neurons a brain can have, given a limited supply of energy. So for a primate that eats 8 hours a day, they can afford:   53 billion neurons, with a body that is 25kg 45 billion neurons, with a body that is 50kg 30 billion neurons, with a body that is 75kg 12 billion neurons, with a body that is 100kg   9 hours of eating per day seems to be a practical limit for primates.  With humans, we're at 86 billion neurons, with a body mass of 60 or 70 kg - there's no way for humans to eat a primate diet while meeting the necessary energy requirements. Cooking our food is what makes the difference."

It's most likely the juvenile of the Pachycephalosaurus. Here's a good illustration for that. In this case allometry completely confused the issue and the entire genus is non-existent.   An even more recent finding was that two Stegosaurus spp. have recently been reclassified as sexually dimorphic members of the same species.

So no, it was not a descendant or ancestor of Velociraptor but shared a close LCA with it.  It also wasn't an ancestor of birds and that statement is misleading.  For what it's worth, this find is significant because it's the first time we've seen what look light flight feathers on an animal that obviously couldn't fly, an animal the size of a Velociraptor.  That raises the question of why they had long feathers and what they used them for, and if they lost them later on in their evolution.

Sexual selection is a possibility, but a more likely scenario is social signaling. Humans express a wide variety of emotions through facial expressions.

We really have a fifth toe only because we need the foot bone that it comes with.       Also, some traits are the result of relaxed selection. Lighter skin in Europeans for example is the result of a relaxation of selection for darker skin. Some things result from relaxation of one selective mechanism which then allows another selective mechanism to start working. Relaxing NSeln on dark eyes in Europeans + mutations for eye color variation + sexual seln = green eyes in Europe.      Some traits are also the result of a failure of selection.

Some animals that live in the dark have eyes still that they don't and in some cases can't actually use (naked mole rats, fish, etc.)  I don't think it takes much looking to find quite a lot of things that seem to be in the process of going away..."
evolution,3dfrjz,PushEmma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:58:05 2015 UTC,"Basic question. For example, in the case of naked mole rats' eyes, how does them going away? Natural selection will pick the ones with smaller eyes and they will get smaller and smaller till dissapear after generations? If having eyes is not something that difficult them to reproduce, will those unnecessary traits stay forever?"
evolution,3dfrjz,conundri,3,Thu Jul 16 02:10:23 2015 UTC,"Natural selection is whichever rats survive better, there will eventually be more of.  If the eye takes up resources (energy for development, uses part of the brain) and a mole rat without eyes survives better (needs less energy for development, uses that area of the brain for smell or hearing enabling it to find food in the dark better, etc.) then over time you will have more and more rats with less developed eyes and eventually no eyes at all, simply because they survive more often.  You are correct that unnecessary traits can last longer if there isn't much of a difference in the survival rates of those with or without the feature, or if a mutation shutting off that trait simply hasn't happened yet.  This is probably why there are so many flightless birds, some do end up with smaller and smaller wings in proportion to their body (like chickens), but there are still ridiculous numbers of them.  The same thing is true for some large animals with tiny tails, and even perhaps the T-rex with it's tiny arms...    There are also occasional snake with feet, but feet dragging along the ground would just slow a snake down, so it's easy to see how snakes without limbs are faster and survive better.  Think of how many feet a long snake would need, and the energy and effort involved to coordinate all of them, and then watch how fast and quiet a snake without any feet can move...  http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/snakes-lost-legs-evolution-110207.htm"

Penguins use them to aid in swimming, ostriches and other ratities use them for sexual display and balance, and photos of a lot of the other flightless birds listed indicate that the wings are often used for sexual display in other flightless species as well.  There are probably a few species that are slowly losing the wings completely, like the moa did, but that takes time and often another use is found in the intervening time.  Most naked mole rats are not blind, but their eyes are very poor.  For the purposes of their lifestyles simply seeing light/dark is probably sufficient."

evolution,3dfrjz,WildZontar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:45:23 2015 UTC,"Coming late to the party here, but I want to point out that a simple lack of positive selection can easily lead to a trait being lost, whereas the opposite is very unlikely.  Look at it this way, it is way more common for a mutation to ""turn off"" or otherwise disrupt a trait than to turn one on or enhance an existing trait. If this results in no loss of fitness then selection won't work to maintain the trait. Given enough time you would eventually, through pure random chance, expect the trait to disappear. At the same time, it is VERY uncommon for a mutation to ""turn on"" a previously expressed trait because (a) the mutations would need to undo whatever turned it off in the first place, and (b) undo whatever other mutations happened to hit that gene sequence in the mean time while it wasn't being expressed and thus wasn't really visible to selection, and similarly mutations which cause a trait to be more beneficial are less common than those which cause it to be less beneficial.  So while it is true that maintaining a large structure (e.g. a limb) costs resources and if that structure doesn't provide sufficient fitness benefit to justify the cost, then selection will tend to purify the trait from the population, even if a phenotype provides just enough benefit to effectively offset the cost of developing/maintaining it the default assumption is that eventually that trait will be lost due to random chance. Granted if a neutral trait becomes very common in a population, it will probably take a very very very long time for it to disappear."

Before something comes along and slides into a niche, that niche is basically just eco-space. Something that's going unexploited.      A much better word there would be occupying a niche.

evolution,3dhc9z,fidderstix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:57:09 2015 UTC,"You can think of the body of the horse as adapted to its environment. The environment (weather, parasites, predators, food availability, disease, competition, etc.) continually tests organisms, for lack of a better word. Horse bodies vary from individual to individual, both at the molecular and organismal levels. Some individuals are 'weaker' in one way or another, and therefore don't survive as well, and are thus less likely to pass on their genetic heritage. Some are just unlucky. The strongest horse in the herd may get taken out by a random lightening strike. But on the balance, those that are both well adjusted to the environment in which they live, and lucky, pass on their genes and thus provide the raw material for the evolution of horses. In a stable environment over time, you'd expect to see some stability in horse bodies because they are well adapted to, having been shaped by, that environment. If the environment suddenly changes, that body may not be so well adapted anymore, and horses may either go extinct locally, or over time, by the selection of individuals who just happen to have characteristics that help them survive the new conditions, horse bodies may change. Possibly quite drastically.   So the only advantages it has in its environment are that it is well adapted to that environment in that time and place."

Which is a fascinating thought in general.      But it also illustrates something.      we would still be in the middle ages without Horses Machines.     It's really our technology that has brought humans' propensity for a sort of exponential rate of advancement. Really some of the most important of those technologies have been very simple things. Agriculture, for instance has been a major force in human evolution.      Things like the domestication of horses were also Major shifts in our evolution. The thing is that the domestication of grasses for agriculture didn't involve us taking a perfect grain that was growing in perfect rows and just moving it around with us. The domestication of the grasses turned things like teosinte into things like corn.     The same is really true for the domestication of horses. The ancestral wild European horse would have looked something more like this. That's the only known photo of a species of horse that died out around the turn of the 20th century.       Not exactly ""made for us to ride on"". Probably couldn't carry that man's weight at all.      The wild horses you see today are largely the result of our domestication of the animal and then subsequent feralization. So they're animals we changed to make them suit our needs and then we let them go again.     Nothing was made for us. But we've been really good at taking things from nature and modifying them to suit us. Which can very easily give the impression that things may have been made for us.

Its not like evolution decides that there needs to be an animal in order to keep down the population of grass. When a new species evolves its a process called speciation. There are 4 types, let me see how many I know off the top of my head:  Allopatric speciation (allo meaning ""other"" ""patric"" meaning ""fatherland"") is where the area occupied by a species is split in half by the formation of a new barrier. Like when pangea split apart into different continents and there were oceans separating individuals who were once the same species.  Sympatric speciation is where two species evolve in the same territory.  peripatric speciation from ""peri"" meaning ""around."" This is where a small population gets cut off from the main population. For example, a few birds get blown away from the mainland by a storm and occupy a new island, cut of from other birds.   Parapatric speciation: Pretty much the same as allopatric except that the two populations are not completely cut off from each other, there may be a small border that they can cross.

It's called the tree of life web project and the idea was to collect and compile the phyologenetic relationships of everything as they were published. Like I said, it ran out of funding and hasn't been updated since (I think) 2011; but the mammals haven't changed much so it should really up to date. It will also probably be the most comprehensive source available online in a web-format. It's really an awesome website.     It can be a bit difficult for some people to navigate, and I wish I could offer advice about how to make it easier, but I've never been able to work out where people's difficulty is coming from, so I've no advice to offer there.      But, I think it's an awesome website. And it will have a comprehensive tree of the mammals that you can take in chunks of any size you want.       For instance: Mammalia Chiroptera    You can see it comes in really easily manageable chunks, but you can also click through into more detail on any given branch.      So it should help you out I think.     Just to illustrate how to answer one of your questions: On the Chiroptera page, click the arrow at the root of the tree (on the left hand side of the screen, base of the tree).     That should take you to this page.     Now if you look at the tree on that page you can see that the closest outgroup to the bats is the Dermoptera. Then the bat/dermoptera clade is outgroup to a clade that includes primates and tree shrews.      So that would answer your question about bats. But unfortunately that example illustrates two things: 1) How you can navigate the TOL.; 2) The TOL is outdated on some things.     The latest phylogeny would have primates in a clade with the dermopterans, with the tree shrews as an outgroup to that clade.     And it would put bats (I think) as they are in this tree.     So the TOL is awesome, but not entirely up to date.      The only other realistic suggestion I could make would be to use wikipedia in the same way. You can see in that last link that wikipedia has been really good at keeping their phylogenies in a pretty great usable format and they seem, in my experience to usually be current with the latest understanding.      But nonetheless it's wikipedia.      So you should take a look at the TOL project; you may want to consider just using wikipedia -- but then you'll always have to wonder if what you're reading is good info or just some creationist vandalizing the page."

There can be a lot of overlap in the interests of evolutionary biologists and paleontologists. Paleontologists are often interested in the actually how certain traits evolved and what forces drove the evolution of certain species. Likewise, evolutionary biologists are also interested in the timeline and evolutionary history of different species. The methods by which they try to answer those questions varies between the sciences, however.   Evolutionary biologists typically analyze the genetics of extant (still living) species to understand their evolutionary history. They try to reconstruct the evolutionary history of species using various types of molecular markers. Which type of marker is used depends on how deep in time you want to look.   This is a simplified explanation of why, but basically, some sections of DNA (loci) accrue mutations faster than others. Whether or not that DNA codes for something important, and the relative importance of it, plays into that a lot. Less important loci (such as microsatellites) change quickly are good for looking at more recent evolutionary histories. More critical loci that code for important stuff (lots of other mitochondrial and nuclear DNA) that change slowly are good for more deep-time questions. So when evolutionary biologists determine the evolutionary history (phylogeny) of a group of species, they do it primarily using genetics.  Paleontologists are also interested in the evolutionary history of species, but instead look at the morphology and morphometrics of fossils to answer those questions. When they piece together the evolutionary history of a group of species, it's mainly done by looking at morphological changes in fossils through time.   This is of course a simplification of these sciences. There's a lot that goes into each type of analysis. I hope this answers your question!"

One of the main distinctions is that palaeontologists tend to be more interested in the products of evolution (specifically extinct products which introduces a lot of practical elements like geology that most other biologists don't deal with) whereas evolutionary biologists tend to be more interested in evolution as a process. However, palaeontologists still care about evolution as a process, and evolutionary biologists still care about the evolutionary history of specific lineages (but not just the extinct parts)."

From what I've seen they're pretty different.  Paleontologists are all about fossils.  They don't really study extant species, they're more concerned with fossils of species that are extinct.  They're basically fossil hunters.  Whereas evolutionary biologists have a much broader scope of study.  Plus they are much more concerned with genetics.  They may use some of the data that the paleontologists found, but they also use data from genetics, psychology, statistics and lots of other fields.  Some of them are into programming and computer science and just run simulations all day.    Another difference is that there are no real private sector paleontologists, in other words, there are no companies that need a paleontologist... unless you're finding fossils for private museums or something.  However, there are evolutionary biologists in the private sector.  Some work for big agriculture companies or pharmaceutical companies."

Human nature is a lofty and onerous topic best dealt with in small pieces -- each of the topics you name could fill volumes and volumes. There are not a whole lot of attempts at tackling them all at once while focusing on how they fit into what we call human nature.  Biologists: keep reading after the first sentence of this paragraph!: There's E.O. Wilson's The Social Conquest of Earth. This might not be a bad start, but be sure to supplement your reading with the criticisms pinned against it, for they are many! This book was heavily criticised even by scientists who generally agree with Wilson. But, I recommend it because it is an interesting and informative read and I think the basic idea is right -- that human nature is the result of cultural group selection and biological selection. These selective forces exert different kinds of pressures on populations and so human nature is an amalgam of selfish dispositions and groupish dispositions.  Reading this book along with the criticisms might be the best way to address your question because there is no simple, definitive answer (yet). Given the attention that this book has received, though, some extra research will provide you with multiple sources and interpretations from other biologists and anthropologists.  In short: It's a major publication by one of the most famous biologists ever, it's for a general audience, and the literature surrounding the book is vast, so you will get to see the many sides to the argument."

Who are the populations that they studied to get these results?  How can ethics be related to human nature, if it isn't agreed upon worldwide about what is right and wrong?  (There are plenty of cultures who have very different ethical standards to what we might delineate in the West)    Even the books about the ""how"" and ""why"" that you mentioned, you have to take them with a grain of salt.  Evolutionary psychology?  It's a theory, missing many many integrations from modern life.  It might explain some things, but can sometimes be far reaching.

Because all participants could read and write doesn't mean this skill is innate and unaffected by culture. It should also be noted the data used was from a 1989 study. It's hardly recent stuff and people's ideas of sex, gender and gender roles have changed a lot since. Also, participants were asked to indicate their sex before answering the questionnaire per se, which as far as I know is a good way of priming them for more stereotyped answers than they would have given otherwise.

I'm doing this for two reasons, one to show that intelligence is not always the best answer, and because I like to tell funny stories.  MIT started a contest to encourage robotics, so they created a maze that the robots had to find their way through. So people were coming up with all kinds of complex and clever designs for their robots. But one person noticed that pure speed and following the wall could zip through the maze much faster than the burden of all that clever electronics, so they designed a very simple ""wall follower"" that won the race. Everybody was pissed. The dumbest device won the race. So they changed the maze to make this method not work anymore.  The reason I bring that up is so that people can see that a large amount of memory or computational power doesn't always solve a problem the best and most efficient way. That means that evolving a large brain is not always the attractive resource that we believe it to be. Natural selection and evolution only re-enforce the winners, no matter how they got to the goal.   Another example of simplicity winning the prize is that bacteria is one of the most successful organisms on earth, but you will never find them competing on ""Quiz Bowl"" games. They don't need brains to be the best. Evolution is like a game, and you don't have to use intelligence to compete, and sometimes it just might be a waste of resources to do so. Just see brain power as one of many pathways to winning.  Anyway, you present a myriad of questions, and there is one answer to a small piece of it."

I'm not asking why haven't other animals evolved intelligence, what I'm asking is of the animals who did evolve exceptional intelligence, why did they?

An example of this is the giraffe, that had to compete for leaves with other browsing animals. A pathway available to its gene pool was to reach higher, where the other browsers couldn't reach. So now the giraffe has gained an advantage, but with the penalty that the extremely long neck causes them issues with survivability. That neck is very delicate and requires a lot of resources to create. Zoo keepers have to deal with all the peculiarities of the delicacy of giraffes.  Exactly what the challenge was can often be speculated from knowing the past of the organism. that is why it is speculated that humans evolved our more powerful brain in response to the drying of the highlands of Africa. It seems likely this radical change in the environment made having good memory and puzzle solving capability allowed our ancestors to survive this climate change. That is really speculation, though. There is no direct evidence of that. Seems plausible.  So the dolphin is a land animal, and finds that the oceans have been cleared of the reptilian monsters of the mesozoic era. That leaves resources open for exploitation. Maybe the dolphin already had a large brain capacity at that time? Or did the challenges of trying to school fish make more brain power a powerful drawing force for the change? I've watched dolphin herd fish, and they are very methodical (and playful!) when they do it. It's like cowboys herding cattle.  Maybe elephants got caught in the same drought scenario that humans got caught in, and the increase in memory allowed them to wander long distances and remember where the food caches are?  A lot of the answers are likely to be found in researching paleontology, to find the stressors and resource offerings that these species were exposed to.   Also remember that a lot of the things you read in evolution are just people's best guess at the time they made the guess, based on what was known at that time. Speculative hypothesis swing in and out of favor based on the times. Don't expect to find the one true answer, often it is more than one thing, called ""multiple causation"".  EDIT:  I brought up the giraffe example to show a creature in a bind that solved the problem, but the solution inflicted obvious penalties. This is also true when an organism gets a larger brain for its mass. That is an expenditure of resources, and in game theory, is the cost worth the benifit? Our brain consumes the equivalent of about 200 50 watts of energy at all times and is a delicate knob on our heads. It has its penalties.  Think in terms of cost/benefit analysis.  EDIT 2:  It's not 200 watts, I think it is 50. 200 watts was the estimate of our whole body. Anyway, our brains are a major energy consumer."

Honestly, its good that we have so many competing hypotheses, because that helps us rule them down to find one that is the most accurate.   So I kayak a lot (trust me, this is relevant). Yesterday, I started thinking, what if, in god knows how many million years, after humans have gone extinct and are replaced by some other intelligent species just as successful as ours. Some future archeologists find a fossil of my spray skirt (you wrap it around the outside of the cockpit of the kayak and it prevents water from getting in)? If they did, they would have no idea what it was. There is absolutely no chance they would be able to find out what it was for. They closest they could possibly get is to say it was some sort of clothing, which it kind of is, but the last thing they would guess is that it is supposed to keep water out of my boat, right? Anyway, the point is, the only way they would find out what it was is if they were told what it was and what it was for. It would have been unknowable to them. Imagine what types of things from the past we must be getting terrible wrong.  What would they have thought about fossilized tires? What would they think when they found fossils of those? If you were looking back on our society based only on fossils of our stuff, you would get so much stuff wrong.  Now, archaic humans don't  have nearly as much technology for us to figure out, which makes it much easier to figure out about them than it would be for a future society to figure out about us.

But you never know when somebody is going to show up with some data that overturns everything, and then feathers fly again.   Imagine what types of things from the past we must be getting terrible wrong.    Another one of my hobbies is archeology. Many objects are found, and the purpose of them is not known. There is a dumping category for objects like this, and archaeologists just call them ""religious object"". Over the centuries many objects were first classified as ancient religious objects, and then found to have a purpose. It has become a joke in the field of archeology. There is one person who wrote a joke-paper decades ago, pretending he was an archaeologist of the future, and trying to figure out what our common objects were. Coke signs represented a deity. =-} Your kayak cloak is an obvious religious garment worn during sacrifice, so you don't get any stuff on you. =-}  Chubby little dolls are found, and classified as ""fertility goddess"". It is true that observations of primitive cultures shows that humans make a lot of objects for their many religions, but some of the things they make are just to pass the time or make art. You won't see many objects officially labeled ""art object"" or ""weird thing carved by bored caveman"", though, because that wouldn't look proper in a published paper. Unexplainable things must be religious, by tradition in the field.  Evolution, along with archeology, is still one of those ""fuzzy"" sciences, filled with wild speculation. The complexity is so great and the fact that experiments to prove or disprove theories are limited makes the field difficult to absolutely define."

People should understand that some of these things they read are actually speculation, and not proven facts. It seems like facts when the reading material makes absolute statements of causation. This does a disservice to science because it obscures the areas that need work.  Science is often presented wrong in primary and secondary schools. The way the textbooks are written often makes it seem like all things are known and science is just a pile of truths. This discourages students from pursuing the field of scientific research, because if everything is already known, why bother thinking about it? Science courses which should be challenging and honing the puzzle solving skills of the student turn into just memorization of dry facts, some of which aren't true.  People are often embarrassed to admit that the data supporting a speculative theory is either weak or non existent. It's like the Wizard of Oz, don't look behind the curtain.  People in research love to look behind the curtain, because that is where the fun is. =-}  And sometimes people settle on ""multiple causation"", which means multiple forces caused an effect. Sometimes I feel this is just a political solution to make all the parties happy and stop arguing, but sometimes it might actually be true.  One speculation I'd like to throw out is the possibility that at one time in our recent past, we actually used the excess brain matter for something, and in our current lives we don't need it. There does seem to be much more brain matter than required for what we need. Selection should have trimmed that away, or rather should not have developed it to begin with. Something weird has happened.  Imagine if the environment of Africa suddenly favored much shorter trees. That would leave the giraffe with a neck that is way too long.

For instance, say there is a study of how X influences Y, and there are very vocal people who think Z influences Y, then the researchers would write: ""Blah blah blah these results show that X plays a large part in Y, of course however multiple factors may be in play and Z may also be a contributing factor"".

You don't know who is on the review committee, so you better not piss anybody off.  You might even want to cite their work, because citations are tracked and the number is like a badge of honor to the authors. Ignoring their work is a mild slap to them.  And if your paper is not offering evidence to refute the other theory, then it would be a good idea all around to mention the background of the topic. This is normally done in the first paragraph of the paper, a quick synopsis of the latest in the field.  But if your paper does refute the other theory, offering evidence that it is wrong, you still cite their paper as reference, but clearly state how your data shows what is true. And expect some fireworks, even if you are right.  There are rules, like ""Reddiquette"", that people follow to get along. Breaking the rules will get your paper downclicked just for spite. =-}  Aside from citing somebody's paper, another way to give them a nod is to call them up, chat with them a bit about what you are working on, and then mention them at the end of the paper under a section often called ""useful conversations"". Like this: ""And useful conversations on the development of this paper where had with Joe Blow, of the Blow Institute.""   As a general rule, it is a bad idea to make enemies. When it does happen, the publishers often know the situation and encourage or require you to cite your rival. It's the proper thing to do.  Einstein pissed a lot of people off by having no co-authors and no citations and no ""useful conversations"". That's kind of unheard of in physics, and a lot of people were insulted. But when asked about it, Einstein was truthful in saying he thought it all up himself and never really talked to anybody about it. Still, he broke protocol and people were insulted.  I can't name a paper right off the bat, but these political situation happen all the time. Scientists are real people and have emotional spats all the time, even when their theories are not in contention. It might be something as trivial as jealousy over how many citations somebody received, or what level of peer reviewed journal published a paper. they may not believe you deserve the honor, now you have an enemy. It might have been a unwelcome comment you made while at a party.

The dog can't return to the wolf, because the gene pool of the ""bred"" dog has become constricted and a lot of the genes to make a wolf are now gone, they have been bred out of the pool.   2) Why would natural selection transform a land animal (or the other ancestor) into a bird?    Transformations like that are normally because there is a resource that is rich and acts as a lure for evolution to proceed to chase it. If a benefit exists, and it is possible for the variation of the gene pool to receive this benefit, then the organisms can start to evolve in that direction."

evolution,3d488r,wayofthedodos,4,Mon Jul 13 12:41:16 2015 UTC,"Natural selection is an editing process. It acts on what is already there, but doesn't do any more than that. It doesn't plan for anything and doesn't create anything (naturally occurring variations do, and then natural selection acts on them).  Let's say there is an organism that lives in trees, and escapes from predators by jumping off branches. Some of the individuals can jump a bit further than average, while some are not so good at it. The individuals who can't jump very well are more likely to get eaten, because they can't escape very effectively. The individuals that can jump far away from predators, on the other hand, are less likely to be eaten, and so they go on to have more offspring. It's likely that at least some of the variation in jumping ability we see is genetic and will be passed on to said offspring. Little by little, the population is overtaken by good jumpers, because bad jumpers are not so successful and die before they can leave a lot of offspring behind. This is cold mathematical logic.  As long as jumping further and further away makes individuals more likely to survive, the population as a whole is going to get better at it. This is how natural selection proceeds. After generations, maybe the population will start becoming better at controlling its jumps - i.e. gliding - because individuals who can choose where they land are also going to be more successful. Bit by bit, the population may start developing membranes that can slow falls down, and get closer and closer to having what we call wings and being able to fly. But that doesn't mean that flying was ever the goal - it is us humans who see a narrative behind evolution. Maybe at some point the individuals that can glide better won't be more likely to survive anymore, maybe because they only need to glide from one tree to its close neighbour, and gliding any further is not an advantage, so that the population never becomes able to fly. Maybe the predators have caught up, or new predators have emerged, that are especially good at catching individuals when they are jumping or gliding, and now individuals that favour running on branches or up and down trees instead of gliding are more likely to survive. In the latter case, unwieldy gliding membranes may start shrinking (because individuals with smaller, less inconvenient ones are likely to be better at moving fast from one part of the tree to the other) and eventually the population may stop being able to glide. I'll stop here, because such thought experiments can go on for a while, and I just wanted to illustrate how natural selection works by editing (and how easy it is to think it has goals). :)  We often think of animals that live on land on having left the oceans and in doing so having ""advanced"", but there are animals that have returned to the oceans successfully (whales for example). It just so happened that, at some point, those who were better at taking advantage of an aquatic environment were also more likely to survive. They never ""regressed"", because living on land was never a goal."

It's so good that it's often used to make and test predictions - this predictive power is a big part of why it's so incredibly useful.  Stephen Jay Gould once remarked,   In science, 'fact' can only mean 'confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.' I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms.

Natural selection ""knows"" nothing. But a flap of skin between limbs is a common enough developmental mutation (many people have webbed fingers), and offered enough benefit that it was selected for progressively in at least 5 tetrapod lineages I'm aware of: pterosaurs, dinosaurs/birds, bats, gliding possums, flying squirrels. Note that the details of which limbs or ""fingers"" are involved vary markedly in these examples, but even in the more primitive elaborations on this adaptation (the possums and squirrels), their glider wing offers its own survival advantage in arboreal niches."

They then likely became useful for locomotion, allowing for selection for increasingly specialized limbs and feathers.  I found this link explaining this. I haven't read it, but the author studies this stuff so he knows more than I can tell you!

evolution,3d488r,brian9000,2,Mon Jul 13 13:57:33 2015 UTC,"1) The domestication of dogs is completely fascinating, I could talk about it all day. I have a whole folder of bookmarks dedicated to links relating to the domestication of dogs. I'm not sure what you're asking here, if you're asking would dogs evolve back in the direction of wolves given the opportunity, than the answer is that dogs would breed with wolves and likely breed into their population, unless the wolves bred into the dog population. The point is, they would breed with wolves a lot. If you're asking why haven't dogs moved back in the direction of wolves when humans stop selecting them for certain traits, the answer is we always have been breeding and selecting them, they never had a chance to thus far.  You might want to watch this and this, if you want to, I can give you some more links. Also, you might want to read about the Russian Fox experiment, which kind of forced us to change our ideas of how quickly animals can become domesticated. Essentially, TLDR: a bunch of Russian scientists got tons of foxes, put them in cages, and only bred the ones who had lower flight distances (flight distance is how close you can get before the animal is outie). That's all they were selecting for. But weird things happened, the foxes coat colors changed, instead of solid colors, they had spots, and variable colored fur. Their ears became floppier. They started to wag their tale, which wild foxes never did. All the scientists ever selected for was foxes that would allow humans to get closer to them. But the foxes became, in short, more puppy like. That's actually key. Younger foxes are in general more comfortable near humans. So by selecting for ones who were more comfortable with us, we were actually deleting for ones who matured less (is less the right word? I don't know what word I should use for that, maybe someone smarter than me can help me out here). More importantly, why am I talking so much about this? I told you I could talk about the process of domestication for hours upon hours upon hours. If only I could find someone to listen to me.  Anyway, back to subject.  2) That's a really good question, the problem is, from my understanding, the fossil record of early ave (birds) evolution has gaps in it that are bigger than he Grand Canyon. No paleontologist  can really agree on much. I know a good website for this, let me see if I can find it again. Here it is. Actually, flight is probably the best example of convergent evolution I can think of. Convergent evolution is where 2 or more species evolve the same thing, or similar things, to tackle a single problem. Flight has evolved 4 times. It evolved in Birds, Bats, Pterosaurs, and insects all completely separate from each other. Actually, wait, what about flying fish? I'm actually typing as I think right now, I hope that's okay. What about flying squirrels? Do flying squirrels count as flight? I mean, all it can do is glide. It is flying, but it's now powered flight, is it? Does it still count? I'll have to look this up later.  Wait, I just realized I never answered your second question, the answer is: it's still up to debate, no one really knows, their are hypotheses galore though.  I just want to say that you bring up a really good point with your second question. Most people who don't understand evolution very well wouldn't think to ask that. You're absolutely right, in order for something to evolve, it has to be if benefit in its early stages of development. Evolution can only ever take baby steps, one mutation at a time, in order to evolve a new trait. And every single baby step has to be of enough benefit to improve the chances of getting passed down to the second generation.. So yeah, the fact that you asked that question really makes me question if you're a ""newbie"" to evolution.  I wrote this in mobile so it probably has like a thousand after contact errors."

A species is everything that can breed with other members of the species. Of course this definition has its own problems. First of all, Grizzly bears and Polar bears have been known to breed, yet they are obviously different species. Tigers and lions have also bred. BTW, when two species breed with each other, there is a rule for how you combine the names of the species. You take the first part of the name of the males species, and the rest of the word from the females species. If  a male grizzly and a female polar bear, you would call it a grolar bear, if it was a male polar bear and a female grizzly bear it would be pizzly bear. If it was a male lion and a female tiger you would call it a liger. If it was a male tiger and female lion, it would be a tion.  Back to subject, this breaks the definition of a species, right? According to that logic, polar bears should be the same species as grizzly bears, and lions and tigers would be the same species, but they obviously are not the same species. The thing is, if you breed a lion and tiger, or polar and grizzly bears, the offspring cannot breed, thus they are not the same species.  Some say that we should define a species not as what can breed with other species, but what frequently does. But wait, what if they are geographically isolated? What if I took half the moose from Yellowstone National Park and moved them to some zoo. They wouldn't breed with each other, would they? Of course, that's not the best example because if they were in the same area then they would breed.  Back to the topic of dogs. Dogs are the most variable species on the planet. This is due to all sorts of different attempts to breed dogs for specific tasks, herding livestock, protecting livestock, intimidating people, deterring people from entering your property, tracking game, catching (small) game, racing, retrieving dead birds from lakes for the hunters who shot them. The list goes on and on and on. So now we have this incredibly diverse species. And size varies greatly. If humans varied in size as much as dogs did, we would have people the size of Barbie dolls. Which would make architecture really difficult. But, the point is, technically we consider all dogs the same species. However, these two dogs would have a incredibly difficult time breeding, wouldn't they? Yet we still consider them to be the same species.  I got to be honest, my knowledge of the definition of a species is actually kind of limited. I should probably start to read up on that."

If humans disappeared and various dog breeds were left to roam the empty streets, it's likely that over time, you would probably see dogs like chihuahuas and great danes disappear, to be replaced with a blend of dog that looks and behaves more like dingoes - basically, wild dogs. Over a long period of time, you could expect these dogs to become more aggressive - the traits that were beneficial to a human-dog relationship would now be less useful. I would argue that over the long term, you likely would get dogs that are more wild, and perhaps wolf-like in behaviour and appearance, but if modern dogs were not genetically compatible with today's wolves, a return to the wild won't reverse that, and the descendants of today's dogs aren't going to somehow return to being genetically compatible. That being said, dogs and wolves today are genetically compatible, so without humans, you might expect some dogs to mate with wolves.  In short: no - it's not a reversible process. But given enough time, modern dogs could continue to evolve to look and behave more like wolves, but it would not make them more genetically compatible than they are now.   Why would natural selection transform a land animal (or the other ancestor) into a bird?   This is a bit like asking ""why would gravity cause a rock to roll down hill?""  It's thought that feathers first evolved as thermal insulation - think the soft downy feathers you see on baby birds. Later, feathers with a more rigid structure evolved and might have been used for communication or for defense, in the way cat hairs go on end when they are threatened. Later still, feathers would allow dinosaurs to run uphill faster. Later still these feathers would allow for dinosaurs to leap higher and farther, possibly aiding in hunting. You can see where this is going - in each incremental step, feathers allowed dinosaurs to take advantage of an unoccupied niche, giving them an advantage over organisms without feathers.  Life occupies new niches, and gene pools are plastic and ""mould""  to the environment, like hot wax being pushed into a seal.    Because in the transitional form the bird wings aren't fully developed so it has no good use (for flying).   Some people have asked ""what's the use of half and eye,"" claiming that all the parts of the eye need to be present in order to function properly. But, half and eye is still better than no eye, and 1% of an eye is still better than 0% of an eye. Even prey that can see the dark outline or shadow of an approaching predator is going to have a better chance of survival compared to an organism without this ability. And indeed, we see all stages of eye development in the animal kingdom today, all the way from the simplest light-sensitive cells, to pinhole cameras in organisms like the nautilus, all the way to eyes even better than our own (hawks for example.)  Likewise, ""half a wing"" is still better than none. Running uphill fast or leaping higher or farther still allow for incremental advantages every step of the way. You're making the mistake of looking only at the end product (flying) and ignoring all the intermediate benefits (thermal insulation, communication, running, leaping, etc).  I hope that clears up your confusion. If you have any follow-up questions or need clarification, please ask!"

It's not like there's an extra fish genome just lurking in the background.  As a general rule, nonfunctional, nonused genes do NOT persist over evolutionary time.  As soon as a gene is no longer needed, it is no longer subject to natural selection, which usually works to keep it intact.  Mutations begin to accumulate, and over the generations, that gene will usually be completely lost.  There is no plausible mechanism by which an intact, fully functional gene will just sit in a genome for millions and millions of years without change.  That simply doesn't happen.  The few examples that are often cited - like the chickens that begin to grow tooth buds - represent genes that have been shut off relatively recently in evolutionary time, and/or those that just by sheer chance have persisted for an unusually long time."
evolution,3d30ip,Smeghead333,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"The genomic pieces you're talking about are called pseudogenes and like /u/Smeghead333 said they're going to accumulate mutations at a steady rate since there's little or no selection pressure on them. That means that their fidelity is a function of how long it's been since they became pseudogenes.  Most pseudogenes are actually copies functional genes that still reside elsewhere in the genome. This can happen either via mRNA reverse transcription or via gene duplication during replication. There are some that aren't copies and are just permanently down-regulated, though.  Many researchers are in fact exploring the pseudogenome of humans or other organisms as a sort of molecular paleontology to better understand evolutionary history. Pseudogenes, if they are recognized as such, can add a lot to phyolgenetic reconstructions. Plus, if they're fully down-regulated, they can make excellent molecular clocks.  Pseudogenes are also important for ongoing evolution. Because many of them still have gene promoters, valid open reading frames, and stop codons, but are not required for the organism's survival or development, they can function sort of like evolutionary sandboxes. Starting from a functional gene, mutations are freely introduced that could lead to radical changes in protein function. It's been found again and again that pseudogenes actually do get expressed sometimes when an organism is stressed, so if beneficial mutations have been introduced, they may help the organism survive and might be more permanently up-regulated in the offspring."
evolution,3d30ip,SweaterFish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:45:52 2015 UTC,"Some of it is. These are called pseudogenes - they were once functional on an earlier ancestor and are now remnants that can no longer act as genes: The GULO pseudogene is one example - it was needed for the production of vitamin C in an earlier primate ancestor.  A much larger proportion of our junk DNA comes from transposable elements though. These are bits of DNA that mostly don't serve a purpose but have replicated themselves throughout our genome over millions of years. They include things like virus infections, ERVs, SINEs, LINEs, etc. Junk DNA also arises from things like sequence duplication. Overall, only a small part of it is made up by pseudogenes"

Somewhere amidst that 80% of DNA, for example, lie the instructions that coax an uncommitted cell in a growing embryo to form a brain neuron, or direct a cell in the pancreas to churn out insulin after a meal, or guide a skin cell to bud off and replace a predecessor that has sloughed off."
evolution,3d30ip,SharmaK,2,Mon Jul 13 04:42:43 2015 UTC,"This is right. Although they are non-coding, they have a crucial role in gene regulation. They function as spacer, protein binding sides (both for regulation and for expression) and some act as regulator themself.  The proteins themselves do not make a complex organism, it is the regulation of those genes that can lead to the complex structures.  Remove the colon at the end, it destroys the link"

evolution,3d1cdh,itoowantone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:02:33 2015 UTC,"I had a conversation with Dad a few months before he died. I gave the example of the white butterflies in England. When people began burning coal, the trees were coated in soot. Birds easily found and ate the white butterflies. The few that were black weren't eaten as often. Soon all their butterflies were black. Dad's eyes got wide. He said, ""That's not evolution, that's a natural process!"".   Ding ding ding, we have a winner! I told him that of course that is evolution and that evolution is most certainly a natural process.  Another great example to provide is ring species. Arctic birds can interbreed with slightly different cousins to the west. Those can with their western cousins, too. That continues on around the globe at that high northern latitude until one arrives back, in a ring, to the initial set of birds. The initial and final sets, despite being adjacent, cannot interbreed and are separate species. You don't even have to talk about species in the past that are now extinct. We have a living set of slightly different groups, interbreeding with their neighbors, extended far enough in space that the final result is a separate species.  It seems so obvious to me that given a finite number of genes in any organism, that random mutations occur at a rate we have determined, that some of those mutations confer a survival advantage in the environment of the time, and given the amount of time life has been on Earth, organisms can change enormously. (Emphasis on ""enormously"".) I think most people have no concept of the vast time scales at play."

It'd be a bit like ringing the dinner bell.         One of the most prominent ideas has been an idea of altruism. The bird would be sacrificing itself to let its kin escape and would be helping to increase its fitness through their reproduction. Sounds like that's your interpretation?       I'm going to offer a different one.       The animal that calls out the alarm signal has two separate goals. One is to call the predator's attention. The second is to convince its group mates to scatter. Then it can stand still and be camouflaged while the hawk chases down the closest fleeing bird.       Just a thought."

I have found piles of feathers in the past years, right at that spot, so some predator must have gotten one of them.    Then it can stand still and be camouflaged while the hawk chases down the closest fleeing bird.    Ruffed grouse do something similar. They sit tight and are camouflaged as danger approaches. Some pop up when you are 15 feet away, and some never pop up, and you almost step on them, and all combinations of distance in between. This seems to be a distribution of evasive tactics, and not coordinated, probably based on the ""temperament"" of the individual bird.  One thing that occurred to me is that this one dove might be the ""bull"" of the group, and its prowess of evasion is why it is acting as a lame duck. Just like the most dominant bull protects the herd, this dove is the most dominant of its flock, and is pre-chosen by its rank in the social order as the most likely to survive an attack due to its skills.

The truth is in the data and presentation and will eventually win out. If it can't be refuted, then squawking about it is just a waste of time. The people on the list should be embarrassed to have used such an altruistic method for the preservation of their kin.   That initial reaction to Einstein's paper was because the people either didn't read it, or misread it. Einstein rewrote some of Newton's equations, and that is what pissed them off. They thought he was knocking holes in the foundation of physics.   But actually he was patching holes that were glaringly obvious, and people were ignoring the holes. Often people don't want to see the holes in their theories, so they pretend they aren't there. A person who points the holes out is attacked by the crowd.  Physics still has an enormous number of holes in it. The universe should not exist as we see it, according the theories that we have. Physicists have learned to accept that the holes are pointed out, because of the example you gave of the ""authors against Einstein"".

And I also think that it was decided to do it that way really to prove a point that there is a serious majority consensus (honestly, I'm not the only one who thinks the original paper would have been rejected if not for EO Wilson's name on it).      But if the responses were so good, then it would have required only one author with a very sound point.      So we'll have to see where this one goes!

He said people were getting too wrapped up in their theories and not attempting to reconcile the observed data with the theories. There is a temptation to create a theory that is wonderful and good, and then shoehorn the data into it, cropping off the bits that don't fit. Those are the holes in the foundation.  When Gould proposed that the fossil data might be true as it is seen, that created a firestorm of ""authors against Gould"".

The idea of ""beauty + simplicity = truth"" kind of started with Einstein, because what he did was both. In physics, people look for the simplest answer, because historically complex answers have often failed.

evolution,3d0krv,tribalypredisposed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:44:52 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, both sides are wrong for the same reason in the group selection debate.   Both sides use the term ""selection"" for two distinct questions: what is selected, and how is it selected (source of selective pressure). They conflate these questions and assert the answer to one is the answer to the other. So the two Wilsons say, look, altruism and pro-social behaviors can only be selected by force of selection at the group level, therefore groups are what is selected. Dawkins and hundreds of others say, no, groups cannot be what is selected (true) therefore how altruism was selected was at the gene/individual level.   Surprisingly, the answers to this debate are pretty basic once we stop conflating the what and how questions of selection. Groups are not what is selected, they are not a unit of replication so they cannot be. Groups are a how of selection, they must be or the theory of evolution is wrong. The core premise is that competition for resources and/or mates generates force of selection. This must always be true, so if groups compete for resources or mates, it must generate the how, the force of selection,  AT THE GROUP LEVEL. Genes respond to force of selection, not the what of selection.   Think about it like this. If I asked a professor, how did flight evolve in birds, and he answered ""at the gene level,"" would this be a good answer? Dawkins and all those hundred plus are answering the question, how did altruism in humans evolve, with ""at the gene level."" No, the question is how, not what, and the answers to those questions are not the same. No, groups are not what is selected. Yes, group level selection pressure allows the evolution of altruism; genes are selected because of force of selection. So the result is that, in this case, genes are selected AS IF the group was somewhat of a replicant, it does allow individuals to have increased average fitness if they altruistically sacrifice for their in-group. Which does also mean altruism is real and not some artifice to cover for ultimate selfishness."

evolution,3d0krv,Paraponera_clavata,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:46:32 2015 UTC,"This is the concept of fitness. The factors that make a trait more likely to be passed to the next generation are if it 1) increases ability to survive to reproduction (either by avoiding predation or tolerating a harsh environment) or 2) increases ability to obtain fitness limiting resources (food, water, territory in a suitable habitat) or 3) increases ability to obtain mates in sexually reproducing species, either by force, by male against male competition, or by sexual selection (making the individual more appealing to the opposite sex). More fit individuals, on average, have more descendants in the next generation and so whatever genes have given them an advantage spread through the population.  If we compete together as a group for territory and mates against another group, the selection pressure will be generated at the group level. Whether or not I obtain the territory I need or the mating opportunities I want is largely or entirely determined at the group level by the relative fitness of my group. A human could be the most fit human alive but if their group is small and weak compared to whoever they are competing with they may have no descendants. Many Native Americans had this fate."

evolution,3d0krv,Paraponera_clavata,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:19:43 2015 UTC,"It is the flock(s) that come to feed on my driveway that I have been observing this behavior for 5 years now.  It might be more than one flock. Sometimes there are only about 10 birds, and sometimes there are about 20. I notice when it is a high number like 20, that is when I'm most likely to see two birds that hold fast and don't fly away. This has lead me to believe that each flock may have an assigned sacrifice, and two flocks together leave behind two birds, one from each flock.  Since the food area is small, about 6 foot diameter, the birds are densely clustered. I walk up, and they immediately fly away. This is when I'm up to 30 feet way. But one is left, and I can often walk up to it within 10 feet, and it is sitting tight, and then it flies off in the same direction as the flock. This is so repeatable that it has to be deliberate.  And the spooky thing is, if it is deliberate, how do these birds figure out who will stay? That almost sounds like communication between them. Or it could be instinctual, but based on what criteria?  When a herd of bovine is approached, it is normal for the most dominant bull to stand its ground, or advance towards the threat as the cows retreat. That seems an obvious defensive game and the choice of the defensive bull is probably based on the social structure of the group. The assignment of the role of dominant bull is social, but the defensive move might be instinctual.   So maybe this is some self sacrifice similar to that, with the selection of the sacrifice as a social position in the group, and the instinct is not to fly?"
evolution,3d0krv,Paraponera_clavata,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:00:21 2015 UTC,The birds definitely are not collectively deciding on who should stay. These sorts of thing tend to be emergent properties of independent actors. Check out the Ideal Free Distribution - that would explain what's going on.

evolution,3cp4vs,Antinero,3,Thu Jul 9 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"Not going to be a complete answer here, but I'll bring up a point that your post made me think about in terms of Bacteria.  If you classify the diversity of, say, environmental bacteria in terms of traits rather than taxonomy (i.e. you define populations based on metabolic ability rather than phylogeny), you get an interesting view of evolution. As a general example, instead of saying ""this organism is an E. coli because of its genome structure and is found in the upper soil layer"", you say ""this organism can efficiently metabolize glucose and is aerobic, therefore it is found in places where these two conditions are sufficiently overlapping"".   In this mindset, called trait-based biogeography, the environment is the selective force because it contains several niches (i.e. from the simple example above, there is a certain gradient of glucose that overlaps a certain gradient of oxicity), which allows disparate trait-based life forms to coexist, kind of like a forest where birds, bugs, and mammals, etc. occupy trees, soil, ground-cover, etc. (i.e. in the soil some bacteria do really well fixing nitrogen and getting their energy from metabolizing iron, whereas others do really well metabolizing amino acids for energy and produce ammonium for plants).   The point here is that competition is fairly relentless in this sense, with organisms evolving traits that slowly oust another trait-based group from the present niche. This allows for a constant ""arms race"" and niche turnover. Similarly, by being in a niche, the organisms fundamentally change the environment around them (think the great oxygenation event). Therefore, as one organism slowly loses its hold in a certain environment, the replacing trait-group may have different ""side-effects"", therefore setting up conditions for the next takeover.  Keep in mind this is just one way of viewing biodiversity, but hopefully that gave you something to think about in the sense that biodiversity is always shifting because of new metabolic innovations or because of changes in the environment."

Elasmobranchs (sharks, etc.) are one group which are very well known for having gone through a large bottleneck lasting 50-100 million years or even more before returning to nearly the same diversity they once had.

The answer to the question of how much are humans affected by natural selection is to a very large degree.    Some believe that as medicine advances, humans are circumventing NS, but all medicine is really doing is changing some of the selection pressures, not removing humans from NS.    Every time someone dies before reproducing (or even after limited reproduction), then NS was at work. This includes miscarriages (which happen in up to 50% of fertilizations). Every time someone chooses who to date and have kids with NS is at work (remember that NS is more concerned with reproduction than survival, and even if humans bring health to the point of near immortality, reproduction will still occur; that being said if we eliminate reproduction, then that is another matter.). Every time someone chooses to have a child, have another child, not have another child, or not have children at all NS is at work.    I could go on, but the point is that humans, just like nearly every other living thing, are subject to natural selection to a very large degree."

You see this in cave dwelling animals, where when they started living in caves, their environment changed to no longer punish those with bad eyesight.  Most species that have been living in deep caves for an extended period of time are blind as a result of this.  Another example using humans is Vitamin C, since we were consuming food with excess vitamin C, our ancestors didn't die when there was a mutation in our gene to produce vitamin C.  If we were not eating those fruits, we would have retained that gene's functions, because any that lost it, would have died before passing on their mutated (non-functioning) gene."

There's actually a very small vocal minority that would argue the other position. Sort of like group selection. Small number of people who are very vocal, but the vast majority of us are convinced that individual (or even genic) selection will (almost) always be strongest.      Your definition is a fine definition of selection. But it doesn't quite describe natural selection specifically. That definition would work for any form of selection, including artificial selection, which is denotatively unnatural.      A definition of NS per se would have to include the nature of the selective pressure. Which would be something environmental (e.g. differential depredation, variation in resource acquisition, etc.).      It's the nature of the selective pressure that distinguishes the three forms of selection. NS is something environmental. SS has to do with differential reproductive success as the result of mate selection, sexual interactions, sperm competition, male-male competition, female choosiness, etc.       Artificial selection is that which is imposed by man."

Natural selection is the process by which the environment selects which organisms reproduce.  Evolution by natural selection is the proposition that this process is influenced by, and in turn an influence on, the genes of those organisms.  It's a minor distinction, but an important one.  In the example you gave, there is no clear gene influence in the survival/continued reproduction, as it was an arbitrary environmental hazard that would have done the same to both groups, regardless of their genes (presumably, assuming there was no minor genetic impact on their current location versus the other proposed group).  The flaw in thinking here is because there was no possible influence from the genes, it is not natural selection.  This is untrue, as the selection is still occurring, it just isn't having a progressional impact on the evolution of the species as would be expected to be possible if a gene had an influence on the situation."

It concerns the differential inheritance of genetic characters from one generation to the next due to fitness differences. Look up Price and Ewen's interpretations of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection.  Differential reproduction that is not due to fitness differences does not count as selection. An environmental event which kills a random proportion of a population regardless of their genes is just another example of genetic drift, which is the part of evolutionary change due to neutral random sampling.

""Selection"" is not specific enough of a phrase to describe what it actually is. The whole point of calling the process natural selection is to suggest that nature itself, without conscious intent, can also ""select"", as an analogy to selection, which connotes intention.

They are still different from one another in a lot of significant ways, though, so they are almost universally considered separate mechanisms of evolution. The problem with this attempt to claim that selection even if it's not based on heritable differences is still natural selection is that there's already another term for that: genetic drift.

It is selection if there is a relevant genetic difference, is drift if there isn't. It is only selecting if there is a difference to select.   In academic journals in the field of evolution, we often see research that only look at individual components.   Of course. So try again.

Right now, we are under a lot of evolutionary pressure to not crash our cars, and to survive a car crash if it does occur. Of course, this likely won't last forever.  I also think that in the future our brains will mature faster. Right now, children who develop quicker have an advantage in school, school favors kids who develop skills faster, and the ones who aren't as fast fall behind. Also, one bad decision as a teenager can get you killed. Then again, one bad decision as a teenager can also get you pregnant.  Not to mention, no one can deny that sexual selection is still a thing. Sexual selection is probably driving natural selection more than anything else these days. In the future, we may see humans that are much more attractive. Men will be taller, more muscular, and likely more confident. Women will have larger breasts, and more attractive bodies.

Why do I have to constantly remind people that the amount of muscle you have by default as well as the maximum amount of muscle you can gain through exercise have everything to do with genetics?  And a more attractive body is definitely genetic. That's how sexual selection works, is it not? Men like women with larger breasts, women tend to like taller, more muscular men, right?

evolution,3cjw1j,SweaterFish,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:53:42 2015 UTC,"I think there's two problems. One is that as a result of medicine and culture and consciousness the selective pressure of many things which might otherwise lead to more rapid evolution is really decreased. That doesn't mean that the pressures aren't there, but just that they would take an EXTREMELY long time to cause readily identifiable changes in the traits of the human population.  The second problem is connected to this and it's that, because of the rapidity with which our culture changes, many selective pressures are only significant for relatively short periods of time before they become unimportant again.  Combined, these two points would seem to indicate that natural selection is unlikely to lead to significant changes in the human population in the foreseeable future (which is the way I interpret your question, since most people are not very interested in the fact that every time someone dies or is born, humanity evolves).  I'm not totally sure this is true. I don't really study humans (formally), but I just can't think of any clear examples that are likely to lead to evolution of traits.  One exception (though it's more related to sexual selection) is that it seems very likely that humans and particularly females will continue to neotenize just as we have since before we even became hominids. This seems to be an unyielding direction in our lineage."

Some fish evolved into amphibians,  like tiktalik, and some amphibians evolved into reptiles,  and some reptiles evolved into diapsids, and some diapsids evolved into early mammals resembling rodents,  and some of them evolved into primitive primates, and some of them evolved into early apes,  and we evolved from early apes.

There is no place for that attitude in this forum, and without fail  it only comes from people who themselves clearly lack any deep understanding of evolution.        You literally said in this post that mammals are diapsids, that reptiles evolved into mammals, that evolution cannot proceed rapidly, that the first mammals resembled rodents and that dogs have been co-evolving with man for 10K years. You also implied that tetrapod evolution began in the Cambrian.       None of that is correct.        You display a clear lack of understanding.      You clearly understand neither evolution nor do you understand the goal of scientists as educators.       You have a great deal of things to learn to begin to understand.      Your discourse here started out by lowering the constructive nature of the conversation. And you ended by disseminating clearly false information. You decreased constructive discourse and you increased destructive discourse.        Next time you are thinking about opening your mouth or moving your fingers, stop and ask yourself a couple of questions:      A) Am I adding anything to this conversation?       B) Do I have any idea what I'm talking about?       C) Do I want to look like an idiot?        Based on what you've said here; if the answer to question C is no, then you should probably keep it to yourself because you've proven that you are not capable of accurately gauging the answers to A and B."

The earliest mammals were small and shrew like, and while shrews are not rodents,  their external physical appearance resembles a mouse or rat, which is why I said rodent.  Not every one knows what a shrew is, but say rodent and people instantly think of a mouse or rat.  Dogs have been co-evolving with man for at least 10000 years.   There is evidence of domestication and cohabitation that is almost 20000 years old.    I never even used the word tetrapod.

So it looks like you're looking for evidence of a change on a larger scale?       How about dinosaurs becoming birds? This is a site from UC Berkeley that has a pretty ok diagram. It's a little confusing to look at , but on the right hand side of the picture you'll see all of the fossil dino hands we have and the way they changed into bird's wings. You can see how the raptor-type dinosaurs already had a locomotion like modern birds. They just needed a new arm shape and some feathers. What they didn't need is feathered feet. And their feet didn't need to change shape. And if you look at birds' feet, you'll see the see same shape as dinosaur's feet, and you'll see scales and claws. Birds still have dinosaur feet.       Another good example with lots of fossil evidence is the whale's transition from land to sea. Here's a site from Berkeley again. You can see in that illustration that there is a clear progression from a four legged land animal to the modern whale. And you can scroll down and see some of the fossils. We actually have a ton of fossils for this major transition.       Want more?"

evolution,3ci999,illperipheral,2,Tue Jul 14 03:57:57 2015 UTC,"To add on to what others have said--I think the most important part of your question is the concept of 'one type of <animal> turning into another'. That's not an accurate summary of how evolution works.  There has never been a time where an animal has given birth to offspring of a different species. A good analogy is that the French and Spanish languages both share a common ancestor (Latin), but there was never a Latin-speaking mother that gave birth to a Spanish- or French-speaking child. Those languages came about after groups of Latin people became geographically separated and the languages evolved separately over time (new words, new spellings, new grammar rules, etc).  Biological evolution happens at the population level, among groups of breeding organisms. Speciation (generally) happens when populations of animals are separated geographically from other populations or are otherwise unable to interbreed with them. When this happens, genes can no longer flow between the two populations, and small changes in each population can over time become significant, since the small changes that occur aren't spread between the groups.  If those changes eventually become enough that the populations can no longer interbreed (even if they are no longer geographically separate), they are two different species (it's more complicated than that, but that's close enough).   Hopefully that made sense, but it's a complicated topic that a reddit post won't do justice. I'd strongly recommend reading 'Why Evolution is True', 'Evolution: What the fossils say and why it matters', or one of the many Dawkins books."
evolution,3ci999,Azurity,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"It's really going to depend on what you mean by ""proof."" Empirical science doesn't exactly deal with absolute ""proof,"" but rather a lot of incredibly strong circumstantial evidence. ""Proof"" requires a sort of logical, mathematical necessity, but we don't always have such an utterly complete understanding of the natural world that we can simply ""reason out"" exactly how something works; we have to, after all, test our hypotheses with experiments because our intuitions are very often wrong when tested scientifically. So really what we want is testable evidence, not proof, that either supports or denies a particular hypothesis/theory, and just go from there.  We certainly can't witness an event ""like a fish gradually turning into a different organism like human,"" since that's theorized to have taken millions of years over hundreds of thousands of generations. We instead have to rely on circumstantial evidence from paleontology (e.g. a collection of fossils that morphologically transition from fish-like to human-like, which appear in the fossil record at the right place and time) or from molecular phylogeny (examining DNA sequences from currently living species and backtracking through the mutations to a common ancestor between a particular fish species and humans, and inferring what sort of evolutionary path we each took based on those DNA mutations). There are other scientific fields which contribute to the theory of evolution, but those two are major ones.  As you can see, neither of them provide absolute ""proof"" in the mathematical sense, or in the logical ""this is the ONLY POSSIBLE THING that could have happened"" sense. Such is the nature of trying to rebuild natural history. But what you'll find, as you read about paleontology, molecular phylogeny, and other methods of evolutionary biology, is that they paint a pretty clear picture that evolutionary theory is the simplest, best, and most scientific explanation we have, based on what we observe today.   You say you've only found ""proof of one type of primate turning into another, or one type of bird turning into another"", but that's built on exactly the same methods and reasoning that connects us to every other living thing. It's certainly easier to imagine us evolving from something similar like another ape species, but evolutionary theory argues that we've always been evolving from something similar to us, but it just keeps going and going and things REALLY start changing. It might seem like a long extrapolation from fish to human, but it's a long series of very small incremental steps, one generation at a time."

That should immediately clue you in to the fact that the statement is untenable, and that there are major gaps in your conceptual understanding. So my answer to the question, is there proof that species of a ""type"" turn into species of a different ""type"", is that the question is ill-defined."

It's you that is drawing a line round some of them and calling them 'fish' and drawing a line around others and calling them 'humans'.  Evolution just describes how one group of atoms can, over a long line of descendants, give rise to a different-looking group of atoms. There's no reason to expect that process to have trouble crossing 'species boundaries', because these are just definitional boundaries you have constructed because you think that fish look very different to people.

evolution,3cdwns,Sanpaku,4,Tue Jul 7 04:59:38 2015 UTC,"Experimental evolution is a huge field. Lenski's E. coli thing is certainly the longest running experiment, but it's a very common technique for studying a wide variety of different evolutionary questions in many different organisms. In many experiments, the general idea is that you take a population in the lab, and expose them to some stimulus (higher temperatures, for example), and see how the population changes. Perhaps a particular genotype becomes more prevalent. The great strength of this approach is that you're doing it in the lab and can carefully control all the variables and use lots of replicates.   Here is a webpage from UC Riverside describing in more detail what exactly constitutes experimental evolution and some various methods and research goals. There's also a huge list of many different labs that use experimental evolution to answer research questions."

To get these two breeds from wolves you only breed the smallest wolves together to eventually get chihuahuas and the largest wolves together to eventually get saint bernards. Of course there's more traits than just size you need to selectively breed for to get these dogs but it follows the same idea.  So the reason why we have different breeds of dogs is because the branches of the family tree have been separated long enough to make these differences between them."

Tons. Here's a page from the American Museum of Natural History.       something that it's pretty simple that I can show?      If you're looking for something to show in a presentation or something, then can I suggest the cetaceans? It's a major transition with a lot of fossil evidence.      2 -      In how much time is it seen in them a change or adaptation? all adaptations progress the same way? or would a more drastic environmental change force a faster evolution/adaptation to it?      A more drastic environmental change would certainly affect the rate of evolution. Reznick and Endler showed in 1984 (?) that a population of guppies transplanted from an environment with strong selection from predators evolved very rapidly once the selective pressure was removed.      The strength of selective pressure is really obvious in things like antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics flood your system and kill everything they can, what's left are the resistant strains. That's evolution in a matter of days.     3 -       Trough evolution, human has developed rational thinking and symbolism. This really bothers me, how does one explain the, lets call it coincidence that humanity is the only species that has developed it and no other is developing it?      This needs no explanation! Rational thinking is evident in other species with great intellect. Chimps can reason and do so a lot. And for symbolism, we actually think dolphins have a complex language with syntax. They also have names and (maybe) surnames!"

I was asking for a simple form of proof of evolution that I can show to other people who doesn't believe in it actually lol. I know scientist have found our DNA is closer to monkeys than other species, but something that shows in a simple way how different species have a common ancestor?  Also, more questions!  ""having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one""  I have seen graphics of how LUCA is one, but if there was another primordial organism with other branches, those branches still reach present time?  And if LUCA originated from chemicals, nowdays are there still organism that come to life from let's say ""nothing"" like happened 4 billions years ago?  What"
evolution,3c2uwc,AnecdotallyExtant,4,Sat Jul 4 07:16:16 2015 UTC,"having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one   You're well read! Darwin didn't know what we know now though. It's pretty well established that it was breathed wholeheartedly into one.      New life would have a lot to compete with. As soon as a new biological molecule formed it would be consumed by anything around it that could possibly consume it. So a new beginning is not in the cards, I'm afraid. It would have to compete with all of the complex life that's already here.           For the horses: In a quick search this site includes this image which is a pretty thorough breakdown with teeth, skulls, feet and drawings of the animals. It doesn't have all of the ""transitional forms"" though.       Here's the results of an image search and you should be able to find a ton of good images there. (Beware, some of the images are on creationist websites.)   is there something specific that has made the humanity evolve so ahead of other species        (Well, we didn't really evolve ahead of anything, just in a different direction.)       This is really complicated question with a lot of answers. I'm sure I'll forget something here, so I apologize in advance, and I'm sure someone else will point out my omissions.       The most important thing that started us on the path to great intellect was walking upright. This did a few things.      It freed up our hands so tool use became more important. With greater tool use we could become physically weaker, which encouraged us to become better problem solvers, which encouraged more tool use, etc. etc.       Walking upright also allowed our brains to sit on top of a columnar spine. That let our brains grow very large compared to the rest of our bodies.       Then we started talking. Language reshaped our brains and encouraged a vast body of knowledge. So then there was selection for intelligence per se, because the people who could learn the most fared better.      There's also a change in our diets that came along with things like fire and fishing that provided our growing brains with the protein we need.       Again, pretty sure I'm forgetting any number of things, but that's the bare bones.            Edit:      but something that shows in a simple way how different species have a common ancestor?       I'm thinking Darwin's finches. It's simple, plain, obvious and all over the internet."

evolution,3c2uwc,Coles13,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:40:33 2015 UTC,"but something that shows in a simple way how different species have a common ancestor?   Haha, yeah, here's two:  for tetrapods, we all (mammals, amphibians, diapsids, etc.) evolved from something very similar to this which was only very recently (last 10 years) discovered.  Compare that to other late Devonian era sarcoterygians (a subclade of fish) and you can very easily see where terrestrial vertebrates came from.  For a more simple example, consider that all life on earth has the same genetic code.  All of us use the same four base pairs, five if you count the thymine => urasil switch in RNA.   is there something specific that has made the humanity evolve so ahead of other species though?   This is a misconception, and should be addressed.  There is no such thing as being ""more evolved"" except in the sense that it evolved over a longer period of time.  The only way humans are ""move evolved"" than anything else is if that species is extinct.  It's easy to think of humans as the pinnacle of evolution, to place ourselves at the top of the pyramid.  We aren't.  We're no more evolved than anything else still alive, we just got lucky in that the way we happened to evolve at a certain point in time gave us the ability to do things most other species cannot.  You may think that being the apex predator is being the most evolved.  It is not, or else the T-Rex would still be around and hummingbirds would not.  You may think that achieving flight is more evolved than climbing trees or walking the ground.  It is not, as we have several different examples of species losing the ability to fly in order to better adapt to their environment.  While I don't know off the top of my head if Cassowaries, emus, and ostriches had a common flightless ancestor they all radiated off of, I do know that the general penguin body-plan evolved twice, in unrelated lineages (aside from them both being birds) on opposite sides of the globe.  There's the flightless, swimming penguins of the Antarctic, and the flightless, swimming Great Auk of the Arctic, which sadly went extinct about 150 years ago."

To learn more about it take a look at abiogenesis.

evolution,3c2uwc,Aspergers1,6,Sat Jul 4 14:04:54 2015 UTC,"For 3, You have to understand the opportunity cost.  Brain power costs a LOT of energy. And I really mean a LOT. I have heard numbers as high at 30% of our oxygen being devoted to keeping our brain alive and 25% of our calories in energy. That's probably the NUMBER ONE reason we grew intelligent.  We only succeed because we cook our meat so that it is in sort, predigested for us and we waste less energy digesting it.  To cook our food, we need to be bipeds with opposable thumbs, so that we can hold things in our hands.  To hold things in our hands, we need to have had our ancestors basically live in trees  (where hands help with movements in trees) and been big enough to need fingers (squirrels can use their claws, but not bigger monkeys).  And so on...  and then, there is the brain scaling effect. You see, Brains are not all equal, and the Primate brain is pretty efficient in scaling up. In the video below rodents and primates are compared.  But, thanks to all of this, we have a lot more neurons than any other brains!  In humans, we have in average 86 billions neurons, 16 of which are in the cerebral cortex, which is the seat of functional thought (citation from the video below).  16 billions neurons in the cerebral cortex is the most of any species!

I like to reference the (1) fossil record; (2) microevolution -- small-scale, easily observable changes in allele frequency, like what happens when diseases are treated with certain drugs. Why do you think you need a flu shot every year? The flu evolves quite rapidly; (3) ring species demonstrate speciation events; (4) speciation events can be experimentally induced, so we can observe evolution in the lab; (5) homology. Sorry I didn't go into detail, but feel free to ask about them. These are just some straightforward, easy to reference lines of evidence. Evolution can happen very quickly or very slowly. It's always happening, though. Finite populations always experience changes in allele frequency -- by natural selection, gene flow, mutation, or genetic drift and even all four at once. Evolution is mostly dictated by the strength of selective pressures and the mutation rate. I wouldn't say all adaptations progress in the same way, but they are all brought about by the same process: natural selection. There have been many human species which have existed in the past. Most notably and recently were the Neanderthals. They may have had a capacity for rationality and symbolism. In any case, we see the primitive precursors to human cognition in our primate relatives, specifically chimpanzees and bonobos but others as well. Human evolution was driven by a unique combination of evolutionary ""innovations"": bipedalism, prehensile hands, group living, and an opportunistic diet. The human capacities for rationality and symbolism are likely byproducts of selection for social behaviour and language."
evolution,3c2uwc,CharlesInVT,2,Sat Jul 4 12:54:52 2015 UTC,"1: Yes there is, the evolution of the horse is very well understood. We know a LOT about horses, which is why it is so frequently used as an example of evolution, there are no missing links that creationists can point out. 1 2 3 .  2: Not all change happens at the same rate, it took humans millions of years to get as smart as we did yet it only took bacteria a few decades to evolve resistance to antibiotics.  3: There are a few reasons why such great intelligence is so rare in the animal kingdom:  A: Evolution never has an end goal. Evolution doesn't know that if it becomes smarter it will be more successful. If an individual doesn't benefit from being a little bit smarter, it won't evolve along that path.  B: A lot of animals get along just fine without intelligence, look at ants, they are dumb AF yet we find them on every continent except antarctica. There are quadrillions of them, there are in every measure more successful than we are, yet they lack intelligence.  C: The only reason we became so smart is because of some very unique circumstances. We evolved in a time where the climate in africa was not stable. The climate (not to be confused with the weather) was always changing. If it was hot and dry now, you could bet that in 1000 years it would be completely different. And 1000 years after that it will be once again very different. Which means our ancestors needed to adapt without evolving, 1000 years isn't nearly enough time to evolve to a new climate. The solution was to be smart enough to figure out new ways to survive in any climate. Which is why there are humans everywhere from above the arctic circle to the amazon rainforest.  D: always important to keep in mind. Humans have a tendency to measure an animals intelligence based on how similar it is to us. If it can do human things, like make tools, communicate with language, mourn its dead, than we consider it to be smart. As one guy who worked with dolphins said ""it isn't a matter of how smart are they, its one of how are they smart."" Just because other animals haven't landed on the moon or made massive cities of glass and steal doesn't mean they aren't smart.  E: Lastly, there are several trends we see in intelligent animals. For example, we see much more predators evolve intelligence than prey do. All prey has to worry about is keeping an eye out for danger and running as fast as it can. Predators have to worry about camouflage, stealth, tracking the animal, strategy, predicting its movements, so on and so forth. So of the most intelligent animals, almost all of them eat meat (with the exception of elephants and chimps). Also, it makes sense to me that this might also have to do with the fact that intelligence takes A LOT of energy. Right now your brain is using about a 5th your energy (unless you're running a marathon or something). The best way to get that much energy is by eating meat, plants rarely provide enough energy to fuel a big brain, which is why we evolved to be carnivorous. Another trend we see amongst intelligent animals is that they are almost always social creatures. Humans, elephants, dolphins, crows (yes, crows are very intelligent). Being social has a lot of requirements, you have to remember your relationship with other individuals, it helps to remember relationships between other individuals. You need to read the intentions of others. So on and do forth."

Her selfish genes essentially enslave the rest of the hive and her selfish genes want to create as many reproductives as possible.      So if she's the genetic pool that the super-organism is drawn from then the workers having selfish genes would have her selfish genes and would work in favor of the queen.

evolution,3c4bho,AceAntagonist,6,Sat Jul 4 17:23:53 2015 UTC,"The gay uncle theory described by SweaterMe above is the most regularly explored. I'll offer another.  Exclusive homosexuality may be a recent phenomenon, and arguably culturally mediated. For much of history, and possibly prehistory, most of our ancestors with homosexual orientations were not exclusively homosexual. In many past, and a few current societies, dalliances with the same sex didn't incur the same moral opprobrium as they did under European Christianity. Among other animals, though homosexual behavior is very common, exclusive homosexuality (such as among 10% of male sheep) is so rare as to merit singling out.  There are genetic predispositions for sexual orientation, but surely many of the responsible genes aren't on the smallest, Y chromosome. Even those on the X chromosome must split their time between occupying female and male bodies. Hence these genes must find a balancing act between discriminating against infertile mating partners when in bodies with one set of developmental cues, but not so much that they would discriminate against the same  partner when occupying bodies of the other sex. Eg. a gene that potently imparted a preference for mating with males and rejection of female partners would require equally potent developmental/hormonal repression when occupying male bodies in order to persist in the gene pool.   But regulation of gene expression is for good reasons usually analog, and not digital (on/off). At least in higher vertebrates with internal fertilization, the fitness costs for occasional infertile matings are small compared to the costs of a gene that might prescribe no mating, or exclusively infertile matings, in some developmental/hormonal contingency. It may not pay for a genetic predispositions to be too discriminating, and analog regulated genes for sexual preference may have a selective advantage over those for exclusive sexual orientation, with equally exclusive regulation.  To some extent, that's what we see in things like the Kinsey scale. Personally, I fall around 1.5 on that scale: mostly heterosexual, but I have experienced arousal viewing others of my own sex. I wouldn't be suprised if many of us fell in between the 0 and 6 that are doctrinaire in the modern era of identity politics."
evolution,3c4bho,Sanpaku,10,Sat Jul 4 20:52:52 2015 UTC,Evolution operates via natural selection but it is essentially impossible for a trait to evolve where it benefits the population and hurts the individual. It's just not favorable. Each organism is trying its hardest to ensure more offspring and the best survival for their offspring. Say there are two animals. One is homosexual and has no children. The other is heterosexual and makes 3 children. The heterosexual one passes its genes on while the other does not. What does the next population consist of?   An frontrunning theory is the gay uncle theory. A man with a gay brother has someone without kids to take care of his own kids. The uncle provides his nephews and nieces with a better chance of survival. They are blood relatives so he still has some genetic benefit from this investment.  Hope that makes sense! I can clarify more if needed.

evolution,3c4bho,CharlesInVT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:20:21 2015 UTC,"I guess that depends on who you define as the ""recipient"" in the interaction.  A spiteful behaviour might involve kamikaze-like suicide where both the actor and recipient are killed, selected for because (for example) the recipient is non-kin, and kin ultimately benefit due to the death of the recipient.  If instead you say that ""kin"" are the recipients, then yes, it's ""altruism"".  It's the same either way really, and of course without the kin in this example the ""spite"" would be unexplainable, but I prefer to use definitions that describe the actual, direct interaction between the individuals.  And then you have a greater number of words to describe what's actually going on.  Mutualism, altruism, selfishness, and spite."

I do mean that, honestly, I'm not signed up to one theory or another and am quite interested in being educated in this regard."
evolution,3c4bho,armitage_shank,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:09 2015 UTC,"Basically, you can put what ever names you want on anything you want.  At some level if you are going to study it as science you need to define things in terms of measurable parameters.  If you define altruism as a measurable quantity it is when group and individual selection are acting in opposition.  Spiteful behavior are behaviors that lower the fitness of both the actor and the recipient.  Basically the lowering of the recipients fitness is irrelevant unless as a consequence it raises the fitness of the group.  If it does then it is altruism.  In MLS language Hamilton's cost can be shown to be the strength of individual selection, and benefit can be shown to be the strength of group selection.  This is a mathematical fact.  Hamilton's rule is as much about MLS as it is about kin selection.  The problem is that terms like ""altruism"" and ""spite"" are culturally loaded terms that non MLS people use loosely ignoring any formal definition of the terms.  Altruism as I said has a very formal definition.  Spite also has a very formal definition.  Spite may or may not be altruism, depending on the population structure, and the nature of how selection is working.  Importantly, this is an empirical question that can only be answered experimentally."

Biological altruism is not the same as colloquial or philosophical uses of the word. Under evolutionary theory altruism evolves because it is reciprocal (explained as adaptive via game theory), or because it increases inclusive fitness by helping relatives more than non relatives (kin altruism and suchlike). The colloquial or philosophical sense doesn't even really make sense for many classical examples since it demands conscious intent which is probably lacking in insects, plants, and yeast. There's no fitness advantage to true altruism (like a deer kindly feeding itself it to wolves to save them from starving) so such behaviour could not be directly selected for."

I'm seriously thinking about adding a little ticker to the bottom of it and counting the number of times I copy it. But it's got some great info about same sex sexual behavior in animals.            The answer is really unclear about humans. There have been twin studies, etc. and it's clearly not as simple as a ""gay gene"". Currently the best explanation to my mind is an epigenetic idea. Epigenetics is the differences in gene expression that are not caused by changes or differences in DNA, but instead influenced by some other process that affects gene expression. So in twin studies we see that there is a greater probability of both being homosexual than other sibling pairs, but it's not 100%, which suggests that there is something else going on besides just DNA. We aren't quite sure about this one yet, but it seems it's some combination of genetics and environment.     For non-humans, there was a question about that in this sub yesterday in /r/AskScience, weeks ago and I will copy my answer from there:      We pretty much see same sex behavior everywhere we've looked. Here is a paper about same sex behavior in animals. It contains a brief list (explicitly non-exhaustive) of animals that have been documented. It contains everything from insects to birds to mammals to worms. The social structure of the populations are all over the place, from solitary to totally social. The same sex behavior ranges from completely consensual, to 'traumatic insemination'.       If you control+F and search this paper for the word 'social' you'll find 36 results in 8 pages. It seems to be heavily influenced by social factors and also heavily influences social factors. In guppies, male-male interactions happen a lot more often in male only populations, but the behavior persists in those populations once females are introduced. In bonobos, sex in general (including same-sex interactions and incestual interactions) are a sort of social glue. They don't attempt to answer whether the behavior is more frequent in social animals, but it's pretty clear that sociality plays a large role, in a few ways.         Here I was answering a question about sociality and same sex behavior, but you can get the idea. It's pretty much everywhere. As far as we can tell, same sex sexual behavior is the rule in animals, and humans are certainly not an exception."
evolution,3c4bho,WildZontar,4,Sun Jul 5 04:31:09 2015 UTC,"In short, probably not. The only way it'd be adaptive is if somehow heterosexual people who have homosexual relatives were more fit (have more kids) than those who don't. Otherwise, you would not expect the genes which cause homosexuality to increase in frequency. Additionally, overpopulation is (as far as I'm aware) not a very common problem in hominid history until recently. As such, even if there are pressures to reduce the number of reproductive individuals there hasn't been enough time for selection to cause such an adaptation.  There are two hypotheses I'm aware of to there being an advantage for genes which are involved in homosexuality. First is similar to why humans live so long after childbearing age, and that would be that non-reproductive members of a group of related individuals (i.e. Homosexuals and the elderly) help to rears the children of those who are reproductive and are related to them. In this way, there is still an arguably an advantage in keeping genes involved with homosexuality and longevity in the population. The other (regarding homosexuality in males, though in theory something similar could be happening for females) is that some of the genes which cause females to be attracted to males exist on the X chromosome, and some females get a copy which highly expresses those genes. Usually in males they aren't expressed to a high enough degree to counteract the other mechanisms which cause them to be attracted to females, but with this particular variant of the X chromosome they can be. This results in males who have that X to be more likely to be homosexual, but also in females who have that chromosome to produce more offspring themselves.   Lastly, as our population has undergone rapid expansion, more ""rare"" phenotype a regarding personality and sexuality increase in number along with the rest of the population. When populations were in the hundreds of thousands or millions, it wouldn't be unreasonable to not be aware of something which occurs in a low percent of the population because there are fewer and you would also be exposed to fewer people in general. But given that we're now at over 7 billion people on Earth with travel and communication being far easier today than at any other point in history, along with a cultural climate that is more open to discussing these things, there's never been a time where people who deviate from the ""norm"" could have such exposure.  tl;dr the adaptive benefits of homosexuality are debatable, especially as far as population control are concerned. Population expansion, along with advancements in technology and culture, has rather more likely exposed sexual variation that already existed but was hard to ""find"" before."

evolution,3c4bho,pappypapaya,5,Sun Jul 5 04:01:58 2015 UTC,"Nature doesn't ""control"" anything. Evolution is not directed. Mutations are introduced at random, and dependent on their effects rise to high frequency in the population or die out. Unless a species has a long and consistent history of problems with overcrowding, there will almost certainly be no adaptive response in that population to overcrowding in the short term because there would have been no selective pressure to cause those traits to increase in frequency.  Additionally looking at the raw number of homosexuals in the world today vs 200 years ago is not helpful because there are flat out more people in the world today vs 200 years ago. What one needs to consider is the proportion of homosexuals in the world today vs 200 years ago. And quite frankly we don't have the data to be able to say one way or another whether that has actually increased.  Is it possible what you're saying is correct? Sure.

Nature doesn't ""control"" things, nature has no mind of it's own.

evolution,3c4bho,Somasong,2,Sun Jul 5 04:30:40 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of misconceptions about evolution here. First, homosexuality did not evolve as a means to curb population. Trait's don't evolve because they help the species, traits only evolve because they help individuals compete against other individuals for reproductive success. There's no such thing as evolution acting ""for the good of the species"", because nature has no conscience or end goal.  The second main misconception is that all traits evolve because they are beneficial. This leads people to seek adaptive explanations for traits that aren't adaptive. Just because homosexuality exists in humans (and other species) does not mean it's advantageous (nor does it mean it's disadvantageous) for the individual/gene.  But let's assume homosexuality is evolutionarily beneficial, for whatever reason. Evolution is not a moral theory, it simply describes what happens in nature, it does not prescribe what should happen. Nature does not think nor does it plan, and so it has nothing to say about morality or ethics. Thus, evolution says nothing about how gay people should or ought to behave, and thus, it says nothing about how you should form an opinion about what other people should or ought to behave. I'll give you an analogy: Gravity describes how planets move and objects fall, it doesn't say that objects should fall and it doesn't say we shouldn't flying in planes because planes cause a lot of pollution. It simply describes the motion of objects, just as evolution describes the ""motion"" of genes through time.  Oh, and over-population has not been a problem for humankind until recently.

It's a bad analogy, and a bad explanation of kin selection to someone who doesn't know kin selection, without any guidance on how the analogy is supposed to be interpreted in the context of human sexuality.  Ironically, the first article you posted says: ""At the present time, there is no quantified statistics on the reproductive benefits of having a homosexual relative. Ultimately, kin selection seems a lot more evolutionarily plausible for female worker ants and bees (with their genetic peculiarity of being more closely related to the queen’s offspring than to any offspring of their own) than it does for homosexual human beings."" To summarize, it reviews current evolutionary theories for homosexuality, and argues against the first four of five, while proposing a potential model of group selection, which while interesting, has not (to my knowledge) been tested.  And the second article says: ""Previous research conducted in Western countries (U.S., UK) has failed to find any support for this hypothesis. In contrast, research conducted in Samoa has provided repeated support for it. In light of these cross-cultural differences, we hypothesized that the development of elevated avuncular (i.e., altruistic uncle-like) tendencies in androphilic males may be contingent on a relatively collectivistic cultural context. [...] The results of this study furnished no evidence that androphilic Japanese men exhibited elevated avuncular tendencies compared to their gynephilic counterparts."" though there is evidence in Samoan and Polynesian cultures.  So neither paper you've cited supports your claim. I'm not saying there isn't evidence for a Hamiltonian hypothesis, but it isn't strong, and there are a number of competing evolutionary, sociocultural, and neurological/developmental models, among which there is not strong consensus around any single explanation. Though if you had better papers than the ones you listed, I'd be happy to read them. I have googled it in the past, and as far as I can tell, there's no consensus."

Barthes et al. 2013: ""This kin selection hypothesis has received little empirical support in Western societies and is still debated (Bobrow & Bailey, 2001; Rahman & Hull, 2005; Vasey & VanderLaan, 2010).""  VanderLaan et al. 2015: ""Homosexual males who were feminine as children experienced elevated childhood concern for kin. [...] Future research should also examine whether kin-directed altruism helps offset fitness costs of same-sex sexual orientation.""  Vasey and VanderLaan et al. 2013: ""Overall, these tests indicate that the female kin of male androphiles produce more offspring than those of male gynephiles.""  Burri et al. 2015: ""Theoretical and mathematical models have proposed two broad variants of balancing selection as putative compensatory mechanisms for human homosexuality: heterozygote advantage and sexually antagonistic selection. [...] Other behavioral data, e.g., on social preferences, which are relevant to alternative evolutionary models for the maintenance of homosexuality (such as kin selection, whereby gay relatives enhance the survival of their siblings’ offspring through caregiving or resource provision), are also only available for men.""  Pfaus et al. 2012: ""One such benefit could be related to kin selection (e.g., Wilson, 1975), as in the ‘‘gay uncle hypothesis’’ that has received much attention but little empirical support in Westernculture (Bobrow & Bailey, 2001), although it appears to be supported among the Samoan fa’afafine (Vasey & VanderLaan, 2010)""  Forrester, VanderLaan et al. Vasey 2011: ""Consistent with the KSH and findings from Samoa, androphilic men exhibited a significantly greater cognitive dissociation between altruistic tendencies directed toward kin versus non-kin children relative to gynephilic men and androphilic women. The present study, therefore, provides some tentative support for the KSH from a culture other than Samoa. Findings and future directions for research are considered within the context of the existing cross-cultural literature.""  Ablid et al. Vasey 2013: ""Support for this hypothesis has been garnered from studies conducted in Samoa, but not from studies of “gay” men in industrialized cultures (i.e., Canada, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States). This cross-cultural difference may be due to relatively greater geographic and familial disconnect experienced by androphilic “gay” men in industrialized cultures. This article reasons that in more industrialized settings, friends’ children may serve as non-adaptive proxies for nieces and nephews. Hence, it was predicted that Canadian androphilic men would exhibit elevated altruistic tendencies toward their friends’ children compared with gynephilic men and androphilic women. This prediction was not supported.""  Bobrow and Bailey 2011: ""We tested the kin selection hypothesis of male homosexuality using questionnaire data in a community sample of homosexual and heterosexual men. Homosexual men were no more likely than heterosexual men to channel resources toward family members. Indeed, heterosexual men tended to give more financial resources to siblings than homosexual men. Furthermore, homosexual men were somewhat more estranged from family members, especially from fathers and oldest siblings.""  Rahman et al. 2005: ""The current investigation, following Bobrow and Bailey (2001), aimed to test the kin selection theory of homosexuality in human males using a survey design. A total of 60 heterosexual and 60 homosexual men from England [...] Overall, little support was found for the kin selection theory in a community sample.""  and Rahman et al. 2005 Erratum: ""It is worth noting that while the percentages in Tables 1, 2 appear to show a difference between heterosexual and homosexual men in the homosexual paternal line male relatives and homosexual paternal line female relatives (where homosexual men are not hypothesized to have more homosexual relatives), the difference between the two groups is not actually statistically significant.""  Camperio-Ciani et al. 2004: ""Wilson (1975), attempting to solve the paradox, suggested a possible role for homosexuals as helpers in their families, increasing the fitnesses of their relatives and, thus, balancing their reduced direct fitness. However, both Muscarella (2000) and Bobrow & Bailey (2001) in recent empirical studies, showed that homosexuals do not act as helpers and do not give more financial or emotional resources to siblings than do heterosexual men. Other studies by R˘ . Trivers (personnal communication), Rice (1998) and Miller (2000) have suggested the partial penetrance of a candidate homosexual genetic factor and hypothesized that pleiotropic or sexually antagonistic effects, acting on personality, increase fecundity in non-homosexual carriers, thereby balancing the reduction in homosexual fecundity (Miller 2000). No supportive evidence or empirical data, however, has yet been shown.""  Vasey et al. 2007: ""Although the greater avuncular tendencies of fa'afafine support the basic prediction of the Kin Selection Hypothesis for male androphilia, further research is needed before one can conclude that these elevated tendencies represent a specially designed adaptation for promoting the fitness of kin. We discuss a number of sociocultural factors that might promote the expression of avuncular tendencies by androphilic males in Independent Samoa.""  Kirkpatric 2000: ""Three adaptationist hypotheses are reviewed here and compared with the anthropological literature. There is little evidence that lineages gain reproductive advantage through offspring care provided by homosexual members. Therefore, there is little support for the hypothesis that homosexuality evolved by kin selection. Parents at times control children’s reproductive decisions and at times encourage children in homosexual behavior. There is therefore more support for the hypothesis of parental manipulation. Support is strongest, however, for the hypothesis that homosexual behavior comes from individual selection for reciprocal altruism.""  Camperio-Ciani et al. 2008: ""Kin selection was earlier invoked [13], [16], [17], and later refuted [18], [19]. Other suggestions followed, the more recent debate being broadly focused on three lines of argument, not all based on genetic factors: overdominance (i.e. male heterozygous advantage, [7], [20]–[22]), maternal effects on male offspring (such as maternal selection [23], or maternal genomic imprinting [9]), and sexually antagonistic selection [2], [13], [15], [24]–[27].""  So, it seems to me that the general consensus is that kin selection (in the context of homosexuality) is not well supported cross-cullturally, though there are supporters of kin selection, mainly the cluster within the discipline who work with the Samoan population. In other cultures, the evidence is negative or inconclusive. There is yet no quantitative test of the form of Hamilton's rule. Alternative evolutionary hypotheses, such as heterozygous advantage and sexually antagonistic selection, seem better supported than kin selection, although the jury is still out.  I would like to thank you though, the above exercise has been illuminating. If you have a rebuttal, I would be glad to hear it."

And I think that all of those sort-of narrative explanations for human same sex behavior are missing the glaringly obvious fact that we see it everywhere. Any explanation for the evolution of same sex behavior in humans will have to include at least a common vertebrate ancestor. Maybe much earlier.       I really think those researchers are barking up the wrong tree. What they should be asking is why we see an exclusive preference for the same sex in humans. The only other animal we see that in is the domestic sheep. Which have been under artificial selection for so long that they're a basically worthless model.

But as /u/limede pointed out, it's potentially pointless to wait for that.     There are a number of reasons I don't buy it.      First thing is a general red flag. The paper is hand-wavy. They present a ton of info and then MAGIC pooof Eusociality.      But they never provide a nice clean paragraph with a clear logical progression. So the reader has to really study the paper the see what they're saying. Big red flag. So I looked more closely.     The logical progression, as far as I can tell, goes:      Nitrogen shortage --> Oviproduction costs --> MAGIC --> Alloparenting --> developmental shift in alloparents --> hormonal change --> Loss of microbiota --> Alloparenting --> Eusociality     There are any number of problems with that. It's circular, with alloparenting leading to alloparenting. There's a big magical step that's not explained or shown empirically.         And those aren't even the major problems.      The theory relies on the premise that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Which we all know is not true.      And even that explanation is also itself circular. The basic argument being ""It evolved this way because it is this way.""     Then there are holes in the steps. A nitrogen shortage for oviproduction is not an issue that the Cryptocercus hadn't already overcome. They cannibalize if they have to. So there's no initial step in the logic.      The next big hole is that they never explain why the microbiota would be suddenly absent in the termites prior to molting. In the Cryptocercus the microbiota are retained after the third molt. The explanation given for the loss of microbiota in the termites is that hormonal changes resulting from alloparenting somehow kills the microbiota. But again, this was not an issue for the Cryptocercus. So the idea relies on a trait evolving that would be heavily selected against.      The obvious prediction to my mind would be selection against the individuals with that trait. Their prediction is Eusociality.       I think that covers almost everything. But the BIGGEST problem is that this scheme absolutely begs for cheaters. Any individual that started taking advantage of the colony snatches a GIANT advantage and selection would quickly end eusociality.       So I think that covers it.     Thoughts?"

However, the research has shown that those whose style of thinking is reason based tend to be able to grasp it better than those style of thinking is emotion based.

And if it were a type of protein, it would be far from the ""most basic type"". Proteins are just strings of amino acids, and they can be as short as you like: peptides can have just two amino acids linked together, for example.    Clearly the idea that these proteins could form by chance is absurd   Agreed! Good thing nobody is suggesting this. RNA as we know it today is understood to be the product of a very long process of refinement by evolution. We don't know exactly what molecules were involved in abiogenesis, but it's a reasonable bet that they were a lot simpler than the more complex examples of modern-day strands of RNA.   Simply not enough evidence for macroevolution.   This is a weird claim, given the mountains of evidence we have for macroevolution. It's in the fossil record, and visible in genetic studies, and helps us systematically group the living animals we see today. There's tons of evidence for species-level changes.   For macroevolution to happpen, some sort of process must exist to add information to the creature's genetic code.   There are a number of examples of chromosome-doubling, where organisms end up inheriting an extra version of one chromosome. If this ends up being non-fatal, and we know this can happen because we sometimes do it on purpose to plants, then the organism ends up with extra loci that selection can act on.    Why in the world were the complex fossils found in the Cambrian rock?   I don't know about this case in particular.    If structural homology was result of common ancestry, it should show up in genetic codes of the organisms that possess similar structures.   It does! In the last few decades some amazing genetic connections have been discovered across really distant parts of the evolutionary tree. The genes which code for specific body-parts tend to be quite different, but it seems the developmental genes, which act like switches to say 'make an arm here' or 'make eyes here' are much more conserved. They're not identical across all species, of course, but very similar genes can be found across basically all complex life!"
evolution,3bmshq,autopoetic,3,Tue Jun 30 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"Hox genes may be good evidence for macroevolution because we can see how the developmental body plan of organisms can change with just a few mutations.

evolution,3bmshq,lordofcatan10,4,Tue Jun 30 22:37:03 2015 UTC,"One major correction to the last bit. Its entirely false that homologous structures tend to be specified by different genes. They are almost universally specificed the by the same genes. The majority of macroevoutionary change is driven by cis-regulatory evolution (promoters and enhancers) which control the timing, amount and localization of gene expression. Someone below mentioned Hox genes as an example. In mammals, which show huge variation in limbs, there is almost no Hox gene variation at all. Instead, the expression patterns of otherwise (basically) identical hox genes very between species, leading to different limb bud patterning during development."
evolution,3bmshq,Pudding_Town,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:18:51 2015 UTC,"Its entirely false that homologous structures tend to be specified by different genes.    I took it that the regulatory genes were very similar, but the genes activated by those regulatory genes are quite different. I thought that's what I said, and it seems like what you're saying too.

evolution,3bmshq,autopoetic,2,Wed Jul 1 15:02:08 2015 UTC,"No, in fact the opposite is true. Regulatory elements are more evolutionary flexible than their downstream targets. The terminal genes that make up a limb are really fundamental genes involved in the developmental of basically all structures. Limb muscles contain actin and myosin, skin cells form particular types of cell-cell adhesions, osteoblasts deposit bone and glycoproteins. Most of the genes that control these really fundamental cell phenotypes are conserved all the way from mammals to single-celled eukaryotes. The transcription factors are much more likely to be lineage-specific (e.g. expansions of the hox gene clusters through duplication).   Edit: The is actually probably the main take away about the evolution of gene regulation. Its really hard to evolve critical genes involved in cell phenotype because they're so important to function (under strong purifying selection). Transcription factors are all well, but they are able to evolve more freely because they principally gain new function through 'jumping' between pathways through non-coding mutations which create novel binding sites outside of the coding regions."

It did not form by chance, but by natural selection for stable molecules. Macroevolution results from microevolution occurring over extended periods of time. The differences between species are exaggerated versions of the differences between individuals within species. This is just wrong and overused despite countless refutations and explanations. This is the worst one of all probably. Homologies by definition are genetic, and in countless cases we do observe the same genes coding for the same phenotypes across species. Also, what exactly genes programme is heavily dependent upon context -- upon what other genes are present in the organism and the developmental process. The genetic material itself is a universal homology. This final objection is profoundly misguided."
evolution,3bmshq,astroNerf,6,Tue Jun 30 14:31:13 2015 UTC,"Others have addressed your main points already. I'll answer in my own way.   I personally am an atheist...   There are atheists who don't accept evolution, so being an atheist really says nothing about your position on anything other than whether you believe gods exist. It's irrelevant.   Abiogenesis - RNA is the most basic type of protein. Yet, it is so complicated. Clearly the idea that these it could form by chance is absurd, which makes abiogenesis very hard for a scientist to believe.   Definitely check out the RNA World Hypothesis. You can see video animations showing how the first proto-life might have arisen. At the very least, proto-life forming as a result of RNA self-polymerisation is at least plausible. I would go out on a limb and say that most biologists and biochemists would consider proto-life forming this way to be far more likely compared to, say, magic.   For macroevolution to happpen, some sort of process must exist to add information to the creature's genetic code.    Mutations add ""information"" all the time. I've put information in quotations because this is a mis-use of information theory. DNA is not information, and is instead a molecular machine that can be represented as information. If the printed letters on a page in a book could make imperfect copies of themselves, you'd probably not refer to it solely as ""information"".  Talk Origins claim CB102 addresses this falsehood.   Cambrian explosion - Representatives from every major animal phylum starts from the Cambrian rock.    Correction: most. Not all.   Walter Scotts found animals that were suppose to be in the Silurian and Devonian rock, instead, these complex animals were found in the Cambrian rock.    I'm not sure who Walter Scotts is. Without knowing who he is, or what animals we're talking about, it's hard to comment here.   ... forearms of bats,birds,man, and porpoise look so similar. If each one of these creatures inherited its forearm structure from a common ancestor, then the portions of DNA which contain information about the forearm would all have come from tat same common ancestor...   It does.  Check out the sonic hedgehog protein, which is encoded in the (you guessed it!) sonic hedgehog gene, controls when and where fingers are formed.  Here's a short video that explains what this is all about.    I'll end with a very broad point: creationists (those who write textbooks, rather than the misinformed people who are taught creationism in school or at home) tend to be very dishonest. Now, this is a bold claim, but I'm willing to back it up with a boatload of evidence: check out AronRa's The Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism. It's long, but it's incredibly exhaustive. Consider getting your science information from people who do not need to resort to dishonesty to be convincing."

The Cambrian so-called-""explosion"" lasted almost 50 million years, and some modern phyla have analogs that go back well into the Ediacaran, adding another 20 million years or so to the timeline. The beginning of the Cambrian era is defined as 542 mya, the Burgess Shale dates to ~505 mya. The first known halkierids and mollusks (~536 mya) are separated from brachiopods and archaeocyatha (possibly somehow related to sponges) by about 8 million years, which are themselves separated from trilobites by another ~9 million years. At least one modern phylum (tardigrades) doesn't appear in the fossil record for another 10 million years or so after the Burgess Shale fauna. And some of the lineages that appear in the Cambrian still aren't soundly placed amongst modern phyla. Even with all we've discovered in the last 150 years, there are four separate competing theories about the placement of halkierids, one of which is that they aren't related to any modern phylum.  To put it in perspective, that ~50-70 million year span is roughly the same amount of time as it's been since the K-T extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs (~66 mya), which has been plenty of time for the proliferation of most modern mammalian lineages. The idea that all modern phyla suddenly proliferated out of nowhere is pure fantasy. At the absolute best, it's an artifact of the state of the fossil record as it existed in the mid-to-late 19th century, not a thing that actually happened. We know better now, so the only reason this myth is so persistent is because it's ideologically necessary to creationists.   Walter Scotts found animals that were suppose to be in the Silurian and Devonian rock, instead, these complex animals were found in the Cambrian rock. According to the geological column, some of these animals were supposed to be formed much later. Why in the world were the complex fossils found in the Cambrian rock?   Who is Walter Scotts? Are you talking about Charles Wolcott, maybe? The guy who discovered the Burgess Shale? Because there's no one named Walter Scotts, or anything close to that, who is associated with Cambrian biology. Or with anything else that I can find, for that matter.  Also, the scenario you've described here never actually happened. The distinction between Cambrian and Silurian biota and geology was well established in the scientific community even before Darwin published On the Origin of Species. Trilobite fossils were first discovered in 1698.   Apparently structural homology is not the result of similar DNA sequences.   Structural homology is the result of commonly-derived DNA sequences by definition. That's literally what the word ""homology"" means.   Apparently homologous structures are specified by quite different genes in different species.   This is a half-truth deliberately taken out of context and presented as if it were the whole truth. Effector genes may vary from phylum to phylum, but the Hox genes that regulate them are highly conserved and function in pretty much the same way in every single animal species on Earth, from bugs to Belgians.  The amount of research that has been done on homology, Hox genes, and homeotic mutation is staggering. Your book apparently ignores literally all of it."

I just can't think of a natural advantage the complex vagina has in a reproductive sense, and that's what should be driving evolution.   The only part that does make sense to me is the male penis evolving in tandem, since in utero (or in egg or whatever) it's all the same stuff and a chromosome determines whether it's an outtie or an innie. But every lineage of duck family with normal genitalia had to either die out or get ""sexed"" into the family of mutated genitalia, and that just seems impossible to me.

Also, to be clear, female ducks can manipulate their vaginas to make it easier for males they want to mate with to fertilize them.  To put it simply, the evolutionary advantage is that female ducks who get to choose which males successfully fertilize them tend to produce more/fitter offspring than those who don't."
evolution,3bkimd,Aspergers1,2,Tue Jun 30 00:37:40 2015 UTC,"but wouldn't that ""choosiness"" equal fewer children?   No, there is a limit to how many children they can provide for. This is why there is so much competition between males. Males can mate whenever. Females are only availible to mate when they aren't already caring for young. If 75% of the females are caring for their young, then only 25% of females are ready to mate, yet 100% of males are, which means the number of males who are looking for love is 4 times that of the females. Hence, only the males that can compete can mate. And, since all the males are always competing for females, females don't have to compete, they just find a male and get it on. Meaning that females are not limited by how many mates they can find, but how many babies they can feed. Therefor, they will have pretty much just as many offspring no matter who they mate with.  TLDR: Female ducks have it made."
evolution,3bkimd,DrowsySauce,3,Sat Jul 4 14:47:33 2015 UTC,"You're right, if any male duck can have sex with any female duck there would be more of the species but large numbers aren't everything.  Quality over quantity and such.  A male with terrible genes (let's say poor eyesight) may not have the best vision, but it could still rape a female and spread that bad gene.  But a female that can chose who can and can't breed with her can choose the mate with the ""strongest"" traits."
evolution,3bkimd,Pudding_Town,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:59:23 2015 UTC,"No, female ducks are more limited by the number of offspring they can support per year than the number of mating encounters they can have. All they need is 1 successful mating a year and they can hit their maxinum number of viable offspring for the season. Even better that they can be selective about which male is the father (they actually have muscular control of the labyrinth stucture to make it easier for a male they want to mate with."
evolution,3bkimd,gwargh,2,Wed Jul 1 01:38:32 2015 UTC,"This is simply an example of sexual selection, albeit not the way it's usually introduced.   So, let's talk peacocks - the peacock's tail is clearly not an advantageous trait in that it decreases his ability to survive. These things are huge - local predators are fast, being slowed down is not good. Why it's been selected for is not because it provides a clear reproductive or physical advantage, but because it is a signal for females.  Mate choice matters in any organism where the amount of investment a parent puts into the offspring is quite high. For instance, an oak tree couldn't care less about making choices about its mates because it has hundreds of thousand offspring at once, and each one is a very small investment. In birds, on the other hand, the female has to invest a lot of energy in both producing the egg and parental care following hatching. So, the female wants an indicator that the male is a good choice for her. Ergo we get peacock tails.   Good so far? Well, suppose ducks have a pressure to evolve some big costly trait because the females are getting choosy. One way to circumvent the choice is to evolve higher rapiness (for lack of a better term). That way, you don't care whether the female chooses you, so you don't need to have the costly trait. This causes sexually antagonistic selection - the females would prefer to choose, the males would prefer to mate as cheaply as possible. How do the females get the males to follow their strategy? Well, make it harder for them to rape. A female who cannot be fertilized by rape still gets to choose the male she'd prefer to mate with (they have some control over their labyrinthine vaginas).  Hopefully that all made sense, writing this up late and with very little sleep."
evolution,3bkimd,Aspergers1,2,Wed Jul 1 03:15:41 2015 UTC,"So if one female duck was born with a more difficult to penetrate vagina than the rest, doesn't that make it harder for that duck to reproduce? How is it that in this one instance a trait is passed on that becomes the norm of the species when the result of the mutation is LESS reproduction?   It may seem nonsensical at first that ducks would evolve measures that prevent them from reproducing. Think about this, in ducks, the males compete for females. And females get to pick whatever male they want. Of course, this fierce competition between males leads to some resorting to rape to pass on their genes. Since the female gets to choose any mate she likes, it makes the most sense to choose the most fit male to be her mate and she is pretty much guaranteed to mate regardless. But if she gets raped, she looses that choice entirely. Which means it makes a lot of sense for female ducks to evolve measures against rape, that way they can still pick the finest male no matter what happens, and end up having children who are more fit.   Also, she has muscles that allow her to do this, these anti-rape counter measures can be toggled on and off. So it doesn't harm her chances of mating when she wants to, only when she doesn't want to."

But yes, in general the view is that many historic selective pressures on humans have been removed or greatly lessened by modern technology. However, our rapidly advancing society has introduced all sorts of other pressures. Marriage age is shifting. Child bearing age is shifting. The number of children people have is shifting. The options people have in terms of living a healthy vs unhealthy lifestyle is changing.   All these things and more will definitely induce new selective pressures on the population. And recent studies have absolutely shown that there are locations in our genomes still under selection. The thing is, it's really hard to get enough human genome data in order to have statistical certainty about the details of such selection because individual effects tend to be small, and there are ethical issues surrounding the mass collection and distribution of human genetic data."
evolution,3bj0em,WildZontar,5,Mon Jun 29 17:07:09 2015 UTC,"I feel that the 'lesser fit' humans can pass on their traits because they are surviving in this comfortable modern time.   The very definition of ""fit"" is ""able to survive and reproduce"".  If people are able to do that, then they are - BY DEFINITION - ""fit"".  Modern technology does not free us from the forces of selection and evolution - it merely alters the nature and strength of those forces.  Some things that used to be strongly selective no longer are.  That's not the same thing.  Evolution is a natural force.  It is the inevitable consequence of the existence of a few basic premises: existence of heritable variation, competition for resources, etc.  It can't be halted or escaped, any more than gravity can."
evolution,3bj0em,Smeghead333,6,Mon Jun 29 22:16:27 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding the ""natural"" in natural selection. It refers to the idea that even in absence of humans, differential survival and reproductive rates cause changes in trait frequency of a population. So, the human environment changing does not actually change whether natural selection is acting on humans. Sure, the directions/types of selection change, but we're still evolving just the same.   Additionally you may be overestimating the effect of medicine. For instance, sickle cell heterozygosity STILL provides a 10% increase in viability in Central Africa, even when malarial medicine has become much more prevalent (link). We may have vitamin supplements, but white skin still helps with vitamin D deficiency in polar regions.

evolution,3bj0em,Coles13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:41:37 2015 UTC,"IMHO As long as some humans are having more children than others, we will still evolve. For right now, humans in the developed world are under a lot of evolutionary pressure to not crash their cars, and also to survive a car crash that does occur, for instance. I also think in 20 or so generations we'll evolve to grow up faster, I think the brain will develop faster, I mean it takes 25 years for the prefrontal cortex (responsible for making decisions and thinking long term, among other things) to develop, which is why teenagers (such as myself, I'm 15) make such bad decisions. One bad decision as a teenager can get you killed. On the other hand though, one bad decision as a teenager can also get you pregnant.  I have this written down on my computer, I'll copy paste. Keep in mind this is all speculation, and also, a lot of this was written down when when I was younger, so excuse any nonsensical things I say.   I think cognitive biases may be selected against, not very much however, they sure don't benefit us.  We will be able to better handle stress. Stress evolved to help us in emergencies, it evolved to help us escape when a lion was trying to eat us. It causes all the bodily functions that are t necessary in a situation like that to shut off, the immune system, digestive system, etc. We aren't built to handle long term stress, and it causes a lot of health problems.  People who can learn to use new technology as it becomes available have benefits. Older generations have no idea how to use iPads and cell phones. They have more difficulty learning how to type, use touch screens as well as other forms of technology. People who can learn as they age will be able to stay in the workforce longer. Although they won't necessarily be more likely to have children.  People who are less sensitive to sweet things will probably eat them less, which means that they would be less likely to become obese and get other health complications related to high levels of fat (natural selection). They would also be skinnier and probably more attractive and have an easier time finding a lover (sexual selection).  We will be better at driving cars, which means we will have better reflexes, and maybe have a wider field of view. We will also probably evolve to be more capable of surviving car accidents, which means better at protecting vital organs from high G-Forces  People who have better language skills would have an easier time in social situations, not to mention public speaking. They would be more likely to get a good job, which means more money, and money is sexy, they would be more likely to get a wife/girlfriend/boyfriend.  People who are more responsible and think in terms of the future will probably get more money, which may or may not benefit them from an evolutionary standpoint.  People who are attracted to people for their wealth will have children who are better fed, and more likely to get a good education, their children will be better off.  We'll become smarter in general, smarter people often make more money and are more successful.  We'll probably become more attractive in general. Women will get larger breast, men will get more muscular, both genders will have less acne and more bilateral symmetry. Both genders will be more conscious to how they look.  We will probably be less likely to let anger get the better of us in a few hundred generation, people who attack people from anger get sent to jail, and are likely to stay in jail for a while, and will be less likely to have children or a family.  Also: one more thing to bear in mind, people in war torn countries and poverty stricken nations face very different selective pressures than those of us in developed nations. In America, being fat is probably being selected against by both natural and sexual selection. Whereas it isn't in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or North Korea, where food is hard to come by."

I read a paper that found a trend that animals that can jump tend to have external testicles and animals that can't tend have internal testicles. Their theory was that jumping and galloping tends to create a lot of pressure in the abdominal cavity. So, because testicles are sensitive for whatever reason, it's better to have them outside if you're going to be jumping around and inside if you're not.

If you look at the penises of most mammals with internal testes, they face backwards at the bodies exit. Most boreoeutharians, conversely, have front facing penises. For obvious reasons, this means less dexterity is required for successful copulation.  A parallel could be seen in insects; basal members mate either back to back out through complicated abdominal rearrangement, while some more advanced orders like flies can mate 'doggy style'.  Once this spandrel was in place, it probably had some minor negative effects on regular testicular function, and that gradually led to their descension as stronger abdominal muscles developed."

evolution,3b4o1v,Syphon8,5,Thu Jun 25 23:11:19 2015 UTC,"There's no 'assuming' I am right. That's what happened; the genus Homo contained dozens of species which had intelligence coming towards that of modern humans, but not quite there. They could use fire, cooked their food, had weapons, and lived all over Eurasia and Africa.  We out-competed them and then they went extinct, either completely wiped out of absorbed into our gene-pool through interbreeding.  As to why this never happened before the genus Homo, it's impossible to say for sure. I could give you a couple hypotheses, but they'd just be speculation.   The escalation hypothesis could have something to do with it; the basic gist of that is that as an ecosystem becomes more mature, organisms need to invest an increasingly large amount of resources on thwarting each other rather than novel evolutionary adaptations which may open up new ecological niches. The outcome of that would be that organisms are locked into roughly the same niches until some extenuating circumstance 'resets' the environment and allows the organisms which survive to move into new niches, where they quickly become locked again.  In the context of human evolution, you could say that our ancestors were stuck at some pre-human maximum level of cognition because bigger brains are very, very expensive, and competition with other apes held them there. A natural disaster or climate change wiped most of the competition out, and allowed a brief window where increased intelligence could be a huge advantage despite its economic drawback. After stability was restored, they'd carved out a new niche, and were again stuck there until another natural disaster or climate change enable them to cross the final threshold to behavioural modernity. This does roughly follow geological evidence, but again, is very speculative.  So, yeah, you're not going to get a real answer as to 'why' that isn't as speculative or more than that."

Sure, there are dolphins that understand human sign language and there are crows that can solve puzzles that a human 4-year old might find challenging, but in the grand scheme of things, other adaptations seem to have arisen far more times. In other words, being smart might not be the big advantage we have.  We do have several adaptations that are fairly unique, in addition to our intelligence. One of them is our ability to run long distance. Lions and gazelles can run short distances but they get tired and overheat - lions need to have a siesta during the hottest parts of the day. Humans, however, while they can't out-run these animals, they can out-last them. Our advantage is the ability to sweat, and regulate our temperature.  Another adaptation we have is the ability to make tools. Now, you don't need to be very smart to make tools, but you do need hands like ours. Millions of years of grasping tree branches and fruit and the nits that get in our family member's hair gave our ancestors hands that were more able to pick up rocks and bang them together to make sharp edges.  These adaptations required a specific sequence of events: we started out as tree-dwellers but climactic changes a few million years ago forced us to abandon trees and instead live on open savannah. It's thought that that change contributed to some of the changes needed for us to be... us. Why it didn't happen before has to do with things being just right. Remember, up until 65 million years ago, our ancestors were little shrew-like creatures that burrowed to avoid being eaten by the dinosaurs. Following the demise of the dinosaurs, it tool a long while for the shrews to evolve into the monkey-like ancestors (with their dexterous hands).   There are some documentaries in our recommended videos section of the wiki that go into some detail about human evolution. You might get a different perspective about how chance events can have huge impacts on how and when changes happen. For example, remember that asteroid that killed the dinosaurs? Imagine if it were 6 hours late that day: it would have missed the planet completely and the dinosaurs (or their descendants) could still be roaming the Earth."

Evolution, for many people (depending on their background, level of education, and especially, certain religious upbringings) can be difficult to understand. There are a lot of basic misconceptions that people retain, even after learning about evolution.  One of those misconceptions is that consciousness is involved in some way. It most emphatically is not. There is no ""striving"" towards something as you stated in one of your comments. I know you've already stated your disagreement and given an example of a predator using intelligence to stalk prey but that's not causing evolution. That's a result of it.  I asked what books (if any) you've read because I know from experience that people who harbour deep misconceptions about evolution probably have not read a well-written, factual book on evolution. Said differently: reading a good book on the topic is a sure-fire way to get rid of those misconceptions.  You're here asking questions. That's great! Take one step further and take people's advice: if you're genuinely interested in the topic, reading a book like Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne or The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins (both with PhDs, as you've repeatedly asked for) is an easy way to correct misconceptions."
evolution,3b4o1v,jballanc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have a PhD in evolution, but I plan to aim for one when I get into college. First and foremost, intelligence has costs. Right now, unless you're running a marathon, or doing a bunch of push ups or something, 20% of you energy is going to your brain. That's a lot of energy. Evolutionarily speaking, the only way we were ever able to get that much energy was by hunting, which has its own costs. Actually, with the exception of elephants, all intelligent(ish) animals are either omnivores or carnivores. Most of those are predators, but some (crows, for instance), are scavengers. That's the thing here. Herbivores (except elephants for some reason) don't need to be smart, all they need to worry about is eating grass, or leaves or something. They are always prey. This means all they really need to worry about is what is and isn't a threat, and running away when they see one. Predators on the other hand need to worry about a lot of stuff, stealth, camouflage, and often, teamwork. That last thing brings up another point. Of all the intelligent animals, every single one is a social animal. Elephants are, humans are, dolphins are, crows are. This brings a lot of demands on intelligence. It requires that they can read other creatures intentions, it requires that they have theory of mind, it requires that they remember their relationships to other individuals, and the relationships between other individuals can be very helpful too.   The reason we needed intelligence was due to an unstable climate in africa at the time we were evolving. The climate (not to be confused with weather) was incredibly unstable. If it was hot and dry right now, you could bet that in 2000 years you wouldn't have a hot dry climate. So we evolved to be smart enough to adapt to new conditions. This is another trait we see in intelligent animals, the ability to solve problems. Dolphins really display this, humans really display this. It is a trait we associate with intelligence.  Like pappypapaya said, evolution has no end goal. This is absolutely probably one of the best answers to your question. I just want to give some more context to this question.  Lastly, as JerseyBorn88 vaguely pointed out, intelligence varies. As one guy said ""it isn't a question of how smart are they (dolphins, he was talking about dolphins), its how are they smart"" (sorry I can't give credit to the person who said this, the quote comes from an episode of National Geographic, my only copy is on my iPad downstairs, and my parents won't be exactly happy if I go down and get it half an hour past midnight. I'll find it in the morning and give him proper credit then. The reason I bring this up is that we often measure an animals intelligence based on how similar they are to us. If they can do things that we can, like use tools or language, then we consider them to be smart. This is obviously not the best way to measure intelligence. There are animals that are intelligent in ways we are not. Just because an animal doesn't build cities of glass and steel and hasn't landed on the moon doesn't mean it is any less smart than we are.

Your last paragraph, especially, has become increasingly relevant as the more we study animal behavior the more we find that many animals are ""intelligent"", just not in the same way as humans. Or, as Douglas Adams put it (rather humorously):   For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much — the wheel, New York, wars and so on — whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man — for precisely the same reasons."

Fenotype might not play any role in the process of evolution. It can be misleading though because, for instance, in humans, people seem to be getting smarter as we progress in scientific and other pursuals. I thought that because we are using our intelligence in ever more complex ways, via that we are passing on our fenotype on next generations. I compared intelligence to developing flaps after using hands in water. But now I realise that these flaps and intelligence, aswell, are a result of genetic mutations which happen in each species. And that mutation is seen by others as a more usable tool in survival and thus is propagated through sexual and natural selection. Correct me if I am wrong, this is just my point of view.

The key word here is seem. Sure, we have space ships and medicine and the Internet, but in terms of raw intelligence, I don't think there's any credible evidence to suggest that someone today is any smarter than someone who lived, say, 100,000 years ago. If you had a time machine and went back and obtained some humans from that time and brought them forward in time and raised them as adopted children today with modern nutrition and modern education, you would probably not be able to tell they were born 100,000 years ago.  The reason we know this is that modern humans left Africa around 70,000 years ago - modern Europeans, Asians, and Native Americans show virtually no differences in intelligence. We were smart already when some of us migrated out of Africa.  What has a much greater impact on intelligence is nutrition (especially at a young age) and education and human contact. There are plenty of examples of children who are held captive in crazy people's basements for years and have significant developmental problems after being released. There are also plenty of examples of children who receive poor nutrition and suffer stunted physical growth and mental capacity. In short: a child's development plays a significant role in mental capacity. In the last few hundred years, both education and nutrition have improved drastically. The industrial revolution did wonders for creating consistent food supplies and promoting education.  Also, the average life expectancy has doubled in the last 150 years or so.   But now I realise that these flaps and intelligence, aswell, are a result of genetic mutations which happen in each species.

evolution,3b0dgv,pridefulofbeing,11,Wed Jun 24 23:21:46 2015 UTC,"Not that I didn't enjoy reading this article, but....  Dobbs states that proponents of the ""new"", non-gene-centric view want to:     cast genes not as the instigators of change, but as agents that institutionalise change rising from more dispersed and fluid forces.   It's been a few years since the last time I read Dawkin's The Selfish Gene, but taking a quick look at Wikipedia:   according to genocentrism, organisms evolve as elaborate contraptions constructed and controlled by genes, and evolution selects among these competing phenotypes or ""interactors"", not by altering the activity or form of the underlying genes (""replicators""), but simply by proliferating those mutated instructions that engender construction of the most successful survival machines.   So based on phenotypes interacting with the environment, varied selection pressures exist. Seems to me that that's essentially the same as viewing genes as ""agents that institutionalise change rising from more dispersed and fluid forces"".   Dobbs goes on to state that the gene-centric view ""granted the gene something like agency"", but that seems like more of a laymen's view to me. Nonetheless, if that's how he and others claim to have interpreted it, I suppose I have to believe it. But I never saw it like that, although maybe that's because I studied for my advanced degree in evolutionary sciences only 15 years ago. I assume Dobbs' advanced degree is from longer ago.   Dobbs continues to summarize this ""new"" view:   The gene, in short, just happens to be the biggest, most obvious part of the trait-making inheritance and evolutionary machine. But not the driver.    Again, this doesn't seem to conflict with Dawkin's gene-centric view in the way I've always interpreted it.   Dobbs developed the article to make it seem like there was some big drama about it, when he admits near the end that Dawkins himself told him (somewhat recently) that he basically agrees and doesn't see any conflict. Dawkins even went on to publish The Extended Phenotype (1982) only 6 years after writing The Selfish Gene, where he states that the only thing genes really do is synthesize proteins. To quote The Extended Phenotype:    Replicators are not, of course, selected directly, but by proxy; they are judged by their phenotypic effects.   Dobbs also mentions the age-old misunderstanding regarding having a gene for X meaning I have/definitely will get X, and that that's is not the way it works, but obviously that's more for the laymen (I assume).    One more (minor) quibble is that Dobbs refers to genes as a ""blueprint"", when we all know (surely him too), that the proper analogy is to a recipe."

If these errors occur in essential (required for life) genes, the gametes, resulting fetus, or daughter cell will die or fail to reproduce. This decreases the likelyhood that you will see genetic differences in essential genes.  However, if mutations occur in genes that are not essential for life, and if these mutations do not result in the decrease of the organism's fitness, these mutations will tend to persist more in the population. Over time, more and more mutations occur in these genes, rendering the gene more and more nonfunctional.  Of course things gets foggy the smaller the population is, but the general principles persist for a majority of ""unimportant"" genes."

If a working gene does not contribute to the fitness of an organism (i.e. mutation in vitamin C gene in an organism that gets lots of dietary vitC), then a mutation inactivating it would not decrease fitness and these mutations would persist in the population. It's not that these mutants are better than wild type organisms, they just arent any worse. Fast forward a very long time and enough mutations have accumulated in this gene that it no longer works within a large population."

So-called 'neutral' genes are an important concept in evolution. Check out a little primer on the subject here. It's one way to explain why seemingly non-adaptive variation is present."
evolution,3arok2,gordonj,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:04:18 2015 UTC,"Does the loss of that tiny bit of energy requirement really confer a significant enough survival advantage to those lacking the gene?    In this case, probably not. Environment is vitally important, because it is what applies the selection on any small differences conferred by the mutation or loss of a gene, organ etc. If, as in the vitamin C example, the environment provides an equally good solution for its acquisision (plentiful vitamin C rich food) then there is no selective pressure to maintain the ability to produce it. If a trait is important for survival in a given environment, then evolution will hone the protein involved to be efficient, and will remove detrimental mutations. If the environment changes and the trait becomes unimportant, then detrimental mutations are not selected out, and their build up eventually destroys the gene.  In the case of vitamin C production, the energy payoff for disabling the gene is extremely small in terms of the ""energy economy"" of the whole organism, so it's doubtful that its loss is selectively advantageous enough to drive the loss of the gene, rather than it just being lost by a neutral process. One example I know of where adaptive hypotheses have been put forward to explain the loss of a trait is in cave-dwelling fishes where there are many examples of different populations that have all undergone convergent evolution to lose their eyesight and pigment. I'm not sure whether anybody has demonstrated that the apparent selection is due to energy costs specifically, or whether it is as a byproduct of selection for other traits."

The GLO gene seems to be neutral, so loss of function mutations aren't deleterious like they would be for most genes. As long as the animal gets enough vitamin c from its diet it doesn't actually need the GLO gene.      A more complex trait like an organ is a significant investment but it can also become diseased. We have an appendix which is a vestigial part of our digestive tract and if it becomes infected it must be removed or the individual will likely die. So if an organ is not being used selection will tend to eliminate it."
evolution,3arok2,its_the_perfect_name,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:31:46 2015 UTC,"It depends on what the exact gene is and whether or not it's unneeded and simply dormant or unneeded and causes an organism to expend unnecessary energy thus impacting its fitness.   There are multiple ways an unnecessary gene can be lost. It can be altered through mutation - because it is not necessary the mutations will readily accumulate as long as they are not detrimental. This won't get rid of a gene entirely but it can alter it so significantly that it becomes something completely different.  It can be actively selected against if it causes an organism to expend unnecessary energy. If other members of the same species lack that gene then they may have a fitness advantage over the members with the gene - they'll be able to reproduce more frequently and the prevalence of the unnecessary gene will decrease in the population as a result. This would very likely apply in the case of an unnecessary organ.  Unless an unnecessary gene is in linkage disequilibrium with a gene that is very important, it can be lost through genetic drift. Especially in cases like the one above where a gene is being selected against - once a gene has reached the point where it's only present in a very small portion of the population the probability of it being lost through drift is very high.   Essentially there is no single way that an unnecessary gene is lost. The answer depends on chromosomal location, proximity to other important genes, whether the gene impacts the organism's fitness, the organism's mutation rate, and the environmental factors at play.  Though keep in mind that oftentimes unnecessary genes aren't lost at all and they simply sit dormant as leftover DNA. As far as we know there's currently a huge amount of ""junk"" DNA in our own genome that has no discernible function. A significant portion of this is undoubtedly genes that were rendered useless by some other development and are now simply sitting dormant and accruing mutations."

You yourself acknowledge that life has no purpose, but any question that begins with ""why"" is a question of purpose, pretty much by definition. So long story short, you've answered your own question without realizing it.  Life tries to survive because that's what its biology tells it to do. That we — humans — have evolved the ability to contemplate our own thoughts and behaviors doesn't change the way that life works at a fundamental biological level.   A bacterium doesn't want to survive, it just does. It's just a self-replicating chemical reaction inside a membrane.   So, fundamentally, is every other form of life on the planet (and some forms of non-life). Even human meta-cognition is ultimately just a knock-on effect of the same chemical self-replication processes that manifest in bacteria, operating iteratively over billions of years.   Of course, the ones that don't want to survive die, and their species along with it.   Extinction isn't simply a case of a species losing the will to live. There are lots of different ways for a species to go extinct. Population-wide clinical depression isn't one of them.   They may ""want"" to continue to exist, but how did the desire to live evolve?   ""Desire"" is a very human concept. Be wary of attempting to apply it to other species.   Life is hard and filled with struggles, death is easier.   The idea that life is hard and filled with struggles so maybe we should all just kill ourselves and get it over with is even more distinctly human than the basic concept of desire. It's also reflective of a pretty distinctly Indo-European approach to the vicissitudes of life, filtered through the lens of early 19th century Romanticism.  TL;DR: The basic problem you're having here is that you're anthropomorphizing all of life on Earth and then attempting to ask of it a philosophical question whose answer may be emotionally meaningful to (some) humans but has no biological significance whatsoever."

The Mutant however sees the red blood and runs away. The 9 then get eaten by the predator that killed the other fish. However now the Mutant fish will have children that will also avoid the corpses of fish.  So what does this story mean? Well we didn't just evolve a fear of death. Throughout our evolution from fish to man individuals that feared things that would kill them survived better then individuals that put their head in a crocodile's mouth. We have evolved to fear things on a case by case basis.   So let's say that you have a fear of bugs. Well that isn't normally very helpful, but let's say an invasive species of spider comes into your community that looks like any other spider, but is extremely poisonous.

It's not that a microorganism ""wants"" to survive, it's just that is has the correct genes to allow it to. And therefore it does what characterizes life from non-life; it reproduces. I keep getting caught up with analogies and terminology that makes it seem as if survival is the ""goal"" of evolution (teleological), when really survival is the ""result"" of evolution. Boom. I think I just got it, finally! There's nothing inherently special about survival other than that it is the means in which genes are passed. It's completely blind. Genes don't ""want"" to survive, they just ""do"", and they do so by mutations.  And with this comes great variety in life, even consciousness as we describe it. Consciousness that allows an organism to survive and propagate its genes. In a way, consciousness is the enslavement of an organism.  Am I on the right track?  Edit: Furthermore, only a cognitive thing can realize it is alive. Therefore, a conscious entity would need to have a sense of ""self"" and wanting to survive in order to survive. The ""goal"" of survival only appears when there is an individual creating this goal, otherwise it is only the ""result""."

These behaviors are often triggered by outside states of the world and objects and will often involve behaviors that attract or repulse. For many species with less sophisticated central nervous systems I'm not sure it's accurate to use terminology like ""want"". ""Want"" seems to imply a certain degree of agency that implies a cognitive flexibility that is the result of complexity.  A specific ""desire to live"" probably is a very late development. Previously you just had a collection of ""desires"" and ""wants"" that developed because they aided in living and reproducing. I don't think a tiger asks whether he wants to live or not... he just asks whether he wants to kill that gazelle or not, etc... The tigers that are around today are the descendents of those that had a healthy motivation to do so. Our folk terminology may interpret this as the tiger having a ""desire"" to live.   At some point certain species developed enough cognitive flexibility to actually consider killing oneself an actual option. So, I think the better framing of the question might be what can evolutionary psychology tell us about suicide? And what animals engage in something like suicide? In short... I think it's suicide that requires an explanation. The repertoire of behaviors designed to promote life and reproduction are not surprising, and it's that repertoire that embodies the notion of ""wanting"" to live."

Some of those start moving until they're no longer in an unpleasant environment, while others sit around and die.

That tendency to avoid unpleasantness eventually evolves into pain, and a general aversion to things unpleasant or dangerous.

If the environment is producing a deleterious effect on the organism (say a bacterium), and that bacterium has the ability to move, then by chance some will be more likely to move than others.  Since the selective pressure is strong in this situation (literally a matter of life and death), those that randomly had a proclivity to move when encountering a deleterious environment (aka bad stuff) would be much more likely to pass on their bad stuff-avoiding genes.  Such genes causing said proclivity would then reach fixation over time, as the bad stuff avoiders outcompeted the other bacteria.  I think what you're missing is the unimaginable amount of time that this scenario had to play out.  Over such deep time, countless cycles of trial and error went by, so that by the Cambrian the survival instinct was already firmly established.

There are entire scientific fields dedicated to studying evolution, with PhD scientists writing papers and continually doing research to refine our understanding of the subject (and refute incorrect hypotheses) and you think your paper, from what I imagine is a total layman's perspective based on your apparent lack of understanding of the current state of the field, is worth ANYTHING?

Congratulations, you're a crackpot. You're welcome to try to prove that you're not, but I have very very very little faith that you're not.  Darwin was most certainly interested in evolution, it's the entire premise of his work. Not that you have read any of it I am sure. Saying he wasn't interested in evolution because it doesn't answer the origin question is like saying that chemists aren't interested in chemistry because they don't understand exactly how matter came into being.   The origin question is one that biologists spend a considerable amount of time trying to understand - maybe you should actually read about it before inventing your own laughably facile answers. Nothing you have to say is original or insightful.   Also, you seem to lack a fundamental grasp on how science is conducted in all disciplines. Nobody is presenting anything as fact without SUBSTANTIAL evidentiary support. You cant just propose an idea and call it ""truth."" That's not how science works at all. Science is an iterative and collaborative process whereby hypotheses are tested by many people over long periods of time, and only after overwhelming supporting evidence has been amassed do we consider something to be a truth. Even then, no scientific fact is unfalsifiable, but you MUST have overwhelming support in favor of an opposing idea, or overwhelming evidence against the current idea. Some questions are not possible to answer with 100% certainty due to their very nature (ie understanding exactly why past events occurred) but we can still make reasonable guesses based on evidence. It's astronomically unlikely that you have any contribution to make that's supported sufficiently enough to challenge any existing ideas about ANYTHING in any scientific discipline.  Much smarter people than you have dedicated their lives to advancing humankind's knowledge about these subjects, and rest assured that these people have already asked all the questions you have. Many of these questions have been answered with varying degrees of certainty. Biologists are well aware that evolution does not explain the genesis of life, it isn't supposed to. Here's a good place to start so you might begin to develop a muddled view of the current state of the scientific field on the subject.  Link: http://m.rsob.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/3/120190.full  An excellent quote from that article:    While Darwin’s revolutionary theory changed our under-standing of how biological systems relate to one another through the simple concept of natural selection, the  Darwinian view has undergone considerable refinement and elaboration since its proposal over 150 years ago. First the  genomic revolution, which provided Darwin’s ideas with a molecular basis through the first decades of the twentieth century, transformed the subject and led to the neo-Darwinian synthesis, an amalgamation of classic Darwinism with population genetics and then with molecular genetics. But in more recent years, there is a growing realization that a molecular approach to understanding evolutionary dynamics is insufficient, that evolutionary biology’s more fundamental challenge is to address the unresolved problem of complexity. How did biological complexity come about, and how can  that complexity and its dynamic nature be understood? Our  point is that Darwin’s monumental thesis, with natural selection at its core, was just the beginning of a long process of  refinement and elaboration, which has continued unabated  to the present day.   Quit trying to play scientist and go to school if you actually want to contribute anything to the field. Otherwise all of your contributions are utterly meaningless, and, not only are they meaningless, baseless assertions with zero evidentiary support, they make people LAUGH at you.   Seriously, you are so ignorant that your misguided pursuit is funny in the way that the idea of a chimpanzee trying to do calculus is funny. You're like a little kid who built a Lego tower and now thinks he's a real architect. Get an education if you want to contribute, otherwise just shut up and learn because you're wasting your time."

I suggest you read my previous comment in its entirety.  What you so clearly don't understand is that evolutionary theory DOES provide a means by which we can understand how single celled organisms evolved into multicellular complexity. It also provides a framework for understanding how species differentiate from one another. Genetic sequencing and fossil evidence are part of the piles of concrete evidence supporting these hypotheses. Read about the different types of speciation that can occur.   Evolution addresses the question of how different species have originated - you're confusing ""origin of species"" with ""origin of life."" Evolution does not address how life itself originated but it DOES explain why we observe such species diversity. Spend some time thinking about the distinction, re-read this several times until you understand what I am saying. Evolution explains how all of life on earth could have arisen from a single common ancestor.   Regarding species differentiation - this link provides a walk-through explanation that might be appropriate for you, probably too complex though: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_40  Read the ENTIRE condensed Evolution 101 course they have there by clicking the ""next"" button on the bottom right.

What I DID say, although I don't even think you read my comment, is that your ideas are utter shit and have no merit or value. Every single idea that is commonplace in the biological community is supported by mountains of evidence and yet you're here talking about how evolution can't possibly change two lineages significantly enough that the resulting animals will be classified into different genera. That's a ludicrously idiotic statement that is totally contrary to all of evolutionary theory and all of the evidence we have. Again this shows that you don't have even the first idea about what you're talking about.  I am just trying to set you straight here because you don't understand even very basic biology or evolutionary theory. I'm trying to get you to a level of understanding where you won't sound mind bogglingly stupid, but the first step is for you to admit that you have no clue what you're talking about and to quit pretending you have answers- it doesn't appear that you're very good at doing that.

evolution,39zdrl,its_the_perfect_name,0,Sat Jun 20 15:32:33 2015 UTC,"you're VERY stupid, or if you're mentally ill   Again you start off with bullying.  Can't you say anything without throwing insults around, it only damages your position.  I find it hard to take you seriously.   Huxley had an excuse as evolution at the time was the most plausible explanation at the time.  You do not.   You seem to be entrenched in the idea of species.  Even Darwin chose not to define species. “No one definition (of species) has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species.”  From your link ""That definition of a species might seem cut and dried, but it is not "".    Species and genus have been applied very inconsistently.  If you took your link.  ""A species is often defined as a group of individuals that actually or potentially interbreed in nature.""  So homo sapiens bred with Neanderthal and there is genetic proof of that. It wasn't just a potential, it was something that happened.   The Linnaean taxonomy structure is poor.  So poor in fact that there are groups trying to replace it with something more logical.  I'll give you a definition, my definition.  After all Darwin did say that no one definition of species satisfies all naturalists.  A genus is a group of animals that can exchange genetic information through reproduction.  A species is a group of animals within a genus that by geography or other physical barriers have developed physical characteristics that have adapted them to their environment. This is probably good enough for our discussion.    So there's my definition.  Lets hear yours.  Please don't use some a link unless it is definitive.  If you look at the Wikipedia you'll see ""However, the exact definition of the term ""species"" is still controversial, particularly in prokaryotes,[14] and this is called the species problem.""  I've watched Wikipedia change it's definition on species over time.  So you really need to put up or shut up.  Give me a definition of species and genus or go away as I'm not about to try to nail jelly to a tree."
evolution,39zdrl,Just2bad,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"I am not entrenched in any idea of species, you are - you've continually cited the species issue as though it's a huge stumbling block. In reality, classification schemes have zero bearing on evolutionary theory. None at all. They affect our understanding of the exact progression of specific lineages and of individual species, but how we choose define a species clearly does not affect whether or not these animals evolve.  The definition of a species IS inexact specifically because sometimes there are no clear cut boundaries between similar creatures. Genetic exchange between two phenotypically or genetically distinct creatures isn't always impossible. Especially in single celled organisms. Life is adaptable and ever-changing, the lines are fuzzy and so our definitions are fuzzy. Still, the biological definition tends to be sufficient for complex organisms - if they can produce fertile offspring then they are considered to be members of the same species. This is an oversimplification, yes, but it's sufficient for classification schemes. You are not wrong about inconsistency here, but it's utterly irrelevant in a discussion about evolution.   Let me repeat that because you are a poor reader: a species is a group of animals that can reproduce and produce fertile offspring and are capable/potentially capable of reproducing in nature.   This definition is founded upon the idea of a shared gene pool - if individual members of the same species reproduce with one another they can be thought of as a large pool of genetic information that's continually being exchanged.   A genus is simply defined as a taxonomic grouping. Nothing more. Animals in the same genus generally are closely related and share very similar characteristics (phenotype, anatomy, behaviors, etc) but there is no requirement that they be able to exchange genetic information. If we applied your definition of a genus then genus would simply become the equivalent of what a species is defined as today.   You say you have watched the definition of species change? This is, again, part of what you are failing to understand. Science is a process. We are continually trying to refine our understanding, and changing definitions is part of this refinement.   Now, let me set you straight here. The Linnaean classification system has undergone massive changes since it was devised in the 1700s. Your criticism is about 300 years out of date and again, very unoriginal. Nobody ascribes to Linnaeus' original scheme. Nobody. The only similarity between the original system and the current system is the standardized binomial nomenclature and the order of the groupings.   Additionally, your definitions of genus and species are simply silly. Find me a species that ISN'T adapted to its original environment and I'll give you all of my money. And again, not all organisms within the same genus can exchange genetic information. That is simply not what genus means or is intended to mean at all. As I said before, that's what a SPECIES is defined as - a group of animals capable of exchanging genetic information and producing fertile offspring.  Understand that just because two species are closely temporally related (ie have a recent common ancestor) and are classified as being within the same genus does not mean they can exchange genetic information and produce viable offspring. You have some major misunderstandings about phylogenetics, cladistics and the purpose of taxonomic classification in general. Our current classification scheme does not necessarily indicate whether organisms are able to reproduce (until you reach the level of a species), merely how closely they are evolutionarily related. Closely related organisms that share similar traits are grouped together while more distantly related organisms are not.  Genetic sequencing has given us the tools to better classify all lifeforms according to their relative genetic distance from one another. Basically we can now see how closely related they are and construct very accurate phylogenies from the genetic data. This has led to major restructuring of many different taxonomies within the last 15 years. You cite genetic information as though it supports your argument when in reality every geneticist I have ever met would laugh you out of the room - you understand so little it's painful. More painful, however, is your utter unwillingness to actually learn.  There used to be a significant amount of subjectivity in how organisms were classified. There still is in many cases, which is why phylogenies are constantly being updated, but genetic data, as I said before, is helping to eliminate this subjectivity by allowing us to determine exactly how closely related any two individual species are to one another. Classifications can now be based upon genetic similarity instead of just phenotypic similarity.   Taxonomic structures are absolutely irrelevant when it comes to the fundamental processes underlying evolution. We don't NEED to have exact definitions for any of these things in order to observe genetic drift, natural selection, divergence and mutation within populations. The fundamental molecular processes that affect DNA and cause macroevolution are directly observable regardless of how we classify organisms.   The classification schemes help us to essentially place animals in their evolutionary order, the schemes themselves obviously don't affect how the creatures actually evolved. Let me repeat this point because it's important: the schemes themselves are just our way of ""organizing"" the creatures we've discovered. They help us understand how these creatures have evolved, but we can observe the underlying methods by which they evolve even without understanding exactly how they've changed.   I'd ask you to please read about cladistics and phylogenetic classification but I truly don't think you're going to actually understand any of it without starting from a basic Bio 101 course and working your way up. You simply have too many misconceptions and wrong ideas.   Anyhow, continue trying to play scientist and create your own little world. Nobody will ever, ever, ever take you seriously because you don't even understand the very basics of what you're talking about. I cannot stress that enough. That is not me insulting you, that's me telling you the truth. You need an education and you need to learn to write properly. More importantly you must realize that you can't just fabricate ideas and pretend they're valid because you imagine they could be. That is not how the world works and that's certainly not how science works. You're either the living embodiment of the Dunning-Kruger effect or you're mentally unhinged.  If there's anyone who was ever less deserving of serious consideration than you are I've never encountered them. This will be my last comment because I'm done wasting my time.  To be honest I can't believe I wasted my time talking to you for this long. I'd somehow convinced myself you'd maybe learn something - maybe I AM the idiot here, arguing with a crazy man. Thanks for eroding my faith in humanity just a bit today. I sincerely hope you shake your delusions. Go take a few basic bio classes at your local CC if you're interested in this stuff, but you know so little that you truly have no place writing papers or devising crackpot theories about any high-level subject.

evolution,39zdrl,its_the_perfect_name,0,Sun Jun 21 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"You seem to like insulting people.  So you don't like my definition.  So are Homo Sapiens the same species as Neanderthal?  If no, they how did they breed together? Have you never noted that there are so many different ""kinds"" of animals that are obviously related, but differ from one another by one pair of chromosomes?  The mammoth and the elephant.  Humans and chimps.  Horses and donkey's.  All differ by one pair of chromosomes. If you apply Haldane's Rule, they are unable to interbreed.  Granted the horse and donkey produce a mule or hinney but both are sterile. So just how can evolution account for this.  It can't.  In the case of humans, our number two chromosome is two of the chimpanzee line joined.   It can't happen is steps. It's joined or it's not joined.   So the first ""homo"" would by Haeldane's rule, not be able to interbreed with the chimps around it.  So then you have to get to there being at least two ""homo"" of opposite sex having the exact same two chromosomes joined in the exact same way.   This is not evolution.  This is a single step that produces a new ""species/genus"".   Or are humans and chimps the same species.  No. Are they the same genus. No.   It gets back to your definition.  Evolution provides no solution to this.  The biblical story does however answer this question.  Since Adam came first and Eve is made from Adam, you would have to say that Eve was his female clone.  She would share the same chromosomes, gene's and MDNA.  Adam and Eve would for all intents and purposes be the same as a set of male/female mono-zygotic twins.  It is also interesting to note that only a male zygote can produce male/female mono-zygotic twins, so the idea of Adam coming first exactly parallels the idea that man origin is a set of twins.  So humans starting from a single pair is not an evolutionary story.  The same applies to elephants and mammoths. More to the point, the MDNA is narrow in humans.  If you start from a single pare, no need for ""near extinction events."".  So all branching caused by either two independent births with the same chromosome anomaly or male/female mono zygotic twins will have a narrow MDNA.   So when the first ""homo"" appeared with on less pair of chromosomes than his parents, was he still a chimpanzee?  According to your classification system he's a chimp.  He has no physical differences.  Same gene's after all. Your classification system will never say this is a branch.  My definition says he can't breed with the chimps around him, so he's a new genus and a new species.    So you may not like my definition, but it is at least consistent with the facts.  Yours seems to be designed to support the idea of evolution as a driving force for the ""origin of species"".   But the Adam and Eve story is the correct and logical story of the origin of man.  After all even the word Adam is not a proper name, it means ""man"".    You evolutionists are so full of yourselves.  Sure evolution exists, animals change,  we adapt to our surroundings, but it does not provide an origin story.   Darwin was looking for an origin story, little did he realize that Adam and Eve was that.  He was after all just putting out the same shit as his grandfather did.    If you consider that Darwin's ideas have been described as ""survival of the fittest"" then it is more likely an explanation as to the decline in the number of species.  Those fit species wiping out the unfit species.    Darwin was wrong, the Torah has the correct story as to the origin of man and since mono-zygotic twins are a mammalian thing, the rise of mammals.    You have been so indoctrinated in your belief in evolution being the be all and end all that you fail to recognize that it is not an origin story.  Evolution is a story of change but not of a beginning.  Just apply Haldane's rule and your humped.  So disprove that rule, show that animals with different chromosome counts can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.  If you can't, then give an evolutionary answer as to the change in the number of chromosomes.    The reality is that whenever there is a change in the number of chromosomes, a new species/genus is created, using my definition, and using your definition, there is no new species or genus.   I rest my case with this recent tidbit.  They are now saying mammoths went through a near extinction event prior to them actually going extinct.  They are basing this on the MDNA.  But my ideas explain this and evolution can't.  So put that in your pipe and smoke it."

evolution,3a3cwi,hsfrey,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:19:27 2015 UTC,"The article is behind a pay wall. Here's the abstract:  Aneuploidy in human eggs is the leading cause of pregnancy loss and several genetic disorders such as Down syndrome. Most aneuploidy results from chromosome segregation errors during the meiotic divisions of an oocyte, the egg’s progenitor cell. The basis for particularly error-prone chromosome segregation in human oocytes is not known. We analyzed meiosis in more than 100 live human oocytes and identified an error-prone chromosome-mediated spindle assembly mechanism as a major contributor to chromosome segregation defects. Human oocytes assembled a meiotic spindle independently of either centrosomes or other microtubule organizing centers. Instead, spindle assembly was mediated by chromosomes and the small guanosine triphosphatase Ran in a process requiring ~16 hours. This unusually long spindle assembly period was marked by intrinsic spindle instability and abnormal kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which favor chromosome segregation errors and provide a possible explanation for high rates of aneuploidy in human eggs.     This error-prone chromosome segregation method doesn't occur in spermatocytes, and doesn't occur in mouse oocytes, and doesn't occur in mitosis.   Chromosome segregation takes about 30 minutes in mitosis, but up to 24 hours in human oocyte meiosis.  How could a process which makes a large proportion of eggs infertile have been selected for by natural selection, especially in an organism that only ovulates once a month?  By definition, it would seem to guarantee fewer offspring.  Could it be that too frequent births could decrease survival rates of prior children? The suppression of ovulation by lactation would seem to have a similar ""purpose""."

evolution,3a3cwi,Just2bad,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:17:39 2015 UTC,It's just that the very definition of evolution of a gene is increased frequency in the next generation.  How does that work with a gene that by its very nature Decreases its frequency in the next generation?   It must be conferring some tremendous reproductive advantage to those that DO survive to offset that obvious disadvantage.  That's why I mentioned the comparison with the trait that renders a mother infertile while she's lactating with her previous child.

Having two copies of a gene isn't usually harmful, and this allows one of them to be subsequently altered, possibly to do something useful. There are many varieties of gene duplication.   It seems to me that observed ""information adding"" events would go a long way toward shutting these conspiracy theory creationist types down.   These people are not operating on a fact-based world-view. Science educators for decades have thought ""what if we show them this evidence or do this experiment..."" and yet we still have people who do not accept evolution.

Yes, random does NOT add helpful information but random COMBINED with the death of the useless mutations and the survival/birth rate of the useful ones...you get useful information.  Random change PLUS natural filtering through the simple dynamic of things dying or living statistically more means useful information is added and not-useful is discarded.

It had to do mostly with a misunderstanding of genetics. I believed that animals had plasticity, but could not change past a certain degree limited by their ""genetic information."" I thought God had created a hundred or so animal ""kinds"" (e.g cats, snakes, birds) and that when they were created they had a great deal of plasticity. As they microevolved they became more specified, but at the loss of genetic information. I did not believe that evolution could occur in such a way that one kind could become another. This changing from a lizard kind to a bird kind was what I considered ""macroevolution."" If someone understands that animals are not limited by their genetics and that ""kinds"" do not exist, they they should have no problem with evolution. I'd say that most ""serious"" creationists believe like I did. So, if someone has a proper understanding of the topic, than no, there is no reason to make any distinction between any type of evolution. Creationists can comfortably differentiate between the two because they don't understand that there isn't a difference."

Someone who fully understand evolution, however, realizes that it is possible for the original color to be orange. And that over time, some of these orange creatures became yellow while others became red. And that this process of changing from orange to yellow is the exact same process of changing from orange to light orange to pale orange to Goldenrod yellow, and then to yellow.

A new food source, including the gut flora to deal with that. Macro-evolution isn't about changing in giant leaps. It's about changing giant things. Eusociality is a GIANT thing. Big enough that until recently, we didn't even know who they were related to. It's a giant, novel change. That's the important thing. That's what macro-evolution is. BIG changes. Not rapid changes. And you can, correctly, say that macro-evolution is usually the result of a lot of micro-evolutionary changes. But it is simply factually inaccurate to say they are the same thing. Micro-evolution sometimes results in macro-evolution. But macro-evolution does not typically result in micro-evolution. They describe different processes.

Please note that those who reject 'macro' evolution are basing their worldview on a timescale at least an order of magnitude smaller, as a whole, much less for a single species' developmental change.

I know there's some people out there that would say, ""nope, nothing has evolved ever. God just created everything,"" and there's also people who think that God simply created the LUA. Really I'd say a creationist's beliefs depend on how much real science they accept and how well they can finaggle it into their preconceptions.  It's kind of amusing, but I don't think everyone realizes how much creationists have to consider Noah's ark. The reason I believed in ""microevolution"" between kinds was I recognized that the number of animals alive today simply would not fit on the ark. The explaination, then, was that the animals that were on the ark were close to being ""genetically pure"" and thus very plastic and able to evolve quite a bit within their own kind. So yeah, kind of like having a common ancestor for each major animal type, only with a bunch of junk genetics thrown in. Remember, I didn't think animals could evolve outside of their ""kind,"" but I wasn't quite sure what I ""kind"" was. If you had asked me then, I probably would have said there was a giant flightless bird kind, a songbird kind, a penguin kind, etc. Remember I thought things ""evolved down"" and got less plastic as they became more specialized, so there would have been a big cat kind and the house cat would have been a descendent of that. House cats then lost the ability to grow to that size again. Anyway, yeah, Noah's ark would have had to fit all the common ancestors of today's animals, so split that up how you see fit, haha. Remember this took place 6,000 years ago too.  I was raised as a creationist, and actually went to the Creation Museum in earnest. I was actually disappointed that I already pretty much knew everything there! But, to entertain myself I tried to create an ""atheist persona"" so I could try to view the museum as an atheist would, and though it didn't do much then that persona stuck around and voila. Anyway, I know that the beliefs above are what Answers in Genesis teaches, so I imagine they're not totally uncommon. I'd say my beliefs were about as close as you could get with fusing modern science with Biblical inerrancy. If a creationist mentions animal ""kinds"" then yeah, they probably believe the same stuff I did. If they don't recognize that term, they're either completely ignorant of natural science or a deistic evolutionist."

If you are starting with a very small population (i.e. Noah's Ark), that diversity can only come from later mutation. The level of mutation needed to provide the observed plasticity is not only impossibly-intense, but would have been ubiquitously fatal (as it would completely overwhelm Natural Selection's ability to weed out harmful mutations)."

The distinction between micro and macro evolution are purely just to try and divide up and explain away things people aren't comfortable with. Evolution is evolution. What is commonly referred to as ""micro-evolution"" is variation within species or within groups of similar animals. ""Macro-evolution"" is the change of organisms that seem dissimilar. But in real life our divisions of organisms are pretty arbitrary. We pick a trait and say, ""this means this organism is a bird,"" or something like that. But organisms really exist in a continuum.  Using our example from before, there were feathered dinosaurs, winged dinosaurs, dinosaurs with hollow bones, etc. Almost any trait has grey areas. Take, for example, production of milk through mammaries and breast feeding. Platypuses actually produce milk and secrete it through their skin all over their body. Platypuses also produce offspring by laying eggs, yet they are mammals.  The point is, we try to categorize everything into ""this"" and ""that"". The change from "" this"" to ""that"" would be what people consider ""macro-evolution"". But the change occurs in varying stages, which would be what people consider micro-evolution.

evolution,39rpw8,impressive,7,Mon Jun 15 19:10:04 2015 UTC,"Believing in microevolution but not macroevolution is like believing in earthquakes but not tectonic plate movement.  ""Sure, the crust moved a few inches, but did Africa and the Americas really move an ocean apart?""  In either case, I prefer not to use the term ""believe"" because it suggests faith in something unknowable. With science, though, any of us can go out there and verify the claims made about evolution or geology.  As others pointed out, it really gets down to whether one accepts that the earth (and the universe) has been around for billions of years. Without that, you have to make all kinds of mental contortions to make the facts fit the circumstances. One simple example: If the universe is 6,000 years old, there hasn't been enough time for light to reach us from the center of our own galaxy, much less other galaxies."

So no it makes no sense. Accepting microevolution means that eventually macroevolution will occur."

evolution,39rpw8,silentj16,2,Sun Jun 14 03:34:25 2015 UTC,"Here's an image that might help you to wrap your head around it.  This is an image of three skulls of three organisms, one that lived some 47 million years ago, a second that lived 36 million years ago, and one that is alive today.  The organism on the left is Artiocetus, and looked something like this. From the image, you can guess that it was probably at home in the water, but was still able to waddle on land a bit, not unlike today's otters or sea lions (or even penguins.) Take particular notice of the nostril - notice how as time progresses, it slowly moves up the forehead until it's more like a modern day blowhole. Indeed, blowholes in whales and dolphins are just modified nostrils. This progression of the nostril up the skull to the back of the head required many, many minor adjustments to the genetic code.  The second image, if you're interested, is an organism that looked something like this. You'd recognise it as being more like a dolphin, but the blowhole is still on the snout, and there are still hind ""legs"" which will eventually disappear (except it sometimes goes wrong.)  Here's another image that shows more skulls.  The entirety of cetation (whale) evolution is really interesting, since you can see the progression over a long time of mammals well-suited to living on land to mammals excellently suited to living in water. If you're approaching this with the creationist ""kinds"" in mind (ie, baraminology) then you can definitely see how one ""kind"" can slowly become another."

Macroevolution deals with processes and patterns of evolution at the level of species and higher. For the most part, the only difference is a matter of scale. The fundamental processes of microevolution (i.e. selection, drift, migration, and mutations/recombination) also affect macroevolution, though macroevolution also deals with many processes that aren't usually within the purview of microevolution, including polyploidy, gene duplication, retroviruses, mechanisms of reproductive isolation, species-species interactions, niche construction, ontogeny, allopatry, hybridization, etc., though there is a lot of overlap."

An example family is Felidae, the biological family of (all) cats (or cat like) animals. No one can deny this because it happens in time frames that we can observe. Things like cat and dog breeding to make new lines falls under this.  Macro evolution is change over much longer periods. From an Amphibian family to a Serpentes family (snakes) or Rodent family for example.   The thing is that creationism often argues that it is impossible to go from one family to another. And as example they will maybe use: You can't go from Snakes to Rodents. And they would be right in that you can't go from Snakes to rodents. But they would be wrong in thinking that that is what evolution says.  You can't arbitrarily jump from one branch of the tree to another. You can only ""jump"" from one branch lower.  So we have: 1. Amphibian to Serpentes 2. Amphibian to Rodent  What did not happen is: 1. Serpentes to Rodent 2. Rodent to Serpentes 3. Serpentes to Amphibian 4. Rodent to Amphibian      Just like on the road there are only specific routes you can drive on the tree of life. And not for example against the traffic.  The next step would be: 1.

evolution,39mtra,Alternating_Sum,5,Fri Jun 12 23:49:56 2015 UTC,"I guess both. The Wikipedia article you linked to states that ""[t]he emergence of nervous systems has been linked to the evolution of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels. The Nav channels allow for communication between cells over long distances through the propagation of action potentials, whereas voltage-gated (Cav) calcium channels allow for unmodulated intercellular signaling. It has been hypothesized that Nav channels differentiated from Cav channels either at the emergence of nervous systems or before the emergence of multicellular organisms, although the origin of Nav channels in history remains unknown.""  However, that doesn't explain how ""regular cells"" suddenly began to signaling each other through synapses and action potentials. Non-neurological tissue can't do that, even though all cells depolarizes themselves. You must have a way to transport the signal from one cell to an other."

Our nearest living single-celled relatives are probably choanoflagellates.  It seems like they have some pretty sophisticated machinery for communicating with each other, and like at least some of this machinery resembles synapses.    A fun part of the story for me is that both sponges and choanoflagellates kind of bridge the gap between unicellular and multicellular life, so it makes sense that they would benefit from cell-to-cell communication.    Choanoflagellates can live independently, but they also benefit from swimming together in clusters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNLt0VIUpus And they sometimes form colonies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI4AuDyon8M I think their ""collars"" form a more effective net for catching food when they work together like this.

It's a digital version of a book that gathers researchers from every aspect of the evolution of the brain and behavior. Looks like the first three chapters are what you're looking for. In the preface to Part I, on the first page:       In Chapter 1, Cecilia Conaco and colleagues review earlier findings that many of the molecules found in neuronal synapses, especially within the postsynaptic density, predate the evolution of neurons. The authors then use an analysis of gene coexpression patterns to show that these protosynaptic genes in sponges, which lack proper neurons, form several modules of interacting genes. With the evolution of neurons, these small modules fused into a larger module with a novel function, namely to build synapses.       Hope that helps!"

Ref        In the earliest branching animal phyla (Porifera), in which a nearly complete set of synaptic genes exists in the absence of morphological synapses, these “protosynaptic” genes displayed a lack of global coregulation although small modules of coexpressed genes are readily detectable by using network analysis techniques. These findings suggest that functional synapses evolved by exapting preexisting cellular machines, likely through some modification of regulatory circuitry   They do seem to have a sensory capacity using non-motile cilia.       But it looks like the early 'protosynapse' is made up of proteins that were used for different functions -- cell signaling, for instance.        They were later exapted and used to form the complex cell signalling that we call synapses.       So:        how did those protosynaptic parts increase the fitness of the organism?      By giving the cells the ability to communicate with one another, including a primitive sensory system.         Did they already have other functions in the cell?

What they meant by 'proto-synapses' is that all of the right signalling genes were in place, but lacked any kind of global regulation. So all of the ingredients for a synapse were there, but the organization wasn't.       That worked because all of the machinery was itself used in various signalling pathways, just without the actual synapse regulating and coordinating everything. Cells all have an ability to communicate with one another, synapses just stream-line the process in your nervous system where it's most important to have quick and efficient communication.       So the complex of signalling genes they're calling 'proto-synapses' still functioned in cell signalling, they just weren't organized."

So by 'lacking organization' I mean that the genes were there, and they were functioning in cell signalling. But they were doing it independently.

The wikipedia article about that group has some good detail about extinct memebers. I'd start with   Gigantopithicus to see where that lineage once went, they are the largest apes to ever have lived. (Edit: TL;DR: It seems the common ancestor of all the apes probably migrated out of Africa some tens of millions of years ago and into Asia. It diversified there, which is why the only extant lesser apes are endemic to Asia, and also why the orang group was so diverse. Some time later a new animal migrated back into Africa and eventually gave rise to the African great apes, including humans. Then humans migrated back out of Africa. So the common ancestor of all of the apes came out of Africa, but the common ancestor of the great apes was Asian.)"

The dating techniques are actually pretty solid, so at least we don't have to worry too much about that. But fitting the relationships together is a lot tougher than just saying ""This looks like that, must be related."" So the classifications of extinct species change sometimes.       Here is a paragraph from the wiki article:       Miacidae as traditionally conceived is not a monophyletic group; it is a paraphyletic array of stem taxa. Traditionally, Miacidae and Viverravidae had been classified in a superfamily, Miacoidea. Today, Carnivora and Miacoidea are grouped together in the crown-clade Carnivoramorpha, and the Miacoidea are regarded as basal carnivoramorphs. Some species of the genus Miacis are closely related to the order Carnivora, but only the species Miacis cognitus is a true carnivoran, as it is classified in the Caniformia.            The first sentence there says that Miacids are not a ""real"" family the way we think of them today. It is a group of things that are all related by a common ancestor, but it doesn't contain all of the things it should, and it contains some things it shouldn't.       The second sentence says myacids and another group used to be put together. (Now the other group is actually thought to be related to carnivorans, but not related to any extant carnivores).      I wont bother with the rest of the paragraph, but you can see that our understanding of the relationships are changing continually to fit all the newest and best evidence into our picture of how life has evolved. But science in general is messy. Our 'facts' have a habit of changing on us. And when they do we update our understanding of things. Fortunately the dating techniques are pretty solid, so we don't have to worry about those, but fitting all of the extinct ancestors together with the extant animals isn't always cut and dry.       but also seems to ask a WHOLE lot of a person to believe that we're right about bones that old.       One thing science doesn't do is ask a person to take anything at face value. Our entire system is based on rigorous testing and proving each other wrong.

It seems like such a stretch, for things that old, but that's essentially what I need to know if I'm going to come to a decision here.        I can give you a good idea of how we put things together, but unfortunately, I cannot tell you that we're right about everything. It's one of the best things about science that we are not dogmatic in our understanding of things. It requires a willingness to abandon what we believe when we get new evidence. That is fundamentally how we can get an understanding of the natural world, not by holding onto to old ideas, but by incorporating new evidence into our existing understanding.       As to how the relationships are hypothesized, it's usually done using morphological characters. So we can look at the bones of the American Lion and we can compare them to the bones of extant cats, and the bones of other extinct cats. It's currently thought that the American Lion is a relative of the European Cave Lion. But in the past it has been grouped with the African lion, and it's even been suggested that it's more closely related to the tiger. It would make the most sense based on extant species that the tiger would be the closest relative, because the tiger is Asiatic, and there is a land bridge that has periodically joined Asia and North America. But that's not enough to satisfy scientists. A careful look at their morphology led researchers to conclude that the American Lion is most closely related to the Cave Lion. And recently, researchers have been able to extract mitochondrial DNA from some fossils. The genetic analysis confirmed what we thought based on the morphological traits. The cave lion is the closest relative.        So even though we aren't perfect in our placement of extinct species, we're pretty good at it. And as far as getting everything to go where they actually belong, it's not so much of a mystery that it should cause you too much doubt. No one has ever proposed that the American Lion is a dog. For the most part we can look at the fossil evidence and say with a fair degree of certainty that a given fossil belongs with a given set of other fossils. The reorganization is mostly nit-picky. ""Does this fish belong with these fish or those fish?"" But not ""Does this fish belong with bony fish or sharks?""       A good example from recent species is termites. They've traditionally been their own group. But with new techniques in genetic analysis, we now know that they are a highly distinct group of roaches. But that doesn't stop them being termites.      What I'm trying to say is that even though we change the placement of things, it's usually a very slight change, like moving one branch of a phylogenetic tree from one node to another. It's not a gross, overall misplacement, just a tiny change. On the whole, our understanding of the phylogenetic placement of most extinct species is pretty good, it just requires adjustment from time to time. It's really not as big a stretch as you may imagine. We can look at a fossil and tell with ease that it's a rodent. And we can tell that it's in the squirrel group and not the mouse group. The indecision will come when two researchers disagree if it should be placed with one group of squirrels or another. So it's not a problem on an overall scale, it's really just slight adjustments.        But again, that's the beautiful thing about science. It requires that we don't hold onto old beliefs when we get new data. To give you an example of why this is so important and so profound, the best way to become a famous scientist who makes a ton of money is to prove the biggest ideas wrong. Science is inductive, meaning that we never prove anything right, we can only prove things wrong. Darwin is famous now because he proved his predecessors wrong and the fastest way to become rich and famous today would be to prove Darwin wrong. But people have been trying for 150 yrs to do that and have failed at every attempt. What we have been able to do is refine Darwin's ideas to get a greater understanding of what's happening in nature. Until the early 1980's we thought evolution could only happen over very long time scales. Then a couple guys named Reznick and Endler came along and proved that wrong with their work on rapid evolution. They made their way into the text-books and have never had to worry about job security since then."

It leads to a larger, more extensive page.   You might also like the page on the evolution of whales. How the inner ear evolved for hearing on land, to hearing in the water is particularly interesting."

evolution,39i815,ourstupidearth,5,Fri Jun 12 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"I'll echo what others have said, but also add one of my oldest  long-time resources on the internet:  Talk Origins Archive.  You can use the search function to find any evolution/biological or creationist term you want along with the scientific response(s).    Most of the answers there are posted by actual biologists, paleontologists, geologists etc., who know what they're talking about.  As an open source collaborative work, they spent years building the site from usenet discussions to come up with the best compilation I've seen."

evolution,39i815,astroNerf,5,Thu Jun 11 23:16:18 2015 UTC,I don't have a pastor and I'm one of the Christians that doesn't agree that evolution and Christianity go together. From my studies of the Bible I learned that God created everything and that he created each according to their own kind. Evolution says that everything started at one point and gradually became what we see today. Two very different views.
evolution,39i815,PolishedCounters,5,Fri Jun 12 04:18:35 2015 UTC,"Getting a bit off-topic here, but in the vein of evolution and Christianity, it might help for you to understand that the Bible has, itself, evolved. It's not, as you may have been told, some concrete text handed down from on high. Archaeologists have recovered various different fragmentary texts that represent earlier ""editions"" of various Bible passages. In addition to your study of evolution, you might consider reading up on the Gospel of Thomas and the Dead Sea Scrolls."
evolution,39i815,wishiwascooler,5,Fri Jun 12 10:42:25 2015 UTC,Also the Council of Nicea where a powerful elite within the Roman Empire decided what was going to be in the Bible... which might explain why obedience to the Church and State are such important themes in the Bible.
evolution,39i815,CN14,2,Fri Jun 12 11:22:37 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the Christians that doesn't agree that evolution and Christianity go together.    I'm a non-Christian who feels the same way. My issue mainly has to do with Adam and Eve, original sin, and Jesus' purpose. If Adam and Eve did not literally exist, and are instead metaphorical, then is original sin a metaphor also? Why did Jesus have to die in order to atone for metaphorical transgressions?  I have yet to hear a straight-forward answer to this discrepancy that doesn't require me to have studied theology for a few years.  While I agree that Christians can accept evolution and there are many excellent biologists who are Christians, I firmly believe that there's some heavy compartmentalisation happening there."
evolution,39i815,indurateape,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:15:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   If Adam and Eve did not literally exist, and are instead metaphorical, then is original sin a metaphor also? Why did Jesus have to die in order to atone for metaphorical transgressions?   I'm glad you pointed that out. I was just talking about that with a friend the other day, and we both were saying the same thing. It's a complete contradiction and messes up the whole purpose of Jesus and everything. I also came to the conclusion that Christians who do believe the Genesis Origin's account to be a metaphor are actually making room for evolution to fit in with Christianity when they do this. Say that the origin account in the Bible is simply a metaphor, which takes out a huge chunk of literal story that was there, which leaves room for something to take it's place; evolution."
evolution,39i815,Coles13,3,Sat Jun 13 02:29:19 2015 UTC,"Say that the origin account in the Bible is simply a metaphor, which takes out a huge chunk of literal story that was there, which leaves room for something to take it's place; evolution.   That's one perspective.  Here's another: Genesis is simply one of our species' early attempts and answering one of the big questions: where did we come from? Absent of any real answers, people made stuff up.   Interestingly, many biblical scholars now recognise that the Genesis creation myth is actually borrowed from the Babylonian creation myth, called the Enûma Eliš  The problem I have with the ""metaphor"" approach is that it implies the authors of Genesis had some knowledge of how things were created, and recorded a version of that account that could be understood by people. Given that both the Babylonian and the Hebrew authors who followed them made use of the ""firmament,"" I'm fairly confident that these people didn't really know how things actually came to be and their guesses look vaguely metaphorical.  If you're interested, Karen Armstrong's A History of God traces the evolution of Yahweh as a literary figure, and includes a narrative that explains how the Bible (including Genesis) changed over time. You can see a summary of that book here."
