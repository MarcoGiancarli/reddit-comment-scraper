lifeofnorman,3c38to,turtlehoof,14,Sat Jul 4 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty good for english as your second language! I find most people appreciate a little proof reading and explanation in this sort of scenario so I hope you don't mind me giving you a couple of pointers as a natural english speaker.   Firstly, just a typo, but you missed the 'h' in thought.   Secondly, your tenses are a little off, but tenses can be tricky. I think for example 'work had been harder...' And 'on his way home he had thought about a warm shower so he could forget...' Would be smoother.   Also perhaps some clarification about the mayo? Like the mayo he had had in his sandwich for lunch that day or something. Otherwise, although we can figure out that the mayo is not normal because he thinks he was unusually unproductive because of the mayo, it is still not totally clear that the mayo is actually out of the ordinary. It would just read a bit smoother."
lifeofnorman,3c38to,miasimia,8,Sat Jul 4 13:02:39 2015 UTC,"Although I find your criticism rather nitpicky, I still appreciate your input. Also, the mayo is not out of the ordinary, that's the whole point.   I'm glad you enjoyed the short, it was her first attempt at a Norman story."
lifeofnorman,3c38to,miasimia,4,Sat Jul 4 13:20:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry that it seemed like nitpicky criticism, my intention was to support your continued improvements in your use of the English language rather than to criticize, although I can see how it would come across that way.  It is a difficult language to learn, and in my experience people tend to appreciate this sort of thing because it helps them learn how to manipulate the language better rather than simple praise which by default encourages the repetition of the same mistakes. But I do understand if you personally would prefer we just focus on the story itself rather than the grammar as this sub is after all about the story, and not an English language class.  With the mayo I just assumed that it was a new thing because of the sudden change on productivity being blamed on it, my bad!"
lifeofnorman,3c38to,MindAlchemist,6,Sat Jul 4 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"As an English teacher, it's not nitpicky actually. Many of the top stories here are ready to be published while your story is difficult to read. I could find a better way to phrase nearly every sentence. ''Norman thought how lucky he really is, because he doesn't have to use as much shampoo nowadays. In fact, him balding is a really good thing.''  This is a classic case of an ESL speaker using frequently used phrases and too many words.  Thanks for the submission but if we weren't ''nitpicky'' of this level of English, the English language would go to hell."

There are some really gifted people on this forum and though I know I'm not the best, I personally enjoy thinking about Norman.   It should be obvious that Norman has the potential to both reflect what we choose to see in the world around us, and to illuminate the rich tapestry of themes that somehow go unsaid in other kinds of stories.   Norman is far more complex than the Dilbertesque black-and-white cutout of a man I first imagined him as, and over time Norman will continue effortlessly down the groove running through the middle of the human race."

To me it's just Norman visiting his son Tucker at college, named tucker because of how much Norman liked tucking him in at night. Tucker really is a kind boy but just doesn't appreciate a father like Norman because of Norman's quirks and classic parent anger yaknow. The other part of the story is just showing Tucker an obviously cooler than Norman kid still taking on his father's empathy with his buddy. I dunno my dad died when I was a kid so I wanted a father son similarity story that also highlighted their differences. I'll probably wake up and delete it tomorrow anyways.

lifeofnorman,3as7b7,Swankified_Tristan,6,Tue Jun 23 19:03:55 2015 UTC,Well then it's great to know that I already have a little bit of support on the idea! I shall make an official post on the sub to ask everyone's opinion. It is definitely in my top 3 project ideas.
lifeofnorman,3ai7pv,oxy-mo,8,Sat Jun 20 12:39:45 2015 UTC,I just love Norman's whole thought process
lifeofnorman,3ai7pv,SonOfTheBlueMeanie,4,Sat Jun 20 18:12:11 2015 UTC,That thought at the beginning made me snort. Well done. There should always be a funny part in every Norman story.
lifeofnorman,3ahjzz,HumpCakes,16,Sat Jun 20 06:16:15 2015 UTC,"Only Norman could pretend his bullies are friends, and mistake friendly people as someone he doesn't want to talk to.    At least he has CSI"
lifeofnorman,3ahjzz,lordfaultington,8,Sat Jun 20 08:53:24 2015 UTC,I imagine Norman likes all people. But I wanted to write a story about somebody who irritated him enough to do something totally irrational. Maybe he later apologizes to Darrel and they become best office friends?
lifeofnorman,3ahjzz,Frankonovich,4,Sat Jun 20 09:18:52 2015 UTC,I like this. I've been thinking Norman needs someone from the office like this who may put him in unconventional Norman situations because he's too over bearing. Like a day at the bar for happy hour or a small house party or something.
lifeofnorman,3ahjzz,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,3,Sat Jun 20 12:53:29 2015 UTC,"Darrel was new. But despite being new, Darrel was always slapping Norman on the back, and always after saying something like, 'Hey Ace!', or, 'This guy knows what I'm talking about!' But Norman never knew what Darrel was talking about....   Based on this paragraph alone, I'm pretty sure I work with the French version of Darrel."
lifeofnorman,3abjz1,WalravenTales,15,Thu Jun 18 19:38:14 2015 UTC,Great Norman story. I think that the presence of details is neither good nor bad.
lifeofnorman,3abjz1,eskimobob117,10,Thu Jun 18 22:49:33 2015 UTC,I love that the top three comments give three completely different opinions on the level of detail. I happen to agree with this one.
lifeofnorman,3abjz1,Mikey_Jarrell,20,Fri Jun 19 00:09:06 2015 UTC,"Good try. But the joy of Norman is the lack of details. We all already know he would totally drive a metro and wear jean shorts but, as with any prose, less is more."

lifeofnorman,39ht8t,t1m1d,8,Fri Jun 12 04:27:53 2015 UTC,Norman's the kinda guy that takes a shower the night before instead of in the morning
lifeofnorman,39ht8t,camiasm,2,Fri Jun 12 14:41:49 2015 UTC,I imagine Norman to adjust taps to a correct temperature before putting the plug into the hole.  Flipping the taps shows the pressure be was under at the office today!

Norman instead tries to please everyone around him, being so conscious of others to the point that he shrinks.

Jeff had assured him it was powdered, low-strength tobacco. Granted, Jeff was a joker and sometimes put salt in the officer sugar container, so the tobacco powder was probably just flour. Norman didn't know what tobacco looked like, so he was secretly hoping that was the case.   Normally, Norman would never smoke of course, but today was a special occasion. It was little Norman's birthday and he had purchased these new DVDs. Using the butane lighter Jeff had given him, Norman lit the pipe and inhaled as it burst into flames. He didn't care, though. Something was happening. Something funny. Something inside his head. As the theme song from the Andy Griffith show intensified, Norman knew this would be the single greatest evening of his life."

lifeofnorman,36bk5w,Ayyv,26,Mon May 18 01:26:09 2015 UTC,This really resonates with me. I have avoided ordering things out of awkwardness with pronunciation.   I'm a Norman.

lifeofnorman,36ashh,ProckTheMighty,5,Mon May 18 02:33:46 2015 UTC,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt#Etymology_and_spelling
lifeofnorman,36ashh,shaolinpunks,2,Mon May 18 02:53:41 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Etymology and spelling of article  Yogurt:       The word is derived from Turkish: yoğurt,  and is usually related to the verb yoğurmak: ""to be curdled or coagulated; to thicken"".  or yuğur- ""id"" and the suffix -t.  The letter ğ was traditionally rendered as ""gh"" in transliterations of Turkish prior to 1928.  In older Turkish, the letter denoted a voiced velar fricative /ɣ/, but this sound is elided between back vowels in modern Turkish, in which the word is pronounced [joˈuɾt], or [joˈɰuɾt].  In English, there are several variations of the spelling of the word, including yogurt, yoghurt and to a lesser extent yoghourt, yogourt, yaghourt, yahourth, yoghurd, joghourt, and jogourt. In the United Kingdom and Australia, yogurt and yoghurt are both current, yogurt being used by the Australian and British dairy councils, and yoghourt is an uncommon alternative. In the United States, yogurt is the usual spelling and yoghurt a minor variant. In New Zealand, yoghurt is preferred by the New Zealand Oxford Dictionary. In Canada, yogurt is most common among English speakers although ""yoghurt"" is also used, but many brands use yogourt, since it is an acceptable spelling in both English and French, the official languages of Canada.  Historically there have also been cases of yogurt being spelt with a ""J"" instead of a ""Y"" (e.g. jogurt and joghurt) due to alternative transliteration methods. However, there has been a decline in these variations in English speaking countries, but in certain European countries it is still commonly spelt with a ""J"". Most people tend to spell in the manner shown on the packaging of the major brands in their country.

The structure of your post seems a bit strange too, almost like you've put way too many full stops in. However I am not trying to critique your spelling and grammar or be a jackass. Besides you don't naively speak English so it doesn't really matter. Good post btw."
