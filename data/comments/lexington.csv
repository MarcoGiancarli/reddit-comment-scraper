I'd try food places near campus; I'm sure they're all looking to hire on more people for the incoming students for the fall. Cane's seems to have a cool crew every time I'm there.   Try the UK jobs website. Lots of non-work study jobs listed (you don't have to be a UK student for all of them, but check first).   Do you have retail experience? Virtually every store in the mall will be hiring on for back to school sales. You might have already missed the boat a little bit there, but it's worth a shot! Try the high school/college-demographic clothing stores."

lexington,3dzos0,threenil,2,Mon Jul 20 20:55:55 2015 UTC,"I go to Gym Laird once a week and lift on my own at LA Fitness the rest of the time. Jim, the owner of Gym Laird, is a great guy with a ton of experience. I have been lifting for nearly a decade now, mostly on my own, and started with Jim a little over a year ago. It's been pretty fucking great so far: really recovering from a back injury, moving better than ever, and (most importantly for my goals) getting stronger.  My plan is about $42 for a semi-private session which I pay monthly -- more visits per week makes it cheaper (2x/week is is about $33/session). Semi-private means me and a few others working with Jim as well as a few other people floating around working with the other trainer (Lucy).  There's group classes as well. I believe you pay monthly for those and can go to unlimited groups. They'll encourage you to go 2-3 time per week, but it depends on how you recover. Not sure what the price is on groups.  They'll want you to come in on a Saturday and do a consult where they'll take a look at how you move and give you some recommendations on what things they have that would suit you. I think the consult is free or at least very cheap (less than $20). If they don't have anything, they'll tell you. My consult was more like a mini training session with some advice on things to work on."

The buildings look new but, as I understand it, were originally from the 70's so I think they are just drafty. They are VERY creaky; I used to get woken up in the morning by my upstairs neighbor getting out of bed and walking around his bedroom.

lexington,3d1dnu,notsogolden,2,Sun Jul 12 18:46:00 2015 UTC,"I did Uber and Lyft last summer/fall. At first I was making quite a bit ($200-400 a week) but that slowed down a lot as it got oversaturated with drivers. I also really only made money Thurs-Sat, and most of it was between 10pm-4am. The vast majority of riders are drunk people, and I had a lot of problems with college students getting pissy because I wouldn't let them put 6-7 people in my 4-passenger car or bring open containers with them. Eventually I decided it wasn't worth the hassle.   I also had problems with Uber paying out their promotional rates (guaranteed a certain $$/hour if you drive a certain number of hours & have a high acceptance rate) due to problems with their app and outdated phones. I read they were going to start letting drivers use their own phones so that may be different now, but I quit driving before that happened."

lexington,3ctdy1,heisenberg69,10,Fri Jul 10 18:40:26 2015 UTC,"This isnt stated in the best way or politely, but heIsenberg has a point. Bevin's actual stance is pretty different than how everyone is trying to spin his statement."
lexington,3ctdy1,Zimmerpflanzen_MD,2,Fri Jul 10 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"Before the ruling I had thought this was a nice libertarian way to get gay marriage 'legalized' -- just ignore marriage period from the state's POV (or record it only).  Funny how it only gets suggested now, in response to the government making a decision some don't like.  This would of course destroy the institution of marriage in a way same-sex rights never could."
lexington,3ctdy1,gooshie,2,Sat Jul 11 01:21:55 2015 UTC,"I also found it strange that this was the stance the anti-gay crowd took post-ruling as well. It's an odd change of tune, that's for sure. There are some political figures that have been maintaining this stance for some time, but it's odd how many have come out of the woodwork in the last few weeks. I'm skeptical of the intentions behind some of the newfound 'libertarian' politicians in regard to marriage, even if I agree with their proposed solution. Being LGBT and libertarian myself, I'm in a bit of an odd political spot."
lexington,3ctdy1,Zimmerpflanzen_MD,0,Sat Jul 11 01:35:52 2015 UTC,Well equal is equal; but I really don't want to tell the rest of the world if they move here we just won't consider them married.  And we'll never convince the real liberals in the rest of the world this wasn't big baby WASPs breaking everything in a tantrum so noone else could play with their toys.

lexington,3ctdy1,sixt5,-1,Fri Jul 10 18:46:27 2015 UTC,"Bevin is a funny creature. Sometimes he tries to be a Tea Partier, sometimes he's a Libertarian, sometimes he's a mainline Republican from the 80s. And, he kinda has to be, because the Republican party is so fractured.   I wouldn't mind the idea of government-sanctioned marriages being eliminated, but before we can get to that point we have to uncouple (no pun intended) over 1500 state and federal laws, benefits and rights that are attached to the concept of marriage. That's not going to start next week, next month, or the day after the new governor takes office. It'll have to happen on the federal level first. If Bevin wanted that fight, he should try to knock McConnell off his stoop again."

At the least step aside, otherwise you're eroding the very thing freedom of religion is there to protect. And it protects you too jackass!

Burger is only 1/4 of a pound. Small than any other burger in town. Even alfalfa has 1/3 pound burgers.  Drinks are very expensive as well.  It's decent place to go but def not for a family trying to spend 15 dollars a person.

lexington,3cqwhl,ZebraG301,2,Fri Jul 10 01:31:02 2015 UTC,I saw a poster today that said this is burger week in Lexington (from July 6th to July 12th). I think idea is that they sell really good burgers for $5.   EDIT: We tried the County Club burger and it was very good. My friends went to Drakes in Landsdown and got a humongous burger. One said it was the best restaurant burger she'd ever had in her life.  I had to be out of town for almost the whole week. Next year I will try them all or pop trying.
