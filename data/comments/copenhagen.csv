copenhagen,3e64yx,scottishswan,6,Wed Jul 22 06:35:11 2015 UTC,Whenever I travel with Øresundstoget they usually have the aircon set somewhere between frostbite and arctic hellscape.
copenhagen,3e64yx,Monosodium_Glutamate,2,Wed Jul 22 06:52:11 2015 UTC,"The train from Århus to Copenhagen as well! It's like they're telling us... ""hey look, we have AC! WE INSTALLED AC FOR YOU, WE'RE DAMN WELL GONNA USE IT!""  It feels a bit silly when you have to put on a jacket in the train."
copenhagen,3e64yx,Intigo,6,Wed Jul 22 10:49:00 2015 UTC,"I guess you mean openable windows :)  Each car usually has a few windows that can be cracked open at the top. Other than that, I guess it's not open-a-window weather here enough of the time that it makes sense to implement that feature.  As for why the heating is on, that is a good question. Negligence, maybe?"
copenhagen,3e64yx,Umsakis,2,Wed Jul 22 06:51:43 2015 UTC,"The reason why trains don't have openable windows is they are equipped with aircon. If the windows could be opened the aircon would be effectively try to cool down the outside world, which would cause it to break down rapidly.  Also, having an open window on a train going 140km/h is not a good idea.  If the car is too hot, ask the conductor to turn up the cooling - in some cases they have been broken and you should just move to another car."

copenhagen,3dodu5,mattmilly,2,Sat Jul 18 09:28:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Danes are rude - I know a number of them to be some of the warmest people I know.  However, if you're coming at it from another cultural perspective, on the surface it can sometimes seem that they don't uphold the same values  when it comes to general courtesy in public.  The notion of queue for services has many unwritten rules of conduct in Britain. If one of them is broken by another stranger (eg. queue-jumping, stalling, talking on the phone while being served, not allowing elderly/expectant mums first priority - that is, if you're exceptionally polite) - we can often be seen tutting with displeasure and displaying other emotions of passive aggression.  In my experience, those ideals of what is appropriate behavior are necessarily upheld over here. Take waiting for a bus, for example. The general notion for queuing in an orderly fashion is usually kept, right up until the bus arrives a the stop. Then it's a complete free-for-all. To me, it's so strange that this happens, yet no one else considers it to be an issue to get aggravated by.  Supermarkets, too. One minute, we're all queueing in line for a checkout, then as the line begins to get too long, another cashier will jump on the till and suddenly there's a frantic rush from the back to be the first for that till instead. Seems unfair to me to not let the people who've queued the longest to at least have a chance to change line first.  Perhaps this particular example is more of a Copenhagen trait than a Danish one though. Has anyone else experienced this behavior also?"

copenhagen,3djs2f,Maias227,3,Thu Jul 16 23:48:00 2015 UTC,Hmm I'd probably not choose Nyhavn unless you can afford doing it in the priciest hotel there though there's a beautiful church you can get to the top of for a view of historical centre including the present royal palace. I got no idea if it's allowed to do stuff like that and sometimes Danes can be a bit strict about rules. Otherwise I would recommend maybe The King's Garden or the botanical garden. The latter have a few more secluded while the King's Garden have been the center of plenty of love songs.  Alternatively you could also charter one of the many small boats and go to some of the old fortress islands in the harbour for their unique setting and view. It all depends on the weather though

Like, to the point that getting a clear shot w/ the fabulous backdrop you're looking for will be tricky owing to the crowds. If you're still looking for something iconic, proposing in Christianshavn with the coloured houses along the canal in the background would do the trick as well, and then you could wander the city, see some sights, and take some more candid photos after the fact.

copenhagen,3d37sr,nugga,3,Mon Jul 13 04:04:58 2015 UTC,"To compare your travel options, you could start by looking at http://www.rome2rio.com/  To figure out which places to check out, see the links under ""For Tourists"" in the sidebar, or visit http://www.tripadvisor.com/  As for prepaid SIM, it might depend what you want to use it for: voice calling, or data? Be aware that Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo are all in different countries, so no matter where you get your SIM card, about 2/3 of your time here you'll be roaming internationally. If you just want reasonably priced voice calls, for availability in emergencies, perhaps Lebara might be a good option."
copenhagen,3d37sr,alreddyReddit,3,Mon Jul 13 07:42:42 2015 UTC,"If you boy a Telia sim card you can use it in all the Nordic countries without extra fees or roaming charges. Cell phone coverage is universal in and around the towns, so one operator is not better than the other.  If I was you I'd take trains between the cities. It might be cheaper with a bus, but trains are quicker and more comfy. Book train tickets well in advance if you want the cheap tickets. You can get them through sj.se. Try swebus, nettbus and eurolines for bus tickets."
copenhagen,3d37sr,analo69,3,Mon Jul 13 10:37:36 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'll try to answer your questions the best I can. So - if you're not renting a car or flying, then the train is the best option from Stockholm to Copenhagen. It's about six hours, not too expensive (mind you, everything is expensive here) and a beautiful trip. Going from Copenhagen to Oslo, I think you could take the train from Cph to Gothenburg, and then onwards to Oslo. But there also an overnight ferry. You leave Cph in the afternoon, and arrive the next morning in Oslo. It's pretty nice trip!  So check that out. If you haven't booked any hotels, I would always reccomend AirBnB, which is way more fun. And in Copenhagen, remember to get bikes and drive around - the best way to see the city.   The hop-on/hop-off busses are horrible, but the Canaltours are quite nice!   No clue of the prepaid, but 3 and Telenor are in all countries, maybe there's something there.  Happy travels!"
copenhagen,3d37sr,tripaq,2,Mon Jul 13 10:43:42 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the response, I looked into renting a car and it's surprisingly very expensive. I've been looking at trains since when we travel in Europe that's how we usually get around. Is acprail a good company? What train companies would you recommend that are reasonably priced considering there's 4 of us. I looked into the ferry and that looks awesome so we might do that from Copenhagen to Oslo, are there multiple companies who offer ferry rides or is it just dfds seaways? Love using airbnb when I travel so I'm definitely going to look into that but what areas would you recommend we stay? Again, thanks for all the help."
copenhagen,3d37sr,w00tzor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:37:20 2015 UTC,"It's only DFDS who offers ferry from Copenhagen to Oslo. IMO if you can find a place near a metro station you are set. CPH isn't that big - you can ride a bike from one end to the other in less then an hour. Check out Amager(Amagerbro), Kongens Nytorv/Nyhavn, Frederiksberg, Østerbro or the inner part of Nørrebro close to centrum."
copenhagen,3d37sr,tripaq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:56:43 2015 UTC,"Train companies are pretty much the same, so just get on the cheapest, most convenient one. No reason to spend too much energy on this. I would recommend the same places as /u/w00tzor, but add in Vesterbro.   I would look for places in the following neighborhoods: Vesterbro, Frederiksberg (close to the city/metro), Inner Nørrebro or Østerbro. In this order.   In all three cities public transportation is very very good, so there's really no reason to get a car. Even if you want to go a bit outside Cph, the trains will take you there. Good daytrips are Roskilde (Viking museum and cathedral) or Helsingør (Elsinore in english, Kronborg castle).  And remember: if you are in Cph, bikes are the very best way to get around. When you find an AirBnB, then find a bike rental place close by.  Happy travels"
copenhagen,3d37sr,SexyFishHorse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:54:39 2015 UTC,I'd recommend the ferry from Cph to Oslo. I've been on it several times and I love it.  The scenery is really gorgeous and the ferry itself is not that expensive (they expect you to spend a lot of money on the ferry instead so if you can control yourselves it'll be cheap-ish)

copenhagen,3d37sr,TWKill,2,Mon Jul 13 17:28:03 2015 UTC,Look into getting a sim card from the company 3. I believe they have some sort of promotion where they treat the different countries as one hence no roaming charges.
copenhagen,3d37sr,TWKill,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:37:38 2015 UTC,"Traveling: Personally i would recommend taking the train from Stockholm to Copenhagen. It is a direct and high-speed train. From Copenhagen to Oslo i would say the same as tripaq with a night trip by boat. (I have never done it myself but always heard good things about the ferry and the trip) - I will also say i am far from sure this is the cheapest, but i am pretty sure it is the most comfortable.  Mobile: I would say the same as Maias227, only because i have it myself and i know they are also a provider in both Sweden and Norway.  Where to go: Copenhagen is very small and you can walk almost all of it.  The Little Mermaid - I had walked it myself, but for you in your short visit i would take a Canaltour. If you do not need a close-up picture of her you do not need to go there in person and the cancaltour will come close enough. Besides that you will pass the Royal Ship ""Dannebro"" (If anchored) and the last and only battletested submarine in the danish marine as well as lots of nice neigborhoods.   Rundetaern - A church tower, where it is possible to get on top and getting a view over all of Cophenhagen (Takes around 30 min) Really worth the time and price (about 25 DK kr).  Tivoli - Probably one of the citys best know attractions. If you do not have the time for a hole day in tivoli i recommend just bying the entrance (100 dk kr) at the evening and see the beautiful lightings and walk a tour arround the park and on Fridays there is a free (except from the entrance) concerts in the park at 22h.  Nyhavn - One of the most cozy areas in town and at the same time the biggest tourist traps. You will get the desire to eat at one of the restuarant but i would not recomment it, because you just do not get enough for your money.   Torvehallerne - Closest thing to a Bazzar in CPH. But it is a very nice place and we as locals love going there (when we have money for it...) Even if you are not hungry it is just a nice atmosphere. Also it is very close to soerne ""the lakes"" and the dronning louises bro ""Queen Louises Bridge"" which is one of the most hip areas to hang out in Cph. (not completely true, but on a sunny day the bridge will be packed.)   If you are in to all the Royal stuff: Amalienborg Slot/Palace - It is the home of the Monarch.  Rosenborg Slot/Palace - The home of the Crown Jewelsh. The ticket also gives you entrance to the museum about the Palace it self and the royal family.   If you are into art: SMK (The States Museum of Art/The National Art Museum of Denmark) - Exactly what you would expect, except for a very large collection of Dutch art. (And it is free.)  Carlsberg Glyptotek - Just a large beautiful art museum. I do not know much about art but i do know i like to be at the Glyptotek. (Almost all of the museums in Cph has a free-entrance day per week, but i do not know which day it is)  If you are into beer: (The Classic place to go) Carlsberg Visitor Center - Where you can come to hear about the brewery s history and get a taste of their beer.  Mikkeler - My favorit beer Bar! It is just very cool place. Lovely micro brewery with great beers and a nice chili sausage which goes well with a dark beer. (A bit expensive though)  Noerrebro Bryghus/Brewery - Again a local micro brewery making some nice local beers.  VISIT CPH FOR THE FOOD! - As a Dane living in CPH i just love the restaurants. But i can already warn you i do not know about many traditional places to go... But i will start with the 2 i will recomment:  Rio Bravo - Very traditional and good food for the price.  The only open sandwich place at Torvehallerne - I am sorry but i do not know what it is name but they sell Smoerrebroed/Open sandwiches there is very nice.  Not traditionals but very good for the price: Cocks and Cows - Probably one of the best burger places in Cophenhagen. They have in my opinion one of the best burger buns (the sweet american) and their twister fries is preferable.  Halifax - The best fries and my favorit burger place.  LeLe street kitchen - Vietnames kitchen. If you are looking for some crispy and fresh food, it is here. Madklubben - A ""chain"" of resturants. Well not completely true. It is a handfull of different restuarants owned by the same group of chefs (the food club). My favorit is the one at Vesterbro. Den Lille Fede (meaning the little fat one) - Just a modern restuarant that shows what the modern Restuarant is all about. La Fiorita - My local and Copenhagens best Pizzaria. Well if you like it Italian style. Very thin, simple and tastefull. And they have their own Icecream shop across the street.   The more expensive but good places: There is alot of these but not many i have been to... so... here we go. Uformel - I will always recomment it, but i find it expensive even though it is not that bad considerating normal prices in Denmark. Brd. Price - 2 casual TV chef brothers starting their own restuarants which serves some very delicious food. Mash - I have actually never been there but they should serve the best steak in the Kingdom of Denmark. I am not sure but from the price they better be. It is probably my next ""fancy"" stop.  Icecream:  Siciliansk Is (Sicilian icecream) - My most visited and favorit icecream shop.  Ismejeriet - Probably Copenhagens best icecream shop, but sadly a bit far out from the center... Mama Che Gelato - Some homehade great icecream.  I hope you do not find it too much and that you can use some of it. There is alot more to Cophenhagen and Denmark. You should also try our pastery, but i am to biased because of my side job at a bakery but i will just say. Try the strawberry cake... I hope it helps and have a nice trip. :)"
copenhagen,3d1db2,TrolliusJKingIIIEsq,5,Sun Jul 12 18:42:58 2015 UTC,"In Denmark, prices are usually including VAT unless otherwise demo tasted. Not sure if it is law or just common fucking sense and tradition, but it makes me hate shopping in online stores that add my local 25% as an afterthought."
copenhagen,3d1db2,noreallyimthepope,4,Sun Jul 12 19:53:48 2015 UTC,It's the law that VAT must be included in a clearly marked price (in case other price is also shown) on all normal sales. This does not include offers targeted at businesses that usually never include (nor mention) VAT.
copenhagen,3d1db2,gjoel,4,Sun Jul 12 20:53:57 2015 UTC,I think it's only in the US where vat is not included in the advertised price.
copenhagen,3d1db2,PrettyMuchDanish,2,Sun Jul 12 19:44:48 2015 UTC,The US uses a sales tax system rather than VAT
copenhagen,3d1db2,chef_baboon,2,Wed Jul 15 09:38:57 2015 UTC,What is the difference?
copenhagen,3d1db2,PrettyMuchDanish,3,Wed Jul 15 09:44:44 2015 UTC,"€107 should be the full price including VAT - but do keep in mind that things like shipping costs are sometimes only apparent when checking out.  The Danish legislation requires VAT to be included in the price when advertised to consumers. If it's B2B companies can list the price without VAT. The reasoning is that VAT is something consumers have to pay regardless, so it only makes sense to state the full price with VAT.  The VAT is 25% and is the same in the entire country (unlike American states, for instance)."
copenhagen,3d1db2,loib,2,Mon Jul 13 00:07:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, that's helpful, but the website for the Copenhagen Card says it's €107, while if I go to the website for Tivoli, it says that Tivoli admission is 99 DKK, but when I continue it tacks on another 19.8 DKK which it very clearly states is the VAT.    Any idea why the Tivoli website would not include the VAT in the advertised price, if it's supposed to do so by law?  And why is it only 20% for this and not the 25% that it seems like it should be?  EDIT: changed wording for clarity about the Tivoli website."
copenhagen,3d1db2,madmoose,6,Mon Jul 13 06:21:02 2015 UTC,"I just checked the Tivoli site, and the 19.80 kr. is not added on to the 99 kr.  It says that the price is 99 kr. and out of that, 19.80 kr. is for VAT. So VAT is included in the 99, but also listed separately. Price without VAT would be 79.20 kr.  It might be confusing to a foreigner, but it works out :)  That's also why it appears to be 20%. If VAT is 25% then VAT makes up 20% of the price after VAT has been added."
copenhagen,3d1db2,docatron,2,Mon Jul 13 07:38:35 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer and I would like to add that it is required to show how much of the total price the VAT is. That is why it is on there with the total.

copenhagen,3d08zf,RubyGetsNaked,4,Sun Jul 12 21:31:46 2015 UTC,Flyet får sin opdrift fra luftens strømning over vingerne - modvind betyder at mere luft strømmer over vingerne hvilket betyder at flyet ikke behøver at flyve så hurtigt for at få samme opdrift og så bliver det nemmere at lette og lande.

Sidstnævnte virker dog bedst hvis du allerede er i arbejde og har par lønsedler med. Boligselskaber vil ofte gerne have det arbejdende folk ind, og have en sikkerhed for at folk har penge til at betale regningerne..  Prøv at google lidt på flexibel udlejning. Du skal kontakte boligselskab direkte, dvs helst møde fysisk op på kontoret, gerne i arbejdstøj.. (hvilket self er svært når du ikke er startet endnu). Jeg stod skrevet op i årevis på venteliste via nettet og var jævntligt inde og tjekke hvad nr jeg var i køen men kunne ikke forstå at jeg bare røg længere og længere ned på listen.. min kollega lavede tricket med at tage ned i arbejdstøj og snakke med dem, 3 dage efter fik han en lejlighed. Var på det tidspunkt dog blevet så nederen over systemet og alle de penge jeg havde betalt for at stå skrevet op hos selskaber så jeg gik ud og købte i stedet..   Men det er sådan systemet virker.  Tjek de 1 værelses i farum midtpunkt, de er ret store, mener omkring 50kvm og de ligger godt mht transport og er i ret god stand.  Det er altid de mindste og de aller største lejligheder der er nemmest at få fingrene i hos boligselskaber, da efterspørgsel på 2 og 3 vær er størst.

copenhagen,3cnsi5,mandarin_duckling,12,Thu Jul 9 10:04:15 2015 UTC,La Glace (Skoubogade in downtown). Probably the most famous in town and popular with tourists and locals alike.  Reinh Van Hauen (very good bakery chain with various addresses around town. Try their strawbeerry tarte.)  Nimb Terasse if you want a nice sit in (near tivoli)  Some would also mention the bakery chain Lagkagehuset. They are okay but I think they have deteriorated in quality as they expanded (and raised prices).  There are also lots of popular smaller bakeries some of which have a branch in Torvehallerne near Nørreport.  Enjoy!

Good Luck!
copenhagen,3ccfxh,0xVince,11,Mon Jul 6 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"Basically, I would like to know how do you do to search for a room or a small flat in Copenhagen ?   It sucks, everyone here knows it sucks, but there's not a lot anyone can do about it (rent pricing laws vs insane demand). People will suggest websites, newspapers, word of mouth, or through your employer/school, but nothing is really a sure bet, especially not newspapers.    Do you mostly go to real estate agencies ?   They tend to not represent rental properties, because people have no issues finding renters for their apartments. You can try to contact a few, but usually they can't help you.   Is there any very popular websites similar to Craigslist for housing ?    DBA.dk is basically Danish craigslist, but I would say the most popular sites are BoligPortal.dk and Lejebolig.dk. There are several other more niche websites that are mostly corporate only rentals (a business has to rent it for an employee) or Pension-owned buildings that sometimes offer leases to regular people. If it comes down to it, there are probably several Airbnb places that offer long term rentals, which you can use as a place to stay while you find something more long term.    Is it usual to go to paying advertisements websites (where you need to pay to have landlord contact)    Unless you get lucky with another website, or know someone that can offer you a place, it's basically essential to pay for one (or more) of them. When I was searching, I got a message back from a landlord saying they received over 100 messages in 15 minutes of posting the ad. That's the kind of competition you have.   Tips- don't wait to find a place. The sooner you start, the better. September is the worst time to apartment-hunt, because it's when every other student is looking for a place. It's going to be very tough to get a place when you aren't currently living there, landlords will usually always prefer to meet the tenant instead of offering their apartment to a stranger from the internet, that's why Airbnb might be a good place to look as well.   The best thing to do is take advantage of whatever unique help you can get, in this case the university. If there are any options the University has for providing housing, take it!"
copenhagen,3ccfxh,blaizedm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:17:18 2015 UTC,"This guy covered it pretty well.   @OP, you might wanna tell us your budget since that will help narrow down options."
copenhagen,3ccfxh,Masterbrew,2,Tue Jul 7 00:28:43 2015 UTC,"Indeed, everything well explained ! Budget she has is maximum 4400 DKK / month (a little bit lower would be nice for sure!)"
copenhagen,3ccfxh,Masterbrew,5,Tue Jul 7 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"Alright. For about 3500 she can rent a single room in a fairly good location, such as Vesterbro/Nørrebro. But she would have to be okay with living in a shared apartment. I think the best way to find something like this is Boligportal.dk and possibly Facebook groups.  Finding a 1-room or 2-room apartment (not shared) for 4400 DKK would require crazy luck, but the best odds of finding something like that would be to network with the locals from Uni. An opportunity might arise when someone in this network goes travelling or does exchange studies leaving an empty apartment behind.   I think the most practical solution is to team up with 2-3 others and look for private rentals. With a combined budget of >12000 DKK you enter a different tier of the market, where demand is less crazy and more opportunities should arise."
copenhagen,3ccfxh,DonPedroDelaVega,9,Tue Jul 7 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"Draw a circle around Copenhagen where you can reach inner city on a 30-40 min train ride. Find a temporary place and work yourself closer to Copenhagen from there.. Once you start school you'll meet people find friends and probably some contacts, and it will be easier. It can be expensive in Copenhagen though. I my self love the city, but prefer not to live in it and rather stay a bit outside in the more quiet areas. But everybody is different."
copenhagen,3ccfxh,PmMeYourPartyPics,3,Mon Jul 6 21:31:49 2015 UTC,This is the best way to do it. It is much easier and cheaper finding a rental place in Roskilde or Køge than in Copenhagen.
copenhagen,3ccfxh,SexyFishHorse,2,Tue Jul 7 03:55:05 2015 UTC,It's not really that easy to find a rental in Køge. I've been searching up and down for about 6 months now with no luck.  Then again I have a dog which limits my options quite a bit though.

copenhagen,3ccfxh,Mizar83,3,Mon Jul 6 21:53:27 2015 UTC,"As the others said: if the university offers some help, take. If it's not clear, send them an email asking for help.  It's impossible to find long term housing by yourself without being here. You can try via the housing foundation (http://housingfoundation.ku.dk/), I think their limit is one year, but I'm not sure if their prices are affordable for students.  Otherwise you will have to juggle possibly several temporary flats while you hunt for one. I knew of a PhD who changed 6 apartments in 3 years. It's the worst housing market I ever found myself into in my international wanderings... good luck!"

copenhagen,3ccfxh,tatajean,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunate but to be expected :(  Then I suppose your best bet is AirBnb, I don't think you can catch something on boligportal or similar website when 100 people that are already here are writing too.  Or you can hope and get lucky that some friend of a friend on reddit or facebook knows something. Watch out for scams though (http://housingfoundation.ku.dk/finding_housing_yourself/dont-get-scammed/), they are sadly common in a market full of desperate students.  Edit: in case you really  find nothing, there is always the university guest house (http://ism.ku.dk/ugh/). I suppose that as a student you can ask for a room there (but I'm not sure, you can try send them a mail). Is more expensive than an apartment, but very much cheaper than any hotel, and you can also register your CPR there if needed."

I quieted searching and posted an announcement on DBA and paid to stay on the front page for couple of days. I wrote what I am looking for, added a picture of myself and lucky got contacted by an elderly couple to take over one of their apartments for one year because they want to sell it next year. I got a 60 sqm 1-room apartment in the city for a price of 6800 DKK, just so you make an idea about prices. I also signed up for some housing associations but don't consider those ones if your gf doesn't plan to stay in Denmark.

It's cute, it's pretty, it's fun and it has a nice atmosphere.  Hit up Kødbyen (Meat Packing District) for one of your evenings. Plenty of options for good food at a decent price. It's also in a fascinating area of Copenhagen. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B8dbyen Hit up a beer bar if that's your thing. I am biased to http://oerstedoelbar.dk/ Walk all over inner Copenhagen, enjoy the atmosphere and the pretty city. Be sure to hit up Rundetårn, Christiansborg, Kongens Have, Rosenborg Slot, Rådhudspladsen, Kongens Nytorv, Amalienborg and so forth on this walk. All of this stuff is easily within walking distance of each other and the walks between them are nice. Christiania is nice, spend an hour or 2 or 3 there too. Get some food, some beer or some funny tobacco if you like that kind of thing. Maybe do one of the canal trips at Kongens Nytorv if the weather is nice and you manage to get one quickly. They can be a bit lengthy, but they're usually nice. Walk around Nørrebro. Assistens Kirkegård and the entire area around Jægersborggade / Stefansgade is nice. You can do Kastellet + The Little Mermaid + etc. too, but if you see the mermaid from the canal trip then I don't think you're missing out much if you skip it.    Some ideas."
copenhagen,3bzk1d,Intigo,2,Fri Jul 3 13:12:28 2015 UTC,"Kødbyen:       Kødbyen (Danish, literally ""the meat-town""), occasionally translated to Meat District (or 'Meatpacking District', after the New York City neighbourhood), is a district of Vesterbro in Copenhagen, Denmark. It is situated between the railway lines going into Copenhagen Central Station and the street Sønder Boulevard.  The Meat District consists of three separate areas, referred to as the White, Grey and Brown Kødby for the dominant colour of their buildings.  The brown part (Den brune Kødby) is the oldest area, closest to the Central Station, and dating from 1883. It has since c. 2000 been changed into a new creative cluster with galleries, art cafés, nightlife and small creative businesses like studios and architecture firms in the historical buildings. It is also home to DGI-byen, a sports, swimming and conference complex, and the exhibition hall Øksnehallen, originally a stabling place for 1,600 cattle before slaughtering.

It truly is a really great city to experience in this way as everything is pretty tightly packed. Even going to Nørrebro is nice as you cross a really cool bridge (Dronning Louise's Bro) always filled with people in the summer time. It also takes you by Torvehallerne which is a little market place.  This is the road I mean:   http://i.imgur.com/QPxEP4B.png  Anyway, you'll love it, don't worry."
copenhagen,3bzk1d,alreddyReddit,2,Fri Jul 3 13:39:30 2015 UTC,"40 euros will not get you far in terms of food and eating at restaurants - a main course most places is around 20 euros not including drinks. There are plenty of options to get great gourmet hotdogs and great sandwiches for around 10 euros, but a trip to a restaurant in Kødbyen (or anywhere really) would not be advisable on your budget. At least from my experience, if a meal is cheaper than 15-18 euros at a restaurant, you might as well enjoy a pizza and a six-pack of beer in a park, which is pretty normal for Copenhageners at your age. Of course it all depends on your priorities. If the weather is great you can walk everywhere you need to be instead of paying for public transportation. And if your accomodation allows you to eat breakfast and pack a lunch to take with you, you'll obviously save a lot of money from that as well. And given your short stay i wouldn't really bother with anyplace charging an entrance fee. There is just as much to be experienced for free from just walking around the city. Edit: Added some advice instead of ruining just the dreams of a great experience on a low budget :)"

Anyhow, to answer your question, most places will be fine and cost about the same, but do keep an eye on the exchange rate and fee. Since you said it's a short trip, simply using a British atm might be a decent option - it might be upwards of 50kr in fees, but you should get the market exchange rate +1~2%."

copenhagen,3brers,Mostlyadogperson,3,Wed Jul 1 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"For 500-600kr you can get a 3-4 course meal for two people depending on the restaurant. Here are some random recommendations (there are hundreds of restaurants in the city, these are just some of my personal favourites divided by country/genre):  Streetfood (yes you can also get wine - there are wine bars):   Torvehallerne - Close to Nørreport St. has all kinds of different stuff. kind of a hipster/semi-expensive place, but nice imo. Copenhagen streetfood - This is located on ""Holmen"", you will need a bus or a 15min walk from Christianshavn Metro. This is a bit less expensive than Torvehallerne, but equally nice. Food from all over the world, including Denmark.   For Italian food:    Tonys (they have a 3-course for 200kr pris fixe concept)  FIAT  Gorm's,  Cofoco restaurants (several different italian/new nordic). Bæst - just got a michelin recommendation (not star)   French (none of these are particularly ""fancy"" or expensive, just regular french bistro food):   L'education nationale. Francophile - (this is about 1 hour from Copenhagen in Helsingør Elsinore).    Danish/New Nordic:   Höst, absolutely delicious new nordic food, but this is on the border of your budget. Frk. Barners Kælder (Ms. Barners basment). Traditional Danish food, Smørrebrød (open sandwiches), and other traditional dishes.   Others:   Madklubben (As someone else mentioned), has several excellent restaurants, most also have the pris fixe of 200kr for 3 courses. Barburrito - very nice, very casual mexican food, nice music. Issa - Japanese, very authentic, ramen and other Japanese everyday foods.   The burger scene is higly evolved in Copenhagen, so you can get absolutely amazing burgers + fries. A couple of my favourites of the Copenhagen burger scene:   Halifax - allround good place. No table reservations though. Grillen Nørrebro - my personal favourige burger place. They also have ben and jerry's milk shakes. What more do you want? Vesterbro originale burgerrestaurant - very good, like Grillen. Haché - they have deep fried mars bar, it is an amazing experience. Sliders - I have note personally tried this, but heard a lot of good stuff about it."

If not, definitely worth going to at least one of them (War Pigs is a joint venture between Mikkeller and Three Floyds). Nørrebro Bryghus has a restaurant you can visit and also try a lot of their beers. There are also a few places in and just outside of Tivoli that brew their own house beers. In Kødbyen on the weekends, there's a food event where a local brewery (Rocket Brewing) serves some of their brews. Rebel Foods is a roaming food event in a different location each week, which has a stand serving a few craft beers (I tried one from Gamma Brewing, but there's usually another too). Copenhagen Street Food in Papiroen has a bar in the back that serves a mix of local breweries' beers. One more beer recommendation would be a stand in Torvehallerne (I forget the name but it's by E2 or E4 or around there, They have a couple of breweries I haven't seen anywhere else before, and a lot of Herslev Brewery beers on tap."

Underneath the big words it says the same on all three:  ""Danish farmers collects piss on this years Roskilde Festival to reuse as fertilizer.""    I think it is kinda interesting they can use it as fertilizer though, as far I knew, human waste can generally not be used as fertilizer, due to too high numbers of harmful chemicals in it, compared to animal waste. Basically because we can ingest and use whatever we want, while animals are much more regulated. Of course piss might be cleaner compared to shit, and be used more for the water, than any nutrients."

I was scammed just the other day for a good amount of money so perhaps dont take my advice 😉 Anyway maybe just be open to the landlord about your concerns and tell him you are hesitant. If he is genuine about wanting to rent the flat he should be able to provide some kind of security.  Or maybe he'll get offended and rent the flat to one of the other 1000 people in line...

If so try to look up his name and/or phone number on krak.dk and see if it matches with the address.

copenhagen,3bafkg,Snailyboo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:52:47 2015 UTC,Well as he isn't asking for money in advance it could be a scam.  I once moved to Berlin. I went a few weeks in advance to look at the apartments I was offered. I think you should do the same.   There are a lot of scam stories in Copenhagen. Esp. When the universities start again (loads of country folks moving to the cities. Always end up with stories of scams )  Good luck to you.
copenhagen,3bafkg,mattmilly,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:51:26 2015 UTC,"It does sound sketchy, and sketchy is never worth it with housing. I don't know how long you plan on being here, but maybe give AirBNB a look? From what I can see, places get reviewed by previous ""renters"" and you establish a raport with the owner, there are basic rules etc.  Regardless of what you do, just remember that if it feels weird it probably is. In the end there is a reason the person is refusing to share photos of the place and is making it hard to see it in any capacity. There might be nothing wrong, but there could be, and they don't seem interested in making it seem less weird for you even though they are wanting you to pay to stay there (which rightfully means you'd like some sense of security) - so it probably is weird."

Look for friendly looking people in the street and just tell them your situation and ask if they got any good ideas. As soon as they realize you're not member of some weird occult society or are trying to sell them anything I think most people will be very helpfull and maybe spend a couple of hours with you.

(I'm quite sure) it's cheap and then it's very central. (https://www.google.dk/maps/dir/55.6825758,12.582444/55.6825603,12.5824562/@55.6818507,12.5838577,15z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2) I've placed the red marker where it's at. The street is called 'Adelgade' and is a sidestreet to a popular street named 'Gothersgade' that has a lot of bars/discos and restaurants. 5-7 min. walk to Nørreport(One of the most central Metro/train stations in copenhagen, and 2-3 min. walk to Kongens Nytorv, which is a beautiful square (unfortunately, currently flooded with construction due to Metro expansion).  If you haven't already, I can't recommend seeing Christiania enough, commonly referred to as Staden. Christiania is a hippy society within our city, where everyone is welcome. It is best known for ""Pusherstreet"" where weed is sold as if it was legal in small shops (Pro tip: keep your mobile in your pants while at pusherstreet, and don't take any pictures!), but theres is a lot more to see than just that, it is probably the best chillout spot in Copenhagen. It is easy to access, just take the metro to Christianshavn St. and follow the crowd of skaters and bearded men. It's a 5 minute walk from the station.  If you go to 'Strøget', which is the main street for shops and stores in Copenhagen, I will recommend that you not only see the main street, but also the side streets, because if you ask me, they are a lot more cozy and comfortable. Nice little shops and cafés on everyone of them, the best hidden gems are in those streets :)  Copenhagen is also quite known for its 5 lakes in the middle of town. The 5 lakes are in extension of each other and spread from Vesterbro - through Nørrebro and ends in Østerbro (Westbridge - Northbridge and Eastbridge). If you have a solid hour to spend, I'll recommend that you buy a Gulddame(Golden Lady) to appear as danish as possible, and take a walk through all five lakes as it is a beautiful walk, and a great way to see most of the districts of Copenhagen.

Then you should definitely go to Mikkeller beer bar (I'm pretty sure they have been or are supplying NOMA with beer).  Go to the center of the city and find Moose bar/ Basement / Wessels Kro. Hopefully you should be drunk by now and you would want to smoke a shitload of cigarettes, and you can do that inside in these places.

copenhagen,3as0en,soadfan08,12,Tue Jun 23 01:14:36 2015 UTC,They're highschool graduation hats. Students wear them then go out boozing. Seems odd to a lot of countries I think - mine included (UK). You'll probably see/hear truck loads of students being driven around on said boozing. Interesting tradition but there you go!
copenhagen,3as0en,JustaPoodle,3,Tue Jun 23 02:02:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, since students didn't have much money back in the day, you were supposed to give them large discounts on everything with the implicit promise that they would easily be able to pay you back once they graduated and got an upper-class job. The hat helped identifying them - though it used to be black not white."
copenhagen,3as0en,thetarget3,6,Tue Jun 23 05:48:40 2015 UTC,Truck loads in this instance isn't the imperial measurement (see: shit loads). There are quite literally party trucks being driven around with horns etc
copenhagen,3as0en,steve50x,4,Tue Jun 23 09:16:16 2015 UTC,"As mentioned the hats are given when you complete secondary education (high school, trade school etc). The colour will show which school they are from unless it is some fancy customised hat. The two most common is red (ordinary high school) and blue (business high school). You will see a lot of them in the coming week where everybody gets drunk and celebrates all over the place.  Strangely enough you don't get anything when you complete university but only secondary education."
copenhagen,3as0en,Maias227,3,Tue Jun 23 14:47:36 2015 UTC,"Light blue is HF which is a two year high school instead of 3 years, middle blue is HHX which is the business high school, and dark blue is HTX which is the technical/science oriented high school."

copenhagen,3am9e1,gonzalini,7,Sun Jun 21 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"First off, walking tours are a really good way to get an overview of the city. They run at 11am and 3pm every day starting by the steps of the town hall, and they're ""free"" (tips based, so you decide what you pay).  The canal boat tours are nice, more for views than for history (I found the boat noise and megaphone made it harder to understand what the guides said). They run regularly throughout the day, and the netto boats company I think is the cheapest at 40 kr per adult ticket. There's also a few companies running bike tours but I have never been on one of them myself.  Definitely check out Christania. It's a former military area that's been a kind of hippy community since the 70's. It's full of cool street art, odd houses by the lake, it's really unique. There's a certain street near the main entrance called Pusher Street that has a marijuana market (it's still illegal in Denmark though), so you know to either check it out or avoid it depending on your views on that.  You can also get a good view of the city for free by going up Christiansborg's (the Parliment building's) tower. It even has lifts.  If you aren't afraid of heights and can walk up 400 steps, Our Saviour's Church close to Christania is also a good one to see Copenhagen from above.  Also the Copenhagen Street Food stalls in the Papirøen building is an awesome place to grab more affordable food.  It's also nice to sit outside there and have a drink overlooking the royal palace on a sunny day.  If you're in Nørrebro, may as well check out Assistens Cemetery which is a huge cemetary where famous Danes such as Hans Christian Anderson and Neils Bohr are burried. The locals kind of use it like a park, so in the summer it's normal to see people sunbathing around the graves!  Hopefully someone who knows Nørrebro better than I do can recommend good places to eat and drink there :)  Edit: Fixed a link"
copenhagen,3am9e1,BewilderedFingers,2,Sun Jun 21 17:11:07 2015 UTC,"I just showed some Americans Christiania and Papirøen, with the Street food today. It was really good :) Great food at Papirøen. I'm not sure how it is on weekdays. But weekends are packed, yet still enough space for everybody!"

copenhagen,3am9e1,JustaPoodle,6,Mon Jun 22 06:16:12 2015 UTC,"Here is what I made for a friend who went. Im lazy so just copy and pasting it. I studied there for 6 months it is the best place ever!  COPENHAGEN  Dope sites around the city: Best view: Church of our savior - next to Christiania  Christiania – independent nation within Copenhagen where there are wandering dogs and you can buy and smoke weed. It is an interesting place even if you don't want to smoke weed. You can buy organic Christiania beer! I think a huge joint or a gram is like 100kr or 18$. Get high and go to the top of the church ha it has a sorta sketchy stairwell.  By your hostel: Four lakes: drink beer on Nørrebrogade street or anywhere around lakes  You could bike or metro up to Frederiksberg Have (park) and then go over to Copenhangen business School. Kilen building is an amazing building you can walk in.  Best library ever: Det Kongelige Bibliotek – Den sorte Diamant Black diamond library  Kogens Nytorv – famous canal bring a few beers and drink here  Tivoli – Expensive but really cool. Realllly fucking expensive though maybe like 90$ for admission and rides. I think 50$ for walking around which is almost worth it.  Stroget – largest walking street in all of Europe!  Louisiana museum – depending how much you like museums this is a dopppe beautiful museum about 30 min north of Copenhagen.  Danish design museum – really nice chairs National gallery – free huge museum  Drink: https://www.facebook.com/sukkerbageren?fref=pb&hc_location=profile_browser Sukkerbageren - you pay something at the door...40$? and unlimited svedka!! It got really crazy.  Zefside - Cocktailbar - Frederiksholms Kanal 4 – I cant really remember this place but I think it was cool for a hipster pricey cocktail  Carlsberg beer tour – I never did it might be dope  Food: Noma – “best restaurant in the world” Michelin 10000 star or what not. You would have to make a reservation asap and I think its like 400$ a head. I never did it but I bet it is incredible.  I never had enough money to really eat out, so I cooked a lot at home and when I did go out I would get swarma and kabob from middle east restaurants and food stands. Yelp it or something there are a few brunch places were you can have a breakfast buffet of weird good Danish food  Bigger trips options Day trip to Sweden! https://www.skanetrafiken.se/templates/InformationPage.aspx?id=34809&epslanguage= I think you can buy tickets here: Copenhagen Central Station (Københavns Hovedbanegård) – right by your hostel I think. At the main entrance facing the taxi rank – one red Skånetrafiken ticket machine. At the entrance facing Tivoli, two red Skånetrafiken ticket machines. http://www.skanetrafiken.se/templates/InformationPage.aspx?id=34820&epslanguage=E  If I remember correct tickets were about $80. That website was sorta confusing but you can take a one way ticket up the coast of Denmark, stop at some sites, then take a ferry to Sweden and see a few cities and then come back to Denmark. You buy a 24 hr pass and just have to go in that direction. It was very cool I recommend it! Here is what I did: Took a 50 min train north to Hamets Castle in Helsingør and then took a boat to the Swedish city of Helsengborg. Then we took a train to Lund, Malmö, and then back home to Copehagen.  - You could also check out Louisiana museum on this trip I think  Kayak the Copenhagen canals: http://kayakrepublic.dk/en/  I do not know if it will be warm enough to do it but if you can it is sooo awesome. CPH is one of the only cities in ze world with clean enough canals to swim in. They literally just give you a kayak and show you a map and you can see so much rad stuff. We did not do a tour but it might be cool.   I recommend you rent a bike somehow you can see soooo much by bike it is the best way to see the city.  You might want to buy this pass to utilize all the metros and get into Tivoli, Louisiana, I did it with my parents and it seemed like a good value but im not sure http://www.copenhagencard.com"

After the British Royal Navy confiscated the Dano-Norwegian Navy, the practice of confiscating all (or most) of the ships of a defeated enemy became more common and would be expressed by the term Copenhagenize. In 1830, the American author Richard Emmons published an Epic poem on the late war of 1812, the The Fredoniad, or Independence preserved  in which he wrote of the merits and risks of independence:        Relevant: Prize of war | Royal Danish Navy   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

copenhagen,3ab3c4,fingerihalen,2,Thu Jun 18 22:02:51 2015 UTC,"Ah I might have misunderstood.  You're interested in the bonfire and events around that for the midsummer's eve ?  This celebration is called ""Sankt Hans"" or ""Sankt Hans Aften"" (Saint Hans), this celebration (24th of June 2015) is usually free, you'll see bonfires in or near most midsized cities mostly near the beach or near some body of water, where people will get together, sing some songs and generally be in a good mood, go with friends or family if you can to raise the enjoyment - however I'm sure you'll be fine alone as well.  You are correct in assuming the hroar and helge is just a regular play, I thought that was what you were asking for info on - not for the sankt hans bonfire :).  With that said the bonfire is usually near the marina and the viking play, this area is called kalvøen (calf island), the area however havn't been an island since the 1870's where it was reclaimed for the town (just so you don't go looking for an island).  I would keep an eye on the local newspaper for frederikssund if you want to go there, I can also try to ask my family who lives there to keep an eye out for local info (let me know if you want this), I grew up there but moved away many years ago.  The midsummer bonfires are definitely worth a visit, however I can't say which one is better - I'm guessing the one on amagerstrand will be bigger (just a guess though)."

There's usually a lot of people and happy days. The ""vikings"" will welcome the young vikings by taking a dive in the sea, as some kind of baptism or what ever you call it. Usually it's pretty cozy and such. The best view is by far from the sea of course. So if you can charm your way onto a boat. I used to live in the city as a kid."

copenhagen,3a7v4t,Akeleie,3,Thu Jun 18 09:12:13 2015 UTC,"You should rent a bicycle! Bike around! This city is amazing by bike. Get the google maps app on your phone and use it as your GPS. Visit Søerne, Superkilen in Nørrebro, bike by the canal and visit Island Brygge. The freetown Christiania has a lot of interesting buildings and art. It might all seem far away on a map, but most things are only a 10-15 minute ride away from Tivoli. It might seem scary to bike in traffic, but just look at signs and lights, and observe other people. It won't be scary after a ride or two. Oh, if it is sunny you should trek out to Amager Strandpark - an artificial island with a beautiful beach.   I study Art History, and have lived here for a year. My favourite museum is SMK - Statens Museum for Kunst. You can spend hours and hours walking around there. They have a grand collection and exciting new exhibitions every so often. You should also visit Arken and Louisiana, both a train ride from Hovedbanegården.    Bastard Café is a nice place to go if you want to meet people, it is a board game café and you can put up signs on your table if you are looking for more players.     I would also suggest signing up on couchsurfing.com. You don't have to surf and you don't have to offer a couch, but you could join the couchsurfing events in Copenhagen. There are some new events weekly. For example, the 21st there's a picnic in Christiania. The 23rd they do their weekly meeting at a café. Everyone invited!    At 17.00 today there will be a theatre performance outside by Rundetårn (The Round Tower) by a troupe that two years ago managed to get invited to North Korea to play exactly this piece. Rundetårn is only a street away from Strøget.    I would help you with the social part myself, but I will be leaving for the summer in just two weeks."

If you crave pancakes with maple syrup, can't go wrong with Next Door Cafe.  This is supposed to be neat too but haven't been  Hirschsprung has one of the best collections of Danish art  I have an exam tomorrow but I'm free for a bit after, PM me if you're bored and want to hang out or whatever!

copenhagen,3a1yni,soadfan08,6,Tue Jun 16 16:30:01 2015 UTC,"A very nice route is to follow Østerbrogade which becomes Strandvejen along the coast northwards from the centre of Copenhagen, until you reach Dyrehavsbakken where you can theninlands, and go back through the woods (or take the s-train).  Another nice route is to go south through Kalvebod fælled until you reach the south coast of Amager, then follow the coast Eastwards up til Dragør, and then back towards Copenhagen.   A third nice route is to go to Frederikssund or Frederiksværft with the s-train, and then go south along Roskilde Fjord to Roskilde. This one is a lot longer than the other two, which take half a day in a low tempo. This one probably takes a day."
copenhagen,3a1yni,thetarget3,2,Tue Jun 16 17:26:06 2015 UTC,Good post!  Here's some info on the fjord path: http://www.visitfrederikssund.dk/ln-int/north-sealand/activities/fjord-path-fjordstien  If you google cykel kalvebod fælled you'll find a lot of maps and pics of the trip around Amager. It's a great route close to the city centre but very much off the beaten path
copenhagen,3a2og4,ShixX4321,3,Tue Jun 16 19:26:26 2015 UTC,"1) Don't listen to the ones talking about Bellevue and Amager Strand. There are very nice beaches much closer to Ishøj. Ishøj is very close to the bay (Køge Bugt) which has some very nice beaches. From Ishøj and south towards Køge is Standparken (http://www.strandparken-kbh.dk/). It is more or less on your doorstep if you are in Ishøj.  3) Public transportation is wide spread and you can get to almost everywhere using it. Cabs are expensive relative to public transport (€6 starter minimum and €2/km).  4) Taking the S-Trains from Ishøj to Copenhagen is 60,- (€8) per person and takes about 20 min. There are ways of getting cheaper tickets like multiride tickets or one-day tickets. Ask at the kiosk at Ishøj Station. They handle ticket sales.  5) In Copenhagen go to Tivoli. Admittance is 99,- (€13) and a multiride ticket for all rides is 209,- (€28). If you are a group of 15 or more your can get group discounts which is around 10% off. Check out the website for more info. They actually have a marching band. You can see a schedule of their performances here. If you go to the 16:30 performance on the 28th of June you could stay the evening and have fun on the different rides. I might even suggest contacting Tivoli and asking if you can come visit the marching band ""behind the scenes"".  Good luck in the World Championship."

copenhagen,3a2og4,syntiro,2,Tue Jun 16 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"1 - It's ~45min from where you're staying, but Bellevue Strand is an awesome beach. It's also near Bakken, an amusement park and a Dyrehave, which is pleasant to walk around/explore. You could easily make a day trip out of going here, which I would highly recommend.   4 - Not sure of current prices, but rejseplanen.dk is a good website to try to figure it out before you go. Here's an example route that you might take a few times if you go in and out of the city to/from Ishøj.   5 - Rent a kayak/canoe and explore the canals of Copenhagen! Spend a day at Frederiksborg and its gardens. Very beautiful castle and a good way to spend a relaxing day."

Although after some further reading, it seems like they're phasing out Klippekorter (10 tickets at once), so that may not be viable. Rejseplanen is still good for planning your routes to places though (which trains to take, what time they leave, etc).  Definitely check out the DOT Mobilbilletter phone app another user mentioned.

They can be bought from these machines at all metro stations, including the airport: http://www.rejsekort.dk/brug-rejsekort/saadan-bruger-du-rejsekort/~/media/Rejsekort/Galleri/Brug-rejsekort/rejsekortautomat-brug.ashx.   You pay 80 DKK for the card, and then you can charge it with credit at the stands. It's the cheapest way to travel, and the instructions should be available in English everywhere."
copenhagen,3a2og4,Polrek,2,Wed Jun 17 07:37:47 2015 UTC,"1) Like the other posters wrote; Amager Strand and Bellevue Strand are your best bets  2) There are a bunch. Check out http://www.vandpibecafe.dk/københavn for areas you're planning to be in. They're basically all the same.  3) Forget taxis. Use Uber.  4) I'm assuming at least one of you will have an iPhone or Android.  Get this app: https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/dot-mobilbilletter-hovedstaden/id494862453?mt=8  And buy a ""klippekort"". It's much cheaper than buying tickets.  5) Go to tivoli, get smashed on moderately priced beer and go on rollercoasters. Only amusement park in the world where the employees dont give a shit if you're drunk."

copenhagen,3a0iql,redishbob,2,Tue Jun 16 07:34:08 2015 UTC,"The 6 murals are worth the walk and you will cover quite a bit of the Vesterbro area if you decide to see them all. The addresses and names of the murals and the artists were printed in last week's newspaper. Grab a coffee from Enghave Kaffe  on Enghave Plads and cruise through the areas many side streets. Make sure to check out the Bobnoon studio on Mattæusgade 21 if you go searching for murals.   If you decide to venture beyond Vesterbro then you should walk along the lakes and through Nørrebro to the Superkilen. I made a basic guide for you that maps a journey from the start of the lakes in Vesterbro. You should grab some porridge or risotto from Grød on Jægersborggade and a craft beer from Mikkeler on Stefansgade.   This will take most of a day. Enjoy your stay and better luck on the Danish weather lottery next time, you might get lucky and visit during one of the five days of summer.  Edit: addresses of the murals, not the artists"

copenhagen,39wyv0,habitual_viking,2,Mon Jun 15 20:42:34 2015 UTC,"TIL...  So when they were burning our flags during the cartoon ""crisis"", they were actually just adhering to danish tradition?"
