Funnypics,3bcogy,drgnbyt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:33:11 2015 UTC,That is pretty important if you need to avoid gluten; you don't want it on the dishes and pots that touch the food.
Funnypics,3bcogy,Drchrisco,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:40:17 2015 UTC,"While there is a small percentage of the population that is sensitive to gluten, I'd say that, in this case, it's simply a marketing ploy.  If one does such a poor job of washing and RINSING one's dinner and cookware that soap residue remains, I expect one is going to have other, more immediate problems.  Further, those who do have gluten sensitivity would surely already know exactly what food (containing wheat, barley, or rye, for example) or related products to avoid.  The additional ""Gluten Free"" label should be unnecessary for them; I think it's mostly there to capitalize on the ignorance and fear of the general public, who've heard something vague from somewhere that gluten is bad.   I mean, how many others soaps (excluding those new age specialty beauty/bath products, I suppose) are normally made from, or contain, grain?   I've seen that gluten-free labeling on many products that simply cannot contain gluten.  I mean, how else does one hype products like organic, free-range, gluten-free sea salt?"

I personally do not find any value at all in any of the religions. I seek truth in what is actual rather than what is man-made, and all religions are man-made.  Nevertheless when I come across a person who cares about some religion, I don't feel compelled to attack them or attempt to discredit their ideas just to assert my superiority. Why should I?

You, being a HATER, hate an entire group of people you do not even know. You HATE their rulers and so you HATE them too. You probably wish you could KILL THEM ALL! Kill the men, the women and the babies too. THAT IS WHAT HATERS LOVE, isn't it?  Violence, whether it is physical or psychological, is your only response. Perhaps you are not capable of greater discernment and maybe you lack wisdom and education.  Your ignorance and your un-thinking hatred, lust for conflict and desire to kill is THE REAL PROBLEM whether you're spewing your hate in English, Arabic or any other language.

You are aware that comedians frequently joke about misfortune, tragic events, and other sensitive subjects right?    Some extreme examples: Gilbert Gotfried joked about a plane stopping off in the Empire state building in 2001. Chris Rock makes countless racial jokes. We hear God knows how many jokes that make fun of LGBT. Countless people made jokes about Paul Walkers death. These are all jokes that I would agree are not ""even remotely funny"", yet I've seen enough Comedy central and HBO specials to know that people laugh at them.  So.... . I fail to see how trying to make a joke about a scenario where a person actually walked away would be considered bad taste. this guy reportedly was uninjured aside from a few bumps and scrapes. So ya, I don't see this as bad taste.  This is making fun of a once in a lifetime miracle. This is no different than making a joke out of beating cancer or any other near miss in life.
