PlantedTank,3e4k8i,munkyz,3,Tue Jul 21 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"Commonly bought for aesthetics. Plants and livestock need to rest periodically. As long as you're using a low intensity light, there won't be any negative effects on either."

PlantedTank,3e3sn3,Drummer2427,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:19 2015 UTC,Are you sure it's aquatic? Has there been a recent water increase that flooded this area it was found? That's all that would worry me. If you take any don't throw it back in the wild though if it isn't working out.
PlantedTank,3e4bb8,Veritasgear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:11 2015 UTC,So you're looking for specific aquarium plants that will also grow outside the aquarium?  Most stem plants will do well if you start them off short and in high humidity. Same with mosses.

Hopefully I can snag a few more medium sized pieces
PlantedTank,3e19k5,dr_rentschler,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"Well that's truly beautiful. I'm jealous for your design talent, the knowledge to raise the plants right and also for the sheer tank size allowing you to have multiple swarms in it as well as some nice big fish. That's gotta be my new favourite reddit tank. Are you using the pink light for aesthetic reason only?"
PlantedTank,3e19k5,Lord_Abort,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"The light is actually a combination of Red, Green, Blue and Coolwhite LED's.  Its hard to photograph the colour well it and often looks more red than it really appears.  Depending on the time of Day (Sunrise, sunset, cloud simulation or storms) the lights will appear to be totally different colours.  The Red, Green, Blue and White LED's are all different channels and can be dimmed seperately. This lets me do some pretty funky sunrise and sunset effects that will give the tank a much more reddish glow before ramping up to full white for high noon."

PlantedTank,3e19k5,RiddleRiddle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:34 2015 UTC,"If the leaves are more green than red, it usually means they aren't getting enough light.

PlantedTank,3e2ise,Advanced_Basic,2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:35 2015 UTC,The substrate doesn't look like it has any nutrients. You might be better with a specific plant substrate such as eco complete or ada aquasoil. Alternatively you can add root tabs under the gravel but I'm not sure how effective that is.
PlantedTank,3e2ise,Samuraisheep,2,Tue Jul 21 13:40:47 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if all like, gravel and stuff is just referred to as substrate. I guess not though... I guess it'd be hard for a carpetting plant to grow across something so coarse. Would I use the eco complete, et c, instead of the gravel?"
PlantedTank,3e2ise,Ka0tiK,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:48 2015 UTC,"Gravel is considered a type of substrate. Any surface medium at the base is generally referred to as substrate.   Carpeting plants do have issues rooting properly in coarser substrates due to the finer roots. Consequently they will uproot fairly easily until this root base is established.   Eco-Complete sized grains will work, but the best rooting substrates are typically your sands (pool filter, black diamond, etc.)"
PlantedTank,3e2ise,blazingbeauty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:45 2015 UTC,"I've been told that sands can ruin the motors in filters. I'm not going to be doing full water changes.

PlantedTank,3e2ise,Samuraisheep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:35 2015 UTC,I have sand in 3 tanks so far and haven't had any problems with the filters.    If you get regular aquarium sand I'd recommend some root tabs at least.

PlantedTank,3e2ise,Samuraisheep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"I should clarify that carpeting plants WILL eventually grow into coarser substrates, it just typically takes longer to establish a good root system. Your ADA soil will be fine (better than most) due to ADAs' high CEC and fertilized elements in the substrate bed.   Most carpets can do ok in low-techs, but you may seem them struggle for a while. Most carpeting varieties seem to be more CO2 dependent than most (especially HC). They can grow in low tech, but your mileage will vary based on your lighting, your use (or non-use) of liquid CO2, etc."

PlantedTank,3e149r,raowr,4,Tue Jul 21 03:45:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, so your algae got out of hand because you have a powerful light, CO2 and no nutrients. You needed to have your fertilizers ready the first day to start dosing EI. Adding the fertilizers make things better almost always, however, if your plants are choked out it may be different. Essentially your Co2 and light pushed your plants to suck up every single nutrient and deplete a lot of them, this is why when high light and CO2 are used fertilizers are necessary.   Anyway, now that you have ferts you can start fixing the problem but its difficult because the algae has become very established in the tank. First things first, for EI to work YOU MUST have 30ppm (not 15-20) of CO2 or higher even. This is explicitly stated by Tom Barr about EI. EI's purpose is to 'eliminate' all limiting factors (light, CO2, ferts) by generally overdosing and keeping the other two variables constant (although adjusting CO2 concentrations, generally higher, is the go-to trouble shooting method in EI).   I would start your dosing regiment for EI and get to work on physical removal as often as you can stand it. Gravel vacuuming may pick up some algae, using a turkey baster or long pipette syringe may remove it, but its important you beat the algae back as it has such a strong hold on your tank adjusting your fertilizers alone may not yield quick enough results.   Your ottos will and are doing massive damage to the diatoms but its probably growing at such a ridiculous rate it doesn't matter. Nerites will eat it too, but adding livestock never solves the root cause which is bad. So I wouldn't even worry about that at all, as covering up your issue with algae eaters is just admittance that you have no idea how to balance your aquarium, and most of the time will not even prevail over it.   Start dosing Start physical removal Do 50% WC weekly (EI recommended)   On a side note, I had brown algae just like you and ian and I literally killed 99% of it in a few days when I more than halved the amount of sulphates I was dosing (MgSo4, K2So4). I changed no other variables except K and Mg but there is little evidence I can find to suggest either of those have a huge effect on diatoms, plus I had no choice but to lower K and Mg to lower my sulphates. Its possible that your tap water is high in sulphates (call your water provider and ask for ppm). If this is the case I would be wary as EI will be dosing the aforementioned compounds. However, perhaps you don't have too many sulphates. Perhaps your plants have consumed literally every nutrient and have left sulphates at a high level (comparatively/ratio wise) which brings us right back to the bullet point list!"
PlantedTank,3e149r,Soidfuf,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:41 2015 UTC,"Couple things. Run the ray 2 for an hour or so less, until everything is up and running. Start the ferts, but be careful because if there isn't enough plant matter to begin with algae will explode, which is why it's important to keep the light under raps. Brown algae is prevalent in new tanks, it will go away in a couple months or sooner, use a toothbrush to remove it. Try some amano shrimp and Otto's too. Other than that, patience. Make sure you're co2 is 15-20 ppm to keep up with high tech. Good luck!"

You can find the nozzle pretty cheap, either online or at home depot, so it won't cost you much to find out.   My initial thought is, it won't work. Even if it is high gph it may not mean it will give you the pressure you're looking for. Also, you could end up gunking up the nozzle with impurities in the tank water.  Most palus that take water from the lower section usual do drip walls. This keeps the lines from clogging I think.   Give it a try though! I'd love to see it in action if it works out. It should cost less then 10 bucks to get the nozzle and tubing for it. It's worth a shot."

They say on their website that when using it to start up an aquarium, one should put a plate on the substrate to prevent the water from disturbing the substrate too much, as it will make the water cloudy due to the nutrients etc. being released.  Wouldn't it be a better idea to use regular gravel (no nutrients) and then get some root tabs or similar to slide into the gravel? This way you won't release all (or the majority) of the nutrients into the water column, but keep them in the substrate/gravel where you want them for your plants to absorb them."

Use more convergent than divergent lines, but definitely use both. For your plants, use shorties up front, tall guys in the back, for obvious reasons. My advice, Google aesthetic design, and read a bit about things like scale, lines, ratios, focal points, ect.   My degree in art is failing me, as I realize I am unable to teach what I have learned without showing you specifically. This is an art, and a science. It is an organic process.

PlantedTank,3dz09j,no_pers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"The only way I know of would be to take all of our biologics out of the tank, put them in a bucket with the old tank water so they don't die off, save a ton of water to avoid a long cycle, drain the tank it, fill it with tap water, turn on a pump for water movement, and just keep the chlorine levels up for a few weeks over the pieces that it grows on.  If you want to help do this faster, add some aquarium salt, bring the salinity up to 50ppm or higher, the moss balls can live in brackish water but once the salinity goes in to the salt water range or higher, then it starts to die off.  Drain the tank, rinse it out to get all of the salt out, refill it with the amount of water you need and dump the rest in from the buckets.  Let it cycle again and go at it.    This might be a bit extreme and someone else might have a better idea.  Pictures couldn't hurt though incase someone is able to identify the algae correctly and maybe has an answer with a fish option."

I've read journals and things along those lines where people have gotten away with one but had wished they had two. They are very nice lights that can be used on a range of aquarium, so even if you were to buy a second one you could always move them with you into bigger, or even smaller setups. That's the glorious part about kessil and radion fixtures, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a tank they don't fit on. As opposed if you buy a fixture that is X amount long, you're gonna have to work around however many inches your fixture is. Unless you plan to buy another and upgrade. Finnex makes phenomenal reasonably priced LEDs and I do own a finnex planted+ for my 20L aquarium and have a finnex 24/7 coming in the mail tomorrow. For the price of these guys you can't beat em, they're quality lights for a great price. You can see previous posts of my 20L to get an idea of what just one planted+ can grow."

Red light becomes much less efficient around 18' or something like that. They'll also need nutrient rich substrate to thrive. I would reccomend you to take out the baby dwarf tear and grow it submerged so it would grow faster and you can experiment with it inside your tank without losing it all. Best of Luck."
PlantedTank,3dvs1l,BigDeady,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:01:05 2015 UTC,"I remember someone from Finnex actually posting screens of apogee PAR readings, and in a bare tank with no water, a 30"" Planted+ had 77 PAR at 12"" depth, and 32 at 24"". I think apogee (?) PAR readings don't take red lights in effect, but I just guestimated that even at 18"", my substrate should at least get around 50 PAR which is barely enough to qualify as high lighting.  I have API root tabs planted in from several weeks ago in my substrate, and I plan on replenishing them several weeks from now too.  My tank is supposed to be a medium light, and I don't mind the HC carpeting slowly as long as it actually self propagates and doesn't melt. Speaking of which, I'm slightly worried about my Cyperus helferi darkening at the tips... They're also from Petsmart, and I know they have a lengthy acclimating period, but I'm still afraid they might die on me. Speaking of Petsmart tube plants, never buy any microsorium pteroptus AKA Narrow Leaf Java Fern from Topfin. I pulled one out of the substrate after planting to look for the rhizome, and it was a bunch of leafs tied together with black string at the base. Guess I'm buying real Java Fern from the same LFS later"

I kept this set-up for at least 4 months-- no dosing, no excel or injected co2, just dirt. Really depends on how tall your tank is and how heavy your plant load is. I was running it on a heavily planted 46gal bowfront which is pretty tall (22""). I've since replaced it with a Planted+ 24/7. I highly recommend the 24/7-- I've even got one on my 75gal Oscar tank.   edit: With that said I think you would be fine with a planted+ and may even need more light depending on your plant load/species if you have a standard 24"" tall 60gal."

Fert tabs in the substrate seems like the easiest way to start and will suffice. Photoperiod is just limited by how much algea you get, light is the biggest factor when tweaking a lowtech I think.

PlantedTank,3dvlw4,Bubblegumdoge,3,Sun Jul 19 22:11:56 2015 UTC,I might be able to help you with the snail and gravel issue.  The snails you might need to drip acclimate them because they are sensitive to changes in water. You can also buy algae wafers if you think that they are not getting enough food.  https://youtu.be/Yl1uxBp8XjE  For the gravel you can buy root tabs and place them around the plants under the gravel. You can also douse with florish for fertilizer and florish excel for a carbon supplement.  http://www.bigalspets.com/root-tabs-10-pk.html?utm_source=Google+Products&utm_campaign=Google+Products+Datafeed&utm_medium=Comparison+Shopping&gclid=CjwKEAjwla2tBRDY7YK9uKXe8R8SJAAhG6LG_U9g3M9lpky9T7dAegXSZPY6oZ58WMlU8DuZ3ss-rRoCiMLw_wcB  The java fern might have rotted because it needs to have the rhizome exposed to the surface. https://youtu.be/ge80jZwgO10

Usually they have 4 or 5 apongeton, a dwarf lily (the big one) and a dwarf onion (the one on the far left). A couple things to be aware of: the onion plant is sometimes eaten by fish that wouldn't otherwise eat plants. If that happens, take it out ASAP. If you let the onion bulb start rotting, it smells like rotting onion in poop soup. Just awful.  The other bulbs will be nice and full for a while, and then go dormant. They do sometimes come back after a while, but usually never that nice and full. It helps if you cut off any flowers before they bloom. Some of the varieties are nice and leafy, almost like a sword. Others are really tall and spindly. Those, along with the lily, can block a lot of light in your tank. Usually if you trim tall leaves and lily pads early, the plant will send off more bushy and lower growing leaves."

PlantedTank,3dvcr6,vincredible,2,Sun Jul 19 20:54:34 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I have a 90 gallon freshwater with similar dimensions (48"" long x 18"" wide x 25"" deep), and have also been scouring the internet, doing research and a bit of shopping. I'm an avid gardener outside of aquarium keeping, and my goal has always been to have a lush planted environment in my tank.  It can be baffling trying to compare different light models, because so many different factors come into play.    I found this article to be really helpful, although it is a bit of an exhausting read.  The TL;DR if my understanding is correct, is that you want:   High lumens per watt (overall efficiency) Photosynthetically useful radiation - basically, you want to ensure that the wavelengths of light that your plants need to thrive are present - and that they are able to penetrate through the depths of your tank.   I have no personal experience with LED aquarium lighting but it definitely appears to be where the industry is heading, at least according to the above article.  Consider their benefits:   Efficiency (more lumens per watt, less heat) Reliability (~50,000 hour LED lifespan) More specific light wavelength emission compared to fluorescents (if my understanding is correct).  They don't waste energy emitting radiation that is useless to plants, i.e. green spectrum light, which is not absorbed, but reflected. Small form factor (meaning you can potentially use several units at one time)   In order to get a high level of lighting in my own tank, it seemed to be cheaper to use T5 HO fluorescents, so I bought two of these.  I'm pretty sure that they'll work well (I'll ultimately find out soon enough).  It would have been nice to go with some sort of metal halide fixture, as they are extraordinarily bright and provide plenty of photosynthetically useful wavelengths at depth, but as of now, I don't have the means to hang a fixture and wouldn't want to deal with the heat.    One thing to consider is the amount of ambient light that a tank gets outside of the artificial lighting you'll provide.  I once would have believed that my crappy T12 aquarium hood was doing the trick, but looking back, my tank had been receiving a lot of very bright light from a nearby window.  A tank's ambient surroundings might play a part in conflicting reviews on similar fixtures.  Anyway, congratulations on diving into a new hobby!  Hope you get the information you need to make a good choice for your tank!"
PlantedTank,3dvcr6,forevertuesday,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:43:08 2015 UTC,2 ray2s or a ray 2 and a planted plus for slightly lower light. I think a quad t5 would be best for that because you can add or take away bulbs as needed and use different spectrums. Good luck!

PlantedTank,3dvweh,Mirarii,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"First off, it's not so bad! You should see some of the blooms I've dealt with in the past. Secondly, I would lower light period to 5-6 hours until you get the plants established enough to balance your nutrient levels. Start with weekly or bi weekly large water changes. You could also cut back on flourish, to see if your nutrient levels are too high.   If you're feeling extreme, try the one two punch method. You can find it on plantedtank.net . It's essentially using h202 and then excel to kill the algae. It's worked for me in the past. Good luck!   Edit: after looking at the photos again, you have a shallow tank and a great light, I'd say lighting is too high to keep this tank low tech. I'd get some co2 going."
PlantedTank,3dvweh,average_AZN,2,Mon Jul 20 02:43:58 2015 UTC,"So I went overkill with the light... I knew it. Are those fluval CO2 kits any good?

PlantedTank,3dtbi0,trouty,3,Sun Jul 19 06:37:36 2015 UTC,"It's going pretty good.   Having never worked with HC cuba, s. repens, or blyxa before, I wasn't sure how things were going to grow in and at what pace. I've had to keep the hairgrass at bay because it was very quickly growing over/through my attempted HC carpet. I sat down on two occasions and hand-plucked a small clump of grass leaves out, and it's really helped the tears take over. I'm thinking at this rate, it will be filled in this time next month.  The S. Repens has been slow to spread, but damn they've grown taller than I was expecting. Not to mention the blyxa japonica, which is a THICK bush in the background.  I've had very few algae issues, thankfully. I'm getting a tiny bit of green hair algae, but I think turning down the white on the planted+ 24/7 a couple clicks has halted its growth.   The 10 gallon in the second picture is a rescape when a potting soil topped with sand walstad-esque experiment went horribly wrong. Got all of the surviving plants out, added a few more anubius, and went back to good ol' ecocomplete with osmocote root tabs. It is still a cory+beta hang out, for all intents and purposes."

PlantedTank,3duvfp,lostmojo,2,Sun Jul 19 18:28:05 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have a pretty sound grasp on everything, really it just comes down to how well you scape with your sand and rocks and place your plants. That's the main factor to a great looking tank.   You have a lot of reds going on here which looks great but they like lotsa nutrients, you mentioned you were planning on dosing iron which is good, maybe think about getting the pps pro ferts from GLA, only 30$ and lasts forever.   Don't worry about plant size as a factor of whether you should get it or not, regular trimming will yield great results, especially with the tiger lotus. I have two separate plants in my tank, one that only sends up huge lily pads to the surface with no base leaves and another with tiny leaves along the ground, both happened from selective trimming.   I would do what you have In mind here and tweek the plants it as you go, just make sure you like your hard scape a lot."

As for pruning, I am nervous about that part, pruning a coral is very different from a plant.  Do you know of any good videos that talk about this process and demonstrate the process on different types of plants?"
PlantedTank,3duvfp,RiddleRiddle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:55:07 2015 UTC,"Good! It pays to be picky.   Sorry I don't know any trimming videos, but any plant profile page online should tell you how the plant will propagate and how to trim.  Personally I keep a note book with my plants listed with info on keeping them healthy, it's really helpful for me to have info on hand by the tank anytime I need sone reference since it's hard for me to remember all the small factoids.   I've never kept soft corals but yes it's very different (really miss my coral tank), mainly because plants are so much more resilient than coral. But it sounds like your the type to do your research so in sure you have nothing to worry about :)   But hurry up and put plants In there so we can have pics!"

PlantedTank,3du50v,beanajacoba,3,Sun Jul 19 14:23:52 2015 UTC,"I post this a lot, but I personally don't believe in spending $$ on substrate because I have found absolutely nothing whose price reflects its worth compared to other much cheaper options.  Between flourite and eco-complete, I don't care for either one. I'd take 20/40 grade blasting sand with root tabs over both any day of the week.  As for dirted tanks, dirt is just too messy for someone like me who's always moving plants around and rescaping. I wouldn't recommend it personally, though I know others who swear by it. Again, I prefer blasting sand because of how easy it is to rescape and move things around whenever I want. Plants root extremely well in it, and if your tank is low tech it doesn't need much more than root tabs.  Blasting sand from tractor supply is $8/50#. I'd recommend at least 3-4 bags to create a 2"" deep substrate."

Amazon sells red and black eco-complete for $24.99 and $22.99 per 20lb bag respectively. There's also Activ-flora which looks much more like gravel and comes in many more variaties. Price ranges from the same as eco-complete to ~$60 per 16-20lb bag on Amazon depending on the variety.  As for depth of substrate I wouldn't go deeper than  2"". No matter the substrate I recommend adding a couple Malaysian Trumpet Snails as they'll burrow through and aerate the substrate leading to healthier plants. They'll also prevent harmful gasses from building up in the substrate and harming the fish/plants.  The absolute cheapest option would be to use pool filter sand or play sand and add root tabs (pre-purchased or DIY) and/or liquid ferts."

PlantedTank,3dsawb,PrototypeNM1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:53:11 2015 UTC,I have no idea. I just set it up yesterday. I figure close to 8-10 weeks. There is a lot of liquid in that canister.
PlantedTank,3dt5hh,jenabell,2,Sun Jul 19 05:13:42 2015 UTC,OK so anyone that runs the 24/7 mode can tell me what they set their co2 schedule to?

PlantedTank,3dt5hh,trouty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:29:38 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks for your input. That chart is great.
PlantedTank,3dt5hh,trouty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:02:46 2015 UTC,"Assuming you've got your photoperiod figured out, a good practice is to run the co2 on a separate timer, turning it on 15-30 mins prior and turn off 15-30 mins before the light shuts off.   If you have a drop checker, you'll see that doing this keeps your co2 ppm at the ideal levels only when the light is on. It generally takes the 15-30mins to get it up to 30ppm, and 15-30mins should be the amount of time the remaining by co2 can be absorbed before the light goes out.   Definitely not completely necessary, but it can help, especially in larger planted tanks."
PlantedTank,3dt5hh,trouty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:52:51 2015 UTC,"Ya I understand that. I wasn't exactly clear in my question I guess. I will be now using the planted+ 24/7. So the lights will be on 24/7. It just mimics the natural day/night light schedule. The very brightest portion is only like 5 hours. I would assume I need to leave it on for more than the 5 hours. So I was wondering from anyone that had the PP24/7, how do you have your co2 schedule set? And is it working for them?"
PlantedTank,3dt5hh,trouty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:39:11 2015 UTC,"I use the 24/7 too, and I guess it comes down to your tank size. I have a 60F (just made a post about it), and can tell you firsthand the 24/7 cycle on the light won't cut it in that shallow of a tank. It would be too much light for too long. If you end up being successful with just running it ""..24/7"" (which I haven't heard of anyone doing with good luck), you'll wanna have 30ppm as long as you have substantial light on your plants probably between the 9am-6pm settings on the finnex. Otherwise you run into inconsistent co2 concentrations = algae issues (most likely GHA/BBA)."
PlantedTank,3dt5hh,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:49:45 2015 UTC,"So if I am understanding you, you run the light from 9-6 on max then leave it off? Wouldnt that be more light than in the 24/7 mode? At least in intensity. And did you move from the planted+ with that tank? I have seen a lot of successful people with claiming to have run in 24/7 mode. Maybe not in the shallow of a tank that you have. Also I don't have a c02 meter. Never really saw a need for one to be honest.   Honestly I guess I will just leave it on a few hours prior to the 5 hr max period, and a few hours after it. Then adjust from there."

Do you actually have a plan for this co2? Co2 means an increase in maintenance time along with balance issues that you may not have time for as a graduate assistant. Co2 also isn't necessary unless you're trying to achieve a high-maintenance carpet like HC. Excel/glutaraldehyde is typically more than enough. If you're only sticking to low-light, easy plants then I'd definitely recommend against pressurized co2. I'm not saying this to be discouraging, but so you really think about it. I know several people who thought they wanted co2 but ended up letting their co2 setups collect dust because it was too much for them in one way or another.  What kind of lighting do you have? That's probably one of the first things I'd upgrade if you want high-medium light plants and/or co2. I'm a huge fan of LEDs if that's something they sell."

I am in a similar situation at the moment.  I let the immersed plant growth (really funky looking leaves jagged shaped) get a few inches and then snipped the stem and replanted.  lots of plant suppliers of aquatic plants dont grow the plants under water

PlantedTank,3drzyt,Slippery_Fat_Man,2,Sat Jul 18 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"Theres a lot of factors that can go into it such as your kh, stocking, flow rate, etc. But in my experience if you don't know your kH and are not willing to test your pH morning (before the CO2 is on) and evening (right before you turn it off), then less is more. You could get away with less than 1 bps and it will make a difference in a 9g tank. Just remember if you turn it on before the lights come on to build up CO2 for the plants you can potentially kill any fish in a small tank. Also make sure to kill the CO2 a bit before the lights go out so the plants can use the remaining CO2 in the water."

I would use hot water and a gentle, but yet sturdy brush too clean, and not to damage the fibers of the wheel.  3) Depending how dirty it is; you can recycle it from scratch.

PlantedTank,3dra8w,Astilaroth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"as far as I know that's the last thing you want to do, since the filter is home to your beneficial bacteria (the bacteria culture you 'grow' when 'cycling', the ones that are part of the nitrogen cycle) and they need that flow to be able to live. They can go without flow for a bit, a power shortage won't throw your tank back to square one quickly... but as far as I know it's far from optimal to consider doing this regularly or on purpose other than shutting it down during water changes.  Some fish like a strong current (hillstream fishies), others can barely survive in it (like long finned betta's). You can also create places where the current is less strong by placing rocks or other deco in strategical places.   Another option is to muffle the flow, by either adjusting the outlet of the filter or putting something around/in-front of it. Betta tanks often have stuff like stockings or filter-cotton around the outlet to muffle the waterflow a little."

PlantedTank,3do3fa,Apocrisiary,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:06:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've been messing with this same scape for about 2 years now. Check out the stone I used and you'll see it's got a bunch of fissures in it.    I literally got a very small piece of moss from a fellow hobbyist (maybe 1""x1"" square) and stuffed it into one of the fissures.    Then I guess I just waited patiently for 2 years...     Thanks for the kind words. I will say that one of my problems is that  I always end up with too many plant species in the tank. For instance, I think this scape would look amazing with just HC, or maybe 3 different species at most... but I always end up thinking: ""Wow that's a cool plant. I should totally throw some AR Mini in the back corner!""     I get bored waiting for things to fill in.

PlantedTank,3do3fa,uefalona,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"I enjoy a diverse range of plants. I can understand what you mean though, HC would definitely make the stone stand out.

How did that go. Any air in the soil.   Swords and crypts look good. Needs more plants. I'd propagate those long stems reaching the top of the water.

Most fungus are pretty specific about what they feed on and a lot of them like digesting wood (very slowly). I'd say it's nothing to worry about.   Was this piece of driftwood recently submerged? If so, it'll probably die off on its own."

PlantedTank,3dmyy7,Astilaroth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"Ho hum. With a 10 gal that isn't densely planted, I'd be careful adding both gobies and shrimps in combination with a betta. The shrimp will have few hiding places and if your betta likes them a little too much it might become  massacre. Both the gobies and the betta are (or at least can be quite) territorial, so that combination in 10g isn't something I'd recommend. Maybe if you plant it very densely so they can have their own corners without a line of sight... but still.   Hop over to /r/bettafish, it would be an incredible shame if you put nice beasties together only to see them get stressed or fight. Or dead.   Love the wood/rock combination btw, pretty tank!"
PlantedTank,3dmyy7,Astilaroth,2,Fri Jul 17 19:55:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your concerns. I understand the betta and peacocks might not work but before I add the peacocks I plan to add more plants for sure. My lfs owner said they should be fine since I'm getting two female peacocks, but if there's a problem i'll definitely take the peacocks back, as i'd hate to have them stressed. There's a decent cave under the driftwood though, and so far my male is completely peaceful but curious. But yeah I'm hoping for a lot more plants before I add the peacocks!  Thank you!"
PlantedTank,3dmyy7,Astilaroth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:27:21 2015 UTC,"They sure would be awesome. Maybe you can agree with your lfs to take them back if there are signs of agression, so you have a back up plan?  I'm wondering how the lfs thinks it matters that they are both female btw, since Betta's even don't tolerate female betta's. The best combo with betta's are usually fish that they don't see as a threat in any way and that are peaceful themselves.  Any thoughts yet on what other plants to get? Maybe check out Vallisneria, they're sturdy , don't need a lot and grow quite nicely."

PlantedTank,3dnaid,Juddston,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:45:05 2015 UTC,The little beach was originally supposed to make the tank look larger if that makes any sense.

PlantedTank,3do5tt,Nataliehvr7352,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:33:47 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat as you... planning a 29 gallon with a finnex light (30"" planted+ 24/7 for me).   Everything I read seems to point to the light hitting medium range at around 16"" of depth (I'm planning on about 2"" of substrate reducing the tanks 18"" depth to 16""). It sounds like the Planted + that you have will be very similar amount of light to the 24/7 model that I have.  I'm leaning towards a Monte Carlo carpet (http://tropica.com/en/plants/plantdetails/Micranthemum'MonteCarlo'(025TC)/4442) since its light requirements are not as intense as Dwarf Baby Tears. However this will require pressurized Co2 which I am definitely planning and have already built a regulator for. I'm not 100% positive that I will have enough light to carpet Monte Carlo but I'm planning to give the old college try.  If you are looking for a cheap regulator I would recommend the Aquatek mini from amazon and a couple paintball tanks so you don't have to make trips to refill too frequently. I don't think you will be as happy running your tank without Co2 - in my experience with a different tank and medium/high lighting is that a lack of consistent Co2 allows algae to get a foothold far too easily.  Best of luck - I think you will be fine with your light but would recommend pressurized Co2 as I think it will be a more rewarding experience.  As far as substrate, I'm a big believer in ADA AquaSoil and I've already purchased some for this tank.  Edit: wording/spelling, details on substrate"
PlantedTank,3do5tt,ShredTheGnarwhal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:59:28 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! That is actually the co2 setup I have been looking at! And I have herd a lot of great reviews for the Aquasoil amazonia i am just a little hesitant to spend so much for it. How many bags did you get? And you are enjoying your 24/7 model? I almost got that instead but amazon said it would ship sometime between August and October as compared to the planted+ which I got in three days.  Thank you so much you have been so helpful!
PlantedTank,3do5tt,ShredTheGnarwhal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:58:22 2015 UTC,"I actually can't personally vouch for the AquaTek mini but I've heard that they have solid customer service if you do happen to encounter errors. I built a regulator from a dual stage unit I bought on eBay... it was definitely challenging and the regulator is huge compared to the mini.  I bought two 9L bags of amazonia from adana-usa.com. Shipping to Arizona from San Francisco wasn't to bad. When you do the math you end up paying a very similar price for EcoComplete for the same amount of volume. I'm shooting for about 3 inches of depth, based on my math each 9L bag should give you about 1.5 inches of depth in a 29 gallon.  I don't have the 24/7 running on an active tank (yet) but the 24 hour period really looks beautiful over an empty tank! I've been planning this tank for a while now and pre-ordered the 24/7 so I've been itching to start using it for over a month now!  Edit: I should clarify - an average of 3 inches of substrate (4"" in the back with a slope to 2"" in the front)"
PlantedTank,3do5tt,ShredTheGnarwhal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:20:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize how much cheaper it would be there then on amazon. I may try that later on when I have more money. I live near St. Louis and the price of shipping combined with the price of the two bags adds up to a little more then $100. Eco complete is far cheaper especially because I can go to the store and pick some up. Plus i still need to get a filter, plants, and eventually fish... this is not a cheap hobby!"
PlantedTank,3do5tt,Z-Ninja,2,Sat Jul 18 22:14:20 2015 UTC,"Its definitely not a cheap hobby :). Based on plantedtank.net's substrate calculator you would need 3 x 20 lb bags of eco complete for a 3"" depth in a 29... at $23 bucks a pop thats still 70 bucks which is ~10 bucks more expensive than AquaSoil before shipping. Shipping for me resulted in spending an extra ~$15 for AquaSoil over Eco Complete which is where I'm coming from.  I know you mentioned you're thinking potting soil with an Eco Complete cap which will definitely be less expensive so if cost is a factor thats probably the best route. I had a lot of fun experimenting with potting soil so I would encourage you on going that route as it is definitely a viable option!  Reference: http://www.plantedtank.net/substratecalculator.html"

Is the aquatek mini reliable? What else would I need with it? If I can get a CO2 set up for around $200 that won't end up killing my fish I'd love to do it."
PlantedTank,3dnb2x,h0l0n,5,Fri Jul 17 17:41:29 2015 UTC,"Time and time again I suggest Finnex LEDs. The base model Fugeray would be enough for your tank. They mount to the tank securely with plastic screws, have good enough construction that splashing water won't ruin anything, and above all are excellent lights that will last damn near forever for a reasonable price.  If you want to move up from the world of CFLs, they are definitely what I recommend."

PlantedTank,3dnav3,GothicGroucho,2,Fri Jul 17 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"Almost certainly the crypt was grown emmersed, that is out of the water. The original leaves usually differ vastly from the once that grow once you've got the plant immersed. Completely expected, no need to make a change if it's growing nicely. Yes! That's how crypts propagate, and it's a very good sign that the plant is healthy. You can snip them away at the rhizome and plant elsewhere in the tank if you're worried about crowding."
PlantedTank,3dnav3,cosalich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:52:00 2015 UTC,"It could be what the other guy said that the green leaves were emmersed form, but I've kept lutea in the past - it grew green for me under the t5 bulbs but once I switched to the planted+, which I think is a lot brighter than the old t5s, it became very dark green/brown and became pretty massive. So it could just be the light."
PlantedTank,3dnav3,nlevend,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:20:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, as others have said, those are both good signs. You can, when needed, gently separate the baby crypts at the rhizome. I've never had to actually cut anything; frequently when I uproot a big old ball of crypt they'll just be entwined by the roots and pull apart easily, like separating plants in rock wool.  You can, as you say, leave things alone. I don't know about lutea in particular, but I don't think crypts tend to choke themselves by overcrowding and overgrowing. When it's denser than you like, or when you want to spread out to get broader growth, go ahead and gently pluck out the smaller plants.  It sounds like you'll be very happy with your crypts. They're usually delightfully cooperative plants."

You could spread your dwarf hair grass out to try and get it to carpet. It's a little harder to plant with the tank full though, IMHO.    I would probably leave your diffuser and sponge where they are at. If the co2 gets sucked up (I don't know that it will, but if it does) you won't get good diffusion. Do you need the power head? Some fish like a bit of a current. Others won't miss it.   You could always get some stem plants and toss them in there. I like ambulia and bacopa.  It gets a little bit tricky with a power head, but still manageable.    Your tank looks nice."

PlantedTank,3dmmc1,Soidfuf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:07:39 2015 UTC,You've lost 6 more fish since this post?? Algae doesn't kill fish (other than MASSIVE die-offs usually involving Cyanobacteria). There is no way your water parameters are acceptable OR there is a disease in the tank... Post your water params EXACTLY as they appear and follow the directions on the tests to the letter. Also check all your fish for visible signs of disease. The fish deaths almost definitely have nothing to do with your fertilizer dosing unless you're dosing massive amounts of iron or something which is unlikely if you're following bottle doses. So I would approach them as separate issues.
PlantedTank,3dmmc1,Soidfuf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:10:00 2015 UTC,"My parameters are as follows:  PH: 7.8  ammonia: 0  nitrite: 0  nitrate: was just the slightest tad orange, but less than the 5ppm on the test kit sheet. I would estimate 2-3ppm.   Nothing else has died since then, and I have done another water change as well(after I tested the water to get the parameters above)."

PlantedTank,3di7do,notorious_bug,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:00:00 2015 UTC,"Yes you can plant before the tank is cycled.  Good job tossing the undergravel filter.  Google fishless cycling, it might seem overwhelming at first but its pretty easy.  For example I squirt 1ml of ammonia into my 10gal tank daily and test for ammonia and nitrite to make sure I'm on track.  The fishless cycle builds up a beefy biological filter without any risk to your fish.  You will eventually want to consider an even larger tank for your goldies.  Oh yeah and they are plant destroyers so good luck, anubias and java fern are good choices for a goldfish tank."

I made that mistake when I first started)  If your previous tank was cycled, which I'm assuming it was after a year, run the new HOB filter on the old tank for a while and it will pickup the bacteria responsible for the conversion. when you've moved over to the new tank, move the old filter to the new tank and let that run for a few weeks as well. This will also help the fish transition to the new tank as it will 'feel at home' with the same 'taste and smell' of the old tank's flora. (that part was made up... it is how I understand it, please correct me if I'm wrong)  Moving the substrate over will help with the cycle too but it doesn't sound like you're keeping much of the old stuff.

PlantedTank,3di7do,spinkman,3,Thu Jul 16 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"I can say with certainty that your old tank is cycled so it will absolutely be helpful to run the new filter on the old tank and then the old filter on the new tank.  not moving the substrate over isn't the end of the world, especially if it's a really big aesthetic change like this one sounds like. if it doesn't fit with the design of the new tank feel free to omit it.  I also agree with /u/steamboatpilot about the fishless cycle but as you have the option to start the cycle with a lot of your old equipment the fish-in cycle should have a minimal impact on your fish. setup the new filter on the old tank, stir up the tank so it grabs some gunk and in a couple weeks it should be holding enough bacteria to start on the new tank.

PlantedTank,3djec2,thisisntmygwaccount,2,Thu Jul 16 19:19:36 2015 UTC,"Plants for betta tanks are typically non-CO2 low light varieties that are low maintenance and will thrive. Some examples are: anubias, java fern, and java moss. You could also use vals, banana plants, tiger lotus, and more, but remember that 5 gallons is a small amount of space.   The plants will feed off the waste produced by the betta (as well as any leftover feed that decomposes into waste). You may also want to add some snails if you haven't already to help abate algae and add to your ecosystem.   You may never need to add much fertilizer, other than a micronutrient trace fertilizer once a week. Many use seachem flourish for this or equivalent product. If your plants become deficient (holes, yellowing, etc.) use this guide to figure out what to dose.   Your filter and heater will be fine.   Please read up on cycling for future tanks  Further reading on low-tech tanks  *Note that I used most of the guides on the top of this subreddit. Consult with that for more information as well!

PlantedTank,3de5ug,stopthemeyham,2,Wed Jul 15 17:40:50 2015 UTC,"BBA is primarily caused by inconsistency with CO2. A large issue with injecting only an hour or two before the lights come on is that ambient light is likely still getting into a tank, from a window or other lights on in the room. That can be enough to start the photoperiod before injection starts. It's the problem that I was dealing with (living room windows leak light even with the blinds closed) so I started 24/7 injection and spot treated all the BBA with H2O2. It hasn't grown back, at least not yet."
PlantedTank,3de5ug,flinters17,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"I see. Interesting. Never thought about ambient light being a problem. My tank is placed next to a couple big windows, and while it's pretty dark in the tank, I can see that some of my plants don't ""close"" their leaves when the light turns off for example. I guess this is due to ambient light.  I should try to fix that actually. But I'm not sure I can afford to have co2 running 24/7 at the moment, even though it's not that expensive. I'm student-level broke at the moment :D"
PlantedTank,3de5ug,jaquatics,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer to have the co2 turn on 2 hours before the light turns on, and then have it turn off 1 hour before light turns off.

I just switched off of the 24/7 cycle and I am lowering the photo period with a timer.   I'm pretty sure the long photo period is the issue because I have attempted to adjust every other factors (dosing, co2) and nothing has stopped the issue.   I'd recommend removing as much algae manually and then do a 6 hour photo period for a week or two and see if that is the issue.   Trial and error is the name of the game."
PlantedTank,3dfsnj,Expertise90,2,Thu Jul 16 00:19:26 2015 UTC,Do you have a drop checker to verify your CO2 concentration at 30ppm+ ?   Those algae types are consistent with too high light in your scenario but your CO2 may not be dialed high enough (whether from off-gassing or low bubble count).
PlantedTank,3dfsnj,Ka0tiK,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:49:28 2015 UTC,I have a drop checker that is green when I get home at 5 pm which is when the light is at high noon.  The CO2 comes on at 2 pm.  I've been checking my nitrates the past couple of days and they seemed to be too low.  I'm thinking this with the high light is causing the issue.
PlantedTank,3dfsnj,phyzzix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:14:20 2015 UTC,Get some frogbit to decrease the light intensity and suck up extra ferts. I run the 24/7 and a Planted+ at the same time on my 29g and it works great with floating plants.
PlantedTank,3dfsnj,Soidfuf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:19:00 2015 UTC,Well green spot algae is absolutely caused by not enough phosphates. Adding more phosphate WILL get rid of it. When you added the new light you increased the rate at which your plants consumed nutrients thus dropping your phosphates (and all other nutrient levels) to a level that allows GSA and thread algae. I'm not certain what nutrient ratio causes thread algae but upping your EI dosing will probably address it. This assumes that your CO2 is at proper concentrations along with adequate water movement to distribute nutrients.
PlantedTank,3dfrcl,enlitenme,2,Wed Jul 15 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"The only issue I see is that with only moss and no rooted plants the soil might go anaerobic. Granted you do have many malaysian snails but I doubt they will dig all the way down in the 3 inches of soil. I would try to get a hold of some cheap rooted plants and place them where the soil is deepest. With the moss you have and as much duckweed as possible and some waterchanges I think you will not get an algea bloom since the soil is mineralized from earlier.  Either that or poke the substrate everyday to release any gas and make haste on getting the plants you need. Although it might not fit with your scape, a few cryptocoryne parva or petchi protruding out from between the moss in the places where the soil is deepest the would look nice in my opinion and would prevent the soil from going anaerobic."
PlantedTank,3dfrcl,PJMagicflute,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:22:34 2015 UTC,"+1 here, your deep rooters will practically eliminate the sulfur/methane gas anaerobic issues if they do well.   If the plan is to use a moss cover over the entire bottom, it may be practical to use very little soil at all (.5-1 in.), since their root systems do not require much depth."
PlantedTank,3dfrcl,Ka0tiK,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:47:39 2015 UTC,How do you plan on using the moss? It usually doesn't work just rested on the substrate. I would say go with a dry start

PlantedTank,3dfqop,aatdalt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:34:21 2015 UTC,Definetely don't add any shrimp yet. They are very sensitive and ammonia will kill them quickly.  Your cycle is progressing normally. The ammonia neutralizing bacteria is almost caught up to the amount of ammonia produced. This bacteria is producing nitrIties and the nitrIte consuming bacteria hasn't yet established itself which is why there are no nitrAtes. Keep doing large water changes. More than 60%.
PlantedTank,3dfqop,NoGimmicks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:49:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's helpful to know.
PlantedTank,3dfqop,Ka0tiK,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:54:50 2015 UTC,"Why are my Nitrite levels high but little to no Ammonia?    Your cycle is at stage 2 where nitrite>nitrate bacteria are still not caught up with the system. Keep in mind that these bacteria are the slowest to cultivate, so be patient for nitrites to hit 0 within 24-48 hours before adding stock.   I use cycling times to make any scape changes, see how plants are doing and adjust, as well as check for leaks or other issues with the tank or plumbing."

PlantedTank,3daxg5,steamboatpilot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:07:30 2015 UTC,How much trimming of the flame moss have you done? Has it been good at just going where you want it or does it try and spread sideways over the branch rather than just up?
PlantedTank,3daxg5,NoGimmicks,2,Tue Jul 14 23:28:07 2015 UTC,I wanted it to go along the branches and grow straight up so I tied it along the length of the branches. It grows almost only straight up for me. It used to be really thick though but I thinned it out since I wanted a more stringy look.

PlantedTank,3d87j5,Samuraisheep,9,Tue Jul 14 14:41:15 2015 UTC,"Patience and experimentation for the most part.   I couldn't tell you how many times I rearranged, added plants, took plants out, etc... in the 20 long. What I came to learn is to leave it alone once you get your plants placed where you're happy.   Substrate is really important, your normal aquarium gravel/sand just doesn't cut it (IMO). A laterite based substrate or an aquasoil are my go to subs (I hate dirt, it's too messy and hard to move stuff around without clouding the water).  I EI dose all of my tanks (macros and micros). 50% WC on the 7th day.  Co2 is awesome but can get expensive. There's no ""best way"" to inject it, inline diffusers, in-tank glass/plastic diffusers, reactors, atomizers, etc... they all work. They all inject co2, it all depends on what you want. Co2 can be scary but if you take it slow, it'll be fine. Everyone gasses fish at some point I'm sure, I've done it, and so have my buddies. A simple drop checker will help monitor co2 levels. I keepy DC's lime green, which has been safe for my fish so far. If you see them gasping for air at the surface add an airstone immediately and turn the co2 down a few notches. This'll gas out the co2 and add the O2 back in the water. Once your fish stop gasping, take the airstone out and carry on.  Light is very important. If you have inadequate lighting your plants could stunt, stretch, melt, etc... Aftermarket fixtures are a good way to go. Stock lighting on most aquarium kits aren't really that great. Something that's made to grow plants is best IMO.  Algae is a bitch and everyone deals with it. A balanced tank is the way to control it, algaefix and all the algae inhibitors are bullshit temporary fixes, they don't cure algae problems. A balance between light, ferts, co2, and flow are the key. Even balancing just a few of these things will help tremendously.  Hope this helps."

I've got lots of green algae on the walls of my smaller aquarium as the bigger one next to it had lights on for about 12 hours a day when I was dry starting. I tried to shield the tank but enough still got through to cause a problem.  Both tanks have their lighting on at the same time now but I don't know how to get rid of the green algae in the small tank.

PlantedTank,3db5co,KaptainH,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"When I did EI dosing in my 10 gallon a ""large"" water change was maybe 50-70% of the water. If it was in a huge tank that might be a lot but in a 10 gallon that's like one bucket full. I guess with PPS you premake the ferts into a solution so if your measurements are off or there's an abundance of one nutrient causing algae blooms I would assume you would have to change your dosing. With EI that's really easy since you're using dry ferts every time and you can always weigh each dose before putting it into the tank."

PlantedTank,3db5co,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:56:12 2015 UTC,"PPS Pro is really easy you just need to be certain your measurements are correct when you mix the solutions (macro and micro). Many sites sell kits, or you can buy all the chemicals yourself and mix as you need.   PPS Pro is a daily dose, usually 20 minutes before the lights come on for best results. This can be hard for some to remember and get right, considering work hours and such. I have personally added an auto-doser to the tank, which makes this method stupid easy. Just set the time to dose and how much, and ensure there's liquid in the bottle.  EI is really easy in terms of forgiveness. You just dump some ferts in and change lots of water at the end of the week. Also, 1 dose per week (I believe) makes it easier to remember. There really is no difference in plant quality using either one.  I don't like how pressurized CO2 has become perceived as necessary for any given tank setup. It helps, but you can still have good results without it.  You don't start dosing with ferts until your plants need it, which can change based on your plant load. If you go from the start it won't hurt, but you are kind of wasting money IMO. Just plant with a good substrate and you'll be set for a little while as things begin to grow."
PlantedTank,3db5co,flinters17,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"They both do the same thing, but PPS is a bit harder to follow with solution make up and trying to accurately determine plant uptake. For beginners EI dosing is the easiest, as it makes everything non-limiting and only requires a 50% weekly water change to boot.   For high tech tanks that want a no-nonsense phenomenal growth with low algae, EI is the easiest way to do that. If you are looking to be more exact (and less wasteful) on nutrient dosing, PPS is where to end up. Honestly dry ferts are pretty cheap even for EI dosing.   If you aren't fond of 50% water changes (which becomes more apparent in 75 gallon tanks and up due to large water volume), you can scale back your EI dosing slightly. You would need to measure your nitrates during the scale back (or watch for plant response) to ensure you are still non-limiting."

PlantedTank,3dcv35,conklech,2,Thu Jul 16 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"There is no wpg rule for LEDs. Even for T5s, the right way to measure light intensity is known as PAR (photosynthetically active radiation). Do not use lumens as a good measure either.   Most of your LED manufacturers will have PAR charts posted (though sometimes they take some searching to find them).  LEDs are the way to go in the future due to lower energy costs, longer bulb liftetime, and dimming capability on some fixtures.   Fertilizers look good.  You shouldn't need to much more eco-complete past the 20lb in a 29 gallon would be my guess. You want to target for about 3-4 inches of substrate (some use 2, but depends on your plant species)"

PlantedTank,3dcv35,conklech,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:42:06 2015 UTC,"Not all LED fixtures are dimmable. I'd recommend trying to find a dimmable one so you can dial it back if it's too bright. Without CO2, a lot of the plant-focused lights will be too bright."
PlantedTank,3dcv35,conklech,2,Wed Jul 15 20:10:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that 20lbs is enough. I'm trying to remember how much I got for my 29, but I think the one 20-pound bag was not enough. As someone else noted, you should be aiming for 2-4 inches depth.   I'm not sure whether combining it with a normal gravel would work well. They might end up mixed together, or layered with the larger-grained one on top.  Having the plants be CO2 or nutrient limited is a bad situation. We generally want light to be the limiting factor, because light deficiency is less harmful for the plants than deficiencies of either nutrients or CO2. Furthermore algae can often out-compete unhappy plants for those few drops of nutrient and CO2. You can't really starve algae of nutrients without a full Walstad system with a highly nutritious substrate (dirt, not eco-complete), root feeders, and hardy floating plants.  Low-tech, non-dirted tanks are more difficult to get right (i.e. not have an algae disaster and/or sickly plants) than either high-tech or Walstad-style dirted tanks, in my experience. CO2 deficiency really does a number on plants. If you're price-conscious, pick up Walstad's The Ecology of the Planted Aquarium and spend some time with it; it's the bible for low-cost low-maintenance tanks."
PlantedTank,3dcv35,conklech,2,Wed Jul 15 20:44:05 2015 UTC,"Ok. So based on your recommendation I should aim for a low light environment. Pulling from some of the other comments, a LED set up seems like the best option for lighting.   In that case the Finnex 30"" FugeRay looks like a good choice. It should give just on the upper end of low light, 30 PAR at a distance of 18"".  Homeaquaria also lists it as a great option for non-CO2 injected tanks.  I'll give some more thought to the substrate. I think I'm currently leaning to just straight Eco-complete instead of mixing the two.  I'm fairly interested in the low-tech non-dirted set up, but I guess that might change."
PlantedTank,3dcv35,PriceZombie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:45 2015 UTC,"The FugeRay Planted+ isn't dimmable. 30 PAR at 18"" might be okay, but remember that a lot of the volume of the tank, including any taller plants, will be a lot closer than 18"", and therefore in much brighter lighting."
PlantedTank,3db4rk,Samuraisheep,2,Tue Jul 14 22:18:48 2015 UTC,"Use the golden ratio to position your plants. There are 4 focal points on a 2D plane, and 8 in 3D. However for aquariums, most of the time will be viewed only from the front, therefore 2D. Typically you'll have 1 Major, 1 Minor and 2 absent focal points which you want to utilize to grasp the attention of the viewer."
PlantedTank,3db4rk,chemocentryx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:20:20 2015 UTC,"So using the golden ratio or the 4 focal points, it looks like I need to shift my wood right a bit, and maybe put one of the small bits of wood (probably the one currently right) towards the bottom right point.Pic. I could then put the bolbitis possibly back left or maybe behind the top right hand focal point (although that would mean I have two top focal points)."

PlantedTank,3dcly7,Juddston,2,Wed Jul 15 07:15:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like you do not need CO2.

I would not worry about ambient light in the room. Edit: planting very dense in the beginning will help with algae too."
PlantedTank,3d92yx,steamboatpilot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:17:01 2015 UTC,"It seems like you are unbalancing one element at a time, though it's difficult to be sure without readings.   If you add CO2 and you are nutrient limited (i.e. nitrogen, phos, or potassium is low) algae will bloom and plants will suffer from deficiency.   If you add nutrients and your lighting is too high relative to your CO2 you will also get a bloom.   You need to determine your goals first. If your goal is a lush fast growing environment you see in planted tank magazines, you want to opt for a lot of nutrients, high light, and CO2 at 30 ppm. You will need to measure your CO2 and nitrates to accomplish this correctly. In my opinion these setups are easier to balance as they are nutrient unlimited and you just need to focus on your light/CO2 balance (i.e. EI dosing).   If your goal is more moderate or low growth, you will need to scale back nutrients and lighting, and this becomes a trial-and-error experience to get the right balance. In most cases CO2 is always beneficial, but you may opt not to use it based on your preference. You can get a beautiful tank even without CO2 if you keep at it:)"

Your cheap option are a couple of spiral bulb daylight CFLs mounted above the tank with desk lamp clip lights (with the flexible neck).   Your recommended option per enough budgeting is a finnex RAY II at the 36 inch length. You may also be able to get away with decent growth with a planted+ (medium light) but the RAY II is their true high light option.  EDIT: Based on other advice, the depth of your tank would allow a medium light fixture to become high light one (due to the low depth based on low gallon size for that length). So a RAY II would indeed be overkill in this case. Credit to cosalich, 691175002"

PlantedTank,3d4rfc,DelusionalX1,2,Mon Jul 13 20:08:13 2015 UTC,"Another reason is that when you have a large clump, all the leaves are basically connected in a string. So all nutrients will be shared for the upkeep of all leaves.  If you cut the string, nutrients are available to do other things than keeping a lot of leaves healthy.  This is particularly true if you have plants like sagittaria teres that spread by forming a runner and then popping up a few inches further. If you cut the runner after the leaves have started forming, they will grow a lot higher as they don't have to waste nutrients on nurturing the smaller plants.  That's also why you need to trim your plants. If there is less plant to maintain, nutrients will be available to do other things like create runners."

PlantedTank,3d60r9,ZeldaMusic113,5,Mon Jul 13 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"Do you have to vacuum the gravel or do the plants use the waste as fertilizer?   Yes, to both, sort of! You still vaccuum, but generally I just swish the water around the plants so the detritus rises up into the water, then vaccuum it out that way. I don't disturb the substrate itself as that can uproot plants, which obviously isn't wanted. Some mulm left in the substrate will be used by plants for nutrition, like you suggested.   One thing that does confuse me is the dosing of CO2. What's the easiest way to do this for a beginner?   The absolute easiest way is to purchase a paintball tank, a paintball co2 regulator, a bubble counter and a diffuser. Get it all set up, plug it in to a timer and check it every day at feeding time to make sure you've still got lots left in the tank. A 20oz paintball tank should last a couple months in a spec v, and is very cheap to refill at any paintball field/store, some gun shops and fire extinguisher places. If you have any more specific questions on CO2, feel free to ask!   Are there other things I should be dosing the plants with and how do I dose everything correctly?   Your basic fertilization can be done a few ways. On a small tank with low light and beginner plants, you likely wouldn't need more than Flourish once a week, as per the directions on the bottle.   I was thinking about getting some ghost shrimp or red cherry shrimp and maybe a couple of nerite snails.   Both those shrimp types will be good at eating leftover food, but not much else. Look out for Amano shrimp if you want a real strong aquarium cleaner. Otocinclus catfish can also be a good choice, but for an aquarium that small I'd probably stick with the amanos. Ghost shrimp are useless IMO, and cherries are nice to look at but not much else. I'm not a big fan of snails, and nerites require constant removal of eggs, defeating the purpose of cleanup.   So what you all think?   I think it sounds like you have a good grasp on what you're doing ahead of actually doing it, which is the best way to prevent disaster. Remember to cycle the aquarium before adding any fish, but especially before adding inverts as they're more sensitive.  Any other questions I'd be happy to answer."
PlantedTank,3d60r9,cosalich,2,Mon Jul 13 22:11:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed answer! I'll keep an eye out for amano shrimp. I could buy them online I guess? I don't have a lfs near me, sadly. :( And yes, I plan to have the tank nicely cycled. It'll be the third tank I've set up at this point. I've had a filter bag sitting in my female's tank to get some bacteria on it so I can seed the cycle. :) I did the same when I was setting up her current tank. I had some filter media from my first tank that I let sit in her tank for two weeks to help it cycle."
PlantedTank,3d60r9,3rdworldMoN,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:10:50 2015 UTC,"Get a full size regulator with a 5lb tank. It costs the same initially but is much cheaper in the long run with refills. Also if you don't have room, it's better to get the full size regulator with a $10~ paintball adapter instead of the mini regulator as you won't be able to upgrade when you realize it was a mistake going small."
PlantedTank,3d60r9,joshiness,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:39:10 2015 UTC,"A good full size dual stage regulator is going to cost considerably more than an Aquatek mini regulator. If money isn't an issue than I agree that a full sized regulator is really the way to go as it allows you to upgrade tanks in the future. However, OP needs to check to see if there are any welding facilities that can fill a 5lb tank. Almost any major sporting goods store will fill a paintball 20oz tank though so the paintball adapter would be a good idea.   As far as the Aquatek goes, I have the regulator and it is excellent at the price point. It is very sensitive to adjustments though, so once you have it dialed in try not to bump it at all.  I have a 5 gallon aquarium and my co2 is still running on the same 20oz tank after 9 months running 1 bubble per 4 seconds. I have a beautiful carpet of HC that seems like its duckweed at this point (Any floating bits from a trim grows rapidly) and my ludwigia repens grows like a weed."

It looks like your standard mature-tank green algae. You will want to perform 50% water changes, once daily, until you can get your nitrates down in the 20s or below.   Next step is to inspect your lighting. Are you using LEDs or bulbs? If you are using a bulb solution, are the bulbs older than a year? If they are, they need to be replaced as older bulbs cause spectrum shifts favorable to algae.   Last step is to begin to look at the source of nutrients. Are you feeding your fish more than they can eat in three minutes? Is a large amount of food getting to the bottom?   You also need to inspect your tank for excess detritus in the gravel and the filter. The filter should be cleaned (remove any particulates) making sure to only wash filter media in tank water or non-chlorinated. You should also vacuum your gravel with a siphon, going about an inch deep to suck up any settled mulm and detritus."

You may want to begin experimenting with your light intensity or duration and see if that impacts algae growth if your issues remain. I find most run their tanks with lights that are too strong.

Most do fine with just two T5 HO bulbs if mounted right at the top of the tank. You could try four and if you see bleaching on some leaves you will know the lighting is too high.   Keep in mind these bulbs will need to be replaced every 9-12 months depending on your average lighting time.   Not sure on your history of the fixture you currently own, but think about replacing the T5 fixture in the long run to help you save on electricity costs and bulb replacement with LEDs. The technology is currently equalizing fluorescent tubes or even exceeding it (depending on your needs). Only in rare reef tank cases would I advise other lighting types."

Most of these items will be compatible as they use the common sizes (tubing, etc.)  4) You never want to restrict a pumps intake, this will drastically reduce life and cause problems. You always want to do restricting (if any) on the outflow. The common setup for inline CO2 is a CO2 reactor placed in between the canister output and the output spray bar. Some also place the CO2 diffuser right underneath the intake in the aquarium (so that the propeller chops the bubbles) but this can cause minor cavitation and reduce pump life as well. Best practice is a CO2 reactor on the output."

If it's more like D, with the holes in the bigger leaves and more loss of color than actually turning bright yellow, it could indicate a kalium deficiency.  By the way, I assume it's more leaves that are affected than just the ones in the picture right? Because they only seem to have spots where they stick out of the water, which would make sense."
PlantedTank,3d5a8s,Astilaroth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much - I am leaning towards nitrate deficiency - I didn't realize they needed it :-/  I have been keeping the nitrate levels low because I was told they should be low for the fish.    And yes - I've killed a whole bunch of plants this way, and just got new ones and they're starting to be affected after a couple of days as well.  I'll try to dose N and see what happens, thank you!"
PlantedTank,3d5a8s,Astilaroth,2,Mon Jul 13 18:57:54 2015 UTC,"Nitrates should be quite low for the fish, usually through water changes and/or plants ... so that's why I'm unsure about it, logically you'd have zero nitrates before you see these deficiencies."

PlantedTank,3d5tgn,Village_ponce,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:39:41 2015 UTC,I agree that a fully autonomous system would be very unlikely. A system similar to an open top ecosphere or a small walstad would be closest since he would only have to top off the water.

When I got back it was still alive and kicking. The substrate was 1-1.5"" peatmoss with some regular aquarium rocks to hold it down. Had lots of java moss, and blyxa japonica in and around some drift wood and small platform rocks. It only housed 6 ghost shrimp, and all it needed was some sunlight. My mother saran-wrapped the top off to keep the water from evaporating out. If you don't seal the top off you need to refill the water every once in a while. Only 2 ghost shrimp were alive when I got back. I figured the other ghost shrimp ate them. But they were noticeably larger than before."

Do you know how much sunlight it gets? I'm not an expert on natural light tanks but that could be the problem too. Swords are generally pretty easy to grow plants
PlantedTank,3d31tn,macsblow,2,Mon Jul 13 03:25:46 2015 UTC,"When you say trim the leaf, do you mean cut the entire leaf off or just trim off the brown part?  It doesnt get an overbearing amount of sun.  It gets good morning and a bit of afternoon sun, then just ambient sunlight/house light for the rest of the day."
PlantedTank,3d31tn,macsblow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:33:43 2015 UTC,I would cut off the whole leaf but I suspect your tank might not be getting enouhg light. I would say 8 to 10 hours per day.  Also unless the other lights are meant for plant growth (6500 Kelvin bulbs) they aren't contributing to the tank
PlantedTank,3d31tn,oldman_robot,3,Mon Jul 13 03:41:19 2015 UTC,"I would say it definitely gets enough light.  It has direct sunlight from sunrise to around 1 or 2 oclock in the afternoon.  Then for the rest of the day it gets pretty good light from the sun.  Also where should I cut the leaf, from the base of the plant or from where the leaf starts to grow?"
PlantedTank,3d31tn,macsblow,5,Mon Jul 13 03:46:09 2015 UTC,Cut the leaf stem from the base.
PlantedTank,3d2kxw,twinsuns,5,Mon Jul 13 00:44:17 2015 UTC,"First and foremost make sure you cycle your tank/filter. If you don't know what this is make sure you read the sidebar information about the nitrogen cycle.  Secondly, your betta won't do well with platys or neon tetras. They'll either nip his fins or he'll nip theirs. They're too brightly colored and too fast. And honestly 10g isn't really big enough for a healthy school of platys or neons let alone with a betta in there.   If I were you all I would add to that tank would be Pygmy corys. They're small, earth toned, don't have a huge bio load  and tend to stay towards the bottom of the tank. You could also try inverts like shrimp (the betta might eat them) or snails.   Lastly, check out r/bettafish. A they'll have lots of good info for you."
PlantedTank,3d2kxw,kstarks17,2,Mon Jul 13 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"As long as you keep your filter wet and preferably running in a bucket with aquarium water you should be able to keep your cycle going. The beneficial bacteria (the ones you need for your nitrogen cycle) are mostly in the filter material and in your substrate. Since you're doing a substrate overhaul you'll miss some, but key is to save the filter!  As for the substrate... if you do the following you should be able to have clear water pretty much right away: rinse it thoroughly. Put it in a bucket, stick a gardenhose or showerhead in it and rinse well a couple of times, ditching the dirty water as you go. Put it in your tank, cover it with plastic (any kind, regular bag will do) and put a plate on that. Slowely pour water on top of the plate. After a while the bag will start floating, that's fine. There is no need to wait for anything to settle if you do this right, you can put in the plants and your old filter right away!  A 10 gal is a nice space for a Betta, but that's it. I personally wouldn't include any other fish that inhabit the same space, let alone the ones you mention. Personally I wouldn't put any corydoras in either, not even the pygmy ones.   If you want an easy plant that sort of has that carpet look, check out cryptocoryne parva. Crypto's are cool hardy plants and this one looks a bit like a carpet plant.   Did your LFS tell you that Anubias and Java fern are epiphytes and therefor shouldn't be planted in the substrate directly? Or at least not with their rhizome? It's easiest to tie them to something and just let the roots dangle free. There are a lot of youtube tutorials on this, check it out! They are indeed hardy plants, so that was definitely sound advice there.  The pleco... yeah maybe rehome that one. 10 gal is really too small for the beasty.  Have fun with redecorating!"

Tubing Bubble counter: Co2 is gauged by the bubbles per second. For instance my tank uses about 1 bubble every 1.3 seconds. Diffuser Drop checker: monitors the co2 dissolved in your water.  Check valve: not 100% necessary but if you  want some insurance it's good to have. I think you can find check valves that split the tube too.   That's pretty much it.

PlantedTank,3d1z6x,davdev,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"I think my lights are OK. My algae scrubber and I are very ready to end this war.  20G L - 1x 30"" Finnex Planted+  7hrs ON due to dosing and lack of CO2  37G T - 1x 30"" Finnex Planted 24/7 (24/7 mode - never truly OFF), 1x 30"" Finnex Planted+ and 1x 24"" Planted+ both 4hrs ON. With the tall tank, having the extra lights seems to help reach the bottom better."
PlantedTank,3d1z6x,yosemighty_sam,2,Mon Jul 13 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"That's a monster co2 cylinder. Will last a long time. For reference, I get 3-4 months out of my 20oz cylinder. & 7. Whatever regulator you get, solenoid is a must so you can set it on a timer with the light. The plants are only going to use the C02 when they have light, so it's a waste to leave it on 24/7. (FYI: When it turns on, the C02 can take 5-10 minutes to build up enough pressure to start diffusing, so some people actually put it on it's own timer to get a head start on the lights, but that may be overkill.) C02 tubing is worth the extra pennys. I've read that regular air hosing loses 40x more CO2, so it's a no brainer. In line diffuser would only work on the cannister filter. So you'd still need a diffuser for each tank no matter what.  Any drop checker will do for measuring C02. I like fluval's inverted cone design. It's not as sexy as the glass ones, but it's cheaper and much easier to read. Most bubble counters have built in check valves, so you're covered there. You could have just one before the split, but I'd really recommend two bubble counters, and place them after the split. That way you can adjust the feed for each tank. Since they're different sizes I think it would be a real challenge to balance them otherwise. Never heard of anyone installing one because of an aquarium setup, but it sure couldn't hurt to have the added personal safety. Maybe with a tank the size you're planning it's more important than with the little 20oz I use. I can't give you any informed advice here except to say it couldn't hurt.    You also mentioned a needle valve. I have been thinking about getting one myself. $15 on amazon. The valve on my regulator is pretty finicky. I have to make the tiniest adjustments, wait 5-10 minutes, check the bubbles, then adjust again. Kind of ridiculous how sensitive it is. But I'm not sure if the needle valve will be any more precise than the valve on my regulator. If anyone else has experience with these I'd be interested in hearing.   Edit: about the needle valve - since you're splitting the line it might make the most sense to get two needle valves, position them after the split and set the bubble counters after each valve. That will give you the most control. Maybe more expensive but since you're doing one cylinder and one regulator you're already saving a ton of money.  Edit 2: as /u/davdev mentions, without enough light your plants won't use as much C02, so make sure your lighting is up to par.  PS: make sure to get before and after shots of your tanks!"
PlantedTank,3d1z6x,Ka0tiK,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:55:22 2015 UTC,"The list looks good, a lot of good recommendations already. Personally, I don't believe you will need a CO2 alarm as CO2 is not nearly as harmful as CO (monoxide) and would require the room to be the size of a small closet to cause an issue.   Health issues (if any) will be noticeable as headaches and dizziness. If you have small children or elderly, it may be worth it just as peace of mind.   A lot of times you will also smell it if it leaks (not because the CO2 has odor, but because some recycled beverage tanks have odor from  inside the tank or at the seal). In my case it has a burnt smell to it when it has ever leaked."
PlantedTank,3d0uk4,SkepticJoker,5,Sun Jul 12 16:04:19 2015 UTC,I've had similar problems in my tank. By the end I realized it didn't really matter which deficiency it was because root tabs were the way to fix it. I just stuck tabs under the affected plants. I poked my anubias roots into the substrate.  The damaged leaves won't repair themselves but the new growth should be good. Make sure your light is bright enough too - that was my other problem.

With DIY CO2, it has no long term and it'll be very annoying to switch out the CO2 solution every month.   I would also recommend you to check the Finnex series for LED lights, as they are known to be one of the best LED lights for planted tanks.   Also for your sand bed, I would recommend Osmecote fertilizer pills."
PlantedTank,3d35tv,gbrendan,2,Mon Jul 13 04:53:50 2015 UTC,"Your micron filter will be the best. Some use surface skimmers but there is no protein skimmer equivalent.   DIY is ok for a 27 gallon, but you may find it doesn't give you consistent enough output. That will be something you will need to test for yourself (I'm sure others here have exact sugar/yeast recipes).  Ceramic diffusers will be fine in almost all applications. Steer clear from atomic diffusers as they typically require pressure inputs that only canisters can provide (if you go DIY). Running CO2 inline (via a reactor) is the most efficient way but not exactly needed on smaller tanks (less than 100 gallons).   Your go to fertilizers if you buy them dry will be potassium nitrate (K,N), and monopotassium phosphate (K,P). You can buy them online or via green leaf aquariums, or aquarium fertilizer.com.   You will learn that your light and CO2 balance will be the biggest factor in algae issues. If you get algae blooms you typically want to decrease lighting or increase CO2. You need to be careful with livestock with increasing CO2. Many of us use drop checkers to get us to a safe but optimal level of CO2 in our tanks."

PlantedTank,3d1748,deathsmiled,3,Sun Jul 12 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"A plant is a plant. Floating plants have roots too, but instead of roots being in the dirt, it's on the water surface.   The time it takes for ammonia to go down to zero depends on how many plants you have.  I recommend dwarf water lettuce if you want some floating plants, and keep in mind that if you choose duckweed, it's almost impossible to get rid of later on."

I thought about the duck weed since I have sooo much but I've read the nightmare stories on here of people trying to get rid of it. Plus, I don't think there's enough light on this tank for it. I guess I'll just keep checking the ammonia every day and when it's down to zero I'll pull the floaters and plant more jungle val."
PlantedTank,3d1748,aoideos,2,Mon Jul 13 04:12:01 2015 UTC,My understanding is that soil is messing in general so its going to suck to uproot anything. I tried it in a walstad bowl once. Not fun. Im sure its worse when you add current from a filter into it. But Im curious about the floating plants and the ammonia too. I hope you get an answer
PlantedTank,3d1748,rustyisme123,2,Mon Jul 13 03:11:01 2015 UTC,"In my tank I didn't get an ammonia spike initially. It was not until about the second week after I had added fish that I got any kind of ammonia reading. It was at the same time that my water went from being almost crystal clear to tea colored. Not sure what happened, but after increasing water changes, treating with  prime, and about three days, my filters caught up. I am running two 40g sponges in my 40g tank. One was seasoned from another tank. The other was not.  What are your water parameters? Filter?"
PlantedTank,3d1748,rustyisme123,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:26:43 2015 UTC,"My water has had ammonia from the time I set it up so I'm assuming it was already in the tap water I used. I usually use spring water but it was going to be too cost prohibitive for this tank. I'm using a penn plax filter and did not use any media from an established tank. I do have that tea color in it now and it wasn't there at first. I have no wood so I don't know why it's changed colors. I'm clueless on the parameters. The only test kit I have is for ammonia. I haven't set up a regular aquarium in ages. My projects for the last few years have been ""different'. All my other tanks on on my back porch and contain locally caught species. One is a 40gal with a sunfish and 2 tiny soft shells. It is densely planted; about 80% of the water is filled with plants. It has a penn plax 400 on it. Other than 1/4 of the bottom that has about 2"" of sand for the turtles, there is no substrate. When I got the ammonia kit for this new indoor tank, I tested the 40g out of curiosity and it read zero ammonia. The other outdoor tank is brackish and has a skillet fish, gobbies, shrimp and crabs. It too has zero ammonia. It is planted with mangroves and some unknown plant I found at the river. I top it off with water I get at the river (it's connected to the ocean so it's brackish).  Sorry for the long reply I just meant to explain how I'm out of practice with this sort of thing. What test kits should I get? When I checked it today I see my jungle val is all wilty and mushy but the floating plants look fine."
PlantedTank,3d1748,chazerr,2,Mon Jul 13 14:42:45 2015 UTC,"Wow. That's pretty cool. Yeah, the ammonia and tea colored tint is probably from the soil. Maybe your tap too. My guess is that it'll take a few weeks for your tank to cycle. You should get the API master kit. You'll be glad you did."

I plan to start it lightly planted with good light (Planted+ 24/7 or Ray2) and overfiltration (Emperor 400).  Will periodically add community fish/shrimp to assist with tank development.  If you need anything else, let me know.  I'd rather keep cost as low as possible.  With that said, I'm not against spending a little more (within reason) if the end product is better off for it."

Lately, I've been using black diamond blasting sand 20/40 on every tank (its 8 dollars for 50 lbs. if you have a tractor supply company nearby). It is extremely cost effective and a beautiful black sand if you are into that.   Further note: you will see concerns about its use on several forums (as it is coal slag). You may even see an oily residue at the top when first washed, but many can attest to its inertness and independent water quality studies on it have shown it has safer leaching than most tap water levels."

PlantedTank,3d0j5e,Ka0tiK,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:59:34 2015 UTC,"The 20/40 is a grit size (think sand grain size). The 20/40 I believe is their medium grain size. The finer one (30/60 I think?) was too small grain wise and would stir up with the slightest ""breeze"" in the tank if you will. I find the 20/40 to be the best size."

If you just added water (or a water change), your source water may be high in carbon dioxide (typically seen in wells) and after off-gassing overnight has now allowed pH to climb slightly. If the pH stays constant from that point you are just fine."

PlantedTank,3cyeg2,RiddleRiddle,4,Sat Jul 11 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"One thing I think drastically improved tanks is making the landscape dynamic, rocks are your best friend for this. Having a stack of rock in your back corner with sand poured over it will make the scene more natural and give you more surface area to plant. Digging out the area under your wood to the back of the tank would create a nice tunnel that all your fish will love and it's fun to look at and explore. Anything that makes it look less flat is going to be more fun to look at. But the more rocks the better in my opinion!   Also maybe get rid of the background for a black one, for esthetics sake."
PlantedTank,3cyeg2,RiddleRiddle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:00:11 2015 UTC,"I rescued the tank from a buddy so next up is definitely getting rid of the background.

PlantedTank,3cyeg2,nahfoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"Oh nice! That's a good setup to start with! Changing the scape with water in it is going to be a good deal more difficult, I have Amazonite which is basically just dirt, moving even a little bit puts up a smokescreen, can't see a thing I do. You will get much better results if you empty the tank of water fish and plants.  The best way to make a slope or hill is to set up a structure of rocks in the shape you want the sand to flow on the bottom of the tank, then pour the sand over your rock structure. Use water safe super glue to make more complex structures (like rock walls/arches) Leave a bit of rock to stick out of the sand for a realistic eroded feel. Look in the top posts on the sub and copy a structure you like too, emulation was my biggest friend. Best of luck to you!"

Read every article  http://fish-etc.com/aquascaping-main/aquascaping-a-planted-aquarium What I try to do is make my aquascape look good before adding any plants or even subatrate Edit: ok definitely get rid of the background and paint the back(outside glass) black or just put a black peice of paper or whatever behind it. Get some rocks, whatever kind as long and they all kinda match in texture and color. I don't normally use river stones but I've seen it done well before. Put the fish and plants in a 5 gallon bucket while you redo the tank. Look up the golden ratio and try to come up with some kind of focal point,  whether it be a rock, the wood, the top of a hill,  etc.you want your stones and rocks to be slightly buried in the substrate instead of sitting on top of it.  To make your tank look bigger have the substrate slope so it's higher in the back than in the front but as the other user said you really want different levels of substrate to make it look more dynamic"
PlantedTank,3cyeg2,nahfoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:32:26 2015 UTC,Next thing I'm doing is replacing the background. Would it be possible to make like a wall out of rocks and maybe epoxy/ silicone them together and use it as a retention wall for sand? Would something like that look good?
PlantedTank,3cyeg2,nahfoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I'm not sure how well silicon would hold rocks. Did you mean to use it as a background? Or just as a little wall?

You can just stack them up like I did in My 40b I posted here, it creates kind of a cliff and it looks good to juat barely separate 2 peices that fit together either with substrate in between or just a crack"

PlantedTank,3czw65,eraof5,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:09:32 2015 UTC,It all depends on what plants you have. Low tech or high tech plants?
PlantedTank,3czw65,ace1395,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:43:57 2015 UTC,while the new tank is cycling you should keep the light to 8 hours. When I first started one of my tanks and left the lights on all the time it exploded with nitrites.
PlantedTank,3czw65,awoods5000,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:16:01 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you want to run the tank. If you go low tech (non-added-CO2) you get slower growth with less plant options and lower light, but the advantage is less pruning maintenance and a more balanced tank (especially if you go out of town for a few days).   If you go high tech (added-CO2), you get to grow everything (especially a better variety of reds and pinks), but you get extremely fast growth that will need to be trimmed every few days. You also need CO2 added, high light, and fertilizers added at certain intervals. It is much more work and requires more maintenance (in terms of dosing and pruning).   Most who do dry starts go for at least medium to high lighting (as most dry starts are carpets) and most carpeting plants thrive in some sort of added CO2. This would elect you to the high-tech route which will require dosing and CO2 tweaking (using a drop checker or by trial and error).   EDIT: A noticeable exception here is liquid CO2 (Flourish Excel) which serves as an ""in-between."" Expect growth to be faster than low-tech but still not nearly as fast as high tech."
PlantedTank,3cxp8c,hughmanitarian,2,Sat Jul 11 18:37:19 2015 UTC,Take smaller peices of the moss and tie/super glue it to the wood and rocks it'll grow out looking much nicer if it's in smaller peices and tied closely to the rock/wood  Edit: also I think you need some kind of focal point. Maybe get that piece of wood and move it forward and raise it up somehow(pile of rocks or substrate underneath) or put something just a little taller there.  I feel like your scape is kinda flat front to back but with a little tweaking it could be very nice

Are you absolutely sure you got the right species of moneywort?  Lysimachia nummularia has a tough time growing totally submerged but it will easily survive with CO2 and ferts like you're using. bacopa monnieri is the submerged version of moneywort.   I think leaf changes like this are totally natural in some plants. some plants like dwarf four leaf clover need to have their leaves cut off before they can adapt to being submerged. The leaves and runners look very green so it's not your lights. Root tabs won't work on the runners but they will work on the places it's planted into the substrate.  Maybe it's your temperature I've had more success with both kinds of Moneywort in colder tank temperatures."

PlantedTank,3cytnb,collegedog,2,Sun Jul 12 02:17:49 2015 UTC,It stays within 6 inches or so to the pipe.  The key is getting the mound steep enough to where the sand keeps feeding itself.
PlantedTank,3cytnb,darkest4,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:47:44 2015 UTC,Is that why you have the rocks within the sand to gently keep it close instead of letting it flow away?

PlantedTank,3cx0ba,TheKolbrin,3,Sat Jul 11 16:05:07 2015 UTC,Aquarist for 45 years. Was in the fish industry - wholesale and retail for nearly 20 of them. I have always let spot algae (if it grew) grow on my back glass and sometimes end sides of my tanks (if the tank were in a wall). I also let it grow on my driftwood and rocks to a degree if it showed up. I have never had an issue with this and it provides Ottos & Amanos a regular diet. I have also not had an issue of it 'transferring' to healthy plants. I think it provides a more natural microbiota in the tank and lends a more natural look until it runs it's course.

PlantedTank,3cvdyy,davdev,8,Sat Jul 11 05:19:52 2015 UTC,Lol this guy
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,thocan,7,Sat Jul 11 06:18:14 2015 UTC,"Heh. To be fair, it's a fresh caught fish that he had planned to eat at first. Seems like he had the right idea from the start."

PlantedTank,3cvdyy,Nehalennian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:56:08 2015 UTC,Yeah. He is as I've discovered. He is getting a tank upgrade and I bought him a new filter for a 100g tank!
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,Is_This_Invalid,3,Mon Jul 13 22:26:10 2015 UTC,"You think? He's like 4 inches long.   At least.  Its a green sunfish, they get pretty big."
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,Is_This_Invalid,3,Sat Jul 11 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"I've got one right now,  they're really cool looking fish! Unfortunately,  they're also voracious, aggressive assholes. Whatever tank he's in is only him. I had a few other wild caught fish in my 20 long with my green when he was small,  and he'd beat the crap out of fish twice his size."
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,Is_This_Invalid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:44:21 2015 UTC,"Really? Dang! I haven't seen this one with other fish his size. He eats fish flakes now though. And he knows I feed him now. He'll eat out of my hand too, and bite my finger."
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,davdev,3,Mon Jul 13 22:26:55 2015 UTC,I have one too! The jerk eats and kills everyone. Hes in a tank all by himself now. He digs up all the plants too for his nest haha.

PlantedTank,3cvdyy,1YearWonder,4,Tue Jul 14 17:21:30 2015 UTC,I have a large green sunfish in a 75g with a couple other sunnies.  He gets along great with other sunfish but he's  a butt to anyone else.  I love him though
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,squishybugs,3,Sat Jul 11 07:48:07 2015 UTC,What exactly is he? you caught him?
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,BubblyBullinidae,7,Sat Jul 11 04:26:52 2015 UTC,He's a green sunfish. Caught him in a Missouri lake with a wriggly lure.
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,squishybugs,3,Sat Jul 11 04:28:53 2015 UTC,Thats awesome. What tank temp./water parameters does he need? ive heard of someone else on here that lived out east keeping a lake fish they caught. Im out in oregon and wonder if theres any fish i could catch to keep in my own tank. I already have a bichir though so i dont know how well that would go over.
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,drklrdpcky,4,Sat Jul 11 04:31:33 2015 UTC,"Bichirs are so cute, btw! I wouldn't keep anything wild in a tank with any of your fish though. I put this guy in a tank with a dozen feeder guppies. They're all gone now."
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,LancerLobo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:52:43 2015 UTC,"My tank is at 75 right now and i will probably keep the there untill the end of summer then bump it up to 79-82 in the winter. since its summer i like to lower the temp in case i get a hot day that shoots water temp up for no reason.     thats where my bichir likes it. i also have a black ghost knife, african butterfly, pleco, and random tetras that may end up food.  Probably wouldnt put something wild in with them but was just curious as to how similar the setup would be compared to what i have now"
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,deathsmiled,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:11:24 2015 UTC,Probably pretty similar in that case. I like your fish selection!
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,davdev,3,Mon Jul 13 22:24:10 2015 UTC,"Im out in oregon and wonder if theres any fish i could catch to keep in my own tank.   Check your state laws, often it is illegal to keep native fish, though many do it anyway.  Advantage is the fish is used to water that is probably damn close to what is in your tap.  Sunfish are similar in needs and personality to South American cichlids, though they aren't really  closely related.  Keep water on the cool side though, low 70's tops. Keep in mind as a wild fish he will be very agressive and what he doesnt eat, he will probably fight.  Might be able to stick one in with a bichir, but only if it is very small to start and you let it grow up with the bichir"
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,deathsmiled,0,Sat Jul 11 14:07:12 2015 UTC,"If you're up in oregon I imagine you probably shouldn't use a tank heater. I used to live in WA. I tried keeping some caught fish but they always died. I was also 7 and put them in tiny containers so that was probably why. Currently the tank is at 79... I'm thinking of lowering it to 75 though. I don't really know what he needs, but he seems healthy right now, so I'll keep his setup similar!"
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,Blottoboxer,6,Sat Jul 11 04:51:38 2015 UTC,79 seems super high for north American fish.  Even platys and swords from mexico like 72-75 degrees.
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,jakestl,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:17:42 2015 UTC,He is a pond/lake fish and the ponds here in MO get in the 80s. I think I'm going to lower it to 76 though.
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,boltgunner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:25:21 2015 UTC,"Hey, I caught a green sunfish and kept it in my tank for about a year. I kept the tank in the low 70s, and fed him frozen blood worms. He did just fine until I had to take the tank down, and I released him back into the river I caught him in. He was a pretty nice fish, a little shy, but other wise friendly, hope you enjoy your new fish!"
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,kwirky88,4,Sat Jul 11 14:09:38 2015 UTC,for future reference you should never put fish from your home into a waterway regardless of if it came from there in the first place.
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,boltgunner,6,Sat Jul 11 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"Why is that? I've always heard that about pet fish, and totally understand the reasoning behind it, but why is returning a fish to the place it was caught a bad thing?   I don't disagree with you at all, I'm just looking to learn something. :)"
PlantedTank,3cvdyy,boltgunner,8,Sat Jul 11 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"Diseases and parasites from the hobby that don't occur in the fish's natural environment. A lot of them can be dormant so the fish looks fine but carries them, so it's just recommended to not release them back at all."

I think it's amazing to see what people could achieve decades ago, long before all the high tech stuff. I found this picture on an incredibly thorough and awesome explanation of planted tank set-up and maintenance, specifically the substrate and fertilization. Sadly for most of you folks it's in Dutch, but maybe you can run it through a translator or just look at the pictures and graphs.  I'm more than willing to help translate bits, but seeing the incredible amount of text I hope you understand that I can't really translate it all. Feel free to ask me about specific bits though!

PlantedTank,3csx6a,DissipatedOptimism,3,Fri Jul 10 14:46:06 2015 UTC,"Take the plant out of the L-shaped part coming off the ""dirtyness intake"". That's a sun-sun canister, I spy, right?  Sun-sun's instruction booklet is hilarious engrish, give it a read. That L-shape is a backup siphon break. If the tubing comes loose where it meets the filter, there is a floating portion that should be attached to the L-shape that lowers and breaks the siphon, resulting in only 5 gallons of water on your floor instead of +20 gallons.  Plants look good, nice variety. I like to spread my deco out in the tank and build more the back, with a small (but obvious) centerpiece, that way I maximize the space for decoration and inhabitant living space."

PlantedTank,3csx6a,jaquatics,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:28:17 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that L shaped tube is a surface skimmer to pull oils from off the top of the water.  It should be just at water level otherwise you're going to lose a fish getting sucked into it, like it's already sucked up those loose plants."
PlantedTank,3csx6a,faust15,3,Sat Jul 11 02:51:37 2015 UTC,Seems like you've used a few different types of rock.  A single type would tie the textures and colors together and make it look more complete.  I love this scape BTW.
PlantedTank,3csx6a,BuckWildChuck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:02:24 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Additionally, I think you need more plants on the base level between all the smaller rocks.  Looking good though."

PlantedTank,3csx6a,Juddston,2,Fri Jul 10 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"I like the overall setup. I see you're attaching epiphytes to some of the wood, which looks like a good idea. Moss or fissidens might be nice as well. Emergent plants could be great as well.  I'm concerned the high, brightly-lit wood will grow algae quickly. Are you running CO2?"
PlantedTank,3csx6a,steamboatpilot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:51:24 2015 UTC,No Co2 just excel. The light is a planted+ 24/7 so its not on max all the time. hopefully that ill be enough to keep the algae out
PlantedTank,3cvmbx,NoGimmicks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:43:35 2015 UTC,all I have to add is that with your DIY co2 youll have to be careful if you plan on keeping that betta in there. from what I understand co2 absorption slows down drastically overnight and so your co2 will spike with a diy rig unless you remember to clamp it over night every night  digging that marimo :)

PlantedTank,3cw8oi,nahfoo,2,Sat Jul 11 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"I just find rocks in the wild or buy them from a landscape supply store. They let me drive my truck onto the scale and handload some rocks. I got maybe 400 lbs worth? Idk it was damn heavy and took up almost all the cargo room in my jeep cherokee but they only charged me $6. Do not buy from a fish store. You'll pay like $3/lb minimum. I've always just rinsed the rocks real good under a hose and never had a problem but if you wanted to be more thorough you could scrub them with bleach and let it dry out or pour boiling water over them (just don't submerge them in boiling water) look at my recent submission of my hardacape for my 40b,those are the rocks I got and I used less than a quarter of what I bought. I'll be posting an actual tank shit when my finnex Gets here"
PlantedTank,3cw8oi,CalvinFromVietnam,2,Sat Jul 11 21:11:12 2015 UTC,if you buy the rocks that should be save but youwould still want to wash them.
PlantedTank,3cw8oi,meinthebox,2,Sat Jul 11 09:09:10 2015 UTC,It all depends on the rock style you want.  Some rocks are available from land scape supply companies and they can be very inexpensive compared to some specialty aquascaping rocks found online or in LFS.   Share some pictures of tanks with rocks you like and we can probably name them for you which will make finding them easier.
PlantedTank,3cw8oi,jynnjynn,2,Sat Jul 11 14:07:21 2015 UTC,"Get any rock you want as long as it isnt likely to contain pesticides or anything else really hazardous.    scrub it clean, let it dry, and place a drop of white vinegar on the rock.  If it Fizzes, you shouldnt use that type. it will alter your PH.  If it doesnt, youre good to go.  If it is an outdoor rock, I usually give them a quick soak in bleach solution, followed by a good rinse and a soak in dechlorinated water to make sure any eggs, algae, or bacteria is killed."
PlantedTank,3cw8oi,nahfoo,3,Sat Jul 11 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"Ph raising doesn't necessarily rule them out though,  it depends what kind of fish you're keeping, also if you change water frequently it shouldn't effect it that much.  Pro tip, instead of using vinegar use one of the bottles from a nitrate test kit. I'm not sure if it was #1 or #2 but one of them is just hydrochloric acid and will be much easier to see results with than vinegar"

PlantedTank,3cukdh,Servc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:19:16 2015 UTC,"Are the bubbles coming from under your plant leaves or from the diffuser? I suspect from the diffuser, which just means it's some CO2 bubbles at the top. However that looks similar to pearling stuck in the protein layer which is what I have right now and it looks sweet."
PlantedTank,3cukdh,phyzzix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well if your surface has no movement, a layer is been created on the top. That is why those ADA I/O things are awesome because while they add water to your tank, they clean the surface."
PlantedTank,3cukdh,eraof9,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:11:22 2015 UTC,you need something to keep the water surface moving. something needs to make little ripples on the surface. the film layer on the surface will magically disappear.

Just keep your lighting/fert/possible co2 in a nice tight schedule.  Personally I would add co2 to the tank, esp if you have it lying around. Keep in mind those 45g catridges are only going to last a week or so, so I would try to get a paintball tank + regulator."
PlantedTank,3ctmr9,silenc3x,2,Fri Jul 10 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"Let me introduce you to my chemical warfare arsenal.  Apply directly to algae whenever it crops up, a squirt or two for each patch. Within seconds the affected algae will start pearling. Within a day or two it will turn red, and a few days later dead white.  At which point your algae eaters, if you have any (amanos/otos) will start snacking. (Apparently the algae tastes terrible to them while it's still alive.)"
PlantedTank,3ctmr9,yosemighty_sam,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:55:32 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone! This is my first post so don't mind my noobiness. So about 7 months ago I started a 2.5 gallon tank via dry start method with dwarf hairgrass in an attempt to get a head start on a nice carpet going which can be seen in the following picture (http://i.imgur.com/v7GSkvq.jpg). For my substrate I used about a inch of eco-complete in addition to some black and white aquarium gravel on top, and for my lighting I used a single 6500K daylight CFL light bulb. So I finally got around to filling up my tank about a week ago and have been dosing it weekly with flourish. I've also been dosing it daily, and in the morning before the light turns on, with excel and liquid CO2. At night, or after my light turns off, I've been doing a daily 10% water change because, after all, it is a small tank and because I want to make sure that all the chemicals I'm putting in don't become too concentrated for my horned nerite, cherry shrimp and eventual betta. During those 7 months I had also placed an AZOO Mignon Filter 60 into my other 5 gallon tank with only mechanical (which I cleaned weekly) and biological filtration in an attempt to seed it and get it ready for my 2.5 gallon tank where it lies now. I also have a 50 watt preset Aqueon heater in the tank which is set at 78 degrees and includes an automatic shut off which is great because during the day the CFL can single handily keep the tank temperature at around 79 degrees. My plants right now are doing great and watching my plants pearl makes me feel like a proud father. However, the algae is doing great too. About 3-4 months into the dry start method a crazy amount of algae started growing in my tank. However, it wasn't inhibiting the growth of my plants so I wasn't too worried. Plus it kinda looked both cool and natural. However, now that I've filled up my tank, I want to get rid of it, and I'm not sure how. Other then manually removing it which I don't want to do, I've heard of people setting their light timers for 2 intervals of 4-6 hours a day because apparently plants can photosynthesize much quicker then algae and by the time the algae begins to do so, the lights are already off. If the solution calls for CO2, I do have a very cheap mini CO2 system lying around by a company called WATERPLANT which uses 45g cartridge CO2 and comes with a regulator and diffuser. Please help! I've already bought everything to set up a high tech 20 gallon long planted tank and I want to make sure I don't make the same mistakes. Especially because I think I'll be doing the dry start method again since it worked out so well for me the first time, minus the algae of course. Here are some zoomed in pics of the algae I currently have in my tank (http://i.imgur.com/CiCPaN9.jpg & http://i.imgur.com/MW0bD1J.jpg) P.S. sorry for the lengthy post but I wanted to be as descriptive as possible. Thanks again!"
PlantedTank,3ctmr9,jaquatics,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"most likely too much light and not enough CO2.  With grasses you usually need CO2 supplementation.  Try adding CO2, making sure there is some good water movement to disperse the CO2 around the plants and may raise the light off the tank a little."
PlantedTank,3ctmr9,conklech,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:59:07 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time seeing what's going on in those photos. It looks like there's either hair algae or (maybe) cyanobacteria growing on the DHG; I can't tell what the bright green stuff at the right side is.  The brownish stuff in the bottom right could be diatoms or just ordinary detritus. I don't think there's much to do about diatoms other than water changes and wait for the silicates to finish leaching from the tank and substrate.  It looks like the lighting level is pretty high; you've got a CFL almost immediately above the waterline. (Which might not be a great idea; the fixture and lamp are probably not designed to get wet.)  You mentioned that you use ""excel and liquid CO2""; what's the ""liquid CO2""? Excel is the normal liquid carbon supplement. Some people say it kills shrimp; check on plantedtank.net to see what the current consensus on that is.  If you have a pressurized CO2 system lying around, try hooking it up. It looks like you just have red cherry shrimp, which are reported to tolerate CO2 well. Start off low. Check the pH before the CO2 turns on and then a few hours after it goes on; more importantly, watch carefully for behavior changes in the fish and shrimp to indicate distress. CO2 will help the plants grow vigorously, and will probably help with whatever algae problem you're having.  You don't mention what your current photoperiod is. It's probably too long, especially if your light is as bright as it looks. Less light is almost never bad; it just slows down growth. Drop it to two three-hour periods and see what happens; increase it and take notes on the effects.  Algae is a natural part of every aquatic system. All tanks have algae. Shrimp will eat some; some you can remove manually, e.g. with a clean toothbrush."
PlantedTank,3ctmr9,Soidfuf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:42:52 2015 UTC,"Low nitrates, low Oxygen, low circulation causes cyano which is the green slime on the tips of the grass.   Brown algae is normal and will go away in time.   Green fuzz algae is normal and will go away in time.  Green spot algae is caused by low phosphates and bright light. Physical removal and increasing phosphates will fight it if it gets really bad but usually it wont.   How long is you light on each day?   Also your water changes every day may be causing nutrient limitations for your plants so they are overcome with algae over time.   Also, the chemistry of a 2.5g tank is way more difficult to control compared to a larger setup and as a 'noob' it may be difficult to manage variables that can swing out of control very easily in a such a small body of water."
PlantedTank,3ctbbv,zynu,2,Fri Jul 10 16:35:46 2015 UTC,I dose this with Flourish and liquid Iron about once a month and use under gravel tabs twice a year under the root feeders- other than that the fish take care of it all.

PlantedTank,3ctgbu,scottishpride,5,Fri Jul 10 17:13:15 2015 UTC,"I've always had sand-only in my bigger tanks because I have corydoras and kuhli loaches and they just love to dig around. Once I thought a loach was decapitated because there was a head on the sand, just a head... then it blinked. It had completely burried itself and was only peaking out with it's head. Freaked me out.  Annnyway... Vallisneria seems to do well, all cryptocoryne species should be fine though but they do love their clay/laterite balls (quite cheap stuff, can't overdose, just stick it next to the roots. Can make'm yourself, recipes online!). Then there are plants that don't even need substrate, like all the Java fern species and the Anubias ones. Tie'm to wood, stone or other things with a simple thread and you're good to go.   I clean my tanks with just a hose. If you put it too close to the sand you'll suck it up, so you have to be a bit careful to only suck up the poopies and not the sand. If you suck up sand but quickly put your thumb over the end of the hose, the water stops 'sucking' and the sand will just fall back. It's a bit of an art, but it's easy enough.  What else. I've always had internal filters (standard Juwel tanks), which worked fine. It indeed depends on the fish, if you want to keep a betta, then the flow might need to be muffled a bit because with the long draggy fins they can have a hard time otherwise, plus they just like still water. For most other fish the standard filters do fine really imo.  Also... for the love of everything that is holy in this world, do not use a magnet-cleaner. You will get sand between the glass and the cleaner at some point and it will scratch up your walls. Just use a plastic card, the credit card type things (I bet you have some lying about that you rarely use) to scrape off stuff before you do a water change.  Oh, and sand has a tendency to get a bit dense/clogged, so it helps if you run your fingers through the more open parts where there are no roots, to keep it from rotting.   Last but not least: don't get lazy when it comes to rinsing out the sand before you put it in the tank. Put it in a large bucket, stick the nozzle of your showerhead or gardenhose in and keep rinsing until the water becomes a bit see through. Put it in the tank, cover the whole bottom with a plastic bag, put a plate on top of that and slowely pour water on it. At some point the bag with start to float, that's fine. If you do this, you'll have pretty much clear water right away instead of looking at a sand storm for days.   I'm not excited about starting new tanks at all! :D"

I just went from a 15 gal to a 52 gal, which is the biggest I can go on my budget and with the space available (and without getting a divorce, I love him dearly though). What I notice right away is that practical things start coming into play. With the 15 gal I could easily mess with the bottom of the tank without a problem, with the new one I have to get on a step and then can barely reach the bottom with my fingertips (it's a square model).  So keep that in mind. If you want a tank with plants that need a lot of maintenance, especially the once you take out and replant the tops off (it's called 'making a street' here, used in Dutch style /Hollandse stijl tanks) that's going to be cumbersome. Especially if it's on a highish shelf to start with.  If you have the space.. go for a long tank instead of a tall or square one. Not just because of what I said before, but also because fish move horizontally, like birds. Vertical space only means a little to them, you'll have far more options for choosing fish when you go long.   If you have the cash, going for a high tech tank is awesome, but you don't need CO2 and all that for a planted tank. I never had CO2 and it does pose limits on which plants you can get and what you can achieve, but it's absolutely an option as well. The Dutch style tanks go decades back, way before the high tech systems, here is a picture of a heavily planted tank from 1966. A tank like that does take special knowledge and care in terms of substrate and maintenance though.   That's all I wanted to add really, my knowledge about bigger tanks is really limited too, let alone a 210-built-from-scratch beast! :D  Enjoy!"

I would say try the magnesium treatment with epsom salts. You never said how old your tank is.  Edit: in case you are interested- here is a paper on effect of ph on plant nutrient uptake:   The degree of ionization of minerals and other nutrients depends upon the hydrogen ion concentration of the soil solution.  For example, most of the phosphate ions, at alkaline pH exist either as bivalent H3PO4 ions or trivalent H3PO4 ions.  Such ions are not favored for absorption.  On the other hand neutral pH favors the absorption of monovalent ions.  So the soil pH has a significant effect not only on the rate but also the kind of ions uptake."

In the meantime the seller sent me new ones plus a few extra via USPS. I tried planting some of the greenparts in a dry start but it was already too late by the next day they had became a melted mush as well. Got the plants via USPS 2 days later and they were perfect. When I planted them I decided not to dry start and just flood the tank and do a co2 flood while it cycles. Ended up working very well.

PlantedTank,3cpx8u,2pacamaru,3,Thu Jul 9 23:27:43 2015 UTC,"I have recently returned some HC from a similar mushy state and have it sitting in a dry tank to recover.  I recommend the following to maximise from here (will need 3 jars):   Remove the mush from around the live leaves ASAP to stop the rot Plant the live plants (i.e. the leaves and roots) in to a jar with a nice substrate (I recommend propagating sand based on my current experience) Wet the rock wool containing the roots of the now-mushed leaves in to a jar and put the lid on. Put the jar outside in non-direct sunlight. Check back in a few weeks and you may get new growth you can delicately replant to cultivate.   As a bonus, put the mush aside in to another jar on top of substrate, spread it thinly and proceed as per the roots step above. You may get new growth from tiny leaves that are in there. Only a few drops of water for this though and remove mush that smells 'off'."
PlantedTank,3cpx8u,prototype__,2,Fri Jul 10 00:28:21 2015 UTC,I'd plant them in a pot and see if you can grow them like a dry start. I'm sure something will grow.

In a low light tank it is often due to changing CO2 levels.
PlantedTank,3coi2g,CorvisTheRed,4,Thu Jul 9 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"Further, your otos will not touch the stuff. You can spot treat it with hydrogen peroxide and then amano shrimp will eat it once it turns pink, providing they're hungry enough."
PlantedTank,3coi2g,cosalich,5,Thu Jul 9 16:13:50 2015 UTC,Test your phosphate levels. They're probably 0 and you need a little more 0.1-0.2mg/l for plants to do well. Your plants are leaking nutrients and the algae is there to pick it up.

PlantedTank,3cp8ee,DragonsInBowties,2,Thu Jul 9 18:45:49 2015 UTC,"It looks wonderful!   The only suggestion I have is to limit your lighting a little bit, as 13 hours is a bit much and very inviting for algae. Maybe a little afternoon siesta?"
PlantedTank,3cp8ee,DragonsInBowties,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:10:37 2015 UTC,What would be a more appropriate amount of time?  And can you explain the logic behind limiting your lighting? Given the proper nutrients photosynthesis should be able to continue no?
PlantedTank,3cp8ee,DragonsInBowties,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:08:05 2015 UTC,"I myself go with about 9 hours, with a 4 hour break during the brightest, and warmest part of the day. Most people say anywhere from 7-10 is what I've heard.   I'm still kind of a newbie at the hobby, so I'm not 100% sure of all the specifics, but algae will thrive if you leave the lights on too long, but given a ""siesta"" (for example, the 4 hour time off I give my lights is called a siesta) algae will die off and unable to grow during that time. Then, when you turn the lights back on in the afternoon/evening/whenever, the algae has to basically start growing all over again."
PlantedTank,3cp8ee,InterfectorFactory,2,Fri Jul 10 01:57:26 2015 UTC,"Ahh So the ""siesta"" is to prevent algae growth. I thought you were suggesting that prolonged exposure to light would be harmful to the plants. At the moment I have not have had any problem with algae so I am not too worried. Is algae a common problem in planted tanks? Even if they have shrimps?"
PlantedTank,3cp8ee,InterfectorFactory,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:24:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry about that! I could've made myself more clear. I don't believe it is harmful for the plants at all, but I don't really know that for sure.

PlantedTank,3crcly,kylificent,3,Fri Jul 10 03:50:49 2015 UTC,"Lighting is confusing to a lot of people, not just you.  Let me see if I can help.  The PAR value for a Marineland Double Bright in that size is 54 PAR @ 12"" (depth), 26 PAR @ 24"" (depth).  If your 55g is the standard shape and size, it's 20"" deep.  Let's say you have 3"" of substrate in the bottom.  At the top of your tank, you'll have HIGH light.  In the middle, you'll still have HIGH light.  At the very bottom of the tank you'll have HIGH to MEDIUM light, closer to MEDIUM (~43 PAR).

PlantedTank,3cqhm0,flinters17,3,Thu Jul 9 23:27:21 2015 UTC,"From what I have observed, they will do that when provided with a rich substrate to root in. In those conditions, they normally don't need the thick tubers to store nutrients in."

PlantedTank,3cqhm0,panquakez,2,Mon Jul 13 04:47:49 2015 UTC,I believe that plants prioritize the most productive roots to devote energy to. If some roots are in a spot where no or little resources are found then the plant might let it die to relocate its energy to more efficient and rewarding areas. This is just based on my observations so I'm probably wrong but that's my best guess!

PlantedTank,3cpe91,boltgunner,2,Thu Jul 9 18:30:35 2015 UTC,"aw hm 10 gal is really small for corydoras.. any chance of getting a bigger one, maybe second hand, when you're going to do an overhaul anyway?  If you want low tech low maintenance plants I can recommend any of the following:   cryptocoryne. Hardy, slow growing so no trimming and if you get the 'parva' it can look like a carpet. Stick some clay balls next to the roots and you don't even need any special stuff. Anubias. Also in different sizes and forms. Just tie them to something instead of planting them in the substrate.  Java fern. Also in different subspecies, also need to be tied to something.   The last two get their nutrition from the water column so dosing with some extra fertilizer once in a while is appreciated but not needed. Obviously you can re-use the plants you already have, I mean, why not! :)  As for your corydoras though... 'peppered' is not an official name and tons of cory species have dots. Please do me a super huge favor and check out Planet Catfish. Look for yours and read the description carefully. They are incredibly awesome fish, but as any other living being they have their own needs. One is enough space, two is the fact that they belong in a group of at least five or six.

PlantedTank,3cmpr7,prdycool,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:20:51 2015 UTC,Yes you can adjust the water flow and it is very quiet. You can slightly hear the motor but it's not bad at all. The water flowing is louder than the motor.

Hopefully someone with fertilizer experience will weight in."
PlantedTank,3cozl3,rustyisme123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:26:02 2015 UTC,I do water changes every Saturday. I do like 30-50 percent because I like to keep my nitrates low
PlantedTank,3cozl3,rustyisme123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"I would probably keep with the directed schedule then. I was thinking if you don't usually need water changes that often, you could probably  stretch your fertilizers out more."
PlantedTank,3cozl3,javamoss,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:54:33 2015 UTC,"Dosing depends on tank contents: high light and co2 with fast growing plants demand the first, while low light could be the second. Functionally you could just half the doses for a low light tank if you would prefer to dose daily.  EI dosing relies upon over dosing, so a water change is required to reset your tank to ""0"" on the 7th day.  You alter micro/macro dosing as it is said (but I have seen no real studies) that the macros interfere with micros to reduce their effectiveness (chelates some chemicals so plants can't absorb them)  What type of tank are you wanting to dose?"
PlantedTank,3cozl3,javamoss,2,Thu Jul 9 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"Right now I have no CO2 going, but I'm getting a whole CO2 set up at the end of this month.

I have a Finnex Planted 24/7 for lighting."
PlantedTank,3cozl3,javamoss,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:28:09 2015 UTC,What is it planted with? The only danger of over-dosing is that you will wind up with algae helping to consume your nutrients instead of just your plants.

PlantedTank,3cozl3,steamboatpilot,2,Thu Jul 9 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"I would recommend starting with the second option then for now, both of those are slower growing and will probably not be taking up enough nutrients to dose daily.   You can also use the test kit for nitrate to see how fast your plants take them up (test before adding, immediately after adding, and then at the end of the day for the next 2 days). That will give you a rough estimate of how much your tank is using, for the macros at least."
PlantedTank,3cnvxv,prototype__,10,Thu Jul 9 10:52:48 2015 UTC,"I always keep a healthy population in all of my freshwater tanks.  Contrary to what others have said, MTS only eat decaying plant matter and populations remain stable if you are not over feeding. There is also the added bonus of them stirring your substrate.

PlantedTank,3cnvxv,Brewchamp,2,Thu Jul 9 16:03:17 2015 UTC,"Stirring the substrate seems like asking for smaller  plants to be uprooted, no?"

PlantedTank,3ckt8f,nahfoo,2,Wed Jul 8 22:49:47 2015 UTC,Noobie here too but I believe you just fill up your tank with water using an air line tube or something of that size. It's just a really slow way of doing it but you don't disturb the substrate at all.
PlantedTank,3ckt8f,DragonsInBowties,2,Thu Jul 9 02:01:28 2015 UTC,Yep youre right!
PlantedTank,3ckt8f,nahfoo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:05:45 2015 UTC,"Ahh yes alright, that makes sense. I think it must be the same as drip acclimating new fish; tying a knot in the tube so only a drip, or a small amount comes out at once."
PlantedTank,3ckt8f,NegotiatingPenguin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:12:54 2015 UTC,Do you have anything separating the subatrates? If not they'll get mixed up real quick. Also the only thing I would change if you ever drain the tank is get a more natural sand color with little bits of gravel in it. I like paver sand
PlantedTank,3ckt8f,RiddleRiddle,2,Thu Jul 9 18:38:53 2015 UTC,What would you use to separate the substrates?
PlantedTank,3ckt8f,Finnex,2,Thu Jul 9 19:13:46 2015 UTC,Either small stones or peices of plastic. Maybe put the plastic in and have some small gravel along the birder to hide it. Maybe even the type of stone you already have in there. Put them on the bottom of the tank and create a little cliff where the ada soil (or whatever it is) is at the top and the sand on the bottom. I'm talking only like an inch and I know it would be a pain in the ass to change now. . Maybe you could siphon out the sand with some kind of filter that won't let the soil thru? Set up your dividers and then slowly put the sand back? I'm not sure. But you have an amazing scape there and the sand won't stay clean for too long
PlantedTank,3ckt8f,Hopczar420,2,Thu Jul 9 20:35:03 2015 UTC,Yeah i made some substrate dividers. I like the huge contrast in the white sand

Get a big tub and a cheap filter, fill it with water and let it cycle as you would normal tank—then you should be able to add it to your tank without worry.

PlantedTank,3cmcf2,ArtisticAquaMan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:41:49 2015 UTC,Nah it won't be too heavy it barely weighs anything for its size. And for weakening the center brace I can't say I've noticed any damage and I have two light strips on my tank.
PlantedTank,3cmcf2,MerfishAWAY,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:42:17 2015 UTC,"Not concerned about the weight of the light. Concerned about a 48in light basically drying out the plastic support brace 2nd and weakening it so that it breaks. Or my other option is buying to 24 inches and using the support brace as a way of holding up the two lights in the center. Doing this will avoid direct light contact with the center brace, in my head, would prevent it from drying out. Am I just overthinking this? haha"
PlantedTank,3cltpl,qaimoo,3,Wed Jul 8 22:25:35 2015 UTC,Heavily planted means that minimum 85% of the substrate is covered in plants. If you're truly going for walstad just fill that baby to the brim and let the competition begin.

Of the holy trinity (CO2/flow, lighting, ferts) ferts are by far the easiest.  Just pick a method and forget about it, spend your time messing with your CO2 and flow! Thats where the real benefit lies  edit: to clarify, I buy the powdered salts and mix them with some dechlorinated tapwater. If your tank is bigger than mine (so that the weekly doses aren't tiny), you can just directly spoon the dry salt into the tank."

PlantedTank,3cjr0q,javamoss,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't waste my money on that stuff as it seems completely bogus. Take for example this sentence taken directly from ADA's Penac P website    The increased ability for photosynthesis combined with the increased supply of nutrients allow the plants to build up enough reserves to produce natural antibodies that help protect them from disease and pests.   Plants don't produce antibodies. This seems like a huge gimmick to me. I bet at least one of those products simply has plant growth hormones in it, but who knows what is really in them as they don't tell you (but still charge an arm and leg).  DIY osmocote root tabs will cost you <20 for enough for a year or more (depending on tank sizes) and will be functionally equivalent to whatever proprietary stuff they're trying to get you to buy-plus you will know what's actually in them."

A quick look at the reviews is from folks with reef tanks, which I assume can handle higher intensity flows than a planted tank.  However, $10 is not a lot of money to lose if you buy it and it ends up being too powerful.    I have had good experiences with the koralia nano powerheads.  They are a bit more expensive, but they have a very secure magnetic attaching mechanism.

Third, they were grown open to the air meaning max C02, so you will have melting issues when placed in water. Don't  bother in my opinion."

PlantedTank,3cgqm0,DragonsInBowties,3,Wed Jul 8 01:17:14 2015 UTC,"It's easy actually... just takes some practice and trial and error.  Get yourself two bottles and two little packs of tubing. Drill 1 hole in the cap of bottle 1, two holes in the cap of bottle two. Bottle #2 is needed to remove the crappy sugar water that might get sucked through.Make sure the holes are slightly smaller than the diameter of the tubing.  Get a wire cutter or a pair of pliers and scissors. Cut both ends of tube #1 at a 45 degree angle so you have kind of a /___ shape at both ends. Use the pliers to pull the tips from the top of the cap through the bottom of the cap. Do this for both bottle #1 and bottle #2 caps.  Now basically do the same thing, only cut ONE end of the second tube like I explained. Pull the pointy end through the top of bottle #2's second hole. Run this line to the tank.  I advise you to incorporate a check valve somewhere in the process to prevent a siphon from going the other way. To do that, just cut one of the tubes and stick the check valve where you cut them.  OK there's your rig. Now the reaction.  In bottle #1, add a cup of sugar and fill the bottle 2/3 of the way with warm filtered, non chlorinated water.  The confusing part is the baking soda and the yeast. The baking soda keeps your yeast munching longer.  The amount of yeast you add is important and takes some trial and error... the more yeast, the more bubbles. I'd start with a 1 tsp of both in a 1L bottle, and maybe 1/4 tsp in a pop bottle size bottle. Again, this is trial and error so don't throw this DIY system directly into your tank.   If you have a sensitive tank with lots of crazy ass plants, a DIY system is not going to be good. However, if you're using some hardy plants, it's extremely cheap to supplement CO2 this way. Liquid CO2 sometimes kicks the shit out of some plants for some reason.  Edit: Added some clarifications."

Anything that says ""medium"" or ""high"" maintenance, don't trust your ability to keep the yeast/sugar gravy train moving. If you're sticking to the typical java moss, wisteria, horwort, anacharis, anubias, etc then you probably don't need a pressurized CO2 system in most cases.

PlantedTank,3ciiw8,raowr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:26:26 2015 UTC,"Both images seem like the same setup to me, although I recommend using an inline CO2 reactor to maximize efficiency. Personally I don't use that setup, I put inlet/outlet each on the right and left corners at the back of the tank purely for aesthetics. Your pictures will provide better flow in a rectangular style tank though."
PlantedTank,3ciiw8,phyzzix,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:47:23 2015 UTC,"i think one picture has the inflow at the front of the tank and outflow at the back of the tank, while the other has both inflow/outflow in the same corner in the front of the tank.  the one where the inflow/outflow are in different corners is supposed to create a circular flow when looking down on the tank while the other is supposed to create a circular flow from top to bottom, if that makes any sense.  I dunno if it really makes that much of a difference"
PlantedTank,3ciiw8,specialFX16,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:29:27 2015 UTC,I know this is no help at all but what did you end up doing because I am in the same boat as you are. I saw something that water agitation can cause co2 loss so I dunno what I'm going to do.
PlantedTank,3chlc1,roccscout,3,Tue Jul 7 23:39:14 2015 UTC,Personally I use a planted+ and a planted+24/7 on my high tech 29g but it's heavily planted including floaters. Looks great.

PlantedTank,3cgnbs,xxoczukxx,3,Tue Jul 7 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"One thing I have noticed in hydroponics, fruit trees, aquarium plants and even houseplants is that if you make the plant work a bit to get to the water you will get a more robust root system in less time. In order to keep down white stringy fungus and other nastiness that comes along with DSM, I recommend keeping the water as low as possible without killing the plants. Spray bottle helps."
PlantedTank,3cgnbs,phyzzix,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:01:02 2015 UTC,ohhh ok making it works makes sense but i just wish i could see where the water level is :/ its hard to tell with this black sand. i am misting with a spray bottle already :)

If you're high tech you can inject CO2 now which means you wont need to open up the top to replace the air (as much). So, humidity is maintained with less water. Check daily for mold!!!"

Has the benefit of also generating CO2 thanks to the marble."
PlantedTank,3cceg7,thrownaway21,2,Wed Jul 8 12:34:38 2015 UTC,How do these get placed in the tank? Do you lay the aqua soil first or mix certain ones together?
PlantedTank,3cceg7,ISaidGame,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:25:11 2015 UTC,Depends on how you want your layout to be. If it's going to be relatively flat or slightly banked up you put your power sand down first followed but the aqua soil and lastly your powder. I want to essentially try and make 2 almost towers in the back corners of my tank to form a canyon more or less so I'll be pre mixing the power sand and aqua soil before putting it in the tank

PlantedTank,3cfgvy,gerwen,3,Tue Jul 7 19:31:54 2015 UTC,"In my 55 gallon, I went for a substrate base at least 3 inches deep since it's a lot easier planting in a thick substrate. I think I used 6 20-lb bags."

PlantedTank,3cfgvy,spongerat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:18:26 2015 UTC,ive been told 1lb per gallon for a 1in bed but not sure how accurate that is though. If its a standard shape tank and you only want about an inch of bed then im sure 60lb would be just fine and 80lb would be more than safe is my guess
PlantedTank,3cfgvy,WRXtra,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:56:09 2015 UTC,I put 60 lbs in my 29 gallon and I have roots above the substrate within 4 months.

PlantedTank,3cdgca,bowmaster17,2,Tue Jul 7 02:11:18 2015 UTC,Green water is a bloom of freeswimming unicellular algae. Baby microcrabs can only eat this extremely tiny food.

PlantedTank,3ccpqr,cmunk13,3,Tue Jul 7 01:24:18 2015 UTC,honestly in my case its because its easier and i think itll look nice. one main filtration system with a couple of heaters to cover the main tank and a nice like split look system going on that fits nicely together instead of just a bunch of tanks strewn about  there are downsides such as if one tank gets a problem they all do. if theres a bacterial problem i really cant prevent it from getting from one tank to the next

PlantedTank,3ccpqr,Knox21,2,Tue Jul 7 02:06:44 2015 UTC,You will more than likely have to do it yourself. That being said I bet you could make something like this work http://www.djrice.net/acrylic/IMG_4981Dividers.JPG  Possibly just get some very fine plastic mesh to cover the openings so they can't get through
PlantedTank,3ccpqr,Knox21,2,Mon Jul 6 22:20:15 2015 UTC,hmmm i see thats  a good idea. i wanted something like the video because his glass somehow had like mesh little plug things and i thought that was cool so i could have a canister on the tank for heavy filtration needs and then like a sponge in each compartment. but if i bought glass im not sure how id do the plug thing but now i realized cuz of you that i can actually just buy special pieces like that!
PlantedTank,3ccpqr,Knox21,2,Mon Jul 6 22:30:56 2015 UTC,"If you have the means to drill the glass then you can go to your local hardware store and find plastic grommets to fit the holes and then silicone in the mesh, hopefully they have ones already with the mesh attached almost like a shower hair stopper."

PlantedTank,3ccpqr,Knox21,2,Mon Jul 6 22:42:02 2015 UTC,In my experience Lowes will only do straight cuts on glass/acrylic but anything is possible. You can always look for a glass/window company in your area and ask them for a quote as well.
PlantedTank,3ccpqr,TheKolbrin,2,Mon Jul 6 23:18:35 2015 UTC,Honestly if worst comes to worst ill just buy crafting mesh and hot glue it in places as dividers :/ im not looking to spend too much on this project and i feel like custom cut glass would be pricey
PlantedTank,3ccpqr,TheKolbrin,3,Mon Jul 6 23:24:22 2015 UTC,keep in mind baby shrimp are fucking tiny. craft mesh won't even register as a barrier to less than a month old shrimp. you almost need a fabric material to really keep them separated.
PlantedTank,3ccpqr,Enivel19,2,Tue Jul 7 01:16:46 2015 UTC,yea thats why i was apprehensive of doing a makeshift barrier instead of like a glass one like in the video :/ i think im going to try to find a better suited material for it or like try some sort of pantyhose-over-mesh type thing

The needle valve must have been faulty, because I went to turn on the gas on day 2 and the entire canister was empty. I tried another canister thinking that perhaps it was just a fluke, and on day 3 the entire new cylinder had emptied completely.  My LFS very graciously took the product back and issued a full refund.  I hope you have better luck than I did with the Ista system. I read a few Amazon reviews for their product line and it appears that Ista, a chinese company, offers next to no customer service when problems arrive... Just a ""contact us"" form on the website."

PlantedTank,3ca5ni,friskycrow,19,Mon Jul 6 08:26:04 2015 UTC,"Looks really nice. The only issue is that you'll either need to: rehome the angels when they grow larger, or upgrade your tanks due to the same issue."
PlantedTank,3ca5ni,IllusionOfHatred,17,Mon Jul 6 09:10:08 2015 UTC,"It is absolutely stunningly beautiful.  That being said... 15 gal tall is too small for angels. Fish are like birds, they use space horizontally. Now angels do need a fair bit of height as well, but a 15 gal is always too small for them, long or tall. If I were you I'd rehome them and go for shrimps to be honest. Even tiny fish need their horizontal space."
PlantedTank,3ca5ni,Astilaroth,9,Mon Jul 6 09:25:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I couldn't agree more about the size being too small for angelfish. This is just a temporary home for these boys and girls until I get the stand build for the 30gal. I'm primarily a betta fanatic, but these were a rescue from a neglectful neighbor. They were in a 10gal. A couple had some fin damage. Good news is that they are growing back. I'd only ever had angels when I was a little kid so it's been fun researching on something new. Once I get these guys over to the 30 gal. It will then become the new home for a lucky betta."
PlantedTank,3ca5ni,Astilaroth,2,Mon Jul 6 10:33:21 2015 UTC,"Oooh hop over to /r/bettafish, i always love seeing propely planted tanks there!  Wondering though... i just started a 52 square tank and I'm not sure about rehoming my betta to it because it's quite high compared to where he's in now (3/4 filled 15 gal long). The flow is strongest at the top (Juwel inner filter) and with the long fins I'm worried that he can't keep up near the surface. Do you have any experience with that?"
PlantedTank,3ca5ni,Astilaroth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:21:38 2015 UTC,I do. What tail type is he? Any current will be hard for them to feed or make a bubble nest in. I keep my in-flow as gentle as possible and usually have a big leaf plant for my betta's to rest on.
PlantedTank,3ca5ni,ShinyCard255,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:38:59 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm not sure. I rescued him and at that point he barely had fins, even had rot on his body. He looks like a crown tail now but has some dragon like spikes too. They're long and flowey either way, hence my worries. His current tank is low depth and a weak shrimp filter, with large leafed plants and floating plants. He makes bubble nests more and more."
PlantedTank,3ca5ni,ShinyCard255,3,Tue Jul 7 04:45:51 2015 UTC,I still feel that a 30G is too small for Angels. The smallest I'd recommend is a 40 Breeder. A 55G or 60G would be ideal
PlantedTank,3ca5ni,iamnotchris,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:48:25 2015 UTC,You make a valid point. So a crude estimate would be roughly 10 gals per angel since they become so territorial?
PlantedTank,3ca5ni,ShinyCard255,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's a good rough estimate. I've got 5 angels in a 60G with a school of tetras"

PlantedTank,3ca5ni,isukatusernames,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:08:47 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say close to adult size. I've had them for little over a year now. No, none have paired up yet. Been keeping an eye on them just in case."
PlantedTank,3ca5ni,delightfullysquishy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:40:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's mostly about minimal size for a full-grown angel. Something about the size of 120x40x50cm would make it easy for even a group of these fish, with 40x50 width\height being most important. In a tank that size, a group of 4-5 angels could probably live without much squabbling outside breeding."

PlantedTank,3camox,TheKolbrin,3,Tue Jul 7 02:13:08 2015 UTC,All the show tanks are only set up for a short period of time. I feel like if you did this on all three sides like that you'd have some crazy algae problems.
PlantedTank,3camox,kstarks17,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:09:53 2015 UTC,Algae need on average about 5 solid hours of light for a full photosynthesis. A longer time period than regular aquarium plants. If he only had them on for a couple of hours in the evenings it would not be too bad.
PlantedTank,3camox,munkyz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:39:54 2015 UTC,"I've read that a few places as well but have never come up with a concrete answer. I always find multiple sources saying algae needs at least 4-5 consecutive hours to photosynthesize.  I've also read consecutive hours doesn't matter at all.  I even tried to break up an 8 hour photoperiod into 4 two hour periods with two hours in between. My algae ""problem"" (a little bit on some driftwood that actually looks quite pretty) didn't really change i.e. there was no algae die off at all after 3 months.    Long story short. I think broken up photo periods can help slow algae but it won't prevent it or kill it. And I definetely think pounding the sides of your tank as well as the top with light for any significant time will grow some pretty intense algae (depending on the lights of course)"
PlantedTank,3camox,faust15,2,Tue Jul 7 01:49:29 2015 UTC,"i have the same photoperiod as you, 2x 4 hours with 2 hours in between, no algae. :) just have to scrub them off then do the lighting period. just need to balance ferts and turn the co2 up,  might be because i have some UV light to kill of algae and bacteria + 1 big filter and 2 small ones for flow. plus a lot of duckweed and moss which competes alot for the same nutrients as the algae. gooluck on getting rid of them, unless you like them,"

PlantedTank,3canse,stinkypinky12,9,Mon Jul 6 12:34:54 2015 UTC,Get a big rubber maid tub and empty your old tank water into it. Put fish in the tub and throw a heater in as well. Take your old tank down and place your new tank in its place. Assemble your new tank and filter but use your old filter too. After a month you could remove your old filter. I would do frequent water changes to since your new tank won't be fully cycled yet.
PlantedTank,3canse,Smellysocks23,3,Mon Jul 6 13:18:45 2015 UTC,This is a great idea.  I'd also add a second bucket and submerge the filter material in water to keep the bacteria alive while you're working on the new tank.

PlantedTank,3canse,ERIFNOMI,6,Mon Jul 6 21:14:51 2015 UTC,Have you thought about running the old and new filter at the same time? It would hopefully decrease the cycle time significantly.
PlantedTank,3canse,kidant,3,Mon Jul 6 13:18:59 2015 UTC,"I've done this before to seed a filter-- it took me about a month of both running side by side until I was comfortable removing the old one. But this way, since your old filter is damaged, if it breaks on you then you know you've got a backup filter already running and turning the water over at least. I'd also seed the new filter with some media from the old one to help the bacteria take root. Also, move any ornaments, rocks, etc that you have in the old tank into the new one, even if it's temporary. If you can put some substrate in a mesh bag and throw that in a filter or in the tank, too, then do that. Bring over as much of the bacteria from the old tank as you can. And obviously only rinse/wash things with tank water, no tap water."

PlantedTank,3canse,TotesMessenger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:05:58 2015 UTC,"I would get the new filter and set it up on your current tank for a couple weeks before doing anything else. Then, get a spare tank to hold fish for a few days and maybe set it up on the floor. Put the new filter on there and dose it with ammonia. Check to make sure the filter is cycled, and the ammonia is turning to nitrates. By seeing the moves filter in the current tank for a week or two, you can cut down on the cycling tinge dramatically. Don't count on it being cycled any sooner, and be sure to dechlorinate your tap water or you risk wiping out the new bacteria colony.  Once you have verified the filter is cycling, net the fish into the temporary tank and toss in any hard scape and plants. Be sure to lightly rinse everything you are moving over to get any loose dirt off - the last thing you want is an ammonia spike in the temporary tank. I'd do daily water changes on the temporary tank no matter what you think the water quality is.   Now tear down the original tank and do your thing. Be sure to do water tests, make sure the newly planted tank is still cycling, and all that typical stuff before putting the fish back in. I would keep the old filter running on the original tank this entire time."

PlantedTank,3cbehx,DwNlD_GK,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:25:23 2015 UTC,In my experience large water changes are not an issue as long as you are reasonably careful with temperature and dechlorinator.  I change roughly 60% every 3-4 weeks and the fish show no signs of distress.  There have been threads where people claim to do 60%-80% water changes without problems.  As long as you are doing regular maintenance the chemistry from the tap will probably match the tank fairly well.  If the tank water has been sitting for several months I would be more careful with a large water change.

Don't tie too tight to hurt the roots, just enough to hold the plant there till it grows and attaches itself.  Or you can use fishing line, and cut it and remove it in a few months.

PlantedTank,3c8fro,aoideos,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:44:27 2015 UTC,"So it seems nitrification process hasn't begun, my guess is that between no substrate and only a sponge filter your bacteria doesn't have anywhere to grow. A filter squeeze from your cycled tank is probably a good idea and maybe a small dose of ammonia but I'm not sure that will start a colony. Maybe next time you do a water change switch it with your other tanks water."
PlantedTank,3c8fro,RiddleRiddle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:13:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, Im due for a water change so Ill try that. Would keeping one of the snails in there help with the cycling? Ive been getting a tinsy bit of hair algae lately. Do nitrites affect invertebrates?"
PlantedTank,3c8fro,RiddleRiddle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"Snails should be ok, they will add to the nitrites which would be good for cycling but you don't need more nitrites. The hair algae is a good sign, it means there are some nitrates being provided which means you have some bacteria at least, unless hair algae can grow from nitrites which I'm unsure of.  Hopefully the tank water switch will be the tipping point for no more nitrites though."
PlantedTank,3c8fro,Astilaroth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:30:21 2015 UTC,"noooo noo do not touch your filter!  you're basically halfway through your cycle so this is all going according to plan! This is a nitrite spike, the thing that kills fish in inexperienced users who don't cycle their tank.  What happens is that at first ammonia is introduced to a tank (fish poo, food, rotting leaves). Bacteria in your filter convert that to nitrite. Other bacteria convert nitrite to nitrate. As soon as you start reading nitrate as well you'll notice the nitrite will start to drop.  If anything, add a bit of food or other stuff that can release ammonia so the cycle keeps going and the bacteria culture in your filter can get up to full strength for when you're going to introduce fish.  You're doing great! :D"
PlantedTank,3c8fro,oldmanfris,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:39:00 2015 UTC,"i had the same thing in a new tank.  60% water changes multiple times a week, but my nitrates were high for almost 3 weeks.  i finally gave up and got another canister filter, took media from an established tank and it's been fine ever since.     how long should sponge filters take to get established?  from what little i know about filtration, seems bacteria is slow to grow.  the anaerobic bacteria even slower and what breaks down the nitrate.  since the sponge filter has a steady flow of water all over, will it ever support the anaerobic bacteria?"
PlantedTank,3c8fro,Astilaroth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:16:11 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the different bacteria kinds, but in general it can take 3 weeks or more to cycle a tank. However,  that also depends on the amount if ammonia that's introduced during the cycling. And do slowly build up your stock, if you cycle perfectly but then add a ton of fish all at once, the bacteria culture will be too small to keep up with all the new ammonia and your parameters might get wonky again before it settles down."
PlantedTank,3c83mm,Im5andwhatisthis,5,Sun Jul 5 20:00:58 2015 UTC,Cut down on your photo period to around 8 hours. It should help with the algae problem.
PlantedTank,3c83mm,tmango1215,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:40:50 2015 UTC,"Alright, will try that to start. When to adjust it back closer to 12, or do I just keep it at 8 from now on? Also, will the S. repens be fine with 8h, or would they need more?"
PlantedTank,3c83mm,tmango1215,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:49:57 2015 UTC,"All of my plants, including s. repens. are fine with 7 hours. Its all about finding the balance between light, co2 injection, and fert dosing."
PlantedTank,3c83mm,tmango1215,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:51:23 2015 UTC,"Cool. So if I was to add that CO2 system at any point, would I be looking at increasing photoperiod a little to match up with that, for more photosynthesis/growth?"
PlantedTank,3c83mm,CalvinFromVietnam,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't increase the photo period. In fact, I break mine up, 4 hours on, 1 off, for a total of 8 hours in a 24-hour period. Any more, I start to get algae growth."
PlantedTank,3c74bk,rustyisme123,3,Sun Jul 5 14:22:17 2015 UTC,"not in my experience but I am not an expert. All I know is once i got the CO2 and the lighting right, things started working as they were supposed to. Up to that point, they didn't."
PlantedTank,3c74bk,Extempo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:33:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I've seen a lot of growth on my other plants while using it, but I just got a bigger space and am trying to get my dhg to carpet. I'll probably have to step up into the big leagues for that. Going to keep up on excel and diy co2 for a bit before I do the cash dump."
PlantedTank,3c74bk,Slongo702,3,Sun Jul 5 14:42:41 2015 UTC,It goes like this:  Excel<DIY CO2<Pressurized CO2
PlantedTank,3c74bk,davdev,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:06:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, my thoughts exactly. Diy can put out a lot of co2, but it is not easily metered. I've been using excel with diy co2 with good results. Hopefully this, with my new lights will be sufficient for growing my dhg carpet."
PlantedTank,3c74bk,yosemighty_sam,5,Sun Jul 5 21:44:56 2015 UTC,"Its better than nothing, but no where close to injection.  The main issue, is all the carbon gets dumped and used up in a relatively short time, while injection provides a constant carbon source.  Excel is fine in a low tech dirt tank, but would never be any where close to adequate in a high tech tank"
PlantedTank,3c74bk,davdev,6,Sun Jul 5 15:01:14 2015 UTC,Isn't injection the definition of high tech?
PlantedTank,3c74bk,aoideos,2,Sun Jul 5 15:05:26 2015 UTC,"Lightening as well.  Some people think high light and excel will work, and then they get an algae bloom."

PlantedTank,3c74bk,ArtisticAquaMan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:46:30 2015 UTC,"What's your light?  Hairgrass is a PITA.  Too little light and it won't grow, too much light and it gets covered in algae.  If you can properly balance, ferts, light and CO2, it will grow fine, but excel won't get it, usually and I have never been happy with DIY CO2, too much fluctuation and zero control."

After a month it's sending out runners like crazy, and I've heard it grows like an absolute weed with CO2 injection. It's just a slow grower without it."
PlantedTank,3c74bk,javamoss,2,Mon Jul 6 02:46:32 2015 UTC,Carpeting would be tough with excel it's great for just swords or other low light plants but I'd rather try dig co2 with a co2 tank.
PlantedTank,3c74bk,richcreations,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:48:21 2015 UTC,Excel is great for very small tanks where injection would be overkill. But on a large tank it's way more trouble and way more expensive than its worth.  It's also quite lethal to invertebrates. If you want shrimp and co2 you should inject.
PlantedTank,3c74bk,javamoss,2,Sun Jul 5 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"Whoa! Lethal to inverts? Never heard that one. I got 16 rcs in my 20 long that I have been dosing with excel. No dead shrimp yet, but it's only been two weeks. You think low doses will kill them?"
PlantedTank,3c74bk,richcreations,6,Sun Jul 5 15:23:11 2015 UTC,"Your shrimp will be fine if you're dosing at recommended levels. Some people like to double the dose in their tanks, but that would likely cause some shrimp to die."

PlantedTank,3c7izq,dtagged,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding correctly you're not doing CO2 or special lights? In that case I can recommend plants like:   Vallisneria Cryptocoryne Anubias Javafern   All three come in different subspecies and thus sizes and shapes. Crypto's can really appreciate some clay balls near their roots but that's cheap and easy enough to do. Anubias and Javaferns shouldn't be planted in the substrate, but are better of tied to something like wood or stone. Vallisneria comes in straight and spiral forms, in a very large form and some smaller ones.  If you want to go for a carpet look you could get the cryptocoryne parva, which is tiny and slow growing, but doesn't need all the fancy stuff the usual carpet plants need.  I'm from the Netherlands, there are several awesome webshops here (average cost of a plant is around 2-3 euro, about 2.22-3.33 dollar). They do mention shipping outside of the country on their website, but the examples for shipping costs they give are all within Europe. If you want you could mail them to ask if they ship to where you live or I could ask for you. They don't have an English website but it all has pictures and the official/Latin names, so you should be okay picking plants anyway.  http://www.aquarium-planten.com/"

PlantedTank,3c689s,oldmanfris,3,Sun Jul 5 07:40:39 2015 UTC,"nice find!  you might want a few new plants, start by picking out a few at your local pet store.  once you get the feel to adding plants, step up to buying plants online.  greater variety and about the same price.  only thing w/ online plants is they might have snails, so you may want to start a secondary quarantine tank.  this will come in handy once you start adding new fish too.   eventually, this will just become your second tank, so prepare for the 3rd tank.   by this time your plants will be well established but you may want to improve how thick they are or move to more difficult growing plants.  time for upgraded lights, CO2 and fertilizers!    next will be a reevaluation of your filtration.  i find 2 canisters impossible to beat on a tank, never have to worry about your levels again.  oops, forgot about testing kits!  ammonia, nitrite and nitrate are your big ones.  but you'll also want to test your ph, kh and gh.   by now, you've converted a room to a fish room.  you may want to consider a serious air pump for all the tanks and a reverse osmosis system for water changes.  i need help"
PlantedTank,3c689s,conklech,5,Mon Jul 6 01:44:18 2015 UTC,Have patience; only bad things happen quickly in this hobby. You'll lose plants and fish; it's OK. Take good pictures and good notes. You usually want light to be the limiting factor for growth. Hang out at http://plantedtank.net/forums.
PlantedTank,3c689s,s3rca,2,Sun Jul 5 05:52:02 2015 UTC,It could be the lighting but it looks like the whole front edge of the tank isn't supported by anything. I would definitely find a better stand
PlantedTank,3c689s,adambulb,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:04:30 2015 UTC,"Uh, you might want to check your ammonia/nitrate/nitrite levels. It looks like all your fish are at the top and gasping for air. Did you cycle your tank before adding fish?"
PlantedTank,3c689s,IllusionOfHatred,-1,Sun Jul 5 14:14:15 2015 UTC,I would wait for a better setup personally.. unless if you're interested in doing a planted tank with tiger barbs.. the red tail will need to be given away at some point.
PlantedTank,3c5esy,sleeplessweseem,3,Sat Jul 4 23:36:12 2015 UTC,Are those the same as the Blue Gills I catch fishing in washington? Or an aquarium hobby breed?
PlantedTank,3c5esy,WAemsFishGuy,3,Sun Jul 5 01:45:24 2015 UTC,Looks like the blue gill you are familiar with to me.
PlantedTank,3c5esy,boredincubicle,2,Sun Jul 5 01:55:09 2015 UTC,I remember blue gills being the only fish I could catch when I was a little kid.  The other fishes were too smart or too wary to bite onto the hook attached to bright yellow electrical wire.

PlantedTank,3c5esy,Califish,2,Sun Jul 5 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"Cool. I've been doing native collecting for a while now. I know it's a challenge, but I like replicating native habitats and seeing when the creatures living in the waters around me are like up close and not on a hook.  Did you collect the sunfish and blue gill yourself?  On a side note, all I could think of when I read ""blue gill"" was someone posting on the feasibility of keeping a baby Bluefin."
PlantedTank,3c5esy,SuramKale,3,Sun Jul 5 03:47:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I found him along with many others in a small puddle near a creek bed that had dried.

PlantedTank,3c6ejl,electricallycharged,5,Sun Jul 5 07:13:58 2015 UTC,"Small tanks are always tricky, maybe hop over to /r/jarrariums to get some extra info, the folks there are used to small aquatic spaces. Like /u/rustyisme123 says, a lot of the options will depend on how low or high tech you're planning to go. For a Walstad set up you'll need different plants than if you go full out with technique.  If you want an easy plant that can do without super fancy light and CO2 I can recommend cryptocoryne species. They're slow growing so they won't overtake the tiny tank either and the shrimps will love foraging between the leaves. If you get the cryptocoryne parva you can even get the 'carpet' look. With moss in a low tech tank you easily 'risk' that they start growing vertically which is a hassle if you want a flat carpet structure.   So yeah... decide on the technique first and go from there really."
PlantedTank,3c6ejl,Astilaroth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:21:15 2015 UTC,"I second Cryptocoryne, I have some Cryptocoryne Petchii in my 2.5 gallon and they are doing quite well. Also dwarf sag is nice and may create a loose carpet look after a while. For non rooted plants java fern and anubias work well tied to something or weighted down with a rock. If you're next to a window or have algae issues try dropping in some floater plants like Salvinia Minima, their roots are short and wont dangle too long."
PlantedTank,3c6ejl,DroneBBQ,2,Sun Jul 5 18:23:11 2015 UTC,"You will have a hard time getting a grass looking plant to grow into a carpet without extra light and co2. I like dwarf hair grass for that. Java moss, on the other hand, is super easy to grow. Doesn't look quite as ""grassy"" but if you don't want to mess with a more Hi tech set up, that's your best bet.  As far as flowering plants for your bowl, I know that they do exist. Could not for the life of me tell you what they are.   The only problem I see with you putting shrimp in the bowl is that it is a small vessel and will have temperature swings. We're you planning on using a filter? Not sure you have to if heavily planted. What about light?"

PlantedTank,3c20ey,clap_yo_hands,2,Sat Jul 4 16:16:34 2015 UTC,I'm currently boiling the ever-loving piss out of my driftwood. How long did it take you to make the tannins manageable visually?
PlantedTank,3c20ey,Shills_for_fun,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:22:13 2015 UTC,How does boiling affect the wood? Does it make it soft?  I have large chunk of driftwood that has been in my tank for 12 years.  It's gotten soft and crumbly but my fish love to chew at it.  When I prepped it I soaked it in a 5 gallon bucket weighed down by a brick for 6 weeks doing a water change and rinse every week.  It took that long for it to become waterlogged so it wouldn't float.  It probably took an additional 6 weeks in my aquarium before it stopped turning my water into tea.  I never thought about boiling it.
PlantedTank,3c20ey,Tatekei,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:10:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't really noticed a difference between hardness in the dry state. I kind of boiled it immediately so I couldn't tell you what effect it has as far as softening goes.  Boiling is just meant to speed up the tannin leaching process. I'm probably on my 10th boil and still getting lots of tea. Hopefully I can get it down to a ""yellowing"" level versus a ""browning"" level before I add it to my 10g."
PlantedTank,3c20ey,Turtlesass,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:24:10 2015 UTC,Honestly I didn't boil or nothing. I just rinsed with the garden hose. The lfs had it drilled to a huge piece of slate. So boiling wasn't on option. I would say my water was brownish looking for about a week. My carbon filter on my hob was toast after words haha.
PlantedTank,3c20ey,NinlyOne,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:58:36 2015 UTC,Make sure to switch to biomedia otherwise the carbon will remove nutrients from the water the plants want. Purigen bag works better then carbon for tannins.  Also. Put your airstone at the bottom of the aquarium. It will aerate better.
PlantedTank,3c20ey,Turtlesass,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:07:32 2015 UTC,Bio media? I am using a Marineland penguin 250. (I think it's 250)
PlantedTank,3c20ey,Turtlesass,0,Sat Jul 4 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"Use a sponge, ceramic rings, and aquarium stuffing/fluff. And then use purigen if you still have tannins in the water"
PlantedTank,3c20ey,Astilaroth,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:30:18 2015 UTC,"The Penguin filters have their own ""BioWheel"" modules for biofiltration, which I'd guess op is already using (right op? spinny things spinning?). They also have extra slots for mechanical and/or carbon filter inserts that can be used or left empty."
PlantedTank,3c20ey,stellersjay,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:37:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had one like that before, was just saying to use that stuff too in case you need extra seeded media for emergencies for yourself or a friend. And even with the wheel you should still use a sponge and filter floss. Part of the point of a filter is to actually filter the water   And plus the purigen in there will work better than carbon because activated carbon pulls nutrients from the water that are needed for plants"
PlantedTank,3c20ey,CalvinFromVietnam,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:10:40 2015 UTC,Are you suggesting buying a reusable mess mag and buying some purigen? And sticking that in the slots where the original carbon packs go?
PlantedTank,3c20ey,CalvinFromVietnam,0,Sun Jul 5 22:49:50 2015 UTC,"In two of my hang on the backs I have I thick sponge layer at the bottom, one that will collect dirt, then I have ceramic rings in a mesh bag and then in another mesh bag I have filter floss, which looks almost like pillow stuffing. Once a month, sometimes more I take it all out and rinse it all in old tank water usually replacing the floss while I'm at it.  I personally don't need purigen anymore but I would just layer that in too when I used it  But yes I suggest not using them because it's more expensive, won't filter as well, and carbon is usually a no no for planted tanks"
PlantedTank,3c20ey,CalvinFromVietnam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:51:58 2015 UTC,Is there any way I can see a picture of that? Haha. Cause my penguin filter doesn't seem big enough for all of that.
PlantedTank,3c20ey,CalvinFromVietnam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:56:59 2015 UTC,"I never boiled mine, if you have active coal in your filter it will filter out a lot for you  (although i usually recommend against coal filter material because it also filters out stuff your plants use). Optically you can use a blue light to make the water appear less brown.  If it all fails you can always embrace the beauty of black water tanks! ;)"

PlantedTank,3c20ey,Astilaroth,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:24:12 2015 UTC,You can use purigen to get rid of tannins
PlantedTank,3c20ey,Astilaroth,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:52:48 2015 UTC,It's pretty awesome. Loving the driftwood. I think if i would make any changes I would just focus everything around the driftwood. You know what I mean?
PlantedTank,3c20ey,Astilaroth,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:30:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm hoping when the moss starts to cover the wood and the dwarf hair grass grows thicker it will fill in the gaps. Lol really I was just trying to hide the heater and air lines. :p
PlantedTank,3c20ey,Astilaroth,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:33:53 2015 UTC,Haha. i just got a new tank with a built in filter and it's amazing not seeing the heater and what  not.

PlantedTank,3c09tu,BigDeady,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:22:01 2015 UTC,"Well they didn't exactly eat it, because all of it was sucked into my surface skimmer so I had to clean it, but I think it was the barbs, but honestly could have been any of them since all my fish tend to cruise around at the bottom."
PlantedTank,3c09tu,BigDeady,7,Sat Jul 4 10:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just gave up on baby tears, fish eat it, algae takes it over, it doesn't root, screw that noise, I'm cool with glosso that takes over my tank in two weeks, or staurogyne that grows even if you cut every leaf off."
PlantedTank,3c09tu,BigDeady,2,Fri Jul 3 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"Staurogyne is awesome. Those are the big ones in the back, in the 2nd picture, never thought they would grow that tall though, considering the amount of light and Co2 that I have, but alas they have, so now I have to trim them. I thought they would stay at like 5cm/2inch with lots of light and Co2 :/"
PlantedTank,3c09tu,slidewithme,2,Fri Jul 3 17:24:03 2015 UTC,Yeah you have to pummel them with warm whites if you want them to stay short.  I built my own led light and I just bought some warmer LEDs to add to my set up because they are starting to grow taller than the glosso.
PlantedTank,3c09tu,Phillsen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"Warm whites huh, didn't think the color temp of the lamps had an impact on that. Where did you hear/read that?  But one of my fixtures is 2x warm bulbs, and the other fixture is 2x colder ones - currently the colder ones are on the Staurogyne so maybe I should try and switch them around and see what happens.  Got any other tips on how to get them to stay low? I read on a forum that you could nip off the ""center leaves"" on the plant to encourage them to stay low and bushy. Whatever ""center leaves"" mean. I'm guessing just the leaves on the middle of the plant?  Only thing I want to avoid is what happened to my last stem-plants, they grew too tall, I had to trim them, and then they started spreading like crazy in the trimmed part of the plant, so they grew in a Y shape which then blocked all light to the lower parts of the plant."
PlantedTank,3c09tu,goots,3,Fri Jul 3 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"well unfortunately you cannot stop the hydra effect with trimming plants, but you can trim them more often, stopping the horizontal and vertical growth all together.    As for the ""leaves in the center"", I'm not exactly sure what that means either, but I do know that once they are rooted, it is pretty safe to do hard trims, leaving about 4 leaves on each stem, this will train them to stay low, but they will spread laterally to compensate.    As for the spectrum that plants like, look into PAR, or rather, photosyntheticly active region, for plants.  you notice that plants only use yellows to reds, and a spike in blue,  wavelengths.  Now if you compare this to horticulture growing, they use two colors of lights, vegetation, and flowering.  Flowering is warmer and also leads to wider, fuller, and more vibrant leaves.  We are after the latter.  I have found that 6500k is the best region for tanks, not to mention more blues mean more algae, because it is higher in energy.  Give it a try, just unscrew one of the blues and I would raise your lights just a tad so everybody gets an even spectrum from both the fixtures.  But your tanks is looking good!"
PlantedTank,3c09tu,jaquatics,2,Fri Jul 3 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"Really great information, thanks.    trim them more often, stopping the horizontal and vertical growth all together.  train them to stay low, but they will spread laterally to compensate.   So if I were to trim them at say 2-3 inches, and do that maybe weekly, then they'd eventually stop growing vertically? (laterally/horizontally is fine)   Give it a try, just unscrew one of the blues and I would raise your lights just a tad so everybody gets an even spectrum from both the fixtures.   I will definitely do the switch in lights so the warm ones are above the Staurogyne. And yes, I've been wanting to raise the lights for a long time, I'm thinking of making a new bend on the ""metal poles"" on the fixtures to raise them a bit - I will do that this weekend!  And thanks!"
PlantedTank,3c09tu,jaquatics,2,Fri Jul 3 21:05:12 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Now you won't ever get them to stop growing vertically completely, but you can slow it down. And as for the lights, I built a metal conduit ""hanger"" for mine and it works very well.  Just don't hang them too high because then the intensity won't be enough, the goal is just to utilize the spread on those t5's."
PlantedTank,3c09tu,jaquatics,2,Fri Jul 3 21:09:20 2015 UTC,"Noted!   Can't build a ""hanger"" though, due to the way the tank is placed, so I'll try bending the metal things and see what happens."
PlantedTank,3c09tu,steamboatpilot,2,Fri Jul 3 21:20:37 2015 UTC,"Oh I see what you mean, instead you could try getting something to prop up one side of each light so they point back some.  That way they will spread and you won't have to risk breaking those rods."
PlantedTank,3c09tu,cashleyborin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:31:35 2015 UTC,"Could work as well. I'll look into it tomorrow, might make a post when I'm done with it + trimming :D"

PlantedTank,3c1cbh,IllusionOfHatred,2,Sat Jul 4 14:06:12 2015 UTC,Val's love water flow so be sure to have some kind of flow. I'm having the same problem and I'm starting to get some growth. I started cutting the runners off of the mother plant so it promotes upward growth and it has been helping. Once the plant is large enough you should be able to keep the runners attached and they will be fine. Be sure to put root tabs right by the Val they love them. I put double by mine and it has helped as well.

PlantedTank,3bzyra,skunchers,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:46:51 2015 UTC,It could but you have a better chance of attaching it to wood.  Maybe try string around the rock so it can anchor to the string more easily then eventually the rock when it is large enough.

So, after having tanks for two years, my frogbit hangs out in my sump with their own little light.  I don't dose at all, have a pressurized system and do bi weekly 10% water changes.  I'm confident in saying your light isn't intense enough.  Generally speaking you'd have nice deep green leaves.  When you have too little, bits of the leaves start to die, and stay dead after fixing the problem, so you still have those holes.  When I had frogbit in a 10 gallon I had clip on bulbs with 6500k florescents sitting half an inch from the surface, my frogbit would turn red in the centers and have leaves almost 1/4th an inch thick.  You need a more powerful light."

The light is currently raised almost a foot from the top of the tank, which was done to fight green spot algae prior to adding the frogbit. Now that the frogbit is spreading well, just dying off in small portions, I should be able to drop the light a bit more again. I will give that a shot over the next few weeks!

PlantedTank,3bya8b,adambulb,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:16:39 2015 UTC,"The sword roots will mostly melt or break off, but they'll be replaced by buried roots, nothing to worry about.  I've found that plants with those types of leaves like bacopa and moneywort do fine if you pull the leaves off, but they don't grow back. It'll keep growing and get new leaves, but most of the stem will be naked. You might be better off trimming off the leaf-less part once its a little more established. Also, those root pretty easily, so any trimmings (including a single leaf) can turn into their own plant."
PlantedTank,3bvkx3,1ce9ine,3,Thu Jul 2 14:40:46 2015 UTC,Nice!  Just make sure you unplug your heater during the water changes! Eheims are generally pretty great but I don't trust any heater out of water.
PlantedTank,3bvkx3,lolzycakes,2,Thu Jul 2 19:21:55 2015 UTC,Yup. I have my light on a timer and everything else on a surge protector that I turn off during changes.
PlantedTank,3bvkx3,kevin_in_glass,2,Thu Jul 2 20:19:39 2015 UTC,Why not? Can that be dangerous?
PlantedTank,3bvkx3,lolzycakes,5,Thu Jul 2 23:26:43 2015 UTC,"Dangerous? Not directly.  His/her heater is exposed during the water change, if you were to leave it on and exposed (which he isn't! see his reply!) there's a chance the heater could pick up the air temp as opposed to the waters temp. Presuming you keep the air temp cooler than your water, the heater could switch on erroneously and raise the temperature well above what its set at.  This obviously isn't good for your fish, since it can quickly spike the temp, but it's bad for the life of the heater too since the seals that keep it waterproof could degrade from the excess heat. A lot of the time I've seen heaters with condensation on the inside it's because water changes were performed that left the heater exposed multiple times. This could cause a short and nothing good comes from that. If it doesn't outright break the heater the best case scenario is voltage leaks into the tank and worst case is it causes a fire.  Eheim Jagers (which OP has) supposedly turn off when exposed to air to stop this from happening, and while I've never tested it, I wouldn't risk it. They're kinda pricey."

You could go for something like this with the wood as well... just make it a proper centerpiece by only doing low plants around it. Anything from dwarf hairgrass or cryptocoryne parva for example, or the more fancy carpet plants like HC if you are going to use CO2.  Also... I'd really do something with your back wall. It seems to be very common in the US to leave it just see-through for some reason, in the Netherlands where I'm from everyone has a back wall it seems, either just painted backside, foil/plastic stuck to it or a proper inside-relief wall. It makes everything pop out a lot more and doesn't distract with the wall/cables/tech on the wall behind the tank.  Would love to see updates of this! :D"
PlantedTank,3bxrbi,sutekhxaos,2,Fri Jul 3 00:59:16 2015 UTC,"Look at your feeding, water change routine, and filtration (in that order) first. All of these solve the underlying problem causing algae blooms, while algae eaters and shrimp treat a symptom.  Your tank size is pretty small for any algae eaters to do well in. A lone oto could suffer it, but they're social and really should have several friends to be happy. A 16L couldn't support that.  Shrimp could be a good option, but your Betta will most likely fuck them up pretty quickly. Forget any of the smaller shrimp, and maybe risk going with something like an amano, but kiss your money goodbye and be surprised everytime you see them poking around.."
PlantedTank,3bxrbi,lolzycakes,2,Fri Jul 3 01:24:08 2015 UTC,i feed 5 pellets daily and he eats them all (hes a pig) and fast him on sundays. i water change weekly what do i need to look at for filtration?  i did use ferts for a short time to get the plants going. maybe that had something to do with it?  Im getting a second tank up and running right now so i could put my betta in that and convert my 16L to a shrimp tank for a short while i guess to clean it up.  Thanks for your response btw :)
PlantedTank,3bxrbi,lolzycakes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"I'd switch to every other day feeding. In the wild fish expend tons of energy to get only a little bit of food, in a tank they expend very little energy and get a ton of food. Even if he eats it all, it's still quite a bit more than he needs to do well.  A 10-20% weekly water change should be enough. It's likely that the food and filtration are the issues at hand here if you're following that routine.  Filtration is probably the trickiest part to answer easily. Basically, you want to make sure all of the water goes through your filter media and not around it. HOB filters can be notorious for allowing water to bypass the media. You'll want to pack your media in a way to maximize flow through while minimizing bypass. Without knowing your specific filter, I can't help you much in that regard.  Next up is looking at your actual filter media. Sponges are there and floss are primarily there to collect chunky waste like left over pellets and decayed plant bits. Once those are trapped in the sponge they don't go away. Make it a habit to rinse your sponge in the dirty water from your water change. More on that in a bit.  Next up is biological filtration. Bacteria are what make keeping aquariums possible. They break down the initial waste products from decaying food which are very toxic (ammonia), and break it down into a slightly less toxic nitrite, which are then broken down into significantly less toxic nitrates. Nitrates aren't really broken down any further, and are instead used as building blocks for algae. Bacteria are in all aquariums, and will show up almost no matter what. Beneficial bacteria grow on surfaces as opposed to in the water column, so we want to maximize the surface area in a tank to maximize the amount of bacteria. In smaller filters, the sponge is also the primary media that allows bacteria to grow on. If you were to rinse your sponge in tap water, the chlorine would kill the bacteria colonies that exist, basically starting it off from scratch. Rinsing it in clean, dechlorinated water is a waste of clean water since sponges hold a lot of gunk, so I rinse mine in the dirty water from water changes.  Then, there's chemical filtration. Some people consider this optional, but I strongly advise against this school of logic in freshwater. Bacteria don't really break down nitrates any further, and water changes alone can't eliminate nitrates. Then there's phosphates, which aren't really broken down by bacteria at all. Both of these are the limiting factors for algal growth in an aquarium, so we need to reduce these as much as possible. Chemical filtration does just that! It locks onto organic compounds like nitrates and phosphates and binds them to the media. Eventually they absorb all they can, and aren't capable of absorbing more. Some types will break down over time and actually release nitrates and phosphates back into the water! To do this, you should keep an eye on your water chemistry and change them whenever you begin to notice a rise in NO3 and PO4. Carbon is the standard choice, but I prefer resins like purigen since you can regenerate them and use them multiple times."
PlantedTank,3bxrbi,Expertise90,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:40:45 2015 UTC,"Ill do that. he just always seems to be hungry! :) so one day feed, one day no feed. Ive been doing 50% changes because I have some wood in the tank that's making it tea coloured so im trying to keep that under control, even though its only aesthetic I guess.  This is the filter I have. it came with my tank. it has a sponge and then a media box behind it that all the water is forced to go through. BUT what I have done is jammed some cotton in the dosing chamber as the flow is WAY to high for a betta (to the point where he's constantly swimming against the current it generates) and its non-adjustable. I have to change the cotton with water changes because it gets brown and gunky. In hindsight, this may not be such a crash-hot idea."

I'm most assuredly not an aquarium expert, much less a planted tank expert, but I have a decent background in engineering/chemistry.  For the most part all regulators are the same, it essentially all comes down to build quality. A needle valve is a needle valve, o rings are o rings, and when you're not constantly changing the flow/not moving the setup around the need for absolute precision parts isn't really there. For the most part, unless you go for the basement priced regulators, build quality will be more than sufficient for a single aquarium (If you're planning on using the same co2 source for multiple tanks it might be worth it to splurge on nicer gear).   Personally I bought an Aquatek regulator from amazon for an almost even $100: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TRUI62  Can't recommend it because it hasn't even come in but it seems like a great intersection of reliability and cost. A lot of the more expensive regulators are literally the exact same OEM parts with a different label... also keep in mind the difference between a $70 regulator and a $100 regulator is a lot larger than the difference between a $100 regulator and a $500 regulator. That said, as some other commenters have mentioned, customer service is a big factor since regulator failure can wipe out thousands of dollars worth of fish.   After going through this whole ordeal the past couple weeks I'd suggest you make a budget, stick to it, and find the best parts that fit into that budget. Otherwise you're going to end up going over budget and allocating too much money to the wrong parts (no use buying a $500 pH controller that if you don't have a high precision regulator, etc. etc.)."

Par is is a measurement of the light that can be used for photosynthesis. I'm not sure on the measurements of the fluval chi light but it's pretty damn weak.

You have to plant very heavily -- it grows slowly -- so be prepared to spend more money up front buying a lot of pots of it if you want to cover the bottom. It's hard to have that fast growing ""lawn"" with low tech, but mine is spreading slowly. You may be able to succeed with the hairgrass or other carpet plants like marsilea minuta (which I've not personally tried) but they will propagate slowly.  Crypts are root feeders so you'd want a good nutrient-rich substrate (i.e. flourite or eco-complete with root tabs under it or osmocote sprinked under it OR dirted tank OR ADA aquasoil). Same probably goes for any foreground plant, really, except for a moss.

PlantedTank,3brnob,StoicSalamander,5,Wed Jul 1 16:26:52 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I wouldn't put a pleco in a 10g. He will probably need a lot more space.   That being said. Yes you can totally do low maintenance! Look into getting ""low light plants,"" things like anubias or java fern. These don't even need to be planted, merely attached to rocks or driftwood. People will try to convince you that a ""real substrate"" is a must, but it's not. If your fish are making sufficient waste, you may not even need to fertilize (just make sure to cycle the tank). I also suggest reading up on the relation between lighting, oxygen, CO2, etc, if it's not something you're versed in yet.   I run a 5g kit that has just three little LEDs as its light source and my three anubias do fine with 4 hours per day (plus minimal ambient room light). I do fertilize because while the plants were doing fine, I wanted them to do a bit better. I dose Seachem Nitrogen, Potassium, and Flourish twice per week. No CO2. Super easy to dose, just use an eye dropper and done. My substrate is large pebbles and flat marbles, with the anubias plants merely held down with rocks to keep them from floating. They've grown a bunch of new leaves and seem very happy."
PlantedTank,3brnob,sexytimespanda,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:53:40 2015 UTC,"Really? Even a little one? the one I am thinking of - I don't know what species it is, but came from my boyfriend's parents plecos (they spawned like 50 babies) and they're only about 2 inches long. They haven't grown any bigger in the several years they've had them, and they're in a huge tank. I figured they were a species that just stayed little.  And that sounds awesome! I have some driftwood I want to attach moss to so I'm glad that that's a thing. Is there an all in one type of fertilizer that exists that I could add one a week or so? (Or maybe a better question - is the Seachem, Nitrogen, Potassium, and Fluorish all separate things you add?)  Is it safe to assume the plants sold at Petco and the LFS will be pretty foolproof? the LFS has plants in a lot of its tanks of fish, and it has hundreds and hundreds of tanks, so I can't see them doing that much complicated maintenence on that many tanks, no?"
PlantedTank,3brnob,nahfoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"Petco somtimes sells none aquatic plants as aquatics.  They do sell packages of random bulbs which are fun and not too expensive, but they usually only have like a 50% or so success rate. If you're looking for low maintenence I would suggest just getting root tabs and sticking em in your sand. BTW mixing small gravel into the sand usually looks nice and natural. For plants I would check out the weekly random acts of kindness thread, you can usually get people's trimmings and only pay shipping"
PlantedTank,3brnob,jlk952306,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:45:10 2015 UTC,Do you need to do anything special with cuttings to get them to grow roots?
PlantedTank,3brnob,sexytimespanda,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"There are some smaller species of pleco, such as the bristlenose (my favorite), but they still can get to a decent size. More than an inch or two."
PlantedTank,3brnob,nahfoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:06:36 2015 UTC,"I just googled - neither of them is a bristlenose. They're white, about 2 inches long, don't seem to have grown since they were purchased, and one has whiskers while the other doesn't. One actually used to be in the 10 gallon (the BF's parents watched my tank while I was in college) for a couple years, and the other was in the parent's 40 gallon (or maybe 50?) for about 3 years. When I took the tank back and they moved the fish in together they had babies. They're both of similar size, despite the major difference in tank housing. I don't know if that rings any species bells. I bet I could call up and ask his parents but I don't think they know either!"
PlantedTank,3brnob,Bearhat54,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Seachem products are all separate. I have the small bottles and I see me having to throw them out due to expiration before I manage to use them all! Very potent, very good products. Can be pricey but for me, worth it. Someone else mentioned root tabs below - you could use those if you pick rooting plants. But for things like moss or Java fern, a root tab buried in the sand probably won't do much (unless I'm way off base). I like liquid ferts because they go right into the water, no waiting to dissolve, no tedious measuring like with dry ferts (my opinion). I don't really think there is an ""all in one"" out there - nitrogen and potassium are macro nutrients, while Flourish is more micro nutrients. Plants need a mixture of these to grow.   I've had success with my anubias from petco. They sell plants out of the tanks as well as in plastic tubes on the shelves. Just research plants beforehand and see what you think you'd be able to take care of. If you choose to buy out of the tank, my advice is to quarantine the plant for at least a week, just to make sure it's not carrying cooties from petco. A diluted bleach dip or rinse in H2O2 wouldn't go amiss either."
PlantedTank,3brnob,nahfoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:56:53 2015 UTC,"I'll second the advice to not have a pleco but if you really want a low maintainer tank I suggest going with shrimp. Red cherry shrimp are super hardy and breed like rabbits. They have a very low bioload and can mostly survive off biofilm and algae in the tank. If you keep a lid on it evaporation will be minimal and you can use a simple air powered sponge filter. There are a few plants that you can easily grow without any fertilizers and very low light.  Mainly mosses which can look really nice even as the only plant. I've made a couple nice scapes using only moss and other low light plants, anubias is a good one although  it grows very slowly. Also try some different stem plants and maybe jungle val or some kinds of crypts."
PlantedTank,3brnob,Bearhat54,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"What is the deal with that filter you were talking about? I have heard about it before, but have no idea what it is. I want every piece of info you have about them. You're on the spot now."
PlantedTank,3brnob,nahfoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:16:33 2015 UTC,Ok I'll try my best to explain but if you Google images/videos you'll see how it works. basically it's a cylindrical sponge and you attach an airline tube to the middle of it. Bubbles flow out of the top and pull water with them which gently pulls the water thru the sponge. It's mostly for biological filtering as it doesn't really suck things out but you can rinse them out every once in a while. It's reccomented for shrimp for 3 reasons. 1) it's cheap and shrimp don't need much filtration 2) they won't get sucked into it which can happen with cannister and hob filters 3) il the shrimp like to hangout and early shit off of them. Also the fact that they don't have much flow might be good for a betta

PlantedTank,3brnob,Abbro,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"In my experience yes they will eat the shrimp but if you give them plenty of hiding spots and start out with a few females and at least one male, he won't be able to completely wipe them out. They do breed easily but it won't be like snails where they completely cover your tank, not in my experience anyway. I also think they're more fun to watch than fish are. And to grow trimmings from stem plants you just tear off the bottom couple leaves and bury the stem, it'll grow roots on its own"

PlantedTank,3bmmim,lablizard,2,Tue Jun 30 23:37:29 2015 UTC,I want to know if you could explain or take a picture that shows how you placed the lava rock.   Did you use any substrate supports(plastic square shoved into substrate) to hold the soil in trouble spots?  How is that log so well placed?   You have your light hanging from the ceiling at an angle to prevent a shadow area in your tank?
PlantedTank,3bmmim,Limosa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"Sure, well I went to an aquarium and found the lava rocks I wanted. I played in their sand pit for about an hour messing around with their placement, swapping out rocks.   I bought them home and experimented more with their placement with the log. I had to adjust a few things but my original vision of the scape stayed the same.  I didn't use any plastic substrate supports in this tank. The lava rocks are wedged lightly against the glass, with some foam in between so not to scratch the glass. I put smaller rocks that I had left over from my old scape behind them to take up space, so I didn't have to fill it in all with the soil I had. I also shoved sticks and small rocks in the gaps I saw so that the soil behind wouldn't leak through. Before I added the sand I kept the bottom clear, this allowed be to spot the soil leaks and plug them up. It also made cleaning up the soil leaks very easy.  The log was completely hollow, this allowed me to place heavy rocks down inside it at the bottom, giving it enough weight so that was able to stick up the way it does. When I bought the log it was just over 3 foot long, the tank I had was 3 foot long, so the log had to go at an angle. I didn't want to cut it because it was just so interesting.   Yes, the one thing I didn't realise/foresee was how my 4 foot light, from my previous set-up was going to sit on the new tank. I originally had the light just straight, but because the log was placed the way it was it blocked most of the light. I had to make the light go the opposite way to the log so more light got to the plants."
PlantedTank,3bmmim,Piromania666,2,Thu Jul 2 09:03:54 2015 UTC,Great job and beautiful tank! The scale makes the tank look like a 10 gallon!

(I personally think dry is not any harder though, and it is way cheaper. But I guess for just a 6.6 it's not going to break you to go the other way.

PlantedTank,3bpjj6,TonightsWhiteKnight,5,Wed Jul 1 02:59:02 2015 UTC,"It can be done 1000 different ways and still be considered ""right"". It's one of those things where you can't get a definitive answer, you have to just do and experience for yourself. I started adding random pet store plants to my tanks about 6 years ago and through trial and error learned which ones live and die in a typical no-tech home aquarium.   Depending on how serious you want to get, you will have to consider everything from:   What substrate to use (normal gravel isn't going to let you grow much). There is constant debate over which is best. Just do your research and you will find something that works for you.  What light to use (Tube vs LED) I prefer LED as it looks nicer to me and doesn't need replacing as often as a fluorescent tube does. Types of fish you want, if any, and if they are compatible with the plants you want Types of plants you want, and what they require in terms of light/pH/etc Do you want high-tech or low-tech? (CO2 or no CO2) High tech offers faster plant growth but more effort and cost (hundreds of dollars). Low tech is ""cheap"" but doesn't always look as nice as a good CO2 injected tank. Fertilizers. Lots of methods to fertilize your plants. PPS Pro, Estimative Index, liquid ferts like SeaChem, etc.. What you use depends on what works for you. I use PPS Pro since it's easy and cheap. About a million other things that I forgot to mention.   Planted tanks are very rewarding. I think part of the reward comes from doing your own research and learning for yourself how to make everything grow well and look pretty. It can be very confusing at first, but you will start to pick up on the terms and methods that people use. Good luck with your tank! I can promise you it will be both very fun and very expensive."

PlantedTank,3bmsyk,woody678,4,Tue Jun 30 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"You can think of a planted tank as a garden. You need a good substrate for them to grow, You need the correct type of lighting for the plants, and co2. You don't really have to dose liquid fertilizers, but is does have a difference. Do some research on the plants you want before getting them to make sure you can grow."
PlantedTank,3bmsyk,CalvinFromVietnam,3,Tue Jun 30 15:43:35 2015 UTC,"More thoughts:  I'd start simple. Search for ""low light aquatic plants"" and ""low tech planted tank"". At the top of this page go to ""Helpful Guides"" and ""Low tech planted Aquarium Guide"".   Make sure you understand the relationship between plants, co2, light, and nutrient uptake. For example, more light means more nutrients are required for the plants to stay healthy. Less lights, less nutrients needed (and less co2 needed).  Learn where to place your plants (foreground, midground, background). For example don't plant an amazon sword in the front of your tank, it will become huge :)  If you are able to strike the right balance between lighting, plant mass, and the bioload in your tank created by the fish, you in theory should not really need additional fertilizers, perhaps with the exception of when you have very heavy root-feeding plants.  But no matter how well you plan, once it is set up it really is a game of observing and adapting. You often need to solve problems as you go. For example, you may notice a certain type of algae popping up in your tank. Maybe this indicates you are low on a certain nutrient, or your lights are on too long causing the plants to suck up all available nutrients, etc. You notice a plant is yellowing or getting holes in it, so you have a look at the ""Plant Deficiency/Nutrient Guide"" in ""Helpful Guides"" above and figure out what might cause that. Expect to tweak things.  Look at the ""algae guide"" and make sure you educate yourself on what causes algae. People often think it is due to excess nutrients but in reality, it is often because a certain nutrient is lacking in the tank, limiting healthy growth of the plants. If plants are growing healthy, algae usually can't compete. When plants start doing poorly, this is when algae steps in."
PlantedTank,3bmsyk,bjfsonreddit,3,Tue Jun 30 16:09:26 2015 UTC,"Welcome, the first thing you should think about is what size tank you want. The proper equipment such as filter, lighting, heater. Then you should think whay kind of fish, and plants do you want. If you want a high tech planted tank or low tech? Difference in the two is type of lighting (for some people), and 100% injected c02 system.  I consider myself as a high tech because I have c02 and high LED lights.   Consider a 20 gallon + tank as larger tanks generally need less maintenance. The right research is important too. I would recommend you look into the nitrogen cycle to avoid harming fishy friends."
PlantedTank,3bmsyk,BloodyExorcist,2,Tue Jun 30 15:56:23 2015 UTC,"oh boy, lots of research should be done before you buy a single thing. also know, that once you start this hobby, theres no going back! haha! i'd say first decide what life you want in the aquarium. different fish require different things (lots of swimming space vs none, strong vs weak current, plants vs no plants, sand vs gravel, are they solitary or do they need schooling buddies). also, different plants need different things like lighting and fertilizer. the bigger the tank, the more stable it will be. also, be careful to avoid hitch hiker snails on plants you buy."
PlantedTank,3bmsyk,dinaaa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:27:06 2015 UTC,Well first things first. What do you know about aquarium and fish in general ? Are you aware of the nitrate cycle ? Are you aware of NO3 ? Are you aware of what is ph and its effect in water?

There is lots of advice on here, but try not to overthink it.   1 - learn what a cycle is. This step will help you avoid frustration.  2 - learn the right fish for your tank size (adult size).  3 - don't try to bend your water chemistry too much. It's a never ending battle.  4 - just have fun with it. Experiment. Try different plants. Do some research on filters/lights. Try to keep it low tech.  5 - Don't get yourself overwhelmed with too much at first. Baby steps.  Hope to see some pics of yours in the future!"

PlantedTank,3bm0j4,ScoobySnacks801,2,Tue Jun 30 08:34:27 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how you arrived at your dosing amounts for those Seachem ferts. Are you just using the beginner dose on the bottle? If it is working for you don't change it! I'm sure your fish bio-load is producing enough nitrogen for the plants if everything seems to be in balance.   But .5mL per 10 gal dosing on the Nitrogen would, I think, only be the equivalent of 1ppm nitrate. Unless I am misunderstanding how the dosing calculator works here: http://www.seachem.com/Library/Calculators.html. Adding 1ppm Nitrate is pretty insignificant. As in, I question how much of a difference it would make if you just stopped.  I am dosing 4mL Seachem Nitrogen into ~8gal which is supposed to achieve 10ppm ""Nitrate equivalent"" 3x a week... but every time I test Nitrate in my tank its 0 so this is why I keep dosing so much.  Also, just curious, 2-3ml excel daily seems like a lot ... since the recommended dose on the bottle is 1ml per 10 gal. Did you ramp up to this amount over time or something?"
PlantedTank,3bm0j4,bjfsonreddit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:00:56 2015 UTC,"hi, yes i based all of my dosing calculations off of the beginner recommendation on the labels. i'm new at plant care so i still dont really know what all the ferts do or how to adjust based on the tank needs. i'm still just going as i learn. all i know is that my research brought me to the conclusion that a planted tank needs all those fertilizers, so here i am. but then i go and read posts like this guy's here, and i resign myself to that fact that i still have no idea what i'm doing.   when i test my water i'm usually getting 0ppm Ammonia, 0ppm Nitrite, and 5-10ppm Nitrate. so i guess i'm doing alright.  as far as the Excel dosing goes, the label said 1ml/10gal every day or every other day. i was doing every other day, but then i got a case of blackbeard and some green spot algae, and the tank glass was getting hazy. after some reading up, i found that some people spot treat bba with up to 5x the recommended dosage so i started cut the lights and squirting 3ml dailiy onto the bba until it all died off. then i noticed green spot and the dirty tank glass was going away on its own, so i put 2 and 2 together and chalked it up to the Excel increase and cut my lights from 8hrs to 5hrs.  also, i recently i was traveling and stopped in at a highly rated LFS and got to talking to the shop owner. the guy was like a walking encyclopedia of fish knowledge. he showed me a 6gal planted tank that they were dosing 4ml Excel daily and it looked super clean. no invertebrates in that tank though. he said that the beginner recommendations on the Seachem labels are very conservative and i was already underdosing since my tank is 12gal and i was using 10gal amounts. he said with the Excel i should go for 2x to 2.5x the daily suggestion, but not much more since it could could be bad for the shrimp."
PlantedTank,3bm0j4,bjfsonreddit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I'm trying to be more careful with Excel these days as I think it may have caused my dwarf sagittaria to melt. All I know is I dosed 4ml into my 8-9 gal tank and later in the week dwarf sag started melting.  Apparently green spot algae, and green dust algae (which may explain the ""hazy glass"" look but maybe not) can be caused by low phosphate. Obviously you have nitrate present in the water... perhaps you should try to dose the phosphate to ~1ppm 3x a week, and that may allow you to turn the lights on longer without algae developing. With the potassium, many people target ~10ppm of this 3x a week. But it could also depend on how much potassium already exists in your tap water. Apparently high potassium is not a risk to the fish though. As you increase the P and K you would want to check and see if your N starts to go down though. Your plants may start taking in more N if they were being limited by lack of P. But like I said... don't change stuff if it's all working out for you and you're happy with it the way it is ;)"

PlantedTank,3bjtw3,iEvoh,6,Mon Jun 29 20:24:34 2015 UTC,"I live near Cleveland, OH. We have a river that runs through the city called the Cuyahoga River, famous for catching on fire (yes the river caught on fire) not once, not twice, but 13 times. Needless to say, it's a dirty river. When I first set up my 29 gallon tank I went to a tributary of the Cuyahoga close to my home called the Rocky River. I picked out about ten pieces of driftwood. Some dry driftwood, other wood I picked straight out of the river.  First I let the wood sit in a bleach/water combination for a week. Then I boiled the shiiiiiiit out of the wood. Like 30-45 minutes in boiling water per piece of wood. I then let the wood sit out of water in a cardboard box for  ~6 months. Then I boiled it again and added to my tank. Haven't had any problems yet.   There were some pieces I put straight in after boiling. So they've been in my tank for over a year. I've never had a problem. Honestly, as long as you soak in bleach and boil them you should be able to kill any harmful things in the wood. Do frequent, large water changes after adding and check for any weird critters or strange fish behavior. If you do all this you should be fine.   If the water by your house is as clean as you say it is it should be doubly fine."

PlantedTank,3bjtw3,ElongatedCow,2,Mon Jun 29 20:31:50 2015 UTC,"Often times it depends on the type of wood, and the ecosystem of the river. Factors go from does the wood float, decompose, contain harmful or foreign bacteria? Is the wood dense, ie, could it still hold river water and contagious after being washed? Generally try to avoid driftwood that is from your local river. Dry driftwood is albeit safer but still take the time to decontamination the wood of foreign bodies.   As indefinitive as that is, generally the risk isn't worth the reward. We seems of people on the subreddit having driftwood finds, but rest assured they are assessing the risks."

PlantedTank,3bjdms,PriceZombie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"Is your 55 gallon 4 ft long? The light listed is 3 ft (although it says it covers up to 48"") so not sure if it fits the entirety of the tank length. I find that if the light is short by 6 inches+ on either side you will get significant shadowing on the edges, especially with LEDs.  Emperor 400 is perfect, it's better to over-filtrate here spec wise since once you add in all the media + detritus over time will slow down the overall flow rate.   Excel is fine, but expect slow but decent growth while using it. You may also run into issues with certain plants, such as anacharis, possibly crypts, and others that may be irritated by it and melt. Ramping it up slowly dose wise seems to improve its reception to plants.  You may need plant fertilizers with excel, especially when you just start where the water will be nutrient poor until the livestock have a chance to increase nitrate and phosphates. Your source water may help with this sometimes (I find that most tap/well water contains phosphates).   You can buy seachem N,K,P liquid ferts, but you will save the most money buying dry ferts (potassium nitrate, monopotassium phosphate). You can buy these online via green leaf aquariums, aquarium fertilizer.com, as well as others."
PlantedTank,3bjdms,Ka0tiK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:45:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah so the tank is 48"" long and when extended the light fits, that was one of my concerns regarding the light.  I actually may return it and pick up something that fits better because the crossbar across the middle of my tank blocks this thing too."
PlantedTank,3bjdms,rustyisme123,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"Cool features for the light. I could not find the intensity or spectrum though. Not sure if LEDs are in watts or what. I'm by no means an expert here. (Read amateur). I think you want 2watts/gal, but deeper tanks are harder to get light down to the bottom of the tank. Do you want to have carpet? We're you planning on co2 injection, or just excel? There's diy co2 too."
PlantedTank,3bjdms,xxoczukxx,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"I believe the wattage is pretty low on the light itself, something like 15w, but I thought LED's were designed to be low wattage, high intensity for a reason.  I'll see what I can find when I get home tongiht.  In terms of CO2 I figured I'd start with excel then introduce enough fish to handle it after that.  I don't really see a reason to add an entire CO2 injection system if the fish are creating the CO2 for me.  I also believe that I can add different mediums to the Emperor 400 filters that would allow for increased CO2 levels.  What the hell is carpet?  Are you talking algae?  If algae is your concern then I think it'll be handled by a delicate balance of plant/animal life to not only starve the algae (plants), but to consume it if it appears (animal)."
PlantedTank,3bjdms,xxoczukxx,2,Mon Jun 29 18:58:06 2015 UTC,LEDs are measured in terms of micromols of PAR. even conventional bulbs the watts per gallon isnt really used much in the community unless as more of a guideline as par is really what matters. Its basically how far and how much light penetrates into the water i think  If you google the light you can usually find some form of par ratings

Any thoughts on the Finnex Stingray for my size tank (48x13x21)?

Two of my bleeding heart tetras got fungus on them after the ich passed I'm assuming from their lowered immune system that left them vulnerable. Unfortunately to my knowledge fungal medication will hurt invertebrates. I have flower shrimp so I couldn't use the meds either. What I've been doing is keeping the temperature up and doing water changes every day and it's been getting better I hardly see any now.

You can just run it with a timer and use it like a standard planted+ as well. So the only downside is that you can't ramp it in manual mode. They are working on a light that will have this functionality along with a mobile app.   Eheim 2213 would be the smallest canister I would recommend for a 40b. 2217 is what you should get if it's the only filter."

PlantedTank,3bdreu,lady_cardamom,8,Sun Jun 28 06:51:44 2015 UTC,"Two weeks ago my sister came to visit. She likes fish so we stopped at an aquarium store one day to look around, where she convinced me to buy a betta fish.   I put him in a little goldfish bowl and set him on my desk and we were happy together for a minute until The Internet yelled at me. So I upgraded him to a 5.5g tank with silk plants and multicoloured glass rock on the bottom.   Then I went to buy betta pellets one day and walked out with three little julii (edit: I don't actually remember what kind they are, the fish dude suggested them) cories, because I Have A Problem Now (and omg they are SO CUTE, they're like little snuffly fish puppies!). I added them to the tank and we were happy together for a minute until The Internet yelled at me. So I upgraded them to the fancy soft gravel the dude at the most awesome of all aquarium stores told me to get (it's a planted aquarium store! it's aquarium plant heaven here in Seattle!)  And while I was there to buy gravel I walked out with a bunch of plants because I Have A Problem Now. And my fish love the plants! There's a banana plant (???) that is super awesome and that spiky stuff is my betta Mushu's new favourite land of wonderment and the other ones back there are making me die from green zen. I love growing plants and I just dont' have enough light or room in my studio apartment to make it work, so landing on aquascaping is kinda rocking my world right now.  I don't claim that this is the most ideal setup ... and I've totally misplaced my moss ball somehow ... so open to any and all suggestions for sure. I just wanted to show off my big tank renovation.  tl;dr: I have plants now, and plants are awesome."
PlantedTank,3bdreu,popcornicus,7,Sun Jun 28 07:45:27 2015 UTC,"Don't want to be a bummer, but you're better off rehoming the Julii cories. They need to be in groups of 5 or more at the very least and they are too active for your tank. If you're set on having a species of corydoras, then get pygmy cories. They are much smaller and more suitable to your tank.  Good luck, your tank looks great."
PlantedTank,3bdreu,mistersabs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:39:21 2015 UTC,Corydoris Habrosus are awesome dwarf corys!
PlantedTank,3bdreu,Superschaap5,0,Sun Jun 28 09:26:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe they're not juliis actually. They're itty bitty and I legit don't remember what they were called when I got them -- I was led to them by the fish dude when I told him the size of my tank. And opinions are mixed on exactly how many cories one MUST have -- more is better, but three is fine according to some. They seem happy enough and I like them so I'm not gonna worry too hard about it.. crosses fingers she's not engaged in full on fish abuse"
PlantedTank,3bdreu,pinkmagedon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:30:50 2015 UTC,"The fish in the pic is a Corydoras Paleatus, which is too large for your tank, get pygmys or habrosus if you really want corys.  Edit: Habrosus is a tad larger though, so pygmys are your best bet"

PlantedTank,3bezsg,HumbleAirsofter,7,Sun Jun 28 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"You don't want natural sun light. You can't control it to limit algae or heat.

You have a couple gallons that will likely be assaulted by the sun."

PlantedTank,3bezsg,throwawayCG48,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:58:25 2015 UTC,"You'll find most aquarist will tell you the same. Experiment all you want but this hobby has been around a long time. It's well documented how problematic natural sunlight is for artificial systems like aquariums. It may take months for the algae cultures to find a food hold or the sun's toll to show itself so be warned.  Also, no one wants to think about any animals getting potentially slow cooked or repeatedly heat stressed. Most will look at it as an unnecessary risk."
PlantedTank,3bezsg,throwawayCG48,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:27:34 2015 UTC,Even if the tank is further away would it really still get heat swings?
PlantedTank,3bezsg,Spikerz28,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:29:29 2015 UTC,"If the tank isn't ever in direct sunlight, the temp swings should probably be minimal. Water has the peculiar property of being fairly temperature stable. If you're confident your temps aren't going to be issue, have at it. After looking at your pic again, if you center that tank you are probably fine regarding temp swings. (I don't know where you live/angle of sun exposure).  However, algae is going to LOVE that left glass panel. Regardless if you were to wall that side with plants. The algae will colonize the glass and then move on to your plants. You'll need to be diligent about scraping that glass! Probably need additives to help keep it in check.  The other issue is I don't see much plant growth occurring. At least not evenly. I think you're going to have a nice end and a pretty shitty end if you want to rely on that sunlight.  Again, sunlight is just really fucking problematic. Which is why almost every tank you ever see will not be direct sunlight and just use lights."

I have seen this stuff in every one of my planted/dirted tanks early on, but after the plant mass got large enough it pretty much went poof (disappeared) overnight.  I think it is caused by an excess of some nutrient in the water column.  Adding floaters (Salvinia or some such) is a possible quick fix."

PlantedTank,3bcytv,3rdworldMoN,2,Sun Jun 28 01:17:42 2015 UTC,"Excel can melt some plants, but it may also be due to the plants readjusting to a new environment. Plants tend to die off then grow back when placed in a new tank. Pay attention to any new growth to know for sure if it is dead or not.  Substrate is sort of a heated topic at times. Most will say ADA Aqua Soil would be the best, but there is a lot of factors on whether or not it is best for you. Main factor would be price. I use Eco Complete and am able to grow things like HC just fine.  Personally I would not advise going straight into CO2 if this is the first time you are trying plants in an aquarium. It's tempting to just go and try harder to grow plants as quick as possible, but without knowing how to identify various growth problems you might just end up wasting a lot of money.  For ferts I recommend getting dry ferts from GLA. Estimative Index dosing would be the easiest way of dosing as its basically just putting a bunch into your tank then doing a water change to reset it every week. There are guides online that will further explain that.  For filter, a canister can work but you'll need to find one that has an adjustable flow rate or one rated for a 20 gal.  If you do decide just to make the jump straight into CO2 please get a drop checker. Every time I hear problems related to CO2 people will state their bubbles per second. Every tank is different so 2BPS means absolutely nothing."
PlantedTank,3bcytv,MoonCryi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:45:45 2015 UTC,"thank you for responding. I was definitely considering the ADA soils as I see it alot on here. The co2 system wont be for antoher month or two at the very minimum so prob more like ~3months. The dry ferts and EI dosing is exactly what I needed to hear and I will go on either GLA site or google to do extensive reading on that. I just hate how my eco complete isn't holding some of my plants that well since I only used 20lbs for 20 gallons it seems like the plants tend to float away after I plant them. It is kinda difficult to get them to set in place. I'll probably just stick to the HoB filter unless I can find a canister for cheap somehow. Also do you think I could use a single co2 system and split it somehow between multiple tanks? I am thinking about getting some small shrimp tank to experiment with as well not sure yet, I might just redo the 20 gallon. How would I be able to identify growth problems? I have seen basic diagrams of what old growth/new growth is supposed to look like with certain nutrient deficiencies."
PlantedTank,3bcytv,MoonCryi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"With a HoB filter make sure you fill the tank up to the output. Surface movement aids in gas exchange so you'll end up dissipating CO2.  I wouldn't recommend splitting the CO2 to multiple tanks due to dosing requirements being different. That being said there may be a way to do it I just don't know of any.  For a small shrimp tank might I recommend a cheaper small regulator like the Aquatek Mini? I use one on a 10gal and besides some adjustment issues it works perfectly for its price point.  For deficiencies for the most part EI dosing should have you covered, but depending on plant load and what types of plants you may have to dose more of something. Not sure how ADA aquasoil works out with EI dosing as Aquasoil would provide nutrients so look into that. You may find you have to dose something extra. In my case I have a lot of red plants so I need extra iron in the form of Seachem Flourish Iron.  Don't be disapointed if your first tank crashes and burns. My first tank went from this to this in a little over a year. Biggest lesson I learned is if you make the jump to CO2 do not neglect your tank. Been doing two water changes a week for the past month just to fix some algae issues."
PlantedTank,3bcytv,IllusionOfHatred,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say if you want to go pressurized Co2, you'll at least need to go medium tech from low: The plants will need more of everything to make use of the extra Co2, or your tank will get out of balance.   I use a 20lbs Co2 tank, GLA SS Pro-1 series, and a DIY Co2 reactor that I built from watching YouTube videos. All on my 125 gallon aquarium with four light clamps of 2x150w equivalent CFLs, and 2x100w equivalent leds, also one 30w led flood light in the middle. I use miracle gro organic potting soil, and red clay as nutrients for my plants.. works well.  For the one canister filter for two tanks... You will need a water bridge,  which I would suggest for you to just fork out some money to get a second canister filter.   You may have noticed that I don't have a drop checker, pH controller, etc: Because I felt it wasn't needed.. and my tank has been going strong for nearly seven months like this. Best way to see if you have too much is to look at your fish: Gasping? Turn it down. Regular 35psi is what I run it at: Also with a reactor, I get 99.99% diffuse rate in my tank.. with little to no aeration in my tank, leading to Co2 losing."
PlantedTank,3bcytv,MoonCryi,3,Sun Jun 28 06:33:00 2015 UTC,If OP plans on a tank with fish in it I agree a drop checker isn't as important as just watching the fish would tell you if you need to turn it back. With shrimp only that doesn't work out as well. The low pH from to much CO2 can can cause problems.  I feel its better to err on the side of caution and just get a drop checker. Shrimp can end up being quite expensive and it would suck even more to kill some CRS than to have just spent a bit more on equipment.
PlantedTank,3bcytv,IllusionOfHatred,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:56:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.. it would cost me a bit of money if I lose all my angelfish: Guess I was cautious enough to turn it up slowly over time.. only a specific amount gets dissolved into the water column at a time with the reactor I find.. so anymore is either going to build up, and or cause issues for me."

PlantedTank,3ban70,The_keg__man,3,Sat Jun 27 11:18:23 2015 UTC,One thing I'll say about the rocks is that they look like they have quartz in them and that can mess with the water chemistry. Otherwise good luck!

PlantedTank,3ban70,IllusionOfHatred,3,Sat Jun 27 12:49:28 2015 UTC,I can't remember the full details behind it but it can leach minerals into the water faster than some rocks IIRC. Basically the hardness and acidity of the water could change dramatically (if you're going for a community tank it may not be an issue but if shrimps are to go in it may cause a problem).  Genuinely can't remember the full reason. I remember being told a long time ago by a wizened old man called 'grandad' who's been keeping fish for god knows how long.

PlantedTank,3bayxi,floopdawoop1,6,Sat Jun 27 14:06:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, take it out.  You seem to know it better than that shop worker! :)  It works best if you lay the plant on a flat surface  (dinner plate will do) and carefully pluck out the sponge stuff from between the roots. You can use a tooth pick or tweezers for the little stuff. Rinse it under some water (not ice cold, not hot) once in a while if the spinge stuff keeps sticking.  Ideally you end up wuth completely bare roots but it's okay to have some stuff still clinging on to it, especially if the alternative is damaging roots.  Do keep in mind that a lotvof plants are grown above water (emers) and it takes a while for them to get used to underwater  (submers) life... so some leaves may wither away.  Oh and yeah you can buy tablets to stick near the roots as a local fertiliser if you want.  Good luck!"
PlantedTank,3bayxi,Astilaroth,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:15:18 2015 UTC,"It's called rock wool that the roots and bulb are surrounded in.. annoying stuff to remove above water. I would suggest to remove the pot carefully, just don't damage the roots too much. Then take the bulb and roots to a container of the water of the tank, and gently rub off the rock wool.. it will come off s lot easier underwater, than above water.  Hopefully that helps. I would say to have some tabs on hand, since swords are heavy root feeders."
PlantedTank,3bayxi,IllusionOfHatred,0,Sat Jun 27 23:33:35 2015 UTC,Take it out of the water.  Remove the pot slowly so you dont cut the roots completely.  Then take your time to remove the spongy thing and again be careful not to cut the roots too much. if you see any roots which started to decompose cut them off. Just so you know even if you cut all the roots they will grow again. but it is always better if there are some to begin with.  Take that plant and tight it on a rock using a string and put it in yoru tank. I am not sure what plant that is but it looks tough like anubia.

Maybe add some plants in shallow wide pots?  I would say to go with a sand substrate, with potting soil, and clay beneath: walstad method?  Going with a different coloured substrate would give the tank an entirely different look.. also the dirt would give nutrients for the plants to flourish in a low to medium maintenance tank. Varies to what you're going for in a tank.. I would suggest a jungle like aquarium, that would give it a unique look.. not too messy though."
PlantedTank,3bbjg9,IllusionOfHatred,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:29:25 2015 UTC,So use the pots as a divider or are there actual dividers I can buy or make? And would the potting soil give off to much ammonia for my bacteria to handle or would the plants help absorb and convert it?

I'm not too sure of regular dividers, but it would need to be solid, so the runner stem doesn't  squeeze through any space, and or hole.  Not to my knowledge of the dirt.. some may, or more related to over dosing of nutrients, which can lead to the death of fish. I use miracle gro organic potting soil for my tanks, and I can add my fish when I'm done planting.. like a few days. Pretty sure you can do it fairly soon, but I would let the tank sit for 24 hours, but to let debris get taken out, water to warm up, etc.."

(Turned out to be a bit of an expensive small square tank, in the end...) I use an Amazon LED, with a small bell diffuser and aerosol CO2 unit, with an ADA aquasoil base with powersand underneath, and my glosso multiplies like rabbits. Seriously, that stuff grows so damn fast... Sometimes I can't even see where my shrimps are, then I find them nestled down under the glosso leaves, picking at substrate. It is an amazing carpet plant for a shrimp tank - It looks great to the human eye, and it allows the shrimp to graze and hide. Everyone wins. Give it a couple of weeks with even just a cheap CO2 rig, and you'll be laughing.   I'm currently cutting my fluval glosso and starting a gradual transition in my 60g, changing the current blixa japonica to glosso. One thing to keep in mind may be that the plant fares better with a good water flow. I made the mistake of trying to grow it in my far right forecorner, when my filter output is far left. Yesterday, I realized my mistake, and replanted my blixa further back, and replaced it with glosso, directly under the output. As that sends out runners and thickens up, I will continue to take another, and another, and another blixa out to make room for the glosso, but slowly, so I don't upset the nitrate reduction too suddenly."

When I do the build later this week, I'll stack a layer or two of the slate in the areas I want raised, under the soil layer, so that the substrate isn't actually deeper there. To prevent gradual leveling, I plan to place my driftwood and a few rocks strategically, as rough ""berms"" at the terrace boundaries.

Also, cut it along a node, will help promote roots to grow.

PlantedTank,3b4ixj,CaptainTurdfinger,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:30:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed, once it's producing some healthy new growth (two weeks maybe), then cut it an inch or two below the lowest leaves and replant the stem.

Your finnex ray II is their strongest light model (and will give you high light) but you will need to counter this with non-limiting ferts and strong co2 injection to keep algae low.   If you are injecting pressurized CO2, and are getting fast algae growth, you most likely need to ramp up your CO2 concentration for your given lighting. I would slowly increase this until algae begins to fall or you see distress in your livestock.   If you currently have no livestock, it is an opportunistic time to ramp up your CO2 and get the algae back in balance."

Here's my original post to SCAPE, a local planted tank forum:     I've kept shrimp successfully for a few years. (Rilli and Amano)   Last week, my 10g CO2 injected EI tank with 3 Amanos, green neons, and rasboras in it started showing some issues:    One Amano turned blue(!), and started acting like it was having issues. It was lethargic, laying on its side, etc. Within 12 hours it was dead.  2 days later, I found the second Amano dead on the floor of the tank.  Checked today and couldn't find the third anywhere... found him on the floor, beside the tank. Dead.    So, CLEARLY there is an issue with the water quality! The question is, what is it?   My fish livestock are healthy, and don't seem to be struggling in any way, so I doubt that CO2 is the issue. So I think it is likely to be Excel dosing, or something wrong with my newly mixed EI ferts. (Specifically, my CSM+B mix.)   In my 10 gallon tank:    I'm dosing 1mL of Excel per day.  30ml from 500ml of distilled water with 4.6gm of CSM+B dissolved in solution. (IE- 500ml of water + 4.6gm of CSM+B = solution from which I dose 30ml) every other day. 30ml of macros, alternating from the micros."

PlantedTank,3b3d4j,plantmolester,3,Thu Jun 25 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"The algae looks like black busy algae, which is I think lack of carbon.. having above 30ppm carbon will cause it to stop spreading, but won't initially kill it..

Which could in turn lead to the black bush algae in the first place."

PlantedTank,3b3d4j,nekt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"Well algae grows best in an imbalance. Too much/little nutrients, light, or CO2. So, you can cut back your light time or get some CO2 or Excel."
PlantedTank,3b3d4j,Astilaroth,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:24:26 2015 UTC,Excel will melt your vals. Don't use it for such primitive plants.  It's not a maybe. It melted every single one in a tank I tested the theory on.    Excel also usually leads to inconsistent co2 levels which also leads to algae.  Try dosing potassium and nothing else until you are sure you need more.  Vals can do fine without additional co2.
PlantedTank,3b3d4j,Astilaroth,2,Thu Jun 25 18:34:10 2015 UTC,Take the carbon out. It filters stuff out that the plants actually need. It's only useful if you want to get of medication in your tank after having dosed it long enough and such. A well cycled healthy tank is better off without active carbon in the filter.

PlantedTank,3b2u5z,War_machine777,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly in a tank with existing substrate that you don't want to bother with to remove, you can use water column dosing (dump dry ferts straight in) once the CO2 is implemented and the plants will grow just fine. They won't grow as well as root feeding but with CO2 I've found they are still very successful. You will want to see where you stand with your nitrates by using a test kit. You will want them ideally in the 10-20 range to ensure no limitation.   You should research EI or PPS dosing to get an idea of the maintenance needed to maintain fert levels while CO2 is being used. You may need to dose some (or all) of the ferts to make sure plants aren't being limited and have enough food, but this will depend on bioload.   The quality/intensity of light may come into play, could you provide us with what light you are currently using?"

Also, make sure your light is appropriate for growing plants. You want a full spectrum light that is strong enough to grow the HC (Baby tears) that you have. If you don't have a light look at getting one of the new 24 hour planted+ lights from Finnex. They aren't the best on the market, but for the price point you can't beat them. For further ferts through the water column, look into the PPS Pro System for fertilizing as well. Green Leaf Aquariums have an easy everything you need package for it. As far as CO2 goes. What is your budget? If you want something cheap and works decently look at the mini aquatek CO2. It uses paintball tanks that are cheap to refill at any major sports store. I have one on my 5 gallon and I have been running it since October on the same tank. (I need to check the pressure level actually)"

Plants do need a certain level of phosphate and if it becomes limiting you may start to see deficiency.   The phosphate in your tank may also compete with binding sites for the alumina/GFO and so its ability to actively remove silica (as opposed to phosphate) will vary.   In my experience the only real way to remove it from source water is via RO/DI systems where your DI resin should pull most of it.   I should note that I find diatoms to be the most desirable form of ""algae"" since a lot of creatures actually consume it (nerites, and otos, as an example).   Note that there are other sources of silica release. In most cases quartz based rock has dissolution rates so slow that its practically inert. Certain sands, or sand mixes, however, do release a lot of dissolvable silica (most play sands have this issue)."

PlantedTank,3az4tl,Spoonheb,12,Wed Jun 24 17:45:37 2015 UTC,"It's a good question, and was actually asked on their forums. The response from the tech's are pretty vague, but I quoted the interesting parts for you:   In a tank that never gets water changes performed, there will be an excess of organics, no matter what the fish/plant load. This organic load will serve to break down the Excel, and it will therefore not build up. Unfortunately, there is no way to test the amount of Excel (an organic carbon source) in a system, but following the instructions will yield the best results.   The statement that Flourish Excel is only available for 24 hours is a valid statement, but is dependent upon quite a few factors (ie: organic waste present, plant load, etc.). In testing this product in ""moderately"" planted aquariums, we found that the 5mL of Excel per 50 gallons was enough to supply the plants with carbon for 24 hours. The Flourish Excel also can interact with organics in the system and be broken down. So, the more fish you have (ie: organics), the less Excel that you will have available to the plants  It is completely safe for them to use the recommended dose of Flourish Excel (5mL/50 gal), but they may see some buildup of Excel over time. The buildup is not a negative aspect, it means that we are likely maintaining a good amount of carbon in the system. Well, if we perform a >40% water change on the system, we will remove any of the leftover Excel that was in the system. We therefore know that at this point it is completely safe to add the 5mL/10gallons.   The explanation seems to be that organics present in the tank before excel is first added may break t down to concentrations too low to be useful for plants. They recommend the first over-dose to compensate for the ""unknown levels of organics"" in your aquarium.   Furthermore, the water changes will typically dilute any remaining excel to basically 0, in which case a bigger dose can be safely added to bring up the levels.

I just did a bunch of maths, and I'm not entirely sure that I'm correct, but assuming a 12/hr half life, at the end of the week there was not a huge difference in the tank. Basically at the end of the week there was like 2.18ml in the tank as opposed to 1.75 ml with the name brand. I don't think that it was the Glutaraldehyde, but instead, some other chemical in the solution.  *by 2.18 mls I meant of a 1% Glutaraldehyde solution"

All I know is that i want one of those pieces of wood and some rocks, i'll probably have a carpet of s repens and probably some taller plant towards the back.   Any advice how to clean the rocks better before I start the tank?  Advice on the substrate? thinking either black sand with root tabs or something like dirt with a sand cap.   Any advice or tips would be great. I'm super excited to get this tank started."
PlantedTank,3b0hb4,apoptart,2,Wed Jun 24 23:57:36 2015 UTC,i just trimmed out a buttload of s.repens out of my 20g if you are interested!  i would group the rocks on one side and shove the stick into it and accent with a few on the other side. maybe bust some of the rocks into smaller pieces. it'll help with scale.
PlantedTank,3b0hb4,nahfoo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:54:39 2015 UTC,"How much would you want for them? I have some in a divided 10g and I love them.

PlantedTank,3b0hb4,nahfoo,2,Thu Jun 25 04:02:41 2015 UTC,"That looks better. I came here to also suggest taking the most plain looking rock and smashing it up. Maybe find a way to make it look like the roots are growing around/ out of the rocks (although it's something I've been using a lot lately, maybe I'm biased, check out my 2 most recent posts to this sub) I'd say make the rocks pile a little taller too but I'm not sure what look you're really going for."
PlantedTank,3b0hb4,nahfoo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah two of the rocks are somewhat large and straight, so i'll probably try to break those today! I definitely like the idea of making it look like the roots are growing around the rock, I was kinda hoping i'd get the perfect rock to put under the smaller woods 'roots', but the 'roots' seem to just get in the way.  I'm pretty open to anything for this tank, I want to make it look a little overgrown with plants once it's filled so anything with the rocks and wood would be great. This is my first real attempt at a hardscape, my other tanks weren't really planned so I'm hoping this tank will give me some insight so I can think about redoing my other tanks.   (also I saw your hardscape and i'm so jealous, I wish my 40b looked that good :P)    Edit: pics using the smaller piece. I really like both pieces but they're hard to situate. Hopefully breaking the two biggest rocks will help."
PlantedTank,3b0hb4,nahfoo,2,Thu Jun 25 17:38:23 2015 UTC,"Break a couple twigs off of the wood to make it fit or once you smash the one rock up, use a bunch of little peices to fit into the roots.   Edit : also thank you,  setting up hardscape is probably my favorite part of aquascaping"

PlantedTank,3b0hb4,apoptart,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:01:27 2015 UTC,You can always break them off but still use them in the scape. In my 40b there are like 6 peices of wood but I tried to make it all look like one peice
PlantedTank,3b0hb4,apoptart,2,Thu Jun 25 20:17:09 2015 UTC,True. I've messed around putting the two pieces of wood together but I'm never sure if there's too much wood or too many rocks (even though there's only 2 pieces of wood and 5 rocks) I just don't want it to be too crowded before I even put plants in.   I will keep that in mind though if I break off the 'roots' maybe I could still place them to look like they're connected :P
PlantedTank,3b0hb4,nahfoo,2,Thu Jun 25 20:55:34 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that depending on how you plant it, the plants may overtake the hardscape"

PlantedTank,3b00gg,enlitenme,4,Wed Jun 24 21:39:30 2015 UTC,Black sand looks better. Just fyi. The white stuff gets extremely dirty extremely quickly. Other then that id do just that and add a bubble wand to the soil (for the trumpet snails) and make sure the buckets water gets changed as much as you feel it needs to. My big concern would be the trumpet snails at this point. If those werent in there id say just close to buckets up and dont worry about it.
PlantedTank,3b00gg,Tatekei,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:51:15 2015 UTC,"He said the black from TSC hardened up. Yes, I can see how the white got dirty!

PlantedTank,3b00gg,IllusionOfHatred,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:42:54 2015 UTC,"I'll say this: dump the old substrate, and start off new. All you need is a dried layer of red clay, 1/2 - 3/4 inches of miracle gro organic potting soil, and an inch or such of pool filter sand: which is dirty white in colour. All in all, it's pretty cheap."
PlantedTank,3b00gg,nahfoo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:15:07 2015 UTC,I kinda wish I would've done this instead of spending like $100 on ada soil for my 40b
PlantedTank,3b00gg,IllusionOfHatred,2,Thu Jun 25 15:50:08 2015 UTC,"Yes and no: Ada soil is pretty much the better soil in the long run, and you're able to redo the tank without  a using a big mess of dirt being pulled up via roots. It's all in purpose, also what you'll be doing with the tank."
PlantedTank,3b00gg,nahfoo,2,Thu Jun 25 16:10:13 2015 UTC,True but it does break down into mud eventually
PlantedTank,3b00gg,IllusionOfHatred,2,Thu Jun 25 16:55:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's good as long you keep it covered via capping substrate."

PlantedTank,3b0072,methodicalmike,2,Wed Jun 24 21:37:45 2015 UTC,You'll need an eye dropper: also include the items inside of the tank.. so let's say it's 5 gallons. So possibly 0.5 ml would do it.
PlantedTank,3b0072,IllusionOfHatred,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:09:50 2015 UTC,What do you mean include the items inside the tank? Like them taking up space subtracts .5 gallons from the overall tank size?  And Im working on finding an old eye dropper.  Can I just poke a hole in the top of the plastic on the bottle opening?  How many drops is .5 ml?
PlantedTank,3b0072,IllusionOfHatred,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:53:44 2015 UTC,"If you want to do it easier, just add like a dribble from the chemical to the tank.. into the cap to make sure it's only a very small amount. Some eye droppers have measurements on then, and .5 mL of the eyedropper could be too much.. 5 gallons isn't  very much. So if the cap full was to treat 50 gallons, you would need a tenth of that."
PlantedTank,3b0072,IllusionOfHatred,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:31:40 2015 UTC,How do I physically do this?  Just a drop or two on top of the water?  Mix it in?

PlantedTank,3b0072,sexytimespanda,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:05:53 2015 UTC,"Should be fine.. I would point the incoming water away from the sponge, chlorinated water isn't good for bacteria directly. If it has mixed with the tank water, and dechlorinator, it should be fine."

PlantedTank,3aynpx,hachi6,5,Wed Jun 24 15:42:27 2015 UTC,"A good method for low tech would be to go walstad.. if I spelt it right. It entails that you use red clay, dirt (I use miracle gro organic potting soil), and then cap it off.. like pool filter sand. It's a cheap way to plant a tank with a decent substrate. Only down side is that you shouldn't move plants around too much, because it will cause dirt to eventually get pulled up above the capping substrate."

Someone will correct me if I'm wrong. I think you want about 1"" of dirt and 1-1 1/2"" of cap.   Edit: I should mention that I have not used this method but have put some heavy research into as I am thinking about doing it.   As for fish disturbing sand, it's not an issue unless you have fish that nest in the substrate. I have corys in a sand bottom tank and they sift through the very top but don't go any lower."
PlantedTank,3aynpx,flabbyjabber,2,Wed Jun 24 18:08:17 2015 UTC,"What I do is about an 1"" of sand, 1/2 of dirt, and just a small layer of smeared; dried red clay. If using gravel, you can technically make it thicker, since it doesn't Compact as much as sand does. Using too much capping, or even dirt can lead to anaerobic bacteria."
PlantedTank,3aynpx,IllusionOfHatred,4,Wed Jun 24 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"I started my first planted tank a few months ago. I'm only using flourish root tabs for fertilization and everything looks great. I have several species of crypts, anubias, floating amazon frogbit, and Christmas moss in a 5.5gal stocked with shrimp and a few mystery snails. I maybe wouldn't recommend the walstead method as it seems very easy to make your tank messy, and you can never gravel vac... Also you need to re-dirt them every few years because the dirt looses its nutrients. But I would definitely recommend the seachem flourish root tabs for easy fertilization. I'm using the finnex FugeRay and it did create a lot of algae at first but the shrimp and snails eat it all now."

It's hard to kill DHG, but the runners are extremely slow I found. It took maybe 3 to 4 weeks to see runners. I think it's almost faster to do it immersed. I'm 2 months in with my DHG dry start, and it's maybe double in size.  HC, the other common carpet, does soooooo well in dry start. It roots and shoots runners much quicker. However, full and dense carpets take 2 to 3 months. If you're just looking for it to firmly root and start running, then I'd say about a month."

About a hour and a half. That is, of course, after I make my weekly pit stock at my LFS that I drive by every day. lol  Also, I was wrong, I only have 1 light on mine 20 right now.

This tank is a work in progress but you get the idea.   http://imgur.com/UC4MvU3  I'm going to move the filter over and put another light on the other side. Add some more plants. Right now it only has java moss and ferns. I'm working on throwing together a diy CO2 system now.   Edit: And goal is a moderately planted shrimp tank. I've got a some panda corys and neons in it.
PlantedTank,3ayoag,thocan,2,Wed Jun 24 23:24:45 2015 UTC,"No, thank you for sharing your setup. I notice that you have your filter on the back. Is that to reduce the turbulence in the water? And I see a simple desk lamp is all that I need now. And perhaps some cory julii later on. :)"
PlantedTank,3ayoag,Ka0tiK,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:32:39 2015 UTC,I put it on the back because that side is facing a wall. I have a backdrop on the tank and it hides it pretty nice.

PlantedTank,3awsf9,myth1n,2,Wed Jun 24 08:33:39 2015 UTC,It might come back it takes about a week to a month for plants to adapt. And bubbles per second isn't a way to really measure co2. Youll need a drop checker to do this.   Edit: plants also like cooler temperatures and colder water means more gas exchange too. But since you're in the cycling process higher Temps are better.... once you're prams level out you should lower temp.

I've grown a lot of it and gave up on it, because the problem isn't getting it to grow, but getting it to stop. You say 'some ott-lite bulb' which are reading lamps, not plant growing lamps, their spectrum could be entirely off for plants. It could also not be anywhere near bright enough for actual growth even if it's a 3-gal tank.

PlantedTank,3awfzv,krattalak,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:35:26 2015 UTC,"Full spectrum lights mean a lot of things to a lot of companies. For example, you could have a full-spectrum bulb that outputs most of it's light in the 500-600nm range (cyan to yellow), this would make it still unsuitable for plants, even it was bright.   (freshwater) Plants primarily utilize light in the 430-450nm (blue) and the 640-660 (red) spectrums, and lights used for plant growth should focus on those two areas.

Used a 1/4 solution of water/h2o2 and it looks like HC is recovering now.  I feel that you run less risk having the substrate dry vs. too wet/damp.  I've read a few people who have preemptively used a h2o2 solution to mist the hc.  Maybe it wouldn't hurt to try that with a weaker ratio.  I'm using the regular cycle for the 24/7+, but I then add an additional 2-3 hours by setting the clock back to 3pm at 6pm (does that make sense?).  I think im getting a 10hr photoperiod.  I'm also using de chlor Tap for my setup, let me know if you have better results with the RO  I'm currently debating whether or not to just say f the dsm and flood.."
PlantedTank,3arm60,oneironology,2,Mon Jun 22 23:53:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response! Glad to hear your HC is recovering. Now I could be wrong but I remember watching a video not too long ago about the PAR values of the planted +24/7 at each hour of its 24hr cycle and apparently the par values between 12-3 are the only ones that will really get HC to grow well! Today was my first day running the DSM and left the light on full for 10 hours 😳 hope I didn't burn the shit out of them
PlantedTank,3arm60,oneironology,2,Tue Jun 23 01:06:44 2015 UTC,"hmm thats a good point, maybe I might try blasting my hc for the next week and see how it responds.  I do have a shallow tank so my par values are probably higher than the average height tank"
PlantedTank,3arm60,LiveAloha-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:14:06 2015 UTC,Ah you are right.. The height will definitely change the PAR levels around quite a bit. Let me know what works best for you!

I only spray/mist once a week and the water line is way below the substrate (but the substrate is always wet due to humidity). I needed the laziest way of doing it because I tend to forget to spray every day. HC spreads quite quickly once it roots, and I sell or give away a batch every couple months.  I keep the lights on about 10 hours a day.  I use tap water with dechlorinator. I have no problems with fungus or algae. Fungus tends to grow when it's too wet."
PlantedTank,3aq4wz,NinlyOne,3,Mon Jun 22 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience with that HOB in particular but it seems sufficient as far as power and flow. You could pull the biofiltration eventually, sure, or just switch to powerhead after. From my understanding, the only reason you would really need the mechanical insert at that point is if you want to clear the water up after moving plants around.   I run the Aquaclear powerhead 20 on a 20g long and the pump is very strong. More than enough for a 30g if all you want is water movement. I have it turned to the lowest setting and the quick filter attachment stuffed with sponge and filter floss because I have a betta in there. The quick filter is just a tube with slits that fits nicely with the powerhead. Came with a cheap sponge roll in the middle. You could easily DIY something of your own. I also use a free Tetra Whisper 10i and a no brand powerhead in 2x10 gallons.   Here is the progress of my latest dirt 10g:  http://imgur.com/a/42q6X"

PlantedTank,3aq4wz,conklech,2,Mon Jun 22 22:21:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, that's kind of the nature of the game: trial and error. Reading the Walstad book is one of the best ways to start, because she aims for stable, low-maintenance, resilient tanks."
PlantedTank,3aq4wz,conklech,2,Mon Jun 22 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"Right, and I'm OK with the trial & error! One of the great things about Walstad's book -- she gives a good holistic picture of the variables that contribute to a given condition, and how they can all be intertwined.  I've considered keeping my waterline at about the two-thirds level to better showcase emergent growth, which would give my water column essentially the same dimensions as a 20-long. That wouldn't work with this HOB filter, but maybe once I have a powerhead...  Thanks for your point below about canister filters, btw. The inline heating option is attractive to me, but a 30-gal flood in the tank's current location would be a disaster."
PlantedTank,3aq4wz,conklech,2,Tue Jun 23 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"I kept the waterline in my 40b low for a while as it was settling in. It's not a bad idea. There are some aesthetic drawbacks: the above-water glass gets hard water stains you have to clean up if you have hard water, and your lights are liable to shine in your face as you look in the tank. (Normally total internal reflection prevents that problem--the light reflects off the front glass.)  Also if you go the ATI sponge+powerhead route, the height of the powerhead is determined by the length of the rigid tube down to the sponge; you might want to pick up an extra tube so you can cut one down to size and then change your mind."
PlantedTank,3aq4wz,RiddleRiddle,2,Tue Jun 23 18:46:27 2015 UTC,"I keep a Walstad-style 40b with either an AquaClear 20 or 30 sitting on top of an ATI #3 Pro sponge filter. It used to be in a 29g. The flow is about right for either tank. I think a 50 would be overkill, but who knows. It depends a little on your plants and fish--some love a lot of flow.  I want a good deal of mechanical filtration. There's a lot of mulm and other crap floating around in my dirt tank--it's pretty heavily stocked. The sponge does a good job of getting it all in a nice tidy clump that I can pick up and squeeze into a bucket. A canister with a bunch of coarse sponges inside would work too, but it's overkill so long as you have good plant growth taking care of nitrogen levels. Cleaning the canister is a bit more of a project, but in some ways easier if it's designed right: you just disconnect it and haul it into the kitchen. You won't get ""crystal clear"" or ""polished"" water with just a coarse sponge, but IMO that's not the point: a proper Walstad is too full of plants and fish to be admiring the water.  If you have the HOB already, you could just keep it and see what happens. Nutrient distribution isn't as critical in a Walstad as in a high-tech tank with a lot of nutrients and CO2 in the water (and being consumed rapidly). Heck, people do ""no-tech"" Walstads. Keep an eye on things and be prepared to do big water changes if the chemistry goes crazy, but a heavily planted dirt tank is pretty resilient.  One thing to keep in mind: while canister filter failures are rare, they have the potential to siphon your whole tank onto the floor. With a sponge+powerhead, there's nothing going over the edge of the tank other than power cables, so that won't happen short of tank failure (or earthquake)."

It doesn't mean one is better than the other it just means that you need to find out what PAR you need for you plants. If you want carpets, reds, or other high light plants then you want the finnex or both lights at the same time (depending on how tall your tank is) if you want medium/low light plants the current will work fine. I have a current on my 30 gal and it works great for the crypts, rotala, anubias, bacopa, java fern, etc. I have a finnex on my 20 that grows glossostigma and alternathera reinekii.

Combination of stess and not eating I think. The larger gourami would pick on him whenever he tried to feed, and it got the point where he just gave up. Keep them separated, and get in the habit of feeding him a small bit every time you walk by your tank, so he begins to associate you with food. That made mine perk up a bit."
PlantedTank,3and8s,izmar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:30:35 2015 UTC,"I've lost 2 DGs :(.  One passed when I moved away and my parents were looking after my fish.  The other just sort of did what yours did and stopped eating then was gone.    It may have a parasitic infection, mine did.  Even though it was really hard to see, my male died of HITH disease unfortunately.  Once it's bad enough to see it gets a lot harder to treat.  Keep them apart and get the sick one some metronidazole, an antibiotic that helps tremendously with parasites and bacterial infections, and treat the fish every day until the symptoms go away.  I hope your fish buddies are alright!"

PlantedTank,3akvaz,strayacarnt,2,Sun Jun 21 05:53:44 2015 UTC,"You can always poke the substrate with a stick to let out all the bubbles. I generally do it in the first few weeks after setting up a dirted tank, its good to do it as it helps prevent anaerobic conditions in the substrate.  Biofilm is just something you gotta deal with since you have (had?) no water movement, the airstone will help though as the water is not stagnated anymore. My biofilm did disappear after my tank had settled down though (No filter).  These things are common with newly set up dirted tanks in my experience."

Move them back to where they came from. If not possible  (if that tank has been emptied out or that filter run dry) keep them in this on and do large daily water changes. Keep a very close eye on your water parameters, especially ammonia and nitrite. Read up on the nitrogen cycle in aquaria. Be very sparse with feeding."

PlantedTank,3aj5bu,Astilaroth,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:44:54 2015 UTC,Probably a flare.  Just used my cellphone for a quick picture.  Pure laziness.  The thing on the right is a Co2 drop checker.  It measures the amount of Co2 using a special liquid suspended in the glass bulb.  When the liquid turns a certain color of green you know the Co2 levels in your tank are good.

Im not sure about the brackish water thing, as I have a shrimp about eight months old and she berrie again. She has produced twice before. I started with four and now have thirteen.  The major concerns are first filtration. The tiny baby shrimp are only a few millimeters and will float in the water after hatching for a few days. So they can be sucked up by the filter. Either turn off the filter or consider sponge filtration.  Second you should have live plants that they can hide in. Eventually they stop floating and will hide. The more the better as they will find bits of food off of the leaves or moss until they get a bit bigger.  Eventually you will see them hanging out on th glass or a leaf, and they will be little miniature adults. I just put a sponge over my filter intake and I got some to survive in a tank with african dwarf frogs.  Your betta might make a snack of the babies i'd wager. I did not have any issues with my ADF earing them."

My boyfriend picked them out and, of course, chose the largest shrimp in the tank at the pet store.   However, as we were doing our bi-hourly examination of them, we noticed something... The larger shrimp seems to have a belly full of eggs. The other shrimp is not like that, so I'm assuming she is pregnant (picture attached, obviously).   Is there anything I can or should do for her? Is it worth it for me to try to quarentine her until she and her babies grow up or should I just let them live and see if the betta eats them?

PlantedTank,3ajtgr,mellor21,3,Sat Jun 20 22:09:09 2015 UTC,"Don't fully quote me on this, but from something I read, I hear that it is beneficial to have a split photoperiod for a couple of reasons. The most noteable (for me at least) is that plants actually produce Co2 when they not taking in light. So basically you break the photoperiod so that plants can finish up a cycle of photosynthesis while producing Co2, and when the lights come back on, they can use that Co2 that they just produced. Once again, don't quote me on that, I'm sure somebody else will tell you if what I said was incorrect. It's just what I read, and why I actually have a split photoperiod on my non-Co2 tank.Just make sure that if you end up running a split photoperiod, try you're best to keep the schedule consistent. You may piss off your plants, and encourage algae. (or so I hear)  Hope this helps!"
PlantedTank,3ajtgr,Embors,3,Sat Jun 20 23:49:32 2015 UTC,"Fish will also produce more co2 during that time. Though without pressurized/diy* co2, you'll never see tremendous growth. The difference is negligible for most.  The biggest benefit is the time you get to see your tank. A lot of people wanna see the lights on in their tank before and after work. This is really only possible with a break in between unless you wanna run your lights 12+ hours (a big no-no)."
PlantedTank,3ajtgr,LiveAloha-,2,Sun Jun 21 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"This is your answer, the siesta period/CO2 relationship is talked about in Diana Walstad's book, but empirically I've never noticed much of a difference growth wise from any CO2 built up between that siesta time."
PlantedTank,3ajtgr,Ka0tiK,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:25:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and that's basically the same principle I read for why people do it with pressurized CO2 as well. But since I'm not running CO2 and I have fish that like lots of O2, I have a ton of surface disturbance which should keep O2 and CO2 levels fairly steady. But I could be wrong and like you say that extra time to build CO2 back up might be worthwhile. So I'm wondering if a more ""natural"" steady light period without the dark would be better. They're on timers, completely consistant. Thanks for the response!"
PlantedTank,3ajtgr,Embors,2,Sat Jun 20 23:55:31 2015 UTC,"No problem!   A little more input from experience, but I had much more noticeable growth in my tank when I had a split photoperiod rather than a consistent one. Just my 2 pesos"
PlantedTank,3ajtgr,xxoczukxx,2,Sun Jun 21 00:01:05 2015 UTC,Another reason to do a split is because plants start to photosynthesize pretty quickly but algae takes up to 4 hours to start so by splitting the light into two like parts with a few hour break makes it so algae doesnt like get a chance to start photosynthesizing

PlantedTank,3ak6y5,unknownrocker69,2,Sun Jun 21 00:23:46 2015 UTC,"It can be a combination of things. First I'd say you need some sort of fert whether it be root tabs or whatever, but I think the main thing may just be that these are new plants.  Sometimes plants will melt when placed in new water conditions and then regrow just fine. This is pretty common especially if you use plants grown emersed. I've had tissue-cultured DHG look completely dead and then grow back in beautifully.  I'd say add some ferts and then just be patient."
PlantedTank,3ak6y5,Verivus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:19:26 2015 UTC,"Probably nutrient deficiency. You said you have no ferts and a inert substrate. Plants can't grow properly without it.   Could also be adjusting to the new environment and introduction of excel, although I'm certain it's a nutrient deficiency.  You also mentioned bad cases of BBA. Figure out why.. It's usually due to poor co2/o2 levels. Usually a fluctuation will set off BBA, so be sure surface agitation and dosing of excel (idk if this affects BBA and co2 levels) is constant. Are your lights on for 14 hours a day? Seems like an algae problem waiting to happen, especially without nutrients and co2."
PlantedTank,3ak6y5,LiveAloha-,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:06:38 2015 UTC,"The BBA was due to no co2 and high lighting and I have adjusted the lighting to low/med. The excel has assisted with killing off the BBA issue and I now know how to prevent it in the future.   My lights are on from 7am-6pm. I dont use the co2 at the moment because I can't turn it off when the lights go out (since I'm not home until 9pm most days) and don't want to kill my fish with a PH swing.  The thing that makes me wonder what is going on is due to the fact that the plants that are dying off are the same kinds of plants that were in my tank prior to the BBA outbreak and were doing fine (other than being covered in BBA) without any ferts. If it is a deficiency, what kind is it? I've been searching the internet for the past few days for answers and can't find any deficiency that causes the stems to turn to mush."
PlantedTank,3ak6y5,LiveAloha-,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"I've read that a total lack of nutrients will cause plants to rot. It makes sense, ferts are basically like food. Without food, anything living will die.  Maybe I can try find a source, but everyone will tell you the same. Unless you're only growing the slowest and easiest of plants (ie anubias), you're going to be unsuccessful without some sort of nutrients. If it was that easy, no one would fert or use nutrient-rich substrates."
PlantedTank,3ak6y5,LiveAloha-,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:34:04 2015 UTC,"If it were a total lack of nutrients wouldn't all my plants be dying?

My wendtii green has sprouted 6 new leaves in just 2 weeks and that's when this issue started. The only thing that is different is the plants that are dying are grouped together, would a lack of light cause this?"
PlantedTank,3ak6y5,LiveAloha-,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:54:03 2015 UTC,What light are you using? Eventually all plants will show deficiencies without some kind of nutrients though.

I don't mean to sound like I'm apposed to using ferts (I'm really not) or that I don't appreciate your input. I am very thankful that you're taking the time out of your day to help me.

I accidentally turned it too much and my bubble counter water went into my CO2 line. Oops.   I then reset it back to 2 bubbles/sec and left.   When I came home an hour later from lunch my tank was gassed. Killed my three neons, shrimp jumped out of the tank, snails were all up around the edge and the betta was just at the top of the surface gasping for air.   The water in the CO2 line caused the flow to build up and when I fixed it to 2 bubbles/sec before I left I thought it was working fine. Then when I came back it was like 10 bubbles/sec.

A tank that small would only need one bag of ADA aquasoil, which could cost ~$30-40 and would significantly improve the roots and health of your plants.  It will also make planting easier.    If you want a good carpet, CO2 is also required.  You could make a DIY yeast reactor for about $5 and it will help with plant growth and algae prevention.  More plants will definitely help with algae.  So will CO2 and fertilizers.  I don't know what your light cycle is, but 6 hours is plenty until you get more plants.  Don't start adding ferts until you have more plants and CO2.  Good luck!"

PlantedTank,3agtc1,Airspeed35,5,Sat Jun 20 01:20:00 2015 UTC,"I was watching your video from another post and your tank is so cool. I can't help much regarding ferts. But algae is simple, it's 2 things: nutrient+light. One or both of those things is out of wack.  Nutrient (waste, nitrate): Are your weekly water changes enough? What does your water test before and after? Is 40% every 7 days removing enough nitrate? What about the ferts? Are you using the right amounts? Are your plants healthy and growing? I'm not a plant expert, but if you were providing too much nutrient for the plants to consume, it would seem like that could help facilitate nuisance algae. And since that tank is pretty well planted and your still having algae, it seems like that might be the situation. Also, is monthly maintenance enough on your filters? That would be fine for the fish, but turtle poop is robust turds in my experience with RES, so I could imagine it gunking up a power filter pretty quick.  light: 10 could be too much (though I'm not sure how much your turtle requires). I've always read suggestions of 8-10. You could try reducing the duration. What about natural or other ambient light in the room? With summer here in the northern hemisphere, your gonna have a lot more light of higher intensity coming in the windows. This is the time of year a lot of people start to develop algae due to that and increased ambient temperatures. Again, I'm not sure how this would effect the turtle, but I've found a lot of improvement after switching my tank to 2 four-hour light cycles. I was told that algae requires 4+ hours of continuous light to grow. So I cycle my lights 4 hours in the morning, then off for a few hours, then 4 hours at night. For one, this better matches my work/home schedule so I can observe my tank more. Secondly, it seems to have helped a lot with algae, at no expense to my fish or live plants.   Also, I don't see a lot of posts here about planted tanks with turtles. You may get more reptile-centric answers in one of the reptile or turtle subs. Good luck!"

The lighting suggestion is great.  Ill try that too.  Thanks.
PlantedTank,3agtc1,DelusionalX1,2,Sat Jun 20 04:26:38 2015 UTC,Do you have water test sets? Buy at least a nitrate and phosphate test kit.  Nitrate above 25mg/l or ppm is bad and phosphate above 1mg/l or ppm is bad.  Having both 0 is also bad and will cause algae so just try to keep it between 0 and the values I mentioned.
PlantedTank,3agtc1,DelusionalX1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:52:02 2015 UTC,Thank you. Did you see my picture of the schedule on which I add the fertilizer? Do you think I should back off on some of those or the water test results will answer that?

I don't use tap because I don't want that white mineral line when it slowly evaporates. But yes, water is fine.  The 30 second to a minute thing sounds wrong. It's usually measured by bps (bubbles per second). For a 20 long, I'd imagine somewhere between 2-4 bps. It really depends on surface agitation, type and quality of diffuser, plants, etc.   Another way to measure co2 is a drop checker (just google it). I don't use a ph controller. My co2 is on a timer. It is useful to test your water parameters to see what affect co2 has on your water and fish.   The Milwaukee regs are known to be the 'cheaper' option, so yes, there are more malfunctions and the quality is lacking. They use cheap needle valves that sometimes don't hold steady/hard to adjust.

PlantedTank,3aexq9,ebrammer252,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:00:20 2015 UTC,"bottom feeders (corys, shrimp) you can use bottom feeder pellets or wafers. They will also sometimes grab food when it gets to the bottom but ideally you should limit your pellet or flake food from getting to the bottom to reduce nutrient and detritus buildup.   Nerites will eat biofilm and algae, and require no external food source most of the time.   Most feed every day or every other day. Typically you want to feed for three minutes, or until your fish lose interest in the food, whichever comes first. Most fish can go a few days without food (up to 1-2 weeks sometimes). Some, including myself, will set one day every so often where I specifically do not feed them to allow their digestive systems to ""reset"" or if I see bloating."

PlantedTank,3ada2v,IllusionOfHatred,2,Mon Jun 22 04:44:21 2015 UTC,No CO2. Low tech for sure. I did dose with excel though for the first 8-12 months.   Regarding the tannins.. are you on the west coast? From what I've read we're blessed/cursed with a ton of wood chips / pieces in our bagged potting soils.    I had a bit of that early on but not as bad as I've read / seen from others. I soaked my dirt for about a week (I've read a month is best) to get out the potential bad stuff. Another benefit is going through it time to time during the process to get the wood parts out since they'll eventually float to the top of the bucket. You obviously get the majority out just from rinsing the soil prior to tanking but even after a day or two of soaking more kept floating to the top.  HUGE EDIT sorry its been a long day and should have added. My biggest gripe by far from this 20g has been the flourite cap. This shit was gunking up my filtration process until the past 6-12 months.

Yes, the advantage of the more expensive pressurized system is a ""set-it-and-forget-it"" system once you dial-in the bubble rate to maintain the 30 ppm CO2. All other things being equal, you can set a timer on your lights and tank and the CO2/lights are completely automatic. All that's left is dosing which many do before the lights go on or when they feed their fish as part of their daily routine.   If you have even more of a budget, you can even buy a timer automatic dosing system (seen more frequently on reef setups). At that point, everything is dialed in on automatic timers and it gets even more hands off (other than maintenance and refills).   If you have automatic systems on all three (CO2, lights, dosing) it works perfectly for us out of town fairly often with spouses or family members we don't trust with dosing :)"

It will most likely continue to stretch up to the light like it is."
PlantedTank,3abis5,Ka0tiK,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:46:20 2015 UTC,You're already dosing Excel so CO2 will be fairly okay for the time being.  The only downside is that Excel will keep on costing you while switching to pressurized CO2 will save you a lot.  The general rule for pressurized CO2 systems is to get the most expensive system you can afford so I would keep that for later on.

It takes practice to balance those three elements to get a nice, beautifully flourishing aquarium: Otherwise you'll have algae, or dead fish with too much co2.  With the T5s, you may want to try the wisteria: Great plant that can take a beating; Additionally the java fern is a great pick also.. just make sure to have to attached to either a rock, or drifrwood. The T5s may be too powerful and cause algae.. doesn't hurt to add some type of diffuser, or replace with weaker bulbs."

Java fern tough and low requirements, tie it to something like your driftwood or rocks. Keep the rhizome above ground. Anubias similar to Java fern requirements but grows slower. And Java moss or a variation, you can make a moss wall/carpet if you can't find anything to carpet. Few ways to make a wall but I spread it out sandwiched between knitting mesh() then just give it time. I've heard blending the Java moss then spreading it over the mesh and doing a moist start works well but have not tried it yet so wouldn't suggest putting all your supply in this method. I've heard some people get glosso to carpet in lower lights but never messed with it so can't say for sure.

PlantedTank,3aazdf,Connundrum1,7,Thu Jun 18 18:08:26 2015 UTC,4-5....my wife said that so I came home with a 45 gallon. Got her
PlantedTank,3aazdf,BuenoD,14,Thu Jun 18 19:45:24 2015 UTC,"Hi OP, it seems others are recommending the Fluval Spec V, and I vouch for it too. It's a 5.5 gallon but people refer to it as a 5 gallon, so you can get in that extra 0.5 gallon with no one at your office being the wiser. :D The light is fine (it's okay, but if you want plants to thrive you'll need to upgrade the light to something stronger) and the filter is silent and strong (problematic and will require a pre-filter mesh for betta fish and/or shrimps).   Frankly though, I would advise not getting any fish because I don't believe any species could be happy in a nano-tank. It's possible as a lot of people on /r/Aquariums argue, but you need to be active with checking for pH, temperature, ammonia and nitrate readings, and do water changes probably twice a week (a hassle, considering this is in an office setting). I would advise getting shrimps because they're fun to look after, don't require as much water changes (open to elaborate if need be), they're really active, are really colorful and flashy, and will grab a co-worker's attention. You could push it and try going for a betta fish, but keep in mind betta personalities differ so it may or may not get along with invertebrates. If you want to have both betta fish and invertebrates, I would advise getting a feeder shrimp or two and see how they do. Results should be your basis for whether or not you should get shrimps. Rabbit, ribbon, apple, and mystery snails are awesome but mind you their bioload can get quite heavy so you should keep like 2 at most.   As for plants, you can just Google 'easy beginner low light plants.' Frankly I think the plants that do well given basic lighting and lack of CO2 are wisteria, hornwort, crypts, java fern, anubias (betta fish love these), cabomba, lymnophila, java moss, dwarf water lettuce, frogbit, red water lily, and bacopa (you should look for these on /r/AquaSwap). I'm sure there are more, but I'm not an expert on plants. After you receive plants, you should place them in a separate container with de-chlorinated water for isolation. This helps to check for algae, snails, or other hitch hikers and/or pests. If you're impatient, you can always treat them with peroxide (for more than just algae) or liquid carbon (algae), or even bleach (treats for everything). I would advise to treat your plants because there's nothing more annoying than a booming pest snail population, and you having to order in assassin snails (they kill pest snails well, but they will never eradicate pest snail populations). If 'easy beginner, low light plants' sounds unappealing, you should start thinking about CO2, fertilizers, and light. Consider whether you want plain sand + dry ferts (much cheaper, and open to elaborate on this) or nutrient enriched substrates. Then you want to consider using liquid carbon (least expensive, but 5 out of 10 imo), DIY CO2 (cheap short term, around a 7 out of 10 rating imo), or pressurized CO2 (10 out of 10 rating, fact). Lastly, you may want to upgrade your light to something stronger. There are plenty of strong and cheap lights out there and only requires searching, but being a Finnex fan (bias) I highly recommend the Planted+ 24/7 (honestly the best out there in terms of cost, how many things it can do, how strong of a light it is, and how much you can customize it).   I think that's all. If you need more information, I'm always willing to respond. Good luck OP.  Edit: Included segment on plants."
PlantedTank,3aazdf,hyseung,10,Thu Jun 18 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"The only thing I would argue with this point is that if you do want fish there are indeed fish that will do well in a tank this small. I have pygmy corys that get to be 1 inch long, scarlet badis which max out at .7 inches and pygmy livebearers which max out at .8 inches. My tank is only 6 gallons but 24 inches and well planted giving plenty of room to swim horizontally. I also fully support the shrimp decision, but recommend checking water parameters in the office first as well."
PlantedTank,3aazdf,Enivel19,4,Thu Jun 18 20:39:12 2015 UTC,"For reference, this is what a pygmy cory looks like in a standard 5.5 gal. There are 7 in this tank, plus a betta fish."

PlantedTank,3aazdf,Is_This_Invalid,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:22:00 2015 UTC,They need much more space than 5 gallons. I have glowlights in a 40B and they use a ton of space.
PlantedTank,3aazdf,Verivus,3,Fri Jun 19 10:01:40 2015 UTC,Agree 100% about the shrimp.  I actually have a 5 gallon tank at my office and started with 8 blue rili shrimp and a nerite snail.  They've been breeding like crazy and all my coworkers are enjoying watching them.  All I have on there is a small fluorescent bulb but the hornwort I have in there has been growing like crazy.  It's been pretty low maintenance and I love it.
PlantedTank,3aazdf,quadrupletree8,3,Thu Jun 18 21:26:03 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure ANY betta fish would gladly move out of their tiny cup at the store to live in a fluval spec :P

PlantedTank,3aazdf,mmmichelle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:08:42 2015 UTC,"Following on to what Hyseung said-  The Fluval V is a great tank for what you're looking for, and I too recommend a Finnex 24/7 or Planted+ light.  CO2 is almost a must- it reduce algae (by boosting growth of plants and thus out-competing it). I'm in the middle of a big replant/reorganization so it's quite untidy (moss wall unsecured, diffuser in suboptimal position, and floating plants), but here she is.  I can heartedly recommend Dario Dario (scarlet badis) [photos not included due to formatting hell] as a superb nanofish (although 'needy' due the live food requirement), and Cherry shrimp are quite easy as well.  If you're looking a cool schoaling fish CPDs are also fantastic.  What's your budget for all of this?"
PlantedTank,3aazdf,DasKnocker,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"One cool thing about cherry shrimp is they are fairly tough compared to most shrimp and you can pick from quite a few colors, just don't get multiple colors in one tank if you want to keep the solid colors."
PlantedTank,3aazdf,AquaticRick,2,Fri Jun 19 06:23:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I like just getting a plain tank, filter of your choice, and a light from Finnex or whatever brand you like. It also might depend on what you plan on stocking, bioload, and light demands of any plants.   I planned out my work tank (2.5g) to account for the fact that I'm only there 5 days a week and sometimes go on vacations, so it can go for up to a week without any maintenance and no catastrophes occur. Lots of plants, and emerging plants like Pothos help soak up nitrates between water changes.   Shrimp and snails are also great for helping keep solid waste and algae in control, without contributing too much to the bioload."
PlantedTank,3aazdf,magnetic_couch,2,Thu Jun 18 18:00:22 2015 UTC,"Heya,  I would recommend the below tank.

PlantedTank,3aakcb,Ka0tiK,2,Thu Jun 18 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"I think many new guys are over-thinking these fertilization systems. To be honest, they all use the same base ingredients (potassium nitrate for nitrogen, mono potassium phosphate for phosphorous, and the potassium component in the two above. Both use CSM+B or similar for traces). I've seen some sulfates added in for any additional needs.   So what is the difference? Essentially, only in the dosing amount, water change amount/frequency, and philosophy. EI focuses on excess nutrients so that everything is non-limiting and the focus is on CO2/light, where PPS tries to streamline fert usage to reduce excess nutrients.   Both of these can't account for what lighting you use, its duration, and the CO2 you are injecting. It makes the exact recommendations rather silly in my opinion since light and CO2 control consumption by plants.   At the end of the day, most veterans aren't truly embracing either, its more of a hybrid of the two. For me, as a chemist guy, I like the testing component so I strive to hit certain ppm targets, and measure accordingly. Am I doing EI here?, no, since I am limiting the ferts, but I'm not limiting them to the point of PPS.   I'm a firm believer that we can all find success by proper trial-and-error and adjustment for each of our own tanks (each with their own variables and challenges). You just have to know what to look for (algae, plant deficiency, etc.)"

I wouldn't worry if it's recently cycled just reduce light maybe get a fast growing plant and wait it out. It won't harm fish just looks bad to us and will compete with plants.

I was dosing the daily maximum amount recommended for a couple of weeks before I got a case of wicked green water (not sure if it was caused by ferts).  After it cleared I did not dose at all for a month - and then began dosing 1/2 the maximum amount with good results so far.  HC took quite awhile to root and take off - I'd say 4-6 weeks before it really took off.  If you have not grown HC before - I recommend keeping it very short.

You may want to consider better aeration, which can also mitigate algae issues; and possibly lower your lighting time to 6-7 hours with a break in between.   I get the impression this is a pretty new tank; typically, it takes a bit to achieve some level of equilibrium, and until that point, algae will likely be present. Just stay on top of the water changes, keep CO2 and water flow good, and manually remove what you can, and things should come under control before too long.   Good luck!"

I figured i would be struggling with algae growth but i didn't realize it would get this bad.   i forgot to mention, i have my return going straight into a circulation pump (going to be where my co2 returns to, so it can blow around the tank) so that's helping slightly with aeration.   i'll definitely look into reducing the lighting down until this either stabilizes or corrects itself.

PlantedTank,3a6sxl,methodicalmike,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:43:00 2015 UTC,"Depends what kind they are. Best thing to do is giving them some sort of land to climb up on when they start getting front legs. While they're tadpoles you can feed them algae pellets and bottom feeder pellets. Then they switch to a more carnivorous diet when they get into the frog stages.  Tadpoles are actually incredibly hardy, especially toad tadpoles. They have to mate, lay eggs, grow through metamorphosis all in the period of time it takes a mud puddle to dry up after rainy season."
PlantedTank,3a6sxl,abqcub,2,Thu Jun 18 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"What kind of tadpoles are you looking at getting? Different species have different requirements.   You'll need a landing area unless its a fully aquatic frog. If its a toad, it'll hardly ever want in the water and will need substrate to bury itself in.  Depending on the species, I think its very doable, but they'd probably need to be the focus of the tank.  Just keep the fish and the tadpoles the same size and you should be fine. Some species of frog like little fishes, but that's when they're full grown.  Most tadpoles eat algae pellets and bottom feeder pellets, then worms and bugs as they get larger. I would imagine something docile like a cory cat will help clean up the bottom. Just make sure to get it some friends.  You could probably do a really cool river type set up."

PlantedTank,3a2zf2,onijin,3,Wed Jun 17 03:40:43 2015 UTC,The tank is a 29gallon tall. I have 2 30inch t8 ballasts. One has a 6500k bulb the other has an exo terra amphibian bulb. A tetra whisper in tank filter with bio bags without the charcoal and a small exo terra repti flow 200 pump for the water feature. I have a small submersible heating pad under the gravel that i put on a 12 hour cycle in the winter.   The false bottom is made of that light grate stuff from the hardware store and i use coconut fiber as my plant substrate.

PlantedTank,3a2zf2,onijin,2,Wed Jun 17 21:49:11 2015 UTC,A paludarium is always welcome in a planted community.
PlantedTank,3a2zf2,PookMePlz,2,Wed Jun 17 15:05:04 2015 UTC,"Technically it'd be a riparium, and thusly in the planted tank continuum of... things. So yup. Also very nice!"
PlantedTank,3a2zf2,betta-believe-it,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:52:02 2015 UTC,What's the difference between a Paludarium and a Riparium?
PlantedTank,3a2zf2,nlevend,2,Wed Jun 17 03:51:36 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly frank, I have no fucking idea. I THINK a paludarium has its above-water portion open to the outside world, whereas a riparium is entirely contained in the tank."
PlantedTank,3a2zf2,AndrewRogue,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:06:03 2015 UTC,"Close! But backwards. Paludariums tend to be more like vivariums with a deeper water feature, where as ripariums tend to be more aquarium focused with some terrestrial plants above the water line."
PlantedTank,3a2zf2,D-void,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:50:16 2015 UTC,Paludariums usually have aquatic and terrestrial organisms. People put frogs and little things like that in paludariums. Ripariums are just home versions of a river bank (I think) and mimics the plant life that grows along water bodies.
PlantedTank,3a2zf2,assmuffin156,2,Wed Jun 17 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"I think one is a river habitat and the other a marsh habitat, couldn't tell you which is which without looking it up though."
PlantedTank,3a2zf2,danyearight,2,Wed Jun 17 04:35:12 2015 UTC,My understanding is a pal has a true land feature while a rip only has above water plants.
PlantedTank,3a46sv,nahfoo,4,Wed Jun 17 02:24:59 2015 UTC,I think it looks off because only the empty half of the tank is lit.
PlantedTank,3a46sv,forever_cycling,2,Wed Jun 17 14:55:53 2015 UTC,Good point.  I just threw the light on to see what I was doing and put it on the side I wasn't working on to keep it out of my way
PlantedTank,3a46sv,RiddleRiddle,2,Wed Jun 17 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"I would spread some of the rocks towards the other end, or at least part way, so the right side doesn't seem too separate."

I'm going to take the plants from my 29g which is crypts, stems, moss, jungle val (or a smaller val) and a couple other things. I'll tuck moss between rocks and along branches, the back right will have tall crypts. I'll have stems on top and coming from between the rocks and the val around the base of the hill, probably more crypts back left. I'll buy dwarf hair grass and carpet the rest but I'm not too keen on this scape the more I look at it"

PlantedTank,3a2kll,methodicalmike,2,Tue Jun 16 21:04:56 2015 UTC,snails will be more sensative than most fish and are not a good thing to test the water with if you're trying to conserve animal life. If you're trying to conserve aquarist dollars than I agree with your decision

PlantedTank,3a2kll,RyanGaussling,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:06:38 2015 UTC,TBH it's just water. Make sure the temp is fine and the PH isn't insane and it will be fine
PlantedTank,3a2kll,methodicalmike,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:10:27 2015 UTC,"How would I know if the water was okay via the snails?  If they dont die within a few days, then the water is safe for fish?"
PlantedTank,3a2kll,RyanGaussling,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:36:02 2015 UTC,"That's a really silly way to test water. Just test the PH and the temperature and don't put any nasty shit in there. Remember, these animals live in rivers. The water in a new aquarium is so clean you'd probably drink it and you wouldn't drink out of a river. The stuff that kills fish in new aquariums is hapless newbies putting a full stock in right away before there's been time for a colony of bacteria to develop. The bacteria are required to consume ammonia in the fish urine. If the bacteria aren't already established and your fish pee a lot then they end up swimming in a bucket of ammonia and die. Stock SLOWLY and you won't have problems"
PlantedTank,3a2kll,methodicalmike,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:54:06 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense.  Thanks.  I currently own a pleco and some snails.  I will add them slowly as well as getting a few more plants.
PlantedTank,3a2kll,javi404,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:01:14 2015 UTC,The more plants the better.
PlantedTank,3a2kll,CorvisTheRed,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:21:18 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of a silent cycle either, but it's pretty similar to the Walstad Method. It states you can add fish same day as setup in Diana Walstad's book Ecology of the Planted Aquarium because the growing plants will take up Ammonia. The key is lost of quick growing plants here."
PlantedTank,3a2kll,Ka0tiK,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:47:49 2015 UTC,"I believe it is, as aquatic plants grown above water have additional access to unlimited CO2, which allows them to grow faster (given nutrient sources). You would, of course, want to use fast growers if your goal is consumption of waste byproducts (nitrate, phosphate).   The key in making a silent cycle truly silent is starting with an extremely low bioload with respect to the total aquarium volume. Two small fish in a 55 gallon, for example, is an extremely small load that coupled with proper plant mass will absorb any small spike . You would add additional fish every few weeks as per normal, and as the bioload increases more bacteria will grow to make up for any ammonia the plants can't keep up with.  tl;dr yes, all the usual rules apply - be sure to use at least some fast growers to truly absorb a meaningful amount and start with a low bioload."
PlantedTank,3a4fob,mellor21,3,Wed Jun 17 03:45:57 2015 UTC,"I tend to recommend raising parameters separately, one at a time. For GH, you can use a GH raiser specific product like seachem equilibrium. For KH, many will use baking soda (as they do for cichlid tanks) to raise the KH. To avoid pH spikes (for kH) or rapid chemistry changes, don't raise either more than 1.0 dKH or dGH per day.   Again, in my opinion less is more, so I add as little as I need to, focusing on the specific parameter. You can use the reef builder, but its more of a broad spectrum product that may add disproportionate amounts of other traces. If you do use it, add it slowly.    Based on your ingredient analysis, your carbs and bi-carbs will add to the kH and increase your buffering capacity. All other major ions seem the same, so would have the same affect as replenish. I would follow the replenish dosing instructions if using the reef builder product, being sure to watch my pH as I do it."
PlantedTank,3a4fob,Ka0tiK,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:12:29 2015 UTC,Thank you! One problem with that is the replenish is a liquid while the reef builder looks a lot like salt. How would that affect the dosing if I dose rf in replenish amounts?
PlantedTank,3a4fob,Ka0tiK,2,Wed Jun 17 23:05:35 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is the concern. Even in reefing, when dosing you want to maintain ionic balance, and so some supplements (such as magnesium  dosing) often use magnesium blends (sulfates and chlorides) rather than just dosing magnesium chloride alone.   If it were me, I would veer away from it long term and only use it once or as a backup in case of emergency. Most freshwater fish can tolerate low salinity, but over time it may creep up into a brackish amount which will cause some problems."
PlantedTank,3a4fob,Ka0tiK,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:38:38 2015 UTC,"What I'll do is fill a 5 gallon bucket 4/5's of the way. Then I'll dose it til I'm at 25 times the dh I want (I'll go with the 1dh at a time like you recommended), and check that my kh is good as well, then add that to the tank. Sound good?    Edit, no that won't work, but I can still use this to find out how much I'll need. Figure out how much raises the bucket by 1 gh, then multiply that by 25. Thanks again for the help"
PlantedTank,3a4fob,Ka0tiK,2,Thu Jun 18 01:34:07 2015 UTC,The replenish should tell you how much of it is required to raise the dGH by 1 for a given amount of water. If it uses meq/l or ppm you can convert it.
PlantedTank,3a4iz3,Prismi,2,Wed Jun 17 04:14:02 2015 UTC,"I think I see a mismatch between the co2 tank (paintball) and the regulator (cga 320).

It will save you time, money, and a lot of effort in the long run.  Any tank will do, as when you bring your tank to the brew store they will trade you for a filled tank and charge you $30-40 for a freshly filled one.

A couple things I learned:   Make sure to agitate the surface every now and then. Otherwise, you'll end up with biofilm on the top. Not really detrimental, but kind of unsightly. Agitate the substrate as well, especially if you're using MiracleGro. Gases will build up from the bacteria in there. What I did was just go in with a chopstick before the weekly water changes and poke around, releasing any trapped gas.   Have fun!"

My current setup is a 10g with eco-complete and a colony of cherries. My cherries are thriving with the eco-complete! Sakuras being a line-bred version of a plain-jane cherries should be fine in most commercially available planted tank substrates without any additional additives.  Good luck!

It also grows in a long strand so its really easy to pull out.  Frogbit and dwarf water lettuce are both easy to maintain, it is duckweed that is the herpes of the aquatic world.  Dwarf water lettuce has pale green fuzzy leaves, frogbit has a darker green waxy leaf.  Red root floaters have smaller leaves, maybe a little smaller than a dime, I have some that are pale green and others that are darker, they have tiny white flowers but I've yet to achieve the really nice red roots."

PlantedTank,39ytfn,magnetic_couch,2,Mon Jun 15 22:06:14 2015 UTC,youre feeding too much if theres enough for the pond snails to eat. even if you feed once a week you may be feeding too much food. for just two corys all you need is probably a tiny itty bit of food.

PlantedTank,3a01i4,methodicalmike,3,Tue Jun 16 04:09:26 2015 UTC,"Move the tank out of the window, you'll start getting some horrendous algae over time if you leave it there. Since you're going for a planted tank, you'll probably find yourself dosing nutrients and algae will soak up whatever isn't being used by the plants.  Get a filter, if you plant to have fish you must have a filter. Otherwise, you're looking at doing multiple (2-3) 25-50% water changes throughout the week. You can just get a HOB filter and the surface disturbance should be enough to remove the film. Don't add fish. You can add invertebrate if you want, but I would recommend leaving the tank empty until it's completely cycled. That's the most humane thing to do.   You don't need to poke the air bubbles out, eventually the water will soak into it."
PlantedTank,3a01i4,komse,0,Tue Jun 16 04:19:34 2015 UTC,Well I plan on adding snails and a pleco to handle the algae.    What is a HOB filter?  When do I know that the tank is done cycling?
PlantedTank,3a01i4,komse,6,Tue Jun 16 04:22:18 2015 UTC,"Don't add a pleco to a 5.5 gallon tank. The pleco will outgrow it with the year, probably even 6 months. A HOB filter is a Hang on Back filter, you basically place the filter media and then just let it sit on the back of your tank. A good one is like 20 bucks or something, I think a brand that a lot of people like for HOBs is AquaClear.  You'll know when the tank is done cycling because ammonia and nitrite levels will be 0. You should theoretically be able to drop some ammonia into the tank and get a reading of 0 after 24 hours. API test kit is good for this, liquid testing kit will be more accurate than test strips."
PlantedTank,3a01i4,COMediSun,2,Tue Jun 16 04:27:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I second an aquaclear. Could add a couple Otocinclus instead of the plec."
PlantedTank,3a01i4,komse,2,Tue Jun 16 14:42:08 2015 UTC,OP would just have to remember that otos are more sensitive to water quality.
PlantedTank,3a01i4,Ka0tiK,2,Tue Jun 16 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"Filter usage on a heavily planted tank is a debate (pure walstads do not use conventional filters), but in most cases a filter is beneficial as it creates a more efficient area for beneficial bacterial growth and in some cases adds aeration to the water. It also provides a way to remove larger particles out of the water column via physical filtration to make the water seem clearer and cleaner.   In any case you will want some way to aerate the water to allow proper gas exchange between your aquarium and the air. The water agitation will also reduce that bacterial film you see on the top."

I read somewhere that too much of a cap prevents the water from mixing with the soil causing it to go anaerobic faster. I only have half an inch on my tanks. It works find but sometimes its slightly harder to keep the plants in the substrate.  Just my 2 cents.

Purely based on the look (and compared with the filter tube) it looks like a relatively small tank... L333 can grow up to 15 centimeters (5.9'') so if I'm judging this correctly they aren't suitable for your tank. A lot of info on those beauties here: http://www.planetcatfish.com/common/species.php?species_id=1024  Cardinal tetra's are often kept small, but the minimum recommendation for  a proper school is 10 gal at the very least.   The stones I like, I wonder how they're fit together, did you use kit or just stack them? The top one on the left looks like it might tip over if there's pressure on the right side of it.  Any idea yet which type of plants you'd like?"
PlantedTank,39vu4b,Ka0tiK,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks. The tank is 30g so hopefully there is enough room, the filter is fairly high flow which I will have to manage.  I have clay caves I will hide in the gravel out of sight for the daytime and blue lighting for them to come out at night. I've decided glosso, java fern and hair grass.

This is my fluvial spec v, I ripped out the plastic divider and added an eheim 2213. The more I look at it, the more I wonder why I even bothered purchasing the spec v if I was going to do all these changes. You can see I have one glass lily pipe outflow and the other is still the stock intake, that glass one shattered during transit and I'm waiting on a replacement.  Anyways, not many fauna. Just a single golden mystery snail at the moment. Plants are amazon swords ( I think?), bacopa, christmas moss and some type of lily. Getting lots of conflicting identification on the lily.  I had a betta in there, but the lad took a jump while I was at school and didn't make it. Was shocked he jumped since he's never done that before ever.  I dose it with flourish and excel, buying some GLA ferts later this month. Not sure if I want to try carpeting this or not with it already having so much in there. I'll probably do something like dwarf hair grass since I haven't had much luck with DBT. Among the list of things I've killed are... lots of anubias and dwarf baby tears. :3"

Over the weekend I finally bit the bullet and broke down my tank and replaced the substrate, added two inches of planting substrate and capped it with my old gravel.   Hard work but no other way of getting my plants to thrive,  even the anubias wouldn't grow because they were covered in algae.

PlantedTank,39uscs,specialFX16,5,Sun Jun 14 23:34:16 2015 UTC,"I would say way to much.  Most fish and plants will not be happy with that much flow.  Either get a smaller pump or make a custom out flow designed to slow the stream so it doesn't bother them.  Or maybe rive plants/fish.  There are a lot of factors to how much filtration you need.  Flow is important, but not top of the list.  Flow being 'measured' by how many times per hour 'all' the water in your tank is filtered.  A 10gal tank with 100gph would be 10x.  Some fish don't need much, some require a lot.  Cichlids like clean high flowing water, and I've always heard they should be around 10x.  Right now you are looking at like 28x, which is insanely high.  I think the highest I've ever heard of someone using is 16x.  I use about 6x on my discus tank.  As its a 155 it's very easy to spread out so it doesn't bother the fish."
PlantedTank,39uscs,dsmithpl12,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:51:19 2015 UTC,OK that is what I was thinking as well. I will look for a pump that's around 50 -  70 GPH. Thank you

PlantedTank,39ve02,Ka0tiK,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:19:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly for 20 a week you may want to rent it as you will only really need it once. Essentially you would just be measuring PAR in different areas of the aquarium. If the light DIMs, you can take readings as well on the various dim levels to see where you stand.   I don't find them unnecessary, rather, they can be very educational as light intensity we see as LUX does not necessarily translate to true PAR. You will find that in most cases PAR will be higher under water than in a un-filled tank due to light bending and refraction as it traverses through water, which intensifies light rays at certain areas."

That look is actually pretty easy to obtain. Just need a lot of tall plants for the background and even midground (Swords, Rotala, Bacopa, Jungle Val) and some smaller but still pretty big plants as your foreground (S. Repens, Crypt Lutea and Lucens, Dwarf Sag, even Stargrass)  The only thing with that though is that most plants I mentioned would require more than Root Tabs and Flourish (Excel is fine IMO).

PlantedTank,39vc4a,Ka0tiK,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:41:29 2015 UTC,"liquid Co2 will do the job, but slower, and you will need to watch your light intensity. If you see algae building up quickly, use the planted+ controls to reduce intensity (dim the lights) over the lighting duration slightly. At some point, you will get an equilibrium between light intensity and plants thriving (with small to no algae).   Note that this equilibrium also requires plants to have food available, and the fish will help with that. In my experience you want to keep nitrates in the 5-15 ppm range and phosphates as low as you can but above .5 ppm. If you can only measure the nitrate via your kit that's fine for now."

If you want brightly lit water with a nice carpet of something fancy... don't get a lot of floating plants. If you have plants that can do with less light, like cryptocorynes and anubias, it's not a problem.   Do check out other floating plants as well though, duckweed can be crappy to get rid of while other floating plants certainly are charming too and easier to manage.

PlantedTank,39tutw,chazerr,2,Sun Jun 14 19:20:30 2015 UTC,for fish maybe one small school of tetras and some shrimp. i want the focus to be mostly on the scape. and for the scape I for sure want a good carpeting plant and rock work but i haven't thought to much into it yet
PlantedTank,39tutw,TheChaosMuppet,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend either peacock gudgeons or celestial pearl danios or both, if you haven't had a look at them yet.  They have been super shrimp-friendly for me, gorgeous to look at, and don't require very hot water.  I think the 22 long will give you cooler options for a carpet, with possibly a diversity of looks along the axis of the tank.  If you're into investing lots of either time or money into hardscape, a 60P would lend itself well to a dramatic rocky slope.  I really like long tanks with either hardscape or plants that break the water line."

PlantedTank,39rs14,mellor21,3,Sun Jun 14 03:08:11 2015 UTC,"Floaters and fast growing stem plants are good options. Something like salvinia, dwarf water lettuce, riccia, hornwort, a hygrophilia variant, anacharis, and maybe some java moss in there. Another one most people don't think of is pothos or philodendron plants. Just the roots go in the water and the vine+leafs stay out and it sucks up nitrates like no one's business. You could even try some mangrove plants or adding some planted HOB filters to the sump.   Or just go the hardware route for maximum overkill http://www.marinedepot.com/Korallin_BioDenitrator_w_o_Pump_Bio_Denitrators_Nitrate_Reactors-Korallin-KL9111-FIFRISDN-vi.html"
PlantedTank,39rs14,openzeus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:21:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all of the suggestions!    On the pothos, it would be inside the tank stand so not much ambient light. Do you think the planted+ about 5 inches above it would be too much?    I'm confused by that denitrator. It says its good for tanks up to 250 gallons. But it also says it removes 50 mg of nitrate from 100 liters (26 gallons) over 3-4 days. Which is only .5 mg/l. Doesn't mg/l=ppm? I could definitely be wrong on that. But that still seems like a very small amount. What am I missing?"
PlantedTank,39rs14,openzeus,2,Sun Jun 14 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"I have no idea about the denitrator device, I just know it exists. Reviews from reef keepers are positive. It's probably overkill for a freshwater tank though.  For pothos it will probably be okay near the light. The leaves closest might burn but since it's a vine the ones that grow further away will be fine. It's a really hardy plant that doesn't need much light so even just a bit of light from the fixture would be enough. I've got a pothos and philidendron growing in my tank under a Finnex Ray2 and they've been fine so far."

PlantedTank,39rs14,tommysmuffins,2,Sun Jun 14 16:51:50 2015 UTC,"Water sprite is considered to be a nitrate sponge if you want only fully aquatic plants and you care about the sumps aesthetics.  Any floating or emergent plants are also nitrate sponges, as they aren't not limited by aquatic CO2, they can use atmosphere co2. I would get frogbit as its cheap and easy, and even throw some in the main tank.  Peace lilys work amazing if they are half in the water and half out.  If you are using the sump simply as a filter, and don't care too much about looks, I would fill it up halfway with water and stock it with emergent peace lilys and some frogbit to float on top of the water and fill in any gaps where the peace lily isn't.  Also remember, only active growing plants use a tonne of nitrate, if they run out of room and get too thick they can start to shade their lower leaves and interior leaves, and this can cause them to switch to a different mode of growth, and their nitrate absorbing abilities will fall. Harvest your plants regularly (this actually removes the nutrients from the system, so that if the plants cant just die and put it back in) and keep 25% of the sump free to give them room to grow."
PlantedTank,39rs14,wonderboy2402,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:19:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! Great point about keeping them trimmed down to keep them efficient and growing at max speed.
PlantedTank,39rs14,tommysmuffins,2,Sun Jun 14 16:44:10 2015 UTC,I would go hornwort (floating stem plant which you already have) and salvinia minima.  Just make scooping the salvinia out part of your water change routine.
PlantedTank,39rs14,tommysmuffins,3,Sun Jun 14 14:05:05 2015 UTC,Ive kept hornwort for years. It grows well and is easy to remove and toss to the compost. Only downisde it can shed the needles if it does not like a water change.

What I would do is start manually cleaning algae (clean the walls, use your fingers or toothbrush for the leaves of plants), vacuum out the open parts of the substrate. Then, perform an additional water change if the vac hasn't reduced the water 50%. All of that should reduce your nitrate, phosphate, and detritus load.   Long term, you will need to see if your light intensity is too high, and monitor nitrate creep with a messy puffer if you get a new one. Remember to change only one thing at a time so you can observe the change."

PlantedTank,39pg5n,element515,6,Sat Jun 13 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's fine. It'll all filter out and be clear once you change your water. Just remember to clean your filter too. Make sure the current in your tank is super low too. It eventually killed most of my surface plants sadly."
PlantedTank,39pg5n,element515,2,Sat Jun 13 15:33:15 2015 UTC,The current killed your surface plants or the duckweed did?
PlantedTank,39pg5n,ArtisticAquaMan,8,Sat Jun 13 16:01:11 2015 UTC,Current did. It was fine until I moved and I setup the tank a bit differently. The surface plants don't like wet leaves apparently.
PlantedTank,39pg5n,javamoss,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:31:35 2015 UTC,I was so happy when I got rid of it for good in my shrimp tank. Grows so damn quick it's amazing.
PlantedTank,39pg5n,Farlateal,8,Sun Jun 14 03:50:14 2015 UTC,Yep. If shipped duckweed needs to be rinsed as the roots tend to die in transit. Partial water change will get rid of them.
PlantedTank,39pg5n,SumpCrab,3,Sat Jun 13 14:22:24 2015 UTC,"Looks like it's just flying around everywhere? I call it the green blizzard. I recently added duckweed to my tank and it did the same thing. I had a HOB filter and the force of the waterfall caused it to constantly do that. I had two solutions that fixed the blizzarding:   1: I had an old feeding ring that I suctioned right underneath the outflow of the HOB filter. This allowed the water to fall freely into the tank and allowed the duckweed to rest on the water surface undisturbed. (Downside: If your water level increases/decreases, you have to adjust the rings position, otherwise it will won't do it's job)  2: Take some java moss and create a waterfall with it so that the outflow from the filter trickles down gently into the water. This is the method I'm using right now. It looks really cool and even if the water level varies in the tank, it still works.   If you don't have a huge amount of duckweed, you may also just be able to leave it alone for a while and it will settle into the corners of your tank, away from the filter. I've noticed that it will find any excuse to just blizzard around in the tank. It settles pretty quickly though."
PlantedTank,39pg5n,framauro13,2,Sat Jun 13 14:25:12 2015 UTC,"A local aquarist sold it to me. I have a canister filter but the outflow was very close to the surface. It seems to have settled mostly on my powerhead and my intake. I also moved the outflow to be deeper in the water, but now I don't have a good surface ripple for oxygenation :( hmm. I like your javamoss idea though. I might try that with my other tank that does have a HOB ( but no duckweed ATM)"
PlantedTank,39pg5n,svenniola,2,Sat Jun 13 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why do you want the duckweed? I have always considered it a pest that hitchhikes occasionally on new plants. They reproduces quickly causing all the issues you are experiencing and it eventually obstructs the light. I would never purposefully introduce it to my tank. I have seen duckweed used nicely in ponds to help protect fish from predators but not in an aquarium."
PlantedTank,39pg5n,PoeticalArt,2,Sat Jun 13 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"Well, I pretty sure I have too much light so I wanted something on the surface to help reduce the light.

PlantedTank,39pg5n,PoeticalArt,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:03:24 2015 UTC,"I used it in my tank to provide cover for the other fish.  A lot of my cories would never come out.  Once I had a nice cover of duckweed, they were a lot more active outside of their cave.  Also, due to how quickly it grows, it can be really good for soaking up excess nutrients in the water."
PlantedTank,39pg5n,PoeticalArt,3,Sun Jun 14 00:46:32 2015 UTC,I love having duck weed.   Its perfect for my shrimp and snail tanks (1 each)  Why?

I think I get med/high light on my 10 gallon and low/med on my 29.  I think that you would be good with the plants you listed in a 40b.  My biggest gripe is that the moon lights and normal lights are on the same circuit, so you can't have the moon lights come on and the main lights kick off on a timer...it's all or nothing if using a timer. I belive this isn't an issue with the new planted+ 24/7.  For the picture,  I think that the dome lights are probably just clamp lights  suspended from a hook in the ceiling.  I'd stay away from the t8 fixtures (and t5s for that matter).   Bulbs in the appropriate spectrum are rather expensive and allegedly don't stay in the correct spectrum for more than a year or so."

PlantedTank,39niho,xrareformx,5,Sat Jun 13 00:36:57 2015 UTC,Only a lurker here but that is really fascinating behaviour from an outsiders point of view.  Without seeing the behaviour or testing the trigger (don't want you to harm your fish) I could come up with a couple of theories.  Could be the blue reflecting off of your other Angel is an overstimulate for either aggression or feeding behaviour. As you have suggested and seems the mostly likely cause.  The aggressor may find the change overly stressing and so takes it out on the other fish. Might be the change in how the tank looks under that lighting that they find particularly unpleasant.  Those are the two most likely causes but this could also be a learned behaviour from wherever they where kept before you brought them. One example being the breeder could have had a blue light set up and it's tank mates could have got overly aggressive and so its learnt to protect/ fight back but that is more of a far fetched theory.  There is also /r/aquariums you could ask as well :)
PlantedTank,39niho,manicbunny,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:01:58 2015 UTC,"I would say that one fish is not recognising the other under different lighting conditions. Fish don't see the same way we do, so it's hard to say what that change might be, but LEDs have a very narrow spectrum so the difference could be dramatic."
PlantedTank,39niho,langsci,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:57:21 2015 UTC,"That was my theory, but could that mean I may possibly have a male and female pair? The other never fights back, just stays in the corner and takes it. Its so hard to tell with them."
PlantedTank,39niho,langsci,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"They will have established a dominance hierarchy, and I assume the one doing the aggression is the dominant fish re-establishing its dominance over this strange new fish that appears at night. I don't have any idea what that means for genders.  Edit: this link suggests that angelfish are capable of recognising individual fish they have previously met, but doesn't say on what basis they do so.  Edit Edit: in general it helps with dominance issues if you give the fish enough space + some hiding spaces, or ways to disengage from aggressive behaviour."
PlantedTank,39niho,wiredknight,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:13:53 2015 UTC,How long have you had them?  How big are they?  Usually angels will stay calm until reaching maturity.  The aggressor is probably a male either trying to establish dominance or possibly mate depending on the sex of the other fish.  The blue lights may be just what he needs to set him off.  My guess is that if he is doing it then soon he will be doing it during the day as well.  Blue light is only meant to simulate moon light.  I think its still better to have lights completely off at night unless you intend to watch them.  The mood may be just right when the sun goes down and the moon comes out =P
PlantedTank,39niho,wiredknight,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"I have had them both since Feb. this year. They were roughly quarter size and are now silver-dollar size. Could I possibly have a male/female pair then? The other one never fights back, just sits there and takes it."
PlantedTank,39niho,Noshiba6,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:15:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm I doubt they would be attempting to spawn at that size.  Also still hard to tell sex at that size as well.  But even another male wouldn't fight back all the time.  A dominant male angel can do bad things to a tank.  Angels can be quite aggressive.  I would keep an eye on things and if it starts to get worse you might have to pull one out to avoid death. As long has no physical harm is done and things stay relatively stress free it should be ok though.  Even while mating you will see lip locking and lots of ""dancing""."

I just really liked the dimensions though. I de-rimmed a 10g and had ready bad results. It worked, but its scratched to shit. The edge was very clean to do. I also have a rimless mr aqua 6g long. I built a lid for it. Its not so much that its rimless, it just looks super clean without the black bracket and rimless tanks generally have cooler sizes."

PlantedTank,39nlcx,whatupdock,2,Sat Jun 13 01:02:04 2015 UTC,"What's the size of your current co2 tank? You may have to buy a new dual stage regulator with a manifold with 2 outputs (needle valves) as I do not believe you can modify the aquatech one (try searching plantedtank.net to see if anyone has diy'd that though).   You will need a really good diffuser (Rex Griggs reactor) for the 75, and may just want a separate system as it will take a lot more co2 than a less than 30 gallon tank will.   Also when you have more than 1 needle valve you have to change both of them-so if you change the 75 to output more you have to check the other tank to verify it's outputting the amount you want."
PlantedTank,39nlcx,javamoss,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:41:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I have a 10 lb co2 tank and an inline diffuser  for the 75 . After doing a lot of research  and running around town for parts Im just going to order the aquatech  splitter. My plan was using two inline needle  valves but the cost for two decent  needle valves and a tee are about the same as getting  the aquatech  attachment.

I recently ordered a 2 stage regulator from this UK company, CO2Art, and really like it.  They have some nice looking splitter / needle valve add-ons.  I would confirm with them, but I think the 2 items (~$32 plus shipping) below combined could replace your existing needle valve.  http://www.co2art.co.uk/collections/connectors-adapters/products/push-on-tubing-fitting-with-1-8-male-sealed-thread  http://www.co2art.co.uk/collections/splitters-manifolds-valves/products/aquarium-2-way-brass-co2-splitter-for-solenoid-and-regulator  Best of luck with whatever you go with."

I picked up some large driftwood a month ago, threw it in a spare tank to get it a bit moist for a couple weeks, but I didn't feel like waiting on it to waterlog. I just picked up some slate at a flooring store (had to pick up a whole box but was still pretty cheap) and drilled through it to attach it to my driftwood. Slate tile is way easier to work with than I thought it would be and couldn't be happier with the results. I put the wood/slate in during a rescape/substrate swap so I just buried it under the topsoil/sand and you can't even tell it's there because the slate tile is so thin (but heavy) - couldn't have worked out better for me."

PlantedTank,39jzcf,ThatIsPrettyGood,7,Fri Jun 12 06:55:02 2015 UTC,"Looks like Myriophyllum pinnatum to me, possibly emersed. It's also called Cutleaf Watermilfoil. The waxiness of the leaves suggests they might melt soon, but it is an aquatic plant so you should give it a chance to grow back."
PlantedTank,39jzcf,macroclemys,2,Fri Jun 12 11:55:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that's it! Thank you for that :)  Edit: Sorry how does the waxy appearance correlate to the leaves melting??
PlantedTank,39jzcf,macroclemys,3,Fri Jun 12 12:52:27 2015 UTC,"A thicker cuticle forms on emersed leaves due to differences in obtaining CO2 and losing moisture from the atmosphere. When placed underwater the leaves cannot adapt immediately and the plant sheds them. This looks like the plant is dying but it is not. Unfortunately it can take 2-6 months for the plant to regrow submersed leaves, depending on the species. I'm not familiar with this particular species but usually Myrios are fast growing so I would imagine it would be relatively quick. Nurseries usually grow plants emersed for cost reasons, even though that means the consumer gets shafted in the end. It can be frustrating in this hobby."

People leave it running overnight with an airstone. As for lights usually 6-8 hours works. U adjust from there to find a good balance and yes co2 should run while the lights are on as thats when the plants use the co2
PlantedTank,39k6w0,xxoczukxx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:06:56 2015 UTC,I placed a stop valve in the tubing. Would it help me conserve co2 gas? I don't know what the effects of leaving it running consistently are. Each batch of sugar and yeast last me about a week.
PlantedTank,39k6w0,xxoczukxx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:15:47 2015 UTC,Unless it has an outflow to release the co2 into the room then that is a terrible idea. The pressure can build up and cause the bottle to explode. Also on week is a super short time. What mixture are you using? And what kind of diffuser are you using? Also there are no side effects. If you see fish gasping for air in the morning that means you need an airstone at night

PlantedTank,39ghkz,fishingforknowledge,2,Fri Jun 12 00:00:04 2015 UTC,What is that grasslike plant in your foreground?

PlantedTank,39jks3,ARasool,2,Fri Jun 12 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"Dont know why he thought it was a joke.  But this idea sounds like it would not work with anything finer than gravel. With sand the co2 would probably build up into pockets under the sand and eventually burst causing a big substrate explosion in the tank, making a mess of everything. In larger gravel the bubbles could probably make their way out through some cracks"
PlantedTank,39jks3,xxoczukxx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:09:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure what the purpose would be other than to hide equipment, you could always try it.  I'd go with a substrate like flourite that does not pack together tight like sand."
PlantedTank,39jks3,steamboatpilot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:11:02 2015 UTC,"roots and sand would get into the holes eventually blocking it up , pipework under gravel was a big thing years ago with power heads attached or reversed under gravel filtration with a canister filter having its outlet attached to pipes so the returning water from the filter pushed up from below the gravel to push up and debris or uneaten food , this would work if you had plants in pots ."

Its tough to determine whether the single T5HO will cause similar results or not. I think you'll be fine. If you're looking for CO2 at all (or even not), try your local craigslist anyway."

PlantedTank,39j304,Verivus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:56:46 2015 UTC,So its been dry for 5 months? Since watering it a lot does it seem to improve from before?
PlantedTank,39ia70,flabbyjabber,3,Thu Jun 11 22:18:42 2015 UTC,"I mean for a couple days the fish might be stressed but they should be ok if they get put back quickly. If you change substrates theres a high chance for a mini cycle as a bit of bacteria live in the substrate. What i did was scooped a bit of the top 1/2"" ish of substrate into some pantyhose and hung em in the tank where there was high flow (the bacteria are only in the upper levels of the substrate usually) to keep the bacteria in the tank while near bacteria was building up"
PlantedTank,39ia70,xxoczukxx,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:50:16 2015 UTC,So would you suggest keeping the fish in the 2nd tank until the mini cycle completes?
PlantedTank,39ia70,xxoczukxx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:07:42 2015 UTC,"Another way u could do it is over time too like maybe section the tank into 10ths (in ur mind) and every few days remove 1/10th of the gravel and replace it with sand , wait for it to like settle a bit, then move on to the next portion. A few days might not be enuff, but a week should id think. Its slower this way but less likely to cause any large problems. As for the mini cycle, tbh it depends on how long it goes for. Sometimes they are  gone quick sometimes they last weeks like a regular cycle. Whats the current stock in your tank?"
PlantedTank,39ia70,xxoczukxx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:12:30 2015 UTC,"10 Rummynose, 6 ""green sail"" corys, 4 rainbow fish, 10 longfin zebra danios, 1 small/young pleco, 2 blue rams, some assassin snails, and uncountable pest(bladder I think) snails.

PlantedTank,39ia70,xxoczukxx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:36:37 2015 UTC,It would be linda crowded for a 55 id think but u should seek a second opinion on that.

PlantedTank,39ia70,xxoczukxx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:39:11 2015 UTC,"The assassins don't seem to be doing much. And the lettuce/cucumber/zucchini thing didn't work for me. At all. I've had more luck just picking them off the side when they climb up it.   I just, literally minutes ago, discovered what looks to be another hatching of snail eggs. Looks like little tiny baby snails all over a piece of lava rock. I think I'm going to set it out and let it dry to kill the babies on it."
PlantedTank,39ia70,benabus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:49:24 2015 UTC,"ah if youre not too worried then i mean its fine. if you do get a mini cycle i found it doesnt hurt to add some like safestart or another bacterial supplement (maybe seachem stability in addition to prime) to help it level out easier and safer for fish.  Also, consider rinsing the gravel and tank in bleach as well as doing a light bleach dip for any plants/decorations u have to kill snails"
PlantedTank,39ia70,steamboatpilot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:58:22 2015 UTC,That's another question. What's the recomended ratio for bleach:water for plants? I'm sure I will find more snail eggs on some of the plants. If I were to guess I would say probably on the tiger lotus.
PlantedTank,39ia70,steamboatpilot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:15:03 2015 UTC,"so im seeing about 5% bleach or less is usually what people use. closer to 5% probably the more effective, but dip too long and it can kill your plants"

PlantedTank,39dbo5,stephnd,2,Thu Jun 11 04:41:12 2015 UTC,I normally do put black poster board on the back. The reason for not having it on this tank was because it was close to the window and the natural light coming through was actually improving the growth of my plants in the back. Once I got them to the height and look I wanted I put the poster board back so that the extra light didn't cause algae blooms.

By the way, I'm curious how the floating plants (what are those anyway) affect lighting for the rest of the tank. Do you have a super bright light to help penetrate that surface cover, do the other plants do just fine in the relative shadows, or am I overestimating how much light they block. I want to add floaters like that but worry I'll starve my carpet of needed light."
PlantedTank,39dbo5,Electri,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:26:25 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree!  the plants floating on top are called Lemnoideae(Duckweed). I have 3 lights above the water and the duckweed doesn't affect the light tremendously until they  get out of hand and cover the entire surface. Although they look great and benefit my tank by adding more live plant, I kind of regret putting them in because they get out of hand extremely fast, and can result in my lower plants to die off a bit."

Also let me know if there are some things I should remove or place somewhere else. BTW, gotta love seeing the perfect green co2 indicator. Running an inline diffuser with my canister, before I just had a normal diffuser and that thing was so hard to get perfect circulation of CO2 with...hopefully I wont have to deal with hair algae again.

PlantedTank,39au46,taco_bread,3,Wed Jun 10 17:36:27 2015 UTC,"Nice! I would lower the blueness of the shadows 50% and maybe put a radial filter around the ram and lower the contrast of the rest of the picture, and bump up overall exposure just a bit. Love his long flowy fins. How long have you had him?"
PlantedTank,39au46,verzuzula,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:17:43 2015 UTC,Is that a specific kind of gbr that has the long fins?
PlantedTank,39au46,NuclearQueen,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:04:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's a trait some people try to breed into them, not a specific/separate species. Similar to breeding bettas for colour and fin type.  Google ""long fin German blue ram""—some amazing looking fish."

PlantedTank,39cvbv,kstarks17,2,Wed Jun 10 22:26:32 2015 UTC,"you took ""drift wood"" literally i see.  what is that filter you got set up there"
PlantedTank,39cvbv,dtagged,2,Wed Jun 10 23:14:53 2015 UTC,"Oh! I think you might have been referring to the homemade box filter in the corner?   It's an old Sunny D bottle. there are .5 in diameter holes drilled all around the bottom. From bottoms top the media is: Filter sponge, filter floss, ceramic rings, purigen. At the top there's a .75 in pipe that's maybe 4 in long with half of it in the bottle and half out. Then there's an air line attached to a home made air stone that runs through the lid and into the bottom of the length of pipe.   So as the air stone produces the bubbles water is ""pushed out"" of the pipe. As this water is pushed out of the filter more ""dirty"" water is pulled in through the bottom and up through all the media then leaving out the top.  It works awesome. Way better than expected. I think it would be great for a planted betta sorority or other low flow tank. I'm hoping that as plants grow in ill be able to tie some roots around it and cover it up more."
PlantedTank,39cvbv,Embors,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:04:17 2015 UTC,"Yep! Went to the river by me last year and picked out a ton of wood. All of the wood on the left side and the two long thin ones on the right were pulled from the river. All the floating ones too. I boiled them when I first picked them, boiled them a few months ago, and boiled them again before I let them float. So they've been out of nature about a year.   The filter is a Tetra 40i. I haaaaate it. It came free with the 29g inn the dollar gallon sale. I'm planning on getting either an aquaclear 70 or 110 when I upgrade to a 55 this summer."

PlantedTank,39cvbv,nosindra,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:34:37 2015 UTC,Haha it was just too cute and I had to share it in both subs. I figured r/plantedtank would like the FTS whereas r/aquariums might enjoy the fish more.
PlantedTank,39cdvq,ebrammer252,2,Wed Jun 10 20:36:51 2015 UTC,I would personally hold off on the Mag Floats and Purigen unless you absolutely need them.  My low tech has never needed either.
PlantedTank,39cdvq,dirty_ronin,2,Thu Jun 11 02:08:42 2015 UTC,"I'd skip the test kit if I were you (I don't think it's worth it, haven't really used my test kit since I got it like 2 years ago - I just take samples to the LFS if I'm really curious about parameters). I'd also recommend going with topsoil (sprinkled with slow-release ferts) over Miracle Grow - I switched a couple weeks ago and I/my crypt collection love it. I'd also ditch the Mag-Float and Purigen unless you find you really need them. (Purigen you may need though if you do go with Miracle Grow as it'll release some tannins, turning the water tea-colored, and that'll be the quickest way to clear that up.)  Also, if you're going for really-low maintenance, cross out the green hygro and wisteria as they'll probably require frequent trimming/replanting than all of the rooted plants you've got listed.  Any plans for the hardscape yet? Driftwood might be worth considering as you've mentioned some plants that will need their rhizomes tied down and not buried, as well as your mosses (and I'd stick with just one to begin with, probably Java moss - it's easy but can be very beautiful if done right)."
PlantedTank,39cdvq,nlevend,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:26:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks I appreciate the input! I'll definitely skip on those things then!   I'd really like to do driftwood and some rocks, but I'm having a damn hard time finding driftwood locally (I'd want to see it before I buy it).

PlantedTank,39ehqv,methodicalmike,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:55:55 2015 UTC,"The soil might be ok since the water holding agents seem to be natural and not of the floaty white perlite kind. Seems to be long term nutrients which is good but might give algea due to massive nutrient release in the beginning. You should sift the soil and then mineralize or air out to minimize the risk of algea.  Any inert sand that won't affect the water parameters should be fine, just don't use to thick of a sand cap.   The plants you listed are good for this type of tank but you should also get some root feeders like swords or cryptocorynes to get the benefit of the dirt and so their roots can oxygenate the dirt so it won't go anaerobic. Make sure you plant at least 50% of the bottom preferably more.   If you notice you get algea then lower your light period, 6 hours on works fine for me in the start.  The pleco might not work in a dirted/sand tank. It might dig and send dirt all over the tank.   You should read the relevant guides in the helpful guides section and also read on walstad, a dirted tank does not need to be a walstad but much of it applies.  You can add fish when ammonia and nitrite is 0 and nitrates round 20 or so. You should absolutely get drop tests for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, ph, kh, gh.  Best of luck, dirted tanks are great!"
PlantedTank,39ehqv,PJMagicflute,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:52:50 2015 UTC,"I didnt know that plecos were plant uprooters..  Is there a way I could have the plants in the tank without a substrate or a way for them to be uprooted?  Maybe in net pots?  Also, do I leave the plant weights on the plants when I plant them? What do you mean by plant 50% of the bottom?  You talking about the plant or the tank?  Thanks!"
PlantedTank,39ehqv,PJMagicflute,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:18:42 2015 UTC,"Uprooting the plants is not what I'm concerned about with the pleco, but if you think about how plecos whip about on the bottom and then you think about your ~1 inch sand cap protecting the dirt. It won't take much for the pleco to whip about and get down to the dirt layer and then you have dirt in the water which is unsightly and could cause algea due to elevated nutrient levels. You could try it though maybe the pleco won't disturb too much.  Remove the plant weights.  I meant as in planting plants over 50% of the bottom area of the tank. With a dirted tank you need lots and lots of plants to take up nutrients and you preferably need both fast growing stem plants and floating plants like the ones you have on order and also rooted plants like swords cryptocorynes and such."
PlantedTank,39ehqv,PJMagicflute,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:28:38 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, now I understand.  Im going to try and add some large stones and hiding places for him so hes not swishing around dirt and sand.  Do they sell a water test kit that tests for all of those things?"
PlantedTank,39ehqv,PJMagicflute,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:01:21 2015 UTC,"Ok, that might work, do not add too big rocks or objects on top of the dirt though since that could make it anaerobic, add the dirt around the rocks. I placed a piece of driftwood on top of the dirt and got sulfuric acid bubbles, they are gone now but it could have gone bad.  I think the api mastertest or masterkit or something is popular in the states if that is where you are from. I'm from Sweden and I use a tetra kit."

PlantedTank,39d8k9,blomhonung,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:59:02 2015 UTC,"Id make sure you get the waterproofed kind, and aim for something in the 6500-7500k range for white, 445nm for blue, i believe?  I don't know if the actual light output will be enough to make a ton of difference though.  You could alternately just get a glass top for it."
PlantedTank,39d8k9,jynnjynn,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:31:02 2015 UTC,"Just get a standard white strip, possibly an RGB as well if you want to play with colors.  Make sure it is the waterproof variety.  There have been a few builds on plantedtank.net using LED tape and the most common mode of failure is corrosion at the solder joints (since the expoxy needs to be scraped off to make a connection).  I would recommend using silicone there if the lights will be exposed to high humidity.  Also I suggest running the strip at 10-11V instead of the usual 12 to keep the temperature down and greatly extend their life.  The cheap switching supplies have a adjustment screw you can use to tune the voltage +-2V."
PlantedTank,39b8ka,HollowImage,2,Wed Jun 10 16:10:07 2015 UTC,"I assume you're planting stems straight into the substrate? When I had anacharis, I'd tear off the leaves on the bottom inch or two of stem, first. Then I'd grab the bottom tip of the plant with plant tongs (http://www.amazon.com/Fluval-Flora-Stainless-Steel-Planting/dp/B004H1MV5A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1433956463&sr=8-2&keywords=aquarium+plant+tongs) and push it down into the substrate. Then, pull the tongs apart slowly, still in the substrate, so that gravel fills in between the tongs and the plant stem. Don't pull the tongs out until they're not touching the plant anymore.  It takes a little work to master the technique."

PlantedTank,39b8ka,spinnetrouble,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:43:43 2015 UTC,"Shoot, that may be a constant difficulty. I used to have gravel similar to that, and anacharis just has a hard time staying down. I recently switched to sand and haven't that problem.  What ended up working best for me (I wanted an anacharis forest) was to put the stem in horizontally or at an angle instead of straight down.  Best of luck!"
PlantedTank,39b8ka,krattalak,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"Edit: if your anacharis is floating into the air, it's way beyond my help. :P  Anacharis doesn't grow roots; it's a floating plant when it's left alone. The part buried in the substrate will die off in time, but as long as it doesn't rot all the way through the stem, the rest of the plant should stay put.   One thing you can try is using plant weights to hold one end down at the substrate level without burying it--it'll give you that planted/vertical look without killing any part of it."
PlantedTank,39b8ka,spinnetrouble,2,Wed Jun 10 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"Anacharis does grow roots. It just takes a long time. All mine are rooted, I know because I have to routinely pull it out by the roots to keep it from growing in random places in my tank."

PlantedTank,39b8ka,WAemsFishGuy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about lead plant weights myself (seems like there are a ton of things that are more likely to kill livestock than trace amounts of lead that's managed by water changes, but yeah, no, lead is definitely not ideal), but you can buy ones that don't contain lead, and high-quality stainless steel mesh might work, too--it's great for mosses and plants that will eventually root in the substrate, but I'm not sure how big a piece you need to hold anacharis down."
PlantedTank,39b8ka,WAemsFishGuy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"I used to have TONS of anacharis as a background wall (dont like the cheesy backgrounds people tape to tanks) and I had the same issue. if you allow it to float, it'll shoot off small little roots to feed from the water column, I found that planting with those helped secure it better."
PlantedTank,39b8ka,mna_mna,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"so you're saying let it float for a few weeks and then use the roots (i have 1-2 with said roots but i didnt know how they grow - thanks!) to help with the stem?  question is, if the roots shoot off mid-stem, i should probably just cut off up to 2 inches below that, right? thoughts?"
PlantedTank,39b8ka,nosindra,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what I did. I don't think those off shoots act as ""roots"" per say but more so as anchors while the substrate roots grow. I'd find the lowest side roots I could find, cut off below that and plant. Sometimes you can make 2-3 cuttings from each strand as long as you have enough side roots to keep the stem anchored down. I either left the rest of the side roots above, or cut them off if I didn't like the look. I wish I had some to show you an example, but I threw all of mine away because it was overtaking my tank when I added CO2."

Therefore, it doesn't really make sense to put too much energy into getting a price count of bps. Find the sweet spot in your tank where you have good co2 without stressing your fish.

PlantedTank,397x3p,AfroWairus,3,Wed Jun 10 01:33:08 2015 UTC,"Aqueon Cue 2.5 ranges from $40-50usd depending on whether you get it online or in a store. Sand, stones, and gravel cost $5 each. I am using a soil substrate in this tank capped with the gravel, the soil was miraclegro organic choice potting mix, which cost about $6 for a small bag. For the plants I scavenged from my 29 gallon, so they were basically free. I plan to get a heater as well, which will be in the $10-15 range. So in reality, not too bad cost-wise compared to something like a fluval edge, but if you can afford the larger model or a fluval spec 2.5 I'd reccomend getting one of those over this."

PlantedTank,397x3p,ddbllwyn,2,Wed Jun 10 03:06:20 2015 UTC,Word of warning to anyone looking to purchase an Aqueon Cue: light distribution is kind of bad as the filter casts a large shadow on the back of the tank. Stick with a good substrate and low light plants and it shouldn't be too problematic.
PlantedTank,39b2uv,mna_mna,2,Wed Jun 10 15:27:08 2015 UTC,"Keeping your aquarium in a window probably isn't helping your algae problem, but that's not the only reason and it sounds like you have other things you'd want to address with the substrate change.  I changed the substrate in my tank to ecocomplete and couldn't be happier.  I went from white sand to dark ecocomplete and the fish and the plants both seem to be happier.  Once you get your plants really growing, the algae will be less of a problem, I'd think.  They also say that increasing CO2 would help.  So, light is a good thing, but only if there is enough co2 to allow the plants to ""digest"" the sunlight better.  Faster growing plants would decrease the amount of nutrients for the algae to eat.    That being said, changing the substrate is kind of a pain in the ass.  I don't think keeping the water would matter as much as keeping the filter media wet.  And if you're just capping your old gravel, I wouldn't wash it because the bacteria is growing in your old gravel, so that would help with the cycle.  And make sure not to let anything dry out.  Just my 2 cents."

PlantedTank,39dqtg,Hopczar420,5,Thu Jun 11 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"It is always a bad idea to buy any living thing on impulse. Personally i have spent about 2 months now researching and making sure my next tank will be just right for the fish i get.   With the pipefish, you basically cant have anything else in the tank that feeds on live food that the pipefish does. They are very timid fish and will be easily scared away from any sort of bullying. You can have other fish in there with it, as long as they don't eat the same things the pipefish will be feeding on. They are a bit difficult to keep as they require an almost constant supply of live food in the tank. Also, you will probably want to use a sponge filtration system. Especially since this is, I am assuming, your first time ever keeping pipefish. If you don't, you just risk filtering out a lot of the food you are putting in there for the fish.  Also, while i do get why your post is getting downvoted, i don't think its right other people aren't trying to help at all. Yes it was a bad thing that you impulse bought a living creature, but this community should be helping you in not making that mistake again. Or, at the very least, helping you to make sure that fish is well taken care of."

PlantedTank,399t4s,briseymo1,3,Wed Jun 10 07:49:10 2015 UTC,"I started my first planted tank 6 months ago and for the first 3 or 4 my plants grew just fine with only eco complete (and excel + liquid ferts). I added a few root tabs here and there between two tanks. I used Flourish tabs at first, then bought a pack of API tabs a month and a half later. There wasn't any sort of day and night difference that I could tell but there was slightly better looking new growth and possibly faster growth as well.  The Flourish tabs seem to last much longer, however it makes me wonder if the nutrients are dispersing adequately. I moved some gravel around recently and found the remaining bit of a root tab i added months ago.  The API tabs seemed to disperse throughout the substrate much better but the API tabs are VERY messy. The second they hit the water they began to disolve.   The Flourish tabs would probably be what i would buy again. They might be designed to disolve very slowly to last as long as they can and they werent a huge mess. Downside is the Flourish tabs are double the price. $20 isn't bad as they last forever though.  Also, unless you like the looks of the sand over eco complete, theres no need to cap it. I've got no experience with sand but i remember the amount of moving things around i did at first and that cap might not last long :p"

PlantedTank,399t4s,ISaidGame,2,Wed Jun 10 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"No but it all depends on the plants really. Excel helps growth to the point that I would never not use it. All plants need carbon and if you're not going to do pressurized CO2 then excel is the next best thing. Liquid ferts help mostly for plants such as Anubias, Java Fern, and mosses which are generally left with their roots exposed because they feet from the water column. If you're only going to have stem plants the root tabs are probably fine.   I dose iron, potassium, micro-nutrients, and excel now, but the only thing I'd say you shouldn't pass up is the excel. The dosage isn't very high at all and a large bottle will last you months."

PlantedTank,398lzb,3rdworldMoN,2,Wed Jun 10 01:16:34 2015 UTC,"Perhaps someone more with more experience can provide some insight. But  1) I do not know too much about the long bulbs, but I own an LED for my tank. LEDs are expensive. On the flip side, they use less energy and produce little to no heat. The high expense of LEDs will be offset by the difference in electric bills between the two types of lighting.   2) All the fish you mentioned are tropical fish, therefore one would have to suggest using a heater. In 71-74 degree water, some fish may be fine, but over time you will probably start seeing some fish become lethargic and sick. I would stick to 76-80 degrees.   I would not get a heater rated below your tank. It will not produce enough heat to warm up all 20 gallons and the heater will be on 24/7 trying to keep up which will waste energy.   Make sure you also get a thermometer. This is to help ensure your tank is the proper temperature. Simply changing the the AC temperature in your house will effect your heater.    3) Java ferns,swords, and some crypts are more towards the category of low light plants. Where as most warts are medium to high. I would make a plant plan after determining what your watts per gallon will be. Check out aquariumplants.com (under U.S Vendors at the top) to find which plants fit your lighting. Do not forget about fertilizers. You will need liquids for the plants like Java Ferns that get their nutrients from the water column, and root tabs for root bearing plants.   4) Bioload seems ok. I don;t know how a crab or crawfish will do.  5) Once your tank cycles (and I would strongly suggest for you to do a fishless cycle) then the water parameters are usually easy. The biggest concern is the parameters of your natural tap water. It is worth testing Ammonia, PH, Nitrites and Nitrates of your tap so you know what your adding to your tank, you can then add the required chemicals to control any problems. API Masters Fresh water testing kit is a good place to start. Accurate tests with clear instructions .  6) I can't provide too much insight on the filters. I have heard / read most people prefer HOBs. I personally use sponge filters.  I know you said you have read alot. But just in case, make sure you read:  http://www.sudeepmandal.com/hobbies/planted-aquarium/low-tech-planted-tank-guide/  http://www.plantedtank.net/articles/Basics-to-starting-a-Planted-Tank/4/  http://www.fishlore.com/NitrogenCycle.htm"

I have read those 3 links you have posted atleast 4 or 5 times each and I will review them again before I purchase today. I will definitely review my plant plan and go over it with my LFS employees. I did not know about the root tabs but will ask my LFS about it as well. Fishless cycling is what I have already decided, I plan on taking atleast 2 weeks but more around 4weeks~ to cycle before I add my bioload slowly. The heater is definitely something I needed confirmation I will definitely be picking up a 50-100 watt heater to keep my temp closer to the 80 degree mark. I dont think I will be able to afford LEDS I really wanted to know the PRO/CON's of T5 vs. CFL. and just more information from you experienced planted tank owners."
PlantedTank,398lzb,Sine_Pi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"The best advice I could give is once you have decided which plants you want, research them - figure out how they propagate, signs of nutrient deficiencies and any additional information.   For instance I had purchased a crypt a few weeks ago. About 2-3 days after planting it, about 30-40% of the leaves were melting off. I thought I had killed it and was about to remove it from the tank until I had found out crypts go through a process called crypt melt when they are moved from one tank to another.  Now the plant is going just fine and displaying various shades of purples reds and greens."
PlantedTank,398hvp,BasedEthan,2,Wed Jun 10 00:44:59 2015 UTC,"Well...  First, you're WAY overstocked on fish.  Neither rainbow sharks, pictus cats, nor plecos are suitable for a tank that size.  You should return them or rehome them.  If you just have standard sand capped with gravel, you probably want to stick to plants that feed from the water column, or get some root tabs for fertilization.     As for what plants would look good.. that's really up to you.    Maybe browse through some sites that sell aquarium plants and see what you like the look of, and determine their care.   this site has pictures and categories based on where in the aquarium the plant would typically look best.   There is also a ""low light"" and a ""beginner plant"" section that might be a good place to choose from if youre sticking to a low tech tank.  Do you know what type of light you actually have?   Brand, model, par rating, or anything?   if it is just the stock light that came with the tank, its probably not going to be great for plants, but you should be fine as long as you stick to low light plants."

PlantedTank,396lha,DougTheBugg,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:02:22 2015 UTC,I don't like being the bearer of bad news. That doesn't look like pearling. You say anacharis isn't doing well your tank kinda proves the point that isn't pearling.   To answer your question - plants need time to settle. Give your anacharis a bit of time and if it doesn't bounce back try repositioning for better light or else fertilize.
PlantedTank,397ss6,Luvbroadway9,8,Tue Jun 9 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"I love how you have a 14 picture album of the same thing linking to; common goldfish, banana plant, in-between the rainbow and blue gravel, and large bubbles"
PlantedTank,397ss6,ddbllwyn,6,Tue Jun 9 23:07:49 2015 UTC,"First of all that's very very very small for a common goldfish. They need at least 20g for one and then 10g per additional fish. Secondly if you want to have stem plants that grow roots into the substrate you will need to provide some sort of fertilization since that substrate probably doesn't have very much benefit for your plants. Either root tabs or dosing ferts will do. Thirdly you will have trouble growing a carpet plant in low light conditions. If you want low light plants that won't need fertilizer you will want to look at java fern, anubias, and anacharis. You could try and get a carpet of java moss but prepare to have a mess on your hands unless you want to put the effort in to making a mat of it. Cherry shrimp are tropical and do much better in warmer water while goldfish generally thrive in cooler water. They aren't the best match. Snails might work as far as inverts go though."
PlantedTank,397ss6,Mirarii,3,Tue Jun 9 22:31:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, commons need at least 55 gallons for one fish plus 15 gallons for every additional common. Fancies you could get away with 30 gallons for one plus 10 gallons for every additional fancy."

PlantedTank,397ss6,Mirarii,6,Wed Jun 10 03:11:25 2015 UTC,"Please rehome your goldfish and research up more on fishkeeping before diving into planted tanks. Your fish will thank you. As already sad that is a miniscule tank for a goldfish. Absolutely miniscule, no fish should ever be put in a 3 gallon let alone a goldfish which grow to huge sizes and need very powerful filters. If you've put a goldfish in a tank that small it leads me to think you're a beginner when it comes to fish, and you should do more in depth research on fish keeping and specific fish before starting a planted tank. For a planted tank to be successful you first need happy healthy fish."
PlantedTank,397ss6,drysider,3,Wed Jun 10 04:39:26 2015 UTC,You're gonna have to get rid of the goldfish there's just no way you'll be able to keep it there. Might wanna double think cherry shrimp as they could turn into expensive betta fish snacks. To be able to grow a grass like plant let's say dwarf hair grass for example and have it carpet you're going to need at least root tabs and you'll definitely need some sort of light for it to carpet properly.

PlantedTank,3946tq,whosthetroll,2,Tue Jun 9 03:43:50 2015 UTC,I am using the solution that came with the drop checker
PlantedTank,3946tq,whosthetroll,2,Tue Jun 9 03:45:11 2015 UTC,"The reason 4dKH solution is used is for an exact measuring standard. The indicators that use tank water or tap water are guessing that your tank or tap is around 4dKH, but if your carbonate hardness is off by a few degrees in either direction, or if there's other factors in the water like elevated phosphates, etc., they can affect the ability of the bromethyl blue (PH Regent)to properly indicate your CO2 concentration."
PlantedTank,3946tq,steamboatpilot,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:55:25 2015 UTC,What do you suggest I should do? Get a different drop checker or something else?
PlantedTank,3946tq,PippyLongSausage,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:59:43 2015 UTC,I don't think you need to mix the 4dkh solution with the fluval drop checker solution.  Its the orange stuff that you have to mix.  If you have two hob filters and low water level in the tank there is going to be a lot of surface agitation.  The drop checker also takes an hour or so to change so keep an eye on your fish when you turn up the co2
PlantedTank,3946tq,WAemsFishGuy,2,Tue Jun 9 17:45:45 2015 UTC,You have to get the 4dkh water and add 5 drops form that little bottle to the 4dkh. It doesn't work on its own.
PlantedTank,3946tq,PippyLongSausage,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:49:47 2015 UTC,Are you sure? I've been using one for a few weeks with just the included solution filled to the suggested line and it's been working great for me.
PlantedTank,3946tq,whosthetroll,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:50:50 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on the solution. Mine came with a bottle of brown colored liquid that you add to 4dkh solution and it turns dark green.
PlantedTank,3946tq,cmdR_CHRIS,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"Over the next couple of days, increase your BPS. Say 1 additional BPS each day. See if the solution changes at all, and watch your fish for signs of oxygen deprivation. I have heard that those Fluval Drop Checkers take as much as 5 days to change colors instead of the 2hr they say it does. I'm not saying yours will take that long, but at least give it a day."
PlantedTank,3946tq,whosthetroll,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"I see, on packaging online it says 2 hour at max. I will wait and see then."
PlantedTank,3946tq,cmdR_CHRIS,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:13:53 2015 UTC,"Diatoms on anubias will happen regardless, anubias grow slowly allowing diatoms to grow on them. Do you have an algae clean up crew in your tank? They would take care of what little algae you still have.  It is probably bad 4dkh solution. Are your plants pearling? If they are your co2 is fine.  If you have the time to dial your co2 in, I suggest you increase your bps by one bubble every minute until your fish start lurking at the surface. They are starting to be oxygen deprived so now you need to reduce the bubbles per second every minute until they resume normal behavior. This is how I dial in the co2 in all my tanks. I have never needed to use a drop checker. You need to constantly monitor your aquarium for this dialing process to work safely. If you increase the bps and walk away coming back a minute later to check, you could gas your fish and kill them."

PlantedTank,38z624,Enivel19,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:35:05 2015 UTC,I think medium to high. I had to play around with timing quite a bit and I don't run them for very long. I'm convinced the plants look healthy because of the dirt.

Then when it came time for a new tank it leaked about 1bps so i would disconnect the tubing at night. A week later...new tank...leaked about 3-4bps so i let that tank run out and am now shopping for a proper set up. If you ordered it on amazon contact customer service by entering you phone number. Youll get a call, explain the whole situation to them, and you'll get a full refund via your method of payment. You dont even have to return anything due to the shipping laws."

PlantedTank,392dql,openzeus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:09:02 2015 UTC,"If you're going to go pressurized Co2 I would recommend getting a 5lb tank and a proper regulator. The up front cost is a bit more but the price of refills on the 88 will eventually make it a more expensive long term option, plus you've already seen the cost of an unreliable type system.  If you have a 20 gallon tank or smaller you could also try out DIY co2 system."
PlantedTank,392dql,Juddston,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"Get rid of that thing and step up to a proper pressurized system, as others have said.

PlantedTank,391fua,Phillsen,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:51:03 2015 UTC,"18000k on a freshwater tank?   Well, anyways, have you looked into led lights? They might be smaller and could fit your needs. They are more expensive though, but will be cheaper long term (don't have to be replaced from time to time and need less power).   About the LEDs, you can't compare it by wattage, you have to look for lumen. It pretty much depends on what kind of plants you want to keep, so it varies from 70lm/g (lumen per gallon) to nearly an open end.   Do you already have an idea about the plants you want to keep?   Edit: I just saw your comment, sorry though.   For low/medium light plants you can stick easily to 70lm/g.   A lot of people are talking about led lights on here, I'm sure you can find some useful information in some posts from the last few weeks"
PlantedTank,391fua,nahfoo,2,Mon Jun 8 16:44:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, yeah the 18000k was suggested at local fish specialty store. From the advice they've given me I'm starting to think they are more hobbists and don't get theory. That said, that light does say it's suitable for freshwater tanks and it does wonders for making rthe colours pop but also mentions that it works best paired with a 6-7000k light.

PlantedTank,38z9h6,apoptart,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:33:41 2015 UTC,If you're talking about anubias and java ferns collecting the debris in their roots it is natural. No amount of extra flow or anything is going to stop it. All you can do is shake them out from time to time or let them be.  Plants are nature's filter.  Now if it's stuff getting caught on your stem plants and their leaves then yeah you might have a flow problem.

After that, I'd recommend feeding less and cutting down the hours of light the tank receives.   You definitely have excess something and your daily feedings are pointing me in that direction.

PlantedTank,38y4cl,Juddston,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:54:06 2015 UTC,"Test your phosphates, you should have zero ideally, I'm guessing yours are pretty high, and don't break up the light cycle, 8 hours tops. And yeah, totally only feed your fish 2-3 times a week, they won't starve. But it is a very lovely colored algae that you have there... ;-)"
PlantedTank,38y4cl,xwikkiex,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"Breaking up the light cycle into two blocks is a great way to fight algae, in my experience.  He definitely needs to reduce to about 8 hours, but I would keep it in two 4 hour blocks instead of one 8 hour block."
PlantedTank,38y4cl,Juddston,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:32:06 2015 UTC,"Not something I've ever tried, I have a tank I'd like to experiment with though. How much time do you leave the tank dark between the two four hour blocks?"
PlantedTank,38x0sf,unknownrocker69,5,Sun Jun 7 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"High light and no CO2 is asking for BBA to be honest. I had a problem with it for a while and manually removed a lot and then did a 3 day blackout which seems to get rid of a lot of it. Once the plants filled in and made a jungle all my algae problems vanished, guessing the plants are outcompeting the algae now.  Edit: can you turn a bulb off or something to lower your light?"
PlantedTank,38x0sf,DampRice,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:06:28 2015 UTC,I haven't done much research on co2 before now so I didn't know you should have a high light you need high tech. I was looking up BBA last night and then I realized my mistake and now have to deal with this. I've been keeping the lights off for the past month but it didn't make a dent in it. My plants stopped growing and the BBA kept going. The only major difference with the lights off is that it doesn't cover the glass as quickly. Would manually removing the BBA and getting a co2 system help keep kill off my BBA?  Edit: I can remove 1 bulb from the fixture.
PlantedTank,38x0sf,discwing_duck,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"Manual removal should be easy enough on the glass, but pretty tough for the plants. Are you opposed to adding new critters? Amano shrimp, Nerite snails, true Siamese algae eaters and even black Mollys will eat it. Is your tank estimates and plants all grown in? You can try adding some floating plants to out compete the bba for nutrients."
PlantedTank,38x0sf,UnifiedAwakening,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:07:16 2015 UTC,I have 4 nerite snails and I'm a few small fish away from fully stocked. My plants were starting to grow in but the algae is slowing them down quite a bit. I had some glass shrimp when I first set the tank up but one by one they've started to dissappear and my angles may have something to do with it... will angles eat the amano shrimp?
PlantedTank,38x0sf,UnifiedAwakening,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:31:38 2015 UTC,I deal with this and Staghorn algae. I have a 29 high light with CO2 and still have some amounts. It's being fixed at this time. Since you don't have CO2 yet I would recommend taking the plants and to quick dips in H2O2 and/or excel. It will kill it.
PlantedTank,38x0sf,openzeus,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:06:05 2015 UTC,"I just bought 2 co2 kits (each rated for a 40 gallon), gonna dunk all the plants in excel, scrub and soak the driftwood overnight, scrub the living tar out of the tank, spot treat any other spots with h2o2 and plant new unaffected plants to out compete the BBA. Do you think there's anything more I can do? What about any pieces of BBA the filter may have sucked in? Or do you think if I can get the tank under control the filter won't add any major amounts of BBA back in the tank?"
PlantedTank,38x0sf,slidewithme,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:22:57 2015 UTC,"Be careful putting plants in peroxide. It works wonders but if I were you I would take one plant that is heavily affected and hold it by the roots. Dip it in a mix solution of peroxide and try to get the water close the the same temp. Then while holding the roots dip the plant count to 3 then pull it out and shake it. Do this once or twice then add the plant back in. I believe the algae will take a hit much faster than the plant so they don't need much time in there.   When I initially did the peroxide treatment I left them in for too long. It killed all the algae but also burned the plants. Recently on my Spec V I had some BBA growing on my Bacopa and I did the method stated above starting with an Excel mixture then a peroxide mixture. I found that by doing it quickly this way still killed the algae and didn't affect the plants. All plants react differently though. I'm starting to believe the best way to use these treatments is to have patience. We want it gone right away but I think it's a good idea to do a test on a plant so you find the right mixture before doing all of them. Once you know the proper mixture, if the issue ever arises again you know the proper amount rather than guessing and you can do more plants at once. Head up, by taking the plants out of the substrate it will kick stuff up. It's best to do this just prior to a water change.   Start with a highly affected plant, do the dips, then place back into tank and give it a day and see how the algae reacted. If it starts turning reddish pink then the dip was enough to kill most of it. Also if leaves are incredibly infected I would just cut them and take the loss. The plant will grow new leaves to replace them. I think using a heavily affected leaf/plant would be a good start because if there is enough algae on the leaves they will probably never go back to the vibrant green they were before.   I think doing the tests on a plant that may need its leaves cut anyway will help you with proper dosage and timing. Record your results.   Like others have stated you can do a peroxide mix in a spray bottle when your doing a water change next. I recently did this. Given I wasn't able to get to all the leaves and decided it would be better to cut them then to try and kill all of it.   In regards to the filter, I think gently cleaning the filter while you have the media and sponge in some tank water would help to eradicate any spores/algae that could have gotten in there. I personally haven't cleaned my filter since I setup months ago and that may be why I'm having an issue. I recently bought another filter of the same type and put it in. Once I'm positive that is seeded I'm going to clean the hell out of my original one other than the media and sponge. The only part on the filter I have cleaned is the intake tube. I just soaked it in hot water with peroxide for a while. I didn't scrub anything out during or after but just rinsed it and places it back in. It does have stuff stuck in there on the walls but I'll be cleaning that once the 2nd filter is seeded.   The most important thing when cleaning the filter is to make sure you scoop out some tank water to soak the biomedia and sponge in as they are the key to the whole system. You can give them a shake in there to remove excess debris but don't use chemicals you just want them rinsed with tank water."
PlantedTank,38x0sf,discwing_duck,2,Mon Jun 8 04:48:26 2015 UTC,"BBA is the worst. Mine sprang up when my co2 ran out and I was too lazy to get it refilled. I kept it in check with manual removal and shorter light period. When I got serious about removing it I had to prune or remove most of my plants, took my wood out and let it dry completely, and scrubbed my filter tubes and bars clean. Then I did a full 4 day blackout with a double dose of excel every day. Now it's sparkling clean after I added new plants and kept the light period a bit shorter. If anything it was a good excuse to do a rescape."

PlantedTank,38ts11,silenc3x,5,Sat Jun 6 19:23:03 2015 UTC,"High Tech Fluval edge 6 Gallon.  My first tank, currently about four months old (incl. 1 month for cycling).  Plants: HC cuba, dwarf four leaf clover, Heteranthera Zosterifolia (Star Grass), golden lloydiella, Lobelia Cardinalis, java moss, anubias  Fauna: 2 dwarf puffer, 1 oto, 3 nerite, 2 amano, 3 RCS + a few MTS  (surprisingly they all get along fine, the puffers have no issues with their tank mates)  Lights: 3 10” fugerays mounted to the wall + top of tank, stock fluvial edge lights turned off. My lights come on at 7PM, so I can enjoy the tank while Im home every night from work. I cover the tank in a blanket during the day.  Filter: Stock fluval filter with purigen instead of carbon. Keeps it super clear.  Water Upkeep: I do two 50% changes weekly. One on Wednesday night and one on Sunday night. Might be overkill but whatever.  CO2: ADA bubble counter + ADA pollen diffuser + Paintball co2 conversion with regulator. The lights are on an 8 hour timer, and the co2 is on timer as well, set to come on 60 minutes before the lights. I run 1.5 BPS which the puffers don’t mind, even though the pH swings like a full point.  Dosing: I dose with the full flourish line, including excel. It’s really easy and I don’t use too much where the cost plays much of a factor.  Feel free to ask questions.  Also for anyone to speculate on: Some of my clover leafs are developing brown spots which turn into holes, but I can’t figure out what is causing it. The holes get bigger and eventually turn the whole stem brown and dead."

PlantedTank,38vg8x,davdev,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:11:43 2015 UTC,I would doubt some reserve salt would increase gravity very much at all. Op could always put them in a fresh water bucket for a week or so and do before and after gravity readings on the water to find out.
PlantedTank,38vg8x,VoilaVoilaWashington,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:09:00 2015 UTC,"Doubt it, since any salt would have been dissolved when they were boiled (assuming the water was changed out a few times).   Even if a few grams remain, a bit of salt can be good for a planted tank for micronutrients.   For a 25g tank, you would need about 5 lbs of salt to make it like seawater, and about 2 for brackish. A few oz wouldn't make much of a difference, although it wouldn't be ideal."

PlantedTank,38sjsw,AnatlusNayr,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:12:16 2015 UTC,"An extract from ""The Natural Aquarium"" by Satoshi Yoshino & Doshin Kobayashi, Page 71;   a peculiar plant disease affecting aquatic ferns often breaks out during late summer and during periods of high water temperatures. If the plant growth is dense, losses among the plants will be correspondingly high. Diseased and dying leaves are removed (cut out). Affected runners are carefully identified and they must then also be removed. Moreover, it is important to make sure that during the summertime the temperature in the breeding tank is not too high. It is adviseable to take precautions the the water temperature does not exceed 28 degrees   Sorry, it was a cut and paste from somewhere I found long ago. My guess is that the light is too intense or the water is too warm. However, I've read high tech tank journals with beautiful java ferns in extreme high light and fairly high temp as yours. I know and have experienced anubias rhizome rot, but not java fern rhizome rot."

PlantedTank,38qt9e,jaquatics,6,Sat Jun 6 05:03:06 2015 UTC,"Driftwood. I drew a diagram for someone a little while ago to show how I assembled it. I have two pieces of driftwood and six anubias plants and some java moss just growing on the wood. P-P is plants just holding on to other plants via roots, P-A is plant anchored. So as you can see, the plant in top/back corner is basically just floating there in place with it's roots holding onto a better anchored plant. At cleanup time I just pop it off and start my gravel vaccuuming in the corner.   My rough diagram:  http://i.imgur.com/NH9QOar.jpg  Then here is what it looks like underneath. My rams and cories dig it. These pics are from a few months ago, the anubias has since gotten thicker with a bunch of new leaves and anchored itself in better  http://i.imgur.com/nr2Ol4X.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/DwjiK69.jpg"

PlantedTank,38qt9e,dswbg,2,Sat Jun 6 04:54:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting. Nice tank.  I am interested in your experience with the tiger lotus (is it tiger lotus?).

PlantedTank,38trh9,Prismi,2,Sat Jun 6 19:18:22 2015 UTC,"Aquatek makes some good cheap regulators. With Aquatek you have the choice of going with a paintball tank setup or a standard co2 tank. The initial cost of a paintball setup is lower, but the refills may end up being more annoying and costing more.  All setups will require the regulator itself, co2 proof tubing, check valve, and a diffuser. Other things you may want are a bubble counter, drop checker and a solenoid if you want to hook it up to a timer. Aquatek regulators come with solenoids built in as well as they are shipped with a bubble counter with integrated check valve.  I use the Aquatek mini on a 10gal at about 2.5 - 3 bps. My 24oz tanks last around 3 months maybe more never payed to much attention as I just swap the tanks if the gauge says its low. My bubble counter with check valve and my diffuser are both atomic products which cost a bit more. Overall my setup which does not have a drop checker was around $200.  Not sure how much detail you want me to get into so you you need anything I answer to my best knowledge. I only have one tank setup with co2 so I may not be the best source for which products are best."

PlantedTank,38trh9,UnifiedAwakening,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:15:31 2015 UTC,"Check out the aquatek premium on Amazon for the price. Also I needed an adapter for the 20oz paintball canister which is blue and on Amazon. To refill the canisters where I'm from is about 7 dollars. I say they last about a month if I remember correctly. I recently bought a 24oz as a backup so I could just hook it up when the other is low without having to run down and fill it that day.   I spend to much on my tanks but I never meant to go high tech to begin with. I bought pretty much top of the line stuff in their categories except the regulator because Green Leaf Aquariums is always sold out. I know I can find them elsewhere or build one by purchasing select parts but I figured I would just do that down the road as that regulator works fine for now. I mention that because I didn't mean to go high tech but bought too powerful of a light. So I needed CO2 ASAP since my plants were also on the way. My spending will be different than yours.   My monthly tank budget: CO2 refills $7 RO water from Culligan almost no-weekly is around 20  Everything else that costs money was purchased a while ago. This includes ferts, lights, drop checker, diffuser, CO2 tubing, filters, heaters, substrate, power head, etc. I ballpark an estimate that I have spent around 2000 or so. A decent chunk of that is from shrimp shipments that all perished until I figured out the problem. I'm now officially at the point where I'm not buying anything else other than things needed to keep the tanks going. So the CO2, RO water, Seachem Prime, and test kits as they run out. I can no longer afford to buy fish online. Also I have to many damn plants that a rescape is in order but I'm scared shitless of killing my shrimp in the process. My tank is more like a jungle than a scape. It's chaos. Until my shrimp breed enough for a good colony I'm not moving anything."

PlantedTank,38oqzt,czac90,3,Fri Jun 5 16:30:04 2015 UTC,Got around to cleaning out my old 10 gallon. Had one African cichlid that needed a new home. Had some really crappy pet store decorations and bright blue gravel. So happy with the new change. Planning to add some Java moss to the driftwood to make it look like a tree. I was thinking I might do that after the HC establishes a strong carpet and I'm ready to flood.   Always open to comments/suggestions!

PlantedTank,38r0kw,mdneilson,2,Sat Jun 6 02:03:50 2015 UTC,"Yep. You want top soil, not potting mix. The idea is to get really un-rich soil.  No fertilizers. No peat. Just plain ol, crappy fill dirt."

I'm offering a collection at a great discount, I paid a lot more for the plants I'm offering and attaching a price to recuperate some of those costs. The thread rules even say to cross-promote between here and /r/aquaswap. To be honest, I don't see how this thread can grow beyond common plants/fish if you don't allow hobbyists to put up uncommon things with a discounted price. That's my two cents."

This thread was a result of the sub being flooded with trade posts or people wanting to get rid of things, and wanting to keep it all in one place.  Cross-posting items being given away is encouraged.  Items being given away means that you're basically just asking for the cost of packaging/shipping.  Items being sold is any money requested beyond that.  /r/PlantedTank is meant to be a platform for discussion of the hobby, not to be any kind of trading post.  It's a big can of worms to allow that kind of thing, and the sub would be taken over by it entirely.  We like to keep the focus on the hobby instead of acquiring plants/fish or making any sort of profit.  Of course, if enough people are interested in selling items in the weekly thread, that can be discussed and voted upon.  However, this has been decided against by the community at large on three separate occasions before now.  The other mods and I generally run a democratic ship here (which we feel is only fair).  If you'd like to open a discussion on changing the RAOK thread, we are more than willing to listen and discuss your points with you, and then present it to the whole of the community.

We like to keep the focus on the hobby instead of acquiring plants/fish or making any sort of profit.   You're implying that the hobby is distinct from acquiring plants/fish? That's a strange point to make.  And if it looks like I'm trying to turn a profit - I'm not as I've spent quite a bit building my collection. I've got a ton of extra plants and need them gone. I'm offering the package cheaper here than anywhere else I've posted it because I think the community here could benefit from something new being offered.

PlantedTank,38jvmr,perhapsso,3,Thu Jun 4 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"Petco. The tank was roughly 45. It's made of plastic, which I don't mind.  I have to say though, I can't figure out what I want to be doing with this tank. A planted tank for sure, with a 10# tank (my old tank), but IDK how I want to have this set up.  I have DHG on the way, along with some other nice plants. However, the point being that I have limited space, away from my wife and child (hooray!) and most importantly, this will be just so that I can think of things."
PlantedTank,38jvmr,perhapsso,4,Thu Jun 4 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"Damn, I just left petco. Does the tank have a name? You don't by chance have the dimensions handy do you?  I think a tiny Iwagumi setup with a betta would be fun with the tank shape.  Do you know if that Fluval will be strong enough for DHG?"
PlantedTank,38jvmr,perhapsso,3,Thu Jun 4 20:26:58 2015 UTC,"It's called the ""Bookshelf Aquarium. For freshwater Fish."" It's the Petco brand. I do not have the dimensions, but if I were to guesstimate, it would be in the following range:  23x7x9  I would go no more than 10 gallon filter, as it may cause some overflow issues, and throwing your substrate all over the place.  I'm sick of Betta's really. May throw in some danios, RCS, or some nano tetra. Something small, but nice to look at."

PlantedTank,38jvmr,SiPhuYoda,3,Thu Jun 4 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"Sand creates pockets of air, where most of your nitrites and nitrates can build up. When the air gets release, talk about a HELL of a spike. Take it from me, I had a 55g with a lot of sand, and next thing you know, fish are all dead in a week. Checked the water, and it was off the charts.  But this tank has a LITTLE bit of a bow to it, i'm talking about an inch or so. Nothing too serious."

PlantedTank,38ltqq,rat_queen_,5,Fri Jun 5 01:31:33 2015 UTC,"You cannot realistically estimate an LEDs output (for plants anyway) based on wattage. You can do OK using it for CFLs though, but it's a rough estimate. You should do some research on lumens, par, and spectrum."
PlantedTank,38ltqq,phyzzix,3,Fri Jun 5 02:28:33 2015 UTC,"I had a question a couple days ago about light requirements, and the helpful people here pointed me towards PAR values as a measurement of how much light will be needed for my tank. The deeper your tank, the more intense your light will need to be to sustain photosynthesis along the bottom. Different plants have different PAR values associated with them, so you can plant accordingly.  The guys over at the Planted Tank forums have a good post on it. There are also a couple threads discussing different lights and their PAR values."
PlantedTank,38ltqq,BukkitBoss,2,Fri Jun 5 13:44:59 2015 UTC,"You again :)   You have to search for lumen. Every good LED lamp should have information about how much lumen it has.   Then it depends on what you want to keep in your tank. You can start with 15 to 20 lumen for a normal tank with a very few plants but you will need 50+ lumen for a nice aquascape. Like I said, depends on what you want to do with your tank :-)"
PlantedTank,38ltqq,Phillsen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:02:48 2015 UTC,"Hahah hello there! Yep, I'm hopeless. Everything I was saying was telling me that wattage was the most important thing to look for so that's what I was doing...  So I'm really just trying to do a low-medium light setup for a 5 gal hex tank with a few java fern/anubias/crypts. I bought both a free-standing desk light and a clip-on desk light (gonna return whichever one I don't use), I'm just trying to figure out what type of bulb to put in it. At this point I think I'm gonna forgo the LEDs in favor of a CFL so my plants can get some light ASAP, then once I have the time/money to really research and put something together I can invest in LEDs.   My other question, in addition to what bulb to get, is how high above the tank should I put the light? I'm guessing that depends on what bulb I get, though..."
PlantedTank,38ltqq,Phillsen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:47:46 2015 UTC,"That sounds good for the beginning.   If you want to use a cfl you should look for an equivalent of around 30W to 40W I guess. I've just took a look on the homedepot website (I'm not from the US but I know there are a lot of homedepots in America :D) and they have a lot of these bulbs. 9W cfl bulbs which have ~400 lumen so you'll have about 20lm/liter.   You might check what light-color you want (measured in kelvin, the higher the number the colder the light. I, personally, like the cold light, around 6000kelvin).   Once again, sorry if it's not completely clear what I want to say, English isn't my native language so I don't know the words of everything :)   Edit: oh and about how high the lamp should be above your tank, yes that depends on the bulb and the lamp. It shouldn't be too close so you can comfortably work in your tank and it doesn't heat up the tank too much, but you want as much light as possible to get inside the tank, so you just have to try. There's not much you can do wrong"

Gonna give it a few weeks and see how the plants do before I really celebrate, though :) Now my only concern: Is the clip-on light strong enough to break the rim of the tank?/How else can I mount the light? That might require some creative construction work on my part.  And your English is FANTASTIC!

PlantedTank,38ltqq,Phillsen,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:53:54 2015 UTC,"Hm, about your concern that the lamp might break the glass, I don't think that would happen. How thick is the glass?   There are many clip on lamps for aquariums and I haven't heard of one breaking the glass. But of course, that's no guarantee. Maybe you can support it in some way. :)  Aw and thanks a lot :) it's always very nice to hear this.  Sometimes I'm very uncertain about the things I write and I always think ""if anyone reads this, they will surely think you are retarded"" :D   And if you think English is illogical, try German.

PlantedTank,38h90d,TrustmeIknowaguy,3,Thu Jun 4 14:05:08 2015 UTC,Real bamboo is much larger.
PlantedTank,38h90d,svenniola,4,Thu Jun 4 17:04:57 2015 UTC,Taller at least.

PlantedTank,38h90d,TrustmeIknowaguy,3,Thu Jun 4 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"Ornamental bamboo is thinner yes.   Actual bamboo can be quite thick. Bamboos are some of the fastest-growing plants in the world,[2] due to a unique rhizome-dependent system. Certain species of bamboo can grow 35 inches within a 24-hour period, at a rate of 3 cm/h (a growth of approximately 1 millimeter (or 0.02 inches) every 2 minutes).[3] Bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia, being used for building materials, as a food source, and as a versatile raw product. Bamboo has a higher compressive strength than wood, brick or concrete and a tensile strength that rivals steel.[4][5]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo#/media/File:BambooKyoto.jpg"

I would call this a low-light fixture. Medium would be about 45-50 @ 18"" and high would be 70+ PAR. But to be fair, your previous setup also I would say is low light as well. For florescents you would normally want around at 2w/gallon."
PlantedTank,38hkjl,krattalak,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:19:55 2015 UTC,"So if I understand correctly, since this light is only rated PAR 21 @ 24"", I would need to double the lights double the intensity of the light to get the needed amount of light for Medium light plants.  Edit: I might be able to swap out the one I purchased for another model, the ""Current Freshwater LED+ Pro"". The spec sheet lists the PAR at 12"" as ""100+"", and list the brightness at 2000 lumens. The specs sheet lists the other light at 35+ PAR at 12 inches, and 1000 lumens. Any idea if the ""100+"" of the more powerful model would see me to about 40-50 PAR at 24"" needed for Medium light plants?"
PlantedTank,38hkjl,krattalak,2,Thu Jun 4 16:26:36 2015 UTC,It seems reasonable to think that the Pro will give you a lot more light. It would be nice if Current gave out a range for that instead.
PlantedTank,38hkjl,krattalak,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"Adding another light does not, unfortunately increase PAR values, only switching to a higher intensity light will do that. What adding another light >will< do, is spread out the PAR reaching the bottom over a wider area. LED lights only put their rated PAR values directly under the lamp. So for your light, the only place that would actually get 21 (@24"") would be directly under the lamp. As you move away from the lamp to either side, PAR values drop off, so for your lamp, you might only get 18PAR at 6"" off the center of the lamp. Adding another light increases the area that gets the full PAR. This image from Finnex will help show that.   http://aquafisher.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2im9rpy.jpg  As you might guess, the coverage area under a LED will dramatically affect what sort of plants you can keep where. For this reason I also run two LED fixtures"
PlantedTank,38hkjl,Soidfuf,2,Thu Jun 4 17:15:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Adding a second light will indeed increase PAR just not as simply as doubling it by adding two of the same light. If that were true then multiple bulb t5-t8 fixtures would have no purpose and we all know that's not true. I'll use the Finnex link [here] (http://aquafisher.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2im9rpy.jpg that you used as it shows PAR horizontally unlike the Current light.   If the PAR of this light is 27 at 18"" and you were to place another light 6 inches apart from it you would get the cumulative effect of the PAR value 6 inches away combined with the vertical value from the other light. So 27 + 24 = 51 PAR. So the closer the lights are placed together the greatest maximum PAR you can reach but only in the center few inches.   However, a more intense light will, my guess, provide more PAR per dollar and look nicer while doing it."

It will hide your cords and hardware and can calm your fish. You definitely want to stick with ""low"" care plants, crypts, swords, java moss, java fern, and anubias are great.

PlantedTank,38fj25,ErrantWhimsy,3,Thu Jun 4 18:03:24 2015 UTC,Another vote on the Fugeray Planted +. Just got mine about a week ago for my Spec V. I bought the 16 but the 18 will work great too! I actually recommend getting the 18 because if you use it without the top on the legs just barely make it across cause a very small dip so if your working on it and bump it wrong or something it may go in the water.

PlantedTank,38fj25,Oobatuba,3,Thu Jun 4 02:36:11 2015 UTC,Finnex Planted+ 16in model currently $62.58 on Amazon. Had it since March. The 16in is perfect size since the lights won't be over the filtration area. Here's mine... http://imgur.com/XPDs5KY
PlantedTank,38fj25,Brock_Nation,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:03:31 2015 UTC,"Are you sure that's 16""? It looks a little small. Let me measure my tank, hang on...  ...Ooh, wait, from one end of the tank to the other it's 20"", not 18"". It's 18"" to the plastic wall by the filter. Whoops! I'm tempted to grab the 20"" model in that case. Filter bacteria don't mind light, do they?  The additional blue lights are also a nice touch. I want to make a solar panel-activated switch, where when the output voltage (6V nominal) or current (167mA max) is above X, the light on. When it is below X but above Y, the moonlights turn on. And when it is below Y, it shuts off for the night."
PlantedTank,38fj25,Oobatuba,3,Thu Jun 4 18:12:47 2015 UTC,Yeah it's 16in model. I don't think having lights in the filter area would hurt your bacteria but you will definitely see an increase in algae in the filter area by going with the 20in model.  Btw that solar powered light switch sounds nifty. I don't know how much more you'd spend in making this upgrade but you should look  into the Planted+ 24/7. The 20in model is $74.50 on Amazon
PlantedTank,38fj25,Brock_Nation,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:55:54 2015 UTC,Is that the fluval CO2 system? How do you like it? Just picked one up the other day and haven't run it! Any complains or tips about its usage?
PlantedTank,38fj25,Oobatuba,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:56:09 2015 UTC,I like it  but had to upgrade the stock big bulky diffuser to a ceramic diffuser and I added a bubble counter. It's basically the same set up as the 88g fluval co2 but the cartridge is 16g.
PlantedTank,38fj25,Brock_Nation,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:53:11 2015 UTC,"Oh I have the larger model which I believe comes with a bubble counter.. I may upgrade the diffuser too though, have you had issues with water pushing back up the tubing? I've heard this can happen. Also how many bps are you running and for how many hours a day, sorry you're the first person I've seen running this system on the spec 😂"
PlantedTank,38fj25,Oobatuba,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:47:11 2015 UTC,"No worries! Concerning the water coming back up...it will happen. To stop that from happening install a check valve between the co2 unit and bubble counter.  I run the co2 at 2 drops/second 30 minutes prior to the lights and it stays on for a total of 2 hours.  The lights stay on for 4 hours. I find that there's no need to keep the co2 on the whole time because the drop checker starts turning yellow indicating high co2. But by turning it off halfway through the photo period, the drop checker stays a constant green.  Do you have a pic of your aquarium? Would like to see your set up!"
PlantedTank,38fj25,Brock_Nation,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:51:52 2015 UTC,That's awesome that you only have to run it for such a short time each day! My tank hasn't been setup yet though... I've run many tanks before but this will be my first planted tank. Setup will be a fluval spec V in an iwagumi style with an HC carpet and some micro sword. Lighting will be a planted + 24/7 and I'll run the fluval CO2 system at around the same rate as you! I'll be making a big post when I put it together.
PlantedTank,38fj25,jelloBadger,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:52:57 2015 UTC,Wow. That sounds like it's going to look amazing.

PlantedTank,38e091,Hi_im_ian,2,Wed Jun 3 17:26:35 2015 UTC,I looked up some dry ferts and noticed Greenleafaquarium's PPS Pro as the go-to  for a lot of people. Is that product any good as a replacement for all the all the Seachem Products? I'm still getting Excel.

PlantedTank,38e091,dstommie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:14:12 2015 UTC,You can buy powdered form of the pure nutrients if you look for them and then mix your own liquid or dose the powder directly.  The dose of the pure chemical is so small a one pound bag will last for years.
PlantedTank,38e091,Clay_Statue,7,Wed Jun 3 17:58:54 2015 UTC,"Seachem Prime for water changes and ammonia spike disasters.  Seachem Excel for times when you are low on CO2.

PlantedTank,38e091,cosalich,10,Wed Jun 3 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"None of them. Seachem stuff is horribly overpriced.  Find dry ferts for N,P,K and a trace. That's cheaper and better because you can mix it yourself and get your desired results without fear of algae."

PlantedTank,38e091,AbideMan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:04:42 2015 UTC,Stability worked well for me when I was getting a new tank cycling.   Cichlid trace did well when I had those.  Does anyone have experience with ParaGuard? It seems to be well reviewed.
PlantedTank,38e091,cosalich,2,Wed Jun 3 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"I have confirmed that stability is functionally snake oil. It does not increase cycling speed. This was tested on identical 2.5 gallon tanks with the same substrate and filtration, both using fishless cycling.  All stability or like products do is potentially increase the number of bacteria involved in converting nitrites to nitrates... Which doesn't even start taking place until the end of the cycle."
PlantedTank,38e091,AbideMan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:11:10 2015 UTC,"Huh, well it's good to learn something new. I suppose I did so well cycling my tank, it seemed like the Stability helped. Go me.   I will attest that the Cichlid trace made my Geos noticably brighter though"
PlantedTank,38e091,cosalich,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:31:22 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of ""stability helped so much, my tank cycled in less than a month!"" The reality is in perfect conditions, a tank can naturally cycle in just under four weeks. Even less than that if seeded by an established tank. Hell a single piece of gravel from an established tank can shave a week off an average 6 week cycle.  Cycling on average takes six weeks, but can be as short as 4 or as long as 8 without any additional products in any result."
PlantedTank,38e091,AbideMan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:35:27 2015 UTC,That must be it. I used rocks from the established tank. Didn't realize it would cycle in only 3 weeks though.
PlantedTank,38e091,antiagonist,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:12:40 2015 UTC,"Most recently I cycled a 7.5 gallon nano tank in a week using Stability. Without a comparison tank, it's impossible to say that I needed Stability, but that's a pretty quick turnaround if you ask me.  Another claim made by the product is that livestock can be added immediately if the product is used daily for seven days. I used a ghost shrimp as a guinea pig, and it survived, but, again, this is just my anecdote. A much larger sample size is needed to know for sure if the product's usefulness is legitimate."
PlantedTank,38e091,cosalich,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:37:05 2015 UTC,"You can add livestock on day one without stability if you want, it's called a fish-in cycle and has nothing to do with the product.  Because I have done a controlled test I honestly don't care much for anecdotes. Without keeping everything constant between two tanks with the exception of stability, I pretty well just don't believe anyone because it's far more likely testing was done wrong, they didn't have a good grasp on what a cycle is, they seeded a filter or substrate, they didn't finish the cycle but thought they had, were doing a fish-in cycle, used live substrate... the list goes on.  If you feel like it works, more power to you. It's your money after all, but in my mind you're spending that money on a placebo."

""Fish and other aquatic species may be introduced at any time as long as dosage is maintained for 7 days."" Why would they state this if it was irrelevant to the well-being of the fish or the purposes of the product?   Because I have done a controlled test I honestly don't care much for anecdotes. Without keeping everything constant between two tanks with the exception of stability, I pretty well just don't believe anyone because it's far more likely testing was done wrong, they didn't have a good grasp on what a cycle is, they seeded a filter or substrate, they didn't finish the cycle but thought they had, were doing a fish-in cycle, used live substrate... the list goes on.   Why do you get to be the only person who isn't an idiot?  It's fine if you don't believe me or anyone else. Even I am skeptical about the usefulness of the product. What I don't agree with is proclaiming one's personal experience as conclusive fact to other people.  Saying ""I have confirmed that stability is functionally snake oil. It does not increase cycling speed"" based on a single experiment with one pair of tanks with a small volume of water would be like me getting heads on two consecutive coin tosses and telling everyone that all coin tosses land on heads."

PlantedTank,38e091,Stomiid,2,Wed Jun 3 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"Dwarf Baby Tears. I decided to order the PPS-Pro from GLA, Ecxel and Prime. I have CO2 so hopefully I can get a nice carpet."
PlantedTank,38e091,A_Goon,2,Wed Jun 3 18:10:59 2015 UTC,"Seachem Flourish is a complete fertiliser, i.e. it contains all macro and micro nutrients necessary for plant growth. It is expensive, but is fine if you can't be arsed with dry salts.  Any brand fertiliser will do. Seachem Prime is a good conditioner though.  There is no point adding in ""Flourish Trace"" or ""Potassium"" because all the constituents are contained in Flourish, with all elements in roughly the right proportions for our plants - there isn't any use in increasing their levels disproportionately above the others since they won't be limiting plant growth."
PlantedTank,38e091,nekt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:02:53 2015 UTC,"Not exactly true in a lot of cases, I don't think. I dosed only Flourish for a while and I noticed many of my plants were showing signs of specific nutrient deficiencies like pin holes in my wisteria, green spot algae, and slow growth etc etc. I guess one of that depends on the levels of those related nutrients are in your water straight out the tap but still. And I'm pretty sure just adding more Flourish wouldn't help (without the help from co2 at least) because I was already running into algae.   Now I'm dosing flourish, seachem phosphorus, Excel, using osmocote tabs and diy co2 but I'm almost positive I'm inevitably going to have to dose iron and potassium as well as possibly trace elements, but when that time comes I'll definitely be going the dry fert route. I constantly see how dirt cheap (not to mention dry ferts lasting YEARS) it is, also it'll be cool to learn how to make my own mixes and stuff imo."
PlantedTank,38e091,antiagonist,2,Wed Jun 3 19:05:52 2015 UTC,"Most of what you saw sounds like co2 deficiency.  Do you need to use both Excel and co2?  I stopped using excel 100% (even in planted tanks with no co2) and have been fine for a few months.  That stuff is highly toxic.  It leads to inconsistent co2 levels, it melts some plants, and it just might poison you.  Not the wonder solution we make it out to be here."
PlantedTank,38e091,A_Goon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:42:48 2015 UTC,"That Wikipedia article doesn't say anything about glutaraldehyde being an endocrine disruptor.  The thing about toxicity is that it's dose-dependent relative to what it is being dosed. Water is technically toxic to humans at a high enough dosage. Glutaraldehyde might be highly toxic in its purest form, but in Excel and Metricide 14, it's diluted to 1.5% and 2.6% solutions, respectively. So yes, I probably don't want to drink a bottle of the stuff, or dump the entire bottle into my tank. But my question is if the recommended dosage has any non-negligible, negative effects on plants or livestock."
PlantedTank,38e091,nekt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"2/3rds of what I listed aren't related to co2 deficiencies at all. Pin holes in plants and GSA doesn't involve co2, as far as what I know and I was getting those while only dosing Flourish. Regardless, my point is Flourish in particular is sometimes not enough for all plants. Imo it's more of a basic fertilizer with small parts of a lot of what you need, almost like an appetizer but not the full meal. Just from my experience anyway. And Excel is just Excel. Follow the guidelines and it's not poisonous whatsoever. Overdosing any substance will most likely cause negative effects. But I have seen talk melting some species of plants."
PlantedTank,38e091,CalvinFromVietnam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:42:00 2015 UTC,Glutaraldehyde is a endocrine disruptor and poisonous at very small concentrations.  It is not comparable to anything else in ones aquarium cabinet.

For a check valve, I have always used regular ""CO2 Safe"" check valves for aquariums. Something like this http://www.amazon.com/Brass-Check-Valve-Aquarium-Regulator/dp/B005C76W4Y   or   http://www.amazon.com/Plastic-Non-Return-Check-Aquarium-System/dp/B00JY3R1XS/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1433354563&sr=1-1&keywords=aquarium+check+valve+co2  Both of those check valves are inline and are easily replaceable.

I would also suggest you get a bubble counter or drop checker as well (Edit: or both). A bubble counter gives you a rate at which CO2 is entering your tank in bubbles per second and a drop checker uses some fancy chemistry to help determine the actual amount of CO2 dissolved in the water column.    Also, be sure to purchase tubing that is designed to be used for CO2. Plain vinyl tubing will degrade with exposure to that high of a concentration of CO2."

PlantedTank,38c472,thedarkrager,7,Wed Jun 3 06:59:19 2015 UTC,"This is the basic EI dosing regiment created by Tom Barr. If you want more detail and science, check out Barr Report. The stickies are a long read, but they're fairly useful. The fertilizers below are all required, get them all in one go. Also get a measuring spoon and a test kit. Once you understand your own needs and what-nots, you can easily customize the dosing to your liking, the guideline is the basic and general dosing. Sorry, I have no experience with the site you posted. Cut and pasted from Nilocg Aquatics:  If you are dosing with Gh booster use this schedule  If you are not using GH booster use this schedule  For the above amounts you want to dose the macros(kno3, kh2po4, and k2so4) and the micros(CSM+B or Millers) all 3x per week on alternating days.  An example of this would be the micros on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  The macros on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  Then a 50% water change on Sunday followed by adding the Gh booster.  This 3x per week dosing is suggested for high light tanks with co2.  If you have medium light tank try starting out dosing 2x per week, low light tanks can be dosed 1x per week.  If in the example of the medium light tank you dose 2x per week and you start seeing deficiencies then up the dosing to 3x per week.   The EI method is based on the thought that excess nutrients will not harm anything in the tank.  So even if you had a low light tank and were to dose 3x per week at the full amounts, as long as you kept up with the 50% weekly water changes it would not cause any problems."

Black worms can be used in tanks to help aerate the soil. Trumpet snails should also work, but I haven't tried with them. The risk you run with black worms has to do with fish selection. Certain bottom feeders will dig through the soil to eat these guys. Important not to use red worms which turn into flies. Only use black worms which are fully aquatic."

PlantedTank,388r28,hebrewwarrior69,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:51:23 2015 UTC,"I've been using dirt for a number of tanks for about 3 years now, both with walstad and filling it right away.  A few notes of caution:  If you don't like how the layout is, you can't change it.  Attempting to do so turns your tank into a mud pit.  So you need to make sure you get the setup right the first time.  Additionally, once plants go in, you can't pull them out without turning your tank into a mud pit.  You can't go adding extra dirt later, or really make any changes whatsoever without turning your tank into a mud pit.  Modifying the tank means draining it, and re-doing it with all the modifications, fixing the sand cap, then re-filling it.  It needs a sand cap.  Otherwise, you get the afore-mentioned mud pit.  You need to be careful what fish you have.  Pleco's like to dig (and that tank lasted all of about 2 days before I had to re-do it with gravel...).  Loaches also like to dig.  Corydora's do to, but don't dig deeply, it is more rooting around in the sand cap, so they are survivable in a dirt/sand tank.  Basically what I am saying here is - check your fish, they might not be a good match with a planted tank.  As for mixing in clay, I haven't tried it, I just stick with dirt+sand, and it works great.  Anyways, good luck, and enjoy your re-scaped tank."

I've since switched to a plant substrate and prefer it much more. We are creating an artificial environment, without the natural forces of mother nature to keep it clean. I believe that artificial substrate is far superior to create a clean, healthy environment for your fish.  That being said, I have a 2 gallon Walstad jar that is doing just fine, but it is fully carpeted and has no filter."

PlantedTank,38911q,rat_queen_,5,Tue Jun 2 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"As far as I can see it says clearly nothing about how bright it is. 5500 to 6000 kelvin means the light ""looks"" cold. You can find pictures about the temperature of the light (measured in kelvin).   The power supply gives 1a and 12v which means it has 12w, but that doesn't say anything about the brightness of the leds.  IMHO you should look for something else, I wouldn't trust it unless there is way more information.  Of course, for 10 bucks you could just give it a try. But na, I wouldn't. Get a decent one, there are many many threads around here and /r/aquariums where people ask about some led lights. I'm sure someone else will be able to give you some names/brands of other lights.   Edit: the reviews ain't that bad. Some people are having problems after the first hours of use, which I can confirm about cheap Chinese no name products. But most people are happy with it... I'm just living like ""buy cheap, buy twice"" (it's a saying in my country, idk if you have something similar in america :D)   Edit2: according to the plants you want to keep it might be enough, though these plants don't need to much light  I hope you understand me, my English isn't that good.."

It's a little off on the spectrum that plants will best utilize light, but if you were to submerge the light right near the plants it would probably do the trick.  However, a lot of people have had success with grow lights or daytime spectrum bulbs I think their called that they put in a desk lamp over their tanks.    I would suggest going that route, I personally would not place any kind of cheap chinese light in my tank.  I'm sure it's a great product from what the reviews say, but you do get what you pay for.    We do have a similar saying, /u/Phillsen, but I think I've heard it more of ""pay for it once"".

That's really cool, I have a friend who went to Germany for a year and in the span of a year he was fluent in the language and I think he was mostly literate too.  I hadn't thought much about literacy until recently when I did some travel abroad and realized how lost I could get since I didn't know the language or how to read most of the signs there.  Granted, there were signs in English, but I've really come to appreciate literacy lately.    In a way it's good that you're uncertain about some of the stuff that you write, that means you care about the words that you put forth into the world!  I think that that is important and something a lot of internet users should ponder sometimes.    For what it's worth, I attribute a lot of my English skills to all the reading that I did as a kid.  Sometimes you read so much that you get a good eye for what looks and sounds right you know?  So I would suggest that you keep practicing and keep reading!

That's something I definitely have to do before I settle down somewhere.. It helps so much. It's awesome how fast you learn a language by just being forced to speak it.   Basically my English comes from games, movies and TV series. Sure, I learned the basics in school but most of my knowledge is from hearing and reading. I began watching movies and TV series in English when I was 14 (my English was terrible by then :D) and it helped me a lot.   Get an eye for what looks and sounds right.

There is no real way to tell from the box how powerful it is.   I suggest the following:   Don't cheap out. If you want an inexpensive light fixture, you are better off going T5. It will cost more in energy, but you know what you're getting. If you buy a cheap LED, you will replace in soon anyway.  Look for PAR charts - if you can't find them, assume the worst. PAR is the measure of light at various distances from the fixture - some lights have fantastic penetration, while others of equal power spread the light over a larger area but go less deep.  You're looking at relatively low-light plants, for the most part. If you want to go cheap, try a clip light with an LED bulb from a hardware store - PAR values for those are available."

A basic setup involves a regulator featuring an electric solenoid switch on a common 24 hour light timer, and the user fiddling with knobs to get it dialed in.  The next step up adds a ph probe like the Milwaukee one to shut off the solenoid when the ph drops below a point at which the co2 approaches dangerous concentrations.

PlantedTank,387sf9,jaminator21,7,Tue Jun 2 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"CO2 doesn't affect KH! I think what you mean to be testing is pH. As a rough guess, 1 or 2 bubbles (quite a lot to account for the high surface agitation) will probably give you plenty to grow anything you'd like to. Every tank is different though.  Only very strong acids reduce KH. CO2 is a very weak acid.  A much more reliable measure of CO2 is a drop checker, I'd highly recommend you get one. Drop checkers contain an indicator which signals the pH, which depends both on the KH of the water in there (most solutions use 4 degrees KH water) and the amount of CO2.  In your tank, you have other buffers, as well as carbonates (measured by KH), such as phosphates, meaning that measuring pH and KH alone (without much idea on the levels of other buffers) cannot be used to accurately measure the CO2 concentration."
PlantedTank,387sf9,Stomiid,2,Tue Jun 2 14:35:52 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that if you have your KH and pH then you can use This chart to find your CO2 in PPM.

PlantedTank,387sf9,Soidfuf,2,Tue Jun 2 22:09:26 2015 UTC,"You can use this chart still, its not nearly as easy or accurate as a drop checker, but you measure your KH and then measure your pH. As you add more CO2 your pH drops and your CO2 levels will go from blue to green to red depending on where you are on the chart."
PlantedTank,387sf9,Dream_Lord,0,Wed Jun 3 17:01:04 2015 UTC,"I hope I can add a little more detail to clear up some confusion... CO2 injection DOES increase KH, as CO2 reacts with the water to make carbonate and/or bicarbonate, however this is only at a small fraction of what is measured in each degree of KH.  Thus you can somewhat safely say KH shouldn't noticeably change from CO2 injection.  A drop checker works by showing you the PH of a solution that should only be effected by CO2.  The air pocket above the solution allows CO2 in the tank water to escape and re-dissolve into the solution without allowing other potential PH buffers or KH affecting things that may be present in your water.  This makes it more effective than measuring PH and KH independently comparing to the chart.  I would generally believe that unless you have some other significant problem with your water, non-carbonate PH buffers should be pretty minimal, making the table generally good enough."

PlantedTank,3881bv,Warrenparton,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:55:59 2015 UTC,"Why you cant just use tank water:  A drop checker is really just a pH indicator.  Water injected with CO2 becomes more acidic as CO2 is dissolved into it creating carbonic acid.  Highly buffered (hard) water is obviously more resistant to changes in pH, so if you use very hard water in your indicator you will not get the typical co2 readings from your drop checker ie. blue-low, green-good, yellow-high.  With very hard water in your drop checker you could easily inject too much CO2 while your drop checker will till you you are good.  I make my own 4dkh solution by mixing RO with tap water with good results.  I use the bromo blue from my api test kit as the pH indicator solution.  All of that aside, remember to watch the fish!  Drop checkers lag hours behind actual tank conditions."
PlantedTank,3881bv,spacebeez,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:26:57 2015 UTC,So you're saying I could use Tank water but it would just be inaccurate? In that case I would actually need a Solution instead of tank water

The instructions mentioned to use tank water, but I wanted it to work for a long time without needing changing so I initially used distilled.  It turns out, with the indicator solution, this didn't work. I'm not sure what the issue us but the water immediately went green, before I even put the indicator in the tank. I know that my tank water doesn't have enough CO2 to make the indicator green as I used it before I injected CO2.  It would seem that you need some carbonate in the stop checker to show the level properly. Tank water provides this and that's probably why it mentions it in the instructions I had."

This isn't my recipe, I found it on one of the forums, if I find the link I'll post it here  You'll need at least 1 gallon of distilled water  1. Put 6 cups of distilled water into a container 2. Add 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda(sodium bicarbonate) and mix it in 3. Pour out 3 cups of this mix 4. Add in 3 fresh cups of distilled water 5. Pour out 3 cups of this 6. Add in another 3 cups of distilled water 7. Pour out 1 cup 8. Add in 1 cup distilled water 9. Your water is now 4dKH      a) If you need 2dKH solution mix 1 cup of 4dKH with 1 cup distilled water      b) If you need 1dKH solution mix 1 cup of 2dKH with 1 cup distilled water   Overall this is a cheap method of making loads of 4dKH.

PlantedTank,384fo1,jsb0805,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"Question 1: you say you want a ""crypt carpet"" -- I think crypt parva is the only crypt that would stay low enough to be a good foreground crypt in a small tank like yours. However, it grows slowly so you need to plant it out full from the start. Since your tank is small, that is easier to do. Here is what 6 pots of crypt parva looked like freshly planted across the front of my 9gal tank: http://imgur.com/a/mpvNa I once had crypt wendtii growing in a tank with quite high light (a 2.5 gal tank with I think a 13W CFL over it). It stayed quite low in those high light conditions. I don't know if I just got lucky with that tank or what. Marsilea minuta is supposed to be a good foreground carpet plant for low tech tanks but it seems hard to find.  Re question 2: I'd suggest you search around online for planted nano tanks and get an idea of what people are using. In smaller tanks typically a ""mid-ground"" plant will become a background plant -- and things used as a ""foreground"" plant (for example, dwarf sagittaria) in big tanks need to become mid-ground in a small tank.  Question 3: Personally I like the look you have. Just 2 suggestions: 1 is what is your focal point? Where does your eye go to when you look at the tank? Consider the rule of thirds in photography and try to make the eye naturally ""flow"" to something as the focal point. Another thing I've heard that is a ""rules of rocks"" is to support big rocks with smaller rocks. In other words, big rocks look more natural with smaller size rocks clustered at their base. But ultimately if you like it, stick with it, it's not bad :)  Question 4: I've seen people stack way more substrate in the back, I think it's fine. In fact in example #1 you gave look at the left hand side of the tank in between the rocks and notice how high that person stacked up their substrate. You may find yourself needing more substrate in the front if you buy mature plants with bigger root systems (e.g. potted plants like crypt parva). A small carpeting plant like the marsilea wouldn't need much."

I had to use completely different rocks because the ones I was using actually reacted with acetic acid. It's unfortunate too because they are amazing rocks with great fine detail. They must be limestone.   I was lucky enough to collect another type of rock that didn't react to vinegar at all. These are what I used to create a more off centered mountainscape.

PlantedTank,384fo1,lordpine,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"I think that setup in your second reply would go better, much more character, tho i see what your doing with that initial pic more of a classic foreground / background going on.   In reply to what one guy said i have grown multiple types of Marsilea and believe me the quickest and easiest ( and in my opinion best looking ) is Marsilea hirsuta, ( see my 4ft hirsuta here http://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q268/pineos/WP_20141228_17_33_01_Panorama.jpg )  http://www.aquaessentials.co.uk has an exelent range of plants including that. I live in australia and shipping from the uk takes a week and plants always arrive in good condition.   Q 1: google is your best source. as posted by that other guy crypt parva is the best and really only crypt that can be considered a true carpet crypt. i spent some where around 300$ incl postage on enough  parva to plant out a 4ft foreground. (see here, just planted that tank in this pic so hasnt had time to grow out, will take months.. http://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q268/pineos/WP_20150530_17_22_01_Pro__highres.jpg ) it grows slow and only needs low light, but imo that and marsilea are your best no maintenance options.  Q 2: foreground, as above. mid, given that you are going to be using a lot of rocks types of anubias  would be an easy / no maintenance option. crypt nevellii is awesome too but im bias as its one of my fav plants. background? really depends how tall you want it but i wouldnt go any plants that reach the surface with your setup if i was you, would dwarf the rocks. go for something that reaches about midway up?   Q 3: Your call mate. do your own thing, only use what you see and read as a guide.. its art. you do what you like.   Q 4: i have substrate about 15 cm at the back and 2cm at the front, long as the plants can get their roots in it isnt to shallow. long as you arent using sand you can bank your substrate up pretty deep without worrying to much about dead spots, just dont go digging down the back once its all setup if you can avoid it.  Q 5: if your planting it heavily even your filter would suffice for a tank that small. its problem is its so visible so its pretty ugly. a hang on back filter would do more and be less visible but i recommend any small canister filter tho as they are the best. you also have more choice in the intake / outlets with canisters. you can use the stock ones or get those clear glass ones to put on if you want that look etc.   Q 6: 8.2 isnt TOO high as long as its consistent. ive had planted tropical setups that did fine with a ph of 9 because of limestone. also with your deep substrate once its established this will help buff your ph, might even sit 7 - 8 range naturally. I havnt had to deal with a high Kh so you may want to look this up further if its going to be an issue.  Q 7: i only dose excel for the hell of it. i have a deep dirt substrate with gravel capping so i dont need to much in nutrients for my crypts. it more depends on your plants needs. if you go low requirement plants you may not have to dose much, higher tech needs more ferts.   Q 8: sizzling is probably just the air escaping as the water seeps into the porous rocks. from the look of it all your rocks look pretty inert.   <3"

PlantedTank,384qa2,drecklia,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"For rimless tanks, it prevents stress points on the glass. If you don't use a mat of some sort, you're running the risk of creating undue stress on one of the joints, which may cause leakage. It also evens out any high points that may be present on the surface that the tank sits on.  Rimmed tanks don't have this issue, since they're actually sitting on the plastic, not the glass. (And have the stability of the plastic, as well.)"
PlantedTank,385151,Bearhat54,2,Mon Jun 1 22:18:42 2015 UTC,"Aw man. Okay, how far are you moving?   I just moved a 20G long that was about 4-5 months old without taking anything out but fish. I removed the fish, drained the tank down to the substrate and moved 'er. However, I moved about 15 minutes down the road and I had a pickup truck with a large cab. The best possible situation. I will recommend you break down the tank and I'll explain why.  The biggest issue is weight. A tank is NOT designed to move full of anything. A tank is very light with nothing in it, so there's no stress moving an empty tank. However a tank with even just substrate in it is actually quite heavy and a tank with substrate and water up to some level is very heavy. Somehow it always surprises me how heavy the tank is even though I KNOW water is very heavy.   The issue is not exactly that you cannot lift it, although it will be hard. And the issue is not that the bottom of the tank cannot support the weight, although they're not designed to. I think a 29G with nearly all of the water removed and 2-3 inches of substrate supported equally on all 4 corners is fine for a move.   The issue is twisting. You don't want to twist a bit, or stumble even for a moment, and accidentally end up with all of the weight of the tank in one our of four hands holding the tank. Pop goes a seal, and you have a huge mess and you need a new tank immediately. Or you damage the tank and don't notice until you begin refilling.  My plan was simple....empty the tank, and load it onto a piece of plywood. Then all 4 corners will be supported equally while we (2 people) lift the plywood. However, getting the tank onto the plywood was a sketchy affair and I was scared that one of us would twist a little (and we did by accident, at least twice) and pop a seal or weaken a seal (we didn't do that though, apparently).  As well, loading it into the pickup truck was pretty much terrible. I got it on the floor inside the cab, but now it was a rush. Gotta get it all over there right away. Fish in a bucket and already have been for an hour, some of them that were easier to catch were in there for two hours, filter has been off for about an hour too now, tank smells like asshole kinda, water was sloshing a bit. Jesus christ.  And the tank is still heavy so I'm trying to figure out how to secure it well and minimize sloshing of water. Thank god the new place was really close so we could drive very slowly.   Plus, it took about 1 hour to catch fucking 20 fish. I tore two nets on driftwood during the process. I got pretty mad at my rhomb barbs. Terrible decision. If they had no plants to hide in and no decorations it would have been game over for them. Would have taken half the time and I wouldn't have had to scare them on purpose out of hiding places.  It was a shitty, stressful affair and I didn't even have to move far.   If you had optimal conditions like I did I'd say both options are pretty shitty. However not breaking it down came with a lot more risk of breaking the tank. If you would be putting the tank in the back of a car on the set or something I'd say fuck it, break it down. The tanks will reroot and grow back. It's not a big deal. It's kinda fun anyway.   Minimize the stress on the fish by breaking it down thereby making it MUCH easier to catch them. Minimize the stress on yourself by taking your time and breaking it down and loading up a very lightweight tank with little risk of breakage. Make it a bit more fun by allowing yourself to do a redesign of the tank! Also, it won't smell like fucking swamp water the entire time you're moving."
PlantedTank,385151,CrasyMike,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:21:11 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. That totally makes sense. Yeah my move would be about a 20 minute drive. So a but further. But yeah, when I moved it the first time (no plants, just a quick fish move) it was easier to just strip it down. When I take the plants out, should I just uproot them, place them floating in some tank water, then just root them in a new place? Or the same place. Either one."
PlantedTank,385151,CrasyMike,3,Tue Jun 2 00:33:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unless you have a carpet I'd say breaking it down is a no-brainer decision. It's not a big deal to pop plants out and do it.   I'm no expert on the subject but I'd say yup. Pull the plants out, float them in water, put them back wherever you want after. Try to take a lot of care with the roots! Would be nice if they were mostly intact.   If I did it again by the way I'd float/sink if possible the plants in with the fish! They'd probably like it. Also, I'd probably invest in more containers of water. I'd give the fish 2-3 buckets for extra space. I was not nice to my fish and put them all in one bucket with basically nothing to hide in. I thought it would go a lot quicker. They got stressed :(  Remember the fish will need acclimatized to the ""new tank"". It's your old tank, but the water is probably mostly new water from a new source and the temps will not be the same."
PlantedTank,385151,Juddston,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:39:31 2015 UTC,"Agree with this except for one thing, if you ever do a longer move do not mix plants and fish together in a lidded bucket.  Plants take in oxygen in dark conditions and can potentially suffocate your fish if left in the dark in a small container for long periods of time.   Edit: unless you use some kind of aerator, of course."
PlantedTank,385151,Juddston,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:02:23 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. If the bucket it just a normal bucket without a lit, will that work? or would it just be better in the long run to just separate them?"
PlantedTank,385151,CrasyMike,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:01:04 2015 UTC,"You will want a lid as even small bumps/turns will slosh the water out.  An airstone is just a little porous stone that you hook up to an airpump that will diffuse the air into small bubbles.  You probably won't need one for your trip, filter media needs water and oxygen to survive, but a move as short as yours should be OK.  However they are cheap and will only be beneficial.    Really though, it's a pain to move a tank, but not nearly as bad as you think as long as you take your time, do your research and keep calm haha.  I am actually moving my tank again in a month... another 12+ hr trip :-(    If you go into my submission history, I made a post about this which had some useful advice.

PlantedTank,385151,yaknowthatoneguy,2,Tue Jun 2 01:26:03 2015 UTC,"Someone else wrote something pretty key, make sure you notice it. Don't do what I said about the plants with fish in a bucket :) Unless you got a bubbler. I used a blubbler so I wasn't thinking about oxygen conditions.   http://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/385151/moving_a_planted_tank/crshkdf?context=3  I'd say you should retain as much of the old water as possible. Buckets for water are really cheap and it's easy to keep a lot of the old water!   I'm not sure how to nail the temperature matching part down. Honestly, with a 20 minute drive I doubt the temp will deviate much. Just be sure to give it a check and make sure the temps of the new tank (some new water, some old water) and bucket water are similar enough."

PlantedTank,385151,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:01:52 2015 UTC,"I moved my 15 gallon 12 hours (1000 miles) last winter without any lost stock.  I removed filter media, driftwood, fish and all inverts I could catch, drained the water and left all but the floating plants in the tank.  The stock was in 5 gal buckets of tank water with a battery powered air pump.  My tank is half the size of yours, though, so I would probably break yours down if I were you.  The plants will survive the trip no problem and will re-root.  You can also take this opportunity to fix your hardscape or rearrange it if you like.  Good luck!  Its not as bad as it seems, was much easier than I anticipated (still a pain though).  Edit:  I also agree with Crasymike, but I don't agree that moving is a rush.  Take your time so you don't mess something up.  Get a couple 5 gal buckets with lids and keep your stuff in those and you will have plenty of time.  If you add an airstone for the filter media you will have even more time.  Like I said, my move was over 12 hours and everything did just fine."

These biochemicals are known as allelochemicals and can have beneficial (positive allelopathy) or detrimental (negative allelopathy) effects on the target organisms. Allelochemicals are a subset of secondary metabolites,  which are not required for metabolism (i.e. growth, development and reproduction) of the allelopathic organism. Allelochemicals with negative allelopathic effects are an important part of plant defense against herbivory.

PlantedTank,37yw2o,ButteredScrimp,7,Sun May 31 17:18:52 2015 UTC,Your plants need phosphates and nitrate. Look into buying some dry ferts. Im sure thats the source of your problems.
PlantedTank,37yw2o,Soidfuf,2,Sun May 31 16:10:13 2015 UTC,What /u/ButteredScrimp is telling you is the most important thing anyone has told you yet! You need to address your macros immediately. Increased water changes are lowering your nutrient levels and thus worsening your algae issue. Adding more plants would starve more plants of nutrients and just killing your new plants too! So don't do what they are saying if your nitrate and phosphorous levels are truly zero! Your plants are being out-competed for nutrients by algae because there is an inadequate environment for them to flourish. Once you provide an adequate environment for your plants the algae will be defeated over time. I would not say your lights are too bright unless they are literally burning the plant leaves yellow. Brightness of lights simply necessitates more nutrients for the plants to process due to adequate photosynthetic light. Also make sure you CO2 is at 30 ppm! Good luck!
PlantedTank,37yw2o,ButteredScrimp,2,Sun May 31 16:42:34 2015 UTC,Well said. Im glad you pointed out all of the false information given in this thread.
PlantedTank,37yw2o,Village_ponce,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:13:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  That makes sense.  I am dosing nitrogen, potassium according to what seachem suggests on the bottle, along with half of what seachem suggests for phosphorus everyother day(because people say phosphorus leads to algae)  and on the other days I am dosing recommended amount of seachem trace.  My co2 is automatically controlled and seems very stable at around 30 ppm according to my drop checker and pH.  Should I start increasing my nutrients?  Plants seem green even the closest ones to the light, no yellow."
PlantedTank,37yw2o,twinsizebed,2,Mon Jun 1 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"Just make sure you get your nitrates to 10-20 and your phosphates probably around 1-2 (most importantly dose and watch your plants response over time and adjust accordingly). Your tank seems to be a high light setup and thus needs ample levels of all nutrients macro and micro to allow your plants to get a grip. You've got Co2 on lock which is good you can now just forget about that being an issue. You may want to make sure you have adequate water movement in the tank to distribute your nutrients and CO2 evenly. Also, physical removal of algae will help speed up the recovery once you've got your macros adjusted properly.   Most people like to say that a certain nutrient CAUSES a certain type of algae when its really not supported by any testing just what they've heard and seen. Tom Barr is a popular aquarist who really shows the invalidity of most of these claims by testing them. What he finds is that its deficiencies in one or many of the levels of all required nutrients cause algae simply because the plants are stagnating waiting for a nutrient (or multiple). This renders them in a weakened state allowing them to be consumed by algae. A healthy plant, as a higher organism, will out-compete algae given a preferable environment. So get your plants healthy and the algae will lose out.   For example it has been stated that Phosphate causes BBA. If that were the case and aquarium with adequate levels of all nutrients and an extreme excess of phosphate would show BBA 100% of the time and it doesn't. The only way to know what causes an algae is to purposely control variables and induce it by changing ONE variable, its basic science. Side note, BBA is usually a CO2 issue not a phosphate issue.   However, sometimes nutrients themselves are the cause, for example: I dose phosphates in my tank to limit green spot algae. This is supported by the fact that simply lowering my phosphates increases GSA and increasing it reduces it. When all other variables remain constant and one variable changes producing a result then I know that that variable is my man."

PlantedTank,37yw2o,ButteredScrimp,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:05:16 2015 UTC,"Depends what youre using. If youre just using seachem flourish, its not enough. Thats just for your micronutrients. More importantly, you need macronutrients which are nitrate, phosphate, and potassium.   There are some seachem products for macros but they are pretty much a waste of money since you can get a years supply of dry ferts for the same price or cheaper. Its very easy to overdose these though which is a bad thing. I would suggest, with all aquarium stuff, to do some reading about fertilizing. Specifically about macro and micro nutrients."

PlantedTank,37yw2o,Larsvb,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:53:57 2015 UTC,"For fast result I would honestly consider restarting, see that its pretty bad algae however if you're really dedicated, do a three day blackout (cover entire tank with a blanket and let no light in). After that try raising the light higher from tank or dimming it, and adding in more plants to starve the algae. Feed less and do 2x weekly water change. A combination of all those should really help."

Too much light doesn't cause algae, its lighting levels without matching nutrient and CO2 levels (and technically matching plant mass) that cause algae. Plants without adequate levels of nutrients and CO2 with tons of light get easily out-competed by algae."
PlantedTank,37yzh0,Soidfuf,2,Mon Jun 1 04:36:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Too much light does cause algae. Even after EI dosing and pumping in 30+ppm of co2 you will get algae with an extremely strong light.   If what you said was true, then a tank with a single plant (low plant density) would not have algae with an extremely strong light if there were matching nutrient and co2 levels. Furthermore, many have found that extremely high nutrient levels do not cause algae, hence why we EI dose. This is why in setting up a planted tank you want to dose the 30ppm of co2 or no co2, EI dose, then finally find a light matching your needs (low to high tech). Basically, the light is the biggest piece in controlling your algae because it depends on the other two factors in the tank."

Naturally what I said could be taken to an extreme like you've done where you have an obviously massive amount of light hooked up to one tank with obviously massive amount of fertilizers with one plant added and yes, you would be right. In the context of this post we are talking about a traditional high tech tank, striving for a traditional fert regime, with a traditional light... Op's light is not excessive, its a normal high rated light, because OP desires certain types of plants that require it... so why blame it for the algae when its really the nutrient levels.    Basically, the light is the biggest piece in controlling your algae because it depends on the other two factors in the tank.

PlantedTank,37x576,NavyOtter,1 point,Sun May 31 17:51:27 2015 UTC,Thank you!   There is a sliding door that keeps everyone safely inside. It's basically a glass panel with screen vents at the top and the bottom of the door. The vents work really awesomely to keep moisture off the front viewing glass.   There is a planted ground area on the left there that could flood so i don't think a rain function would be best. Maybe if it was isolated to only the area above the water section. A mister is definitely coming soon. I mist twice a day  and that keeps the humidity at around 50-80 percent.

PlantedTank,37x59n,Embors,1 point,Sun May 31 04:22:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks,  I'm feeling pretty happy with the tank. Took a little while to fill in. Tank specs are pretty basic. t5s up top for light, fluorite with root tabs (which need to be replaced), and I dose seachem flourish like once a week. No excel or co2.   From what I have read, this is just how the plant grows. Once it starts to take off it really gets going and spits out new leaves all the time.,"
PlantedTank,37x59n,phyzzix,1 point,Sun May 31 08:36:22 2015 UTC,"It will grow to the surface of your tank unless you try to stop it. Give it another 4-8 weeks since you don't have CO2. Once of the best looking zero maintenance plants in my opinion. The only problem I have with it is that it takes up a lot of space, and if you have high flow some leaves will fall off."

PlantedTank,37wynz,Gfunk98,2,Sun May 31 02:24:11 2015 UTC,"Hello again gfunk ;)  Alternanthera is mostly a medium-high light plant. You can keep it in low light if you dose ferts but it will eventually turn green instead of red. The most important thing about keeping it though, is Co2. This plant is heavily dependant on Co2. Had it in Medium light with no Co2 and it lost all its leaves within a week. I added a Co2 System and it came back within days, it was incredible.  P.S. I go to the same PetSmart as you do, why do you find stuff so cheap and I can't find dick?"
PlantedTank,37wynz,Embors,1 point,Sun May 31 04:27:32 2015 UTC,"Hey Embors (:   I have it in a 5g tank with a 5000k cfl bulb so that's should be enough, for co2 could I use API co2 boost? Like the liquid carbon whatever?   And I always look for what ever ones they have one sale, if they have some that are starting to die that have been there for too long they just mark them down to a dollar so they go pretty fast haha"
PlantedTank,37wynz,Embors,2,Sun May 31 07:55:41 2015 UTC,"The color spectrum is not as important as watts, but it is a little odd that you have a 5000k bulb as plants do better around 6500k, but that shouldn't be too much of an issue. What is the wattage on the bulb you're running? I'm not sure how it will do with liquid carbon as I have never tried it, so I can't give you any more advice :(  All I know is that it just doesn't do well without Co2. It may work with Liquid Co2, or it might not. In the end, it was only a dollar anyways right? lol"
PlantedTank,37wynz,Embors,1 point,Sun May 31 08:01:48 2015 UTC,It's a 60 watt but I think it's equivalent to 15 watt I think I heard some where that you can substitute liquid and exactly! That's the only time I will by plants what I don't know anything about. Onetime I think I got 5 or 6 different 10 dollar plants when they were on clearance hahaha all but one may have died but it was so worth it

Thank you for the suggestion though.  BTW how is Amazonia Aqua Soil working out in your 125g? It seems like a really great substrate.  Are you using an slow release fertilizers in the substrate?"
PlantedTank,37w1ke,criason,2,Sun May 31 01:05:31 2015 UTC,It is still leaching amonia and the ph has been dropping too low.   I have been doing water changes and dosing a bit of baking soda to bring the ph into more neutral ranges.  But I will say that the soil is amazing for growth.   My crypts had 5 inches of root growth in under a week.  And my pearl weed has grown enough for me to trim and replant it 3 times.   I didn't get any cloudy water from the soil particulates and when I do disturb it on accident it settles very quickly.    I am dosing the water column lightly for now until I get things balanced out and the growth gets more full and needs more.  I do plan to use osmocote plus and gel caps for root tabs as well.
PlantedTank,37w1ke,criason,1 point,Sun May 31 15:41:56 2015 UTC,Thank you.  Hope the pH issues work out.  That amount of growth is awesome.  I never seem to have much luck with crypts

PlantedTank,37w1ke,Soidfuf,2,Sun May 31 22:04:04 2015 UTC,If you're going low tech with dirt you won't want to dose fertilizers unless you start seeing deficiencies in your plants.
PlantedTank,37w1ke,VoilaVoilaWashington,1 point,Sun May 31 06:15:21 2015 UTC,Do you think root tabs or slow release substrate fertilizers would be a good idea?  I am not really familiar with them so any advice wold be appreciated.  Thank you

PlantedTank,37vdtr,OGHamToast,1 point,Sat May 30 20:40:16 2015 UTC,"I just planted this 3 days ago.  Have done two 50% water changes.   The water appears to be an amber colour.   It gets better after a change but slowly becomes darker the next day.  I used MGOC as the soil and NG black substrate as a cap (1"").  Could it be tannins from the soil?  I'm running 36w of cfl 11"" from substrate, 10 hours a day with a 4 hour rest period in the afternoon."
PlantedTank,37vdtr,RiddleRiddle,3,Sat May 30 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"So that driftwood you have in there is your tannin culprit. Maybe you didn't soak it long enough before you put it in, i let mine soak 2 weeks and i got a bit. But keep in mind that tannins arent a bad thing. its softening your PH making it a great environment for amazon life. there a lot of fish that would thrive in that water opposed to crystal clear water, for example my favorite fish right now Chili Rasboras. But if you really want to get rid of it just keep up with your water changes and it will eventually all leach out of the wood."

PlantedTank,37s1jh,sedialpha5,2,Tue Jun 9 01:37:26 2015 UTC,"The Estimative Index (EI) coined by Tom Barr is a straightforward method for providing nutrients for a planted tank. The idea behind EI is simply introducing an excess amount of nutrients within an aquarium, throughout the week. This excess of nutrients floods the water column and feeds the plants. This is an estimative method; measuring specific nutrient uptake rates is not necessary and no test kits are involved. EI provides a surplus of nutrients that helps to prevents plant deficiencies, and allows plant growth to out compete algae growth.  The process of which this is done is simple. Each day fertilizers are dosed, and the nutrients are absorbed by the plants. With this method being estimative, we can dose fertilizers according to general guidelines suited for our particular setup (see below). At the end of the week, one performs a 50% water change to ‘reset’ the nutrient load in the entire system. And then the entire dosing schedule is repeated. (Taken from aquaticplantcentral)  Just google ""EI dosing"" and you'll get a bunch of links explaining it. Let me know if you need help. Basically you dose ferts everyday so that nutrients will never be lacking. You provide a surplus of nutrients (with optimal conditions like co2 and light) so that plants have no deficiencies and will outgrow algae."

Personally i think i would look awesome if you separated the two trunks to either side of the tank and bowed them out with the empty space in the middle. Then you have a lot of room for great foreground plants with nice open space above, background plants on the back corners would create depth leaving the focus on your driftwood and rocks. Also I think a spread out set up gives you more options for planting.   Cant wait to see what you do with it!"

PlantedTank,37uerm,krattalak,1 point,Sat May 30 23:01:08 2015 UTC,"I'm keeping 3 dwarf puffers in a 10gal and introduced 2 cherry shrimp last week. So far so good, puffers don't seem interested in them at all. I hear some people don't have good luck with this though. The puffers were curious about them when I was floating the bag and nipped at them through the plastic, which had me worried, but once they went into the tank, no issues. When the fish got close the shrimp ""pushed"" them away with their feelers, now the puffers don't bug them. It is going so well, I'm going to add more shrimp. Just stick to large cherry shrimp. I wouldn't trust them with the babies.   They will hunt around the tank and take care of your snails in no time. In fact, you're probably going to end up having to feed them something once they clean out all the snails in your tank. I'm trying to breed snails now :/ I saw someone post that it is necessary to feed them snails to wear down their beak. This is true for many puffers but apparently NOT for dwarf puffers (google around about it ..). But just be aware they are a territorial and aggressive fish, and can be picky eaters -- a bit high maintenance -- so do your research on them."
PlantedTank,37uerm,SecondhandUsername,2,Mon Jun 1 01:46:58 2015 UTC,"Pretty much anything you buy to target snails will also target your shrimp, except for assassin snails. As a general rule, 6 assassin snails/10g of tank is what you want. That said, Assassin snails also breed easily themselves, which is a bit of a problem, so I would pull them out once the ramshorns are dealt with.  As far as Puffers go, your best bet would be a Pea Puffer, which is one of the few that is exclusively fresh water, and also doesn't grow much over one inch. The problems with puffers, is they are (1) males are fantastically aggressive towards other males, so unless you know for certain how to sex them, you're limited to 1 per tank. (2) they >can< be aggressive towards tank mates (certainly snails and shrimp), but even pea puffers can be nippy, even if they are generally considered 'community' fish. It's really trial and error. (3) Puffers of all kinds are sloppy eaters. Good filtration and frequent water changes are a must. Possibly your best option would be to put a pea puffer in a bare 10g tank with a good filter and air, and toss him a half dozen or so snails every few days. (4) Puffers >must< be fed shell fish of some sort as their teeth don't stop growing and must be worn down or else they will starve to death as they grow shut. (eww)  Some people bring up Clown Loaches. Don't be tempted. Clown Loaches are actually Botias and grow to be about a foot long or more. You can't keep one in a 29g tank. End of story. However, you could try getting a Skunk Botia or a Chain Botia, which will suck snails right out of their shell. But they too have issues. (1) Botias can be aggressive. They certainly will be aggressive feeders, and if you want them to focus on snails, you will need to target feed your other fish. Full Botia's won't go after snails much. That said, Botias also can just be bullies in general. (2) Botias are shoaling fish by nature and don't do well alone or in low numbers, generally the minimum amount is at least 5. (3) Botias have no scales to protect themselves, so are extremely susceptible to poor water conditions and sometimes medications do more harm than good. Do your research on Botias of any sort before you buy them, as most of them will grow too large for your tank, only a few won't, and even they will want numbers your tank can't really support. Larger Botias (2"" and up) will probably also decide that shrimp taste pretty good also, so there's that, and they sometimes will dig up and eat plants as well. (everything is on the menu for a botia)."

PlantedTank,37r0c7,BCJunglist,3,Fri May 29 22:39:57 2015 UTC,You really need to plant the shit out of a tank if you're using dirt. Else there's just way too many nutrients.
PlantedTank,37r0c7,deadkactus,1 point,Sat May 30 01:21:04 2015 UTC,Yea I did over plant it but the algae tool over when I got lazy with water changes and my filter flaked out... And my plants started dying off.  I need to put a bunch of work and new plants into it now that I made a new filter.
PlantedTank,37r0c7,CaptainTurdfinger,2,Sat May 30 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"The filter actually  uses ammonia that the plants can use for energy. Plants actually prefer ammonia to nitrates for energy. If you dont have the tank heavily stocked you probably dont need a filter if you have a bunch of plants, just a power head to circulate the water, or use fresh carbon as the filter media as that helps remove some unwanted chemicals from the water, what those chemicals are is too complex for this comment. The plants will purify the water and remove ammonia without adding waste chemicals in the water unlike the nitrifying bacteria that colonize the filter media. You should also shorten the photosynthetic period as that raises the amount of co2 by letting it build up when the lights are off in the middle of the day. some types of algea can be triggered by the lack of specific nutrients as well as surplus. air stones remove co2 from the tank by agitating the surface and should be turned on when the plants are releasing co2 at night but not during the photosynthetic periods. Biological functions release co2 and other nutrients plants need, so in some cases adding more to the bioload of the tank can help the plants. Too many water changes can remove nutrients plants need, the should be done in longer cycles in a low tech planted tank  if you dont have a large fish bioload unless its been freshly dirted and even then you have to be careful not to agitate the soil and release nutrients into the water column all over again. If your lights are too strong for the amounts of co2 in the tank it can trigger algea that use co2 much faster than submerged plants, most submerged plants are really shade plants unless they are being ""super charged"" for growth by co2 injection and synthetic fertilizers.The ecology of the planted aquarium is a good book to read if you are having issues with your tank."

PlantedTank,37t4fo,CrasyMike,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:09:58 2015 UTC,"How would heat not work? That's what did it for me. I never got new Ich spots on fish after a few days after I increased the temperature.  It ends the life cycle of the Ich. No more Ich. They key is though that simply ""increasing temperature"" alone won't do anything. It MUST be quite high and stay high. I can't remember the exact temp."
PlantedTank,37t4fo,rhandyrhoads,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:39:02 2015 UTC,"It does not end the life cycle of the ich.  It simply speeds it up.  Now I have heard of some varieties which can't breed at higher temperatures but most of them require temperatures which would be detrimental to the fish.  Now in the aquarium there is always going to be pathogens present of stuff like ich.  What triggers it is stress.  In the life cycle of ich it can't reproduce when attached to a host so it eventually drops off and reproduces and then finds a new host.  What happens in your tank probably is that the ich drops off and simply can't find a vulnerable host, but in many cases someone will make this assumption that the ich is gone when it is really just in the breeding phase and then it will come back in even larger numbers."
PlantedTank,37t4fo,CrasyMike,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:19:54 2015 UTC,"Now in the aquarium there is always going to be pathogens present of stuff like ich. What triggers it is stress.   I'll start on this one. This is misleading. Ich is not always present. It can be introduced easily considering it exists in any body of water...but c'mon. Think about it.  It doesn't even make sense. Ich must have a host to continue the life cycle. The infection is always visible as part of breeding. Those white dots. That is required as part of the life cycle. You cannot have the life cycle without the white dots.   So, where is the Ich when it does not have a vulnerable host? Living for months ""dormant""? No, Ich has a short-life cycle - less than a week at normal aquarium temperatures. In order to continue to survive you would need an ever present ich infection and couple of white spots on at least one fish.   There is no many month ""dormant breeding phase"" without infection on a host. The life cycle is 1 week at normal temperatures, down to 8 weeks at near freezing temperatures. But if there's no dots, for sure, for 2 weeks you're done. Ich is dead.  Sure, you can have some ich in your tank at some times from water from your taps maybe or new introductions or your hands or something (maybe you went fishing) but if that ich does not find a host and manage to feed and breed then it will die in a week or two. The only reason people believe that is because they for some reason think ""Well where else could it come from?!"" meanwhile they were at the cottage that day fishing on the lake.  This is all information from the wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyophthirius_multifiliis   Now I have heard of some varieties which can't breed at higher temperatures but most of them require temperatures which would be detrimental to the fish.    85F temporarily is not detrimental to the fish, just a pain in the ass. It's not optimal, and it runs a lot of extra risk with not providing sufficient oxygen in the water. It would be a huge temperature swing in a day if your heater came unplugged one day (85F+ to room temp vs. 75-78F to room temp is a big difference) and you'd have to take a lot of care to ensure oxygenation of the water.   But for two weeks? Not a big deal. Get a bubbler going and keep the temperature monitored daily. It's fine. It can stunt the growth of plants maybe but most fish will adapt fine excepting certain species.   Medicine works well too though, combined with increased temps (maybe 80-83F vs. 86-88F) or salt and increased temps.  But heat alone at 87F works. It's just...not a pleasurable experience. Bubblers, temp monitoring, spending like 2 days increasing the temp slowly...ugh. And if it slips below 85F for a couple of hours then you might as well start over counting the days again...big pain in the ass. But it works. There is one rare strain of ich that does not respond to it, apparently, there are vague reports of it not working.   But 86F + meds/salt and ich WILL be gone."
PlantedTank,37t4fo,rhandyrhoads,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:43:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying your fish don't do fine with the high temperature, but this will stress out some fish and stress is one of the biggest causes of ich. I was told to increase heat and add salt after one of my clowns got ich (I hadn't added new fish in weeks and it's been a long long time since I've gone fishing) so I raised it up to 85ish and gradually added salt.  The result was ich spreading to the rest of the clowns and two clowns dead.  After that I had to rush out and pick up the first ich medicine I could find which ended up staining some of my rocks.  Those rocks are better now since it's Florida limestone which dissolves fairly rapidly, but advocating heat and salt over proper medication is definitely not the best idea when proper medication is an option."
PlantedTank,37t4fo,CrasyMike,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"85ish won't do. Under 85 during the life cycle will cause that spread thanks to a faster life cycle. You need to combine that with medication and water changes. You need to get it definitively above 85F if you're going to hope heat alone helps. That could not have happened with the temp above 85.   Saying heat doesn't really work, ""only works on some varieties"", ""ich is always present"", ""fish are harmed by temps that high"" is false. That's what I was focused on correcting.   If someone has an infestation and has a lot of driftwood and plants (which is pretty common) then doing heat alone does work. If there's currently one fish with ich and the rest are healthy, or stores are closed or its a cottage tank heat alone can be a really good option.  I liked raising the heat when I had just one very unhealthy fish with ich. Heat alone allowed ich to only spread to one other fish since it could not breed nothing else got touched. That very unhealthy fish was done for (mouth fungus + ich + already looking bad means it needed a miracle) but nothing else got sick at all. And I didn't even have to change the water more than normal or mess with the tank decor/plants.   I don't advocate avoiding medicine or salt though. I never said that. I'm just saying you can't say heat isn't valid. It's wrong. Medicine or salt is a great combo for sure. Nothing wrong with salt either. That kills the ich. Both medication or salt will treat the entire water volume."
PlantedTank,37t4fo,rhandyrhoads,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:56:58 2015 UTC,I stated that I used salt in conjunction with high temperature.
PlantedTank,37t4fo,CrasyMike,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to try salt and heat. But I had to avoid salt and meds. Heat worked. I just went fuck it, raised the temp slowly and saw what happened if I straight up kept the temp at 87F.  I felt like it would be too easy to mess up. I'll admit, heat is probably the easiest to screw up. Heat it too fast? Fish die. Heat it is too slow? Ich gets to live more. Cool it off too fast? Same thing. Heater fails or can't heat it sufficiently with the light off? Doesn't work.   Salt is probably the second hardest to mess up. Granted, if you get the right concentration it will kill the Ich. But none of us probably use salt regularly, and we probably get scared to dose it properly. If you act conservatively and don't hit the concentration the ich will not be affected. Doesn't work again.   I'm betting you didn't high the salt concentration or the temperature. Because conservatism.   Medicine works well, but again it is important to avoid stating that nothing else works but meds."

If you're having problems with getting stems rooted because it melts, you might need a better substrate.  An alternative...would be to let it float in the water until you start seeing water roots sprout on it, trim one side or the other from the root, leaving leaves on the stem with the roots, and replant then. Wisteria is very floaty, so it's hard sometimes to get stems to root, but it grows readily when it's floating, so it's pretty easy to get it to recover and regain it's bulk.  Wisteria doesn't require a lot of light, but rooting wouldn't be hurt by adding root tabs, or by using Flourish. I'd hold off on excel until it's rooted."

They're usually a good bit more expensive, and sometimes they don't work well at all with some tank hardware and fish communities. I had trouble with snails getting murdered by some circulation pumps. Also, some fish (even if they're fairly community compatible) may try to nibble on their feelers and terrorize the snails a bit. I had issues with an angelfish that I have since rehomed, a few gouramis, and I know some Bettas aren't good with snails as well.  As for feeding, they're pretty cool. Be SURE they have enough calcium in their diet, or they'll get pretty sad looking. Lots of the stock I get in bulk for breeding has to be kept on as breeding stock since their shells are sometimes really weak and pitted from insufficient water/diet needs. I feel Ken's Premium Sinking Veggie Sticks with Calcium to mine. If you have critters that are piggies and immediately scoop up any sinking food, you might have an issue, but I've never needed to separate anybody I keep to be fed :)"

PlantedTank,37ldis,swindlebin,3,Thu May 28 13:49:18 2015 UTC,"Most RO systems will come with some type of tank to store water as its filtered(maybe 2 gallons or so) and provide water pressure, This way you actually have water available since the filtration process is fairly slow. If it were me I would store at least enough RO water to do a 50% water change(just in case)in a water barrel or something along those lines and pump water out of that into your aquarium as needed. Then you aren't waiting hours to have enough water to do your weekly water changes."
PlantedTank,37ldis,kaze3oh3,4,Thu May 28 14:38:50 2015 UTC,You are going to want a five stage system and might as well start with that.  You need sediment->activated carbon->carbon block->ro membrane->di.   This will remove chlorine and chloramines before it gets to the ro membrane which can burn it up.  You will also burn your di resin very fast with a 3 stage.   Most people seem to use a brute trash can with a float switch as you likely will need a pump to use a storage tank correctly.    You will also need to use some salts to get ph and kh up as well as minerals to bring up gh.  It is not a super simple process and some people (myself included) have better luck cutting with tap (or ro reject water).
PlantedTank,37ldis,nekt,2,Thu May 28 15:10:58 2015 UTC,Depends how quickly you want to fill/refill your tank. With the 50 gallon you will be able to filter up to 50 gallons per day so just over 2 gph with the 100 gallon you'd be at just over 4 gph. How much R O water is available would depend on how big of a reserve tank you have
PlantedTank,37ldis,kaze3oh3,2,Thu May 28 14:17:27 2015 UTC,It all depends on the flow rate you want. You could have a small system with a constant drip to continually change the water. I have a setup like this on my tank minus the ro.
PlantedTank,37ldis,PippyLongSausage,2,Thu May 28 14:58:01 2015 UTC,The gallons promised is the maximum amount the system can produce in one 24 hour period. So if you hook up a 50 gallon filter to your main water line and then have a line  going directly into your 160 gal. Tank ( empty) at the end of 24 hours you would have 50 gal. Of filtered water in your tank.
PlantedTank,37ldis,kaze3oh3,2,Thu May 28 15:32:36 2015 UTC,"How big of a RO system should I buy for a 160 gallon tank? I am looking at either a 50 gallon 3-stage or a 100 gallon 3-stage from Aquatic Life on Amazon. What is really the difference? Is the difference the rate; how much time I'd have to wait for that much water?    RO systems are usually rated by GPD which stands for gallons per day.  The ones on Amazon from aquatic life are 50 GPD and 100 GPD.  The size you should buy depends on how patient you are and how long you are willing to wait for RO water.   Also, how is the pure water harvested? Do people pump it directly into the tank with a hose or do you collect it separately and then pump it into the tank after a water change?    You can technically have the RO plumbed directly into your system, but that would be a bad idea unless you have a way to prevent the tank from overflowing.  Most people collect the RO water in a container.  Depending on the size of the system and how long you plan to leave it on, you can use a 5 gallon bucket up to a 55 gallon barrel.   Something else to keep in mind is the filter's rejection rate.  For the Amazon units, it's 1:4.5, which means for every gallon of RO water that you make, you will have 4.5 gallons of wastewater.  That wastewater will have to go somewhere.  I guess you could just dump it down the drain, but it would be better to use it somehow.   Is it possible to use the water from one RO system for multiple tanks?   Yup, as long as the output volume of the RO unit is high enough for multiple tanks."
PlantedTank,37ldis,smootie,1 point,Thu May 28 20:04:18 2015 UTC,Do you need a RODI system for a tank or will RO water do.  I guess i am confused at the difference between the two and the advantages Etc
PlantedTank,37ldis,Rocketmax,1 point,Fri May 29 03:47:51 2015 UTC,"RO units only do reverse osmosis, which is where water gets forced through a membrane to filter out dissolved solids.  RO/DI uses the same filter, but also includes a second filtering process.  The RO water is passed through ionized beads that attract the rest of the dissolved solids.  RO water still has some dissolved solids, maybe 90% or more is removed by the filter.  The DI filter removes the rest so that the water will be pure, meaning that there will be zero dissolved solids in it.  The advantages of RO only is that the units are cheaper and you will pay less money for replacement filters since you won't need to buy DI filter replacements.  Depending on your tank, you may not want to remove all dissolved solids.  RO/DI filters will cost more to purchase and maintain, but you'll get 100% pure water.  It gives you more control, but you'll likely have to dose trace nutrients for your plants and critters to stay healthy."

I'm still searching for a good video on youtube that could potentially answer my questions. My big unanswered question is, does the gallons promised mean that it will take a whole day, hour, or how long to produce. Because I could wait for my water. I also heard on plantedtank.net that the pressure of your water determines whether your system can handle being double membrane, and that if you can achieve the right water pressure it can help the life of your membranes AND give you higher water output. This STILL confused me, how long are people waiting for said gallons?"
PlantedTank,37lbdi,assmuffin156,1 point,Thu May 28 13:32:55 2015 UTC,I think it's easier generally for a submerged plant to grow emerged than a plant grown out of water to be grown in water.

For instance, many of the fancy pro trees you see in pictures with moss all over their base are not actually grown like that. They only add the moss long enough to display for the picture. Also, most all bonsai cannot be grown indoors. Ones that can generally require grow lights, otherwise they won't grow very dense & tree like."

PlantedTank,37hd58,sethamphetamine,5,Wed May 27 17:20:55 2015 UTC,"Here is what I have learned. It probably over simplifies it all and I might be incorrect in some ways.  Algae is a bit special. It's special because basically there is some type of it that will thrive in the shitty conditions - give it light and some type of algae will grow regardless of other factors. Minimal nutrients, some CO2 and light. Or maybe too much nutrients, low CO2 and light.    However, with light and nutrients and CO2 in balance the plants basically take over. But if the plants have insufficient nutrients they will not consume the CO2 effectively. Then you get algae. Or maybe you have enough nutrients, but low CO2. Algae again, because it can exist in the nutrient rich low CO2 water. Meanwhile your plants are struggling. Not good.  See this link: http://www.theplantedtank.co.uk/algae.htm Notice that nearly all of the algae thrive in some sort of off-balance water - low nutrients, low CO2, high nutrients with low CO2, etc etc. Only a few of them you can only eliminate through only removal/blackout but the rest REQUIRE some imbalance.   Plants are delicate. They require that balance of all 3. At that point the plants will consume the nutrients and the CO2 and leave just a bit for the algae and you end up with that attractive natural looking ""spots"" of algae, not growth of algae.   Too much light and again the plants are not effectively using up the nutrients and CO2 effectively because they require a long period of darkness in order to complete their cycle. That said I think you can pull off a 12 hour day, but going into 12-16 hours regularily and you're really fucking up the balance.   Why don't you use a timer?"
PlantedTank,37hd58,CrasyMike,3,Wed May 27 18:21:11 2015 UTC,"You do not have to run it continuously for 12 hours. I run mine in 6 hour stretches with a 4 hour break in the middle of the day. So, it is on in the morning and when I get home from work. Furthermore, you can off set it so it turns on later in the day like 2 pm and run till 2am if you want."
PlantedTank,37hd58,Bigreddazer,2,Wed May 27 18:44:16 2015 UTC,Start your lights later in the day with a timer and time it to shut off past when you get home so that you  can see the the tank when you get home and also not give it too much light.   Do you have pics? There are different  kinds of algaes and reasons why that certain type pops up but its generally a imbalance of something. Too much/not enough  of something. Like my  low light tank had slow growers and needed fast growing plants  to use more of the nutrients. My high tech gets intense light and gets some algae from that.   You can always think about adding a small algae eater if you're not overstocked to manage it... My nerite snails and shrimp have been doing a good job of cleanup on a minor algae growth.

If you were really concerned then maybe a floss pad on top of the foam pad could work? I do not breed shrimp though so this is just my best guess.

PlantedTank,37jtxv,Stank70,5,Thu May 28 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"Cory cats should be in groups of no less than 5, so if you want them please get a group. :) You might also consider some micro fish species like chili rasbora or celestial pearl danio. Scarlet badis, pygmy sunfish, and peacock gudgeon are all pretty cool little fish too.  As far as the tank goes, a 20 long is pretty easy and a good size. If you want a nice carpet, it's best if you dose co2 or use glutaraldehyde. If you go with glut, metricide is the cheapest ""bang for your buck"" deal. Without either it would take a very, very long time to carpet nicely. Monte carlo and hairgrass are pretty easy without pressurized co2 as long as you have decent lighting.  For lighting, my first choice would be the Finnex planted+ 24/7, however they are pretty backordered unless you can find one local to you. Second choice would be the 'old' planted+, Finnex Stingray, or a current satellite pro.  What light you end up with will, kind of, determine what plants you can get. A 20 long is already short, so it's not as important in your case. Examples of common low-light/easy plants: java ferns, anubias, moss, hornwort, ludwigia sp, crypts, swords, wisteria, cabomba, water sprite, and moneywort.  By and far my favorite substrate is blasting sand because of the grain size, black color, and cheap price. With Osmocote+ root tabs (very cheap on Ebay last I checked) and dry ferts, I've grown everything from carpets to stems with no problems. Honestly though, substrate doesn't really matter as long as you're fertilizing properly. You can go for the expensive stuff like AquaSoil or Eco-complete if you want to. Ideally, you would have it at least 1.5-2 inches deep for easy planting."
PlantedTank,37jtxv,Verivus,2,Thu May 28 05:56:15 2015 UTC,Would you mind explaining what metricide is? And how comparable to pressurized Co2 it is? This is the first time I've heard of it
PlantedTank,37jtxv,bettasandplantsetc,2,Thu May 28 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"Metricide is just glutaraldehyde, which is exactly what flourish excel is but cheaper. It is used as disinfectant/algaecide, but for some reason it also can be used like co2 in planted tanks. The exact process is still a mystery, but it works. I have no idea how anyone figured it out, but it's a popular alternative method to pressurized co2. It's not as good as p. co2, but it's a nice option with the added bonus of algae control."
PlantedTank,37jtxv,Verivus,1 point,Thu May 28 21:25:16 2015 UTC,"I do like the sound of cheapness. Even though I'm only dosing a little under 2ml a day of excel between two tanks.

PlantedTank,37gvzr,GreenAdept,1 point,Thu May 28 03:59:04 2015 UTC,"Instead of a solenoid just use an airstone plus a timer.  Have the airstone come on when you want the CO2 ""off"" and then in the morning have the airstone turn off when the CO2 needs to turn ""On"".  Even though the CO2 will be running 24/7 because of the surface aggitation caused by the airstone the CO2 will be released during the night.  Airstones/pumps are dirt cheap and timers are as well, but I'd wager you probably already have both meaning this may be of no cost to you.  As mentioned above a solenoid could result in an exploding bottle.  If you're stuck on using a solenoid instead have it open an alternate path for the air to vent out of rather than just shutting off the line that feeds into the tank."

PlantedTank,37g4h3,Hidden_Ninja_Panda,0,Wed May 27 12:57:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I took some shrimp from my shrimp tank and put then in my 40 and they all I assume died from excel dousing. My bamboo shrimp are fine though.

At one point, I think he was MIA for about 2 months before I saw him walking around like nothing ever happened. Hopefully this is what happened to your shrimp."
