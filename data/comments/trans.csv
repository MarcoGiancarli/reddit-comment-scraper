I've been where you are in a lot of ways, I married at 25, and lived a fairly male life until I tried to takr my own life a couple of years ago.  Now,  I live full-time as the authentic me and have never been happier.  I've lost things, sure, my wife being one of those casualties, but there just came a point where I was no good, and now we're still great friends.  PM me if you want to chat more. I'm always willing to lend an ear (or eye as the case may be...)"

We divorced a few weeks ago, and its probably the hardest thing I've ever done. I'm still very much in love with her,  however she doesn't want to be with a woman. Its as simple as that.  We're still really good friends, our relationship has just changed to that of great friends, so no-toucy. Easy enough to to.  At the end of the day, you have to do what will bring you the most happiness. As living as someone you're not for an extended period of time will ultimately just end up hurting you more in the long run...

So, the Girl Scouts, being complete and total badasses, decided to return the money and inspired by the bigot's hostility, started an indiegogo campaign to raise the $100,000 themselves. When I checked it, it was at $63,000 and climbing fast with a full 30 days to go in the campaign. An hour later, another redditor reported it was at $95,000 already, but it seems people have crashed the webpage from throwing so much damn money at it.

Don't worry about how you look, focus on how you want to feel. Taking the steps to make myself look more feminine has been so joyous and exciting. Just experiment. Shave your legs or something and just focus on how it feels to do.

You're just offering them an identity that is closer to You.   I really hope this helps. I'm so glad you reached out about this.

It also ignores the negative effects of cis-centric LGBTQ* organizers on movements. Examples of this include HRC's exclusion of trans people in the ENDA.  Also, Jeff White is a huge idiot. He says the term cis is a slur. Cis is a latin prefix that runs parallel to trans as a prefix. It is not a slur. Its similar to the prefixes hetero and homo. White argues that because cis people did not collectively identify as cis, it is not valid. I dont think straight people collectively chose the prefix hetero and I wonder if White also opposes the use of hetero for the same reason.  Also, White claims cis people are oppressed by trans people when they are called out for oppressive behavior if the calling out employs the word cis.   So, if I were to say cis people often misgender me, then I am an oppressor according to White."

trans,397kas,MaybePossiblyaSarah,3,Tue Jun 9 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah i like that too, so she comes off as a fully realized person who has already dealt with being trans instead of that being her whole thing."

trans,3950ez,Mouq,2,Tue Jun 9 09:06:21 2015 UTC,How so?
trans,3950ez,Softvent,3,Tue Jun 9 09:14:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on how they choose to present, which combination of traits, the timeline for presenting those traits"
trans,3950ez,Softvent,2,Tue Jun 9 18:01:25 2015 UTC,"present: as a girl. i.e. he wants to wear female clothing, makeup, have long hair, have the freedom to act feminine if he chooses, etc.  combination of traits: basically a woman's body but with the breasts taken off and the addition of male genitalia. So male primary sex traits (genitalia, no breasts) fused with female secondary sex traits (the body, stuff like less muscle and such.)  timeline: ??? he isn't sure how to proceed."
trans,3950ez,kanad3,2,Wed Jun 10 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really clear about timeline, I meant would they want to present full time, socially, privately at home?  It might be achieved through HRT and chest binding, which I hear can slow/stop the development of breasts, but still give female muscle/fat distribution.  Its also quite common for transgender people to not get bottom surgery."
trans,3950ez,Mouq,2,Wed Jun 10 11:55:55 2015 UTC,"Then, he's not sure about that."
trans,3950ez,ophcourse,0,Wed Jun 10 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"Androgynity isn't a gender identity, though."
trans,3950ez,rimarua,2,Wed Jun 10 06:36:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's easy to find sources that disagree. http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Androgyne is one. Also note that ""androgynous"" generally refers to the typical usage, and ""androgyne"" or ""androgynous gender"" are generally specialized to refer to the identity. As an aside, I think androgyne implies more ambiguous than mixed, and bigender may be a better answer to the question. But it really isn't something that can be said with so little information about the individual. Perhaps in the future these terms will settle down somewhat."

trans,3950ez,ConsideratelyYours,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:39:12 2015 UTC,How am I supposed to pick one then?
trans,3950ez,korbl,2,Wed Jun 10 01:37:06 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend reading up on each one and  deciding which you feel suits you best. Ultimately, only  you  can  know how you identify. Those are a few good places to start, though."
trans,3950ez,emma-_______,2,Wed Jun 10 02:48:19 2015 UTC,"Well I've tried doing that but it just makes me more confused. Some of the terms are overlapping or mean the exact same thing. I can't wrap my head around where one ends and another begins.   The way these terms are described are very vague. Why can't they just simply say ""people who are birth sex A and desire a body that is B and desire presentation that is C and mannerisms that are D, have gender identity E?"" Sounds pretty straightforward to me. Why is that so hard?  Seems to me like what I need to do is reach out and connect with people who have my exact combination of birth sex, desired body, desired presentation, and desired mannerisms; and then ask them what they identify as. Hopefully, the answers won't be all over the map."
trans,3950ez,nobodys_baby,2,Wed Jun 10 02:55:56 2015 UTC,"They can't simply say that because none of: birth sex, body, presentation, mannerisms; are as concrete as you seem to be implying. The fact is that all of the terms are used by individuals who identify with them for some combination of reasons related to those you've given, but these individuals cover a wide range of experiences, giving the terms different nuances and overlap.  Maybe more to the point: Have fun; there isn't yet a science of GQ, so there's no one who can tell you that you're wrong because you chose a word that has nuances slightly different than what you experience. I think basically you got it in your last sentence: If someone with experiences similar to your own connects these experiences to a particular term, that term may be for you. Perhaps there isn't a term for you. Perhaps you're most succinctly described by a combination of terms.  The terms don't define who you are. I think a major premise of being non-binary is the recognition that it's our existence that defines who and what we are, not what is imposed on us by others or ourselves. If you find a term that kinda fits, cool! If not, don't sweat it :)  Sorry for rant, and sorry if this totally misses the mark."
trans,3950ez,Skeptekr,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:37:56 2015 UTC,"Well, my question to you is: Pretending (for the time being) that these terms didn't exist, how would you describe yourself? Like, if you were to listen to your gut...  It can be a word. It can be a couple of words. Or it can be an entire phrase/sentence!"
trans,3950ez,korbl,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:26:01 2015 UTC,"Male who wants to present in a feminine way and have a girly figure.   That sentence is really contradictory.    I've never heard of a cis guy describing ""him""self that way."
trans,3950ez,korbl,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is. In fact, I think it makes perfect sense to me; and I actually know of a few guys who present this way! :D  I mean, if you really want to condense it further you can use something like 'genderqueer male/guy' (if that resonates with you); but otherwise, feel free to use 'male who presents as female'! :D"
trans,3950ez,korbl,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not just the presenting thing though. Like I said, I want to change my actual body to have more girly features. I don't know, would you consider that to fall under ""presentation""?"

I know it's difficult to switch gears, and it seems like a big irreversible step - but letting him continue to develop as he is is also an irreversible step.   If he says he's trans, he is almost certainly right - only a couple percent of people who transition regret it, and of those few percent, it's usually because they didn't get the results they hoped for (often due to transitioning too late). The vast majority see improvements from transitioning in all sectors of life. It reduces depression, anxiety, and suicide rates by huge margins; very high percentages (most studies estimate a little over 40%) of trans people attempt suicide before transition and few do afterward, for example.  Telling you this is probably the scariest thing he's ever done. He needs your support and complete acceptance right now more than anything in the world. If you give him that, you will very likely see him bloom like a video of a time-lapse orchid over the next few years.  When you're ready for it, here is a post I wrote up detailing a lot of the science behind trans people. If you're looking for factual support, I'd recommend reading through it."
trans,38cdht,Chel_of_the_sea,7,Wed Jun 3 09:24:10 2015 UTC,There is mention of body modification.  Blockers are not modifiers. They can them chose which puberty to go through.

Dysphoria is different for everyone but can be really bad. It can lead to self harm and suicide in a lot of cases. Not gonna sugarcoat it, that stuff isn't uncommon at all with dysphoria. The attempts suicide rate for trans people is 41%. Yeah, that wasn't a typo. Forty one percent. Scary, right? I'm going to see and endo in a month. If she tells me she won't prescribe E till I'm 18, take a really wild guess what the first thing I'll think about doing is. I've come close before, so I'm really hoping shell prescribe me. Not prescribing might push me over the edge. You don't want that for your child, so don't say no mod till 18. Instead, have him see a gender therapist and the therapist can help you figure out when, if ever, is the right time. You shouldn't rush into things head first with transition, but waiting too long and putting things off can cause a lot of harm. Even though I've survived till now, I'm not unscathed. I fucked myself up self-harming for a while. I'm proud to have quit that addiction, but if I could have started transition a lot earlier, when I first came out to my parents,that never would have happened. I'm proud to have quit, but I'm even more ashame to have started in the first place."

Most of us can tell you though, we're damn grateful for having waited out to at least try, even after a ""prime time""; every one I've met, so many of us, have been thankful for not ending ourselves.    I know it looks bleak sometimes, and maybe, like me and others, your copping mechanism might be to become cynical, haha, but please, try to hold on.  Hell, for me and one of my previous room mates, we just said to ourselves, ""How much worse can tomorrow get?  Come on life, show me.""  Holding out just a glimmer, I told myself and I know she did too, if I can at least try and if I fail, if I still can't take it after I gave HRT a real try, then I can at least hold my head up high and say to my few loved ones that I really did try.

If she gives it to me, I'll probably be ok, but if I'm forced to wait till 18... I'm just too sick of suffering so badly and I do NOT have the resilience to make it till next march without any medical treatment. From my experiences so far, that just wouldn't be realistic. So, I pretty much have to stake everything on the endo meeting on July 2. If it comes to that, I think I can already say I really did try, and got shut down."

I'm not as familiar with ftm, but the first step regardless especially if under 18 is to see a therapist, hopefully one specializing in gender identity.   You said no body modifications till 18, but I hope you do you realize that their body is already going through modifications due to their normal puberty.

Body ""modifications"" is pretty demeaning and like the others said, your kid is going through them if you do nothing because that's what puberty is gonna drag him through licking and screaming.  I know it feels like a damned if you do or don't situation, but most everyone knows at their core, at their very being even at a young age who they are and their gender.  Not everyone does, and some of us figure that out later.  Also tell your kiddo, genitals doesn't make your gender.  You don't have to have set <male/female> to be <boy/girl/in-between>; that might help, at least, it would have helped me when I was younger."

Because if your kid is certain about this (and if he came out to you, I assume he is) then enduring another 4 years of the wrong puberty is going to be really traumatic. I know it was for me."

I just told my father yesterday when I met him for dinner and it was all I could do to spit it out. I've been so blessed to have chosen so many understanding people to tell about this, but it's hard to gauge how anyone could react. My little section of North Carolina isn't too fond of deviating from that good ol' southern norm.  But know that if you tell someone and they refuse to accept you for who you are, then they aren't someone you need in your life. Especially if they can get through such a beautifully written letter without sobbing like a baby. I know I did. Heck a good part of me wants to borrow it since it's an all too similar story.

Yeah, it was a big deal for her but the fact that there was no tension or judgment helped me so much. You're already referring to him by the appropriate pronoun, and I think that's a great start. Really just treat him like a friend, be there for him. Going through that part of your life is never easy, and having people that you can relax and let your guard down around is immensely helpful."

You don't have to have sex with a trans woman who hasn't had SRS. You don't have to have sex with anyone at all.

Start thinking about the body not matching. Now recognise that he's going to be taking steps to make the body match who he really is, and you'll get to see him for who he is.

I may not be as well versed as other people in this sub (I've only just come out a while ago.) but I'd be happy to lend an ear and/or shoulder to cry on."
trans,32p98f,CannibalIowa,2,Wed Apr 15 17:18:32 2015 UTC,Thank you. I will take you up on that. I had no idea how much just admitting this would help. I'm on my way home now. So it will be in the morning I get a mail to you. Thanks again I really need a friend who knows about this right now.
trans,32p98f,CannibalIowa,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:48:36 2015 UTC,No problem :)

trans,32qadt,MissRaffix3,2,Wed Apr 15 21:14:26 2015 UTC,"I liked the article, and I just had one thing to say. Some TERFs will include transmen, but the base idea of what TERFs think exclude them too.  I read it somewhere on here with someone's dumbed down version of thier ideas, and pretty much they said, ""TERFs believe that trans women are just men trying to get into women's bathrooms to rape them, and transmen are just betrayers of all the 'cisters'.""  Just thought I'd mention that, but yeah the article was good over all. I'd like to be able to help with talking about it, but I cannot bring myself in front of a camera, nor can I talk into a microphone until I'm further along in my transition."
trans,32qadt,alawner,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:03:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading the article! :) And no problem, I totally understand your concerns."
trans,32qadt,letterstosnapdragon,-8,Thu Apr 16 16:28:28 2015 UTC,"Reading that article, I'm amazed by the weird collegy/ivory tower bubble these people live in. Seriously, the people you quote have absolutely zero impact on the world. They preach to their ivory tower choirs, they probably do spoken word poetry attended by three people and they have more word definitions then they have sense.   It's a stupid debate between groups of equally self-absorbed, equally circle-jerking, equally useless people. Ugh. College. Ugh, ""intellectuals."" Stupid liberal arts majors. If your college degree isn't math or science, you're wasting your time with this nonsense. No future job will ever draw from what you're ""learning"" or from anything in a university situation where you interact with the type of individuals you quote in this article."
trans,32qadt,sesamee,4,Thu Apr 16 00:22:18 2015 UTC,"Weirdly out-of-proportion angry rant which sounds unfairly like it's directed at OP, who by all accounts has written a decent summary of the current interplay between the dying breed of trans-exclusionary feminists and everyone else. To be honest you sound as irrationally angry as the TERFs and are as strident as they in your view that everything is a waste of time except science. Which it isn't."
trans,32qadt,Cass_Griffin,3,Thu Apr 16 11:10:31 2015 UTC,"You're a pretty terrible STEM student if you think science has all the answers, and there isn't a place in the world for people with different sorts of knowledge. Not to mention a closed-minded person in general."
trans,32qadt,letterstosnapdragon,5,Thu Apr 16 14:54:05 2015 UTC,"Uhm... okay. Sorry but if you weren't interested in participating and just decided to comment to bash my article and major choice, I'd rather not hear from you."
trans,32ov05,peaceatrebor,3,Wed Apr 15 14:55:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, it sounds like you are already being an incredibly supportive sibling. Do not underestimate how much you have helped J already just by accepting them and being there for them to talk to.   It sounds like the biggest obstacle for J is their home situation. Is there any way that you can help them with that? Maybe support them in moving out/finding somewhere else to live? Could they stay with you, even for a short time?"
trans,32ov05,wkpaccount,2,Wed Apr 15 15:21:39 2015 UTC,"thank you so much.   In theory, they could probably live with me in my apartment for the next year/ until they graduate. That plan would mean me taking a break from school and working full time until they graduate high school to eliminate all financial reliance on my parents. I would help J figure out a dependency override for college if they want to go, and parents could be out of the situation. That's hypothetically doable.   In practice, our parents don't see me as a credible, responsible adult, and have done their best to make the case to others that I am not (meaning if CPS does actually decide to take J away from parents, he probably wouldn't go to me). Another complicated thing is that I am still financially dependent on my parents for things like rent and tuition.  I am really uncomfortable with that type of dependence, because they use it as a tool of manipulation. But I know that I couldn't afford rent, food, utilities, and medically necessary things like therapy for me and J/ potentially hormones for J on my own income.  In this case, any time J stays with me would have to be passed off as ""visiting their older sister"" and probably would never be more than a few days at a time. Thankfully, I live within 3 hours, so transportation for a ""visit"" would be pretty inexpensive. The issue is getting our parents to let J visit me at all."
trans,32ov05,2war0,2,Wed Apr 15 16:02:57 2015 UTC,I would suggest looking in your local area for trans/lgbt meetup/support groups! Then if possible I would see if you could get J a part time job at Starbucks! They are extremely trans friendly and they offer insurance for part time partners that cover horomones and surgery! They could also help J with college if that is a concern as well!
trans,32ov05,Carnage32x,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:06:15 2015 UTC,"this is a great idea. I'll look into it- ! I know there's a Pride group for our city that is very well-established but I'm not sure how they are on trans issues. and the Starbucks tip is great, thanks!"
trans,32ns7p,pleasepeace2,1 point,Wed Apr 15 07:09:31 2015 UTC,My congrats to Charin Davenport -- In one year she's done an amount of trans activism that many of us take a lifetime to do. Trans people in Michigan are lucky to have her.
trans,32jgw7,pleasepeace2,14,Tue Apr 14 07:47:53 2015 UTC,Wear a frilly dress but don't shave or try and look feminine. Then put your self in a position when you are visible customers. If anyone ask say your boss is making you. Is this what the company wants a man in a dress interacting with customers?
trans,32jgw7,lisa_lionheart,2,Tue Apr 14 16:59:26 2015 UTC,"I think the photo was newer, and the incident may have been pre-HRT for him. But in the current scenario, post- or mid- medical transition, that would work well. :P"
trans,32jgw7,gatsbythegerbil,9,Sun Apr 26 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"The company said if he gets surgery showing ""visible results"", they may rehire him. Visible results??!!"
trans,32jgw7,Wannabkate,9,Tue Apr 14 07:48:03 2015 UTC,This is exactly why we need federal protections.
trans,32jgw7,ImKira,5,Tue Apr 14 08:54:52 2015 UTC,"When I spoke to the eeoc, they said that we do have federal protection,  if the employer meets the size criteria.    -Kira"
trans,32jgw7,GorgonGirl,7,Tue Apr 14 15:15:53 2015 UTC,"Surgery? He's a man, so he already looks like a man. He doesn't need any sort of surgery he doesn't want. Also, what fucking place has a separate dress code based on gender, holy fuck."
trans,32jgw7,gatsbythegerbil,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"Some restaurants and such want their employees to dress formally, which may at some locations result in specific codes - dresses or suits. If you ask me, that should be the choice every employee gets, and be given the code on each. ""These are the requirements for suits, these are the requirements for dresses""."
trans,32jgw7,GorgonGirl,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"Okay but those options should be available to everyone, not just based on a person's gender."
