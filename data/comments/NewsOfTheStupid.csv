Flip this situation around - if a black guy drove through one of these back-woods Louisiana towns flying a black panther flag out of his vehicle - what do you think would happen?

Ethics are always going to be the rulebook that the individual chooses to live by.  You act as if there are only two options: Old & archaic or New and Enlightened.   This isn't the case, and you know that.  Three atheists will have as different ethics and three 'goat herders from 2000 years ago'.  Sure, the goat herders are more likely to agree with each other, and the atheists from 2015 are more likely to agree with each other, but they are all going to have different ethics.    Being different is okay!  Stop trying to be the thought police.  This is a perfect example of thinking vs doing.  You can think that the black guy next door is inferior and still treat him with outward respect.  These people have ethics that you and I disagree with, but rather than use their office to try and discriminate,  they chose to find other employment that wouldn't violate their ethics.

The specific passage is 1 Corinthians 6:9-10. So although the level of aggressiveness in the prohibition has changed, the prohibition itself has not.

That said, please note that refusal to participate in any action that would be tantamount to supporting or condoning homosexuality is not abusing or mistreating the homosexual, although some would have you think it is.   Christians are not authorized to condemn anyone for their behavior, but are required to avoid the behavior itself. (See also, ""hate the sin, not the sinner."" Or, consider the difference between tolerance and acceptance - you can tolerate something without accepting it.) So, technically, quitting their jobs as a demonstration of avoidance of supporting or condoning behavior they find unacceptable is probably the most correct course of action."

NewsOfTheStupid,3bv2bb,Velzevul666,2,Thu Jul 2 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"Typically, the alcohol is gelatinized before being breaded and fried. In some preparations it liquifies again during the frying process to produce a ravioli that squirts hot booze into your mouth when you bite it. Naturally you need to eat them quickly before the alcohol seeps out.  In other preparations you're eating a fried dough of some kind that's been soaked in the drink.  Ultimately, the goal is to have at least SOME booze flavored liquid in the mouth so you can convince people they're eating ""fried alcohol"" instead of ""fried alcohol soaked dough.""

NewsOfTheStupid,3beefx,Jaggs0,-1,Sun Jun 28 18:41:32 2015 UTC,And I'm saying he suspiciously became an outspoken defender of gay marriage AFTER he was fired.  He also want fired for that.   He wasn't worth an 8th year minimum salary when he was only kicking a couple yards farther than a nameless rookie.     He lost his lawsuit over it.   He's a slime
NewsOfTheStupid,3beefx,ClintHammer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"from wikipedia   On May 6, 2013, Kluwe was released by the Minnesota Vikings.   his lawsuit was started a year later.  edit: and after googling for the results of that lawsuit, he didnt lose it.  they settled out of court.  and even though you claim he is slime, he was not paid a dime in the deal.  all the money was donated to various LGBT charities.   Under the deal, the Vikings will donate an undisclosed sum of money to five gay rights-related charities over the next five years. Kluwe said he won’t receive any money as part of the settlement.    source:  http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/chris-kluwe-vikings-reach-settlement-avoid-lawsuit-article-1.1909255  sounds like a real scumbag to me /sarcasm."

People around here cut him a lot of slack because he's a redditor  http://www.bustle.com/articles/11756-why-chris-kluwes-deadspin-article-should-be-viewed-with-caution
NewsOfTheStupid,3beefx,ClintHammer,2,Mon Jun 29 06:04:53 2015 UTC,"if you settle out of court then there was no actual court case.  you settle out of court if you think you are going to lose a court case or do not want to spend the money to defend yourself or lose face yourself (IE the vikings).  so they settled for one of two reasons.  first there was some proof that kluwe was right.  or they did not want what was found in the investigation made public to make them not look bad.  no NFL team is in the business of giving away free money.  if their teams image was not going to be hurt and they would win the case they would not have settled.  also that article you linked had nothing to do with the actual case because it was written 8 months before they settled.  all that article said was to take what the deadspin article (that was written by kluwe) with a grain of salt.    do i think kluwe was cut because of the things he said, yeah partly.  do i think it was the main reason, not a chance.  as you said he was gonna get veteran min.  there is always a younger player to get to play that position for cheaper.  teams do not like guys with big mouths.  i remember after a dez bryant meltdown a year or two ago michael strahan going off about it. now this is me paraphrasing it:   he said no one likes guys like that, not the players, not the coaches, not the management.  they will only tolerate it if you are one of the best at what you do.  the second you dont perform as a top tier player, you are gone.  no one is gonna miss you."

The problem with that idea, is that constitution, is the constitution has a lot of other crap in it. Like how to AMEND the constitution and who gets finally say on what is constitution.(which you can override with an amendment)  Now.. this amendment process, honors the people like you who since the beginning of this country have screamed states rights. ITs actually honors the 10th amendment. Why? because amendments have to be ratified by 3/4ths of the states  level legislators AS well as pass the federal senate and house..  So the states, Under the protection of the 10th amendment agreed to the equal protection clause in the 14th amendment. This is where the fed doesnt get any powers not delegated to it. WEll the states gave the fed the power over ""equal protection"". The supreme court who decides what they meant, says its their jurisdiction and its their power to actually decide if its their jurisdiction via the constitution.  your tenth amendment rights were protected under both rulings. You have the right to over rule EITHER.. EITHER.. we can make black people slaves again.. NO SHIT.(well besides black people might not like that idea much) but it would take an amendment to the constitution. and 3/4th of the states to give the power back to the states. Now it is actually possible for scotus to find a new amendment unconstitutional but that is an untested legal theory as to what would actually happen in that case.  but yeah, just make an amendment saying states have the sole power to define marriage, and get 3/4s of the countries statehouse to agree."

My feelings on this particular ruling aside, I have no respect for a ruling body that doesn't follow the rules it sets.  How can we trust them if they don't?  They're liars, and anything they say they can just sweep aside if we don't hold them accountable.  Your argument works, I suppose, but it's really stretching it.

Come on, you've got to know they had more common sense than that!!  The problem with what you're saying there is that rape is much more difficult to prove than murder. In the case of murder, you've got a dead body and you've got to find the cause. But in the case of rape, you've got a case of he-said, she-said. She might say, ""I was raped"" but he might say, ""We were getting a little rough but she said she liked it at the time"" and how do you know which is telling the truth?  So the law of Moses just ends up treating fornication the same as rape in some ways. Just like how our own laws define cases of ""statutory rape"" even when neither party thinks it was rape. That's actually a little bit more absurd from a more objective point of view IMO."

Granted, the whole ""how to get into heaven"" aspect changed thanks to the crucifixion. But how did god change in any of this?

The old covenant laws are NOT the same as the new covenant laws. PERIOD. People were executed for gathering wood on the Sabbath before Christ. That simply was NOT the case after Jesus Christ ""died for our sins"".   In the New Testament epistles there are only 2 references to the Sabbath (Col.2:16; Heb.4:4), both these passages the apostle Paul clearly explains that this day is not a required day to be observed by Christians. To the Hebrews in the Old Covenant they were under obligation, in the New Covenant neither Jews nor Gentiles are. There is no command after the death and resurrection for the Church to keep the Sabbath as an obligation to Christ.   https://www.gci.org/law/oldandnew  Some laws and protocols DID change after Christ and the message was most certainly more about ""love and peace"" rather than ""obey or burn in hell""  I don't know God at all. I can just apply context like an objective human being and don't have this underlining hateful, blinding bias against religion like everyone else on here even though I'm not religious.

It's indicative of someone who has not received contextual religious education because it's not true.  Like I said before...God didn't think anyone who wasn't a Jew was worth saving before Christ. That and 603 other laws changed (in regards to his feelings in terms of how the world should be governed). Why are you glossing over that? That's huge. God determined every non-jew automatically goes to hell. I'd say that's a significant change.  Personal commentary: The ""marketing team"" decided that was a bit too exclusionary if they wanted their religion to grow and tweaked it to include everyone.  I have provided many links providing specific details explaining how exactly he changed. Small subtle changes and huge philosophical altering ones....I'm not dodging anything. You haven't addressed any of the changes I've brought up.   A change in the law is a change in God himself. How exactly does God govern? Through the laws he forces us to follow. A change in God's law is a change in God...how else would that change be manifested?  Yes, like every other region there is an ultimate punishment for not converting. That won't ever change...you can't be a sinner and get into heaven. Pretty basic. But that doesn't mean Palin would have been stoned like you are suggesting. Jesus Christ forgave a prostitute.

NewsOfTheStupid,3b5l6a,Minifig81,3,Fri Jun 26 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"I have two opposing thoughts on this.   I am very old and when I was young there was no safe and reliable form of birth control. The pill was in it's infancy and carried a known high risk of thrombosis, condoms were somewhat much less reliable than today (as well as providing all the sensitivity of a gardening glove). Condoms were so unreliable at the time that I happen to know that my wife was a 'condom baby'.  In short, the only safe sex when I was young WAS abstinence and, therefore, that is what my wife and I did (or didn't do). I am not going to say it was easy - it was bloody difficult - but it was possible because we were committed to each other and had little choice.    On the other side of the coin - science, technology & medicine have now provided us with a wealth of safe and reliable birth control methods that allow people to enjoy sex without the worry of unplanned pregnancy so why would you not make use of that. I managed 3 years of abstinence before my wife and I got married so, at the time, it was possible because there was no responsible alternative - but I would have given my eye teeth for the options available today so we did not have to hold back and limit our enjoyment of each other for those 3 years.   People today are so lucky in the options available and those that choose not to (even though it IS possible) are just depriving themselves for no real reason.  Edit: I am reminded that, for the first 13 years after the pill was introduced in Britain in 1961, doctors were technically only allowed to prescribe it for married women. Of course there were some that did not rigidly follow that guideline but it was by no means routine for single women to be able to get access to it."
