StudentLoans,3e7gzj,ANGR1ST,4,Wed Jul 22 15:40:29 2015 UTC,"How long was she in school? That $65k could easily have been $110k by the time she entered repayment.  What are the actual rates? And what is her repayment plan? If she was on an income based or extended plan, she may not have made any headway for years."
StudentLoans,3e7gzj,xtrexjpsouz,3,Wed Jul 22 15:50:31 2015 UTC,"First things first, note that most student loans start accruing interest immediately after disbursement... so if your wife was in school for a really long time (which it sounds like she was), she probably racked up a lot of extra interest during that time. So while the original balance may have been only $65,000, it was probably quite a bit higher than that when she entered repayment.   Over the course of 15-18 years, she has paid back $69,000 but STILL has $58,000 remaining on her loan.   Basic math tells me your wife has not actually been making payments consistently for 15-18 years. $69,000 / $700 / 12 = about 8 years worth of payments. You said your wife hasn't been a student since 1998, so what exactly happened in the last 17 years that caused her to keep stopping payment? Was she unemployed? Did she ever default on the debt? Or maybe she's on an income-driven plan where the payments were much lower for the first several years and just recently increased to $700?  Given how much interest accrued and capitalized over the years, I'm kind of surprised your wife is only paying $700 per month at this point. Can you find out what type of repayment plan she is on? If she wants to make more progress and pay less interest, she really needs to start paying significantly more than the minimums. Refinancing might be an option as well but you didn't actually mention the interest rate(s) on her existing debt so it's impossible for us to say if that would actually be worthwhile.  Edited for clarity"

StudentLoans,3e7598,ntakiri,2,Wed Jul 22 13:55:49 2015 UTC,It usually takes a few weeks for an IBR/PAYE application to fully process. Your loan servicer will most likely put you into administrative forbearance during this time so you don't have to worry about missing a payment while it's processing (assuming you're already in repayment).
StudentLoans,3e7jur,carecher,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:46:24 2015 UTC,"Probably not. If it was a small amount, you might be able to qualify for a decent interest rate on your own... but $30K is a lot of debt for one school year, especially if that's in addition to federal loans."
StudentLoans,3e7hvo,maddenite,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"Generally, you should target extra payments to the loan with the highest interest rate - so the 2013 loan.  With that said, I'm a little concerned that (based on the interest rates) none of these loans appear to be federal. Is that correct? If so, why have you been skipping your federal loan options? The current interest rate on Stafford loans for undergraduate students is only 4.29% which is quite a bit lower than any of the rates you have right now."
StudentLoans,3e665c,Dgkiller,2,Wed Jul 22 06:49:51 2015 UTC,"The loan provider wont' be able to help. It's financial aid you need to go see - in person would probably be better.  If you didn't get the max in student loans it's not too late for them to increase the amount to pay the bill.  If they did give you the max, ask them about a private loan - many offer them for prior semesters.  Your folks will likely have to cosign but it's a small loan so shouldn't be a big deal.

StudentLoans,3e5429,KiSamehada,3,Wed Jul 22 00:56:03 2015 UTC,"Even with private loans, you're most likely going to need a creditworthy cosigner... so your parents are going to have to be involved one way or another (unless you can find a way to pay out-of-pocket). I suspect they would be more comfortable with this than a Parent PLUS loan since both of your names would be on the private loan and you could theoretically refinance/release the cosigner after you graduate. Parent PLUS loans have to stay with the parent."
StudentLoans,3e5429,xtrexjpsouz,2,Wed Jul 22 01:18:39 2015 UTC,Also tell your folks that co-signing and plus loans affect their credit in exactly the same way - particularly their debt to income ratio.  Co-signing means equally liable for the debt.
StudentLoans,3e5429,Betsy514,2,Wed Jul 22 13:54:59 2015 UTC,"Do what you can to convince them that PLUS loans are a better option. Federal Loans are so much more flexible with repayment programs and interest rates than private loans, and if you find yourself in trouble down the road and can't find a job that will let you make your payments, private lenders will be less willing to work with you - whereas federal loans have income based programs that are very easy to switch into. Try explaining this to your parents so they realize the trouble they are saving you.  I have an obnoxious amount of debt in PLUS loans in both of my parents names, and I will be paying it back 100%. The loans stay current while in school and during the grace period, and if anything itll be good for them to have on time payments on their credit report. I've also taken out an additional Accidental D&D life insurance policy in the amount of the loans and listed them as the beneficiaries in the case where something would happen to me so that they would be able to pay the loans off."
StudentLoans,3e5wye,thacarterxciv,6,Wed Jul 22 05:07:27 2015 UTC,"basically no credit history  It'll definitely be at a better rate than any dealership could offer.   Wouldn't bet on that.   Would it be illegal to take out a private student loan for this along with money I need for college expenses?   Not exactly ""illegal"", but it is against the terms of the loan agreement. You're not supposed to use the loans for that.  If it's really your first car, don't borrow for it. Buy cheap and cash, even if it's a bit of a beater."
StudentLoans,3e5wye,ANGR1ST,2,Wed Jul 22 06:43:42 2015 UTC,Why do you think a private student loan would have a better interest rate than a car loan? Car loans are secured; student loans are not. Both may require a cosigner if you truly have no credit history.
StudentLoans,3e5wye,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:23:22 2015 UTC,"This is a horrible idea.  Firstly, as mentioned by /u/ANGR1ST, this goes against the terms of any educational loan agreement. If somehow you were discovered, your lender could demand that your loan be paid in full immediately.   Secondly, unless you or a cosigner have the most amazing credit ever, there is no way that you are going to be approved for a private loan that has a better interest rate than a car loans. Most car loans have rates of anywhere from 2-5%.   Thirdly, you would begin accruing interest on that loan immediately. So not only would you have a loan with a (likely) higher interest rate than a car loan, you would have a whole year's worth of accrued interest to pay back before you even bought a car!  And finally, it is very difficult to discharge a student loan in bankruptcy. If you default on a car loan or try and declare bankruptcy, the bank will just take your car. If you do the same on a student loan, they will chase you forever,   DON'T DO THIS. SAVE UP AND BUY A USED CAR LIKE EVERY OTHER BROKE RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATE."

StudentLoans,3e3eg2,sillygoldfish,6,Tue Jul 21 17:29:33 2015 UTC,"6.8% really isn't that high. Private loans can be significantly worse.  You should keep a couple of months worth expenses in your bank accounts for emergencies. Then pay whatever you can toward the highest interest rate loans. You don't want to drain your savings and then run into an unexpected expense. Might also need cash on hand to re-locate for your ""real"" job when you find it (I assume you didn't go to school to be a waitress)."

Although I have $50k in the bank, I'm not touching it because my company is going through a restructure and I may get fired any day now. I have a family to feed and a mortgage. If I was single and had no responsibilities, I would pay it all off."
StudentLoans,3e3eg2,____DEADPOOL_______,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely wouldn't wipe out my entire savings account just to pay off a couple of 6.8% loans... but if you can afford to pay them early, you should absolutely do that.  Also I know you haven't entered repayment yet, but when you do, you should consider signing up for auto-debit through your loan servicer. This will reduce all of your interest rates by 0.25% and you can still make extra payments manually whenever you want. It's not a huge difference, but you might as well take advantage of the discount when it's available."
StudentLoans,3e3eg2,xtrexjpsouz,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts on it:  -=The numbers=-   An 6.8% loan ""basically"" doubles every 10 years if left alone calculator.  Ask your loan company for an amortization calendar/schedule of the loan so you can see what the loan will look like in say 10 years using different amounts of payment. Ie  minimum vs. interest only vs. paying double (& and whatever strategy you want to illustrate). This will give you a clearer picture to help you determine your payment strategy    -=Strategy=-   Make sure you have an Emergency Fund that has at least 6 months of living expenses saved up at your current expenses. Make sure the place you have these funds is easily accessible and there is no penalty for taking out the money (ie. Savings, Checkings, Short Terms CDs, Bonds, and other liquid assets) Once I have my Emergency Fund set up I would aggressively start paying off Loan A (the smaller loan) while paying the normal payment for Loan B (the larger loan). Make sure to have enough money available if you need to relocate to find a better job. I'd generally pay off as much as I can comfortably.   Overall, there are many strategies you can employ. Its hard to say without knowing the amt of your loans, your salary, your future salary potential, and a lot of other junk. A ~7% loan isnt so bad, if you have any credit card debt id pay that off first. Also remember if you work for govt some programs have a loan forgiveness benefit."

The other way to have the payment covered is to ask for graduated repayment after your August bill comes out.

Also what do you mean by huge tax burden?"
StudentLoans,3e0iww,Betsy514,2,Tue Jul 21 11:43:13 2015 UTC,"Any loan forgiven under income-based repayment is counted as income in the year it is forgiven, so you will pay taxes on it. The only exception is for public service loan forgiveness, which is not taxable."
StudentLoans,3e0iww,milliondollarglasses,3,Tue Jul 21 12:49:34 2015 UTC,"At that income level IBR probably won't make much of a difference anyway, they don't consider private loan payments."

Out of curiosity what degree did you earn and what lead to you taking out those loans? A 64k salary most likely doesn't seem much, and I don't know if you have gotten to this point yet, but you need to figure out a bare bones budget, and then find some sacrifices that you are willing to make.

They're going to know the most about the options that are specifically available to you.   The Federal loan program has a lot of good repayment options and protections, and is generally better than saving a few percent with a Private loan."
StudentLoans,3e1caw,ANGR1ST,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"Paying for college isn't an easy thing, but there are things like the FAFSA giving out grants and 0% and low % interests that are a whole lot better than regular loans.   There is no such thing as a 0% interest student loan at the federal level. The current interest rate on federal student loans is 4.29%. Some loans are interest-free (subsidized) while you're in school, but they start accruing interest at the full rate after you graduate. Also, federal loans have origination fees so they're never really ""free"" even if you pay them off before interest starts accruing.  I'm not really familiar with the Texas-specific options you mentioned but in addition to scholarships, grants, and federal loans you could work part-time while you're in school to cut down on the amount you have to borrow. If your school is close to home, I would also suggest continuing to live with your parents if possible."
StudentLoans,3e1caw,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:45 2015 UTC,There are some small 0% loans actually - usually state-based and aimed at students in financial need. The one I'm most familiar with is in MA:  http://www.mass.edu/osfa/programs/nointerest.asp

StudentLoans,3e04u4,rob206,3,Mon Jul 20 22:53:43 2015 UTC,"After my scholarship and the federal direct sub and unsub loan that were offered as financial aid along with my scholarship, we still owe 13k for the first semester due in under a month.   Holy cow, how much does this school cost that you still owe $13K per semester after scholarships and federal loans? Are you sure this degree is going to be worth the cost? If I'm understanding your post correctly, we're talking about $31K per year in debt... or about $125K total by the time you graduate (not including capitalized interest).   We need some sort of loan, is there anyway to take out another government loan because I hear thats the best way to go about it or do we need to use a private loan because the loans offered with the federal sub and unsub are all we are going to get.   Yes, the alternative to private loans for undergraduate students is a Parent PLUS loan. These are federal loans made in a parent's name. Different schools may have slightly different procedures for requesting this type of loan, so I would suggest talking to your financial aid office to find out what your next step would be."
StudentLoans,3e04u4,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have pretty good grades and wasn't really sure about the money but this was one of only options we could afford out of the schools I applied/accepted to. Now it seems I should have applied to some schools where I could have received a full ride or close to it. The school is about 42k if I remember correctly and thats partly because I am out of state and it would be cheaper if I lived in that state. Also, the federal loans offered did not give much only about $5500. My parents seem to be okay with paying for most of it as they don't see the private loan to be a big deal but after reading a bunch of information it seems like everything says they are a bad idea. I am just trying to help look out for them because I don't want them to be screwed at my expense. Would the Parent Plus loan be a better option or the private loan?"
StudentLoans,3e04u4,xtrexjpsouz,4,Tue Jul 21 00:30:45 2015 UTC,"Parent PLUS loans aren't universally better or worse than private loans. They come with more flexible repayment options (like other federal loans) but have relatively high origination fees and interest rates. IIRC the current interest rate on PLUS loans is 6.41% (fixed) which isn't too bad, but they've been as high as 7.9% in past years. You may want to try applying for a private loan and seeing what kind of rate you are offered based on your parents' credit.  With that in mind, I really think going to an out-of-state school for all four years is a mistake. Your first two years are probably going to be mostly liberal arts credits that you can literally take anywhere. Regardless of how generous and/or well-off your parents may be, paying $42K per year (or even $31K per year) for these types of classes is a colossal waste of money."

I don't even know how I would go about switching schools at this point as I've already paid the deposit and been to orientation and all the likes. it is kinda late at this point. However, this school is well rated in the department I am going to school for and offer a program to stronger students in that field that allow them to get their masters degree with only one additional year after undergrad and it is tuition free so that was also something I was looking at."

Also, just a heads-up: The ""forgiveness"" these companies advertise is in no way guaranteed. IBR/PAYE forgiveness only kicks in after you have made 20-25 years of income-based payments... and the forgiven balance may be taxable. If you can afford to pay back your debt sooner than that, I highly recommend doing so."

I was able to get a loan from Discover without a cosigner at 8%. Year before that I needed my dad to cosign (he has excellent credit+income) a citizens Bank loan and was given 10.75%. So I think you should be able to get a loan by yourself at a good rate. Unless lending standards have tightened in the last 3 years.

Unpaid interest generally does not capitalize while you're on IBR until/unless you no longer demonstrate partial financial hardship (the point where the standard 10-year payments are less than 15% of your discretionary income).  Also note that the government will pay any interest the monthly minimums don't cover on your subsidized loans for up to three years... so I definitely wouldn't pay anything extra on those for a while.   I have been paying their suggested amount, because I am currently paying off my car aggressively, which represents the highest interest on my debt. Is this a bad plan and will I get killed by student loan interest?   If your car loan has a higher interest rate than the student loans, by all means, pay that down first. Once the car loan is paid off, you can shift your focus back to the student loans."

StudentLoans,3dyomf,salem85,5,Mon Jul 20 16:42:21 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you may be confusing federal consolidation and private refinancing.   I have heard that consolidating is not beneficial because it will not allow me to pay off 1 at a time, thus decreasing the highest interest rate and could raise my overall interest rate.   This is federal consolidation. Federal consolidation generally does not make your loans any cheaper; all they do is average your existing rates together and round up to the nearest 1/8th of a percent. So if anything, this would actually increase your overall rate due to rounding... in addition to preventing you from paying off the higher-interest loans early (avalanche method).   On the flip side I have also heard that consolidation will decrease my overall monthly bill and thus allow me to pay off faster.   This sounds like private refinancing. If you have a solid income and good credit, you may be able to refinance your debt through a private lender at a lower interest rate. However, given how much you owe ($95K) I doubt this is going to be an option unless your salary is well into six figures. Doing this would also strip you of all the flexible repayment and forgiveness options available on your federal student loans."

OP can choose to refinance only the private loans so they can keep the federal benefits. I owe $95K as well and at $65K yearly salary was able to refinance my private loans with Citizens Bank.

This doesn't generally do much these days (it used to matter more). Don't bother with this.  You can get a private consolidation loan (SoFi, for example, or Citizens, offer these). If you have very good credit you can get a low rate on these.  BUT if you consolidate your federal loans into a private loan, you lose all your federal loan benefits - deferment, forbearance, payment plans, etc.  In most cases, it's best to leave your federal loans in the federal program, and explore consolidation for just the private loans to see if you can get a better rate."

Unless you are going to Carnegie Mellon, MIT, etc. There isn't a 'Premier CS school' in the country and employers in this field don't care about the name of your school.  You may also want to consider it because even if you could pay the large loan back, it would definitely be at least 10yrs of paying the minimum payment along with the woes of interest.

If living at home saves you money in the long run, between studying and working, you probably won't ever see your parents. If there's bigger issues at home, you need to sit down with your parents and talk with them about your expectations and what they expect from you, and if they say ""this is our house and you will do what I say,"" maybe offer to pay them to rent your room. It'll be significantly cheaper than living in an apartment (most likely). Try to not take on a lot of loans, and think about how later on you'll be ~$18,000 less in debt (that's only housing. I'm not sure what your loan situation is for tuition.) for budgeting and loan repayment stuff, I am going to link you to /r/personalfinance, it's much more active and helpful. Best of luck!

StudentLoans,3dwini,adorablenutellakitty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:27 2015 UTC,"When comparing, make sure to count in rent, utilities, food, renter's insurance, and any other expenses that you'd need to cover while living alone, as opposed to living with your parents, I'm not sure what you'd need to cover if you were living with them!"
StudentLoans,3dwini,hypertoaster,4,Tue Jul 21 01:07:49 2015 UTC,"Start out living with the folks. If those dreams of bridge jumping get worse, you can always move out later.  But seriously, if it's between getting loans for housing or living at home...Live at home. It's basically wasted money otherwise. Also in my experience, I really didn't spend a lot of time ""at home"" while going to school. Between actual classes, studying (library and cafes) and working, there's not a lot of downtime. I crashed at friend's houses a lot too. If you're essentially just going to need a bed to sleep in, might as well get it for free!"
StudentLoans,3dwini,Kaggr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:33:29 2015 UTC,"I second /u/hypertoaster's suggestion. It's not like you'll be stuck there forever if you try living with your parents and it doesn't work out, and that gives you time to work part time and save money for when you do move out. Is not feeling a little silly for doing what a lot of other invidivuals your age worth $20k+ over the long run? I would at least give it a shot."
StudentLoans,3dwini,ANGR1ST,4,Mon Jul 20 14:39:50 2015 UTC,"the program that I'm in has a 100% employment rate for its graduates   Yea ... don't believe that.   My problem is that I feel like such a loser living with my parents in my late twenties.   Why? Plenty of people live with their parents for a while, especially while in school. If people are giving you attitude about it, tell them to go fuck themselves. You shouldn't be making decisions based on what other people think of your life situation.  It really doesn't matter what people borrowed money for during school. The successful ones are the ones that borrowed an amount that was reasonable for their career path. A lot of people use the ""borrow less than one year's expected salary"" rule of thumb. But there's a bit more to it than that.  Borrowing say $600/mo for 3 years is going to rack up $21,600 in addition to whatever you're borrowing for tuition.  Without knowing more about your degree plans, tuition, and projected salary it's hard to say how difficult it'll be to deal with your loans and if you'll end up ""drowning"". Every $10k you borrow is goign to cost you something like $100-120/mo on a 10 year repayment plan.  I'd personally try to live at home if possible. Do it for the first year and see how it goes."

You will thank yourself later for your frugality. How much does rent near the school cost? How much does commuting cost? Stay and study in the school library until you need to go home to sleep if need be. Also, unless you are at an ivy for grad school, and even then, no school has 100% employment IN THE FIELD. They might be employed, but ere is a huge difference between any job and one you went to school for."

How close do your parents live to the school or the part of town your classmates will live in?  Is networking a  key side benefit of your program?  There's nothing wrong with living with your parents to save money.  In 4 years, you might really regret choosing to live on your own out of some sense of ""coolness.""    With that said, if you are getting a degree such as a MBA from a top 20 program and networking is an important part of the value, it may be worth the extra loans to live next to your classmates and build more connections / camaraderie.  Those extra dinners and nights out are meaningful.  And study groups will be much easier.  If it's a PHD in a field where networking with classmates means little and there's a lot of self study outside of classroom and labs, then save the cash."

StudentLoans,3dvdk5,hypertoaster,3,Sun Jul 19 21:01:26 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I fully understand the situation. Don't wait until you have enough money to make a double payment. Interest accrues daily so it's always better to make extra payments as soon as the money is available.
StudentLoans,3dvdk5,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:07:50 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry for the lack of clarity. I'm making regular monthly payments (above the minimum at that), and in addition to that, I've been saving up over the course of the year to make an additional payment in the month of September. General advice around the subreddit is that this is a good thing to do, so I've been saving up for it. Now that I'm getting close to the time where I can make that additional payment, I've discovered that my remaining outstanding accrued borrower interest (the amount that I'm carrying month to month, rather than the amount that gets paid off with my regular monthly payments) is pretty close to the amount I was planning on using for that second monthly payment.  I'm trying to determine if it would make more sense to put that money toward that outstanding interest so going forward a significantly larger percentage of my monthly payment on that loan goes toward the principle, or if I should just go forward with making a second monthly payment so more money gets applied to the principle across all of my loans."
StudentLoans,3dvdk5,nitemareangel4j0,3,Sun Jul 19 23:35:53 2015 UTC,"Less principal = less interest accruing. It always makes sense to pay down the highest interest loan(s) in declining order of interest rates, and bite into as much principal as you can afford."

It is good to save up to make an extra payment, sure, but why wait until September? Instead of putting money aside every month to go into this ""September payment"" fund, just use what you have saved to make a payment today, and use the amount you would be saving every month to just make a smaller payment every month.  Further, if you're carrying more interest than your monthly payment covers, the extra payment will be going towards that interest anyway."

Private loans are credit based.  if you aren't credit worthy enough you will need a cosigner and even then they may still deny you.   It's all about your creditworthiness.

StudentLoans,3dog9a,teachmemetric,3,Fri Jul 17 22:59:30 2015 UTC,"According to the draft rules of REPAYE, yes:  REPAYE Draft Rules (Page 16, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-07-09/pdf/2015-16623.pdf):   Under proposed § 685.209(c)(5)(ii)(A), a borrower would qualify for forgiveness after 20 years if the loans being repaid under the REPAYE plan include only loans the borrower received to pay for undergraduate study or a consolidation loan that repaid only loans the borrower received to pay for undergraduate study.   Under proposed § 685.209(c)(5)(ii)(B), a borrower would qualify for forgiveness after 25 years if the loans being repaid under the REPAYE plan include a loan the borrower received to pay for graduate or professional study or a consolidation loan that repaid a loan received to pay for graduate or professional study.  Proposed § 685.209(c)(5)(iv) would define a ‘‘qualifying monthly payment’’ as any payment made under the REPAYE plan, the Pay As You Earn repayment plan under § 685.209(a), the income-contingent repayment plan under § 685.209(b), the income-based repayment plan under § 685.221, or the standard repayment plan with a 10-year repayment period under § 685.208(b), or a payment made under any other Direct Loan repayment plan if the amount of the payment was not less than the amount required under the standard repayment plan with a 10-year repayment period.  The proposed definition of ‘‘qualifying monthly payment’’ would also include any payment made by a borrower under the alternative repayment plan described in proposed § 685.209(c)(4)(vi) and (vii) before the borrower changed to one of the income-contingent repayment plans under § 685.209 or the income-based repayment plan under § 685.221, or any month during which the borrower was not required to make a payment due to receiving an economic hardship deferment.  The proposed regulations would also make conforming changes to the regulations for the Pay As You Earn repayment plan under § 685.209(a), the income-contingent repayment plan under § 685.209(b), and the income-based repayment plan under § 685.221, to provide that a qualifying monthly payment for purposes of loan forgiveness under those plans would include a monthly payment made under the REPAYE plan or a monthly payment made by a borrower under the alternative repayment plan described in proposed § 685.209(c)(4)(vi) and (vii) before the borrower changed to one of the repayment plans under § 685.209 or § 685.221.   There are similar provisions under IBR/PAYE (Income-Driven Repayment FAQ; https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/income-driven-repayment-q-and-a.pdf):   Q28. What does “after 20 or 25 years of qualifying repayment” mean?   This means that you will qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance after you have made the equivalent of 20 or 25 years of qualifying monthly payments, and after at least 20 or 25 years have passed. The number of years is determined as follows:   • 20 years for new borrowers repaying under the IBR Plan   • 20 years for all borrowers under the Pay As You Earn Plan   • 25 years for those repaying under the IBR Plan who are not new borrowers   • 25 years for all borrowers under the ICR Plan   Generally, a qualifying monthly payment for any of the income-driven repayment plans is a payment made under   • any income-driven repayment plan, whether based on your income or the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount;   • the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan; or   • any other repayment plan, if the payment amount is at least equal to what the payment amount would be under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan.   For example, if you began repayment under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan and later changed to one of the income-driven repayment plans, the monthly payments you made under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan will generally count toward the required 20 or 25 years of qualifying monthly payments for the income-driven repayment plan. Similarly, if you were previously in repayment under one income-driven repayment plan and later switched to a different income-driven repayment plan, payments you made under both plans will generally count toward the required years of qualifying monthly payments for the new plan.   Also, any month that you are in an economic hardship deferment generally counts as the equivalent of a qualifying monthly payment for purposes of the income-driven repayment plans. That is, even though you are not required to make payments on your loans during a deferment, any months spent in an economic hardship deferment while you are repaying under an income-driven repayment plan will generally count toward the required 20 or 25 years of qualifying monthly payments. (Note that months spent in any other type of deferment or months spent in forbearance do not count as the equivalent of qualifying monthly payments.)   Depending on the repayment plan, only payments you made after a certain date or months of economic hardship deferment after a certain date may be counted toward the required 20 or 25 years of qualifying monthly payments. For the ICR Plan, payments made under certain other repayment plans (in addition to those listed above) may also count toward the required 25 years of qualifying monthly payments, depending on when you first entered repayment on your loans. Your loan servicer can provide you with more detailed information about these requirements.   IMPORTANT: If 20 or 25 years (as applicable) have passed, but you have not made the equivalent of 20 or 25 years of qualifying monthly payments, you would not yet be eligible to receive forgiveness of any remaining loan balance. The example below explains this.   Example   • You entered repayment under the Pay As You Earn Plan in December 2013.  • To qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance at the end of the 20-year repayment period, you must have made the equivalent of 20 years of qualifying monthly payments (240 qualifying monthly payments) and 20 years must have elapsed.   • In 2017, you receive forbearance for 12 months.   • In 2020, you receive an economic hardship deferment for 12 months.   • After 20 years have elapsed (December 2033), you have made the equivalent of 19 years of qualifying monthly payments (216 monthly payments under the Pay As You Earn Plan, plus 12 months of economic hardship deferment, for a total of 228 qualifying monthly payments). The 12 months of forbearance do not count toward the required 20 years of qualifying monthly payments. Therefore, you would not qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance until after you have made the equivalent of an additional 12 months of qualifying monthly payments."

You're most likely going to have to involve your parents no matter what. The vast majority of students do not qualify for private loans without a creditworthy cosigner. It's hard to say which option would be cheapest (Parent PLUS or private) since private loans are credit-based and can have a wide range of interest rates. You may want to try applying for a private loan and comparing the rates before making a final decision. IIRC the current interest rate on Parent PLUS loans is 6.41% fixed - definitely not as low as the rates on Stafford loans, but still pretty good for unsecured debt."

Private refinances are credit-based and at $9.75/hour you don't even meet the minimum income requirement for most lenders.

There are no prepayment penalties on student loans so you can pay as much as you want.  Even better: If you make a payment on a federal loan within 120 days of disbursement, they'll apply it to the principal and reverse any interest on that balance that may have accrued to date.

StudentLoans,3dn04n,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:12:39 2015 UTC,Yes. Interest accrues daily while you're in school but does not capitalize until the end of your grace period (about 6 months after you graduate).
StudentLoans,3dn04n,whatsinthepithos,3,Sun Jul 19 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"To consolidate the answers below and add some commentary of my own, here's how to figure it out.  Subsidized loans don't accrue interest while you're in school (they won't until after you enter ""repayment""). If you start paying this down while in school, you'll lower your principal, thus lowering the amount you'll have to repay AND the amount you'll have to pay interest on later.  Unsubsidized loans will accrue interest throughout the time you're in school, and then all of this additional cost will ""capitalize"" and be added to your principal once you enter repayment. If you're paying this down while you're in school, you'll likely be making payments that split between principal and interest, depending on how your lender calculates everything. (Usually, payments go toward interest first, and then principal, unless you're making a payment within 120 days of the loan disbursement, which is awesome! Trust me, I did this once, and I was so grateful I did.) It's still a good idea to start repaying in school because you'll be chipping away at the interest you're accruing and ultimately start taking down the principal that will be accruing interest the whole time.   Honestly, I wish I had the foresight to start repaying my loans while in school instead of spending my windfalls on a nice dinner or a couple extra lattes. Future you will be eternally grateful if you can get ahead, even just on interest payments!"

StudentLoans,3dn04n,xtrexjpsouz,2,Mon Jul 20 07:22:34 2015 UTC,Yes. Depending on the timing of everything it might be considered a refund rather than repayment. I don't think there is a big difference between repaying $X at the very start of the repayment period vs. refunding $X right before the repayment period.

You're not saving all that much by paying in a year vs paying in 2 years for example. If anything, I'd stop the aggressive repayment and make sure that I maxed my IRA instead since you can't make up for lost years later."

StudentLoans,3dl7f6,komair,4,Fri Jul 17 05:45:44 2015 UTC,"The best advice to save money in school is to apply for every scholarship you can qualify for. If you get a full ride somewhere with room and board, take that over a partial scholarship elsewhere.  If you do not qualify for any scholarships and are going to be paying out of pocket for everything, for the love of god stay in state. Second, go to a community college for as long as you feasibly can transfer credits from there to a 4 year school. Then choose a 4 year state school that is reasonable and is well known for whatever degree you plan on achieving there. Some schools are better known for engineering or law etc. If you have a healthy relationship with parents, stay home and commute to a school if that is feasible. The ""college experience"" is not worth $50,000-$100,000 in student loan debt.  Now, how to save money in college. Don't live on campus, its outrageously overpriced. Live off campus and split rent with other students or live at home with family. Don't buy a meal plan, its overpriced and the food sucks, by groceries and make your own breakfast/dinner at home and bring a lunch on campus. Don't buy a parking pass unless you have to commute.  If you aren't working part time then you need to be taking 15-18 credit hours worth of classes, if you are barely meeting 12 hours full time as a student you need to be working or very actively involved on campus with things that will boost your resume post graduation."
StudentLoans,3dl7f6,JollyJoshHalo,4,Fri Jul 17 12:50:03 2015 UTC,"If you aren't working part time then you need to be taking 15-18 credit hours worth of classes   Honestly, even at 15-18 credit hours, you should be able to fit in some sort of part-time work if you manage your time effectively. A common example is pizza delivery. You can make decent money doing this one or two nights per week and it won't interfere with your classes at all. You won't be able to go to as many parties... but when you're paying tens of thousands of dollars to go to college, partying should not be a top priority anyway."
StudentLoans,3dl7f6,xtrexjpsouz,3,Fri Jul 17 13:57:49 2015 UTC,I agree if you are a freshmen/sophomore but if you are taking 15-18 hours of junior/senior level courses making $400 bucks being a delivery driver isn't the best use of your time.
StudentLoans,3dl7f6,JollyJoshHalo,2,Fri Jul 17 14:18:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, student loans (like most other types of debt) accrue interest on a daily basis so the longer you stretch out repayment, the more money you will pay overall."

StudentLoans,3dl7f6,aaronsweber,3,Fri Jul 17 14:40:26 2015 UTC,Congrats you are so close to the end goal! I have a very similar story that I hope to share soon. It is so hard making the sacrifice but it is best to get rid of the loans when young so you can do whatever you want in life.  My brief story: I graduated in May 2014 with about 21K(need to confirm) in debt. Started working in August 2014. Loans repayments started in November and all I did for the first two months was pay the minimum. Starting Jan 2015 I started paying whatever I had left over after all other expenses. I've paid $11.5K to this day and I now am just under 10K left! I will also be done in a few months.  Keep going you are almost there!
StudentLoans,3dl7f6,scroogled909,2,Fri Jul 17 11:48:57 2015 UTC,"Story time and life lesson/advice (I apologize for length and formatting). I had a full ride offer from a small college in my area to play sports. Instead of going that route, I decided I wanted to go away to state school and enjoy the freedom of living away. Well in those 4 years I racked up around $35,000 in student loans. However no matter how many times I kick myself for not taking the scholarship (being debt free and playing the sport I love), I remember that the experiences, friends I've made, and life lessons I learned from making that decision are invaluable. I graduated in 2012 with $35,000 in debt, didn't start working until May 2013 and I'm happy to say I will be making my FINAL student loan payment by late September this year. Sure this money could have been invested, used for purchases etc. but never assume your life/career path would be the same if you had chosen either a cheaper school or not going at all. I always look at it as that $35,000 was an investment in itself that will/has already set me up for the financial stability I want when I retire. When you look back on the loan payments when you retire, hopefully you can view them as just a drop in the bucket in comparison to your career earnings and realize it was the best decision you made.  Now moving away from anecdotal advice, this is actual advice for high schoolers that I and everyone else I know have realized. Biggest mistake when going away to school was not taking advantage of everything that is at your disposal.  Work hard for good grades and take Advanced Placement classes for college credits in high school so you can either A. graduate a year early, B. Take less classes per semester so you can focus more on these classes and get better grades (which will set your GPA up better for graduation) and/or C. get a decent scholarship.  Become an RA/do the work study program/be a waiter 1 or 2 days a week. When you become an RA, they pay for your boarding which is a huge portion of your college expenses. I've heard it sucks but once you make friends in college it's not like they will forget about you because you're an RA. Work study is a program that enables you to work part time on campus for minimum wage (drinking money). Or just grab a side job as a bartender/bar back or waiter. Especially in a college town, these jobs will be available somewhere and you can make very good money (for a college student) for a very minimal commitment.   I know there is some things I'm missing and I may add some points later but I hope this helps anyone who reads it. On everything I wrote, the only thing I did was work study and I STILL will be debt free 3 years out of college with a relatively high paying job for my age. I'm fairly confident that if I kept my grades up, took AP classes, took a scholarship, became an RA so I had relatively little debt, that I would probably have close to a $100k a year job with around $40k in the bank and I'm only 24. I'm not necessarily in that position, but I am almost debt free, have $15k in the bank and make enough that by end of year next year I should have around $30k in the bank minimum by the time I turn 26."
StudentLoans,3dl7f6,nb00288,2,Fri Jul 17 13:03:22 2015 UTC,I feel ya. Over a period of a year and a half I paid over 20k towards my loans. Been paying for 4.5 years now. Only 8k left of the original 38k.

I did the same for a while, but now I'm of the mindset that it's amazing I can live off of half my paycheck and still function. Most of my friends are making minimum payments, and after December, all of my money will be my own!   Keep it up!"

StudentLoans,3dnj2y,camel_toesdays,6,Fri Jul 17 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"No.  PAYE (and IBR) is intended to assist borrowers with immediate financial hardship. The idea is not for borrowers to stay on the plan for the full repayment term. If you do not pay back your loans in full by the end of the 20 year PAYE term, the amount that is forgiven is considerable taxable income and must be reported to the IRS. The government is going to get most, if not all, of their money back from you. This could be over the course of repayment or 20 years down the line when you have to scramble to come up with with a huge tax bill."
StudentLoans,3dnj2y,rosythewench,3,Fri Jul 17 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"Like /u/rosythewench said, forgiven student loan balances are treated as taxable income. The more you borrow, the higher your income tax bill will be at the end of repayment.  Edit: Also note that the monthly minimums on PAYE can never go higher than what you would have paid on the standard 10-year plan. Given that you are already earning $50K, I suspect you would end up paying quite a bit more on the larger debt (regardless of the tax implications) because the monthly minimums on $420K in debt won't max out around $450/month like they would on the smaller debt."
StudentLoans,3dncsh,Lastwordss,4,Fri Jul 17 17:54:12 2015 UTC,When did you take out the loan?  Is the loan in default or are you behind on payments?  Why are you seeking a buyout if your loan is not in default?  The buyout deals are usually only offered on extremely old loans or loans that have been in default for a long time (often the loans meet both conditions). In each of these cases the bank has decided that the amount of money they will make in pursuing the loan fully is not worth the time/effort.  The buyout deals may also be offered by debt collectors after extremely lengthy default. Your servicer may have said that they do not make buyout offers because they first pass the loan off to debt collectors. It is actually the debt collectors who then make the buyout offer.  It would also require you having the cash on hand to pay them the amount of the deal.

StudentLoans,3dm6ob,xtrexjpsouz,3,Fri Jul 17 12:03:22 2015 UTC,"Collection fees are charged at a percentage of the outstanding loan balance. I think it's 18.5% but I could be wrong. It may seem exorbitant but that's the price you pay for letting federal loans default. I know you can't go back in time and change what's already been done, but ignoring your debt until it defaulted was 100% your own fault. There's really no good excuse for it. Federal loans come with so many flexible repayment options nowadays; you could have easily signed up for Income Based Repayment or hardship deferment to keep you on track while you were unemployed/underemployed if you just picked up the phone and called your loan servicer."
StudentLoans,3dm6ob,aaronsweber,2,Fri Jul 17 12:12:28 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world, one would think they'd want a lump sum payment, particularly if I could pay it in total immediately (sans fees)...rather than drag it out over years and years just for several thousand more. Oh well, a person can dream."
StudentLoans,3dkhkd,Wheezle_N,3,Fri Jul 17 00:21:21 2015 UTC,"I would suggest talking to someone at the Thai bank. They should be able to advise you on the easiest way to transfer money between accounts.  Another option would be to pay your loans with an international money order but there's a fee for this (in addition to postage) so it's not something you would want to do on a regular basis. Would it be feasible for you to make larger, less frequent payments? The reason I ask is because federal loans actually allow you to do this. It's called ""advancing the due date"" and it allows you to skip monthly payments when you have paid ahead by enough."
StudentLoans,3dkhkd,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jul 17 11:45:12 2015 UTC,"I live in Korea. I transfer from my Korea bank (where i get my paycheck) to the US bank and pay my loans from there. Everyone I know does this.  Edit: If you know anything about bitcoin and you have a place in Thailand to buy them, you can just buy, for example, $300 in bitcoin and send it to your US bitcoin wallet and transfer it to your US bank.

If so, here are a few options to consider:   Cut back on expenses. You didn't say what the $10K includes (is that just for tuition?) but you may be able to reduce your spending on certain things like textbooks, food, transportation and housing. Work part-time and pay as much of the balance out-of-pocket as you can. Again not sure what the $10K includes but if your outstanding tuition balance is only a few thousand dollars, your school might be willing to work out an interest-free payment plan. Apply for a private loan. $10K is not a huge amount of money so it shouldn't be too difficult to qualify with a cosigner. I know you don't really want to involve your parents but you may not have a choice if you want to finish your degree ASAP."

StudentLoans,3djxl6,gizmo22,7,Thu Jul 16 21:40:41 2015 UTC,"You can never be kicked off IBR for making too much money as long as you keep renewing it every year. Your monthly payment will just increase to the equivalent of the 10-year standard plan. This is explained right in the link you provided.   If your income increases to the point where you no longer have a partial financial hardship, any unpaid interest that has accumulated would be capitalized (added to your total loan balance). You can still stay in IBR, and your payments will be capped at the 10-year standard monthly payment on the balance you owed when you first entered repayment on the loan. You will never be ""kicked out"" of IBR based on your income."
StudentLoans,3djxl6,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:36:27 2015 UTC,"Does the same apply for PAYE?  If I make $200K and owe $300K in loans for example, I will never be kicked off?"
StudentLoans,3djxl6,lefferts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:48:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is correct. Just keep in mind that if your income increases early enough in the repayment process, you could end up paying off the entire balance before forgiveness kicks in. 20-25 years is the maximum amount of time you can be on an income-driven plan; many borrowers will pay off their debt sooner than that."

You will get assigned a payment plan (which you can change), and you will be expected to pay the loans. If you no longer qualify for IBR, you will not receive forgiveness under that plan."

StudentLoans,3di44r,Betsy514,12,Thu Jul 16 13:31:55 2015 UTC,Another option is getting on ibr and overpaying. My 10 year payment was unaffordable on my income. Ibr dropped it to 150 i pay 300-400 depending on how much my side job brings in. I apply those extra payments to principle and ran calculation will shave several years/1000s off. Like any debt min. Payment=max interest maybe this article will wake the head burrowers up to take some action on their life!
StudentLoans,3di44r,Runliftyogarepeat,3,Thu Jul 16 18:33:18 2015 UTC,"This is a great plan.  You get the flexibility with your budget because you have a low payment due, but no prepayment penalties on fed loans if you have a little extra to throw at it."
StudentLoans,3di44r,AnyNameIsFine,6,Fri Jul 17 00:33:41 2015 UTC,"Banking on (longterm) IBR and forgiveness you are essentially betting against yourself that you will never achieve a higher income.  Sure you might come out ""ahead"" if your wages stagnate for twenty years.  However, any move up in your career is going to also bump up your IBR payment.  Since you've only been paying a minimum amount on your loans, the amount of interest accruing will be high.. and you might end up making a high enough salary down the road to end up paying off the loan before the 20 year time frame ends.  IBR is a great program for helping people that cannot afford their loan payments, but it shouldn't be viewed as a way to avoid your loans (or get them forgiven).  If you have the money available, I'd put that towards paying down the loans."
StudentLoans,3di44r,iamajs,2,Thu Jul 16 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that we need to consider all of the implications of the various repayment plans, and, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure if this analysis is completely accurate. I believe that the 70,800 total paid includes the forgiven amount of 6,000. This leaves the difference between the 10 year plan and the IBR/PAYE at $9000 (+ up to $2000 tax on the loan forgiveness).  It's true that you'll be paying more on the loan, but it doesn't seem as bad as the article makes it out to be. What's more, it doesn't include the opportunity cost of not having that cash on hand.    If a borrower has an extra, say 2-3k/year cash on hand that can be invested with an average of 5% return over those 20 uears, they can make far more than the difference in total repayment. Even if they are only able to stash away $1000 for investments, they stand to make nearly 15k.    I'm all for getting out of debt, let's just do the math and make sure we come out ahead."
StudentLoans,3di44r,AnyNameIsFine,4,Thu Jul 16 14:10:39 2015 UTC,"no - it appears to subtract it actually.  I just ran another one - $45K in loans, $30K interest paid, total paid $70K, forgiveness amount $5K.  So it does not include the forgiven amount.  Regardless, that's why I make the point to go over ones overall financial situation annually.  All of these things need to be considered.  I just run into a lot of borrowers who are angry because they have been paying for 15 years and most of their payments are going towards interest.  They always assume they are being ""scammed"" when in fact it's a payment option they signed up for.  So the goal of the piece was to try and help consumers think of the long term as well as the immediate payment amount"
StudentLoans,3di44r,AnyNameIsFine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:04:07 2015 UTC,"Right you are, my mistake.  I'm sure that the number of borrowers who are shocked by how much they've paid in interest is far higher than any other group and people should be made explicitly aware of what they are signing up for.  My case is an exception to this rule, with over $250k in loans I've been mapping out a lot of possibilities and for me 10 year repayment is likely the most expensive."
StudentLoans,3di44r,ANGR1ST,2,Fri Jul 17 00:26:17 2015 UTC,"As far as what I've seen from those calculators, the $70,800 doesn't include the $6000.  I completely agree with you about having cash on hand. But the argument about investing is tricky.  I ran some numbers a while back for a case with really high debt and high interest rate (grad loans I think) compared the returns of investing, standard repayment, and IBR/PAYE.  https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39atf7/interesting_article_regarding_student_loans/cs2op9c  The things that jumped out at me were that the ""IBR+invest"" plan is much more susceptible to fluctuations in your investment return and discipline to continue investing without deciding to just spend another $100/ mo on ""stuff"" instead. Also just how much the ""benefit"" of forgiveness relies on the remaining balance. The higher the balance at 25 years, the more it makes sense."

StudentLoans,3dj1rw,Barrill,7,Thu Jul 16 17:49:23 2015 UTC,"From the Private loans I've seen (and I think this is consistent across the board), the interest is simple. It does not compound at all while in deferment. It'll ""capitalize"" and compound once when you exit your grace period and enter repayment. And then it won't compound again unless you go into/outof another deferment period.  8% is pretty high. I'd do everything I could to reduce the balance at that rate (work), and try to get it paid off as quickly as possible."
StudentLoans,3dj1rw,ANGR1ST,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I'll see if mine is the same.  I agree that 8% is high. I'm going to refinance as soon as I graduate to get a lower rate with a normal loan.   Thanks for the info! So you think it'd be a good idea to pay off my interest every month then?"
StudentLoans,3dj1rw,ANGR1ST,2,Thu Jul 16 18:06:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going to refinance as soon as I graduate to get a lower rate with a normal loan.    What do you mean by ""normal loan""? A personal/signature loan is going to have a comparable interest rate. And I wouldn't assume that just because Sofi advertizes better rates you'll qualify right out of school.  It actually doesn't matter if you pay off the interest every month, or stick that money in a savings account and pay everything off in one lump sum near the end of your grace period. (If you used one of the online banks with 1% savings you'd effectively save yourself a little money that way.) The only arguments for paying interest in school instead of stashing it away are: 1) you might not be disciplined enough to keep saving or otherwise not spend the money and 2) You want to take the $2500/yr SL interest tax deduction (waste when you're in a low bracket in school IMO).  Now if you were able to pay more than the interest accruing, it might make sense to start paying down the debt now. BUT when you graduate you'll probably need some liquidity. If you have to move and buy new clothes and rent a new apartment, that all costs money. So I'd rather leave school with $10k in cash and $10k in debt than neither of either. Keep some cash ($3-5k?) in anticipation of that."
StudentLoans,3dj1rw,ANGR1ST,2,Thu Jul 16 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"True. Thanks.  I'm reading through my application papers now. The interest section reads,    a. Accrual – Beginning on the first Disbursement Date, interest on this Note will be calculated at the Variable Rate on the principal balance advanced, and on any unpaid interest added to principal according to paragraph 4.c., below, until the Note is paid in full. Interest will be calculated on a daily simple interest basis, according to the outstanding principal balance each day of the term of the Loan. The daily interest rate will be equal to the annual interest rate in effect on that day, divided by the number of days in that calendar year. b. Variable Rate – The Variable Rate is equal to the Current Index, plus a “Margin” calculated according to the loan program rules and as disclosed to me on the Disclosure Statement. You will disclose to me the Margin applicable to my Loan on the approval Disclosure Statement. The Variable Rate will change quarterly effective on the first calendar day of each January, April, July and October (the “Change Date(s)”) if the Current Index changes. The “Current Index” for any calendar quarter beginning on a Change Date (or for any shorter period beginning on the Disbursement Date and ending on the first Change Date) is the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as published in The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of the calendar month immediately preceding each Change Date. You may round the Current Index higher to two decimal places. For example, 6.68751% will be rounded to 6.69%. (This is an example and may not reflect the actual LIBOR.) LIBOR is the British Banker’s Association average of interbank offered rates for dollar deposits in the London market base on quotations at 16 major banks. LIBOR is only a pricing index and is not necessarily the lowest interest rate index used by you or any other lender. If LIBOR is no longer available, you will choose a comparable index. The Variable Rate will not exceed 18%. c. Capitalization – You may, at your option, add all accrued and unpaid interest to the principal balance of my loan on the last day of the Interim Period and at the end of any forbearance period. In addition, should I default under the terms of this Note, you may, at your option, add all accrued and unpaid interest to the principal balance of my loan upon such default. Such capitalized interest is thereafter considered the principal, and interest will accrue on the new principal balance. In addition, if I am in default under this Note, you may, at your option, add any unpaid interest, late charges, NSF fees or other charges outstanding at the time of default to the principal amount of my loan, to the extent permitted by law.   Is this kind of what you were saying? The accrual section is kind of alarming...does it compound daily??"

The Dept. of Ed. doesn't care if your dad makes $0 or has a small/limited credit history.  They are looking for adverse items on your dad's credit over the last 5 years. So for example, if he had a bankruptcy, foreclosure, or had any debts written of during that time period (there are a few other items as well) - he wouldn't qualify.  However, if he is past the five year mark on one of those things this year, then that could be the reason why he got approved."

StudentLoans,3dioqh,the-blueberry,2,Thu Jul 16 23:47:33 2015 UTC,"Hi, this does happen sometimes. PLUS credit standards are fairly lenient when compared with other types of consumer credit, so sometimes families can be approved when they do not expect it. Some of the credit standards did change this year as well, (see here) so it is possible that you father is no longer considered to have an adverse credit history per Department of Education standards.   Your financial aid counselor has the power to exercise professional judgment and decline the loan. You should contact him or her and explain the situation. They will likely ask for some sort of proof as to why your father shouldn't receive the loan (such as debt to income information, a copy of his credit report, etc). If they are willing to do this, then you will be eligible for the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan that you have received in years past.  Good luck!"

StudentLoans,3dgwu7,Betsy514,2,Thu Jul 16 15:38:14 2015 UTC,Yes - but for help on with your loan itself you need to work with your loan holder.  When I asked about the contract I was asking what it said about cancelling.  Your original question was how to get out of it
StudentLoans,3dg97q,sdnw88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:03:16 2015 UTC,"Nothing has been finalized yet. However, the Department of Education has made it pretty clear that the intent is for the cap to apply to new borrowers only. If you already have federal loans, you shouldn't have to worry about this."
StudentLoans,3dg97q,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:56:50 2015 UTC,"""New borrowers"" is confusing me as well. I have at least two more loan disbursements coming up on top of the loans I already have before I finish school. These would be under the same MPN I've already signed (fall 2014). Theoretically, say the cap was to go into effect this fall- would all my loans, including 2015-16 disbursements, still be eligible for uncapped forgiveness? Or only the disbursements before 2015-16?"
StudentLoans,3dg97q,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jul 17 01:06:39 2015 UTC,"""New borrower"" means you have no loans before a specific date, like July 2016 for example. If you took out any loans before that date (which you did), all of your loans would be grandfathered."

I was in this situation where my parents kicked me out of the house midway through my senior year in high school, and when I applied for financial aid, I couldn't because my parents would not let me see their tax return.  I applied for an independent override at my school but was denied because I didn't meet their very strict requirements- including physical abuse by a parent with corroborating police reports. In short, it's not gonna happen in your situation, given what you've described.  What I did was wait until the year I turned 23, when you get automatic independent status.  What your kid can do is community college in the meantime that does not require loans."

Unless she is 24, a graduate student, married, an orphan, has a dependant of her own or is a veteran, she is considered dependant for federal aid purposes and the parent providing the post support must supply their info on the FAFSA or all she will be eligible for are unsubsidized Stafford loans.

EFT is a process that actually begins several days prior to the withdrawal.  It's very likely that there was no way to cancel the regular withdrawal within 3 days.    As far as when you'll get your money back?  I'd guess 45 - 60 days.  Most companies have a policy to wait 30 days before issuing a refund to ensure that the money actually cleared.  yes, it's showing it left your bank account - but if you check places such as /r/personalfinance and /r/legaladvice, you'll see that the actual check clearing process can take several weeks.  For that reason, most large companies won't issue refunds for some time.  Bottom line - the only mistake here was the rep telling you the next payment wouldn't come out.  And i guaranty you this was a mistake, not a lie used to ""steal"" your money.  You don't even have to call them anymore.  If the loan is PIF'd and the over payment is more than $5, they will send it to you automatically - but not for a while."

StudentLoans,3ddr5l,frmrstudent626,2,Wed Jul 15 13:59:22 2015 UTC,"Your issue here is three-fold:   You have a past-due balance You are not currently enrolled You had a balance sent to collections, which likely means your credit has been tarnished.   Traditional private student loan lenders require enrollment (be it less than half-time, half-time, or full-time) in order to pay off a past-due balance.  Additionally, most lenders that do offer loan products that are approved for this purpose have a time limit on how old the balance can be. I am not aware of any lenders that will lend a student loan to a non-student for the purposes of covering a two-year-old balance.   You can try checking with your banking institution or credit union to see if they will offer you a traditional consumer loan to cover your balance, but be aware that you are very likely to experience approval issues due to credit. I would suggest that you check out /r/personalfinance for information on how to deal with the collection agency and then see if you can work out an acceptable payment plan that will help you to rehab your credit and get rid of the balance. It may take a few years before you can re-enroll in school."

Otherwise, it's set up a payment plan and start making payments."

StudentLoans,3day5r,Betsy514,3,Tue Jul 14 23:53:31 2015 UTC,"The only way to ""transfer"" a Parent PLUS loan into your name would be to take out a private student loan or personal loan and use the money to pay off the Parent PLUS loan in full. It doesn't sound like this is going to be possible right now given that you are still in school with a relatively low income.  Honestly, I think you're better off leaving the loans where they are and putting them on the cheapest repayment plan possible (most likely ICR). If you want to take responsibility for the monthly payments, that's fine, but there is a very good chance that a portion of this debt will eventually be forgiven/discharged if it stays in a parent's name. There are a few ways this could theoretically play out:  1) Your parents successfully demonstrate undue hardship and discharge some or all of the debt in bankruptcy.  2) The parent borrower dies or becomes permanently disabled before the debt is fully paid off.  3) Your parents live long enough to make 25 years of income-contingent payments and the remaining balance is automatically forgiven."

The catch is that they are only allowed to keep a certain amount of assets (aka, if you own a vacation home and a yacht, you have to sell them and pay your creditors, but you can keep your clothes and car and basic nessecities). The plus loans are debts owed by your parents. Your parents need to disclose those debts in their court filings (full disclosure is mandatory) and after that it's up to the lawyers and the court to decide if the plus loans are discharged (your parents don't have to pay, the debt goes away) at the conclusion of their bankruptcy case. It is a common misconception that student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy - they are difficult to discharge but not impossible. There is a separate hearing they will have to attend before the bankruptcy court called an advisarial proceeding. For now this is an issue for your parent's bankruptcy lawyer to sort out. Talk to that lawyer, because s/he'll probably tell you that you should not make payments while their bankruptcy is ongoing, as that could get you all in trouble for something called a fraudulent/preferential transfer.   If the debt is discharged, no need to pay. So the best thing us to sit in your heads right now and wait.   If the debt is not discharged in bankruptcy, then you should start worrying about IBR or other options. But it's too early to worry about that. For now, worry about school and increasing your earning potential post-grad.  *edit: also, I hope you didn't contact the loan servicer directly like you mentioned in your OP. All of your parents creditors have to deal with the bankruptcy trustee now, and with their attorney. If you start contacting creditors in the meantime, you're gumming up the works. If they haven't filed for bankruptcy yet, any deals you work out right before they file will probably be undone by the bankruptcy trustee."
StudentLoans,3dbv6p,Quicklywerun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:42:08 2015 UTC,Pay them off. Your credit score possibly going up is not worth the interest of stretching out payments.   There are other ways to build your score without paying an interest premium. Such as using a credit card and paying off in full every month.
StudentLoans,3dad1q,throwawayvitamins963,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:06:20 2015 UTC,"PNC, Wells Fargo, Discover, and other banks are getting back into student loans. I personally used Sallie Mae for all my extras. It really comes down to who has the lowest current interest rate.  The usual answer is to avoid private student loans if at all possible due to their quite high interest rates. Since in this case that is not possible, find a private loan that has a low interest rate, and since many of them don't require payment for 6 months after graduation, you have plenty of time to figure out how to pay this new private loan off FIRST (it will most certainly have higher interest rates than your other loans through your school and the government).  Congrats for having a quite manageable amount of debt (the average is somewhere around $33,000)."

If you don't end up needing the money, just pay it back ASAP so you don't get stuck paying any unnecessary interest.  Also note that Direct Loans (even subsidized ones) do have an origination fee so they're not completely free even if you pay them back before you finish school. I don't think Perkins loans have origination fees so that might be your best bet if you want a zero-cost loan."

StudentLoans,3d83ir,aaronsweber,3,Tue Jul 14 23:47:29 2015 UTC,"The Perkins loans are subsidized so they are interest-free while you're in school. So, if you WERE to take out loans you weren't sure you'd need, those would be the ones to use. You could pay them back at the end of the year and not have it cost you any money in interest.  But the temptation to spend it when you've got it can be strong.   What if you asked the financial aid office about this situation? Ask them what happens if you don't take loans now but have an emergency halfway through the semester and need loans later."
StudentLoans,3d83ir,fakename23,2,Tue Jul 14 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will let you take out loans which you denied in the previous year. If it's during the same year, then you can get it disbursed at the beginning of the next quarter."

However, it is in your hands to use the money responsibly. Other than that, yes it will be hard to live off of that little money, especially when your friends all go to freebirds but you cant afford it... ever.

You're absolutely right that the ""just in case"" will inevitably be something completely unnecessary and not worth the interest you'll end up paying on the loan, no matter how small the loan.   *OP should also really consider that this is your freshman year. One year of no debt is great, but depending on how things go, you might accrue debt over the next 3/4 years while finishing your degree and that 2k loan will just be another 2k you have to pay back with interest. You'll be kicking yourself if you end up with more debt and realize you blew 2k in college on dumb shit.   As for learning how to invest, 2k really isn't that much. Avoid loans now and when you get a nice job after college, you'll have more money to put towards retirement or to do whatever investing you want and then you'll be playing with serious sums. The 2k now will save you from unnecessary payments that'll eat into your savings then."

Depending on your EFC, you may even qualify for subsidized loans which are interest-free while you're in school.   Since I plan on paying it back within three months, are certain options or private bank loans better than others?   If you pay back a federal loan within 120 days, they will apply your payments as a refund - reversing any interest that accrued to date.

Helping you fill out the FAFSA isn't going to put them on the hook for a single dime of your education costs. Private loans most likely will since it's extremely difficult for most students to qualify for private loans without a cosigner. Your lack of credit history is going to disqualify you from anything but federal loans."

No credit check needed.  Best case scenario though is that your let your folks know that supplying their info in no way obligates them to pay for your school - but may in fact help qualify you for other aid besides loans.

Stafford loans are better than PLUS loans because they have lower interest rates and lower origination fees. So you should take the full Stafford loan amount and then cover the remaining balance with a small Grad PLUS loan.  With that in mind, it sounds like you're going to be borrowing $120K+ for three years of grad school which is an enormous amount of money for one degree. What type of school is this and what is your major? Are you sure the degree is worth all of that debt?"

A graduated or extended repayment plan might have lower monthly minimums than IBR in your situation.  Something else you might want to think about long-term is filing your income taxes separately. This would allow you to sign up for IBR using only your income, not your combined household income. It's not always a great solution since MFS often results in a significantly higher tax burden, but it's worth running the numbers to see if it might work in your favor (especially if you qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness after 10 years)."

You make more than the median household income in the States at a presumably young age. You are not poor, you are just borrowing(student loans, credit cards) in a way that would only make sense to produce an income for you of at least 80k a year.  So, buckle down. I don't know how you accrued the medical and credit card debt but get rid of it and start paying on the loans.  $600 a month in debt repayment for these loans is extremely doable on that income if you get the rest of your financial picture under control.  When I graduated and married my wife, we made about 70k a year and were regularly paying well above that amount on student loans with ease.   You need to accept that you borrowed a huge sum and that this is going to require hard work and discipline to get out of. Even with incredibly generous federal loan programs, you are going to need to pay some on those loans. The private loans are unlikely to grant you much of a reduction. Especially because you really do make a good income compared to many Americans. You are not poor."

I just need to get the minimum down as much as I can for now until more things are under control.  Credit card debt is on me/the husband, mostly stupidity, but the medical debt is a lot of unfortunate circumstances and built up over the years, and is never going to go away (life-long disease isn't cheap).  I'm not trying to get out of the loans completely. I know that's not going to happen. I just wanted some advice on how income is looked at, not necessarily a heaping dose of ""hey, accept it and figure your shit out."" I'm already working on that.

Either the school didn't report his enrollment status to the Student Loan Clearinghouse, or they did and the lender (Navient) isn't able to find that status for some reason. Hard to say for sure.  Worst case scenario, if Navient wants your husband to make a payment right now and he absolutely can't afford to do that, it may be worth calling them and asking them to put the loans into forbearance until everything is sorted out. That way, your husband won't have to worry about missing any payments and damaging his credit.  Edited for clarity."

Once they complete their part of the form and send it to Navient, they will know you are still in school and postpone payments and (possibly some) interest until you finish school.

If your mother forged his signature, that's obviously not legal and your father could probably make a case for getting the debt cancelled due to fraud/identity theft... but it really depends on whether or not he is willing to throw her under the bus to get out of paying the debt.   I guess my question is, are my parent plus loans that are in his name my responsibility whatsoever?   No. If the loans are in your father's name, they are 100% his responsibility and any negative consequences associated with not paying the debt would fall on him.   My question is will his refusing to work with/ pay these loans affect my credit and or how can they affect him?   No, they will not affect your credit.

StudentLoans,3d56gw,Legs87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:42:07 2015 UTC,"No, if you are not actually enrolled at least half time you need to be making payments. There is a chance the school could drop the ball of a little while, but the wise course is to plan to pay it back starting after the grace period."
StudentLoans,3d23jb,coopstar777,7,Sun Jul 12 22:17:17 2015 UTC,"For student loans, the best options are the ones you get from FAFSA (Direct Loans). Anything else is pretty much going to be a private loan which you already know is not ideal.  Your parents could take out Parent PLUS loans on your behalf... but honestly, these can get a bit messy depending on your family dynamic. Your parents will be the only ones legally responsible for these loans, but there have been plenty of posts in this subreddit from recent graduates who were guilted into paying back all of their parents' loans without any discussion prior to the loans being taken out. If you go the Parent PLUS route, please make sure you and your parents are on the same page from Day 1.  For scholarships, try FastWeb or Scholarships.com. You could also check with your financial aid office. Unfortunately, you're probably not going to have a whole lot of options this late in the game (most scholarship deadlines are in the spring) but it's worth a try."
StudentLoans,3d1dt6,Wazzujon,3,Sun Jul 12 18:47:19 2015 UTC,"Why would I continue doing PSLF then? Heres why. Our payments would be $600 total a month. That's $7200 a year and $72000 in 10 years. Rest of loan is wiped off.   That's not how it's actually going to work.  Income-driven repayment plans do not have fixed payments for the life of the loan. Your combined monthly minimums might be $600 per month right now but IBR has to be renewed annually, with the monthly minimums adjusted to reflect any changes in your income. It sounds like the $600/month payments may already be based on outdated income information (last year's tax return?) so I would expect the payments to increase significantly next year to reflect your combined ~$160K annual income.  EDIT: Just ran the numbers. Not sure how you currently file your taxes, but a married couple filing jointly with $160K in combined income wouldn't even qualify for IBR on $119K in federal student loan debt. Granted, you won't get kicked off IBR once you're already on it... but your monthly minimums are going to increase to the equivalent of the 10-year standard plan (about $1,300 per month)."
StudentLoans,3d1dt6,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:18:50 2015 UTC,"Last year, we sold our business. We sold it for $300K but he is making payments which means we could only recognize the $15K he paid. Also we where a inventory based business. At the start of year we had $100K and when we sold that means we had zero in inventory, which is looked at as a loss.  So we had a $85K loss on our tax return. Our AGI was $15K. Lost year it was an anomaly. Next year it will be my wifes income of $53K, my income of $30K (was a sub for the first part of this year and received a contract for next school year) plus the $60K. So that means next year it will be $143K. If you subtract out deductions etc it would be about $120K. They then subtract out the 150% of poverty ($30k)which leaves 90K. We would then pay 15% of that.  But when I put these numbers on the website it shows a max payment of $662. My accountant wants me to create a business, have the money from the sale of the business go to that, and we would draw a salary from the  business. It would drastically lower our tax liability.  Also, if we do it as normal payments we also still use that to pay off business loans so we will have interest expense, plus we will have capital gains tax on top of that so that means of that $60K its more like $30K.  Right now my wifes IBR is zero, last year it was $300ish.   I wouldn't mind if the FHA recognized the $1300 a month! BUT they are not. They are saying its $2380!"
StudentLoans,3d1dt6,xtrexjpsouz,2,Sun Jul 12 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"Next year it will be my wifes income of $53K, my income of $30K    In the OP, you said your combined teaching income was $100K. This is only $83K. If you want good advice, you really need to give us accurate numbers.   If you subtract out deductions etc it would be about $120K.   How are you coming up with that $23K in deductions? Keep in mind that itemized deductions like mortgage interest and property taxes do not reduce your AGI.   They then subtract out the 150% of poverty ($30k)which leaves 90K.   Do you have a kid? You didn't mention any in your original post or follow-up comment so I assumed it was just the two of you.   They then subtract out the 150% of poverty ($30k)which leaves 90K. We would then pay 15% of that.   15% of $90K is $1,125 per month.   But when I put these numbers on the website it shows a max payment of $662.   Which calculator are you using? I have a feeling this is just your share of the monthly IBR payment... not the combined payment for both you and your wife."
StudentLoans,3d1dt6,Betsy514,3,Sun Jul 12 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"I think you might be confused - or maybe you misspoke in your post.  Working towards PSLF or not working towards PSLF will not change your payment amount under IBR or any other plan.  I think you meant why would anyone do IBR?  But then you seem to answer your own question - by your calculations (which may be wrong based on what xtrexjpsouz found) you'll repay 72K if you stay on ibr and end up qualifying for the pslf forgiveness after ten years.  If you stay on ibr and don't try and qualify for pslf you'll pay back almost 4 times as much.  Why wouldn't you stay on ibr and keep working towards pslf?  either way - i think your issue is with FHA not your student loans.  If it's true they don't ""count"" IBR and are going to assume a higher payment amount - and that amount disqualifies you for the loan - whatever payment plan you're actually on doesn't matter - they aren't going to qualify you.  You may want to find out why they don't consider IBR and see what if you can appeal that decision instead."

When I do my taxes next year it won't show a salary for me teaching from Jan to Dec. A first year teacher with masters is $48k my wife is St 5 years with masters. Loan originators use what's on the salary schedule as teachers have contracts.  So if you use a salary of $50 and $50 to keep it simple, then  subtract out Ira of $10k that drops to $90k, plus we can subtract out taxes, student loan interest. Etc it then drops to $85. Yes this doesn't reflect my business income as we don't know what to do at this point. It's all going to depend on the outcome of our house purchase.  If you put in the calculator on studentloan.Govand put in both my wife's and my student loans it spits out a number of $250-$650. As far as your question on how many kids, just 1."
StudentLoans,3cxzkp,acousticphysics,3,Sat Jul 11 20:06:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the rules are for late fees on federal loans, but student loan servicers definitely do report missed/late payments to the credit bureaus. Given that it typically takes 270 days to officially default on a federal loan, I'm guessing your girlfriend's credit is pretty trashed at this point... especially if the loans were unconsolidated. That's a pretty big penalty in itself."
StudentLoans,3cxzkp,xtrexjpsouz,2,Sun Jul 12 18:32:47 2015 UTC,"A federal student loan becomes delinquent as soon as a payment is missed.  The loan stays delinquent until payments are current or a deferment or a forberance has been given by the loan servicer.  Loan servicers will generally not report missed payments to credit agencies until the loan has been delinquent for 90 days, although late fees may be charged depending on the servicer.  The loan will not default until it has been delinquent for 270 days (when this happens the government immediately requires payment in full).  If she has a legitimate reason that she is unable to make her payments than she likely is eligible for a deferment or forbearance.  source: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/default http://www.direct.ed.gov/inrepayment.html"

Yes, that is exactly it. IBR applications take a few weeks to process. It is standard practice for the service to put your loans into administrative forbearance while they finalize everything. This prevents you from accidentally missing a payment or making any other changes to the loans.   My loans are now is forbearance and my next payment is 8/3 for half of what the payment used to be and it saying I don't owe anything.   That next payment is probably your new monthly minimum under IBR."

Perkins loans are typically originated and serviced by your school, have a 5% interest rate, and are subsidized (no interest while you're in school).

StudentLoans,3cw0bf,painted_deserts,8,Sat Jul 11 06:28:37 2015 UTC,"I actually just went through this process at my university. You should be able to appeal their decision to deny your original appeal with support from your advisor and documentation from your doctors. You can also usually apply for medical withdrawal up to 6 months after the term you had trouble in, and proof of that medical issue forcing you to withdraw from classes makes for really good support for your case.  Such bullshit and paperwork burnout, but it's work a shot to pursue your education. So sorry you're having to deal with it - I hate being treated like having an illness is a crime! Good luck!"
StudentLoans,3cw0bf,lallybroch876,4,Sat Jul 11 08:09:24 2015 UTC,"I agree you should appeal the denial but with better information.

StudentLoans,3cw0bf,Betsy514,2,Sat Jul 11 12:06:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely agreed!! If the appeal was denied the first time, you have to come back with more solid documentation (especially supported/signed by your doctors and advisors) or you'll just get denied again."

Having both would help. Also make sure that your personal statement is thorough and to the point, making it clear that the only reason you failed to meet their standards was the extenuating circumstance of your illness.  I'm not sure what else might be needed depending on your university, but usually your academic advisor and/or the student ombudsman can help with that sort of policy stuff. Helping students appeal committee decisions is not going to be new to them. Make sure to use any and all resources available to students - there are always campus offices that just want to help students get past all the red tape and succeed in the school, but you have to seek them out."

StudentLoans,3cuk1a,Throwaway214570,5,Fri Jul 10 22:06:09 2015 UTC,"You need to clarify whether this is an actual full-time job or volunteer work. Volunteering does not count.  Regardless, I really don't think it's realistic for anyone to expect to work two full-time jobs (~70 hours per week) for the full 10 years required for PSLF. You're going to burn out.  EDIT: Also, remember that you have to be on an income-driven repayment plan to use PSLF... so unless you have a ridiculously large amount of debt, I suspect two legit full-time jobs might push you above the income limit for this type of repayment plan."
StudentLoans,3cuk1a,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:33:23 2015 UTC,PSLF contains a lot of information about public service loan forgiveness. Which I assume is what your asking about. The wording makes it sound like you need to be a full time employee at your non-profit. I doubt volunteering counts.
StudentLoans,3cuk1a,newsboy001,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:31:07 2015 UTC,"You have to be working full-time in the public service sector or as a teacher, meet every monthly payment for 10 years, and then and only then will it be forgiven (and without the rest being taxable income for that final year - which is sweet). Full-time seems to vary by employer, but from the studentaid.ed.gov site:   You must meet your employer's definition of full-time. However, for PSLF purposes, that definition must be at least an annual average of 30 hours per week. For purposes of the full-time requirement, your qualifying employment at a not-for-profit organization does not include time spent participating in religious instruction, worship services, or any form of proselytizing.   If you are a teacher, or other employee of a public service organization, under contract for at least eight out of 12 months, you meet the full-time standard if you work an average of at least 30 hours per week during the contractual period and receive credit by your employer for a full year's worth of employment.   If you are employed in more than one qualifying part-time job simultaneously, you may meet the full-time employment requirement if you work a combined average of at least 30 hours per week with your employers.   So 30 hours can do it and you need to be doing that for at least 8 months a year."
StudentLoans,3cuk1a,armesWuerstchen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:36:47 2015 UTC,"Also, importantly:   For a payment to count as one of the required 120 qualifying payments, you must be a full-time employee at a qualifying public service organization on the date that your federal loan servicer receives your monthly Direct Loan payment.   In addition, you must be a full-time employee at a qualifying public service organization at the time you apply for PSLF Program loan forgiveness and at the time forgiveness is granted.   So make sure the job qualifies and that you apply for the program once you start working there. Still, that's 10 years you'll need to make sure you'll be there, or some place equally qualified if you have to move."
StudentLoans,3cutcp,armesWuerstchen,5,Fri Jul 10 23:19:53 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things the IRS could do to collect the debt, including levying against your assets and taking future tax refunds.   If you wind up having a large tax due, you could present an offer in compromise (try to get the IRS to accept a smaller amount) or enter an installment agreement (pay over time).   IRS tax debt is entitled to priority in bankruptcy, and is not dischargeable in all circumstances."
StudentLoans,3cutcp,TheCupcakeQueen,2,Fri Jul 10 23:23:11 2015 UTC,This.

StudentLoans,3cutcp,manfred-mann,3,Sat Jul 11 02:05:27 2015 UTC,If you have 50k in loans forgiven your taxable income will increase by 50k for that year.  What this means is that you will owe somewhere between 25% and 35% of that amount to the IRS depending on your income before the forgiveness (no idea if you owe anything to the state). So you would owe between 12.5k and 17.5k in taxes. This is one hell of a lot better than 50k and the IRS has payment plans available: http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Payment-Plans-Installment-Agreements
StudentLoans,3cutcp,pezdeath,0,Sat Jul 11 03:58:26 2015 UTC,"25-35% is really high. Does anyone actually pay that amount? Its going to be more like 15%.  You also have to realize in 20 years your financial status will be different. You will have a lot more deductions, your income will be higher, etc. That means your AGI will not be what is on your pay stub, because you will have deductions. IE if your tax liability is 15% then 15% of 50K is only $7500."
StudentLoans,3cutcp,Wazzujon,3,Sun Jul 12 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, just one comment on the way it's worded. It's considered taxable income so you have to pay the taxes on that income.

I doubt, highly, that my loans will be payed off in 20 years. I can put a dent in them  (or at least the interest, Christ...) but yea... there's going to be a tax bomb in my future, and that's with me working in a field that promises good income gains.   I've decided to start putting some money aside for that, so I can see about negotiating or something. I know I could put it towards the loans themselves,  but that feels really futile, and at least, this way, if something awful happens I have that money to take care of that, and can figure out the IRS when the time comes if need be."

That's conservative, but thereis interest to consider.   I definitely don't doubt my degree, it was the best option for me, did me a world of good, and I'm in an amazing field with good income potential.  Just wish it hadn't cost so much.

StudentLoans,3cv0g4,colorrot,5,Sat Jul 11 00:20:27 2015 UTC,"You're correct that, for most people, consolidation is not necessary or helpful. There are some situations where it's still useful through. Here are a few reasons why someone may want to consolidate:   To make ineligible loans eligible for certain options. I'm not sure where you got the idea that consolidation would limit your repayment options (maybe you're confusing it with private refinancing?). If anything, consolidation should give you more options. A few examples: Parent PLUS loans have to be consolidated to be eligible for ICR. Perkins loans have to be consolidated to be eligible for IBR/PAYE. Perkins loans and FFEL loans have to be consolidated to be eligible for PSLF. To reduce the number of servicers. Some borrowers may have their federal loans split between two or three different servicers. For some, this may not be a big deal... but for others, it can be very difficult keeping track of everything when it's not in the same place. To mitigate damage to your credit score. Ideally, you won't ever miss a payment on your student loans... but if you do for whatever reason, note that if you have 10 individual loans, a single missed payment will show up 10 times on your credit report. If your loans were consolidated, the missed payment would only appear once. To switch loan servicers. If you aren't happy with your current servicer for whatever reason, consolidation is the only way to voluntarily switch servicers. To get out of default. If you can't afford the monthly payments required for rehabilitation, consolidation can be a good option for getting your loans out of default. To extend repayment when no other options are available. If you don't have enough debt to qualify for an extended plan and make too much money for an income-driven plan, your only option for extending repayment and reducing your monthly minimums may be consolidation."
StudentLoans,3cv0g4,xtrexjpsouz,5,Sat Jul 11 13:31:12 2015 UTC,"Parent plus borrowers should consider it if they are having trouble with their payments.  There's sort of a loophole that allows parent plus to be eligible for income contingent repayment (not income based or paye - they're never eligible for those) if consolidated.  Also parent plus loans are eligible for public service loan forgiveness - but since only payments made under ibr, icr, paye or a ten year standard plan, they pretty much have to get under icr to take advantage."
StudentLoans,3cv0g4,Betsy514,3,Sat Jul 11 03:30:03 2015 UTC,"Here's one reason I am considering it: I have several federal loans that are not eligible for IBR or PAYE, such as my Perkins loans. I'd I consolidate them with just one of my PAYE-eligible loans, then they ask are eligible. This means my minimum payment will be lower per month, as I only need to pay the amount calculated by PAYE, instead of that plus the standard payment of my Perkins."
StudentLoans,3cv0g4,Soccers56,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:56:40 2015 UTC,That's a good example. Haven't known anyone with a Perkins loan and don't know much about them.
StudentLoans,3cv0g4,painted_deserts,3,Sat Jul 11 04:59:30 2015 UTC,"I consolidated mine, because they ended up being at 3 different servicers and kept getting moved around over the years.

StudentLoans,3cv0g4,Lawful_Goblin,2,Sat Jul 11 06:26:24 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you mean all federal loans, and not just those that are serviced by FedLoan servicing. Not every federal loan is a Direct Loan (instead they might be one of the older FFELP loans), and would not be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness unless consolidated into the Direct Loan program."
StudentLoans,3cw5jh,shakespeare-gurl,4,Sat Jul 11 07:29:45 2015 UTC,I would focus on paying down the unsubsidized loan with the highest interest rate.
StudentLoans,3cvzex,espinchi,2,Sat Jul 11 06:06:09 2015 UTC,"Federal loans are not need-based at the graduate level. It doesn't matter how much money your friend makes; he will be eligible for unsubsidized Stafford loans and Grad PLUS loans up to the full cost of attendance (as long as he files the FAFSA). Given how much your friend is planning to borrow, I would recommend using these over private loans as the interest rates are fixed and they come with a lot more flexible repayment options.  With that in mind, $165K per year is an extremely high income. Obviously your friend cannot pay for all of his tuition upfront with $0 in savings, but he should definitely pay for all of his living expenses out-of-pocket... and start chipping away at the student loans as much as possible while in school."
StudentLoans,3cvzex,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:10:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Intuitively, I thought variable loans would be best given that he can pay it off in 4 years.  I saw the Common Bond variables loans at an APR between 1.94% and 4.76%, or the Citizen One's at 2.69% to 8.29%."
StudentLoans,3cvzex,xtrexjpsouz,2,Sat Jul 11 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"Private loans are credit-based though so there's no guarantee he would qualify for the best available rates. The current fixed rates on federal loans for grad students are 5.84% (Stafford loans) and 6.84% (Grad PLUS).  Also, if your friend returns any of the money within 120 days of disbursement, the federal government will apply it as a refund and cancel any interest that accrued on that balance to date. In other words, it'll be as if the money was never borrowed in the first place. Not sure if any private lenders do this."
StudentLoans,3ctlv4,dis_merg,5,Fri Jul 10 17:52:52 2015 UTC,"Begin with FAFSA.gov and take out what you can in Stafford loans first.  Then your dad could borrow the rest on a Parent PLUS loan, or cosign for a private loan. Given his (lack of) income, I think it will be hard for him to qualify for a private loan so PLUS will probably be the best bet. Then you can make a deal with him to pay it back for him when you get out of school.  Normally Parent PLUS loans go into repayment quite soon after the loan is taken out, but he can file a form to have them wait until you graduate."

StudentLoans,3ctlv4,aaronsweber,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:09:51 2015 UTC,"Parent PLUS loans are also federal so you and your parents get them through the same process. Check out Studenaid.ed.gov for more info.  PLUS loans can be a HUGE burden for parents, especially if they borrow to put multiple kids through school. They're in the parent's name, so if they go unpaid, the parent faces the consequences. If you plan to help your father out by paying them, be sure to set those expectations clearly. And be sure to understand what will happen if you don't or can't fulfill that obligation."

StudentLoans,3ctlv4,iamajs,3,Fri Jul 10 18:43:32 2015 UTC,"Student loans in themselves are not inherently evil.  They can be great in cases where they are not abused.  They can open doors for people to get a good education and land a great career.  The problem is people tend to over spend on their education for a degree that is worthless.  Yes, tuition costs are out of control.. but there are cheaper alternatives than a $100,000 degree.

StudentLoans,3ctlv4,BMKR,0,Fri Jul 10 23:13:01 2015 UTC,I would aggressively study entrepreneurship and surround yourself with people who run their own businesses - even if that means just learning as much as you can online.  My statements about not taking out loans is primarily based on the frustration of them expecting $700+ monthly payments.  I for one don't really trust the job world because you're ultimately at the mercy of someone else - so I spent years learning how to actually create income instead of working a job to earn it.  It's not easy - not even close. And I'm nowhere near where I'd like to be - but I do have the freedom to make my hours and decide my own rates - which is a freedom I simply can't live without at this point in my career.

StudentLoans,3cs8e7,AbidRaja,6,Fri Jul 10 10:25:03 2015 UTC,"Assuming $15,000 is the cost after already maxing out your federal Stafford loans, keep in mind that you're going to be graduating with $80,000+ in student loan debt. That's an enormous burden for the average college graduate. Please think long and hard about whether or not this degree is worth that kind of debt.  Parent PLUS loans are a good option since they come with most of the same flexible repayment options and protections as other federal loans... but the big downside is that they are in the parent's name only, so eligibility for any income-related options (hardship deferment, Income Contingent Repayment, etc.) would be based on the parent's situation, not yours.  Another option is private student loans. These are credit-based and will almost certainly require a creditworthy cosigner. Private loans can have very reasonable interest rates if your cosigner has awesome credit... but they offer almost no flexibility in the event that you have a hard time paying them back on schedule.  As far as the ""best loan to take out,"" the best loan is no loan at all. I would strongly recommend getting a part-time job to help pay for some of your living expenses. Also, keep looking for scholarships every year. I know it probably seems like they're all for incoming freshmen but there are some for upperclassmen. You'll just have to look a little harder."

If you're going into your 3rd year, looking into and transferring into a lower cost school is probably going to pay off more.   Going to a private school for my graduate cost me $150 because it took longer than expected. I only really stayed because I don't know  of anywhere else I could go to learn the same thing because it was so specialized. But I'm literally, and very painfully, paying for it now. I still haven't decided if it was really worth it.  If I had to do it again and could offer advice, go abroad to Germany. You can get a free education (not to mention extremely affordable healthcare) over there, even as a foreigner. They actually want more foreigners. I did a study aboard during my undergrad in the '04-'05 academic year. Best year of my life, bar none. Also my rent was amazingly cheap for such a large place.

My plus loans were either 6.41% or 7.9%, which ain't great. If you have to go for more than one (maybe two) semesters you'll have a huge debt and less repayment options.

That was less than two weeks ago. Submit it. Even if you don't get federal aid you might still be able to get the number for your visa and then apply for a private loan.   Also Nelnet does a lot of public loans (I repay my federal loan to Nelnet) so I would tend to trust them more than Sallie Mae. Check out their private loan rates and also check out your local credit union.

For those who already finished school, this doesn't matter because refinancing federal loans within the federal program is not a thing. Once you're locked into a rate, you're stuck with it regardless of where the new federal rates are set (unless of course you refinance through a private lender).  For reference: The current interest rate for undergraduate students is 4.29%."
StudentLoans,3cqal7,armesWuerstchen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:58:13 2015 UTC,"Looks like your right, at least from refinancing point of view. Taken from the fedloan site:   A Direct Consolidation Loan has a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan. The fixed rate is based on the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of 1%. There is no cap on the interest rate of a Direct Consolidation Loan.   So if you have a fixed rate, that's never going to change and it all just averages out across all the loans. But if you had variable rate loans (loans from before 7/1/06, since all fed loans are now fixed rate), locking a low rate during consolidation can make a huge difference.  I'm honestly can't remember what I had going on at the time, but I knew it was time sensitive, so I must have had variable rate loans that were about to go up."

StudentLoans,3cqdgl,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:45:25 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Married filing separate essentially disqualifies you from practically every decent tax deduction. Both you and your spouse must either itemize or take the standard deduction.
StudentLoans,3cqdgl,aaronsweber,2,Fri Jul 10 22:41:33 2015 UTC,"Must have started borrowing on/after 10/1/07. All of my grad loans are after that period, though my undergrad ones were from '02-'08. I consolidated those in '08, would that allow them to be included?   No. You are not a ""new borrower"" as of 2007 so none of your loans will qualify for Pay As You Earn (PAYE).   So why would anyone take ICR over IBR?   They wouldn't. The only reason someone would use ICR is if they don't qualify for any other income-driven plans. For example: ICR is the only income-driven plan that can be used on Parent PLUS loans... and only after they are consolidated.   Would getting married essentially make the government expect her to contribute?   Yes. If you get married and file taxes jointly, your combined household income will be used to calculate the monthly payments under IBR. I honestly don't think this is unreasonable... It prevents a borrower from purposely not working and not paying their debt while living off their spouse's $100K+ in income.  With that in mind, if you don't want your spouse's income to be included, you can choose to file taxes separately. It's not an ideal solution since filing separately usually costs you more in income taxes... but something to think about if you're definitely planning to get married."

StudentLoans,3cqdgl,AVLPedalPunk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:47:00 2015 UTC,It's not certain but it's in the negotiated rulemaking sessions. This article covers that and other details about upcoming changes to these plans.

StudentLoans,3cqdgl,AVLPedalPunk,0,Fri Jul 10 01:48:58 2015 UTC,"Fiancee has the same issue, long engagement ensuing, total bummer. Also curious what your master's degree was in? My fiancee is a chiropractor who has incredibly high overhead (a different argument for a different day) and makes about what you make w/ the same kind of prospects for the future."
StudentLoans,3cqdgl,ANGR1ST,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"well problem solved itself I suppose, We broke it off last night and I got my ring back and became $216k in her student debt richer + ~$5k for the engagement ring. However now I'm really sad, I've had a few pretty good cries I'm not ashamed to admit. I really wanted to spend my life with this woman despite her financial baggage, I had dreams of her being the mother of my kids. Sometimes I'd wake up in the middle of the night and we'd actually had the same dream and woke up at the same time. We were partners and lovers. But distance, jobs, and family tragedies on both sides have conspired to keep us apart indefinitely.  I've never connected w/ someone like I did with her."
StudentLoans,3cqwvy,ali_golightly,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"If you can make at least a monthly payment, it usually can bring your delinquency down by thirty days at a time and get you out of the danger zone. If you have deferment or forbearance options, you can call and see if you're eligible. I'd suggest only using what's necessary in the way of postponing payments, but they can help more specifically with your available options. Credit reporting and late payments suck, but default is worse. Are they private or federal?"
StudentLoans,3co4tv,Betsy514,7,Thu Jul 9 12:35:53 2015 UTC,Here's a blog that summarized the proposed plan that was written at the conclusion of the negotiated rulemaking meetings - this draft shouldn't deviate much from this unless something's happened.  http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/student-loan-ranger/2015/05/13/what-borrowers-can-expect-from-the-new-income-driven-repayment-plan
StudentLoans,3co4tv,jgonz85,4,Thu Jul 9 12:38:18 2015 UTC,"If borrowers' Revised Pay As You Earn payments do not satisfy monthly interest accrual, any interest not covered by the payment will be reduced by 50 percent.   That is interesting.  Does anyone know of any calculators that can model what this looks like over the course of a 25-yr repayment?"
StudentLoans,3co4tv,AcrossFromWhere,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:44:33 2015 UTC,That's awesome for my situation. And really that should have a pretty huge impact on many borrowers. Capped at ten percent of discretionary income and interest is cut in half. Two huge steps forward over the last few years.
StudentLoans,3co4tv,jgonz85,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:57:55 2015 UTC,"Totally. I haven't read the draft rules, but I wonder exactly what they mean by cutting the interest in half.  Is the APR slashed?  Is the interest accrued that statement period cut?  I need details! And then I need someone to make a calculator so I can see how it works because I went to law school to avoid numbers."
StudentLoans,3co4tv,Zolkalter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:20:43 2015 UTC,Neither - the government pays off the other 50% as it accrues.  Can't help you with the numbers  - I became a student loan compliance nerd for the same reason!!
StudentLoans,3co4tv,AcrossFromWhere,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:40:45 2015 UTC,"For round numbers, let's say my IBR payment is $1000 a month and my monthly interest accrual on my $200k+ balance is $1500 a month. I've been paying an extra payment each month of $700 to try and help. Does this 50% reduction mean that $450 of my ""extra"" payment will go to principal instead of the $200 right now?"
StudentLoans,3co4tv,AcrossFromWhere,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:06:51 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain that your extra payment will go to principal - but will double check later today

Additionally, is anyone in Washington thinking about the students that have loan balances that will greatly increase, due to not being able to even cover interest, and how that bubble is going to start popping sooner than later? I understand Washington is generally very short sighted, but they've got to see this one coming..."
StudentLoans,3co4tv,studentloansurvivor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:04 2015 UTC,"Actually your questions are related - it was for budget reasons.  They decided the budget couldn't afford to give all borrowers the 20 years.  As to your second question -yes - they are sort of kicking the can down the road here.  With that said, the models we did when IBR first came out seemed to indicate that most borrowers will end up paying their loans off under that plan before forgiveness kicks in.  If that doesn't turn out to be the case when the first batches of borrowers are up for forgiveness we can probably expect some changes.  But don't worry - if/when that happens I can almost guaranty they'll grandfather in existing borrowers.  With all of that said you may want to read my intended US news blog for next week.  The plan, if ok with the editors, is to talk about why these plans aren't right for everyone. (please excuse the somewhat shameless plug)"

StudentLoans,3cq50x,MrWnek,2,Thu Jul 9 21:47:38 2015 UTC,"Generally, the term ""consolidation"" is more associated with federal loans. What you are looking for is a refinance. Not all lenders offer this option but a few that do include SoFi, LendKey, Darien Rowayton Bank, Citizens Bank, Wells Fargo, and CommonBond. Note that you will need to be creditworthy to qualify and may still need a cosigner.  The biggest problem with this option in your situation is that (as far as I know) there are no private lenders that offer in-school deferment after you refinance. The expectation is that you will be completely done with school when you refinance; and if you do decide to go back for whatever reason, you'll have to at least make interest-only payments. Can you afford to do this?"
StudentLoans,3cq50x,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:09:35 2015 UTC,"Thats what Im trying to figure. Either way Ill have to make payments on interest according to my call to Sallie Mae (since that was my original plan).

StudentLoans,3coq71,DeepRedBells,4,Thu Jul 9 15:35:45 2015 UTC,"Very few people write reviews about how their loan company simply took their payments and they had no hassles. The people with problems are the loudest by FAR.  I've had no issues with Sallie Mae/Navient for my loan through them (Private ""Smart Option""). Their website seems to go down for maintenance rather often when I go to check it ... but that's typically at 2-3am when I get around to it, so I can't really blame them. Never had it down when I've checked during the day."
StudentLoans,3coq71,ANGR1ST,3,Thu Jul 9 19:07:32 2015 UTC,"Have you already maxed out your federal options from FAFSA? Federal loans offer a lot more flexibility than private loans. They also have fixed rates. (Sounds like you're looking at variable rates right now.)  I honestly don't think Sallie Mae is any worse than other private lenders. They just happen to be the largest loan servicer by far, so it makes sense that they would receive the most complaints."

I was expecting the typical ""I stopped spending money and devoted all my paycheck to x lender"" advice.  Since you sold a lot on CL, any tips or care to elaborate on your approach. I can't think of anything I would want to or really could sell at the moment, but I am a hobbyist photographer and want to sell my prints - currently my photos or on a couple of sites that let people order them directly. I really ought to build a small inventory of my own prints and try to sell them on CL and similar sites. What's your feel for selling art on CL?"
StudentLoans,3clczi,graesen,2,Wed Jul 8 21:18:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Since writing it I would add a google voice # to the listings when you post. That way people can call with all their dumb questions at the worst times and it will all be transcribed right to your gmail.   You can screen the calls and questions and only reply to the ones you feel are not wasting your time.   I tried to sell two paintings on CL and the ad is still listed, been up for about 5 months.   I see craigslist as a good channel to get rid of all your old junk without haveing to throw it away or getting 10 cents on the dollar by having a garage sale."

Also, what kind of random items were included in the 214 you claimed, and which were the most profitable? Thanks for the info!"
StudentLoans,3clczi,MJGSimple,9,Wed Jul 8 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"I too am curious as to what items OP was selling to rake in 34k. Considering the comment about parent's stuff, I imagine lots of it is stuff that people from lower income backgrounds won't have, at least not their parents are going to be willing to part with. Maybe I'm just skeptical though."
StudentLoans,3clczi,xfortune,8,Thu Jul 9 00:38:13 2015 UTC,"Using my college maths skills, the average item pirce would be around $160, rounding up.

StudentLoans,3clczi,MJGSimple,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:24:09 2015 UTC,"I have an excel sheet with every item and a running total. I sold 1 car for 5k and 2 dirt bike for 2k so the average should be weighted.

StudentLoans,3clczi,MJGSimple,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:52:10 2015 UTC,Honestly everyday stuff. I would walk into every room and sell anything that hasn't been touched/moved in the past 6 months.   I sold a car for 5k and 2 dirt bikes for 2k each. But everything else ranged from furniture to office supplies. I have an excel sheet with every item and the price I sold it for.

StudentLoans,3clczi,choadsauce,2,Thu Jul 9 17:05:05 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. Lots of people have stuff that they could part with and use to pay down debt.   My perspective is as someone whose parents don't have the ability to help in that way. I might be overemphasizing my perspective, but I imagine many of the people of PF/Frugal to be closer to my position than one of having friends and parents willing to part with hundreds of $200+ items."

StudentLoans,3clczi,onspace,2,Thu Jul 9 17:54:49 2015 UTC,"I hate the ""I stopped eating out and drinking Starbucks advice."" I have both. I had an apartment I leased near LAX and did the same thing at my parents house in the suburbs.   Airbnb is so cool in the sense that once you put a listing up you will get a feel for what type of person wants to rent it based on the location. At the apartment I got a ton of travelers that just needed a place to crash for the night which was awesome. They would show up late and leave early.   At the house we got a ton of people looking for a room for a longer amount of time week, month, etc. So we adjusted the ad to be more accommodating to that type of person.   And for items I literally sold anything and everything. I would walk into rooms at my parents house and just start listing stuff. New stuff in the box I would post on ebay cause you'll find more collectors there. Stuff that is like everyday usable I'd sell on craigslist: lawnmower, baseball gear, 2 cars (less than 5k each), furniture etc.   And Oakley stuff is so profitable, I have no idea why. I sold a pair of used sunglasses on ebay for $215, another pair for $99, and a backpack for $70. People on ebay love oakley stuff."

However if your prior rehab on the NJ loan was before August 14, 2008 you can rehab that loan again.  If it was after that date you can only rehab the NY loans.  You could consolidate the NJ loans out of default if it is no longer eligible for rehab  I know - that seems to be an arbitrary date but it's when the rule was made."

StudentLoans,3cktnv,TheTousler,6,Wed Jul 8 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"First of all, I'm sorry for this situation. It sucks. Period. Having said that, have your parents been making the payments consecutively without any hiccups for 2-3 years? If so, your parents may be able to contact the lender to release themselves. Oftentimes, the lender will require proof that the borrower (your sister) meets certain income requirements/credit score. Likely, since your sister has a bunch of CC debt and has a minimum wage job, this won't be an option. This is the shitty part of consigning for family members. In all likelihood, your parents will be on the hook."
StudentLoans,3cktnv,shaqfuuu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:21:34 2015 UTC,"They have been making consistent payments for a number of years, but you are right that my sister probably doesn't meet the requirements you described. Thanks a lot for your comments!"

StudentLoans,3cljcb,Malluna,3,Wed Jul 8 21:08:50 2015 UTC,Nope. Won't change your total repayment amount either way.  You should probably let them know anyway. Then you won't HAVE to pay every month. So if something came up and you wanted or needed to skip a month you could without hassle.
StudentLoans,3cljcb,ANGR1ST,3,Wed Jul 8 22:33:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure, but I think in-school deferment might kick you off auto-debit (causing you to forfeit the 0.25% rate reduction until you resume repayment)... so assuming you can comfortably afford the monthly payments, I would think you're better off just continuing to make the automatic monthly payments.  Also note that private lenders typically have limits on the total amount of in-school deferment you can take, so if you don't really need it right now, you might as well save it."

You're not supposed to be able to pay only one loan when the others have minimums, so they should have never applied her payment that way, even if she requested it.  You really really need to make sure they have accurate contact information for you."
StudentLoans,3ckw49,ANGR1ST,2,Wed Jul 8 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"This does seem kind of fishy... although it may depend on whether or not OP's SO actually made a full payment (enough to satisfy all of the minimums). A full payment definitely should have satisfied the minimums on all five loans, but I think I remember reading recently that the CFPB has been pushing private lenders to apply partial payments in the way OP described because it minimizes the number of missed/late payments on your credit report.  Example: Let's say you have 5 loans under a single servicer. You can only afford to pay one of them. If the payment is applied to one loan, you have 4 missed payments on your credit report. If the payment is distributed across all 5 loans, all 5 will be marked as past due because none of the minimums were fully satisfied."

It wouldn't hurt to give them a call and let them know that you are continuing straight into grad school... but they can't just take your word on it; your enrollment status has to be communicated to them by the school.  Honestly, I wouldn't worry too much about it. As long as your enrollment status is updated within the next couple of months, you will still get your full 6-month grace period after you finish grad school."

StudentLoans,3cimd4,Pineapple_Tommy,7,Wed Jul 8 05:02:05 2015 UTC,"So there's 3 things you can get from FAFSA. Both types of loans enter repayment 6 months after you stop going to school.   1) Unsubsidized loans - these accure interest while you're in school. Personally I pay $20 towards each loan a month, but you don't have to pay anything (but the amount you owe goes up)   2) Subsidized loans - These won't accure interest while you're in school. Well, they do, but you don't pay it (department of education does I think). You can also pay on these during school, but again, you don't have to.   3) Grants - You don't gave to pay these back, the money is yours."
StudentLoans,3cimd4,Lifeguard2012,5,Wed Jul 8 07:59:29 2015 UTC,"And Perkins loans, which are federal funds but managed by the school.... those are rarer and can sometimes be confusing."
StudentLoans,3cimd4,aaronsweber,3,Wed Jul 8 13:14:17 2015 UTC,When do you pay those back?   Typically you have to pay them back when you're done with school. You can delay those through deferment or forbearance but you do have to pay those back.    Will they have interest?   Yes. From what i've seen loans through FAFSA and the government can be a bit lower than private loans but it's always good to check.    Who would I even pay?   You pay back the company that is charge of those loans. You have to sign documents from this company so I recommend you familiarize yourself with them. The big one right now is Navient.

The Department of Education doesn't actually service any of its own loans so the company you pay will be a separate company like Sallie Mae, Nelnet, Great Lakes, etc. You will be told which company services your loans after the money is disbursed."

If it's only a few thousand dollars, you could probably set up a payment plan with the school and just work your way through school. If it's a lot of money... you may need to reduce your course load to part-time to spread out the cost.

You can do this.  My recommendation is to find the best type of job possible. On-campus gigs can be really good, like working at computer labs is a really good one.  You sometimes have to dig, but it also keeps you close to the school and sometimes opens up other benefits. (like study on the job)   I recommend going to speak with an advisor at your department. Explain your situation and that you think it would be good to get a job that helps you balance your school work. Sometimes they have an inside word on a great on-campus job that is pretty easy and can even offer a recommendation or intro.

StudentLoans,3cikwh,Sonik375,2,Wed Jul 8 04:47:06 2015 UTC,They should be able to obtain a parent plus loan - unless they have a big ticket item such as a bankruptcy or lien on their credit report.  But if their credit is bad and they can't afford to help you that is probably not a great idea.  You can try appealing to the school for additional funds but I'm afraid it's likely you may have to consider another school .
StudentLoans,3cikwh,Betsy514,2,Wed Jul 8 13:32:50 2015 UTC,"I assume you have already maxed out your federal options from the FAFSA?  Honestly, it sounds like you need to find a more affordable school... but if that's absolutely out of the question for whatever reason, I would suggest looking into Parent PLUS loans. These are federal loans made in a parent's name. The credit check on PLUS loans is much easier to pass than the one for private loans. Absolute worst case scenario, if one of your parents applies and is denied, you will be entitled to a few thousand dollars in additional federal loans (unsubsidized)."
StudentLoans,3chtz6,handmetheformuoli,2,Wed Jul 8 00:49:47 2015 UTC,"I would highly suggest making a dent into your student debt before buying an apartment. Paying anything under $600 per month is a bad idea.  I only say this because I walked out with $75,000k in loans with 7% interest. First 3 years out of school I only paid $300 and it's the biggest mistake I've made.  To answer your question, now that it's 3 years later and I've realized how stupid it was to pay less, I fought hard to get a better paying job and also moved back in with my family where I don't have to pay rent. I am now throwing anywhere between $600 to $1500 at my loans and so far I've paid $12,000k under 6 months.  Does it suck not owning my own place or living alone? Yes. Especially because I lived alone for awhile but again, I wish I was aggressive paying these loans off right away. All I know is that in couple of years I'll be debt free (read: anxiety & stress free) and it will be much easier to plan for my life when my student debt balance is zero. People who graduated with me were quick to move into their own spots where rent was $1300 per month and just about all of them right now are pulling out their hair over stress because they can't pay off their student loans. They live with multiple roomates and absolutely feel stuck and helpless. Don't let this happen to you! Good luck."
StudentLoans,3chtz6,Bosnacium,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:09:59 2015 UTC,"I paid off $17,150 in 10 months and spent well over 1k a month to accomplish this.  I am assuming a 5% annual interest rate since you did not provide the interest rate for each of your loans.  10 year payoff plan  Loan amount: $70,000 Loan term: 10 years or 120 months Interest rate: 5% per year Loan start date: 7/7/2015 Monthly Payments: $742.46 Payoff date: July 7, 2025  If you added an extra payment of $300/month that changes the payoff date to Feb 7, 2022.  20 year payoff plan  Loan amount: $70,000 Loan term: 20 years or 240 months Interest rate: 5% per year Loan start date: 7/7/2015 Monthly Payments: $461.97 Payoff date: July 7, 2035  If you added an extra payment of $100/month that changes the payoff date to April 7, 2030.   The takeaway here is that you should definitely pay more than the minimum if you ever want to pay these loans off in the next few decades. Paying only $200-$300/month just won't cut it..."
StudentLoans,3chtz6,TickleMePickleMe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:20:51 2015 UTC,"My question to you would be, how much do you pay monthly on your student loan?   On a 10-year repayment plan, the minimum payments on $70K in student loan debt would be over $700 per month.   My question to you would be, how much do you pay monthly on your student loan?   This doesn't matter. What matters is how much YOU have to pay monthly. What are your interest rates and how long is the repayment plan on your private loans? If you don't know, you need to figure this out ASAP.   Would I be able to negotiate for a lower monthly payment to around $200-300/month or lower?    Not in your case. Income-Based Repayment can reduce the monthly minimums on your ~$15K in federal loans, but private loans do not typically offer any flexible repayment options so you're pretty much stuck with whatever they ask you to pay on that remaining ~$55K."
StudentLoans,3chf68,Oneharryson,5,Tue Jul 7 22:51:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. Both federal and private student loans can be used for off-campus living expenses, assuming you are able to borrow enough money. Unfortunately, the annual limits on federal Stafford loans for dependent undergraduate students are very low so there isn't usually much (if anything) left over after your tuition is paid. Note that all student loans are disbursed to the school first, so your tuition/fees have to be paid in full before anything can be refunded to you for off-campus housing and other miscellaneous education-related expenses."

StudentLoans,3chy7v,xtrexjpsouz,2,Wed Jul 8 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"I had a whole long reply for you, but my phone deleted it. So here it goes again....  There is no harm in applying for UM, filling out FAFSA, and seeing where the chips fall.   However, there are some serious risks in going into teaching. 50% of teachers leave the classroom within 5 years. You're looking at taking on a low-income teaching position in an area that is unlikely to ever increase. Over $100,000 worth of loans is a very dangerous gamble, and it would make your entire life very difficult. It's a crippling amount of debt for what you're looking to make as a teacher in that area.   If you do end up as one of the 50% who leave, what is an elementary education degree going to do for you? Many of my former colleagues ended up getting jobs at textbook publishing companies or going back to school for law or nursing. It's not a very marketable major unless you're a very slick resume writer or have connections.   I would strongly suggest this path:  major in something perceived as valuable (Business is a popular degree because it is incredibly versatile) and minor in Spanish. If you aren't already bilingual, become bilingual. I'd suggest doing 2 years of community college, followed by 2 years of public in state college (or private if they award you more!). Graduate with a Business degree and Spanish minor.   Apply for TFA, Teach for America. I absolutely detest TFA on a political level, but it can hook you up really well. TFA is grueling. It is far more intense than most education programs. TFA will give you a summer training program and then help place you in a 2 year job. The Mississippi area has a huge TFA corp, so there's a reasonable chance you will be placed there. You can also pick cities like Chicago, NYC, Philly...   During those 2 years, you will work full time as a teacher and occasionally attend TFA classes. You will be paid as a teacher. You WILL be in a low-income area, this is guaranteed. You can take up to 5k for your student loans OR you can have your Master's degree paid for. GET THE MASTER'S DEGREE!!!! You'll have a BA in Business, you'll be fluent in Spanish, and you'll have a Master's in Education. This is a huge advantage to your peers. For one, if you ever decide to go into administration because you want to fix shit in the district instead of dealing with shit in the classroom, having an understanding of business is huge. You'd have a great spring board to get your license to be a superintendent (or principal/assistant principal).  If you hate teaching? You have serious options. You'll have experience as a leader, with organization, with serious long term planning. You'll also have that 2nd language and a business degree. You can do ANYTHING!  If you love teaching? Awesome. You have 2 out of 5 years working at a low income school. There are 2 programs for Teacher Loan Forgiveness/Cancellation. One will forgive $5,000 of Direct Loans to Elementary school teachers ($17,500 if you teach SPED...) and up to 100% forgiveness of any Perkins loans.   You can have a ton of loan forgiveness, if you play your cards right.   I've been teaching for 10 years and I love it. But I've watched a lot of friends quit to pursue other careers. I'd hate to see you back yourself into a corner financially and with a somewhat specialized degree."
StudentLoans,3chy7v,forever_lizzing,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"My question is, what loans are available to me?   Everyone qualifies for a few thousand dollars per year in federal loans. The rest of the money would have to come from grants, scholarships, Parent PLUS loans, or private loans. Parent PLUS loans and private loans are credit-based and require your parents' signature so they are not accessible to everyone.   How does loan forgiveness (specifically for teachers) work?   Only federal loans in your name would be eligible for forgiveness. It sounds like this is going to be a very small portion of your debt so you shouldn't even be thinking about this.   What are the different types of loans?   Federal Stafford loans - No credit check, made in the student's name, current interest rate is 4.29%. The total amount of Stafford loans available is the same for everyone; whether or not a portion of the loans are subsidized (interest-free during school) will be determined based on financial need.  Federal Perkins loans - No credit check, made in the student's name, current interest rate is 5%. These are need-based and only available to students with a low EFC.  Parent PLUS loans - Modest credit check, made in a parent's name, current interest rate is 6.84%. These are not need-based and are available up to your school's cost of attendance.  Private loans - Credit check, will most likely require a creditworthy cosigner, interest rate based on creditworthiness (assuming you qualify). These are also available up to your school's cost of attendance.   Is there anything else that can save me from severe debt after college is said and done?   Go to a cheaper school. Seriously, it's not worth it."

StudentLoans,3cdrhb,Betsy514,7,Tue Jul 7 18:33:18 2015 UTC,"The cost for our school is around $26,000 and her financial aid (FAFSA) is roughly $16,500.   Find a cheaper school. We would all love to have a BMW, but sometimes a Honda is all we can afford, and frankly, all we need."
StudentLoans,3cdrhb,skeach101,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:59:15 2015 UTC,"Yup, holy crap. 16k is plenty for a good state school."
StudentLoans,3cdrhb,ijustwantanfingname,3,Tue Jul 7 13:29:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on the state. In my state, 16k would cover only the (in-state) tuition and ""university fee"" with not much of anything left over for room & board, food, books, etc. And if you're planning to live on-campus it's all due upfront with the tuition each semester, to the tune of $4k for the cheapest dorm room + $2k for the cheapest on-campus-living meal plan. Per semester.  I'd suggest OP's GF look for a (much cheaper) room off-campus with roommates, because it's usually waaaay more comfortable than a dorm anyway, and you can hopefully forgo some of the luxuries a dorm forces on you (like cable TV) to save money. And since she'd be paying monthly, it's not due all upfront and she could use her part-time job to pay for it rather than needing loans to cover it.   Where I went to school there were tons of people renting out a room in an apartment or house for fairly cheap, on a month-to-month basis (no need to lock into a lease), though if you were willing to sign a 1yr lease you could get it even cheaper. She may need a cosigner for the room/lease, but that's a very different matter than cosigning on a $10k+ loan so they may be willing."
StudentLoans,3cdrhb,zeezle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:30:16 2015 UTC,"You still have to consider scholarships, etc. If there isn't a single university in your state that will cover at least some of your tuition, then you really goofed up in highschool."
StudentLoans,3cdrhb,ijustwantanfingname,4,Tue Jul 7 14:36:11 2015 UTC,"Don't co-sign for people. Your girlfriend is on the business end of some good advice, but it just means she has to lower costs or go to a school she can afford. Transfer credits to a cheaper school if she has to and continue her education there."
StudentLoans,3cdrhb,magik110,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:54:17 2015 UTC,I am not from the US so I don't understand why a parent wouldn't cosign for their kid's college loan. That too for one that seems very responsible financially.   Has she looked into lending club ? She might get a high interest rate but its a way out.
StudentLoans,3cdrhb,m1ss1l3,3,Tue Jul 7 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why a parent wouldn't cosign for their kid's college loan.   The kid doesn't necessarily have to be irresponsible for there to be problems with it for the parents. Cosigning for private loans carries a whole host of legal responsibilities that can be pretty serious.   For example, if the kid dies partway through college or repayment, the loan may be called up immediately for repayment by the cosigner or go into automatic default and destroy the cosigner's credit. (Not all lenders do this but some do.) Either way, they've still gotta pay. Or maybe it's with a lender who offers death discharge protections - but in that case, the cosigner will still have to pay taxes on the forgiven amount, which could still be thousands of dollars, and now it's due to the IRS instead of the lending institution.   There are some posts over in /r/personalfinance of these types of shenanigans going on with private loans (not just student loans, but a variety of loan types can have similar provisions). It's almost always best to avoid cosigning anything except small loans that you can fully repay yourself immediately.  That said, my mom did cosign a private loan for me when I was in school because the interest rate was much lower than federal unsubsidized loans, and everything worked out fine with that - it's repaid and done with, no hassle or problems. So of course the majority of the time it'll be fine. But there are risks to doing it and maybe her parents just aren't comfortable with taking them."
StudentLoans,3cdrhb,zeezle,3,Tue Jul 7 17:58:50 2015 UTC,I would also add that co-signing on student loans will increase the parent's overall debt-to-income ratio which could make it difficult for them to qualify for other loans in the future.
StudentLoans,3cdrhb,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:29:14 2015 UTC,I am not unaware of the responsibilities of a co-signer. What I don't understand is a parent not willing to take the risk for their children's future. Its not like the girl is majoring in political science or liberal arts where she won't get a job.
StudentLoans,3cdrhb,m1ss1l3,0,Wed Jul 8 01:34:27 2015 UTC,All that is fixed by a dirt cheap term life insurance policy.
StudentLoans,3ce15f,7004,4,Tue Jul 7 04:32:42 2015 UTC,"I have about $30,000 in federal loans and $30,000 in private, with an average interest rate of 5.7%  My wife and I make over $200,000 per year, own a home, have a pretty frugal budget, and save a lot. Outside of retirement savings, we aren't really saving for anything in particular right now.   Uh ... just pay them off as quickly as possible? $2k/mo, 3 years, give or take.  Refinance to a lower rate if you want, but I don't see why you'd drag the repayment out any longer than you needed to."
StudentLoans,3ce15f,ANGR1ST,-1,Tue Jul 7 08:00:36 2015 UTC,I'd rather save and invest (at hopefully a higher rate in the market) than pay off relatively low interest rate debt early.

StudentLoans,3ce15f,Battleant,3,Tue Jul 7 12:03:08 2015 UTC,The guy above was saying pay it off because paying off debt is the best kind of savings. What investments do you have with a guaranteed 5.7% return?
StudentLoans,3ce15f,frojoe27,2,Wed Jul 8 20:06:25 2015 UTC,If that is your only concern just choose the 10 year plan and figure out what monthly payment will make you finish in 9 years and pay that.

StudentLoans,3cda7z,RolandKa,8,Tue Jul 7 00:39:47 2015 UTC,"To put it in perspective, say the interest rate went up a .5% every month on the variable. that would take you to 9.75% at the end of one year. You'd still come out ahead assuming your payments are spread out equally (i.e. once/month) because the higher interest rates are running on a smaller balance.  Interest rates won't go that high for a long time."
StudentLoans,3cda7z,neegropleese,3,Tue Jul 7 00:51:39 2015 UTC,"I'd go for the variable, not much risk on a small balance and short time frame. I also wouldn't worry about it too much, difference is less than $100 if you pay the loan off in a year."
StudentLoans,3cda7z,frojoe27,2,Tue Jul 7 03:14:00 2015 UTC,I agree with this.. I mean $100 bucks is nice but that's like an extra $10 a month to pay it off.  But if you are truly confident go with the variable.
StudentLoans,3cda7z,AsSubtleAsABrick,2,Tue Jul 7 13:07:14 2015 UTC,"Variable rates aren't going to go up that much in a year.  Regardless, we're only talking about a ~$100 difference between those two rates over the next 12 months. Not sure how your current rate compares but it honestly might not even be worth the effort of refinancing this close to payoff."
StudentLoans,3ccish,RolandKa,4,Mon Jul 6 21:08:20 2015 UTC,"Only borrow what you need for the current school year. Interest starts accruing immediately after disbursement, so waiting a year to disburse the second half will save you a year's worth of interest on that portion of the loan.  Also, students are generally not allowed to borrow beyond their school's annual cost of attendance (COA). If you try to borrow everything all at once, there is a good chance you will exceed that limit.  Out of curiosity, is there a reason you are looking at private loans through Wells Fargo? Have you considered your federal options as well? I know the interest rates and origination fees on Grad PLUS loans are pretty steep, but the rates on unsubsidized Stafford loans are more reasonable (5.84% fixed)... and federal loans come with a lot more flexibility than private loans. Depending on how much debt you already have from your undergraduate program, that extra flexibility may come in handy."

Otherwise you'll be paying interest on 8k that will just be sitting in a savings account for a year. Also, not that this necessarily applies to you, but it would help avoid spending the money that shouldn't be spent."
StudentLoans,3ccrb4,M00Milk,7,Mon Jul 6 22:12:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused. Student loans aren't typically serviced by your school... they're serviced by private companies like Sallie Mae, Nelnet, Great Lakes, etc. Can you clarify exactly what kind of student loans these are (if they even are student loans)? Also, have you been making all of the payments on-time?"
StudentLoans,3ccrb4,xtrexjpsouz,3,Mon Jul 6 23:21:42 2015 UTC,Yeah this doesn't make any sense at all.  Who is the email from?  Can you PM us both the full email address?  Or screen shot the email and redact your personal info?
StudentLoans,3ccrb4,Betsy514,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:06:29 2015 UTC,"There is the exception for Perkins loans. Amidst my mountain of Great Lakes debt is a $4,000 Perkins loan that I pay directly to my school."

StudentLoans,3ccrb4,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:42:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. My $4,000 one was for a year and after that I wasn't eligible for them anymore. If you got one for four years, you could get around to OP's amount, but it is pretty unlikely."

StudentLoans,3ccrb4,xtrexjpsouz,5,Tue Jul 7 03:17:21 2015 UTC,"Your post still doesn't make any sense. Federal Stafford loans are NOT serviced by your school. FedLoan is your loan servicer; this is the company you should be making all of your loan payments to.  Regardless, there is no way that your school or even FedLoan can magically make 25% of your loan balance disappear. There are a handful of federal student loan forgiveness options out there (like PSLF) but these are things you have to actively pursue. Your loan servicer isn't going to just contact you out of the blue and say ""Hey, we're going to forgive a chunk of your loans for no reason.""  Can you send us a screenshot of what exactly you received (with any personal details blacked out)?"
StudentLoans,3cbwul,cbrems,5,Mon Jul 6 18:38:32 2015 UTC,"I would not bother refinancing the federal loans. Doing this will convert them to a private loan and make you completely ineligible for things like IBR/PAYE, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, hardship deferment, etc. You also have pretty good interest rates already so I don't think you're going to save a whole lot of money by refinancing this portion of your debt.  If you want to try and refinance your private loans, go for it... although TBH I'm not sure you're going to qualify without a cosigner given how high your overall debt-to-income ratio is right now. It also doesn't look like you're actually in repayment yet. Is that correct? If so, note that most lenders require at least 12 months of on-time payments before they will allow you to refinance.  Regardless of whether or not you end up refinancing, I would strongly recommend signing up for auto-debit through your loan servicers so you can take advantage of the 0.25% rate reduction. I believe SoFi automatically includes this discount in their advertised rates."
StudentLoans,3cbwul,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"No repayment as of yet. That's disappointing to hear that I may still need a cosigner!   I aspire to go back to school (nurse anesthesia), does anybody know if SoFi will allow loan deferment during that?"
StudentLoans,3cbwul,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:29:50 2015 UTC,"No, SoFi does not offer in-school deferment. The best they can offer is interest-only payments while you're in school. So hypothetically speaking, if you refinanced your $85K in debt down to a 5% interest rate (which may or may not be possible depending on your overall creditworthiness), you would still be on the hook for over $350 per month. So that's another reason to leave your federal debt alone."
StudentLoans,3ccswa,eaglessoar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:23:32 2015 UTC,"Any bank loan can vary based on whatever you two negotiate (but you're not negotiating that. they're offering and it's pretty much take it or leave it).  One of the LIBORs + a margin is a common benchmark. The Prime Rate + a margin is also a common benchmark.  There may be a clause in the loan that allows them to increase their margin, but it should be defined and specific if there is, i.e., ""miss a payment by 30 days or more and the margin increases to 5.75%""  PS - you might want to reinvestigate the rate you've been quoted. None of the USD LIBORs are 1% right now."

If her parents weren't required to file, there is an option that she can check off on the FAFSA that says as such.   Your friend will not be able to receive federal financial aid if her parents were required to file a tax return but have simply refused to do so.

StudentLoans,3camnv,Betsy514,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:13:19 2015 UTC,"If what you are saying is correct and the award money can only be applied to principal, I'm guessing the issue is that your PAYE payments are not high enough to cover all of the interest accruing from month to month. Is that correct? If so, you may have to pay off all of the outstanding interest before you can use the $500 award on one of your loans.  Assuming that is not feasible, I would suggest using that last $500 to take an extra class just for fun. Find something that interests you and go learn more about it for free."

StudentLoans,3c84nw,J-Hawks,7,Sun Jul 5 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"At the rate you're going right now, you can expect to graduate with about $60K in student loan debt. This isn't an absurd amount of debt... but it's still probably going to be a pain in the ass, especially given that you're taking out a mix of federal and private loans. (Federal loans come with a lot more flexible repayment options.)  The good news is that the amount you are allowed to borrow from the federal government will increase as you get farther into your program. The Stafford loan limits are $5,500 for first-year students, $6,500 for second-year students, and $7,500 per year after that. The bad news is that this still won't be enough to cover all of your costs.  If you don't have one already, I would strongly recommend picking up a part-time job so you can pay for more of your expenses out-of-pocket. Also, do whatever it takes to graduate on-time (4 years)."
StudentLoans,3c84nw,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"The reason it might be 5 years is because to take the CPA exam, in my state at least, you must take 150 credits.

Edit: Also, if you haven't already, shop around for auto insurance premiums and see if you can get something lower through a different company.

They even checked what township I was from because certain townships just put up scholarships for just from having permanent residence in their towns. All this stuff changes week to week in their office. You won't get as much help at the beginning of the semester due to everyone having issues running into their office at once but during the year just stop in at least once a week until your issues get worked out.

StudentLoans,3c268i,Super620,2,Sat Jul 4 12:21:13 2015 UTC,Well done. The key is to DECIDE to put your payoff on a schedule through an autograft with your bank. Some like to arrange for weekly or biweekly payments. This makes for smaller payments and a flatter cash flow throughout your month. Plus you can save more since the little partial payments go toward principal and reduces your debt faster.

StudentLoans,3c2rig,BackwardsTreadmill,2,Sat Jul 4 05:32:54 2015 UTC,You need to go to your school's website and find the cost information. It is usually nested somewhere under the admissions tab. That will give you the costs.
StudentLoans,3c2rig,mymourningwood,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"I was only approved for $3,750.00 per semester. That should (theoretically) cover my tuition and campus fees right?   $3,750 per semester is the maximum amount any dependent undergraduate student can borrow in federal Stafford loans. It has nothing to do with the cost of tuition at your particular school.   Should I get another private loan?   I don't know. You haven't told us how much your school actually costs or what types of financial aid (if any) you qualified for outside of federal student loans... but generally speaking, you should try to avoid private loans whenever possible. If you don't have one already, get a part-time job to help cover your expenses."
StudentLoans,3c155b,keicantus,3,Fri Jul 3 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"it has a 1.073% origination fee.   That is correct. Most federal loans have origination fees. AFAIK the only ones that don't are Perkins Loans, but I'm guessing you did not qualify for those. (These are need-based.)   Something else that is jibberish to me: Interest begins when the loan is disbursed.   Can you clarify what you don't understand about this statement? Student loans accrue interest on a daily basis. This will start happening immediately after you receive the loan money.  You will not be required to make any payments until 6 months after you graduate, but generally speaking, it is a good idea to voluntarily pay down the interest while you are in school to prevent it from capitalizing.   I'm still doing research, but I don't even know what percentage rates are good or bad.   Federal loans are not credit-based so the interest rates are the same for everyone. The current interest rate for undergraduate federal loans is 4.29% (fixed) which is an amazing rate for unsecured debt. You're not going to find a better deal anywhere else, especially when you consider all of the flexible repayment options available exclusively on federal student loans."

StudentLoans,3c155b,xtrexjpsouz,3,Fri Jul 3 21:27:02 2015 UTC,"Disbursement is when the federal government sends the loan money to your school. This usually happens a week or two before the beginning of the semester. Loans always go to the school first to pay for your tuition/fees. If there is money left over, your school will give the rest of the money to you for living expenses.  The origination fee is automatically taken out of the loan when it's disbursed. You won't have to do anything."

Transfer must be done while on active duty and the military member must serve 4 additional years on active duty after the transfer - so if he retired prior to 1 Aug 09, he was never eligible for the transfer option - not open for Veterans to do the transfer - this is by Law not VA rules as so many misbelieve.   2) CH35 DEA is a program for the spouse/children of 100% Permanent rated Veterans. This program does not pay tuition but does pay the student a monthly stipend.  For example: I retired in 2004 - so can not transfer any of my Post 9/11 GI Bill to my children but can use this for myself. I am rated 60% disabled by the VA so my spouse/children do not qualify for CH35 DEA."

Alternatively, if you worked really hard but lacked that characteristics that make a successful student, how do you plan on overcoming that in grad school?  I have had a lot of friends go into the medical field, and the only one who did so despite mediocre performance before medical school did so after working professionally for a while and going back to school and nailing his Prereqs.   You are about to go into a more challenging academic environment(unless the school is accepting you because it has significantly lower standards/educational quality/expectations for their own graduation) after not performing well in the last one.   I may be 100% wrong. You may have considered this way before deciding upon this school and have a great explanation for why you did not perform well in an easier environment but think it makes sense to borrow to compete in a much more challenging environment, but if you do not or have not even considered this I would take 30 steps back and start thinking through the basics of this decision."

We all anticipated better lives after college, whether that means a nice home, big family, running a company, painting amazing pictures, etc.  What makes your OP sound whiny is...at least you can afford your loans. But you want the luxury of affording your loans, having a nice house, having kids, meeting family/friend expectations...all without any stress. Life doesn't really work like that for us debtors given how shitty politicians have been to us.  Most people have done one of two things: Given up on their dreams and keep paying their loans (often until death), or given up on their loans and keep following their dreams. Many of us have had to make huge sacrifices, such as the ones you mention. Maybe ""whiny"" is harsh since you're just coming to grips with your (our) unfortunate situation, but realize that most people cannot even afford the interest on their loans.

StudentLoans,3bx7i4,nothingmeansnothing,2,Thu Jul 2 22:07:50 2015 UTC,"First question, am I dumb for even considering consolidation? I've heard all the talks about never ever consolidate federal loans because you lose the protections, but I don't think any of them help me.   Refinancing federal loans is a good idea for some people, and an absolutely terrible idea for others. If you have a solid emergency fund and are confident that you will never need any of the flexible repayment options associated with your federal loans, go ahead and consolidate through DRB.   Second question, considering I should be able to pay this off in 3-4 years, is the variable rate that risky of bet right now?   I wouldn't worry too much about it. Variable rates are going to start going up at some point in the near future, but I really don't think your rate is going to double in that short of a time frame. Just make sure you stick to your plan and don't stretch out repayment any longer than necessary."

Currently at 0.282 so it's about 2.93%. Signing up for auto debit lowers the rate by 0.25% so that almost takes care of LIBOR. Coming from a federal 6.8% rate, LIBOR would need to shoot up over 4% in order for the rate to be back to federal level (4 + 2.65). Everybody's situation is different, but I'll take my chances."

If you are a graduate student, you are considered independent on the FAFSA. If you have not already completed the FAFSA for the upcoming school year, you need to do this immediately.   My family (again, very lucky!) does not meet requirements for any sort of federal aid or loans (as far as I am aware) at about 200K household income.   Your parents' income does not matter because you are a graduate student. You do not need to include their information on the FAFSA. Regardless, graduate students generally aren't eligible for need-based aid: just unsubsidized Stafford loans and Grad PLUS loans.   Are there any obvious choices in companies for my loans, or perhaps more importantly, companies I should steer clear of?   Yes. Given that your tuition is only about $12K per year, you can cover the entire cost with unsubsidized Stafford loans which currently have a fixed interest rate of 5.84% and lots of flexible repayment options/protections.   Are early repayment fees something I need to wary of?   No. There are no prepayment penalties on student loans.   If I borrow more than I need, is it possible to return the extra to the company without accruing any interest? For example, if I get a job during school and I'm able to throw a couple grand into the pot for spring semester?   Yes. For federal loans, if you return the money within 120 days of disbursement, they will apply it as a refund - reversing any interest that accrued to date."

StudentLoans,3bw6hh,gradschool_dude,2,Thu Jul 2 17:27:28 2015 UTC,Rent seems way high. Parking seems way high. Restaurants and Personal entertainment is pretty high for borrowed money.  You can also work part time to alleviate some of your debt.
StudentLoans,3bw6hh,ANGR1ST,2,Thu Jul 2 20:58:28 2015 UTC,I'm curious to know where OP lives. That might explain the rent/parking costs. Restaurants and entertainment should definitely be a lot lower regardless of location.
StudentLoans,3bw6hh,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm a bit late on replying. The location is D.C.... I am moving there in a couple weeks, and I have to choose between living alone for $1200-1300 a month for a well located Studio, or $800-900 a month to room with someone in well located two-bedroom apartment. I decided it's worth the convenience and a million other reasons to pay extra to live alone in a studio.  Parking is $100-125 each month for an apartment parking spot, plus however much it costs me to park around the city on the occasions I drive somewhere.  I'm fine with restaurants cost, that's two decent/nice restaurants a week, which is about what I expect to do since I like going on lots of dates.  Entertainment I'm less certain about, especially since you said it should be lower. In my spreadsheet, it's sort of a catch-all for the rest of my expenses for games and other things. I don't have a good handle on how much I'll really spend, since my previous spending in this category is actually hard to quantify in good numbers, but I believe I spend much less than the normal person AND I thought what I listed was a relatively low number.

You said you don't have any prior debt, so why are you including monthly payments in your budget? Student loan payments are typically deferred while you are in school... and even if they weren't, the interest on $60K in debt ($30K per year) is going to be a heck of a lot more than $50 per month."

This isn't really helpful; Sallie Mae services both federal and private loans.  Were the loans awarded by your school based on the FAFSA, or did you apply directly through Sallie Mae with a cosigner? If you're not sure, check the NSLDS. If your loans appear on that website, they are federal. Otherwise, they are private loans which are generally not eligible for forgiveness/discharge.   I don't know If I'm considered permanently disabled I've been on it since I was 19   If you have already been disabled/unable to work for over five years and anticipate this will continue for at least five more years, there is a very good chance you would qualify for Total & Permanent Disability Discharge on federal loans.

Can you reach out to other family members? Is there a payment plan at school?   Private loans seem crazy. They arent dischargeable under public loan forgivness or nursing forgiveness. So no matter what you'd have to pay.   Try to think hard about the options.  Is there a way you can find a job as a nurses aid in the hospital?

Finished first Bachelor's degree, decided I wanted to to become a CRNA so went for BSN next. Did an accelerated BSN in 16 months, came out with about 50k in debt. Didn't really hit me until I got out of school how much 50k really is, especially when you get shit pay as an RN. So I'm gonna give you some advice: MAKE SURE THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO! Working in a hospital can be extremely stressful, especially if you are ER or ICU. As an RN you will have to do your own job, plus be expected to do a little of everything else (respiratory, lab, radiology, etc.). When I graduated 2ish years ago, I started at $18.75/hr, with my BSN; this was in a level 1 trauma center as well. At that hospital, the most I made was $23/hr, and that was only after I received my CCRN, was charging, and getting night shift diff. After realizing there was no fucking way to start getting out of debt with that kind of money, I started traveling....which I cannot recommend enough. I just started my second contract, and after taxes I'm taking home about $1200/week, and anything over 36 hrs/week I get paid $55/hr. If you want to make good money as a nurse, this is one of the few ways (to my knowledge) to do so. Anyway, I'm rambling. Long story short: it's a hard fucking job, infrequently rewarding depending on your area, and the pay is often less than stellar. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

You are expected to pay this money back, whether it's over 10, 20, or 30 years. You do this by living within a budget, and your budget reflects that you owe $250k somewhere else. I started out $130k in debt on IBR. Four years of making my minimum payment, I owed more than I had borrowed and realized sure, I could continue to make these low payments, but the debt will always be there and it will have tax implications later. I decided to start a budget and have poured a lot of extra money into my loan debt. Once you're out of residency, the trick is not to live on that $120k (or whatever) salary. Determine how much you need to send off to loans, and live off the difference. Small sacrifices add up. I'm not saying live like pauper... I don't! But I make sure that loan repayment is high on my priority list. I don't drive a 70k car or live in a 500k house.  I drive a decent car and my house fits my needs and budget. I still eat out.

Graduate students tend to have more debt than undergraduate students (for obvious reasons) and may or may not have the income to back it up. More debt = greater risk to lenders.
StudentLoans,3bmw0s,joejoe2213,2,Tue Jun 30 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"More debt = greater risk to lenders.   I don't have time to google the study, but default rates are lower for graduates with six figure student debt than for those with lower debt levels."

Still, one borrower defaulting on $100,000 of debt is worse than five different borrowers each defaulting on $10,000 of debt so just comparing the number of defaults or loan forgiveness applications without attaching a dollar value to them doesn't really make sense in this context."

The reason the fixed rates on loans have historically been cheaper than market rates, and still are generally lower today, is that the government is bearing a huge risk and subsidizing our(your) borrowing costs. The loans are done with basically no underwriting and freely given to some people who obviously are going to be unable to repay.  They simply decided they are going to subsidize graduate borrowers less and assign the loans higher rates. This is not a market driven decision where market analysis, costs, or default rates necessarily explain the decision.  You could look back at what government figures have said about why that difference exists, but there is no guarantee the answer is anything other than positive spin. Ultimately, it was decided and that was that."

You may be able to work out a payment plan, though private student loan companies are less willing to negotiate this with you because they aren't bound by many laws to be fair right now.  Good luck."
StudentLoans,3bnnjh,thetanpecan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:57:47 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they are federal loans. They were offers trough my university via fedloan.
StudentLoans,3bnnjh,xtrexjpsouz,2,Wed Jul 1 00:17:14 2015 UTC,"Are these federal or private loans?  If they're federal loans, you can rehabilitate or consolidate your way out of default. You cannot take advantage of any flexible repayment options (IBR, PAYE, deferment, forbearance, etc.) or qualify for additional federal financial aid until these loans are back in good standing.  If they're private loans, your best bet is to contact the lender and see if you can work out some sort of payment plan or settlement. Make sure you get everything in writing."
StudentLoans,3bnnjh,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:16:06 2015 UTC,"I'm certain they're federal loans since I got them through my university via fedloan.   As long as they're willing to work with me, I can make the payments. I just didn't have any source of income until a month ago."
StudentLoans,3bnnjh,aaronsweber,2,Wed Jul 1 00:19:07 2015 UTC,"I know it's too late for this, but had you contacted them and signed up for Income Based Repayment before the loans defaulted, you could have avoided trashing your credit and having to pay collection costs."

At that point your credit is tanked and you've been slapped with all kinds of late fees and maybe even wage garnishments.  For a Federal loan ... not so much. There's basically no reason for them to negotiate with you and give you a deal like that."
StudentLoans,3bju65,ANGR1ST,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:27:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply!  I didn't realize you had to be defaulted or a private loan. I'm still learning about the loans my younger, less informed & wise self took out, so I do apologize for being behind the learning curve!  Why don't federal loans have incentive for those kinds of deals?"
StudentLoans,3bju65,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:18:07 2015 UTC,"Why don't federal loans have incentive for those kinds of deals?   Because there is no statute of limitations on federal loans and they have the ability to garnish your tax refunds, wages, and Social Security until the debt is fully paid off.  It's much more difficult for private lenders to collect on defaulted debt. They can't take your tax refunds and they can only garnish your wages if they sue you first, which can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Private student lenders also have to comply with your state's statute of limitations, so if they don't sue you within a certain amount of time, the debt becomes pretty much uncollectible. Given the choice between a lump-sum payment or nothing at all, obviously they're going to prefer the lump-sum payment even if it's a fraction of the total balance."

StudentLoans,3bju65,herewehoagain,0,Tue Jun 30 18:01:25 2015 UTC,"Federal loans generally have the best interest rates and terms for borrowers.

If you really don't know who is servicing your Stafford loans, figuring this out should be your first step. The NSLDS will have this information.   I currently am employed making 45k (base salary) a year with full benefits. I make anywhere from $4-15k in bonuses yearly. There are biyearly evaluations to raise my pay as well.   This is good news. It sounds like there is a lot of potential for your financial situation to improve. You just have to get through the first couple of years.   I live at home and my only other expenses aside from a phone ($50/mo) is a car ($350/mo) and insurance ($115/mo).   I know this isn't /r/personalfinance but your car is costing you quite a bit of money. Any chance you could trade it in for something more affordable? Or at the very least, shop around for a lower monthly insurance premium?   Does anyone have any suggestions on how I should approach tackling these?   For the federal loans: At your current income, I don't think you're going to qualify for Income Based Repayment but you might qualify for Pay As You Earn. If your AGI is reported at $45K per year, this plan would reduce your monthly minimums on the Stafford loans to about $230 per month. Unfortunately, your bonuses could muck that up a bit... so you might have to settle for a graduated plan instead. Call your loan servicer for assistance.  For the private loans: Unfortunately, you're not going to have a lot of options here. It wouldn't hurt to contact Sallie Mae and ask about your options but they're probably not going to be very helpful... so your best bet is to minimize your other expenses (living at home is a good start) and put everything you can towards this debt. Anything you pay above the minimums should go towards the loan with the highest interest rate.  For both types of loans: Sign up for monthly auto-debit through your loan servicers. This will reduce your interest rates by 0.25% and hopefully reduce your risk of accidentally missing a payment."

Especially the last part, I did not know that was a thing.   Now I read making bi monthly payments can cut down on interest over the life of a loan. Is it possible to setup weekly or daily automatic payments?"
StudentLoans,3bkfpl,xtrexjpsouz,2,Mon Jun 29 23:58:41 2015 UTC,"No, auto-debit is monthly.  A lot of people hear about biweekly mortgage payments and think that paying more frequently will save them a bunch of money on interest, but it doesn't. The only reason biweekly payments are beneficial is because there are 52 weeks in a year - not 48 - so by making half-payments every 2 weeks, you end up making the equivalent of an extra month's payment every year. You can make extra payments any time you want; no need to mess around with your regular monthly payment schedule.  If you want to save money on interest, you have to pay more than the minimums... or find a way to refinance at a lower interest rate. There's no real trick to it."

Chalk it up as a bad investment and take the losses.  You cannot afford a car payment, period.   You are living above your means.  You are poor, you can't have a nice car.   If you choose carefully (I recommend chevy,) you can find a good $6000 car.  You might have to save a while before you can afford this.   Get a pay as you go phone also.  My phone payment is $5.00 a month.   I use wifi calling when at home (hangouts dialer for android/google voice)  Learn to bake bread, it will save you a lot of money in food.

I get that I am missing out on a few thousand towards my loan each year with this car but there are other ways I can pay off these loans. Like getting a second job, which I have done just this past week."
StudentLoans,3bkfpl,rvtjess,2,Fri Jul 10 03:58:23 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do with private loans through Sallie Mae. You should still call them and say you're going through a financial hardship, what are your repayment options? Chances are likely they'll just tell you ""sorry!"".  Your federal loans, on the other hand, you do have repayment options for. Call and apply for an ""income based repayment"" plan, or ""pay as you earn"". This is typically something you renew annually but can help drastically reduce your minimum payment to something more manageable in proportion to your income. Sallie Mae MAY have some of your federal loans, so if they do, absolutely call and ask about repayment options."
StudentLoans,3bkamr,bigjakegator,5,Mon Jun 29 22:30:48 2015 UTC,"In order to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), you have to be on an income-driven repayment plan like Income Based Repayment or Pay As You Earn. Your eligibility for this type of repayment plan will depend entirely on your income.  Quite honestly, with only $17K in loans and about 9 years left before forgiveness would kick in, I can't imagine you would actually benefit from PSLF. Anything you would have forgiven at that point would just be unnecessary interest you racked up from reducing your monthly payments. So I would just pay off the debt ASAP and be done with it."
StudentLoans,3bkamr,xtrexjpsouz,5,Mon Jun 29 23:05:53 2015 UTC,My question is which option allows me to pay back the least amount of money?   Probably cutting them a check for $17k today.

If you graduated in May, the final paperwork at the school to determine which students graduated and which didn't may not even be completed yet. If that's the case the school wouldn't update the system that tells the lenders when you graduated.  I technically graduated in April, but the last semester I was ""enrolled"" was the Fall, so as far as the loans were concerned I left school in December. Took until early March for my lenders to be notified.  I'd call the registrar at school first, and ask them. What you don't want to do is call your lender, switch your status, and then have the automated system switch you back to in-school because the registrar hasn't updated everything yet."

Federal student loans are considered financial aid, despite the fact that you have to pay them back.   And if so, where else could I go to get student loans?   You would have to get them from a private lender like Sallie Mae, Discover, Wells Fargo, etc. Note that private loans are credit-based and would most likely require a cosigner."
StudentLoans,3biamu,masonjar11,7,Mon Jun 29 13:25:51 2015 UTC,"Payments to federal student loans are always applied in the following way:   Outstanding fees (normally none) Outstanding interest (accrues daily) Principal balance   By not advancing the due date, you are actually robbing yourself of some flexibility in the future because the payment will be applied the same way regardless of your choice.  Other than that, when you have money available, make sure to pay sooner rather than later.  Interest accrues daily based on the following formula:   Interest accrued = Principal balance x days since last payment x (1/365 x APR)   Paying sooner means that future interest will be calculated off a lower principal balance, which saves you money."
StudentLoans,3biamu,akaSpac3,2,Mon Jun 29 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"/u/akaSpac3 is correct. Checking the box for ""do not advance due date"" will not change the order in which your payments are applied. Outstanding interest must always be paid before principal."

StudentLoans,3bj8ap,aaronsweber,3,Tue Jun 30 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"Rather than deferment, can you switch to an extended plan? If you qualify for those they'll drop your monthly minimums and preserve your deferment/forbearance (which is limited).  Literally anything could happen in the future. Medical emergency that requires a lot of money, car accident that leaves you renting until your insurance pays you back, house fire - same thing for a hotel."
StudentLoans,3bjzmn,highfivepsh,2,Mon Jun 29 21:06:43 2015 UTC,Anything Federal like the Grad Plus loan can't be disbursed until classes start.   The same rules might apply to a majority of Private Educational loans as well.

No. Any student loans you apply for and accept would be disbursed at the beginning of the semester (maybe a week or two before, but not sooner than that). The idea is to prevent students from using their loan money to pay for vacations and other expenses unrelated to their education.  I think your best bet is to ask your girlfriend for help getting through the next couple of months. You said she's understanding, so hopefully it won't be an issue - especially if you promise to pay her back after the semester starts.  If that doesn't work out, here are a few other options:   Ask a family member for help Apply for a personal loan (may require a cosigner) Put some of your expenses on a credit card"

Do what other people are saying and borrow enough from people you know to cover you until you pay them back in 2-3 months, or rack up temporary debt on your credit card until the loans come in."

Other income-driven plans exclude the spouse's income if the couple files taxes separately. Exceptions will be made for victims of domestic violence.   That's extremely punitive... might make sense to just stay on IBR if the forgiveness provision is the same @ 25 years."
StudentLoans,3bfwu8,Betsy514,5,Mon Jun 29 02:43:01 2015 UTC,It's not punitive - it's a budget thing. They're hoping that eventually this will be the only income driven plan (for new borrowers - they will grandfather in existing borrowers for existing plans if this happens) and they've figured out they can't afford to do so without some caveats like this.

StudentLoans,3bfsh7,Gnarmac,7,Sun Jun 28 21:01:25 2015 UTC,"My (and my husband's) loans are in deferment too, and when we were buying our house last year, the bank by default wanted to assume that we'd be paying 2% of the loan balance per month. This would have made it look like we had crazy high debt payments, so we had to get estimates of the actual payments. For the preliminary stuff, the bank was able to estimate this based on the total loan balances, but for the final approval, we needed to get letters from our loan servicers.  The one thing to note is that -- in my understanding -- FHA loans allow you to not have your student loans ""count"" towards your monthly debt payments while the loans are in deferment. So if you're having trouble meeting debt-to-income requirements, this might be an option."
StudentLoans,3bfsh7,lucid_lemur,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:46:15 2015 UTC,Unfortunately this lender is telling me she's required to count 4% of my loan balance is paid monthly. Absolutely absurd.
StudentLoans,3bfsh7,lucid_lemur,2,Mon Jun 29 01:07:57 2015 UTC,"That is really crazy. We considered several different mortgage lenders, and none of them said anything about having to assume a student loan payment schedule -- it was just done automatically before we provided them with the actual payment schedules. It seemed like a pretty standard procedure when I called my student loan servicer to get them to send a letter outlining my future payment terms.  Is your lender perhaps not really familiar with student loans? You might have to educate them, or maybe consider switching lenders. I know that at the first bank we looked at (the one that was assuming 2%), the loan officer didn't even mention the student loan thing. I only realized it after looking at the credit report that the bank pulled. But then the lender that we ended up with was -- for whatever reason -- very informed about the whole procedure. He told me exactly what I'd need to get from my loan servicers, and how to ask them for it. (Our situation got a little complicated, so I'm glad I found someone who knew what they were doing.)"
StudentLoans,3bfsh7,rosythewench,3,Mon Jun 29 15:36:46 2015 UTC,"If your loans are federal, you can automatically upload your information into the studentloans.gov repayment calculator. That should provide you with an accurate estimate that you can print out and give to your loan officer."

The extended plan is not actually on your list of options because you don't have at least $30,000 of debt.  You should probably wait until you are actually employed to make a decision... but your safest bet would be to take advantage of the $0/month minimums on Pay As You Earn while you can. (Note that this minimum will increase significantly after you get a job.) Once you are employed and have established an emergency fund, pay as much towards the loans as you can afford so you don't end up racking up a lot of unnecessary interest."

StudentLoans,3be8f6,concerned_coder,5,Sun Jun 28 11:56:58 2015 UTC,"Are these private or federal loans? With federal loans you can apply for income based repayment where you submit your AGI from the previous tax year and they calculate payments based off that. You renew annually.  With private loans, it depends on the lender. Some may have repayment options for financial hardship, but others offer nothing.  I would call your loan servicer and ask what your options are."
StudentLoans,3be8f6,rvtjess,2,Sun Jun 28 13:47:42 2015 UTC,"It sounds like these are federal loans. Is that correct? If so, what type of repayment plan are you on?  If you were enrolled in an income-driven plan like IBR or PAYE, note that these types of plans have to be renewed annually (with updated income information). If you don't renew the plan, your payments will revert back to the equivalent of the 10-year standard plan."

StudentLoans,3bceto,ANGR1ST,4,Sat Jun 27 22:25:14 2015 UTC,"Perkins loans do not accrue interest while you are in school.  A few other things to consider about Perkins loans:  They are not eligible for IBR or PAYE. If you want to use this type of repayment plan on all of your loans after you graduate, you will need to consolidate the Perkins loan with at least one other federal loan.  They are usually serviced by your school. All of your other federal loans will be serviced by a separate company like Sallie Mae, Nelnet, Great Lakes, or FedLoan. Having multiple loan servicers is not the end of the world but I've seen quite a few posts here in /r/studentloans from people who ""forgot"" they had a Perkins loan and accidentally defaulted on it. This is obviously not a good thing. So if you do go with the Perkins loan, make sure you stay organized and don't lose track of it.  They may be eligible for cancellation if you become a teacher. More info here."

StudentLoans,3bcznj,kimodra,8,Sun Jun 28 01:26:34 2015 UTC,"How is it that student loans are allowed to charge so much interest?!   Because they're unsecured debt. 6% is nothing compared to the rates on other types of unsecured debt like credit cards and personal loans.   It blows my mind that our car loan is only 2.25% interest but for college it's so much more.   Car loans are secured loans. If you stop paying, the lender can take your car away and sell it to pay off the remaining balance. They cannot take your degree/education if you stop paying your student loans.   Also, why do lenders make it so hard to see just how much you have actually paid them, it's like they didn't want us to know how much they were charging us.    Most student lenders issue a 1098-E at the end of every tax year which shows the total amount of interest paid during that year. Did your husband not receive these? He also should have received monthly statements which showed how much of each payment went to interest vs. principal."

It blows my mind that our car loan is only 2.25% interest but for college   You're comparing apples-to-oranges. The 25% is total, over the life of the loan. The 2.25% for your car is PER YEAR.  If your car loan is $20,000 for 5 years at 2.25%, you'll pay $1,165 in interest over the life of the loan.... so 5.8% of the principal.  The student loan rates were probably higher (5-9%) and you took 10 years to pay them off. At 6% for 10 years, the total interest would be 33% of the principal.  Make sense?"

StudentLoans,3bb3j8,GodlessWatermelon,12,Sat Jun 27 14:54:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, paying off loans if you have the cash is often the most economically effective decision, but it depends on the interest rate of the loans. The correct way to look at it is to think of the loan repayment as an investment with a return roughly equal to the interest rate of the loan. Imagine you have $10k to spend - you could invest it in the stock market with average returns in the 7%-9% range and a lot of volatility, or you could pay off your private loan with a guaranteed 9% return. You'd be crazy not to put it in the loan instead of the market.  What you should probably do is maintain an emergency fund of 3-6 months worth of expenses, a bit of extra savings to help you get a car when this one dies, and then put the rest of the available money toward your loans, highest interest rate first. Don't look at monthly payment amounts, look at interest rates - that's how you will save the most money in the long run."

StudentLoans,3bb3j8,RousseauTX,3,Sat Jun 27 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much exactly the average annual return of the US equity market over the past 145 years, so I'd say it's about as typical as any one number can be. It's a bit low if you are looking at more recent times - the average return of the S&P 500 over the past 45 years is about 10.5%. Take a look at this calculator if you want to select your own time period.  Of course, there is not really any 'typical' return over a short time period as the volatility is very significant."

StudentLoans,3bb3j8,RousseauTX,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:40:04 2015 UTC,It makes zero sense to inflation-adjust the return when you are comparing to a non inflation-adjusted loan. So why would we be talking about inflation-adjusted returns? The returns have been ~9% annualized.
StudentLoans,3bb3j8,EvilNalu,2,Sat Jun 27 18:44:29 2015 UTC,"Of course it makes sense. You're comparing actual ROI of an equity investment (which should be adjusted for inflation in order to get true data) to a non-inflation adjusted interest rate in a loan. That was you'll be comparing actual to actual.  (Sorry, on mobile)"
StudentLoans,3bb3j8,RousseauTX,2,Sat Jun 27 18:48:51 2015 UTC,"You made me second guess myself a bit but I still don't understand why you compare inflation-adjusted returns on the investment to non inflation-adjusted loan payments. I think it's apples to oranges and the correct comparison is just to use the annualized return for both.  It probably makes sense to adjust the investment downward a bit for taxes, but I don't see how it makes sense to inflation-adjust the returns on investment without also inflation-adjusting future loan payments if you are trying to compare the two options."
StudentLoans,3bb3j8,EvilNalu,6,Sat Jun 27 19:23:33 2015 UTC,"I think both you guys are arguing over technicals that aren't prevalent to the OP's question. I believe anyone would be crazy to gamble in the market when having debt. Even biased brokers/dealers themselves advise not speculating with money you can't afford to lose...which is every penny when you have student debt.  I would take a guaranteed return via debt payoff over speculating with the stock market any day. There is just too much counter-party risk investing in the market these days. Sure, returns can be phenomenal, but it's not guaranteed by any measure and going belly up is equally likely.  By the way, I believe many loans are inflation adjusted. That's exactly what a variable interest rate is. Inflation rises, rates rise, variable rates rise, the debt becomes more valuable to the bank and more difficult for the borrower to pay down. We're living on borrowed time with low rates now, it won't last forever. That is, pay off variable rate loans now while you can."

StudentLoans,3bb3j8,ANGR1ST,4,Sat Jun 27 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"Options:   Snowball - Use extra money to payoff lowest balance debt first. This makes people feel good by is NOT financially optimal. Avalanche - Use extra money to payoff highest interest debt first. This is a a much BETTER financial decision, because total interest paid will be lowest. Modified avalanche - as above with a few twists.    Make sure you're contributing enough to maximize your 401k match. After all, a 25-100% year-1 return is waaaayyyy more than 4-9% interest. If you have low-interest loans (<~5%), consider slow-paying them in order to maximize tax-advantaged investments (e.g. IRA/401k). Why? The market has historically returned >8%/yr over any 30-year period, which equates to around 5%/yr after-tax returns, depending on your tax situation. Why not? Carrying large amounts of debt reduces your flexibility and increases your risk/sensitivity to losing income (unemployed/disabled/etc). At 7-9%, this wouldn't apply; you should get your max match only. For example: I have loans at <2% variable with an option to fix them at ~3.5%. I will NEVER pay extra on those, because I can earn much more than that with safe investments (low-fee, no-load, index funds)."

This is kind of a contradiction. I mean, yes, you can refinance your loans to a lower interest rate... but if you really want to pay these loans off quickly, you're going to have to start paying more than the minimums. Even if all of your loans were completely interest-free, it would take you over 10 years to pay off the loans at your current monthly payment of $1,075.  With that in mind, if you are able to refinance the FirstMark and Navient loans at a lower interest rate, that will help. Just don't get your hopes up too high - not everyone is creditworthy enough to qualify for a refinance. Do you have someone willing to cosign for you? This would improve your chances."

StudentLoans,3bbdam,ohsemantics,5,Sat Jun 27 16:25:57 2015 UTC,"This freaked me out with nelnet. I set up auto payments before I went into repayment, then the first month the due date fell on a Saturday. When I looked Sunday it showed as overdue. I called them and they explained that if the payment is initiated on a weekend it will show past due until processed, but then will show as an on time payment.   Probably the same thing happening here but call them and ask so you don't have to worry.   Also I don't think there is really any huge risk in a single payment being a day or two late.  I don't know that as a fact in relation to loan forgiveness though."
StudentLoans,3bbdam,frojoe27,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:57:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I did some Googling on the IBR issue, and you have to make 25 years of payments, but they seemingly don't have to be consecutive or on-time. If you make 25 years worth of payments in 50 years, your loans are forgiven in year 50.  I'm also fairly confident that submitting by the due date is likely an on-time payment--just based on my experience with credit cards and other bills. It seems like the only reasonable policy."
StudentLoans,3bbdam,ANGR1ST,3,Sat Jun 27 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  When payments are due on a weekend or non-business day, you can submit them on the next business day.

Yes. All student loans are disbursed to the school first and then whatever is left after tuition, fees, on-campus housing, etc. will be refunded to you.    How exactly does it work and what can I use the money for? I would mostly need it for food and housing and spending money since I can't get a job   Student loans can be used for basic living expenses like food, housing, transportation, health insurance, etc. Your school will come up with an estimate of the total tuition and living costs they consider acceptable for their students (Cost of Attendance). You will not be allowed to borrow beyond your school's COA.   Will I get the money as soon as I get approved?   No. It takes a while for loans to be fully processed and IIRC financial aid (including student loans) generally cannot be disbursed more than 2 weeks before the start of the semester. I imagine this is to prevent students from using their student loans to pay for their summer vacation and other non-education related expenses.   I will be moving out there a month before classes start and if I need the money for rent will I have it in time?   Probably not. Given that your parents are offering to give you a pretty significant amount of money for school, I would suggest using some of that money for your initial food/housing expenses."

Are you absolutely sure you will never need any of the flexible repayment options or protections associated with your federal loans? These are the kinds of questions you need to ask yourself before deciding whether or not to refinance federal student loans through a private lender.   I've also considered the idea of consolidating my private, and putting the public loans on deferment and throwing 100% of extra cash to the private loan. Can't really figure out how to do the math to see if this would make monetary sense, can any body help me here?   This wouldn't make sense from a mathematical standpoint. After refinancing your private loans, the federal loans will have the highest interest rate so they are the ones you would want to pay off first.  Also, you aren't going to qualify for deferment with $50,000+ in income. You might be able to get a forbearance but interest will continue accruing during this time and then capitalize.

StudentLoans,3b8kdt,MJGSimple,3,Sat Jun 27 00:09:02 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't matter how much OP is paying. His payments are still getting processed once a month. It really doesn't matter if that's the 15th or the 16th."

StudentLoans,3b8o3l,Mrfelatio,4,Fri Jun 26 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"AFAIK all student loans (federal and private) accrue interest daily. It may just be that the private loan servicer displays that information differently on their website, adding up the accrued interest monthly vs. displaying the changes daily.  When you say both sets of loans are on a 20-year repayment plan, are you absolutely sure they're the same type of plan? I'm wondering if your federal loans might be on PAYE. If that is the case, it's entirely possible that you are not paying enough to stay on top of the accruing interest each month."
StudentLoans,3b8o3l,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:43:52 2015 UTC,You might be right.  It's not PAYE.  We earn too much money.  These old fed loans were set up a few years ago and I just stretched them out as long as they would go.  I just didn't expect the principle to increase while I'm paying it off.  It's enough to make me just roll them over to a private loan so I know what the schedule is going to be.
StudentLoans,3b8o3l,xtrexjpsouz,3,Fri Jun 26 21:52:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, well you need to figure out exactly what type of repayment plan you are on and consider changing it if you're not happy. You don't need to refinance out of the federal program to switch repayment plans.  Alternatively, you could just pay extra every month. There are no prepayment penalties on student loans."
StudentLoans,3b8o3l,leoele,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I really was asking to see if anyone knew if there was some reason why federal loans apply interest daily when it ""appears"" that my private loans do not, and operate on a fixed schedule that I can understand."

StudentLoans,3b8o3l,ANGR1ST,2,Sat Jun 27 21:05:46 2015 UTC,The Federal loans have simple interest that accrues every day.   What exact repayment plan are you on? Some options are effectively interest only early on. With a 20 year term you're going to pay a lot in interest over the long term and it's going to take a long time for the balance to start moving quickly. Can you pay more now?
StudentLoans,3b8o3l,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:42:42 2015 UTC,"That's the thing.  i've been paying on the loan for years and it seems to decrease maybe a hundred dollars in principle every YEAR.  When I plug the numbers into a loan calc, there is no way it will be paid off over the 20 year period.  The only reason I pay the min on these is that I pay more on the higher interest private loans."
StudentLoans,3b75k0,battysays,4,Fri Jun 26 14:49:27 2015 UTC,"For private loans? You're pretty boned.  IF you were able to increase your income to about $60k/yr, you could probably afford the full repayment on the debt. Or at least close to it. Any possibilities on that front?  You could try to wait out the SoL on the debt in your state, from the last time you made a payment ... but that might be quite a while. And they still might sue/garnish.

It wouldn't bring me to $60k though. I also take on freelance work outside of my full time job, graphic design and photography mostly, but also writing, editing, and I've even been pet sitting for the past week for a couple local families.  I'm more than happy to work and pay this off. I'm running myself ragged working constantly, I just want to be done with it. How low do you think they'd be willing to negotiate? I technically have two loans, so it has to be two payments a month they said...they were trying to get me to do $250 x 2 every month, and that's just not going to happen. I'll keep working on it if there's a chance they'll lower it even more, but they do not budge at all so far. It's like talking to a wall when I've said countless times that no, I can't just send over a few thousand dollars right now.

StudentLoans,3b75k0,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jun 26 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you don't have a whole of options with private loans. Income Based Repayment is a federal program and private lenders are not obligated to offer anything similar.  While the $24,000 settlement they offered you is obviously much better than paying $120,000, I understand even that may not be a realistic amount (especially if they expect it to be paid all at once). You can try negotiating the balance down even further, but if you can't make it work, you can't make it work.  Not sure if they have actually sued you for wage garnishment at this point but keep in mind that private lenders DO have to obey your state's statute of limitations... and most negative items fall off your credit report after 7 years, so you may be better off not paying them anything at this point. (Unfortunately, the fact that you paid them $1,500 probably reset the clock on the SOL for your debt.)"

Check this list to see if the school you are attending participates in the federal student loan program. If so, you can complete the FAFSA and pay for your degree with federal loans (Unsubsidized Stafford and Grad PLUS loans).  Otherwise, you'll have to try a private lender like Sallie Mae or Discover.

Regardless of the credit card churning, you're probably going to have a hard time qualifying for a private student loan on your own due to lack of income and a relatively short credit history.  EDIT: Have your parents tried applying for a Parent PLUS loan? Given that they recently filed bankruptcy, they will probably be denied. This would make you eligible for additional unsubsidized Stafford loans."

The issue is, the amount of unsubsidized was like $3000/ semester less than the parent plus loan. I think my only chance is with the local credit union. I already had a $5000 auto loan with them that I did without a co-signer. That loan is currently paid off in full."
StudentLoans,3b76d1,xtrexjpsouz,4,Fri Jun 26 15:16:01 2015 UTC,"I already had a $5000 auto loan with them that I did without a co-signer.    You cannot compare an auto loan with a student loan. Auto loans are secured by the car you purchase. If you stop paying your auto loan, the lender can take away your car. Student lenders cannot take away your degree/education. These are unsecured loans; that's why they require a cosigner."

StudentLoans,3b56hk,LegendaryFart,2,Fri Jun 26 01:41:34 2015 UTC,"I feel that the interest ratest and origination fees on PLUS to be a little high. Some states  offer private loans with better rates than PLUS. For example, NJ has a loan for NJ residents or non NJ residents attending a New Jersey college called NJCLASS. The rates are lower and the loan is in the student's name, but you might need a parent to co sign. The repayment terms are not as generous  (deferring payments is harder). But this might be an option to consider. Check your state's guarantee agency and that of the school you will be attending to see if they offer something similar. If they don't, then yes, PLUS is your best option."
StudentLoans,3b56hk,paramapotomus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:13:52 2015 UTC,Have you already maxed out your federal Stafford loan (subsidized/unsubsidized) options? These are much less expensive than PLUS loans.

StudentLoans,3b553j,Wellbie,4,Fri Jun 26 01:29:19 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Generally speaking, federal loans are offered on an annual basis without much consideration of how much you borrowed in previous years. However, there are aggregate limits on federal loans so if you take more than four years to finish your degree, you could end up hitting that limit.  Also note that the most you will be allowed to take in Stafford loans will be $7,500 per year when you transfer to the four-year school... which is obviously not going to be enough. I would strongly recommend looking into some other options (grants, scholarships, part-time work, Parent PLUS loans, etc.) between now and then so you don't end up scrambling at the last minute."
StudentLoans,3b553j,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:15:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this clears it up a bit for me!  So it looks like 57.5k is the aggregate limit for me.

(I'm at 2.99 right now.)  Sounds like I'd better try to squeak by without the loan this year and save it for later on.   Again, thank you for your response, I appreciate it!"

StudentLoans,3b4vy4,aaronsweber,2,Fri Jun 26 12:32:10 2015 UTC,"If you are in a desperate situation with student loans, call the servicer and tell them. DO NOT ignore them! There are options to manage it, but it requires that you take action.  First off, ask about an income-driven payment plan. If you have a low income - and it sounds like you do - then the payment can be very low. Like, $0 low. If you don't qualify for that, ask about deferment or forbearance."
StudentLoans,3b50qz,touchmydongle,4,Fri Jun 26 00:51:44 2015 UTC,You only have about $26k in loans in your name. I really doubt that IBR+ PSLF is going to help you much if you're reasonably employed. Just pay your debt off aggressively and be done with it.
StudentLoans,3b50qz,ANGR1ST,2,Fri Jun 26 05:24:07 2015 UTC,"Most likely, yes, you will qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness on your federal loans.   I will be speaking with her about public service loan forgiveness (she works for the city office as a billing clerk) as well as income based repayment to lower the payments, but (correct me if I'm wrong) the loans in her name do not affect the rest of my situation.   You are correct that her loans will always be separate from your loans. They cannot be consolidated together and any eligibility for things like PSLF or income-driven repayment would have to be based on her income and employment situation, not yours.  A couple of other things to note: Parent PLUS loans are not eligible for Income Based Repayment (IBR). They can be eligible for a similar plan, Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) but only if they are consolidated first.  Your mother also needs to get out of default before she can switch repayment plans and get on track for PSLF. Consolidation would actually pull the loans out of default by itself... but rehabilitation would be a better option for her credit. You may want to read up on the basics of Getting Out of Default before doing anything else."
StudentLoans,3b50qz,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jun 26 12:28:50 2015 UTC,Just to clarify this - while you will likely qualify for PSLF - you will also likely pay the loan off before forgiveness kicks in
StudentLoans,3b50qz,Betsy514,2,Fri Jun 26 13:10:31 2015 UTC,"OP said they are only paying $100 per month on IBR right now (compared to ~$250 per month on the standard plan). Since the monthly payments on IBR can never exceed the payments on the 10-year standard plan, why wouldn't he qualify for forgiveness after 10 years?  I'm not saying this is necessarily the smartest thing to do, given that most of the forgiven balance will probably be interest that could have been avoided with a more aggressive repayment plan, but just wondering why you don't think anything would be forgiven at all."
StudentLoans,3b50qz,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jun 26 13:34:56 2015 UTC,Because OP's income is very likely to increase over time.
StudentLoans,3b50qz,Betsy514,2,Fri Jun 26 13:38:00 2015 UTC,"Right, but even if OP's income skyrocketed, the monthly minimums are capped at the equivalent of the 10-year standard plan. So wouldn't the first year or two of low payments guarantee something will be forgiven (assuming OP doesn't have any gaps in qualifying employment between now and then)?"
StudentLoans,3b50qz,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jun 26 13:39:12 2015 UTC,"I suppose it could - but unless that happened after several years of very low payments the amount forgiven will probably outweigh the ""extra"" interest OP will pay be stretching it out.  I'm not trying to dissuade people from PSLF at all - but with this low of a loan balance, unless OP's income stays very low, it may not be the best overall financial decision to doggedly pursue."
StudentLoans,3b50qz,Betsy514,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:04:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. So a little bit of IBR and PSLF is going to always be at least a little cheaper than taking the standard 10 year plan.  BUT that doesn't mean that it's going to be cheaper than an aggressive repayment plan. $26k at 5% is about $7k in interest over a 10 year term. Paying it off in 5 years instead would save roughly half that interest, which may very well be less expensive overall than IBR/PSLF if OP ends up back at the 10 year level quickly."
StudentLoans,3b50qz,ANGR1ST,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If they can pay down the loans more aggressively, that would probably make more sense financially... but given that OP has other loans to deal with (private and Parent PLUS) that may not be possible, at least for now."

Edit: Also, these rates are quite good. You might consider at least topping off your 401k and IRA instead if you aren't already. You should easily be able to beat those rates with market returns."
StudentLoans,3b4tl6,NotPankakes,2,Fri Jun 26 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"OP's rates may be good now, but anything that low is pretty much guarantee to be a variable rate. Variable rates are currently at historic lows and have nowhere to go but up. I'm not opposed to increasing 401k/IRA contributions while the rates are still low, but OP needs to be cognizant of the fact that the student loans are going to get more and more expensive the longer they are dragged out."

StudentLoans,3b3084,ANGR1ST,2,Thu Jun 25 16:41:11 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, trying to pay for college without any parental support is going to be an uphill battle. The annual limits on Stafford loans are very low ($7,500 per year for upperclassmen), Parent PLUS loans have to be in a parent's name, and you're probably not going to qualify for private loans without a co-signer.  If you can find a way to establish residency in Oregon, that would certainly help. Be sure to check the requirements for that state so you don't spend a year living there only to find out you're still considered an out-of-state student.  Aside from that, you need to get a job ASAP (assuming you don't already have one) and apply for every scholarship you can when you're ready to transfer."
StudentLoans,3b3084,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"What's the major?  Firstly, make sure that Oregon is a 1 year for student residency state. Some aren't and may not declare you a resident for student tuition purposes until 4 or more years.  Secondly, you can still apply for federal aid, including grants and loans. You'll need to include your parents' financial information, and it will affect what you're eligible for, but what you're eligible for (with the exception of parent loans) would be in your name. You don't need a cosigner for a lot of that type of loan aid.  Alternately, you can work for awhile and wait til you're 24, because then you don't have to include parents' income on the FAFSA and you'll probably be in way better shape with what you get for grants and aid."

StudentLoans,3aykdy,iyambrando,9,Wed Jun 24 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"It usually takes a few weeks for IBR/PAYE applications to be fully processed. In the meantime, your loan servicer will most likely put you into administrative forbearance so you don't have to worry about missing any payments while the application is processing.  EDIT: Just wanted to add, I know this isn't what you asked, but make sure you are cognizant of the impact that getting married will have on your monthly IBR/PAYE payments. If you file taxes jointly, your combined monthly minimums will go up because there is an assumption that married couples have more discretionary income than two single people. Filing taxes separately would reduce your monthly minimums but most likely cost you more money in income taxes. You'll have to run the numbers to decide which filing status makes more sense for your situation."
StudentLoans,3aykdy,xtrexjpsouz,4,Wed Jun 24 15:20:06 2015 UTC,This is exactly what IBR/PAYE are intended for. A short term solution to help you out for cash flow until your job improves.

Am I correct in assuming that w/ the huge forgiveness amount at the end of the 25 years (in her case around $500k at her current rate of income growth) comes a huge tax burden from the IRS calling it income?"
StudentLoans,3ay8pm,jayfleischman,8,Wed Jun 24 13:41:10 2015 UTC,"That article is too short to tell me anything, and I'm not listening to some video.  The problem is that with IBR/PAYE .... it's practically impossible to show an undue hardship. If she had gotten on a plan she'd be paying $0/mo and be in good standing. $0/mo is NOT a hardship.  Sure, in 25 years when the tax bomb hits, she might be in trouble with the IRS for back taxes. But that might constitute an undue hardship, and would be easier to discharge regardless."
StudentLoans,3ay8pm,ANGR1ST,5,Wed Jun 24 14:51:08 2015 UTC,"The tax bomb hits only if you're solvent when the unpaid balance is forgiven.

StudentLoans,3ay8pm,jamtam1,3,Wed Jun 24 15:16:40 2015 UTC,"The TPD discharge hits the nail on the head; that's where she should have gone to wipe out the debt immediately.  Problem is that she didn't know her options under non-bankruptcy law, and mucked up the argument when she went into court.  We lawyers say, ""bad facts make bad law."" This is a prime example."
StudentLoans,3ay8pm,Betsy514,4,Wed Jun 24 15:59:48 2015 UTC,She's not totally and permanently disabled as per the definition is the most likely reason - if you read the actual cases she has worked several times fairly recently - she also wants to take out more student loans after these are discharged - which could cause the old loans to kick back in depending on the timing.
StudentLoans,3az9ky,Khayembii,7,Wed Jun 24 18:19:12 2015 UTC,"If you really expect to make nearly $200k coming out of school, I'd take the fixed rate government loans.  If all goes as planned, you can pay them off very aggressively. We're talking a year or two, not 15 years. That'll eliminate most of the difference between the interest rates.  Then if things don't work out, you have the fall-back options inherent in the Federal loans. With the WF loans, if you don't get or keep work when you graduate (or hell, get injured and can't work), you're pretty well boned."
StudentLoans,3az9ky,ANGR1ST,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"I talked to my boss (who has decades of experience in my field, that I'd like to stay in after graduation) and he thinks I'll start at a higher salary than that, and can pay it off in probably 5 years.  But he agreed on the government loans because if it's paid off in 5 years the difference between that and WF fixed is nominal (especially considering that the origination fees are tax deductible while I'm in school).  And if something bad happens, I at least have my payments as low as they can go (I'd select the 25 year repayment term for this purpose)."
StudentLoans,3az9ky,xtrexjpsouz,3,Wed Jun 24 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"I would start with the federal loans. The interest rates on PLUS loans are on the high-ish side but you'll have a lot more flexibility in the event that things don't work out the way you plan after graduation.  If things do go really well and you end up making $200K+ after graduation, you can always refinance your federal loans at a lower rate through a private lender like SoFi. It doesn't work the other way around though (private to federal) so if you start with private loans, you're going to be locked into that type of loan for the entire length of repayment."
StudentLoans,3axy7c,ProtiK,5,Wed Jun 24 11:52:02 2015 UTC,"You can only use student loans and other financial aid on cost of attendance expenses - in general this means costs associated with attending school.  I would not consider your car loans in this category whatsoever.  You should use federal aid first, most of which does not require a co-signer  again - use federal loans first.  www.fasfa.ed.gov.  If you are 24 you do not need to include your folks financial information.  Even if you're not, you will still be eligible for unsubsidized loans at the very least."

No. This is not a legal use for a student loan.   At this point I believe I have a decent credit history (no late payments etc) so I may be able to get student loans on my own. Would that be advisable? Should I jump on the option of a cosigner given the chance or should I take it out alone if able?   Even if you are able to qualify for a private student loan on your own, having a creditworthy cosigner will get you a better interest rate.   Is there currently any ""best place"" to pull a loan?   The Department of Education. If you haven't already, make sure you complete the FAFSA. This is the only way you are going to qualify for federal student loans.   In case you haven't guessed from my dad being a doctor, I get squat from FAFSA, even though my real parental contribution ($0) is nowhere near my projected contribution. Do I still have any options for grants?   You may not qualify for anything need-based... but if you have good grades or strong leadership skills, you could try applying for some merit-based scholarships."

I can't really comment on how they treat borrowers who are struggling to make their monthly payments.  Honestly though, I really don't think there are that many differences between private lenders. They all have hit-or-miss customer service (like most large companies), they all base their interest rates on creditworthiness, and they're all pretty inflexible compared to the federal government. I would suggest applying through a few different lenders and going with whoever gives you the lowest interest rate."

You might be able to pay it off with a personal loan but I wouldn't really recommend this given that the interest rates tend to be very high and you won't be eligible for deferment/forbearance.   I currently have no credit and no access to any cosigners with viable credit.   This pretty much ruins your chances of getting any type of unsecured loan. Unfortunately, I don't think you have any options other than contacting the university to see if you can negotiate a settlement/payment plan. Then work your ass off to pay off that balance ASAP."

To answer your question, you won't be able to get an official student loan to backdate that far.  There are legal loopholes to backdate student loans for a semester or so, but not for education expenses that occurred years ago.    I work in higher education.  Your best bet is to do something a bit unethical and hope for the best... Apply to another community college and don't tell them about your past university.  We use ""clearing houses"" to check to see if you have ever attended another university.  Hopefully the CC and university use two different clearing houses.

StudentLoans,3avqj3,Draco_Black,7,Tue Jun 23 21:58:13 2015 UTC,Living expenses are a qualifying use for any student loan (federal or private). You don't need a special loan for this.
StudentLoans,3avqj3,xtrexjpsouz,4,Tue Jun 23 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"Your college has calculated for you something called a cost of attendance. This includes not only tuition and fees but also living expenses, transportation expenses and some personal expenses. You can borrow all the way up to that cost of attendance. Federal loans (which are normally your best option) have very low limits that may not even cover your school's tuition and fees. Your school should have a list of suggested lenders you can use to borrow for your additional costs. You can also do your own research on private loans for college. Shop around. Private student loans interest rates and fees can vary wildly. Look into your state's guarantee agency. My experience has been that they have the best rates. And never borrow more than what you need. Do some budgeting and calculate what you need for the year. If you have money left over, send it back to the lender or borrow less in your next year. If you are a dependent student, consider asking your parents to take out a PLUS loan (a student loan in their name), but some private loans (which would be in your name, but you may need a parent to co-sign) have better interest rates and fees than PLUS (however, PLUS usually offers better options for postponing payments if the parent runs into trouble making payments down the road, so it is kind of a trade off)."

StudentLoans,3avqj3,xtrexjpsouz,5,Tue Jun 23 22:14:26 2015 UTC,"No. What they're saying is that borrowing money for living expenses means you will graduate with more debt than someone who just borrowed for tuition - and a good chunk of that debt will probably be from a private lender since the annual limits on federal loans are pretty low. Private loans tend to have higher interest rates than federal loans, especially if your parents don't have amazing credit."

On another note, for undergrad,  loans don't really give out too much money. For graduate loans you can get more, but ehhh...my grad school was about 7k a semester and I only got 10k in loans.

StudentLoans,3auvot,twotonne,8,Tue Jun 23 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"She'd have to sign up for it on her own, and renew the paperwork every year, but it sounds like she'd be eligible to do that. The payment due would be based on her household income (both her and your father) so depending on their income they might very well qualify.  You can use this calculator to estimate your payments: https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action  Note that if you make lower payments for a longer period of time, it can cost more in the long term. So, if you can afford to make the full payment for 10 years, then it's probably going to be cheaper for you to do that overall."
StudentLoans,3auvot,aaronsweber,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:28:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply and info! I wasn't sure if it was household income or just hers. I don't know if it matters or not, but they don't make enough to file taxes (combined). I thought I had read that you would make lower payments for X number of years then the remainder would be forgiven but taxed as income. If that isn't a possibility then it would appear to be a bad way to go and I'll just pay it down as quickly as possible."
StudentLoans,3auvot,xtrexjpsouz,4,Tue Jun 23 18:52:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, any balance forgiven after 25 years on ICR would be taxed as income. If the borrower (your mother) dies before the loan is fully paid off, the remainder would be discharged and no taxes would be due."
StudentLoans,3auvot,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"And just to be clear, it is 25 years on ICR, not from the origination of the loan (2005), correct?"
StudentLoans,3auvot,xtrexjpsouz,3,Tue Jun 23 22:37:18 2015 UTC,Yes. The 25 years would start when the parent borrower consolidates and elects ICR as their repayment plan.
StudentLoans,3auvot,ANGR1ST,6,Tue Jun 23 22:58:13 2015 UTC,"If she hasn't already, note that your mother will need to consolidate her Parent PLUS loans in order to qualify for Income Contingent Repayment (ICR). Given your mother's age, I hate to say it but there is a very good chance that the debt will be discharged before it is fully paid off... so I do think that switching to ICR and paying the minimums is your best bet going forward."

Just getting married does not emancipate you. It doesn't matter if you were 18 when you got married. It is that your are divorced and under 24 that matters.

I'm not saying that this is your situation at all, but the government has got to draw the line somewhere regarding dependency - and that has been determined to be at the age of 24.  So unfortunately, since you do not meet the criteria to be considered an independent student any longer, you will need to move forward with providing parental information on the FAFSA."

You're required to make ""reasonable"" monthly payments, as determined by the lender. It's usually the minimum payment amount, but may be less depending on your circumstances. You can only rehabilitate your federal loans ONCE, so if you're unsure of being able to complete this process, do not rehabilitate. It requires 9 consecutive, on-time payments."
StudentLoans,3at3bp,CaptainCoral,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"As of July 2014, rehab payments are calculated using the same formula as IBR (15% of discretionary income).

I plugged in your approximate numbers and it indicated that not only are you unlikely to qualify for forgiveness after 25 years... but paying the minimums on IBR would cost you nearly $40,000 more in interest than the standard 10-year plan.  Therefore, I would definitely pay down the loans more aggressively. I would also suggest signing up for auto-debit through your loan servicer(s) as this will reduce your interest rates by 0.25%."
StudentLoans,3aqmr6,xtrexjpsouz,6,Mon Jun 22 22:27:39 2015 UTC,"Do you really want to wait the 300 months?  I don't know the rest of your expenses, but if your employer does a 401k match you should max that out, start a 4-6 month emergency fund (which you might already have in savings), then pay as much as you can towards the loans.  Definitely check out unbury.me like some others have said.  It's a tough reality, but if you do want kids, a car, and a house you need to keep your controllable expenses low and fight your way to a better financial situation.  The $200-$300 you're saving won't get you into a house, so I would take the instant 6.8% return (in the form of interest you don't have to pay) to get your net worth back to zero.  After that, you will be in the black and focusing on growth!"

I already match on the 401k and have a 4-5 month emergency fund, that much I have learned from browsing /r/personalfinance.  I am going to start putting all but $100 a month into those loans and continue to build up my savings (emergency fund).

StudentLoans,3as19s,agentamb,4,Tue Jun 23 01:22:32 2015 UTC,Unsubsidized loans are not need-based so you should be eligible for the maximum amount regardless of your EFC. Not sure how to resolve this other than going back to your financial aid office and seeing if you can speak to someone with more authority/experience.
StudentLoans,3as19s,xtrexjpsouz,3,Tue Jun 23 02:14:15 2015 UTC,"EFC still matters, but you can increase your borrowing to cover your EFC. For example, where I work, we initially award students only up to their financial need (cost of attendance less the student's EFC). We then make students actually ask us to increase their borrowing to cover the EFC if they need to. It's likely that your school is doing something similar. Contact your aid counselor and ask how you can cover your EFC using available financial aid."
StudentLoans,3as19s,rosythewench,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:31:59 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're an undergrad/dependent, you can qualify for an additional $4000 in Unsub, but only if your parents are denied on a PLUS loan pre-approval credit check.

StudentLoans,3aqwg2,knightwolfe8732,6,Mon Jun 22 19:56:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want a variable rate that high, so you're only really looking at the fixed rates. Giving up Federal repayment options for 0.26% on a 20 year loan is a total waste.  The 10 year term of 6.5% is tempting as it's an entire 1% lower than your current rate ... but I'm still not inclined to risk it. Not enough difference.  Are you actually approved for these rates or are they just advertized?"
StudentLoans,3aqwg2,ANGR1ST,3,Mon Jun 22 20:08:32 2015 UTC,"Are these the actual rates you have been offered? Or advertised rates? If they're advertised rates, keep in mind that the rates you actually qualify for may be quite a bit higher.  If I had to choose between those options, I would definitely go with a 10-year term. Fixed or variable depends on how quickly you think you can pay down the debt. If you think you can get rid of the whole thing in 5 years or less, variable is probably the cheapest option. Otherwise, fixed is safer for loans with longer terms.  With that said, I would be hesitant to give up all of the flexible repayment options associated with federal loans for only a ~1% reduction in your overall interest rate. If you have a solid emergency fund and are confident you will be able to pay at least $250/month every month no matter what... then yes, refinancing is worth considering. Otherwise, I would keep the loans where they are but pay them down as aggressively as possible."
StudentLoans,3aqwg2,xtrexjpsouz,-1,Tue Jun 23 02:05:09 2015 UTC,NEVER refinance a federal student loan into a private one. Private loans come with none of the federal programs for repayment.
StudentLoans,3aqwg2,jayfleischman,5,Tue Jun 23 00:02:32 2015 UTC,"Frankly that's just wrong. I completely agree that this decision should not be taken lightly and federal loans offer you many freedoms and securities not available with private loans. That said, using terms like  ""NEVER"" is ridiculous. If I have a stable job and could refinance from 8% federal to 3% private saving tens of thousands of dollars, I think it would be silly not to consider that.  In OP's case, I think I would stick it out with federal loans as the payoff from refinancing just isn't enough to rationalize switching."
StudentLoans,3aqwg2,crsllvn,-1,Tue Jun 23 05:57:56 2015 UTC,"The rate on federal loans is lower than for a private loan refinance, especially if there are costs associated with getting into the new loan.  Better bet is to pay down the federal loans more quickly than to expose yourself to the variable rates over the terms of the proposed private loans.  If the conversation were about refinancing private loans into these new loans, that would be a different question. But it's not, so I still go with the opinion that giving up some flexibility in the federal student loan repayment scheme for the private refinance is a bad idea."
StudentLoans,3aqwg2,jayfleischman,2,Wed Jun 24 16:04:23 2015 UTC,"My federal loans are 6.5%. I could refinance to private FIXED rate loans at 4%. Variable would be even lower, at least currently. There are NO upfront costs associated with this refinance. This is an actual real life example."

StudentLoans,3ar6mo,RedStag86,8,Mon Jun 22 21:10:04 2015 UTC,"Any lawyer coming to you and claiming to wipe your student debt will likely do the following:   Instruct you to stop all payments and stop talking to the lenders. Forward all correspondence to them. They refuse to pay anything until the student loan lenders are willing the negotiate. Your credit subsequently gets ruined. They get the settlement, hopefully MUCH less than the amount due. Hopefully they can get the bad stuff removed from your credit report as well. They give you a payment plan through them (basically another loan). The payment plan is much more money than the settlement they agree on with the lenders, but still less than your orginal balance.   There are so many risks with this:   The loan company never settles and just garnishes your wages, your credit is now ruined for the basially the rest of your life. The settlement is still relatively large and you have trouble paying the lawyers. The lawyers stop deciding to represent you randomly. The law office goes underwater for whatever reason.   Unless there was a very detailed contract (reviewed by another lawyer you get), this is probably a terrible idea. If you want to default on your loans and hope for a settlement do it yourself.  TL;DR Your debt is never going to magically disappear. Anyone promising that is taking advantage of you and likely going to earn some sort of profit off of you."
StudentLoans,3ar6mo,AsSubtleAsABrick,7,Tue Jun 23 13:05:28 2015 UTC,I called them to learn more.

The will then lower your total debt and you can start on working your credit score back up over the next few years. Seemed like too much of a risk.

StudentLoans,3aq1zz,RottenKodiak,3,Mon Jun 22 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"If you can qualify for a lower interest rate, sure. You didn't give us any information about your current income or how long you've been in repayment so it's impossible for us to speculate as to whether or not you would be able to save money by refinancing.  A few lenders you may want to look into are SoFi, LendKey, Citizens Bank, Wells Fargo, and Darien Rowayton Bank. I'm sure there are others but those seem to be the biggest ones."
StudentLoans,3aq1zz,xtrexjpsouz,2,Tue Jun 23 02:08:10 2015 UTC,Depends if you can get a better overall interest rate. I recently refinanced one of my larger student loans that had an interest rate of 13% down to 6.5%. Also is the payment too much? When I first graduated I extended my payments to 20-25 years (depending what the company allowed) because the payment was too much for me. When I refinanced I cut it down to 15 years to shorten the loan and lessen interest paid.   Basically you need to look at your personal situation and see what you can realistically afford. Just remember the longer your term the more interest the bank collects. Also it might make sense to just flat out pay the smaller one off rather than group it into a refinanced loan.
StudentLoans,3aq1zz,timmythegreat,2,Mon Jun 22 16:32:28 2015 UTC,I'm looking to keep paying what I'm paying currently (320/month) just with less of an interest burden. Where do you recommend I go to explore my options?

At least their auto-pay works pretty well.  You're probably not going to be able to do very much about the late payments. You can ask the servicer if they'll reverse them ... but they have little incentive to, so don't be surprised when they say no."

StudentLoans,3apzrq,Kaggr,2,Mon Jun 22 16:56:02 2015 UTC,"No. Federal regulations require that all payments be applied to outstanding fees and interest first, then principal.  The only exception to this rule is if you make a payment within 120 days of disbursement. During that window of time, you can apply your payment as a refund (to principal) - effectively cancelling a portion of the loan and reversing any interest that accrued on that balance to date."

StudentLoans,3am6rc,dcollier74,11,Sun Jun 21 16:20:01 2015 UTC,"Those sliders for numbers are absolutely obnoxious on a small device (kindle in my case). For the amount I owe I simply couldn't get the slider on the right number. There are many people who do go on to grad school without doing it directly after undergrad. Some questions didn't seem to take this into consideration. The questions I left blank were predominately those that I simply can't remember. I've been out of undergrad 14 years, who knows what was on my FAFSA. I'm also bothered that a few questions assume everyone will have kids. I hope not answering some of those questions doesn't bump me below 90%, as I didn't want to give you inaccurate information. I really hope you get some meaningful information from your survey and your research."
StudentLoans,3am6rc,gfpumpkins,2,Sun Jun 21 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for letting me know about the sliders on smaller devices.  I found that when I asked people to manually input numbers they either messed it up or wrote out some weird text, including N/A or ""the rest of what is owed.""  I'll see what qualtrics can do about that.  So the question about grad school does not ask if you immediately went, it asks if you did after earning your undergraduate.  To understand gaps for when people did go, it does ask for when you started and graduated with a masters.   I can see how it may be interpreted differently. Fair enough, that is one of the problems in this research realm.   The questions do not assume that everyone will have children as you can always answer with the neutral response and the slider questions state that if you have none or do not want any children to ensure it is at zero.  With that said, the survey assumes that you have modified behaviors (relevant towards having children and paying for their college experiences).  However, I do see your point and understand why you may be bothered in that way.   I do apologize having this bother you. I am sure it will not and because you informed me but tried to complete the survey earnestly, I will ensure it did not.  I hope so too. I've collected many stories and situations and I hope that the data is able to be put to good use to make some changes and tell others how this debt affects the lives of people in a deeper way.

StudentLoans,3amuky,frojoe27,2,Sun Jun 21 20:28:20 2015 UTC,You can get small personal loans with no collateral(10k is the limit at my bank) but the interest rates are very high(12% at my bank).  If you can borrow against a house or something you could easily borrow 15k and the interest rate would be far lower. If you don't have property to borrow against private student loans will be better than a personal loan.
StudentLoans,3amuky,frojoe27,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Could you recommend a bank? Right now Discover is offering 10.4 fixed which is almost the upper end of their fixed range, and may be because I lack a co-signer."

Maybe try a local bank or credit union as well.  Unfortunately, without a cosigner, you're probably not going to qualify for a good interest rate regardless of your own creditworthiness. You're actually lucky you got approved by Discover at all."

StudentLoans,3amuky,soyeahiknow,4,Mon Jun 22 02:54:39 2015 UTC,"I would not consider a personal loan. The interest rate is going to be even higher than what you were already offered because personal loans are easier to discharge in bankruptcy.  Try a couple of different lenders and see if you can qualify for a lower rate somewhere else. If that doesn't work, just take the Discover loan and pay it back as quickly as possible. Note that there are no prepayment penalties on student loans so you can and probably should start making payments while you're in school."
StudentLoans,3amoln,acousticphysics,6,Sun Jun 21 18:59:51 2015 UTC,"My question is... while I'm in school, is the interest also being applied to the 1,548.25?? Or will that be applied to the principal only after my deferment period (and grace) is over? Am I only being charged 6.8% on the original 6,500?   Interest does not compound/capitalize while you're in school. It only capitalizes once at the end of your grace period (6 months after graduation). You can avoid interest capitalization by paying down the interest while you are in school.   If it is only applied to principal, is there any way to pay of the principal before the unpaid interest?   Generally speaking, no. You have to pay all of the outstanding interest first. The only exception is if you are still within 120 days of a loan disbursement. Any payments made during that time would be applied as a refund (meaning the payment is applied to principal, and any interest that accrued to date would be cancelled). In other words, if you return the money within 120 days, they'll pretend you never borrowed it in the first place."

StudentLoans,3amoln,AgedPumpkin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:48:07 2015 UTC,"The first $1,550 would pay off all of the outstanding interest and the remaining $50 would go to principal. Interest would then continue accruing on the remaining $6,450 principal balance."

I won't have any additional loans for this year of grad school. I was intending on paying down my interest now just to make it easier later. Would it behoove me to pay off the interest on my largest interest rate, and pay towards that principal balance, or just the interest as a whole? Sorry, might be a stupid question."
StudentLoans,3amoln,AgedPumpkin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:16:27 2015 UTC,"You should try to pay down the loan with the highest interest rate first, regardless of the size of the balance."

StudentLoans,3amoln,AgedPumpkin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:51:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, but note that your subsidized loans aren't accruing interest during your deferment so for the time being, treat them like they have a 0% interest rate regardless of what the ""real"" rate may be."

StudentLoans,3amoln,AgedPumpkin,3,Tue Jun 23 23:53:30 2015 UTC,"Interest is calculated only on your 6500 principal while in school. This means the interest on this loan is increasing at a rate of $1.21 per day. Based in the interest you said this loan has accrued, you got this loan about 3.5 years ago.   You cannot pay principal first on student loans. Any payment you make goes to interest first then once interest is paid off completely in a single payment, the remainder goes towards the principal. For example in your case, if you made a single payment of 1600, your interest would be paid off, and your principal reduced by 51.75.   I think, but am not 100% sure, that the interest gets added to the principal 6 months after you graduate."
StudentLoans,3amoln,AreaManatee,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:47:39 2015 UTC,"Since my loans are split up, can I pay the remaining accrued interest on this, and then hack away at the principal? Or do I need to have all of the interest off of EVERY loan before I any any principle?"
StudentLoans,3amoln,AreaManatee,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"I only know about fedloan servicing, but if you are still a student, you are able to pay any amount of money to 1 loan at a time. you do not have to pay all interest on all loans before paying down principal on a single loan."
StudentLoans,3amoln,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:51:03 2015 UTC,"They are separate loans. If you want to focus your efforts on one loan at a time while in deferment, you can certainly do this. Depending on how your loan servicer organizes the loans on their website, it might be a little tricky to target payments online... but a simple phone call should take care of it."
StudentLoans,3amoln,tsunamisurfer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"EDIT: you were both right, interest does get paid first.  I guess my payments just made it seem as if I was paying both interest and principal because I was paying the accumulated interest from the month along with a chunk of the principal /e  I don't think that the 2nd part of your answer is correct.  It is correct that you cannot pay principal before paying interest, but it is not correct that 100% of the interest must be paid before the principal can be paid down.     I Have Nelnet as my loan servicer, and when I pay say $400, a portion of that 400 goes to interest, and a portion goes to the principal.   As the loan gets paid down, the interest decreases and more and more gets put to the principal.   I have no control over how much goes to the principal vs. interest, but a portion of each gets paid with each payment."
StudentLoans,3amoln,xtrexjpsouz,6,Sun Jun 21 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"No, /u/AreaManatee was correct. You have to pay all of the outstanding interest on a particular loan before you can even touch the principal balance."

StudentLoans,3aji2h,rvtjess,6,Sun Jun 21 05:00:37 2015 UTC,"Few things.    The graduated repayment plan starts out low and increases payments every coupe years. I don't believe the algorithm is publicly available, but I believe the repayment term for graduated is between 12 and 30 years depending on the amount.  You accumulated six months of interest in addition to whatever you had accumulated while in school which was all capitalized when you came out of deferment. Thus increasing your principal. Your loan was not sold. MOHELA is one of many federal student loan servicers. Nelnet and Navient are probably more familiar names, same concept. They simply handle all the customer service and collections in exchange for their piece of your pie. The government still owns your loan."

StudentLoans,3aji2h,skeach101,3,Sun Jun 21 12:24:57 2015 UTC,"Graduated repayment in the early years will not pay much more than the accumulating interest each month if you only pay the minimums. Don't change your plan though, just pay extra each month towards only your highest interest rate loans if you can.  Read up on graduated repayment though, it only makes sense if you have a reason to believe you will have a lot more money available for paying loans 6 or 7 years in since the payments will keep going up until they are higher than standard repayment. It also makes sense if you plan on paying off the loans in a few years but want to be able to control which loans more of your money goes to.  If you just pay the minimums on graduated repayment until the loan is paid off you will pay more interest and be ending with a much higher monthly payment than on the standard plan."
StudentLoans,3aji2h,frojoe27,2,Sun Jun 21 14:38:26 2015 UTC,I made myself a spread just for this purpose. Now I can double check navient's balance against what I have calculated it should be.

StudentLoans,3aji2h,gfpumpkins,2,Sun Jun 21 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"Graduated plans typically start with interest-only payments so you probably weren't making any real progress during the first two years of repayment.  Also, when you say the ""starting balance"" was $22,000 are you talking about the original balance you borrowed or the balance at graduation? Most student loans accrue interest while you are in school so your balance at graduation should have been significantly larger than the original balance. You also mentioned a 6-month deferment; was this in addition to your grace period? If so, note that interest was most likely accruing during that time as well."
StudentLoans,3aji2h,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:58:01 2015 UTC,That sounds about right. My balance didn't really move the first few years. My deferment was in addition to the grace period. Those early years were tough! Thanks

As far as I know, there are only three options: ICR, IBR, and PAYE. Of those, PAYE is the newest and most favorable option. ICR is the least favorable and is generally only used by people who have no other options.   Can I apply extra money to higher interest loans if I'm at $0 payment for the first year (because it's pulling my tax information from last year)?   Yes. There are no prepayment penalties on student loans so you are free to pay extra whenever you want, regardless of the size of your monthly minimums or the type of repayment plan you're on.   Any other advice?   Given that you only have $46K of debt against a new annual income of $52K, I really don't think you're going to benefit much from the income-driven repayment plans. I mean, it's nice to have the lower monthly minimums for a while... but you're going to be back to the equivalent of the standard payments after a few years and stretching out repayment longer than necessary is only going to cost you more money over the life of the loans.  At this point, your top priorities should be establishing an emergency fund and taking advantage of any 401k match your employer may offer.

The penalties for lying to them about things like that vary from lender to lender.  There's an automated system that the schools and the lenders use to determine if you're still in school. Usually while you're still enrolled the date is actually set a good ways beyond your real expected graduation date (the registrar doesn't want to deal with updating it every time a student takes an extra semester to graduate). Once you finish and all your school side paperwork is sorted out and finalized that date will get updated to be correct.

StudentLoans,3aef1c,ThemApples007,5,Fri Jun 19 18:51:36 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying but keep in mind that refinancing is becoming more and more common these days. If you don't allow creditworthy borrowers to release their cosigners, there's a good chance they will try to refinance their loans through a different lender. It's not as bad as defaulting but still not great for the original lender in terms of public image and long-term profit."
StudentLoans,3aef1c,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jun 19 19:04:26 2015 UTC,"Right now that doesn't matter to them. If people refi, they get bought out and immediately loan money to the next eager freshman.

StudentLoans,3aef1c,americanets,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:15:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly - loan originators don't care if you refi, they still made some money. Besides, they know that there are so few refi options that only <5% will probably ever attempt to and do so successfully. It's unlike mortgages which is much more competitive - banks lower rates to ""win"" customers. Mortgages, when regulated properly, are actually a very efficient market. Not so for student loans.  Playing devils advocate, if I was a student loan lender I wouldn't dare release a cosigner knowing that A) that's what's keeping me in a position of power, and B) the chances are slim someone will be able to refinance because there are so few alternatives. Sad but true."

StudentLoans,3afusa,nothingmeansnothing,5,Fri Jun 19 20:14:39 2015 UTC,"You didn't specify if these are federal or private loans... but generally speaking, student loans use daily simple interest not compound interest. The only time the interest capitalizes is when you exit a period of deferment and/or enter repayment. For most borrowers, this means the interest only capitalizes once: at the end of their grace period.  Can you explain why you think the interest is capitalizing on your loans? Are you sure you're using this term correctly? Because if your question was actually how often interest accrues, then the answer is ""daily"" regardless of the lender."
StudentLoans,3afusa,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:01:15 2015 UTC,All federal loans  I see your point.  I checked my balances on a few  different days this week and every time the balances have increased.  But I see that might just be the interest accruing.  the other loans might just wait to add the interest at the end of the month.
StudentLoans,3afusa,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, federal student loan interest accrues daily but does not capitalize while you are in repayment.

StudentLoans,3aet1p,hash_taggg,4,Fri Jun 19 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"This is a new one.  One would think that if the for-profit is paying you, that they are your employer - but let's assume that's not the case.  First, make sure the non-profit that meets this definition https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#qualifying-employment  - if it isn't the point is likely moot.  If it does meet that definition, who your paycheck comes from doesn't come up when you are certifying your eligible employment - they ask for certification from your employer not pay stubs https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/public-service-employment-certification-form.pdf  So if your HR fills it out confirming your employer is the eligible one you should be fine.  Here's where it gets tricky - you do have to submit income verification to qualify for whatever income driven plan you're on.  As PSLF hasn't been around long enough for anyone to qualify for yet, we don't know if they will audit those accounts to ensure the pay stub info submitted matches the employment verification info.  There's nothing in the regs that requires this, but that doesn't mean they can't and won't.  If I were you I'd see how the employment verification shakes out and keep your fingers crossed.  If there's an issue when the time comes, see if your employer will submit a letter explaining the situation."

They qualify from what I've found on the IRS website, and I checked with Payroll regarding my peers tax ID, all of which qualify.   You mentioned it only matters by how HR fills the form, and I checked with payroll and my Tax ID is definitely for-profit.  u/skeach101 had asked to explain my position a bit more and that may help-- I'll try to do my best without giving away specifics. I work for a hospital in a particular service. Half of the docs I work with, work for the non-profit and the other half work for the for-profit. I get paid by the company that is for-profit. The story here is that they were there own group of docs who got bought out by the larger non-profit company. But somehow they still have their own payroll therefore my paychecks.   Going through orientation etc it all was the bigger group. My paychecks are printed on the non profit's paper with the for profit stamp in the corner. So if this is an issue of where the money is coming from… its the for profit company that, I guess, is owned by the non-profit?  I think that may just confuse everyone more. :/"

I think if you explain your job that might make it easier.  I'll give an example. Let's say you work at a museum. You would likely qualify. However, if you work at a museum food court. You probably DON'T work for a non-profit and would not qualify, since you likely work for the food joint. Make sense?"

StudentLoans,3acq2s,misterhubris,2,Fri Jun 19 02:09:37 2015 UTC,"As the other poster said, your loans will still accrue interest. There is no advantage to this strategy unless you absolutely cannot make payments right now. Additionally, if you fail to pay off all of the interest that has accrued while you were in deferment, I can all but guarantee you that the interest will capitalize. This means the interest that was deferred will be added to your principle and you will be paying interest on that as well from then on.  If making your current payments is an issue you should be looking into income based payment plans if these are federal loans.  Edit: Correction, this does not apply to Direct Subsidized Loans. They will work as you initially expected and you will not accrue any interest. However, these generally make up a smaller portion of your loans. Also, there are some pretty stringent rules for qualifying for deferment."
StudentLoans,3acq2s,NotPankakes,2,Fri Jun 19 02:55:35 2015 UTC,"In addition to the interest problem, how are you going to qualify for economic hardship but still make enough to save up money to make a large lump sum payment? When they see your tax return, I think they will have questions for you."
StudentLoans,3acq2s,rklthegirl,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:39:49 2015 UTC,"This is  an important question. In order to qualify for economic hardship deferment, you have to earn less than 150% of the federal poverty limit (~$17,600 per year for a single person)."

You can still make payments on those loans during deferment if you want.  So theoretically if you qualify for deferment on subsidized loans, but have enough money to make SOME payments, you will save money on interest by paying down principal while not paying interest.  For example, if you're on economic hardship deferment but get some cash for a short-term job or a yard sale or a gift, using that money to pay back the student loan while it's still in deferment would save you money long term."

I wouldn't pay a dime over the minimums right now, you're going to need everything you can scrape together for the private loans.  You're not going to have much if any luck re-financing or consolidating your Private loans. You have too much debt and not enough income. Your best bet is to ask about a 15-20 repayment term with your lenders. Sometimes those are selectable options. Regardless, if you currently have co-signers for those loans, keep them informed of what the loan status is. It's better to talk to them ahead of time before missing payments and tanking their credit history.  You can ask Sallie Mae about their rate reduction programs. You may or may not qualify. And you'll still have to make payments. But under some situations you can get the interest rates reduced. (Not sure what they are though, just heard about people getting them.)  I see about $1600/mo pre-tax in income, so maybe $1300/mo take home. That's less than what you would need to make the minimum payments on a 10 year plan. Cutting out the Federal loans with, it looks like you have $1100/mo in private loan payments.  You need more income. No two ways about it. 25-30 hours a week isn't going to cut it. You need either a much better hourly (your expensive degree does qualify you for something, right?), or 40-50+ hours of work a week. Two jobs. Low expenses. It's going to suck hard. If your local COL is low enough, you can get away with maybe $2200/mo in take home income to service your private loans and still feed yourself."

Unfortunately, even if the Sallie Mae loans were completely interest-free, I still don't think OP would be able to afford the monthly minimums.

StudentLoans,3ac1ol,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jun 19 12:38:41 2015 UTC,"I have one parent plus loan, which is technically under my cosigner’s name but I will be responsible in paying it off.   To clarify: Students cannot cosign on Parent PLUS loans. These loans are made in the parent's name only and are therefore 100% the parent's responsibility. Obviously, you made an agreement with said parent and you should honor that agreement to the best of your ability... but I felt like I needed to make this clear because a lot of people come here thinking that they are legally responsible for PPLs when they are absolutely not.   The three Sallie Mae loans, I am just lost with. Should I consolidate these or not? Should I defer them?   Unfortunately, the only way to consolidate private loans is to refinance them. Private refinances are credit-based and I can guarantee you are not going to qualify at your current income. Having a creditworthy cosigner might help, but I still don't think any private lender is going to want to touch you in your current situation (~$20K income against $135K in total debt).  The only real solution to your problem is to increase your income - whether that means finding a better job, or adding a second or third job to supplement the one you have. I know that's easier said than done, but there is absolutely no way you're going to be able to make any progress on your loans at your current income.  In the meantime, I would definitely contact Wells Fargo and Sallie Mae to ask about forbearance and any other options they have available. (I know Sallie Mae has a rate reduction plan that could reduce your interest rate to 1% for up to 12 months). They're not going to be able to offer you any long-term solutions but you can at least buy some time to work on your employment situation.  If one or both of the lenders are completely unwilling to work with you and you are unable to increase your income quickly enough, you may have no choice but to let the loans default and see what happens. Certainly not an ideal situation but that's what tends to happen when you borrow way too much from a private lender. It'll trash your credit (and your cosigner's credit) and there's a good chance one or both of the lenders will sue you for wage garnishment... but if you can't pay the debt, you can't pay it."

StudentLoans,3acvyy,Turtlebacons,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it's not really possible for you (or anyone else) to work out exact numbers for IBR because nobody can accurately predict 20-25 years into the future. No matter how hard you try, you're going to be making a lot of assumptions regarding income and family size that may not end up being even close to accurate. It's also not really possible to predict what the federal tax brackets and marginal rates will look like that far into the future.  Therefore, paying the minimums and waiting for forgiveness is always going to be a gamble. If you are fairly certain you will come out ahead and feel comfortable taking that risk, go for it. I tend to be more risk-averse so I, personally, would generally be in favor of paying down the debt as soon as possible... especially if you anticipate a large increase in your salary that would make the odds of receiving any amount of forgiveness less likely."

Oct 2015 I will not do IBR because my income vs loan amount left will not allow me to benefit and my min payment will increase to ~600. I also think IBR has a 3 year limit? (I could be wrong)."
StudentLoans,3acvyy,phat1forever,3,Sat Jun 20 01:54:24 2015 UTC,I also think IBR has a 3 year limit? (I could be wrong).   No. The maximum amount of time you can be on IBR is 25 years. You are probably thinking of the 3-year limit on interest subsidies under IBR... or maybe the 3-year limit on hardship deferment.
StudentLoans,3acvyy,rvtjess,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:28:31 2015 UTC,"Ah yep, you are right. I am thinking of the interest subsidy."
StudentLoans,3acvyy,phat1forever,2,Sat Jun 20 17:16:15 2015 UTC,IBR does not have a 3 year limit; in theory you can make payments for 25 years and are forgiven for any remaining balance.
StudentLoans,3acvyy,ReadySetMillionaire,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:12:06 2015 UTC,I will not be doing ibr anymore because it will make no difference. My income to debt ratio means my minimum payment will be the same whether ibr or standard repayment. And as it is I pay well over what the new minimum will be. I also plan to have it paid off in about 5 years meaning about 7.5 years in total since I started repayment.
StudentLoans,3acvyy,livinthepielife,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:25:11 2015 UTC,"Fellow newly minted lawyer here (graduated last year with $147k debt and $47.5k income). I weighed the IBR/PAYE option for a long time (see my post here and read this entire thread for the pros and cons of IBR: http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2wecdj/at_what_point_should_you_just_give_up_paying_your/) and the concern you have is just one of many reasons why I opted to change my lifestyle and pay aggressively towards my loans now so I can enjoy life later.   As an attorney, with huge potential for greater income, here is why you shouldn't simply make minimum payments under IBR:  1) Income Increases: Sure, you might not be making that much income now, but play your cards right and you will end up with a 6-figure job within 2-3 years (I personally am at a 24 person firm and looking to move to big law or regional big law firms in a couple years). And once your income increases, you're exactly right, your payments will increase and you're going to pay off your loans anyway. If you just made minimum payments along the way, then you would simple have to pay all the interest that accrued.   2) Interest Accrual: As you also noted, interest is simply going to accrue while you are in IBR. The longer you defer, the more you're going to end up paying. Just pay them as aggressively as you can.  3) Filing Taxes Separately: If you have a spouse and intend to marry them (or intend to get married within the 25 year term), then their income and student loan debt will be considered in your IBR payment. And if they make a decent amount of money, then you will either have to (a) make pretty high payments and pay off the loan anyway or (b) file taxes separately. And if you choose to file separately, you lose almost every significant tax deduction available (see here: https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1894449-is-it-better-for-a-married-couple-to-file-jointly-or-separately). Those deductions add up to tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, over 25 years.  These are the big concerns. But there are more. All I can say is that you should focus on paying these off now. And to do so, you should:  (1) Reduce fixed expenses as much as possible. Get a roommate (or live at home), get your grocery budget in check, think about cutting the cord, etc. It all adds up.  (2) Enroll in IBR (I'll explain later).  (3) Contribute up to the match in your 401k.  (4) Make minimum payments on your student loans until you have a 3-6 emergency fund saved up.  (5) Once you have the emergency fund saved up, continue making the minimum IBR payment, but also send as much extra money as you can towards the unsubsidized loan with the highest interest rate (not balance, but interest rate).  (6) When you are done paying off the highest interest loan, move to the next highest interest rate unbsubsidized loan.  (7) Rinse and repeat."
StudentLoans,3ab67i,Davek804,2,Thu Jun 18 17:59:07 2015 UTC,"Nope. Aside from taking advantage of specific discounts like the one for using auto-debit (0.25%), it is not possible to negotiate a lower interest rate without refinancing because that would be altering the terms of the loan agreement which AFAIK is illegal. If you think you can get a better interest rate through a different lender, feel free to refinance your loans again. I don't think there's a limit on how many times you can do this."
StudentLoans,3ab67i,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"Ah - I did not think of it in terms of altering the terms of the agreement. You're probably right!  I've got the auto debit sorted. I'm interested in refinancing again and going for a 5 year repayment as I am slated to pay it off sooner, but as of yet I haven't managed to get one of the new-age private refinancers to offer me one of their 1.9% rates... would love to make that happen.   Thanks a ton for your comment."
StudentLoans,3ab67i,rosythewench,2,Thu Jun 18 18:24:06 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that the lowest rates (like the 1.9% you quoted) are generally going to be variable and therefore will still likely rise over time.
StudentLoans,3ab67i,xtrexjpsouz,2,Thu Jun 18 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"Correct. Also, if you read the fine print, they typically state that the best available rates are based on a $10,000 loan balance. Larger loan balances are inherently riskier than smaller ones so even with amazing credit, getting the best available rate may not be possible depending on the size of your balance."
StudentLoans,3ab67i,joejoe2213,2,Thu Jun 18 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I'm already in variable, but they've got me pegged at LIBOR + 3%. I wonder what you have to have in terms of income, credit, work history etc to get down to that mythical LIBOR + 1.% if that is indeed how it works..."
StudentLoans,3abnac,Zirte,7,Thu Jun 18 20:02:17 2015 UTC,It would be a real bad life choice to go 120k in the hole for a bachelor degree. Live at home go to community college.
StudentLoans,3abnac,Chilbobaggins54,5,Fri Jun 19 03:06:12 2015 UTC,"No undergraduate degree is worth that much money. The fact that you're pursuing music makes it even worse. Seriously, borrowing your way through this school would be a horrible decision. (Note: You're not going to be able to get $30K per year in private loans anyway without a cosigner.) If you're really passionate about music and are 100% sure you want to do this as a career, you need to find a more affordable school. Period.  Edit: And before you say it, I don't care how prestigious the school might be. I live near Eastman and they are not immune from having graduates end up playing violin on the street for quarters."

StudentLoans,3abnac,Betsy514,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:27:39 2015 UTC,"Tuition alone is $41,200 per year according to their website. For comparison: Eastman charges $47,770 per year, Juilliard charges $38,190 per year, and the Manhattan Conservatory of Music charges $42,000 per year. So that price is fairly typical for the top musical conservatories in the country... but still completely not worth it IMO.  Edited to add: If your goal is to play in a major orchestra, nobody is going care what school you attended in an audition. They might not even know, depending on how exactly they handle the audition process. (Most auditions are blind to prevent racial and gender biases.) The best performer is the one who gets the job."
StudentLoans,3abnac,xtrexjpsouz,3,Fri Jun 19 19:31:27 2015 UTC,so that answers my question  - OP already has about 30K in financial aid - only needs at most 10K for tuition - so is looking for 20K for living expenses.  OP - live like a famous musician when you're a student and you'll be living like a student when you're a famous musician.
StudentLoans,3abnac,Betsy514,2,Fri Jun 19 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sounds like they're trying to borrow the absolute maximum amount. (The SFCM website lists total cost of attendance as $60,400 if you live on-campus.)"

StudentLoans,3abnac,skeach101,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"You won't be able to get an additional $30k a year in loans without a cosigner.  I also agree with others that the employment prospects for even an amazing musician are not good enough to justify going into such enormous debt.  The odds are very high that you would be unable to make the required payments on $120k+ after getting the degree.   I know a number of talented musicians who have to work their butts off to just put a roof over their heads on food on their tables (most all of them work more than one job -- multiple bands, teaching music lessons, laborer).  It isn't fair but that's the reality of the job market in music."
StudentLoans,3aazb5,RockinBecky,3,Thu Jun 18 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"Yes it can be done.  Contact the loan holder and ask them to ""unbundle"" the loans by daughter - so you'll have two sets that will be billed separately.  Also if the loans are in deferment, she can keep them in deferment if she wants and still make the payments - you just won't get a bill.  Remember that these loans are in your name so if something should happen, make sure you handle it so it doesn't' affect your credit"
StudentLoans,3aazb5,Betsy514,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:15:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I tried contacting them, but they are just being so slow about getting back to me. I really appreciate your answer."

StudentLoans,3aazb5,emperionx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:44:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately this may not be possible as the previous poster made you think. If both daughters are in school, you would have to request that one be taken off deferment and then sign a waiver so it is never placed in a deferment again and you will be billed. When they come into repayment, if they are Direct Loans, they would have to have the same due date, so you wouldnt be able to get separate bills in that regard. You would have to request a different person be billed for that one loan in particular. which you cant do unless you are in repayment, or requesting interest bills"
StudentLoans,3aauha,_ThePot_,2,Thu Jun 18 16:33:25 2015 UTC,The loan will affect your co-signers debt to income ratio and therefore could affect their credit score if that ratio is too high.
StudentLoans,3aauha,Betsy514,2,Thu Jun 18 17:17:15 2015 UTC,"This. Most lenders will not allow borrowers to exceed a monthly debt-to-income ratio of 43%. Whoever co-signs will have your student loans included in their overall debt-to-income ratio, regardless of who is actually paying them back. This could make it difficult for them to qualify for a mortgage or other types of loans.  EDIT: Just wanted to add, thank you for thinking about your co-signer and how this debt will affect them. A lot of students are so fixated on ""I need money NOW"" that they don't even consider the fact that co-signing on tens of thousands of dollars in student loans could end up being very burdensome... especially if they don't get their ""dream job"" after college."
StudentLoans,3aauha,xtrexjpsouz,2,Thu Jun 18 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"So I am joining Boston University this fall for my MBA and I want to take a student loan from the USA, as my own nation (India) is offering me loans at a whooping high 11-13% interest (as compared to 2-6% in the USA).   Private student loans in the United States are not as cheap as you seem to think. While it is possible to get a rate close to 2%, private loans are credit-based so only the most creditworthy borrowers would qualify for that kind of rate. Borrowers with average to poor credit are more likely to end up with double-digit interest rates, if they qualify for a loan at all.  Also note that the low interest rates you're looking at are almost certainly variable rates (not fixed). Variable interest rates are currently at historic lows and have nowhere to go but up over the next several years."
StudentLoans,3aauha,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"Right. Thanks for the info! That was really helpful.  But are you sure you are not confusing MBA loans with undergraduate loans?

Secondly, I am gonna choose a co signor with very decent credit ratings if I am gonna through all the pain. Thanks to my wide network I have many options to choose from, however, this doesn't mean I can ask such a huge favor from someone without making sure that they don't get into trouble due to me.   Once I have been offered both, Fixed and Variable interest rate I can do a study of market trends, a speculation of the time I may take to repay my loans, and of course reddit's help in deciding if I should go for Fixed or Variable rate.   Right now, I have already been offered a loan from Prodigy finance at the fixed rate of 9.21% without a co signor, but I want to make sure that I don't regret later on by not taking my best shot.   So, if you have any idea regarding my immediate question, please help me figure out how my loan affects my co-signor. I spoke to one of my relatives who recently acquired the green card, and has really strong credit history that shall get me a loan at a rather good rate, but he also mentioned that he wants to get a home loan for himself in the near future. Will co-signing my loan directly affect his home-loan? Thanks again !!"
StudentLoans,3aad1z,uncle_kev,2,Thu Jun 18 14:17:54 2015 UTC,"FFEL loans don't actually qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. You're going to have to consolidate them into a Direct Consolidation Loan to qualify. I really wish you had looked into this when you first started teaching so you could have consolidated and gotten on track for PSLF sooner.  Given that you are planning to go back to school full-time in a couple of months, it's really up to you whether you want to do this now or wait until after you graduate. I would probably do it now to get it over with. Either way, you're going to have to start from scratch on the required 120 payments after you finish grad school and resume teaching full-time. (Deferment doesn't count towards PSLF because you aren't making qualifying payments during that time.)   I also have a private loan from Sallie Mae that has $18,000 left on it. I have been paying at the standard rate for the last two years, which is $300/month x 10 years. The interest rate is locked at 8%.   Are you sure this loan is on a 10-year repayment plan? $300 per month seems a bit high, even after accounting for the fact that you've already been in repayment for two years. According to unbury.me, $300 per month would pay off that entire loan (with interest) in about six years.   What do you guys think the best option would be to get my monthly payments down (particularly for the Stafford Loans)?   Consolidate and sign up for Income Based Repayment. This will lower your monthly minimums and put you on track for PSLF after you finish grad school."

I began subbing the last couple months of the school year last year and got hired to full-time in September 2014, so I'm not that far behind the eight-ball as far as PSLF is concerned.  I will also continue to work throughout grad school, as I am doing my program at night with some weekends mixed in while continuing to teach at my high school...I will be considered a full-time student throughout the program, as I am taking a full slate of accelerated classes.  I will have to call Navient and look into that private loan...unbury.me gave me the same time frame. I am a month ahead of my payments, but I recently realized most of what I was paying was going towards interest and not the principal, so I am probably not being as efficient with payments as I could be. I am considering prioritizing the private loan, doubling up on payments, and trying to get rid of that bad boy ASAP."

Ah okay, thanks for clarifying this. Are you willing to continue making payments while in school or would you rather just defer? The reason I ask is because it might be possible to waive your in-school deferment and start making qualifying PSLF payments immediately after consolidating. Not sure how well that would fit into your budget though.   I am considering prioritizing the private loan, doubling up on payments, and trying to get rid of that bad boy ASAP.   Good plan. The private loan should definitely be your top priority in terms of paying extra since it has a high interest rate and won't be eligible for any flexible repayment options or forgiveness."

StudentLoans,3a7rdl,ANGR1ST,2,Thu Jun 18 16:17:26 2015 UTC,"Not really. Loans have interest (and origination fees). The faster you pay them the less you pay in interest overall.  I wouldn't reject anything they offer you. Take it all, wait a little while, then make a payment with the stuff you don't need.

Not sure what year your wife is going into but she meets the criteria for an independent student so the numbers you want to look at are in the right column. She may also be eligible for Perkins loans on top of those amounts, depending on your level of need.  If you need to borrow beyond the federal limits, well, that's where it gets more difficult. I would strongly recommend starting at a community college so you can keep your costs to a minimum."
StudentLoans,3a6aa9,DO-MF-C,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"awesome, thanks.  The local college is akin to a community college in price, if I'm not mistaken."
StudentLoans,3a6xhe,Davek804,7,Wed Jun 17 18:31:03 2015 UTC,"Have you read the rules regarding reimbursement terms thoroughly? My job does the same, but clearly states that reimbursement is NOT repayment and they will not repay student debt. That clause is likely there to prevent people from using it to pay down debt. They hired you in part due to your education. They want to pay for the education because you'll be more valuable to the company after you are more educated."
StudentLoans,3a6xhe,Vexxinic,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"I think you're pretty much correct. The problem is that our benefits package only discusses this benefit in terms of reimbursing new education expenses. That is pretty much solidly stated. ~EDIT: I should note, to answer your question - no, it doesn't explicitly say it cannot be used to pay down education debts.   I just wonder if there is a few to position yourself well in a discussion with someone in your hierarchy to try to bend this policy towards debt repayment. Like I said in the OP, I saw an article of companies offering both things distinctly as a way to pull in younger workers and wondered if there would be an effective way to ask for this (education reimbursement) to be applied to previous education.   Shot in the dark, really. Thanks for the reply none the less."
StudentLoans,3a6xhe,Vexxinic,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"Depending on the size of your company its worth a shot, but if its a big or even some medium sized companies I wouldn't bother.

Refinanced student loans do not typically come with in-school deferment so unless you plan on working full-time while attending school, you would be setting yourself up for a really shitty situation."
StudentLoans,3a6sng,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:20:57 2015 UTC,"Great question! SoFi does offer in-school deferment if you go to grad school; however, we do require interest-only payments, and there is additional information you should be aware of. Please give us a call to discuss more in-depth! https://www.sofi.com/contact-us/"
StudentLoans,3a6sng,SoFiCommunity,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:54:28 2015 UTC,"That's not really deferment though if you're still required to make interest-only payments.  Edit: Based on OP's numbers, this would mean paying about $300 per month while in school. It's more affordable than $455 per month but not as affordable as the actual deferment ($0 minimum) they mentioned being available through their local credit union."
StudentLoans,3a667g,stoopidemu,2,Wed Jun 17 15:17:21 2015 UTC,For federal student loans (FAFSA)-they won't look at your credit worthiness at all. They won't pull the report.

StudentLoans,3a667g,MPTPWZ1026,3,Wed Jun 17 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"Grad PLUS loans actually do have a credit check component now, but credit limit plays no role. You can leave your card as is and still get loans."
StudentLoans,3a667g,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:05:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not.  There is no credit check on federal Stafford loans. Grad PLUS loans will require a modest credit check but they don't give a shit about your credit limits. The only things they're looking for are negative marks like defaults, accounts in collections, bankruptcy, foreclosure, tax liens, etc. Assuming you do not have any of those things on your credit report, you will be fine."
StudentLoans,3a6e23,amandalibre,3,Wed Jun 17 16:13:59 2015 UTC,"I applied online to So-Fi and DRB and was denied for both due to credit. I find this kind of funny because the ONLY bad marks on my credit are 1) a few 30-60 day late payments on my college loans during my first year out of college and 2) the sheer amount that I owe vs my income (which is a bit over 50k).   I'm not at all surprised you were denied. Companies like SoFi don't offer student loan refinancing because they want to make people happy; they do it because taking over people's student loans can be highly profitable when you only pick borrowers with high incomes and excellent credit who require no assistance and are pretty much guaranteed to make all of their payments on-time. Having a steady job and an average credit score is not enough to qualify for a private refinance, especially if the amount you owe exceeds your annual salary.   Since they have the same interest rates as some of the federal ones, would it make sense to pay off some of the federal unsubsidized loans first?   Given that the federal balances are relatively small and your income is too high to qualify for IBR/PAYE, I think this is a reasonable approach.    If it is best to pay off the private loans first, would it lower the monthly payments if I put extra money towards the private loans every month? Or would it just mean I pay off the loan sooner?   This is sort of a tricky question. Generally speaking, prepaying a loan does not reduce your overall monthly minimums. The only way to do that is would be to pay off a loan in full. (This is why paying down the smallest balances may be more advantageous.)  With that said, student loans have a somewhat unique feature called ""advancing the due date."" If you prepay your loans by enough, your account information may indicate that your next payment is not due for a while. The point of this is to allow borrowers to pay in lump sums vs. monthly installments (which is particularly useful for those living overseas). In most cases, I would advise you to just ignore the $0 amount due and continue paying at least the minimums every month.  Edited for clarity."
StudentLoans,3a6e23,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:21:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.  You confirmed my suspicions, so I think I will go with paying off the higher interest federal loans first. This is also the most satisfying option--it does feel good to make some of the loans go away, even if they are the smaller ones.  After I do that, I'll then work on paying down the private loans by paying more than the minimum balance.  With SoFi and other private lenders, I know the bottom line is that they are business trying to make a profit--I guess I just didn't think I was that high risk. I find this whole student debt situation to be a kind of catch-22: If I had a much higher income and better credit then I probably wouldn't have the need for a personal loan. But I guess this is really a blessing in disguise.  Thanks again!"
StudentLoans,3a6e23,xtrexjpsouz,2,Wed Jun 17 17:33:39 2015 UTC,I find this whole student debt situation to be a kind of catch-22: If I had a much higher income and better credit then I probably wouldn't have the need for a personal loan.   Yep. That's exactly it. The people who would benefit the most from refinancing (those with high interest rates and unaffordable monthly payments) are the ones who will probably never qualify.
StudentLoans,3a6e23,ANGR1ST,2,Wed Jun 17 17:35:29 2015 UTC,"Are the private loans fixed or variable rate? Fixed makes me less inclined to pay them first.  How secure is your job? If you lose your income IBR can bail your ass out with the Federal loans, not with the Privates.  Look at a calculator like unbury.me and it'll show you your payoff options.  Since you're in graduate school ... can you not get an in-school deferment? That's stop payments on your federal loans, and subsidize interest on those loans. Then you can focus all the money you want to on a single loan."
StudentLoans,3a6e23,ANGR1ST,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"The private loans are fixed.  My issue with the benefits for federal loans like IBR is that my private loans are 2/3 of what I owe. If I ever experienced financial hardship, IBR for 1/3 of my loans wouldn't really be that helpful.  For the first few semester of graduate school I took two classes a semester (while working full time--I really don't know how I did that).  During that time I had total deferment on subsidized loans and was paying quarterly interest on the other loans. However, I decided to just take one class per semester; so, while I have to pay loans now, I am only paying for one class. If I went back to taking two classes per semester, I wouldn't have enough money to save up to pay off a loan."
StudentLoans,3a60ru,ihaznomonies,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"It seems as though one of my banks is willing to give me the loan provided I can provide a co-signer in good standing which eliminates my entire family as I was told I don't have enough of a credit history on my own to get approval. Is there anyway to get around this?   You can try a different lender but I suspect the answer is going to be the same. Almost all private loans require a creditworthy co-signer. It protects the lender in the event that you default. This is especially important given that you are currently living in a foreign  country and could (theoretically) decide never to return to the United States.   I checked through FAFSA and this is one of the foreign schools that can be covered by government loans.   So why aren't you looking into federal loans? As a graduate student, you should be able to borrow up to the full cost of attendance between Direct Unsubsidized loans and Grad PLUS loans. No co-signer required."
StudentLoans,3a60ru,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:08:31 2015 UTC,Ahh. That was typo. It isn't one of the foreign schools covered. So I guess I'm just screwed.

You need a JOB on the weekend.  What kind of loans do you have? Federal? Private? What are the balances and interest rates? We need more information to help you.  If they qualify for PSLF you can get on IBR and pay a small fraction of your disposable (discretionary?) income every month. After 10 years the balance is forgiven if you're working for a qualifying government agency (schools usually count).   (Oh, I don't teach math or science)   Good. Hope you don't teach home ec either.

I would highly recommend this for two reasons:  1) It will make your monthly payments more affordable (15% of discretionary income).  2) It will put you on track for Public Service Loan Forgiveness which could completely wipe out your loans after 10 years of qualifying repayment, depending on where you work. You mentioned a ""teaching salary"" so there is a good chance you qualify. You could also look into Teacher Loan Forgiveness after 5 years but this requires working in a specific type of school."

There are several, and the rules for qualifying for them vary slightly from one to the next, but they all set your payments based on your income.  If you are teaching at a nonprofit or public school, then you should qualify for forgiveness of whatever isn't paid in just ten years.   If you are in a union, ask your union rep (or visit your union website) to look for additional state and local aid programs for teachers."

Yes. You don't have to refinance all of your loans. Just pick the ones with the highest interest rates and leave the rest for snowballing.   Monthly income of around 2800$ (am a nurse) Credit score around 730 (refinancing shouldn't be too tough?)

StudentLoans,3a49ci,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:57:16 2015 UTC,"A breakdown of loans and types would help a lot. If you just graduated in May, you are still in your grace period and not making payments - once you start repayment, you just make one payment to (each, if multiple) servicer and it gets divided proportionally among loans. If you pay extra, you can choose the loan to which it is applied.   If you are going into nursing you might very well qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, so you should apply for that as soon as possible - your eligible loans will be shifted to FedLoans servicing. You should also apply for one of the income-based repayment methods. Assuming you mean a $2800 monthly gross income and are single, your Federal monthly payment should be around $200/month."

StudentLoans,3a49ci,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:37:29 2015 UTC,"If everything is in your name, you can always refinance through a private company. You do lose some options for deferment and flexible repayment plans.   If you wrap all your loans into one new loan, sure, you lose the option to snowball or avalanche, that is true. Yes it is not as fun as paying off Group D which has a $900 loan at 9%, but if the overall interest rate is lower, why not go right ahead and just save the money?   It's worth it, IMO. I wrote up my whole refinancing experience here: http://davidjkelley.net/?p=157  My experience was interesting, actually. I still get to do avalanche as I found a way to switch myself from co-borrower to primary borrower on one of my old loans (8.890%!!!), and thus make myself eligible to refinance it. This was after already having refinanced all my other loans. The interest rate on that second refinance was slightlyyyy higher than my first refinance, and the balance is lower. So by overpaying that new second refinance, I actually am snowballing and avalanching at once. So that is nice.   End of the day, if you chop your interest rates down by 3%, who cares? You're gonna save a lot of money just by refinancing if you keep your repayment period similar.   Remember to use a calculator like http://Payoff.io to plug in some hypothetical loans with your repayment plan to see how different plans/options will save you money.   Best of luck!"
StudentLoans,3a3xmg,david12795,5,Wed Jun 17 01:09:17 2015 UTC,"The exit counseling to be completed at studentloans.gov is a federal requirement for students who borrowed stafford loans.  It is likely your school might place some sort of hold on your account until completed.  Anyway, it shouldn't take you any longer than about 30 minutes to complete the tutorial.  Your school should receive the record within 24-48 hours.    You can decrease your interest rate by .25% by signing up for auto-withdrawal for your payments with your lender.  You can always make larger manual payments above and beyond the minimum that is withdrawn."

StudentLoans,3a3xmg,xtrexjpsouz,2,Wed Jun 17 01:38:59 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about paying off the ones with the highest interest rate first.   This is the best approach in terms of long-term interest savings. Note that, once you enter repayment, you're going to have to pay at least the minimums on everything though. Only extra payments can be targeted towards the loan(s) of your choice.   The representative i spoke with on the phone said i should pay off each of these loans per month to avoid higher interest rate (?).   I'm not sure what they meant by this. Maybe they were suggesting that you pay off all of the outstanding interest first to avoid capitalization? If so, this is not the best approach from a mathematical standpoint. You are better off putting everything you can towards the loan with the highest interest rate.   This may be a school specific question (and i would call my school, but they are closed ATM) but did anyone have to do some sort of ""exit counseling""?   Yes. Exit counseling is mandatory.   Also, this may seem like a ridiculous question but is it possible to decrease the interest rate?   Yes. Signing up for auto-debit through your loan servicer will automatically reduce your interest rates by 0.25%.  Refinancing can also lower your interest rates if you have a high income and excellent credit... but your rates are already really low so I wouldn't bother, especially given that refinancing would force you to give up all of the flexible repayment options associated with federal loans."

StudentLoans,3a3xmg,xtrexjpsouz,0,Wed Jun 17 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"The only way you can lower your interest rate would be to consolidate or refinance. Some servicers offer interest rate reductions for signing up for automatic payments, other than that, those rates are set for the years you took out the loans by the department of education.   Best thing you can do to avoid paying the most amount of interest over the life of your loan is to make your level payments. AND DO NOT USE FORBEARANCES IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. They capitalize the interest and compound it into your primary balance. You graduated college, I shouldn't have to explain why that's bad.   Depending on your income, make larger payments when you can and just get them over with. Each year you get a tax return just pay them as much as possible. Student loans can become a big problem really fast if you just think you can get by with out paying.   However if you do come upon hard times there are options available. Your loans are rather small and your payments shouldn't be that much. If they are too high look into a graduated plan, you'll make smaller monthly payments starting out bit they increase every two years. Your first 2 years of payments will only target the interest to prevent the balance from increasing, then they increase every two years to start aggressively paying off the principal. You'll pay more interest vs the level plan, but you have smaller payments starting out.   Make and stay on the level plan is the best option, your patents stay the same and you'll pay the least amout of interest possible"

I went to the actual bank branch but they told me to apply for the loan online. If you are interested in private lenders your school's financial aid office may have information on trusted/preferred lenders.  Before you do that though I would speak to a financial aid counselor about this specific situation if you haven't already. At my school there are lots of little scholarships here and there that can add up fast, especially for summer semesters since there are so few students vying for the funds.  If you're not taking summer semesters may I ask what you're doing with your summer? Any way you can pick up a/another job and start saving towards the out of pocket expenses?

But, that's slightly different from state to state(assuming you're in the U.S).

StudentLoans,3a2oun,AhabTheTentmaker,3,Tue Jun 16 19:29:25 2015 UTC,"I know that subsidized loans defer payments as long as I'm in school, what I'm worried about is that if I pay the interest now, I will start owing money.   To clarify: All federal loans are deferred while you are in school. Subsidized loans are interest-free during that time. Unsubsidized loans are not. Given that you already have outstanding interest on your account, it sounds like your loans are unsubsidized.  And no, making payments while you're in school WILL NOT force you into repayment early. You will still get your full in-school deferment and grace period no matter what.   Can I preemptively pay the interest to help my in the future, or will this back fire on me?   Yes, you definitely can pay the interest while you are in school. There are no prepayment penalties on student loans.  Note: If you make a payment within 120 days of disbursement, you can have the payment applied as a ""refund"" which means they will apply the payment to the principal balance and reverse any interest that may have accrued on that balance to date. In other words, it'll be like you never borrowed the money in the first place."

So the effect of the deduction really depends where you are in the tax brackets. Like it can be significant if you are at the bottom of a tax bracket and in a lower bracket.

However, if you're aiming to lower the interest rates, Private consolidation absolutely could help.   Now, doing so will make these all PRIVATE loans, and you would waive all the protections and privileges that come with federal loans. Are you comfortably making the standard payments? If you need Income-Driven repayment or have concerns with employment prospects, then absolutely don't consolidate.

I'm currently on IBR right now, would it be better to just keep making payments on IBR and paying off the loans 1 by 1?

StudentLoans,3a288u,Waffle_Bot,2,Tue Jun 16 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"Consolidation will take a weighted average of your interest rates and round it up to the nearest 1/8th of a percent, so it will actually cost you more money.  Refinancing your debt with a private company may reduce your interest rate, but you will lose the Federal protections and payment plans.  Check to make sure that IBR is actually giving you lower minimum payments than other repayment plans.   To pay your loans most efficiently and effectively, you want to make sure that you have as much money as possible to pay towards the highest interest rate first.  When loans have the same interest rate, pay the smaller balance first to free up some cash flow more quickly."

StudentLoans,3a2mpg,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:38:57 2015 UTC,"Would this be a better investment than dorming on campus?   Probably not. Keep in mind that the mortgage is not your only expense when you buy a house. You will also have to pay for property taxes, homeowners insurance, repairs, maintenance, utilities, internet, trash pick-up, etc. These expenses add up. Also, repairs and maintenance are highly unpredictable. It's not unusual for a homeowner to get hit with a $1,000+ bill at any point in time.   Is there any apparent downside to doing this?   Yes. There are a lot of downsides, in addition to the ones I already mentioned above.  You probably won't qualify for a mortgage while you are a student due to minimal income and credit history. You also need to put at least 3.5% down. Most college students don't have that kind of cash available upfront.  Even if you do qualify for a mortgage, buying a house when you don't plan on staying in the same place for a while is generally a bad idea. There is no guarantee you will be able to sell the home when you want to sell it. Additionally, transaction costs are very high; you'll have to pay closing costs when you buy and realtor commissions when you sell.  If on-campus housing is too expensive, look into renting. You should have no trouble finding an apartment for less than $10K per year."

They do have forgiveness after something like 25 years of making on time payments, but any forgiven balance is considered taxable income (unless you work in certain fields like public service), so that's something to consider."
StudentLoans,3a15t9,rvtjess,2,Tue Jun 16 13:01:01 2015 UTC,"To clarify: Who is servicing all of these loans? Are they with three separate loan servicers, or just one?   I cannot consolidate them (as far as I know. One set was already consolidated back in 2004).   If they're all federal loans, I'm fairly certain you can still consolidate them. I don't think it's going to help you though. Federal consolidation doesn't do anything to make your loans cheaper (the interest rate is just a weighted average, rounded up) and you won't be able to aggressively pay down individual loans anymore since they'll all be lumped together.  With that in mind, if you want to use an income-driven repayment plan (like IBR) you're going to have to put all of your federal loans on that plan, not just the one group. Same with the extended plan since you typically need at least $30K in debt to use it and your last set of loans isn't big enough by itself. Not sure about the graduated plan.   I just worry that it will mean I end up paying a lot more in the future on it.   Any time you extend repayment, you're going to end up paying more in long-term interest. That's basic math. Also, paying less on your highest-interest loans so you can knock out your lowest-interest loan is the exact opposite of what you should be doing (from a mathematical standpoint). I can understand the psychological benefits of knocking out the smallest loan first, but you're going to end up spending a lot more money than you save. You're essentially borrowing money at 6% to pay off a loan at 3.75%."

If those first two loans are private, you're not going to be able to use IBR or extended repayment because your federal loan balance is too low. Graduated repayment might be an option but keep in mind that the payments are going to increase significantly every two years... and if your income doesn't go up along with it, you might not be able to afford the minimums anymore.  I don't usually recommend federal consolidation but if you're ever really in a bind and can't afford the minimums on all of your loans, it might be worth considering for that last group of loans. Consolidation won't save you any money but it'll allow you to stretch out repayment for another 10 years."

StudentLoans,39zuht,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:11:58 2015 UTC,"How much do you owe in total and what are the monthly payments? Have you already maxed out your federal loan options from the FAFSA? I wouldn't normally recommend this since it's not really a legal use for a federal student loan... but if you haven't already maxed them out, perhaps you could increase the amount you borrow in federal loans and use that money to make the monthly payments on the TO loans until you find another job?"
StudentLoans,39zuht,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:59:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds like some sort of private loan. Unfortunately, most private lenders are very stingy with deferment and forbearance and they are under no obligation to offer flexibility in the event that you cannot afford your monthly payments. Have you tried contacting the lender directly to see what options you have (if any) while unemployed?  If you aren't eligible for deferment/forbearance and they refuse to help you in any other way, you may have to stop paying and let the loans default. Obviously, this isn't an ideal solution... but food and housing should be the top priorities. If you can't pay your loans, you can't pay them."
StudentLoans,39z9ao,iliekmusik,5,Tue Jun 16 00:09:52 2015 UTC,Maybe. My federal consolidation with old Sallie/Navient deferred when I went back to school. You'll have to ask potential lenders/read the fine print.
StudentLoans,39z9ao,Brandon432,3,Tue Jun 16 04:07:59 2015 UTC,"Federal loans always come with in-school deferment regardless of the loan servicer. Sounds like OP has private loans though, in which case, in-school deferment is probably not going to be available once they refinance/consolidate. I agree they need to check with the lender to be sure."
StudentLoans,39z9ao,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:41:56 2015 UTC,All of my private loans deferred when I went back too. I had not consolidated them though.
StudentLoans,39z9ao,Brandon432,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:31:27 2015 UTC,Right. Private loans come with some in-school deferment but that usually goes away after you refinance.
StudentLoans,39z9ao,xtrexjpsouz,2,Tue Jun 16 14:42:51 2015 UTC,Yep. Pretty sure it depends on the repayment plan.

StudentLoans,39z9ao,xtrexjpsouz,3,Tue Jun 16 13:12:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you really need to clarify in the OP that these are private loans (not federal) and that you are looking to refinance. Private loans do not typically come with additional in-school deferment after they are refinanced because the expectation is that you are already finished with school. You'll have to check with the lender to be sure."
StudentLoans,39z9ao,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:39:28 2015 UTC,I guess my question becomes: is there a lender that will refinance your private student loans in a way that will allow you to defer them later if you want to go back to school?
StudentLoans,39z9ao,Betsy514,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:27:38 2015 UTC,"I won't say it's impossible because every lender has different rules which often change from year to year... but generally, refinances are intended for low-risk borrowers who are done with school and will pay their loans on-time every month without needing any flexible repayment options or forgiveness. That's how these companies are able to offer low interest rates and still make money.  With that said, it certainly doesn't hurt to do some research and ask each potential lender if they offer in-school deferment... but there is a very good chance they will say no. If that is the case, I would encourage you to wait until you are completely finished with school before refinancing."
StudentLoans,39zow1,2thDKer,3,Tue Jun 16 02:21:40 2015 UTC,Yep pay off the highest interest debt first.
StudentLoans,39zow1,nolancamp2,2,Tue Jun 16 04:05:50 2015 UTC,Ignore the interest capitalization. Just pay off whichever loan has the highest interest rate.
StudentLoans,39zow1,ANGR1ST,2,Tue Jun 16 04:09:05 2015 UTC,"High interest first.  The idea of capitalized interest confuses people. Once you're in repayment, all interest is essentially capitalizes (i.e. interest accrues on unpaid interest from the previous period). ""Deferred interest"" before capitalization just means the bank was only charging interest of principal for a while."
StudentLoans,39zow1,Brandon432,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:10:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, pay off the highest-interest loan first. Capitalization isn't going to make your 6.2% loans more expensive than the 7.2% ones."
StudentLoans,39zdku,batmanlight,4,Tue Jun 16 00:46:41 2015 UTC,"By Phoenix university, do you mean the online school ""university of Phoenix""? Firstly I'd advise against taking classes from them at all.   Firstly fill out the FAFSA. There's a couple of things you might qualify for. Everyone qualifies for unsubsidized loans (you don't have to pay in school, but interest accures).   Second is subsidized loans. These don't accure interest while you're in school.   Then there's grants. These are great. You never have to pay them back. They might qualify as income. I'm not sure, I have only ever been eligible for unsubsidized.   There are also Parent Plus loans. I don't know much about these as my parents don't support me.   Next is private loans. Avoid if possible. Sallie Mae and Wells Fargo are the biggest providers. As far as I know Sallie Mae tends to have better rates, but at the cost of shitty customer service and a complicated website.   Again, avoid university of Phoenix. If you need pre-requisites for nursing, go to a real school. Many have online programs. And please, for the love of God, don't get your RN online."

I've contacted every grad school or nursing program that I want to apply to and not only do they take phoenix online courses- they suggest it since the classes run every month or so and that considering I'm post grad, it would be cheaper than non-matriculated. Also the fact that I wouldn't have to fight for a spot in the class, as with a CUNY, all the matriculated students are given priority. Plus they aren't the major classes, I've taken the bulk at a 4 year (being pre med I've only missed classes like stats and A and P2)"

I'd also strongly recommend continuing to work in some capacity while you're in school. Doesn't need to be full time, but a decent part time gig (one that you can read/study while ""on the clock"" is perfect if you can find them) will help offset your living expenses a good bit.

Are your parents willing to take out loans for you? You didn't mention them anywhere in your post.  The good thing about Parent PLUS loans is that they come with most of the same flexible repayment options and protections as other federal loans. The downsides are that they have significantly higher interest rates (6.84%) and they're in a parent's name, so if you wanted to take advantage of something like hardship deferment or Income Contingent Repayment, eligibility would be based on the parent borrower's income (not yours)."
StudentLoans,39z56n,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:58:52 2015 UTC,My parents would be willing to take a loan out for me.  However they are in their 4th year of paying for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that they started in 2011.     Do you know if interest accrues on the Parent Plus and Federal Loan Start immediately after the loan is taken out or does it start after I've (hopefully) graduated?
StudentLoans,39yqe2,throwaway-popcorn12,2,Mon Jun 15 21:44:21 2015 UTC,"Nope, avoid Variable loans at all cost...especially considering it's for a 10 year plan. Economic cycles typically last 8-10 years, so you could be looking at volatility in rates.  Second, have you heard of Income Based Repayment with the federal loans? That should lower your payment considerably. Then you can just apply the remainder to the private loans. By hitting the private loans hard you can probably have it paid of in 2-3 years."
StudentLoans,39yqe2,ThemApples007,3,Tue Jun 16 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"First of all, is it ever a good idea to take out a variable loan?   Yes. If you are confident that you can completely pay off the loan in a short period of time, a variable rate can be a good choice.   Sure, it could be 4.42% now but they max it out at 8.99%, so there is the possibility that the whole economy goes to hell and I end up with 115k in loads with an 8.99% interest rate... right?   To clarify: High interest rates are actually a sign of a strong economy, not a weak one. That's why variable rates have been extremely low since the recession in 2008/2009.   Second, any speculation on why the Earnest loan looks like it is similar in interest to the federal/private loan but the repayment period would be so much less?   It's because you are not actually on a 25-year repayment plan for both sets of loans. If you were, your combined monthly minimums would be closer to $750.  Are you sure your federal loans aren't on IBR? If they are, note that 25 years is the maximum amount of time you can be in repayment before the remaining balance is forgiven. Some IBR borrowers will pay off their loans well before that, even just paying the minimums. It depends entirely on your income."
StudentLoans,39yqe2,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I thought IBR was only applicable to 10 year payment terms, sounds like I need to call Navient and clarify with them.  I know that I looked at the IBR option and the minimum payment was higher than the 10 year minimum payment because of my income.  I'll call and get more info and report back, thanks for your response!"
StudentLoans,39yqe2,xtrexjpsouz,3,Mon Jun 15 22:10:53 2015 UTC,IBR payments can never be higher than the 10-year standard plan. I would definitely contact your loan servicer and find out what type of repayment plan you are currently on.
StudentLoans,39yqe2,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:13:54 2015 UTC,"So, I called both Discover and Navient... the 23k loan is on track to be paid off in 10 years... $287/mo   but the 92k is on a 30 year repayment plan $598/mo!!!  WTF!    I asked about IBR and they told me I had to make at or below 17.5k per year to qualify for an IBR, however I can apply for their ""Pay as you Earn"" plan in which the payment raises every two years and I will be paid off in 10 years.    The Earnest loan is sounding pretty sweet compared to my current situation, it puts me on track to pay off all of my loans between 12-14 years.  So I'm thinking maybe I should use the 36 months of forbearance that I have left with the federal loans and save the money, then refinance after the 36 months and apply all of the saved money to the new loan.    Thoughts?"
StudentLoans,3a07kx,Habeas-Porpoise,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:09:24 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like you have much to lose. Except if you refinance, you could end up paying more interest in the long run, if your new loan will be for a longer repayment term.   I'd look at the terms on your current SM Loan, and see if you would lose any borrowers assistance benefits: Are there forbearance options on your current loans, in-school forbearance (if you want to go back to school eventually)? Is the rate fixed or variable?  Are the loans your credit union offers private student loans or general unsecured loans? If they are unsecured loans AND lower interest then definitely refinance with your credit union. Unlike student loans, general unsecured loans are eligible for bankruptcy, which is a great consumer protection if you ever find yourself in financial ruin.  Lastly, also look into Earnest. I refinanced with them and am happy I did it. They offer competitive rates and are flexible. For example, I signed up for auto pay and split my payment into two payments a month (one payment each paycheck), cutting the total amount of interest I pay. You're allowed to switch between variable and fixed interest rates once every 6 months. They also allow you to skip one payment a year without getting approval, and offer 3-years of in-school forbearance if you are looking to go back to school.   Remember, make sure you only refinance private loans. You don't want to refinance federal loans, as you will lost all your borrower protections."

StudentLoans,39xcvb,tubaKhan,4,Mon Jun 15 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"Your first step is to put together a detailed budget and figure out how much you can afford to pay towards your loans every month. Make sure you account for the fact that income taxes, payroll taxes, and health insurance premiums will eat up at least 25% of your gross income.  Once you have that figured out, plug your numbers into unbury.me. This will give you a payoff date and total interest paid based on whatever amount you decide to pay each month.  FWIW, if you wanted to pay off $200,000 in student loans in 5 years (assuming an average interest rate of 6%), you would have to pay nearly $4,000 per month towards your loans. This is probably not going to be realistic on a combined gross income of $100,000.  Edit: Personally, I would consider anything shorter than 10 years to be a win in this situation."

There's no fee for requesting more frequent disbursements - but they can also refuse to do that for you.  It's not just a matter of them posting the extra disbursements - there are regulatory requirements of a whole process they have to go through every time they disburse federal funds.    $4K accrues about $20 per month in interest - that's not going to be tens of thousands of dollars.

Also know that depending on navinet's policy (or it may be federal policy, idk) payments at any time may need to be applied to any outstanding interest and fees before they will reduce the principle.  You'll just have to clarify with them so you know what to expect."
StudentLoans,39x1tg,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:27:58 2015 UTC,"This is correct. You cannot bypass the outstanding interest and have a payment applied to principal only. Interest accrues daily so there is always some outstanding interest to be paid, even if it's just a couple of dollars. Once the outstanding interest is paid, the rest of your payment will go towards the principal."

StudentLoans,39ydm2,amazon_fish,3,Mon Jun 15 20:15:41 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that if one day the US govt decided to make student loans discharged in bankruptcy court or forgive all student loans (wild dream this last one) that it will only apply to Federal loans.    Yea, that's not going to happen. Ever.  Never used SoFi, but there are a lot of posts around here that indicate they're pretty good. One thing to be concerned about is losing Federal protections like IBR if you convert a large balance of Federal loans to private. That's potentially a very big risk."

StudentLoans,39ydm2,xtrexjpsouz,2,Mon Jun 15 20:23:29 2015 UTC,"You won't have access to IBR at all if you refinance - and quite honestly, the fact that you're using this plan is a sign that your debt-to-income ratio may be too high to qualify for a refinance. It doesn't hurt to look into, but if you want to actually qualify for a lower rate, you're probably going to need a higher income (or a creditworthy cosigner).  Private refinancing is not designed to help people who are struggling to afford their monthly payments. It's designed to make money off borrowers who pose little to no risk to the lender."

Sounds like you may have a budgeting problem."

StudentLoans,39ydm2,rockcece,2,Tue Jun 16 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"Refinancing federal loans through a private lender like SoFi would force you to give up all of the flexible repayment options associated with federal loans - things like Income Based Repayment, extended repayment, graduated repayment, hardship deferment, loan forgiveness, etc. This makes it a very risky move.  Additionally, the 1.90% rate they are advertising is a variable rate. Variable interest rates are currently at historic lows and have nowhere to go but up. If you plan on staying in repayment for a while (more than 5 years), I would not recommend a variable interest rate.  Finally, refinancing is not accessible to everyone. Private loans are credit-based. A lot of borrowers do not qualify due to poor credit and/or high debt-to-income ratio. Those who do qualify may not qualify for the low interest rate that they were hoping for.  Now, this is not to say that SoFi is a bad company. They are completely legit and have saved some borrowers a lot of money on interest. It's definitely not for everyone though."

StudentLoans,39ydm2,xtrexjpsouz,2,Mon Jun 15 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"At the time I did my refinancing, I had about 122k in student loans. Darien Rowayton Bank and Sofi are good options if you meet their requirements. They can be hard to be eligible for though. It is based on your school, degree, credit score, debt to income ratio, etc. I refi out of federal and into SoFi private and do not regret it one day. Staying with federal to take advantage of the income based plans forced me into lower paying jobs that would not allow me to advance my skills (in my area).  I battled with the fear of losing my more flexible payment plans (the various income based plans), the possibility of losing loan forgiveness if I wasted the first ten years of my career somewhere I did not want to be, and losing the safety net of deferment should hardship occur. But, I was paying over $700 a month in interest at my rate was 7.25%. Sofi offered 5.365 and DRB 4.9%. I took SoFi and have dramatically dropped what I pay in interest and am making a dent now. I chose SoFi due to them having deferment options and assistance in finding a new job if you should lose yours. Have not looked back since as I have freedom of job choice, much less interest, and still have a minimal safety net. For me, I have a secure job and multiple back up jobs so it was not as scary. I know its taboo to go from federal to private but it was the best financial decision that could be made for me. Just think about it carefully as you cannot go back"

StudentLoans,39ydm2,joejoe2213,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:04:07 2015 UTC,"""Screwed over"" may not have been the right choice of words.  My point was that mortgages can throw things off because, unless your spouse co-signs on the refinance, your income is the only one being considered... despite the fact that you're (presumably) splitting the cost of the mortgage and other related expenses with your spouse. This can make your overall debt-to-income ratio seem less manageable than it really is."

Below that info I had several columns such as payment date, running total, payment amount, and interest accrued. When interest was applied to the loan, I added it to the column and the date it applied. When I made a payment I entered the amount and the date. Both of those type of entries automatically adjusted the running total column. I paid minimums on all loans and as much as I could for one loan. It felt so good to see that loan hit $0.  edit2: I was able to adjust two of my loan's due dates so I could pay all of them on time at the same time.  edit: When I started repayment, I had an old version of MS Excel.

StudentLoans,39uh3n,smokingbarrel,2,Mon Jun 15 14:44:15 2015 UTC,"Are all of your loans federal? If so, I would suggest looking them up on the NSLDS to make sure you know who is servicing all of your loans. Hopefully it's just one or two different servicers.   What do I need to do to change addressing?   I'm not 100% sure what you mean by this. Were you planning on mailing your payments every month? If so, you really don't have to do this. Making payments online is a lot easier. You should also consider signing up for auto-debit through your loan servicers, as this will knock 0.25% off your interest rates.   Best way to collect and manage all the account data?   Mint is a great tool for general budgeting and keeping track of your loan balances/progress.   Is it too soon to try and refinance?   Let's step back for a second. There are two ways you could simplify your loan situation. The first is federal consolidation. You can apply for a consolidation while you are in your grace period. Unfortunately, federal consolidation tends to make your student loans more expensive so it's not really something I would recommend to most borrowers.  The second method is private refinancing. Refinancing can lower your interest rates but it depends on your current rates and how creditworthy you are. You will not be able to apply for a refinance until after you have been working and making payments for a while. Different lenders have different rules, but most will want to see you make at least 12 on-time payments on your student loans before they will allow you to refinance. You will also need a solid income and good credit to qualify. Furthermore, refinancing will convert your federal loans to private loans so if you decide to go this route, you're going to have to accept the fact that you will no longer have access to any flexible repayment options like IBR or hardship deferment.   making 1 payment instead of 8 a month would almost be worth the hassle I think   You're not going to be making 8 separate payments per month. You will be making ONE payment per servicer (so two payments total if your loans are split between Sallie Mae and Great Lakes). It doesn't matter how many individual loans you have."
StudentLoans,39uh3n,xtrexjpsouz,2,Sun Jun 14 22:38:19 2015 UTC,"What do I need to do to change addressing?  If so, you really don't have to do this.    Not exactly. Even if you're doing all correspondence electronically, they still need to know your correct address. If you manage to lock yourself out of your account, some of the re-set options are to mail a form/code to your address.  But the bigger problem is that the addresses are included on your credit report. This can cause problems when they don't all match. I was denied a card because one of my lenders automatically updated my address from the ""change of address"" paperwork we submitted to the post office for re-direction when my parents moved out of their house after I'd forgotten about it due to the electronic everything. Easy fix, but it took a month or two to get figured out and re-apply."

StudentLoans,39tmj5,Mizzou_Madman,2,Sun Jun 14 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"The government pays the UNSATISFIED interest every month.  So... That means if you are paying your interest amount before they do each month, they won't pay at all. They will only pay unsatisfied interest. And yes, first three years.   So, if I were you I would call your servicer and try to find out when the government pays each month, it is different for each servicer as far as I know. It may be hard to get an answer from your servicer but someone knows when the subsidy comes in. Just ask nicely about government paying unsatisfied monthly interest when your on IBR and then ask when they pay it. I would be surprised if they knew, but they can get an answer from a colleague.   If you can get this information you could possibly wait to pay each month until the subsidy pays ;), then make your payment THE DAY AFTER and your payment would be applied towards your principal balance (granted you don't have a large amount of interest you have let build up)   Wow, I kinda really went into that there, sorry about that haha But yeah, pay off that small loan."

The interest savings will be exactly the same regardless of the loan you choose because the interest rates are the same.

StudentLoans,39ps9f,lovelyrita10,9,Sat Jun 13 15:55:46 2015 UTC,"First, I'm very sorry to hear about your father.  Whoever told you that student loans are discharged when the co-signer dies was flat out wrong. Private student loans are never discharged when the co-signer dies... only if the student dies (and even then, no guarantees).  When you did your online research, I'm guessing you found information about auto-defaults associated with the death of a co-signer. Unfortunately, this is a thing. On the bright side, ever since the CFPB and the mainstream media got wind of this, it seems like lenders have been backing off on this policy... so it's entirely possible that nothing will happen as long as you keep making payments on-time.  If it were me, I would probably keep my mouth shut and just continue paying the loans as if nothing happened. If you have room in your budget, maybe start paying extra so you can get rid of the loans sooner rather than later."

I have 3x Private Student Signature loans from Sallie Mae, now owned/managed by Navient.  Low fixed interest, $107k total for all 3.  My father cosigned on all three of them, but I was wondering if I should try to have him removed as a cosigner.    I've been making payments perfectly on time for 5 years now, with a great credit score.  I just don't want him to be responsible for all that debt if I were to be hit by a bus tomorrow.  Alternatively, I wouldn't want my future wife or children to be responsible either.  This post adds another layer of concern, because what if my father died and I got stuck with an increased interest rate or other penalties because I no longer have a cosigner?  Is there any downside to requesting to have my father removed as a cosigner if Navient is willing to consider it?  I don't live in a shared property state (NY)."
StudentLoans,39ps9f,jpellizzi,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"If you have been making on time payments for that many years and have a great credit score - I absolutely think you should talk to them about removing the co-signer.  You're a great candidate for it.  If they refuse for some reason, look into private loan consolidation.  Same effect as long as you can find a similar interest rate."
StudentLoans,39ps9f,Betsy514,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:33:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply - I'll definitely look into it.  I guess my main concern is if something happened to me, would anyone else (spouse, children) be held accountable for my debt if I remove my cosigner?"

StudentLoans,39ps9f,Olue,3,Sat Jun 13 17:11:19 2015 UTC,You are still on the hook to pay these loans back.  Your lenders WILL be notified on your father's death.  What happens after that is up to them.  They MAY require you to immediately pay the outstanding balance.  They may just let you continue making payments.  It is best to get in contact with your lenders and not to ignore the situation.
StudentLoans,39ps9f,GreyWalker,2,Sat Jun 13 18:46:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't notify the lender unless the loan agreement required you to notify them of the death. There's no reason to do the lender's job for them, especially if they have a contractual right to accelerate the balance. Keep making payments, and maybe start looking into whether you could refinance the loan now with a company like SoFi with no cosigner."
StudentLoans,39ps9f,dalbert,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"The only difference now (I believe) is that if you default on the loans, the loan companies will no longer be able to go after your cosigners. The true reason for having cosigners is to protect the lender in the event that you bail on the debt.  I' sorry about the unfortunate news. Good luck to you moving forward. Cheers!"

I would send in a payment, then submit an email to them asking for it to be reapplied to a different loan in the group.  They always respond 24 hours later informing me they'd routed my request over to the payments department, and that I should wait 2-5 business days for it to be completed.  It always takes 5 business days, but they're usually pretty consistent.

The payment is applied to any interest on the loan which accrues daily, then the remaining amount to pricinpal.

But I think it would be perfectly reasonable to spread the forgiveness out over a period of years. $10k or 10% forgiven a year maybe. If the idea is to provide an incentive for people to work under served jobs, we should also provide an incentive to STAY in those jobs.  Probably not going to happen though."

I think Public Service Loan Forgiveness would be fine if there were limits limiting it based upon the nature of the degree and what a reasonable cost is to obtain it but IBR is already a huge benefit without forgiveness given how little they ask borrowers to repay.   Something like 50% of the initial reasonable cost of a degree after 10 years of minimal payments seems like a deal to me.   As a relatively responsible borrower the degree to which these programs can be abused by the irresponsible disgusts me. I borrowed and am paying it back. I don't think the taxpayers should have to pay for others poor decisions/irresponsibility/four year vacation excluding very narrow situations.   Dealing with my own poor decisions is enough without subsidizing those of others."
StudentLoans,39nzf5,mg85,8,Sat Jun 13 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"Here's what I would do (if you really can't afford the loans): default on the private loans and pay the Federal Loans. The federal government can always find you, take tax returns, garnish banks accounts, etc. Plus, they offer lower interest rates so it's easier to pay off.  The private loans are different. They need to go through the court system to sue, serve you, provide documents, argue their case, etc (similar to a credit card company). Statute of Limitations or ""SOL"" is typically 6 years for debt depending on your state. If it's a ""Contract under seal"" then the SOL can be longer.   Be prepared though, they will try to sue you after about a year, possibly sooner. I suggest living off cash, keep the bank account but keep minimal money in it. Additionally, open up a Private Mailbox in another state and have your mail forwarded to wherever you live. Make sure the last address on file with the Private Loans is the mailbox. Read DebtorBoards and ""How To Disappear"" by Frank Ahearn to learn how these companies operate. Just keep up with the federal loans or you'll have bigger problems to deal with.  I was in your shoes once. It sucks, but this is the America we live in. Everything is about debt, information and the law. It didn't have to be this way. Good luck and cheers!"

StudentLoans,39nzf5,Profugos,3,Tue Jun 23 04:22:17 2015 UTC,"I just want to give you props for thinking this through and doing the best you can.  To tag on to the other advice you've been given, I'd check out this site to see which payment plan will give you the lowest payment on your federal loans https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action  Once you have that in place, see how much that frees up for your private loans.  Give the lenders a call and see if they have any lower payment options for you - there used to be no point in doing this but the private loan lenders have been working with regulators the last couple of years and are now starting to be allowed to offer some options so it's worth a shot.  So - worst case scenario - you do all those things and still can't afford the private loan payments.  If they default, and I know this sounds dumb, but the private loan lenders are free to work with you more at that point.  A defaulted private loan is considered a charge off - which doesn't mean you don't owe it - it just means it counts on their books differently - which gives them the freedom to work with you a bit more.  If they won't - consider filing a complaint with the consumer finance protection bureau www.consumerfinance.gov - they have been working with the private loan lenders and have been able to help a lot of borrowers.  Doing all this shows good faith and makes it a lot less likely they will litigate.  That's expensive and if they can give you a better option - such as a lower interest rate or interest only payments for a while instead they will - or - they probably will."

StudentLoans,39nzf5,Scott_Eric,2,Sat Jun 13 04:53:16 2015 UTC,"*Disclaimer, I am not a student loan expert, just a fellow borrower that has struggled immensely and researched a lot on student loans. So first of all, Take a deep breath, it's going to be okay. You are not alone in this situation, many Americans are in similar situations. Remember that student debt (especially private student debt) is just a number that we attach emotion to. If you can't pay your private student debt, it's not the end of the world.  The advice from the other user is sound. Definitely continue to pay the federal loans, the federal government has much more collecting power, and they don't have to sue you to collect your wages, and there is no statute of limitations.   As far as the private loans,  they have to sue you to win a collection judgement. There is a statute of limitations, meaning they only have so much time to sue you or else the debt becomes un collectable. For example, in California, the statute of limitations is 4 years. However they probably will sue you. I noticed you have several private loans, do they have co-signers? If there are certain private loans without cosigners, if default is inevitable, default on those first. Any loans with a co-signer attached, the lender will also go after the co-signer and they're credit will be ruined. which makes for a messy situation.  My advice: Before you default, contact your lenders, see if they will work with you, by allowing you to pay only interest, or giving you a loan modification. Be careful about forbearance, because the interest will accrue and you will owe more later. Wells Fargo has a loan modification program, however when my loans were with them I had no luck getting it. But that doesn't mean don't try!  Contact your federal loan servicer and ask about their repayment plans. Federal loans are a lot more flexible, and you may be able to qualify for Income based repayment, and possibly not have to pay anything on your federal loans. You have to apply for this program before you default, once you default you can't apply for these programs!  If I were going to throw money at a loan, throw it at your highest interest private loan if you can afford it. Also, Sometimes it helps to throw money at your smallest loans, so you can pay them off and have more money to throw at larger loans (i.e. snowball effect).   Lastly, I know this can seem like crazy advice if you are unemployed/under employed, but, if you have defaulted on a private loan and don't see a way of bringing it back, save any money that you would normally pay for that loan, save as much money as you possibly can. When they sue you, you may have enough to offer them a lump sum settlement. If you have defaulted on a private student loan, also consider consulting an attorney who has experience with student loans. In some instances bankruptcy of student loans is possible, or in some cases lenders cannot prove that they own the debt if pressed to provide proof of ownership by a lawyer: You can find a lawyer practicing in your state here: http://thestudentloanlawyer.com/workshop-graduates/  Lastly: consider writing your congressman to do something about the student debt issue, such as restoring bankruptcy rights for student loans: http://www.petition2congress.com"

You can get out of default by rehabilitating or consolidating your debt. More info here."

StudentLoans,39nbsk,ThemApples007,4,Sat Jun 13 17:22:35 2015 UTC,"Here's the way I look at it: If you did everything you could to reasonably pay the debt and couldn't afford it, then the bank is at fault for lending you more money then you could afford. Similarly, if you're put into a lifetime of debt and can only pay the interest, or below interest, then your balance is going up, which means you'll face bankruptcy eventually, so you might as well feel the pain sooner than later and default.  All these morality arguments are totally unreasonable. Were the bailouts moral? Is banks lending money that they don't have moral? Why are people that default on debt considered to lack morals when it's called a ""good decision"" for corporations to strategically default on debt?  At the end of the day, if you're past the statute of limitations, then accept it as a gift. This means essentially the lender chose NOT to sue you, and therefore wasn't responsible in claiming that you owed the debt in the legally appointed amount of time. Hope this helps. Cheers!"

Most private education lenders require a co-signer, so if you decide to simply not pay your private loan, the bank and, eventually, the collectors to whom the lender sells the loans servicing rights to will go after you and the co-signer.  Personally, I think you could be setting yourself up for a lot of trouble both immediate and long term.  Planning to ever borrow money again to buy a house, car, etc.?

StudentLoans,39nbsk,ThemApples007,-1,Sat Jun 13 06:22:23 2015 UTC,"""than a reason not to pay the debt you agreed to as an adult""? Why do we insist on moralizing debt? Our founding fathers wrote bankruptcy into the constitution for a reason. They didn't want a nation of perpetual debtors! Bankruptcy is a vital part of a functioning capitalist society. People are encouraged to take on a healthy level of debt, and banks are encouraged to lend. It's always been a part of the American entrepreneurial spirit. Whether it's for a business, or going to college, people, and lenders, take the risk of borrowing/lending, and those that fail (usually) have a way out via bankruptcy. That's a good thing mind you. it keeps our capitalist system going. We can't permanently punish someone for making a bad bet. Like I said, that's the spirit of American entrepreneurialism.   You make it sound like a bank is lending out of the goodness of their heart. No, they're doing it to make a profit (and that's okay, to an extent). taking on debt, as well as lending a loan, is always a gamble. If someone ends up not being able to pay back their debt, it's just as much the banks fault for making a bad bet and lending the money to the person. But losing some of the money lent is a given, and banks write it into their interest rates.   Whether ""you agree to pay back a debt as an adult"" is completely irrelevant. It's called the lending industry, not an oath on your honor."

So why is it a morality issue for for the borrower? It's not. Banks operate for economic gain, not out of the kindness of their hearts.

I don't see you noticing that, for student debt, you can not default, but for private debt you can. Get any of those credit card offers in the mail?? To ensure financial security through both good times and bad, you should always transfer all of your debt into things that you can write off in a bankruptcy.

StudentLoans,39nbsk,MPTPWZ1026,4,Sat Jun 13 23:36:00 2015 UTC,This is terrible advice. Transferring student loan debt to a credit card so you can discharge it in bankruptcy is fraud and could have very serious legal consequences. More info here.
StudentLoans,39nbsk,xtrexjpsouz,0,Sun Jun 14 03:13:16 2015 UTC,"Umm...fraud is a very fluid term in today's world and often involves intent. Intent is not only a very difficult thing to prove, but it's a very costly legal process for the creditor. I can say with almost certainty that fraud cases aren't pursued frequently except for cases involving millions of dollars...such as Bernie Madoff, etc.  Just because someone put some student debts on their credit card, doesn't mean they'll be prosecuted successfully for fraud. And for those of you wondering, credit card debt has a lower Statute of Limitations, can be included in bankruptcy more easily and is generally easier to get off the hook from than student loans.  I'm not advocating anyone do this and I am not lawyer, but people deserve to be informed of how the system works. Simply not informing people that need information because someone has their own moral dilemmas is unethical within itself. Sometimes people just want a no BS answer."

You're right about this. Putting student debt on a credit card by itself is not fraud - turning around and filing bankruptcy on it is where you run into trouble.  Regardless, most student loan servicers don't accept credit cards anyway. Even if they did, credit cards tend to have much higher interest rates than student loans (and no forbearance) so it's kind of shooting yourself in the foot to do this."
StudentLoans,39nbsk,phonechargerdevice,-1,Sun Jun 14 14:14:25 2015 UTC,"so you can discharge it in bankruptcy   That's not the point. The point is that one type of debt is dischargeable,  the other is not, why would someone prefer to drown themselves in non-dischargeable debt? There's nothing fraud in avoiding it for the poison that it is. Hard times hit for everyone, it's just a fact of life. Someone prefering dischargable debt isn't commiting fraud in considering the contingencies that it might require getting discharged."
StudentLoans,39nbsk,MPTPWZ1026,3,Sun Jun 14 03:28:37 2015 UTC,"Actually, it won't get discharged in bankruptcy. Before discharge is provided, the courts look at the circumstances behind the debt. If they see that the main reason you are seeking bankruptcy is for credit card debt and that the debt consists of primarily student loans, they will exempt that debt from the discharge or deny discharge altogether on the basis of fraud. They won't be prosecuted necessarily, but they won't get that debt discharged either.  The courts aren't stupid. And neither are the credit card companies, which is exactly why most do not allow credit card payments."

StudentLoans,39nbsk,MPTPWZ1026,2,Sun Jun 14 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"That's funny considering the article starts off by saying, ""Read on to learn why this tactic may not work, and how you might end up paying more in attorney's fees,"" and then goes on to describe the adversary proceedings that a creditor can bring and the factors the court will consider in such a proceeding, just like I was talking about.  It goes on to say:  What Happens if the Court Does Not Wipe Out the Credit Card Debt?  If the bankruptcy court finds in favor of the credit card lender (meaning it rules that you cannot discharge the charges in bankruptcy), here's what might happen:   you will remain liable for the credit card charges the court might find that your entire credit card balance is not nondischargeable, not just the payments that went towards student loans you will probably have to pay your attorney a separate fee for defending the lawsuit, and you may have to pay the credit card company’s attorneys' fees and costs.   There's also this example it provides for when a creditor challenges discharge:  Example 1  Darla has a $5,000 student loan with a 6% interest rate. She uses a balance transfer check to pay off the student loan and move it to her new credit card. The credit card interest rate is 15%. Three months later she files a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The fact that she moved her balance to a card with a higher rate makes little financial sense unless she figured that she would not have to pay it. That, coupled with the fact that she filed a bankruptcy case shortly after the transfer, might indicate that she expected to discharge the obligation when she moved the balance. There's a good chance the credit card company will object to the discharge and that the trustee will agree.  You're right, I'm not an attorney and I'm not providing legal advice (you'd have to see an actual attorney for that rather than me or a NOLO article), but I did graduate from law school and am sitting for the bar this July. One of my last classes in law school was a Bankruptcy class, but you're right, I'm not completely informed. The Reddit community as a whole can't substitute for a licensed attorney in your area.  I never said you absolutely can't, but I have a pretty good idea that it probably doesn't happen too often and that it's highly unlikely to."
StudentLoans,39nbsk,Brandon432,0,Sun Jun 14 18:01:58 2015 UTC,"I never said that you absolutely can't...   Oh   Actually, it won't get discharged   Right. Anyway, anyone can go ahead and read the article for themselves as to the conditions for discharging student loan debt. In the meantime, I'll go on ahead and leave you with the last word on this."
StudentLoans,39nbsk,phonechargerdevice,2,Sun Jun 14 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"That's fine. The reality is that it won't get discharged if the creditor files an adversary proceeding and you can almost 100% guarantee that that will happen. No, it's not an absolute, but it's pretty close. A creditor isn't going to just let their debt get discharged and let their right to recover waste away. They want their money. Hence, why no, normally it won't get discharged.  This kind of debt getting discharged is the exception, not the rule. You indicated that the article said it does get discharged as if that is the norm. That is clearly not what the article is indicating. Instead, it's telling readers that trying to use this method may end up costing them more in the long run when they have to deal with extra litigation because they tried to work around the system."

You just have to know what you're getting into and make sure that the return will be worth it.  Once you have a realostic picture of what those loans actually cost you and get you,  you should minimize the loans as much as possible. It sounds like you're trying to do the last step, which is great. It also sounds like you've done the first part already. The problem is that so many people haven't.

These programs are typically geared towards adult/non-traditional students and tuition is usually cheaper. You can often choose any major of your choice & you usually have to take less of the BS electives, which will help save you money.

StudentLoans,39m7i9,Spygirl91,9,Fri Jun 12 18:45:08 2015 UTC,A refund payment is one made within 120 days of when the money was disbursed.  These have any interest and origination fees associated with them backed off - it's like if you never borrowed that portion of the money at all.  Do it - it's a saver.
StudentLoans,39m7i9,Betsy514,5,Fri Jun 12 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"Money paid back within 120 days of disbursement can be applied as a refund. My understanding is that when you choose to apply the payment as a ""refund"", it's basically as if you never borrowed the money in the first place. So it's you who is refunding the borrower, thereby lowering the principal. The interest is recalculated to accurately reflect the lower principal and it definitely saves you money. If you make a ""regular"" payment it goes toward interest and then principal. Think of a refund as a payment that goes directly toward lowering the principal."
StudentLoans,39m7i9,ga92,2,Fri Jun 12 19:06:26 2015 UTC,Im still not understanding the refund aspect of the loan. If I select the refund option is the money deducted from lets say my bank account and applied to the loan?
StudentLoans,39m7i9,ga92,4,Fri Jun 12 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"I figure it's called a refund because that's the best way to describe returning someone's money (which is what they consider payments made <120 days after disbursement). Either way, the money is still taken from your account and given to them.   Just to make the difference between a refund and a payment clear - let's say you borrow $1000, want to make a payment of $100, and have the option to choose between refund and payment.   Payment: Loan Balance = $1000 + (Interest - $100); I put the interest and $100 in parentheses to show that your payment will first be applied to the interest until that has been completely paid off. Refund: Loan Balance = $900 + Interest; The interest will be revised downward to reflect the fact that your principal is $900 instead of $1000   That may have been overkill, but I figured more clarity couldn't hurt. To summarize - you'll still pay the money, but applying it as a refund will save you over time, and you should definitely do that."

StudentLoans,39m7i9,rosythewench,2,Fri Jun 12 20:57:39 2015 UTC,"Lets say you took out a loan from me for $100. The terms setup are that you start paying me a year from now at 5% interest. And that the interest starts to accrue immediately from the time I give you the $100 dollars. So at the time you are meant to start paying the loan (a year later) you now owe me $105.  If within 120 days you come back to me and say ""I only needed $50, here is the rest back"" then I would refund you the $50 dollars and after a year is up you only owe me $52.5.  If I didn't have a refund policy I would say ""sorry, but you borrowed $100, we are going to treat this like a payment"" and you would owe something like $53.6."

There is no guarantee that you will be making what you expect to, and as you know private loans don't have forgiving repayment options, they will want that money back no matter what. Plus, for that size of loan, I'd imagine WF would want a co-signer, and you don't want a family member attached to a non-dischargeable debt.  There is a big student loan refinancing boom starting. Take the federal money now, and once you graduate, if you do make 200k, then at that point it would be safer for you to refinance with a private lender, and with that salary, you would be getting a better interest rate than you would from a private lender right now.   I'll end on a cautionary note. I highly discourage from borrowing that much money for  your MBA. You'll thank yourself later, even if you are making 200k. If you are getting tuition remission, then why do you need to borrow 165k? If you are making 20k in an internship, try to put as much of that as possible to rent while in school."

Wells Fargo has this Graduate Loan which has as low as a 3.00% variable rate.    Don't assume you will qualify for the best available rate... especially given how much you are planning to borrow. The advertised rates are based on a balance of $10K. The more you borrow, the greater the risk and the higher the interest rate. You also didn't indicate how good/bad your credit score is.

Find out what you actually qualify for (if anything) and use that information to make your decision.   Also, if I were to do this, I wouldn't want to take my entire program's cost out at once; would I just take two loans out, one year at a time? Or one each semester?

Also, this money is created out of thin air, loaned to banks at near zero level interest rates, then loaned to students at 6,7,8% rates.   All of that interest is sheer profit for banks and Uncle Sam.   Now add in the collection agency fees, which is even more profit tacked on.

StudentLoans,39m52j,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jun 12 21:07:04 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to offer some more details about your situation, we might be able to help you sort things out. Here is the information we typically need:   What are your annual incomes? What type of work do you each do? What is the breakdown of your debt? (Loan types, balances, interest rates, whose debt is whose)  How good/bad are your credit scores?"
StudentLoans,39m52j,skeach101,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:30:55 2015 UTC,"I am currently unemployed. My husband and I moved to California. He is starting a new job on Monday. Annual income: $55,000 Work: Me-Unemployed Him-Government Contractor We both have private subsidized and unsubsidized. We both have federal. It is a rather large breakdown. I could send all that at a later date. Credit score: Me- it used to be fairly good. Have not checked it in a while. It is good enough that I bank with a credit union. His is a tad on the lower side of things, it was a high six roughly 7 months ago."
StudentLoans,39m52j,SnakeFarmer,2,Fri Jun 12 21:06:37 2015 UTC,"private subsidized    I chuckled at that. Typo I'm sure.  Yeah, a breakdown would help. In general, you will want to get on IBR/PAYE immediately. From there you can focus on your private debt. What work will you be doing when you find a job? What's your major?  The loan breakdown will REALLY be useful here."
StudentLoans,39m52j,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:44:17 2015 UTC,I'll get you a breakdown this weekend.  My husband got way too many different loans...  I majored in English with a political science and a business administration minor at Stetson University.  The plan was law school... things change.
StudentLoans,39m52j,SnakeFarmer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:11:30 2015 UTC,I was able to consolidate mine through a credit union.
StudentLoans,39m52j,xtrexjpsouz,2,Sat Jun 13 12:01:14 2015 UTC,What you are referring to is a private refinance (which also consolidates the debt). I can't imagine they're going to qualify with over $300K in debt against only $55K in income.
StudentLoans,39m52j,SnakeFarmer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:32:04 2015 UTC,How much debt did you have when you consolidated?
StudentLoans,39lx3l,psykotikz1,4,Fri Jun 12 17:35:44 2015 UTC,I would not consolidate. Pay off the higher interest % loan first and avalanche the payments. Refinance once all loans with 5% or higher or paid off.
StudentLoans,39lx3l,shittywitte,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:56:57 2015 UTC,Sounds like a solid plan.
StudentLoans,39lx3l,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:06:04 2015 UTC,"When I ran the number it looks to be cheaper not to move forward with this. Am I missing something?   No, you are correct. Federal consolidation almost never saves you money. All they do is average your existing rates together and round up to the nearest 1/8th of a percent. Consolidation also typically involves stretching out repayment for longer than the original term. Longer term = more interest paid."
StudentLoans,39lx3l,Betsy514,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:32:22 2015 UTC,Yes - consolidating will actually give you a slightly higher overall rate - the prior comment is good advice - just pay them off early based on the higher interest rate
StudentLoans,39lwuv,Dixon82,3,Fri Jun 12 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"See here for information on basic student aid eligibility criteria.   In order to receive federal funding (loans, grants, or work-study), a student must be enrolled at least half-time as a regular student in an eligible program. My guess is that your certificate program is not accredited, therefore participants are not eligible to receive federal aid."
StudentLoans,39lwuv,rosythewench,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:02:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I also got some clarification from the school. Since the certificate program is only a one year program, I would not be able to get federal loan. However, they suggested a work-around: sign up for the associate's degree program, get the loan, then just take the classes for the certificate. It feels a little weird... but I was told they do it all the time."
StudentLoans,39mf6h,mrloaney,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:38:13 2015 UTC,"I think you need to do an excel spreadsheet with various repayment scenarios (yes it will take a while) and see which one will result in the desired scenario. For some, they don't mind paying more interest and would rather have more money in their pockets. For others, like myself, I don't want to pay a lot of interest so I'll try to pay it off within a reasonable amount of time to reduce amount of interest paid.   Don't forget about creating an emergency fund and budget accordingly. Head on over to /r/personalfinance and their wiki for budgeting ideas, user created excel sheets, and retirement."
StudentLoans,39mf6h,jiyounglife,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:19:42 2015 UTC,"When you apply for IBR/PAYE, you will be asked if your income has changed since you last filed your taxes. Given that you are currently earning ~$20K per year (plus a new side business) I'm guessing the answer to that question is ""yes."" At that point, you will be prompted to submit Alternative Documentation of Income which may disqualify you from IBR/PAYE.  Even if you are eligible for IBR/PAYE, you're probably only going to have reduced payments for a year or two. (Ignore the $0 estimates the federal calculator gave you. They're assuming you make $5,000 per year and only receive a 5% increase per year.) So personally, I wouldn't even waste my time with the application. Just stick to the standard 10-year plan and pay down the loans as aggressively as possible until they're gone.    Is there any chance I could have some of it forgiven completely?   The odds of you qualifying for forgiveness are slim to none. You're going to pay off the balance in full long before IBR/PAYE forgiveness kicks in... and even if you happen to work in a PSLF eligible job, it's not worth stretching out repayment for 10 years just to get a few hundred dollars worth of interest forgiven (especially given that paying down the loans more aggressively would have prevented that interest from accruing in the first place)."
StudentLoans,39hr6j,colindean,3,Thu Jun 11 20:14:49 2015 UTC,With IBR/PAYE there is no excuse to default on student loans.
StudentLoans,39hr6j,xavier86,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:43:30 2015 UTC,This. There are also very generous deferment and forbearance options.
StudentLoans,39hr6j,xtrexjpsouz,-5,Fri Jun 12 13:33:39 2015 UTC,"It's kind of funny this has so many upvotes considering the 'expert' they interviewed is much less obnoxious about people defaulting than many vocal people in this sub.  Still, it's a wonder so many 'experts' are coming out of the woodwork to urge people to pay their loans. it must be really nice to be apolitical and gainfully employed and tell people the kinds of decisions they should be making in their lives."
StudentLoans,39hr6j,a_pale_horse,5,Fri Jun 12 13:45:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, if you're never going to have wage income, don't plan to collect social security, never get tax refunds, don't purchase car insurance, never rent an apartment, never borrow money, don't require security clearance, and have no assets in your name, the consequences of student loan default aren't so bad!"
StudentLoans,39hr6j,aaronsweber,2,Fri Jun 12 14:12:51 2015 UTC,"yeah, they do try to make defaulting pretty unpleasant, that's for sure, although I guess I'm not sure I understand the whole attitude of 'you thought defaulting would be easy? well, it's not'. like, it seems sort of weirdly mean-spirited"
StudentLoans,39hr6j,a_pale_horse,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:31:33 2015 UTC,"True. I mean, very few people do it because it seems easy. They do it because they don't see any alternative.  Same with mortgage default. I mean, ""send in the keys and walk away"" sounds like a clean break but in most cases it's a real mess for everyone involved, including neighbors."
StudentLoans,39hr6j,aaronsweber,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:16:05 2015 UTC,"Here's why we encourage folks to apply for the lower payment, forgiveness and other options available to federal loan borrowers - that and the lack of statute of limitations.  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/your-money/taking-on-student-debt-and-refusing-to-pay.html?ref=education&_r=2"
StudentLoans,39hr6j,Betsy514,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:10:06 2015 UTC,"giving people information is fine, but I think when all you do is harm mitigation and crisis management without a political analysis or intent to create actual change, you're not ever going to change the situation that's creating the problem in the first place. not that I think that's what most people intend to do here - they're fine with things as they are, even if they might see them as a little unfair - but maybe you see the issue with claiming a non-political stance while advising people to continue funding the institutions that continue to profit from an unjust system."
StudentLoans,39hr6j,a_pale_horse,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:45:30 2015 UTC,"There is a time and place for fostering change and there's a time and place to try and prevent someone from making a mistake due to terrible advice.  This is the later.  Higher Education is what it is right now, and while many of us are actively engaged in activities and dialogues to try and improve it, encouraging people to flump down, cross their arms, squeeze their eyes shut and scream ""the system is unjust!"" is not only not going to change it, but will financially hurt those that engage in such a ""strategy"" in a significant way.  We need to encourage and promote dialogue on the U.S. policy on higher education as well as to encourage thoughtful legislative changes to improve the system.  The editorial that prompted this whole discussion was not that.   With that in mind, I'd love to see a new thread on reddit that focused on floating reasonable, achievable ideas, pilots, legislative and regulatory change that would improve the higher education system in the US."
StudentLoans,39kwjj,im_nitsirk,4,Fri Jun 12 13:12:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what to tell you. I can't imagine anyone is going to want to lend to you with a loan currently in default. (IIRC, private loans don't ""officially"" come out of default until you have paid the balance in full.)  What is your current income and how long do you have before this matter goes to court? The only other option I can think of is to cut way back on spending and sell a bunch of shit so you can afford to settle the debt in cash... but that may not be feasible if it's a very short time frame."
StudentLoans,39kwjj,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:31:49 2015 UTC,"You are correct. Went to 2 banks and no one wants to help in any way, even with my perfect repayment schedule to anything else. I make around $55,000 a year, but that also takes into account that more than half of my take home a month goes towards my student loans. I also have a car payment, no credit cards or other debt, and I rent - so I don't even have collateral to use towards a loan if I could go that way..  The lawyers haven't set anything in stone in regards to court, and honestly I don't have anything of value to sell. And I have no friends or family that could loan me money either.   It's not an ideal situation for me or anyone, but I'm doing the best that I can."
StudentLoans,39kwjj,cat_dev_null,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:27:29 2015 UTC,I wish mine were only $14k.  The interest is killing me.
StudentLoans,39io6e,paytiently,2,Thu Jun 11 23:58:27 2015 UTC,"The rep I talked to says they only look at credit scores   I find that hard to believe. The student doesn't need to have an income but co-signers typically do. If your wife's income is relatively low, that may have been a factor.   Does it have to do with the amount of the loan? ($45k in my case)   Yes. Larger loans are inherently riskier than smaller loans, so they tend to have higher interest rates in general.  Lenders usually disclose right on their websites what kind of assumptions they make to come up with their best available rates. For example: On Discover's website, under MBA loans, they state that there is an assumption of two years of school remaining and a starting balance of $10,000. Some lenders also include the optional 0.25% auto-debit discount in their advertised rates. (This is more typical when you're refinancing though.)"
StudentLoans,39io6e,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:47:30 2015 UTC,"What I have found after a lot of looking is that the big name banks tend to have large ranges, and rarely give the lowest rate in the range. The big three start-up lenders (SoFi, CommonBond, and DRB) have just one rate for MBA loans, so if you qualify, you get whatever rate comes with the term.  Of these three, DRB has the lowest rates across the board. Their 10 year variable is 3.25% but they give you an additional .25% off once you graduate and have a job, so 3%."
StudentLoans,39io6e,wt2008,0,Tue Jul 14 17:21:15 2015 UTC,"When you say your credit score is 775, do you mean the one they told you they used? Or something like a credit karma? If you don't get the lowest rate, they HAVE to tell you what score they used and which bureau.  On the other hand, it could just be...the way it is. Their lowest rate could be offered to 790-800 and they're really under no obligation to make it a logical slight jump for a lower rate.  Why not try one of the non-banks? CommonBonds and SoFis of the world."
StudentLoans,39isgl,eaglessoar,6,Fri Jun 12 00:32:31 2015 UTC,"The difference is that the PLUS loans are Federal and come with the Federal protections, including income-based repayment options and public service loan forgiveness."
StudentLoans,39isgl,alh9h,4,Fri Jun 12 13:00:18 2015 UTC,"This is the biggest difference.  Also, not everyone has the income and good credit to qualify for private student loans (especially at ~5.5% interest). Grad PLUS loans are available to just about anyone as long as they're enrolled in a graduate program."
StudentLoans,39isgl,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:36:22 2015 UTC,"I think if I sign on as a co-borrower we should get a good rate, I make 75k in a steady job"
StudentLoans,39isgl,fallow8,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:18:11 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate on those protections? I am not too worried about paying the loans back, she'll have a good job out of Sloan and I am making 75k now and should get a new job which would put me closer to 90k. I plan to be paying them down with my income while she is in school (we will be married in a month)"
StudentLoans,39isgl,ANGR1ST,3,Fri Jun 12 14:19:09 2015 UTC,"The protections boil down to loan forgiveness under certain circumstances (10 years of public service) and repayment flexibility (income-based, extended, graduated). If you're talking Sloan MBA then she should be making enough that these options don't really have enough value and she should just minimize the rate as much as possible (but all just depends on how much you value being able to do something like income-based repayment)."
StudentLoans,39isgl,True_Go_Blue,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"Yea makes sense, so what should I be looking for other than the lowest rates? Obviously fixed rate is better over variable, anything else from private or student union loan providers we should look for when selecting one?"
StudentLoans,39isgl,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jun 12 17:47:08 2015 UTC,"Federal loans are discharged on the borrower's death. Private loans are not. If you've co-signed, they're still your problem so you should carry term life insurance on the borrower just in case."
StudentLoans,39isgl,True_Go_Blue,0,Fri Jun 12 19:00:49 2015 UTC,Take a look at SoFi too.
StudentLoans,39isgl,xtrexjpsouz,3,Fri Jun 12 11:57:18 2015 UTC,SoFi does not originate student loans. They only refinance them.
StudentLoans,39isgl,True_Go_Blue,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:37:17 2015 UTC,Maybe it's only grad loans that they originate.  I refinanced with them and was approved to originate a grad school loan.
StudentLoans,39isgl,True_Go_Blue,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:02:25 2015 UTC,Was it an MBA loan?
StudentLoans,39i3zk,hizzly23,5,Thu Jun 11 21:37:11 2015 UTC,Private refinances are always credit-based so your wife is not going to have much luck qualifying with bad credit. She could try applying with a creditworthy co-signer but I wouldn't count on it.
StudentLoans,39i3zk,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:51:09 2015 UTC,"Since their finances are already tightly coupled by marriage, OP could co-sign for the loan."
StudentLoans,39i3zk,ANGR1ST,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:32:50 2015 UTC,"I just refinanced my private loan at meetearnest.com, have you tried there?  And if you've tried multiple places without success it might be helpful to list them so they aren't suggested to you again."
StudentLoans,39i3zk,missintent,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:58:18 2015 UTC,"I had a private loan that reset from 9 to 11 percent. What my husband and I did was cut all discretionary spending and lived off of his salary while devoting my entire salary to pay off the loan. I did contribute the max to my 401k too. The month it was paid off, the loan was going to reset to 13%."
StudentLoans,39i3zk,lsp2005,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:26:58 2015 UTC,"This scenario is a catch-22, but it sounds like nothing can be done. Deferment & forbearance are not good, they only postpone the inevitable. This situation is pretty standard across the student loan universe, hence the reason so many people are in this mess and defaulting all over the place.  Do you own a home? It's possible to refinance and put the student loans into the house (take out equity) in order get the benefit of low homeowners rates (about 3.5% right now). This in itself is not a perfect solution, but it's worked for some."
StudentLoans,39jhgr,collegebi,2,Fri Jun 12 03:56:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, a private one will ""help"" you here."
StudentLoans,39jhgr,itsgreater9000,2,Fri Jun 12 13:09:53 2015 UTC,Some private lenders will lend you money for a previous semester. Not sure which ones specifically but it is possible.
StudentLoans,39jhgr,xtrexjpsouz,2,Fri Jun 12 13:52:32 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Sallie Mae has a loan specifically for past due balances."
StudentLoans,39jhgr,shadyg16,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course. It happens all the time. It's easy to enslave yourself so be careful. Avoid loans at all cost. Consider yourself warned."
StudentLoans,39imzg,inacognito,2,Thu Jun 11 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"Federal loans have more protections for/during repaymemt.  Income based options, deferrment, forbearance, etc.   Private loans don't.   I would also highly recommend looking into some other, non loan -based option ls if possible.  You'll appreciate it later."
StudentLoans,39imzg,Koriania,3,Fri Jun 12 01:41:07 2015 UTC,"Safety net. Federal loans come with a lot of flexible repayment options that private loans do not - things like Income Based Repayment, extended repayment, graduated repayment, hardship deferment, forbearance, etc. Private loans typically offer 12 months of forbearance and that's about it.  Potential forgiveness. Depending on the type of work you do, federal loans may also be eligible for forgiveness. The largest forgiveness program is Public Service Loan Forgiveness but there are several others at both the state and federal levels.  Credit requirements. Private loans are credit-based so not everyone qualifies. Those who do qualify may be stuck with extremely high interest rates due to ""borderline"" creditworthiness.  Co-signer requirements. Private loans almost always require a creditworthy co-signer. Federal loans do not. Your co-signer will be completely on the hook for your loans if you ever stop paying your loans for whatever reason.  Death/disability discharge. Federal loans are discharged in the event that the borrower dies or becomes permanently disabled. Private loans are less likely to be discharged as long as there is still a co-signer on the hook.  Variable vs. Fixed rates. Private loans typically come with variable rates. Federal loan interest rates are fixed for the life of the loan.  Refinancing/consolidation options. Federal loans can be refinanced into a private loan after you graduate, but not the other way around. You cannot refinance/consolidate private loans back into the federal program."
StudentLoans,39imzg,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:00:27 2015 UTC,"Can you use Grad PLUS loans instead of just Staffords? This will depend on the type of nursing program (undergrad or grad).   Remember, if you're going into nursing, you've got a good chance of working at a nonprofit organization, which would qualify you for public service loan forgiveness.... that could be a major"
StudentLoans,39gqje,student_loan_drownin,2,Thu Jun 11 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"The forgiven balance at the end of 25 years is treated as taxable income, and you'll owe a lot of money to the IRS. The downside of IBR is that you're making payments for a long time, payments that might end up being large in the future if you ever get better employment, then you're hit with a tax bill.  Why isn't she just working at this point? Two people have a hard time surviving on one income early in their lives when your salary is still low, especially when you're carrying a LOT of debt."
StudentLoans,39gqje,ANGR1ST,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:03:44 2015 UTC,"These are some great questions, and I can tell you've done your homework. You stated that roughly $70k was Federal, so I'm assuming the other $70k is Private? You definitely do have some options, both right now, and for the future with your Federal Loans. I'm here to give you as much free advice as I can. The $0/mo payment is a real thing, but there are some considerations to be made in that regard. What kind of work do you do? Are you completely out of forbearance?"

StudentLoans,39gqje,alh9h,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"A little more information would be helpful: what is the breakdown of loans by person and what is your income.  To answer your questions:  (a) income-based repayment will be calculated based on your most recent tax filing  (b) yes, you would be eligible for income-based repayment next year if you file MFS. The downside being that you will not be eligible for the student loan interest deduction or IRA deduction  (c) the only catch to IBR forgiveness is that it is a taxable event (i.e. the forgiven amount is treated as income in the year it is forgiven).  (d) 15% of discretionary income, there is a slight difference  (e) there are a number of different income-based programs: IBR, ICR, PAYE. Consolidation might also help."
StudentLoans,39gqje,10J18R1A,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:33:28 2015 UTC,"A) Not really.   B) Yes , you can file next year.  C) The forgiven portion MAY be considered as taxable income , but the fear stories about people making 30k a year being hit with some 119k tax liability is mostly laughable . 2032 would be the rebirth of debtors prisons.  D) Check with tax professionals to make sure the benefit from filling married < payment savings from filling single.  E) Budget. And possibly look at graduated repayment plans our student debt forbearance as a last resort.   This only applies to federal and doe loans."

StudentLoans,39d4kj,dforquer25,5,Wed Jun 10 23:30:06 2015 UTC,"I want to know if I can somehow get this loan balance in my name.   Parent PLUS loans generally cannot be transferred into the student's name. You might be able to roll them into a private refinance or home equity loan... but it really depends on where you're at financially. Refinances are credit-based and home equity loans (obviously) require owning a home.   I also need to know if I die, where does my balance go? Does it go away? Does the burden of my debt fall onto my parents? Or is it a void balance because there isn't anyone to pay it?   Parent PLUS loans can be discharged in the event that the student dies. They would also be discharged if the parent borrower died.   I know that they would never want me to die, but if it would mean them not being held back from living their lives, it's an easy choice.   Please do not do this. I don't know your parents, but I would think they would be much more upset about you dying than having to deal with student loan debt... especially Parent PLUS loans. Keep in mind that these are federal loans so they come with a lot of flexible options like deferment, forbearance, consolidation, Income Contingent Repayment, etc. Please take some time to look into these options and if you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to ask.

I'm a first generation student, so trying to wade my way through everything even when I was in school was really overwhelming. The school didn't really care to help when I would ask for help, they just spent time telling me how they didn't understand how I didn't know how college worked.   This is my first dealing with reddit, and I honestly didn't know who else to ask/talk to that didn't have some kind of agenda or who wasn't just going to scold me on the decisions I've made. I'm trying to find a way through all of this. So thank you again. I wasn't even sure if this was the correct subreddit to post in, but thank you for being human. It's nice to know someone isn't just going to beat me up more than I'm doing to myself."

Even if you regret the decision not to graduate, the fact that the consequences are so severe isn't your fault.  I'm in the same situation with my parents carrying a large amount of college debt - unfortunately, if the loan is in their name it can't be transferred into yours. You could pay it off through credit cards, but with a monthly payment like that it sounds like that might not be an option. It also sounds like you aren't able to cover the monthly payments on the debt?  Have you parents tried to work out lower payments with the companies holding the loans? With that sort of income $600 a month sounds really steep.   Whatever the case, have you talked with them about this? Like, I don't know how they feel, but I don't think they'd be very happy if their child felt so hopeless about a situation like this. If you're really this stressed about it maybe try talking with them."
StudentLoans,39d4kj,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not able to cover it unfortunately. I have a $340 payment of my own already that I can hardly pay as is. I work for UPS in their warehouse on a graveyard shift loading trucks, which means I'm able to make $750 per month. I'm currently trying to find another job just to make it easier to stay afloat, but currently things are stagnating in that department. My rent is $400, and with other expenses like insurance, phone bill, gas to get to work, it leaves me about $100 at the end of each month.   They are being handled by Sally Mae, which means they refuse to budge. All my parents are able to give is about $400 per month. The Parent Plus loan is brutal. It wasn't until later that we found out how steep they were going to make the payments. When we entered it, we were told to expect no more than $250 payments. They changed their mind I guess.  I haven't explored credit cards, just because it seems that will just make the hole deeper, and I don't even know if I could be approved one.  We're a super tight family, and I have talked to them, but there's no options or ways for them to help. They do feel terrible that I'm in the situation I'm in, but there isn't any wiggle room in their expenses other than being able to shuttle me 20 bucks to afford food when work is slow that month.  I was hoping I could transfer it, but I understand why I can't. Especially if I can't show any better means to pay than they can. I was just really hoping there'd be a chance :/  Thank you for taking the time to write me on here, just having someone take that little amount of time means more than I can express on these keys."
StudentLoans,39d4kj,xtrexjpsouz,3,Thu Jun 11 00:28:22 2015 UTC,"Have you looked into Income Based Repayment for your student loans? If you're really only making ~$750 per month, your minimum payments on this plan would be $0.  Edit: Also, it doesn't matter who is servicing the Parent PLUS loans. Federal loans are federal loans. Sallie Mae cannot refuse to offer your parents the federal repayment and deferment options that are available. With that in mind, your parents will need to consolidate their loans in order to use Income Contingent Repayment (ICR). Whoever you spoke to at Sallie Mae might not have mentioned this option."

I had no idea that could even be an option for them... it's hard too when my parent's don't even have internet where they because it's out of town and not available other than satellite internet which is super expensive.

This previous year they had helped me over the phone to get on the correct plan and make sure everything was squared away and taken care of.  Just to be clear, this account is just pertaining to my balance not my parents'. I'm definitely going to talk to them about asking for a defferment.

StudentLoans,39d4kj,agagwa,2,Thu Jun 11 08:47:28 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I'm wrong, but I am on IBR and it really has nothing to do with FAFSA.  I haven't filed a FAFSA or gone to their website in years.  FAFSA is what you use to qualify for the loans.  When you're repaying the loans you should work with whatever company owns the loans. There is different paperwork that you file to qualify for the different repayment plans.  You can call first and they should be able to give you a general idea of what amount you would pay on the various plans.  Then you can submit the paperwork for the option that you prefer and see if you qualify.  You do have to send in new paperwork each year with updated earnings.  I wouldn't even consider deferment.  They will likely still charge you interest, so you'll end up owing a ton more than you do now and that's not going to be helpful.  See how much you would be paying on the different repayment plans and then just start chipping away at the amount little by little.    And don't demand anything from your loan company.  That's just being immature.  You took out the loans.  You are responsible for paying them.  They have repayment plans to help you, but they don't owe you anything or have to give you preferential treatment.  Being nice and respectful will get you further."

Good news, if all your loans are Federal there are programs to help. You both need to get your loans into some form of income-based repayment, which should help immensely. In order for your parents to do this, they will need to most likely get a Direct Consolidation Loan through Federal Student Aid. Then, they can apply for one of the income-based repayment plans. Based on the income information you provided, their payment could go down to as low as ~$250/month.  You can also benefit from one of the income-based repayment plans. You should (today, if possible) go to https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action and apply for an income-based repayment plan.

Did you research? On top if you don't go to grad school directly from undergrad, what will you do in that one year, maybe two years of time while you are applying?   Choosing an appropriate major that can land you job right out of college is the best investment in time and money.

Three, you have no idea what the job market will be like when you get out of school, and your ability to pay back your loans may be hampered by this. The less you owe the better. I promise.   I was also a first gen college student and wound up with 35k when all was said and done. It's so painful to make those payments every month.

I don't see one in ITT yet to justify it.  Tacking on more debt for grad school ... not so good a decision. If you can get funding as a research or teaching assistant, go for it.

I also doubt that one more degree is going to put her in a higher pay scale than she is currently,  especially with that law degree. Perhaps she can audit classes or research personal business management studies to further her education? Either that or I suppose 80k more debt really isn't that big a deal as long as you both can guarantee your future financial success and can plan for being able to make this extra debt not a burden.

StudentLoans,39dtde,Scott_Eric,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:13:59 2015 UTC,"This is true, and I do see your point. However, this is exactly how it was before 2005. Additionally, the same legislation that exempted private student loans from bankruptcy, also made it more difficult to declare bankruptcy in general. For example, if you make more than the medium income in your state, you'd have to pass a means test to declare chapter 7 bankruptcy. I think this would make it harder for successful graduates who took out student loans (i.e. doctors), to discharge their student loans once graduating. Those graduates that were struggling would be able to get relief.   But besides this even, I think that it is a matter of weighing the two situations (bankruptcy exemption or non-bankruptcy exemption) against one another. With the bankruptcy exemption, we're seeing a lot of subprime lending, we're seeing lenders willing to lend young kids a lot of money. But we're not necessarily seeing much lower interest rates (at least not affordable ones), or payment plans to help borrowers when they are in tough times, and lenders still are requiring co-signers, which often puts parents on the hook for life as well.    Without the bankruptcy exemption, you are right, banks wouldn't lend as freely. But I think this would be a good thing. We wouldn't be getting so many young kids getting in horrible debt situations, and schools would realize that they can't continue to raise costs, as money is no longer going to be thrown at students in the form of loans (Federal loans are need based, so the caps are much lower. After the federal loans are maxed, students won't be able to take on additional debt so easily.)"
StudentLoans,39dtde,skeach101,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:00:41 2015 UTC,"I would be ok with this IF:  1.) It only discharged loans taken out AFTER this law is past. Old private loans (like yours) shouldn't count.  2.) Federal loans need to not be dischargable. The current FAFSA system works really well. Don't mess with it.  Understand what you are asking for though. By making private loans dischargeable, you are essentially asking for the TOTAL elimination of private student loans. No bank would bother to continue them if students could just discharge them away, or they will exist in very small amounts with really high interest rates"

But the bigger problem is:   Right now I cannot save any money from my paycheck, all the money goes to bills   This is a big red flag that you're spending too much somewhere. You should work up a detailed budget and find something to trim.  Nuking loans 1 and 3 will free up an additional $150/mo that you could ""save"" or use to pay down your debt.

StudentLoans,39c5d7,ANGR1ST,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:56:50 2015 UTC,I've been applying for financial aid for 3 years now and not received any so I'm not exactly holding out hope on this one. Does a loan from the government always have the same interest rate? Or does it vary from person to person.
StudentLoans,39c5d7,xtrexjpsouz,2,Thu Jun 11 13:13:06 2015 UTC,Fixed and the same for everyone based on what type of loan it is:  https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/interest-rates
StudentLoans,39bd3l,Ashipsailed,2,Wed Jun 10 16:40:53 2015 UTC,"Discover offers them. Don't think you're likely to have much better luck than you had with Sallie Mae, but it's worth a short.  You can ask the school about a payment plan. Some will spread your bill out over the whole semester. That'll give you time to work (while in school) and maybe earn enough to take up some of the difference. $6k over a year isn't too bad at all. Over a semester is workable but getting more difficult."
StudentLoans,39bd3l,ANGR1ST,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply! So if my parents get denied (which they will) I will be able to get more Stafford loans? I have already received $9,500.00 for the year through Staffords subsidized and unsubsidized and was told that is the maximum.  Edit: apologies, my replies went to the wrong comments"
StudentLoans,39bd3l,ANGR1ST,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:21:08 2015 UTC,You could have them apply for a Parent PLUS loan. That's entirely in their name though. It's federal but has a light credit check. If for some reason they're denied that you can get a little more in unsubsidized loans for yourself.
StudentLoans,39bd3l,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:41:00 2015 UTC,I was just informed that I cannot get a parent plus unless I am a dependent student which I am not because I am 25. But thank you so much regardless!
StudentLoans,39bd3l,Koriania,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:34:24 2015 UTC,"There are other private lenders but if you and your co-signer are not creditworthy, that's going to be a problem regardless of where you apply.  Have you considered Parent PLUS loans as an alternative to private loans? These are federal loans made in a parent's name. Even if the parent has terrible credit and/or doesn't really want to take them out, it's still a good idea to apply. Having a parent apply for a Parent PLUS loan and get denied will make you eligible for additional unsubsidized Stafford loans."
StudentLoans,39bd3l,Koriania,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:28:16 2015 UTC,"Can you look into a payment plan with the school, and pick up some part time work? This would be way better, long term."
StudentLoans,39ay1q,machiuu,7,Wed Jun 10 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"You can't. School won't charge you anything they wouldn't if you were paying them cash. They'll apply the loans to the current balance on your account, then refund you whatever's left over."
StudentLoans,39ay1q,ANGR1ST,2,Wed Jun 10 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"This is right. The only thing I want to add is the free OP might be worried about isn't applied by the school. That's the cost of the financing the loan, if you will. It's built into the loan and you can see what it is on the federal student loan website."
StudentLoans,39ay1q,ERIFNOMI,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:06:44 2015 UTC,No. The reason student loans are always disbursed to your school first is so they can keep track of how much you're borrowing from all sources (federal and private loans) and ensure you don't borrow beyond the school's estimated cost of attendance.

StudentLoans,398wbf,aestes89,3,Wed Jun 10 02:36:01 2015 UTC,"First, federal law is clear on the issue of prepayment penalty. They cannot penalize you for paying it off. Choosing a repayment plan is not like being locked into a mortgage. You will be able to leave the 10 year plan for the 30 year etc. (There are issues with starting out on an IBR type program but it sounds like you're not considering those options- good for you.)  Second, yes- you can take the ""lowest"" monthly payment plan and always pay more- which will allow you leeway if a month gets tight. However, this approach makes it very very easy to develop a bad habit of only paying the minimum each month. The loan servicer is hoping you always pay the mim as they will make more money on you over the life of your loan. Also, if you are having difficulty one month the loan servicer will allow you to pay less than the required amount if you just tell them about the problem. The issues arise when you don't pick up a phone to tell them why you can't pay in full.   Now, I don't know your financial situation intimately, but, with $50k for a starting salary I would highly encourage you to start out on the 10 year standardized repayment plan. I know you plan to live in an expensive area but your income will (likely) only increase over the next few years. ~$500 might feel like a HUGE amount today but I promise it will get easier. Also, you'll get the monkey off your back sooner and save money in the process.   Most importantly, make a budget and stick with it! It's acceptable to be ""poor"" when you first get out of school. Live within your means and you'll be great. Go to r/personalfinance and tell them your plans and share your proposed monthly budget. The redditors in that sub have the soundest financial advice available on the Internet. Read the FAQ about student loans. This sub seems to be used more frequently to discuss general student loan issues- like what the govt will do with federal loans in the future, interest rates, etc.  What you are looking for is a financial critique and advice.   Good luck friend! I'm in six digit debt (law degree) and I'm living lean to work myself out of it! You'll feel better when you start to see progress."
StudentLoans,398wbf,Oklahoma_is_OK,2,Wed Jun 10 04:57:43 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I needed to know! I'm thinking about just knocking out my credit card debt over the next 6 months, and then putting that money + a little more towards the standardized plan. I just wanted to know what my options were, and it feels good to know that although 50k is a LOT of student debt (to me at least), it's not going to be THAT bad to pay off. I actually have a proposed monthly budget that I posted to r/personalfinance pretty recently, and most people seemed to think it was ok. (http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/353mr3/would_anyone_give_a_newb_a_budget_lookover/).   Anyways, thanks so much for the advice and peace of mind. Really appreciate it! Good luck with your career in law, and the student loans of your own! :)"
StudentLoans,398wbf,xtrexjpsouz,3,Wed Jun 10 12:10:57 2015 UTC,"Like /u/Oklahoma_is_Ok said, there are no prepayment penalties on student loans. There is nothing wrong with switching to a cheaper plan and paying extra every month. It can actually work to your advantage since you can apply the extra payments to the loan with the highest interest rate (avalanche method).  The more important question is, do you have the discipline to stick with your plan of paying extra every month?"
StudentLoans,398wbf,v-dub07,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:54:01 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. I think I have the discipline to pay the extra each month. I just want to start off with a smaller minimum while I get on my feet, you know? Even if I buy used, when you factor a bed, microwave, desk, couch, and all the little stuff in, I'll likely be spending a good portion of my paychecks on that at least for about 3 months I'd think, so it'd be great to have a smaller minimum loan payment. Then, after all that's settled and I'm not sleeping on an air mattress, it sounds like I can switch from the 30 year plan back to the 10 year plan to force myself to make the bigger, uglier payments and get it overwith. As a college graduate, I'm now seeing the nasty side to living in a furnished apartment for 4 years. When you move out, you have NOTHING."
StudentLoans,398wbf,ANGR1ST,2,Wed Jun 10 15:13:42 2015 UTC,"is your job govt or non profit? you can always do IBR (maintain lowest payments), but have the loan forgiven after 10 years since it is a public service oriented job"
StudentLoans,3979s4,Pineapple_Tommy,7,Tue Jun 9 19:38:33 2015 UTC,"Your student aid should cover anything that is billed through the school - including housing, assuming you're staying on campus. That is, unless your award amount is not enough to cover the entirety of your bill. In this case, you're going to want to look into getting help from family, friends, or worse case scenario a private loan.  I know how frustrating it can be dealing with financial aid departments at schools who are unclear and expect you to already understand everything."

My mom is applying for the parent plus thing but her credit isn't great so I doubt I'll get it. There is no one I can borrow 3 grand from. Then next semester it should be the same amount right? So a total of 6 thousand per year. In the financial aid it said that some of it was loans? Who are those from and when are they due? Sorry for all the questions. I am really overwhelmed
StudentLoans,3979s4,SyntheticMemories,3,Tue Jun 9 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"If your mom doesn't get the Parent PLUS loan, the school will be able to offer YOU more money in the form of an un-sub loan."

StudentLoans,3979s4,chauncy_billups,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:35:04 2015 UTC,"If you didn't apply for additional private loans, the loans through financial aid will be government subsidized/unsubsidized loans that will not be due until 6 months after you graduate, which is when payments will start. It looks like you'll have to find a lender for a private loan to cover the additional costs."
StudentLoans,3979s4,chauncy_billups,0,Tue Jun 9 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"The three thousand most likely is meant over the course of both semesters. So really you're paying 1500 per semester. The Parent Plus loan is a good option to cover the rest, and even if you're denied that you're given four thousand (I believe) added on to your Stafford (I believe) for the whole school year, so you'll end up having a bit extra which will be paid to you by the school via check or deposit.

You may not be able to do both if the business is expensive."
StudentLoans,397z0x,ANGR1ST,3,Tue Jun 9 22:32:52 2015 UTC,"I've got six months to pay off the amount. I have a 9 to 5 job making 40, 000 but after deductions I only have just under $1000 a paycheque.   Not sure where you live, but taking home less than $1,000 per paycheck (even on a biweekly schedule) seems very low for someone earning $40K gross. Are you having anything other than taxes taken out? Health insurance? 401k contributions?   I'm currently building a business on the side that isn't profitable yet which eats up quite a bit of my income.   This is a problem. If you're really serious about getting out of debt, you should probably put the side business on hold.   How do I live, build my business and get out of debt in six months?   On your current income? It's not possible. Assuming you have 13 paychecks left between now and the end of the year (which you probably don't), you would take home about $13,000... which is barely enough to pay off the debt even without any living expenses or losses from your side business.  Edit: The only way you're going to meet your goal is if you significantly increase your income. This will most likely require dropping the side business so you have time to pick up a part-time job. Any part-time job (even at minimum wage) would be more lucrative than your side business in its current state."

I expect that there will be an expectation that the borrower will need to show how they were mislead by the school or how the school committed fraud in relation to the students education.    Also you don't say whether you had federal student loans. If you don't - don't bother as this process would only be for potential discharge of those loans.  If you don't, and you feel like you were defrauded by the school, consider instead filing a complaint with the state's attorney general's office or filing a civil suit yourself.  If you do have federal loans, at best I would think you'd be requesting discharge for the loans you needed to complete the two extra terms you say you had to utilize after they made this schedule change.  What concerns me about your post is that you say that this class offering change is ""one of the reasons you had to extend my stay"" - which tells me that it may be difficult to prove that there was any misrepresentation by the school that directly caused these extra expenses."

Otherwise, there would be nothing stopping you from transferring the entire balance to a credit card.  Personally, I don't think it's worth the effort.

StudentLoans,397eet,aaronsweber,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:46:41 2015 UTC,"Well, you can consolidate your federal loans into one big federal loan. But generally all your federal loans will all be managed by a single billing company (servicer) who can send you one bill that's paid with one check, so there's no real need to do it unless you're in one of the weird situations where you have two different federal servicers. (Federal loan consolidation used to be more popular when the feds made variable-rate loans, and you could consolidate to lock in a rate. Also before income-based repayment was allowed, consolidation was one of the only ways to reduce monthly payments and stretch out the repayment time. But now there are better ways to get the same results).   You can't consolidate private loans into the federal loan system.  If you want to combine your private and federal loans, then you're looking at taking your federal loans out of the federal system and turning them into private loans. That CAN be done, but it has more risks (fewer forgiveness options or other payment options if you run into trouble...) and isn't usually a great idea for most people."

A few cents a month.  It does restart the clock on the Income-Based and Public Service forgiveness programs, too. But unless you're planning on using those, it's not a bad idea.

Federal consolidation does not lower your interest rate. All they do is average your current rates together and round up to the nearest 1/8th of a percent. So if all of your existing student loans all had interest rates of 5% (which I'm guessing they don't), the consolidated rate would also be 5%.   I am given 0% interest for the first three years   Only the subsidized loans would be interest-free for the first three years... and only if your income is low enough to continue having a $0 payment for that entire time. Otherwise, the government will only pay the portion that your monthly minimums don't cover.   no minimum monthly payment first the first full year.   This is probably correct... but it depends on your income. If your income is low enough and you switch to IBR after consolidating, you can have a monthly payment as low as $0.   And my debts are forgiven after 10 years of payments.   This only applies if you stay in public service for the full ten years.

No other loan companies will take credit cards. No loan companies in general will take wire transfers.  Online checking/savings accounts all need proof of address.  You will need to borrow someone's American address or take up MSing. Find a reloadable prepaid card with Bill Pay, get a credit card in your country, buy gift cards with the credit card and use the gift card with your prepaid card and bill pay to your student loan companies."
StudentLoans,3948hx,QuantumCatBox,2,Tue Jun 9 03:38:38 2015 UTC,"The origination fee is to pay for the cost of originating the loan.  It's mandated in the higher education act.  When two federal loan programs existed - the lender financed FFEL program and the still existing Direct Loan program, the origination fees used to be the same at 3% - then they dropped the DL fee to 1%.  Then sequestration mandated the weird little increase we see every year."
StudentLoans,3948hx,Betsy514,2,Tue Jun 9 13:33:07 2015 UTC,"I looked up the statutory language regarding the fee and am familiar with its origin. I guess my question was more abstract in asking why the dept. of education needs to charge a fee to originate a loan, and why this fee would be proportional to the amount of the loan. The underlying assumption here is that the government is not a private company, and that it does not seek to generate a profit.  So, if profit isn't a purpose of government, and an origination fee is arguably just to pay for processing the loan, then why does a $10,000 loan cost more to process then a $1,000 loan? The $10k loan has an origination fee of $173 (1.073%) and the $1k loan has an origination fee of $17.30. Can it really be said that the $10k loan cost the originator $150+ more than the $1k loan to process? Again, I don't doubt the reasoning for the fee in the private sector, which I believe partly pays the commission of the loan underwriter. But, student loans originate from the Department of Education under the Direct Student Loan program.   So, what's the underlying reasoning for the fee?"
StudentLoans,3948hx,Betsy514,2,Tue Jun 9 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"The same question could be asked about collection costs - which vary between 16% and 24% of a defaulted loan depending on how it's collected.    My theory is that it's a fairness thing - bigger balances should pay a larger portion of the costs associated with these activities then smaller balances do.  As to why have one - well at this point it's a budget thing.  You get rid of the O fee and suddenly you have to find $X billion in Pell Grant money.  Speaking of Pell Grant money - and this isn't personal - I cringe so hard when I hear the whole profit on federal loans thing.  It's not a profit as in Secretary Duncan's gettin' himself a gold Apple watch and hangs with the rich kids of instragram crowd - the ""profit"" is used to offset ""costers"" in the budget such as Pell and income based repayment and interest subsidies."

StudentLoans,393ram,desertwild12,6,Tue Jun 9 01:23:27 2015 UTC,"We're enrolled in the IBR/IDR plan and our payments are exactly 10% of our gross monthly income, which we simply can't afford.   IBR payments aren't calculated based on a percentage of gross income. They're calculated based on a percentage of discretionary income (gross income minus 150% of the federal poverty limit). Assuming you are on IBR, not PAYE, your monthly minimums should be 15% of discretionary income.   I am here to ask if there's any public programs or ANYTHING out there that can get FedLoan payments lower than 10% of our monthly income.   Assuming you're not on it already, you might be able to switch to PAYE. As of right now, PAYE is only for ""new borrowers"" (as of October 2007) but it is supposed to be expanded to all federal borrowers at some point in the next year. So if you're not already eligible, keep an eye out for that change.  Otherwise, the only other thing you can do is stop filing your taxes jointly. Be warned, though: Filing separately almost always costs you more in income taxes - especially if you have kids.   We're trying to save up for a down payment on a house and be contributing members of society but with a loan payment equaling as much as a mortgage I can't see through this.   Saving for a down payment/buying a house is not a necessity. Paying down your student loans should take priority over buying a house. Furthermore, if you can't afford to dedicate at least 10% of your income to student loans, your budget probably needs some work. Try posting a breakdown of your income and expenses in /r/personalfinance and see what they have to say."

My boyfriend and I live in a big metro area and lease an apartment. Last year, when our lease was coming to its end, we were looking for new apartments and rental properties (houses, duplexes) to lower our monthly hosting cost. We looked at hundreds of places, all within a 35 mile radius from our workplaces and decided to stay put. We found nothing that was cheaper, in safe neighborhoods, to rent or lease. Going out any further was not an option due to huge commute times and all the expenses that accompany it. With our good credit though, we would be able to save $500 to $700 monthly by purchasing a modest home. This savings even takes into account taxes, insurance and saving money each month to earmark for home maintenance.   I understand that not everyone is looking at the same market we are, but for us, purchasing a home, which is our plan later this year, will save us money."

StudentLoans,393ram,iamajs,2,Tue Jun 9 16:59:59 2015 UTC,"So - you both have loans and you both applied for IBR/PAYE.

On Yelp, you can filter by price and you can manually filter by quality. You can also do that with colleges. Sometimes quality and prices are misaligned and sometimes they aren't...it mostly depends on what dish you choose to order (aka what major you choose). You can have an ""in demand major"" like engineering at a state school and get paid way more than you owe. Or you can choose to major in art history (not really in demand) at USC and have a crappy debt-to-income ratio. This, in my opinion, is the equivalent of ordering expensive chewy snails at the Ritz Carlton instead of getting a tasty, cheap In-N-Out burger.

No.  Consolidating removes the ability to pay off the highest interest loans first with your extra payments.  You could consider consolidating/refinancing the Private loans. But I doubt you're going to get a much better rate without a better job and/r a co-signer. Look into it now, but expect that you'll need to re-visit it in 5 years."
StudentLoans,394laj,ANGR1ST,2,Tue Jun 9 05:46:16 2015 UTC,"Federal consolidation will not save you any money. All they do is average your existing interest rates and round up. Consolidation also typically extends repayment and prevents you from using the avalanche method.  Private consolidation can save you money on interest, but with only ~$20K in annual income there's no way in hell you're going to qualify. Debt-to-income ratio aside, you don't even meet the minimum income requirements for most lenders (at least $2,000 per month).  At this point, you really need to get on an income-driven repayment plan (IBR or PAYE) for the federal loans. You don't need to consolidate to do this, although it might make things a little easier given that you have three different federal servicers. Regardless, the goal is to get your federal loan payments down so you can afford to put more towards the high-interest private loans.  I would also strongly recommend putting all of your minimum loan payments on auto-debit. This will lower all of your interest rates by 0.25% and reduce the risk of accidentally missing a payment."

Solution:   Find a job Save money, buy a cheap car Use car to commute to local community college starting Spring 2016 Do two years of CC then transfer to state school It looks like CT has a program just for this: http://www.ct.edu/initiatives/tap   2) Max your Federal loans and get the rest from Parent Plus loans  Your mom will need to apply for Parent Plus loans, as other people have said. Work with your school's financial aid office: they have been through this many times before and will help you get what you need. Stay as far away from private loans as possible. You probably won't be able to your first semester, but starting your second semester, apply for on campus work-study jobs. They don't pay very well, but they usually come with tuition waivers. I worked in the library shelving books and processing loans: it was easy, flexible (they will let you schedule around your class schedule) and quiet (I often had a chance to do hw or reading) and I got three free credits every semester. Worst case, based on a guess of your mom's income at $40k, I get a cost of attendance for CCSU of $21,850 annually, with approximately $5800 in grants, leaves $16,000 to cover, less your annual Federal max of $5500, leaves a bill of $10,500, so I think my estimate is pretty close. As such, and discounting any other aid (n.b. apply for all the scholarships you can find), you will end up with a debt total of $22,000 and your mom $42,000. Assuming you get your loans on an income-based repayment, that will be payments of $200/month, based on her estimated income above."

StudentLoans,393m3t,Betsy514,2,Tue Jun 9 00:50:12 2015 UTC,"Based on your income and total debt, it sounds like Income Based Repayment (or Pay As You Earn) would be a good option for you. Note that there are no prepayment penalties on student loans, so you are free to pay extra whenever you want."

StudentLoans,393m3t,SyntheticMemories,2,Tue Jun 9 12:01:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you will owe taxes on the amount that is forgiven."
StudentLoans,393m3t,persondude27,2,Tue Jun 9 14:33:50 2015 UTC,"You and I have almost exactly the same situation - I'm 27. I have about $55,000 in debt, make about $34,000 a year, and bills come out to about $800 / mo + student loans (one $100, one $101.23 with IBR).  I think the answer is pretty dependent on you and your personal goals. The Student Loans.gov Calculator lays it out quite clearly what the difference is. For me on IBR, I think I end up paying about $10,000 more in interest but then have about $25,000 forgiven. As mentioned below, I expect to pay tax on that, since it's treated as income. In this case, it would be $5,000 tax due. So ultimate cost is a bit less than $15,000 extra, but over the course of fifteen years. However, that is a difference of about $280 a month right now in my student loan payment, which is about $36,000 over the next ten years.  Truly, I'm on the fence on whether I want that hanging over my head for 25 years or not. I've got about one year done, but twenty-five years in a long time. I'm working as hard as I can on chasing the dream, but I think I will try to end up throwing money at the ten-year option before long.  I believe that with my ICR setup, The Gooberment pays the interest on subsized loans for three years. After that, interest will accrue but not capitalize.  Right now, ICR/PAYE is the best option for me, though I hope to eventually switch to taking on the ten-year-option. I think I need to either make more money or change my lifestyle significantly for that to be an option, though (bicycle racing is an expensive hobby).  Also, another thing worth mentioning is that the debt / income burden I have hurts my credit. The interest on the student loans is revolving debt, so credit card companies won't take me and I'll have trouble getting a loan."

DO NOT go to a private school unless your family will be helping you with expenses.  Most of my students are graduating with 200-250k of student loans at almost 7% interest rate.  It is doable, but I don't suggest it.  If you are able to get in the 150k range, then it is plausible.  I won't go into the numbers since yours is pretty accurate.  Many advisers will tell you optometrist can make 130+ starting out, but they are just out of touch with the real world.  If you decide to go to this route, I would recommend that you find an in state school with low tuition.  They typically average around 22-25k/yr.  Your next goal is to try to get in state tuition before optometry school.  Some schools are more difficult than others to get in state, such as OSU.  One thing that these schools are notorious for leaving out is that there will be around 3 years of summer classes, which adds on another 10-15k a year in tuition.    I graduated with around 197k of student loans and on the road to pay it off in 3-3.5 years.  I've been working 6-7 days a week, 10-12 hours a day.

Given that you only owe $28K, I can't imagine you would benefit much from this.

I would look into that.

Also settlements usually mean the borrower can pay the entire amount upfront - that seems like a non-starter here.  Your best bet is to get the federal loan payment down as low as possible and try to consolidate the private loans to extend the term and lower the payment.  You may need a co-signer to do this.  If that doesn't work, you have to find an additional income source for a time."

This is crippling, especially when you owe tens of thousands. Bringing all the loans under one roof and giving them a reasonable interest rate helps a lot.  One thing you'll probably have to do if you consolidate is add a co-signer to the loan. That co-signer doesn't have to pay anything, you can continue making payments each month. That said, the co-signer will be linked to your debts, which will affect their credit situation, so make sure they're aware of what being a co-signer means."

After pursuing not one, not two, but three degrees from an Ivy League university, he chose to default on his student loans at taxpayer expense, because he felt that paying them back would have hampered his ambitions of becoming a writer. “As difficult as it has been, I’ve never looked back,” he wrote this weekend in a New York Times opinion piece. “The millions of young people today, who collectively owe over $1 trillion in loans, may want to consider my example.”  Jordan Weissmann JORDAN WEISSMANN Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.  For the love of God, no they should not. The Times, on the other hand, should consider apologizing for publishing this deeply irresponsible op-ed.  I can sort of imagine why the opinion section’s editors might have found Siegel’s article topical. In recent months, almost 200 former Corinthian Colleges students have made news by launching a debt strike, refusing to pay back loans they accumulated while attending the now-defunct for-profit education chain. With support from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats, the strikers have asked the Department of Education to forgive their debts, which it has the power to do in cases where a school essentially defrauds its students. According to multiple lawsuits, Corinthian appears to have done exactly that by lying about its job placement and graduation stats.  Siegel, however, was not the unwitting victim of a predatory for-profit college. He was just a feckless liberal arts major. As the man tells it, he grew up in a “lower-middle-class family” and borrowed heavily for school after his parents split following his father’s bankruptcy. At first, he tried to do the financially responsible thing by transferring from his small, private college to a state school near home in New Jersey. However, Siegel felt he “deserved better,” and left. Though his piece never mentions his alma mater by name, his official speaker’s bio states that he eventually went on to earn a B.A., M.A., and masters of philosophy from Columbia University. All of this was FINANCED in part with the help of scholarship money, but also seemingly with a mountain of student loans. Later, Siegel concluded that he wouldn’t be able to pay off his obligations if he wanted to keep working as a writer. So he chose to shirk them instead. Thirty years after taking out his last loan, he notes, “the Department of Education is still pursuing the unpaid balance.”  And how does he justify pickpocketing the government?  “It struck me as absurd that one could amass crippling debt as a result, not of drug addiction or reckless borrowing and spending, but of going to college,” Siegel writes. “Having opened a new life to me beyond my modest origins, the education system was now going to call in its chits and prevent me from pursuing that new life, simply because I had the misfortune of coming from modest origins.”  As we all know, “going to college” is common shorthand for “going to grad school.” Potato. Potahto.*  It’s that sort of half-baked self-righteousness that makes Siegel’s article so galling. It is, in fact, possible to be a culture writer with merely one Ivy League diploma on your wall. There are, believe it or not, successful journalists who have managed to pay off gargantuan student loan bills rather than leave the government holding the bag. Contra Siegel’s assertion that “moneyed stumbles” like tax fraud and insider TRADING “never seem to have much consequences” compared to student loan defaults, the federal government actually spends a great deal of time prosecuting precisely those crimes. And while it’s true that our student lending system is irrationally punitive, the people who really suffer tend to look like Corinthian’s hapless alums, not a white, male literary gadfly who decided he needed a second master’s before going on to write for the New Yorker, the Times, Harper's, and (yes) Slate while settling down to write books in a nice suburb of New Jersey.  But tone-deafness is the least of Siegel’s sins, in this case. The much bigger problem, and the reason the Times owes the world a mea culpa in my opinion, is that he spends about a third of the column dispatching criminally negligent financial advice.  Siegel simply seems to think the world would be better off if more students followed his lead and chose to default. (At one point, he suggests with a straight face that the chaos that would ensue if everybody stopped paying their loans might force Congress to consider a “universal education tax that would make higher education affordable.”) Much of his piece is basically a guide to life after defaulting, which he argues is less awful than many would have you think. Sample wisdom: “The reported consequences of having no credit are scare talk, to some extent. The reliably predatory nature of American life guarantees that there will always be somebody to help you.”  Astoundingly, Siegel never mentions, nor demonstrates that he understands, the fact that in most cases of default the government can simply start garnishing up to 15 percent of borrowers’ disposable wages directly from their paychecks. That’s more than the 10 percent they would owe if they simply signed up for the newest income-based repayment plan that the Department of Education offers. In other words, unless you’re making a political statement like the debt strikers, there is virtually no rational reason to default. And telling anybody that they should consider doing so is gross journalistic malpractice, even in an opinion piece. If anybody actually takes Siegel’s advice for a road test, the Times will have succeeded at making the world a slightly crappier place, and nothing more.  I’m not sure why Siegel doesn’t seem to recognize these issues—the word “garnish” appears nowhere in his piece—but I assume it may be because, since he’s a FREELANCE WRITER, the government may have a harder time tracking down his employers and taking his pay. If so, lucky him. He found a loophole.  Anyway, according to the Times, Siegel is “writing a memoir ABOUT MONEY.” Presumably, it will include an even lengthier rationalization of why he’s entitled to yours.  Correction, June 8, 2015: I originally joked in this post that “going to college” was a well known shorthand for “acquiring a pair of master’s degrees from one of the world’s most expensive universities.” After publication, Siegel told Yahoo! News, “I had my full tuition paid all my years at Columbia,” and implied that he was borrowing for living expenses. “If I had worked full-time, I never would have finished,"" he said. So, while it seems accurate to say that he took out loans in order to attend grad school, it's not fair to suggest that he paid out for one of the world’s most expensive universities. The article has been revised elsewhere to reflect that he received scholarship money."

If not for loans, I'd either be an assistant manager at a grocery store, or working in the military to earn a GI bill education.  Student loans are an incredible OPPORTUNITY.  If you squander that by majoring in jerk-off-ology, that's not a banker's fault and he/she shouldn't have to suffer the consequences for you.  I think prices are crazy high just like you do, but it's because of demand and risk, not greed.

Especially people like the author of OPs article who simply doesn't want to work a paying job because ""it isn't fulfilling.""

As for majoring in jerk-off-ology, don't you think it qualifies as subprime lending when banks are equally willing to give $200k to an art major and a future doctor? You might be surprised that anyone is willing to lend students money, but its the least surprising thing about this to me. It works out massively in the banks favor - they loan large amounts of money to a very young, uninformed population that will never be able to discharge them in bankruptcy. They get all that sweet interest if the kid does pay them back, and they get to garnish their wages for a lifetime if the kid isn't able to pay them back. Its win/win for the lenders. Its predatory lending, just like the credit card companies that set up kiosks at colleges. They know the odds are good that these kids don't have the life experience to truly understand finance and debt.  Also, rising college costs have nothing to do with demand and risk. That would make sense if we were talking about rising interest rates on student loans, but the cost of a four year degree has risen disproportionately high when compared to inflation. This isn't risk avoidance on the university's part - this is because there are so many lenders willing to lend huge amounts of money to basically anyone, regardless of the likelihood of their ability to pay it back. They raise the costs higher and higher because students are continually able to get loans for more and more money. This benefits both the universities and lenders, while utterly fucking over the honest kids just trying to get an education.  As for your personal experience, I'm glad it worked out for you, but I would venture a guess that most 14 year olds don't have the foresight to slave away and save for college while they attend high school. Honestly, I think its sad that we all complacently accept that they should have to. Perhaps your parents or teachers were able to spend the time mentoring you about finance, but a lot of low-income or impoverished kids have parents that frankly are not very financially literate and wouldn't be able to sift through the changing nuances of interest and repayment to properly asses the cost-benefit analysis of taking out student loans on an individual basis. That's what this sub should be for, actually, although it has more or less devolved into shaming people about bad decisions they made with good intentions (decisions they can now do nothing to change.)   Obviously the aim of taking out a student loan should be to pay it back eventually, but some people are in truly desperate situations and have no recourse but to pay and live a life of impoverished servitude or to default and live a life of slightly less impoverished servitude.

In a Sunday New York Times op-ed, he said they were holding him back from pursuing his dreams. And he argued that recent graduates should make the same decision:  I could take what I had been led to believe was both the morally and legally reprehensible step of defaulting on my student loans, which was the only way I could survive without wasting my life in a job that had nothing to do with my particular usefulness to society.  I chose life. That is to say, I defaulted on my student loans.  As difficult as it has been, I’ve never looked back  For most people, Siegel's recommendations are dangerous. They gloss over the serious, lifelong consequences for defaulting on student debt. And they make one of the worst cases for student loan forgiveness imaginable.  Student loans can haunt you forever  Student loans, unlike most other forms of consumer debt, can't be discharged in bankruptcy. Once you take them out, you're stuck with them for life.  That's why the federal government can pursue you, literally, to the grave to get its money back: because it's almost impossible to get rid of the debt.  Siegel implies that life with defaulted loans is okay, as long as you find someone with good credit who's willing to marry you:  Get as many credit cards as you can before your credit is ruined. Find a stable housing situation. Pay your rent on time so that you have a good record in that area when you do have to move. Live with or marry someone with good credit (preferably someone who shares your desperate nihilism).  When the fateful day comes, and your credit looks like a war zone, don’t be afraid. The reported consequences of having no credit are scare talk, to some extent. The reliably predatory nature of American life guarantees that there will always be somebody to help you, from credit card companies charging stratospheric interest rates to subprime loans for houses and cars.  Defaulting on a student loan isn't a mild form of political protest with limited consequences. The federal government can make your life pretty miserable.  The federal government can take up to 15 percent of your wages to get its student loan money back, and it doesn't need a court order to do so. The number of people having their wages garnished increased 45 percent from 2003 to 2013, according to the Wall Street Journal. Nearly 175,000 people had a total of $303 million withheld from their paychecks to pay back defaulted student loans in the 2013 fiscal year.  The government can also withhold your tax refund and even your Social Security payment. And it uses that power, too: 33,000 people had their Social Security payments garnished last year to pay back their debt, according to the Government Accountability Office. These are people, well into retirement, still paying for the fact they never paid off their loans.  So it's possible that Siegel's long-overdue loan payments might yet catch up with him.  Stories like Siegel's are why it's hard to discharge loans in bankruptcy  Students with federal loans have more OPTIONS NOW than they did when Siegel graduated. If you want to or have to take a low-paying job, for example, you can enroll in a plan that bases your monthly payment on your discretionary income, with the remaining loan balance forgiven after enough time has passed.  But loans from banks, which make up about 10 percent of the student loan market, don't have that flexibility. And once you have one, it's nearly impossible to get rid of it the way you would discharge other debt: by filing for bankruptcy."

Judge Judy always using the analogy, ""You ate the steak, you have to pay for it!""  There are schools that offer need-based aid to students, so this guy did something irresponsible, didn't research and now other students who borrow will pay a higher interest rate due to this jerk.

StudentLoans,38wg0o,omgitsfletch,3,Tue Jun 9 09:54:21 2015 UTC,"Bingo. And some universities have a higher value than others, and some have a higher cost than others (these two things are not necessarily positively correlated). If you have $5 in your pocket, chances are you probably need to eat at McDonald's, not Ruth's Chris.  If you are choosing a major with little practical chance for income post-education (i.e. writing), and don't have assets to contribute towards the cost of your education and loans...a $40k/yr private school is NOT the right decision. If you choose to take loans to allow you to go to that school anyway, against all practical financial advice, you should expect to be on the hook for your fiduciary obligations. A college education is NOT a privilege, and picking the school and major of your choice with no consequence most certainly should not be a privilege."

Lots of folks in /r/studentloans are apparently sensitive about bad past decisions.  But hey, I graduated with $106K in debt on a moderately useful degree and had to start working at a warehouse 70hrs/wk unloading semi trucks so I could at least make my minimum payments and rent a room from a couple friends in their house. Only difference between me and a lot of folks is that I'm willing to take responsibility and pay off what I borrowed."
StudentLoans,38wg0o,ThemApples007,2,Sun Jun 7 18:01:50 2015 UTC,"It's entitlement generation, plain and simple. Luckily I just barely aged out of the beginning of it.  Everyone should be entitled to a free or affordable post-secondary education, at the university or college of their choosing, in the major of their choosing, and be guaranteed a reasonable wage after graduation.  Why? Apparently because their parents and grandparents had this luxury and didn't even need the college education for it, or something. Some jobs pay well, some jobs pay like shit. Don't take a job that pays like shit and then complain when you get paid like shit. Nobody made you do that.  You aren't a precious snowflake that DESERVES a $200k education in Native American studies free and clear because you just love the way Harvard's campus looks in the fall. Choices have rewards, and they have consequences. People succeed, but they also fail. It's almost an interesting parallel of the Freemen-on-the-land movement you see in the legal field (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemen_on_the_land). They want the advantages of the modern, 1st world, legal system when it suits them and benefits them. But they claim to be outside its jurisdiction when it doesn't suit their interests.  The current generation wants to bask in the afterglow and benefits of a 1st world, democratic, capitalistic society whenever it provides them some tangible benefits. But whenever that same society sends them the bill, suddenly they want to be free of its obligations. Can't have it both ways.  Downvote away, you whiny cunts."

StudentLoans,38x4mt,AthenaPA,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"I was told by my financial aid office that my PAYE payments will be based only on my tax returns, allowing me $0 payments until the end of 2016 (because of $0 income in 2014). But I see a lot of talk on here about submitting paystubs instead of using tax returns. How do I know which to use? And when would I submit a paystub? Are these questions for my loan servicer?   When you apply for PAYE, there is a question on the application that asks if your income has changed significantly since your last tax return was filed. Given that your salary is going from $0 to $77,000 per year, I'd say the answer to that question is pretty clearly ""yes."" At that point, they will prompt you to submit alternative documentation of income (i.e. pay stubs) to verify your actual income.   My second question is about PSLF. When exactly do I need to submit the employment certification form?   Technically, you don't have to submit anything until you are ready to receive forgiveness (after 120 payments)... and you only need to submit one form per qualifying employer. However, a lot of borrowers feel more comfortable submitting the forms on an annual basis so they can track their progress and document their intent to apply for PSLF."
StudentLoans,38x4mt,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"Since I was told to apply after graduation, the answer to whether my income had changed significantly was still ""no"". I know how much I will be making, but right now I'm still unemployed."

StudentLoans,38x4mt,jayfleischman,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"Submit for PAYE immediately rather than waiting (you can opt out of the grace period). This way you'll have $0 payments starting now instead of in November, which means you'll get a few more months of PAYE towards your 20 year discharge.  You submit your employment certification at the end of the 120 months of payments. Keep records of your employment, pay stubs, and student loan bills and payments for the full period of time. I know it's a lot, but the benefit is worth it."
StudentLoans,38x4mt,jayfleischman,2,Sun Jun 7 17:56:19 2015 UTC,"I thought I read specifically that any payments (even $0) made during the grace period would not count?  Actually, I found the specific question on the PSLF common questions:  ""Q18 May I waive the six-month repayment grace period on my Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans and begin making qualifying PSLF payments early?  A18 No. Under the law that governs the Direct Loan Program, you may not waive the six-month grace period on a Direct Subsidized Loans or Direct Unsubsidized Loan that begins after you are no longer enrolled in school at least half-time. Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans only enter repayment at the end of the six-month grace period. Any payments made on a loan during the grace period, when you have no legal requirement to make payments, will be applied to reduce outstanding interest or loan principal and will not count as PSLF-qualifying payments."""

About half of my tuition was being paid by Fafsa money until half way through schooling, then I got cut off (basically). On top of that I lost financial aide help because I didn't keep my grades above a 2.5 avg. At that point I was paying about 21k a semester in just tuition and housing.   I couldn't transfer to a new school because of grades, couldn't get any financial help because of grades (I did try just applying for scholarships but none went through). Decided to stick it out due to peer pressure, parents (kept telling me I picked a good profession, I could handle the debt) and trying to basically make myself feel better about doing so poorly. I ended up having to go an extra semester as well which was the most expensive.  Yeah, I figured this might be the case. I was hoping that I could find some small of unheard of thing that could save me but I guess that was actually really silly of me.   Also I consider my job solid because there is room to grow, get a pay raise (many people in my position are able to reach 55-60 base salary within 2 or 3 years) and the company is in an extremely stable market with no real big fluctuations."

The only way the Direct Stafford loans can be increased up to the independent student limits (9,500/10,500/12,500 respectively) is if the parent applies for a Direct PLUS loan and their credit is denied.

It would take nearly 15 years of deferment for the balance to double at that rate.   How does anyone even go to college?   Scholarships, grants, federal and private loans, working while in school, help from parents or other family members, military benefits, attending a college close to home to avoid paying for room and board...

IME sounds like our Industrial Operations Engineering. We called in ""In and Out Easy"" engineering. Don't assume that you'll immediately be well employed with that degree. There are a lot of graduates in that specialty out there. You're going to be looking at $1000/mo payments on a 10 year plan. That's annoyingly high even with a decent $50k/yr job.   Where do I go for the remaining 12k$/year?   For the first year? Private loan most likely. Sallie Mae, Discover, Wells Fargo, Citibank, and a bunch of others have all offered them in the past. Not sure if they're all still doing it. The terms tend to be pretty much the same between them all. You'll REALLY want a co-signer with good credit to get you a reasonable rate. The money will get disbursed directly to the school and they'll cut you a check for any excess.  For the second+ years, you can take a big chunk out of that yourself. Get a job as soon as you get to campus freshman year. Work 10-20 hrs/week. There are a lot of ""easy"" jobs on campuses. Start looking for an engineering internship ASAP. Find any and all companies (or government agencies) in your home town where your parents live. If anyone your family knows works for any of those places, get in touch and try to find a position, even as an office assistant go-for.

A couple of questions you should try to solve before you talk to private lenders:   What is the total cost of tuition+housing+meal plan? What is the total amount of money they are offering through the financial aid letter?

First, you just have to start an application requesting the amount and some sort of payback plan. I would strongly advise that you get someone, maybe a parent, to cosign the loan with you, granted they have good credit but almost anything might help if you do not have any credit history. I did not have any credit history, and my mother who has excellent credit cosigned on my loans. This took what could've been a 10-12% interest rate down to ~8%. That is still high but better than it could've been, and my other loan that came later has a much better rate because now I have some credit history.

Doing so before you get the job means you will be able to certify that your income is $0 - which means your payment will be $0 per month until you need to recertify next year.

But I wanted a thorough exploration of the options, which isn't really what I'm getting here and I'm a little disappointed by that.  I rarely come across anyone who has a solid grasp on the nuances of bankruptcy for these loans. The key point that article says that so many gloss over is:   The problem is the old tale that has consumers thinking there’s no chance to have these loans discharged, so they don’t try. Iuliano’s report found that only about 0.1 percent of consumers with student loans attempt to include them in their bankruptcy proceedings.   It was never my attention to try and weasel out my paying my loans, it's not like I consider myself some exception to the rule, despite how ridiculous the system has become in the US. But I do like knowing everything possible and if shit really does hit the fan, if there's something that would ease and shave at least a few years off a giant burden. I believe in knowing every tool there is in the box.  I mean there's a reasonable chance that I will make good money and be able to pay off the loans quicker, but I'm leaning with being conservative and pessimistic to get a worst case scenario reality."
StudentLoans,38lu1o,Betsy514,2,Fri Jun 5 17:42:35 2015 UTC,"I think that's because every court is different -and every consumer is different.  You can't cookie cutter student loan bankruptcy discharge to say if you owe this, but only make this, then they will discharge - that's not how it works.  They also look at factors such as age, ability to increase income over time, etc..  I'm sorry you're disappointed.  A bankruptcy attorney might give you more of what you're looking for."
StudentLoans,38lu1o,Betsy514,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"Also consider that now that IBR exists, it's hard to meeting the prong of the Brunner test that says that making the loan payments will cause the borrower to not be able to sustain a minimal standard of living.  That's hard to say if you have zero dollar payments under IBR..."
StudentLoans,38lu1o,Betsy514,2,Fri Jun 5 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"That's a great point about IBR. Someone out there realized this was a solution to that whole bankruptcy issue. Not a fun one, but a very reasonable one at that.   Also makes sense of the complexities of the bankruptcy discharges. I'm still surprised I haven't really come across any accounts of people going through that process though, I would love to see that. All in all though, I think this clears it up well enough, I really appreciate your input. The path seems clearer now. Long, but clear."

StudentLoans,38lu1o,PsychoGod,2,Sat Jun 6 01:34:37 2015 UTC,"I think the bankruptcy discharge is usually if the school was a fraud, you are permanently disabled or graduated at 65 with that $170k in loans. Your best bet is IBR and forgiveness after 20 years. It's going to be a HUGE tax bill, but that's pretty much the only option, unless you found some non-profit work or win the lottery."
StudentLoans,38lu1o,anyadualla,-5,Fri Jun 5 04:11:44 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude, but ""I think"" isn't really the best response on this forum. People want solid answers from people who know all the in-and-outs. That doesn't seem to happen here a lot.  IBR is likely the best route to take, however I've been wanting to hear more about bankruptcy rules too. I swear I heard a bit on NPR or KQED once about it, but I've never found the it online to re-listen to. What I have gathered is that borrowers are much more dismissive about it than they should be, but it's also not an easy and still involves a lot of hardship."
StudentLoans,38lu1o,PsychoGod,6,Fri Jun 5 18:42:22 2015 UTC,"Then the best course of action would be to consult a bankruptcy lawyer that handles student loan cases, not people on the internet..."
StudentLoans,38lu1o,ANGR1ST,-2,Fri Jun 5 19:00:56 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah fair point. But this place is a suppose to be a solid resource is it not? At the very least, it should aspire to be. I hope hope more bankruptcy lawyers and student loan specialists are on here, because lots of people in the real world don't know where to go in the first place.  I mean, a school's finaid department is never useful or gives solid advice. I've seen it dealing with my school and both of my sister's. The FinAid department always plays it safe, doesn't take sides with any particular bank (which is understandable), but as a result they don't bring anything useful to the table and don't inform students on these huge life changing decisions - they just help perpetuate the problem with vague, generic information.   Also, usually a good bankruptcy lawyer often doesn't have free consultation, although there are plenty that do and it doesn't inherently point at their quality. I was looking into general bankruptcy awhile ago for my parents because they got themselves in serious credit debt and the reputable lawyers around me weren't free. It made my parents think there was no one out there that really cared and that everyone just wants part of their (non-existent) pie."
StudentLoans,38lu1o,tron103,6,Fri Jun 5 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"$175k is the combined total from both my undergrad and graduate loans.  The part that really makes people wince is that I went down the dreaded and much looked down upon Art field.  there are tough realities ahead and I was aware of them going into school. I won’t be making significant money anytime soon, if ever.   Wait ... so you went down this path, knowing that you were going to borrow vastly more money than you could ever hope to repay? You were aware of this when you started?  Enjoy paying your loans for the next couple of decades. That's what you signed up for. I don't see any reason that you should qualify for a discharge just because you borrowed more than you should have. Come on.  ...   I’m not saying bankruptcy is the only solution, but given this situation, what are my best and smartest choices?    Get a job that will allow you to repay your debt? Not as an artsy whatever, but as a tool and die maker or something else that they pay you good money to do.  Become a teacher and hope that you can get to the PSLF point before someone brings some sanity to that program and caps the forgiven balance?"
StudentLoans,38lu1o,tron103,-5,Fri Jun 5 06:38:02 2015 UTC,"Your missing what I asking, though maybe I wasn't clear on that. I plan on paying with the IBR plan, but I want a thorough exploration of the options, which isn't really what I'm getting here and I'm a little disappointed by that. I believe in knowing every tool there is in the kit and want to be as comprehensive as possible. Instead I'm ending up with a dismissive discussion. I rarely come across anyone who has a solid grasp on (or at least delves into) the nuances of all the different payment structures and the rarely acknowledged bankruptcy option for loans.   It was never my attention to try and weasel out my paying my loans, it's not like I consider myself some exception to the rule, despite how ridiculous the system has become in the US. There's a reasonable chance that I will make good money and be able to pay off the loans quicker, but I'm leaning with being conservative and pessimistic to get a worst case scenario reality. But I do like knowing everything possible and if shit really does hit the fan, if there's something that would ease and shave at least a few years off a giant burden, I want to be competent about it. A lot of people who file for bankruptcy (in general, not just for student loans), wish they did so years sooner than they did. If I get to the place where that just makes the most sense, I want to be able to take it on in the most educated and smart way there is.   And I almost certainly will get a side job to subsidize what I'm doing, at least at first, not like I'm not lazy. I've spent the last couple of years working 12-18 hour days on my craft and have gained recognition for it. I'm not throwing that away on just a generic job to pay off something that has nothing to do what I've spent half my life working towards. A lot of people can do that, not a lot of people can do what I do. And even if I never get the full recognition for it in my lifetime or make significant money, I know what I've produced means something to people, even if they don't know it was me that did it (and that's more than fine with me).  There is only one Beethoven's 9th. There are thousands of people who can make tools based on instructions or even find truths in universe that are sitting around to be discovered in science and math. And those things are great, have a great value, and need to be done; but its not the path I decided to take, for better or worse. I make laborious, hand crafted films that people find meaning and entertainment in. Even if I die in a paupers grave, I'll live the life I wanted and get the respect from those that matter to me. Fuck anything else."

StudentLoans,38jsd8,asharastark,2,Thu Jun 4 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"Most of the variable rate private loans adjust monthly or, at the best, annually. Can't count on rates being this low forever - I'd opt for a fixed rate loan whenever possible, even if the intro rate is higher."
StudentLoans,38jsd8,jayfleischman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:48:50 2015 UTC,"I need to take out loans to cover my last two years of school, the first two I was able to do with my parents and a home equity line of credit, and I need to take out 17,000 each year, but I can only do it one year at a time, I am in the process of finalizing my loan today, and my bank has given me about 15 different options   Okay, let's back up for a second. Have you completed the FAFSA yet? If not, you need to do this first. Always max out your federal options before considering private loans.   I just wanted to clarify and get some opinions on this loan, this is saying for the duration of my education +6 months I only have to pay the 35 dollars, and then after that the 300 per month correct?    Sounds like it, yes.   Should I be weary of the variable interest rate (is it tied to a floating rate like LIBOR)   Yes, variable rates are tied to either Prime or LIBOR. They are currently at historic lows so they pretty much have nowhere to go but up. Variable rates are particularly risky if you plan on taking a long time to pay back your loans after graduation. Given that your repayment period is short (5 years), I wouldn't worry too much about this.   I feel like borrowing 17 and only having to pay back 19, there must be some sort of catch.   Not really. You're looking at the shortest possible repayment length (5 years) and the starting rate is only 2.43%, so the total they provided sounds about right. The only real ""catch"" is that they are only able to calculate a total based on the assumption that the rate stays the same for the full repayment period, which it probably won't.  Also, have you totaled up what all of your loans will cost after graduation? If you take out two $17K private loans, the total payment is going to be around $600 per month after you graduate. That's a pretty hefty amount by itself. Are you going to be responsible for any other loan payments on top of that, or did your parents take full responsibility for the first two years? Also, what type of degree are you pursuing and how confident do you feel about your employment prospects?"
StudentLoans,38jsd8,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"I will have no other loans coming out of school other than money borrowed from my parents, which I can pay back whenever interest free. I will be able to afford 600 a month in loans, because worst case scenario I can work at a service / retail job, and I know Ill be able to work enough to afford the 600. I cannot get any more money from fafsa, I currently get 1500 a semester if I remember correctly, and I am pursuing a degree in Finance (ironic, i know) and I feel fairly strong about my employment opportunities, I know a few people in the industry, I am taking classes with real world application, I have a 3.8 GPA, I am already working on findiny my junior year internship, and I have about 8 grand as a safety net that I will not be able to touch until I am out of school. So I feel fairly confident about my employment prospects, also, I am frugal to the point of being miserly, and I am a fantastic saver (or at least should be considered this in todays environment) my friends spend money like its no concern, but I rarely spend money on anything frivilous and never live above my means.  my main concern was with the variable rate, I tried to do some looking around and the only thing I could find was a projection on the 1 month LIBOR for the next two years and it didnt have it at anything above .22% so that was reassuring"

StudentLoans,38gfg5,SoriAryl,3,Thu Jun 4 01:44:40 2015 UTC,No. It is fairly common for credits to not transfer between different colleges. That alone is not enough to qualify for any type of loan forgiveness. The closest thing to what you're describing is the Closed School Discharge... but this only applies if your school closes and you are unable to transfer any of the credits to another school.
