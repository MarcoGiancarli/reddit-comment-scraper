Jaguars,3dpxll,ropeculture,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:50:19 2015 UTC,"I own alot of football (soccer) jerseys, and most of them are pretty slim fitting.

Jaguars,3dpxll,Rainman316,2,Sat Jul 18 15:34:19 2015 UTC,"Just based on your waist and shoulder measurements, I'd probably go with an XL. Length shouldn't be a problem at that size, because NFL jerseys are made to be tucked in, meaning a perfect fit would probably hang to your groin, so even if it's a little small it will hang to your belt-line at the lowest."

Then it seems like NFL jerseys are at least a full size larger than a typical US shirt.   So, if I'm buying a european sized shirt I'm looking for a large, but when it comes to NFL jersey's I'm looking for a small.   Even though you're really tall, I still think the Large should fit you.

Good luck to him in his future endeavors"
Jaguars,3dntme,glowingdeer78,3,Fri Jul 17 20:23:32 2015 UTC,I really thought he was going to be an exceptional punt returner. So disappointed. I hope he finds another team.

Jaguars,3dntme,themcwale,10,Mon Jul 20 19:34:21 2015 UTC,At least he can catch with another team before training camp if it's a football related cut.
Jaguars,3dntme,heyareyouthatguy,7,Fri Jul 17 20:04:31 2015 UTC,"This doesn't surprise me.  Ace had been passed on the depth chart at WR by Robinson, Hurns and Lee, and by all accounts Greene was likely to do so as well.  As a punt returner last year, he was just awful.  I don't have enough fingers or toes to count the number of times Ace danced back and forth for a few seconds before getting tackled for a 2 yard gain.  If he would just run forward, he would've been passable as a punt returner, but his sideways running just wasn't good enough to beat defenders to the sidelines.  It's a shame because he had some promise after his first season, but just couldn't find a way to tap into that potential.  Wish him the best of luck should he land with another team (which I imagine he will considering how young he still is)."
Jaguars,3dntme,JaquiskiTaterTartt,3,Fri Jul 17 20:59:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought he was going to be good. Another team will likely give him a chance.

Jaguars,3dntme,grendel756,2,Sat Jul 18 03:13:05 2015 UTC,With a healthy Tandon Doss and Greene he had slim chances of making it. How would anyone think otherwise?
Jaguars,3dntme,pajamajoe,3,Sat Jul 18 04:05:15 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised he was cut this early, that's about it though."
Jaguars,3dntme,NeverTheSameMan,4,Sat Jul 18 13:12:43 2015 UTC,They were being nice by cutting him before camp. They knew he was expendable after Green fell to us in the 5th
Jaguars,3dntme,Rickety-Cricket,6,Fri Jul 17 20:52:43 2015 UTC,Kind of surprising timing as everything about him recently was positive enough that you'd think he would have got a shot in training camp. Does this mean we should expect the announcement of a signing soon? Could it be related to another suspension?
Jaguars,3dntme,cengic,5,Fri Jul 17 20:15:41 2015 UTC,No. I think they like the WRs we have with the addition of Greene who will take a majority of the snaps in the slot. I also think we're going to carry an extra TE which leaves Ace without a roster spot.  The timing just gives him time to find another team to start camp with.

Jaguars,3dntme,DanParker001,6,Fri Jul 17 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"in my point of view he was going to be gone, I remember in the end of season interviews when Dave Caldwell was talking about the team, it was the same one which he gave an indirect awnser about Cecil shorts possible return and just push Ace sanders under the bus.  Saying they were dissapointed in his development as a player since he wasnt featured as a WR in the offense and as a KR/PR he was awfull last season (example: Dallas game fumble and like 7 yards per return in the season)  That mightve been the reason why we drafted a R. Greene and the 2 late picks at WR"
Jaguars,3dntme,grendel756,0,Fri Jul 17 20:30:29 2015 UTC,I'm sorry if this pushes buttons but I think this is really stupid. I thought Ace was a good player.  EDIT: They've also should've waited until a preseason game cut.
Jaguars,3dntme,Goosehorn,8,Fri Jul 17 21:31:45 2015 UTC,Ace started off the 2014 season with a 4 game suspension and only produced 55 yards on 6 catches in the 12 games after that. And he was brought in to help our special teams and hardly produced there either.  I don't think it was stupid at all.
Jaguars,3dntme,Rainman316,2,Fri Jul 17 21:57:28 2015 UTC,Watching him return punts was hard. He would dance back and forth and only gain a few yards at most.

Sure he didn't produce much last year, but neither did anyone else below him on the depth chart Id bet. Yet we released him and kept on vet WRs whose names I've pretty much never even heard. Why not release one of those guys and keep him as a 3rd string guy? He's still young and has plenty of potential, and it's not like we're needing cap space"
Jaguars,3dntme,toad_mountain,2,Fri Jul 17 23:27:48 2015 UTC,"We have hurns, Robinson, Lee, and Greene as our receivers. Last year we had 5, but we will probably keep an 4th tight end instead of a 5th receiver.

Everyone talks about how the line couldn't buy time couldn't make holes, how the Jags have a weak secondary. ""Theres no true Otto on that team"" they say. ""Julius thomas was a product of peyton manning""  Were about to fuckin see"
Jaguars,3dc8of,rmorley1,5,Wed Jul 15 03:35:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with your very last statement, ""We're about to fuckin see."" I've tuned out almost all of the offseason stuff for the first season in a long while with the exception of the draft and free agency. Regardless of what is said or done now it won't matter until the season starts and we can finally see what this team will do. I'm personally excited. I have my first real job now that I'm done with my Master's and I expect to be going to a game or two this season. I can't wait to see what is in store for the Jags."

Jaguars,3dc8of,twjohns97,0,Wed Jul 15 19:26:37 2015 UTC,"I really hope Hurns beats out Greene for that spot. Greene is just too fragile to be a starter. He's going to be like Wes Welker was this last season: effective, solid route runner over the middle, 4+ catches a game WHEN HEALTHY, plays less than 8 games per season. Otherwise, I'm fucking stoked for this season."
Jaguars,3dalwc,waynewideopenTD,4,Tue Jul 14 20:06:03 2015 UTC,Overall buy. Low price after poor performance last year. Major offensive and defensive additions to the roster means the jags may have as many as 5 new starters on offense and 4 on defense. Thats pretty significant change from one year to the next.   Were expecting many second year skill players to make improvements and the offensive line should be much improved given 3 key offseason aadditions as well as possibly the best OL coach in the NFL (after essentially not having an OL coach last season).   Point being that I consider the jags prime candidates to be that team that looks completely different than the year before.

Jaguars,3dalwc,Metaboss84,2,Wed Jul 15 00:40:06 2015 UTC,"it's a long shot, but Cann may well just win the job from Beadles. But I think having to choose between 2 good players is a problem we'd like to have more of."
Jaguars,3dalwc,Ispentthatbread,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:00:10 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Cann in pads before we call him a good player, tbh. I think the competition to watch between two good players is definitely Bowanko vs Wiz.That's going to be a major battle, barring someone pulling a Brewster."
Jaguars,3dalwc,Metaboss84,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:07:40 2015 UTC,"That's why I wanted unclear language used. You're completely correct that now is not the time to be rating Cann; that would probably be in the preseason games for me.

Jaguars,3dalwc,Puppypunter95,3,Wed Jul 15 03:29:16 2015 UTC,"I'm going with a hold. JT is the only big name on offense, with the rest relying on a questionable offensive line and a pack of Sophomore receivers. Bortles has to have serious improvement as well, or the whole offense will go stagnate. Defense will probably be equal to last year.   Its hard to imagine the team doing worse, but if they can't improve, The Gus Bus falls apart, Kahn cleans house, and we're back to depression and square one."
Jaguars,3dalwc,baconbitarded,2,Wed Jul 15 06:12:35 2015 UTC,Nothing can ever put me back to where we were when Todd fucking Bouman was starting. Nothing.
Jaguars,3dalwc,Jags4Life,3,Wed Jul 15 17:49:56 2015 UTC,"Team: Buy, buy, buy. The price is so low, what have you got to lose?  Coaching: Hold. We love Gus Bradley, but the wins are slow in coming.  QB: Buy. Why not? Blake Bortles was the worst statistical QB among starters last year, it's got to be cheap.  O-line: Buy. It's revamped and bound to be cheap.  Tight End: Buy. Julius Thomas helps immensely and takes pressure off Marcedes Lewis.  Wide Receiver: Hold. No idea if anybody aside from Allen Robinson can really do much.  Running Back: Hold. Robinson had some good games, Gerhart is a disappointment, and Yeldon is unproven.  Maybe I'll get to the defense later, but for now the price on the Jags would be cheap so gobble that stock up!"
Jaguars,3dalwc,Brysynner,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:05:17 2015 UTC,"I'll buy, but I'm a mark and will buy on the Jags every year. Easiest sell this year is going to be the Texans. Yeah they have JJ Watt, but they also have Brian Hoyer behind center."
Jaguars,3dalwc,freshproduce,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"Say what? Maybe I'm just a total homer, but we have a pretty balanced team overall. Arian Foster, Deandre Hopkins, Duane Brown, Clowney, Cushing, etc.  And those are just the names that you might recognize...  Furthermore, it's not been decided whether Hoyer or Mallett will get the start."
Jaguars,3dalwc,Brysynner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:12:47 2015 UTC,Either way you guys are in a big holding pattern. Neither QB are anything special to write home about.   I think the Texans are lucky they play in the South because they're record makes them seem a lot better than they are. I'd say they're probably a six to seven win team if they don't pad wins against the Titans and the young Jags
Jaguars,3dalwc,freshproduce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:08:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure where to start with this but I'll give it a shot.   A big holding pattern? What does that even mean? We made playoffs 2 out of the last 4 years. We missed playoffs by one game last year with Ryan Fitzpatrick at the helm (no offense meant to him, he balled out). I grant that Hoyer isn't anything special but you and I both have seen a maximum of two games out of Mallett. The game that he wasn't injured in, he lead the Texans over a very strong Browns defense last year. So that's a wash. By saying that we are ""lucky to be in the AFC South"", you are only insulting your own organization and perpetuating that idea. Every division has its ups and downs (see: NFCS last season) and games are decided any given Sunday. Young Jags? The Texans are a younger franchise. Unless you're talking about player age on one's roster? I think we might still have y'all beat on that. I haven't done the math, but, feel free to prove me wrong."
Jaguars,3dalwc,Brysynner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:27:15 2015 UTC,"Would you have been in contention for the playoffs if the Jags and Titans weren't so bad? Having two of the worst teams in the league to play 4 times a year pad a record As for your QB situation I don't think Mallett is anything special good enough to take you deep in the playoffs. At best he's David Garrard 2.0. So with the stars align things might work out but you need the stars to align. I still think Bridgewater should've been the pick over Clowney unless the plan is to build a 2000 Ravens Super Bowl team Of course the division sucks. The Jags have been drafting top 5 for the past few years, the Titans haven't been much better since Vince Young's rookie season. So a competent team should have 4 easy wins in the division.  We started a rookie at QB, RT, C, WR, LB, CB last year had second year players filling out at HB, LT, SS, RG. The average age of the Jags was 25.4. The only contributes over that age last year were Scobee, Marcedes, Poz, Marks, Clemons. Of course this is off the top of my head. So I could be wrong. When are the Texans or whoever owns Relient Stadium gonna fix that shitty field turf that people complain about every year"
Jaguars,3dalwc,freshproduce,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"That's a difficult question to answer. I mean, we beat some good teams and lost to some bad ones. I'm not really sure what kind of response you're looking for here? I guess stop being bad? Again, I just think it's really early to call how good someone will be with so little game time on them. At pick #1, you just kinda have to take Clowney. I was hoping we could maybe grab Bridgewater in the 2nd but, apparently the FO didn't want him that bad. In BoB we trust. So if we are even just a ""competent team"" by your measure of getting those 4 wins against y'all and the Tits, how are we the ""easiest sell""? It seems like there should be less competent teams that could apparently not get those 4 wins. They seem more ""sellable"" to me. Well, y'all have quite the cap space so I assumed y'all would bring in more experienced players to help out younger dudes. Guess not. Your guess is as good as mine. NRG (what it's now called) hosts the Houston Livestock and Rodeo Show every year. That shit brings in like 100x the amount of money that the Texans do. Hopefully it doesn't take another athlete getting injured before we fix this."

Jaguars,3d91hq,FreshRain,3,Tue Jul 14 13:20:49 2015 UTC,I'd be shocked to see him get significant carries. Yeldon is the man going forward and Robinson straight up outplayed Gerhart last year. He'll have to prove it on limited reps if he gets a few shots here and there.
Jaguars,3d91hq,Jags4Life,2,Tue Jul 14 16:08:54 2015 UTC,"Realistically, he'll probably be given a few chances on short yardage downs or when Yeldon/Robinson need a breather. He's incredibly average from what I've seen."
