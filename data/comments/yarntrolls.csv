I bet if you asked if they would drive 20 mins out their way to pick up the game for nothing.. they would say yes...  my ex hubby passed comments on my spinning wheels and how could I need more than 1 as you can only use one at a time.. so I asked him just how many guitars he actually needed, after all, he can only play 1 at a time.  He went very very quiet. (yes Mr I got like 6 guitars, a mandolin, etc..)"

yarntrolls,3d2kqg,AreThereRocksAhead,17,Mon Jul 13 00:42:29 2015 UTC,It makes me wonder who knitted the bit they already have and why that person then allowed the commercial to proceed.

He thinks I shouldn't care because I'm a hooker not a knitter...but I can't stand that he isn't working the yarn... Also the needles seem wrong for that size yarn, or am I just being utterly crazy?"

yarntrolls,3d2kqg,florinchen,9,Mon Jul 13 12:25:53 2015 UTC,I agree with all the other problems people have pointed out. I'll also add why exactly would you not ball the yarn first? Working straight from a hank is only going to end in a mass of tangles and sadness.

yarntrolls,3clmu8,KelseyTheGreat,4,Wed Jul 8 23:54:33 2015 UTC,"It's things liek this I am so glad we have an allowance set up for each of us.  We each get a set amount of money each month that isn't for bills or necessities or even for the things we are saving for together. This is simply our ""extras"" money.  We get the same amount and what we do with it is entirely up to the individual. I can spend it on projects books, games whatever I want. Or I can save it for something big later. He has the same options. Buy anything or save it. The rule is though once you are out of money for the month you don't get more. You're simply done spending for that month. Also no matter what the other person spends their money on it isn't for the other person to judge or ask if it was an important purchase.   It's so nice never having to justify purchases to the other person and there is something freeing knowing we are both spending within our limits and getting what we want still."

Not that he made me feel bad or anything, but our budget closed up wayyyy more so little purchases became a bigger deal.   We totally do the allowance thing too, when the budget permits! It's nice to know you can buy whatever you want and your partner can't say it's frivolous or pointless or whatever. He wants to buy 10 packs of Hearthstone cards or whatever? Fine!! I want to blow my full allowance on 2 skeins of malabrigo or Madeleine Tosh? Myyyy choice!! So I totally feel ya there!!"

If there's one thing I love about yarn, it's the cute and fun names people come up with to match their personality! If you don't have a local shop that sells yarn, try Webs, I will always shop their first when looking for yarn and there are some great closeouts happening now. I'm not too familiar with thinner weight yarns, like you mentioned your recipient likes, but worsted is always a safe selection for basic things like hats and scarves.

What sorts of things do they knit?  Sweaters?  Socks? Cowls? Scarves?  Do they seem to favor fine yarns or thick, chunky ones?  For instance, if a sock knitter, one can never have too many really nice circs in size 00 to 2.  But this would be useless to a knitter who primarily makes thick and chunky cowls."

yarntrolls,370c35,Kongo204,3,Sun May 24 00:42:02 2015 UTC,Why do people think needles are held that way?

yarntrolls,370c35,TanRabbits,2,Sun May 24 13:13:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's called pencil style, or parlour knitting- at least when you hold the right needle like that. It was a popular method in the Victorian era."

yarntrolls,36zs5k,GretaX,3,Sat May 23 19:02:27 2015 UTC,I did fingerless gloves with magic loop.  And I only ripped out one of the fingers 4 times.
yarntrolls,36zs5k,dragon34,2,Sun May 24 02:36:46 2015 UTC,I learnt how to knit in the round on DPNs so now they're second nature and magic loop is just some weird witchcraft I use rarely. Its really straight forward once you get the rhythm down :)
yarntrolls,36zs5k,cottonwoolalpaca,2,Sun May 24 05:40:24 2015 UTC,"I think magic loop's name does it a disservice by making sound like way less of an obvious solution it is. Needles too long? Just pull a little out of the way! It turns tubular knitting back into 2D.  I learned on circulars because you can knit in the round or pretend they're straights and I didn't want to invest in multiple sets of needles.  Magic loop lets you move the needles more comfortably, imo, since all the stitches are in one place and the needles aren't tied down like they would be if the needles were the exact length needed."
yarntrolls,36kadh,Kongo204,8,Wed May 20 00:30:45 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hate when anything shows knitters holding the needles like that.  Do a little research.   Also that Gilmore Girls episode with the knit a thon or whatever.  No, you don't start with two needles in your hands."
yarntrolls,36kadh,Sunna3,3,Wed May 20 13:16:44 2015 UTC,"Oh that Gilmore girls knitting episode really had me laughing.  Wouldn't you at least try to show people how to knit first?  There was one commercial on a few years ago where the work on the needles was CLEARLY crochet.  It is like they stuck crochet work on knitting needles and said ""WELP,  I hope no one notices."""

yarntrolls,365l04,airhornsman,4,Sat May 16 22:11:34 2015 UTC,"I recommend How I Spin by Rita Buchanan. It's a great resource.  The Alden Amos Book is a classic. And I also recommend The Fleece and Fiber Sourcebook, they also make a portable version I take to fiber festivals. I also like The Intentional Spinner but most of the books published by interweave are good. I suggest picking up a copy of Spin Off, too. Also Ravelry has good resources.   My best advice is to do what feels right for you, there are some specific techniques, but a lot of it is figuring out what motions feel best for you."

yarntrolls,34k9l1,ZanSquid,2,Sat May 2 00:18:04 2015 UTC,Can confirm.  I just finished a sweater and was 6 stitches short on the bind-off and had to break into a new ball of yarn.    I played Yarn Chicken and lost.

yarntrolls,32ttd7,average_fan,3,Thu Apr 16 21:40:35 2015 UTC,Any way the pattern can be just a bit shorter? That's the absolute worst feeling.
yarntrolls,32ttd7,rachycarebear,2,Thu Apr 16 19:13:31 2015 UTC,It's a test knit for a local designer so I can't really modify it. I put out a call in my local ravelry group to see if anyone has the same yarn. If not I guess I frog and find another yarn for the pattern.
yarntrolls,32ttd7,rachycarebear,3,Thu Apr 16 21:48:34 2015 UTC,Did the designer include yardage? Because that sounds like something she'd want to know.
yarntrolls,32ttd7,rachycarebear,3,Thu Apr 16 23:01:12 2015 UTC,It's my fault cause I used a different yarn than recommended and wasn't paying attention to yardage. I'm more used to looking at weight. The swatch was perfect even with different sized needles so I thought I'd be alright. I'm about 4 yards short :/ It's basically all my fault but I can still be irrationally upset at the yarn for being so beautiful and failing me.

yarntrolls,32ttd7,awesomecatlady,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:07:16 2015 UTC,Oh that is pretty! Is there a contrast you can use or does the designer require you to use the same yarn throughout?
yarntrolls,32ttd7,awesomecatlady,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:43:11 2015 UTC,It doesn't specify. However I don't have any yarn that would work for a contrast.

yarntrolls,32ttd7,aggravatingyou,3,Fri Apr 17 14:19:18 2015 UTC,Oofff that sucks. I have frogged gauge swatches when I needed that little bit of extra yarn. Other options include a decorative contrast color bind off or shortening the pattern.
yarntrolls,32ttd7,knittedgalaxy,2,Thu Apr 16 21:00:07 2015 UTC,I already frogged the swatch and still don't have enough. I would totally make it shorter but it's a test knit for a local designer. I'll keep the contrast colour in mind but I don't think I have any yarn with a similar fiber content.

She came home and told me everyone loved them and she could have sold 10 pairs right there.  I started shaking my head no,  not interested.  She said well how much would you sell them for,  like $10? I had to laugh.  Let's see.  The yarn for your socks was about $7.50 I think and it took me about 6 hours to make them.  So ... no.  I just make them for friends and family ok? She didn't try to convince me anymore."

yarntrolls,32l6l0,thisismeER,3,Wed Apr 15 03:16:15 2015 UTC,"So full disclosure, I still haven't actually finished my first quilt but you should probably set aside $200ish. It'll depend on your fabric and batting choices, but quilting is really expensive. =["
yarntrolls,32l6l0,KashmirKnitter,3,Wed Apr 15 10:58:38 2015 UTC,But I have quilts that are 150 years old! It's totally worth the price at about $1.12 a year!!
yarntrolls,32l6l0,irishfeet78,3,Wed Apr 15 15:28:45 2015 UTC,"Fabric will cost about $5-$10 a yard for your standard quilting cotton (nothing too specially designed. When get into designer fabrics it gets much more expensive). The yardage you will need depends on the patterns you choose. The fewer pieces you have total will mean fewer seam lines (1/4"" each so you ""lose"" a half inch of fabric on every seam).  let's say you're doing a 90x90 (all measurements will be in inches for this) quilt. (the actual size will depend on how much over hand you want, pattern size, border size.... however 90x90 is easy to work with)  1 yard of fabric (36x45)  You will need 2.5 yards for length and 2 yards of width  that gives you 5 yards without counting seam allowances.  Again the more pieces you have the more yardage you will need. 5 yards at $5 is $25 (so minimum yardage at lowest prices)  You will also need batting (it's not a quilt until it's been layered). The batting is what goes between the lovely pieced top and the back (usually solid). It's what makes a quilt thin or thick, light or super warm. You're probably looking at another $40 or $50 here for a medium weight basic cotton batting  Now you need a backing. This needs to be either pieced or one of the many large width fabrics available out there. Let's use the basic 5 yards again for that measurement so add in another $20 at minimum.  Now you need your thread to actually quilt your blanket and then some binding.  Doing it cheaply you could piece an entire quilt for $100. However the more design and piecing you do, the higher quality materials, and the wider fabrics you can easily run that cost upwards of $200 for a queen sized quilt. It is not a cheap hobby, but you can see why quilts you buy (especially hand made ones) are so incredibly expensive. It takes many many hours of pieceing and sewing, even on simple quilts to get a finished piece."

I may watch videos to see the flow but when I'm doing it I want to be able to look at the step I'm at when I'm at it.  For newbies, I usually start a swatch and let them watch me work a row or two, then hand it off to them and watch them work a row or two while working on my own swatch so I can show them without grabbing their work. When they're feeling comfortable(ish) I stop watching closely and just keep working away and help as asked. I remind the person that it's a muscle memory thing and it's going to feel awkward for a while."

yarntrolls,31be1s,infinit3j3st,15,Fri Apr 3 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"My SO crochets. Not much, but periodically he'll pick up a hook and make something small. The other day I mentioned I was giving away some yarn to my Redditgifts giftee and he wasn't so thrilled, because ""what if we need the yarn later?"" The gif above was basically my response to his acknowledgement of the value of stash yarn."
yarntrolls,31be1s,rachycarebear,17,Fri Apr 3 16:39:25 2015 UTC,"My ex never did understand why I needed so much yarn.  Um, duh, what if I want to knit 300 sweaters and all of the yarn stores are closed?"
yarntrolls,31be1s,rachycarebear,10,Fri Apr 3 17:43:09 2015 UTC,What if all 200 yarn stores within driving distance shut down and you could no longer buy yarn on the internet? What would I do then!?
yarntrolls,31be1s,digitalyss,9,Fri Apr 3 17:48:27 2015 UTC,What if we end up in a nuclear winter? You'll be sorry you questioned me then.
yarntrolls,31be1s,elkanor,6,Fri Apr 3 19:32:07 2015 UTC,"This is how I justify my knitting skills. Look guys, come the zombie apocalypse or other disaster, all I've got is a basic understanding of baking and the ability to create objects that keep your feet and head dry. I don't do guns and I'd be crap at trapping animals. I need to be useful for the ragtag group of survivors."

But at least there's hope my second giftee.    This is my first yarn exchange and so far it's been a huge disappointment.  And I was so excited initially."
yarntrolls,317v2u,MsAlign,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:35:31 2015 UTC,"I totally totally understand. I spent like hours hemming and hawing over the contents of the box I packed full for my recipient. It's been delivered. They certified my shipping proof... nada I'm always so nervous about the gifts I give.   My santa hasn't sent my yarn either. I have never in all my years of swapping on different sites, facebook etc gotten a gift from my match. But I've never been in a swap that has re gifters so I'm not too fussed."
yarntrolls,317v2u,ambersroses81,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:31:45 2015 UTC,"Since my bitching my recipient has posted that she got (and really liked) her yarn, and yesterday afternoon reddit gifts sent me an email that my yarn has been shipped.  So sometimes complaining does work, ha ha.  There's hope for you, too.  Maybe she's just a procrastinater and hasn't gotten around to taking a picture and posting it yet.  It is Easter week.  She could be on vacation or something.  Although I never found out if my Christmas secret santa liked his gift, so there are some people who just don't play along, which is frustrating.   If you aren't willing to play your part, why do people sign up for the exchanges?   As for yarn, you still might get some.  If nothing else, some of us are signed up for rematches.  So you might get something on go-round #2.  I've never rematched before (this is only my secind ever exchange), but I'm looking forward to getting something for someone who got skipped.   But I totally get the most disappointing thing is not getting feedback on the thing you chose and sent.  That really is worse than not getting yarn.  It's like taking 50 bucks and throwing it off a bridge -- someone might enjoy it but it would be nice to know for sure."
yarntrolls,317v2u,MsAlign,3,Sun Apr 5 13:12:14 2015 UTC,"I still haven't finished packing mine up. Need to write a card, pack, and will ship it tomorrow. I did contact my giftee so hopefully they're not despairing.   Haven't gotten notice that mine has shipped and I figure that's normal right now."
yarntrolls,317v2u,sniktter,2,Fri Apr 3 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Same here. My Santa hasn't pulled my info since the first day it was available.   Although I'm happy to say my giftee was thrilled with what I got her. :)  I'd like to mention, on this note of not receiving (so far), that signing up to be a rematcher is very satisfying. I've done it almost every exchange since I usually also don't get anything."
yarntrolls,317v2u,fleekyone,3,Thu Apr 2 20:43:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything from my Santa, they also pulled my info the first day it was available.

I also signed up to be a rematch because giving yarn is so much more fun than trying to find a use for something that may or may not fit in your current yarn hoard."

yarntrolls,317v2u,rachycarebear,2,Thu Apr 2 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"Ive gotten my yarn, but I haven't heard from my giftee. Proof of shipping was accepted, so I'm technically done, but I have no idea if she liked it or not."
yarntrolls,317v2u,OneToeInTheCesspool,2,Thu Apr 2 20:50:54 2015 UTC,That's always so tough. I had two rematchees from ss14 who went missing. It makes me wonder if they hated it :/
yarntrolls,317v2u,rachycarebear,2,Thu Apr 2 21:28:40 2015 UTC,I sent mine last Friday to someone else who was in the UK and she hasn't said received so I think she's hated it too :( but she was meant to be someone who received nothing in their last exchange so I'd have thought they'd be eager to post their gift. But equally so I've realised this suggests that they lied about not receiving their last gift so much aaaahhhhhh! My neuroses kicked in.
yarntrolls,317v2u,PhoenixGrey,3,Thu Apr 2 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"I've started getting a bit more selfish. If I sense you're the sort of person who won't post or will create a really lame post, I'm not going to put that much effort in. I'll make or buy something worth $25 or so and ship it out instead of doing what I normally do and go completely overboard.   Both my yarn and books giftee have been really responsive to messages, so I sent my yarn giftee yarn + candy (really wish I could've afforded to send more) and my books giftee is getting a huge box of books plus bonus goodies (yarn, the bonus goodies is yarn. Yes, I'm sending yarn for a non-yarn exchange, not that I'm a yarn evangelist or anything.) I also hope to send both of them the patterns I've published on Ravelry just as an added piece to the gift."
yarntrolls,317v2u,rachycarebear,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"See, I sort of feel this way, too. I sent my giftee a message the first day and didn't hear from her until, like, a week ago. Even when she did reply, she gave me the bare minimum. I was so disappointed that I still haven't bought her anything. I'm planning on going to my LYS tomorrow morning (it's been a long week at school and I haven't had time before now) and I'll get her a ball of Juniper Moon and send her a couple of my stash items. It's still going to be a pretty good package, I think, but I can't help but feel shafted."
yarntrolls,317v2u,NachoCupcake,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:19:43 2015 UTC,"It's a lot less stress for me at the end of the day. My SO keeps me in line and reminds me that the stress of it gets to me when people don't thank. He reminds me to be reasonable instead of entirely nuts. (Because 33lbs of books is totally reasonable, right?)"
yarntrolls,317v2u,rachycarebear,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:20:42 2015 UTC,I'm absolutely that kind of person who goes overboard. When you said 33 pounds of books I got excited because that sounds like a fantastic gift.
yarntrolls,317v2u,goldstar_femme,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:12:40 2015 UTC,I asked specific questions that would've helped me tailor the yarn but she never responded even on reddit or ravelry. I was a little sad but I still went over board! I hand spun three skeins of Merino and dyed a bunch of cotton and then still bought 4 more alpaca with sparklies and THEN I went through my stash and threw in two more Shetland wools. I know she was a bit of a newby who'd not gotten the chance to use much natural fiber so I went crazy giving her a little bit of every world. If I'd had the chance I would have finished my silk spin and give some... but she also doesn't like thinner yarns and pure silk always feels like a waste in bulkies.   On that note I can't wait for the rematch! I hope I get someone who loves lace and fingering weight or at least some DK!

yarntrolls,317v2u,VocePoetica,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:47:07 2015 UTC,"Do you have the option of signing up for more than one? They changed it recently. If I recall correctly, you can now only sign up for one rematch until you've completed previous gifts successfully. If you get a rematch early and ship it out right away, you may be able to sign up for a second rematch for this round.  Rematchers are the best. Thanks for being awesome!

yarntrolls,317v2u,NachoCupcake,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:24:19 2015 UTC,If you do just give it a nice washing with delicate hand soap and cold water and hang it out in a little wind... I can't save you on the super saver though.... if you get it make a rug or squishy matt for the kitchen! The bulk yarns are great for that!

It's a yarn exchange, I want to get something more than the basics you can pick up in AC Moore or the like. I'm hoping for something beautiful that I'll love. If it's smoky or super cheap, chances are my Santa didn't put in that much thought or care since those are two things I specifically requested not to have."

I'm pretty darn happy with how it's gone so far.  I can't swing yarn rematching this time around because I picked up the third exchange.

On the other, the F will eventually turn up (right? right? it will!) and then I'll have two of the same."

I have an E and G in the Amour that I use often and a C I use less often.  In Soft Touch I have an H and J.  Also, your lost F will turn up the second you finally cave and buy a replacement.  That's how these things work."

That's how I ended up with two H, I, and C in the Soft Touch.  Of course, if I go with an Amour there's a chance I'll never find the Soft Touch because I didn't buy the same one so finding it wouldn't be completely pointless."

He then told me his mom can knit up a pair of socks in an afternoon.

My giftee is just beginning to crochet and hadn't used anything thinner than bulky yarn. I got her three coordinating solid skeins that'll go well with her hair (red hair, purple, lavender, and silver yarn) that are made from plant fibers. I figured she's probably been using acrylic, and everyone needs to stretch their horizons."

I've got a few different things in mind, still need to do more research into my giftee before I choose.  I'm thinking a nice Malbrigo or Madeline tosh, and a pattern to go with it?"

yarntrolls,2ymgxx,czerniana,2,Wed Mar 11 00:32:51 2015 UTC,"LOL. Yeah, there are a few types of lace I want to try and bobbin is one of them xD  There are also a few croatian and Italian ones that look fascinating.  There is very little information on the more obscure ones though, so it looks like I'll have to stick with irish lace or bobbin lace =/  I'm learning needle tatting now, i may try to mix that with irish lace elements and blend worlds."
yarntrolls,2ymgxx,cottonwoolalpaca,2,Wed Mar 11 00:46:16 2015 UTC,"So, so true. I started teaching myself bobbin lace using only vague instructions in free online resources which are often a little lacking. I should really buy some instructional books.  This person's YouTube channel is by far the most helpful visual resource I've found. I don't understand a word of Russian and the video quality isn't very good, but there's plenty there to be able to learn from observation.  Bobbin lace used to be shrouded in confusion and mysticism for me. Studying those videos (and probably every other bobbin lace video on YouTube) is what let me be able to look at a piece of finished lace and break down its components to what ground stitches, edge style, etc. was used, and what path you would take to make that piece. I can't always figure it out, and I still don't know how to make most of those stitches, but it's so refreshing to finally be able to look at bobbin lace and understand it.  Jo Edkins' website and her links are where I learned all the basics. Finding it was an absolute game changer. I'd say her site us great for learning all the basic stitches, but watching the videos is what helped me understand how those stitches come together."
yarntrolls,2ymgxx,cottonwoolalpaca,2,Wed Mar 11 00:59:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen Jo Edkin's website and I've got it favourited for when I get around to bobbin lace.  I'm just trying to get this wedding I'm going to out of the way first.  It's a masquerade ball for the reception and of course I'm hand making my mask and accessories. Between that and birthday gifts and baby shower gifts I've been so swamped lately.  Eventually I'm going to just have to start buying things for people instead of making them things.  I never get to do my own stuff because of it =P  I watch a lot of youtube videos not in English.  You're right, some of them are good enough that they don't really need the talking bit.  I always feel like I'm missing out on tips and tricks though."
yarntrolls,2yk0y1,WotS43,5,Tue Mar 10 13:32:59 2015 UTC,"It was an hour round trip to get there, and the first time I ever visited that yarn store, too =("
yarntrolls,2yk0y1,Sm00chie,11,Tue Mar 10 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"Did you ask them why they were leaving early? I've known small businesses to close up at random for unpredictable things (family emergency, building safety, holiday hours, etc etc). But usually they leave a note or something.  If anything, I would send the business an email letting them know you stopped by, but they closed early. It could just have been they wanted out early if business was slow or management told them to lock up early. A note to management would help them understand that people shop at all hours of their scheduled business hours."
yarntrolls,2yk0y1,Sm00chie,3,Tue Mar 10 13:59:20 2015 UTC,"I could tell it wasn't an emergency; the women were joking and laughing and leisurely walked down the street after locking up. There wasn't a note, there were no holiday hours posted, etc. I'm assuming it's because I live in the Middle-of-Nowhere, North Carolina and business was slow. It isn't unusual for places around here to close early, it's just frustrating having made the trip and get all excited only to watch them lock up and leave."
yarntrolls,2yk0y1,Sm00chie,7,Tue Mar 10 14:16:17 2015 UTC,"I hear you. I try to avoid any small business after 4pm, especially if they're in Nowhereville. I can usually assume some place will close early or not be open at all Sun-Wed if they're more than 30min outside a regular drive. Makes me insane when places are closed on Sundays of all days too!! It's like the ONE day where everybody has work off and the places you want to go that cater strictly to those with leisure cash ready to throw in their pockets decide to close...."
yarntrolls,2yk0y1,HappyGirl252,5,Tue Mar 10 14:50:07 2015 UTC,Right? It's ridiculous. I guess I'll have to get into the habit of calling before going anywhere. Grumblegrumble.
yarntrolls,2yk0y1,HappyGirl252,3,Tue Mar 10 15:05:46 2015 UTC,I do this too and it's paid off! One fabric store I called (because it was an hour away) to find out their store hours were different than what they had posted on their website by TWO hours.
yarntrolls,2yk0y1,DrLOV,8,Tue Mar 10 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"Not exactly crochet related, but when we were new-ish residents of our current town and our dog needed a new vet, I called the one with slightly better reviews on Google, all ready to get my dog in to be seen. I called 15 minutes before their stated ""closed lunch hour"" and the phone rang once and went to the ""I'm sorry, we've closed for lunch. Please call back at 1pm, blah blah blah.""   I ended up going to see the one with the next best reviews (which were still almost 5 stars!) and have been so happy with them. Not to mention we ended up needing dental surgery for my dog which isn't cheap, so the other vet has lost literally thousands of dollars in income for turning on their recording 15 minutes early... It might sound petty, but if my 15 minutes isn't worth it to them, then my business would certainly be welcomed somewhere else where I could actually talk to a human when I needed them.   Just thought I would commiserate - I absolutely love shopping at small businesses, but I absolutely hate when they end up wasting my time!!"
yarntrolls,2yk0y1,DrLOV,5,Tue Mar 10 14:46:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. I've heard the yarn store is amazing and I like that it's only 30 min away (the rest are an hour away), but part of me doesn't even want to bother going back now. Like you said, it feels/sounds kind of petty, but it's like... would it have killed them to stay open the remaining 45 minutes? It's not like they closed hours early, they closed FORTY FIVE minutes early. Come onnnnnn. I was going to buy stuff too, so it wouldn't have been a complete waste of their time. Siiiigh."
yarntrolls,2yk0y1,rachycarebear,6,Tue Mar 10 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"See and that's the thing. It's not like LYSs are a dime a dozen, so even if the experience is less than stellar, you either have to pony up and shop there anyway or create an actual day out of a trip to one store. I don't know about you, but a two-hour total trip time crosses from ""oh I'm going to run to my lys"" into ""I'm going to set my alarm and get up and go do this and it's actually like a trip""  territory. So you're damned if you do, damned if you don't. Ugh, I feel ya!!   If it were me (and let's keep in mind I can be a b-word about how I spend my time and money, mostly because I have little of either!!) I would probably go back and at some point during my visit mention that you tried to shop there once before and you pulled up almost an hour before stated closing and they were leaving. And then mention how you have a crafting circle where you all share good/bad experiences (hey, reddit's a circle!) and you just had to tell your circle because you were so disappointed!! Boom! Implication of word of mouth spreading about their bad practices. They know what it's like to struggle in a niche market, and if they're smart, it'll be enough to indicate they maybe shouldn't do that again. Still, what a pain though!"
yarntrolls,2yhagw,HappyGirl252,3,Mon Mar 9 20:29:48 2015 UTC,I am so bad about that. Now I end up doing my blocks color by color so I can just stay in the rhythm of one thing to focus on.

yarntrolls,2xu8n5,asocktipus,19,Tue Mar 3 22:38:55 2015 UTC,"I volunteer in a classroom in an inner city school, and a member of the community donated ~15 hand knit hats to this teacher hoping that she would find them good homes with students who needed them. By the end of the day, at least 5 kids had taken a hat and started unraveling them, cutting them, etc., and there was yarn bits everywhere. That was a few weeks ago. Most of the hats have walked off, hopefully to be used by kids who need them, but honestly that's probably not the case, the kids sort of turned them into a joke so now nobody wants to wear them. Today the teacher used one of the remaining hats to erase her chalkboard. Repetitively.   The hats are acrylic- probably stash busters- and weren't overly complex, just a double rib, so it's not like she's destroying the hats beyond repair, but still. It's heartbreaking to watch these items that someone made to keep someone warm get thrown around like nothing."
yarntrolls,2xu8n5,goldstar_femme,20,Tue Mar 3 22:40:10 2015 UTC,Kids are so cruel. But the teacher added insult to injury with her ignorance. I mean people took time out of their lives to help. (I empathize with you completely!)

But if I come across a huge stash buried in the back of the closet, now I'll know where to go to get rid of it."
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,k_princess,3,Tue Mar 3 06:06:00 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand the concept, as you may have noticed. I'm attempting to do that with high end yarns, we'll see how long I hold out."
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,NachoCupcake,2,Tue Mar 3 06:40:27 2015 UTC,My kindred spirit. :) I'm the same way! Except I don't have anyone to give little bits to at this point so I just use it for random things.
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,NachoCupcake,2,Tue Mar 3 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"I just so happen to know some Kindergarten teachers that love to have the little scraps for the kids to use during their ""active learning"" time. It's basically free time, but the kids are expected to be doing something to actively learn about how to share and be a part of a group while playing."
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,NachoCupcake,2,Tue Mar 3 17:56:16 2015 UTC,"Hooray stickies! I hope we get everyone on here to sign up! Provided they are able, of course.  I'm really hoping to get enough yarn to make something of appreciable size. There were a lot of people last year who only got one ball of yarn. It was really nice yarn and everything, but what can you make out of a $20 ball of yarn that's, like, 50g and bulky weight? I'm not hating because I know a lot of people found new yarns to fall in love with, but that's not really my preference.   I would also like to point out that those of you who are smokers might want to air out the yarn, somehow. When I got my gift last year, my Santa gave me a bunch of yarn (it was great), but it took a long time for me to air it out to the point where I could work with it. I am incredibly appreciative for what I received, but it definitely put a damper on the excitement of the gift."
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,funkydaffodil,2,Tue Mar 3 01:36:57 2015 UTC,"Put that in your dis/likes - there are some people who prefer just the opposite and your Santa has no way of knowing which type of yarnie you are.  And the smoke thing is a very good point and also applies to pets, scents, and anything else that gets into yarn. I'm going to edit the post to add that."
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,fryingpanofdoom,2,Tue Mar 3 01:52:33 2015 UTC,"I know it's a bit nuts, but I don't want to put a ton in my requests because I don't want to limit my Santa. I was pretty thorough with my likes/dislikes as far as what I feel strongly about (I think).  If I get a single ball of NORO silk, what kind of a twat would I be for complaining that I only got one ball of yarn? Also, some people can't afford to give much, like the $20 or whatever is a stretch. I'd rather leave it open-ended and just appreciate what I get.   To me, this is about the fun of the surprise and not so much what I get in the end, you know?"
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,fryingpanofdoom,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:04:37 2015 UTC,To each their own :) I tend to go on and on and give lots of details so the good Santas can easily find something that's great for me.

I was specific about things I actually care about (e.g. please no novelty yarn) but otherwise, I gave a few brands that I like at varying price points. My taste in colors is so all over the place that I'm sure whatever I end up with will fit into my stash somewhere, so that's not a huge deal to me.   I love the surprise from doing this more than any other aspect. So far, it's been an ok experience but I haven't had a really terrible Santa yet, either!"
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,half2happy,1 point,Wed Mar 4 03:01:01 2015 UTC,My FIL gave me an insane amount of acrylic for my birthday- I'm not sure if it's suitable to exchange. ('cos acrylic) Can someone advise me if it's ok to offer that up in the exchange?
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,Flyingpenguin_22,5,Tue Mar 3 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"There's no right or wrong, it's more about what your giftee wants. If your giftee is just starting out or does a lot of amigurumi, for example, acrylic might be perfect. If they do lace knitting, you'll probably have to go out and get something else for them.  In general, it's not a good idea to sign up unless you're comfortable spending at least $20 on the gift. If you can use items from stash or spin/dye so you're not spending the full $20 that's wonderful, but you shouldn't rely on it or you may end up stuck."
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,Flyingpenguin_22,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh this sounds so awesome! I am totally in!   Does the yarn have to be something I purchase specifically for this exchange, or can I send yarn from my collection if it's brand new (tags and all, of course) and happens to perfectly match the giftee's preferences?"
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,Flyingpenguin_22,3,Tue Mar 3 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"It's all about what your giftee wants. If you have something in your stash your giftee will love, you can totally send it but don't rely on that for finding a gift."

yarntrolls,2xqhc0,HappyGirl252,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:24:34 2015 UTC,I signed up! I'm excited for my first exchange! Andddd nervous since I'm a knitting noob and don't know much about the fiber types but want to get my partner something fun. My dream yarn is Madtosh. I've never used it but it just looks soooo beautiful. For some reason I really don't like working with patons classic wool. Every else seems too...but it feels so itchy! Should I be using a yarn wash?? I might be doing it wrong
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,HappyGirl252,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"Yarn was my very first exchange too! I feel like as long as you fill out your likes/dislikes to the best of your ability it should go pretty well. Be sure to say which colors you like or don't like, that could be helpful too.  You can use yarn wash, you could also use hair conditioner. Some yarns just aren't as soft so it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong."
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,HappyGirl252,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:13:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips! I've never tried conditioner but hopefully it will soften some of my FOs up :)
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,luhlala,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:01:03 2015 UTC,"If you have questions, feel free to PM me. MadTosh is absolutely incredibly gorgeous in real life. I need to find a good reason to buy it, but I keep getting distracted by other yarns. (Have you seen Zen Garden? That stuff is amazing!)  No idea about wool washes, I tend to avoid Paton's for that reason. If you haven't tried a higher end wool, it's worth noting that the difference is night and day - I always assumed I was allergic to wool because the regular stuff makes me so itchy, but I tried the nicer stuff and realized it's just a softness thing. I just got some Malabrigo and I want to snuggle with it like it's my teddy bear it's so soft."
yarntrolls,2xqhc0,half2happy,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Zen Garden...but i looked it up and it's carried by LYS nearby!! The icelandic landscape series is beautiful! Thanks for the tip. I'm still looking for the perfect project for Madtosh, but I should just bite the bullet and get some just to feel it.  I totally thought I was allergic to wool too after working with Patons (for a scarf - ugh scratchy), but that brand seems to be at least semipopular on the subreddit. Also I just started making a beret with Malabrigo worsted whales road and omg so soft and pretty. It's my first higher end wool and you're right, the difference is night and day!"

Because if you're in Northern NJ, Llama Llama Ewe in Ridgefield Park carries it (that's where I got it) and the proprietor Heather is insanely sweet and awesomely helpful, I cannot recommend her enough.  It's working up so beautifully, too."
yarntrolls,2xo6sj,NachoCupcake,4,Mon Mar 2 14:46:44 2015 UTC,"I'd love to participate in this, but would feel bad sending someone yarn from Joanns, even if it was a nicer kinds, because everyone seems to use really gourmet yarn and there are no LYS near me. Could someone comment with what they have sent or received before so i can get a better idea? I'd really hate to send someone a few $10 skeins of yarn when they were expecting something hand dyed, hand spun, etc. thanks."
yarntrolls,2xo6sj,nrocinu1234,6,Mon Mar 2 17:09:19 2015 UTC,"If someone turns their nose up at $10/skein yarn, I don't know what to tell them! The recommended amounts for exchanges is around $20. I usually spend a bit more than that but I'm certainly not going to give someone a sweater quantity of madtosh or something. Colors that the person likes in fibers that they like (or at least aren't allergic to and/or hate!), and you'll be good. The surprise is half the fun!"
yarntrolls,2xo6sj,rainbowdarling,5,Mon Mar 2 21:06:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would be thrilled with a $10 skein of anything. I can always make a quick pair of socks or mittens to gift. The more yarn the better I say. And I poo-poo anyone who states otherwise."
yarntrolls,2xo6sj,starzinhreyz,3,Mon Mar 2 22:11:35 2015 UTC,"Last year my yarn santa pretty much stashbusted on me. I got a couple of novelty yarns, some baby yarn, and then she also included some really nice yarn that she got on sale.   IIRC it's a $25 minimum, so if you can afford that, I say go for it! It's a pretty mixed bag as far as what you can get, but that's part of the fun!   As an aside, Little Knits' clearance section has a pretty amazing selection and you can get a full bag of yarn for under $25, depending on what's available. That whole site has some pretty amazing deals."

Well, my last giftee and rematch giftee didn't bother posting anything about what I sent them. Despite really trying to find something awesome and unique. AND I got someone who was a frequent poster on here, so I mega-tried.  This happened with the yarn exchange, the arbitrary exchange, and the christmas exchange.

I've done this on several pairs of my needles. It always works on my bamboos, but not as well on a pair of metals. Maybe it depends on the cable, the clear plastic on the bamboos worked better than the purple on the metal."

yarntrolls,2wl4w0,goblinish,6,Sat Feb 21 00:26:52 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, I just taught myself how to Tunisian crochet the other week, and I'm like... I've been fooled! This is knitting disguised as crochet! Started to make a scarf.... and well.... see .gif."
yarntrolls,2wl4w0,NachoCupcake,2,Sat Feb 21 01:03:44 2015 UTC,"It's funny.  I'm in the middle of making a scarf with Tunisian crochet and after failing to make any progress in knitting, this is teaching me what kind of patience I need for it.  The pace is certainly much slower."
yarntrolls,2wl4w0,myjenaissance,3,Sat Feb 21 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"I started an entrelac blanket for my bed two weeks ago and it finally covers my thighs! I just keep telling myself it's like a granny square on steroids and will all be worth it in the end! I hope ""the end"" is before next winter. Haha"
yarntrolls,2wl4w0,myjenaissance,3,Sat Feb 21 01:42:25 2015 UTC,It's funny I love doing both. Though I find if I want to zone out and just keep my hands busy without paying attention knitting is easier.
yarntrolls,2wl4w0,ObjectiveRodeo,2,Sat Feb 21 14:46:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I have to focus so much more with knitting. If I make a mistake or miss a stitch I don't know how to fix it as easily as with crochet."
yarntrolls,2wl4w0,myjenaissance,2,Sat Feb 21 19:17:59 2015 UTC,My technique for fixing errors in either is something along the lines of this.
yarntrolls,2wl4w0,ObjectiveRodeo,3,Tue Mar 3 01:50:16 2015 UTC,I've been crocheting for about 10 years and have tried three or four times to teach myself to knit. I just can't do it.  Casting on goes quickly but then it all falls into an agonizingly slow process of trying to hold one needle still while working with the other.  guh  I'm learning to live with the fact that I don't have to do learn every skill.
yarntrolls,2wl4w0,myjenaissance,3,Sat Feb 21 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"The fact that I know how to knit at all is remarkable to me because I was the same way! I watched youtube videos over, and over again, but when I tried to put it into practice I just did not understand what to do with the needles. But then one day it clicked, and I understood how to do it. But yeah, that first row...fuck that first row. That still holds me back because it's just so tedious and I refuse to knit any pattern that tells me to cast on more that 30 stitches haha.   Keep trying! I probably gave up and went back to it like 10 times before it just all of a sudden made sense."
yarntrolls,2wl4w0,GretaX,2,Sat Feb 21 19:21:09 2015 UTC,"I saw a WIP by a gal at the LYS - it was A-MAZING - which is what caused my most recent failure at knitting.  I can't remember the yarn she was using but it was striped in autumn/rust/brown shades and was a cardigan with open ""lace"" sleeves about halfway down.  GAH! It was so gorgeous.  But then she's been knitting for years and made it look easy. dammit."
yarntrolls,2wl4w0,GretaX,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"I just found this a couple of days ago but if you're still interested, you might want to take a look at Continental knitting. The movements are more crochet-like, and for me, seems more like Tunisian crochet."

yarntrolls,2wglld,FantaStrawberry,2,Thu Feb 19 21:30:49 2015 UTC,Ughhh that's the worst. I decided not to bring my crocheting to work yesterday because I thought we would be busy and I ended up having a ton of free time. It suuuuucks.
yarntrolls,2wglld,zorgtron,2,Thu Feb 19 21:44:00 2015 UTC,I hate that! Especially when I meant to bring my tote and I forgot it and all I can think about while I'm on lunch is that I could be crocheting or knitting right now.

We learn better when we move anyhow!"
yarntrolls,2wglld,crazy_cat_broad,6,Fri Feb 20 05:30:56 2015 UTC,"I certainly learn better with knitting, I pay a lot more attention (as opposed to going on my laptop) and don't get bored. I'm a library school student though, and a large number of us knit in class - so much so that one prof banned knitting in class. The rest don't seem to mind. That one class sucks though, since they just see it as disrespectful (and I can see why) but it actually does help with learning."
yarntrolls,2wfjjr,rachycarebear,17,Thu Feb 19 14:29:44 2015 UTC,That's not how this works!
yarntrolls,2wfjjr,tdorn2000,12,Thu Feb 19 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Same person ordered a pair of fingerless gloves from me. I sent her a picture of the finished product and she messaged me back ""So are you planning to add fingers?"" Your post was basically my reaction."
yarntrolls,2wfjjr,tdorn2000,7,Thu Feb 19 15:09:16 2015 UTC,Its a wonder these people can function in an artistic world. That's a double facepalm reaction right there.
yarntrolls,2wfjjr,Sweetsmyle,6,Thu Feb 19 16:41:53 2015 UTC,"I had a metals teacher in college who would get commissions for items and when asked what they wanted the item to look like they would just say, ""I don't know, just make it cool."" No dimensions, color, or idea whatsoever of what they thought was ""cool"". My teacher of course used it in class and we'd have to design items based on words we pulled out of hats. It was a fun exercise for class but the teacher describing the reactions from his clients when he did not produce the exact thing they had in mind based on their ""cool"" description made me never want to take requests."
yarntrolls,2wfjjr,infinit3j3st,5,Sat Feb 21 03:54:20 2015 UTC,"Why would you keep making her stuff?  Not judging, genuinely curious what makes you keep going back."
yarntrolls,2wfjjr,infinit3j3st,15,Thu Feb 19 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"I totally get where your question comes from! It was a bundled order - she wanted two pairs of gloves. I made the first pair while she was deciding on details for the second pair, which is when the ""why don't the fingerless gloves have fingers"" moment came up.  Then came the second pair of gloves which is where things really went annoying. She wanted expensive yarn - cashmere, silk, etc - but was hesitant to pay for it. (No, I can't make it cheaper than the supply cost. That's not how math works.) I know her in real life and I happened to have just finished an order for a pair of gloves so I told her if she wanted she could try on the gloves and check out my stash. She came, didn't love it, and kept asking if I could make samples for her. ""Sure,"" I responded cheerily, ""but I'd have to charge you for each sample.""  She went to go find patterns and somehow managed to send me a list with only about 2% crochet patterns and the rest knitting. I told her I can make any of the viable ones, she changed her mind. I sent her some pattern links, got no real usable feedback, so I told her to feel free to browse Craftsy/Etsy/etc.  This morning, she messaged me saying that maybe one day I'll decide to offer samples ""in my shop"" (you mean my kitchen?) for people to try on. That was the point at which my head exploded. I told my SO I've officially found the first customer who I will no longer be willing to work with because crochet is a hobby, not a job.  (Sorry for the rant, I'm really frustrated right now.)"
yarntrolls,2wfjjr,CatInBubbles,5,Thu Feb 19 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"Good lord, what a nightmare.  She sounds a bit prissy, to be honest.  Not even willing to pay for materials? I'd give her the boot!  Haha.  No worries about the rant, we've all been there."
yarntrolls,2wfjjr,NachoCupcake,8,Thu Feb 19 17:56:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I sort of knew she was like this going in but I didn't realize just how bad. It's good to have my fellow trolls to rant to though :)"

yarntrolls,2wfjjr,doctorfrankenskein,3,Fri Feb 20 04:38:38 2015 UTC,I am actually swamped at the moment. I was going to do it anyways because I know it can be tough to find gloves at the end of the season and it's a quick project. No good deed goes unpunished and all that.

I have to recreate a hat that I made a few months ago that was ruined by a naive boyfriend trying to be helpful.
