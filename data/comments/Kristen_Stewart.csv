Kristen_Stewart,2wfek7,azm89,2,Thu Feb 19 17:12:00 2015 UTC,I'll bet there are lots of attractive people in airports all the time. It's not normal to stalk them.
Kristen_Stewart,2wfek7,RLJL,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"It actually is normal. But that's what makes it so disappointing. That so many of our fellow humans, far more than one might presume, fall into the conformity of the shitty side to media and live by a sort of depravity with such thoughlessness that they risk losing complete control of their id, their super-ego gradually fading away. Makes you begin to lose faith in humanity a bit. But those who are mindful enough to realize this can find comfort in the thought that not all are like this. I mean I find Kristen sexy as fuck. Why else would I be here? But when I think of how these types of photos were taken, bothering another living being who most likely doesn't wanna be bothered, I kind of start to become disgusted by it all.  Pro-tip: to avoid becoming completley alone, take people a-la-carte, ie. focus on traits you do find worthwhile and syphan your time and effort you put in with those people accordingly, peacfully avoiding wasting our fleeting time with such people whom we'd like very few dishes off their cart with the phrase: ""I just don't see the world the same way you folks do"", while continually seeking out new outlets of people who share some of your creeds."

Her crazy hair is one of my favorite things about her, haha. With that being said though, this is some of the more innocuous photoshops that I've seen. At least Kristen still looks like Kristen, and not some plastic doll version. I'm glad for the few photos where they didn't touch up her body at all, just hair and wrinkles in clothes."

Kristen_Stewart,1mc9a3,Wolvenheart,7,Sat Sep 14 15:18:41 2013 UTC,But it doesn't look as though Stewart pocketed the cash herself. Instead the funds were for charity - negotiated as part of a deal for the Hurricane Sandy relief.   nice
Kristen_Stewart,1mc9a3,TVPaulD,5,Sat Sep 14 01:21:17 2013 UTC,Half a mill is probably nothing to her.  She got dat twilight money.
Kristen_Stewart,1mc9a3,not_creative1,2,Sat Sep 14 02:44:29 2013 UTC,"I like how the fact it was for charity is buried miles into the article, after several phrases implying otherwise. That's some outstanding journalism right there."
Kristen_Stewart,1mc9a3,Pengweeno,3,Sat Sep 14 15:41:29 2013 UTC,"no... he paid 500,000 to charity and she met him because she is promoting that charity!"
Kristen_Stewart,1kzg8b,thefaith1029,5,Sat Aug 24 03:15:13 2013 UTC,"You should check out Welcome to the Rileys. It is Kristen's best performance in my opinion. I'm a huge fan of hers, but I didn't think SWATH was all that spectacular."
Kristen_Stewart,1kzg8b,mollieflynn,2,Sat Aug 24 17:36:52 2013 UTC,"Yeah she's really good in that one. Also, Speak, Adventureland, The Cake Eaters and The Yellow Handkerchief."
Kristen_Stewart,1kzg8b,partialinsanity,2,Thu Aug 29 18:44:47 2013 UTC,"Love all of those, except I haven't watched Speak yet though."
Kristen_Stewart,1kzg8b,mollieflynn,2,Thu Aug 29 23:01:28 2013 UTC,"She was amazing in Welcome to the Rileys, she really was.  The only thing that lets that film down is its ending, didn't really care for that."
Kristen_Stewart,1kzg8b,azm89,8,Thu Sep 5 16:54:51 2013 UTC,That's because she is a great actress. When anyone says otherwise I assume they are making the mistake of judging her by the Twilight series alone.
Kristen_Stewart,1kzg8b,naive_person,9,Sat Aug 24 05:02:33 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you there. I read the twilight books and watched the movies, and what I think is that people think Kristen Stewart sucks at acting and is completely emotionless is because of the character she played, Bella. Bella wasn't a very interesting and was quite bland of a character. She was pretty boring.   But Kristen happened to nail that role in my opinion. Achieved that 'lost' and 'confused' feeling."
Kristen_Stewart,1kzg8b,Holybasil,4,Sat Aug 24 15:27:56 2013 UTC,That's kind of funny because I feel that was one of her weaker roles. Or perhaps it's just the writing that was poor.
Kristen_Stewart,1kzg8b,Pengweeno,-5,Sat Aug 24 15:11:07 2013 UTC,No.
Kristen_Stewart,1kzg8b,alittletroll,-11,Sat Aug 24 19:39:13 2013 UTC,I figured because she had a second source to provide a moist cream for the face.
Kristen_Stewart,1k6imh,sickboy_94,4,Mon Aug 12 02:19:47 2013 UTC,Oh...my...glob....

Kristen_Stewart,1hp1rd,StrngBrew,5,Fri Jul 5 15:47:41 2013 UTC,Why is she staring longingly at that dude's creepy frog eye?
Kristen_Stewart,1hoaw2,SambaLando,2,Fri Jul 5 04:42:24 2013 UTC,Didn't realize Dakota was that tall.
Kristen_Stewart,1hoaw2,partialinsanity,2,Mon Jul 8 20:46:37 2013 UTC,I would like to think she's sitting in Kristen's lap.
Kristen_Stewart,1hmwjc,AFalk,5,Thu Jul 4 14:56:04 2013 UTC,"Not a huge fan of that hair style on Kristen and my word, the Granny panty look is just wretched.... had the bottoms had regular cut panties or something similar it would have looked immensely better IMO. She's still bloody gorgeous!!"
Kristen_Stewart,1hmwjc,itsme242,1 point,Thu Jul 4 17:07:36 2013 UTC,DAM girl you H O T HOT
Kristen_Stewart,1hi0cd,StrngBrew,2,Tue Jul 2 15:02:29 2013 UTC,she looks...uncomfortable
Kristen_Stewart,1hghk2,GeneralEttan,22,Mon Jul 1 22:44:59 2013 UTC,"I can't stand that ridiculous ""joke"" about her smiling, she's got a great smile and always has."
Kristen_Stewart,1hghk2,xion_the_unborn,9,Mon Jul 1 22:50:47 2013 UTC,Thank you for proving that she has one of the most beautiful slimes in Hollywood
Kristen_Stewart,1hghk2,itsme242,6,Tue Jul 2 01:46:50 2013 UTC,I think you mean smile unless she is an avid minecraft player and has a pet slime!
Kristen_Stewart,1hghk2,jurassic_blue,5,Tue Jul 2 07:57:32 2013 UTC,She is such a smoke. Love when she smiles
Kristen_Stewart,1hghk2,TVPaulD,5,Tue Jul 2 00:30:34 2013 UTC,"One of the things I like about her is that she ""looks like someone I know"" but I can't quite figure out who. That's the kind of genuineness she emits."
Kristen_Stewart,1hghk2,MC_Carty,5,Tue Jul 2 07:52:02 2013 UTC,"She has like the prettiest smile. It's so infectious, it just makes you happy :)"
