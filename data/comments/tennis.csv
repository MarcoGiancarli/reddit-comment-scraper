Should it be?) She says she does no weight training. “I can’t handle lifting more than five pounds. It’s just annoying, and it’s just too much hard work. And for my sport, I just feel like it’s unnecessary.” Yet she’s been beaten 17 times in a row by someone who has added that muscle necessary to excel.

tennis,3e2ekl,halfbrit08,4,Tue Jul 21 18:53:06 2015 UTC,"The curious part is the flip side isn't true.  Male tennis players don't really seem particularly masculine.  We can look at players like McEnroe, etc. For many years, muscles were considered a disadvantage in tennis (for incorrect reasons, it seems).  These days, there's more weight training, but some players are happy not having huge muscles (Simon, Federer, Djokovic) at least in the upper body.  So there's pressure for women athletes to look a certain way, but not as much for male athletes."

People have said Nadal only worked on his biceps (thus, the triceps, which are bigger) are not as big as they should be given his biceps.

tennis,3e2ekl,AGrimGrim,11,Tue Jul 21 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"There's a difficulty in changing attitudes.  One article won't be enough to do it.    Kareem is basically saying women athletes should be allowed to excel as athletes, and not be put down if they don't fit a feminine ideal, and that women athletes are essentially balancing their desire to be successful with their desire to achieve this feminine ideal which they wouldn't have to do if they considered a more athletic build socially acceptable."
tennis,3e2ekl,dropshot,5,Tue Jul 21 15:25:04 2015 UTC,"Except that pointing to Serena and assuming that if Sharapova, Henin, Mauresmo etc. hadn't been ""bowing to male pressure"" or whatever they'd be more successful, is really really unfair. It doesn't take much strength to be able to play tennis it's athleticism, speed and endurance which play a much much bigger role. It's a big jump to say ""Serena is super dominant right now, and there are women on the tour who don't look like Serena, so they must be training for show rather than for performance"".   Serena is much more of an outlier than a new rule, for sure it's a shame that the pressure exists but it's really hard to make an argument that the women's tour only looks like it does because of the pressures of the male gaze when male tennis players are just as skinny by and large."
tennis,3e2ekl,Ksanti,4,Tue Jul 21 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"Most people are referring to the NY Times article: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/sports/tennis/tenniss-top-women-balance-body-image-with-quest-for-success.html?_r=0  There are quotes like from Andrea Petkovic:   “I just feel unfeminine,” she said. “I don’t know — it’s probably that I’m self-conscious about what people might say. It’s stupid, but it’s insecurities that every woman has, I think. I definitely have them and I’m not ashamed to admit it. I would love to be a confident player that is proud of her body. Women, when we grow up we’ve been judged more, our physicality is judged more, and it makes us self-conscious.”   It's true it's unclear whether weight training would be advantageous or not, but it seems women are avoiding it for reasons that have more to do with being scared of developing muscles (which, incidentally, women do far less readily than men) or whether they think weight training is negative for their tennis for other reasons.  James Cameron, interestingly enough, has liked tough women in his films (see Terminator 2, Aliens, or Avatar).  The films have been popular, but maybe not enough to sway popular opinion."

tennis,3e2ekl,TenNes,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:20 2015 UTC,"That's the point Kareem seems to be making.  He wants more men to like fit women, but it's hard to sway people's opinions.  Is advertising trying to portray ideal women and that's what people buy into?  Or do they sense this is what people think of as ideal women, and that's what they provide?"
tennis,3e2ekl,dropshot,2,Tue Jul 21 18:04:11 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the thing. I think when you're dealing with marketable material, certain things are more marketable not because they are more appealing on average, but rather, because the types of people who find that particular type of marketable material are also the people who respond better to the marketing.   For instance the fake tan big fake boob blonde archetype that seems to be the marketing symbol of everything is not actually the most desirable on average, however for people that will respond to marketing based on looks respond well to that.   People that are heavily into a certain product or material will always want to see more and more exaggerated forms, whether the thing is cars, watches, or for people that view women as material objects. Those are who you are marketing to if that's how you market, so you aren't trying to find the desire of the average population, but rather that of the group most likely to respond to the marketing."

tennis,3e2ekl,cuddlefish,4,Tue Jul 21 18:23:55 2015 UTC,Except that to use Serena as an example of that you have to make an assumption that Serena's body type is ideal for tennis - you look at the history of the women's game AND the history of the men's game in terms of the body composition of the most successful players and it becomes pretty clear that Serena is an anomaly rather than just some woman who was brave enough to build for performance.

tennis,3e2ekl,MetalKeirSolid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"The theme I see in so many of these articles is that when women try to improve themselves, due to some sort of pressure, they are somehow a victim. Its as if all women should just feel beautiful and have no pressure to improve. Rather than suggesting that less attractive women can become more attractive by using humor or intelligence, these articles try to remove any insecurity in women and thus any impetus to improve by saying that beauty is made up or everyone is beautiful. The way this author implies that Sharapova is successful over Serena just because of looks is a perfect example of the idle behavior the author is encouraging.  We don't treat men this way. We don't say, ""oh you should just feel good for being you"". Instead we expect them to do things in order to feel more worthy. This leads to a lot of success and a lot of turmoil for men. Maybe men deserve more sympathy but at the same time its pretty obvious the whole ""every woman is beautiful"" is nonsense meant to take away any insecurity or feeling of deficiency which totally stunts personal growth and achievement.  The worst part of the article is that it operates under the notion that if women are unhappy it is society that should change, rather than leaving women's happiness in their own hands."
tennis,3e2ekl,machidaad,-9,Tue Jul 21 21:17:50 2015 UTC,"The media need to stop beating a dead horse and bringing this issue up every time Serena wins a tournament. Some women (Sharapova, Ivanovic, Kournikova) are conventionally attractive and due to this are easy to market (appeal more to the general public). Serena is conventionally unattractive (not particularly ugly but definitely no model) and has the body of a man (deny this all you want but shes built like a brick shithouse). And this is okay, she is after all one of the greatest female tennis players of all time. Is it unfair that she makes less money than worse players who are prettier than her? Sure, in the same way its unfair how Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks are multi-millionaires because they won the genetic lottery whilst other women are doomed to a life of mediocrity.

tennis,3e2ekl,supremesuperextra,-5,Tue Jul 21 16:11:14 2015 UTC,No. It makes Dudi Sela a man built like a man. Average out the weight of pro women tennis players at a similar height and their weight will be well below Serena's.

tennis,3e3k9e,RafaIsAGoat,9,Tue Jul 21 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"Basically, Hewitt peaked early during a time when there was no strong champ.  Sampras was starting to finish his career, and Agassi was still winning some Slams when Sampras was no longer contending.  Hewitt, Nalbandian, Haas, Federer, Roddick, Safin, Ferrero were all trying to compete for the top spot.  Nearly all of them except Roddick, Federer, and Ferrer had injury issues, esp. Hewitt and Haas, and so they were never able to get back to the top, though they would play well from time to time when they were healthy.  The number 1 players bounced around quite a bit.  Hewitt was number 1.  So was Roddick, Safin, Kuerten, Agassi, Rios, Moya, and Kafelnikov.  There were 7 players that were number 1 for some time between 1998 and 2000.  Then, Federer and Nadal traded number 1.  When Djokovic became number 1 in 2011, he traded off between Federer and Nadal before regaining number 1.  So, Hewitt may have benefited from a period of time where there was not a clear dominant player while Murray was hurt by playing in an era with 3 dominant players.  My sense is Murray has had the better career.  I think a third Slam would certainly make that more true.  Hewitt was, alas, hurt by injuries that never let him play as well as he could have.  Hewitt did have a more old-school style of play, a more aggressive Chang-like player.   Murray, by contrast, began to move up the ranks when Federer and Nadal were dominating, and Djokovic was on his way up.  Djokovic's ability on clay always kept him ahead of Murray."
tennis,3e3k9e,dropshot,7,Tue Jul 21 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"I know it's anecdotal, but an 18 year old Murray beat a 26 year old Hewitt in their only game against one another."

tennis,3e3k9e,dropshot,2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:33 2015 UTC,I think Murray is a better player. I see him as a more athletic version of Hewitt. In terms of career accomplishments I think it's close. A few things separate them. Murray has 17 semi-finals appearances to Hewitt's 8. Murray has 8 finals appearances to Hewitt's 4. A gold medal. Got to the French Open semifinal three times to Hewitt's two QFs. And he came up as the fourth duckling of the big four era.

tennis,3e3z97,TennisSomething,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:37 2015 UTC,If you're hoping to see Fed I strongly doubt he'll play outside of Arthur Ashe even in the early rounds. I can't see him getting bumped to Louis Armstrong because the only players more popular  than him are Serena and Novak (sorta). The grounds pass covers everything but Arthur Ashe so that'll be a no go.   The week before the tournament all the players are there and practice in the courts around the grounds. If you want to see Fed you can go during one of those days and try to catch him. The USTA posts player practice schedules on their site. It's free to attend.  For OP: best bang for buck is the first few days. Grounds pass is pretty great.

tennis,3e24wx,t4liff,2,Tue Jul 21 12:23:38 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest I can't see Simona ever beating Serena on a good day (I think the group stage in Singapore last year was a fluke). Maybe in like 5 years, but by then she's going to retire. Serena is just amazing."
tennis,3e24wx,tb-talex,2,Tue Jul 21 13:03:57 2015 UTC,"If she can keep to her form from earlier on this year, she can win a Grand Slam within two years. If Serena has a dip in form, Simona can be, and will have to be, there to capitalize."
tennis,3e24wx,ishgever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:43 2015 UTC,"This might hurt, but it's my opinion...please don't hate me :-)  To be honest, I think that at the moment, she is overrated. People are desperate for a challenger to Serena (and Maria/Vika to an extent too) and have decided that that's going to be Simona. The fact that she's smaller and more ""sweet"" and ""innocent"" looking makes her a sweetheart to a lot of people, especially when compared with some of the bigger and more brash up-and-comers. The fact that she has a pretty nice and smooth game helps too.   But really, she isn't a champion...yet. I'm not saying that she won't ever be, but she's missing several key characteristics. She's not mentally tough at all - there've been several important matches where she's been absolutely pathetic, and then makes statements like ""that's the last match in my whole career where I don't try to fight""...and then does it again. Her serve is pretty good for her size, but she's not aggressive enough on returns to compensate for it. I don't think she's really got that extra something that champions have.   Like I said, she might surprise us all and mature into an amazing player. But for now, she's not there yet. I think the sooner people stop obsessing over her being the next best thing, the better.   I do like her, and I would be happy if she took over when Serena retires. I like her game and personality more than some of the other girls'. But she would need some major luck to get to #1 at this point."
tennis,3e24wx,Sebastien447,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:19 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. She's had some incredible matches, and sometimes makes it look like no one could beat her, but her level of play hasn't been constant. And when the odds are stacked against her in a match, that's usually it, there's no turning back (that's why it was VERY surprising to see her win the Indian Wells final against Jankovic after losing the first set and serving at 2-5 in the second one). But she's still pretty young, and I guess mental strength comes with experience more than anything, so I do hope she'll one day be the next big thing. Serena is a class above everyone else right now, but when she retires there's going to be a hell of a battle for that no. 1 spot, and I think by then Halep's going to be more of a fighter than she is now.    But she would need some major luck to get to #1 at this point.   Yeah, no kidding! I don't see any way Serena could lose the #1 position right now. Not to mention if she did, Sharapova, Kvitova and even Suarrez-Navarro (who beat Halep in Germany a couple of months back) have all been playing a lot better than Simona, so they would be the favorites."

tennis,3e2j32,I_Know_KungFu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:21 2015 UTC,"I played in west Texas for 13 years; a normal day is 15 mph, and s normal spring day is 25 mph. It was something we grew up with and learned as we got better. If you live somewhere where wind isn't normal, it's going to be hard to get better playing in it when you don't have constant exposure to the conditions.   Once we got to the high school level our coach told us to embrace it, particularly when playing schools from south or east Texas where wind isn't nearly as common. We knew what we could get away with and what wouldn't work whereas our opponents struggled the entire match.   My advice is look at it like a round of golf, if you play that. Figure out what you've got working for you that particular day, and wear it out. Save the changes for practice days (the driving range) and give yourself the best chance of winning, even if it ain't pretty."

tennis,3e2j32,nissansilviafan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"My high school was in a valley which usually made for windy days and I played for a smaller college in the midwest where it was usually as windy.  Footwork is generally the biggest issue for people because you have to make even more small adjustments than normal before planting yourself for the stroke. Normally, you take large strides to get near the ball and then take smaller steps once you approach the ball. However, the wind will force you to make more adjustments than you are used to as it moves and taking that extra step so late will throw off your timing. But if you don't move, you will have to reach for the ball, or jam yourself just enough that it could mess up your hit.  So to get in the right position, gauge which direction the wind is blowing with a hand towel, blade of grass, etc. If you know the wind is blowing to your right and the ball is hit to your right, then the ball will go out wider than normal so you know to move a little closer to the ball than you normally would. With the same wind but a ball hit to your left, you know it will move towards you some so you should give yourself a little more room than normal. Basically, hit the ball where it's going to be, not where it is. And with over 20 years of playing, it is gonna be weird to feel out of position on your strokes. But the more you play in the wind, it easier it will be to make those adjustments.  The last thing is your mindset. I've seen some good college players crumble because they said that they couldn't play in the wind even if they were the better player. So it's important to have a positive mindset. If you can convince yourself that you know that you can hit the shot, that you are GOING to hit that shot, it will be easier for you to do so.  Hope that helps some."
tennis,3e2j32,GATSBYH20,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"I hate practicing in the wind but I actually enjoyed playing in the wind. I have pretty ""handy"" strokes. Meaning, I can use my hands and wrists to improvise a lot, which has its pros and cons. Like my forehand can be off on any given day. But in the wind, since I'm used to mixing up flat and spinny strokes, if it's not a side wind, it's not an issue. I just hit flatter on one side and then I really take off pace and hit lots of spin from the other. The most important thing is to not fixate on the wind if it bothers you. You can almost lose the match before it starts if you just choose to believe you are doomed, the wind has all but ensured your defeat. Make it about the process, see it as a fun challenge, and acknowledge that when it's behind you, it's actually a benefit in terms of added power."
tennis,3e2j32,walkwithoutme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:00 2015 UTC,"When you are hitting with The Wind..  Baseline: Don't take risks.. use controlled somewhat loopy top spin (should give the opponent a lot of trouble) and wait for the short ball to put it away. If the opponent starts to back away use a flatter drop shot, it is actually easier to hit with the wind and pretty effective.  At the net: Wait for the ball as it will loose momentum and let it bounce if you have too.  Opponent at the net: Slice lob aimed to drop mid court are best.  When hitting against the wind:  Baseline: You want to hit the ball hard with some top spin and hurry your opponent into hitting it long. Put some height and juice on the drop shots.  At the net: Expect the ball to come quicker and carry higher.  Opponent at the net: Top Spins lobs aimed 3 feet long are the best."

tennis,3e04l5,TheCrazyRed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:37:56 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on if you your fence have wind blocks or not if you want to gerry-rig something. Selfie sticks for phones don't cost so much ($10-$15). If i was to do this on a budget, i would get something similar, put it against the fence vertically and use something like bungee cord with plastic hooks on the end and wrap it all the way up the pole against the fence making sure it is secure and won't tip over and just hook it a couple of spots away to keep tension on the bungee. A little more work then zip ties but atleast you don't have to cut them off and keep rebuying new ones. Also it will give you some extra adjustable height without you actually having to set it up high on the fence.  Side Rant: How are the players in the video 4.5? Even at an area without a big tennis scene..this has to be max 4.0..but that's being generous (especially for john)...also the video stops before the tiebreaker..."
tennis,3e04l5,dubsdaazn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:13 2015 UTC,"The most affordable stuff is usually the most obvious stuff.  Something ghetto, like taping it or, as /u/mathen said, zip tying it should work just fine.  I'd say string would probably be your best bet.  If all else fails, set up a ball hopper behing yourself on the fence and put your phone on top of it, I've done that and I can say that your phone only needs to be about 3-4 feet off the ground to give you a decent angle for tennis.  Maybe go really ghetto and stack some boxes near the fence.  Just make sure, above all else, that your phone is fully charged and RECORDING when you put it up there."

She blasts even the best players off the court on her good days and still wins on an average day. There will never be a strength/power gap like this in men's tennis. To see another player like her we'll probably have to hope she inspires some super athletic girls to play tennis over say basketball, track and field, or something. She's just a stud.

Obviously there are a lot of matches that don't fit that mold, for example Watson vs. Williams at Wimbledon, and when they happen they are just as exciting as the mens' matches, and arguably draw as much interest from this sub. Unfortunately, for the time being, men's tennis is just more interesting because the current players are more interesting as competitors.

tennis,3e039k,WakeVajZet,0,Tue Jul 21 13:36:49 2015 UTC,not really giving money to charities is equally as void as giving it to politicians it just looks better. The best thing to do is set up your own schools/hospitals and either you or a team you trust over sees the whole process of where the money goes and what it's accomplishing.

tennis,3e039k,reedsparks,3,Mon Jul 20 23:14:49 2015 UTC,Ferrer? Why?
tennis,3e039k,vedderer,9,Tue Jul 21 00:33:51 2015 UTC,"he was involved with Fuentes, that Spanish doctor that was associated with doping & Lance Armstrong (also Sara Errani went to him too)."
tennis,3e039k,Some_Ball,5,Tue Jul 21 00:48:37 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of tennis players who had their face saved thanks to the Spanish Supreme court's decision to destroy the blood transfusion bags relating to Operation Puerto and Dr. Fuentes. Of the hundreds of bags the authorities found, the majority were blood bags of famous tennis and soccer players. However, only the names of the cyclists who had blood bags found there were ever released. The names of the tennis and soccer players who had bags found there were never made public."
tennis,3e039k,MakeshiftLeftBack,2,Tue Jul 21 10:34:57 2015 UTC,"What?!  So we know that there is evidence that several tennis players have used PED's we just don't know who?!  Awe, man!"
tennis,3e039k,vedderer,2,Tue Jul 21 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"It goes deeper than that. It was suspected that some of the blood bags found in Fuentes' Lab may have related to soccer players from Spanish World Cup winning team from 2010. There definitely were soccer and tennis players who blood doped with the aid of Fuentes, but the Spanish Supreme Court's decision to destroy all the evidence was cowardly, and in my opinion, only done to hide that some of Spanish sport's biggest names were implicated in a doping scandal.   Could you imagine if it came to light that Nadal, or some of Spain's World Cup winning team doped? The entire sporting world would have been rocked to it's core, and Spanish athletes all over the world (even if they were clean) would instantly be dismissed as cheaters.   In my mind there's no other plausible reason why the Spanish Supreme Court ordered the blood bags destroyed, I mean, why else destroy the evidence?"
tennis,3e039k,MakeshiftLeftBack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  It's super frustrating to hear that.  I agree though,... definitely tough to think of another reason why they would destroy the evidence..."
tennis,3e039k,vedderer,4,Tue Jul 21 17:07:57 2015 UTC,"Also his career just makes no sense.  He's 5'9"", barely played juniors, and look at him at the bottom of this list in the Not Yet 23 age group in 2003 ... certainly not bad, but he was just another guy even in just the 21-22yo crowd at the time.  For him to break through to 7 Masters Finals, 5 Slam SFs and a Slam Final during the Big 4 era as 29yo 5'9"" guy is insane.  As for other guys his height: Nishikori was a top-10 junior as a 16yo, ATP title winner at age 17, top-100 at age 18, a prodigy all the way who still has made it to a Slam SF just once in his career.  Berankis was the world #1 junior, top-100 at age 20, can hit his serve 140+, and yet he's topped out at the #67 ranking.  It's easy to say that Ferrer has a lot of grit and works really hard, but I think it's hard to just outwork guys at this level, especially by that much."

tennis,3e039k,vedderer,7,Tue Jul 21 10:34:02 2015 UTC,What i found suspicious was that 2012 australian open tournament. djokovic plays a 5 hour semifinal with andy murray and proceeds to win the final in 6 hours after only a day of rest. Andy murray said he could hardly walk 2 days later.
tennis,3e039k,bumbleb333,2,Tue Jul 21 12:18:14 2015 UTC,"I'd hate to accuse anyone of that and I don't want to put you in the position of accusing someone of that either.  That being said, what do you think?!"
tennis,3e039k,vedderer,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"Look, we used to like to believe that sports are pure. I think for people in the know, american football is full of it, baseball was until Congress had to get involved, we know lots of Spanish players were, and the kicker is that plenty of people who never tested positive were later found out through other means, like Lance.   Here is the thing, if you're not doped, you're not going to beat people who are. The doctors that produce the designer doping agents and masks are far ahead of the game compared to the regulators because obviously there's more money going into the research to pass the tests. Lance was tested what, thousands of times? Not a single positive.  If you think any of the top tennis players aren't doping, you are naive. That said, if everyone is doing it, it's a fair playing field."

Or did you word it that way for a specific reason?    I guess I'd be naive to think that there weren't at least a couple of top players (i.e. top 100) doping, but I'm not sure how prevalent it is."
tennis,3e039k,vedderer,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah thanks that's what I meant. I would actually think it would be the majority, and they may not even know it themselves."

When we see a player like, say, Kyrgios who upsets Nadal and makes it to the quarterfinals of Wimbledon, we put a lot of praise on him, and expect him to do well.  These become our expectations.  We think he has talent.  We think he should go far.  If he fizzles, it's a disappointment, but who put those expectations on him?  We did.  We said he was talented, and said he had to go far.  However, it's easy to mistake our disappointment with the player being something of a failure."

That was a fortunate win because he was a lucky loser.  He has to be one of the few lucky losers to ever win a tournament.  I watched the third set of Ram vs. Karlovic.  I think one reason Karlovic is sometimes more successful against players ranked higher than Ram is because they stay at the baseline while Ram comes to net.  Being able to put away a volley seems to put Karlovic at a disadvantage.  The third set was pretty much like old school grass play with both servers not having a great deal of trouble holding serve.  Ram ultimately won by hitting two good returns.  One, he sliced a backhand return near the sideline.  The other, he bunted to the middle of the court and Karlovic tried to half-volley (unsuccessfully).  With those two points, Ram got ahead and held to win the match.  I had thought Karlovic would return better, but Ram does have a pretty good serve."

Typically the majority of the spaces reserved for ranked players and former winners, but spots for anyone to get hot and make a run exist.  The alternative would be an invitational (closed sounds bad) where some selection committee behind closed doors would sort out who could play.  By this definition Wimbledon would not be an open because they seed players ranked in tour and have 8 wild cards which are given by a committee.  I am sure they give them on merit but it is not like the US Open where you could go to a play in tourney, win the whole thing and earn a spot in the actual US Open.  Which I think now starts a little early to sort out the play in winners, sort of a mini tournament for them."

tennis,3dy9p4,JonEverhart,6,Mon Jul 20 14:58:54 2015 UTC,His greatest stength is also too much to handle for many other players. With the exception of Madrid this year Nadal has always dominated Murray even on grass. If you want to look at a complete player maybe Federer edges out a bit but both have strengths that are GOAT like Feds aggresiveness  and footwork or Nadal's ability to fget to any ball and determination.  its like comparing their forehands. both are GOAT in their own respect. But then again anything even mentioning Nadal even coming somewhat close to Federer is sacrilege in r/tennis.

He is simply refuting it. Its like saying Roddick should have beat him in 2009 or Djokovic should have beat Nadal in 2013 French Open, no they shouldn't have since they lost and they lost since they played worse at one point or another."
tennis,3dy9p4,PokeMyPillow,8,Mon Jul 20 17:16:07 2015 UTC,"If you want to be fair about it, you have to look at their careers instead of just their head to head.  It's an indisputable fact that Nadal has a favorable matchup against Roger on clay and slow hard court.  He does not have as successful of a hard court and grass court career.  He also has fewer weeks at world number 1 than Djokovic who himself is nearly 150 weeks behind Roger.  Outside of the French Open, the second most number of titles he has at a major is 2.  For Roger, outside of his Wimbledons, his next most is 5 US Opens followed by 4 Australian Opens.  Nadal also has never won a WTF while Roger has 6."
tennis,3dy9p4,avaliantheel,3,Mon Jul 20 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"I think this is for the most part a bit subjective, with the only objective stat being their head to head.  The easy answer is that Federer is the more accomplished player, but it can get a little hazy with saying Federer is the better player.   There a lot of arguments that could go both ways. To be sure, Nadal's forehand is the bane of Federer's existence, though."

tennis,3dy9p4,DRUNKTENNIS,4,Mon Jul 20 15:25:59 2015 UTC,That's not a good bet. Nadal is a lot more likely to lose earlier in the tournament than Fed. Even during his peak in 08-11 he was losing in the fourth round or quarters to guys who he was better than. Also Federer has a higher winning percentage in every Slam not played on clay.

What, is Mark Philippousis a better slow HC player than Pete Sampras because he's 1-0 against him at the AO? How about Richard Krajicek on grass vs. Sampras? He leads the H2H, after all.  Or Marat Safin vs. Djokovic. Who is better? Safin, clearly, at both the AO and Wimbledon, since he leads the H2H.   And as far as a tournament is concerned - a tournament is not two players. If there was a ""GOAT"" tournament with a bunch of great players, Nadal is getting ousted from the AO, guaranteed. Just as he did vs. Gonzalez, Tsonga, Murray, Ferrer, Djokovic, Wawrinka, and Berdych. He can't play Federer every match in said tournament. You'd be utterly insane to bet on Nadal in the AO tournament if the likes of Djokovic, Agassi, et. al. are invited."

This isn't boxing, they don't say hey we are gonna play each other in three months, let's get ready and see who wins.   The players clearly have much different ways of going about prep for the season, and really for a career. Federer prepped for longevity, Nadal prepped for peak performances. Federer had consistently performed better, for longer than Nadal."
tennis,3dy9p4,TenNes,3,Tue Jul 21 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no. Long answer: Nadal is obviously superior to Fed on clay. However Federer is pretty much the better player on all other surfaces (GS count backs this up: 16 all other surfaces for Fed, 6 for Nadal). Granted, Rafa sort of 'dethroned' him, but he was still ranked no.1 player in the world for twice as long as Nadal was.  In addition to that, these past few years, Federer hasn't been winning as many GS as Nadal (if none at all), but he's been the most consistent player (stable top 5 since early 2014 ?)."

tennis,3dy9p4,jeffwingersballs,2,Mon Jul 20 22:36:49 2015 UTC,roger sure has improved his game from 2011 until now..
tennis,3dy9p4,audun0905,2,Tue Jul 21 00:12:45 2015 UTC,The big four era starts in 2011 for you?
tennis,3dy9p4,jeffwingersballs,2,Tue Jul 21 00:13:51 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to describe how head-to-head records might not always be a good indicator of who the overall better player is.  Plus, bear in mind that Federer is about to turn 34.  That should be taken into account in his record against the other players in the big four.  Hewitt, Nalbandian, Blake, Daveydenko, Roddick, Safin,... those were his contemporaries."
tennis,3dy9p4,vedderer,2,Mon Jul 20 19:27:15 2015 UTC,"I agree to an extent. I'll give Federer a pass for his most recent loss to Nadal at the Australian Open, but not give him a pass for losing the 2008 Wimbledon or any French Open final."
tennis,3dy9p4,jeffwingersballs,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"Not anymore, but he was for a time when Nadal was zoning and Federer was suffering from a drop in form"
tennis,3dy9p4,shittylob,2,Mon Jul 20 14:59:36 2015 UTC,"This is a vague question, at best.  You have to define ""better"".  To leave it open like this, you can answer either way.  In some criteria, Nadal is a better player, and in some ways he's not.  The biggest thing in Nadal's favor is his head-to-head record against Federer.  However, if you compare accomplishments, Federer is ahead there (mostly)."
tennis,3dy9p4,dropshot,2,Mon Jul 20 14:59:49 2015 UTC,"I give a slight edge to Nadal, but it's close.  In terms of surfaces, it breaks down like this:   Clay courts: Nadal, 13–2 Outdoor hardcourt: Nadal, 8–2 Indoor hardcourt: Federer, 4–1 Grass: Federer, 2-1   The total tally is 23-10 in favour of Nadal and this stat, can be a little deceiving and needs some context, but even with adjustments, the best Nadal has to offer edges out Federer.   Things we can learn from their head to head. For one, the faster the court, the more the edge goes the Federer, but the further the rallys can be spread out, the more the edge goes to Nadal.   I'm terms of accumulating over the course of their career, Federer has more major titles and WTF titles (6) to Nadal's 0 which is a huge hole in his resume. The WTF finals is played on a fast, indoor hardcourt.   Nadal has the most masters titles in history and dethroned Federer's run at Wimbledon. Something Federer can never claim about Nadal at Roland Garros. He also has a gold medal to Federer's silver.  There are also some other factors to consider. When Nadal was at his peak, Federer was getting older. Too old to excuse him? I can certainly excuse him for his age by losing to Djokovic at this year's Wimbledon, but he was 26 in 2008 and that's comfortably in the prime years of a tennis player.  Another angle to consider is when Federer has accumulating most of his majors. Look at some of his opponents in his first 10 grand slam championships.    2003 Wimbledon - Mark Philippoussis 2004 Aust. Open - Marat Safin 2004 Wimbledon - Andy Roddick 2004 U.S. Open - Lleyton Hewitt 2005 Wimbledon - Andy Roddick 2005 U.S. Open - Andre Aggasi (age 35) 2006 Australian Open - Marcos Baghdatis 2006 Wimbledon Rafael Nadal (age 19) 2006 U.S. Open Andy Roddick 2007 Australian Open - Fernando González   I personally consider this a weak era compared to what Nadal came up in. Not to say Nadal never had to face any weak opponents in a final, most notably his first French Open title when Federer was not yet his best on clay, but Federer at his peak (winning three majors a year) didn't have someone like Djokovic going into god mode in the middle of his prime(2011).   Another angle I think that is worth considering, especially if you are putting weight on total majors is that Nadal has had injuries that has seen him miss chunks of time or bow out early in majors and this prevents him accumulating like Federer did. Part of why this occurs is that when Nadal is on the court, he is willing to put everything out there, but when his legs are fresh, he is more focused and driven and puts on a display of tennis that is the best this sport has seen. He keeps fighting and doesn't make unforced errors and when he's down in a match. Psychologically he digs deep and never loses heart. This is how he can beat Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon. I think this is also why he has the highest winning percentage against the rest of the big four than any other member of the big four."
tennis,3dy9p4,jeffwingersballs,3,Mon Jul 20 18:23:35 2015 UTC,Look at who Nadal lost to at the non clay majors during that time between 2004-2009. It wasn't a string of future hall of famers if I remember rightly.
tennis,3dy9p4,TacticalTennis,3,Mon Jul 20 22:13:33 2015 UTC,"So from 2004-2009 Nadal was 18-23. Here's who he lost to in that period: 2004 Australian Open: Hewitt 2004 US Open: Roddick 2005 Australian Open: Hewitt 2005 Wimbledon: Muller 2005 US Open: Blake 2006 Wimbledon: Federer 2006 US Open: Youzhny 2007 Australian Open: Gonzalez 2007 Wimbledon: Federer 2007 US Open: Ferrer 2008 Australian Open: Tsonga 2008 US Open: Murray 2009 French Open: Soderling 2009 US Open: Del Potro  For Federer's equivalent period (18-23), here are his losses from 1999-2003: 1999 French Open: Rafter 1999 Wimbledon: Jiri Novak 2000 Australian Open: Clement 2000 French Open: Clement 2000 Wimbledon: Kafelnikov 2000 US Open: Ferrero 2001 Australian Open: Clement 2001 French Open: Corretja 2001 Wimbledon: Henman 2001 US Open: Agassi 2002 Australian Open: Haas 2002 French Open: Arazi 2002 Wimbledon: Ancic 2002 US Open: Mirnyi 2003 Australian Open: Nalbandian 2003 French Open: Horna 2003 US Open: Nalbandian  Seems pretty even to me. Nadal lost to a grand slam winner in seven out of his 14 losses, and Federer lost to a grand slam winner in five out of his 17 losses."
tennis,3dy9p4,beavertennis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:21 2015 UTC,"You're not really comparing equivalent eras of their careers though, just equivalent ages. Look at the losses they each had after winning their first Grand Slam."
tennis,3dy9p4,TacticalTennis,0,Tue Jul 21 02:11:51 2015 UTC,"Except Nadal was fully developed at 19. He was more muscular than he has been in recent years, faster, his forehand was every bit as good, and he was every bit as one-dimensional as he is now. He reached #2 in the world and won 2 of his very few non-clay masters series titles in 2005 (and was the runner up to Federer in a 3rd).   Federer had so many shots he had to figure out what worked.  I mean, what's next - if Dimitrov becomes great next year, we're going to pretend Boris Becker was pre-prime in the 80s when he was winning Wimbledon titles and then compare their age-adjusted results?"
tennis,3dy9p4,TimRattayGotScrewed,-2,Tue Jul 21 06:34:32 2015 UTC,"He keeps fighting and doesn't make unforced errors and when he's down in a match. Psychologically he digs deep and never loses heart. This is how he can beat Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon.    When he's down in a match....2008 Wimbledon. He was up 2 sets in that match. Federer was the one who came back.  In fact, Federer is tied for the most comebacks from 2 sets down to win a match in the open era. Nadal, on the other hand, has only done that twice in his career (against Robert Kendrick and Mikhael Youzhny at Wimbledon).  And of course you actually believe Nadal's injury BS. Never mind that he has cited injury during/after 10 Grand Slam losses. The boy who cried wolf. The Australian fans didn't buy it against Wawrinka, nor did I. All of a sudden...""I'm down a set and a break....hmmm...oh noooo....owwww, my baaaaack.""   And really...God mode Djokovic in Nadal's prime...Federer was a missed return away from going 2-1 against that Djokovic in Grand Slams that year. Younger Federer would've handled that guy. Nadal had no answers. Lost 7 matches in a row."
tennis,3dy9p4,TimRattayGotScrewed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:50:33 2015 UTC,Federer has the more complete game but to Nadal's credit he's done lot of work and improving over the last decade. The margin has certainly shrunk to a smaller one than it once was.
tennis,3dy9p4,TacticalTennis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:09:36 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's really hard to argue that the best tennis of recent memory (1978 Borg might have a case against this) was not produced by Rafa at the 2008 French. He broke over 50% of his opponent's service games and held a very high percentage of his own. He had break points on 10 of Roger's 11 service games in the final. He dismissed Djokovic, who was playing really well, without even a tiebreak or a hint of a struggle. He had much better opponents than Borg did.  As a Rafa fan, I believe that Roger is the greatest player because of his consistency and records. And prime Roger on grass is among the best performers of all time. But it is really hard to argue against peak Rafa on clay being the best of all time."
tennis,3dy9p4,Ersatz_Okapi,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:11:07 2015 UTC,"On clay and outdoor hard courts, absolutely.  On indoor hard courts it is a toss up.  On grass, however, Federer is better."

Federer leads 9-3 in HC slam wins. 5 US Opens, 4 Australian Opens. And 6-0 in HC YECs. Leads 58-16 in total HC titles. And Federer leads the meaningless H2H in their indoor matches 4-1 (including a bagel beatdown in the 2011 WTF), and you think it's a ""toss up."" LOL. Nadal has 1 indoor title in his entire career and it's a toss up between him and Federer, who is one of the greatest indoor HC players in history.   It's not Federer's fault Nadal got his ass kicked by Gonzalez, Tsonga, Murray, Ferrer, Wawrinka, Berdych, Blake, Youzhny, Ferrer (again), Murray (again), Del Potro, and Djokovic in HC Grand Slam matches.   Saying Nadal is a better player than Federer on outdoor HCs is utterly ridiculous."
tennis,3dy9p4,TimRattayGotScrewed,0,Tue Jul 21 04:33:43 2015 UTC,"H2H is meaningless?  Are you serious?  Head to head is the most accurate way to judge who is better, specifically between two players!  Think before you speak...  This is not ""Federer beating up on (random player) while Nadal was injured, etc.""  Head to head, fair and square, Nadal has beaten him 4x as much on outdoor hard courts.  That is a fact.  If i told you purple beat red on outdoor HC 4x more than red has beaten purple, 100% of people would say purple is better on hardcourts.  Im a Federer fan too, so stop getting salty that im telling you Nadal has beaten him 1 on 1 more on outdoor HC, and his playing style fits outdoor hard courts as close as you can get to his dominant clay style."
tennis,3dy9p4,outbackst8khouse,0,Tue Jul 21 05:37:14 2015 UTC,"No. You're a complete fucking idiot. By the same logic, Andy Roddick > Novak Djokovic. Richard Krajicek > Pete Sampras. Nikolay Davydenko > Rafael Nadal.   And how about this hypothetical: What if player A has a winning record over player B, player B has a winning record over player C, and player C has a winning record over player A? What does that mean?   A is better than B, B is better than C, and C is better than A?   LMAO.  Actually, this does exist:  Stefan Edberg > Thomas Muster Thomas Muster > Goran Ivanisevic Goran Ivanisevic > Stefan Edberg  Moreover, you said Nadal and Federer indoors is a toss up as to who is better, despite the fact Federer is 4-1 against Nadal indoors and has 21 indoor titles compared to Nadal's 1. It doesn't get more laughably stupid than that.   I'd suggest you not think before you speak because you're a complete fucking dolt."

tennis,3dy9p4,outbackst8khouse,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:37:16 2015 UTC,He has the edge on slow outdoor hard courts.  Federer wins easily on the fast hard courts.

tennis,3dy9p4,TimRattayGotScrewed,0,Mon Jul 20 17:11:10 2015 UTC,"3 of Roger's AOs are on the fast courts.  And I didn't speak clearly.  Apologies for that.  In head to head, Nadal has the advantage on the slower hard courts against Federer when he is 28 years old and up.  Outside of this matchup, Roger is the superior hard court player.  You don't have to convince me about Federer.  I already think of him as my tennis idol and the greatest of all time."
tennis,3dy9p4,avaliantheel,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:13 2015 UTC,"Rebound ace wasn't fast. It may appear fast when you watch aggressive players from back in the day competing on it but it was considered a slow-medium surface.   Anyway, the OP simply asked if Nadal is an overall better player than Federer, not if he would win against Federer on any given surface."
tennis,3dy9p4,TimRattayGotScrewed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:34 2015 UTC,The answer is no.  Federer > Nadal.
tennis,3dy9p4,avaliantheel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:07 2015 UTC,"Very different players. The most brutal part of Nadal's play is how fast/strong he is and the overwhelming amount of topspin he has, making long balls rare. At his prime he was so consistent and could play forever. Federer, unlike Nadal, ends points as fast as possible with precise shots. They're just different..."
tennis,3dy9p4,TimMakeMeSomeCurry,0,Mon Jul 20 15:03:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Rafa fan and the answer is no, in my opinion. On clay, obviously yes, but I think Federer has an overall better game on the grass and hard, and his clay game might not be Nadal's, but it's still fantastic. I think Federer just struggles against Nadal's game specifically."

tennis,3dvoae,yasbo,6,Sun Jul 19 22:31:52 2015 UTC,You get the second serve. What might have happened is that there was a challenge or the other player changed racquets or there was some other interrupt and the umpire decided to give the first serve to the server just because of the interruption.
tennis,3dvoae,metalo-strugar,5,Sun Jul 19 22:39:39 2015 UTC,I think it was this then. Sigh. I guess I owe my first friend £10 after all...
tennis,3dvoae,stevie_mann,6,Sun Jul 19 22:44:38 2015 UTC,"Correct. ""Let first serve"" or ""let second serve"" are called by the umpire. If it's a second serve let, a second serve is what you get.  However if the point is replayed due to a line call challenge or similar, the server will always get another first serve. This is sometimes criticised and likely what you heard disputed at Wimbledon."
tennis,3dvoae,fascta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:06:22 2015 UTC,"If it is a second serve let then you only get a redo for your second serve, it does not get restarted back to a first serve. I have never heard of that rule."

Regardless of what serve it is, if the ball hits the net on a serve but the ball stays in, you replay the serve you were on (1st or 2nd). If anything else besides this happens, then the umpire intervened due to an outside circumstance."
tennis,3dvoae,Valinor_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:29:51 2015 UTC,The only case of reverting to a first serve would be if a ball rolled onto the court during the point or there was a similar interruption.
tennis,3dvoae,drodin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:24:45 2015 UTC,"If the let occurs DURING the second serve (e.g. hitting the net cord, ball rolling on court while toss is in air) then the second serve is replayed.  If the let occurs AFTER the second serve (e.g. the second serve is in and a ball rolls onto the court during the rally) then the point is restarted and the server gets a first serve.  Hope this helps."

tennis,3dwqtg,gg_2015,3,Mon Jul 20 06:01:33 2015 UTC,"Fed in his prime was untouchable in grass. I'd argue as untouchable as Nadal in his prime on clay. The only difference was Nadal was still good enough to win a couple French when playing below peak level.   Fed only had one fluke yr in '13 when losing in the 2nd round, akin to Nadal losing in the 4th once. 2 other yrs Fed lost in the QF. In the other yrs since '03 he's made the finals. That's 10 finals (including 7 straight) and won 7.  If an old Fed can still push this Djoker to 4/5 tough sets, imagine how peak Fed would fare. Quite well I'd bet."

tennis,3dusqq,DudeAsInCool,2,Mon Jul 20 00:26:07 2015 UTC,I use the 85. Really good racket. It's helped me get a lot more control on my shots. It is harder to serve with though. The groundstrokes and volleys are the best I've ever hit.
tennis,3dusqq,Eagled1001,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:35:02 2015 UTC,"How does it compare with the Jack Kramer Mid, if you have played with it. I know the composition is different between the two, but I wanted to know how that translates to how it plays"

tennis,3dusqq,yonex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:52:47 2015 UTC,"Pro Staff 85 is a racquet from the 80s with an unbelievably small sweet spot. I can see absolutely no benefit to ANY amateur player using one.   Fair enough if you get a kick out of the nostalgia, but to actually get the most out of your game that is a wholly inadequate racquet."

This year though the rate of decline of nadals game made me feel sorry for him. I might support him occasionally now but obviously not break feds gs record. I dont know if novak can keep it up for 2+ trophies a year, i feel he should at least catch up to nadal, he does deserve it. next year novak should win rg."
tennis,3dxmij,trowawayatwork,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:09:57 2015 UTC,"Federer all the way. I started following Roger in the 2003 Wimbledon and I just fell in love with his style of play.  He was still not in his prime in that tournament but just by watching him play, you had the feeling that no one else would produce the same shots with a racquet.  Especially with the more defensive baseline play and the slower surfaces the game has now, I appreciate Roger even more.  He is the last of the true attacking players and once he retires, it will be a long time until we see an attacker win another slam.  He was the first man to turn tennis from a sport into an art form.  He makes me wish I could play like him just because it must feel so good to hit the shots he does and have the footwork he does."

The game will invariably morph/evolve, whether that be due to changes in the surface(s), the balls themselves, new racket and string technologies, or the continued evolution of the physicality of the sport. Then some player will show us a style of tennis we haven't seen before and the cycle will begin anew."
tennis,3dsru3,Domathoine,3,Sun Jul 19 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"What do you think about Kyrgios? I think he's quite talented and has some real power in his serve, he really could be an up-and-comer. I don't like seeing his strops on court, but other than that he seems fun to watch and could be a rising star. And didn't a tennis pro say that he will ""undoubtedly go on to win majors""? I can't remember who it was, but I could see it in his future. Thoughts?"
tennis,3dsru3,drinkingspaghetti,2,Sun Jul 19 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things to like about Krygios. Yes, he has some attitude problems, but it takes an exceptional amount of self confidence to play at the level required to be winning majors. Is he kind of a tool? Yeah, he is, but I've been saying for years now that tennis needs an established ""bad guy"". There are a few floating around the tour, but none that can consistently challenge the upper echelon.  And that's still Krygios' problem. He has an extraordinary amount of talent, no doubt. But what he doesn't have (yet) is the ability to dismantle an opponent. I think he can develop that ability with the right coaching, but I'm not willing to say that he WILL win a major yet.  That being said, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see it happen eventually, although I wouldn't pick him to be the first up and comer to hit that mark."
tennis,3dsru3,Domathoine,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"Kyrgios has the talent to win grandslams, but not the strength of mind. This aspect is underrated and when two players are of = talent, the one with the stronger mind is often the one who comes out on top. He needs a coach who can improve this aspect, this requires Nick to admit that it is his weakness right now."

tennis,3dsru3,11sparky11,8,Sun Jul 19 15:14:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will be one of the greats as he has stated in an interview that he likes tennis but doesn't love it, and has considered quitting at times. I think he might get some good results in the short term but will soon fade out of the tennis scene sort of like Mark Philippousses."

tennis,3dsru3,king_of_blades,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe... but I think at the end of the day, as much as Kyrgios might not like tennis all that much, he loves winning more. And tennis is the only avenue he will be able to do that on a world scale. He'll never be able to go and play NBA and be a world champ, as much as he might like to. And he knows that. He knows tennis is the only likely avenue in which he will be able to claim success on a world stage, which his ego desperately wants more than anything. I think it'll come down to that, he may have his issues with the sport, but his desire to win will ultimately push him to success."

tennis,3dsru3,Jimmychichi,22,Sun Jul 19 03:19:12 2015 UTC,"The kneejerk response is to say of course--there have always been great tennis players and rivalries before the era of the Big 3 (plus Murray) and there will be after, and that's true.  However, as a person of a certain age, who has been alive long enough to witness the McEnroe/Connors/Borg era, the Lendl/Becker/Edberg era, the Sampras/Agassi era and now the Fed/Rafa/Nole era, I can say that there is something special about this particular era, the likes of which we are not likely to see again anytime soon.  To have not one, not two, but three players all at the same time who are rewriting the record books, two of whom have clear claims for GOAT status (and a third who also could depending on the next few years) is unique and special. These guys have contributed to what many people consider the greatest matches of all time (Wimbledon '08, AO '12), both individually and combined they've won more Grand Slams than any other group of players in any other era, and they've set new records in almost every category. By almost every conceivable measure this era is special in ways that have surpassed all that have come before, and may come after.  Yes, there will be other great champions and rivalries in the future, and great accomplishments, and captivating and exciting tennis. But there is no question in my mind that we are privileged to be witness to something very very special in real time for the past decade that all other players and eras, past and future, will be measured against."
tennis,3dsru3,nankerjphelge,2,Sun Jul 19 12:43:25 2015 UTC,"Just a note on the 3 + Murray.   Murray has got to 8 more GS semi finals and finals than Del Potro, Cilic and Wawrinka combined."
tennis,3dsru3,yaaa_gunners_yaaa,3,Sun Jul 19 17:19:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, but still only has the same number of GS titles as Wawrinka, and lags far behind the Big 3 in every metric. While I'd put him a notch above the rest of the field, he doesn't belong in the same discussion as the Big 3. At best I'd put him in the gap between the Big 3 and the rest of the field."
tennis,3dsru3,nankerjphelge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:13:51 2015 UTC,"Not every metric. Neither Djokovic and Federer have Olympic Gold, and in 2012 Murray beat Wawrinka, Djokovic and Federer on the way to the title.   Both Djokovic and Federer would absolutely love to win Gold given Djokovic's passionate love for all things Serbia and Federer's intent to play on til Rio."
tennis,3dsru3,yaaa_gunners_yaaa,4,Sun Jul 19 18:16:30 2015 UTC,"A gold medal is pretty much the only thing Murray can hold over Nole or Roger in terms of achievements (and Andy holds nothing over Rafa). Other than that he doesn't come close in any major metrics to the other 3--# of GS titles, # of Masters titles, never been #1, and so on. He holds no major tennis records, while each of the Big 3 hold one or several each.  His gold medal and 2 GS titles are the only reason he could be considered to exist in the gap between the Big 3 and the rest of the field, but in no way is that enough to put him up with the Big 3."
tennis,3dsru3,nankerjphelge,-3,Sun Jul 19 18:22:48 2015 UTC,"The idea of a big 3, then a gap, then the rest of the field is more nonsensical than the idea of a big 4.  Andy Murray is comfortably the 4th best player of the big four. but the reason the era is referred to as the big four is because collectively that was the dividing line between the group and the rest of the field.  For a solid 4 years that group was utterly dominant in men's tennis, and usually comprised the semi-finalists in the major tournaments.  Murray was just as dominant over the rest of the field as Roger, Rafa and Novak."
tennis,3dsru3,AliAskari,6,Sun Jul 19 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"It's not nonsensical at all. You can't really put a guy who's won 2 GS titles over 10 years and never been #1 in the world in the same grouping with guys who have all been #1 for long stretches (in some cases record amounts), have 9, 14 and 17 GS titles and record numbers of Masters titles (and Davis cup titles if you want to throw those in as well).   The fact that Andy dominated the rest of the field except the Big 3 actually reinforces my point about him existing in the gap between the Big 3 and the rest of the field. He was/is good enough to be better than the rest of the field, but not good enough to consistently beat or achieve what the Big 3 have.  Yes, Andy is the 4th best player of this era after Roger, Rafa and Novak. But he is not in their league historically, statistically, or by any other major metric. If all four of their careers ended tomorrow, Andy would be an historical afterthought to Roger, Rafa and Novak. That's why at best, you can call this era the ""Big 3 + Murray"", because that's really what it is."
tennis,3dsru3,nankerjphelge,-4,Sun Jul 19 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"It is nonsensical. ""The Big Four"" refers to an era, not the number of titles won.  You're using the benefit of hindsight to define an era in retrospect by totting up the numbers of titles they've won. But Federer started winning his titles in 2003, and Djokovic won his last a week ago. So your definition of ""big 3 + Murray"" is a ridiculously vague term that stretches more than 12 years.   It's easy to point to Roger, Rafa and Novak's wins now and say they were of a different tier. But the point is at the time those matches were being played we didn't know what the outcome would be, because Murray was held in the same regard as those 3 players. the same cannot be said of any other player on the tour.  Which is why it's referred to as The Big Four, not the ""Big 3 + Murray"" which is a ridiculous term."
tennis,3dsru3,AliAskari,4,Sun Jul 19 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"It is nonsensical. ""The Big Four"" refers to an era, not the number of titles won.   Perhaps to you that's what it means. To most people ""The Big Four"" refers to four players who are in a league of their own. And the numbers quite clearly show that Andy doesn't belong in the same league as the other three. He is in the next level below them, and the stats are quite clear on this.   You're using the benefit of hindsight to define an era in retrospect by totting up the numbers of titles they've won.

But the point is at the time those matches were being played we didn't know what the outcome would be, because Murray was held in the same regard as those 3 players. the same cannot be said of any other player on the tour.   Now you're being nonsensical. You're attempting to say that since we didn't know at the time what the outcome would be when matches were being played that Murray still deserves to be considered in the same rarified air as Roger, Rafa and Novak, and that their records and achievements don't count in terms of how they should be considered? That's absurd.   Which is why it's referred to as The Big Four, not the ""Big 3 + Murray"" which is a ridiculous term.   You're acting as if it's always been referred to as ""The Big Four"", or as if that's some unanimous designation. It hasn't, and it's not:  Here's a USA Today article talking about ""The Big 3"", not Big 4:  Is Tennis' 'Golden Era' of Big 3 coming to an End?  Here's a couple talking about how Murray doesn't deserve to be included with the other 3:  Tennis has a Big Three-And-A-Half  Growing gap between Andy Murray and the big three  And here's Murray himself referring to Roger, Rafa and Novak as ""The Big Three"":  Andy Murray: I'm as good as the Big Three  What this shows is that contrary to what you seem to assert, it hasn't always been ""The Big Four"". Hell, even right here on this sub there have been countless debates about including Murray as part of a ""Big Four"", which others calling for a ""Big 3 and a half"":  Does Murray deserve to be in the Big 4?  What all this shows is that debating what to call this era is the same as debating who is the undisputed GOAT. Opinions will vary. What doesn't vary, however, are the stats and facts.  In any case, all of this is a red herring anyway. However you wish to label it is completely incidental. The facts speak for themselves, and they are indisputable--Roger, Rafa and Novak's achievements, stats and records are in a league of their own, and Andy's do not come close. However you wish to label the era doesn't change those facts."
tennis,3dsru3,nankerjphelge,0,Sun Jul 19 19:55:52 2015 UTC,"No, it refers to an era to you too. Otherwise why would you bother naming it ""The Big Three + Murray""?   If it was just a case of who's won the most grand slam titles why wouldn't you call it ""The Big 8"" and include Sampras, Emerson, Laver, Borg and Tilden.  The reason you're calling it the ""The Big Three + Murray"" is because you think it refers to a period of time. Except you're wrong there too.   Since Novak won 8 of his 9 grand slams, Federer has only won 1. (Murray has won 2). So ""The Big Three"" doesn't even exist as a continuous era. It'd be more appropriate to call it ""The Big Two"" and then ""The Big Novak"" later on.  ""The Big Three + Murray"" just doesn't make any sense. Even you think the era was defined by the rivalry between those big four players, you just can't bring yourself to call it that, which is why you've invented the much less catchy ""big three + murray""   Here's a USA Today article talking about ""The Big 3"", not Big 4: Is Tennis' 'Golden Era' of Big 3 coming to an End?

tennis,3dsru3,marcuss55,4,Sun Jul 19 10:18:47 2015 UTC,"This is an extremely vague question.  What do you mean by ""as good""?  Honestly, the big four aren't my favorite players to watch.  Monfils, Ferrer, Tsonga... As long as athletic and entertaining players are around, tennis will always be fun to watch for me.  There are even plenty of players in the tennis HOF that weren't that successful, but they were inducted because of what they did for the game.  You don't need to win a Masters to contribute to the beauty of the game."

tennis,3dsru3,jrstriker12,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:16:00 2015 UTC,"Tennis will obviously improve.  The improvement won't be immediate.  We will have to wait a good number of years until it does, but sport always improves over time.  It may take 5 years or it may take 50."
tennis,3dsru3,avaliantheel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:32:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, tennis can be as good again after the Big Four are retired, but it probably won't be in the near future. I'm also interested in seeing how racket technology will develop in the future."
tennis,3dsru3,Jiosa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:42:43 2015 UTC,"I'm tempted to say it might be better. The quality might go down but there'll be an element of randomness in who wins slams. For so long its been obvious who's gonna win tourneys and barring a couple exceptions the Big 4 have been consistent. Once they retire, we might get to see a period when a larger group of guys win a couple slams each, which sounds like it could be entertaining to watch."
tennis,3dsru3,CurryGuy123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"As Federer put it, nobody is bigger than the sport itself. There will be stars rising. With guys like kyrgios showing promise, it will only take time when the next dominant player takes over. Right now, Djokovic seems quite comfortable holding onto that ""the guy to beat"" title. I dont see him slowing before he hits the 30s."
tennis,3dsru3,hankliny,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"I think the matches and tournaments could be just as interesting, but I doubt we'll ever see the same level of dominance, where the same 2-3 guys win every single slam and all of them make the semis for every one. We might see the next few world number 1's fail to amass even half the trophy count of Fed-Rafa-Djoker. If you're a fan of dominant players/teams like me, you'll probably be disappointed, but I still think we'll have interesting stories and players."
tennis,3dsru3,gibisee4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"This is just one of many peaks in tennis history. As I grew up watching this era, and only gone back to watch clips of the older guys, I may be biased in saying this may be the highest peak in men's tennis as of 2015.  When those older guys were playing, there were few who reached double digits grand slam titles. Borg had the most in his era with 11 (though he retired early and didn't favor well in hard courts). Sampras had the most in his era (and the all-time record when he retired) with 14 (and he didn't favor well in clay courts).  Regardless of the advances in tennis equipments, fitness, knowledge, etc, this is an unbelievable period in men's tennis. Fed has already established the all-time mark at 17, and Nadal has tied Sampras (may someday surpass him). Djokovic surely will win double digits and has the capabilities to surpass Borg and tie/surpass Sampras. Besides grand slam titles, those 3 display the all-court excellence unlike many previous greats. Fed/Nadal already has a career slam, and Djokovic is a dominant force on clay (career slam though has eluded him like it did Fed for many years).  It is not inconceivable to say right now we are witnessing the #1, #2, and #3 GOAT players by the time it's all said and done. It takes more than natural talent and dedication to match the excellence and consistency of those 3. Now that we know where the bar's set at, we shall see. I'm not gonna stop watching, but obviously every up and coming guy will have to win a place in my heart as the Big Three."
tennis,3dsru3,gg_2015,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:29:04 2015 UTC,I sure hope so.
tennis,3dsru3,SheCaresTooMuch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:42:20 2015 UTC,"Hard to say.  I think eventually yes, but the men's game went in a temporary lull shortly after Sampras retired (or just in the few years he was about to retire).  The early 2000s saw Hewitt, Nalbandian, Ferrero, Roddick, Haas, and Federer, and for a while, it was a mix of those players until Federer began to dominate.  Arguably, the women are still in this phase with a dominant number 1, but no solid rivalry behind Serena.  Sharapova can't seem to beat Serena.  Neither can Azarenka (though she has gotten close).  At one point, the women had the tail end of Evert and Navratilova as well as the start of Graf, Seles, and Sanchez-Vicario.  During the 1970s and 1980s, the top players were head and shoulders above everyone, and routinely reached finals.  For the past few years, there were number 1 players that struggled to win Slams (Wozniacki, Jankovic, Safina, Ivanovic) mostly because the Williams sisters got hurt a lot and let their rankings drop, even as they won Slams.  Now, Serena is mostly healthy so at least she is ranked number 1 as well as winning Slams.  Maybe when Serena retires there will be a good rivalry, but the current style (risky power game) typically means it's hard for players to play consistently well week in and week out (see Kvitova).  The men may head in that direction too.  We'll have to see."

tennis,3dsru3,Tripplin,2,Sun Jul 19 06:05:29 2015 UTC,"""Nobody will replace Federer"" does not mean his records won't be broken.  It means that no one will play such a beautiful game like Roger does."

tennis,3dsru3,avaliantheel,3,Mon Jul 20 01:27:52 2015 UTC,"Without sounding too fanboyish but you have to admit that guy has been truly special. His status will never be broken imho at least not for a very long time. (regarding Sampras: I wasn't watching tennis at that time but I could imagine that people sometimes thought that there could even be greater success, e.g. winning the French)"
tennis,3dsru3,youdig,15,Sun Jul 19 08:06:37 2015 UTC,"That is an incredibly fan boyish comment. And don't forget, while Sampras never won the French, he was never, ever so thoroughly dominated by any player like federer has with nadal. Many people criticize him for that"
tennis,3dsru3,Tripplin,0,Sun Jul 19 08:35:12 2015 UTC,"Fed could have had greater success. His main rival, Nadal, dominated him over the course of his career. He is most famous for dominating a weak era, and then being dethroned by the next generation"

tennis,3dsru3,SoaringFish,-9,Sun Jul 19 05:55:56 2015 UTC,Saying there is a big 4 is like saying that michael chang belonged in the Agassi/Sampras rivalry. Murray is not with nadal/fed/djokovic. He has never been number 1 and is 7 slams behind Djoker.
tennis,3dsru3,Tripplin,17,Sun Jul 19 06:23:46 2015 UTC,"""Big 4"" refers to the four people who basically occupied every huge tennis event the past decade. For some long span of time, every masters 1000 was won by one of the four. It is not meant to imply #4 is as good as #1 in that grouping. Adjust your comments in the future accordingly.  It's like in law school rankings, the top 14 are called ""T14"" and considered the big ones. Not because Georgetown and Cornell are as good as Yale and Harvard, but because they are the only fourteen schools to have ever been in the top 10."
tennis,3dsru3,KyleG,-5,Sun Jul 19 07:10:42 2015 UTC,"The t14 are grouped because they are the targets for biglaw. Now while the big law might recruit elsewhere, the t14 are the main ones. And of the schools outside the t14, there are the few select schools ahead of everyone else. And it is also true that in the t14, there are schools that are considered the very best (Yale). What I'm saying is that murray is like one of the select schools outside the t14, while Federer is the Yale of t14. There is such a big difference in the accomplishments of fed/nadal/djokovic and murray that it is a downgrade for those other 3 to be paired with him. Murray is the best of rest. Just like the select schools out of the t14, there are guys like Wawrinka, ferrer, and murray. Murray is the best of the select group ( and thereby best of the rest).   Also, all I'm saying by the #1 comment is that I consider it a qualifier to be ranked in The top tier group. And that's where the law school analogy is not perfect. The rankings in law schools are somewhat subjective. There is no subjective in tennis. If you win enough, you are #1. Fed/rafa/djok have proven that they are #1 players. Murray hasn't. He most certainly can get there, but he hasn't."
tennis,3dsru3,Tripplin,2,Sun Jul 19 08:26:40 2015 UTC,"Murray has got to 8 more GS semi finals and finals than Del Potro, Cilic and Wawrinka combined.  The Big 4 are so called because on so many occasions they have been the ones contesting the SFs at every GS."

tennis,3dt4dv,MakeshiftLeftBack,8,Sun Jul 19 14:49:11 2015 UTC,"So Australia vs. GB in the semis. This is actually one of the rare instances where if GB had any clay courts, I'd be tempted to throw the Aussies a curveball and play on clay, because I think clay hurts Kyrgios and Groth's power-play more than it hurts Murray and Ward. (Although I think Bedene is a better clay-courter.)  Note: I'm aware this plan fails because we have almost fucking zero clay-courts in the UK."
tennis,3dt4dv,Haze667,4,Sun Jul 19 15:12:05 2015 UTC,"I agree.  But realistically, they'll most likely go with snail-speed indoor hardcourt."
tennis,3dt4dv,MakeshiftLeftBack,3,Sun Jul 19 15:24:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty much a certainty it'll be indoors considering the weather in GB in September ain't great. Which again is further reason why we should have more clay courts in this country, because it rains here about 75% of the time, and clay is the only surface that you can play on in the rain without breaking your ankles."

Davis Cup alternates the host for head-to-heads:  Last (and only) time Belgium played Argentina was in 1948 in Belgium so this semi will be played in Argentina.  Last time Australia played France was in 2014 in France so this semi would be played in Australia.  Last time Australia played GB was in 2003 in Australia so this semi would be played in GB.

tennis,3dt4dv,solitarysniper,6,Sun Jul 19 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"He kisses Andy Murray's arse way too much, and this is coming from a Scottish/British Murray fan. He treats Andy like a saint and praises him to the point of taking it too far.  It's been particularly bad this summer in Wimbledon and the Davis Cup. He's attributed James Ward's success this year down to him 'being around Murray' all the time and being 'taken under his wing'; like come on, I'm sure Murray has helped gee Wardy up but he's a competent player himself and has a fair bit of success in the ATP Tour himself (Queen's SF 2011). In the doubles he acted like it was due to Andy Murray that we won the doubles, even though any enthusiastic tennis fan worth his salt would be able to recognise that Jamie really was the influential figure to steady the ship and guide Andy to be a bit more coordinated in doubles play. He didn't really give Jamie enough credit.  Castle also has the problem of looking too far ahead and getting too excited about Murray/British prospects (apparently he's been warned about this before by the BBC). When things were 1-1 prior to the doubles rubber Andrew started saying that we should be able to win the Cup, when the tie was nowhere near over.  He's just an embarrassment as a commentator, and about as impartial as a Fox reporter."

tennis,3dt4dv,dropshot,2,Sun Jul 19 13:45:23 2015 UTC,Maybe because Simon had a more recent win over Murray (this year at Rotterdam)?  Neither choice is great for France even though Gasquet has had one more win than Simon (but they're old or or on clay).
tennis,3dt4dv,Haze667,3,Sun Jul 19 10:55:13 2015 UTC,"He did win at Rotterdam, but the H2H is terrible (12-2 for Andy, I just checked).  I don't know, both Gilles and Gasquet did well at Wimbledon this year, but I would have expected them to go with Gasquet in this time of trouble for the French team. He's fresher, he's got a good OHB and the H2H is less terrible (5-3 for Andy).  I'm not complaining, just sayin'!"

I love Wilson US Open balls and they are great, better than the regular Penn balls that everyone uses for the first few hours. But they just die and fluff up too quickly. High performance and high cost but isn't worth it for how long it lasts."
tennis,3dt2vm,Vermonster_802,3,Mon Jul 20 01:42:36 2015 UTC,My favorite are Slazenger but i can't find them everyday. To me they have great feel and above average durability. Other than that i prefer Wilson U.S Open balls. Worst ball i ever used was Wilson Titanium(it felt like i was hitting a stone.)  If its worth mentioning im in CT
tennis,3dt2vm,DRUNKTENNIS,3,Sun Jul 19 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"At the club I taught at in Virginia we had Penn and Wilson. But within those brands you can get a lot of variety. Generally they say regular duty is for indoor or clay courts and extra duty is for outdoor hard courts.  But that's not the only way to look at the difference between regular duty and extra duty. I find regular duty is more conducive to hitting topspin because the ball is a little softer and pancakes easier whereas extra duty will tend to fly out beyond the baseline a bit more. But if you hit the ball flat extra duty can get you a few more mph on your winners, but that can also be harder on your wrists.  So really when picking out balls you can choose some that compliment your game rather than what surface you're playing on and when asked about selection just say what every single person I have ever met on a court has said. ""Oh I just picked these up without looking, I don't really care what we play with."" ;-)"

tennis,3dt2vm,absentwalrus,2,Sun Jul 19 19:52:23 2015 UTC,Roger Federer lasts much longer than a Wilson US Open ball though. Wilson US Open is more like Del Potro or Soderling. Plays great in the beginning but it just dies faster than any other ball I've used.
tennis,3dt2vm,CardboardPotato,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:44:49 2015 UTC,newb question: what is the difference?
tennis,3dt2vm,Tvizz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:29:51 2015 UTC,Differences are quite marked. Some have more pressure inside so are more solid to hit like the Wilson US Open balls. These tend to wear more easily than a softer ball like the Babolat Team for instance which is softer and will take more spin. It IS important to find ones that you like for matches where you bring your own balls!

tennis,3dqipc,Mehrban,2,Sun Jul 19 04:38:19 2015 UTC,"Sometimes we talk about how Serena would match up against a lower ranked male player, it seems clear to me that either of these guys (Rublev rank 201, Ram rank 141) would shit all over Serena in a straight up contest.  Also, what is it that seperates these players from someone in the top 20 or 30 on the tour? It doesn't look like it's racket speed, they look like they're hitting it pretty hard. Is it just consistency in not making errors? Foot speed/defense? Stamina?"
tennis,3dqipc,BAshley1995,5,Sun Jul 19 20:04:23 2015 UTC,"Top pros hit it even harder, even closer to the lines and with even more spin.   Look on YouTube for practice sessions between pros, they're filmed from this sort of angle as this video.   Wawrinka and Murray is a really good one."

tennis,3drkmp,Donchaknow,3,Sun Jul 19 05:51:09 2015 UTC,Djokovic is he greatest return of serve of all time. Only agassi really has a case other than him.
tennis,3drkmp,avaliantheel,0,Sun Jul 19 07:05:18 2015 UTC,"Nah I think Nadal actually has better touch volleys than Federer, its very close though. Federer still has superior volleys overall since he can do literally anything with them whereas Nadal sucks at hitting deep drive volleys.   If any Fed fans or tennis fans in general disagree with me then watch any of Nadal's matches. He doesn't approach net as often as Fed since his volleys are still worse overall and his approaches aren't as good, but when he finds an opportunity he goes in a lot for winning drop volleys."
tennis,3drkmp,TacticalTennis,0,Sun Jul 19 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"Nadal has a very good drop volley, but he usually comes to the net when he's in a very strong position in points. I'd argue that Federer's drop volley is better but it might appear worse sometimes because he needs to pull it off under tougher circumstances."
tennis,3drkmp,compuzr,2,Sun Jul 19 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab:   Federer - Slice, Footwork, Serve, Volley, arguably variety too...

Lobs Delpo - Power off the ground, Sportsmanship/Gamesmanship Wawrinka - Backhand (overall based on past 2/3 years), His power and footwork are great too, but not better than the other 5"
tennis,3drkmp,tigull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:36:04 2015 UTC,"Murray has a wicked and effective slice too.  I'd say better than Fed's.  I think Rafa also has exceptional footwork, it's just less noticeable in his game, but ya I could see you giving Fed the edge there.  I wouldn't give Fed variety either.  For me, it's too debate-able with Murray.  Good point about Rafa's in-match adjustment and strategy.  I wouldn't give endurance to Djokovic over Rafa.  While I think Murray is a pretty intelligent player, I would have to give this one to Federer, if anyone."
tennis,3drkmp,droplob,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"Those picks you made are certainly reasonable (although I disagree), except for intelligence. If I were to give this to anyone besides Murray it would be Rafa, by virtue of his strategy and in-match adjustments. That, in combination with his mental toughness and you have a General of War on the court. Federer by contrast can be fairly criticized for relying too much on shot-making and not being patient enough in his tennis. Certainly he can play very intelligent tennis, but often it is high risk relative to these peers."

tennis,3dsuwp,pounro,2,Sun Jul 19 10:41:14 2015 UTC,Most of the time you can see the spin on the ball after you hit it. But the ball should bounce off a little higher and harder
tennis,3dsuwp,DEFINITELYnotA_PEDO,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:34:57 2015 UTC,"yea, if you're hitting topspin against a wall, the bounce back will be significantly higher than would appear natural.  that being said i find it difficult to make rallys against a wall using topspin unless you've got a whole lot of room."
tennis,3dsuwp,nobuild,2,Sun Jul 19 04:05:51 2015 UTC,"If you are making solid contact with the ball with an open or slightly tilted (top of racket towards the front just a hair) racket face and following through over your shoulder, then you are putting topspin on it.  Forehand should look like this: http://i.imgur.com/EImqeHJ.jpg  Backhand looks identical at contact: http://i.imgur.com/rgFTWls.jpg  If your racket face looks like that and follow through up over your shoulder, there will be topspin."
tennis,3dsuwp,McMuffinManz,3,Mon Jul 20 00:38:59 2015 UTC,"Easiest way to tell is the feel of the ball on the racquet.  When you use topspin, you swing from low to high and hear the unmistakeable sound of brushing against the ball.  You also feel the ball rolling against the strings.  When you hit a flat ball, you swing through the ball and you hear a very solid noise. The ball does not feel like it is rolling against the strings."

tennis,3dw3v0,Tripplin,7,Mon Jul 20 01:23:24 2015 UTC,"Agassi was ten times the better player than Muster.  Unfortunately he had a seriously week head game in GS Finals.  It's incredible that a one time slam champion can seriously compare himself to one with a Golden Slam.  Damn, you reminded me how much I miss Agassi.  He was so fun to watch, especially later in his career."
tennis,3dw3v0,rhcp6131,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"He didn't have the golden slam at that time. He had 3 slams and no gold medal yet (statement was in March, 1996, when Agassi was whining about Muster being ranked #1).  I don't despise Agassi the way I despise Sampras, but his movement was a liability waiting to be exposed. That's probably partly why he was able to have so much success in his 30s; he already knew how to win without doing a lot of running."
tennis,3dw3v0,rhcp6131,3,Mon Jul 20 02:09:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay, that makes more sense.  That was the start of some very poor tennis from Agassi which pretty well continued up until he married Steffi.  Agassi's knees and back had always been an issue for him since his mid twenties, so I still think he has the most impressive late career resurgence of all time, and I think he was one of the greatest shot selectors of all time.  And he played 21 consecutive US Opens in the men's draw.  Pretty incredible.  As far as his rivalry with Pete went, obviously Pete came out on top, but I always thought that Pete was pretty insufferable.    I actually wonder what will become of Murray in the next five years?  Will the others drop off and he'll grab a few more titles or will it be two and done.  He's an incredible player with a week head game for GS Finals, with only two to his name at 28.  Not unlike Agassi."

Compare his opponents to Nadal's rivals or Djokovic's. Or go back before Sampras' era and you'll find much stronger competition overall."
tennis,3dw3v0,Sebastien447,2,Mon Jul 20 02:47:26 2015 UTC,"Agassi won Wimbledon from the BASELINE in an era where the grass was crazy slick. He beat a prime Boris Becker, who at that point was a 6 time Wimby finalist, in the quarters. He beat John McEnroe on his last Cinderella run for a slam in the semis. Then he beat Goran Ivanisevic, whose game was built for grass.  Agassi was one of the purest ball strikers that has ever picked up a racquet."

tennis,3dsw03,finkydink66,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:32:34 2015 UTC,"Lower hand on backhand is either at continent or eastern.   Edit: to be clear, the lower hand is what defines what the racquet will do. If you have your bottom wrist rounded to much due to an improper grip, your body we want to straighten that wrist to make it more comfortable which then causes the racquet face to open. Bottom hand stabilizes the racquet, top hand does the work."
tennis,3dsw03,LoveFifty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:36:17 2015 UTC,What's the advantage to using continental on slices on volleys?  It feels so awkward to me.
tennis,3dsw03,Valinor_,2,Sun Jul 19 03:43:55 2015 UTC,You can cut the ball more efficiently. You don't need to adjust your wrist as much as say trying to get the same contact on the ball as a slice with an eastern grip. Small movements for a wider range of shots makes it easier to do in a split second.
tennis,3dsw03,finkydink66,2,Sun Jul 19 03:50:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm... What do you use? I had no idea it was possible to hit, say, a backhand volley with anything else."

tennis,3dsw03,TheCrazyRed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:56:08 2015 UTC,"My advice is to switch to a continental grip for serving, volleying and BH slices IMMEDIATELY before you develop a bad habit and struggle to change later on.   Note: as mentioned above, if you have a 2HBH the hand closest to the base of the racquet handle should also be in a continental grip."
tennis,3dsw03,ADM31,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:09:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I already have on my serve, and I was just about to go to the practice wall and start practicing with it for other shots.  I have trouble finding it when I'm playing.  I guess that'll probably fix itself."
tennis,3dsw03,TheCrazyRed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:49:46 2015 UTC,Volleys below the net with say an eastern requires you to really crank your wrist open. But with a continental it's a quick small movement.

Since the second-serve ball isn't so important as the first, I think if I were a pro player I'd just choose my first-service ball, toss all the rest back, and then, in the event that the first didn't go in, take whatever was thrown my way for the second...."

tennis,3dqa71,flipfl0p,7,Sat Jul 18 12:31:50 2015 UTC,Why do women not wear regular shorts? Seems easier in just about every way.
tennis,3dqa71,Kinon05,2,Sat Jul 18 14:15:55 2015 UTC,"Some do, but I find regular shorts that don't chafe with pockets are hard to come by. Tighter shorts don't chafe, but are less modest, so the skirt over it helps with covering up. Nike makes a nice short (victory summer short I think it's called) with tight under shorts to help with the chafing and pockets. If the sizing wasn't so inconsistent it may just be the HG of women's tennis shorts."
tennis,3dqa71,flipfl0p,3,Mon Jul 20 02:38:55 2015 UTC,I'm a guy but I'd make a guess that skirts allow a better range of motion. the question should be why men aren't wearing skirts/dresses!

tennis,3drggt,SupaZT,2,Sat Jul 18 19:12:34 2015 UTC,"the head size is very slightly out of your range (102 sq in), but the volkl organix v1 midplus is an excellent racquet that fits a huge range of skill levels and styles.  $99 at TW.  that being said, racquet selection is very subjective and there is no substitute for demoing racquets in match conditions!  for strings (speaking in generalities), polyester is stiff/durable/offers more control to big hitters due to the low elasticity.  many great polyesters are actually quite cheap (i use volkl cyclone).  if you break strings often or hit with a lot of power/spin you could try a half set of polyester in your racquet (in the mains).  syn gut/multifilament/nat gut are elastic strings.  natural gut is very elastic, powerful, and easy on the arm... good for non string breakers because it does not ""drop off"" in quality with time.  an older set of natural gut still plays great.  syn gut is basic nylon string that plays ok for most recreational players.  multifilament is a premium syn gut with more strands, but not as nice as nat gut.  with your size and playing ability, you could try a hybrid string setup with a polyester in the mains (up and down strings) and a syn gut in the crosses.  this gives a good balance of power/control and durability and is worth a try at least once."
tennis,3drggt,picklesac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:41:30 2015 UTC,I use a head extreme which is head light. I used to use a babolat pure drive which is very head heavy. I recommend that.
tennis,3drggt,MrMiaogi,0,Sat Jul 18 21:51:28 2015 UTC,"I would highly recomend splurging and spending the extra 30 bucks out of your price range to get a top of the line racket. That being said, my personal favorite and racket id recommend is the Babolat AeroPro Drive. Pretty light and great for ground strokes, while really not sacrificing much in the balance at the net and serves. Best racket you can get for groundies and good in all other areas, highly recommended. Id also say unless your hands are huge, id goto a smaller grip size. Im a 4.5 lvl, and a small grip makes it easier to flick your wrist and generate spin, I play with a measly 4 1/8 + overgrip."
tennis,3ds641,dragonsky,3,Sat Jul 18 23:02:48 2015 UTC,"I dunno, 30% maybe.  He's won a Newport title before and he's a good grass player.  Ram is a pretty interesting case.  Promising junior, #1 recruit in the nation out of high school, but he patterned his game off Pete Sampras and never had much of a shot outside of grass tournaments.  And how could Rajeev have guessed that the game would change this much?  Sampras won his last Slam when Rajeev was 18yo, yet by the time he turned 25yo his style of play was already ancient.  6'4"", 130mph serve, quality net game ... I wonder if there weren't for all the technology and surface changes (and the phasing out of grass tournaments) that were mostly out of his control if he would've been an consistent top-50 player, and how many others there were with an ATP-worthy serve and volley game that we never got a chance to see."
tennis,3ds641,YaoPau,2,Sat Jul 18 23:13:48 2015 UTC,"It was interesting that Ram played JP Smith of Australia in the semis.  I recall watching Somdev Devvarman play JP Smith in the third of Devvarman's singles finals.  Devvarman won two singles titles, one against Smith (the second), and one against John Isner.  At the time, JP Smith was a first year player at the University of Tennessee, and seemed to play a classic serve-and-volley style.  If Ram was inspired by Sampras (he's apparently been nicknamed ""Rampras""), that would be reasonable given his age and who his inspiration was.  Smith probably had less of an excuse being much younger, but he played a classic serve and volley style as well.  I believe he never made the singles final at the college level, but did win a lot of matches, and announcers said he was named SEC (Southeastern Conference, a conference in American professional sports) male athlete of the year.  So, unusual that a guy that had a serve and volley game would play another guy who had a similar kind of game.  Anyway, yeah, I think Karlovic will be strongly favored.  Sock has a pretty big serve comparable to Ram, and yet Karlovic managed to break serve in both sets.  Karlovic is probably hoping he gets his chance like Hewitt did (Hewitt reached the finals two years in a row, but lost, then finally won it last year over Karlovic).  The biggest difference between Ram and Sock is that Ram attacks more (though Sock came to net some as well).  Sock reached the semis last year as well, so he's probably hoping for his own breakthrough at some point."
tennis,3ds641,dropshot,-3,Sun Jul 19 00:12:55 2015 UTC,so according to this post. sampras would barley be an atp tour player because of the game changed so much?    you guys are so clueless.   i hope i am not shocking too many people here but rajeev ram isn't as good at tennis as pete sampras was.
tennis,3ds641,scrappydoofan,0,Sun Jul 19 00:32:07 2015 UTC,I said Ram could've been top-50
tennis,3ds641,YaoPau,-2,Sun Jul 19 00:40:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, Sampras wouldn't even be top 100 if he was playing today with the same style. Now if he was born a few years later maybe he would still be a champion today by building his game around a modern style instead, his groundstroke game was solid anyways and he had a good forehand despite playing serve and volley. But if he continued to serve and volley today, there is no doubt he would be dominated by most if not all of the top 50-100 or even top 200."
tennis,3ds641,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:47:24 2015 UTC,"What!? Are you crazy man? Players like Gilles Muller and Ivo Karlovic employ predominantly serve-and-volley and they're not even half as skilled as Sampras. Even Feliciano Lopez serve-and-volleys quite often and he's in the top 20. That leads me to believe Sampras could probably be top 20 in today's game using his s&v tactics, which is really impressive. You've gotta give Pistol more credit."
tennis,3ds641,Jobin1616,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:00:33 2015 UTC,i can't believe ur getting down votes. sampras in his prime would ranked 4-5 in today's game
tennis,3ds641,chola80,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:38:22 2015 UTC,They also have a much bigger serve than Sampras. Ivo Karlovic is not serve and volley. He serves and volleys but wins more points purely off a serve whereas Sampras won a good amount of points off volleys too even without a perfect serve. Lopez still has a baseline game and even though he sometimes serves and volleys it is far from his main strategy. I'll give Pistol credit. He is an amazing athlete with a good forehand. If he modeled his game off today's game instead and was born 9-15 years later he could possibly still be at the top of todays game with a primarly baseline game.
tennis,3ds641,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:07:25 2015 UTC,"Gilles Muller does not have a bigger serve than Sampras. Karlovic perhaps has a ""bigger"" serve than Sampras, but not more effective. Sampras had one of the best serves of all time."
tennis,3ds641,Jobin1616,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"Karlovic does not have a more effective serve that Sampras but he wins WAY more points purely off serve. Wonder why Karlovic still isn't top 10 like Raonic then? He doesn't have any other part of his game to back it up. Sampras' serve isn't nearly as big as Karlovic's so he won't get nearly as many free points from an ace.  AND you can't compare 1990s Sampras serve to today where the court speeds are slowed by a lot compared to 1990s Wimbledon or US Open. Also, I knew about Gilles Muller but in all honesty I didn't even know who the fk he was. So I just looked up a match, he serves and volleys a lot but still nowhere near as much as Sampras in fear of being passed by(in this case) Murray.  Be inclined to disagree with me if you want, heck go adopt a serve and volley game yourself then if you think it gets you that far today. But the rankings don't lie. There are zero pure serve and volleyers left(don't argue with me Muller and Karlovic are, like I said, Muller still isn't pure serve and volley and Karlovic is more serve bot than serve and volley)."
tennis,3ds641,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:18:43 2015 UTC,"Ok I will remain inclined to disagree with you. And I don't think I'm going to go adopt a serve and volley game and go pro, because I'm not Pete Sampras.  Also, just remembered, Michael Llodra was a 99% pure serve and volleyer and he was top 100 until 2013 and reached a career high of 21. So there you go."
tennis,3ds641,Jobin1616,0,Sun Jul 19 01:35:52 2015 UTC,"in the 90's they didn't measure the serve speed right off the racket like they do today.   that adds 6-8 mph hour to the serve speed.   meaning sampras fastest serve would be mid to high 130's.      ivo having a better serve the sampras is the only correct thing you have said so far.    sampras won a lot of points with his serve he wasn't edberg, although edberg would be amazing today as well."
tennis,3ds641,scrappydoofan,2,Sun Jul 19 01:23:24 2015 UTC,Can you give me a link or something to confirm that they measure serve differently now? I've never heard of them measuring serve differently and in the thousands of GOAT discussions I've read I'm 100% sure someone would have mentioned Sampras actually having the undisputed GOAT serve since his serve was actually high 130s.  Today isn't the 1990s nor is it the 1980s. I'll believe you if you can find me a match within the past 11 years where a player effectively serve and volleyed as much as Sampras or Edberg.

If it was common knowledge why is Sampras' serve not considered to be consistently 130+mph and why is Federer's serve even compared to Sampras' serve then? I guess people would have mentioned Sampras' serve actually being 6-8 mph faster than what it was when talking about his serve but never once have I seen this mentioned anywhere.   And I guess me saying serve and volley dieing out today isn't correct. Probably explains why Nadal, Federer, and Djokovic are pure serve and volleyers."
tennis,3ds641,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:01:45 2015 UTC,"I was always under the assumption that Sampras had a monster second serve. Of course, his first serve was great as well.  If Ram can beat Isner, I feel that he's got a shot at Karlovic too. Isner at least has an OK backhand passing shot, whereas I've probably seen Karlovic hit 1 topspin backhand that landed in."

tennis,3ds641,scrappydoofan,2,Sun Jul 19 01:00:00 2015 UTC,these guys are retards.. pete sampras would definitely be top 10 in today's game
tennis,3ds641,chola80,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:41:17 2015 UTC,Agassi made the US Open with a baseline game. Not serve and volley at all. By 2005 courts had already changed and polyester strings were in(Notice how this is also the year Nadal broke through with his APD and duralast while Federer continued dominating with gut/poly in the 90 in frame he switched to). Sampras' shots would be nowhere as effective today with slower courts and overall players being able to rip much harder passing shots with poly strings.

tennis,3dn2bz,kabobobobob,11,Fri Jul 17 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"Great stuff, and glad you managed to enjoy yourself after what must have been an arduous transatlantic trip over here to the UK. Speaking from my personal experience, for future reference if you are wanting Centre Court tickets, it's probably worth camping for two nights to guarantee yourself to be inside the 500 seat allocation for each round, at least for the later rounds (3rd-QF).  I've been queuing for the past 4 years now, and it's definitely the best way to obtain tickets if you're unsuccessful in the ballot; plus you get to select what day you want to see matches on and what court. Just be wary of the fact that the views/angles you get for 'queue' seats are right near the front so you don't get that scenic/TV view where you really experience the true beauty of a Fed backhand winner down the line.  Apart from that, the queue's a great experience!"

I actually kind of appreciated the difference in seating - being so close made it feel different than watching on TV. Although you are right, it's more difficult to see ball placement and overall player movement from so close. I was lucky to have some higher-up seats for Federer.

We went for the Quarters hoping it would be something like Murray v Nadal (of course Brown knocked Rafa out) and then Federer v whoever.  However, the powers that be decided to put Fed on Court 1 (a rareity) instead putting Murray and Djokovic on Centre. This put us in a dilemma of whether to go experience the CC atmosphere for Andy or see Fed while we have the chance. There's also the issue of weather. It's a huge consideration when deciding what to see now the roof's there on Centre.  We ended up seeing Fed and the Stan-Gasquet match on Court One and it was brilliant to see, considering Andy and Novak rolled over their opponents.  Wimbledon truly is a unique place."
tennis,3dn2bz,gimme_creddit,5,Fri Jul 17 18:31:58 2015 UTC,"That is so interesting. I queued overnight at Wimbledon back in 1996 and it was so different. The queue was on the road leading up to the AEC. There were a few people with tents and they had a tent corral on one side of the road. The rest of us that decided to tough it out were on the sidewalk. I think I got there about 8 or 9pm at night. After making a snap decision to take the train up from Bournemouth. I spent a very uncomfortable night napping on the pavement. Ahh to be young and dumb again. I remember someone coming around with queue cards early in the am, and I have no memory of what we did for a bathroom break. It might have been a walk to the tube station. I managed to get court one tickets. I had a fantastic day there, well worth roughing it the night before."
tennis,3dn2bz,hyrusekki,3,Fri Jul 17 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"That's really fascinating. Glad to see they've made progress in terms of accommodations over the years. It really wasn't at all rough. We had a comfortable sleeping bag/pad, and a good tent - and a solid, safe place to store it during the day. The bathrooms they have there are also pretty good - sure, it'll get progressively dirtier throughout the night, but they clean it every day. They also come around with a little truck to collect all the garbage in the morning. Having sinks/mirrors was especially clutch and let us make sure we could at least wash our faces and brush our teeth and have a little dignity compared to the ticket holders who are prim and proper and wear suits and ties."
tennis,3dn2bz,Thadderful,4,Fri Jul 17 18:53:31 2015 UTC,Were people really quiet after 11pm?  I can't see a golf course full of drunk people in tents being quiet at night.  Also: that man that let you in to see Federer is a hero.  People like that make me happy about humanity.  Thank you for sharing your experience!  I enjoyed reading all about it!
tennis,3dn2bz,IAmNotASkycap,8,Fri Jul 17 17:07:02 2015 UTC,"Haha, yes. The stewards were actually kind of strict. A bunch of us even went to the far side of the field (away from all the tents) to continue hanging out and drinking around 11:30 or so. A couple stewards walked over and told us to get in our tents or we'd get kicked out.   And, yes, the man was incredible. Again, just a matter of ""you don't ask, you don't get."" His wife gave us some of her champagne, too. My cousin and I spoke about it after - we figured he gets those tickets fairly often - most debenture tickets are held by the big corporate guys. He probably figured missing a set or two on his end wouldn't be that big of a deal - especially if he was making someone else really happy (and had access to an open bar). Shot him an email later thanking him. He told me he was just impressed that someone had the balls to randomly come up and ask a stranger like that. Definitely want to pay it forward to some other tennis fan down the road."
tennis,3dn2bz,reddits_r_us,3,Fri Jul 17 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I was actually one of the stewards in the queue (night shift) for the two weeks! We (well I did) tell people to go to the other side of the field if they want to continue chatting for a bit. It is the g4s (security guys) who get really antsy about it, some of them are pretty power hungry and just like throwing their weight around. I actually almost got into an argument because they told a guy he couldn't go over to the other side of the field to listen to music and finish his cigarettes... We try to be accommodating - we only care when it gets out of hand / bordering on noise complaint level (of which we did receive a few!).   Off the top of my head we only kicked people to the back because they left the queue for way too long (which we actually are strict about) and maybe one case of rowdiness where we confiscated their tickets and then returned them to their owners in the morning.   Glad you had a good time man - those debenture guys sound like absolute legends!"

tennis,3dtnss,TimRattayGotScrewed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:14:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, it used to be the best in tennis.  I don't think that anyone seriously believes that Federer hasn't declined. It's so obvious. He's slower, has less stamina, and his forehand and backhand are nowhere near as powerful and precise as they used to be. His reactions are also slower."
tennis,3dtnss,Jiosa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"I think it easy to look at him now and think he hasn't declined, because in the areas where he has actually declined, you won't spot them exposed in the vast majority of his matches where he plays against scrubs, I'm talking about 1st round - 4th round/quarter final. In most cases, the point usually finishes very quickly after his serve (which is one area that hasn't declined IMO). On the whole, in these matches, he doesn't do a great deal of running. So he ends up winning in comfortable straight sets as he has always done. He still constantly reaches semis and finals and you think, wow he hasn't declined at all.  But when he plays a Djokovic, or a Wawrinka, someone who will force him to go on the defense, that's when his areas of decline are exposed. He can't turn defense into attack as easily as he could, and a large amount of that is down to his footspeed, but as mentioned, his forehand isn't as capable as it once was. I look at the Wimbledon final, and it was clear that once he was on the defensive, he couldn't quite get himself out of that hole and get back into attack."
tennis,3dtnss,Rafael_Federer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:15:13 2015 UTC,"Physically, Federer has declined, because he's 34. His back and knees prevent him from moving the way he did in his prime. His strokes themselves didn't magically get worse.  What frustrates me about the Federer apologists (and I was one, until I went and re-watched his tennis throughout his career), is that they point to anything after '06-'07ish as post-prime, thus excusing every negative result in the last 8 years. That doesn't make sense. It's very obvious that tennis improved between 1996 and 2006, and it's very obvious that tennis improved between 2006 and now. Players are able to hit with pace and spin from every area of the court in a way that simply wasn't the case at the beginning of Federer's dominance."
tennis,3dtnss,plenty_of_time,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:51 2015 UTC,"His strokes are worse. His racket head speed isn't as good, his technique is different.   Tennis hasn't ""improved."" It's changed into a rally-fest. Shotmaking is no longer en vogue. Federer's one of the last guys to still attempt it, but since he's older, slower, and less powerful than he used to be, he's not good enough at it to get the same results he once did.  Players weren't trying to play the style of tennis they play today. Offensive players like Federer, Nalbandian, Safin, and Haas were trying to attack. Defensive players like Hewitt were trying to use the opponent's pace against them and hope for a target.   If Djokovic and Murray tried to play the style of tennis players were playing in 2004, they'd struggle mightily and probably be outside the Top 10."
tennis,3dtnss,plenty_of_time,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:24 2015 UTC,"Both shotmaking and consistency have improved. There's not much point in discussing this, I don't think.

I don't even want to know what you think about Tim Rattay . . ."
tennis,3dtnss,Personacorona,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"Both shotmaking and consistency have improved.   This is laughable and delusional. No, players have not said shotmaking has improved. Federer said exactly the opposite. He said he used to be able to dominate the sport with shotmaking, but the courts have slowed and the game has changed to long, tedious baseline rallies and he can no longer do that.   Of course, the biggest reason he can no longer do that is he has declined, but he understandably doesn't want to admit that.   The idea that shotmaking has improved...I mean, how delusional do you have to be? Watch a Djokovic/Murray match and tell me about all this great ""shotmaking."" Their 47 stroke rallies ending in unforced errors, point after point, is apparently ""great shotmaking"" now."

Preferable 100"" head size and 10.5 oz unstrung give or take. For a newer player who is developing thats about what you want in a nice racket. These are called ""midplus"".  Demo rackets and strings, find out what you like!   B) Babolat pure drive. If you want to get a racket just based on suggestion this one is as universal as it gets, most popular frame among all levels and will work for anyone really (preference aside). Pro players will add lead tape to this racket to make it heavier but the average person is all set in stock form.   Strings: Wilson NXT is best for comfort and Luxilon ALU is best for durability. Go expensive on the strings since you are new to the game and don't hit very hard, they will last a while. No reason to upgrade to a players racket and put crap strings in it. It's worth the money to put good strings on your racket.   So... Babolat pure drive, with Luxilon ALU mains and Wilson NXT crosses."

tennis,3dqg5s,Harlanzip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"Babolat pure drive 3/8 grip size with Luxilon ALU mains and NXT crosses strung at 57 pounds (16 gauge). That will be a good setup for you if you want me to just straight up tell you what to get.   String tension ranges from 50-60 pounds, with exceptions of course. Any tension in that range will work but honestly it doesn't matter where in that range you choose if you are not that high level of a player; it won't effect much if your swing speed is low.  The tension drops fast so go higher if you don't plan on stringing after every few hours of play."
tennis,3dqg5s,shakedspeare,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:44:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I just placed the order. I was leaning toward that racquet anyway so I think I'll be satisfied. Grip size was exactly what I measured myself at as well. Good call.

tennis,3do5bp,redavid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks. But I bring this up because this is what happened with Richards. They conducted a gender verification test and the test came up ambigulous. The testing was ruled unfair by a United States court.   From wiki|| Judge Ascione found in Richards' favor. He ruled: ""This person is now a female"" and that requiring Richards to pass the Barr body test was ""grossly unfair, discriminatory and inequitable, and a violation of her rights."" He further ruled that the USTA intentionally discriminated against Richards, and granted Richards an injunction against the USTA and the USOC allowing to play in the US Open. ||  So even with those rules in place, I would wonder if someone could take it to court and said the rules were unfair, because they identified themselves as female and did not want to be discriminated. I would think that the court case would set a precedent, at least in the United States."
tennis,3do5bp,MrJezzaaah,-1,Sat Jul 18 12:07:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think this would be a case of gender being questioned though.

tennis,3do5bp,Quick025,2,Sat Jul 18 05:00:14 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the WTA in particular, but in most of sports a gender verification test is conducted on a case by case basis by a panel of experts.

I hope he wants to be there for the reverse singles because if fighting to keep your country in the Davis Cup isn't going to spur you on, not much else will.

Sure even a #1 like Djokovic can crack but he understands(or at least tells the public he does) that he made a mistake and apologizes. Saying ""I don’t want to be here"" is very bold and him consistently doing stuff like this whenever he is losing isn't really excusable. he did handle himself a little better in the post match interviews though."

They play it for themselves, for money, for their country, and for the fans. They are still human like us but Kyrgios should have more motivation to win. This is obviously not a champion mentality. When Djokovic was down match points against Federer in 2011 he didn't act like he didn't want to be there, he still went all out as if everything was on the line. We don't expect a 5.0 ntrp match among the pros so we shouldn't expect the same mentality either. If Nick retired from the match I'm pretty sure he would have hit headlines everywhere for being the biggest spoiled dick in tennis. You don't retire from a match because ""you are losing and you just don't feel like playing anymore"", you retire because you are actually injured and can not continue playing."

The mental part is the driving force that could possible change a 40-0 match point into a 40-15 or even to win that game. It doesn't matter if at the end you win the match or not.   Edit: I am not trying to diminish the opponent's serve, not at all. I just think that at that point one of the players is more ""connected"" to his game than the other."

tennis,3dr3m0,cuntarsetits,6,Sun Jul 19 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"Nope. Djokovic sucks at doubles, his net game and transition to net just isn't good enough for top quality doubles. Him and Nadal lost to Raonic and Pospisil just a couple years ago and Nadal was carrying most of the weight. It doesn't matter how good you are at singles, doubles is a completely different game. You have to be much more precise on returns, you have to be able to move to net efficiently, you have to actually be able to play at net, and baseline bashing is not the name of the game. Federer would obviously still play well though but if you were to give me a partner for doubles I'd still choose the Bryan Brothers over Federer easily."

We've seen exceptions in the past with singles guys winning vs doubles specialists (see Fed and Stan's Olympics victory vs Bryans), but I think that in general the regular doubles players would win more often than not. Andy and Jamie Murray played doubles together today for GB vs France and Jamie was the better player."
tennis,3dr3m0,Valinor_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:08:30 2015 UTC,But the question is specifically the best 2 players in the world vs the Bryan brothers. I don't know what you think you're disagreeing with unless you've expanded the discussion to random top 100 singles players vs random top 100 doubles players. And based on your own oluympics example it's pretty obvious the answer you responded to is more likely already
tennis,3dr3m0,Hariooo,4,Sat Jul 18 19:45:15 2015 UTC,"Federer's serve and net play would translate into huge weapons in doubles and he would be a solid contender. Djokovic's quickness and defence wouldn't be as pivotal as doubles strategy involves more net play and quick hands than grinding baseline defence. In short, I'm disagreeing with your opinion that Djokovic and Federer would be a good combo because of their respective skills. I believe that only Federer's game translates well to doubles, and as a result of that fact AND the fact that they wouldn't have time to gel together as a team, the Bryans would win fairly comfortably."
tennis,3dr3m0,Valinor_,2,Sat Jul 18 20:00:35 2015 UTC,"Nah, Djokovic is fast but I think you're underestimating the speed of a top doubles match. And Djokovic's net game is pretty awful compared to the rest of his game.

Maybe top 1000 and top 800 at best and she would be lucky to win a single futures tournament. Her first serves would be punished way more and her ""power game"" would be below average, then her movement would absolutely suck."

But I'm not totally sure how juniors determine their ranks. Cici only just entered the pro ranking last year when she won a wildcard entry into the US Open main draw and beat Cibulkova in the first round. Since then I believe she has played a few ITF events.  But as of right now, she still is a junior player. My guess that the junior's rank may not fully recognize all of that. But that's just a shot in the dark guess."

tennis,3dmpdl,jk147,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:30:30 2015 UTC,I wonder why that caused the age to drop though?
tennis,3dmpdl,AliAskari,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:11:31 2015 UTC,"Not dropping, but increasing over time. Players are able to stay competitive longer.  I am not sure why it dropped prior to the 80s. Due to increase in popularity and competition? Tennis players usually peak from 16 to 24."
tennis,3dmpdl,jk147,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:18:00 2015 UTC,There's a pretty pronounced drop from about 77 to 85 before a steady rise.  I think the drop is the notable trend and the rise is just the player base getting used to whatever change caused that drop.
tennis,3dmpdl,AliAskari,6,Fri Jul 17 17:20:59 2015 UTC,"I believe what happened was the transition to graphite, oversized racquets.  Some players never felt fully comfortable hitting with a bigger racquet.  Also, topspin, while used in the 1970s and earlier, gained prominence in the 1980s.  Players like Lendl showed you could swing at the ball much harder if you used topspin, which provided more power, yet more consistency.  Younger players in the 1980s learned to hit with bigger racquets earlier on, and started to use topspin instead of flat and slice shots.  Also, the two handed backhand became more popular during this era, where the slice backhand was considered mostly useful for approaching, but not to dominate a baseline rally.  The rise in age can partly be accounted for players knowing how to train better, stay healthier, deal with injuries, etc., but yes, also from the younger players that were playing a new style just getting older.  The increased physicality of tennis meant that younger players found it hard to instantly gain patience and yet hit the ball hard and have enough stamina.  It's like how there are few teenagers that can really transition into American football because it takes time for their bodies to build up strength and get used to the pounding."
tennis,3dmpdl,dropshot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:41:45 2015 UTC,That makes sense.  So the sudden drop represents the cohort of players who grew up with metal racquets rapidly displacing the cohort of players who used wooden racquets from the pinnacle of the game.  Then the slow rise is just that cohort maturing.
tennis,3dmpdl,AliAskari,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say graphite racquets.  In 1980, most players still used wood racquets (a few used metal racquets, but graphite racquets were starting to become popular).  By 1985, most pros had abandoned wood and played with graphite.  Some made the transition earlier than others.  Graphite also made it possible to make both larger, stronger, and lighter racquets (admittedly, not stronger than metal).  That increased size was what some players had trouble dealing with.  A typical wooden racquet was under 70 square inches.  A typically graphite racquet was 80 square inches, but Prince made them as large as 110 square inches.  Where McEnroe and Connors played mostly flat to slice mixed with some topspin, players like Jimmy Arias, Aaron Krickstein, were hitting with topspin.  Players like Edberg and Becker used the bigger racquets as well (they played around 1984 to the early 1990s).  Wilander, who won the French Open in 1982, was using a graphite racquet around 80 sq. inches.  They were roughly 17 when they broke through and made good results.  This youth movement continued from 1980s (and really included Borg who played in the early 70s) to the early 1990s.  It's useful to watch the 1982 Wimbledon final (Connors vs. McEnroe) and the 1992 Wimbledon final (Agassi vs. Ivanisevic) and see how the power game changed in just 10 years."

tennis,3dmpdl,TweetPoster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:56:52 2015 UTC,The drop seems to be the new younger generation coming into top 100 with graphite racquets and their ability to stay competitive for longer with said racquets which explains the subsequent rise.

When I picked up a racquet around 9 years old, it was the most fun I had playing sports.  I was never the kid who went around to tournaments.  I played in some of the local leagues never making it past fourth or third best on the team until all the players better than me stopped playing.  The sport just makes sense to me.  It's not a contact sport which was good for my body, it is very fast paced (points are scored every 10-30 seconds), there is a clear finish line, and at the absolute core of it all, I just love to swing at the ball and see what I can make it do.

But it's imperfections make it so every time you play is different. Baseball, football, basketball, there are only so many ways to play them. But tennis, you need to learn your opponent and plan out everything as you do it. It's the most cognitive sport. You need to see what you're facing. A slice backhand who places his forehand in all the places you aren't, a masher who can force the ball past you on every shot. It's as much a mental challenge as it is a physical one. Plus nothing beats the feeling of hitting the ball cleanly. When you hit a shot that just feels so smooth, there's no sport like it."

It's truly a fascinating sport where I feel like I control my destiny on every point but at the same time manage to feel absolutely helpless."

I remember mocking her about it a bit before that because she cared so much about watching it. But in 2008 around the time Wozniacki started breaking through (I'm from Denmark so she's quite famous here), I started watching it a bit with her and she learned me the scoring system. The first final I ever watched was Wimbledon men's final 2008. Pretty good first final too see.  Point is, I think I mostly watch it because of my mom. I like talking to her about it and watching it with her. During this year's Wimbledon I pretty much live texted the whole second week while she was away on vacation. Of course I like watching it on my own, but I don't think I'd ever have gotten into it if it wasn't for her. So there's so emotional attachment stuff in it for me besides the entertainment."

Then you have Karlovic and Sock on the other side both of whom will be the heavy favorite going into the final.   I don't know though(about this tournament in general). This tournament just seems like a consolation for Americans knocked out from Wimbledon or those who were ranked too low or did not qualify for Wimbledon. Don't think it would still exist if not for being at ""The hall of fame"" since the only top seed that it attracts each year is Isner and the rest of the field isn't good either. The timing for this tournament just isn't good and the fact that it is the event right after Wimbledon doesn't help either."

This draw is nothing compared to Stuttgart's draw this year where if Isner and Karlovic had played then Isner would have been the 8th seed vs 1st seed and Karlovic would have been unseeded. Then comparing this to the second to least grand ATP 250 grass tournament(s-Hertogenbosch) Karlovic was seeded 5th compared to 2nd."
tennis,3dokij,Tentiture,2,Fri Jul 17 23:36:56 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, there are a good amount of similar threads in this sub that you can search for that cover the topic very well, and offer some good recommendations. I would also encourage you to look at some of the FAQ topics on beginning equipment, as there is a ton of good information in there (although i know it is a bit much to read).  With that being said, I'll throw in my two cents.  To keep it short and sweet i started with the head liquidmetal 8 racket. It is your sterotypical beginner's racket, with a larger than average headsize (112in as compared to the 100in ""standard""), and a weighting that makes it head heavy (feels heavier in the head of the racket than in the handle).  It it also moderately priced in the $85~ range.  I used this racket for 1.5-2 years and have no real complaints about it, other than to me it seemed the strings broke rather frequently (i would attribute most of this more to my combination of string choice, the high string tension this racket uses, and improper care on my part).   When i started playing more frequently, i decided to move up to  the Head Speed MP (Djoker's endorsed racket), and after about a week or so i would say i was ""functionally adjusted"" to the smaller head size, and head-light weighting, although there was still some fine-tuning to be done.      So that's my experience, for what it is worth.  I would say the number one thing you can do in picking a racket is use the demo programs offered by your local shop or tennis warehouse.  They will run you anywhere from 20-30 bucks (or whatever shipping is in the case of tennis warehouse) and you can take home 1-4 rackets to try for a week without breaking the bank, some stores will even put that 20 bucks toward the racket you end up buying.    And finally, no matter what you end up choosing, nothing will help you improve more than just going out there and hitting, even if it is with a shitty walmart racket.    Best of luck, and i hope your search goes well!"
tennis,3dokij,Pepper_J,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:24:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I can't believe I just overlooked the sidebar and didn't see the  FAQ :/ I'm going to drive to a shop and see what their demo program is, and try out some rackets, then probably buy the racket that I like used off eBay."
tennis,3dokij,TheTerp,2,Sat Jul 18 18:07:36 2015 UTC,"I also asked this question when I started out. People recommended the Head liquidmetal 4. It's like the 8, but without the freakishly large headsize. I bought it on eBay practically brand new for about $45. Nice racquet, but I really wanted a Babolat lol  I impulsively bought a Babolat Pure Drive on eBay for $95, and I instantly knew that it was the racquet for me. It's amazing, got good pop on its shots, and it's really stable. You can get a lot of topspin with it too. It's no surprise that it's the #1(I think) selling racquet in the world for competitive players.   I recommend you not limit yourself to the stereotypical racquet. If you do some more research and you see that it'll be a good fit for you then so be it. But find a racquet that you think you'll fall in love with. You want a racquet that will make you want to keep playing day after day.   I would personally recommend a Babolat Pure Drive (or the AeroPro Drive), but that's up to you. It'll be out of your price range new, but you can get it on eBay for a good price. Used racquets are the way to go. Paint scratches and other cosmetic blemishes are non-issues. Just make sure that there are no cracks in the frame.   Most people will advise you to demo racquets out, which I don't think is a necessity. The main reason is that you're relatively new to tennis, so you really don't know what to look for in the racquet. Sure, some racquets are heavier than others, and some racquets are more spin-friendly than others, but those are all things you can read about online, from people who have more experience with different racquets. Just find a racquet that you're going to love, and remember that you'll make yourself a better player. Your racquet doesn't do that."

tennis,3dmsyy,SupaZT,4,Fri Jul 17 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"Someone of your size and likely strength probably should look for a racket within the 95-100 sq. in. head size.  The babolats and wilsons with larger heads usually require more spin to be put on the ball to keep it in play.  I know a fair amount of people really like the Wilson BLX 95 because they are nicely balanced, not super heavy like the 90s and don't require the same amount of spin to be put on the ball that the Babolats do.  For someone of your level, look for a racket that gives you slightly more control than power, so, thinner frame and smaller head size.  If this were Dota, I would say you want a racket similar to Sange and Yasha, gives you some power and speed, but also gives you sustainability within the point and control."
tennis,3dmsyy,TheDudeMeister321,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"I noticed in the tennis racquet guide it says:     a normal adult male who either plays a lot or plans to play a lot, I would recommend a weight in the following ranges regardless of skill level: 300-320g (10.5-11.3 oz).     The Wilson BLX 95 is 12.2oz?. I'm guessing that wouldn't be too heavy?"
tennis,3dmsyy,Elegant_Wild,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:58:24 2015 UTC,"While the BLX 95 is over the recommended weight in the guide, its head-light balance allows a lot more maneuverability than its high static-weight may suggest.  Racquet recommendations are always a bit tricky as you move into tweeners and players' racquets as everyone has their own preferences. Not only in the racquet's weight or swing-balance, but additional characteristics in the head-size, frame stiffness and flexibility, and string patterning.  In the end, you could have a racquet with 'ideal' specifications and not like the way it actually plays so I would recommend extensive demoing (money, time, and patience permitting) to find a racquet you like.  I""ll just end with a few recommendations that I personally enjoyed playing with:   Pacific X Fast Pro Yonex EZONE Ai 98 Prince Textreme Tour 95 Volkl Super G 10"
tennis,3dmsyy,Elegant_Wild,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:57:42 2015 UTC,sounds good... my local tennis shop only has a limited amount of demos but I'll be sure to try all the ones in the 95-100 in head range.   It's just tough to figure out which specs to compare to. I've narrowed down the head sizes but I mean... I'm not sure how to compare balance/stiffness/string patterns/string type when I'm only demoing these synthetic gut tennis racquets.    I'll probably just get the one that was on sale last year for $100
tennis,3dmsyy,Elegant_Wild,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:58:41 2015 UTC,"Completely understandable regarding the demo issue when you're only given limited options in play time, string type, and probably grip sizes. Compounded with the dizzying amount of variation in racquet specs and trying to figure out what attributes you want - I can sympathize and totally get where you're coming from.  It's probably impossible to ascertain the ""one"" racquet through a few demo playthroughs. People honeymoon racquets all the time. They'll thoroughly enjoy the first month or so before realizing it's not the right racquet for them. However, you can only go with what feels right in your hands at that moment.   And really, there's nothing wrong if you end up not liking the racquet as you gain some insight in what you like or don't like about its overall feel to aid in future purchases. The obvious downside is purchasing additional racquets, especially newer models, gets quite expensive with stringing upkeep."

BH slice is one of my key shots both rally and I tend to slice / chip the bh returning first serves so I think 16 x 19 helps with that but interested to see how it goes.  It's a real minefield out there for a buyer from what I have found so far. I have a fairly good idea of what type of racquet suits my play style in terms of weight, stiffness and balance but just so much to choose from each with a ton of marketing guff alongside it makes it harder IMO."
tennis,3do9fi,TacticalTennis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:53:59 2015 UTC,/u/TacticalTennis  Would you recommend a Zus Tennis racquet ahead of any off the shelf racquets to a player who plays 2 times a week? Also play in a competitive singles ladder and the occasional league doubles match at weekends. Or would it be overkill?
tennis,3do9fi,TacticalTennis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:59:35 2015 UTC,"I would say that partly depends on your wants, and partly on what you realistically have access to. Problem #1 is getting off-the-shelf racquets that are actually the same. Someone I'm training right now brought three sticks with him. We took them to to an RDC machine.  The first was supposed to weigh 310g, and it actually weighs 318. The next two were a different brand racquet and were supposed to be identical (Federer Signatures if you must know). They were the same weight, but their balance was not the same and their swingweights were 327 and 341 respectively.  Can I match those two up? Sure - after which their weights will be different. And that was actually a pretty lucky pair. Also keep in mind matching them up will cost money also - you have to find someone with an RDC and pay them to do it.  So to bring it back, if you're not worried if your two 'identical' racquets aren't actually the same then I wouldn't spend the $$. But if tennis is your hobby, and you view it as a 5-10 year investment then to me personally that's worth the dough. I think they feel better than any other racquet I've ever played with, my set of 3 came matches beautifully and I love actually getting the specs that I asked for."
tennis,3do9fi,edduvall,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:40:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up. I'm somewhere in the middle ground as to how serious I take playing it but I got no qualms about chucking cash at something if it leads to a better feeling on court.   It's kinda disconcerting to hear that the Quality Control isn't great on what are $220 racquets from Wilson. Is inconsistency rife across all the main brands?  Does anyone know if Tennis Warehouse would go to the lengths of finding a matching pair for a buyer by testing them both out on an RDC machine before shipping them?
tennis,3dowdr,Troxla9,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:25:00 2015 UTC,"For what you are playing that racquet is way too light and gets pushed around too easily. Since I don't really know anything else about you(flat vs topspin forehand, weak serve vs big serve, approach net at all, general playing level) the only general recommendation I can make is the regular version of the APD if you have the stereotypical big and big forehand. If you can though wait 1-2 months since the new version will be coming out with a good amount of changes from this version and a heavier tour version that you could try too. If you have a more balanced game though with solid shots off both sides then you can try the IG Prestige pro if you are a bigger hitter or the IG Radical pro if you want something more maneuverable(Both of these are discontinued but there are a lot still left on ebay in unused or new condition). If you have flatter shots then the Blade 98 18x20 is great."
tennis,3dowdr,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:48:28 2015 UTC,Topspin forehand. Heavy serve. Approach the net often.
tennis,3dowdr,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:52:23 2015 UTC,"If you don't care about feel for volleys then wait for the new APDs to come out in the next 1-2 months and demo the new APD, the new APD tour, blade 98 16x19(from my experience this is a little more erratic than the APD but is better for hitting big serves), and PS 97(for a balance between net approaches and baseline). If you really care about feel at net or having a well rounded all court game then just pick up the IG prestige pro from ebay. Your shots will still be about as heavy as with any tweener(APD like) frame but you have much less room for error since this frame is 95 sq in and the sweetspot is relatively small even for a 95 sq in frame, can't really be late on shots either, but you'll have more control overall and you'll find volleying and approaches much easier and controlled too. I really did love this racquet but I had to be be playing well for it to work(I don't have a tennis recruiting rating but I'm around a low 2 star based on matches in through tennis season and results against friends who have a rating)."

But kidding aside, what is your game style, what level do you consider yourself and what are some things you don't like about your current racket.  Some of the main parameters to consider are weight, balance point, string pattern.   Weight: Generally speaking (lot of simplifications), a heavier racket gives you more control because there is more mass making contact with the ball so the racket face will be steady on impact. The downside of course is that it is heavier and therefore a bigger challenge to wield. It'll be tougher to do very flicky wristy shots.  Balance point: The closer towards the handle the balance point is (handle heavy or head light), the more control oriented. The head lighted -ness of the racket will help on volleys. The closer towards the head the balance point is (head heavy), the more power oriented. These rackets have a higher ""swing weight"" because most of the mass is at the end and you're swinging the thing like its a hammer. This makes it harder to control, just imagine swinging a hammer at the ball and the ball bounces a little different than expected and you had to adjust. The upside is there is more impact force so you can hit the ball harder.  String pattern: The two most common patterns are 16x18 and 18x20. The more open pattern (16x18) allows for more bite on the tennis ball and generates more spin. The more closed pattern allows for less movement and therefore less friction and the strings tend to last longer before breaking.  Anyway, that should give you enough to get started on your journey. As a reference, Federer uses a very heavy racket that is handle heavy, and has a small racket face. Basically everything control oriented. I think Nasal uses a much lighter racket and an average sized racket face and the balance point is more even to accommodate his big swing groundstrokes game.  Good luck!"

Go expensive on the strings since you are new to the game and don't hit very hard, they will last a while. No reason to upgrade to a players racket and put crap strings in it. It's worth the money to put good strings on your racket.   So... Babolat pure drive, with Luxilon ALU mains and Wilson NXT crosses."

tennis,3dkpn1,Legendan,9,Fri Jul 17 01:32:11 2015 UTC,may I ask what the settlement was about?
tennis,3dkpn1,NSvoltage,17,Fri Jul 17 02:14:03 2015 UTC,Babolat was advertising that pro players were using identical racquets to the ones on the market. Turns out they weren't.   More info here: http://www.classactionrebates.com/settlements/babolat/
tennis,3dkpn1,gg_2015,4,Fri Jul 17 03:00:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you know the answer (tennis racket noob here btw), but I want to ask what was the difference between consumer rackets and the professional versions. Do other brands also do this (ie. the Wilson RF97 edition)? I don't really care much for the difference, just wondering if it's the build quality of the racket or something else."
tennis,3dkpn1,SafinisGOAT,5,Fri Jul 17 04:11:15 2015 UTC,"long long story short: difference is major for the major racquet companies like Head and Wilson. Other companies do not make pro specific frames, strange enough I'm pretty sure Babolat is one of them. Rest assured the difference is not build quality, it is play characteristics.   RF97 is rather unique that it is actually pretty close to what Fed uses except grip and some lead."
tennis,3dkpn1,ViolentWanderer,3,Fri Jul 17 04:40:55 2015 UTC,"follow-up question, if you don't mind: what's the problem with just selling us normal people the same racquet the pros are using but just with less weight? I mean, yes, if i tried playing with a 364g racquet my arm would probably fall off after 20 minutes. can't it just be a lighter version or would that screw up the playability completely?"
tennis,3dkpn1,dropshot,5,Fri Jul 17 09:20:26 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that pros don't want to change their racquets as often as they manufacturers want them to.  Federer was allegedly changing his racquets every 3 years, but I think he stuck, more or less, to the same design with minor tweaks.  The main changes were paint jobs made to look like the newer model.  This has been happening forever, sometimes to humorous effect.  Davydenko had a contract with Dunlop, but used Prince (with their O-holes) for months, with the racquet disguised as a Dunlop (not effective).  He was never able to find a Dunlop that he was happy with, and they ultimately parted ways (Davydenko was never the huge draw that Federer or Nadal were so despite being a top ranked player, he did without lucrative contracts--unfortunately, Davydenko never reached the heights that he got to at the end of 2009 to the start of 2010.  Pros are very finicky when it comes to racquets (see del Potro as an extreme example, who continued to use a discontinued frame despite Wilson's desire to get him to use something newer).  I suspect they also think, once they get a lighter version, then they are already making changes from the original, so why not build something that has broader appeal."
tennis,3dkpn1,1amathrowaway,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:30:38 2015 UTC,"If a pro has a custom made racquet, that racquet is not going to be good for the general public. Companies need to appeal to a broader audience rather than just what that one pro wanted.  Imagine you get fit for a custom suit/dress. You can't put that exact garment out for retail for everyone to buy. Instead you need to figure out who your ""average"" customer is and make a racquet for them.  Racquet companies figure out who their average:  -Beginner who needs more power  -Beginner who needs more control  -Intermediate player who needs more power  etc.  And just make separate models for them instead of selling the custom pro models that might only fit that player."
tennis,3dkpn1,jk147,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:17:32 2015 UTC,"This goes for golf as well, pretty much every sport that involves hitting with an object.

tennis,3dkpn1,RegularFreddieWilson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:59 2015 UTC,"I have a reply above that goes into more detail, but pro stock rackets are actually built lighter. They're made lighter so that weight can be added to suit the player's taste. That way, the player can get the frame they want and then customize it to the weight they want rather than the frame being tied to a specific weight/balance. There isn't much room to customize on rackets that are sold to the public."
tennis,3dkpn1,RegularFreddieWilson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:44:46 2015 UTC,Yonex does it as well. They still send out some PimPims.
tennis,3dkpn1,RegularFreddieWilson,2,Fri Jul 17 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"This is probably TMI, but whatever. I'm sure someone will be interested.There are three major differences between Pro stock rackets and public rackets.   Pro stock rackets are actually made lighter than the public versions. This is so that weight can be added to suit specific players taste. For some, silicone will be injected into the handle and lead tape will be applied to the head. This is so that several pros can use the same pro stock frame, but still have custom weight and balance to suit them. For example, Andy Murray uses the same racket that Fabrice Santoro, Arnaud Clement, and dozens of other pros have and still use, but they all have different weight/balance for their specific ones once the lead and silicone is added.  Materials. Some pro stock rackets use more expensive material that isn't practical or profitable for mass production. The only example I know of is that the Head pt57A (Murray's racket) still uses Twaron when being made.  A lot of pro stock rackets are based on older molds. Many of the Head and Wilson pro stock rackets are based on models from the 90s. For example, the Head pt57A is basically a prestige 630, pt57E is basically an iPrestige mp, and the Wilson h19 is basically a pt57A clone. All of these were designed in the 90s and have a feel that is highly desired among top players, but not as desired among the public. Some younger players use only mildly outdated models. It's not just rackets from the 90s though. There are pro who use rackets from mid 2000 to even some that use brand new models."

This match was the greatest show of athleticism in the history of our sport but it wasn't the greatest show of tennis.  For me that would have to be the 07/08 Wimbledon finals.

tennis,3dmhvk,avaliantheel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:11:39 2015 UTC,"much can be attributed to the court, AO is a slow hardcourt and well grass is grass.

tennis,3dluiv,theLoneliestAardvark,8,Fri Jul 17 14:03:28 2015 UTC,It's not like Raonic and Pospisil just decided not to play. They are injured. There are still a lot of years when the top players play.
tennis,3dluiv,Sebastien447,6,Fri Jul 17 14:30:10 2015 UTC,"There are top players every year who are unable/unwilling to play because of the grind of the tour, or injured. If you enjoy watered-down DC then you're all set but I'm not that interested in watching #491 Peliwo getting a tennis lesson from Goffin."
tennis,3dluiv,MCallanan,6,Fri Jul 17 14:43:18 2015 UTC,"What makes you think it would be any different, in regard to injury, if it was held once every four years? Raonic was injured during the clay season, Pospisil was injured at Wimbledon. Those men wouldn't be playing Davis Cup today regardless of whether it was held yearly or every four years.     Tennis already has an event every four years where you go to represent your country it's called the Olympics."
tennis,3dluiv,Sebastien447,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:52:44 2015 UTC,"You have to realize that often players feel compelled to claim an injury as the reason for missing DC  to take the heat off them for not playing it. If DC were held every 4 years it would be more special and players likely to make more of an effort to play it ... could be staggered with the Olympics, one every 2 years."
tennis,3dluiv,MCallanan,7,Fri Jul 17 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"Yes and then it would be commercialized and small countries like the Dominican Republican, who desperately rely on the money generated by yearly Davis Cup events, would be left with no money. It could also diminish the legacy of Davis Cup. Fans need to stop looking at soccer as a blueprint to 'fix' Davis Cup. Two entirely different sports and what's good for the goose isn't always what's good for the gander.     Yes Federer and Wawrinka decided to skip this years Davis Cup. And unfortunately Djokovic, Raonic and Pospisil were unable to play this weekend due to injury and or fatigue. But more so than not the top players on tour have participated in Davis Cup. Look no further than Queens Club where 20% of the top 15 men's players will be in action over the next three days.     There's no doubt Davis Cup needs some tweaking to catch up with the modern day sport. However, this idea that Davis Cup is dead generally always comes from the perspective of North Americans. The popularity of tennis in general here in the states has been dwindling for years. That's a tennis problem not a Davis Cup specific problem. To make the problem worse the USTA has made terrible decisions with the handling of Davis Cup which has scared away sponsors and others that could make Davis Cup more of a spectacle than it has been.     You need not look any further than last years Davis Cup attendances, some of which were record setting, in Italy, Switzerland, France, et al. to see that Davis Cup is alive and well throughout Europe."

His game is so explosive and he is so charismatic. Unfourtunately he is just too much of a smug cunt nowadays. I'm not racist but if anyone ever deserves to be called a thug it's Kyrgios.

I mean shit I only get a giggle out of cancer jokes because my brother does as well.

tennis,3dktgf,ydna_eissua,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:22:43 2015 UTC,Yes you add up the points of all the players of the country.
tennis,3dktgf,dropshot,3,Fri Jul 17 15:42:41 2015 UTC,"Using points seems like a bad way to measure a country's strength.  Consider Serbia.  They have 4 players in the top 100.  If you add the bottom 3 players, it adds up to 1700 points (roughly).  Then, there's Djokovic at nearly 14,000 points.  Indeed, if Djokovic was the only player in that list, then Serbia's strength would still be quite high.  Another way (which has its drawback) is to count players from a country in the top 100, or possibly compute their average rank (which can hurt a country like Serbia because two players are ranked in the 90s, and the average would be better if they were outside the top 100).  Spain still has 12 players in the top 100, so that's still quite good.  There's no one that's young-ish (maybe Carreno Busta).    France is in a similar situation with only one young player (Pouille).  So far, the country that seems to have a good number of young players is Australia with Kokkinakis, Tomic, and Kyrgios.  The oldest Australian player in the top 100 is Groth at 27."

There was a shot from the French Open QF against Novak where the camera zooms in close on his face while he watches a ball fall from really high, and he is hoping it will land in. He had a look of hopeless desperation, it was really sad. I don't know what happened to him, and I don't know what he needs to do to come back, but I think he should really consider a new coach. A new regiment. He needs to shake things up, he has been stagnating for too long now."

Balding is fairly traumatic for men as it's the most visible reminder (by far) of our own mortality.  Nadal also peaked early. He doesn't seem to enjoy tennis that much now. I think the turning point was the USO final when he won second set (I think it was) and knelt and just screamed at the ground.

tennis,3dkr88,Personacorona,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:47:30 2015 UTC,"You must be joking if u think 2011 was peak Rafa then. His serve paled in comparison to his 2010 form and forehand wasn't as big either. 65+% first serves that were 120 mph+ with the occsional 130 mph+. Noone can really attack that consistently but in 2011 Rafa dropped some speed on his serve which gave Djokovic more opportunities to attack even on first serve. And who would have dominated in 2013 if Rafa didn't exist. Thats right, Djokovic again. But an amazing Rafa stopped a french open and us open series."
tennis,3dkr88,PokeMyPillow,0,Fri Jul 17 15:23:46 2015 UTC,"forehand wasn't as big either   Rafa hit his forehand hardest in 2011. Go back and watch footage of 2011 matches. His forehand was nuts.    65+% first serves that were 120 mph+ with the occsional 130 mph+.   At the US Open, yeah, but Rafa never hit his serve that big consistently. 2011 Rafa's serve was about the same speed as the regular 2010 Rafa's serve.    And who would have dominated in 2013 if Rafa didn't exist. Thats right, Djokovic again   Yes, because Djokovic would actually have zero competition. Ferrer, the 3rd player in the world, had 5800 points. That's nothing. But he was not playing nearly as well as he was in 2011 or is in 2015. It's not hard to see that.   I think sometimes it's hard to see that you don't have to win anything to still be playing the best tennis of your life. I know it's a weird concept, but it's true. Rafa was in his peak in 2011. He didn't win everything. But that's because of Novak. If Novak didn't exist Rafa would have won 3 slams in a row, and would have won all 3 of the clay court Masters AND the IW and Miami double. That's more than what Rafa in 2010 did, and that for sure was his peak. So why wasn't Rafa at his peak in 2011? Because he couldn't beat Novak? That's a shit argument. I understand, it's hard to admit that a peak Rafa lost 7 times in a row to a peak Djokovic, but that's what 2011 was."
tennis,3dkr88,Personacorona,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:01:27 2015 UTC,"Literally the same thing could be said about 2013. And i never ever said rafa was not in his peak in 2011 beacude he lost to Djokovic. He wasn't because everything was subpar to 2010(an actual peak year) where he didn't drop a set at Roland Garros and had a huge serve all throughout the latter half of the season that even got him to his first WTF Final. He also hit his forehand flat more often with more confidence in 2010 vs in 2011 where it was still good but landed short slightly more(watched Rafa's match from this time period a lot more so than the 2013-2014 period) I understand its hard to admit Djokovic got devastated by Rafa in 2013 but thats whats 2013 was. a semi peak Rafa compared to 2010 or 2008 but still enough to edge out a prime Djokovic on clay(keep in mind Djokovic also gave Rafa his first loss in monte carlo that year, djokovic was playing amazing to do such a thing)and North american hard courts."

It took him another grueling 5-sets against a mono-infested Fed to win in Australia. I'd give Rafa credit for 2008 Wimbledon, but after that, Fed went on a slow decline (or more likely a fast dip in form, then slow rebound to current #2 level).  It's a toss-up for me as well for Nadal vs Djoker, because Djoker adjust to each opponent. He doesn't really struggle against any opponent. He'll lose once in a while, but then he'll find a way to beat you, and probably beat you 10 straight. I'd say Djoker is at his absolute peak now, physically and mentally. I think he can beat Nadal on any surface, including clay."

If Rafa thinks a change of coach could be good for him, he will then do it"" said Toni.  ""I don't feel responsible for Rafa's results. I am not responsible for his victories, and I am not responsible for his losses..."" [said] Toni.   I agree with what the article quoted. Uncle Toni  was pretty fair, the clickbait title is trimmed down in a way that seems like he was tastelessly brushing off his responsibility.  The article quotes were fairly comprehensive on the matter but a quick look at the author's twitter page confirmed it's the author's style to create click-bait titles. Wouldn't get too worked up about it."
tennis,3djaar,wonwong,4,Thu Jul 16 19:53:42 2015 UTC,"The person returning resembles a goal keeper now and has the same position. I think there should be found a solution so that the qualities are more important than just power. Federer and Dimitrov take advantage from their serve and I do understand that and am fine with it. But it is better if we are the one with the advantage.   That's pretty interesting. He's claiming that good servers have unfair advantage. One then could argue that Nadal's reliance on extreme top spin for his ground strokes was also ""unfair"".  Also interesting why Toni would single out Federer and Dimitrov (!), of all people. There are way more powerful servers than Federer. And Dimitrov? Just doesn't make sense."

tennis,3dlpn4,bjquick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:53:02 2015 UTC,"If you have any friends who play with said racquets, consider asking to borrow them for a hit or two; any playtesting is preferable to none.  Of the racquets you chose, the Aeropro and Pure Drive are slightly lighter, at 300g unstrung, while the Extreme and Pro Staff will be heavier.  You'll probably find the two Babolat racquets a little easier to whip through contact with a bit more perceived power, at the cost of a little solidity and stability.  The Extreme and the Pro Staff are still plenty powerful, but will require a bit more effort to get up to speed.  Unfortunately, the differences are small enough that anecdotes from strangers can only take you so far.  There's plenty of happy one-handers using all of the racquets you listed, and you can certainly play great tennis with any of them.  You could also buy a used racquet, which will save you some cash and probably net you a smaller loss if you change your mind and want to switch racquets again.  A lot of players' preferences change as they improve, so it's nice to have that flexibility should you want it.  I'm no expert on Australian classifieds but here is someone selling two for 240AUD, for example, which is a pretty reasonable price so long as the condition is okay.  You could probably find a similar deal in your area."

tennis,3dhsp2,Isaacsv,14,Thu Jul 16 11:31:31 2015 UTC,"People have said this for a long time, but I doubt it's going to happen.  The enforcement, as they have it, is doing a better job, so I think that is good enough for the ATP.  The reason I don't think it will happen is because players will say there are all sorts of reasons that they will use more than 25 seconds.  For example,   A long point leaving both players tired A potential weather interruption (is it starting to rain, did it just drip) Racquet change (Federer doesn't like to change racquets only on changeovers--he tries to do it a game before the ball change). Audience issues (someone faints, or yells out as a player is about to serve) Challenges Arguments with umpires   The fact is, even sports that have clocks, have time outs.  Basketball frequently has time outs to stop play, but no one seems to think that's a problem. Players can also get rest if they're getting tired.  If you have shot clocks, you'll probably have to give a number of timeouts, and possibly discretion of the umpire when to start the clock (or pause it).  Anyway, people have complained a while, and the new rules, while imperfect, have sped the game up, so as much as announcers complain, I don't see it changing that much."
tennis,3dhsp2,dropshot,4,Thu Jul 16 12:50:20 2015 UTC,"tired? oh waaaah. in most sports this is called an adv for the better conditioned player  weather? uh if weather's an issue a clock won't be  racket change? well i guess they'll have to adjust accordingly  audience issues? pretty sure a clock can be stopped  challenges? see above  arguments? looks a cost/benefit analysis might be in order   the fact is tennis is laden with built in stoppages. if a player can't play tennis for 10 minutes with 25 sec breaks between each pt then the word ""athlete"" need not apply to him/her"
tennis,3dhsp2,fatcatdonimo,7,Thu Jul 16 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"Basketball frequently has time outs to stop play, but no one seems to think that's a problem.  Players can also get rest if they're getting tired.   When basketball does have a stoppage (basket scored, ball out of bounds), once the ball has been retrieved and ready to be put into play, the team has five seconds to inbound the ball.   A player cannot take 10-15 seconds because he is tired.  So while there are frequent stoppages in the NBA, there are enforced limits as to how long the breaks are.  So it's not quite the same.  I've seen Nadal's opponent double-fault, Nadal spending no energy at all.  Then Nadal goes to towel off for 20-30 seconds before the next point.  Ridiculous."
tennis,3dhsp2,Vvector,4,Thu Jul 16 13:52:28 2015 UTC,A similar issue that the ITF has with this is that there are discrepancies in when the clock should starts. Is it as soon as an out call is made? Is it when a player calls for the towel? Is it when the server has a ball in his hand? Is it when the server addresses the baseline? Too many options.
tennis,3dhsp2,tcptennis,4,Thu Jul 16 13:54:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of people complain about the number of timeouts in basketball games (particularly college). The main reason being that it makes the last 30 seconds of a game take 20 minutes, and that it leads to over-coaching and taking the game out of the player's hands. A lot of people on /r/nba and /r/collegebasketball have mentioned solutions which include limiting the amounts of timeouts used per half or decreasing total timeouts."

tennis,3dhsp2,hello2you,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:02:23 2015 UTC,"They have to do what they do in poker which is shot clock + time bank. So when your clock expires your time bank starts and if you have no time left then you check/fold.   So, I'd suggest 25 sec clock + ~5 min of time in the bank that gets replenished every ~30 points. For some points you are tired and you can go over without penalty as long as you have time in the bank. But for most points you are going to be fine and should be under 25 seconds. This takes umpire discretion away and stops all the stupid arguments about player x taking 2 more seconds."
tennis,3dhsp2,larrydavid_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"I wish they would introduce the clock. People who go on about Djokovic and Nadal playing for 6+ hours at the Aussie. Yeah, but why did it take that long? Because of all the fucking about. It's cheating in my opinion."
tennis,3dhsp2,dlouisbaker,5,Thu Jul 16 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, although it's tough for me to call it cheating when they don't see the clock. I think the time rule needs to be enforced, but players need to be able to see the clock for it to be enforced fairly. I agree with some that certain circumstances should allow exceptions or extensioms, such as unruly crowds delaying the point, waiting for hawkeye, etc. But why have a rule if it will be enforced almost randomly, and most umpires that enforce it wait until late in a match, when it's a high pressure/tension situation, and it ruins the moment/is inconsistent"

tennis,3djlui,t4liff,3,Thu Jul 16 21:37:49 2015 UTC,"While he is arguably in peak form in his play, look how hard it has been for him to win more than 1 slam in a year. In 2011, he managed to win 3, and this year he's won at least 2, and very possibly 3 again. But what happened 2012, 2013, and 2014? Only 1 each year, 3/12 overall.  So in the next 2 years, how likely will he win half the majors? The question can't be answered by Djokovic, but by the rest of the field. I know Djokovic will bring his A-game every time, and the only chance he can lose is if his opponent outplays him. It's hard to do and won't happen consistently at this point, but Wawrinka, Federer, Nishikori, and Murray have beat him at the majors.  The argument is sound. His biggest rivals (Fed/Nadal) are older and getting harder to keep up with Djokovic. Sort of how difficult it is to beat Nadal over 5 sets as opposed to 3, it's hard to take 3 sets from Djoko in a major. I like Wawrinka a lot, and he probably stands the best chance since he's beaten him twice en route to actually winning the titles. And while he is also getting on the other side of 30, Stanimal might be one of the only ones who can give Djoko trouble in the next 10 majors should they meet.  Murray was dominant in 2013, but he's fallen back. His game is certainly improved, but mentally he seems to again be lagging behind Djokovic, and I don't know if he'll break through again. Of course if you got the game, you always have the chance. Murray has pushed Djokovic this year even as he's coming back from injuries. The younger guys haven't even been consistent QF/SFist yet, so I don't expect them to contend.  I think Djoko will eventually win 5 more, tying Sampras. I believe he will surpass him even, and maybe Nadal (if he stay at 15). I just don't think it'll happen in the next 2 years (when he's 30). If he plays 5 more years, if he wants to, then he's gonna approach those Federer/Nadal/Sampras numbers."
tennis,3djlui,gg_2015,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"I think what we're seeing here is an exact repeat 4 years ago. Djokovic is probably going to win the U.S. open and is definitely going to have the best season since 2011. Next year, I think Federer will stay at the same level, Murray will too(maybe a mental improvment), Nadal will surge back, and Djokovic's level will drop. The result? A year like 2012(even has the Olympics too)."
tennis,3djlui,Personacorona,2,Thu Jul 16 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"I'm expecting the same from Djokovic and Murray.  I hope Roger can keep his Wimbledon form for the next year but realistically that's a pipe dream.  If Nadal is going to come back, I think he will take almost all of the year to get back in form.  He's a step or two slow to the ball, and he had a bad back and wrist last year.  I think 2010/2013 Nadal is a thing of the past and that Nadal's best bet to return into the top 4 is to learn to play around his new physical limitations.  If his serve improves and he can find a way to keep points and matches shorter than he has in his career, he will stick around for a few more years."
tennis,3djlui,avaliantheel,2,Thu Jul 16 22:21:32 2015 UTC,"You know what would be fun to watch? Djoker, Nadal, and Federer all playing into their deep 30s. We've witnessed all the battles, blood, and tears when they're at their absolute peaks, but it'll be neat to see a bunch of old warriors fighting off the younger guys. I can't call Djoker and Nadal old yet, since they're not in their mid 30s like Fed is about to be, but they'll be there soon.  There were a lot of good players back then playing simultaneously, but never have we seen exactly 2 (and then 3) guys dominate the majors like this. There's been no shortage of good players the past decade, guys who definitely would be majors winners in a different era (Ferrer, Berdych, Nalbandian, etc). Stan and Murray would likely have much more for sure. Maybe Cilic and Del Potro with their power and hard court excellence. Yet it's been those 3 guys (now with a combined 40 slams!). To win you have to beat at least 1, if not 2 of those guys in the span of 3 days. A near impossible task.  I hope Fed continues to grace us with his elegant and beautiful tennis, and for Nadal to find his way back like he's always done in matches and grand slams. Djoker will be here for a while. Sorry Raonic, Kyrgios, Dimitrov, Coric. One day you might reach that status, but for now, I'm gonna try to revel in this golden era for as long as possible."

I'm not an expert on how athletes age, but is there a huge difference between 33 and 34? And also, Fed's style was built to last. And it's Roger Federer we're talking about here. As long as he's healthy, I don't see why he can't keep up the same form.  Regarding Rafa, I'd say the biggest thing he needs to do is gain confidence in that forehand. If it's firing like it was in 2010/2013, he will again be at the top of the sport. Nadal's serve was never his strong point, and his backhand hasn't been too shabby this year."

Roger's and Djokovic now is more game-by-game. His serve wasn't weak by any means, but I agree Nadal has to improve that area the most to get those easy points. Roger served as well as he's served at Wimbledon in years, and obviously Djokovic has improved his serve massively. That reason alone is why they're #1 and #2. Murray's serve has held him back, among other things."

tennis,3djlui,Personacorona,3,Fri Jul 17 04:02:18 2015 UTC,"We shall see at the U.S Open. For some reason, after last year, I feel it is a much more open competition. Perhaps Nishikori and Cilic wouldn't repeat their surprise final runs. Other slam winners Wawrinka and Del Potro are always a good opponents when they're healthy and on.  I doubt Nadal will go far, even though he did win just 2 yrs ago (seems like an eternity ago). I hope he makes it to the second week at least. Djokovic has still got to be the overwhelming favorite, even though he's been so underwhelming there (only 1 title?). I guess it is tougher on Fed now even though he made 6 straight finals once (and won 5 straight). Hope the draw is nice to Fed. Murray won his first here of course, but he still has issues dealing with Fed and Djoker. His form doesn't seem to be peaking as it did in 2012, even though he's been a pretty consistent semifinalist this year."

It is a lot easier to dominate across surfaces in the last 10 years because of how similarly they are starting to play. You start to really respect Borg's accomplishments when you consider the sloooow clay surface at Roland Garros and the infinitely faster grass at 70s Wimby (which now plays slower than the U.S)
tennis,3dircg,lwcreasy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"Did Laver ever play on hardcourts? I know the US Open was clay until the 70s, not sure about the Australian. I see what you mean about the surfaces being very different back then, even without the hardcourts though."
tennis,3dircg,gibisee4,3,Thu Jul 16 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"No, he never did win a major on hard courts. Probably would have if he had the chance. Had that all-around game that is so rare. I'm not even one of those old-school Laver fanboys, either. I promise. Just put him at 2 (for now) because of the versatility. If you can win at every surface you play on, and can hit basically every shot in the book, thats enough to measure greatness imo."
tennis,3dircg,lwcreasy,2,Thu Jul 16 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, would have liked to see him come around 10 years later, so he wouldn't have to deal with all that amateurism BS.

The fact is, players now are faster, stronger, and more athletic in every sense. Sure, a lot of that can be attributed to modern technology, training, and nutrition, but we can't know for sure just how good Laver and Borg would be if they had all these modern advantages. So I think it wouldn't be fair to put those guys ahead of modern greats, simply based on a hunch that they would be better (better than modern greats) with modern technology."
tennis,3dircg,Jobin1616,3,Thu Jul 16 21:37:49 2015 UTC,"That's one definition.  Another way to look at it is Nadal would get crushed with wooden racquets because his game is so topspin- and baseline-heavy.  Nadal vs Laver with wooden racquets in their primes, I'd take Laver easily."
tennis,3dircg,YaoPau,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:50:20 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting perspective, but imagine Laver vs Nadal on a clay court today. That'd probably be a similar situation but in favour of Rafa. If Nadal had been born in Laver's time and tailored his game to those surfaces, he may have won many slams in the 60s because he's extremely talented. Same goes for Laver if he was born later. But since we can't truly know, I don't think it's fair to put Laver above the likes Nadal or Federer if we're just basing it on the possibility that he could've matched them, were he given the same technology."
tennis,3dircg,Jobin1616,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"I was there with you until the conclusion.  The old guys spent their entire lives focusing on playing with wooden racquets on wood/grass courts.  No current player is picking up a wooden racquet, traveling to 1960 and immediately winning a pro Slam.  No 1960s player would win a Slam today.  Completely different game, different equipment, different surfaces ... in a way it's kinda like ranking badminton players and ping pong players together.  No reason IMO to put one group over another, and you can't penalize a player for being born in the wrong year."
tennis,3dircg,YaoPau,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:53:48 2015 UTC,"I think that regardless of their playing styles, both Nadal and Laver just have a certain talent with a tennis racquet. Same goes for all great champions of the game. That's why I believe it's possible that they could've been great in any era if they were born then and they forged their games based on tactics geared towards said era. But my main point is, if we MUST compare players from all eras, it's unfair to put Laver and the other old legends above the champions of '95 - present, because the only basis for it is that they might hypothetically have been better with modern technology, but it's only hypothetical.  Edit: I actually agree with you about that it's not fair to rank players from different eras because of how different the game has become, but that's what OP asked for."
tennis,3dircg,Jobin1616,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:32:20 2015 UTC,"Of course players nowadays are more athletic and like I said in another comment we shouldn't speculate as to what the players would be like in todays game, it's just hypothetical speculation.  BUT in the time of Borg he dominated along with McEnroe, etc. I think one can totally compare across eras. You just have to look at how they did in their era.  50 years from now Federer's 17 GS's might look like nothing and there may be players way ""better"" than him in an athletic sense. So do we then say, I'm not putting Federer in this discussion because his era was different technology, who knows how he would do now, etc. No, we would always keep Federer in the discussion no matter how good the current generations get because in Federer's era, he, along with the big 4, dominated.  edit: it's the same reason we don't compare the women to the men. Of course Serena wouldn't be in the top 50 players of all time if she also played men but you have to look at what she did with her respective competition, and in that sense she is the best ever."

tennis,3dircg,t4liff,4,Thu Jul 16 18:15:04 2015 UTC,Why Agassi over Borg or Connors though? Was tennis still too different in the 70's and early 80's?
tennis,3dircg,gibisee4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:23:39 2015 UTC,Yes. I honestly don't think Borg/Connors could compete in the modern era with their games. At least they wouldn't dominate the way they did. If they were born today who knows ? But as it stands there's no comparison.
tennis,3dircg,t4liff,2,Thu Jul 16 18:50:04 2015 UTC,Do you think Sampras would be as good today though? The grass at Wimbledon where he got half his slams is a lot slower over the last 10 years. I'd say the quality of returners have gotten a lot better too.

Federer is far and away the best of his era ergo no others can be mentioned from current players.  When you look at what the others accomplished Laver should be #1 winning the grand slam before the open era and after the open era but who in their right mind can say Federer isn't the best to ever pick up a racket.  Am I right?
tennis,3dircg,10s_pro,4,Thu Jul 16 21:49:28 2015 UTC,"Emerson was 18-49 against Laver, 1-5 against Rosewall, he even lost to a 40yo Pancho in their only match ... never played against top competition until the Open Era and couldn't win when he did face top competition ... nowhere close to the best player of his generation."
tennis,3dircg,YaoPau,0,Thu Jul 16 23:18:00 2015 UTC,He won 12 grand slams and 28 total including doubles. By the time the open era showed up he was 32 years old and still won Wimbledon in 71. How is that not worthy of being in the discussion of top 5?
tennis,3dircg,10s_pro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:37:31 2015 UTC,"Because none of those Slams came on the pro tour, he was always an amateur.

The playability that poly has is also something that can't be replicated with other strings due to the nature of the string allowing snapback effects enhancing spin and also allowing you to hit out on the ball.

Overall the rest of the field is still at about the same level if not a little worse except Wawrinka who is still very inconsistent for a top player. But we lost at least semi-peak Nadal/Federer and peak Murray. Djokovic has been in his peak years this whole time, its just the others fell off so its even more evident now. I'd say peak Nadal and Federer are still better than peak Djokovic, at the moment Djokovic doesn't have any other competition(partially since he is too good but also partially since everyone else is kinda sucking) while in other years we had Federer-Nadal to contest eachother and the big 4 in general to contest eachother."
tennis,3djxnb,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:40:09 2015 UTC,"Bear with me, because this is going to be long.   So this year's Djokovic would have dominated against Nadal in 2008/2010/2013   Yes, he would have, because 2011 Rafa was prime Rafa, and Djokovic had no problem taking him out then.    Federer in 2004-2007   Probably not 2004-2006, but probably 2007 Federer.   Overall the rest of the field is still at about the same level if not a little worse except Wawrinka who is still very inconsistent for a top player   Surely you must be joking. Stan, when he's on, is about as good as it gets in terms of tennis ability. When he's off, he's not even worth being a top 50 player. The rest of the field isn't as inconsistent, so they are better. Their peaks may not be as high but their lows are so much better.   But we lost peak Murray   Murray said it himself, he is playing some of the best tennis of his life. If that isn't peak Murray, then I don't know what is.    semi-peak Federer   Semi-peak Federer was 2007-2009. With 2010 as the middle year, 2011-2015 Roger is post prime Roger. So he's had the same level of Roger to compete with throughout his prime. And I'll give you Nadal, but this is one year. And given how Djokovic never lost to Nadal in 2011, it's safe to say that Rafa would be almost a non-factor this year anyway.    Djokovic has been in his peak years this whole time, its just the others fell off    Not like this year though. After the Wimbledon final, I'm sure it's safe to say that he is playing his best tennis since 2011. He is so solid, so consistent, and so aggressive. In 2011, Novak may have been a better defender, but 2015 Novak is so much more aggressive and has a better second serve.   at the moment Djokovic doesn't have any other competition(partially since he is too good but also partially since everyone else is kinda sucking)   I agree, Novak doesn't have competition. But it's not because others are sucking. It's because he is on another planet at the moment. The field sucking part is the part that I don't get. Let's look at who Novak had to beat in order to win his titles. They are: Murray, Federer, Murray, Berdych, Federer, Federer. Let's look at who he's lost to in finals: Federer and Wawrinka. Besides Berdych, he has had to beat the #2 and #3 players in the world to win his titles. The people he has lost to are multiple slam winners and the #2 and #4 people in the world. If the #2 and #3 people are good enough to make it to finals(7 for Roger and 5 for Murray) then how does the field suck? It would suck if Djo was beating people like Mannarino and Gulbis to win his titles. But instead, he's beating 2 of the top 3 players in the world. Your logic in saying that the others suck is the same logic used to call Federer's prime era weak: since Roger was winning everything, then the field must have sucked. But this didn't account for the quality of tennis Federer was playing. And using the logic today doesn't account for the quality of tennis Djokovic is playing. I think the difference in our opinions boils down to this: You see Djokovic winning everything and think, ""wow the field must suck."" I see Djokovic winning everything and think, ""Man, he is playing unreal tennis."" But this thought process could be used to describe Rafa's 2013, when he had reached 9 finals out of the 9 tournaments he had played in. So, then, was the field in 2013 weak? I'm sure many would disagree, even though he beat Nalbandian, Ferrer, Del Potro, Almagro, 2013 Wawrinka, 2013 Federer, and Ferrer to win his 7 titles and lost to Zeballos and Djokovic. The people he beat are  hardly quality opponents, but still, the field was not weak in 2013. Was the field weak in 2011, when Djokovic literally had only lost one match at this point in time? I'm sure many would disagree was well. So now it boils down to the failure to recognize that this year is another 2011. And now it also boils down to personal thought that the field must suck because of Djokovic winning everything in 2015. And this might be a result of bias, but I'm not going to try to stereotype a group of 27,000 people. In the end, you are discrediting Djokovic and casting the blame on Fed, Muzz, and Stan for losing.   while in other years we had Federer-Nadal to contest each other and the big 4 in general to contest each other.   Who do we have this year? Djokovic, Federer, and Murray to contest each other. And then there's Stan. Given his form, I'd say it's fair to temporarily add him to a 2015 Big 4. Obviously Nadal will always be the other member of the Big 4(next to Djo, Fed, and Muzz), but this year, he is struggling badly, and Stan has shown himself worthy to be the 4th best player in the world. So, this year, I'd say he's earned it.  My final words are this: Djokovic is playing unreal tennis. But because he is winning everything, no matter the tennis he is playing, the field is bad. Does this seem unfair to only me? This gives no credit to the form that Djokovic is in, and instead says ""it's Fed, Muzz, and Stan's fault for losing"" rather than ""it's not the aforementioned's fault that Djokovic is too good right now.""   To sum up: The field in 2015 is not weak. Djokovic is instead making it look weak."
tennis,3djxnb,Personacorona,3,Fri Jul 17 03:02:40 2015 UTC,"So 2013 djokovic is also prime djokovic. Rafa had no problem winning. Even then Rafa's absolute prime was 2010 in terms of overall tennis and 2006-2009 in terms of movement. You are highly underestimating peak federer(including 2007) and peak Nadal here. Yes Wawrinka played great in roland garros this year but Djokovic also played not so well, certainly worse than the QF vs rafa. Yes Djokovic is amazing right now, but people say ""weak era"" for a reason. Noone ever questions Nadal's peak in the past years and people still aknwoledge that peak Fed is godly despite playing in a ""weak era""."
tennis,3djxnb,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"peak Federer(including 2007)   2007 Federer was not peak Federer. It was prime Federer, not peak Federer.    So 2013 djokovic is also prime djokovic   2013 Djokovic was his prime, but not his peak. 2011 and 2015 are his peak years.   Even then Rafa's absolute prime was 2010 in terms of overall tennis    And 2011 was his second best year tennis wise. It doesn't matter that Rafa didn't win as much as he did in 2010, Rafa was still playing his best tennis.    Yes Wawrinka played great in roland garros this year but Djokovic also played not so well   Djokovic didn't play badly at all. I agree, the 2015 QF was one of the best performances I've ever seen, but part of that was Rafa. Too many of his forehands and backhands were sitting up short, allowing Djokovic to crush them off. But Djokovic was playing really well in the finals. Stan was untouchable though. 60 winners in 4 sets.    Yes Djokovic is amazing right now, but people say ""weak era"" for a reason.   Because they started watching tennis in 2012? Or because they can't comprehend that you don't have to be winning everything to be playing really well?   Noone ever questions Nadal's peak in the past years   As I said in my post. However, it seems hypocritical to me that people are questioning Djokovic's peak when Nadal's peaks weren't necessarily better than Djokovic's. Who were Rafa's opponents in 2010? Federer doesn't matter, he wasn't playing well and Rafa would beat him. Djokovic still was on a gluten diet and wasn't playing as well as he was in 2011. Murray was out of his prime. So who was Rafa's competition? And let's look at 2013. Federer was ass. Djokovic wasn't at his peak. Murray was Murray. Not the strongest field of all time. But Rafa was playing incredibly, and as such, Rafa made the field look weak. However, it's the same thing for Novak in 2011 and 2015.   and people still aknwoledge that peak Fed is godly despite playing in a ""weak era"".   Because those people can see the truth: Federer's tennis at his peak is the highest level of tennis anyone has ever played. But Djokovic in 2011 and 2015 are almost as good. There are many others, however, who say that it was and is a ""weak era"". And those people are like those who say that the field this year is ass because Djokovic is winning everything."

tennis,3djxnb,fogee23,-3,Thu Jul 16 22:45:39 2015 UTC,"well that's my point really, while Federer played the highest level of tennis throughout a large span of time (12 years and counting..) with a lot of competition coming from the people from the generation before (Sampras, Agassi etc) his own (Roddick, Safin, Hewitt) and the one after (Nadal, Djokovic, Murray)... Djokovic seems to just have those guys I mentioned above and a injury prone Nadal as his rivals with no new youngster that poses any serious threat.. so while he will definitely be among the greats.. GOAT? Don't think so.. but hey never say never"
tennis,3djxnb,Personacorona,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:09:23 2015 UTC,"Tennis like all sports evolves. Players on average get better. The field gets better. Again this is an average; you will always have a player rising faster than the field, or falling off. This is reflected in the rankings (e.g. Rafa).  This seems to be the thing that people seem to not want to accept. Somehow, in their minds tennis is exempt.  Would you truly compare a marathon runner/100m world-class runner of today with someone from 5-10-20 years ago ? No. Because there's objective proof that they are so much better.  By this argument anyone who stays at #1 for a long time should be considered as a GOAT candidate.  Also, the most recent person to do that gets greater weight. Djokovic is starting to put together a run that definitely puts him in contention. He may never get to Fed's total of slams, but if he dominates at #1 for as long or nearly as long, he would have to be considered.  Also people who bring up Laver etc; it's too bad he was born in his era. I don't think we can fairly compare him, but as it stands, he competed against a much smaller field, definitely a less athletic field. To call him the GOAT is ludicrous."

Serena is so much better and the rest just don't seem to be trying. Sure, Serena is stronger, but e.g. with so much boobs, it it absolutely horrible that others are so inferior. I wish that Serena becomes GOAT (she isn't, Graf and probably Martina are above) and makes ridiculous $$$, just so that it gets women tennis  back more into a sports competition and less of a beauty contest.  As for Djokovic, article forgets his gluten sensitivity. He positively exloded after changing his diet. The probability of him dethroning Fed and Rafa sooner, had he changed the diet sooner, is real."

However one of the reasons I like Novak is because I think his strokes are the ones I could actually attempt to emulate. I can't hit Roger's 1 handed backhand and certainly can't hit spin like Nadal. I think Novak's strokes are closer to strokes I attempt to hit.
tennis,3dg1dk,SleepingAntz,-5,Thu Jul 16 02:25:10 2015 UTC,Nadal's forehand isn't that hard to emulate (tough to do for a long time though) and Federer's backhand isn't that special.
tennis,3dg1dk,drodin,4,Thu Jul 16 09:06:37 2015 UTC,Nada's forehand is really tough to emulate. It requires exquisite timing on any balls faster than rally speed because of how complicated the motion is.

Which is true, unless you bring him to the net. A tactic people should look into, as mostly when Federer did that on Sunday, he passed him or forced an error.  But from a positive point of view (the perfect player is the one who has the best variety and shotmaking), it has to be Federer. More devastating at every shot, even in recent years, except the backhand."

As another user mentioned, adding lead tape at 3 and 9 o'clock is a good start to remedy the problem. However, you may find that adding lead tape may negatively affect your racquet's balance, especially if it's already head-heavy."

tennis,3dej19,avaliantheel,10,Wed Jul 15 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"I'd put Nadal ahead of Sampras, simply because Sampras failed to come even close to winning an RG, while Nadal has at least a couple of majors on every surface. Also Nadal had way fewer weeks at 1, but had much tougher competition than Sampras, whose biggest rival was a great, but inconsistent Agassi.  I think Djokovic would have to at least get 12-13 to be considered better than Sampras, he's already better on clay, but winning an RG would really help his case. He could also approximate Sampras weeks at 1 without any real competition for the next two years.  Outside of major injury, I feel like he'll be considered better than Laver (most of his slams as an amateur), or Borg (retired way too early)."

Federer and Nadal are 1 and 2, but I'm not sure how I would rank the remaining 3. Each has a glaring hole: Borg no hardcourt titles, and Sampras and Djokovic have no titles at RG. However, Borg made 4 finals at the US, and Novak has made 3 finals at the French (plus the 2013 semis which was basically the championship). Sampras, however, was just not very good on Clay: One semifinal and three quarterfinals for his career.  I think if Novak gets to 12-13 slams AND wins the French, he will be considered better than Sampras. I think, in 2020, we'll view it like this   Fed Nadal Nole Sampras Borg   Would probably put Agassi 6th."

He's come so close at French in recent years (and even beat Nadal) that it's hard to see him finishing his career without one so that's 1 more. So that leaves him with about 16 slams."

Stan, Murray, Nishikori they are all good players.   During Federer/Nadal times ( ~2005), it was mostly those too battling it out, occasionally Roddick.

Sampras' lack of a French title is too much of a hole in his career and these days having the career slam is vital to a GOAT argument.  If Djokovic never gets the French and never reaches 14 slams then Sampras is still ahead of him as #3. He still has a long way and after the French this year there really isn't any way to predict whether or not Djokovic will obtain the career slam. I expect and think he will end at 11-13 slams without a French Open title but I also think that he will surpass Nadal in total masters 1000 titles, but the possibility of Djokovic even ranking higher than Nadal is still possible and not too much out of reach for him."
tennis,3dej19,PokeMyPillow,23,Wed Jul 15 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"I could excuse Djokovic never winning a RG, and consider him better than Sampras if he gets to 13 slams or so. He's been to 3 finals there and lost twice to the greatest clay-court player ever, Sampras only made it to one semifinal there with much weaker competition. This is especially the case if Djokovic continues to dominate the rankings and gets close to Sampras in weeks at the  top."
tennis,3dej19,gibisee4,6,Wed Jul 15 18:30:02 2015 UTC,"common knowledge but worth reminding: fed lost to nadal in 4 french open finals. if he wins even 1 of them, could prevent others from taking away his GOAT status for many additional years"
tennis,3dej19,Clenathan,19,Wed Jul 15 22:11:52 2015 UTC,You mention fanboys but you don't mention Rod Laver in your top 5.   Sorry but any top 5 not including Laver loses all credibility to me. Just because you weren't around during his time doesn't nullify his accomplishments. If you are going to claim the game was very different then then I'll counter with it was very different in Sampras' time too. Now most surfaces play pretty similar meaning dominating on all of them is easier now than it was 15+ years ago.
tennis,3dej19,PlayingKarrde,9,Wed Jul 15 19:30:58 2015 UTC,I agree 100% here. The guy won the calendar slam (twice) and didn't play in the slams for many years. He's probably my #1. Recency bias compels us to go with the flavor of the month.
tennis,3dej19,PedroSampras,0,Wed Jul 15 20:35:04 2015 UTC,djokovic is not a flavor of the month. He is building one of the greatest careers in tennis history. Laver himself put Novak at 6th back in 2012 when had 5 titles
tennis,3dej19,PedroSampras,2,Wed Jul 15 20:45:35 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily what I meant. Obviously Novak is one of the best of all time, and could very well be in contention for GOAT when his career is over.  What I intended to get across is that as time goes on, we forget how truly remarkable some of the older guys were. I think that context is really important, too. Borg retired when he was 25 and didn't play in Australia most years. Laver was excluded from the Slams early in his career."
tennis,3dej19,rar8tt,2,Wed Jul 15 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"See, Laver won the grand slam twice when 3 of the tourneys were on grass so I acknowledge his accomplishments but it's still not very versatile."

I'm not penalizing them for being born in a different time, but the game has become a crazy science experiment. Not only is everybody way bigger, stronger, and faster, but the technique on every shot is just on a different level, too."
tennis,3dej19,PokeMyPillow,2,Thu Jul 16 09:16:01 2015 UTC,"Although I don't know much about Laver, I do know that he played in a time where the slams were primarly on grass and tennis players didn't really play the Australian Open unless they were Australian. Even then he still has 11 slams. His calendar slam could put him equal to Sampras or slightly greater but that is up for debate."

It's mostly chance that someone will not win one or two of those 9 tournaments.   How is that different from saying it's chance that somebody does not win all four slams? It seems to be a greater achievement than a career slam, I'd argue, as it requires a greater mastery of more variety sustained throughout the season over many more tournaments. Several players have a career slam, none have a career masters--and it's not just because it wasn't always around, as the Championship Series was equally prestigious and around through many players entire careers.  If somebody wants to downvote or disagree, at least explain yourself."
tennis,3dej19,PokeMyPillow,3,Thu Jul 16 03:51:13 2015 UTC,It won't benefit Djokovic much other than giving him another masters in the road to obtain more than Nadal. It still would be a great achievement and would add a lot for Djokovic but it is still less of an achievement compared to multiple WTFs and less of an achievement then winning any grand slam(for Djokovic). He needs to get him slam tally up before anything and obviously win at least 1 Roland Garros.   Biggest hole in Nadal's resume is no WTF but it isn't as much of a whole as Sampras' 0 Roland Garros since he at least made the final twice compared to Sampras' 1 semi final. If Djokovic ever gets exactly 13 slams with the French then he could potentially already be slightly greater than Nadal because of the WTF titles and maybe masters titles by then.

Who did Nadal beat to win most of his Grand Slam titles? Roger Federer on clay. How good is Roger Federer on clay, really? He was straight-setted by a bad-hipped Gustavo Kuerten in 2004 at the French Open. He's not an all-time great on clay...just played in a weak clay era, where Ljubicic was Nadal's French Open SF opponent one year.   Notice what happened to Nadal's clay masters series records the moment Djokovic turns into 2011-and-beyond Djokovic. All of a sudden he's lost 6 times in 5 years on clay to the same player. Ages 25-29. If Federer no longer dominating in 08-11 is a sign he dominated a weak era, surely that means the same for Nadal and his clay court dominance.   He's 1-2 against Federer at Wimbledon, won his second Wimbledon title against Tomas Berdych, a one-time Grand Slam finalist who is inferior to the vast majority of the players Federer beat on your list, regardless of age. Beat pre-2011 Djokovic a couple times, who was at best on par with most of the guys on that list.   Oh, and he beat the great Mariano Puerta for his first.   Nadal's contention for being among the very greatest ever is mostly based on his dominance on clay. If he'd had similar success on clay to the success he had on other surfaces, he wouldn't even be in the discussion. He'd be in the Agassi class.   This is a weak point in Nadal's resume, but he more than makes up for it with the most Masters titles ever and his one gold medal to Federer's none (in men's singles).

Nadal did come up in that era. He became #2 in the world in 2005.   20 Grand Slams? Uh...ok. So the guy gets steamrolled by Gonzalez and Tsonga at the AO, loses to Wawrinka at the AO, loses to Soderling at the FO...skips a bunch of slams...and he's somehow going to tally 20 if he ""came up in that era,"" whatever the hell that's supposed to mean?   It wasn't Federer and Djokovic preventing him from most of these slams. Djokovic blocked 3, Federer 2.   Since 2005, Nadal lost in slams to Hewitt, Blake, Youzhny, Gonzalez, Ferrer (twice), Tsonga, Murray (twice), Soderling, Del Potro, Rosol, Darcis, Wawrinka, Kyrgios, and Brown.  Because that's the whole picture. Nadal doesn't have just 1 Australian Open title because of Djokovic. Djokovic has only beaten him once at the AO. He doesn't have just 2 US Open titles because of Djokovic. Djokovic has only beaten him once at the USO. He doesn't have just 2 Wimbledon titles because of Djokovic. Djokovic has only beaten him once at Wimbledon.   I don't. You want to ignore clay because to consider it as part of the overall picture means to yield the fact that Nadal is the greatest. 23-10 is never going away. Federer can never overcome that.    Nadal is the greatest CLAY COURT PLAYER for this generation. The problem is, clay is just one of 3 modern surfaces (4 if you separate fast HC from slow HC).   Nadal winning a bazillion clay court titles is redundant. We know he's by far and away the best clay court player of this generation. That has absolutely no impact on comparing him to Federer on HC and grass. He's nowhere near Federer on HC and grass. He's inferior on two of the 3 surfaces.   And quite frankly, when you look through tennis history, clay has always taken a huge backseat to other surfaces in terms of the players considered the legends of the game. Rod Laver's best surface was grass, as was McEnroe's, Connors', Becker's, Edberg's, and Sampras's.  Other than Borg, who among the great French Open champions is in the ""GOAT"" discussion? The best of the remaining ones is Lendl, but he gets killed for never having won Wimbledon.  When you look at the Wimbledon champions list, you see pretty much nothing but legends. When you look at the FO champions list, you see some of the most forgotten Grand Slam champions in history. Bruguera, Muster, Kafelnikov, Costa, Ferrero, Gaudio, Gomez. Clay court ""specialists"" were sort of set off to the side...until Nadal came and people all of a sudden considered the French Open to be important because he kept blocking Federer's quest for the Grand Slam.   In win percentage and finals appearances you're wrong.   But why do you care about those now? Weak era this, vacuum that. Federer won most of those clay matches in a ""weak clay era."" And unlike the absurd claim about the era overall being ""weak,"" there is actually an argument that 05-10 was a weak clay era.  Just take a look at some of the guys besides Nadal and Federer who were reaching FO SFs during that period. Ljubicic, Melzer, Davydenko, Nalbandian, ""baby"" Djokovic, Gonzalez, Monfils, Soderling, Berdych, Del Potro.  Not exactly great clay court acumen there.   Being the greatest clay court player of all-time is part of why Nadal is the greatest.   What's the other part? Winning 5 non-clay slams, placing him in a 3-way tie for 10th in the open era?   These cheap excuses are irrelevant. So Federer had some down games. So did Djokovic this year against Kevin Anderson and beating Djokovic is suddenly meaningless accomplishment? Way to downplay Berdych that year. Bottom line is, no matter how many excuses your make, he was good enough to beat the defending champion and Djokovic, but he wasn't good enough to beat the best, Rafael Nadal.    He didn't have down games, he had down matches. Kevin Anderson is a Top 20 player with a big serve. On the other hand, Alejandro Falla was and still is a journeyman ranked outside the Top 50. Bozoljac was a qualifier who to this day has won just 11 ATP matches.   Beating pre-2011 Djokovic is not that impressive. Not nearly the way you want it to seem, anyway, just by using his name and pretending the connotations of his name that have resulted from his 2011-2015 results automatically make it an incredible victory. You know who else beat pre-2011 Djokovic? Jurgen Melzer that year in the FO, just weeks earlier.   You talk about that like it's somehow supposed to make Berdych a more respectable slam finalist than Gonzalez. Once again, Gonzalez DESTROYED Nadal in the 2007 Australian Open QF. And then he destroyed Tommy Haas with one of the greatest performances ever seen in the SF. He was on a tear. That forehand was devastating. And then Federer beat him in straight sets.   Berdych was not as good in 2010 Wimbledon as Gonzalez was 2007 AO. Not even close. He was not even as good that Wimbledon as Baghdatis was in the 06 AO. Baghdatis went through Roddick, Ljubicic, and Nalbandian to reach the final. Then he took it to Federer himself in the first 2 sets.   A nice little reminder - Baghdatis beat Nadal in arguably Nadal's best season ever, 2010, in Cincinnati.   And of course, Berdych doesn't begin to compare to Roddick or Hewitt or Agassi, even 35-year-old Agassi. Nor does he compare to Nadal, who was at his grass court peak in the years he lost to Federer, as evidenced by his 4 straight losses from 2012-2015.   Had Federer faced Berdych in a Wimbledon final at some point from 04-07, you'd have listed it as an example of ""weak competition."" But since it was against Nadal, you try to talk him up.   Nadal's not winning more than 2 Wimbledons in any era. Let's be real here. He had 5 top years at Wimbledon, and he would not have won more than 2 had he had to face Phillippousis, Roddick, Roddick (and Hewitt in the QF and SF in 04 and 05), a player the equal of himself in 06 and 07, Roddick, and '12 Murray (with '12 Djokovic in the SF).   So where is he getting 20 slams? He's won his 9 FO titles in the era he was in, and I think it would be more reasonable to surmise he'd win fewer if Djokovic had been in 2011 form from 2005 onward. You know?   He's got 1 AO title after all this time, and I see absolutely no reason to think that would change. He barely won the one he won. I'm not talking about the Federer final, I'm talking the Verdasco SF. And it would be easy to cite that as an example of Nadal struggling against ""weak competition,"" but I know better because I saw how well Verdasco played that tournament. Not as well as Gonzalez in 07, though.   So what, Nadal's going to dominate the USO? He's going to suddenly stop skipping slams because he's the #1 player in 03-07?   And I'm sure he'd love playing when the courts/balls were faster than they are today. He'd love those fast 03-08 US Open tournaments that rewarded offensive play, for instance. The 03-04 Wimbledon surface. Day matches on rebound ace until the SF and F, and prior to 05, the SF and F during the day, too.   Your entire argument hinges on ""what ifs,"" and your answers to those ""what ifs"" are completely devoid of realistic thought."

tennis,3dej19,mrtennisguyperson,2,Thu Jul 16 02:32:57 2015 UTC,"It's true federer does cave a lot when his opponent really takes it to him. 2008 wimbledon after that momentum in winning the last 2 sets commits a bunch of forehand errors to hand nadal a break. 2009 australian open, just completely shuts down in the 5th set even when he should have had the advantage with nadal playing an incredibly intense 5 hour semifinal against verdasco (fed had a straight set victory over roddick). 2011 us open, famous collapse against djokovic.  wimbledon 2014 bunch of unforced errors including a shanked overhead to hand djokovic the break."
tennis,3dej19,Friend_Lord,3,Thu Jul 16 10:56:39 2015 UTC,They will be the best until somebody better comes along. And sadly with sports that somebody could come along very soon. Prime Sampras was seen as the best tennis player ever until Federer came along.   It'll happen.
tennis,3dej19,gccmelb,2,Wed Jul 15 17:44:55 2015 UTC,The idea of a player coming around who ends up being greater than Federer gives me chills.

tennis,3dej19,ImAlwaysLegit,2,Wed Jul 15 22:00:01 2015 UTC,He needs the French in that case in order to be greater. A Career Grand Slam is absolutely critical if he wants to surpass Nadal with fewer slams.

tennis,3dej19,Superafricaman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:33:43 2015 UTC,The relative prestige of Wimbledon shouldn't favor it over the other slams in the GOAT debate. That unfairly tips the scales towards aggressive/serve and volley players and is irrelevant to how skilled the players were overall. I would say that those holes are of the same magnitude.
tennis,3dej19,BAshley1995,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:34:34 2015 UTC,"Lendl made 8 straight finals at one slam and is one of the 'Weeks-at-#1 Big 4' of Federer, Sampras and Connors.  And Lendl was playing in an era when the different surfaces are much more different than they are now so winning slams on both clay and grass logically would have been more difficult, so imo Djokovic's lack of a French title is worse than Lendl's failure to win Wimbledon."

It's definitely dead as a pure strategy but still very effective when used to mix things up, recover after a long point. I have a good serve and when I come in behind it, puts a lot of pressure on the opponent to hit a good return and not just block it back. I find I win very many points off the pressure alone of being at the net."
tennis,3dceh3,NZGrade,11,Wed Jul 15 18:05:07 2015 UTC,What an awesome rivalry Sampras and Agassi had. That serve vs. that return. I really miss serve & volley being a major part of men's tennis.

tennis,3dceh3,tommygoogy,3,Wed Jul 15 08:28:17 2015 UTC,I think it would be better for Federer to serve more to Djokovic forehand. On the forehand side he gets less returns back in play.

tennis,3dceh3,jk147,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:28:51 2015 UTC,Those are nice returns but the most telling part to me is the placement of Federer's serves. They're all in the box more than they were at any other point in the tournament. He was living by the lines against Murray. These are easier serves to return.
tennis,3dceh3,Isaacsv,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:30:29 2015 UTC,Can any explain why Fed always slices his returns rather than doing like what Djokovic is doing here? Because for me it looks like Fed can probably win more points if he slices less returns? Or am I wrong?
tennis,3dceh3,theheartstheif,2,Wed Jul 15 08:52:18 2015 UTC,"The grip that he uses for a slice return is not as ""far away"" as the grip he uses for his topspin backhand."
tennis,3dceh3,opiumgordon,2,Wed Jul 15 12:59:23 2015 UTC,Some players favor returning the ball safely to keep it in and work on the opponent for a winner.   This is used more in the modern game because serve and volley is not used much today. Slice into an approaching attacker is not ideal.
tennis,3dceh3,Lumos309,2,Wed Jul 15 18:50:51 2015 UTC,"It's true that if Fed slices less he would be better off. In his matches vs Simon,Querry,Dzumhur @wimbledon 2015 and Seppi at halle 2015, federer sliced 38% of his returns, winning 53% when they landed in. Of the 62% he hit he won 61% when they landed in. One thing though Fed is one of the few players that can win 50%+ when slicing the return inplay. Because it's normally an <50% option inplay. But still hitting the return would be better."
tennis,3dceh3,opiumgordon,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:24:13 2015 UTC,"Federer's return is simply awful. Sometimes I think its the weakest part of his game but then i remember his backhand, and then I remember that's why everybody serves to his backhand."
tennis,3dceh3,11sparky11,16,Wed Jul 15 09:11:57 2015 UTC,"I think most people will agree that Federer is a good returner. He has a very good record against the big servers. Block return, deep into the centre of court. Against most players, it neutralises the serve."
tennis,3dceh3,Rac3318,7,Wed Jul 15 10:21:33 2015 UTC,"As with his backhand, Federer's return is weak relative to the rest of his game. It's better than 98 of the top 100, perhaps, but not quite on par with some of his other shots which have GOAT status."

tennis,3dfwd3,Alchemist32,17,Wed Jul 15 23:17:53 2015 UTC,"Is Murray really doing so badly? His 2015 has on the whole been quite excellent, he's solidly #2 in the Race To London.   Murray's clay game has never been better than this year. He crushed Nadal in Madrid (Nadal didn't look especially weak that particular match), won his first two clay titles in his career (including a Masters). He took Djokovic to five sets at Roland Garros.   It's not like he didn't ever lose grand slam finals or important Djokovic matches while Lendl was his coach (Australian 2012 semifinal to Djokovic, Wimbledon 2012 final to Federer, Australian 2013 final to Djokovic).   I think Djokovic is the better player in their matchup, and always has been, but if they play enough times (which Murray should and needs to continue making happen), Murray is good enough to win some of them, even if Djokovic wins a majority. Lendl never transformed him into a favourite in that matchup. At Djokovic's level right now nobody can."
tennis,3dfwd3,seyakomo,2,Thu Jul 16 01:37:12 2015 UTC,Thing is with lendl he definitely had a much more favourable chance to beat novak or federer on any given day because of the attacking style lendl would make him play and not to mention Murray was actually surprisingly sttong mentally when he was with lendl. The second Lendl came to murray he pushed Novak all the way to a hard fought 5th set win which murray has never replicated without lendl pushing a player like novak especially in the 5th set and not getting destroyed like he has been this year consistently in the last sets against novak.
tennis,3dfwd3,dropshot,2,Thu Jul 16 02:13:41 2015 UTC,"I think you also have to look at Djokovic making changes to his game.  Back in 2011, Djokovic was more willing to play long points with Nadal.  This culminated in a marathon match at the 2012 Australian Open final.  I think Djokovic decided that was way too much work, and worked on hitting the ball harder without losing his accuracy, and so that's made Djokovic a bit harder to handle.  I agree with /u/seyakomo, that Djokovic has generally had the lead.  The times where Murray has beaten him have either been close matches, or ones where Djokovic was dealing with conditions (windy in the 2012 US Open final, long semis at the 2013 Wimbledon)."
tennis,3dfwd3,winabean7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:43:42 2015 UTC,Murray could actually beat djokovic and federer though like djokovic in dubai 2012 and olympics and federer in shanghai 2012 when he destroyed him I doubt murray can do that without lendl. Its my opinion obviously but again I have to say imo murray's problems are all mental to me.
tennis,3dfwd3,dropshot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"Andeh will get to Slam-winning form again. Let's not forget that he went from getting absolutely annihilated by Federer at the WTF last year 6-0 6-1 to reaching the AO finals in the span of two months. That's an impressive amount of progress in a very short period of time, especially with a relatively recent coaching change. The GS draws haven't fallen in his favor this year, but you can be damn sure if he gets a nice draw sometime over the next year and a half, and Novak cracks just a little, Murray can take the title."
tennis,3dfwd3,shivoham,7,Thu Jul 16 21:00:36 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to recall the last time a player reunited with a former coach.  I recall, way back, when people wanted Andy Roddick to get back together with Brad Gilbert, but it never happened.  Indeed, despite Gilbert having spent many years with Agassi, he never seemed to gel with anyone else.  Neither Roddick nor Murray stayed with him that long.  Murray said he argued too often with Gilbert.  I'm not sure it offers Lendl anything either.  If they get back together, and Murray doesn't do any better, it doesn't look good for Lendl, and that's always a risk Lendl would take if he worked with him (assuming he thinks it's important that Andy succeed so he looks good too)."
tennis,3dfwd3,dropshot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:29:22 2015 UTC,I'm trying to recall the last time a player reunited with a former coach   Sampras and Paul Annacone.
tennis,3dfwd3,dropshot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:20:42 2015 UTC,"I was checking Wikipedia.  While this (according to Wikipedia) was technically true, they split at the end of 2001, then got back together in July 2002 (so 6-7 months later), and really, Sampras only played through the US Open, so maybe 2 more months, and then didn't play for a year, and retired at the start of the next US Open, so while they reunited, Sampras was practically done with his career by that point, and they didn't split for very long."
tennis,3dfwd3,dropshot,2,Thu Jul 16 12:41:46 2015 UTC,True I don't even think andy would accept it as Ivan left him at a bad time and this might even be why he opted to hire someone that is COMPLETELY the opposite to Ivan in Mauresmo. Ivan made andy play a attacking style that may have made him a little more boring but it brougth results where as Mauresmo lets him do whatever he wants and he resorts to his more passive cat and mouse game in big matches unlike the commanding style he played with Ivan. I think he just needs help mentally instead of technical help.
tennis,3dfwd3,aj258,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:41:32 2015 UTC,"Apparently, Lendl was something of a taskmaster (not surprisingly), and I think Murray didn't appreciate that (since he felt he knew his body better than Lendl).  Of course, it's difficult to say how effective the mental help is, and if Murray is going to tune out Lendl (which he may have started to do), then getting together won't be helpful."
tennis,3dfwd3,DoubleDekker,0,Thu Jul 16 12:38:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I heard that too but Lendl left Murray not the other way around. I read that Andy was really down for abit after Ivan left him and didnt enjoy practising. I don't have anything against mauresmo or Bjorkman but I doubt they can provide the help mentally Andy needs imo.
tennis,3dfwd3,Personacorona,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:28:24 2015 UTC,"Of course, that's merely speculation on our part.  Basically, we're looking at the results, and attributing them to being mentally tougher.  Not to say that's not important, but there were also strategic changes as well, and the things that worked well for Murray (being told by Lendl what to do) may not work well now.  I suspect one reason Lendl left Murray was that Murray was starting to tune Lendl out.  If I had to guess another reason, it was because Murray was not going to be good for a while due to his surgery, and probably Lendl wanted Murray to train like he did prior to that and Murray was deciding he'd listen to his body, and he'd not do what Lendl said.  At that point, if Lendl's not getting Murray's attention, there's no reason for him to stay.  Of course, pure speculation."
tennis,3dfwd3,Gluecksritter90,10,Fri Jul 17 12:24:04 2015 UTC,I think of lot of users on here overestimate Murray's ceiling. The* guy works on his fitness like no other. He works on his weaknesses like no other. It's just that his best is not enough to be #1.
tennis,3dfwd3,reredef,4,Thu Jul 16 02:39:26 2015 UTC,"I think Murray is the 2nd best player in the field right now. He is expected to beat everyone he plays except for Djokovic. He's only been beaten in Slams  by Djokovic and a God mode Federer. Djokovic isn't infallible though, as we saw in the French. So I think Murray should just get the fuck out there and believe he can beat the guy. There's a losing streak going on right now with Djokovic, but one big win can turn the tables for Murray."
tennis,3dfwd3,AliAskari,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:36:12 2015 UTC,I do agree murray is no2 right now but I just cant accept how he totally collapses MENTALLY against djokovic I dont even think djokovic dominates him in terms of tennis. In the times of Lendl he stopped giving djokovic those short balls and slices that allowed djokovic to take control of rallies now hes just too passive and is mentally weak in the important moments against novak especially in deciding sets hahaha in 3 deciding sets this year against novak hes taken 1 game I mean that is just totally abysmal and unacceptable its purely mental to me.
tennis,3dgnvy,flynnacus,4,Thu Jul 16 03:07:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, very common.  Factory strings are 100% poor quality synthetic gut. When I see a player using factory strings (with logo), I know he doesn't know how to play. Have the racquet restrung with either poly in mains/synthetic gut in crosses. Or, for even more spin effect, full poly, very tight (will lose tension for a week, then hold for a while).  However, poly will not break so after, say three weeks of significant play, cut the strings out because balls will begin to carry regardless of how much spin you try to put on the ball.  Remember, pros play with poly for nine games. (It takes self-discipline to use ful poly, using poly/synth hybrid at least the synth will eventually break.)  PS: Make sure you are starting your swing below the ball.  The best string in the world won't correct for poor technique.  If you are a beginner, suggest you watch videos of slow motion forehands.  Youtube is a wonderful teaching/learning tool."
tennis,3dgnvy,steve3635,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:54:29 2015 UTC,"So in the end, is their a specific brand/type of string that you would recommend? I'm just a high school tennis player without a lot of money, so its not like I can get a racket restrung every 9 games."
tennis,3dgnvy,LoveFifty,3,Thu Jul 16 19:45:32 2015 UTC,You could apply more top spin and/or string the racket tighter.
tennis,3dgnvy,jk147,2,Thu Jul 16 04:12:04 2015 UTC,"You are most likely hitting it very flat, with too much power and not enough follow through. This is assuming you are very new to tennis. I only say this because most intermediate players would know what is wrong immediately. At my complex there is a group of new players and they play everyday, I see them hitting without any spin and the ball flies all over the place. Not to mention a lot of ""frying pan"" style of play.   Top spin is what keeps the ball in play if you are hitting it from the baseline."

Wawrinka still does have a chance considering the fact that he has the edge at the moment, but as such its a no brainer."
tennis,3ddo1r,Bohemund_the_First,14,Wed Jul 15 13:30:59 2015 UTC,"I do this with 150 balls several times per week, and I find the best way is to use three cones.  Put one in each back corner of the box, and one in the middle of those two.  One each for your wide serve, body serve, and serve down the T.  Make every serve a first serve until you miss, and when you miss hit your second serve until you get one in.  I serve deuce one day and ad the next, but I don't bother switching after every serve.  Filming yourself (propping your phone/camera up on something) helps a ton.  Film yourself from the front and use the film to compare to pros and see what you're doing right/wrong.  As long as you know how to fix what you're doing wrong, it allows you to be your own coach to an extent.  Also, don't be afraid of serving into the sun.  Practice looking into the sun without a hat when you serve, that helps me during matches.  The only other tip I have is to use the balls you hit into the net as practice for overheads.  Pick up one/two balls at a time and pop them up like a lob then crush an overhead.  That has improved my overhead x10.  The only downside to serving 500 balls a week is that I go through grips like crazy, so I've learned to serve with an old slippery grip.  I only change them now before I hit with a human being.  Doing all of this has made my serve the best aspect of my game, and I've gone from being the ~6th best server on my team to by far the best in a matter of about 4 months."

If you crush 1st serves non stop for hours your form will break down, cause frustration and upset your progress."
tennis,3ddo1r,hfmf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"I hope I know what I'm doing, my first serve is definitely my best shot, but I think you're right in that people (myself included) often neglect the second serve practice."
tennis,3ddo1r,tothelimit2019,2,Tue Jul 21 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"I play a game with myself where I try to serve an actual game.  I start on the deuce side and say ""love love"" to myself.  Then I hit a 1st serve that I would be happy with in a match.  One that would pressure my opponent and maybe win me a free point.  If I make that, I get a point and move to the next side.  If I miss it, then it's time to hit a GOOD 2nd serve.  Once again, one that would pressure my opponent.  If I make that, then I get a point and move to the next side. If I double fault, then my ghost opponent gets the first point and I move to the next side.  I play out entire sets this way, and I find that it comes close to simulating the pressure you'll feel when down 15-40 on your serve, so long as you can keep the intensity and not baby a serve in just to allow yourself not to lose.  Try to keep the level as high as possible."

tennis,3dd7ew,Rafael_Federer,7,Wed Jul 15 10:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Novak did that very well in the Wimbledon final - he made Federer move much much more than he was comfortable with. Roger missed so many running forehands in the match."
tennis,3dd7ew,GrecoRomanStrength,2,Wed Jul 15 17:08:13 2015 UTC,Especially cross-court running forwards.
tennis,3dd7ew,strike2867,0,Wed Jul 15 19:00:54 2015 UTC,I remember a lot of down the line ones in the fourth. He barely made any.
tennis,3dd7ew,dropshot,5,Wed Jul 15 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"It certainly affected Lendl as he got older (though he had back issues).  But, one thing that's tough to assess is the speed of the ball.  Djokovic may appear to hit the ball just as hard as Murray, but it can be difficult to tell.  Quite often, for example, you'd see Nadal hit a shot up the line, and you'd wonder, why doesn't that player run it down.  Maybe the answer is that Nadal is hitting it harder than you think.  The other aspect is that's hard to see is a player hitting a ball softer than usual.  If you're attacking a player, they may hit a high soft shot, and that results in the other player hitting a winner.  You think the player just hit a winner because they wanted to, but, no, they did it because the opponent gave them an opportunity.  My guess is Djokovic can hit these hard shots even off of relatively difficult shots from his opponents.  In any case, how many players are able to currently take advantage of Federer not hitting a running forehand well?  Both Djokovic and Nadal are often content not hitting outright winners, but hitting shots that their opponents barely reach (since that is nearly as effective)."
tennis,3dd7ew,Jones_Crusher,3,Wed Jul 15 12:45:40 2015 UTC,"Despite his unreal track record of avoiding injuries, the back is one thing that has nagged federer from time to time and it wouldn't surprise me if that's the main reason for the deterioration of his ground game (especially late in majors)."
tennis,3dd7ew,mathen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:17:06 2015 UTC,I thought this year he said he's feeling 100% fine and he fixed the back issue after the Davis Cup?
tennis,3dd7ew,Jones_Crusher,3,Wed Jul 15 13:59:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it may not be injured but if you've ever suffered a serious injury, you know that it really never fully goes away.  That joint or body part will always be compromised to an extent, even with world class medical care."
tennis,3dd7ew,Friend_Lord,2,Wed Jul 15 14:15:07 2015 UTC,Not to mention the psychological impact it has on you. Even if the injury is fully healed it still impacts your confidence. My shoulder has been healed for over 4 months and I'm still scared to serve.
tennis,3dd7ew,startinup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:02:02 2015 UTC,"definitely, sometimes the pain may also be in your head, because it has been so long since the area has been pain free."
tennis,3dd7ew,DullahanPT,2,Thu Jul 16 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know, if you watch the match against Murray he pulled off some great forehands on the run. I may be wrong but I think the players today hit with much more topspin than 10 years ago (or maybe because of the court and ball changes it's more effective nowadays) and also deeper on the court. This combined with the fact that Federer plays so close to the baseline so he can move forward to the net and also his forehand technique, which has changed a lot over the years, might be the reason why he has a hard time doing it today.   I definitely see him not as good as before in that aspect, if you watch some of his highlights you can tell that it feels uncomfortable for him to hit the forehand on the run. He should know better than anybody, but I feel if he sometimes gave one or two steps back perhaps it would be easier with his modern technique."
tennis,3dd7ew,boredsole,2,Wed Jul 15 16:13:15 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered about moving a step back. It seems like the logical answer, but I feel it would affect his backhand, as that gives the ball a higher bounce by the time it gets to him (esp against Djoko/Nadal).  On the other hand, the main reason he stands so close is to be aggressive and take time away from the other guy. But since that doesn't threaten Djokovic, it would make sense for him to step back and give himself the extra time to hit through it.   It's really hard to change what you've been doing for 15 years, and at that level, its so marginal, that a slight error in tactics or execution could go cost him a match, a tournament, and more importantly his confidence.   I'm sure he's considered all of this."
tennis,3dd7ew,xscientist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, this was a huge disappointment. For some reason when he was pulled out wide on his forehand side, he would decide to overcompensate and try to hit winners from a very low % position. If he played a more conservative recovery shot to simply stay in the point, he would have given himself a better chance. He often did this at very sensitive and critical moments in the match, which also shows some deterioration in his tactical intelligence. Worrying stuff."
tennis,3dd7ew,TimRattayGotScrewed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:14:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. Federer's running forehand has been a huge liability for years now. I started noticing it at least as far back as 2010. When he was grinding late in the year in Shanghai and Stockholm and Basel, I found it rather depressing that he was having to grind in these matches, and every time he had to run to his forehand it was, ""shit...I hope he can get out of trouble here."" He was having to cover it up.  In the past, unless he was really out of position, it was, ""shit, here we go - a shot to the forehand, this is gonna be an exciting, explosive reply and 99% chance Federer is going to win the point."""
tennis,3dd7ew,boredsole,2,Wed Jul 15 20:30:09 2015 UTC,"So what's the answer? If he has to win a slam, he can't just rely on his serve. It works against everyone except Djokovic, whom he inevitably meets in every final he reaches.   I felt in Sunday's match it was nerves. He just wanted it too bad and it cost him that break back and the first set. Djokovic never looked back after that."
tennis,3dd7ew,TimRattayGotScrewed,3,Wed Jul 15 20:50:40 2015 UTC,"Well, as dominant as Djokovic has been, he can't reach every Grand Slam final. At some point, someone will beat him. Federer needs to be ready when that happens.   Otherwise, I think he should just keep working on his serve, especially his second serve, and consider more serve-and-volley play. I mean, Tommy Haas seemed to have success in the 09 Wimbledon QF against him doing that. Granted, that was pre-11 Djokovic, but of all the areas Djokovic has improved, I don't think passing shots is really one of them."
tennis,3ddq10,Sebastien447,4,Wed Jul 15 13:49:08 2015 UTC,"Jeez, they've got Haas playing twice today?! Give the guy a break, he's 37 years old haha."

From what I can tell 'Premiere Wrap Up' tickets might be your best option, this gives you access to Arthur Ashe (and the rest of the grounds) for 2 day sessions and 2 night sessions from September 2-4.  There is a very good chance Djokovic will be playing during this time, but you won't know for sure until ≈1 day before."

Instead give your itinerary some flexibility in NYC and check the US Open daily schedule on their website starting on the first night. They'll post the schedule for the following day and show who is playing. Djokovic will likely be playing in the night session, so if you want to ball park it, it will be the Monday or Tuesday night for his first round match; where he demolishes somebody very badly and your gf can yell all she wants at him."

tennis,3dci30,everythingismagical,2,Wed Jul 15 10:57:40 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on going to the US Open next year, so I've been doing my research this year regarding the best ways to purchase tickets. I'm happy to give you my understanding about things, anyone please correct me if I am wrong about certain aspects!  Your best option right now will be to purchase individual session tickets here. (There are ticket packages, but those are all sold out by now) The sessions are split into Afternoon (begins at 11AM) and Evening (begins at 7PM). You do have several options for types of tickets: Grounds tickets, Louis Armstrong Stadium, and Arthur Ashe Stadium. Grounds tickets allow you into the actual tournament area, where you can buy souvenirs, food, and watch players on the smaller courts. Louis Armstrong Stadium is the smaller of the two major arenas, and many of the seats in this stadium are not reserved - prominent players do play in this arena, but usually not the top guys (like Djokovic). Arthur Ashe Stadium is the big one where the top seeded players play, so I would recommend that you purchase session tickets for Arthur Ashe Stadium. Purchasing these tickets will also allow you access to the Grounds, and you can find an unreserved seat if you want to watch a match in Louis Armstrong.  Since you're going to be there Sept. 1-6, you'll be there for the earlier rounds, which you can see here. The big players will be given the primetime slots as the big matches are televised, so I would recommend trying to get AT LEAST Arthur Ashe Stadium tickets for the Evening sessions. The schedule of the tournament is created as the tournament progresses, so unfortunately there's no way to predict exactly when Djokovic will play, but it is a solid bet that he'll be playing in Arthur Ashe, and evening matches produce higher TV ratings.   In order to guarantee a sighting of him, and if price really is no object, then I'd have to recommend buying Afternoon and Evening session tickets for Arthur Ashe stadium for as many days as you can in order to increase your chances of catching a Djokovic match. It would mean watching A LOT of tennis, but I see nothing wrong with that :)  I hope this helped a bit. Once again, please anyone correct me if I'm wrong - that would also help with my planning for next year!"

There really isn't anything you can predict. You can get lucky(depending on the draw) and have a day where you can see both Nadal and Djokovic play yet you can also have a day in the same round where you only see Wawrinka and Ferrer."

tennis,3dd5jh,hermionedidthework,7,Wed Jul 15 16:45:56 2015 UTC,"5. Tie-breaking Procedures   a. Singles  When two (2) or more players have the same number of ranking points, the tie for the ranking position will be decided according to the following priorities:   i. The player with the most combined total points from Grand Slams, Premier Mandatory Tournaments, Premier 5 Tournaments and the WTA Finals;  ii. The player with the most total points from all WTA and Grand Slam Tournaments, including the WTA Finals;  iii. The player with the fewest number of Tournaments in a 52- week period (including any Mandatory Tournaments, if the player qualified for acceptance); and  iv. The highest number of points from one (1) single Tournament, then if needed, the second highest and so on.     So, more of Kvitova's points must have come from lower level tournaments than Woz's."

tennis,3dg76x,gatchaman89,2,Thu Jul 16 01:51:03 2015 UTC,Check out this years Miami final match between Murray and Novak In the third set Murray had 4 Consecutive easy overhead putaways and he lost the point. In the Murray Novak Match at the Australian Open this year I think a overhead cost him the first set on the tiebreak and another couple of VERY easy overheads cost him very dearly in the third set I believe. I can honestly name mpre than 8-10 off the top of my head right now that novak would definitely atlesst make 85% of them. The misses andy was making were almost laughable coming from a proffesional tennis player.

tennis,3dbgb9,Isaacsv,14,Tue Jul 14 23:46:37 2015 UTC,"Bad article, meaningless statistics. Tennis could use some more 538 type articles, but this is not the example to follow. Just at a glance:   ""The averages were gathered based on 372 recorded service points played. I looked at 31 service points per player"" - This isn't nearly enough to be statistically significant, both as a sample size of 12 players, as well as serves per player. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt in using all recent matches with roughly equal opponents, but it's far from certain. Especially with this small a sample, the source match is crucial (imagine the first serve % difference if Federer's numbers are taken from the semifinal vs Murray and Djokovic's are taken from his first round match against unranked Kohlschreiber).  The only variable he uses is average bounces per player, which is pretty meaningless. The justification for more bounces is that it either a) let's a player rest a little longer, or b) let's a player mentally focus longer before a point (as Djokovic says in the article). So the only reason ball-bouncing should be relevant is as related to time between serves, a statistic which is actually much more available if someone wants to do a real study on this.  He only looks at difference ACROSS players, not in a player's career. The differences in size, conditioning and technique are almost certain to drown out any difference in win % (even service win %) alone. What should be examined here is the difference that happens when a player bounces more or less than usual. Will Wawrinka serve better after 6 bounces? Will Djokovic serve worse with only 2? The bounce difference per-player rates could then be analyzed to make a much more meaningful analysis than the one presented here. Also would help to take into account opponent rank and age/rank of the player over time."
tennis,3dbgb9,akrito_,4,Wed Jul 15 01:31:32 2015 UTC,I think if 538 broke tennis down you would never see a second serve from a top pro again.
tennis,3dbgb9,psuskifan,2,Wed Jul 15 03:51:53 2015 UTC,"They already did that article, this quote sums it up.   Why don’t more players go for it on their second serve? Wouldn’t they be better off treating their second opportunity to serve like their first one?  The answer almost always is no.  If the average Top 50 ATP player went for his first serve on both points, he’d double fault on 38.1 percent of his second-serve points."

It's become part of a routine, and routines are always beneficial for something like a serve.  If you do the exact same preparation for every serve, your body can rely more on muscle memory and less on thinking.  To me, spinning my racquet, putting my weight on my left foot, and bouncing the ball twice puts my body into autopilot, and the serve just ends up happening"
tennis,3dbgb9,Starfire09,2,Wed Jul 15 01:51:59 2015 UTC,"It's become part of a routine, and routines are always beneficial for something like a serve. If you do the exact same preparation for every serve, your body can rely more on muscle memory and less on thinking.   This is what I was taught. I bounce it three times. My coach always used to call it the ""ritual"" to reinforce the idea that bouncing the ball itself doesn't really make or break your serve but it helps you to build muscle memory, like you said, and gives you a few seconds to collect your thoughts before starting a new point. Serving is probably the only swing in tennis you'll take from the exact same spot on the court every time. It's the only set piece play I can think of, so practicing it the same way every single time is essential to getting a good serve, at least in my humble opinion."
tennis,3dbgb9,winowmak3r,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:45:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I was also taught to bounce it exactly 3 times. It keeps me in a rhythm and gives me the time to get my head back in the game for the next point.

tennis,3ddvii,B4mb00zl33,4,Wed Jul 15 14:34:53 2015 UTC,"One-Handed Backhand:   Generally more top-spin Easier usage of a variety of shots More range Requires more time to set up Easier to attack for the opponent   Two-Handed Backhand:   Flatter shots Stability through the shot improves with 2 hands on the racquet which often leads to more consistency with it Requires less time to set up Less attackable because of it's quicker set up time Slice backhands or drop shots might feel less natural   General Thoughts:  I try not to think of one as better than the other.  I would always recommend whichever feels best to you.  If you feel comfortable with both, then I think it is more of a question of variety vs consistency and how you like to employ your strategy on the court.    I think if you want to mix things up on people then a one-hander is a more optimal choice, the slice backhand can cause your opponent to produce a very attackable ball.  Or they can hit the cover off of it and blow you out, that can happen too, it feels pretty terrible.  Some people who play tennis casually have trouble against this sort of thing.  I think if you want a more consistent weapon that people won't be able to take as much advantage of then use a two-handed backhand.  In terms of which one is easier to learn, I think they're about equal.  I've seen some leaning towards one-handed backhands being harder to learn but it's way more likely to come down to personal feel.  Before tennis I played squash where you can't have a two-handed backhand, I was already too comfortable playing with a one-handed backhand and the transition was very easy.  Two of my friends who are learning to play have less feel for the one-handed backhand motion and use a two-hander while the third one is doing fine with it.  In terms of power, I think the one-hander has a higher max and a lower minimum potential.  The two-hander would have it's min and max closer together, there are just fewer factors that can go wrong during your two-handed swing than with a one-handed swing."

One Hander: -Higher potential for power and spin -Have to have timing right as you don't have an extra hand for support -Usually more natural feel for slice and transition to net game.

tennis,3daxwl,chad311,13,Tue Jul 14 21:28:50 2015 UTC,"DY suffers from a few things that are out of his control as well as a few things in his control. He was hyped from age 14 as being the next great American tennis player. His early junior results were unheard of and his potential was immense. That pressure certainly didn't help his development and hearing that you're already great makes it difficult to work hard at becoming great. Also, because of that, he received wild cards to play tour events before he was ready, so instead of developing his skills to get to that level, he just jumped right in with a game that wasn't ready. It's understandable that he would fall short in that case.  He also has had his parents as his coach for pretty much his whole career. Part of his mental game weakness is that he seems like a child on the court. It's not surprising that he still acts like a junior on court when he lives the life of a junior off court. Touring with your parents cements the idea that you're still a kid playing for your parents when really he's a man and should be playing for himself. He needs to grow up, but that hasn't been allowed to happen since he's been under his parent's wing his whole adult life.   It also hurts that he hasn't received much outside coaching advice on how to develop his game. He could really use a fresh perspective, but instead gets more of the same. As a junior, DY succeeded on athleticism and talent. He still has both of those, but he doesn't have much else. The skills that his parents helped him develop for his junior years were great, but once they did what they could, they should have handed off coaching to someone who could further develop his game. There was so much hype around him as a junior that making any changes to improve his game didn't seem warranted. Why would he change his game if he was already great? As it is, he's competing against pros with the coaching that he had as a junior.   Basically, DY hasn't developed since juniors in both his mental game and on court game. The fact that he has succeeded as much as he has is quite a testament to his raw talent. He could have been, and could still be, so much more, but he needs to take charge of his career, admit that he's not the golden boy (which he may already accept) and accept help from others outside his family. Right now, he's a junior playing on the men's tour and he (and his family) need to change that if they want him to further develop.  Disclaimer: Mostly just armchair speculation. I may be an idiot."
tennis,3daxwl,RegularFreddieWilson,3,Tue Jul 14 23:48:54 2015 UTC,Interesting perspective. Nadal is in a way in the same family boat. A lot of pressure these days to dump uncle Tony too.
tennis,3daxwl,strike2867,7,Wed Jul 15 03:46:50 2015 UTC,"Toni Nadal did everything he could not to let any of his Nadal's successes as a young player get to his head. When Nadal won an under-12 Spanish tournament, while the rest of the family was trying to celebrate, Toni gets a list of 25 former winners of that tournament and reads it out in front of the family, asking how many Nadal had even heard of. Of course a majority of them had not gone on to have careers as pros, so Toni was always making the point that no matter what was achieved it was never enough, there was always more work to be done."
tennis,3daxwl,seyakomo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:56:21 2015 UTC,"That's actually an interesting case. Why has Nadal succeeded in that setting while DY hasn't. It's hard to say for sure, but I think Nadal's success lies mostly in his own determination and drive. He could have been just a great clay courter. His early career was just that, but he was determined to get better, determined to beat Federer. Perhaps it was the fact that he had a specific rival to target, but he did a great job of improving the skills he needed to succeed on other surfaces. DY hasn't had the same sort of targeted improvement in his game and I imagine that is a large part of it."
tennis,3daxwl,RegularFreddieWilson,2,Wed Jul 15 06:01:37 2015 UTC,At that point federer was everyone's targeted rival. Nadal was just the only one who succeeded.
tennis,3daxwl,ttebow,6,Wed Jul 15 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"He makes me angry. I think he has totally wasted away his talent with quite possibly the worst mental game of all time. If you watch him play, he hits the cover off the ball, but doesn't do any thing with it. It's like he's trained his whole life to hit he most boring shots of all time."
tennis,3daxwl,Pinbenterjamin,10,Tue Jul 14 22:51:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, he was once ranked number 1 as a junior, but not every top ranked junior has successfully transitioned to the pros.  The ones that tend to do better have bigger serves and bigger groundstrokes.  Does Donald Young strike you as a power player?  Because once he's not one, than he had to be better off the ground, and there are plenty of players that are very good off the ground.  Look at a player like Filip Peliwo.  He reached four junior Slam finals, and he's not even broken the top 200, and his rank is nearly 500 as he struggles to win Futures.  What do you think Donald Young does well that he could be, say, a top 20 player?"
tennis,3daxwl,dropshot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:47:59 2015 UTC,"I think it must be his mental game, because if he has demonstrated results in the past, being unable to replicate them in my view is due to being mentall weak.   I think he's been in the semis of a 500 level, at least the third or maybe even fourth round of a couple majors.   So even if he doesn't possess any single huge weapon, if he could repeat his tournament results at least somewhat consistently (ie-beat who he's 'supposed to beat') I think he would be ranked a lot better, probably top 20."
tennis,3daxwl,dropshot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:13:19 2015 UTC,"In that respect, most players probably suffer from mental issues, and the fact is, we only consider them weak relative to others that are mentally strong.  If you were to play a match, maybe you'd do much worse than your best, and so you'd be classified as mentally weak.  But I think mental toughness, like physical strength, or athletic ability is something that can be difficult to achieve.  And some players have that one spark (say, Melanie Oudin or Dinara Safina) and they disappear.  Some of it is people getting used to their playing style, and some of it is, yes, mental.  Tennis is also something of a zero sum game.  If someone is doing well, others are not."
tennis,3daxwl,strike2867,0,Wed Jul 15 12:41:01 2015 UTC,"Filip's ranking has dropped, but he's starting to win. He's still relatively young. Seems like his issues are mental."
tennis,3daxwl,Quang_S,3,Wed Jul 15 03:53:13 2015 UTC,One reason for his poor attitude/mental game is probably the amount of WCs he has been given. I think this article explains it well.   http://lastwordonsports.com/2015/03/13/atp-rushing-youngsters-spotlight-early/
tennis,3daxwl,CookieDoughCooter,3,Tue Jul 14 23:41:14 2015 UTC,"You people are vicious. I agree he probably could get some new coaching if in fact he's only coached by his parents, but the way you guys talk about his mental game and skills, you'd think he was a mid tier high school player. ""Lazy""? ""Underachiever""? He's one of the top players in the world! It's not like he doesn't try. You cannot get that high through talent and athleticism alone. Tennis is too technically and mentally challenging."
tennis,3daxwl,Sebastien447,3,Wed Jul 15 04:27:05 2015 UTC,"Young's laziness is common knowledge among those who closely follow USA tennis. He has repeatedly refused invitations by the USTA to train, prefers to hang out in Atlanta and hit with his buddies, calls that ""practice."" He also refuses coaching from the USTA despite having the most success of his career working with Mike Sell. On top of that, he's mentally weak but he has matured some and is not as prone to meltdown as he used to be."
tennis,3daxwl,fischcheng,2,Wed Jul 15 14:22:11 2015 UTC,"I don't like his game... Most of guys in top 200 have talents, you need right strategy, team and determinations to stay at the top."

tennis,3daxwl,ChapelHeel66,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:43:57 2015 UTC,"Not fair to say he is lazy or doesn't care.  It's hard work to maintain even a ranking in the mid-50s.  And let's not forget he has made more than $2 million on tour.  I also am not sure why there is so much focus on his ""mental game.""  The fact is: he gets killed on his first serve.  His career first serve points won is only 66%, which is far below average (Tour average for 2015: 71%).  He also wins a below average number of second serve points, though he is much closer to average.  All in all, the average player in 2015 wins 63.4% of his service points.  For his career, Young is at about 59%, which means over his career he probably only has a 1 in 3 chance of beating the average player (to say nothing of top players).  That said, Young's numbers have been coming up. In 2015 he has won 69.6% of his first serves, 52.5% of his second serves, and 62.0% of all service points.  And if you have seen his serve lately, it clearly is something he is working on.  He's still only 25, and careers are lasting longer.  He probably is not going to be the #1 the USA was looking for, but I wouldn't be surprised if he cracks the top 30 and stays awhile."
tennis,3daxwl,emphryio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:43:26 2015 UTC,"In the juniors people usually win by just getting the ball back, waiting for the other player to hit an error. Just because someone does well as a junior doesn't mean they're going to be a great pro. Young looks like he's gone as far as his style of play can take him."

And as you said, he focuses on that simply because it's an absolute dominant weapon and the rest of his abilities have regressed to varying degrees. Prime Federer was dominant from every area of the court.  Edit: think not thing"
tennis,3da8og,MotherCanada,13,Tue Jul 14 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"The thing about Fed's serve in 06 that he doesn't have now is the clutchness. If he's down break point, you could guarantee that he'd drop an ace or a 125 down the T, and win the point. Besides that, the only thing 2015 Fed has on 06 Fed is volleys."
tennis,3da8og,Personacorona,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:54:17 2015 UTC,I think his volleying was better in his prime. He misses a lot of easy sitters now.
tennis,3da8og,Lemurians,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:45:42 2015 UTC,I'd argue that Feds serve was way way better in his prime. It was almost predictable how often he'd hit an ace on an important point.
tennis,3da8og,JohnFKennedoge,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:27:32 2015 UTC,"I think federer's best serving was around the year he faced Nadal in the Wimbledon final for the first time. He'd routinely close out games with 3-4 aces, even against a returner like Nadal. I remember in the first set of that match, he only missed one first serve. When he faced Roddick, he'd most times out-ace him."
tennis,3da8og,PeterIanStaker,10,Wed Jul 15 11:55:17 2015 UTC,"Curious where you're reading this?  I once heard an interview with Todd Martin.  As he got older, he said he switched his game plan from Plan A to Plan B (he didn't specify what he did, but presumably he came to net more).  He was asked if it was a good idea to switch given Plan B was not as successful.  He said he felt he had no choice.  Plan A wasn't going to work as well, but Plan B prevented him from getting bad as quickly.  To that end, I think Federer must feel that his older style was not going to be as effective.  If he's to play effectively without the wear and tear, he needs to keep points shorter, and to be honest, except for the very best, these tactics have kept him relevant.  Are they winning him as many matches as they did when he was younger?  Well, against lesser players, perhaps.  He's gambling a bit, hoping that if this high risk style comes together (as it did with Murray), then he still has chances to pull off the upset."
tennis,3da8og,dropshot,9,Tue Jul 14 19:59:45 2015 UTC,He's #2 in the world. I wouldn't have considered him beating Murray at Wimbledon this year to be an upset.
tennis,3da8og,TacticalTennis,5,Tue Jul 14 21:57:31 2015 UTC,"But in 3 sets with the home support against him? Pretty impressive imo. The bookies were favouring Andy on the day and no one was really expecting a 3 set victory for RF.  Plus, it wasn't just the fact that he won in 3 sets, but that his quality of tennis was right up there with some of his best ever. At the age of (almost) 34 that's really quite incredible."
tennis,3da8og,CityofIndustry,3,Wed Jul 15 00:06:12 2015 UTC,"Hell, I didn't think he played that poorly in the final. He did hit some errors that I think old Fed would have gotten in, no doubt. But Djokovic came out to win. He won; Fed didn't lose. He played great and he's number two in the world at the age of 34. He has nothing to be sad about."
tennis,3da8og,rebelaessedai,2,Wed Jul 15 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"No doubt.  Federer didn't have his A+ game but he didn't play poorly.  Nole was just too good throughout the entire match.  When federer failed to consolidate that break in the opening set it allowed Djoker to draw the match out into two long, taxing tiebreaks.  Ultimately it's that grind-it-out quality that makes djokovic the best player in the world."
tennis,3da8og,Jones_Crusher,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:21:57 2015 UTC,"Yes! I swear that guy could play hard-hitting tennis all day long. In fact, I think longer matches play in his favor. He seems to like dropping a set, almost like he does it on purpose."

tennis,3da8og,CityofIndustry,5,Wed Jul 15 09:46:41 2015 UTC,And let's be real here. He's the second best player in the world by a long shot.
tennis,3da8og,MotherCanada,0,Tue Jul 14 23:11:43 2015 UTC,"Guess it depends on how you define long :) Not arguing that Novak isn't the clear #1 - he is at the moment, no doubt."
tennis,3da8og,TacticalTennis,5,Wed Jul 15 00:09:54 2015 UTC,I mostly meant in terms of people below him.
tennis,3da8og,MotherCanada,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:54:16 2015 UTC,"More than that, he was the best player in this year's Wimbledon coming into the match."
tennis,3da8og,avaliantheel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's worked pretty well for him - he's #2 in the world at 33.  Is it enough to beat another all time great in the prime of his career in 5 sets?   Apparently not, but that doesn't really detract from the overall strategy - no one else has a strategy to do that either, including those who are in the primes of their careers."
tennis,3da8og,dasponge,6,Wed Jul 15 02:07:15 2015 UTC,"I was upset at his overhitting in the Wimbledon final. As opposed to trying to hang in for a couple shots more on a lot of baseline points, he would pick difficult moments to go for lights-out winners and often made errors instead. They were all at critical moments. Djoker's errors (few and far between) were also at less dangerous moments, by and large."
tennis,3da8og,xscientist,6,Tue Jul 14 21:24:09 2015 UTC,I don't think he was overhitting.  He was going for shots that he confidently hit against Murray.  He just looked nervous in this year's final.  Every point was already a battle.  Extending it longer would have worn him out faster.  The rain delay also did him no favors.
tennis,3da8og,avaliantheel,5,Tue Jul 14 22:38:11 2015 UTC,"On more than one occasion he was pulled way off court by Dkoker, and instead of hitting a recovery shot, he'd try to hit a more insane crosscourt shot that he'd sail. This is only one of many examples. He was constantly shooting for winners when he was off balance. He was trying to end points too quickly right from the start."
tennis,3da8og,xscientist,2,Tue Jul 14 22:58:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I remember the points you're talking about.  He was definitely nervous and didn't play confident tennis.
tennis,3da8og,avaliantheel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:03:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, it was way too obvious how badly he wanted to keep the game from going past 3 sets. Painful to watch at times."
tennis,3da8og,bitchdantkillmyvibe,4,Wed Jul 15 01:01:16 2015 UTC,I think they meant improving compared to 2013. And I actually think if Federer was as rock solid at net as he is now he would have won more.

tennis,3da8og,jeffwingersballs,2,Tue Jul 14 20:34:27 2015 UTC,"If you magically made him 25 again, he would have to play differently than he did just because the game has changed. Players are more able to hit with power and spin from all over the court than they were 10 years ago, just like they were better 10 years ago than 20 (how the rate of change has changed is an interesting question)."
tennis,3da8og,plenty_of_time,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"His style of gameplay didn't significantly change until 2014, well into the new generation. Federer at 25 would just do it better than everybody else."
tennis,3da8og,Personacorona,4,Tue Jul 14 21:52:14 2015 UTC,Not entirely true. He started changing his game style back when he first started working With Annacone. That was when he started to come forward more as a part of their plan to get him another Wimbledon and back to #1. That was back in 2010.
tennis,3da8og,TacticalTennis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:59:05 2015 UTC,"I know, but the overall plan was the same: be an aggressive baseliner and dominate from the back of the court."
tennis,3da8og,Personacorona,4,Tue Jul 14 22:00:00 2015 UTC,"No he started to serve and volley a lot more, and began ghosting in during rallies more when he thought he could sneak forward and put away a volley. There was a lot more forward pressure from him as a part of their gameplan."
tennis,3da8og,TacticalTennis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:01:19 2015 UTC,"The only tournament I remember heavy serve and volley tactics is 2012 Wimbledon.  Besides that, all I remember from the Annacone years is a lot of chip and charge."
tennis,3da8og,avaliantheel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"It's a mixed bag. His serve is better than it used to be, so we have to take that into account. But some aspects of his tactics have definitely improved. He's far more aggressive on second serve returns these days, particularly off the backhand. That alone would have probably netted him at least one more FO title if he'd taken that mentality during his prime.  His volleys have improved too, so it makes sense that he's coming forward more, but a little more serve and volley back in 2004-2009 wouldn't have hurt him then either.  As a whole you're right - most of what he's doing now is an adaptation to changes in his game - some for the better, some for the worse."
tennis,3da8og,TacticalTennis,3,Tue Jul 14 21:56:31 2015 UTC,"He's far more aggressive on second serve returns these days, particularly off the backhand. That alone would have probably netted him at least one more FO title if he'd taken that mentality during his prime.   If it's not against Nadal, it doesn't mean much in that regard. He can do a lot of things to a lot of different players, and then when he runs into Nadal, it all goes out the window. And I don't remember him doing this against Nadal and it making any difference in recent years."
tennis,3da8og,TacticalTennis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:47:48 2015 UTC,Meh. Their last meeting was literally 18 months ago. Fed's sustained aggression level on the backhand return seems more recent to me than that.
tennis,3da8og,compuzr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:11:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like an aggressive return would be beneficial especially against Nadal, where you know where the ball is going. It might have helped his FO chances, but I definitely think it could have swayed the 2008 W final if he'd run around a few more backhands."
tennis,3da8og,peRFectTennis,3,Wed Jul 15 04:58:12 2015 UTC,Fed would have won 2 French Open's before his 09 victory had he returned more aggressively against Nadal and gone forward more. He had all the tools in this game then but stubbornly thought he could beat Nadal from the baseline on clay.
tennis,3da8og,TacticalTennis,0,Wed Jul 15 14:12:31 2015 UTC,"Running around the Nadal serve is difficult, because he has the lefty slice available. But stepping in and cracking some backhands would have made a world of difference. He was losing so many of the neutral rallies anyways, that it should have been a net gain for him even if he missed more returns overall."

tennis,3dbrxj,Jabroni0530,4,Wed Jul 15 01:37:44 2015 UTC,"Food is expensive.  Think movie theater prices.  A fast-food like meal might be $10 or more. Rain can be a pain.  Once it rains, play stops.  You can look into getting a rain-check, if you like. Pros tend to practice at the practice courts typically in the late mornings or early afternoons.  This is generally better in the first few days of the tournament when there are still other players As someone pointed out, you might be in the sun for hours, so prepare appropriately. Make sure camera isn't set to flash if you intend to take pictures Sometimes pros do a special event (I saw Dimitrov do a Q&A), so pay attention to that. There can be other side events, for example, at DC, they have a speed gun to measure your serve.  There can be lines for such stuff. Parking and leaving the site can be a pain at the end of the day, so be patient. Watch some doubles if you get a chance."
tennis,3dbrxj,dropshot,3,Wed Jul 15 13:00:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure what the weather's like there but be aware that you're often exposed, kinda like a festival or open air concert, so dress accordingly.  I usually get hot/sunburnt at tournaments so I always take sunglasses, hat, sunblock, water etc.  It might also be a good idea to check the website for what you can't take in, a lot of tournaments don't let you take metal objects, umbrella, long lens cameras, there probably will be bag checks at the entrance.  Eat a big breakfast because food's expensive."
tennis,3dbrxj,torchwar,3,Wed Jul 15 04:58:34 2015 UTC,"At Cincy they post the practice schedule every day (at least they did last year). When you enter the grounds, head left and you'll find the practice courts. You can see players there up close. It's a good way to watch someone you might not have a chance to see in a match.   Courts 9 and 4 are the un-televised ones. Watching matches on those courts is great because you're right up close to the players, and they're not thinking about cameras capturing their outbursts.   With most tickets you can get first-come-first-serve seats in the Grandstand (or any court other than Center Court where your seats are assigned). Get there a little early before a big match and you could be in one of the first few rows on the south side. Last year this court had that great Murray-Isner match.   Food is expensive at this tournament as others have pointed out, but it's mostly local businesses so a splurge or two can be worth the experience (try the chicken and waffles from Taste of Belgium). They don't allow big bags in the tournament grounds so it's hard to smuggle in food.   Kings Island is right across the street from the tournament grounds (though you'd want to drive there). That's worth one afternoon or evening if nothing else is going on. Last year some of the players tweeted about going there after falling out of the tournament which I thought was hilarious.   Mason, where the tournament is, is actually about 20-minutes north of the city by car and there's really no public transportation between the city and tournament grounds. I just mention that in case it matters for hotel booking.   Edit: when to get there -- on Mon through Wed I would get there before play starts, as soon as they'll let you in, if you want to see action on the practice courts. As the tournament progresses less is happening which means there are more people to compete with for seats at the practice courts. I would try to see practices the first few days (not that you're screwed if you can't do this and have to wait for the end of the week). By the way, the qualifier tournament is free, if I remember correctly?"

tennis,3dbrxj,PokeMyPillow,2,Wed Jul 15 18:07:17 2015 UTC,"How did I miss that? Just excited to talk about the tournament I guess. In that case, I would get there an hour/hour and a half or so before the matches, at the latest, so you can settled in and get something. The grounds are nice with tables and music. You could schedule the day around the practice sessions and get lunch. The practice courts will fill but it's not impossible to see them. You'll see best if you're there first. They make parking pretty easy so I wouldn't worry about that taking up too much time (and it's free). If it rains, there aren't many places to duck out of the weather in that crowd, so prepare for that. Also, don't pay $6 for Michelob ultra if you're getting a beer. Cinci is one tournament that allows other vendors who aren't tennis sponsors so there is a selection of local brews."

tennis,3d7p35,raftah99,17,Wed Jul 15 01:54:55 2015 UTC,Very cool chart. Looks like Nadal and Fed were equal at age 27. Fed and Rafa have twice as many slams as Djokovic at 27 as well.
tennis,3d7p35,thomas80anderson,2,Tue Jul 14 05:58:05 2015 UTC,So did Borg.
tennis,3d7p35,boredsole,26,Thu Jul 16 08:24:05 2015 UTC,"Contrary to popular opinion, I'd be surprised if Djokovic wins more than 3 from now on."
tennis,3d7p35,winabean7,46,Tue Jul 14 09:41:16 2015 UTC,"A lot of people think Djokovic is sure to catch up with Nadal or even Federer in Slam count, but that seems so hard to imagine when you look at how dominant he's been the past year, and he still hasn't won every Slam. Remember how he seemed invincible at the USO last year, and this year it seemed like he would be the inevitable champion at RG. But then a couple very talented players turn in an almost impossible performance, and the title is gone. Even at Wimbledon, he came shockingly close to exiting at the hands of Kevin Anderson - who could have seen that coming? The margins are small and the other guys are very motivated to beat him. It's a disservice to their talent and work ethic to think he has no competition. They're all practicing their asses off to beat him next time."
tennis,3d7p35,pfc_bgd,22,Tue Jul 14 13:38:53 2015 UTC,"If I had to bet, I'd bet that he'll win more than 3 more from now...But I wouldn't be too surprised if he doesn't. The thing is, it seems like he's hitting his prime a couple of years later than the Fed and Nadal, but he also seems to lose the matches that the Fed or Nadal would never lose in their prime (Stan the Man wouldn't beat Nadal on RG in Nadal's prime years, Fed wouldn't have lost to Nishikori in the US Open semis and so on).   Basically, I think he'll end up with something between 12 and 15 slams in his career. Which, you know, ""isn't too bad""."
tennis,3d7p35,dezholling,20,Tue Jul 14 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"I would say Federer losing to Del Potro in the 2009 US Open Final is almost exactly like Djokovic losing to Wawrinka in the 2015 French Open Final. Both had just turned 28 and lost to a powerhouse outside the Big 4 on a hot streak.  I think Djokovic will win at least 3 more, though, unless Raonic or some other young gun develops a more complete game soon."
tennis,3d7p35,pfc_bgd,14,Tue Jul 14 14:51:50 2015 UTC,"man, I kind of agree with your comparison and Federer's loss to Del Potro...but as well as Stan played the RG final, that shit from Delpo was UNREAL in the US Open final. Just hitting bombs from all over...so I give Federer a pass there."
tennis,3d7p35,BuntRuntCunt,8,Tue Jul 14 15:06:57 2015 UTC,Another example is Nadal losing to Soderling at RG in 2009. prime Nadal lost on his best surface to someone outside of the big 4.
tennis,3d7p35,TenNes,6,Tue Jul 14 15:56:05 2015 UTC,"Yup. Here's the thing, if a bigger stronger man just goes apeshit on one of the GOATS contenders, it doesn't really matter the big hitter can just over power them. Same thing happened to Sampras at Wimbledon against Krijec(sp?) and at the U.S. open against Safin. Just got blown up by a big hitter playing out of their mind."

tennis,3d7p35,calvinyo,2,Tue Jul 14 18:05:22 2015 UTC,"Wasn't Nadal dealing with tendonitis on both knees at that time and was out of Wimbledon right after as a result of it? I mean, not to discredit Soderling because he played the match of his life."
tennis,3d7p35,BuntRuntCunt,2,Thu Jul 16 00:50:39 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware of that, that helps explain it. I remember that match, it felt like DelPo 2009 in that he was blasting every shot and everything was going in. He just hit the zone and never took his foot off the gas."
tennis,3d7p35,chief_running_joke,3,Thu Jul 16 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Fed has only won 2 GS since then, so it might have been one of the first indicators of his decline."
tennis,3d7p35,waynechang92,3,Tue Jul 14 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"Jesus, when you describe someone slumping by ""only"" winning two Grand Slams..."
tennis,3d7p35,tinewashere,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:45 2015 UTC,well.. he IS 33...
tennis,3d7p35,chief_running_joke,5,Tue Jul 14 19:42:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he was 28 at the 2009 USO. Same age as Djokovic now, which is what we're talking about."
tennis,3d7p35,boredsole,3,Tue Jul 14 19:46:51 2015 UTC,"Correct, and I'd also add that while he's been the best and most consistent since 2011, he's 9/17 in slam finals. Neither Fed or Nadal have such low numbers over their whole careers.  Anything above 13 sounds crazy, but who knows, like you say he's not that bad!"
tennis,3d7p35,get_go,2,Tue Jul 14 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"I would say that he has started his prime in 2011, meaning that he has had a good 5 years including this year of prime years. Federer had 6 prime years before Nadal caught up with him (2004 - 2009). But, Federer still won 2 slams after 2009. So, its conceivable that Novak will win a few more before he is done. I think he will have another great year in 2016 and will probably win the French and Australian Open. I don't think he will reach Fed's count, but I can see him get close to Nadal's tally."
tennis,3d7p35,curious_Jo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:49:20 2015 UTC,Well OP said more than 3 so you are probably agreeing with each other.
tennis,3d7p35,redrummr,3,Tue Jul 14 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"Is it that popular of an opinion, though? Number of GS finals reached so far: 26 (Fed), 20 (Nadal), 18 (Djokovic). Federer won his first 7 slams (I believe) and has a roughly 2:1 win-to-loss ratio in GS finals, while Djokovic's ratio is a little better than 1:1 (won 9, lost 8). If Djokovic had been able to win at the same ratio Federer has had, he'd be looking at having 11 slams already. What's interesting is that I cringe whenever anybody I like plays Novak, because he has massive mental fortitude and you can never say he'll self-destruct like Tommy Haas or other players that have poor mental game. He is the strongest player, mentally, I've ever seen (I attended that match against Nadal at the Aus open). I know he must feel bummed at not making the most of his GS final appearances, because I believe he will reach 2 per year for the next 4 or 5 years, besting Federer. But unfortunately the win ratio will let him down -- but that's what tennis is all about, being better on the day. As long as Wawrinka and Murray are in the game, and others come up, Novak never has a sure thing in the final."
tennis,3d7p35,ttebow,2,Wed Jul 15 00:12:15 2015 UTC,"You have to look at the competition though. Novak has played Nadal, Murray, or Fed in all but TWO of his slam finals. Fed got to play the likes of baghdatis before the rise of Nadal. Even guys like, Roddick, Safin, and Hewitt who are borderline greats are nowhere near the caliber of player that Djokovic faces in every slam."
tennis,3d7p35,Lemurians,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:35:04 2015 UTC,"Certainly would make sense, given how Fed and Nadal struggled after that age. I think the catch is that Djokovic doesn't have nearly as much tough competition from people younger than him. I think he can catch Nadal, at least."
tennis,3d7p35,bumbleb333,-6,Tue Jul 14 20:23:41 2015 UTC,there is absolutely no one to contest him. andy murray has become his bitch and federer will not make the finals of any slam except wimbledon. nadal is an even bigger question mark
tennis,3d7p35,Stylus_XL,25,Tue Jul 14 10:41:44 2015 UTC,"Nole's game relies heavily on his ability to chase balls down, and he's in an age bracket now where raw athleticism starts to tail off. I'd be very surprised if he's still darting around at 30 like he is now."
tennis,3d7p35,bumbleb333,3,Tue Jul 14 11:43:35 2015 UTC,"yes his athleticism will tail off but it's not overnight, it will be a slow process. by the time he is a step slower i think he will easily have won a few more. the upcoming generation is just very weak"
tennis,3d7p35,boredsole,3,Tue Jul 14 12:04:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree, but like I said initially, people define ""a few more"" to be 5 or 6 by projecting his current dominance for 3 years. I really don't think that's the case looking at this graph, and what happens to people when they hit the 29 wall."
tennis,3d7p35,Stylus_XL,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:48:53 2015 UTC,Completely agree with you on the upcoming generation. There's some definite talent in there but there are no convincing prospects emerging yet.
tennis,3d7p35,bumbleb333,3,Tue Jul 14 12:39:57 2015 UTC,"The guys who are supposed to be in their prime (raonic, dimitrov, gulbis, nishikori) are too inconsistent/ lack the talent to go all the way in a major. cilic i think will be a one slam wonder, he played out of his mind for 2 weeks and has shown nothing close to that form since. And by the time the even younger prospects (thiem, kyrgios, zverev etc) enter their primes, djokovic will probably have snagged like 5-6 slams"
tennis,3d7p35,hivaidsislethal,-2,Tue Jul 14 13:04:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah but nobody is as dedicated to their body as Djokovic. The man's daily routine and dieting is insane, he is all in almost 24hours a day, everything is calculated minus when Stefan decides to poop himself."
tennis,3d7p35,Stylus_XL,23,Tue Jul 14 11:51:06 2015 UTC,You can fight as hard as you want but father time will always win. The effects of aging on speed and agility can't be stopped with dedication.
tennis,3d7p35,Thor395,5,Tue Jul 14 11:58:55 2015 UTC,You cant beat father time but you can sure as hell delay him. I think Djokovic will do just fine if he keeps his dedication up. Its the same way I feel about Cristiano Ronaldo. The man will continue to play beautiful efficient football all the way to at least 34 IMO.
tennis,3d7p35,Stylus_XL,16,Tue Jul 14 12:09:09 2015 UTC,"Longevity in sports like football and tennis depends a lot on how you play. Cristiano Ronaldo is a versatile forward - he could lose a yard of pace and still be very effective as he could transition to a role that doesn't necessarily require him to do so much running.  When Djokovic slows down a step people will be able to hit more winners past him and his defence - the foundation of his game - will become less effective. That's not to say he will plummet down the rankings, but his opponents will certainly have more openings to exploit."
tennis,3d7p35,Thor395,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:22:11 2015 UTC,I agree but I just think that Djoker has at least until 32 before we see major decline...I hope haha. You hit the nail right on the head with Cristiano though. This past season he transitioned into more of 9 and most of his goals didn't require blazing up the side of the pitch.
tennis,3d7p35,DanielAgger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:30:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Ronaldo is probably the most complete attacking player in the world right now, I'd even argue that he's the most complete attacking player of all time. He can easily lose a yard of pace and still be a very effective poacher. Heck, in his last two years, he's already transitioning to an effective poacher.   Djokovic's defence is immense, but has he got it in him to tune his game (to something totally different) as he loses a yard or two of pace? I'd love to be wrong but I don't think it is as easy as it is in football."
tennis,3d7p35,YoSoyMilkChocolate,3,Tue Jul 14 12:34:08 2015 UTC,"Have you forgotten that Leo Messi still exists? Ronaldo is nowhere near complete as an attacking player, he requires service from the midfield and other attackers. He isn't an effective creator (different from an assist maker)."
tennis,3d7p35,curious_Jo,2,Tue Jul 14 18:09:11 2015 UTC,"OP didn't say best player, Leo would have some problems losing a step or two, just like Djokovich. That said he is probably the best player of all time."
tennis,3d7p35,DanielAgger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"We only have to look at Argentina's dismal performances to realise that Messi relies on service from other players as well.   I never said Ronaldo is the better player. He just has a larger skill set than Messi. Physically, he's unmatched. He's very good at heading the ball, dribbling and finishing. His movement off the ball is immense as well.   I'm a huge fan of Messi. I like Messi more than Ronaldo, always have. But there's no doubt in my mind that Ronaldo is the more complete player.   Of course I was talking to a Barca fan. That'll explain your rabid defence of Messi."
tennis,3d7p35,ORCA_WoN,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:19:37 2015 UTC,No... he hasn't. He is quite right. Ronaldo can do and score with much more variety than Messi. Ronaldo had 22 assists this season whilst Messi had 26. Ronaldo played 3 less games. Check the facts before spewing nonsense.
tennis,3d7p35,tennisboy123,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:32:49 2015 UTC,"its not like djokovic is a defensive player he can play offensive tennis very good that was his trademark when he was 20 years old he mostly relied on offesnive baseline shots but over the years he evolved as a player and became better at counterpucnhing from defense to offense, as he drops pace he will just play more aggresive and with the competition now days i think he can catch up to nadal and fed"
tennis,3d7p35,hivaidsislethal,4,Tue Jul 14 14:21:43 2015 UTC,"But the effects can be slowed down, especially in today's era as proven by the fact that we have 10 players 30 or older in the Top 20, 4 in the Top 8. Sports science has improved so much, the longevity of careers has definitely increased in non contact sports and being able to perform at your peak longer."
tennis,3d7p35,Stylus_XL,4,Tue Jul 14 12:15:51 2015 UTC,"In terms of people 30 and over mounting serious challenges for slams, there's basically just Stan and Roger. Both play a more attacking style of tennis that doesn't require them to be as agile as players who rely a lot more on their defence to grind out wins."
tennis,3d7p35,hivaidsislethal,3,Tue Jul 14 12:29:06 2015 UTC,"In terms of any players mounting serious challenges for slams there is only Murray, Djokovic, Federer and Stan and maybe Nadal.....young  guns and the older players are playing at the same level basically, enough for the quarters and maybe a surprise semi."
tennis,3d7p35,boxxybrown3014,3,Tue Jul 14 12:46:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this assessment. It's true that 'young guns' like Dimitrov, Raonic, and Nishikori aren't seeing the success that we would expect in their peak years (Age 24-25), but they probably just aren't good enough. Look at the graphic there for Fed/Nadal/Djok. They were winning slams when they were 19-21. The players that are going to beat Djokovic are probably in that age or younger. I'd be looking out for a player like Nick Krygois, Alexander Zverev, Borna Coric, or Stefan Kozlov as the player that's going to end Novak's dominance. ATP Rankings by Age."
tennis,3d7p35,hivaidsislethal,6,Tue Jul 14 14:26:40 2015 UTC,"The game has changed too much and doesn't suit the 19-21 guys any more. Game is too physical at this moment with all the courts being slowed down, you can't really blast any of the top guys off the court, so older players even though they might be a step slower can still get to the balls and grind it out. Closest to blasting off court would be Stan against Djokovic at RG this year, but that was a rare performance.  The 19-21s just can't compete with that for now over 5 sets but in a few years it will be possible, their bodies are still physically maturing which leaves Djokovic a few more years to be at the top."
tennis,3d7p35,TDeath21,5,Tue Jul 14 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"One thing Djokovic has going for him that gives him a better chance at a higher number is having two slams per year on his best surface, where as Nadal and Federer only have/had one. Just imagine Federer or Nadal's numbers with two clay court slams or two grass slams. Obviously they're all three legends and it's awesome we have gotten to see them all compete against each other. It's just something to think about."
tennis,3d7p35,boredsole,6,Tue Jul 14 14:55:11 2015 UTC,"Novak hasn't really capitalized on that though. He's 1-4 in USO Finals. He should really have a few titles there.   This is also why the whole slam count comparison is absurd. It's all about conditions. Nadal is far and away the better player on slow/high bouncing surfaces. There is no metric to show otherwise but he's clearly not as good as Federer/Novak when it comes to faster/lower bouncing surfaces. Wimbledon has slowed down quite a bit and all the surfaces are similar speeds and this is helping the top guys stay consistent. In the 90s, if you won 1 slam + 2 masters you were no 1 and it isn't because everyone was shit it's because there was way more variance: the balls would change, the speeds would differ drastically week-to-week, best of 5 finals for masters, win 6 times in 7 days (impossible to play back-to-back masters) etc.   So just comparing raw numbers across eras won't give you anything meaningful."

tennis,3d7p35,Schwarzgerat,16,Tue Jul 14 19:06:08 2015 UTC,Crazy to think that Federer has won only 2 slams since he was about as old as Djokovic is now. I think Djokovic will manage to add a few more titles to his name by the time he turns 34.
tennis,3d7p35,UNICY,45,Tue Jul 14 07:01:55 2015 UTC,I think Djokovic will manage to add a few more titles to his name by the time he turns 34.   That's because he won't have a Djokovic or Nadal to compete against.
tennis,3d7p35,CrosseyedAndPainless,62,Tue Jul 14 09:35:03 2015 UTC,It's unfair that Djokovic doesn't have to compete against Djokovic.
tennis,3d7p35,h4rnt,15,Tue Jul 14 10:16:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's some bullshit, in many ways Djokovic has been the toughest opponent for Fed and Nadal, dethroning them both on their best surfaces. Without Djokovic standing in his way on hard courts, Djokovic will be hard to beat."
tennis,3d7p35,rhcp6131,16,Tue Jul 14 12:42:46 2015 UTC,I would argue the Djokovic never really dethroned Nadal despite the win this year since Nadal is just a shell of his former self at this point.
tennis,3d7p35,zack77070,26,Tue Jul 14 13:07:15 2015 UTC,I'd say Djokovic did pretty well at dethroning Nadal in 2011 when he beat Nadal six consecutive times in six finals.
tennis,3d7p35,HedgeOfGlory,7,Tue Jul 14 13:19:53 2015 UTC,He still only has a winning record at the AO against Nadal if we are talking just slams.

tennis,3d7p35,TenNes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"we arent talking about overtaking him as GOAT, he just dethroned him as ""the man"" in tennis. wtf do you think dethrone means"
tennis,3d7p35,HedgeOfGlory,9,Wed Jul 15 17:14:30 2015 UTC,Djokovic absolutely dethroned Nadal. He took all his majors from him in 2011 and effectively ended what looked to be the Nadal show for years to come in all 4 slams.
tennis,3d7p35,saposmak,7,Tue Jul 14 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"That wound has still not healed. (I'm talking about myself, not Rafa.)  I suppose this is how Fed fans feel about Rafa denying Fed of so many slam chances."
tennis,3d7p35,HedgeOfGlory,11,Tue Jul 14 15:37:14 2015 UTC,"It's almost always the case in sports though, it's just weird when it's people. You got the aging champ, and the younger party coming up, basing their strategy on how to beat the guy at the top.   Aging champ tries to hold on to the old strat or try something new, either way it's hard to keep winning because of age and the inertia of already having grown so accustomed to a style.   I'm just going to sit back and enjoy the fuck out of Djokovic's run because it won't last as long as we all think, maybe another 18-24 months of pure domination.   I was too attacked to Federer to really enjoy Rafa's reign, and honestly I spent several years not enjoying watching brilliant tennis because I couldn't get over Fed not being on top. I won't mAke that mistake with Djokovic, these talents are rare and it's a treat to see three of them playing at their peak for so many years in a row."
tennis,3d7p35,Gotebe,3,Tue Jul 14 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"Guess so, yeah.  You could even argue that Djok's superiority pushed Nadal, who in turn pushed his body beyond breaking point and resulted in what we have now - half a nadal"
tennis,3d7p35,Thooorin_2,3,Tue Jul 14 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to stay optimistic about his prospects for the future. He's healthy (he says he is) and he's still hungry to compete. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't even manage to make the WTF this season, but I expect him to come out strong next season. The Olympics will also make it interesting."
tennis,3d7p35,Thooorin_2,6,Tue Jul 14 15:51:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah no matter his results, he'll always have that ""smash everyone and win a slam"" potential because he's bloody terrifying when he's comfortable.  Still, there's stuff going on. Maybe his knees are worse than anyone is letting on, maybe he's got mono or something like Fed had, or just maybe (don't hate me, just a possibility) he's been forced to change his, ahem, ""fitness regime"""
tennis,3d7p35,yolo_swagovic2,2,Tue Jul 14 16:41:49 2015 UTC,"In 2011 already, he absolutely destroyed Nadal on clay, beating him in all clay matches except one (5, I think). Federer beat him in RG, so that's two lost clay matches, whereas nadal had 5.  Since then, Nadal's apparent clay supremacy is due to RG streak."
tennis,3d7p35,yaaa_gunners_yaaa,2,Wed Jul 15 04:17:21 2015 UTC,Sucks we'll never get to see what that year's RG final would have been like if Djokovic had made it.  He was primed to beat Nadal that time.
tennis,3d7p35,CityofIndustry,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:15:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it all evens out when you consider that Djokovic would likely have a bunch more titles, especially at the US Open, if it weren't for him having to play Federer and Nadal earlier in his career."
tennis,3d7p35,yaaa_gunners_yaaa,2,Wed Jul 15 16:14:42 2015 UTC,10/10 lol
tennis,3d7p35,bergamer,9,Tue Jul 14 16:42:02 2015 UTC,Well Federer won 12 slams before Nadal won anything other than the French and Djokovic won his first.
tennis,3d7p35,yaaa_gunners_yaaa,9,Tue Jul 14 09:41:36 2015 UTC,I'm talking about from the ages of 28-34. No one is playing at the level Djoko and Nadal were playing at when Federer was that age. The door is wide open for Djokovic to sweep up some Grand Slams now. Federer never had that luxury.
tennis,3d7p35,bergamer,8,Tue Jul 14 09:47:04 2015 UTC,"Conversely you can clearly argue Federer ratcheted up the slams before any legitimate rivals entered. Nadal and Djokovic have up until three years ago always had Federer there. Murray is another factor because he has go to so many finals and semi-finals all in Djokovic's age - there was no one like that during Federer's early years. Roddick got to 10 finals and semis, Murray has already got to 17."
tennis,3d7p35,gg_2015,5,Tue Jul 14 09:50:18 2015 UTC,"His point was about OP's claim that ""Djokovic will manage to add a few more titles"", not about legacy.  Facts so far would disagree with them though. It's interesting to note that in the past two years, Djokovic only lost ONCE in a slam to a fellow Big4. He took the other 3 slams against them but lost 3 times to other players.  If anything, It would seem better for Djokovic to avoid a ""weak era"" and keep his Big4 pals around.  Edit: was op's claim"
tennis,3d7p35,Personacorona,10,Tue Jul 14 11:22:36 2015 UTC,"There can be no disputing that the during the early to middle years of Federer's grand slams wins there was no coherent competition challenging him on a regular basis. Of course the players he played were good but   Clearly that is different with the early to middle parts of Nadal and Djokovic's careers who have not only had to face each other, but also Federer.   Federer played Phillipososus, Safin, Roddick, Hewitt, Roddick again, an ageing Aggasi, Baghdatis in his first 7 grand slam finals.   In Nadal's first 8 grand slam finals he played Puerta once and Federer 7 times."
tennis,3d7p35,avaliantheel,10,Tue Jul 14 11:26:05 2015 UTC,"On that topic I would agree they were partly weaker opponents, but the comparison is hard to make.  I believe that Nadal is partly a creation of Federer, and Djokovic is now an extraordinary mutant result of both. Just like current Federer has evolved both to spare his body and to adapt, in turn, to them.  Basically, there's no way to judge any of them carreer-wise in a vacuum. There's no way to know into what kind of player they would have developped out of the blue.  Federer brought something new and his peers could not immediately adapt, a generation then invented a way to counterpunch and neutralize him, and now a generation is trying to counter those guys by overpowering and dislodging them.  But that's more on the legacy side. We'll see, says the Zen master."
tennis,3d7p35,Jackofalll,8,Tue Jul 14 11:32:46 2015 UTC,"Not how I'd explain it but I somewhat agree. It's not the lack of talent or competition from the rest of the field. Fed just completely dominated them until they mentally submit. He exhibited such mastery, sort of like the mastery Nadal puts on him on clay and then everywhere in grand slams since 2008.   No one can properly explain how even the great Fed struggled so much against Nadal, clay or not. How is his record against Djoker and Murray so much better and more even? Don't underestimate the psyche of those top players. Everyone can be vulnerable."
tennis,3d7p35,17to85,10,Tue Jul 14 12:42:18 2015 UTC,No one can properly explain how even the great Fed struggled so much against Nadal   Easy. Matchups. The high lefty topspin to the Federer backhand is killer.

tennis,3d7p35,Jackofalll,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:14:30 2015 UTC,Fucking thank you. People are ridiculous and don't realize Fed actually had it easier than Nadal or Djokovic do now. I mean Roddick was his number 1 consistent competitor in slams...
tennis,3d7p35,Thooorin_2,5,Tue Jul 14 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"Was Roddick that useless as a top player or was he just unfortunate to be in his prime at the same time as Federer was unbeatable? That's really the question that needs to be decided. Was the era really that weak or was Federer just that good? What we see now is an era where the top 3 or 4 guys are just so much better than everyone else, does that make it a stronger era or is it stronger when there are more people who could conceivably win and you didn't see the top 4 consistently making the semi finals because someone upset them along the way?"
tennis,3d7p35,Jackofalll,2,Tue Jul 14 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"Well I think the thing that makes it easier for me to say the era was weaker is just the lack of consistency of anyone else getting to the finals so often. No one in that era was anywhere near as consistant as djokovic or nadal or even murray. Roddick in between grand slam finals was consistently getting knocked out in early rounds, this seems to say he wasn't the same type of competition. Not that he wasn't making a lot of quarters and semis too, but a decent amount of 1st/2nd/3rd/4th round exits. Also he was a lot worse on clay than the current bunch."
tennis,3d7p35,tennisboy123,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, he was good, don't get me wrong, just not as versatile as Djoker or Nadal to be able to properly compete with Fed. Fed was leagues above his competition in those years, until Nadal and Djoker came along. Djoker and Nadal in Fed's time would do about the same damage as Fed did IMO. These 3 are generational stars, which is greater than a superstar."
tennis,3d7p35,thederpmeister,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"Djoker and Nadal in Fed's time would do about the same damage as Fed did IMO   Djokovic would do very well, due to his all-around game, but I think you're over-reaching in terms of Nadal.  You could make a very good case that Nadal played during the perfect period of time for him, since he was hitting his prime when most of Federer's true peers were getting older, when he was one of the oldest in the younger generation (Del Potro, Tsonga, Djoker, Murray etc.) and when he was primed to have a huge overlap of entering his own prime while Federer was well into his own and about to exit it.  That's a great recipe for a lot of slams.  Even in spite of those favourable conditions, the fact that nine of Nadal's 14 slams came solely at RG is telling.  Look at some of the people Nadal lost to in slams from age 21 onwards (Summer of 2007):   Federer Ferrer x2 22 year old Tsonga 21 year old Murray Söderling 21 year old Juan Martín del Potro 22 year old Murray Prime Djokovic x3 Darcis Rosol   That's all ignoring his 2015 season, when he has obviously struggled.  So those losses are all from slam winning years and with me giving the benefit of the doubt on his first two or so slam years, since he was so young.  Point being, that aside from the loss to Federer, who he benefited from to wins slams from many times on other occasions, and prime Djokovic, his competition he is losing to at the other slams is hardly to be argued as being significantly better than that of Federer's prime.  Prime Hewitt, Roddick, Safin, Nalbandian, Davydenko and Coria were no joke."
tennis,3d7p35,PenguinWriter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:47:51 2015 UTC,"Ok sure I actually agree with that. If Nadal doesn't pull out of this slump soon, like by early next year, and Djokovic persists his ongoing achievements, it's going to be hard to argue that Nadal was better than Djoker in his career."
tennis,3d7p35,haroldbaals,0,Wed Jul 15 20:19:57 2015 UTC,never had that luxury? LOL just look at his opponents in 03-07 if the competitors federer had during his prime years were starting at the same age as nole and  andy they would have been at their best top 20
tennis,3d7p35,avaliantheel,2,Tue Jul 14 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"No one is at Djokovics level right now.  I honestly think he's going to dominate for the next 4-5 years. The younger generation just isn't ready yet. Obviously there will be losses to the top 8 players sprinkled here and there, but no one on the tour is quite as consistent as him.  I can see him ending with 14 or 15 slams."

tennis,3d7p35,TDeath21,5,Tue Jul 14 15:16:13 2015 UTC,Djokovic's career from February 2008 to August 2010 could've been so much more fruitful. I think he'll win 4 more Slams and end on 13.

tennis,3d7p35,Disastrously_Dazed,8,Tue Jul 14 05:34:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think slam count is all that matters. Nadal has a legit argument over fed with less slams. Although that mostly has to do with their lopsided h2h. I still think Djokovic would have to get very close to 17, and reach a bunch of other milestones (weeks at 1, Olympic medal) if he wants to be the goat."
tennis,3d7p35,vedderer,16,Tue Jul 14 07:32:13 2015 UTC,"If you really analyze it though, head to head is also an extremely skewed statistic. When all the criteria is added up and analyzed, there's no question that Federer is the best ever."
tennis,3d7p35,Disastrously_Dazed,4,Tue Jul 14 15:08:56 2015 UTC,"I agree... head to head means almost nothing to me 'cause of match-ups.  If Fed had a two-handed backhand, he's probably do better against Nadal, but would do worse against the entire field.  I wouldn't make that trade at all.  Plus, Nadal had losing records (at least until right before they retired) to James Blake and David Nalbandian.  No one would say that they were better than Nadal.  In tennis, it's how you do against the field, not how you do against a specific opponent."

tennis,3d7p35,theheartstheif,12,Tue Jul 14 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"No problem. Head to head is extremely skewed because there are many times Roger was good enough to make deep runs on Nadal's best surface (clay). Meanwhile, Nadal would be very sporadic in the fact that he was either on his A game for the tournament (on any surface) or got put out in the early rounds. It's not fair to punish Federer by looking at head to head record simply because even when he was struggling in a tournament he'd still make a deep run, only to run into an on point Nadal.  Think of it in a racing analogy, which is the best I can come up with. In 10 races, Federer gets 4 wins and 6 second place finishes. Nadal gets 6 wins, a 2nd place finish, and finishes 36th three other times. Just because Federer was good enough to consistently be in the top two, even when not playing well, can't be used against him. Where as Nadal wouldn't even make it deep enough in the tournament to play Federer when he struggled, often getting knocked out before the quarterfinals.  Most of their meetings are on clay, which will again skew it because Nadal is the best clay court player ever. Also remember there's always someone who just happens to match up well with you or have your number. I don't think anyone would ever claim Eli Manning is a better all time QB than Tom Brady, but when they go head to head, Eli has his number.  A more fair way to examine any two players would be to look at all tournaments they both entered and see how each of them did. That would be extremely time consuming, so I'm not going to do that. You'd most likely find that Federer made many deep runs or won the tournament when Nadal made an early exit. You'd of course find many where Nadal did make a deep run and played Federer, winning most of the time. As I said previously though, punishing Federer just because he's always there isn't right."
tennis,3d7p35,avaliantheel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"Which is why I think you shouldn't debate GOAT as a career achievement. It's so hard to compare # of 1st place finishes vs # of 2nd place finishes.  Personally, I like thinking about GOAT as a moment. For example, comparing Nadal 2010 vs Djokovic 2011 vs Federer 2007."
tennis,3d7p35,gibisee4,3,Tue Jul 14 18:01:58 2015 UTC,"That's a peak vs peak argument not a GOAT arguement. GOAT argument is a player's career achievements measured up to one another, major titles, masters, olympics, ATP finals, h2h... edit: weeks at world number 1.... edit2: obviously for a complete answer you have to dig deeper and analyze when and how all the career achievements came to be, but it's so hard to be objective about that. For example, Fed did have softer competition for his first 6-7 slams, Nadal won most of his GS on clay, Djokovic peaked later than Nadal and Fed...It's hard to be objective about facts like these and then coming up with a GOAT. There's probably no wrong answer with these 3 (considering Djokovic wins a few more majors) even still he has more masters than Fed. And for everyone thinking Pete would have a chance vs. these guys you're living in la la land."
tennis,3d7p35,avaliantheel,0,Tue Jul 14 19:23:14 2015 UTC,"Moment v any other moment is fun though :). For example, Sampras at 2002 US vs Federer 2015 Wimbledon... Who had a better late age tournament?  Whenever GOAT career comes around, you have to weight placements different. That sucks. What does X 3rd place finishes compare to Y 2nd places finishes? Why?

In an ideal world, especially when considering the last 15 years, one should also take into account Masters tournaments, starting with the 1000s, albeit not at the same level of value as slams.  The more data we have, combined with the eye test and a keen understanding of the context of the results, the more we have to go on to make our judgements.  Simply concluding that 17 is a larger number than 14 doesn't seem like a meaningful way to judge who is the best player."
tennis,3d7p35,thomas80anderson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:02:33 2015 UTC,100% agreed. People saying Novak needs 17 slams to be in the GOAT conversation (or any similarly crazy statement) are deluded.

Murray could have been another one, but well...  Djokovic doesn't have anyone aged 24-26 that could be a direct threat to him for another couple of years, IMO. Nishikori/Cilic/Goffin/Dimitrov? I don't think so. The only one who could elevate his game is Nishikori, but he seems to be often injured."
tennis,3d7p35,shittylob,3,Tue Jul 14 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"When Federer won his 15th slam, most people said he'd win 20 because Novak wasn't doing anything, Murray wasn't challenging enough and Nadal was injury prone and there was no one else coming up to beat him. He won 2 slams since then. Nobody saw Novak 2011 happening.  When Nadal won his 13th slam, he was supposed to win 18-20. He's won 1 since.   In a year/two years' time you don't know who will break through and how injuries will affect Novak. People just get carried away after one slam result. If Novak would've lost the final, ""oh he sucks he doesn't have the mental fortitude of Nadal/Federer, he's not going to win any more slams, etc."" I think Novak will be fine and win a few more but I doubt he will continue dominating for years to come. Even though he's been by far the best player the last few years he has lost a few finals and been upset in slams."
tennis,3d7p35,spockywocky,2,Wed Jul 15 02:19:37 2015 UTC,"The big problem is basically that people both underestimate the rise of the next talents and overestimate how long someone's prime will last.  It's always difficult both to judge when someone will go into god-mode, since it tends to be less gradual and more of a small change snapping them into it, and that the best players don't just slide off the top, they tend to lose their footing and then free-fall.  Trying to look more than a year into the future of tennis is very difficult, although it's obviously fun to speculate and that should not be discouraged."

tennis,3d52x3,danhamm,47,Mon Jul 13 16:34:41 2015 UTC,"Not that it matters, but the photo on the right isn't from 2015. The serve speed board is different now, and in that photo James Keothavong is in the chair. This year, Ali Nili was the chair umpire."
tennis,3d52x3,danhamm,20,Mon Jul 13 18:36:14 2015 UTC,You know I honestly wondered about that. I couldn't find anything to verify it was or wasn't 2015 so I just made an assumption. I didn't think to look up the chair umps or the scoreboards. I was looking at ball boys (hard because they rotate) and outfits/racquets (look the same.) How did you notice the difference in serve speed board? It's such an extremely small change.
tennis,3d52x3,rushingphoenix,28,Mon Jul 13 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"My first thought that was that the colour of the grass looked a little different to the colour that I was used to seeing on TV, but of course that could be for many different reasons. I then looked at the serve speed board and noticed that it was using the old font (I'm a bit of a font-geek so notice these kinds of things!). From the 2012 tournament and prior they used this font: http://i.imgur.com/k4kB3Ql.jpg And 2013 onwards they used this font: http://i.imgur.com/Mp91OH4.jpg Also I didn't remember seeing 'speed of serve' written on the board during this year's tournament!"

tennis,3d52x3,ADM31,10,Wed Jul 15 09:15:06 2015 UTC,"I do have to think at least part of it is improvements in the science of groundskeeping. The grass holds up better now. Also, fescue, which used to make up 25% of the grass, turns brown versus ryegrass that stays green.   If course, most if it is the loss of serve and volley, but there have been other changes."

tennis,3d52x3,get_go,31,Mon Jul 13 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"Everyone always talks about how they miss the serve-and-volley days. This is maybe cause I'm not old enough (21) to remember those days, but I have to say I prefer the baseline style of play. The long breathtaking baseline rallies are my favourite."
tennis,3d52x3,Personacorona,24,Mon Jul 13 17:06:05 2015 UTC,"Personally, I prefer the 03-08 days in terms of regular play(Not because Federer was dominating). The points from 03 to 08 were usually medium-long length rallies on fast courts that ended with winners or forced errors. The players got pushed around and had to use variety to win. Basically in that day you had to be aggressive, consistent, and have variety to win. Federer did this better than anyone else, and he won 13 Slams as a result."
tennis,3d52x3,kopkiwi,20,Mon Jul 13 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"This was the transition period from pure serve and volley to the all court game whose greatest exponent is Federer. With the improvement in racquets and strings reaching a point where passing shots were no longer a rarity, a more baseline game which waits for the short ball to finish of the point has become predominant."
tennis,3d52x3,Personacorona,8,Mon Jul 13 17:44:42 2015 UTC,"I mean the strings were mostly the same back then, just the courts were so much quicker and lower bouncing."
tennis,3d52x3,HedgeOfGlory,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:47:09 2015 UTC,I miss Kuerten on clay during that period. Fuck he was a joy to watch. Possibly would have kept a couple of Clay court titles from Nadal had he not been hammered with injuries.
tennis,3d52x3,MisguidedGuy,2,Tue Jul 14 02:25:21 2015 UTC,Tbh I didn't watch tennis in 2003. And 2008 was the year where courts started to slow down. I'll still add it though.
tennis,3d52x3,blue_horse_shoe,-17,Mon Jul 13 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"He also won 13 slams partly due to the lack of real rivals though.  If you put people like Djok and Murray into '03, the game becomes much more about the baseline immediately because they're so damn good at it. It's not just about the courts slowing down - grass is still fast as hell - it's also about the athleticism of the players being much less back then."
tennis,3d52x3,Personacorona,13,Mon Jul 13 17:38:26 2015 UTC,"To say that Federer had no real rivals is hugely disrespectful to all the professional players who competed during his dominance. He was challenged many times in the tournaments he won. The only difference between him and the rest of the field was his consistency. He made a lot of slam finals because of this. He won them because he was the best, not because the field was overrun with untalented hacks.  And the fact remains that if Federer had lost half of those 16 finals then no one would be saying that he had no rivals (other than Nadal).   Please can we put the weak era nonsense to bed at last?"

tennis,3d52x3,gg_2015,6,Tue Jul 14 01:33:26 2015 UTC,"The grass at Wimbledon(or Queen's) is not fast at all. Halle stays truest to traditional grass. Also, hardcourts are nowhere near as fast."
tennis,3d52x3,RegularFreddieWilson,5,Tue Jul 14 06:53:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's so much the serve and volley that people miss. It's more that the differences between the surfaces are less extreme.  In the nineties you had players that would do really well at certain tournaments, but become pretty pedestrian at others. Whereas nowadays, the top players go deep in pretty much every tournament they play."
tennis,3d52x3,DESTROYER3264,3,Mon Jul 13 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"Me too, except I'd rather see a mix of them used to great effect, like Federer has. Net plays are always so exciting, and it wouldn't be fun to just watch long baseline to baseline rallies. I hate long matches in general, bc very rarely are they high quality throughout. They'd just feel dragged out."
tennis,3d52x3,Phlypp,3,Mon Jul 13 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"I love how the game is played now, but I do miss some of the old serve volley tennis. Not Pete Sampras era, but earlier. Go back to some 1970s wimbledon and it's a totally different game. It's a whole other skill set almost. Wonderful to watch. Not better or worse really, just different and just as impressive."
tennis,3d52x3,Sebastien447,5,Mon Jul 13 20:38:53 2015 UTC,I think the people who say that are mainly just enjoying the era more so than finding a pretty linear strategy very exciting.
tennis,3d52x3,tinmanfrisbie,7,Mon Jul 13 22:23:47 2015 UTC,It could be their personal preferences for playing too. I prefer to watch serve and volley because that's how I play.
tennis,3d52x3,17to85,4,Mon Jul 13 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. It's probably more fascinating to see players play your style but so much better, rather than seeing a different style all together. I'm a baseliner myself and that's probably one of the reasons I prefer watching that too."
tennis,3d52x3,DelTrotter,2,Mon Jul 13 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"Whenever I watch modern tennis, I think about how boring baseline play must be to non-tennis players. Volley and net play adds a lot of needed variety to those who aren't following the nuances of baseline."

tennis,3d52x3,imdungrowinup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:05:45 2015 UTC,"I grew up when they transitioned from the small wooden rackets.  I miss them.  Overall it was much more a game of finesse.  Depending on the court it would still favor a certain style of play.  The game now still deals with precision but baseliners can just bang the hell out of the ball on all the courts much more than before.  I still love watching it, though."
tennis,3d52x3,DanielAgger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:13:41 2015 UTC,If you aren't old enough to remember it how can you really say you prefer baseline play? No one serves and volleys anymore and they haven't for a while. Yeah some guys try and come to net more often but it's still a far cry from the serve and volley game of the past.
tennis,3d52x3,imdungrowinup,2,Tue Jul 14 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"Quite a few players inside the top 100-150 still serve and volley, and they mostly come out during the grass season. Always a few of them in first and second round at Wimbledon."

That moment when Djokovic slided and tore up the baseline, making a deep scar in the court, made me cringe like watching someone scrape a chalkboard with their fingernails. Can't they replant sections of the court throughout the tournament or is that against the ethos of Wimbledon?"

If they laid seed down at the close of play one day it would not have grown enough (if at all) before play starts again between 11am and 2pm.   It took weeks to get the courts reconditioned between Wimbledon 2012 and the Olympics, even then the new grass was weak and came out faster than usual."

tennis,3d9ldm,PoopOnGod,3,Tue Jul 14 16:27:59 2015 UTC,"Ah right, how did I forget 2011?"
tennis,3d9ldm,btaz,10,Tue Jul 14 17:04:57 2015 UTC,The most recent man to win 3 slams a year is Novak Djokovic himself in 2011.
tennis,3d9ldm,btaz,6,Tue Jul 14 16:19:36 2015 UTC,"I think Wawrinka had a phenomenal year. The only player who had a better year was Djokovic. Let's see - we had 5 masters and 3 GS. 4 were won by Djokovic, 1 Murray in the Masters and 2 GS for Djokovic and 1 for Wawrinka. Also from a career point of view - Stan goes from another top 10 player on the tour to a top 5 player and multiple GS winner. Many thought his Aus Open was a one off but he proved them wrong (I was one). For me, Stan's year is a successful one. Anything else he does is a bonus.  We have been so used to the Big 4 winning a couple of Masters and a GS in the same year that we do not think it is a big deal if someone wins only a GS."
tennis,3d9ldm,DRUNKTENNIS,2,Tue Jul 14 18:38:57 2015 UTC,"Certainly, within the context of what we thought was possible, Stan is exceeding himself, but I am looking at whether he can be a threat to win Slams consistently.  Of course, few would have thought that was possible when he won the Australian Open, and few expected he'd win a second Slam.  Having said that, I think, despite a great accomplishment at the French, it's still iffy whether he continues to add to his total.  Clearly, our expectations are different for Stan vs. Novak, and maybe it's unfair to compare them that way, but that's kind of what I'm doing.  Sure, if, say, Tomic wins a Slam in a year's time, we'd be really surprised.  But yes, I agree Stan's had a great year, just not entirely sure if I expect he can take that into the US Open and threaten to win a title or not."
tennis,3d9ldm,winabean7,3,Tue Jul 14 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"But that is the thing with Stan. He is kind of the X-factor. If he fails, it is no surprise. But if he wins, he does that by bulldozing through everyone. It is pretty entertaining for a neutral fan.   I personally feel that for him winning Masters or other tournaments are not as important as making it in a GS. I mean he has made a habit of showing up on the big stage in the past two years. 2014 Aus Win, 2014 US Open Semi, 2015 Aus Open Semi, 2015 French Win, 2015 Wimbledon Semi, quarters but was pretty close. This is a pretty damn good record. I think he pushed Novak in 2013 US Open as well. So there is no reason to believe that he will not turn up at the US Open. The other Masters - I think he sees them as warm up tournaments - if he wins like he did last year at Monte Carlo - he will take it but I don't think that is his top priority -i.e. winning at Masters.   EDIT: he made 2015 Wimby quarters not semis  EDIT: I think he will be extremely motivated to win US Open. Look at it this way - he won AUS and French. Wimbledon is pretty difficult for his style of play but US Open - that is attainable for his style. And he knows he can do it."
tennis,3d9ldm,DRUNKTENNIS,2,Tue Jul 14 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"I was wondering what would have happened if Stan had won Wimbledon.  Murray has had more chances winning Masters 1000 titles and reaching Slam finals.  But if Stan had won, he'd have 3 Slam to Murray's 2, and be one short of a career Slam.  Would we have made Stan the new big 4?"
tennis,3d9ldm,TroyDangles,12,Tue Jul 14 19:18:38 2015 UTC,Yet another dropshot post hating on Berdych. The man is having a career year. Achieved a career high ranking of #4. #5 on the year to date moneylist. So what if an on-fire gilles simon takes him out at wimbledon? Berdych has him almost tripled in 2015 prize money. He has tsonga more than tripled. Clay is his worst surface anyway. 40-12 is not disappointing.
tennis,3d9ldm,onairmastering,8,Tue Jul 14 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"If we look at Berdych's year through the lens of his ranking and consistency, he's definitely not had a disappointing year. He was pretty much a lock to make at least the QFs of any tournament until the French Open. But to dropshot's point, people expect Berdych to threaten the Big 4 - or Big 3, whichever way you see it - more like Wawrinka's done, and he hasn't quite met up to that (really, really high) standard. But again, I don't think Berdych would look back on what he's done so far this year and be disappointed in the slightest."
tennis,3d9ldm,TacticalTennis,5,Tue Jul 14 17:40:16 2015 UTC,Berdych is 29 so he has maybe a year or two more of earning prize money at this rate. When its all said and done he could easily finish 7th in career prize money. And this is supposed to be considered a disappointing career.
tennis,3d9ldm,deadpansnarker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:59:41 2015 UTC,"It's just because he has the game to threaten the top players more than he has done. Every player's career has to be judged through the lens of how good it could potentially be. He's made one Slam final and several more semifinals, and looking at it he could/should have had one major win by now.   Basically, had he just have beaten Rafa in 2010 I think people would've viewed his career a lot differently."
tennis,3d9ldm,TacticalTennis,7,Tue Jul 14 18:26:13 2015 UTC,Dropshot doesn't like or understand Berdych.
tennis,3d9ldm,deadpansnarker,3,Tue Jul 14 16:52:17 2015 UTC,"How Cilic has won a Slam and Berdych, my favorite Monday to Thursday player with his height and his one-step before serving is fucking beyond me. And I did not go to work last year to watch the USO. Damn."
tennis,3d9ldm,TacticalTennis,6,Wed Jul 15 02:23:47 2015 UTC,That Wimbledon final turned on a dime. One sloppy service game from Fed while up a break in the first made all the difference. If not for that we might well be talking about Fed's 8th Wimbledon and 18th slam. To act like he didn't have a chance in that match is mildly crazy I think.
tennis,3d9ldm,PedroSampras,2,Tue Jul 14 16:24:21 2015 UTC,I can't say I agree that allowing the break back in the 1st set was the difference maker of the match. The bigger difference I think was Roger failing to break early in the 3rd and Djokovic succeeding with the break and not looking back. After that he was in control the rest of the match
tennis,3d9ldm,TacticalTennis,0,Tue Jul 14 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"Prior to that game, Fed was playing loose (in a good way). After it he was not quite the same. But more importantly, Feds record when up 2 sets to 0 in 5 set matches is phenomenal. He's an incredible front runner.  But the moment he got down 2 sets to 1 his odds of winning the match were very, very low. He's never beaten Djokovic in 5. Ever."
tennis,3d9ldm,vedderer,2,Tue Jul 14 20:08:05 2015 UTC,Do any of the top guys not have a phenomenal record when up 2 sets to 0?
tennis,3d9ldm,dannhash,0,Tue Jul 14 21:33:51 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they are all pretty good in that regard. Until 2011 against Tsonga, Federer had never lost a match at a slam when up 2 sets to 0. It's an exceedingly rare thing for him. It's probably pretty rare for Djokovic too :)"
tennis,3d9ldm,Personacorona,2,Tue Jul 14 21:53:22 2015 UTC,"Of course he had a chance, but most tennis matches at this level can be boiled down to a few critical points.   You could say that Novak got sloppy/timid at 6-3 up in the tiebreak. I really doubt that Fed lost because of one game in the first set."
tennis,3d9ldm,avaliantheel,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:29 2015 UTC,My point is just that - it was a high level match that really could have gone either way. Dropshot writes as though Fed had no chance.

tennis,3d9ldm,winabean7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:54:49 2015 UTC,It literally changed with two shots.... One was the first volley he missed HORRIBLY on the first point of the game after he broke djokovic in the first set....and then the shot in the third set he hit ten metres long which should have been an easy put away to give djoko the break
tennis,3d9ldm,Personacorona,4,Tue Jul 14 18:01:20 2015 UTC,Federer has had a great 2015 in my opinion
tennis,3d9ldm,avaliantheel,6,Tue Jul 14 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"3rd round of AO, 3rd round of Monte Carlo, 2nd round of Madrid, QF of FO.  This is not a good year for Roger.  This is a good year for most players, but it's a bad year by Roger's standards.  Too many early round exits in important tournaments.  FO loss is okay because he lost to the champion.  He has only won 250 and 500 events where he was the top seed aside from Dubai."
tennis,3d9ldm,Personacorona,6,Tue Jul 14 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"He got to the finals of Indian Wells, and has won more tournaments at this point in the year than last year. I'm sure he'll rake in a couple of Masters, possibly the WTF. Not sure about any more slams.   Focus on the positives! That's what he does."
tennis,3d9ldm,boredsole,7,Tue Jul 14 17:52:13 2015 UTC,Finals of Rome too. One of three guys to beat Djokovic this year. And at least had the same result at Wimbledon even if he didn't win. I'd say it's a very good year for non-peak Federer.
tennis,3d9ldm,Personacorona,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:56:38 2015 UTC,"Probably the second best since 2010, second so far to 2012."

tennis,3d9ldm,avaliantheel,2,Tue Jul 14 20:02:50 2015 UTC,Why not Paris? Indoors is his thing.   I'd be more dubious about Cincinnati/Toronto since they're outdoors and Cincinnati is the last Masters Djoko hasn't won.

tennis,3d9ldm,Personacorona,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:30:38 2015 UTC,"He's won a tournament on every surface this year. The other year's he's done that? 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2012. And those were all pretty good years. He's had 2 bad losses this year, to Seppi in the AO and to Monfils in MC. The Kyrgios match was unbelievably close, 1 point decided that match. And he lost to Wawa in the FO, but then again so did everybody. He's made the finals of 7 of the 11 tournaments he's contested, and has won 4 of them. And the tournaments he lost early in were tournaments he hasn't historically done extremely well on. Yes, he's won 4 AO, but 3 of them were on Rebound Ace and the only other time he won was in 2010 when he only played Murray. He won Madrid in 2012 but that was on Blue Clay, and the best person he played was Berdych. Other than that, he's never won MC and he only won the FO once. All the tournaments he would be expected to do well in he has. This season isn't shit because of a couple of bad losses when he's done well everywhere else. I understand, Roger historically has been very consistent. But his new style of play hampers his ability to win on slow surfaces. Everywhere else, he has excelled. And he's also playing so much better than he has been in the last two years."

tennis,3da1q6,srij93,5,Tue Jul 14 17:50:20 2015 UTC,"Two things to know when purchasing US Open tickets;  The only court that requires tickets, is Arthur Ashe. If you purchase a day/night grounds pass, you can walk around the entire center, and go watch whoever you please.  The later you go in the tournament, the less there will be to watch (obviously). If you are a casual watcher, I would suggest going the first Friday or Thursday. There will be plenty of seeded players on outer courts (one year I got to see Nishikori front row).   Basically, if you get a groundspass for the first Thursday or Friday, there will be enough of every type of event to satisfy what ever you feel like watching."
tennis,3da1q6,Pinbenterjamin,2,Tue Jul 14 18:25:04 2015 UTC,"I also have a question, it says the qualifiers or whatever are free so is there any way for me to know who is playing?  Second question, if I want to see Djokovic play, what is the best ticket or ground pass or day etc to look for? I'm very new to this"
tennis,3da1q6,Thor395,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:38:38 2015 UTC,"it says the qualifiers or whatever are free so is there any way for me to know who is playing   There are 128 men and 128 women in each of   the main draws.   104 spots are reserved for the highest ranked players, 8 spots are wildcards (the organizers get to choose 8 players ranked outside of the top 104 to get automatic entry), and 16 spots are for the qualifiers.    128 men compete for the 16 qualifying spots and similarly 128 women compete for the 16 qualifying spots. So these will be tennis players ranked roughly from 110 to 230 in the world.   The wiki page for the 2014 men's qualifying might give you an idea how it works.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_US_Open_–_Men%27s_Singles_Qualifying"

If it is for any of the earlier rounds, like 3R and before(I really do hate this about the US Open) then there are usually 2 womens matches and 1 mens match for the day session of Ashe. If I remember correctly, one day last year(not hating on Ferrer) the only mens match that was played in the day session on one particular day was Ferrer's match. In the first few rounds up to the QF you will only see singles on Ashe and Armstrong too unless its the Bryan Brothers playing or Williams sisters. Just look at last year's schedule of plays and try to make the decision yourself. And another poster here said you only need tickets for Ashe.....no....you need tickets for Armstrong too. There are tickets for Armstrong which let you reserve seats in Armstrong and lets you in all the other courts including grandstand and there are tickets for Ashe which let you in all of the courts including Ashe although it only reserves seats for Ashe."

tennis,3da1q6,ZeusDrinksHoneyMilk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:16:51 2015 UTC,Exactly. The best way to go in is via the staircase on the side that's closest to Ashe. It's sort of hidden but there's never a line.
tennis,3da1q6,dropshot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:58 2015 UTC,"They play men's and women's singles every day.  Doubles starts on a later day.  Click on the individual days from last year, and you can see who was playing singles and doubles on each day.  They don't split days for men on one day and women on another.  http://2014.usopen.org/en_US/scores/schedule/schedule7.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Day-by-day_summaries  Typically, the first round takes 3 days, though they may start the second round on Day 3 (I think).  After that, it's 2 days per round (roughly).  Scheduling is typically done each evening, so you won't be able to tell ahead of time (except maybe Day 1) who will play on what day, though they tend to alternate top of the draw and bottom of the draw to give players a day of rest between each round they play (of singles).  If you go to the US Open website, they have chat capabilities and you can also call them up."
tennis,3da1q6,KyleG,0,Tue Jul 14 18:35:20 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that there's two types of times: day and night, and three types of courts: Ashe, Armstrong (wtf is a tennis court named after a jazz musician for???), everything else.  As for men vs. women, there's no way to know until the day of when they post the order of play. Unless you're going in the second week where men and women play different days."

Don't get me wrong I'm all Fed but as long as Nole doesn't get injured I don't think roger is capable of being number 1 again. At the moment there is no threat for Djokovic and as much as it pains me to say that: We have entered the No1e era a long time ago.
tennis,3d749y,Goldavenger,2,Tue Jul 14 09:45:10 2015 UTC,I dont think the main issue is whether Fed will threaten Novak's #1 position. He may just make it impossible for #3 to ever get to #1 for a very long time.

tennis,3d749y,bumbleb333,5,Tue Jul 14 14:05:25 2015 UTC,You're stupid. Federer won 2 masters last year alone. He's also #2 because he has 9665 points.

tennis,3d749y,StockSadness,7,Tue Jul 14 18:20:08 2015 UTC,"This is a classic example of people being unable to see past the short-term.  Djokovic from the US 2015 to July 2016, is defending semis at Shanghai, wins at Beijing, Paris, WTF, Aus Open, Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome, Wimbledon, and Finals at French, Dubai.  That is an INSANE streak. It's better than his 2011 results-wise, because he won nothing after the US Open. It's his best year in terms of points and titles.   It is ridiculous to assume that he can defend all those points for the next year and beyond and then do better to stave off the younger guys and manage the threat of Wawrinka/Nadal/Federer/Murray."
tennis,3d749y,gg_2015,14,Tue Jul 14 09:37:07 2015 UTC,He doesn't have to defend everything. He just needs to do better than everyone else.
tennis,3d749y,boredsole,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:54:38 2015 UTC,"Right now he's roughly 4000pts ahead of #2 Fed, and 6000pts ahead of #3 Murray. He could not win a lot of tourneys and still be way ahead. For example, should he skip a GS, then he'd lose 2000pts in Australia and Wimbledon. But that's not a likely scenario. If he makes the QF or better but doesn't win, he'd lose points, but not as much as if he were to skip altogether.  The other tourneys, I think he'll enter just enough and go deep enough (and by this I mean probably the final round) to keep the points or control how much he'd lose by not winning.  Djokovic is at the peak shape of his tennis career, and the likelihood of him going on a very dry spell of not winning any tourneys is slim to none. He'll win those Masters (perhaps not as much) and at least a slam. Enough about him though. You need to look at what Fed and /or Murray have to do. They'd have to win more events, including a slam. They're the ones that have more to gain, than Novak have to lose."
tennis,3d749y,gg_2015,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:17:54 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, things would have to be bad for him for a few months.

My point was that I don't see how people are extrapolating his dominance for 2 years, let alone 5."
tennis,3d749y,gibisee4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"Oh 1-2 is much believable and possible. No way he can for 5. Fed was the only that was able to maintain #1 for that long 04-08, and even then he didn't have to contend with the likes of Nadal and Djoker at their peak yet.   Of course the argument can also be applied to Djoker, that perhaps now we are in a transition period (Fed/Nadal decline, young pups not quite there yet). But he already has trouble at times with the likes of Wawrinka, and as long as he keeps that to a minimum (I believe he can), then he can definitely dominate for a while. There are little weakness in his game. There's maybe one way to beat him, and that's too overpower him. Hard to do."
tennis,3d749y,gibisee4,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:37:15 2015 UTC,"I am exactly trying to see what the people think about the long-term. As far as I can tell, this can only be done by looking at his opponents and speculating about who could dethrone him."
tennis,3d749y,TacticalTennis,4,Tue Jul 14 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"I think he'll remain number 1 for at least 80 weeks, but I don't think it'll be consecutive. He's looking dominant now, but just like he did in 2012 (after a dominant 2011), I feel he'll fall back and get caught by someone for a few weeks before reclaiming the number 1.  It's interesting that he's already had more weeks ranked number 1 than Nadal. He'd need to remain at the top for another 3 years to get past Federer though, which seems possible, if not likely. If he did that, he'd probably be in the GOAT conversation (I'm assuming that to hold on to his number 1 ranking over the following years, he'll probably win another 4-5 slams)."

tennis,3d749y,avaliantheel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:12:41 2015 UTC,"Because this is tennis, I don't allow myself to look more than a year and a half into the future.  Looking at Novak's track record since 2011, he's won 3 slams, 1 slam, 1 slam, 1 slam, and 2 slams.  I think he'll continue to make finals and win Masters titles but expecting more than one slam next year is hard for me.  Even with that, he should have at least 11000 points which will put him in a strong position to hold number 1.  The only player who I think has a reasonable shot of overtaking him is Murray if he gets back in 2012-2013 form.  If Djokovic has another hangover year which history suggests he will, I think it's reasonable to assume the race will be tighter than it has been this year."

tennis,3d749y,Personacorona,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"Murray was incredibly aggressive  in Wimbledon, he was hitting 130 serves and cracking the short forehand, in a neutral rally he'd absolutely hammer a backhand and then crack the short ball."

tennis,3d749y,JerseyDevil26,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:11:19 2015 UTC,Watch the Olympics semi highlights against Djokovic. That's the Murray under Lendl. He's back to where he was before unfortunately. He never had a problem making finals/SF/QF. The Murray we have now would not win 6-2 in the fifth set against  Djokovic at the US Open.
tennis,3d749y,strike2867,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"If that's the case then he won't this year but he might next year.  Djokovic's slam count over the years has been 2011: 3, 2012: 1, 2013: 1, 2014: 1, 2015: 2.  If we can draw anything from that, it's that he cannot play his very best for more than a year at a time.  He'll still make all the semis/finals but we can reasonably expect him to win only 1 next year.  The rest is unknown."

An although it's good to get insights from retired pros, sometimes it's okay to keep things focused on the present, here and now.  I personally think having both Chris Fowler and Chris McKendry do an excellent job. Especially wrangling in Chrissy Everet and McEnroe at times, but also successfully guiding the key points to talk about."
tennis,3d7fdi,alpacafarts,3,Tue Jul 14 03:14:47 2015 UTC,"Chris Fowler loves sports.  He's a great commentator because he loves sports.  I'm liking ESPN less and less as the days go by for so many reasons.   They don't cover sports nearly as much as they cover celebrity.  Who cares about Marshawn Lynch's video game obsession? When they cover sports, they don't tend to cover them equally.  I think Doubles tennis makes just as good TV, but NOOOOO... let's show only the top 4 singles and Serena and Maria.  I also can't count how many times an American will be playing, and ESPN is showing commentary about a match that's already been played instead.  And they do this for a tremendous amount of other sports too. Showing too many ""non-sports"".  Surely there is something more worthwhile than showing the Cornhole National Championship.  I'm actually a fan of when they'll show things like lacrosse or even something like the Ultimate Frisbee Worlds or whatever.  But come on... Cornhole? Steven A. Smith and Skip Bayless.  I don't think anything else needs to be said here.   A lot of other reasons as well.  Chris Fowler, on the other hand, tends to be a shining spot in the darkness that is ESPN, though.  And really, all in all, each of the commentators for tennis do a great job.  The ex-pros and the all around sports guys all do a great job of being them and bringing legitimacy to the sport.  I just wish ESPN did more sports than commentary on sports."

But after some time I started to notice he has a very almost passive aggressive way of negatively commenting about certain players. He puts a subtle spin on the things he says and I can't tell if it's because he doesn't like some players or he's trying to perhaps compensate for players he does like.   I also realized pretty quickly he really has no idea what he's talking about and his attempts to contribute to the tennis discussion are in the most basic ways with very superficial observations. He also has the audacity to argue and defend his usually wrong points with the pro's he's working with. He'll make a comment that is just completely false (say about the humidity positively benefiting one player over another) and then when corrected by Cahill or a McEnroe, won't admit fault but instead try to keep arguing his unjustified point.   In other words, now I find him infuriating and will do almost anything to not listen to him commentate."

I do see posts like this, and perhaps many people (including myself) do like Chris Fowler, but consensus typically means general agreement and could even mean unanimous agreement.  But it's possible to say ""What's the consensus on Nick Kyrgios?"" and not come to a general agreement because he's so divisive (some people like him, some people don't).  A better question is ""What's your opinion of Chris Fowler?"".  I do think he's one of the busiest guys ever esp. right before the Australian Open.  He's often completing his college football duties which are at a peak right after the new year, then jetting down to Australia to broadcast, and yes, I also think he likes to make fun of some of the broadcasters, most notably, Brad Gilbert, but they've certainly been giving him big roles (he was on the main broadcast team for men and women's finals)."

Nobody else got even close to 8 slam finals apart from the big 4.
tennis,3d5qmh,Xercen,2,Tue Jul 14 01:55:04 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, since he only has 2 Slam wins compared to the other guys, you could call it a Big 3.5. Because that's really what it's been. Murray isn't in the same group as the Top 3, but he's decidedly been ahead of the rest of the field."

There was a Big 2 era until 2011. Since then Djokovic has been clearly the best, Nadal has been second and a few people have been good depending on the year.   That's because there is more to tennis than simply winning slams.  Consistency is important also.  Murray's stats:   2 slams 8 slam finals 17 slam semis 10 Masters 1000 titles 14 Masters 1000 finals Olympic gold medalist 34 ATP career titles 50 ATP career finals   Murray once made eight slam semis in a 9 slam span.  Yes, he has not been the champion any of the others have been, by any stretch of the imagination, but as soon as you move outside of slam count alone, he has numbers which are certainly notable.  Murray has played in 17 slam semis, where Nadal has played in 23.  When you consider that Nadal has played for two more years in the slams, that's similar territory.  It's true that the narrative was a little forced pre-2011, but since then, Murray's numbers are right up there with Nadal and Federer.  2012 and onwards:  Slam titles:   5 - Djokovic 4 - Nadal 2 - Murray 1 - Federer   Slam finals:   11 - Djokovic 6 - Nadal 5 - Murray 3 - Federer   Slam semis:   14 - Djokovic 9 - Murray 8 - Federer 6 - Nadal   ATP 1000 titles:   13 - Djokovic 8 - Nadal 4 - Federer 2 - Murray   ATP 1000 finals:   17 - Djokovic 12 - Nadal 10 - Federer 5 - Murray   The only areas in which Murray has lacked during this latter span has been ATP 1000 tournaments, where his title count is poor and he is way off in number of finals."

It isn't about if someone can join this group, if someone wanted to join this group they should have done it during this period where Nadal, Djokovic, and Federer were dominant(which Murray did). During this period these 4 players consistently filled out the semis for all the big tournaments. I don't see Wawrinka doing that, sure he challenges all the big players but he doesn't have the consistency of Murray or the consistency in general to be touted as a ""big 4"". To an extent the big 4 still exists but Nadal is dropping out. If he makes a resurgence then I guess the era is still alive but its not like anyone can fill his hole in the big 4 or someone could be added to this group."

tennis,3d5qmh,Personacorona,0,Tue Jul 14 13:06:33 2015 UTC,"Every year one of the members is ass. This year it is no different with Rafa. But what is different is the fact that the Big 4 lost its consistency. In the golden years of the big 4 (2009-2012) all 4 were obviously very consistent. In 2013 Federer dropped but the other 3 went on, in 2014 Murray dropped but the other 3 went on, this year Nadal dropped but the other 3 aren't going on as strong. Murray isn't winning any of the big tournaments anymore. Federer still makes it to many finals but lacks the consistency expected of the big 4. When you think of contenders for titles usually it is ""the big 4"". Not any single one of them(except Nadal for Roland Garros) but the 4 of them as a whole. Now its just Djokovic by far, Murray and Federer have a chance although it is slim, and Nadal might or might not comeback. Then you have Wawrinka(no he is not a member of this group and never will be)on the side who can pull an upset and any of the other players(even Cilic!) who may have a chance although this is even slimmer than Murray or Federer's chances. If the Big 4 were still ""alive"" then I would be saying; ""there is no way anyone else can win a big title or even get to the final and once we get to the finals it is 99% likely we'll see another matchup between 2 of the Big 4."""
tennis,3d5qmh,PokeMyPillow,2,Tue Jul 14 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"You cannot say that because Djokovic is winning everything that the others aren't going on as strong. 3 of the Big 4 were present in the Wimbledon semis. 2 of the 3 slam finals have been 2 of the Big 4. The Big 4 have split all the masters. In only 3 of the tournaments with at least 2 Big 4 members entering, 2 of them have not made the final(Doha, MC, FO). So far, the only time that a member of the Big 4 has failed to win a tournament when they were in the finals is the French Open. And Wawrinka was untouchable that tournament. If he plays like that for an entire year he would win all the slams easily. I agree, Wawrinka is not part of the Big 4. But this year, he is one of the top 4 guys leading the tour. Ever since 2014 Wawrinka has played incredibly in some tournaments. Just because he has the game to beat anybody on any day, and he's living up to his potential, it does not mean that the Big 4 are not consistent. The truth of the matter is you're not giving enough credit to Stan when he deserves it. He is playing so much better than he was during the time when the Big 4 dominated, and because of that, you see him winning tournaments and think the Big 4 are fading. That is not the case. And Djokovic is playing unbelievably. The same thing happened in 2011. It took a superhuman effort to beat Djo in the FO then, and it took a superhuman effort now. In 2011 at this point in the year, Djok had won: AO, Dubai, Belgrade, IW, Miami, Madrid, Rome, Wimbledon. This year: AO, IW, Miami, MC, Rome, Wimbledon. The only time he failed to win a tournament he entered in both years(he did not play MC in 2011 and did not play Madrid and Belgrade this year) is Dubai, when he lost to Federer. So this year we have a similar domination of the tour, and he is in similar form. But this does not mean that the others are terrible. Yes, Nadal is bad this year. But we have Stan to take his place, and he has delivered.    Murray isn't winning any of the big tournaments anymore   He won Madrid and Queens, and he made the finals of the AO and Miami. Both of those times he played Djokovic, and in the form he's in right now nobody can touch him. Murray has made the semis of pretty much every big tournament he's played in, the only exception being Rome, when he withdrew from fatigue.    Federer still makes it to many finals but lacks the consistency expected of the big 4.    Aside from some bad losses, Federer's been pretty solid. He has had only two bad losses this year, the one against Seppi in AO and against Monfils in MC. The Kyrgios match was incredibly close, not really a bad loss. And he lost to Wawrinka in FO, but then again, so did everybody. Besides those, he makes it to finals, and has won 4 of the 7 he's contested this year. Admittedly, most of the tournaments he's won haven't been huge, but he did beat Djokovic in Dubai and Raonic in Brisbane. And he's won a tournament on every surface for the first year since 2012.   My point is: Yes, Djokovic is sweeping everything. But the other members of the Big 4 aren't exactly shitting the bed. If Djokovic wasn't at the level he was this year, the tournament split would be a lot more even. But Djokovic is at a level that's almost impossible to reach. Yes, Nadal is fading. But Wawrinka is playing the best tennis of his life, and now he has the belief he can beat the big boys. Murray is playing some of the best tennis of his life as well. Out of the 11 tournaments he's played in, he's reached the semis in 8. He just lacks the belief that he can beat Djokovic, but then again, who can? And Federer has had a slightly less consistent season, but it's a pretty good one nontheless. Out of the 11 tournaments he's played in, he's made the finals of 7 and won 4. The 3 finals he's lost? All to Djokovic, 2 of them on slow surfaces. To sum up: Djokovic is on another planet right now, Murray and Fed are still right there, and while Nadal is fading, Stan has taken his place(for this year only, obviously not in history). This is the field we have right now, and it's a pretty good one."

These guys are never going to say they don't expect to win. Just because some of them don't offer as much praise to their opponents doesn't mean they are assholes. Federer expects to win, but acknowledges that it was going to be very tough to beat Novak, what more do you want? I feel like everyone is drawing too many conclusions based on an interview that happens immediately after a tough loss.

tennis,3d5s2i,boomskats,9,Tue Jul 14 00:03:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but this is a press conference. To me, the trophy ceremony interview is the time to be a gracious loser who says pleasantries and nothing more. But in a press conference, you're talking to the media, and as a tennis fan I want facts, not niceties.  Roger's reflections in pressers are always great because he's blunt. If he did well, he tells you. If he didn't, he tells you where he fucked up. He doesn't just go ""oh the other guy outplayed me"" because no fucking shit, if you lost the other guy by definition outplayed you.  Nadal's pressers are exactly the same, except maybe a little less enjoyable because he engages in slightly more puffery bullshit talking about how great his opponent was. I don't want that. Give me facts that aren't self-evident that a preschooler could make the same observations. I actually learn stuff by watching these guys be blunt in press conference interviews.  Personally, I really don't want a lot of yeah um i just wanna thank God, and congratulate my opponent, really incredible player blahblah. Tell me what you did wrong and what you did right and what you will do going forward. Tell me your mindset. This is what Roger tells us."
tennis,3d5s2i,KyleG,5,Tue Jul 14 06:02:12 2015 UTC,"Well, he did just lose in a major final, so being nervous would be understandable. Irritated, even.  shrugs Seems to me he is just answering the questions being asked. Most of the time reporters want to know what the players think about themselves. Even when he says, ""I won't accept losing as being normal,"" just seems like the right response."
tennis,3d5s2i,Rac3318,-4,Mon Jul 13 23:53:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know, guess it could be that. He just seems almost kind of afraid too."

I don't find that arrogant. People overblow this arrogance/not kind of thing. They're athletes of the highest level, who've worked hard to get there. If they don't get irritated when they lose then they don't belong. Fed has always been gracious and proceed with class. I'd hate for him to talk too much about other players, since I only care about him and his game."

Djokovic is obviously a nicer guy and more humble off court than Jose is.
tennis,3d4j42,yoman91,3,Mon Jul 13 18:21:39 2015 UTC,I don't know I'd venture to say Andy Murray is more Mourinho considering how much he parks the bus against top opponents..... Djokovic is more attacking against the top guys.   Maybe Djokovic is more tikitaki football. It's not as fun as a good counter attacking side that uses pace. It's all very calculated and meticulous until it smothers and suffocates you into mistakes.

And because of their bias, they only see his ugly side, whilst conveniently glazing over their own favourites less-than-humble moments.    I feel sorry for Djokovic, he really can't do anything right. If he wins, he is an ""emotionless machine, not human"".

And he's not gotten a fair shake from the crowds at Wimbledon, no doubt. He's unlucky to have come along at the tail end of the careers of two of the most beloved players in the history of the sport.

That said, I find the GOAT concept to be dubious, as it's partly out of a player's hands--life circumstances from injuries to family issues are a huge factor--and I'm not totally interested in who showed up for work every day and dominated for the longest time. I'm more interested in how it was done and at what intensity and in what context, with longevity being an important but secondary factor.

Doing so does not detract from Roger's or Rafa's monumental achievements."
tennis,3d5b9t,tonderstiche,-5,Tue Jul 14 05:12:41 2015 UTC,He's a great guy but I don't find his tennis inspiring. Like he's come so far from his days of being a goof and he's likeable when he isn't playing tennis but I just can't root for someone who doesn't take a lot of risks on the court.

If you were to determine the best tennis player, shouldnt the major factor be your success against other good players? After all winning tournaments says as much about you as it says about the quality of your opponents, there are always two sides of a match. So to me it seems weeks at #1 and slam count says more about your ability to hold a certain level"
tennis,3d5b9t,ass_t0_ass,7,Tue Jul 14 12:38:30 2015 UTC,A calender slam or 4 in a row will do it for me even if he falls short of both nadal or federers slam count
tennis,3d5b9t,mims7099,6,Mon Jul 13 23:13:51 2015 UTC,Get to 13+ Slams.  Overtake Nadal's Masters record.  Win Cincinnati Masters to complete the Masters Set.  Reach 200+ weeks at number 1.  Complete Career Slam by winning Roland Garros.  Achieve a winning head-to-head record vs Federer and Rafa.   Win Olympic Gold (not necessary).
tennis,3d5b9t,thesmallscreen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:21:06 2015 UTC,"Outside of the last one, I'm fairly confident he will get all of those. Maybe not the h2h vs rafa if he isn't able to compete at a high level anymore."
tennis,3d5b9t,thesmallscreen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"I think he may achieve this, but not anymore... this is more like a best case scenario. If he does tick off these boxes he will go above Nadal in the debate IMO but not Federer."
tennis,3d5b9t,PoopOnGod,17,Tue Jul 14 17:03:35 2015 UTC,Win 8 more slams. Which is improbable but not impossible.
tennis,3d5b9t,moosh247,12,Mon Jul 13 17:29:37 2015 UTC,"Improbable to win 8 more slams?  You don't think it's actually quite possible that he can average 2 per year over the next 4 years??  I'd actually be shocked if he didn't pull it off considering the upcoming vacuum he'll be soon taking advantage of 35+ year old Federer, declining Nadal, Murray being Murray, and Stan is already pushing 30).  Federer had a similar vacuum on his ascent to greatness, where he had no one close to his level for his first 10 slams (Roddick, Hewitt, Philippoussis, Hewitt, Gonzalez, Safin, Baghdatis).  He beat Roddick 4x alone in slam finals.  Anyway, it's very likely he challenges and/or surpasses 17 (from my analysis anyway)."
tennis,3d5b9t,Parmizan,8,Mon Jul 13 22:31:36 2015 UTC,"It's certainly possible that he could do it, but I don't think it's by any means a guarantee. Djokovic is a player with a lot of stamina, and if his physical game starts to go, then he could begin to struggle a bit more.  At 28, he's far from old and will still undoubtedly win more majors, but very few players continue to dominate once they've hit 30. Of course, weak competition could make Djokovic the exception, but there's every possibility that a new dominant force could soon emerge over the next three of four years.  Again, it's not impossible, but I'd be surprised if Djokovic manages to beat Federer's record. It's unlikely he's going to be winning two or three GS's every year, and his game could easily start to deteriorate in a year or two. I'd say Nadal is a much more realistic target for him."
tennis,3d5b9t,PoopOnGod,13,Mon Jul 13 23:12:59 2015 UTC,"Novak has only won more than one slam in a year twice: 2015 and 2011. It took him 8 years to win 9 slams, and that's in the prime of his athletic life. As he gets older and inevitably start to decline in health and/or motivation, it's only going to get harder. For Novak to win 8 slams in the next 4 years, as you suggest, is wildly unlikely."
tennis,3d5b9t,SafinisGOAT,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:25:26 2015 UTC,"I agree..only if that vacuum persists. say something crazy happened, like Nadal not letting uncle Toni ruin the rest of his tennis career? I think the supercoach thing is real and he has yet to take advantage of it. But you are still right hard to find enough guys to fight Djok on all 4 opens. Nishikori can maybe take him 1/4 times. Maybe if Kygrios grew up a little? Grigor drops his ladyfriend? etc. If nothing changes then yea he'll get his 8."
tennis,3d5b9t,jiratic,9,Tue Jul 14 01:27:22 2015 UTC,Slams are not the sole measure of greatness. Slams became the overwhelming narrative after the US media played it up as Sampras was nearing the record in the 90's.
tennis,3d5b9t,SafinisGOAT,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:51:15 2015 UTC,"well that's an interesting statement as ""greatness"" itself is subjective and defined by the person. i agree greatness in our day and age is really defined by accomplishments as those are objective because 10 years down the road he will be lumped together with all the other 9 slam champions of the past, but only one won 17. Honestly, you are going to have to help me out here how else people are going to categorize their athletes and heroes as great without something romanticized as a grand slam. Olympic athletes are all great athletes but they will never be immortalized unless they win a ton of medals or set a world record."
tennis,3d5b9t,Thooorin_2,2,Tue Jul 14 22:36:40 2015 UTC,"how else people are going to categorize their athletes and heroes as great without something romanticized as a grand slam   There is a massive consensus that Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of all time, yet he won six NBA titles, contrasted against Bill Russell's 11."
tennis,3d5b9t,moosh247,0,Wed Jul 15 18:33:25 2015 UTC,"Sure...and Novak has a Davis Cup under his belt, as well as the most (or close to) Masters 1000 titles.  And can threaten Roger's record for consecutive years at #1.  And can still win gold in the upcoming games in Rio.  And will likely win in France (Stan played at a miracle winner to beat him...can't play like that again.  It was a once in a lifetime performance).  Agreed - slams not the sole measure, and Djoker will have more than enough accolades to support his case."
tennis,3d5b9t,dannhash,3,Tue Jul 14 16:15:44 2015 UTC,Already top 3 in my opinion and can climb to number 2 if he gets a lot of weeks at number 1 and at least 12 to 13 slams and the career slam.....but don't think he can be the GOAT unless he surpasses or equals Federer in slam count and weeks at number 1 and number of titles.....even then Federer has so many records that can't possibly be matched by djokovic but at least he'll have a strong case
tennis,3d5b9t,frattynuts,3,Mon Jul 13 21:29:44 2015 UTC,If he holds #1 for another year or so he'll definitely be among the contenders.

tennis,3d5b9t,dropshot,10,Mon Jul 13 18:27:35 2015 UTC,i dont think he would need 17 slams to enter the debate. If he catches Sampras/Nadal he will have a case.
tennis,3d5b9t,Lemurians,3,Mon Jul 13 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's useful to point out who you think are GOAT candidates.  Tennis fans generally like to pick players they've seen, so depending on the era, they may not even choose a player that played prior to 1990 (thus, excluding Rod Laver, Don Budge, etc) possibly excluding Borg (though Borg mostly skipped the Australian Open).  It also helps to give criteria by which to judge a GOAT.  Clearly, some posters are looking at quality of competition, or even, how would one player's best do against another player's best.  Without criteria, you're comparing apples and oranges."
tennis,3d5b9t,tonderstiche,4,Mon Jul 13 20:36:57 2015 UTC,Take a lot of Roger's records.
tennis,3d5b9t,lucky_ooo,4,Mon Jul 13 20:36:00 2015 UTC,"He's ahead in M1000s, and going ahead at weeks at #1 is possible, so I think with those two he has it, even if he doesn't exceed Roger in GS counts."
tennis,3d5b9t,Lemurians,2,Tue Jul 14 02:18:30 2015 UTC,What about 1000 career wins Roger is already 2nd will most likely overtake Lendl for 2nd place. Also Djokovic is still nearly 150 weeks behind Federer That's 3 years more at #1 As great as Djokovic is Playing I don't think He'll get those many weeks
tennis,3d5b9t,gccmelb,0,Wed Jul 15 11:37:01 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be enough for me. Roger's just got so much more history and unprecedented records on his side that I wouldn't give it to Djoko just for besting him with Masters and weeks at #1 (which Djoko would almost need to double his current amount to achieve).   I do think Djoko will beat Fed's record of straight QFs in a major though.
tennis,3d5b9t,reredef,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:44:38 2015 UTC,"Hard to judge GOAT with so many different era's. First he needs to complete a career slam. Ideally a calender grand slam. This probably would be a clincher, Rod Laver did it twice but he gets forgotten all too often. Federer (back) and Nadal (knee) have had injuries lately, so do we factor that in? Do we base GOAT on pure skill and talent, number and quality of tournaments won or players beaten? All to hard to say i reckon."

tennis,3d5b9t,nista002,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:16:44 2015 UTC,"Who knows what could happen to Djokovic in the next few years. First he has to win Roland Garros to get that career slam or there is just no way he could be eligible for GOAT debate. If he doesn't get Roland Garros then he'll need at least 18 slams to justify the lack of a career slam. He certainly has enough of everything else already so for now its all about the slams for him. If he can get 14 slams and the career slam then I'd say he would be a slight step over Rafa with the extra weeks at #1 and WTF titles. But who knows if he can pick up those extra 5 slams and a Roland Garros title. Unless he wins this years US Open and all 4 slams next year I'd say his time is somewhat running out. Rafa had an amazing 2013 but declined sharply in 2014. Maybe something will hit Djokovic too. We even saw Anderson pull him to 5 sets this past week.   If you consider Federer the GOAT right now then I'd say that Djokovic has no chance to become the GOAT. But he certainly can catch up to Rafa although I'd say thats unlikely despite his recent form. He'd have to win a lot, stop choking at Roland Garros, and maintain this dominance for another 1.5-2 years to even catch up to Rafa."
tennis,3d5b9t,PokeMyPillow,3,Tue Jul 14 01:17:03 2015 UTC,"He'd only be a slight step over Rafa with the same number of slams, but many more weeks at #1 and 4+ WTF titles? He'd be a considerable leap over Rafa with those stats IMO."

tennis,3d9mkz,Mdizzle29,22,Tue Jul 14 16:05:35 2015 UTC,weird. the only shaming I saw in that article was in the quotes from players themselves - don't blame the messenger?
tennis,3d9mkz,shittylob,2,Tue Jul 14 16:09:57 2015 UTC,"Yes but this article publishes all of those quotes and never really challenges the idea that a ""tennis body"" and a ""feminine body"" are two separate things. If the first half of the article was quotes from the players and the second half was an editorial about how ridiculous it is to label strong female athletes as ""manly"" then I don't think anyone would be complaining. Instead, they basically just put together a bunch of quotes from the athletes that reinforce the aforementioned idea."
tennis,3d9mkz,drodin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"No, the article doesn't champion any particular ideal, but I also don't see how this is shaming Serena Williams: ""Not all players have achieved Williams’s self-acceptance.""  The article is basically just a collection of quotes for the purpose of shit-stirring.  There's no shaming.  As Rothenburg said in that followup: ""“I wanted it to be a conversation starter"""
tennis,3d9mkz,shittylob,3,Tue Jul 14 22:49:57 2015 UTC,"I think a conversation starter would be great and that would have been the purpose of a critical follow-up within the article.

I'll also say that I think the author was misguided but clearly didn't write the article maliciously."
tennis,3d9mkz,drodin,0,Wed Jul 15 01:41:25 2015 UTC,Its the selection of quotes that were chosen to be published that implies some kind of bias in the article.

tennis,3d9mkz,shittylob,-8,Tue Jul 14 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"To me, there’s something very wrong to me about asking a bunch of white women, who play in a predominantly white sport, to weigh in on the way a black woman’s body looks. There are unacknowledged racial undertones to that query. Add that to the fact that Serena's been mocked her whole career about every part of her body, its really, really wrong and uncalled for by the Times.   There are plenty of ""larger"" women who have played the sport throughout its history. Arguably, Samanta Stosur is even more ripped. But NONE have had Serena's success.   I think Serena's mental toughness is so underrated. Its why she wins as much as she does."
tennis,3d9mkz,pfc_bgd,12,Tue Jul 14 16:43:59 2015 UTC,"what? Most of these white women just talked about themselves, I don't see any comments from them about Serena other than Pam Shriver who complimented Serena. So what in the world are you talking about?   This article is just as much about Andrea Petkovic as it is about Serena...And sure, let's not hide it, it's probably Serena's body that was a motivation for this article, but the article nicely talks about much more than just Serena- body issues of a lot of female athletes and how they deal with it."
tennis,3d9mkz,UNICY,6,Tue Jul 14 17:12:51 2015 UTC,"I must have missed the part where the other tennis players weighed in on Serena's bodies. It seemed like they were talking about their own.

tennis,3d9mkz,flat_tamales,5,Tue Jul 14 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you, the whole point of the article seemed off to me, especially with the author pointing towards the differences in body as what separates Serena from the tour. Lisicki, Stosur, Keys, Sharapova, Kvitova, etc all hit harder or as hard as Serena, yet it goes unnoticed that Serena uses more angles and is smarter than them. But nope, it's just her ""natural athleticism"" that wins.  Then on the flip side, it's trying to paint all the other women as too dumb to bulk up. Aga needs her speed, plus I envy the fact that with how little weight she has, she probably doesn't menstruate. Then sharapova has had shoulder injuries that nearly ended her career, of course she'll be careful with weights. And with her height, she has to stay light. Wozniacki and Bouchard both said they'll bulk up if needed since they're tennis players first, so I don't think their comments were that controversial"
tennis,3d9mkz,drodin,2,Tue Jul 14 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"the author pointing towards the differences in body as what separates Serena from the tour   You can acknowledge that Serena wins because of her technical ability and, at the same time, point out that she has physically developed her body much more than many other top players. I can see why you would connect the two because it is often incorrectly stated that Serena wins ONLY because of her physicality but I don't think that's what the author is trying to say here."
tennis,3d9mkz,TenNes,2,Tue Jul 14 17:42:15 2015 UTC,"Her physicality is one of the things that allows to to play more tactical styles as well.

There are plenty of athletes who are fit and don't or can't compete professionally.  But how many pro athletes who are not fit for their sport?  This lazy article reads like it is about Serena and her body type.

To be honest though it's really just a selection of quotes and I think the aim is for the reader to draw their own conclusions.

I want to say andy is coming up to challenging him but for andy its a mental game now. Andy has always been his own worst enemy. Federer just lacking a little bit too, at 33 its hats off for still being here but i die a little inside every time he loses a gs final, I actually cant wait until he retires so i can watch tennis without being emotionally drained and ageing 10 years in the space of an afternoon. Federer has like a 10% chance when in a rally with novak these days thats over 3 shots.  I feel raonic has the least talent out of the next batch of candidates. Nishikori just has the smallest tank and dimitrov seems like he needs to do a mcilroy and get rid of sharapova cos hes just going backwards.   I feel like djokovic can put together a better season than Feds did in 06 but thats hard to imagine especially back then finals of most tourneys were best of 5 sets and novaks 2011 unbeaten campaign trailed off at the end of the season."

tennis,3d4knw,btaz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"agree to disagree. i was ready to pack my bags and support someone like delpotro when federer retires. tell me this doesnt break your heart. I am a guy and that just eats me alive and makes me want to cry.  If he retired tomorrow, i would be in limbo because i dont ahve a favourite and probably would not watch tennis for a while until someone new caught my eye. I feel tennis fan numbers would drop significantly when he retires"
tennis,3d4knw,trowawayatwork,3,Tue Jul 14 08:02:01 2015 UTC,"That season was insane. He can't lose more than 2 matches, has to win the US, and 5 other titles. He's going to be playing 7 tournaments up to and including the WTF.   It's possible with the weak field but a tough ask nevertheless."
tennis,3d4knw,boredsole,4,Mon Jul 13 15:56:40 2015 UTC,"He'd have to win 44 matches and only lose 2. I'm not sure it's possible, and for sure it's damn near impossible to pull off. And the field is not weak. So it's very unlikely."
tennis,3d4knw,Personacorona,4,Mon Jul 13 17:22:25 2015 UTC,"Here's why I think the field is weak:   Fed is able to be no. 2 by winning only 2 masters, 3 500's, and 2 250's in the 3 years. He's 1500 pts ahead of Murray.   What are the rest of the guys doing? No one is consistent enough to challenge Novak."
tennis,3d4knw,boredsole,4,Mon Jul 13 18:58:11 2015 UTC,"No, Fed is #2 because he has amassed 9665 points. That's good enough to be #2 in any era. At the end of 2012,  Federer, #2 had 10265 points. He was 2000 points ahead of Murray. And that's at the end of the year.   Source"
tennis,3d4knw,Personacorona,3,Mon Jul 13 19:06:26 2015 UTC,"This is a strong field. He's playing peak Federer, Murray back to his best. Sure, Nadal isn't playing his best, but Djokovic would be beating him anyway, no doubt.   Berdych, Nishikori, and Cilic...Raonic...there's so much depth and challenge."
tennis,3d4knw,CanasVolandri07,3,Mon Jul 13 19:27:57 2015 UTC,novak truly beat roger but the errors and weak forehands in the 3rd and 4th set are not peak federer by any distance. his age shows him losing half a step when he continuously was not able ot cover his forehand in last sundays final. I dont know if peak federer would ahve beaten novak but peak federer would have given a greater challenge

tennis,3d4knw,Personacorona,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:25:48 2015 UTC,So far he's lost 1 less match but Federer only lost one match after RG. It's hard to see Djok going anywhere near that.
tennis,3d4knw,Personacorona,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:24:43 2015 UTC,Not really.
tennis,3d4knw,btaz,10,Tue Jul 14 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"As a neutral, I thought Murray could have done a bit more in the rallies. There were too many short balls from him and his superior retrieving skills could only keep up so much. While Fed was playing too good, I feel that if Murray was more aggressive and won a few more rallies, it would have put some pressure on Fed's game. It would have made the match a lot more closer.   You can actually see this in the first set in the finals. Fed was clearly the better player. But Djokovic did an extremely good job of winning rallies on his serve. And the one moment where Federer had a dip, he broke his serve to get level. And as the match went on Fed was not able to get really comfortable even when he was playing well.   People say that Murray was hitting short balls because Fed was not allowing him to get into a rhythm. But apparently having Novak on the other side has no bearing on Fed's unforced error count or the dip in his serving level according to the same people. Novak did what Andy was probably trying to do - draw out the points, defend his serve and make Roger do the extra work. And it showed - Roger was going for that extra pace and made some quite uncharacteristic errors. Time and again Nadal has shown that the most efficient way to beat Roger is to make him play that one more ball and get him to make mistakes. It's ugly but you are not there to please Fed's fans who think that the opponent exists so that Federer has someone to whack. Beat Federer and walk into the history books - how you do it need not matter as long as it is fair.  EDIT: Regarding the questions    I personally think Nadal's 2015 is over. It is all a matter of him getting his confidence back.  Murray can beat Djokovic. It is mostly in the head. He also needs to be more aggressive and use his forehand - it is incredible why he prefers to keep that forehand in the box unless he really needs it. Just start using it more.  About Kei and Raonic - I am doubtful if they will recover from their injuries quickly. Nadal changed our expectations of what levels players can be post injury when he came back from 2013. The reality is more like it happened with Murray. It takes a while for many to hit 100% or get close to it.  Dmitrov needs a coach who can teach him tactics. Roger Rasheed did an excellent job of raising his fitness levels and physical movement. He needs to learn how to build a game plan, stick to it and change it when necessary."
tennis,3d4knw,trowawayatwork,2,Mon Jul 13 15:20:24 2015 UTC,"yeah every ball from novak in the 3rd and 4th set was hitting the baseline, it made it look like federer was playing hungover or something. that in turn knocked his confidence and his 1st serve went missing."

tennis,3db3y6,Paragon_Flux,-1,Thu Jul 16 00:36:31 2015 UTC,"Nah. As boring as I find Djokovic to watch, he saved Federer's legacy. Without him, Nadal has at least 17 Grand Slams now and at least one more year end #1.  And the Federer/Nadal rivalry wasn't much of a rivalry given that Nadal basically won all the matches. Even on those occasions where Federer got him at Wimbledon, it didn't feel like a true victory for some reason. Like, Federer was supposed to be more dominant than he was against him on grass, and he couldn't make up for the clay match backhand abuse.   What pisses me off is prime Federer never got a crack at Nadal in Halle, Basel, and Cincinnati. The one time they met in Cincinnati, Federer was coming off major back problems that had shattered his confidence."

tennis,3d4uy3,ViolentWanderer,5,Tue Jul 14 12:20:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I contend that Djokovic at his best is better than Nadal but the slam count may not show it when all is said and done. And quite clearly, Djokovic has been better than federer for 3 or 4 years now. If Djokovic just had 2 or 3 more finals wins rather than losses, I don't think people would question him so much."
tennis,3d4uy3,ChaoticMidget,2,Mon Jul 13 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"I can't agree that anyone in history is better than Nadal at his best on clay. Like 2008 French Open Nadal never even came close to losing a SET over the course of all 7 matches. Fed has won Slams without dropping a set, but not at that level of dominance. Borg has an argument for similar dominance on clay in the 1978 FO, but the players Nadal swept aside en route to the title were much better players. Nobody has made Federer or Djokovic that helpless before or since."
tennis,3d4uy3,Ersatz_Okapi,2,Tue Jul 14 01:02:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone disputes Nadal will probably be the best clay court player ever. But he has had some significant weaknesses (be it injuries or other issues) that lets Djokovic contend against him even with less slams. For example, after getting to the finals of Wimbledon 5 times in a row when he was competing, he hasn't even gotten to the QF since then, even while winning other majors or getting to other finals. Obviously, someone can't really be weak on grass when they win 2 and get to 3 other finals but it certainly is perplexing why Wimbledon is suddenly a place where he can't seem to compete. Meanwhile, Djokovic has gotten to at least the semis in 20 of the last 21 majors, including 3 finals at the French where he hasn't won yet. In fact, he's been in the finals of 15 of the last 21 majors. Maybe Djokovic will see a downturn on a specific court at some point but it certainly doens't look like it at the moment."
tennis,3d4uy3,ChaoticMidget,2,Tue Jul 14 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"Right, I don't dispute the points you're making. I'm talking only about the greatest level of tennis ever displayed in keeping with this comment chain. In that vein, I think Federer at his best on grass is worse than Nadal at his best on clay.   Overall, even though I'm a Nadal fan, Federer is the greater player ever, and Fed's average level is better than Nadal's average. I thinkNadal's best form is the peak of tennis."
tennis,3d4uy3,Ersatz_Okapi,2,Tue Jul 14 02:37:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is the peak of tennis period. I agree 100% with what you said about peak Nadal on clay being the most insurmountable opponent in history, but I do not think that that necessarily makes it the highest level of tennis. It is the greatest disparity perhaps, but not the highest overall level (if that makes sense to you). So it's not that Nadal is at a higher level on clay than anyone else is on any other surface, it's that the next best player is so much worse on clay than Nadal.   So like, Federer at his best on grass isn't necessarily as dominant as Nadal on clay, but that also has to do with the next best grass court player's peak being better than the next best clay court player's peak. Nadal would be like a 10, and the next best player an 8, while Federer would be a 10 to the next best player's 9.   Basically what I am trying to say is that I agree that beating Nadal at his best on clay is the hardest task one can give a tennis player. I believe that Federer at his best (on any surface other than clay lol) plays tennis at the highest level. With Claydal, you are just putting yourself in this war of attrition that you have no way of winning (for numerous reasons). But at least you know what you are getting yourself into.   Ugh...I'm so inarticulate. Sorry lol."

tennis,3d4uy3,TareXmd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:10:29 2015 UTC,Agree with some of the other comments. Great achievement no doubt but he's catching Federer during his steady decline. He's also 5 years younger than Roger.   Djoko vs Nadal is more of a fair comparison because of their age. Nadal's been injured way too often. It would be great to see them meet more in Grand Slams.
tennis,3d4uy3,kuyakew,0,Mon Jul 13 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"His peak years have come during Federer's decline, and what is really post-prime Nadal. He should have a good record against them both."
tennis,3d4uy3,TacticalTennis,2,Mon Jul 13 19:15:15 2015 UTC,But his beginning came during Fed's prime so it balances out which is why the h2h is equal. When Novak entered the top 3 in 2007 and Fed was still playing really well they have been even. If you look at the h2h match by match this trend is shown. I'm pretty sure since entering the top 3 that neither player has won more than 3 in a row against the other. Where as Djokovic took 7 in a row on Nadal.

tennis,3d2k13,Occitzer,-3,Mon Jul 13 06:39:23 2015 UTC,"Well, after Roger switched his racquet he based his game on the serve and that became his main weapon actually. Problem with Novak is that he returns very well so this new strategy won't work on him as we saw last year at Wimbledon and yesterday. What's sad? That it works on the rest of the tour pretty comfortably and Roger is still at 2nd place in the ranking, beating 3rd guy with a smile on his face.  His serve became his only weapon to get points, but when you play against Djokovic, you have to play rallies, because of his return and solid baseline game. And that is the reason why Roger is loosing to Novak. Roger's forehand decelined so much, that he cannot dominate rallies with it like he used to do (for example: USO 07-09, RG 2011, Wimbledon 2012, Cincinnati 2012) and nowadays he enters into medium-pace rallies with Novak and nobody can beat Novak in such rallies, because he is, I like to say, ""a pushing master"".    Wawrinka has shown us in Paris how to play Djokovic. Dominate him in rallies, hammer the ball - Djoko under big pressure tends to fall to pieces like a house of cards. Nadal has also shown us this many times at RG and in 2013 on hardcourts dominating him with his forehand. Federer has no firepower from baseline anymore, thats the only reason."
tennis,3d2k13,Denek,6,Mon Jul 13 03:55:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, Federer has beaten Djokovic with the new racket. It does work, just maybe not in a Best of 5."
tennis,3d2k13,Personacorona,2,Mon Jul 13 04:10:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he has, but where was it? Dubai twice, Monte Carlo (Novak had wrist problems) and in Shanghai, where Roger actually played a perfect match, but still ATP500 and Masters1000 is a diffrent story than a grandslam. It is definitely easier for RF to peak in such tournaments (best of 3) and Novak wasnt at his best in those matches.  I watched highlights of their SF at Wimbledon 2012 and RF wasnt serving as big as he is today, but he was able to dominate rallies with his forehand and that shot has won him this and many more tournaments. He needs his forehand if he want to win another grandslam, especially when Novak is on the other side of the net. Servboting may works on the 99% of the tour, but not on Novak."
tennis,3d2k13,Denek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:35:56 2015 UTC,federer beating djokovic these days is like him beating nadal back in his prime. he CAN win but he has to come up with ridiculous shots and a ridiculous game overall to do it. every rally federer wins against djokovic will come up in the highlight reel because it ended with federer playing an amazing shot. if he plays a good but not great match he will now lose 100% of the time because djokovic will just out grind him and out power him from the baseline
tennis,3d21uu,volken330,57,Sun Jul 12 22:03:55 2015 UTC,"I don't get it, what is so off putting with Djokovic off court? On court, I get it, he can even annoy me sometimes. But off court he is one of the nicest guys you can meet.  Most recent example? Roland Garros final. He was gutted. Destroyed. He beat Rafa, he beat Murray, didn't have a day to rest. Wawrinka basically stole the trophy that was his. He was awesome in defeat, very gracious, congratulated Wawrinka truly with his heart, and I think the audience saw that as well, as he was rewarded with a 3 minute standing ovation.  In his interviews, he strictly stated Wawrinka outplayed him, not once did he imply that he was tired or anything to undermine his achievement, even if it was plainly obvious when he said he will not play tennis until Wimbledon that he needed a rest."
tennis,3d21uu,vunacar,17,Mon Jul 13 01:59:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, his coach Becker (not Novak himself though) blamed the loss on playing three days in a row in an interview afterwards.  But Novak is a cool guy, and he's so gracious after defeat too"
tennis,3d21uu,flat_tamales,27,Mon Jul 13 02:13:48 2015 UTC,Becker is a blabber mouth. Both Djokovic and Federer disliked that he blabbed about the two of them not liking each other. Djokovic doesn't control what Becker thinks or says.
tennis,3d21uu,vunacar,3,Mon Jul 13 02:17:07 2015 UTC,"Wawrinka didn't steal nothing. He earned it. If Djokovic wants the French Open trophy, he'll have to earn it himself."
tennis,3d21uu,jeffwingersballs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:56:59 2015 UTC,Maybe now he got better but when he started being good and winning constantly he used to do this thing where he took of his shirt and started hittint his chest really hard with one hand while looking at his coach/family and was incredible creppy.  Even if he doesn't do this anymore this will forever be in my head and that is why I will never like him
tennis,3d21uu,Los_olvidados,-4,Mon Jul 13 19:24:23 2015 UTC,"The weird thing about Djokovic is that he really isn't doing something out of the norm so you'd have a rational reason to dislike him. Becker is terrible, his father is talking a lot of bullshit but novak himself is humble and has a great game. With all that said, i can appreciate his game and accomplishments, but i dislike him. I can't really put it into words. i don't like the way he screams on court and vents his frustration even though every other top player does this too. i don't like his way of celebrating victories. Jerzy maybe said it best, he's fake and some people can tell."
tennis,3d21uu,Felixisism,13,Mon Jul 13 10:48:04 2015 UTC,"I've yet to see anybody put together a rational case for their dislike of Djokovic, despite repeatedly challenging people on this sub and elsewhere.

tennis,3d21uu,it_turns_out,3,Mon Jul 13 11:33:52 2015 UTC,"I don't dislike him, I just don't like him, and when it comes to tennis unless Federer or Murray are playing, I want the underdog to win.

tennis,3d21uu,summatclever,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"I wonder if on some level people find him a bit less relatable because he's Eastern European... maybe subconsciously he reminds people of Soviet athletes in the cold war.

tennis,3d21uu,alj8,-3,Mon Jul 13 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"You're obviously not reading closely enough. Many people take the words of Janowicz, Gulbis and other professional tennis players who have come out stating that Novak is fake or not a nice person. A lot of people, in and out of the locker room, didn't like Novak and his families hostile behavior in the crowd; see the often circulated video where Roger yells at them to be quiet during a match. Many folks didn't like his earlier lack of sportsmanship of constantly retiring matches early in his career which lead to Andy Roddick calling him out for feigning injury which ultimately lead to that strange US Open where the crowd vigorously booed him during his post match interview. And many tennis fans, especially the purist fans of the sport, don't like the shirt tearing, the constant yelling and screaming, the racquet and ball smashing, the perceived yelling at the ball boys and girls, etc."
tennis,3d21uu,MCallanan,12,Mon Jul 13 12:12:21 2015 UTC,And then you have Mirka Federer
tennis,3d21uu,raped_giraffe,5,Mon Jul 13 12:23:58 2015 UTC,pretty sure Roger was shit scared to go home yesterday
tennis,3d21uu,boomskats,13,Mon Jul 13 12:32:37 2015 UTC,"Tennis players aren't friends, who cares what Janowicz has to say. Are we really going to just take his and Gulbis's words and run with them? Fuck that.   Novak is so far from fake it's ridiculous. The only thing he can be accused of is holding back a little on all the fun (or annoying) shit he used to do...but that's not his fault, he got called out hard. So, people wanted him to stop being the ""djoker"", he stopped...and now he's fake. Stupid.   And Novak isn't responsible for his parents' behavior. It clearly bothered Novak more than anyone else, as it was obvious by his lack of titles since his first AO. Once he grew up old enough to tell his parents to fuck off, he did that. But you surely cannot blame a 19 year old for not having the balls to stand up to his parents who invested everything they had in his success...  As for the US Open, I loved it. Even the US Open crowd loved it in the long run. That's what the US Open is all about."
tennis,3d21uu,pfc_bgd,0,Mon Jul 13 14:17:37 2015 UTC,"Tennis players are not friends? That's incorrect. There are many true genuine friendships throughout men's tennis many of them high profiled friends such as Roger and Rafa, Roger and Stan, Rafa and Andy, et al. Furthermore, these men all have a lot of respect for one another because they have to practice together. That's the biggest difference between the men's game and the women's game, the men practice together and know each other much more closely. The women do not and because of that there's a lot of downright hatred in the women's game that you just don't see in the men's game.     If it was just Ernests Gulbis' words I would probably side with you and not run with them. The reason for that is quite simple, he has a reputation for simply saying shit just to catch headlines. However, Janowicz doesn't have a reputation for talking shit just to talk shit. Andy Roddick, another outspoken critic of Djokovic during his playing days, also didn't have that reputation. And when Becker comes out and says Roger and Djokovic don't like each other? And when Novak's father Srdan comes out and says that Rafa and Novak don't like each other? Now there's a trend beginning. It's a trend that can't be said about any other top 100 player in the ATP.      Now, I do not hate Novak Djokovic. I was simply putting forward arguments, rationals ones at that, that have been found around this subreddit as to why people do not like Novak Djokovic. It's sad my comment was down voted because it shows an influx of people in this subreddit that simply vote with emotions rather than logic. Regardless, those are typical arguments as to why people don't like Novak Djokovic and they are based on moments in his career where he himself and the people around him made himself look bad."
tennis,3d21uu,MCallanan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:17:49 2015 UTC,"It is not incorrect that they're not friends for the most part. Sure, Djokovic has great friends in Tipsarevic and Troicki, but that's mainly because they're countrymen and not really rivals. As soon as two tennis players are bitter rivals, you can throw away friendship.   That being said, no one ever said that Novak doesn't respect Rafa or the Fed or Murray or whoever...they're simply just not friends. Any pics of any of top 4 partying together? Vacationing together? You can actually 100% dislike somebody and still respect them. Do you honestly expect Novak and Rafa to like each other? It's a fierce rivalry, it ain't happening. If you think Rafa and the Fed like each other and are friends, that's just plain silly.  Also, you should stop quoting others as if they're speaking for Novak. They're irrelevant (and it's Srdjan not Srdan).  You're really struggling to make your argument as well since you're stuck quoting Andy Roddick from what? 5 years ago? Gulbis man? Really? Isn't he too busy being rich as shit to play tennis? And Janowicz THE GOAT. Seriously, your arguments are almost as strong as me saying ""Federer and Stan hate each other, remember what Mirka said to Stan""...it sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?"

tennis,3d21uu,it_turns_out,3,Mon Jul 13 16:19:28 2015 UTC,I am sorry you felt my post was emotional. The truth is it wasn't. I simply put down the talking points that people point to in this subreddit when speaking about why they dislike Novak Djokovic all of which I find to be logical and rational reasons to dislike someone. I personally don't overly dislike or like Novak Djokovic. I was cheering him on in yesterdays Wimbledon but more so than not I am rather emotionless when it comes to players I don't have a rooting interest in.

When he plays bad he acknowledges it and when his opponent plays well he acknowledges that too. You can hate Nadal for picking his butt or taking a long time between points, but you just can't hate him as a person. Despite coming from a very well off family he still gives it his all(like in practices) and stays humble and genuine with his interviews and signing autographs for everyone even in defeat."

He withdrew from Queens Club 2006 during a match with Hewitt before the Wimbledon loss to Federer because of a supposed shoulder injury.   After losing to Kyrgios at Wimbledon last year, he waited a while and then shut down the rest of his season, saying he had an injured wrist.  Against Smyczek this year at the AO while he was struggling, he pretended to be either sick or having a back injury recurrence. Then it suddenly went away when he started beating him. Then it returned when he was getting beaten soundly by Berdych.  You can literally count more slams since 2006 that he cited injury during or after losing the match than you can slams he lost in that he did not cite injury during that period."
tennis,3d21uu,PokeMyPillow,4,Mon Jul 13 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"Good job finding every incidence Rafa cited an injury. I don't know about all of these cites since I only got into pro tennis just 2 years ago. But I'll just say right now. His knees have always bothered him ever since he was a teenager. Naturally, issues do come up throughout his career. In 2009 he pulled out of Wimbledon after his knee issue. In 2012 he pulled out of the rest of the season after his knee issue. In 2014 the back clearly did bother him as seen in that final. In the AO this year he literally leaned over the side of the court in pain. Who goes through all of these measures to give an excuse for losing a match? Lose half your season, your ranking, and miss out on a chance to defend your titles? In 2007 Wimbledon he even had a 4-1 lead in the set where he called for the trainer due to the knee issue. I don't think he gave it as an ""excuse"" for losing that match either. Then with Berdych in AO this year, he didn't have any issues. He just played very bad. Watch that interview, he says he played a very bad match, Berdych played really well, and he actually felt completely healthy. He never gave an excuse for losing in the 2012 AO to Djokovic either. Said it was one of the greatest matches he played in."
tennis,3d21uu,TimRattayGotScrewed,-7,Mon Jul 13 17:46:04 2015 UTC,"Nadal's fake injuries and taking time off are tactics. He's all about gamesmanship. It's the same with him constantly taking so long to serve, rearranging his water bottles, and getting on-court coaching from his Uncle.  Notice how he doesn't cite knee injuries after he wins, only when he loses."
tennis,3d21uu,vamosrafan,2,Mon Jul 13 17:49:45 2015 UTC,Rearranging his water bottles give him an advantage?
tennis,3d21uu,TimRattayGotScrewed,-5,Mon Jul 13 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"It's a stalling, gamesmanship tactic."
tennis,3d21uu,PokeMyPillow,2,Mon Jul 13 22:44:31 2015 UTC,"How do you stall by rearranging water bottles? Many players go over the time limit in between games and Nadal doesn't even do it all the time. How is simply putting a water bottle perfectly next to another supposed to give him an advantage? It just helps him out mentally. Same thing with the taking a long time between serve. How does this harm the opponent? It disturbs the returner's rhythm? Why doesn't it disturb Nadal's own service rhythm then? Federer's no hassle service game vs Nadal's rituals between points are two opposite sides of the spectrum and it isn't about disrupting the opponent at all, its just what the players are used to. I for one take a somewhat long time between my service points when playing too since it gives me time to slow down after a long point or keep myself grounded/getting frustrated."
tennis,3d21uu,TimRattayGotScrewed,-4,Mon Jul 13 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"Everything Nadal does it about making the opponent wait. He makes them wait in the locker room for him to get ready, he makes them wait for him to serve, he makes them wait for his MTO to finish, and he makes the tour wait for him to return from his ""injury."" Taking a little more time than normal to think about the serve is one thing. He goes beyond just taking a little more time to focus. You'd think he was defusing a bomb."
tennis,3d21uu,salliek76,2,Mon Jul 13 23:07:24 2015 UTC,"Notice how he doesn't cite knee injuries after he wins, only when he loses.   This makes no sense.  Why would he credit a knee injury for helping him win?"
tennis,3d21uu,TimRattayGotScrewed,0,Mon Jul 13 23:07:49 2015 UTC,"Not credit it - mentions it. Why does he only mention it after he loses?

Federer's back hurt during Wimbledon 2012 and he won the thing while acknowledging it. Never the case for Nadal."

tennis,3d21uu,PokeMyPillow,11,Mon Jul 13 03:13:57 2015 UTC,"This is the one time I can recall Nadal did anything even close to being unsportsmanlike. You know how Rafa jumps up and down a lot before the warmups and stuff like that? Rosol was doing the same during warm ups for this match. Nadal obviously became very annoyed by Rosol(more so by Rosol's antics rather than him losing)but even then, he picked up Rosol's racquet for him after Rosol literally threw his racquet into the net before going up for a handshake. I rewatched the end of that match just now and Nadal still goes to sign autographs right next to Rosol after the match. But then you go back to this year's Australian Open or some other past losses and Nadal clearly admits that not only did he play bad, but his opponent also played well even when he stepped it up."

tennis,3d21uu,Personacorona,3,Sun Jul 12 22:14:23 2015 UTC,I think Nadal's passion for tennis is far greater than any of the players on tour at the moment.  The small rituals that he does and the stress that he puts his body under negatively affects his heath (as can be seen from his injuries) just to win.    His bull logo on his products accurately depicts his never give up attitude even if the majority is against him.  If you read his biography you learn a lot more of his younger life which gives you a better understanding of his current on court conduct.  He was raised to appreciate tennis and taught that it was a privilege to be able to play that sport and is the reason why he has never broken a tennis racquet before (could be wrong but just remember reading that in his book).
tennis,3d21uu,Mrtanner69,12,Mon Jul 13 06:04:04 2015 UTC,"While I don't disagree with your statements, you kinda did use one presser and use that as your only basis. I agree, Nadal is a fantastic human being who was raised right. But it's not like Federer never gives his opponents credit for their wins. In the QF match this year at RG against Stan Federer flat out said that Stan beat his ass and there was nothing he could do, Stan was just too good. I for one would love to see Nadal back to his best as it would be like a throwback to 2012 with all 4 of the top guns(and Stan) playing very well."

These people are, probably without exception, highly spirited people. They thrive on competition and/or combat. They have intense emotions. They're courageous, etc etc.  So, I'll admit that some people, like Fognini, get to me big time, but overall, it doesn't surprise me that these guys have a hard time with losses. They wouldn't have pushed themselves so hard and made so many sacrifices to get to their level without loathing losing.  So, maybe Nadal is humbler, but I guess I'm not expecting my athletes to be super gracious. I like to watch good tennis, see the handshake afterwards, and that's about all I ask."

tennis,3d21uu,DownWthisSortOfThing,13,Mon Jul 13 01:14:20 2015 UTC,"Prime example that really sealed my dislike for his subtle ""holier than thou"" attitude, was when Novak hit that ridiculous return in the 2011 final on match point. In the post match interview, Federer basically just says ""it's was a stupid risky shot that he got lucky on"" it really discounted what Novak had done in that match and how he had fought back from 3-5 15-40 to win the match, but he boiled it down to luck. That bothered me for sure."
tennis,3d21uu,pfc_bgd,4,Mon Jul 13 08:21:06 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Djokovic basically agreed with that assessment of that point though. He had essentially given up and so he hit that super risky shot because he didn't care if it landed in or not. Of course, everything else he did in that match was skill and not luck, but I can understand why Fed (or anyone else) would be annoyed by an opponent winning after seemingly giving up and not caring."
tennis,3d21uu,StockSadness,3,Mon Jul 13 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"we're talking about the best returner in history...I think Novak simply felt that he needed to do something spectacular or it was over. I wouldn't call it giving up, it was pretty much his only chance. What was he supposed to do? Get in a long rally with the Fed who is on a roll? Nope.   Federer was pretty negative about all that. There was no need for him to say anything but ""he went for it, and it went it...what can you do""...Instead he went off for too long."
tennis,3d21uu,pfc_bgd,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you remember correctly. In his USO press conference following that win, he said that he had to take his chances against Roger, hence the return. He vehemently denied it having anything to do with anger at the crowd. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nAKkTwRgXqk"
tennis,3d21uu,Rac3318,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:27:14 2015 UTC,I wonder if the Fed had a flashback of that forehand in the last game of the match yesterday...Nole ripped it.
tennis,3d21uu,TimRattayGotScrewed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"To frank, Federer was right. It was an incredibly lucky shot, and Djokovic afterward admitted he got lucky. 9 times out of ten he probably couldn't have done it. I would have been bitter about it, too, to be quite honest."
tennis,3d21uu,Paragon_Flux,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:36:34 2015 UTC,I agree this was sour grapes. But at least he didn't pretend he was injured.

Everyone thinks he is some kind of quiet, reserved genius. When they met the Queen of England, he had to ask Novak what to do (much to the surprise of the interviewers:  https://youtu.be/inl6uyLifJg?t=124  )  Federer is not arrogant, he is just uneducated and ignorant, those traits are easily confused. This will get down-voted, because the bitter truth can be hard to accept."
tennis,3d21uu,Paragon_Flux,3,Mon Jul 13 23:38:43 2015 UTC,"You're such an obnoxious dolt.   Oh noez, he had to ask Novak what to do when they met the Queen. Like...so fucking what?  Federer speaks more languages fluently than you've said smart things in your entire miserable life."

tennis,3d21uu,janiqua,4,Mon Jul 13 08:13:53 2015 UTC,I don't see the big deal. Any of the top athletes in any sport have an arrogance about them...but I'm glad with that. They're working harder than everyone and put in the hours to continue to be the best. Why do they need to throw a party for their biggest rivals when they lose? A quick handshake after is more than enough I think.
tennis,3d21uu,gpalyan,-3,Mon Jul 13 12:45:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole thing reeks of melodrama"
tennis,3d21uu,blekginger,10,Mon Jul 13 11:16:09 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with this assessment of Federer. I just watched the interview you're referring to, and I didn't hear anything arrogant. The guy acknowledged Djokovic is no. 1 but said he expected more from himself. I think most of the top players in tennis are very likable in their own ways. They are all great ambassadors of the sport."
tennis,3d21uu,avaliantheel,5,Mon Jul 13 06:22:20 2015 UTC,"What I like with Roger is that you know he'll always be honest in his interviews. There's nothing of the ""I'm only saying this cause I have to"", he'll give his honest view of whatever matter is discussed and that's it. You know that you're getting him. When you see interviews with Rafa or Nole you're not quite sure if it's them or just an act.  At least that's my view of it."
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,15,Mon Jul 13 12:04:43 2015 UTC,I don't disagree with anything Roger said in his post-match interview.  He believes that matches like this one were one his racket and I agree with him on that.  He acknowledges that Djokovic played a great match but I don't blame him for a second for voicing his opinion that he was the one who lost the match as opposed to Djokovic winning.  Roger made errors.  He could have played cleaner.  He knows it and he blames himself for it.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It keeps him focused and hungry and competitive.  That's just some people's personality.
tennis,3d21uu,avaliantheel,35,Mon Jul 13 00:39:13 2015 UTC,Djokovics return won him this. Fed still served 67% but Djokovic is not Andy Murray nor any other opponent Fed faced. You think it's simply coincidence his serve % was almost as high as the Murray match but he had way less aces in one more set of play today and won less points on first serve? Just take a look at that last game it's a microcosm of how good Djokovic is.
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,7,Mon Jul 13 01:19:56 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree.  I attribute the loss to Federer's 35 UEs.  He made 19 more errors than Djokovic.  Also for the sake of clarity, Federer's 1st serve % was 67%.  He won 74% of the points that went in.  Against Murray, his 1st serve % was 76%.  He served much better against Murray than he did against Djokovic."
tennis,3d21uu,avaliantheel,30,Mon Jul 13 01:27:13 2015 UTC,"How do you not attribute that to the guy across the net from you. Different opponents force you to do different things, you can't simply say he served worse. Also Djokovic was controlling from the baseline more than Murray resulting in Fed having to do more. You can't simply use the same strategy against every player."
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,-13,Mon Jul 13 01:33:50 2015 UTC,"Apologies, I was a little ambiguous.  I only attribute the UEs and 1st serve in % to Roger.  Novak has little impact on UEs and he has no impact on 1st serve in %."
tennis,3d21uu,Evilpotatohead,18,Mon Jul 13 02:02:11 2015 UTC,"He definitely has impact on first serve %. How does he not, if a guy is a poor returner you can place serves with a bigger margin from the lines , if a guy is amazing at returning if you have to get the ball that much closer to the lines, which results in more misses. This also goes for rally strokes, if a player is super agile and fast you have to get the ball closer to the lines for a winner. Also Djokovic had 30 less errors but only 12 less winners. It's not a clear case of Federer losing it and Djokovic waiting for errors."
tennis,3d21uu,StockSadness,-4,Mon Jul 13 02:14:30 2015 UTC,Murray is one of the best returners of serve. Him and Djokovic are pretty close to other in that aspect.
tennis,3d21uu,avaliantheel,2,Mon Jul 13 12:07:00 2015 UTC,"Murray and Djokovic are 2 of the best returners on tour, but they're different types of returners. Murray is really good at neutralizing big serves (like Isner's for example) and getting rallies to neutral. Djokovic is better at returning serves aggresively. Djokovic was putting several returns at Federer's feet yesterday. Federer had more freedom when it came to his first shot against Murray."
tennis,3d21uu,nista002,-10,Mon Jul 13 21:15:14 2015 UTC,I never meant to imply that Djokovic waited for errors and played a defensive game.  I'm just saying that the 19 extra UEs is enough points to equal nearly 5 games.  I will say this much though.  Djokovic was better than Roger on the big points.  That cannot be argued.
tennis,3d21uu,bumbleb333,9,Mon Jul 13 02:32:21 2015 UTC,"No tennis decisions are made in a vacuum. Djokovic was inviting Roger to go down the line and play aggressive rally shots for a while today, since he knew he could get to them, and there's a higher error margin going DTL. Roger accepted those invitations to attack, and it played out in Novak's favor since Roger couldn't hit through Novak with the shots that did stay in."
tennis,3d21uu,avaliantheel,15,Mon Jul 13 05:13:51 2015 UTC,yeah but you are assuming that federer would have won those points if not for the unforced errors. he HAD to try make those shots or he would have lost anyway by getting outslugged by djokovic on the baseline
tennis,3d21uu,bumbleb333,-6,Mon Jul 13 03:55:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm assuming that he would have made those shots instead of missing them."
tennis,3d21uu,GTASanAndreasLubitz,6,Mon Jul 13 12:59:41 2015 UTC,and he would have lost playing that passively anyway. the only way he could have won yesterday is if the majority of those UEs became winners or set up winners. they were not
tennis,3d21uu,nista002,4,Mon Jul 13 13:35:28 2015 UTC,UFE are a bullshit statistic. It's highly subjective which errors are forced or not.
tennis,3d21uu,GTASanAndreasLubitz,6,Mon Jul 13 04:14:36 2015 UTC,"Aces are even more bullshit, I really wish someone would make Unreturned Serves a more easily available statistic."
tennis,3d21uu,Ersatz_Okapi,2,Mon Jul 13 05:15:33 2015 UTC,At least there's no subjectivity to aces.
tennis,3d21uu,vunacar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:29:29 2015 UTC,"There's no subjectivity to unreturned serves, either. That's a 100% objective measure."
tennis,3d21uu,vgn,6,Tue Jul 14 01:36:09 2015 UTC,"There is more to tennis than just stats. Like, the game of tennis. Federer lost because his opponent was better than him, two years in a row now. He refuses to acknowledge that Djokovic is simply better than him, his arrogance does not allow it."
tennis,3d21uu,flat_tamales,22,Mon Jul 13 01:53:06 2015 UTC,"Roger on Novak today:   Well done Novak. That is sport, we don't know the outcome. I had my chances in the first set. I got lucky to win the second, had chances in the third.  ""But he was better on the bigger points. He was rock solid, I didn't play badly myself. That's how it goes.   Tell me where Roger doesn't acknowledge Novak wasn't better? Where is the arrogance here... I fail to see it. He even acknowledges that the 2nd set win was lucky for him.   There is a difference between acknowledging how well your opponent played on a given day and accepting that you are inferior to him permanently - implying that you will never beat him. First of all there is no such thing as permanent inferiority at that level. These guys beat each other and turn around records all the time.   And why should Roger believe that? Might as well hang up the racket if he thinks he can't beat Novak or Stan or someone else.   I think the humility angle is overplayed here. As long as there is fair play, respectful behavior on court, and an acknowledgment of your opponent's good play, that is enough. There is no need to sing their praises and buy into the mental idea that they cannot be beaten."
tennis,3d21uu,avaliantheel,6,Mon Jul 13 04:26:30 2015 UTC,"He has no reason to think that Djokovic is better than him, as no successful player ever thinks that about an opponent. He's given Novak credit for being the better player on the given day, which is as much as any player has to do, or will do. Besides, that's wrong to think since the h2h is 20 all, and it's not as if he hasn't beaten Novak this year or last year."
tennis,3d21uu,vunacar,9,Mon Jul 13 02:06:31 2015 UTC,I don't think it's that.  I see it more as he can't control what his opponent does but he can control what he does.  Did he do everything the way he wanted regardless of who was on the other side of the net?  No?  Then the match was lost on his racket.
tennis,3d21uu,NoneAndABit,0,Mon Jul 13 02:01:02 2015 UTC,But that excuse can be said for every tennis player on the planet. That is no reason not to compliment the play of the guy who defeated you.   I am 100% sure every tennis player who ever lost a game felt they could have done more.
tennis,3d21uu,KyleG,10,Mon Jul 13 02:05:44 2015 UTC,"Except he did compliment him. It's pretty unambiguous. The very first thing he said at the trophy ceremony was in praise of Novak:   I think Novak played, not only great today, but the whole two weeks plus the whole year plus last year plus the year before that, so you deserve it. Well done, Novak."
tennis,3d21uu,avaliantheel,10,Mon Jul 13 04:57:09 2015 UTC,"Dude, if you don't think Federer complimented Djokovic after this final, then you're willfully being stupid because you want to win an argument, actual truth be damned."
tennis,3d21uu,bumbleb333,2,Mon Jul 13 08:32:43 2015 UTC,"He did give his congratulations to Djokovic.  Roger just thinks that his best would have been the difference between winning and losing today.  If Djokovic played his unquestioned best, I think he would have little choice but to say that Djokovic was just having one of those days."

tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,10,Mon Jul 13 03:17:27 2015 UTC,"I support your decision to be pro-Rafa, but must point out that Federer has won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award ten times, and that award is voted on by the ATP players. So I think there's a slim chance he's actually an ungracious and unkind person."
tennis,3d21uu,Jobin1616,-10,Sun Jul 12 23:54:56 2015 UTC,"You seriously take that much merit in that award, most players don't care and just sheep it and vote Federer especially the lower ranked guys. I can almost guarantee Fed gets very few votes from the top guys.  The award doesn't really mean anything, doesn't get you sponsorships, a lot money, or anything special so nobody has reason to care that much."
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,18,Mon Jul 13 01:17:19 2015 UTC,"Oh you can guarantee that? Ok, everyone disregard a seemingly objective way of judging sportsmanship and instead just trust this guy because he knows all of the top players. Seriously, how can you act like you know who the top players vote for?"
tennis,3d21uu,TimRattayGotScrewed,-12,Mon Jul 13 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"OP broke it down for you quite clearly, you think the tops guys that play Fed the more than lower ranked guys don't hear this in his talk too? They play him more and therefore get to hear it more. Players aren't fans they are competing to win so will read through what an opponent says more clearly than fans that worship the players and never see them in anything but good light. Honestly did you not read OPs post, he is a Fed fan boy and has the ability to call a spade a spade. He provided numerous examples.   The award doesn't get you any deals, money, anything special. Why would players care that much in their vote. How many different players does Fed play in a year? Not that many. After the first two rounds realistically he is playing the same small pool of guys. Do you know how many players are in the ATP ? It's just sheep mentality because they really don't give a fuck. Young players grew up with Fed winning and just throw him a vote but never actually Played him or had to hear a press conference about their match together. Do you really think they care that much to study all of his conferences? Not a fucking chance."
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,10,Mon Jul 13 01:48:25 2015 UTC,Andy Roddick says you're wrong. So do Tim Henman and Ivan Ljubicic. You're an idiot.
tennis,3d21uu,TimRattayGotScrewed,-14,Mon Jul 13 03:45:19 2015 UTC,"Oh wow 3 players, that's like a whole less than 1% of the ATP, we must surely take their word for it,  all 3 of which Federer dominated h2h. Let's  talk to some players that have beaten him consistently and see how nice he is then. You are fucking daft."
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,2,Mon Jul 13 04:01:47 2015 UTC,"You're such a hilarious dolt. Who are the players who have beaten him consistently? Nadal? Federer's been nothing but a gentleman to the little mud roller. He let him ride on his fucking private plane once.   Djokovic isn't his fan because he told his obnoxious parents who deemed him the ""son of God"" to ""be quiet, OK"" when they were making noise during his match.  And that's about it. Murray doesn't give a shit either way."
tennis,3d21uu,TimRattayGotScrewed,-14,Mon Jul 13 04:07:48 2015 UTC,"How many more examples than what OP provided do you fucking need? Federer also copiously poked fun at Djokovic retiring in GSs due to shit he actually had surgery for.  There was absolutely no need for comments like that. Like holy shit it's right there, did you read his post? He's not a fucking angel. Fed h2h against Nadal is abysmal so he's not dumb enough to say shit like I played poorly when he loses that much.   Murray is not indifferent, he might have been once but the 5 setter at AO changed that. They had a few moments there.   You also just called Nadal a mud roller , that tells me enough about how little you respect the game. An all time great being called a mud roller. Good job pal."
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,6,Mon Jul 13 04:14:25 2015 UTC,"You just said, ""let's talk to some players that have beaten him consistently and see how nice he is then."" Then I point out he's nice to THE ONLY GUY WHO HAS BEATEN HIM CONSISTENTLY, and you say that he's not dumb enough to say bad shit when he loses so much? LOL.  This is why you shouldn't eat paint chips.  What examples did the OP provide that mean jack shit? None. Federer said nothing wrong after the Djokovic match. He answered questions from journalists and the OP, being a complete imbecile, didn't even grasp the context (or refused to because he's a Nadal fan starting a troll post). The OP apparently expects Federer to throw Djokovic a party for winning the match or something. He said the guy played well. What more does he want?   Djokovic retired in so many matches it was a running joke among ALL the players. It wasn't just because of his BS ""breathing problem"" that he lied about having a surgery for (there are no records of this so I don't believe a word that came from his team's mouth). He retired once because of a sore throat. The guy is a blatant doper and an obnoxious, cocky frat bro dick - it's fucking blatant to anyone with a functioning brain - and I'm supposed to feel bad for poor ""Son of God, The King is Dead, Long Live the King""ovic. He's a Serbian Roddick but without the humility Roddick has about his game/talent, which is probably partly why the two clashed.  Murray has said much worse things to opponents on the court than whatever Federer said to him. Just ask Del Potro and Rosol."
tennis,3d21uu,mahcity,-3,Mon Jul 13 04:32:51 2015 UTC,"Only guy that has beaten him consistently? the Djokovic h2h is now 20-20 , he is only up 13-11 on Murray who's coming back from injury. Murray was actually up in that h2h. Is that not consistently?   He said he played well once, but said the match was in his control, that his errors lost it. BS, just look at that last game and how Djokovic returned.   Lol no records of it? Are you his doctor? Why would those ever be public. You are a fucking joke, get Federer's cock out of your mouth pleaseeeeeeee. Blatant doper? Omg child please do not fucking have children you are stupid beyond belief. Humility about talent? Djokovic is leagues ahead of Roddick in talent, are you fucked? There is a reason Roddick has 1 GS and Djokovic already has 9.  Please do us a favour and leave this planet. You can't be serious with your statements. My god there are some Fed fan boys here that are bad, but you my retarded friend take the cake. Have a very special day for a very special little man."
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,0,Mon Jul 13 10:16:19 2015 UTC,You were willing to accept Federer is fake based off of the comments of 1 ATP player.  At this point I think you are just trolling.
tennis,3d21uu,mahcity,0,Mon Jul 13 14:58:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not basing it off one player at all.  I have thought this long before Becker said anything just by listening to his press conferences. I'm not saying he's completely fake, obviously all players are a little fake in their comments regarding others. Most of them know there is no point to add drama and to just settle things on the court. Federer just speaks with arrogance regarding performances, he'll look more at the chances he missed rather than the chances taken away from him by something his opponent did. He dismisses tactics that he wouldn't use that an opponent does successfully if it is a risky play (ie going for big returns, bigger serves/strokes than normal in situations where they are down)"
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,2,Mon Jul 13 15:41:43 2015 UTC,I doubt you watch more press conferences than the once that were linked.  Roger acknowledges his opponents and a lot and has become very gracious in his losses.  Just because someone at times focuses on what they did wrong that doesn't make them arrogant.
tennis,3d21uu,mahcity,0,Mon Jul 13 21:13:17 2015 UTC,You underestimate how much I follow the sport. Compare a loss to Rafa conference where he gets beaten to one where Djokovic wins comfortably or somebody else. He does not speak as well about other as he does Rafa.
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:17:17 2015 UTC,"Your reasoning and logic is so backwards it makes me sad.  The fact that there is no deals, money, or anything special is the reason why people would not fake their vote, especially if they did not like the person.  If they are willing to vote for someone and have it be anonymous, don't you think they would vote for the person who they thought deserved it most?  Do you really think all of the people on the ATP tour though... ""I know how we can really stick it to Fed, let's all vote to give him the sportsmanship award, that will show him.""    OP provided a total of 4 interviews and provided an example from one of the biggest hot heads that is currently on the tour.  I don't disagree with the OP that Nadal is more gracious in his post match interviews, but the fact that he is calling Federer fake or even thinking that I do have a problem with.  People who ACTUALLY know Federer talk about how humble and gracious he is, how much he loves the game, and how genuine a person he is.  Let's also not forget that he gives tons of money to charity.    Keep calling it sheep mentality, but the only person here being illogical is you.  I'm sure you think the downvotes justify your feelings and make you think everyone here just can't ""call a spade a spade"", but maybe you should try to open your mind a little bit and not be so quick to believe everything you read on the internet."
tennis,3d21uu,mahcity,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:58:00 2015 UTC,"Your logic is just as backwards as mine then. You must be able to see the point in not caring what the vote is if the winner just gets a newspaper headline and silver plate. Especially if you don't know players well enough, it's easier to follow a trend. Think about how many players there are in the ATP, how many of them actually know the top guys? The top guys practice  with each other, play each other, sometimes play doubles together. The lower ranked guys do not do this with the Top guys. There is so much competition at the top that the best players don't have to interact with lower ranked players therefore these lower ranked players don't really get to know them, they might get to play them in an early round at a slam or masters but even then a draw holds only 128 players (not even close to the amount of players) so even the players that do get to play them will get eliminated early not hang around the grounds or locker room enough to see them because once they are eliminated they find the next small ATP to play so they can progress. PNobody runs a campaign for it. Do you not see that if you don't actually know a player that it is easier to follow a trend especially if the outcome has 0 effect on you. Also if you are a junior making it to the ATP level and you grew up with Federer winning titles and being dominant and he inspired you obviously you are voting for him. Now certain lower ranked players might know a top player due to being from the same country or something like that and will vote for them, but again the ATP has so many players that these occurrences are very small relatively. It's not about sticking it to Fed. It's just a vote for an award that will not affect your game in anyway.   Yes except everybody here thinks Djokovic is fake but they get upvoted. The same argument can be made, people who ACTUALLY know Djokovic talk about how humble he is and gracious he is, how much he loves the game, and how genuine he is. Ever here John Mcenroe go off about how much he likes Djokovic? Are we going to discredit him. Please don't use tons of money to charity. Every player does this, especially since most players are not from first world economic powers.  The downvotes are expected when this place is overrun with Fed fanboys who can't have anything bad said about him but will downvote any pro nadal/djokovic comment or post.  Read my other response to your other comment."
tennis,3d21uu,hivaidsislethal,3,Mon Jul 13 15:59:20 2015 UTC,"Everything you said there is entirely anecdotal and made up in your mind.  I think you should at least be able to entertain the thought that it is more likely someone who gets voted for a sportsmanship award is more likely to be a good sport and genuine person than someone who does not get voted for an award.  Especially if it is A PEER voting system.  I trust what the other players from the ATP tour say much more than I trust a random person who decided to make a username about aids being lethal, or any person on the internet at that.    I have no issues with the current Djokovic.  Most people here remember when he was annoying and currently dropping out of matches and that put a bad taste in their mouth.  But I don't know anyone who has a hatred for Djokovic like you have for Federer."
tennis,3d21uu,winabean7,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:11:58 2015 UTC,"It's not a hatred for Federer it's for his fan boys who can't take criticism or have a discussion about how he's not the friendliest guy on tour. I respect his game, he is obviously very talented and you'd be stupid not to admit that. But when they go off on how Djokovic is fake, or start to mention that his rise was not natural. It's like they can't take the fact that someone is being regarded as equal to their boy. That seriously pisses me off. Just like MJ is arrogant and so is Lebron and Kobe so is Federer, just be able to accept as is if you are saying that same shit about his competitors."
tennis,3d21uu,SwissBliss,6,Mon Jul 13 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"The award doesn't really mean anything, doesn't get you sponsorships, a lot money, or anything special   I think this is exactly why you can trust there's some merit in it. It means the ATP players get no personal gain or benefit from voting for a particular person, so they're likely voting for someone they genuinely believe deserves it."
tennis,3d21uu,it_turns_out,7,Mon Jul 13 05:32:07 2015 UTC,"What's the point of a post discrediting someone in the first place? If you look carefully you can find flaws in everyone, Federer was found to be literally the 2nd most respected person in the world after Mandela, he won the player-voted sportsmanship award 10 times, and is overall an extraordinary person and role model.   He just lost a match that he wanted very badly, and you're holding his interview as the representation of his character. At the end of the match he was asked by the on court interviewer ""sometimes you just have to say ""too good"" right?"". That is the stupidest thing you could say to a runner up. It implies that Federer had no say in this match and that Novak pummelled him. Every set was close, and he won one of them. Federer lost the match more than Novak won it. You use the French Open Final example, but that's a case of Stan winning, more so than Novak losing.   Yes Nadal is nice off court, so is Novak, so is everyone really, but Federer is also a role model."

tennis,3d21uu,KyleG,-1,Mon Jul 13 11:38:05 2015 UTC,what part please?
tennis,3d21uu,bonoboboy,3,Mon Jul 13 11:59:30 2015 UTC,"All you need to know about Fed is that he's won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award ten times and Nadal once, and all other active players zero times. This is an award voted on by the players themselves as the player who most embodies the ideals of fair play, respect for others, and honesty.  It boggles the mind that a person made aware of that fact can continue to believe Fed is a rude, entitled jerk rather than an extremely well-liked member on tour. And yet there are people who go on believing that year after year.  If the players just voted for whoever without caring, Rafa would have won more than once, or Novak or Andy would have won as well. The fact is that Roger having so many more is beyond statistical anomaly. It's because the players actually believe the way they believe."
tennis,3d21uu,KyleG,0,Mon Jul 13 08:27:58 2015 UTC,"It's voted by all the people on the tour, many of whom know Federer about as well as we know him. Wouldn't put too much weight on the sportsmanship award - for all you know ATP 500-1000 may have voted for Roger and the top 100 for Nadal."
tennis,3d21uu,bonoboboy,5,Mon Jul 13 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"...and yet the central thesis of ""Fed is an awful person"" is totally made up from a grand total of about five or ten minutes of TV clips. Call me crazy, but I'd say the people who share a locker room with him know him better than we do, so I'm willing to grant them trust. Remove the TV stuff and you have zero evidence that Federer is not a great guy. Not even Becker went that far.  We also have first-hand accounts from people like Andy Roddick, who have known him for years up close and behind the scenes, saying Fed is the most genuinely good guy on the tour. We also know thanks to James Blake that when he was in the hospital after his injury, Fed was the only player who checked in on how he was doing. The only one. And that news came out years after it happened on the night James Blake retired, so you can't even make a credible argument that Fed did it for publicity."
tennis,3d21uu,KyleG,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:27:18 2015 UTC,"My point is, Federer could win the award with a 600-400 majority, even if the 400 are the ones who are closer to him in ranking (meaning they would be at more tournaments together, in locker rooms, etc.). The lower 600 who don't really play slams still get to vote, and I doubt they meet Federer in the locker room. Their opinion is as good as ours - just videos.  Also, if you're going to list one-off incidents, Djokovic donated all of one of his Masters 1000 tournaments' prize money to flood victims."
tennis,3d21uu,bonoboboy,2,Mon Jul 13 19:23:25 2015 UTC,Link to me arguing that Djokovic is an asshole? For some asinine reason people like you assume it is impossible to think multiple players are good people...
tennis,3d21uu,Diamondpug,-2,Tue Jul 14 01:03:07 2015 UTC,"Fed was the only player who checked in on how he was doing. The only one.   the most genuinely good guy    Your emphasis on only implies that, not me.  Also, where is your rebuttal to the bulk of my post (if you have one)."
tennis,3d21uu,avaliantheel,3,Tue Jul 14 18:08:50 2015 UTC,"I think you underestimate how hard it must be for federer to lose these matches. He's very aware that he has very few chances left and this was certainly his best. When you are considered the goat I think it's perfectly acceptable to talk about your game. Federer doesn't need to compliment djokviics or nadals games when he loses to them, everyone knows they're better now. His arrogance is perfectly understandable and I don't see how it in any way makes him a worse person than the other two. They all have different approaches to tennis and losing. I don't think u can reasonably ask federer to be any more gracious in his losses. He is fantastic when winning or losing"
tennis,3d21uu,bonoboboy,13,Sun Jul 12 22:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is unbelievably difficult for Federer to lose these matches. I myself was incredibly sad today after his loss, so I can only imagine how he must feel. But as Rafa has gone through similar heart-wrenching losses (4 straight finals losses to Djokovic in 11-12!) and is in the most devastating free fall of his career, he has managed to maintain perspective.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHUT_L6WQg0m47s In this press conference right after Miami this year, Nadal said, ""Every tournament is a chance [to turn things around]. I have nothing to lose. At this point in my career, I've won enough things. I don't need to win more but I want to do it.""  This kind of recognition of his own fortune (even gratitude) feels very different from Fed's reactions to his own misfortune. In a way, Nadal feels remarkably mature even as his career might be falling apart."
tennis,3d21uu,avaliantheel,4,Sun Jul 12 22:21:14 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of why Nadal is more humble is because he spent 3 1/2 years in Roger's shadow before he became world number 1.  He was not officially better than Roger until post Wimbledon 2008.  In those years, he could give full credit to Roger and others because he was not ""the man"" yet.  Federer on the other hand was world number one for 237 consecutive weeks since he was 22 years old and he did not reach the international spotlight until after his first Wimbledon title.  He might as well have been world number one after his Wimbledon title.  There was no chance for him to become more humble in defeat because he never lost.  I'm not making excuses.  I'm just saying that the two players were molded under different circumstances."
tennis,3d21uu,bonoboboy,3,Mon Jul 13 02:57:09 2015 UTC,"since he was 22 years old    So, almost exactly when Nadal became no. 1 for the first time as well (and with more slams under his belt).   because he never lost   Except repeatedly to Nadal in the final of the only slam he couldn't win during his period of dominance."
tennis,3d21uu,avaliantheel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"I probably didn't word my thoughts properly.  My point is that regardless of age, Nadal was world number 2 for a really long time before he was world number 1.  Roger only had 7 months between being in the spotlight and being world number 1.  In his dominant years, the only time he had reason to even concede that someone was better than him was Rafa when they played on clay.  Rafa in those years was still a developing player on other surfaces.  He lost a lot more than Federer did on hard courts and grass so he had a much easier time accepting that he lost to the better hard court player or grass court player.  Federer did not have a ""growing"" phase.  He did not spend many years playing second fiddle until it was his turn.    I'm not taking cheap shots at Nadal or defending Federer.  I'm just explaining why I think a difference between the two in how they handle press conferences after losses exists."

Nadal also, similarly, didn't have too long from 2007 to 2008 (start of being in the limelight to taking the no. 1 ranking and beginning to challenge for dominance)"

tennis,3d21uu,jeffwingersballs,2,Mon Jul 13 03:00:36 2015 UTC,Nice write up. Lots of insight.
tennis,3d21uu,Jobin1616,2,Mon Jul 13 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"So yeah, do you want to be friends with him or enjoy him playing tennis while he tries to remain as close to his best form for as long as he can? Assuming you have a slim chance of being personally affected by his arrogance I'd say just enjoy the Tennis, man. After all, he looked Novak in the face and congratulated him at the ceremony and told him he deserved it. I see you're accumulating interviews and all but he had just lost another final at his favorite tournament, hard to really pump up your opponent when everything you could've done differently is fresh in your mind."
tennis,3d21uu,jeffwingersballs,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with this. As someone mentioned, Federer holds the record for Sportsmanship Awards, which are voted on by the players. There was absolutely nothing unsportsmanlike about his press conference today. You're just twisting his words. How can you say he rarely acknowledges his opponents? He always gives credit where it's due. It's easy to pick out Federer's lows and Nadal's highs and say Nadal is a better person, but you're being completely biased. Nadal's actions in the 2014 Australian Open Final were really poor form. He completely took away Stan's moment with his injury. The most professional thing to do would be not to reveal the injury until long after the loss, like Del Potro did with his wrist. Instead, many people see Stan's win in 2014 with an asterisk, when in reality he completely outplayed Nadal. So you have the constant injury excuses and taking away from his opponents. Then there's the time violations, and requesting an umpire be banned from his matches for enforcing the rules. Federer may occasionally come off as arrogant, but he is a great sportsman and there's no reason to think that the claims that he is a genuinely nice person are false. As for Nadal, he also seems like a great guy and a good sportsman, but he's not perfect like you've made him out to be. And here's his presser after Kyrgios beat him last year in which he claims he was the better player than Kyrgios during one of the sets that he lost: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqh7Tc0Cm5w. Now here is Nadal calling out Gulbis for saying something similar about one of their matches: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veirps-fSvM.  I'm not a Nadal hater, just being realistic. None of the players are perfect."
tennis,3d21uu,Jobin1616,5,Mon Jul 13 00:49:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a Nadal fan and I don't have an asterisk next to 2014 Australian Open. To me, if you beat Djokovic at the Australian Open, you deserve to be the champ.   It's unfortunate that Nadal was playing hurt, but even if he was 100%, I think he would have taken it to five sets and maybe win, but not necessarily."
tennis,3d21uu,jeffwingersballs,4,Mon Jul 13 01:21:06 2015 UTC,But that is an asterisk in itself. You're saying you think Nadal would've won. Wawrinka beat arguably the best player in Australian open history in the QFs and was outplaying Nadal before any signs of injury were evident. He won the tournament because he was the best player during those two weeks. Nadal just happened to be injured. That's how you see it without an asterisk.

You said ""I think he would have taken it to five sets and maybe win"".

Federer, being a competitor, refuses to accept losing as ""normal,"" even if it's to Djokovic."
tennis,3d21uu,Homitu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the club! I made that realization about 3 or 4 years ago. I was an avid Federer worshipper like many on this subreddit ever since he won his first Wimbledon back in 2003. He was the reason I started following tennis. I taped his matches and watched them many times. He was the reason I started playing tennis as a recreational sport. Hack, I even copied his style of shots ala Dimitrov, not as well as him, of course. I was blind to his arrogance because he was my hero, and I hated Nadal because he keeps beating Federer at majors. 2008 Wimbledon was devastating for me. And Rafa made Roger cry at 2009 Australian Open. I really wanted to see Nadal lose in earlier rounds because that cleared chances of Roger winning.   If you follow tennis for somewhat a long time as I did and you naturally pay close attention to the demeanor of the big 4 on and off the court. And you will understand that Rafa is the most genuine human being of them all. On the opposite spectrum Federer is the most arrogant, followed by Murray, IMO. Many will disagree hence the emphasis on IMO. Murray gets so much hate for his ego and arrogance. But Federer not near so. The reason I think is that Federer can back up with some good tennis. And it also helps that his devotees (like Patrick McEnroe or commentators like Jimmy Arias on Tennis channel) will sugar coat Roger’s arrogance with things like ‘Oh, he’s so honest.. he’s so matter of fact about things, etc.’ And nobody is willing to call out Roger when he’s salty when he loses or comments about how great his shots are when he beats down opponents. But Roger needs to understand that honesty without compassion is cruelty.  What really hit me wasn’t Rafa’s humility and Roger’s lack there of. But it was Rafa’s work ethics. The guy plays for every point. IMO, he’s the least talented of the big four (I’m sure many will disagree with me, hence my emphasis on IMO). But he’s the hardest working of them all, followed by Djokovic, then Federer and then Murray. Federer is the most talented, no question about it.   I started appreciating Rafa as I got to watch him struggle with injuries and work his way back and play amazing tennis in 2010 and 2013. And even when he loses it was never his lack of effort on his part. That’s the kind of spirit and work ethics I want to see from my own children. If they have talents like Roger god bless them but Rafa is the kind of guy I want them to look up as a role model. I know Rafa is struggling now both physically and mentally. But I hope to see him come back like he did in the past.   Most people think Roger is the GOAT and Rafa is just a freak of nature, I definitely used to think so too. But every day I’m more and more convinced that it’s the other way around."
tennis,3d21uu,lminors,3,Mon Jul 13 22:24:01 2015 UTC,"See, the thing about this is that Federer has consistently won the sportmanship award voted on by the players. I find the whole, ""Federer is so arrogant"" argument to be a bit silly. Players and coaches alike are constantly on record talking about how good of a guy he is and how nice he is. Roddick who had a horrible one-sided rivalry against him has said multiple times that Federer was the nicest guy he knew on tour that always showed respect to everyone.  I just don't buy it."
tennis,3d21uu,Care4eve,0,Mon Jul 13 23:40:55 2015 UTC,Lol this sub gonna eat this post up. All non-Federer dick riders have the same opinion and you know it. You were probably already a Nadal fan before you even wrote this.
tennis,3d21uu,KyleG,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:01:53 2015 UTC,"I don't follow this sub religiously, but I had no idea that Nadal had a bad reputation of any kind.  I instantly became a Nadal fan after the first post-match interview I saw of him, for all the reasons you explained.  My opinion of him was solidified after he beat Federer for the first time at Wimbledon, in the finals.  He won.  He fucking did it!  After all the back and forth clashing, with Nadal dominating on clay and Fed dominating on grass, Nadal finally dethrowned the king of Wimbledon.  But 90% of Nadal's speech was aimed at praising Federer and reassuring him that he's the greatest of all time.  He was so darn empathetic, he just couldn't help but feeling for Federer.  Then he was so darn kind and compassionate the he just couldn't help but try to cheer him up.  This man, in this moment he earned through so much hard work, wasn't even thinking about himself and his earned glory.  He was too busy empathizing with his opponent and graciously encouraging him.  I don't know how anyone could not like Nadal after moments like that.  His character has always been so obvious to me.    Anyway, I tend to split my fandom into two rather separate categories: I either like a player for his on-the-court ability and style, or I like a player for their personality and character.  The latter takes precedence in terms of determining my overall opinion of the player and just how big of a fan of that player I become.  Ideally, however, the best players give you both."

I've admired Nadals ability to be humble over his career, now more than ever. Though i love having Roger in the game and see what a great influence he has had on tennis, I've not been able to get behind him as a fan because I've often picked up on similar things mentioned in your post that have rubbed me the wrong way. I don't often mention it anywhere because unlike Nadal, Murray and Djokovic, criticizing Roger can be blasphemy in many areas of the tennis world. I also like to give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe i'm misreading him. In the mean time I still root for him on days like today and in future matches depending on the opponent, but he's not my favorite because I don't believe he's truly that nice behind the scenes."

This just goes to highlight the high standards of sportsmanship that has dominated tennis in recent years, and maybe years before that (I'm too young to speak for the years prior to the current big 4).

He comes off as very privileged and entitled and he is NOT gracious at all despite everyone jerking to him and making statements like he's the ambassador of sportsmanship on the tour. NO! A part of me used to think, well federer's native language isn't English and sometimes foreign people articulate things differently and as such humility, politeness, and feeling does not get conveyed. But no, time and again, Federer does not go out of his way to congratulate his peers when he could. I will say though he is not like this all the time. He has a good off court personality when he's doing exhibition events or interviews or talk show appearances, generally. But on the whole, he struggles with his hubris and it has always made me dislike him. Thank you for taking the time to illuminate a lot of people about the true Federer."

And how's he looking now that the biological passport is here?   I'm so sick of hearing about this turd. The guy is ranked 10th in the world, losing left and right, and people are still bringing him up every chance they get in the context of winning the next Grand Slam. His forehand isn't there this year, and unless he suddenly regains it somehow, he's not a legitimate threat to win any tournament above a 500.   And it baffles me that people blindly accept all the bullshit he pulls and believe his ""humble"" act. He's a fucking phony. His uncle is the epitome of a gambling sleazeball...you'll see him in the casino all the time, I'd be willing to bet (no pun intended). And that's the guy in his ear 24/7 since he was a kid. It's just fucking glaring. And you're worried about Federer being a little arrogant after every announcer under the sun called him ""perfect"" and ""above us mere mortals,"" etc.? Federer's a former long-haired hippie who couldn't help but absorb some of the press clippings and go along with the contrived ""suave"" image marketers turned him into.   He's won a bazillion annual sportsmanship awards, as voted on by his peers, and Nadal gets named every time a player has a dispute with an umpire over violating the rules because he's the most egregious of the rule-breakers."
tennis,3d21uu,TimRattayGotScrewed,6,Sun Jul 12 23:43:29 2015 UTC,"I dislike Nadal very much as Federer's opponent, but I appreciate all the great players. I think we as fans, myself included, worry too much for things that are not tennis. Like with Serena, people concern with her looks. I can only say What??.   They're all great players with different personalities. I am a diehard Fed fan, but I can find something to appreciate about his greatest rivals. Isn't that the best thing about tennis? One-on-one, man vs man."
tennis,3d21uu,Skyluz,-8,Mon Jul 13 00:54:23 2015 UTC,Nadal seems genuine because he struggles speaking English. It's easy to sound humble when your speaking a language your not comfortable with. He sounds very different in his Spanish interviews
tennis,3d21uu,TimRattayGotScrewed,-4,Mon Jul 13 02:51:58 2015 UTC,"According to the commentators for the match here in America, when Federer was asked, prior to the final, what he needed to do to win, Federer responded with ""believe.""  That's a pretty strong sign of respect for Djokovic if you ask me."
tennis,3d21uu,ArcaneNine,-16,Mon Jul 13 10:44:29 2015 UTC,"My impression of the players' personalities off the court:  Djokovic: A cocky frat bro dick. Bar-hopping, drinking, and picking up chicks in his spare time. Life's a college party to him.  Nadal: In with a dangerous crowd. His uncle is a casino-hopper in sun glasses...basically a gangsta. They won't think twice about performance-enhancement drugs.   Federer: Converted bong-smoking hippie who hangs with the Jamaicans. Closer to that when he's not having to play the ""suave"" character his management team came up with for him in 2005.  Murray: A GIANT dick on the court, probably not the friendliest person off the court.   Dimitrov: Douchebag.   Wawrinka: Doing illegal substances because he got sick (and jealous) of Federer getting all the attention and results. His excess power is not natural.  Roddick: Douchebro and a dick. Frat.  Raonic: Gay and in the closet. Not a bad guy.  Tsonga: Likes to party/drink but is more of a happy-go-lucky drunk. A little less douchey than the Djokovics of the world.  Isner: Likeable beer guzzler. He'll sit with you and watch football.  Kyrgios: Rebel and proud of it. More likable because he knows he's coming across as an asshole and is deliberately putting it on to make some sort of point, only he doesn't really know what that point is...he just wants to rebel."

Then I remembered that he's Russian, and to Russians, if you don't wind up in the hospital for alcohol poisoning every single night, you ""don't drink much."" I think Safin is pretty much in a drunken stupor full-time...and easily picks up the chicks at the bar with his looks and not having to say much. He smiles and says a few flirty things and it's back to his bed.  Hewitt: I think he ""matured"" after having kids. That basically killed the love/hate thing he had with Australia. He had too much fun playing with his kids. It distracted him from the fact that a ton of Aussies thought he was a giant prick and he wanted them to know that he hated them too.   Del Potro: Used to beat up kids and take their lunch money as the class bully. Now he sits in his room rocking out when he's not having another wrist surgery."

tennis,3d46ek,compuzr,6,Mon Jul 13 14:19:58 2015 UTC,Yeah Tennis Australia lost a lot of credibility because of that. Someone should be fired. I'm still confused as to what the drama is with Tomic and Tennis AUS.
tennis,3d46ek,sweetmatter,6,Mon Jul 13 22:19:04 2015 UTC,"They really, really don't like Bernard for some reason, most likely because his dad is a bit of a twat, and as such, they haven't really been supporting him. Making him pay for court hire, his own tennis balls etc. When he came out of surgery he got no call from TA to see how he was doing. They just generally don't give a fuck about him, and it's gotten worse since new kid on the block Nick Kyrgios came into town and they started focusing all their attention on him. That's just my take on it though."

Then he had to go and ruin all that good will with his attack on TA, but I can still understand his frustration. I guess bad reputations are hard to shake."

I talk to them all the time and catch a tourney when I can. He is still publicly trying to handle it a little better, all he has to do is not get arrested, pretty low bar he's got there. Behind the curtain he's not very well liked."

EDIT: I love a downvote as much as the next guy, but what is he suing for? Shouldn't the tournament be suing? Why is it specific to Tomic and not the other Australian involved in the match too? Much ado about nothing."
tennis,3d46ek,TacticalTennis,6,Mon Jul 13 15:57:16 2015 UTC,I don't think he can afford the lawyer to be honest with you.
tennis,3d46ek,Bamkill,-2,Mon Jul 13 16:16:46 2015 UTC,"No, he's not a twat. I've met him a few times and done scouting for a couple of his pro matches for him. My best friend is coaching him at the moment - just got him through qualies to main draw at Wimbledon. He's a cool guy."
tennis,3d46ek,TacticalTennis,2,Mon Jul 13 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't the tournament be suing? Why is it specific to Tomic and not the other Australian involved in the match too?   Is there really any confusion here? Let's say we all agree that this was no typo. In that case, it was intentional, and there's only one party involved that Tennis Austraia would like to take a shot at.   I do understand that firing off a lawsuit (although the article actually only says that John Tomic has referred it to a lawyer) is a bit of a twat move. It only makes sense to me because this is a professional athlete we're talking about, and their image is valuable. OTOH, Bernard has self-destructed his own image already, so an argument could be made that this is all pointless.  In the end, maybe we can all agree no one is winning when the two sides are taking pot shots at each other like this."
tennis,3d46ek,compuzr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"The thing to me is, I struggle to think what Tennis Australia would possibly have to gain by intentionally doing that. It's an insult to the tournament, not to Tomic, and given they can give a wildcards to Aussie players it would just be stupid of them to slap the tournament organizers in the face on purpose.  The situation being what it is, they could simply call Tomic's behavior shameful and do so with a straight face. They have no need to resort to petty things like that.  Granted I could be wrong - maybe they really are that childish."
tennis,3d46ek,TacticalTennis,2,Tue Jul 14 01:49:22 2015 UTC,"Having actually read the article now, which I should've but didn't do before my first comment, it seems like it was just a press release email that was very quickly back-tracked. In other words, it could have been a staffer going rogue for a moment.   IOW, (a) this probably wasn't done by high-level TA staff and (b) John Tomic is not actually suing (yet). Speaking for myself, I was a bit suckered by the headline."

tennis,3d6tou,TacticalTennis,3,Tue Jul 14 02:03:45 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Federer took their match at Roland Garros and Djokovic took the US Open after being down two sets so there's a passing the torch moment and there's a balance there with both winning a match.

tennis,3d0sar,SHIELDagent,4,Sun Jul 12 16:59:46 2015 UTC,Wimbledon tickets are that costly? 15000 pounds? OH EM GEE
tennis,3d0sar,SafinisGOAT,22,Sun Jul 12 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"Depends what you're going for. If you're going to get tickets in the queue (like I did this year), you can get tickets for good value. For example this year I went for the Quarters and got Court One so I paid £90 to see Fed v Simon and the Wawrinka-Gasquet 5-setter. Pretty good stuff (I think Centre was £120 on that day).  Debenture tickets are around £15000 because they give you access to all the matches in Wimbledon over the two weeks; they give you two tickets so you can bring someone along. The advantage also is that you can resell your tickets at higher than face value for desperate customers and make a decent profit. It basically reserves you seats on Centre while also giving someone else a chance to go.  The other option is applying for the ballot, where you set your preferences for what matches you want to see and how many tickets you need. Based on a lottery structure, you could either be: unsuccessful, successful but get something you might not prefer, or get your preferred match/court. Those are charged at standard price. I think tickets to the final go at like £300 for those."

tennis,3d269v,FruitySploosh,5,Mon Jul 13 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"I can't fathom why so many people don't like Djokovic but love...say..Serena Williams? They both have great personalities, crack jokes on the court and with reporters, and show raw emotion. Sure they argue with chair umps a lot, but that's part of the fun.  Federer is one of the greatest tennis players we may ever witness, but his personality is boring to me. This is why I've always loved Djoker and will always root for him not matter who he's playing. Well.....unless Roddick comes out of retirement."
tennis,3d269v,cougasaurus,2,Mon Jul 13 15:48:35 2015 UTC,"Who can contest Djokovic at this point? His only competition is Federer who is old and inconsistent, Murray who is the same, and the other up and comers who have flashes of brilliance (Stan, Berydch, Cilic, etc). Nadal seems to be on his way out too.  I can see Djokovic dominating for another 4-5 years easily. The younger talent just isn't there yet."
tennis,3d269v,thederpmeister,10,Mon Jul 13 13:09:01 2015 UTC,"I've never disliked him, he's just less fun for me to watch than some other players, so I cheer for them instead of him. He doesn't have a lot of the flair that crowds respond to, for better or worse.   Side note: Nobody is ever going to get a lot of cheers when they're playing against Roger (unless you're Andy Murray during the 2012 Olympics)."
tennis,3d269v,Lemurians,13,Mon Jul 13 03:46:06 2015 UTC,While Novak might not have as many 'flair shots' as some of the other players I will always find him entertaining to watch with regard to the incredible athleticism and flexibility he displays when moving around the court. I personally don't understand how he doesn't break his ankles on some of those sliding return shots!
tennis,3d269v,MissingLink101,-7,Mon Jul 13 09:11:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, rooting for Djokovic is like rooting for a brick wall. I'd much rather root for the guy trying to hit trick shots through the only, tennis ball sized hole, in that wall."
tennis,3d269v,jeffwingersballs,5,Mon Jul 13 04:19:34 2015 UTC,"You're right, he wins because it's hard to get a ball past him. With him you have to hit two winners. Roger played very well yesterday, but how many shots that were winners against every other opponent came back over he net. Novak makes the windows impossibly small."

tennis,3d269v,TenNes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:48:13 2015 UTC,"Often times we'll watch Djo play against anyone and when he's at his best, he's not noticeable at all until the set ends and it's 6-2. Your like WTF, how the heck did this guy just win.  I think the 'dislike' for djo is a fundamental reason because of human nature. He plays a extremely even game. Literally like a mirror. Perfectly / deceptively balanced. So balanced, that you can't even admire the force he exerts. Djo has to constantly remind the audience how awesome of a point he just played. It's not his fault, it's just his style. It's a mirror and who likes looking at a mirror for 2-3 hours, so we end up watching the other person more and completely forget about him. Until it's 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 and your like WTF, how did he just win."
tennis,3d269v,kydjester,-12,Tue Jul 14 16:28:49 2015 UTC,"I personally don't like him because during the match he doesn't seem very sportsmanlike.  He has gotten tamer over the years but it's still noticeably there.  He has a visible cockiness to him that rubs me the wrong way.  If he kept it to himself and didn't show it during the match, I might have made him my number 2 man behind Roger."
tennis,3d269v,avaliantheel,35,Mon Jul 13 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"And federer doesn't? Open your eyes mate.  Please have a look at one of Roger's ample press conferences, especially after losing.

tennis,3d269v,bicureyooz,-9,Mon Jul 13 06:21:38 2015 UTC,"There are also lots of situations where he is complaining about the most minor things, when the match is not going in his favor. I rememeber when he played Dolgopolov earlier this year and he was visibly annoyed, when Dolgopolov hit the net cord and was generally playing well.  It's easy to be the ""generous sportsman"" when you are winning."

Nobody actually acknowledges that Novak dominates the sport when nobody is really capable of stopping him.  EDIT: Please don't give me the 17>14>9 argument. Rafa is a freak of nature on clay, and pretty much clay only so I wouldn't compare him to Novak or Fed, and Fed's competition wasn't as tough back in the day as Novak's is now. Just my two cents."
tennis,3d0x8y,egn56,48,Sun Jul 12 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"Recency bias is strong here. At the moment the biggest threat to Novak are two 30+ Swiss men. One who can't string two good tournaments together.  It's easy to spin it to say nobody has good competition when they are dominating because of exactly that.  That being said the Fed bias is a bit strong, but Fed is a huge credit for reviving the sport and brining it to a huge international level. Hence the following."
tennis,3d0x8y,fuzzyfeels,22,Sun Jul 12 16:47:16 2015 UTC,Novak's actually in a very similar era to Federer's 'weak' era. You've got an Andy who's your bitch. You've got a gassed 34 year old and everybody else is completely out of sorts regarding consistency.

That one year he went on his streak until the French was ridiculous. I don't think anyone here, regardless how much they like Federer disagrees about how dominant Novak is."

tennis,3d0x8y,UncleWittgenstein,3,Sun Jul 12 17:02:52 2015 UTC,"Rafa is a freak of nature on clay, and pretty much clay only    You do know that if you remove their respective favorite slams (RG for Rafa and AO for Novak), Rafa still has more slams, right? He also has a career golden slam. So, I'm not sure why you think he's only good on clay. It's only been 2 years since he dominated the NA hardcourt season."
tennis,3d0x8y,krazytennis98,32,Sun Jul 12 16:48:05 2015 UTC,He has virtually no competition apart from a 33 year old Federer and a crippled Nadal.

tennis,3d0x8y,ChaoticMidget,23,Sun Jul 12 16:38:37 2015 UTC,Stan the unpredictable man
tennis,3d0x8y,Personacorona,12,Sun Jul 12 16:44:42 2015 UTC,But Federer winning 5 wimbledons and us opens isn't a lack of relative strength? Everyone always makes this excuse that Djokovic doesn't have any competition but Federer winning 10 out of 14 titles is just him going super saiyan against world beaters? This isn't even to discredit federer. A major is a major though.
tennis,3d0x8y,Sir_Psycho_Sexy_,11,Sun Jul 12 17:36:51 2015 UTC,Murray is playing some of the best tennis of his life and Federer is playing pretty well. And let's not forget Stan.
tennis,3d0x8y,imahippocampus,6,Sun Jul 12 17:10:22 2015 UTC,"Murray  and Wawrinka, both beating him in GS finals"
tennis,3d0x8y,WeoWeoSimon,3,Sun Jul 12 17:08:41 2015 UTC,I think people respect Novak and accept that he is the best. They just don't love him. You can't blame people for supporting the player they'd rather see win.
tennis,3d0x8y,gg_2015,12,Sun Jul 12 16:47:57 2015 UTC,"Uhh what happened to last French Open then? Federer's form from the Murray match would have proved a much closer competition. I fully acknowledge that Federer just can't match Djokovic's baseline consistency, but I definitely think that Djokovic isn't unstoppable."
tennis,3d0x8y,gg_2015,9,Sun Jul 12 16:54:00 2015 UTC,"No player is unstoppable. Obviously the best players dominates the majors, like Federer, Nadal, Djokovic have been. Consistently. That's why they are regarded the way they are. But no one will dismiss any players in the top 100. We've seen guys like Wawrinka, Del Potro, Berdych, Ferrer have the game to trouble the Big Three.  Heck, for years Nadal has always struggled in the hard courts (perhaps outside clay in general). Federer lost less than 5 matches at his absolute peak in 04-06, but we can't seriously compare how great the competition is 10 years later. Djokovic has accumulated a lot of majors in this golden age of men's tennis.  There are lapses for Djokovic in those majors, but in general, he is rock solid and cool under pressure. He finally won more than one major in a year for the 2nd time, and he still has 2 yrs ('16, '17) before that roadblock of age 30. He should be 2-3 away (if not less) from Nadal by Wimbledon 2017."
tennis,3d0x8y,SwissBliss,7,Sun Jul 12 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"Fed is loved universally and unconditionally, a status that he's earned and deserved. But Djokovic is also universally considered the best player on tour right now, and has been since 2011 (except a couple down months after). That really is not for debate. Sure, it's head-scratching how he's managed to lose to guys like Nishikori and Wawrinka, but he's been pretty consistently dominant in general.  There's some things to appreciate about Nadal's game, but I've grown fonder of Djokovic's every time I watch him. Federer has plenty more to give for us spoiled fans, but this is Djokovic's playground now."
tennis,3d0x8y,rab7,15,Sun Jul 12 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"Fed's competition wasn't as tough back in the day as Novak's is now   Right cause Novak is playing Nadal and Fed at their primes lol. Of course Djoko is dominating and is extremely good, but don't use that bs argument."
tennis,3d0x8y,jeffwingersballs,4,Sun Jul 12 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"I think djokovic is the best right now,  and at this pace he has enough time to get more than Nadal if Nadal never wins another.  The reason I Root for Federer is because I spent a big part of my childhood and teen years rooting against him because I loved Roddick. Now that I'm older I can finally appreciate federer for what he is, and want to see him win at least another slam before he leaves forever"
tennis,3d0x8y,Cosmic_Colin,2,Sun Jul 12 16:50:46 2015 UTC,Clay only? Did you watch the 2013 US Open?
tennis,3d0x8y,mdb_la,2,Sun Jul 12 16:45:06 2015 UTC,"Peak Fed would have destroyed Novak, especially on grass and other fast surfaces. Djokovic is lucky that his competition consists of a past-prime Fedal, inconsistent Stan and Murray."
tennis,3d0x8y,bustedracquet,30,Sun Jul 12 16:59:46 2015 UTC,It was really impressive that Djokovic raised his game after blowing those chances in the 2nd. I think Roger wasn't expecting that.
tennis,3d0x8y,staptiudupe,30,Sun Jul 12 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"I just don't get why so many people were expecting him to win. Novak's 48-2 this year...  EDIT: 48-3 I guess with the loss to Karlovic, although that was the first tournament of the year played on like January 2nd or something."
tennis,3d0x8y,bustedracquet,18,Sun Jul 12 16:32:36 2015 UTC,Must have something to do with the way he totally dominated Murray in the SF.
tennis,3d0x8y,staptiudupe,17,Sun Jul 12 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"So? Novak Djokovic is a much better player than Andy Murray. He's Murray on steroids, he can do everything that Andy can, and he does it better."
tennis,3d0x8y,rhcp6131,11,Sun Jul 12 16:41:52 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you, but no one predicted Murray getting such a shellacking. Djokovic matches up well with Federer and we saw that today."
tennis,3d0x8y,backjacker,10,Sun Jul 12 16:45:44 2015 UTC,He can't lob apparently.
tennis,3d0x8y,Kashmir33,23,Sun Jul 12 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"I rooted for Fed because of just how well he was playing in previous matches.   Fed blew waaaaaaay too many chances to break and committed waaaaaaaay too many unforced errors, imo."
tennis,3d0x8y,Zankman,6,Sun Jul 12 17:00:48 2015 UTC,Because he had an objectively worse tournament and Federer seemed to have played better with every match. That semifinal win over another top 4 player who was playing great tennis was nothing short of astonishing.
tennis,3d0x8y,MoreDblRainbows,5,Sun Jul 12 16:38:32 2015 UTC,Most*. Loads of us are quite happy. :D  Or are you referring to the underwhelming finish?
tennis,3d0x8y,TheEclectic,54,Sun Jul 12 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"Djokovic is the first great player I can say I've seen/followed growing up and mature into the force he is today. From all the early ""attitude"" and fitness issues and then people wondering if he was going to be a one slam wonder to sheer dominance Its really cool/weird to watch a career develop."
tennis,3d0x8y,mhaydar,14,Sun Jul 12 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Me too! Started following him in 07. Always thought he had so much talent, but his head seemed to get in the way. Was SOOOO happy when he put it together in 2011. I used to be a bigger Rafa fan, but just growing with Nole feeling the ups and downs and now seeing him fulfill his talent has been so satisfying! I'm so happy for him and I really hope he approaches Roger and Rafa in the slam count. The man should really have 4-6 more slams than he does right now. He's let a lot of really good opportunities slip. I'm astounded he hasn't won the USOpen more. He's been the best hard court player for the last 5-6 years."
tennis,3d0x8y,kabajingai,46,Sun Jul 12 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"Ah Novak, wearing that one coloured tracksuit is the most eastern European thing you can do."

Although I think all my worrying about Fed after that second set has raised my blood pressure to dangerous levels.
tennis,3d0x8y,TheIntersect,16,Sun Jul 12 17:19:12 2015 UTC,"Yes it did, prob me as well. Djokovic was a bad loss to Wawrinka away from the best start in men's tennis history. I'm all for watching history in the making, and I'm sort of pissed at Wawrinka for ruining that. The emotional win vs Nadal and then the dragged out semi vs Murray took a toll.  Congrats to Djokovic. He really should have double digits GS by now, but no doubt that he will soon. There's more coming in the future. Thanks to both Djokovic and Federer for giving us the most memorables matches in the last decade."

Better player on the day won without a doubt, just frustrating it was Fed's worst performance of the tournament and the last two sets fizzled out thanks to handed over breaks early on. Thought Djokovic was solid but relatively unspectacular until the final set, but it was all he needed to be today. Served well, put himself in a position to capitalise on the errors he was getting."

tennis,3d0x8y,Forzelius,8,Sun Jul 12 16:31:04 2015 UTC,Aww nah that was sad when Federer walked past just then
tennis,3d0x8y,xulander,7,Sun Jul 12 16:34:42 2015 UTC,"What hurts the most for me is that previously, post 2012 Wimby triumph, on all those SF exits and post 2014 5-setter heartbreak, I could always argue, that Fed wasn't perfect on the tournament, that he still has one twilight form of his life tourney in him, that he can rise to the occasion by 2007ing himself all the way to the trophy. But this time he was as good as he could be. His serve was awesome, he was keeping the games short. He did everything right. Until the final. I'm writing it down to the nerves, but before the final, there was nothing he could've done better. And what's worse, Novak didn't have the best tournament he's ever had. On his worst surface. I mean, all those things combined - the best ever on grass being on the form of his 30's career life against one of the best ever not on the form of his life on the weakest surface - and it leaves you just...sad."
tennis,3d0x8y,pfc_bgd,27,Sun Jul 12 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"Djokovic played awesomely - definitely deserves the title of best returner in the world and possibly best ever  But the amount of unforced errors by Federer really killed him this match; he made more forehand unforced errors than he did all unforced errors against Murray...  edit: I've also never seen him look so fatigued in a match, it was the first time this tournament he really looked his age...not sure if Federer will be so successful in best of 5 match tournaments from now on"
tennis,3d0x8y,rain_slave,6,Sun Jul 12 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"playing against Djokovic makes you go for more, makes you try to hit closer to the line, makes you hit with more pace, and, in all likelihood, makes you make mistakes because of it. It's brutal trying to put the ball behind him."

This win was well-deserved for Nole- he showed a lot of grit to get through the Anderson match, and he was clearly the better player today. In my opinion, I still believe that Roger at his best level is untouchable though.   What an era of tennis we live in."
tennis,3d0x8y,mhaydar,8,Sun Jul 12 16:31:18 2015 UTC,"After hearing the applause Djokovic got, it seemed everyone came for a Fed victory. I wonder what it would have sounded like if Fed had won."

Murray let Fed get comfortable early on by refusing to attack more. Nole lost a lot at net initially, but didn't relent.   Also, Novak puts so much pressure on you throughout the match tht there's no way Fed could just get into rhythm like he did in the semis. This match was all about Novak and what he did, rather than Fed and what he didn't do."
tennis,3d0x8y,rebelaessedai,14,Sun Jul 12 17:15:13 2015 UTC,"Every sports sub I sub to I've noticed picks their darlings and is largely reactionary in terms of what they think will happen or their predictions for the future. Fed smashes Murray and suddenly everyone on here is talkign about how Novak ""might have a chance to win if it goes to 5 sets"". Lol. It's irritating because the many out-vote the few and nonsense gets upvoted all the time. It's fine for a majority to think Federer will win, or to like him more, but it's all the other crap they try to throw in to make it seem like their opinion is based on some objectivity rather than simply being fans that makes it annoying to read."
tennis,3d0x8y,Jzrt10,7,Sun Jul 12 17:00:09 2015 UTC,"As a Djokovic fan, I agree... as a sports fan, I agree too... but as a tennis fan, I can understand at least some of the Federer worship.   I just showed my roommate a clip of the 2009 (?) semifinal tweener Fed had against Djokovic. My roommate's response was ""that's a fluke"", and then I showed him the 4:30 video of all of his successful tweeners- and there were a lot.  In my opinion, prime Djokovic could beat prime Federer- but it'd be a toss-up. Djokovic's return and baseline game is the best in the sport, but Federer is so consistent on every single shot it seems nearly impossible.   I'm happy to be able to witness it, all of it. I eat it up."

tennis,3d0x8y,Kishara,6,Sun Jul 12 16:32:05 2015 UTC,"Federer faded slightly and Djokovic held strong. In the end, Djokovic's stellar returns, speedy defense, clutch serving, and consistent play disrupted Federer's serving rhythm, which carried over to the rest of his game. Fed's serve started missing when he needed it most, and the opportunities that Roger had, he didn't take full advantage of. Full credit and a well deserved accolade to Novak for his incredible overall performance cementing himself as the world number 1 and a great champion.  In nearly 3 hours, Novak won 10 more points over the course of 286. The margins in tennis are incredibly slim. What a fantastic sport."

tennis,3d0x8y,gulppulp,21,Sun Jul 12 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"Lol at something like 65% of /r/tennis predicting a Fed win, with like 40% of that being Fed in 4. Any neutral observer knew that Nole was a huge favorite."
tennis,3d0x8y,HommJohnny,10,Sun Jul 12 17:44:43 2015 UTC,Heart breaking moment for Roger.  Djoker is a freak of nature. Thoroughly deserved
tennis,3d0x8y,Rafa_Nadals_Eyebrow,14,Sun Jul 12 16:36:50 2015 UTC,"Federer is #2 in the world, it's just that Djokovic is his kryptonite, yet people are still calling for him to retire, or ""it's over""... Roger just beat Murray this friday, that doesn't mean Murray should retire this second. Congrats to Novak though!"
tennis,3d0x8y,14Deadsouls,14,Sun Jul 12 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"Classically matchup-wise, Nole Rafa and Roger have all been each other's kryptonites.   Rafa > Fed  Nole > Rafa  Fed > Nole  It's just that over the past few years Nole has taken his game to a completely different level."
tennis,3d0x8y,KaiserHunger,6,Sun Jul 12 16:29:24 2015 UTC,it's just that Djokovic is his kryptonite   I think it's more to do with the difference in age between them. If anyone was Roger's kryptonite it's definitely Rafa.

tennis,3d0x8y,modernzen,6,Sun Jul 12 17:01:24 2015 UTC,"One of the greatest displays of returning I've ever seen. That last game was a perfect return game, he put 3 of them right on the baseline and ripped that one cross court forehand winner."
tennis,3d0x8y,alj8,5,Sun Jul 12 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"I need to stop rooting for people so I don't feel so depressed when they lose. Djokovic at the French, now Federer here. At least the winners are playing the matches of their lives."

tennis,3d0x8y,Gumpster07,4,Sun Jul 12 16:32:34 2015 UTC,"I often wonder this. How much easier if watch the game if Djokovic didn't play as a Serbian but then I just realize how much he has done for our country and that's it totally worth the sleepless nights, early mornings, losses."
tennis,3d0x8y,Nickp1991,5,Sun Jul 12 16:56:32 2015 UTC,"That was an incredible final.  I said the other day, if Federer played like he did against Murray, then he would swiftly dispose of Nole. The first two sets were incredibly even, the last two saw Nole do what Fed did to Murray, pressure the server, and then close up shop on their own serve. It is a testament to Nole, when he went through heartbreak at RG, he has come out at Wimbledon, looked superb and capped it by beating the GOAT.  Well deserved win for Nole. Great stuff, and some really epic tennis on show."
tennis,3d0x8y,MoreDblRainbows,4,Sun Jul 12 18:10:50 2015 UTC,Andy Roddick is such a good analyst Loved him as a player
tennis,3d0x8y,BoeZaah_,2,Sun Jul 12 17:06:56 2015 UTC,I loved him in the beginning of his career and then started disliking him after he US open win (I think because the US media overhyped him so much in comparison to Federer) then loved him again as the underdog. He's always been a great character though.

tennis,3d0x8y,smoledman,7,Sun Jul 12 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"One of the dynamics people aren't talking about with this match is the cross-court forehand exchanges: Djokovic hit them very very deep, and Federer's running forehand missed almost every time.  I've never seen Federer's running forehand worse than today—he plays that shot better against del Potro, even.  Crucial element of today's match.  Oh, and not coming to the net on break point opportunities."
tennis,3d0x8y,mhaydar,2,Sun Jul 12 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"The Federer decline in ground strokes is so severe right now as to be critical. If he can't fix it shortly, he's done."

tennis,3d0x8y,Wijnruit,5,Sun Jul 12 16:57:08 2015 UTC,Wimbledon just has astonishingly good tradition doesn't it.   How much more laid back is Novak when he's not on the court. Get the warmth from the public he deserves here.

tennis,3d0x8y,h00dman,9,Sun Jul 12 17:11:37 2015 UTC,This year is the first year Djok has made 3 Slam finals in a row. He's probably going to do it at the U.S.
tennis,3d0x8y,iampueroo,9,Sun Jul 12 20:08:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's depressing.  Seeing Roger get to the final and push Novak to 5 sets last year was a lovely surprise, but this year, after seeing what he did to a really good Murray in the semi final, I can't help but be disappointed to see him lose in 4.  FFS why couldn't Novak do this to Wawrinka in the French when I was actually rooting for him?"
tennis,3d0x8y,EllenTyrell,10,Sun Jul 12 20:17:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly Novak's returning was unreal. Half the time (especially in the last set) Federer found himself trying hit shots from his feet a second after serving.  Well deserved for Novak, good job mate."
tennis,3d0x8y,PeterG92,8,Sun Jul 12 16:31:11 2015 UTC,"Let's face it guys. Novak, the tennis machine, was the better player today. Not going to make me accept Roger's defeat easier though."

tennis,3d0x8y,Forzelius,3,Sun Jul 12 16:41:37 2015 UTC,Congratulations to Djokovic. The last 2 sets went over so fast
tennis,3d0x8y,rafessi,4,Sun Jul 12 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"Well that's it then. Novak deserved to win. Sadly, when he had a great tourney like this and still didn't win it the 18th will have to come down to rivals getting injuries or losing in 4th round to the likes of Tsonga, Monfils. Federer won't win another slam without some help or luck now. I'm devastated. Cheers other RF fans and congrats to Novak and his fans. Masterful display and there is a reason while he is the best in the world by a landslide for a few years now."
tennis,3d0x8y,Gumpster07,2,Sun Jul 12 16:31:39 2015 UTC,"Well deserved victory, not the classic of last year but the first 2 sets were quality, but Djokovic just had too much for him in the end  He's just head and shoulders above any other player at the moment and this is shaping up to be a repeat of 2011."
tennis,3d0x8y,escherbach,5,Sun Jul 12 16:31:59 2015 UTC,"As a side note, I saw BBC Sport tweet something earlier.  Congrats to Nole for his 200th GS match win, which takes him in a good club."
tennis,3d0x8y,bustedracquet,2,Sun Jul 12 16:32:16 2015 UTC,"Federer just seemed to have nothing left after that amazing second set tie break. In the end Novak won that quite comfortably, but the first two sets were high quality.  I would have loved to see if Djokovic could beat Federer playing at the same level he did in the Semi-Final. He's a deserving champion though, congratulations Djokovic."

tennis,3d0x8y,smss28,9,Sun Jul 12 17:12:29 2015 UTC,Crowd doesn't neccessarily have to cater to the 'best' player though do they? Whoever they like more they cheer for more. It's pretty simple logic.
tennis,3d0x8y,tinkafoo,4,Sun Jul 12 17:14:29 2015 UTC,I think that's exactly what (s)he is pointing out.
tennis,3d0x8y,bustedracquet,6,Sun Jul 12 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"That was some staggering ""immovable object vs unstoppable force"" tennis, on par with the Federer-Murray match."
tennis,3d0x8y,scrumpylungs,8,Sun Jul 12 16:58:09 2015 UTC,"This match and victory for Novak was the difference between this year being like the last 3 (multiple Slam finals, and only 1 win) and 2011, where he was just dominant when he won 3 Slams and compiled a 26-1 record in Slams. This year, Novak is trending towards the path of 2011, 2 Slams, 4 Masters 1000 title, and unquestionably, the best player in the world and one of the Top 5 players all-time for sure in the modern era (post-Laver)."
tennis,3d0x8y,xXxWeed_Wizard420xXx,3,Sun Jul 12 18:24:57 2015 UTC,Not the classic that the 2nd set tiebreaker made it look like it was shaping up to be. Still a decent final though and a great champion.

tennis,3d0x8y,AJT217,3,Sun Jul 12 16:53:34 2015 UTC,Novak's level on the baseline is insane and he knows it. Big mental edge to have when you know you can rely on putting the ball back(helps that his return is insane too) into play and hitting 5 cm from the baseline until your opponent cracks.
tennis,3d0x8y,JadedMuse,13,Sun Jul 12 16:59:10 2015 UTC,Today is a good day.
tennis,3d0x8y,imahippocampus,5,Sun Jul 12 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"As a direhard Fed fan, I'm not completely gutted at this loss. It was encouraging to see Federer hit with substantially more pace. I think he understands that more pace is going to be needed if he's going to compete with Nole. Hopefully a sign of things to come."
tennis,3d0x8y,ishgever,2,Sun Jul 12 17:00:15 2015 UTC,"I mean obviously he didn't play as well as he needed to, and at points he was just bad. But on the other hand, his overall form has been really encouraging this tournament. I just hope he can keep the fire alive for one more year. One more slam win, the Olympics, and I think he'd be done.   Yes I know it's a tall order but he really is still in impressive form much of the time."
tennis,3d0x8y,superfuels,12,Sun Jul 12 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"First set: close, but Federer was slightly better...and lost.   Second set: close, but Novak was better...and lost.   Third set: Novak far, far, far better.  Fourth set: Novak far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far better.   Overall, not an extremely entertaining match, and not one that will likely be remembered as such.   Congrats to the winner and bad luck to the runner-up."
tennis,3d0x8y,Kinon05,4,Sun Jul 12 16:31:42 2015 UTC,"Bad luck to the runner up? Sure he gave up 2 set points in the first and lost it, but he also saved 6 in the 2nd and ended up winning, this wasn't about luck. Nole was thoroughly better."
tennis,3d0x8y,weheardyou,6,Sun Jul 12 16:46:32 2015 UTC,"Djokovic was a wall this match. He totally deserved the win. On the other hand, Federer, at 34, showed he can still push the world number 1 to his limits."
tennis,3d0x8y,EllenTyrell,6,Sun Jul 12 16:52:39 2015 UTC,Roger all class as usual some of his fans here could learn a thing from it.
tennis,3d0x8y,Nickp1991,5,Sun Jul 12 17:55:20 2015 UTC,Roger's voice is so velvety. Can't help but to swoon over that.

tennis,3d0x8y,bumbleb333,7,Sun Jul 12 16:51:54 2015 UTC,"Before the match people were favoring Federer hard even so called experts said he is bound for 18th GS.Tried to totally diminish great form of Djokovic who in my opinion lost RG mostly due not having a break and match postpone in semi finals.  Federer played this tournament at his best,just look at the stats and semi final vs Murray he can demolish anyone else aside Djokovic who is simply better.Competition just got harder from his golden days and Djokovic deserves all the glory stop underrating him"
tennis,3d0x8y,leqt321,3,Sun Jul 12 16:56:35 2015 UTC,"Competition just got harder from his golden days   I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say MAYBE it's harder for federer to compete as a 34 year old than as a 25 year old. federer was far from his best. his performance against murray was overrated, murray was just passive and terrible"

tennis,3d0x8y,Forzelius,2,Sun Jul 12 16:34:42 2015 UTC,Congrats to Djokovic. He never let up. Federer definitely played better in the semi though.
tennis,3d0x8y,Nickp1991,2,Sun Jul 12 16:37:45 2015 UTC,"Novak didn't let Roger play his game today at all. Barely coming to the net. 1st serve was not as good, not even close to the Murray game. Fatigue, nerves. It really sucks. Winning the 2nd serve and giving an early break away. Life can be so cruel sometimes. Fed's slamhunt is really on the ropes now. I feel like I feel when England loses a major tournament with penalties. Always rooting for them yet something always goes wrong. I think a long abscence from reddit is in order now."

tennis,3d7cfa,whatwhatinthebuttnow,18,Tue Jul 14 02:17:35 2015 UTC,"In short, tennis is fucking hard, crosscourt shots cross the lowest point of the net (The net is higher on the sides) and use the longest part of the court so there's more room for error."

tennis,3d7cfa,vlee89,-6,Tue Jul 14 03:52:38 2015 UTC,Larry was wrong and he should feel bad about spreading misinformation about the character of tennis professionals.
tennis,3d7cfa,spockywocky,8,Tue Jul 14 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"Because what they're doing out there is harder than it looks.    Cross court shots go over the lowest part of the net, so it's the safest play you have when you're not in a great position to hit aggressive shots down the lines.  With how hard shots are hit and the momentum that goes behind them, it's a lot harder to change the direction of the ball than it looks. If a shot comes at you hard cross-court, it's really difficult to change the direction of it and take it up the line with any control or pace. That's why commentators frequently talk about how great Murray and Djokovic are and re-directing the ball. Because it's a skill."
tennis,3d7cfa,Lemurians,7,Tue Jul 14 03:07:47 2015 UTC,"If you change directions on a cross court shot to DTL and it's not a quality shot, your opponent gets to rip a cross court shot (note that cross court is high percentage) into the open court fucking your position in the point."
tennis,3d7cfa,vlee89,3,Tue Jul 14 03:55:19 2015 UTC,"yeah why don't they just hit winners with every shot, clearly they aren't trying enough."
tennis,3d7cfa,fascta,2,Tue Jul 14 02:45:46 2015 UTC,In doubles it's the smart play. In singles usually to try and get the ball into the feet of the server. But it's kinda hard to do when the ball moves 130+ with spin and altitude. Think about the impact point on the court. John Isner's is near the service t around 10ft in the air.
tennis,3d7cfa,BaronVonHasselhoff,2,Tue Jul 14 02:35:32 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to return in tennis is in the same direction (or something of the sort, I've forgotten where I heard this one)"
tennis,3d7cfa,zerohour88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:41:44 2015 UTC,"You should Google ""wardlaw's directionals"" - it's a theory about where each shot should go based on playing higher percentage shots and when it's easier to change direction."
tennis,3d7cfa,poo_head,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:48:47 2015 UTC,"Tennis players have to make trade offs.  The game is still one of errors.  As others have noted, to switch directions means increasing the risk to yourself (to miss, either wide or into the net), while allowing your opponent a chance to run it down and hit the safer shot (typically back crosscourt).  With players hitting very hard, it's dangerous to switch directions if it causes the resulting ball to be hit softly.  You could say ""A pro should be able to hit every ball hard and accurate"", but that's not true.  There are many sports where the opponents don't cause an immediate pressure from the ball itself.  For example, in basketball, one team controls the ball, and the best the other team can do is block or steal.  They can't themselves throw the ball as hard as they can to your team and force your team to react."
tennis,3d33x3,MetalKeirSolid,17,Mon Jul 13 03:30:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I fucking love him.  I love his two-handed backhands, this chips, his lobs [not effective vs Federer], and his court speed. I love the way he slides, and most importantly, the way he falls and always gets back up. This is literally it right there. Determination. I have so much respect for his rise to success, and the way he wins."

I also find it had to understand how he doesn't have more injuries considering the way he abuses his ankles when sliding around...
tennis,3d33x3,Compulsive1,6,Mon Jul 13 09:22:35 2015 UTC,"It's just brutal that outside Melbourne, Djokovic gets hammered and berated by the crowd all the time. Calls during his serve, jeering his winners, celebrating his errors.   Fans and most of the media have made him look like he killed Bambi's mother when he defeats Murray, Nadal, or Federer. It's not justified. Just because he's come across to challenge the two most popular players of all time doesn't make him a bad man. Hell, I'm a huge Novak fan, but I still admire Nadal for what he brings to the sport. I hope he gets back to his best, as tennis isn't the same without him.  Novak is a 9 time champion who's been part of every match-of-the-year in the past few years, yet he gets no love from the crowd. You don't have to like him, but you shouldn't shower him with abuse either. It's not fair."

tennis,3d19kp,jeffwingersballs,6,Sun Jul 12 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"When Nadal has fresh legs, he can beat anyone, but as we know, that is inconsistently the case. This frames the question on who is the best. Do you value consistency or flashes of brilliance?"
tennis,3d19kp,Fallout99,7,Sun Jul 12 23:58:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry for my poor Excel skills! I hope I inspired someone to do a better job and of the years previously. I also counted the ATP Finals as a Masters to make it easier. My analysis:    Federer in today's post-match interview said that Djokovic has been the best player for the past few years, this confirms it Also confirms Nadal's inconsistency/injuries/hot streaks, and Federer's decline since 2012 2012 because that was his last year at no.1 Since the clay season last year, Nadal has won nothing significant Despite only winning 2 masters in the last three seasons (and a few 500/250's), Federer is no. 2, which makes me question the strength of the rest of the field Regardless of the US open, Djokovic is repeating 2011 this year, but 2011 was more out of his own brilliance, and this year is more because there is really no one to challenge him on a consistent basis   This will be an interesting finish to the year, and I think it will be Djokovic's entirely, barring upsets. But I also think this will be his last ""domination year."" The popular opinion is that he will win 2-3 GS a year till he's 30, but people underestimate what it takes to repeat great years consecutively, let alone 3 years in a row. While 2012-2014 were really really good, they were not what 2011 and 2015 are.  Moreover, I think we are witnessing a lull in the rest of the field as the younger players take more time to mature and Fed/Nadal enter the last stages of their careers.  Nadal's 14 will be intact -- he could possibly win one more -- Federer still the GOAT (sorry I had to), chasing the elusive 18th and Olympic Gold."
tennis,3d19kp,PokeMyPillow,8,Sun Jul 12 18:42:49 2015 UTC,"I haven't been following tennis as much recently but who are the next up and comers?  Seems like Murray is never going to make that next level, already getting old. And after that I don't recognize many names."

There aren't any real next up and comers except Coric, Kyrgios, and any other under 20 yr old player in the top 100.

tennis,3d19kp,winabean7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:13:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure Kyrgios has the heart to win a major. The best fans of him can hope for is for him to fall into a Wimbledon final as the current top players get older.
tennis,3d19kp,bumbleb333,6,Sun Jul 12 23:53:56 2015 UTC,"In the next generation of players, Raonic, Dimitrov, and Nishikori are generally the ones people have pegged as future Slam winners. In my opinion, those guys are in the unfortunate position of being in the gap where the Big 4 will still dominate while they should be in their primes, and they might be over their peak by the time the big guns are on their way out. But my (extremely biased) opinion is that Nishikori is someone to watch, if he can keep his body healthy enough.   Kyrgios, Kokkinakis, Coric, and Rublev are the ones to watch from the generation behind the guys mentioned above. These guys are young enough (Kyrgios being the oldest at 20) to be in prime position to capitalize on the Big Four declining and leaving the game. And many have had moderate success in the ATP so far, Kyrgios being the most successful in the later stages. Tiafoe, Chung, and Ymer also.  Also, it has to be said - I think Murray has more left in him. He's not over the hill yet."

Murray can, but he is mentally shot the last couple of years. Rafa seems to have faded. It is setting up for 2-3 years of novak dominance. After that, someone like Borna Coric or Thiem could take the mantle, but they do not have the potential that Novak, Rafa, or Fed showed early on"

I've heard a few rumors from people connected to TA, but that's all they are, rumors. We as the public will never know the full story.    Do I think what Bernie did was a good idea?  Probably not.  What I was impressed was him saying he would be available for Davis Cup,  he wanted to put the honor of representing Australia above politics and do right by Lleyton, Roche and the rest of the team.     Pick the strongest team you can, and put the rest of the bullshit aside   TA banning Tomic, not even allowing Masur (the captain) to make the decision shows how they weren't willing to put politics aside.

I played last year with someone who hadn't hit a ball in 10 years, and within an hour or two he was kind of getting it back a bit. I would do practice sessions on different days if possible, so play early tomorrow morning as well if your brother is a morning person. The challenge will simply be rediscovering ""feel"" for the ball, and if he's like me after a long absence, he might need say 6 hours minimum to start to get it back.  More important maybe is the emotional side of things -- even if he loses and loses badly, he should try to let it not affect him negatively. No one should expect him to be winning tournament matches after 5 years away and with only 1 day of practice."

So obsessed with who is the ""GOAT""... Is it REALLY that important? Federer is one of the greats, if not the greatest. Rod Laver too.    The reality is Federer has only won 2 slams since 2009, which is still a good result for a normal tennis player, not so much for the greatest of all time. I think his fans are just lashing out at anything now.    Roddick (who had some altercations with Novak during his career) has had nothing but praise for Novak. He commends his incredibly hard work ethic and determination. Meanwhile these sulky fans just try and belittle his achievements.     Shame! Shame! Shame! * ring ring *"

tennis,3d7ftj,jacktennisthrow,13,Tue Jul 14 05:43:07 2015 UTC,"How you can be a fan of the game and claim Djokovic is taking supplements is beyond me. Just accept the fact the man always had the talent but got it figured out mentally at end of 2010 and played to his potential from then on . He won a GS in 2008 which was still in Fed's prime. In fact he straight sets beat him in that semi in Australia. Just a couple months earlier he had set points in both the first two sets at the US open final. His mental game was weak after that, he thought he won once and it would come easy after that but it doesn't work like that, he kept playing the status quo and not improving. He made a poor coaching choice that switched his serve mechanics in hopes of improving at the net but it didn't work and his serve suffered which made him lose lots of confidence. Watch the 2008 AO he was able to do what Fed does so well, serve out of a 15-40 or 0-40 hole, then 2009 he was terrible at it. He also improved his conditioning, you know that's possible without supplements right? Especially when it's your fucking job, not like he has anything else to focus on but his game. His daily routine has been mentioned so many times, he barely lets himself indulge in anything, he drinks only room temperature water, his diet is insane, i'd be hungry all day if that was my diet and I don't expend half the calories he does,that's how dedicated he is. You think this is just one big lie made up by his team to cover up for supplements?"

Had Djokovic stayed #3 and continued being the player he was in 07-10, nobody would have batted an eye and thought he'd ""underachieved."" Everyone thought he had reached his potential.  Then all of a sudden he's this indefatigable monster, flying around the baseline and painting the lines from both wings until Nadal just goes, ""I can't win. I can't beat this guy.""  And out of all the players in 2011, guess who caused him the most trouble and was a point away from going 2-1 on him in Grand Slams that year?   The Nadal fans are the ones who should be butthurt.

tennis,3d188a,bumbleb333,3,Mon Jul 13 03:25:30 2015 UTC,The hugging each other and what not thing is akin to shaking your opponent's hand at the net after the match is over. In the NBA Finals/Stanley Cup Finals/Superbowl (don't watch baseball so I have no clue if it's the same) the losers don't stick around and watch after; they leave before the trophy presentation happens.

tennis,3d188a,bumbleb333,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:44:15 2015 UTC,And he has congratulated and shaken hands with opponents numerous other times. Even in worse defeats. he walked off without shaking hands after the 2009 ECF when he averaged something like 39/8/8 on absurd shooting percentages but his teammates still couldn't get anything done to help him win. I imagine he was way more pissed about them than the Magic players and he just wanted to gtfo. Was it bad sportsmanship? Yeah but that certainly isn't the norm for him. There are probably as many examples of unsportsmanlike conduct from top players in tennis as in other sports.   Most are extremely classy and are fantastic ambassadors for the sport but sometimes emotions can get the best of them.

The main is most severe during serve motion (not constantly, just from time to time)  I assume it's mainly from wrong mechanics and weak muscles.  Can you share if you've been through similar problem and how did you manage it?"
tennis,3d4wcs,FruitySploosh,3,Mon Jul 13 15:31:26 2015 UTC,Warm up and be sure to stretch your hamstrings. Also are you bending back on your serve?( like trying to get kick on it) If you are then that's the reason. You can't keep that up for too long.  You would have to change your motion. If not then I can't be any further help.

Even Djokovic and Federer who are much more in form than him has trouble at the U.S. Del Potro and Cilic has broken through, and you can see Wawrinka and Nishikori contend.  Simply said, there will be a lot more guys that can trouble him in the U.S than on clay. With such tricky path, likely just to get to the semis or final, he has to get back to 2010 form.

That's not an easy task for anyone and still adds to his already fortified legacy. And he's among the oldest in history to get to this level of a slam.    I'm sad for Roger, but also happy for Novak. Imagine how crushing it would have been for Novak to have lost more than half of his grand slam finals (He's 9/17 now). Roger didn't lose as much from this loss as Novak would have.   Novak continuing to win is among the best things that protects Roger's legacy. He is the best testimony to what Roger has achieved. I doubt Novak will get to 17 slams or 302 weeks at no.1, but he certainly keeps anyone else from getting it anytime soon, particularly Nadal.

tennis,3d0yaz,Dragon_jones,2,Sun Jul 12 22:04:32 2015 UTC,"That's actually such a good argument; since Rafa isn't playing so well this year, people tend to forget that he's 3 away from Federer's 17 and Djokovic, as well as he's playing, is still 8 away. Even if Djokovic wins the US open, AO + French, another Wimbledon, AND another AO (USO 2016 for calendar slam would be too much; heck, I'm giving him a Serena slam here) he would just be on par with Nadal. If he still has it in him, he'll win 2 more - but do take note that other people will be decent, if not good, by then. Those two additional slams leave you with 16, which is still less than Roger.   On the other hand, if Nadal recovers to win the French next year, and win just one other slam besides that, he would be at 16. Djokovic can win the USO, sweep 3 out of 4 slams next year, and win 2 out of 4 the year after and he'll still be two less than Roger. Precariously close, I would say, but that's how much he'll need to surpass Nadal (by one, and that's if Nadal NEVER wins RG again) and meanwhile, it's less of a chance for anyone else to catch up to Roger.   So a huge silver lining to this loss, I suppose. And to think of it, Djokovic will need to retain No. 1 for nearly three more years to surpass 302 weeks up at the top. Two years is believable, sure - but given that Djokovic's game is so dependent on fitness and consistency, I don't think he'll be able to last three."

tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,0,Sun Jul 12 20:55:08 2015 UTC,Djokovic would have won at least 2 more anyways.  Federer is still chasing after number 18 and his body and mind are not getting any younger.

tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,5,Sun Jul 12 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"I think he's still out there because he is hungry.  To us, he has nothing to play for.  I'm positive that to him, he has to extend his mark as far as he can and any missed opportunity is a failure to do so."
tennis,3d0yaz,Disastrously_Dazed,0,Sun Jul 12 21:14:36 2015 UTC,"We'll see come hard court season but I definitely see him ending his career at 18 GS. Maybe add a gold next year? Who knows. Sure he's half a step slower than his prime but when he's on, you have to be Djokovic to stop him."
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:49:44 2015 UTC,"I hope you are correct but my eyes tell me that the hard court season will be closer to clay than grass in toughness.  It's a baseliner's game which does not allow Roger to serve and volley as freely as he does on grass.  For him to have a reasonable shot, every hard court needs to be as fast as the Paris or Cincinnati courts."
tennis,3d0yaz,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:46:44 2015 UTC,"What surface will the Olympics be on? If it's grass Federer should be a slight favorite, especially since it's only 2 out of 3 sets until the final. If it's hard court Djokovic should be the clear favorite, and on clay it's pretty wide open, especially considering Nadal's decline, the late bloomer Wawrinka and the ever present Djokovic."

tennis,3d0yaz,pfc_bgd,8,Sun Jul 12 19:23:34 2015 UTC,"as Novak pulls away and Stan the Man caught up in terms of slams, there's less and less of a case for Murray being part of the big 4. The gap between Novak's and Murray's achievements is larger than that of Murray's and Stan's."

tennis,3d0yaz,Rafael_Federer,17,Sun Jul 12 17:40:04 2015 UTC,no rising stars   this is the single biggest factor  it really is astounding that a soon-to-be 34 year old is his current biggest threat
tennis,3d0yaz,sktrdie,4,Sun Jul 12 19:20:42 2015 UTC,This is actually true. There's really nobody to contend his next 2 year long prime. Federer and Nadal seem a bit passed it. Wawrinka seems to be his only achilles heel.
tennis,3d0yaz,recrec20,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:43:59 2015 UTC,"Djokovic plays a very taxing game on the body. I'd give him 18-24 months before his body starts to slow. I'd say he's a good chance to equal Sampras/Nadal. Anything more would be beyond impressive. As others have mentioned, it will also depend on the younger talent coming through."
tennis,3d0yaz,ThatFag,13,Sun Jul 12 19:46:02 2015 UTC,"Fourteen grand slams is not short-lived. Also, who's to say he's not going to be back? It's Rafa. He's a fighter. He's not going to retire any time soon. He's 29.   Long live the King of Clay!"
tennis,3d0yaz,beepbloopbloop,3,Sun Jul 12 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"He's been the defining clay player of our generation, but I don't think you can call most of his career the Nadal era. Federer has a firm hold on the 2000s."

People get older and don't play as well, it's a part of life. It's like being sad at Wayne Gretzky not winning a cup with the Kings, dude already accomplished everything, just let it go...ya'll act like it's so hard rooting for the greatest tennis player ever."
tennis,3d0yaz,spankymuffin,12,Sun Jul 12 17:41:27 2015 UTC,Well he's also a super nice guy. It's hard not to like and root for him.
tennis,3d0yaz,AnalAstronomer,-10,Sun Jul 12 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"He was also very petty and hardly ever gave credit to other players  when he lost in his prime, people here either seem to forget that or have only watched him in the latter part of his career. He's not some saint who never said a bad word in his life. I think Djokovic and Nadal are much more gracious at giving credit where it's due after tough losses.   In any case, I mean there's people in here telling him to stay strong and talking like this was his first chance for a Wimbledon title...guy has 7 of these. The pity party is just ridiculous when put into perspective."
tennis,3d0yaz,bumbleb333,2,Sun Jul 12 17:28:48 2015 UTC,Nadal are much more gracious at giving credit where it's due after tough losses   lol? just off the top of my head. 2009 US SF vs delpo: abdominal injury 2014 AO final: back injury Every wimbledon loss from 2012-2014 = injured 2009 FO v soderling: injured Australian open v murray one year= injured Australian open v ferrer one year= injured
tennis,3d0yaz,spankymuffin,6,Sun Jul 12 18:12:48 2015 UTC,That's nonsense. I've watched him since the early 2000s and he's been only classy and professional in defeat.

tennis,3d0yaz,yaaa_gunners_yaaa,2,Sun Jul 12 20:26:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's always sad to see great sport stars slowing down. I remember watching Federer years ago in his prime and the man was just an artist back then. We still see flashes of it today but not quite with the same level of consistency. I think the mind is willing with Roger, but the body is perhaps calling out for things to start winding down. I would love to see him win one more and it would be especially wonderful if he won Wimbledon again, just for old times sake, but he doesn't have anything left to prove really. He's a fantastic athlete and ambassador for the sport, and I do regard him as the best to ever play the game. Nobody has quite taken my breath away in the same way. I'll be sad when he hangs up the racquet."

tennis,3d0yaz,CityofIndustry,0,Sun Jul 12 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. If Federer had played today like he did against Murray I think he would've won. Djokovic played very well, but it was Federer's errors and lackluster serving (for him) that caused him to lose."
tennis,3d0yaz,nachomannacho,3,Mon Jul 13 01:18:55 2015 UTC,"The only time I've felt depressed after a Wimbledon final was when Roddick lost in '09 against Federer (again). Man, the end of that 5th set was hard to watch.   Federer's had the most incredible career ever. He'll be alright."
tennis,3d0yaz,bumbleb333,8,Mon Jul 13 00:32:28 2015 UTC,"It's kind of funny how ardently people seem to want him to win no. 18 when he really has more than enough titles and doesn't have anything left to prove anymore. Like, Nadal doesn't get this much hysteria about no. 15 and I'd argue he's declining faster than Fed is."

tennis,3d0yaz,IFedTheCat,9,Sun Jul 12 18:47:49 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely devastated for Roger.  I hope he does not let this get to him.  If it were me, I would strongly consider retirement.  Not because he's not playing well, but because in two back to back years he has to endure losing his only two grand slam finals which are on his favorite surface to the same man.  That would really eat at me.    I hope Roger is a stronger man than I am.  If he keeps this level of play up and he gets some help from an upset, he can still get number 18.  Stay strong, Roger."
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,8,Sun Jul 12 18:59:45 2015 UTC,"Not because he's not playing well, but because in two back to back years he has to endure losing his only two grand slam finals which are on his favorite surface to the same man. That would really eat at me.   Djokovic has undergone worse. In the last 4 seasons, Djokovic has made 11 GS Finals and lost most (6) of them despite being ranked #1 most of the time and favored, often heavily, in nearly every one. He could be at 15 GS wins were it not for, as his critics put it (not saying I agree), repeated and consistent ""choking"" in Finals, frequently to ""lesser"" players. That is what has to eat at you."
tennis,3d0yaz,Kitaoji,5,Mon Jul 13 01:26:09 2015 UTC,"Djokovic is at the ripe age of 28.  He already has 9 titles and isn't showing signs of slowing down.  He knows he can keep dominating the men's tour.  Roger is a month away from being 34.  He knows he isn't the player he used to be.  He knows he cannot rely on himself to play at this level consistently for a few years.  Every chance he gets is his ""last chance""."
tennis,3d0yaz,spankymuffin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:42:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. His win/loss record in finals is pretty poor. His level is amazing how many times he gets to a final, or just the ending point of a slam, but losing to Murray twice, and Wawrinka in RG final, and AUS Open SF, those are kinda poor stats. When it's supposed to be players like Fed and Nadal that stops you from winning it."
tennis,3d0yaz,sweetmatter,5,Sun Jul 12 17:53:49 2015 UTC,"He's still playing really, really good tennis. Sure, he's not winning every grand slam like he did back in the early 2000s, but winning two in the last five years is still a big deal. He's ranked no. 2 in the world; why retire now?"
tennis,3d0yaz,bitchdantkillmyvibe,2,Sun Jul 12 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"There is a good argument for his retirement and it has to do with context and Federer's perspective. To Federer, reaching a final is nice and all but a championship counts more. To a lot of minor players, being in a grand slam finals or winning 1 grand slam is the ultimate career achievement. Federer doesn't need anymore money, he's set for life. He's been at #1 for so long he doesn't need rankings either. The only thing Federer needs and wants, the only things that are meaningful to him now are more championships to add to the collection and probably an Olympic gold medal."
tennis,3d0yaz,spankymuffin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:05:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, spot on. I think he really, really would want that olympic gold medal... it is really the only blemish on his career, so if he wins gold next year, which is possible, then I can see him retiring after that. There is really nothing left for him to do then."
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:10:09 2015 UTC,"But he has been doing consistently well these past few years, so I think he still has a few championships in him."
tennis,3d0yaz,PetevonPete,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"It's easy for us to say because we can admire his career as a body of work from a distance.  For him, he has to be thinking that this might have been his last real chance at number 18.  The thoughts are already in his head.  The question is how quickly he can push them out.  If we're lucky, it'll be very quickly."
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,4,Mon Jul 13 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely devastated for Roger. I hope he does not let this get to him. If it were me, I would strongly consider retirement.

tennis,3d0yaz,703251,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:14:09 2015 UTC,The difference is that Federer wants to separate himself as the unquestioned greatest of all time and a win here would have done wonders for that argument.
tennis,3d0yaz,gg_2015,7,Sun Jul 12 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"He's still playing great tennis being number 2 in the world and retiring before trying for another olympic gold ( which he has a good chance at) and another wimbledon title next year would be heartbreaking. He played a great match two tie breaks plus a break in the third. sure there were alot of unforced errors but what i saw in that semi final against murray made me think federer can play forever. He's amazing and can continue he needs to bounce back from this stronger, also lately it seems like he doesnt take these losses as bad as he did earlier in his career. Last year was more heart breaking"
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,2,Sun Jul 12 18:50:41 2015 UTC,"You're right, he doesn't seem to take these losses as hard as he used to. Maybe that's the problem?"
tennis,3d0yaz,Personacorona,3,Sun Jul 12 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"He does alright. He shed a few tears last year. He just gets over it much quicker. His tally of 17 looks safe right now, and I think he understands that. He's already struggling with his physical state. I don't think he needs to add more pressure by dwelling on losses, some of which he can't control (Djokovic's brilliance, Cilic's and Wawrinka's power)."
tennis,3d0yaz,spankymuffin,3,Sun Jul 12 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"In last year's final, he was outplayed.  This year, we all knew the caliber of tennis he produced just two days ago.  He let this one go because of nerves.  That's why I think it hurts more.  I hope you are right in thinking that losses don't hurt him as much because that is the biggest reason why he will keep playing.  Once the losses sting, he will think more seriously about hanging it up."
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,13,Sun Jul 12 17:16:45 2015 UTC,Novak hit a level this match that's almost inhuman. Federer was outplayed this year as well.
tennis,3d0yaz,gg_2015,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:32:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. At least he made it to a fifth set last year.
tennis,3d0yaz,ferpecto,0,Sun Jul 12 17:15:37 2015 UTC,"Yes Djokovic was playing at an extremely high level.  I still think that if Roger played the same quality that he played against Murray, he would be holding the championship trophy.  If he held serve in the first set, I think he would have won in 4."
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,17,Sun Jul 12 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"He couldn't have played the same quality. Novak is a different opponent. They used to be identical in playing style, but Novak has left Andy behind in the dust. His serve is more accurate and a weapon, as evidenced by how much Fed struggled today to challenge Djokovic on his serve (only converted 1 break point). He's also more skilled at hitting superb shots or counter shots. There was a point when Fed had an insane volley on the net, only to be countered by Djokovic for a winner."
tennis,3d0yaz,raped_giraffe,3,Sun Jul 12 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, even if brought his form from the Murray game over, it still would have been a 50/50 match...Djokovic was hitting winners and decent returns out of insane places during rallies, putting immense pressure on Fed (which is what he does best). Not to mention his own great serve AND return of serve. Fed would have had to play at that top level for much longer.    I love watching Federer play, and its always sad when I see him lose a final, but Djokovic is amazing at what he does too. Fed is still and will always be THE champion of this sport in my eyes though so there's nothing to be too sad about."
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,2,Sun Jul 12 17:25:15 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about strategy.  I'm talking about his balls finding the right spots like they did in the Murray match.  I'm talking about the lack of hesitation and nervousness that he had in the Murray match.
tennis,3d0yaz,Personacorona,6,Sun Jul 12 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"As someone who follows Djokovic religiously throughout of his career, Djokovic won today through sheer concentration and focus, honestly his backhand was super underwhelming today, and he seemed to shit his pants 90% of the time Federer came to the net. But Djokovic forehand was at the highest possible level and today that was enough to beat Federer."
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,2,Sun Jul 12 18:10:13 2015 UTC,"Federer's forehand was not of the highest possible level today.  Neither was his serve placement.  Neither was his backhand.  Neither was his movement.  I think Roger could have won if he was a little bit better in every category like he was against Murray.  Djokovic definitely played better than in his match against Gasquet, but I thought that Djokovic was not at his very best today.  Roger was almost perfect against Murray and a performance of that caliber in my mind would have been enough to beat Djokovic today."
tennis,3d0yaz,sweetmatter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:57:15 2015 UTC,Yes but it's damn near impossible to replicate that level again.
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:13:58 2015 UTC,I think he could have if he wasn't so nervous.  He played a quality match that would have been good enough to beat anyone else on the tour.  The only thing that stopped him from being as good as in the semifinal was nerves.
tennis,3d0yaz,Lagerstrasse,2,Sun Jul 12 20:25:02 2015 UTC,I agree with you but I also disagree with you. Federer wasn't playing as well as he did with Andy Murray. He still would have lost to Djokovic though. Djokovic wasn't even at 100% and could have played a lot better.
tennis,3d0yaz,127crazie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"I think that Djokovic's confidence went up as Roger's level went down.  The Federer from Friday would have taken the first set and would have been up 2 sets to 1.  After that, maybe Djokovic would have come back or maybe he would have gotten frustrated and more hesitant.  I wish we got to see that match today."
tennis,3d0yaz,jeffwingersballs,15,Sun Jul 12 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely devastated for Roger.   17 Grand Slam titles and an estimated $320 million in the bank... yeah, my heart breaks for him, too."
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,18,Sun Jul 12 23:28:11 2015 UTC,I always hate when people say things like this. Just because athletes make money doesn't mean we can't feel sorry for them when they lose.
tennis,3d0yaz,sweetmatter,2,Sun Jul 12 23:50:43 2015 UTC,Great family too and still the second best player in the world.
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,-5,Sun Jul 12 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"I know you're being sarcastic, but Federer wants to have his own distinct place in history in as many places as he can.  He has a losing record against Nadal.  He has fewer Wimbledons than Nadal has French Opens.  He shares the Wimbledon record while Nadal stands alone at Roland Garros.  He has fewer Australian Opens than Djokovic.  He is tied for most US Opens in Open era with Conners and Sampras.  For being the greatest player of all time, he does not have one slam strictly to his name.  That hunger is what keeps him playing.  He is very happy with his 17 grand slam titles and 80+ singles titles and other accomplishments but he's always thinking ""what's next?""  He is always hungry.  And at this stage in his career, he does not have the ability to produce slam winning results every year.  That is eventually going to eat at his psyche."
tennis,3d0yaz,CallowMethuselah,3,Sun Jul 12 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"Why are you down-voted? You are entirely right. You also bring forth the point that although he is unquestionably the GOAT, his GOATness is achievable by other players, most imminently, Novak Djokovic."
tennis,3d0yaz,avaliantheel,2,Sun Jul 12 19:40:27 2015 UTC,It's no worries.  I put my opinion on the internet.  Getting judged comes with the territory.
tennis,3d0yaz,holliniv,3,Sun Jul 12 18:13:36 2015 UTC,"I hope Roger is a stronger man than I am.   Most people consider him to be the greatest of all time in a sport that demands mental toughness. Compared to most of us, his confidence is sure to be a tad less shakable.   I also hope that he doesn't retire any time soon. Then again, he owes nothing to fans like me; he's already provided us some of the best matches and most flawless tennis that I've ever seen. He knows himself and his potential better than anyone. Whenever he decides to call it a career, I'll try to be happy for him and his family. But it'll still suck for us. :)"

It will definitely seem ridiculous to non-fans but there's something about a Federer GS loss that lingers on your mind.

When I watched it seemed Fed just hit a lot more wild shots out of nowhere, and a lot of them were untimely. He served pretty well, but not well enough to trouble the best  returner in the game. I can sympathize with him how he lost the match, but he never really had the upper hand on Novak. His only momentum after winning the 2nd set tiebreaker was followed by a flat start to the 3rd set."

tennis,3d2inl,dragonsky,5,Mon Jul 13 00:24:18 2015 UTC,"Djokovic is the stand-out favourite. Even if he doesn’t win it, I’d say he’s got an extremely good chance of getting to the final.  Outside of him, I’d say that Murray, Federer and Wawrinka all have a strong chance. Murray has obviously found some good form again, and is more than capable of beating Djokovic on his day. Federer will have a good chance, although may struggle if he meets Djokovic. Wawrinka is hard to rule out these days as well.  Hopefully Nadal will give a good performance, but I’m struggling to see him winning the whole thing."
tennis,3d2inl,Parmizan,8,Mon Jul 13 01:23:48 2015 UTC,"I think Nadal will come back to playing very well by the USO, and will make it to the Semis, losing to an inspired Wawrinka.

tennis,3d0yjk,YaoPau,31,Sun Jul 12 16:40:34 2015 UTC,"My new thought is that anyone who gets to #1 is automatically in the GOAT discussion.  When you're a little kid dreaming, you dream about becoming the best in the world, and it's a massive amount of work to pass every single player in the world between you and your goal.  To actually reach that goal is incredible.  And once you reach that goal, there's a million things you can do.  You're in your 20s, you're rich, you're popular, you've spent your childhood playing one game over and over, and you're free to take up other interests or care less about tennis like a normal person would.  Some players choose to stay hellbent on tennis and invent new bars for success, like winning every Slam, or staying at #1 for a long time, or playing for 15+ years at a high level, and that's fine but that doesn't make them better.  Borg dominated the world for years, lost his motivation and moved onto other things.  Ken Dryden comes to mind in hockey as someone who walked away very early, and still he's often seen as the best goaltender of all-time.  Mike Tyson was the unified heavyweight champ for just 3 years, but he's commonly in best all-time discussions.  Obviously someone like Carlos Moya doesn't have a great GOAT argument because of how he eeked his way to #1.  But guys like Djokovic, Borg, McEnroe, Lendl are often seen as second-tier candidates ... yet they all dominated the world at their peak.  All of them had 40+ match win streaks, won multiple Slams in the same year, and were the clear world #1s.  Djokovic is a near-god in his country, married the woman of his dreams, makes tens of millions of dollars each year ... I think he'd like to have 18 Slams, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's realized at this point that it's just a number and he's awesome regardless."
tennis,3d0yjk,jacktennisthrow,6,Sun Jul 12 18:14:08 2015 UTC,"How is Borg seen as a second-tier candidate?  Also, Tyson is not considered in all-time heavyweight discussions. That goes squarely to Ali. All-time pound for pound would probably be Sugar Ray Leonard. (I meant Sugar Ray Robinson)."
tennis,3d0yjk,compuzr,6,Sun Jul 12 20:51:14 2015 UTC,All-time pound for pound would probably be Sugar Ray Leonard Robinson.
tennis,3d0yjk,YoungCinny,3,Sun Jul 12 21:12:01 2015 UTC,Tyson definitely gets talked about. His prime may have been the best ever
tennis,3d0yjk,asm129,2,Mon Jul 13 00:38:44 2015 UTC,"Mike Tyson from 1986 just might beat Ali from 1966. Tyson's hands were just as fast, he had better movement, and much better power than prime Ali. Ali's advantages are speed and reach and a wicked jab. I love Ali but Tyson in his prime is too strong for him and would beat him."
tennis,3d0yjk,jacktennisthrow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:15:04 2015 UTC,The line I've heard is that he boxed his way through a bunch of carefully selected has-beens and never-weres to reach where he reached. His first loss shows that. To a journeyman.
tennis,3d0yjk,YoungCinny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:59:31 2015 UTC,I've heard that too and it doesn't take into account so many things. Tyson was poorly managed and a mental disaster but do some research and watch the tape. Look at the hand speed and the power. His footwork rivals Ali's and his head movement is better. The tape doesn't lie - he had better hand speed and better power than Ali. Ali was known for trying to weave and dodge and take soft hits to tire out the opponent. If Tyson connected one hook it's lights out for pretty much anyone. In their absolute primes I'd bet money on Tyson.

tennis,3d0yjk,1amathrowaway,29,Mon Jul 13 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"Rod Laver put him at #6 at the beginning of 2012. Since then, he's won 5 more Grand Slams, so yeah, I'd say he's squarely in the Top 5."
tennis,3d0yjk,gibisee4,5,Sun Jul 12 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see that list. I'm guessing it was Fed, Nadal, Sampras, Borg, and Agassi ahead of him?"

tennis,3d0yjk,plenty_of_time,11,Sun Jul 12 22:09:19 2015 UTC,Tennis matched are so little based on luck that in 10 years who knows who else will have won 5+ majors. No one thought Sampras would be joined by Fed and Nadal at the top so soon after he retired.
tennis,3d0yjk,supremechairumpire,14,Sun Jul 12 17:30:10 2015 UTC,Absolutely. McEnroe and his fellow broadcasters were just saying he's definitively in the top 5 of all time.
tennis,3d0yjk,ChaoticMidget,17,Sun Jul 12 16:49:54 2015 UTC,No doubt. Maybe you could say that Djokovic became dominant when Federer was just past his peak but he also took 3 majors in a row off Nadal during his most dominant streak. He's also the only one to be basically even with both Federer and Nadal so to not include him when he likely has a handful of more majors to win seems silly.
tennis,3d0yjk,plenty_of_time,36,Sun Jul 12 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"Even completely ignoring results and looking at his game, you have to include him if you include Nadal. He is the new physical tennis player, the only player to look at Nadal and say, I can be just as physical as he is."
tennis,3d0yjk,Gotebe,4,Sun Jul 12 17:24:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Physicality-wise he is way under Nadal.  Nadal broke himself way too quickly, he can't string a whole season since 2011, whereas Novak, with almost the same age as Rafa, shows no sign of a slowdown."
tennis,3d0yjk,SleepingAntz,21,Sun Jul 12 19:29:57 2015 UTC,Djokovic beat Nadal in the longest Slam final ever...
tennis,3d0yjk,Gotebe,27,Sun Jul 12 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"Because his game is less physical, therefore he could keep it up for longer?  I seem to have expressed myself badly: I didn't mean that Novak is way under Nadal physically but rather that Novak game is way less physically demanding."
tennis,3d0yjk,SleepingAntz,15,Sun Jul 12 20:28:11 2015 UTC,"Oh I see what you're saying - Nadal's game is more physically demanding, therefore he won't have the longevity Novak will have.  I agree!"

tennis,3d0yjk,dariya_dil,6,Sun Jul 12 20:50:39 2015 UTC,"He has an argument. Whether or not it's definitive is another discussion, but he certainly has an argument yes."
tennis,3d0yjk,sweetmatter,24,Sun Jul 12 16:43:19 2015 UTC,Definitely  For me it's:   Federer Nadal Sampras Djokovic Borg   The reason I put Djokovic ahead of Borg is because I think he's  the more complete player and will surpass Borg's 11 slams even though he's only on 9 now.
tennis,3d0yjk,scouting4food,24,Sun Jul 12 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"I'm really on the fence about Borg. His slam wins are only at Wimbledon and the French. He couldn't win on hardcourt. Tennis is all surfaces.   When considering the greats of tennis I don't include people who play with wood rackets. To me, it was a completely different sport back then.  My top 5 are: Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, Sampras, and Agassi."
tennis,3d0yjk,paper_zoe,17,Sun Jul 12 17:04:13 2015 UTC,But don't forget that Borg retired at 25/26. What he achieved within that period is astounding.
tennis,3d0yjk,sweetmatter,13,Sun Jul 12 21:48:42 2015 UTC,"Added to that, he only even entered the Australian Open once (when he was 17/18). So all he achieved was basically in 3/4s of the Grand Slams that today's players have."
tennis,3d0yjk,paper_zoe,0,Sun Jul 12 23:04:27 2015 UTC,He didn't achieve 3 out of the 4 grand slams. He never won the U.S. Open. Since he boycotted Australian he's really more 2/3 of the Grand Slams. Which is not a better percentage than 3/4 or 3/3 or 4/4 btw.  There are players that have career grand slams 4/4 which in my eyes is more impressive.
tennis,3d0yjk,PlayingKarrde,6,Sun Jul 12 23:50:06 2015 UTC,I phrased that badly. I mean what he had to work with (Grand Slam-wise) was only three quarters of what today's players have. As until the 1980s no one really bothered about the Australian Open.
tennis,3d0yjk,thebeesbollocks,6,Sun Jul 12 23:54:23 2015 UTC,"Well yeah but remember that back then all courts played extremely differently as opposed to different versions of a hard court (of sorts). Back then clay court players just wouldn't even bother going to Winbledon since ""grass is for cows"".   If anything what Borg did was way more impressive back then than what Rafa did when he won both the Frnch and Wimbledon back to back.   Borg is unquestionably in the top 5."
tennis,3d0yjk,egn56,5,Sun Jul 12 23:30:35 2015 UTC,Borg was ridiculously dominant and very famous during his prime. Since he retired he has been out of the public eye compared to other legends but we shouldn't forget just how good he was. Top 5 for sure.
tennis,3d0yjk,egn56,7,Mon Jul 13 00:07:48 2015 UTC,So where is Djokovic's clay major? Also in Borg's defense the US Open was only played on hardcourts for three seasons of his career.
tennis,3d0yjk,egn56,13,Sun Jul 12 17:43:49 2015 UTC,"It's not like Djokovic lost most of his FO matches to the greatest clay court player of all time, right?"
tennis,3d0yjk,egn56,2,Sun Jul 12 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"From 08 it has been Nadal, Kohl, Melzer, Fed, Nadal (x3), Stan. So it's only half of them. He's had his chances to win an FO."
tennis,3d0yjk,Parmizan,11,Sun Jul 12 19:23:10 2015 UTC,"First of all, the Melzer and Kohlschreiber days were before his prime. It's fine. Federer has also lost to guys like Tsonga, Horna, Kuerten (past his prime), etc...  Losing 4 times to an invincible Nadal, a full-throttle Stan, and Federer (so 6 total) isn't a joke. Nothing to be ashamed of. Out of all those matches, there was only one match where Djokovic was in control, and then collapsed with his lead in the 5th set (2013 Semi finals). Nadal went on to beat Ferrer in the final that year. So yes, he's had his chances. But I'd use that term lightly, as in Novak's prime, he's lost to the Nadal or Stan (the eventual winners) or Federer in the last year of his prime,"
tennis,3d0yjk,Personacorona,5,Sun Jul 12 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"I'd argue 09 and 10 are Djokovic prime years. He was a major champion, won a master series on clay at that point. He was considered in 09 to be the second favorite behind Nadal that year.   Also why are you even bringing Fed into this? I don't care who he lost to. The discussion is Novak. If the argument against Borg is he never won a hardcourt major the argument against Novak is he never won a clay major. No matter how you to try to spin it that remains fact. Frankly this year all the cards fell into place and he came up short. He's also had issues in the past where he had proven he could beat Nadal but came up short where it mattered most. Novak has performed exceptionally well on clay and in France, but has still managed to always be a bit worse than he should be."
tennis,3d0yjk,egn56,6,Sun Jul 12 22:06:11 2015 UTC,"He clearly wasn't in his prime in 2009 when he went as far as the QF, 3rd round, QF, and SF in all four slams that year. He was still headcase, immature Djokovic. His head was finally screwed on right after he won the 2010 Davis Cup. Federer dominated 2009 after Nadal got injured. The top players that year were Nadal, Federer, Del Potro, Roddick, and Davydenko in that order. In 2010 Novak was getting his ass beat by the likes of Berdych and Melzer. I brought Federer into this as an example of how even the best lost to average players, before hitting their prime. No need to get on the defensive. If you're too immature to recognize that, then I think it's best that we leave this discussion to rest. This year there were no cards that fell into place. Djokovic beat Kokkinakis, Gasquet, Nadal, and Murray, only to lose to Wawrinka who was playing never-before seen levels of power tennis. I don't know how you see that as an easy draw. That was as bad as it could get. He only let it slip one time (2013) during his prime. Other than that, he's been beaten by two of the greatest players of all time, and a fire Wawrinka. I cannot say that he's been worse than he should be. He has enough clay Masters titles and has pushed Nadal enough to prove himself.  Borg only had 4 opportunities at a hard court slam, and lost in the finals of 3 of them. Unfortunately, there may be enough evidence to say that he's decent at hard courts, but not much else."
tennis,3d0yjk,sweetmatter,2,Sun Jul 12 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"He clearly wasn't in his prime in 2009 when he went as far as the QF, 3rd round, QF, and SF in all four slams that year.

Novak Djokovic finished the year ranked 3. Done even having this argument if you are going to say Davydenko was a better player.    I brought Federer into this as an example of how even the best lost to average players, before hitting their prime. No need to get on the defensive. If you're too immature to recognize that, then I think it's best that we leave this discussion to rest.    Not getting immature. It doesn't make any point. Also Fed lost to Guga in his prime that was 2004? We calling that not his prime? Do we just simply now define primes around bad losses?    This year there were no cards that fell into place. Djokovic beat Kokkinakis, Gasquet, Nadal, and Murray, only to lose to Wawrinka who was playing never-before seen levels of power tennis. I don't know how you see that as an easy draw. That was as bad as it could get.    Everyone was calling this his year. Nadal was clearly not Nadal. Not even close to his old form. It was his year to win. You even said yourself it was only Nadal who really stopped him. So how with Nadal gone does it not make it easier.    He only let it slip one time (2013) during his prime. Other than that, he's been beaten by two of the greatest players of all time, and a fire Wawrinka. I cannot say that he's been worse than he should be. He has enough clay Masters titles and has pushed Nadal enough to prove himself.     In France he has underperformed in the largest moments. Elsewhere no.    Borg only had 4 opportunities at a hard court slam, and lost in the finals of 3 of them. Unfortunately, there may be enough evidence to say that he's decent at hard courts, but not much else.    Borg won numerous masters equivalents in hard courts with wins over McEnroe and Connors. There is no way you can claim that their is not enough evidence to say he is just as good on hardcourts as Djokovic in clay as you can argue for 4 years he was the second be hard court player and that's about all you can say for Djokovic at the end of the day."
tennis,3d0yjk,PlayingKarrde,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:49:09 2015 UTC,"Novak Djokovic finished the year ranked 3. Done even having this argument if you are going to say Davydenko was a better player.   He finished the year ranked at 3, but Djokovic in 2009 was nowhere near his prime. He never won any grand slams, and failed to make any finals that year. Considering he then went on to win 3 in 2011, and has won at least one in every year since then, he quite clearly wasn’t at his prime at the time. Still a very good player, admittedly, but nowhere near his best."
tennis,3d0yjk,dariya_dil,15,Mon Jul 13 01:20:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Djok can play on clay, we know that."
tennis,3d0yjk,paper_zoe,15,Sun Jul 12 17:53:22 2015 UTC,Because Borg's two hardcourt US Open finals and numerous hardcourt titles are because he can't play on the surface.
tennis,3d0yjk,tennisboy123,0,Sun Jul 12 19:18:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah you make a good point that the U.S. Open was also on clay. Also, the Australian Open was on grass during his prime. But that's also a point that works against Borg as well. If they're on clay and grass how come Borg can't win half of the majors? Well one of the reasons is he just didn't show up to play at the Australian because he admittedly needed a break. Whereas other champions of the time weren't taking so called ""grand slam breaks."" I think Borg was very winning, which is a good thing, but it's very limited and not as versatile as say Djokovic who has been one of the few in a long time that have been the likeliest to get a Calendar Grand Slam. Another reason why I'm against Borg is because it was such a long time ago. We're in a new wave of tennis, if you will, where it's just a lot harder, people play completely different, balls are hit so faster, no one serves and volleys, the competition is way harder (tennis isn't an elitist sport and so many more people have access to it and are playing). I honestly think it's near impossible to compare players of Bjorn's era to players of today. The players of today are playing a different game."
tennis,3d0yjk,zaczac14,2,Sun Jul 12 23:10:00 2015 UTC,No one really played the Australian back then. McEnroe was probably the first one to popularize playing that major during that era of players. Can't really blame Borg for that.
tennis,3d0yjk,tennisboy123,8,Sun Jul 12 23:34:01 2015 UTC,no Rod Laver?
tennis,3d0yjk,zaczac14,5,Sun Jul 12 16:49:14 2015 UTC,Most of his slams came before the open era.
tennis,3d0yjk,spaldingnoooo,7,Sun Jul 12 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"But he still did the calendar Grand Slam in 1969 though. Makes you wonder how many he would've won had he not gone professional in the early 1960s.  Edit: It's actually almost 50-50 for his Grand Slams. 6 pre-Open era, 5 in the Open era. And in the 5 years doing the professional versions of the grand slams, he only didn't make a final once."
tennis,3d0yjk,APookIsAPook,9,Sun Jul 12 17:13:25 2015 UTC,"well most tennis experts agree on that djokovic is the most complete player off all time, even bollitieri says it and he was watched all the eras unfold"
tennis,3d0yjk,virtu333,5,Sun Jul 12 18:04:38 2015 UTC,net game?!
tennis,3d0yjk,RelevantRoll,3,Sun Jul 12 18:17:05 2015 UTC,what about it? he has improved it tremendously after getting together with becker and his serve has been perfected into a much better weapon than it was before
tennis,3d0yjk,tennisboy123,-10,Sun Jul 12 18:42:20 2015 UTC,the net game isnt really important anymore
tennis,3d0yjk,asm129,6,Sun Jul 12 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"it might not be as important as it used to, but still has to be considered when judging someone's overall game, no? much respect for novak but coming to the net sometimes he looks really clumsy, no doubt he can compensate this with many other weapons"
tennis,3d0yjk,backhandsmashtastic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:03:46 2015 UTC,He looks clumsy walking up to forehands too. I think in general his footwork is something he could work on a lot more.
tennis,3d0yjk,pfc_bgd,2,Tue Jul 14 13:38:25 2015 UTC,His net game and serve have not been the best throughout his career.

tennis,3d0yjk,TimRattayGotScrewed,0,Sun Jul 12 21:49:18 2015 UTC,Erm... He hasn't even won the French Open yet. How the hell is he the most complete? Federer only owns pretty much every Open Era record.
tennis,3d0yjk,Noble_toaster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:05:23 2015 UTC,"lol federer was lucky to win the french i will say novak is top 5 greatest clay cpurter of all time definetly better than fed (look master record) and also only one that could challenge nadal for the last 4-5 years on clay, his statistics indicate that he will win rg in future maybe even 2 or 3 times, it was just unlucky he didnt win it this year having to play 3 days inarow"
tennis,3d0yjk,Leopoldstrasse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:53:20 2015 UTC,"Djokovic is getting to at least 13 Slams.  He's going to win or at least be in the Final at the AO every year and he makes deep runs at every other major. I think he's going to be #1 for at least another 2 years.   When he gets to 13, I think you have to rank him above Sampras because he has a more complete game, won big clay tournaments, and faced probably the top 2 players of all time in Nadal and Federer. Wouldn't that be something if the top 3 players of all time were those 3 guys all playing right now?"
tennis,3d0yjk,UKDaza,3,Mon Jul 13 05:19:42 2015 UTC,Most definitely.
tennis,3d0yjk,gibisee4,6,Sun Jul 12 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"He absolutely does. But he still has a lot of tennis left in him, enough to put him in the GOAT conversation and enough for an epic meltdown where he doesn't win another grand slam (both of these are extreme and unlikely cases, but you never know).   But, let's say that he retires tomorrow, I am not sure if he's top 5, but you can def make an argument for it."
tennis,3d0yjk,cmd242,9,Sun Jul 12 18:58:26 2015 UTC,Yes. He's dominating in an era with arguably 2 of the greatest of all time and is likely to be more successful in years to come. I think the nature of his game is the only aspect that will prevent observers from eventually reach a consensus on him being the greatest at the end of his career.
tennis,3d0yjk,SureAviator,3,Sun Jul 12 17:43:41 2015 UTC,"So first it was Federer, then it was Nadal, and then it was Djokovic? Does anyone else see a problem here?  I think it's pretty obvious that the era is inflating a select few individuals' numbers. I don't mean that to mean ""weak era,"" so much as an era that just makes the playing field different compared to past eras. The homogenized surfaces and the seeding 32 players, I mean. Federer and Djokovic can make every SF because they can't play the 17th seed in the 1st round. And grass is hardcourt is clay.  Imagine Ivan Lendl on today's grass. He'd be a Wimbledon GOAT candidate."
tennis,3d0yjk,cmd242,2,Mon Jul 13 04:22:55 2015 UTC,Doesn't this happen in every sport? Only time will tell to see what happens but each generation has a best player in the sport with an argument for being the GOAT.

tennis,3d0yjk,mppalmares,17,Sun Jul 12 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe cool it with that. He's barely halfway to Federer's slam count. When Fed was 28 he had already won 16 slams. Djokovic would need to keep at this level (winning 2 slams per year) until he's 32 just to match Federer. Only 4 slams in the open era have been won by anyone older than 30."
tennis,3d0yjk,TimRattayGotScrewed,-3,Sun Jul 12 20:34:09 2015 UTC,He beat a 34 year old past his prime. Novak will not be playing like this when he is 34.

tennis,3d0yjk,Atlaffinity75,8,Sun Jul 12 18:28:25 2015 UTC,"who he has/is/will be facing doesn't matter...  if he gets to 15-16-17 slams, it'll be highly debatable if he's the GOAT. Will he get there? I dunno, it'll be very difficult."
tennis,3d0yjk,MetalKeirSolid,0,Sun Jul 12 18:40:00 2015 UTC,If he wins the calander year slam and wins 15 total slams then he is the GOAT hands down. That's the only thing riding on the line that CYGS

tennis,3d1736,Ersatz_Okapi,-1,Mon Jul 13 15:15:28 2015 UTC,Can Nadal even be considered part of the Big Four? I say Stanislas the Manislas takes his place as Nadal has been mostly absent for all of 2015 so far.
tennis,3d1736,daftroses,12,Mon Jul 13 23:11:45 2015 UTC,"Djokovic is the best at meeting them in tournaments. I think he'll retire having been the player Nadal faced the most, the opponent Federer had faced the most and the player Murray has faced the most in their careers."

tennis,3d1736,HiImCharlotte,13,Sun Jul 12 18:00:24 2015 UTC,As a Murray fan I hate myself for laughing at this.
tennis,3d1736,NeuralRust,7,Sun Jul 12 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"They're all pretty much good at everything. That said:  Novak: Unbelievable returner, by far his most notable shot. Also the best mover in terms of athleticism, and his DTL backhand is likely the best of the four.  Federer: Best server by some margin, also has the best footwork/balance, best volleys (inc. overheads) and arguably the best slice.  Nadal: Forehand. It is the cornerstone of his game and nobody has ever defended the BH corner like he does. DTL forehand was particularly consistent. Also an underrated volleyer, and his speed was unreal in his pomp.  Murray: Easily the best lobber, CC backhand is likely the best, and he rivals Federer in the slice stakes."
tennis,3d1736,avaliantheel,5,Mon Jul 13 00:05:21 2015 UTC,In his prime I would have Roger's forehand over Nadal's but I can't fault anyone for going the other way.
tennis,3d1736,NeuralRust,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:57:27 2015 UTC,They're such radically different shots that it's hard to make comparisons! I could easily go the other way on a different day too. Both spectacular shots.
tennis,3d1736,YoSoyMilkChocolate,3,Mon Jul 13 08:27:02 2015 UTC,Djokovic's crosscourt backhand and footwork/balance are easily the best.
tennis,3d1736,NeuralRust,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:06:16 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see the former. The latter is true currently but Federer's balance during his prime years was terrifying...not sure I could agree with you there. It's tough to judge though, difficult to compare across 'mini-eras' with different competition."
tennis,3d1736,asm129,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:25:37 2015 UTC,I think Nadal's forehand and Djoker's returns are the biggest weapons out of all of those. Federer's serve is great but it's too inconsistent at times.    Federer's forehand is great too and I'd rank it just below Nadal's forehand.
tennis,3d1736,avaliantheel,7,Mon Jul 13 05:29:54 2015 UTC,"If we are talking about players in their prime, this would be my list.  Roger: Serve, forehand, footwork, volleys, backhand slice, half volleys, ability to hit shots that would otherwise be unimaginable.    Nadal: Counterpunching ability, legs, pulling his underwear out (sorry, couldn't resist)  Murray: Defense  Djokovic: Backhand, depth on the ball (I swear no matter where he is on the court, every shot he hits always goes at least 3/4ths of the court deep), service return, stamina"

He's obviously evolved now, but his excellent defense that he displays now was borne out of his original counter-punching game-plan. Clearly, he's developed his shot making since 2007.

Nadal: Running Forehand, Running Backhand, Defense, Iron Will. Djokovic: Stationary Backhand, Serve Returns, Movement, Sliding Shots, Stamina, Drop Shots. Murray: Lobs?

Every era has its former greats and aging champions, young guns and rising stars, as well as top players in their absolute prime. Not all players' careers are going to overlap perfectly to create a so-called ""strong era"". Djokovic is only making this era look weak because he is playing incredibly, just as Federer made his competition look weak when he was in his prime. People even talk about Nadal competing in a weak clay court era. Once again, it's just that Nadal made his competition look weak because he was an absolute machine on clay in his prime."

tennis,3d26b7,tomoniki,6,Sun Jul 12 23:09:06 2015 UTC,"If you look at Federer's greatest years 04-06 (8 of his titles), most of those finals were in an era of talent no different than today. I think people don't realize how much of a freak situation we had from 08-12 with these 3 men being so utterly dominant.   Without Djokovic right now we might have Murray holding 5 GS, Stan might have 4 and who knows what else would have happened. We'd then be talking about how great an era it is with these 3-4 guys winning all the slams!   Novak has just dominated at a level similar to Fed did early in his career where no one else could rise to that level of dominance. Without Federer in the mid 2000's we'd be raving about another 2-3 guys being great players."
tennis,3d26b7,Jobin1616,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:26:48 2015 UTC,I don't think that's the case. I believe that the top 10 players are as strong now as they were 5-10 years ago. I even think the depth in the top 50 has stayed relatively similar.

Federer played a ridiculously good game against Murray a few days ago, so I would hardly call it a meltdown for Andy.   He will always be able to snatch wins off of Djokovic, Federer, and even look convincing, but he will never do it consistently and will always be a rung below them. Still doesn't take away from his ability, he is well deserving of his current #3 ranking, his physical and mental game is too good for the rest, however he isn't god tier like Djokovic."

tennis,3d0jdi,somang2015,5,Sun Jul 12 14:51:40 2015 UTC,"Murray can definitely beat Djokovic or Federer, but it seems just not consistently. It has always appeared obvious to me that he is not as talented physically as the other big four greats but rather he is just a cut below and he can rival and beat them at times. He seems mentally weaker as well. I know people dismiss his fits and displays of abjection as part of his character and culture, but he projects mental fragility and one wonders how much that corresponds to internal fragility. I know many Murray fans believe he is their equal in all respects but we've had nearly a decade now of trails that show that's not the case and one must not translate hopeful potential into expectation.

But the pressure on her to succeed was too much and she ended up getting into trouble off the courts. She left tennis for a bit, but came back, stronger than ever and won a few grand slams. She was dominant for a short while, but never achieved what she could have accomplished because of being forced into the game at an age that couldn't handle the adult demands of the profession. I'm glad she came back after her hiatus, though, because she showed everyone that she wasn't just a fluke. Capriati had phenomenal talent and was a brilliant player."

She has also frequently fought off racism (not just in Compton; from her fellow players too), batantly biased umpiring (which led to the introduction of Hawk-eye) and vicious, derogatory comments from the people who call themselves fans of the sport.  Through all of that, she has maintained her composure, stuck to her guns, and kept winning. And to me, that is a career worth taking inspiration from, irrespective of how many people she has unintentionally rubbed wrong along the way.

And Novak is better now but let's not forget that he used to be known for his frequent retirements/excuses and racquet smashing.   The only reason people give Serena shit for it is because she's a woman.

I think by the end of his career he'll probs be top 5 of all time, but he's still gotta win a few more slams and break a few more records, which I think he will. He's already at 9 now and I feel like he's only just getting started."

tennis,3d2py7,brit314,2,Mon Jul 13 11:31:53 2015 UTC,"Several people are saying he is top 10 but I think you must factor in that he is playing at the same time as Federer and Nadal. So I think he is already sixth best all time. If he wins 2 more slams he will legitimately be fourth. That seems very possible. I am not sure he can get higher than that. Federer, Sampras, Nadal have too many slams."
tennis,3d2py7,bustedracquet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:01:52 2015 UTC,"Top 5 for sure. People always like to look at Slams, but look at some other numbers that Novak has accumulated across his career. He's got the sixth most weeks ever at World No. 1 (soon to be 5, as he'll pass McEnroe in a few months since he's already got No. 1 locked up for the rest of this year), and he's probably going to go down with the most Masters 1000 titles of anybody. He's only a few behind Rafa right now, but I think he'll pass him because Novak is better across all the surfaces, and he's beaten Rafa at clay Masters 1000 events in 4 out of the last 5 years."

tennis,3d4cpz,CityofIndustry,4,Mon Jul 13 14:09:51 2015 UTC,"BINGO!  Fed's going to get more and more criticism, the longer he plays ... some from people who never saw him play in his prime and some from haters who ignore or don't understand it."
tennis,3d4cpz,Sebastien447,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:33:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, the people who saw him play in his prime who think he was better are usually people who haven't watched his matches from his prime again. He's a better player today in all areas. Serve, forehand, backhand, volleys, return, and tactics. I suppose he might have had a bit more quickness when he was younger, but it's not glaring."

tennis,3d4cpz,ADM31,2,Mon Jul 13 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"Yes he shanks balls, etc, and has some hilarious errors. But when we say he is graceful, we mean his play style, his strokes and footwork look effortless! They are so fluid and smooth.   On the modern courts, I agree today's Fed would beat 2006 Fed since the game has changed a lot. But I'm sure you agree Fed doesn't play rallies like he used to. He used to run and try to get every ball back, now he simply let opponents hit winners (to save energy? avoid injury?)."
tennis,3d4cpz,TimRattayGotScrewed,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"I think he's still one of the premier defensive players ever. I'd put him up there with the other 3 (Djokovic, Murray, Nadal). Probably on grass he's the best mover, but it's not enough. Djokovic defends and moves nearly as well on grass, and has can absorb most of Fed's punches, he simply makes fewer errors and is more offensive off of his returns (esp 2nd serve).  Djokovic simply outplayed him in the last 2 sets in the final. Federer didn't play badly."
tennis,3d4cpz,TimRattayGotScrewed,2,Mon Jul 13 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"The Fed of today would crush the 2006-08 Fed.   06-08? What about 04-06? Why the hell would anyone care about the 2008 Federer who won no big titles other than the US Open that year? He was getting beaten right and left.  Anyway, if you want to argue that Djokovic would have beaten 04-06 Federer, that can be debated. Djokovic has become an impenetrable wall with a tremendously accurate serve. There doesn't seem to be any place to go against him, unless the conditions are quick enough to hit through him, mostly with the serve. Or unless you have enough unnatural strength endurance to hit out every shot against him, as Wawrinka does.   But saying the Federer of today would beat the old Federer...apart from being a silly concept in the first place, it's flat-out ridiculous. The current Federer might be able to keep it close if he serves the way he did against Murray. And that's it. 2004-2006 Federer was better in every other area.  His forehand used to be lethal, not a pusher shot that he nets more than a dozen times each match on routine balls and shanks on others. He had explosive footwork and then would have a high takeback and unload. His backhand was a weapon against everyone not named Nadal. I think yesterday's match was a perfect illustration of the idea that Federer improved his backhand ""thanks to the new racket"" being a joke. Hitting nice backhands against players not named Nadal and Djokovic means absolutely nothing - he ALWAYS did that. Watch him against Blake at the Masters Cup 2006, or even against Agassi in their matches in 03-05. He made a bazillion errors with it and couldn't do any damage in the match with Djokovic yesterday.   Not to mention, his slice also used to be better.  And the movement isn't close. Federer can't hit a running forehand to save his life anymore. He hasn't been able to post-2009...if he could even hit one in 2009, I can't remember. His running forehand used to be devastating, of course.   And he could crush inside-out forehands from the back of the court. He didn't need a mid-court reply after a serve to do it.  As for the shanks - that's a bi-product of his playing style. He stands on the baseline and takes it early. When you do that, the slightest mistiming can lead to a complete mishit. This was always especially pronounced in the matches with Nadal because Nadal gets such wicked bounce on his shots."
tennis,3d4cpz,TimRattayGotScrewed,0,Mon Jul 13 20:47:19 2015 UTC,"The entire field is better now. There's no argument about that really. And because Federer has managed to stay in the conversation means that he's better too. He just isn't good enough to go win a slam without some breaks going his way. And all the things you mentioned, he did it against lesser opposition, against people who couldn't defend like a Nadal, Djoker, Murray, Nishikori, Ferrer etc.  The current top level players are head & shoulders above the players even from a few years ago. It's scary."
tennis,3d4cpz,TimRattayGotScrewed,0,Mon Jul 13 21:10:38 2015 UTC,"Sure there's an argument about that. Federer isn't better, and he's #2 behind Djokovic. What has Murray done lately? Lose to a 33 and 11 month old Federer in straight sets? Beat a Nadal who lost all his big clay turnaments this year? That's your #3.   How has Nadal done off clay in recent years, especially on grass? Does losing 4 consecutive years to players ranked outside the Top 100 sound like he's gotten better to you?  Ferrer...how has he improved anything? He's from Federer's generation. His ascension to the Top 10 seems to indicate a lack of depth in men's tennis more than anything else.   Nishikori hasn't won anything substantial yet. He beat a post-marriage lull Djokovic last year in the US Open. What's so great about him? He hasn't shown himself to be as good as Davydenko yet.  Federer did it against Hewitt, one of the greatest movers of all-time. He did it against a young, more explosive Nadal who was able to make Wimbledon finals, not a Nadal who can't beat guys ranked outside the Top 100 on grass. He beat great shotmaking talents such as Nalbandian and Safin at their best in shotmaking contests. He did it to baseline machines like Davydenko. Defused a Roddick hitting 140 MPH serves and 100 MPH forehands.   Meanwhile, Servebot Raonic is Top 10. He'd kill to be as good as Andy Roddick was."
tennis,3d4cpz,ConvertsToMetric,0,Mon Jul 13 22:25:24 2015 UTC,"OK, your arguments are pretty easy to take down.  Hewitt: Are you serious ?? This man got to #1 in the world. Sure he's a good mover, but to compare him to even Nishikori is a joke. You clearly haven't watched these guys play objectively. A prime Hewitt would never be a contender for a slam today. Why do I say that ? His results against his peers; he would lose on average to lower ranked players more often. Even a Ferrer rarely loses to anyone ranked significantly below him. He just has trouble with the upper 4-5 players.  Nadal: He's clearly in decline for now. His ranking reflects that.   Nalbandian: Unfit player, who couldn't really keep it going. Again someone who would lose to nobodies and then beat high ranked players.  Roddick: His serve alone would make him a contender. His forehand was no longer feared as he went on.  But the returners (including Federer) are better now.  Based on various stats like results against lower ranked players, service return percentage, break points saved/won, etc, the field is better now than before.   Unless what you're saying is people have forgotten to serve etc. Hell, you can't survive without at least a decent serve now (below top 100). To win slams you also have to move, defend, return serve, and break serve better than most of the field.  Every other sport is the same, why would tennis be different ? Are you saying that the past 100m sprint champ was better than today's ? That's objectively ridiculous."

He lost another in the final to Safin. The other 2 were French Opens, and Hewitt was not a great clay court player. As I've said before, if anything, it was a weak clay era. That's all. Didn't help Federer much, since he wasn't the guy winning all the clay titles.   Then Hewitt developed foot problems and he fell off.    Nadal declining   Yeah, which helps to establish that he peaked earlier and the idea of him being ""pre-prime"" when he was making Wimbledon finals and losing them to Federer is laughable.    Nalbandian   And that's how tennis always used to be. The top players easily going through every single draw is a completely new phenomenon in tennis. One we see because of the seedings, the lack of depth, and the slowing of the surfaces to make the style of play homogenized.    Roddick...returners including Federer are better now   LOL, what? Federer is a better returner now? Are you insane? Sorry, reflexes do not improve as you get older. And if the returners are better now, why does Djokovic struggle with big servers? Isn't he supposed to be one of the best returners in tennis?    Based on various stats like results against lower ranked players, service return percentage, break points saved/won, etc, the field is better now than before.    This is circular logic that assumes the lower ranked players are as good as they've always been. It also fails to acknowledge the slowing of surfaces, the homogenized conditions that allow the guys who excel most on a given condition to excel year-round, etc.   Unless what you're saying is people have forgotten to serve etc. Hell, you can't survive without at least a decent serve now (below top 100). To win slams you also have to move, defend, return serve, and break serve better than most of the field.   Until last year, every single slam since 2005 French Open had been won by one of the top 4 guys, with only one exception - Del Potro - in a match Federer truly never should have lost. What's so strong about a field of 3 other Grand Slam contenders than you?   Every other sport is the same, why would tennis be different ?

tennis,3d4cpz,reedsparks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:30:43 2015 UTC,"100m runners: Tyson Gay is nearly 34. And is a world class competitor. Definitely not past his prime. 2nd fastest time ever behind Usain Bolt who's 30, and is the current world record holder.  Of course, you will have players that decline after a few years and yes in tennis that tends to be in the early 30s, but if you are ranked #2 in the world, it does mean you are competing at the very top. And yes that does mean that you are better than someone ranked #2 5 years ago, definitely 10 years ago at their prime.  The surfaces have gotten closer, so you have fewer specialists, that I will grant you. And it does skew things a bit, it's another unknown variable.  Djokovic against big servers. He's 13-0 against Cilic, 5-0 against Raonic, 1-3 against Karlovic. Not too shabby.  By your logic, if you didn't win a gold medal at the Olympics at 100m, you're not that fast. You can run a sub 10-second 100m and not even qualify sometimes. You're equating results with objective excellence. It is a fact that even the high-school runner of today would beat the world record holder from many decades ago. Is s/he not fast ? Not if you measure it with gold medals, as you seem to be doing."
tennis,3d4cpz,Mr_Evil_MSc,0,Tue Jul 14 19:16:45 2015 UTC,"All his personal bests are from 2010 and prior. Same with Usain Bolt.   You seem to be missing the fact that the style of tennis played on most surfaces has changed dramatically, making whatever improvements have taken place (athletic ability) incongruent with whatever improvements would have taken place had the old style continued to be played. 10 years ago, guys were shotmakers, trying to hit winners, trying to use variety to construct points and attack. They weren't hitting 47 shot rallies, and they weren't trying to. Federer was the guy improving on the Samprases.  But what you see now isn't improvement on the Federers. It's guys playing a different sport and improving on that new sport. Now, tennis is a baseline rally-fest.   Federer has NOT improved his shotmaking. Nor is the level of shotmaking superior today. You know why? Because shotmaking is mostly dead. The guys who still play that style can be successful in the right conditions (courts that aren't slow as molasses), as Federer has sometimes shown, but he's not nearly as good as he used to be at it. And most of the guys from that era are retired or nearly retired.  The newer generation developed their games to be Djokovic and Nadal clones (well, without Nadal's heavy top spin). You have three types of baseline ralliers - the counterpunchers, the power baseliners, and the counterpunch/power hybrids. And the variety is borderline non-existent.   Power baseliners: Berdych, Wawrinka (might consider him a shotmaker, but he's kind of stilted in how he constructs points), Cilic, Anderson, Raonic, Del Potro Counterpunchers: Simon, Murray, Goffin Hybrids: Djokovic, Ferrer, Nadal, Nishikori, Monfils, Batista-Agut Shotmakers: Federer, Tsonga, Gasquet  Now, has the clay court level picked up in recent years? I'd say it obviously has. Guys can hit long, clay court-style rallies better than before. Shotmaking? Nope. Nobody's tried to improve on it in since Federer and his generation were doing it."
tennis,3d4cpz,Eagled1001,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:34:57 2015 UTC,"Tennis has changed, I'll grant you that. It evolved from baseline tennis to serve volley, and then as the strings changed the game (the biggest change IMO), back to a baseline game.  The slower surfaces don't help either.  Shotmaking isn't dead, it just doesn't win on a consistent basis. Wawrinka did it at the French Open, Soderling did it to Nadal at the French too. I'd say the defense (+ poly strings) has a lot to do with the death of serve-volley, and short points.  The problem with Federer is that his power level isn't high enough. He doesn't hit 100mph forehands; I think he makes too many errors when he redlines his game.  I don't believe he can hit through Djokovic like Wawrinka did.  But the tennis players of today are superior than from 5 years ago, definitely from 10, 20 years ago.  And if you think some 18-20 yr old is going to win at the 100m you are sorely mistaken. It's almost always a late 20s-30+ year old. (fastest time this year: Justin Gatlin, 33 yrs old)"

Wish the authors would have calculated the time it takes to reach baseline to baseline, just curious as to how much time you have to react even with the ball slowing down.  I guess they gave the speeds at various points on the court, so maybe someone savvy can calculate it?"
tennis,3cx42w,NinjaSpecter,34,Sat Jul 11 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"The following is an approximation which assumes that the serve hits the service line, the velocity drops from 103 mph to 85 mph immediately post-bounce, and models the decreasing velocity of the ball due to air resistance as exponential decay.  Given exponential decay, we can write the velocity as a function of time as    v(t) = vi * exp( ln(vf/vi)/t0 * t )  where vi is the initial velocity, vf is the final velocity, and t0 is the time it takes to decay from vi to vf.  Then we can solve for t0 with a known vi, vf, and D (distance traveled) with the following: Integral from 0 to t0 of v(t) dt = D.  After some math I won't go into we get t0 = ln(vi/vf) * D / (vi-vf). Now, let's break up the problem into two parts.   Part 1: The server's baseline to the returner's service line. The distance D1 = 60 feet. Converting speeds, we get vi = 150 mph = 220 ft/s and vf = 103 mph = 151 ft/s. Solving for time, we get t1 = ln(220/151) * 60 / (220-151) = .327 seconds  Part 2: The returner's service line to the returner's baseline. The distance D2 = 18 feet. Converting speeds, we get vi = 85 mph = 125 ft/s and vf = 73 mph = 107 ft/s. Solving for time, we get t2 = ln(125/107) * 18 / (125-107) = .156 seconds  So it takes about 1/3 of a second to bounce and less than half that to reach the baseline, for a total time elapsed T = t1 + t2 = .483 seconds  EDIT: Forgot that the velocities are not horizontal velocities. However, after a quick calculation, the ratio of horizontal velocity to full velocity is 98-99%, so the velocity adjustment does not have a large effect and the fact that it would slow the time elapsed means it is likely countered by the fact that the serve contact point is usually inside the baseline by about a foot."
tennis,3cx42w,dezholling,7,Sat Jul 11 17:45:53 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks for the calculation!  Less than half a second, wow.  Given that it takes about 200 ms for an average human to react, you have less than a quarter second to swing"
tennis,3cx42w,NinjaSpecter,9,Sat Jul 11 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, but pros are anything but average. I would wager most tennis players have better than average reaction times, with the best reactions on players with great returns and volleys.  Also, I don't think you really would ""swing"" at a 150 mph serve. ;)"
tennis,3cx42w,dezholling,11,Sat Jul 11 18:16:20 2015 UTC,And 150mph is a complete outlier. Federer's average first serve speed is around 120mph.
tennis,3cx42w,mathen,6,Sat Jul 11 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"And they don't always have to react to the ball specifically. Some times they can get tells from toss, body angle or the racquet face. A lot of those amazing returns you see are players guessing right."
tennis,3cx42w,Explosive_Diaeresis,4,Sat Jul 11 21:32:14 2015 UTC,This isn't necessarily true. I did a survey and talked with some pro gamers who click and perform actions at an incredible rate. I expected them to have a much better reaction rate than average. However they had an average of around 220ms while the general gaming population had about 240ms. Nothing significant. The difference comes in experience and prediction rather than reaction rate usually

Does it just work out that exponential decay is a close enough approximation?"
tennis,3cx42w,dventurino,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:32:47 2015 UTC,"If drag force is proportional to velocity, then acceleration a(t) = k * v(t), where k < 0 to indicate a slowing ball.

In the case above, I used the distances and velocities given to calculate k = ln(vf/vi) / t0 = - (vi-vf) / D."

tennis,3cx42w,mathen,18,Sat Jul 11 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous how fast some serves are.  I went to undergrad at USC and took the tennis course every semester.  I was in the intermediate group, which means you're OK.  I can go out and keep the ball moving and have fun.  One year, the men's team won the national championship.  They invited the tennis classes over to play with them for a bit.  I went up against a couple of guys with 120+ MPH serves.   Holy crap.  I don't have the reaction time to deal with that.  Aced every time.  I'm just thankful the game can be played and enjoyed at a lower level."
tennis,3cx42w,Uncle_Erik,8,Sat Jul 11 19:59:18 2015 UTC,"You definitely get used to, still feels like you won the whole match when you hit a good return though.  I was playing some mixed against him and he just obliterated the ball past my (woman) partner, we just looked at each other like ""what can you do"".  And then you have to take into account that the pros are hitting this hard consistently, with crazy spin, within 30cm of the lines, every time.   The guy I'm talking about can hit it really hard, but he'll get maybe an ace every couple of games because he has to sacrifice placement."
tennis,3cx42w,mathen,3,Sat Jul 11 20:16:08 2015 UTC,"I played club tennis in college with a guy who could top out at 125 or so. I would practice with him sometimes and it was insane trying to return them. I only got a racket on it about half the time, and got it back less than that."

tennis,3czsmq,nonothebigonebigone,19,Sun Jul 12 12:37:55 2015 UTC,"Rafter is such a dickwad. The top 2 players in the country are good friends who enjoy playing together and instead of mentoring them and helping them build their game, he runs his mouth and destroys the team dynamic. If the top 2 players think their coach is a fucking clown, maybe the coach is the problem. IMO fire the whole Tennis Australia organisation and start from scratch."
tennis,3czsmq,Bamkill,0,Sun Jul 12 12:47:59 2015 UTC,The top 2 players that think their coach is a clown are both known to be huge twats so their opinions on this subject dont mean that much to me.
tennis,3czsmq,kyles24,4,Sun Jul 12 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"So the solution is for Rafter to sacrifice the success of the Davis Cup team so he can stroke his ego. Kyrgios is a twat but Tomic has calmed down a lot since his younger years. However whether they are or aren't twats is irrelevant, they are still the best Australian players by a large margin. Turning the Davis cup team to complete shit is an interesting way of coaching/managing it."
tennis,3czsmq,Bamkill,2,Sun Jul 12 15:09:29 2015 UTC,"Dang man are you always this condescending? He's not stroking his ego at all, rather if he put them on the team it'd be stroking their egos and saying ""You guys can fuck up all you want, you'll still make it to this team"". I'm sure he knows better than some prick on /r/tennis that dropping his two best players isn't going to bode well. Dropping people for attitude issues is common throughout all sports, regardless of how good they are. Kyrgios and Tomic need to understand that they can't always get it their way. There's some common sense to be had here and long term it's a better decision by Rafter."
tennis,3czsmq,ThePangloss,7,Sun Jul 12 17:13:39 2015 UTC,"charging tomic, arguably the most important member of your davis cup team, for balls and court time is stroking your own ego saying ""I'm the big boss man""."

tennis,3cychs,supremechairumpire,36,Sat Jul 11 22:26:05 2015 UTC,"The betting odds favor Djokovic for a reason. I will be surprised if he doesn't beat Federer, as would most objective fans. Federer has a fanatical, vocal, and long-standing fanbase, which is very present on /r/tennis, but you are not the lone voice.   People rationalize their hopes in funny ways and I even see people saying Federer wants this more than Nole. The fact is we don't know who wants it more, and it may not matter, but after the FO loss I know the beast in Djokovic was awakened."

tennis,3cychs,bustedracquet,10,Sun Jul 12 05:16:22 2015 UTC,"FINALLY! Somebody who isn't on the Federer hype train. Seriously, I'll be rooting for Roger to win this match (and I normally don't pick between players, because I'm objective and I like everybody on the tour to be honest), but it's out of control how everybody is discounting Novak. The guy is the World No. 1, who has won 34 out of his last 35 matches, and the one loss was to a guy who played the best match of his life and out powered Novak from the baseline like nobody in the game has ever done before (something that Roger can't do by the way).   It's ridiculous how people have short term memories and forget last year's final. Roger made 70% of his first serves, won 77% of his first serve points won, served 29 aces against the best returner in the history of the game...and lost. And he was lucky to get it to a 5th set, as Novak was leading in the 4th set 5-2. It took him 3 1/2 sets last year to break Novak, and he didn't break Novak's serve at all in the other 4 sets. People are underestimating how good Novak's serve is and how good he's been this year."
tennis,3cychs,Stefolso,11,Sun Jul 12 02:24:12 2015 UTC,"but it's out of control how everybody is discounting Novak   The logic is: I like Federer, therefore I predict he will win. The funny part is when people try to justify these predictions with variables that are super speculative or could just as easily be countered by variables in favor of Djokovic. Anybody who favors either strongly is wrong, as it's just too close to call."
tennis,3cychs,bustedracquet,3,Sun Jul 12 03:21:30 2015 UTC,"Anybody who favors either strongly is wrong, as it's just too close to call.   Pretty sure the oddsmakers have Novak as a solid favorite, and I just don't get how the undisputed World No. 1 who has won 34 out of his last 35 matches and is the defending champion would be anything but the favorite.   Think about it, before this tournament, if you had asked most people who were going to win, the most people, and a surprising majority picked Djokovic to win the tournament on the /r/tennis bracket challenge. The only reason people's minds have changed is their getting caught up in the performance of one match. That should never be the barometer to change somebody's mind.  Obviously you're different because you're picking him because you like him. But I've seen many people pick on here purely based on how Roger is serving this tournament, and I'm trying to tell people that Roger served like this last year, and he still lost.  Also Novak is just playing better this year than he did last year, plain and simple."
tennis,3cychs,wallpaper_01,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:26:56 2015 UTC,Understand what you're saying. But last year was very close and fed is playing better this year. Fed is better than djokovic at his peak so I'm edging fed in this one.

tennis,3cychs,binks21,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:56:21 2015 UTC,"I like them both. Federer more than Djokovic, but I still think Novak has a slightly better chance today."
tennis,3cychs,c3vzn,3,Sun Jul 12 08:35:19 2015 UTC,Rain forecasted though. Which means indoor grass and you know that helps Fed's game quite a bit. I also think he's been playing better than last year even if you take out the serve. The execution of his aggressive tactics against Murray was something I haven't seen from him in a long while.
tennis,3cychs,bustedracquet,2,Sun Jul 12 02:38:22 2015 UTC,"If the roof is on, that will be a nice perk for Roger, but I'm not going to say that it's the ultimate advantage for Fed when Novak's won his last 30-odd matches indoors."

However, Roger definitely has looked better coming into the finals this year than last year imo."
tennis,3cychs,bustedracquet,2,Sun Jul 12 03:42:52 2015 UTC,"The other thing is I know that Novak will be in a better place mentally knowing that he withstood a great test from Roger last year and came out victorious, and don't forget last year, he was in a perilous place mentally having not won a Slam since the 2013 AO, and losing multiple big matches to Rafa at RG (twice), Andy at Wimbledon, and Rafa again at the US Open, and Stan at the AO. It had been awhile since he had won a Slam and I believe those kind of nerves as well as Roger playing outstanding, led to that epic 4th set turnaround where Roger won 5 straight games to take the set."
tennis,3cychs,rbace,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:12:05 2015 UTC,i don't see anyone discounting novak. Fighting demons that aren't there. I would say personally 60-40 Novak. Novak has to play great though because Fed is playing better off the ground than last year.
tennis,3cychs,redditacc2015,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:45:40 2015 UTC,"Fed's serve is what gave him a chance last year and this year it's even better whilst his movement and shot making is a few levels above.

tennis,3cychs,Lalaxp,3,Sun Jul 12 10:22:30 2015 UTC,"Head-to-Head:   Novak Djokovic (SRB, 1) and Roger Federer (SUI, 2) will meet in the 2015 Wimbledon final, a replay of last year's final. These players have met 39 times before with Federer having a slight edge winning 20 to Djokovic's 19. This is the second most played tennis rivalry in the Open era after Djokovic-Nadal (44). Djokovic beat Federer in four of their last six Grand Slam meetings (2011-2014). The Swiss won four of their first six Grand Slam meetings (2007-2010). They have met twice before in a Grand Slam final. Federer won his fourth US Open title in 2007 by beating Djokovic in straight sets while the Serb won last year's Wimbledon final against the Swiss in five. Their only other meeting on grass came in the 2012 Wimbledon semifinal, when Federer won. Both players have former Wimbledon champions as their coach. Boris Becker (Djokovic) and Stefan Edberg (Federer) met in three Wimbledon finals (1988, 1989, 1990), with Edberg winning in 1988 and 1990. Head-to-Head overview: http://i.imgur.com/41UcUZd.png   Novak Djokovic (SRB, 1):   Novak Djokovic has reached his 17th Grand Slam final, overtaking Björn Borg in fifth place in the Open era. Roger Federer (26), Rafael Nadal (20), Ivan Lendl (19) and Pete Sampras (18) make up the top-4. Djokovic has now reached the final in 15 of the last 20 Grand Slam tournaments he has taken part in. Djokovic has reached his fourth Wimbledon final, winning two of the previous three (2011, 2014). Djokovic can become the first player to win back-to-back Wimbledon titles since Roger Federer's five consecutive titles between 2003 and 2007. Djokovic can win his third Wimbledon title, after winning the title in 2011 and 2014, joining John McEnroe and his current coach Boris Becker in fourth place in the Open era. Only Roger Federer (7), Pete Sampras (7) and Björn Borg (5) have won more Wimbledon titles. A win at Wimbledon would give Djokovic his ninth Grand Slam win, surpassing Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi to become the player with fifth most Grand Slam titles in the Open era. The only players with more titles are Roger Federer (17), Pete Sampras (14), Rafael Nadal (14) and Björn Borg (11). Djokovic has won eight and lost eight Grand Slam finals. There are only three players in the Open era with multiple Grand Slam wins but who have a negative balance in GS finals: Ivan Lendl (8-11), Andy Murray (2-6) and Ilie Nastase (2-3).   Roger Federer (SUI, 2):   Roger Federer has reached the Wimbledon final for the 10th time, breaking Rafael Nadal's record of most finals in one Grand Slam (9, French Open). Roger Federer and Pete Sampras share the record of seven Wimbledon wins in men's singles in the Open era. William Renshaw won the tournament seven times during the late 19th century, in the amateur era. If Federer wins Wimbledon for the eighth time, he will join Rafael Nadal as the only players having won a single Grand Slam at least eight times in the Open era. Nadal won his eigth French Open title in 2013, and his ninth title in 2014. Federer has reached his 26th Grand Slam final, having won a record 17 of the previous 25 (8 defeats). Only Ivan Lendl has lost more Grand Slam finals in the Open era with 11 defeats. Federer's last Grand Slam win came at Wimbledon in 2012, making it his only win in his last 21 Grand Slam participations. In 19 Major appearances prior to this streak he won 12 titles. Federer has won an Open era record 15 grass court titles, leading Pete Sampras (10), Jimmy Connors (9), John McEnroe and Lleyton Hewitt (both 8). At 33 years of age, Federer can become the oldest Wimbledon winner in the Open era. This record is now held by Arthur Ashe, winning the tournament in 1975 at 31 years of age. Oldest Wimbledon winners in the Open era so far: http://i.imgur.com/hL75ssr.png Federer can become the fifth player in the Open era with multiple Grand Slam titles after turning 30, after Ken Rosewall (4), Rod Laver (4), Andre Agassi (2) and Jimmy Connors (2)."
tennis,3cychs,supremechairumpire,15,Sun Jul 12 10:26:46 2015 UTC,"ITT: Federer fans predict Federer will win. Nole fans predict Nole will win. They are my two favorite players, so I'd be happy with either.  My prediction: Djokovic takes it in 5.  Reasons: Novak is a better returner than Andy. If you watch last year's match, he got a lot of serves back that Federer painted on the T. Further, Nole's serve has been fantastic. Tough call though, could go either way."
tennis,3cychs,ChaeDoc_II,8,Sat Jul 11 22:35:39 2015 UTC,Novak is a better returner than Andy.   If he is the better returner then it isn't so clearly demonstrated by their return statistics.  Djokovic    Murray

Djokovic Murray   Actually it is clearly demonstrated that Novak is the better returner. I have looked at that before. Look at 1st and 2nd Serve Return Points Won, and Total Points Won at the bottom. If you go back to 2011 when Novak became the player he is today, and look at Total Points Won he is the better returner, and the same holds when you look at their respective career numbers:  2011 Andy: 54 Novak: 56  2012 Andy: 54 Novak: 55  2013 Andy: 54 Novak: 56  2014 Andy: 53 Novak: 55  2015 Andy: 54 Novak: 56  Career: Andy: 53 Novak: 54  Point construction and point results are what matter and this clearly demonstrates that Novak is the best returner in the game, while Andy is a close second.

tennis,3cychs,agareo,3,Sun Jul 12 11:24:16 2015 UTC,Oh GOD come on Fedex... I'm fucking hyped
tennis,3cychs,ASIC_SP,3,Sun Jul 12 12:32:18 2015 UTC,"Djokovic's 17th Grand Slam final (8-8) Federer's 26th Grand Slam final (17-8)   says it all, hope Fedex wins :) but I think Djoker will win"
tennis,3cychs,No1eFan,3,Sun Jul 12 12:33:26 2015 UTC,I hope both show up and we at least have a 5 setter. we deserve this!!
tennis,3cychs,sweetmatter,14,Sun Jul 12 12:38:23 2015 UTC,"While Roger is playing well, you guys can't underestimate Djokovic that much. There have been many 5 setters between these two, in which Roger has forced Djokovic to up his game to survive as the underdog. It's when he thrives. Don't forget that Novak has come from match-point down so many times and hit some of the greatest returns of all time against the Fed when needed (e.g. US Open 2010 and 2011). He's perfectly able to hold his ground against Federer. Furthermore, Djokovic's serve is no jerk-off. He's only been broken 5 times this entire tournament and lost 2 sets overall. With Federer serving like a God as well, I can see this turning into a something like the 2009 final. 5 sets with many tie-breakers.   So I wouldn't put my money on Federer winning in 3 sets as some of you have suggested. I'd put my money on 5 set happening, but not on any winner. The World #1 vs an in-form Federer is a very balanced match.   Hopefully Djokovic will win. He's seen too much pain in GS finals recently, and hopefully will add to his tally deservedly so."
tennis,3cychs,yourmominabag,5,Sat Jul 11 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"It's like Agassi vs Sampras.  Predicting Djokovic is going to take it in 5. Full disclosure, I appreciate Federer but I've never liked him, he's been growing on me in this tournament though. I want to say Nole in 3 or 4 but I'm going to say 5 because Federer looked great in the semi-finals, and Djokovic looked good but alright."
tennis,3cychs,bustedracquet,14,Sun Jul 12 02:46:07 2015 UTC,"If Federer plays at the same level as he did against murray, Djokovic will have trouble getting a set. When Federer holds his own serve so well it puts a lot of pressure on the historically weaker Djokovic serve. Federer in 3."
tennis,3cychs,Fartoholic,25,Sat Jul 11 22:13:21 2015 UTC,"That is bullshit. It's insane how short people's memories are. Roger served incredibly well last year in the final...AND LOST! He had 29 aces last year against the greatest returner of all-time, including 13 in the 3rd set, and guess what happened in that set? He lost it in a tiebreak.  The thing everybody is forgetting in this thread, because they are so caught up in the Federer hype train, is for one, that Novak Djokovic is better than Andy Murray, and does not have a puny second serve like Andy does, and secondly, it took Roger 3 1/2 SETS to break Novak last year. Novak's serve has improved a lot, both first and second, and it's the most underrated part of his game. Novak's serve is not historically weak, have you watched the last 5 years?   No chance Federer wins in 3."
tennis,3cychs,Personacorona,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:18:25 2015 UTC,Fair point but I feel like everything else apart from the serve has improved as well. I think he was even toe-to-toe against Murray in rallies.
tennis,3cychs,bustedracquet,2,Sun Jul 12 06:32:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, but aces aren't everything. Roger served 29 aces in 5 sets? He served 20 in 3 two days ago. And frankly while Djokovic is the best returner of all time he isn't necessarily the best at getting the ball back into play. And it wasn't the aces. Did you see where his serves were landing? Corners and lines everywhere."
tennis,3cychs,Stefolso,5,Sun Jul 12 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that he had a better serving match against Andy a few days ago, but it's silly to say that he didn't have a great serving day against Novak last year. I went back and watched the entirety of that match, and Roger won an overwhelming amount of points with unreturned first serves. All those corners and lines everywhere were there last year, Novak just got a higher % of them back in play because he's Novak. And Novak is one of the best at getting the ball back into play, that's what makes him such a great returner of serve, he can be both offensive or defensive. He knows when to just block the ball back into play, which he can do better than almost anyone due to his length, flexibility, and balance, and he knows when to be offensive and go for something on the return."
tennis,3cychs,ChaoticMidget,2,Sun Jul 12 04:19:15 2015 UTC,"If Federer plays at the same level as he did against murray, Djokovic will have trouble getting a set.    Uhh, Federer painted the lines last year and served incredibly well. Novak got a lot of serves back in that Andy didn't on Friday."
tennis,3cychs,ParoxysmOfReddit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:22:50 2015 UTC,It's easy for me to say this now since the match is over but I don't understand how a comment that suggested Djokovic would get straight setted was upvoted. He's been straight setted once in a slam final in his entire career.
tennis,3cychs,flat_tamales,2,Sun Jul 12 17:22:51 2015 UTC,"The Fed semi was all about dat serve, being supported by his very high allround game of this years grass court season. With over 70% first serves in both quarters and semis, without having his usual mid-set lapse of concentration/quality, I hope he can maintain that level for the final. If he plays as well as he did in parts of the Simon and Murray match, I think this might be his year once again.  As for Djoko, he didnt really get pushed in any of the matches ive seen in this years Wimby, so it will be interesting to see what gears he has available when the level is turned up. He has been the player with the highest average level on tour on any surface for a few years now, and if he plays his best I don't know if he can be beat.   But I really, really hope so. #Fed18"
tennis,3cychs,THAT_GIRL16,5,Sat Jul 11 22:19:28 2015 UTC,"Well, Djokovic did come back from 2 sets down (didn't lose his serve in either) against Anderson. That's a pretty good test if you ask me."

tennis,3cychs,DudeAsInCool,2,Sun Jul 12 07:09:50 2015 UTC,"I'd like Fed to win and I think he could do it because he had an easier run to the final. He wasn't pushed the way Nole was. Honestly though, as long as it is a good match I am ok with either winning. They are both quite deserving."

I think most people would give him the edge given is age, fitness, and consistency. But I'm definitely rooting for roger and #18. I'm doubtful that he will pull of the same level as against Murray, but if he can keep his nerves down and confidence up, it could happen in 4 like the 2012 semi."

tennis,3cychs,ElementalMagic,2,Sun Jul 12 00:35:09 2015 UTC,People said the same last year as well. Think Fed has at least another year left in him.
tennis,3cychs,jleonardbc,3,Sun Jul 12 12:51:40 2015 UTC,I don't know that it matters who wins; both of them will cry when it's over.
tennis,3cychs,Personacorona,3,Sat Jul 11 23:10:08 2015 UTC,Federer wins in 4. Federer wants this title more than Djokovic. To win another grand slam for him would be like winning the lottery for us. I'm not saying that Djokovic doesn't want it. I bet he does but he has so much more time to win another slam than Fed does.
tennis,3cychs,bumbleb333,3,Sun Jul 12 00:27:54 2015 UTC,"I agree about your prediction, but not because Fed wants it more; wanting something doesn't translate into getting the thing."
tennis,3cychs,goodstuff10,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:28:49 2015 UTC,No but it means you're going to fight harder

tennis,3cychs,bunnydeath_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:42:44 2015 UTC,"It might mean that you fight harder than you usually do, but it doesn't necessarily mean you'll fight harder than the other person does, and it also doesn't mean you'll play better than they do. I do agree that Fed's desire for #18 will help him to play some of his best tennis.  On the flip side, wanting something badly can also lead someone to choke and perform worse."
tennis,3cychs,deineseine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:40:10 2015 UTC,I agree. Hopefully he'll find the perfect balance

tennis,3cychs,TinKnight,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:45:39 2015 UTC,"We all know djokovic is incredible in all areas of his game...especially with that backhand and even his serve. In order for Roger to win he HAS to maintain those first serve percentages he's been having all tournament, and up those ground strokes. If you look at last years Wimbledon final, Rogers serve was on par...but those forehands were all over the place. This year he seems to have fixed that,, but i still can't call it. I'm saying 51-49 djokovic's favour, only because he's so damn consistent. One thing I know for sure is that we can expect a battle."

tennis,3cychs,emeryor,2,Sat Jul 11 23:05:19 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, if Federer loses there's a good chance it'll be because he completely falls apart. The pressure of having to server better and hit ground stroke harder will do that to him. Federer relies a lot on confidence behind his game. If he doesn't have that, he either won't go for the shots he needs to, or he won't be able to make enough of them to count. Where as if djokovic loses its unlikely to be as dramatic as him ""falling apart""."

tennis,3cwzsn,KhanSportsNews,132,Sat Jul 11 14:48:04 2015 UTC,"I had the pleasure of being a ball boy for Andy Murray about 9 years ago when he was coming up. This dude was so intense  on the court and I absolutely loved it.    He would have me toss him three balls, pick the best one, then hit two at once back in my general direction (cue me scrambling to pick the balls back up quickly so I don't interrupt his serve).  Sometimes he would do this to both ball boys. He would bring his sweaty towel from the sidelines and throw it at me to hold. I'm sitting here trying to chase after balls and hold his rank towel. He talked a decent amount of crap to the chair umpire and got a fair amount of warnings. He swore loudly a lot and even more under his breath.  At one point after an unforced error he motioned for me to toss him a ball. I did and he bounced it in front of himself while facing me and took a huge swing at it. I flinched thinking he was aiming at me but he turned his hips at the last second and hit it three courts down. Cue the chair ump in a flat voice: ""Warning Ball Abuse.""    The whole time I never saw him as a jerk. I just knew that he was an intense dude and was extremely focused. Tennis is a physical and mental struggle. When he won the tournament he was very gracious and gave a nice speech thanking everyone. I'm a huge Andy Murray fan because of it.  TL; DR: I got to hold Andy Murray's Balls and it was awesome"

tennis,3cwzsn,DRUNKTENNIS,17,Sat Jul 11 19:13:56 2015 UTC,I don't see how you can be intense with your legs when you have Roger Federer serving at such an insane level. I crunched the numbers from his semi and it was the best he had ever served in his career (http://khansportsnews.com/2015/07/10/federers-serve-statistics-in-the-wimbledon-semifinal-were-the-best-of-his-career/)  Murray played a really really REALLY good match and could have beaten Djokovic. And he knows that. That's why he's so shocked. When has a tennis player ever written an article about the guy that just beat him?  I feel like Murray did the best anybody could have done considering he's one of the best returners in the game and the 2nd best mover on grass in the world.
tennis,3cwzsn,DRUNKTENNIS,4,Sat Jul 11 15:14:54 2015 UTC,"it was the best he had ever served in his career   Your numbers only pertain to whether it was the best he's served in a Wimbledon semi. I do appreciate the stat research.  Don't those stats suggest that his 2009 numbers were better? Only 1% lower in first serve %, yet 5% higher in first serve pts won and 26% higher in second serve pts won."
tennis,3cwzsn,DRUNKTENNIS,4,Sat Jul 11 15:49:45 2015 UTC,"The previous article looked at the overall numbers, this one looks at the career Wimbledon semis performance. His wimby 2015 > wimby 2009 but wimby 2009 > wimby 2015 overall SO FAR"
tennis,3cwzsn,DRUNKTENNIS,-15,Sat Jul 11 15:54:25 2015 UTC,"He has a certain strategy composed of the following elements :  Try to keep him at the baseline, make him move  Stick to the baseline as much as possible  Stay low on passes and use your legs  I think where he had the most trouble was utilizing the leg to its fullest ability. Federer was 29/42 at the net (69%) I just don't know if he was staying low enough on passes"

tennis,3d2g7r,Jackofalll,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:39:08 2015 UTC,What do those numbers mean?  110?
tennis,3d2g7r,reedsparks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:34:36 2015 UTC,"In the sports gambling world, bets are based off $100.00,...so if the odds for Djokovic are -130, that means a $130.00 bet on Djokovic will net you $100.00,....and if the odds were -200, then a $200.00 bet would only net you $100.00.   If there is a plus sign (+200) in front of the number, this means that player(or team) you are betting on is crap.  So if Federer's odds was +200, this means a $100 bet would net $200.00.  -110 is technically even, because a sports bet will never be 100/100 for both players, because the Sportsbook likes to steal an automatic 10% for itself.  So when I made my initial Djokovic bet, both him and federer were at -110.  I hope this helps."

tennis,3cz089,rbace,0,Sun Jul 12 06:23:15 2015 UTC,And most of the rest of his game is sub-pro level at best. Hence: overachiever
tennis,3cz089,Thelonius-Drunk,6,Sun Jul 12 07:24:29 2015 UTC,sub pro? get out of here. He blasts the fuck out of that forehand.
tennis,3cz089,rbace,-1,Sun Jul 12 07:27:37 2015 UTC,"When it’s layed up for him nice and easily. He can’t move to hit it very well and he isn’t as accurate as most guys. Maybe sub-pro was an exaggeration, but his other weapons on average are middling to lower tier of the top 100 easily"
tennis,3cz089,Thelonius-Drunk,2,Sun Jul 12 07:29:16 2015 UTC,i would say he can crush the forehand harder than most of the tour.
tennis,3cz089,rbace,0,Sun Jul 12 07:33:19 2015 UTC,He has an ugly forehand compared to Raonic and Karlovic. Flat as hell and pretty uninspired. Yeah he can crush it when he's using it as a one-two punch after a serve but he's a pretty awful player once a rally becomes extended. He's Karlovic if you took away the fact that Karlovic is a good volleyer and uses good slice approach shots to get to the net.
tennis,3cz089,spaldingnoooo,2,Sun Jul 12 12:36:03 2015 UTC,Karlovich is known to have an even better serve than Isner yet Isner has generally been ranked better. Isner has to have something in his game that he does better.
tennis,3cz089,rbace,0,Sun Jul 12 12:43:40 2015 UTC,"I think Isner, to be fair to Isner, knows what he does well and rarely deviates from his gameplan and sticking to that gameplan is what wins him matches. Karlovic takes more risk playing serve and volley and I don't think it pays off in the results."
tennis,3cz089,spaldingnoooo,2,Sun Jul 12 12:46:01 2015 UTC,"i still don't get the overachiever terminology here, like he's a tryhard?  i will say props to him for making it this far after sucking so hard when he first appeared on tour, but his game is essentially neutralized with a good returner, which is basically anyone in the top 20. Yes his forehand is a freaking cannon but he has to get there and in position first to fire it."
tennis,3cz089,SafinisGOAT,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:25:04 2015 UTC,"I hope he becomes the next #1 but being a top 20 player (like Isner), a millionaire (I assume), globe trotter, etc. are substantial accomplishments."

tennis,3cwyv8,chief_running_joke,20,Sat Jul 11 17:51:20 2015 UTC,Certainly her douchebag behavior would be mitigated to some degree if she were winning. The handshake thing is not an isolated incident either. She regularly comes off as an asshole in interviews.

Kyrgios criticism started immediately after his Rafa upset; he's been (rightly) identified as an asshole almost from the moment he hit the tour. Bouchard was given a pass until lately, but she's a complete asshole, almost at all times, just extremely negative towards every other player in the WTA. Some players are just like that, like Gulbis.

tennis,3cwyv8,Gluecksritter90,6,Sat Jul 11 16:17:21 2015 UTC,"Why? It's not like Bouchard tanked last year's final, she was just completely outplayed.   And without Serena choking at 5-1 in the 2nd set today's match would've been barely any longer than last year's."
tennis,3cwyv8,AsSimpleAsSnow,8,Sat Jul 11 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"Bouchard was very cold and edgy after she lost the final last year, unlike Mugu today who seemed very gracious in her defeat. I wasn't making any comment on Bouchard's match performance."
tennis,3cwyv8,btaz,7,Sat Jul 11 17:47:50 2015 UTC,I think sports fans are putting unrealistic expectations regarding behavior. I am seeing it almost in every sport. I am not saying that they should be allowed to be jerks but we can't put a narrow range of acceptable behavior and expect them to follow it all the time. We should also have an expiry period for the discussion of such jerky behavior. We can't keep bringing up the same incidents every time and not give a chance for the other party to walk away from such behavior.
tennis,3cwyv8,Adariel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"People will stop commenting on it once the behavior ceases or changes.  No one still criticizes Federer now because of his early temper tantrums, do they?  As for the handshakegate, Bouchard had her chance.  She was mildly criticized the first time it happened but apparently felt justified enough that she chose to do it again.  It was only after the second time that it blew up.  This is an article from the first time"
tennis,3cwyv8,btaz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:27:26 2015 UTC,but apparently felt justified enough that she chose to do it again.    And why is this a problem? She gave her reasons. You can disagree. She simply doesn't think it is a big deal and important. Your argument reminds me of this :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfT8HlIy6pU  You hate her because she does not fit your idea of normal.
tennis,3cwyv8,zoueva,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:08:02 2015 UTC,It's about respect. We aren't obligated to like a disrespectful person like Bouchard. She's free to act as she likes as we are free to form opinions based on said actions.
tennis,3cwyv8,Gluecksritter90,5,Sun Jul 12 03:32:43 2015 UTC,"So players are now not allowed to be disappointed after playing badly in a big match?

Being happy and cheery after getting blown off the court in slam final in less than an hour?"
tennis,3cwyv8,abuttfarting,75,Sat Jul 11 18:37:48 2015 UTC,In spite of some wobbles by Serena the match wasn't close. I think Serena will retire unchallenged. She'll lose matches here and there but she will never have a true rival. Absolutely incredible.
tennis,3cwyv8,gibisee4,84,Sat Jul 11 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"She had a close rival, maybe 2. Henin and her sister. The only difference is that she's been around so long, that her rivals have pretty much retired or gotten worse, while she's gotten better."
tennis,3cwyv8,Shad0wF0x,28,Sat Jul 11 14:42:14 2015 UTC,Henin is the closest by far. 8-6 in favor of Serena.
tennis,3cwyv8,gibisee4,16,Sat Jul 11 14:53:24 2015 UTC,In 2007 she was leading the head to head and the slam count was pretty close (8-7 in Serena favor). It was a legitimate argument back then.

tennis,3cwyv8,gibisee4,58,Sat Jul 11 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it has to do with Serena playing in a much more athletic era of tennis, and being unbelievably good over such a long period of time."
tennis,3cwyv8,GinGimlet,23,Sat Jul 11 15:13:03 2015 UTC,"Also, Serena's record in dubs is outstanding. 13-0 in finals is ridiculous. Career golden slam in singles and doubles, Graf can't touch that."
tennis,3cwyv8,nista002,9,Sat Jul 11 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"Navratilova including doubles and non slam titles still owns Serena.  Serena has three more slams, but still over one hundred fewer singles titles, and Serena has 15 doubles slams to Navratilova's forty-one (41!)"
tennis,3cwyv8,noodlejabb,9,Sat Jul 11 18:25:56 2015 UTC,Yeah but Serena is better
tennis,3cwyv8,nomad1987,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"I guess that is reasonable but kind of unfair because athletes have gotten far more athletic as the years have gone by, regardless of sports. Is Djokovic a better player than Sampras?   Just playing devil's advocate here. I grew up watching Steffi absolutely dominate and quite honestly I was tired and sick of her do it on such a regular basis. Now I see Serena doing the same. Davenport Clijsters Capriati, Henin and even Venus were much better competition to her than the current crop."
tennis,3cwyv8,Explosive_Diaeresis,5,Sat Jul 11 21:25:56 2015 UTC,"We have a good analog for Djokovic, Agassi. Djokovic is a slightly better returner, slightly better mover, but equal of a shot maker. Pete had a habit of just doing enough to get a break, and that's all he needed because he was just damn near impossible to break on a fast surface during his prime.   I thought there were a lot of players who were better all around than Pete, but he was the greatest in maximizing his game to win big matches. I do think Djokovic is a better player than Pete, I don't think he'd beat him."
tennis,3cwyv8,mind_teaser,12,Sat Jul 11 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"""But before stating her case as the greatest athlete sans sport let’s briefly address those still clinging onto the notion that she’s not even the greatest tennis player. They’re easy to spot, often pointing to Serena's grand slam total being behind Margaret Court (24) and Steffi Graf (22). What those detractors often ignore however is the fact that Court, while great in her own right, played before the modern “open tennis era,” and won 11 of her 24 grand slam titles at Australian Open tournaments unattended by a majority of the top players in the world. They also disregard how Graf herself made a considerable trophy haul after her biggest rival, Monica Seles, was stabbed at the height of her career by a mentally ill Graf-obsessed fan. This is, of course, in no way Graf’s fault, but let’s call a spade a spade. During the three years prior to the stabbing, Seles won 8 of 12 majors. Graf? Two. Seles would go on to miss two years and return a shell of her former self. Graf, in turn, would win 10 of the next 15 majors."" Quote from a Complex article I linked to the subs front page."
tennis,3cwyv8,nomad1987,0,Sat Jul 11 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"First, Graf was dominant long before Seles came along. Just because one was dominant for 2-3 years prior does not mean Graf couldn't have made a comeback. Nadal dominated 2008-2010, Djokovic after that. Despite all that Federer and then Nadal reclaimed their #1 crown by cleaning up the circuit.  Seles was stabbed, let us call spade a spade, she didn't dominate after that, Graf did. People vastly underestimate how much of a colossus Graf was in the women's tour.   Second, Serena in the last 5 years has not seen sustained competition and yet has not won the calendar slam which Steffi did. We have had people like Bartoli, Kim Clijsters (after having a kid and not playing for 2 years) win grand slams meanwhile.   Point is this, there is no clear cut GOAT. The measure on the men's side is clearly # of grand slams. Unless Serena has the highest, there is no clear favorite imho."
tennis,3cwyv8,srd667,3,Sat Jul 11 20:33:34 2015 UTC,Can't go wrong with her or Graf. I go with Graf because imo she's the more skilled player while Serena is clear cut the best athlete. Similar to why I think Federer is better than nadal (skill vs amazing physicality).
tennis,3cwyv8,Skibibbles,6,Sat Jul 11 15:53:08 2015 UTC,Serena would probably trash Graf on the court though.
tennis,3cwyv8,srd667,6,Sat Jul 11 19:29:55 2015 UTC,Yea if you take Graf from an old era with old racquets and Serena in a modern era with slower courts better technology and better training/sports science information of course Serena will trash Graf. Comparing different eras in sports is useless because of the advancements made in the game.
tennis,3cwyv8,XcheerioX,-1,Sat Jul 11 22:48:00 2015 UTC,She wins majors but doesn't play in any other tournaments. She has won 70 singles titles. Navratilova has won 170. Graf has won 110. She can last longer than them career wise because she plays like 10 tournaments per year. If she had played the same amount of tournaments as them in her career she would have been done at 30 and had like 14 slams. I say Navratilova then Graf then maybe Serena.

He's extremely great for sure, but a lot of him being so high up there is media hype over him winning so many golds, when it's ridiculous that there are so many gold medals for swimming events in the first place.

tennis,3cwyv8,KyleG,3,Sun Jul 12 04:28:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think that takes anything away from his dominance. Even if you want to criticize the format of the events in swimming, Phelps was still playing on the same field as his peers, and proved to be miles ahead of everyone for over a decade.   I disagree with the argument that swimming events in the Olympics are like if tennis had events for forehand, backhand, serve, etc. From a competition standpoint, I'd say a better comparison would be the difference of playing on hardcourt, grass, and clay in tennis. A lot more goes into being a freestyle swimmer vs being a butterfly swimmer, just as more goes into playing on grass vs playing on clay. Your whole approach has to change for both, whereas the forehand, backhand, etc. in tennis is just one aspect of your game, similar to the way you utilize your legs in swimming vs the way you utilize your arms is just one aspect to each event as a whole. My point is kind of jumbled there, so I don't know if that makes sense."
tennis,3cwyv8,Mehrban,-3,Sat Jul 11 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"Your entire argument about preparation for the swimming events being so different is 100% circular logic. The preparation is different because they've made different events. If it were just a ""swimming"" race, there wouldn't be such a preparation difference. People would prep in one way that suited their personality, body type, etc.  Just like if we made tennis a ""forehands only tennis"" and a ""backhands only"" tennis and so forth, you'd be saying the preparation for a FH tennis is so different from a BH tennis. And then we'd have people marveling at, say, Roger Federer winning gold for best FH, best disguised serve, best volleys, etc. Oh my God, can you believe Roger won five gold medals this Olympics?!?

tennis,3cwyv8,Gluecksritter90,7,Sat Jul 11 14:38:55 2015 UTC,Even the umpire conspired to make that as anti-climactic an ending as possible. Really strange end to that game!  Almost an incredible fightback from Muguruza. Expecting a massive cheer when she goes to collect her runner up trophy!
tennis,3cwyv8,mind_teaser,3,Sat Jul 11 15:46:24 2015 UTC,I think she expected Muguruza to challenge the call and was somewhat caught by surprise when she didn't.

Though it took 3 sets, she played better in her matches against Watson and Azarenka. It's just a testament to how good she is that even at her worst, she's better than the rest."
tennis,3cwyv8,sweetmatter,3,Sat Jul 11 16:24:16 2015 UTC,Not sure why you were downvoted. The stats agree with you. She had brief moments today of brilliance but the rest was either mediocre or poor tennis.  She played well against Venus too.
tennis,3cwyv8,this_is_me_drunk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:59:42 2015 UTC,Thank you. I based that statement purely on stats. She did not have a mental struggle this tournament as bad as she did today.

tennis,3cwyv8,sweetmatter,2,Sat Jul 11 15:46:54 2015 UTC,"How can you bring up those two matches in the same comparison? Against Watson Serena was dreadful, against Azarenka she was just about as good as she can be. Today she let the nerves get to her, but eventually recovered. There was a stretch of games from 2-4 down to 5-1 up where she played as good as against Azarenka."
tennis,3cwyv8,binks21,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:22:50 2015 UTC,"Ummmm, all of these matches were in the same tournament so yes they work as good comparisons... Trying to understand your thought process. Azarenka and Watson were far better than Mugu yet Serena was flailing bad against Mugu. She had horrible return of serve and her service game was the worst I've seen in awhile. Double faults fadays.

tennis,3cwyv8,Babirusa1,6,Sat Jul 11 14:38:18 2015 UTC,I don't think it was that the crowd doesn't like Serena; there was some weird confusion after match point where even Serena didn't know if it was over or not. It also didn't help that the last game was so anticlimactic.

He just put in a lot of work and had a lot of talent and passion for tennis. There's nothing magical or godly about him, there's no need to lose your fucking mind over him. You are just as beautiful of a person as he is, you just haven't realized it, so you find yourself putting him on a pedestal for his accomplishments. Awe and wonder at greatness are normal, but without a proper sense of your self worth, you confuse accomplishments with identity. Sad thing there's plenty of people like you for all sorts of celebrities, ready to treat their idol as religion, when they're just another person. It's ridiculous and cultish. You're unaware that it's not a healthy part of a mature adults mind to be reduced to tears when he's just another guy, not literally a god. Finally, the look of obvious disdain he gave you should make you embarrassed, not proud. Sorry if I was harsh mate, just telling it like it is. Also I'm sorry if I completely missed the mark, I'm just giving you my honest opinion.   EDIT; I feel like I was too harsh OP. I get your overwhelming love for the guy, I really do. He's not only the greatest tennis player of all time (imho) but he's an awesome person also.

I don't understand celebrity worship. I get being a fan of their work, or respecting them for what they do, but when I see people act subservient to somebody because they're immensely talented at something it makes me cringe. I don't understand how a human being can do that, especially when it comes to professions like acting, or singing where it's not a one in a million talent which has got them there but a combination of good fortune (eg. having the right look for a role to get you started, or circumstantial such as dating a casting director who gives you a shot that you take). I mean with acting especially there are literally thousands of people with the acting ability of a top hollywood name (or are even beyond it) who are at least as good looking or charming as big hollywood names, but if anything they're looked down on by society. Meanwhile people have idol complexes for people who are successful in public professions, or are willing to give up their dignity for somebody they don't even know because they are public figures. At least in Federer's case - or the case with most athletes - they're undisbutably the best at something, but even then it's one element of life and really you should be pushing to achieve yourself. There are plenty of things you could probably take Federer to school on - such is life, you can't be good at everything."
tennis,3cwlge,circasurvivor1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:56:36 2015 UTC,"Haha, after I checked that it got a few upvotes, I was hoping that someone would because it's a fairly common thing. People really aren't aware that fangirling and fanboying are unconscious reflections of a misplaced sense of identity. This issue goes far deeper obviously but for some of us have stronger egos others, yet again for reasons that most people are unaware of (like how much they were nurtured while growing up... causes deriving a sense of value and identity from how others perceive you rather than loving yourself by perceiving the world without a sense of separation) it all comes down to some basic truths about the human mind that have been being shrouded by religious dogma for millenia). Long ranting short, I actually do hope you link this to r/best of ! Many many people out there need to ""wake up"" to the fact that thoughts and emotions are constantly changing, they don't make you who you are, the story you tell yourself about your past isn't who you are, an increasingly non-judgmental awareness is the way is the way to empower yourself now. A little reading and some practice with meditation will give you the tools to do it. Meditation isn't just some relaxation technique! It's actually a technique for ""waking up"" Oh man I went overboard again, but it's just natural to want to inspire others to experience this same feeling when you reaping the huge benefits of the experience like I have been. :) Never in my life has ""become the change you want to see"" made more sense than now.

tennis,3cyphd,ThePangloss,2,Sun Jul 12 04:15:23 2015 UTC,They most certainly would've done a better statistical analysis. It's a business after all.
tennis,3cyphd,Fartoholic,2,Sun Jul 12 06:34:22 2015 UTC,"Odds are not drawn up just on analysis of each competitor's chances, but also on how much money they believe will be placed on each player. It's a delicate balancing act.  For instance, if a player with an outside chance is heavily backed by punters, bookmakers will shorten that player's odds to add more protection in the event that player actually does win.  In this case, Djokovic could be seen as the favourite by most casual gamblers, so even if the bookies think logically that Federer has a greater chance of winning they will still need to shorten Nole's odds so that they don't get stung if all those punters backing him get their win."
tennis,3cyphd,compuzr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:02:19 2015 UTC,"Bookies don't make the odds to reflect who they think is going to win as a basis. It's about business like you said. It's like with Murray in England, he's usually always the favorite with bookies because more people will bet towards him. He was the favorite for the Fed match when he really shouldn't have been.   I'm not sure if you've ever read how bookies come up with odds and how they insure their profits but you should. Believing the bookies predictions for games always is a surefire way to end up not understanding the sport. It's not all about what statistics or what the people making money from your bets say, you have to look at how well someone is playing with your own two eyes and make that opinion. That's why betting exists."

tennis,3cyphd,Personacorona,4,Sun Jul 12 00:28:26 2015 UTC,"I think he's wrong in thinking that there is a single most important shot. It comes down to the cohesive game that a player brings to the table, and then what he/she does with that game. Nadal's serve isn't fantastic, and to be frank his return isn't that amazing either in big picture terms. It's good, mind you... but there have been much stronger returners out there. What Nadal does so well is bring points to neutral, and then win points from there.  What this match will settle is just who is the Wimbledon champion in 2015 :)"

tennis,3d0y88,JadedMuse,5,Sun Jul 12 16:39:25 2015 UTC,I mean Serena has a supreme physical advantage over her peers. Federer has a clear physical disadvantage over most top players. I don't think these 2 are comparable.

tennis,3d0y88,avaliantheel,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:05:36 2015 UTC,I'll be honest.  I'd rather have him lose in the quarterfinals than lose to Djokovic in the final.  One hurts much less than the other.  It's easier to shake off an upset in an earlier round than it is for the greatest grass court player of all time to lose to a player who is world number 1 and 5 years younger than him.
tennis,3d0y88,Kashmir33,3,Sun Jul 12 16:45:47 2015 UTC,I definitely don't agree. To me if only a player of Djokovic's caliber can beat Federer at this stage in his career it's almost a small accomplishment. Losing to the World #1 is always better than someone you should technically be able to beat.
tennis,3d0y88,avaliantheel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:58:43 2015 UTC,"From an armchair it's easy to rationalize.  Put yourself in Roger's shoes and think about the emotions he's going through.  As you get older, winning doesn't feel as good as it used to and losing hurts a lot more than it used to.  It's harder to bounce back emotionally from a tough loss than it is to savor a good win for all-time greats."
tennis,3d0y88,avaliantheel,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:02:57 2015 UTC,What hurts even more is that his form in this year's semifinal was arguably better than his form in his prime years but he played a worse final this year than he did last year.  It hurt seeing his nerves show up from the very first point.
tennis,3d0xv8,SkoivanSchiem,10,Sun Jul 12 16:34:03 2015 UTC,He'll probably play for some time. He just straight-setted the world's third best player (and is the second best player) at age 34. He's in no hurry to get out.

There's no shame in losing to a player like that, an elite of the elite. Federer destroyed Murray in the semis and made the final and has had a great year, so nothing about his performance suggests he should retire any time soon."

tennis,3d0xv8,CityofIndustry,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:39:52 2015 UTC,The real answer to this that I have heard from people in the know is that he wants to try to win an Olympic gold before he retires. It's the only thing he hasn't won yet in his career. maybe 2016.

Federer is covering the entire baseline with ease on every point, whereas once you start pushing women side to side they either can't physically make it or they hit it off the side of their racket.  Djokovic and Federer have the perfect bodies for tennis:  tall and lean.  They have great length and height but are also light enough to have great agility.  Obviously, Serena has some impressive curves that make it impossible for her to ever move as well as a lanky guy."

tennis,3d13he,BoeZaah_,10,Sun Jul 12 18:21:27 2015 UTC,Then you have no clue about tennis.   The men ranked around 500 play much closer to Roger's level than Serena's.  There is no way Serena could win games at the Challenger level.
tennis,3d13he,GTASanAndreasLubitz,0,Sun Jul 12 18:01:13 2015 UTC,"Chill man, to say she wouldn't win a set is taking it to the extreme. I believe she could probably take a set against the bottom ranked players. I'm not saying she would blitz them all 6-0 6-0 or even beat them"
tennis,3d13he,BoeZaah_,8,Sun Jul 12 18:06:13 2015 UTC,She would lose 6-0 6-0 to anybody around 500. Do you even understand what a game is?  You think it's extreme because you who Serena is and watch her on tv. You've never heard of the players around 500.   The difference between men's 500 and 1 is tiny compared to the difference between the tours. A 500 guy can hold serve against the top players and win his share of rallies. A top woman would struggle to win points on her own serve.   You have no clue what you're watching.

I don't think that Serena could break, but I do think that she could get the odd hold now and then.  She could, ostensibly, hit three or four unreturnables in a game.  I'm not sure if those numbers are correct, but it's true that there's a significant gap on average.

tennis,3cwpr6,Cndtennis4,19,Sat Jul 11 14:37:45 2015 UTC,"As a Serena fan, there were two players that worried me about stopping her from winning this title. Sister Venus and Garbine Muguruza. When i saw the draw, I  found Garbine on the opposite side and thought Garbine would make enough errors in one of the 6 possible matches to not make the finals, but she didn't and here she is. IMO, she is wildly underestimated. The main reason Garbine worried me is that she is the only player on the tour that I can see who can take the match out of Serena's hands. Garbine hits a BIG ball and hits shots even Serena can do nothing about. When she took Serena out at the FO, Serena wasn't playing poorly, she couldn't find answers to Garbines hot shots. Garbine hit her off the court in one of the fastest losses i've ever seen Serena have. Even though Garbine worries me most, i'm excited for this match because i do believe she is the only player right now who has shown she can challenge Serena and it will make for a good final.  What is in Serena's favor?   -Playing her 3rd final of the year. It's not new territory, her routine should be down and she should have less nerves  -Garbines collapse in second set. Expect Garbine to come out firing.  There is a point however in the second set where the errors start to creep up for Garbine as she gets tired.   -This is Garbines first final on the big stage  -She's Serena.   What is in Garbines favor?   -She has the big shots to scare Serena and make her nervous  -She's not scared of Serena. I believe her.   -Serena could get nervous going for history. In the end of the second set vs Maria at the AO Serena was very nervous and her ground strokes went away. She got by on serve. Something similar happened last month at the FO."

I fear we will never see the likes of this dominance in the women's game after Serena. But I always wondered what the landscape would be like if there were a 'Big 4' in women's tennis. That is to say, if you aren't at your very best, there are usually 2 or 3 other players that are there deep in the tournaments that will beat you."

tennis,3cxjrh,mind_teaser,22,Sat Jul 11 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"The arguments for Serena being the greatest female tennis player were mostly spot on. I find it insulting how the writer belittles other athletes to make a point that's completely unnecessary.  Kobe apparently isn't great because he didn't retire right after the 2010 finals, Mayweather because he has committed a bunch of crimes, Brady apparently because of deflategate (murky at best), the writer doesn't even mention messi (which is ridiculous) or people from other non american sports like sachin tendulkar. It's hard enough to compare athletes across generations, but trying to compare people in completely different sports, which you probably don't even watch, makes you look like an uninformed fool.  EDIT: they even forgot Phelps, who is the most accomplished Olympian ever."

Her rivals have come, gone, retired, procreated, un-retired, became coaches, re-retired—all while Serena continued to collect hardware. Longevity? The Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears ruled music when she won her first tennis tournament. Garbiñe Muguruza, her opponent from the Wimbledon final, was six."" Direct quote from the article.

tennis,3cxjrh,jaysanw,3,Sun Jul 12 03:30:29 2015 UTC,"Further reading: ""Serena Williams and the Fear of a Dominant Black Woman"" by http://twitter.com/thetomasrios http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/10/serena-williams-and-the-fear-of-a-dominant-black-woman.html    Here's what I've gathered:  Of the WTA's 2,500+ active players, Serena has had the longest cumulative reign holding the #1 ranking. Her 21 grand slam titles is heads-and-shoulders above whomever tennis fans consider a distant second greatest.  Beyond body image and skin color, the frequently quoted argument against celebrating Serena's success has been her on-court attitude of winning at all costs: in several instances of outlandishly poor sportsmanship and professionalism.  Her critics' knock on her temperament often refers to her tantrum outburst during the 2009 US Open semi-final playing against Kim Clijsters (described further in http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/14/us-tennis-open-serena-fine-idUSTRE58C21G20090914).  Uttering a verbal death threat against someone is one thing. Vehemently denying having done so in the midst of Arthur Ashe stadium full of spectators, cameras, and microphones is something else far more sociopathic and sinister.  Fortunately for her, the self-afflicted damage to her reputation did not stop her carrying on her tennis. Her outburst against the line judge -- during the match second set trailing 5-6 one set down -- was reprimanded with only a laughingstock $10,000 fine levied by the WTA. She earned $500,000+ in prize money for reaching the semi-final in the tournament.  She took another day after the fact to issue via her publicity agency an initial written statement (quoted in http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/13/AR2009091302670.html) that somehow did not even resemble an clear apology, but only regret. She needed further day to issue a second statement to actually put together the words, ""I want to amend my press statement of yesterday [...] sincerely apologise [...] I admit when I’m wrong.""  She and Roger Federer are contemporaries of the same age in tennis. It's a stark contrast whenever the ""Greatest of All-Time"" discussion comes up, despite each player having the most singles competition grand slam titles. Federer is revered by his fans and colleagues for his consistently professional on-court demeanor. Serena; not nearly so much. Tomas Rios did not write on this aspect of Serena's criticism in his article."

All the rackets are freshly strung before each match with the exact same strings/tension, although they may string a couple at a slightly different tension to help with mid-match adjustments.  And players typically switch to a fresh racket every ball change, (i.e. every 9 games.)"
tennis,3cxdy9,Dusk_Soldier,2,Sat Jul 11 21:18:13 2015 UTC,I think it is Federer that never changes his racket at the same time as the ball change.
tennis,3cxdy9,mppalmares,2,Sat Jul 11 22:30:22 2015 UTC,"He switches the game before, so do some others. Stan I think."
tennis,3cxdy9,mathen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:01:37 2015 UTC,That's it. He doesn't like to serve with new balls and the strings with the maximum tension.
tennis,3cxdy9,mppalmares,2,Sat Jul 11 23:36:00 2015 UTC,A minor nitpick - the ball changes after 9 games at the start and every 7 games after.
tennis,3cxdy9,btaz,5,Sat Jul 11 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"It's actually the other way round. After 7 games at the beginning due to the warm up, then every 9 games thereafter."
tennis,3cxdy9,Valinor_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:04:45 2015 UTC,I was hoping I got it right. I knew it was 7 and 9.
tennis,3cxdy9,btaz,2,Sun Jul 12 07:27:52 2015 UTC,"Players have a bunch of rackets and the top players tend to have them restrung every match (whether used, unused etc).   When they break a string, usually the ball boy gets it to the stringer who aims to have it back on court within 18-20 minutes.  Federer typically has 9 or so rackets restrung at a time; Sampras used to do 6 or more.  Players get to specify the kind of string (gut/polyester) used for the main and cross strings, the tension and the number of string savers. Most will specify 2-3 different tensions for their 9-10 rackets before each match, with the tension depending on the fell, the humidity etc. Players often change rackets when balls are changed. (every 9 games, except at the beginning).  This leads to a lot of work for the tournament stringers, with over 2400 rackets strung at the last US open. (At ~$60/racket, it isn't cheap)."
tennis,3cxdy9,barath_s,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:43:38 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that players are only allowed to use the same rackets they start the tournament with for the entire tournament.  If a player checks in 10 rackets, they can only use those 10 rackets for the whole tournament.  Same for if a player checks in 8 or 6 or any number that can fit into a racket bag."
tennis,3cxdy9,avaliantheel,6,Sat Jul 11 17:37:05 2015 UTC,Really? Where did you hear about this? This is the first time I've ever heard of anything like this and I find it surprising. Suddenly using a new racket would be a huge disadvantage for a player so not sure why they would have a rule like this.
tennis,3cxdy9,GATSBYH20,3,Sat Jul 11 18:39:44 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I heard the commentators talking about it during a Safin match back in the day.  He had smashed a lot of rackets that particular tournament and they were talking about how many he had left.
tennis,3cxdy9,avaliantheel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:18:20 2015 UTC,I don't think that was a rule per say but more how many of his specific custom designed frame he had with him. I know Del Potro's racket was no longer made anymore and so he couldn't afford to smash many or he would be forced to use a new racket.
tennis,3cxdy9,Kyle237,2,Sun Jul 12 00:03:20 2015 UTC,Del Potro's racquet was still made. Wilson can make any racquet for any pro player. Its just Wilson didn't want to make the Kfactor PJ for Del Potro anymore since its obviously bad if one of your top players sponsor a racquet that the public can't get anymore. Del Potro requested for the same PJ since he was superstitious or something about even using the same PJ after his US Open win.

tennis,3cx8uf,tofuskin,35,Sat Jul 11 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"It's probably to avoid the possibility of one partner worrying that the other thinks he fucked up when the don't ""high"" 5. So i think it's just a simple way of saying ""everything's cool"" regardless of what happened in the point."
tennis,3cx8uf,ChaeDoc_II,13,Sat Jul 11 18:26:43 2015 UTC,"This is the answer I was going to give. At the pro level, you have to stay positive, it's the difference between 2 against 2 and 1 against 3. Your teammate wants the win and prize money and ranking points as much as you do, if they mess up, tennis is so psychological, diminishing their confidence even more by giving them the silent treatment isn't going to help anything."
tennis,3cx8uf,GATSBYH20,4,Sat Jul 11 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"This is what I was going to say. If you only high five sometimes, then the assumption is ""you were good"" or ""you fucked up so bad i am worried about you getting messed up mentally.""  So then if you net a ball and get a high five, you understand your teammate is worried about you bringing them down, and cue vicious downward spiral.  If you do it every point, it basically helps reset your mind as part of a routine, and can help mentally.  Source: was very competitive doubles player with guy who fucked up all the time, and half my energy was keeping him from exploding with rage."
tennis,3cx8uf,KyleG,12,Sat Jul 11 19:57:14 2015 UTC,"I kind of like the concept.  The idea is that if you high-five after every point, it eliminates any worries that maybe you didn't get a high-five after a certain point because you didn't try hard enough, or because losing the last game was your fault, you hit the wrong shot, etc.  I think it help keeps the team morale high."

tennis,3cx8uf,garbobjee,11,Sat Jul 11 19:38:16 2015 UTC,It's akin to volleyball team who will form a congratulatory huddle after each points won (even a little bit when they lose the point). They have to win 75 in a game to win it.
tennis,3cx8uf,Perpete,6,Sat Jul 11 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"Have you ever played doubles? IF you do that constantly it builds up a team rhythm and dynamic. Being expressive on the court with each other is key to being in sync with each other. At that level of play in doubles you want to operate as one unit with as much cohesiveness as possible. So any interaction in a positive way fosters better play because it bonds you to your partner in a way. Especially if you don't know them that well, etc.  Also I only have high school playing experience and college club experience but I've found that the more expressive doubles teams do better, because they build off energy that the other gives."
tennis,3cx8uf,Riderz_of_Brohan,7,Sat Jul 11 20:16:54 2015 UTC,Same reason I would tap my racket on the ground before every serve.  Superstition and tradition  For me anyway
tennis,3cx8uf,CHillside,3,Sat Jul 11 17:02:23 2015 UTC,Part of it is rhythm. People who play sports at the highest level have very set routines for things. The high-five between every point is similar to how basketball players high-five between every free-throw attempt. This is in addition to what others have said about encouraging your partner or keeping up focus.
tennis,3cx8uf,flyinpanda,3,Sat Jul 11 19:00:40 2015 UTC,"To keep the positive vibes flowing and reinforce the team mindset. Doesn't matter if you butchered the last three volleys horribly; win as a team, lose as a team etc."
tennis,3cx8uf,VandalsStoleMyHandle,2,Sat Jul 11 20:39:00 2015 UTC,i always found this strange because it's really more ceremonious than emotionally driven or contextually correct most of the time.

But when it comes to my sport, I like to be solely responsible for my performance and my results. It is what originally drew me to tennis. Doubles just does not compute. I like the whole, this is my side of the court and that is yours - it's me against you - let's do this."

tennis,3cx8uf,KyleG,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:17:54 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason they do this is because during doubles, you always want to talk to your partner almost after every point. Maybe the high fiving is a natural thing"

tennis,3d0txa,castort,3,Sun Jul 12 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"You learn that you do what you love, and you try your best. Follow your passion, derive happiness from the best you can be, not identifying and judging yourself with the results. I like this quote ""it doesn't matter so much where we stand, but that we are moving in the right direction"" . This can be applied to many facets of life, but the one which can fundamentally restructure your mind so that you realize your potential is limitless, is meditation. There is a far deeper realization to be had from meditation than just relaxation. For a technical and lucid understanding, Read Waking Up by Sam Harris, or a New Earth by Eckhart Tolle which uses a slightly more flowery language description. Keep an open mind and allow the experience to happen. By the way, I love that you're asking this question and trying to learn from those who are successful. Basically, it's a mindhack. You don't feel bad when something you don't want to happen happens, because you have experience feeling positivity by virtue of being alive and aware, because you have stopped identifying who you are as your thoughts and emotions, which are always temporary."

tennis,3d0txa,circasurvivor1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:41:23 2015 UTC,"My friend, trust me, the only way way you will ever truly ""get it"" in a way that can actually change your life, is by witnessing this truth for yourself, through practiced meditation (being aware of the present moment lucidly, including thoughts). Think of it like this. You live in a room that only has shades of black and white, you know everything about how color works, you have books about what wavelength of light the color red is, you know exactly how the rods and cones in the retina work when light hits them, but you have never actually SEEN red or blue or yellow for yourself. The proof of the truth is in the experience. If this post interested in you, read Waking Up by Sam Harris. And then actually practice mindfulness for yourself. The benefits and insights that are possible are impossible to understand unless you actually experience them for yourself.  Sending selfless love for way :) haha I sound like a hippy. Oh by the way, if you want to take a shortcut to experiencing it for yourself, try a psychedelic drug, you will experience the power of consciousness at its most pure level. Be careful not to get ""lost"" in thought, simply be aware of how they occur spontaneously, and the feeling of being a thinker of those thoughts will disappear, and you will be filled with a fulfilling euphoria, and the deepest level of mental health, a sense of happiness that is does not depend on material things. Haha sorry I got super Carried away, it's just a truly amazing way of being and I wanted to share."

tennis,3d0txa,larrydavid_,2,Sun Jul 12 16:31:54 2015 UTC,A lot of that has to do with Novak and him putting pressure on Federer. Novak was the better player all 4 sets. Federer did alright.

tennis,3d0txa,larrydavid_,2,Sun Jul 12 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"Not really. Federer has to go for more on his neutral shots and that leads to more ""unforced"" errors. The player you're playing matters."

tennis,3d1irb,Rafael_Federer,0,Sun Jul 12 19:50:29 2015 UTC,"More players than ever play the game, so the competition is much harder than ever.  Federer is in danger of retiring with losing records against all of the other big 4, which certainly says something--namely that it is a very strong era. Nadal and Djokovic will go down as two of the greatest to every play the game. Federer certainly does not have the chance to win easy slams against opponents like Philippoussis any longer. So yes, a strong era (and stronger than earlier) indeed."
tennis,3d1irb,supremechairumpire,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:27:28 2015 UTC,"So, what you're saying is that if you're a fit and athletic enough guy, you can win Slams.  All right, so I'll find the best long distance runner in the world and stick a tennis racquet in his hands.  He'll get laughed off the court by high school kids, assuming that he doesn't play tennis to a certain level.  If Fed had won today, your tune would be so much different, because you'd be spouting, ""Hooray for tennis!  The soulless tennis that Novak Djokovic plays has been crushed by the effortless magnificence that is The Tennis Master Roger Federer.""  If Fed had won in five sets, he'd have lasted in what you so negatively term a ""Pushathon."""

tennis,3czctw,PokeMyPillow,2,Sun Jul 12 03:57:27 2015 UTC,Bollettieri is not even a former pro. He saw a chance at making some $$$ from starting a tennis school and went for it
tennis,3czctw,bumbleb333,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:05:12 2015 UTC,Bollettieri is a great businessman who found a niche market and got in at the right time with the right group of talented kids and pros.  I've seen it said that he's not even a 3.5 player.  Being a director of tennis and an instructor of tennis are two different things.
tennis,3czctw,hfmf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:41:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think real tennis fanatics really focus on Bollettieri too much - in Agassi's Open, he is very critical of Bollettieri and his coaching. Although Bollettieri was relatively successful with Agassi, I don't think very many people think of him as having a wealth of tennis knowledge like Darren Cahill might have. Anyways, just because Bollettieri is a little lackluster in his knowledge shouldn't discount every single retired pro or famous advocate for the game."
tennis,3czctw,Comrod,0,Sun Jul 12 04:35:39 2015 UTC,"Well that explains why so many people go as to pay thousands of dollars to get just 1 hour or useless coaching from him.  And notice how I said ""shouldn't always trust"" in my title not ""just never ever trust a former pro""."
tennis,3cxa1s,PRO_ERA,11,Sat Jul 11 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"She certainly has the game to justify that argument. The fact that she did not seem to be overawed by the enormity of the moment (which seems to happen SO OFTEN on the women's side) bodes well.   It really comes down to CONSISTENCY at the end of the day. You could make arguments for the likes of Madison Keys and Sloane Stephens for instance (in terms of also having the GAME/SHOTS to beat the big fish), but they've made some noise yet not carried on deeper into draws. The fact that Keys has a Slam champion coaching her coupled with her power game has me leaning more to her as ""next"". However she did have a favorable draw break her way and STILL not find a way to get past a good but beatable ""finesse player"", while Muguruza beat 4 higher-seeded players  so Muguruza i guess gets that nod, although EXACTLY 12 months ago Bouchard was ""the one"" and she's fallen off a cliff."
tennis,3cxa1s,kidkyros,9,Sat Jul 11 16:49:43 2015 UTC,"Thought Keys was gona make it to the finals with the favorable schedule, but as we've been accustomed to she just can't find a way to win. I know Bouchard is the same age as Mugu, but when I last saw her play which happened to be exactly 12 months ago nothing really stood out to me. Barring injuries I think Mugu and Keys will be the ones to look out for once Serena decides to retire."
tennis,3cxa1s,iwana2jzgte,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:26:45 2015 UTC,If we're talking players under 24. I would just like to add Sloane and Halep to that list. Both going through a bit of a rough patch but have great potential.
tennis,3cxa1s,azurerain,3,Sat Jul 11 23:27:41 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think Keys and Muguruza are the ones to watch. Couldn't agree more. Consistency is the name of the game. I definitely say that Keys run in the AO and Mugs run here definitely point towards then being the two next up and comers.
tennis,3cxa1s,alpacafarts,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:21:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly curious, did people truly think Bouchard was ""the one""?  I always thought her game was very one dimensional - similar to Wozniacki when she started out, but less stable and consistent. She just seemed like another ""up and comer"" that would eventually kind of disappear...at least for a while."
tennis,3cxa1s,azurerain,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:18:29 2015 UTC,"The biggest obstacle for young talent is how they handle the pressure of popularity, attention and expectations. Ana Ivanovic is the best example of a great talent unfulfilled because of that aspect of the sport. But in the recent times we also had Sloane Stephens, Genie Bouchard and even Simona Halep who experienced a huge slump after gaining a certain status."
tennis,3cxa1s,Compulsive1,3,Sun Jul 12 17:37:26 2015 UTC,"I'm taking a 'wait and see' approach. She's lost in the first or second round of a tournament 8 times this year (she entered 13).  As a comparison, Bouchard lost in the first round 9 times last year."
tennis,3cxa1s,abuttfarting,9,Sat Jul 11 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"She turns 22yo in three months - historically ancient for a WTA player considered 'up-and-coming' - and she's only won one title (Hobart International) in her career.  Here's the success of other top players of the last generation by Murguruza's current age:   Serena had 5 Slams already, reached #1 Henin had 3 Slams already, reached #1 Venus had 4 Slams already, reached #1 Sharapova had 3 Slams already, reached #1 Clijsters had reached 4 Finals (winning 0), reached #1   It's hard for me to put Muguruza as most promising when she's so far behind the growth curve of other greats.  Players I'd put ahead of her: Bencic is the obvious pick IMO ... Keys is 1.5 years younger, and Konjuh is a bit of a flier pick but she's so far ahead of Muguruza's curve I'd put her ahead too."
tennis,3cxa1s,YaoPau,14,Sat Jul 11 17:46:13 2015 UTC,"Tennis today isn't what it was ten, fifteen, twenty years. As of here and now, the days of 15 to 20  year olds winning Grand Slams is long gone and there's no reason to believe that's going to change any time soon. Great tennis players are playing great later into their careers. In today's tennis, the men's or women's game, you need a complete game to seriously contend for Grand Slams. These current tennis players don't have completel games until they reach their early to mid-20's."
tennis,3cxa1s,MCallanan,5,Sat Jul 11 19:53:43 2015 UTC,"Wait, didn't you skip a generation?  Where do Azarenka, Kvitova, Wozniacki, Ivanovic, etc. fall then?  Remember the game itself has changed too as the above players had to still mostly play the ""old"" generation, resulting in GS champions like Li Na at an older age.  It's highly unlikely that there will be new 17-18 year old GS champs in the future, while in the past it wasn't so surprising."
tennis,3cxa1s,Adariel,4,Sat Jul 11 19:07:17 2015 UTC,"I mentioned Sharapova (28yo) who's just half a year older than Ivanovic, and within 3 years of Vika, Woz, Kvitova.  None of the players you mentioned have been historically great... but even still, Woz and Ivanovic had reached #1 by Garbine's age ... Kvitova hit #2, Vika #5.  Vika's probably your best recent comp."
tennis,3cxa1s,YaoPau,2,Sat Jul 11 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Taylor Townsend get serious about her fitness and make  run for it. Nice game, kind of like Radwanska with more power."
tennis,3cxa1s,MoreDblRainbows,2,Sat Jul 11 19:03:09 2015 UTC,Yea she has Donald Young written all over her and not just because his family has trained her... For obvious reasons.
tennis,3cxa1s,MCallanan,2,Sat Jul 11 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"Not quite sure what you mean. But I think she has more upside than him, he just simply couldn't hit with the big boys. She can."
tennis,3cxa1s,MoreDblRainbows,5,Sat Jul 11 20:05:14 2015 UTC,Donald Young who was once a great young prospect had a problem with the USTA because he refused to train hard enough. As a younger lad he had a reputation for being a very lazy lad. Taylor Townsend who has a bit of a knack for being lazy herself with her training was trained and brought up to the professional level by Donald Young's family.
tennis,3cxa1s,MCallanan,2,Sat Jul 11 20:15:39 2015 UTC,"Ooh I thought you meant game wise, I know she just switched back to Donald's dad.  Donald Young had an attitude though, which I don't get from Townsend."
tennis,3cxa1s,MoreDblRainbows,3,Sat Jul 11 20:22:56 2015 UTC,She has a ton of talent. I got a chance to watch her play a lot in the WTT and her talent is quite real.
tennis,3cxa1s,MCallanan,2,Sat Jul 11 20:28:14 2015 UTC,I guess we'll just have to wait and see. So many of the American girls look great from 16-18 and then just fall off.
tennis,3cxa1s,MoreDblRainbows,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"She's definitely up there.  I still have faith in Bouchard, and Keys and Stephens belong in the conversation as well."

tennis,3cxa1s,SafinisGOAT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:33:57 2015 UTC,"Tornada Alicia Black, Belinda Bencic are two players that come to mind when I think of up-and-coming on the WTA circuit. Bencic made the QF on her first try at the US Open; that doesn't happen by accident. I know less of TA Black but her parents seem to be of the same mold as the Williams, so she is to be watched for sure. I'd also throw Elena Svitolina in the mix for her success on the junior circuit; she made a QF in the most recent French Open.  Muguruza and Keys are definitely players who will be ripe for the 'post-Serena' era."
tennis,3cy9zb,phiomni,6,Sat Jul 11 21:39:00 2015 UTC,"A couple of great records that could result from Serena winning the US Open.   Serena would tie Steffi with the most GS titles in the open era with 22. Only Margaret Court has more with 24, noting that some of hers were outside of the open era. Serena would complete the calendar slam, becoming only the 4th women to do so and the first since Steffi's golden slam year of 1988. Serena would win her 4th consecutive US Open, tying Chris Evert for most consecutive US Open titles. It would be Serena's 5th consecutive major title. The most consecutive is 6."

tennis,3cy9zb,LAMFF,2,Sat Jul 11 23:03:17 2015 UTC,Unbelievable how much of discount Graf's domination gets from the media considering the watered down women's draw of the last decade.
tennis,3cy9zb,alpacafarts,2,Sat Jul 11 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"Crazy how you completely discount Serena's greatness because, in your opinion, the women's your is so completely watered down."
tennis,3cy9zb,LAMFF,5,Sat Jul 11 22:17:30 2015 UTC,"I don't discount Serena at all, but was around to watch Steffi at her prime; just as impressive."

It was as if he was bending everything to his will in order to remind the people who the GOAT is.

tennis,3ctkte,ContinuousThunder,15,Fri Jul 10 23:08:08 2015 UTC,"Noob here, why is rhat shot so impressive?"
tennis,3ctkte,CaptTeemo,110,Fri Jul 10 18:23:50 2015 UTC,"A number of reasons:  —The shot takes incredible wrist strength and flexibility. Look closely at his racket hand/arm while he's hitting it.  —For the shot to land in-bounds, it needs to pass through a very specific and thin column of air—i.e., there's little margin for error.  —It takes great awareness and intuition to realize that the shot is a possibility, based on where the opponent is and where the opponent is heading.  —It is usually a losing position: the typical alternative shots in that situation are to hit a lob (high over the opponent's head, toward the back of his court) or to hit down-the-line (straight down the court, along the edge), both of which are difficult and which, even if successful, would give the opponent a chance to get his racket on it. Roger's shot was higher-risk than those.  —Andy is expecting the down-the-line shot and is moving to defend against it, and Roger makes it look like that's what he's going to hit until the last instant. It's difficult to think far ahead enough to fake someone out in tennis, and even if you think to do it, it's difficult to actually adjust your target in mid-stroke.  —Roger is not even looking in the direction he's hitting at the moment of impact; he knows where the net and the boundary lines are without seeing them."
tennis,3ctkte,jleonardbc,68,Fri Jul 10 18:30:16 2015 UTC,And he's fast as fuck
tennis,3ctkte,virtu333,21,Fri Jul 10 18:45:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Seriously.  For me the best way to put it is Andy Murray just hit a shot that would be a winner against many professional players. Even most very high-level pros would be lucky to get to this and hit a defensive shot that Andy could easily put away at net. What Fed does is get to this incredibly well placed shot from Murray and somehow hits a winner (!)  And, he makes it look so easy that someone asks what makes it impressive. It's impressive because no one else in the world can make a shot like this."

tennis,3cx213,NoStopImDone,8,Sat Jul 11 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"stand next to the net, put a tennis ball just under the cable, then with just your racquet, place it up against the ball and try to move the ball up and over the net. that is the motion you need in order to put top spin on the ball. also start your stroke low and end high.   kind of what this guy is doing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDPi4et4i3U"
tennis,3cx213,blooddidntwork,2,Sat Jul 11 16:21:15 2015 UTC,Which grip do you use?  Which style of forehand would you like to hit?  The amount of topspin and power you can generate starts with the grip.
tennis,3cx213,avaliantheel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"I believe I use the continental (the handshake one?), which may occasionally slip into just a standard, fingers together, grip. I'm not entirely sure what style I want to hit, can you give me an example?"
tennis,3cx213,flyinpanda,2,Sat Jul 11 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"Continental is not a good forehand grip. As a beginner, you should be learning to hit your forehands somewhere around eastern to semi-western. You need to work on hitting the ball low to high, which creates topspin. Also make sure your racket is not facing upwards on contact, it should be perpendicular to the ground or slightly closed.   I would add that you probably shouldn't be copying Nadal's form. He kinda has a unique form and without understanding why it works, just blindly trying to copy it could lead to problems for you later.   The best way to work on topspin is to play mini-tennis. Basically, rally with someone at the service line and work on your form."
tennis,3cx213,flyinpanda,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I thought continental was the general form for everything. Silly me! And to clarify, I don't want to copy Nadal's form, I just want hit topspin. It seems he can hit it as hard as he wants, and the ball just dives into the court."

tennis,3cx213,SafinisGOAT,2,Sat Jul 11 18:58:07 2015 UTC,There's your problem. Literally no one any good hits a forehand with continental in the modern era because it's pretty much impossible to generate that topspin with a continental grip.  If you want the simplest approach: every shot except your forehand topspin groundstroke should be continental.  That one should be either semi-western (good middle of the road and what most people use) or eastern (less consistency and spin) or western (really physically taxing to generate pace)
tennis,3cx213,avaliantheel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:14:40 2015 UTC,my friend i think hits with good spin with continental...but now he has elbow problems lol
tennis,3cx213,bluemirror,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:32:12 2015 UTC,http://www.busy-tennis-players.com/tennis-grips.html    This will give you a good explanation of the different grips.  The continental grip you are using is best suited for volleys and serves.  It is not well suited for putting topspin on your forehand.  Any of the three forehand grips shown in the link are good.
tennis,3cx213,SafinisGOAT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:08:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like this tip helps people tremendously. Keep your wrist solid and cocked because that makes the point of contact consistent, as you are about to strike the ball your wrist turns from 3-9 naturally, assuming you're following through across your body"
tennis,3cx213,Thatguy7242,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:00:00 2015 UTC,"Developing a forehand especially with spin is not going to be easy and will take time. Do not fret if it doesn't happen in a month. It takes time and commitment. Now with that, definitely do as many posters already did and watch lots of videos and see how it's done from different perspectives. No one can tell you how to move your arm to achieve a top spin forehand. Best natural way to learn is watch someone do it and copy it then read the mechanics and concepts.  Some basic things to help you in no particular order: 1. Topspin is imparted from racquet moving from below the ball to above it.  2. It's ok to hit flat at first and as your contact point is improved you can start trying to brush from below 3. Mini tennis helps so much as you need to learn timing 4. Choose Eastern or Semi-Western and when you pull the racquet back behind you have the strings face the ground. This will help you come under and over the ball.  5. Find a friend how's better than you to teach you!  Good luck have fun!"

Psychologically, Muguruza has all the advantages: she has nothing to lose, everything to gain, she doesn't have the pressure to perform as it is only her first finale in a Majors, she's beaten Serena in a slam before and she's not trying to complete a grand slam.  On the other hand, Serena is at her best when she seeks vindication (Hello, Maria) and she had a good scare already when she admitted herself she choked in the French Open finale's 2nd set. Her match with Azarenka has awaken all the great tennis that she can deliver in the second week of a major, so she should be able to put it to good use today.

tennis,3cw4uy,rafessi,2,Sat Jul 11 09:58:48 2015 UTC,"Muguruza has a definite chance in this, but it will need to be a combination of her playing the best match of her life and Serena being below her level, both of which seem unlikely to happen.  But she's beaten her before and took her to 3 sets in this year's AO too so she definitely has the game to trouble her. I just think that the occasion will be too big for her and Serena will be just too determined to get her 2nd Serena slam and be on course for a Calendar slam.  I would love to see a 3 set battle here."

tennis,3cyt5l,Personacorona,3,Sun Jul 12 01:07:09 2015 UTC,Why would Federer retire if he wins Wimbledon? So he can retire on a high note? Not a chance. He'll retire after he falls out of the top 10 or when his body can't hold up to his standards anymore. As the current number 2 he is clearly still playing very well and if he wins Wimbledon it just confirms that he could still play the the pinnacle of tennis.

If I were to guess, I think the grand slam record matters very much to him.  He absolutely does not want one of the players from this generation to beat his total.  Unless something very serious happens, we will enjoy seeing him play for at least two more years."
tennis,3cyt5l,avaliantheel,2,Sun Jul 12 00:53:46 2015 UTC,"No way. He has said multiple times in the past that he wants to play the 2016 Olympics in Rio. He also seems to really enjoy the tennis lifestyle. I've never really understood this obsession for great athletes to retire on top. Brian Philips, the sports writer from Grantland, had a great article about Federer's late career and how unnatural and dehumanizing it is for athletes micromanage their retirements just gain the illusion of a greater legacy."
tennis,3cyt5l,qaz4300,2,Sun Jul 12 01:23:39 2015 UTC,"Linking the article because I loved it so much. Here's my favorite quote:  In America, at least, how we read any great athlete’s ending still seems influenced by Michael Jordan’s merciless stage-managing of his own second retirement. (The “real” one, not the baseball one.) Hit the last shot, seize the title, never lose, never show weakness, end on a big banging chord that the audience remembers forever; then you’re a champion for all time, in the same way Cheers never closes. That this is, actually, such an impossibly grotesque and dehumanizing approach that not even Michael Jordan could resist coming back to screw it up should possibly tell us something. But there it is, an ideal that every generational-apex-type star has to contend with on some level.7 Any concession to the imperfect human process of finding your way toward what you want has to be understood in terms of the toll it takes on the memory you leave behind."

Besides, Djokovic - Federer is my favorite matchup to watch, their matches are always exciting, and losing that would make tennis greatly less interesting.

tennis,3ctwza,Jobin1616,27,Fri Jul 10 19:50:14 2015 UTC,Generally:  A grand slam = any of the four Majors.  THE grand slam = winning all four Majors in one year.

People have been born and lived satisfactorily long lives since we last had this. We declared war on Nazi Germany since we last had this. Nuclear energy, colour television, duct tape, rock and roll, bikinis and feminism have been invented since we last had this. It's alright for you with your Connors and McEnroe and Agassi and Sampras etc. etc., but imagine if the last time you had a serious male tennis player FDR was still a new President and Gone With The Wind hadn't even started filming yet. This is why we jizz. Unless some statistical anomaly happens, the next time a British male top 3 player comes along it'll most likely be the 22nd century, all of us watching Murray now will be dead, and Federer may even have retired.

tennis,3ctft9,nachomannacho,7,Sat Jul 11 08:27:24 2015 UTC,I always thought he'd be a great commentator one day judging by his superlative performances in press conferences.
tennis,3ctft9,furious_20,8,Fri Jul 10 17:48:12 2015 UTC,"I've loved his commentary so far, but I think he benefits from having played against a lot of the top players on tour right now. Being so fresh off the court I think makes his remarks a bit more relevant, and being quite a bit younger than his broadcasting peers helps too for having the wit to make such cultural references. I hope he stands the test of time, I look forward to watching more tennis with him in the booth."

tennis,3ctft9,redditacc2015,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah they bounced off each other well. Henman just comes out with some hilarious comments, often with deadpan delivery so it takes you a second before you go 'oh snap', plus he manages to make implications without outright saying something which would be slightly un-BBC. Good example was in one of the matches post the Murray match where he called the trainer out, him and McEnroe we're going on and on about how good the trainer was, mocking the fact that Murray and his opponent hadn't really been injured. Wish I could remember it more clearly, it was some funny shit."

tennis,3csw44,missscottfraser,10,Fri Jul 10 15:43:46 2015 UTC,Absolute world class tennis. This match is miles better than the Djokovic / Gasquet game. On the edge of my seat already. Privilege to watch.

tennis,3csw44,WorkinNLurkin,10,Fri Jul 10 15:47:34 2015 UTC,"Fed doesn't serve as ""fast"" as some of these bruisers, but he is so damn accurate, and puts such difficult spin on the ball, and knows exactly where he wants the ball to bounce so that he is back in an easy offensive position for his return."
tennis,3csw44,zomb1,11,Fri Jul 10 16:42:40 2015 UTC,"Also, Roger should retire already. Look at how his age is showing!"

tennis,3csw44,mahcity,8,Fri Jul 10 16:44:01 2015 UTC,The shots that Fed is making Murray hit to stay in it are incredible.  Both players are hitting so well.

tennis,3csw44,Prendy,7,Fri Jul 10 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"I doubt anyone could've beaten Roger today, crazy."
tennis,3csw44,kuyakew,20,Fri Jul 10 17:25:51 2015 UTC,I just want Fed to win one more. Sorry Murray.
tennis,3csw44,swissRF,9,Fri Jul 10 17:28:40 2015 UTC,I will always want Fed to win one more.
tennis,3csw44,Kashmir33,12,Fri Jul 10 17:03:02 2015 UTC,how they can look so incredibly calm and composed is beyond me. I'm already jittery and I'm not even much into tennis.

tennis,3csw44,tslane,12,Fri Jul 10 15:25:57 2015 UTC,Almost 34-years-old and Federer can still absolutely dominate like this. It's unbelievable. I hope he can keep up this level of play against Djokovic.
tennis,3csw44,DullahanPT,17,Fri Jul 10 16:51:57 2015 UTC,"I watch most of Federer's matches, hoping that god will come down to earth and display this quality of tennis. It happens so rarely these days. So there you go, that's the reason he's my favourite player."
tennis,3csw44,ncolaros,13,Fri Jul 10 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"I'd really like to see Roger get at least one more Major win, and this tournament is his best chance."

tennis,3csw44,Waffle_Frisbee,11,Fri Jul 10 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"I'm watching the BBC broadcast and I feel some weird tension between Andy and the other commentators. Andy said something like ""I don't think Roger's played like this in a long time..."" and one of the English commentators said something like ""There's still 5 sets to be played though..."" I love it"

tennis,3csw44,Baelor_Breakspear,20,Fri Jul 10 16:15:01 2015 UTC,Let's go Murray!  I wonder if we'll see one of these beauties.
tennis,3csw44,rafessi,6,Fri Jul 10 16:19:56 2015 UTC,8/8 1st serves in for Fed and yet Murray took it to deuce in that game...
tennis,3csw44,sweetmatter,6,Fri Jul 10 14:39:37 2015 UTC,This is going to be one of the greatest matches of all time... I can feel it.
tennis,3csw44,mihirpatel14,7,Fri Jul 10 15:20:19 2015 UTC,That Murray lob was a beaut
tennis,3csw44,Skyluz,6,Fri Jul 10 15:24:45 2015 UTC,How the fuck did he win that?
tennis,3csw44,itsmekathy,6,Fri Jul 10 15:43:52 2015 UTC,I love how in awe of Fed A-Rod still is.
tennis,3csw44,red_280,6,Fri Jul 10 15:47:56 2015 UTC,"If I had a dollar for every arsehole that's puckering in that stadium, I'd be a rich man."

tennis,3csw44,mojambowhatisthescen,6,Fri Jul 10 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"Oh god, this game! Two of the best at the peak of their powers, dueling it out. Sporting perfection."
tennis,3csw44,bustedracquet,8,Fri Jul 10 16:38:03 2015 UTC,Whoever wins this game is going to win the match I think. This is just ridiculous.
tennis,3csw44,S3baman,6,Fri Jul 10 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"Damn, Fed missed a golden chance there, he should have sealed this 2nd set. Great resilience from Andy however"
tennis,3csw44,bc12392,6,Fri Jul 10 16:42:37 2015 UTC,That was easy
tennis,3csw44,bustedracquet,4,Fri Jul 10 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, I totally overestimated the importance of that game, what a rebound from Roger. Holds routinely, and then plays an amazing game to break and take the set."
tennis,3csw44,yiyiyiyi,7,Fri Jul 10 16:45:38 2015 UTC,I like how Henry put his girlfriend next to Fergie so he can chat away to her like an old fogy instead of him.
tennis,3csw44,CallowMethuselah,6,Fri Jul 10 16:52:49 2015 UTC,Federer is a machine.
tennis,3csw44,Kritty1996,5,Fri Jul 10 16:55:31 2015 UTC,Important for federer to finish this off in 3 sets. Needs to rest up as much as possible for the final so physical fatigue isn't an issue if going 4/5 sets with novak is required.
tennis,3csw44,DullahanPT,6,Fri Jul 10 16:56:57 2015 UTC,NO WAY
tennis,3csw44,AlphaStryk3r,6,Fri Jul 10 17:20:02 2015 UTC,Just incredible from Federer
tennis,3csw44,bustedracquet,5,Fri Jul 10 17:21:44 2015 UTC,NO. WAY.

tennis,3csw44,ASIC_SP,6,Fri Jul 10 17:22:51 2015 UTC,MATCH POINT  come on FEDERER
tennis,3csw44,S3baman,5,Fri Jul 10 17:23:01 2015 UTC,More PseudoMcEnroe goodness:  You get the sense that Roger gets the sense that Murray senses he needs to dig awfully deep here or it's gonna be sayonara and adios amigos.
tennis,3csw44,nuginization,6,Fri Jul 10 17:24:09 2015 UTC,Poor Murray got broken in the last service games of each set
tennis,3csw44,zachkerr,5,Fri Jul 10 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"So Federer would be favourite on the form of this tournament, no? If he keeps serving like this then it's almost impossible to beat him."
tennis,3csw44,gregorramza,6,Fri Jul 10 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is Fed has just beaten the guy who played very good tennis. No one can claim that Murray is not on his day. He was very good.  After the first game I thought, ""Yeah, that's it! Fed is gonna lose.."" however he became beast and after the last game of first set he dominated the game entirely.   Well done Roger, we want to see that trophy in your hands."
tennis,3csw44,Ps3FifaCfc95,25,Fri Jul 10 17:27:00 2015 UTC,I think the first player to take three sets is going to win this one.
tennis,3csw44,zomb1,12,Fri Jul 10 17:33:04 2015 UTC,This guy knows his stuff!
tennis,3csw44,CommonMalarky,7,Fri Jul 10 15:27:45 2015 UTC,I see Tubbs is popping over from covering the ashes.
tennis,3ctjl8,that-dude-1234,106,Fri Jul 10 17:36:29 2015 UTC,That was a great performance being destroyed by a perfect performance
tennis,3ctjl8,jetveritech,17,Fri Jul 10 17:53:00 2015 UTC,That's the perfect way to describe the match.
tennis,3ctjl8,Gay_Wolverine,35,Fri Jul 10 18:00:06 2015 UTC,Here's another good one: Federer's 1st serve placement
tennis,3ctjl8,winabean7,13,Fri Jul 10 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"My brain says this is impossible, but my eyes saw it."
tennis,3ctjl8,arturoman,10,Fri Jul 10 20:17:47 2015 UTC,The fuck...I can't even get a crumpled paper into a trashcan nearby. That is pinpoint precision
tennis,3ctjl8,Sprechensiedeustch,4,Fri Jul 10 22:22:16 2015 UTC,That one in the middle of the right box was a disgustingly good kick serve into the body that totally handcuffed Murray.  Just phenomenal service.
tennis,3ctjl8,Puddinsnack,7,Sat Jul 11 02:52:24 2015 UTC,I consistently hit those areas on Virtua tennis. Incredible that a real human can do it in a big game consistently.
tennis,3ctjl8,bharathbunny,14,Fri Jul 10 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"Vintage Federer.  +45 on the Winners/UE.  20 aces in a three set match.  Match time in a 34 game match was right around 2 hours.  And my god, that backhand was dangerous that match.  The only possible way he could have played better was to win one of the 5 break points at 4-5 in the second set.  I hope we get this level from him on Sunday."
tennis,3ctjl8,avaliantheel,5,Fri Jul 10 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, both Djokovic and Federer dropped the same number of games today, but one was playing a two time Wimbledon semifinalist and one was playing a two time Slam champion."
tennis,3ctjl8,Personacorona,13,Sat Jul 11 01:06:20 2015 UTC,"Let's pay some respect to Gasquet.  He played quite admirably for a man who just came off of a 4 hour 5 set match.  I got the feeling that if he only played for 3 hours the match before, he would have given Djokovic some trouble."
tennis,3ctjl8,avaliantheel,11,Sat Jul 11 01:31:02 2015 UTC,20 aces against one of the best (if not the best) returners in the game. insane.
tennis,3ctjl8,jchaucer,7,Fri Jul 10 19:15:21 2015 UTC,"I guess they go by gross points won on the net points, becuase Murray definitely had the better percentage there."
tennis,3ctjl8,Thelonius-Drunk,20,Fri Jul 10 17:45:55 2015 UTC,"I think that's the right way to do it, otherwise you could have a serve & volley player at 19/20 appearing 'behind' a baseliner who got 1/1, with their single volley an easy put-away.  It's why Nadal has one of the highest net win percentages, but isn't the best player at the net - he only approaches when it's an easy win, or when he's forced to."
tennis,3ctjl8,Cosmic_Colin,2,Fri Jul 10 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don’t think it’s wrong per se, it’s just weird that they award the better percentages for most the other stats whereas on this one it’s a volume stat. But as you said it definitely makes sense, especially in the context of the match."
tennis,3ctjl8,Thelonius-Drunk,3,Fri Jul 10 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"More specifically, telling us the number of first serves and second serves is meaningless.  You know that each player served a lot in the match so the number is meaningless for something that is required by the rules.  You don't have to approach the net which is why knowing the number of points is important.  It gives us meaningful context so we have a better idea of how the match played out.  We know how aggressively each player played."
tennis,3ctjl8,avaliantheel,10,Sat Jul 11 01:40:31 2015 UTC,56 winners to 11 UE against Andy Murray just speaks volumes for his level of play today.
tennis,3ctjl8,egn56,3,Fri Jul 10 18:30:51 2015 UTC,Super impressive that Murray only had one break point for the entire match
tennis,3ctjl8,sweatybeard,2,Fri Jul 10 20:00:34 2015 UTC,"I usually go into a bad mood when Murray loses lol, not the case yesterday. Just imperious serving from Roger."
tennis,3ctjl8,Valinor_,0,Sat Jul 11 10:24:19 2015 UTC,"As long as RF keeps 1st serve % this high, Novak has no chance."
tennis,3ctjl8,Gay_Wolverine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"Thought I heard one of the commentators mention Novak hit around 74% of his first serves? If so, this'll be a final like the Agassi/Sampras US Open where there were no breaks."
tennis,3ctjl8,furious_20,-7,Fri Jul 10 21:22:08 2015 UTC,no
tennis,3ctjl8,TODDLER_PUSSY,10,Fri Jul 10 18:16:32 2015 UTC,Well I guess I'm wrong the Toddler_Pussy.
tennis,3ctjl8,Gay_Wolverine,-5,Fri Jul 10 18:20:02 2015 UTC,"You know who Novak Djokovich is right? You're speaking about him as if he's a pushover when in reality he is by far the best player in the world, and I'm a huge Fed fan. I want Fed to win, but I'd never, ever put my money against Novak in 2015. To say he has no chance is absurd."
tennis,3ctjl8,TODDLER_PUSSY,16,Fri Jul 10 18:22:47 2015 UTC,"Djokovic.   C'mon man, at least spell his last name correctly."
tennis,3ctjl8,alsamo579,-8,Fri Jul 10 18:49:52 2015 UTC,I'm sorry have you never made a spelling error?
tennis,3ctjl8,TODDLER_PUSSY,8,Fri Jul 10 19:13:33 2015 UTC,"I think you've made a lot of errors, TODDLER_PUSSY."
tennis,3ctjl8,arturoman,0,Fri Jul 10 20:19:49 2015 UTC,"He has no chance given RF keeps his 1st serve % this high. Are you even reading the statement? RF's 1st serve % was insanely high, he said the same at the post match interview. His serve really saved him and if he can maintain the same % (and low % unforced errors), then yes Novak has no chance and I stand by this."
tennis,3ctjl8,Gay_Wolverine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:37:25 2015 UTC,So you want me to tell the best returner has no chance of winning if a good server has a good 1 serve rate? Thats bullshit and shows how you have no clue about what you are talking. Its so hard to ace or pressure djokovic with you serve since hes so huge and balanced with fast reactions.
tennis,3ctjl8,Teezz,3,Fri Jul 10 19:45:35 2015 UTC,Djokovic did have issue against a good server this year.
tennis,3ctjl8,yesat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:41:12 2015 UTC,"Since he's so huge? He's shorter than Murray. I agree that Djokovic is a good returner, and that Fed has his work cut out for him, but Djokovic is by no means huge for a top-level tennis player."
tennis,3ctjl8,jroberts548,0,Sat Jul 11 11:38:33 2015 UTC,Dude that's like your opinion.
tennis,3ctjl8,Gay_Wolverine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:54:24 2015 UTC,1 double fault each.  That blows my fucking mind.

tennis,3cti0r,uglycrepes,13,Fri Jul 10 17:58:44 2015 UTC,Duncan though has won 5 himself and is the only player to do it over a span of 3 decades...he just won his last championship at age 37.
tennis,3cti0r,rbace,6,Fri Jul 10 18:22:01 2015 UTC,34 in tennis is like 39 in basketball.

Please just watch how Federers playing now, dismantling the third best tennis player on tour, a previous winner, nearly a decade after his peak."
tennis,3cti0r,Personacorona,18,Fri Jul 10 17:41:09 2015 UTC,And he wasn't as good as he was back then.
tennis,3cti0r,Pink_Cactus,38,Fri Jul 10 18:09:34 2015 UTC,I think that backhand passing shot by Fed in the last game sums up the match pretty well. He was godly today
tennis,3cti0r,quassus,15,Fri Jul 10 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"That was truly incredible--to me, possibly the shot of the tournament. Just a flick of the wrist on the run for an obscene angle and a clean passing winner. I want to see a replay of that shot.  Edit: Here it is"
tennis,3cti0r,Kool_AidJammer,4,Fri Jul 10 17:37:35 2015 UTC,That shot was not human.
tennis,3cti0r,Kashmir33,3,Fri Jul 10 17:45:16 2015 UTC,his backhanded passing flick in the first set was also absolutely ridiculous.

tennis,3cti0r,JonEverhart,74,Fri Jul 10 17:26:01 2015 UTC,He NEVER should have chosen not to serve first after winning the toss!

tennis,3cti0r,fawkesmulder,9,Fri Jul 10 17:35:57 2015 UTC,"hahaha exactly!  Serving first is huge! I can't even tell you how many sets are won 7-5 or 6-4 with breaking the opponent's serve to finish the set. Dozens of times in my life, at least.  Love to see the double faults come when it's 5-4 or 6-5 and my opponent is serving to tie it up. Get a double fault, get a point, you're sitting at 0-30. And then maybe another double fault, or mistakes, or you just winning a point, etc. The pressure is real."
tennis,3cti0r,outerspacegrass,3,Fri Jul 10 18:13:54 2015 UTC,"receiving first isn't all that bad either i think (for non pro levels) i tend to chose to receive first. I like to think that I have a decent chance at breaking serve in the first game by taking advantage of start of the match nervousness and the serve not being completely warmed up. Maybe mix up some unexpected shots  that you didnt show in warm up, in order to not let them get into the rhythm of the match. Also, its a small mental advantage knowing you can start off almost every match the same, since you will receive whether or not you win the choice.   Is it worth not having the chance to break back if you get broken at 5-4? I don't know. But usually being broken once is enough to lose the set whether or not you served first."

Obviously Fed wouldn't want to fall behind 2 sets, and that serve should help him. To win, I think Fed needs to finish in 4 sets max, if not straight sets. I think the first set will tell the story, but one can see this being a high quality back and forth match."

tennis,3cti0r,Jones_Crusher,10,Fri Jul 10 17:29:47 2015 UTC,Surgical is the perfect word for it
tennis,3cti0r,marauding_forward,8,Fri Jul 10 17:33:02 2015 UTC,People will see that scoreline and think Murray underperformed but that really wasn't the case. That was peak Roger today.
tennis,3cti0r,genteelblackhole,2,Fri Jul 10 17:30:08 2015 UTC,The scoreline doesn't quite tell the whole story in this case. Makes it look like a walkover when in fact it wasn't.
tennis,3cti0r,bustedracquet,81,Fri Jul 10 19:58:45 2015 UTC,"Andy Murray had 35 winners to 17 unforced errors, got 74% of his 1st serves in, won 70% of those points, and reached 50% of his 2nd serve points won, which is always a critical mark, and he lost. In straight sets. And only got 1 break point. Andy Murray played a phenomenal match and lost to Roger who played a perfect match.   Some amazing #'s from Rog today:   20 aces against the 2nd best returner in the game and one of the best of all-time. 76% first serves in, 84% first serve points won.  56 winners, 11 unforced errors. 10-0 in his career now in Wimbledon semifinal matches."
tennis,3cti0r,S3baman,16,Fri Jul 10 17:31:15 2015 UTC,Fed had a couple of games early in the second where he had a lot of UEs. I believe he had 4 in the 1st set and 0 in the 3rd. That's incredible
tennis,3cti0r,hivaidsislethal,9,Fri Jul 10 17:38:26 2015 UTC,Tbf Wimbledon counts UE less agressively than any other major. Numbers of UE at wimbledon are always deflated vs the other 3 majors.

tennis,3cti0r,Gay_Wolverine,6,Fri Jul 10 17:30:17 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm very pessimistic about most things but RF has been playing fantastic tennis on grass this year and Novak isn't. I know it's a controversial opinion but Novak isn't having a great grass season. All his matches he has won due to unforced errors from his opponents or cause they choked under pressure. Novak is playing decent at best but RF has this pretty much in the bag as long as he keeps his 1st serve % the same.
tennis,3cti0r,Fartoholic,24,Fri Jul 10 17:38:45 2015 UTC,We were saying the same last year as well. Fed came into the finals virtually unchallenged while Djokovic was looking a little out of form.
tennis,3cti0r,Personacorona,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:44:28 2015 UTC,Tbh Federer didn't play anybody at all until the finals
tennis,3cti0r,yesat,3,Fri Jul 10 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"He played big server on grass, which isn't the easiest thing to do. Djokovic went in 5 set against Anderson."
tennis,3cti0r,Personacorona,4,Fri Jul 10 18:01:42 2015 UTC,Yeah but Fed's always done extremely well against big servers while Djokovic hasn't
tennis,3cti0r,hivaidsislethal,12,Fri Jul 10 18:10:19 2015 UTC,"Djokovic's grass season is literally only wimbledon, he played poorly in the first two sets against Anderson but that guy was playing better than he ever did against Djokovic. He dismissed one of the guys leading the tournament in aces in straights against Cilic. He played solid today, nothing spectacular but it wasn't required. Federer definitely played amazing. It will be an interesting final."
tennis,3cti0r,asparagusburgers,2,Fri Jul 10 18:11:18 2015 UTC,"If Djokovic doesn't up his level from the way he played today, I think it's a genuine possibility."
tennis,3cti0r,abuttfarting,39,Fri Jul 10 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"There's enough said about Federer's brilliance, but one thing that should not be ignored is that Andy Murray played really, really, well.  74%/71% 1st serve, 9 aces, 35/17 winner UE.  Against any other opponent except Djokovic he would've won comfortably today."
tennis,3cti0r,Eagled1001,12,Fri Jul 10 17:31:13 2015 UTC,Hell I would have picked him over Djokovic today with numbers like that
tennis,3cti0r,btaz,8,Fri Jul 10 17:48:59 2015 UTC,I dunno. I felt that Andy played a lot of short balls to Fed today. Hence he was running around retrieving most of the time. I think Fed played really well but I think Andy could have done a lot more.
tennis,3cti0r,Gumpster07,12,Fri Jul 10 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of that was to do with how Fed played. He was super aggressive when he needed to be and didn't let Muzza dictate rallies too much. Muzza likes it when he can turn his defence into offence much like Nole, if Fed does the same to Nole on Sunday, I can see Fed win an 8th Wimbledon title."
tennis,3cti0r,btaz,2,Fri Jul 10 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I just felt that Murray did not try to be aggressive just as a change of tactics. Maybe it would have worked or failed miserably (and we would all be here saying what the heck was he thinking) but given how it ended, he should have tried that.   The one thing working a lot in Fed's favor is the surface is fast (same advantages as in Dubai and Shanghai) and he is playing really well. This should be enough even for Djokovic."
tennis,3cti0r,TheAbeLincoln,115,Fri Jul 10 18:41:02 2015 UTC,That Roger guy looks pretty decent. I think he has an exciting future ahead of him.

tennis,3cti0r,Thelonius-Drunk,19,Fri Jul 10 17:48:00 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who thinks if Federer brings the same game into the final it won’t be that close? This thread seems to think if he can do the same against Novak it’ll be a classic, but between how badly Anderson troubled him and how Gasquet took a break and had several break points I don’t think Novak is at the top of his game right now. If Fed brings this form into the final I really think it’ll be 4 sets to Roger unless Novak steps it up from his last few perfomances."

Djokovic was tested much more last year - 4 sets against Stepanek, 5 against Cilic, 4 against Dimitrov - and still squeaked it out in 5 in the final with very steady play.   I think this Sunday will again be a close affair with both players playing at a high level."

tennis,3cti0r,redditacc2015,6,Fri Jul 10 19:41:24 2015 UTC,What? Murray was arguably serving close to his best today and he was being pushed in nearly every service game. 74% first serves is huge from Murray.
tennis,3cti0r,btaz,2,Fri Jul 10 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"First set will be key. If Fed wins the first set - then he can close out the match quickly. If Novak wins the first set - then he will opt to play a grinding game. If the match gets to 4, Novak has a chance."

These are just ridiculous numbers from Fed whichever way you look at it, the guy didn't put a foot wrong in this match.  I still fancy Djokovic for the final, but if Fed continues to serve up these numbers, Djoker will have to bring his A++ game to win it all..."

Also he should have changed his game plan up a bit more, Fed didn't give him many free chances but Murray did have at least one chance to break. I didn't like how he was too willing to play short balls in and get into long rallies with Federer when that tactic didn't work in the first two sets.   Although this season, Murray has been playing his best since pre-surgery, the fact still remains that he has not beaten Djokovic or Federer for almost 2 years now."
tennis,3cti0r,ChaeDoc_II,16,Fri Jul 10 19:44:44 2015 UTC,"If you're wondering how Federer won so comfortably you only have to look at the ace count.  20 aces in three sets. Doesn't sound a lot until you consider that Murray is possibly the games best ever returner.  Their previous slam matches Federer only managed:  10 aces in a 4-set win (Aus 2014) 5 in a 5-set loss (Aus 2013) 12 in a 4-set win (Wim 2012) 11 in a 3-set win (Aus 2010) 3 in a 3-set win (US 2008)    Murray played a brilliant match, he's just never played someone who can hit serves past him with such frequency without them being 8 feet tall and their name ending in 'C'."

If this goes 5 I just don't think Federer, at this age, has the stamina to pull it out. But if he plays the way he played today we may not even get that far.  I'm gonna say Federer in 4. 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2  Or something like that"

tennis,3cti0r,binks21,4,Fri Jul 10 17:55:53 2015 UTC,an 18th Grand Slam for Roger is something I want to witness   a lot of us do!
tennis,3cti0r,No1eFan,5,Fri Jul 10 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"Congrats to Federer on some video game level tennis. My opinion on him has changed the last couple of years in that I do believe he is the greatest of all time purely in how he still wins and finds ways to improve at his current age, shouts to Edberg for making him attack net more and be more assertive on his backhand down the line. To those who say he was even better when he was younger I think physically sure but mentally his tenacity to come up with serves is more of a sign of his experience and championship caliber play. The performance today was pretty perfect.   That being said in terms of the final, sure, if Djoker is subpar and Federer serves like this of course Fed will win. That being said I don't believe how Fed served against Murray will be equal to how he will against Djokovic. Statistically Murray maybe a great returner but tennis like many sports is a game of match ups. Murray returns from 2+ meters behind the baseline which is completely insane to do against Federer especially on grass. Djokovic typically returns much closer and makes federer play more balls. In addition in baseline rallies today murray wasn't winning rallies.. which is due to his idea that his tactic was to play his best game against federer's best game and see if he could win. Djokovic survived 41 aces from anderson. He also survived 30 aces in the 2014 final. His returning is ""different"" and the match up is what causes issues for fed. Again if he is returning subpar and fed shows up it could easily be a 3-4 set affair. I personally have fed at an advantage because he is the type of player to carry his momentum, he similarly dismantled Raonic last year and carried his serving to a 7-6 set win in the finals, but slowly dropped off and lost his net rushing strategy. Djokovic is interesting in that his form in previous matches isn't really a precursor to his form later on. Furthermore I think Djokovic prevents Federer from attacking net as much as he would like because his passes are higher quality off of the return. Nadal has the most passive returns but gets them all back. Djokovic has a mixture of passive and deep attacking returns. Murray is somewhere inbetween but errs to the nadal side of things. The offensive return game of Djokovic is what makes him falling to the same fate as Andy a hard sell in the finals.  In any event as a fan of tennis last year 2014 final was my favorite match. This match I also hope will go down as one of my favorites just as 2007 20008 with Nadal. Win or lose Federer is the greatest just because his longevity has proven to me that he is just that good. Sure he might not always bring that game to other surfaces but his resolve is unparalleled.    While I'm gutted at the FO2015 loss to stan and I want djokovic to win no matter what sunday, I also want to see a tightly contested 5th set affair because its something we deserve as fans.  Cheers!"

He was super clinical and didn't let Murray have a sniff of break points after the very first game. Everytime Murray had a chance in the Fed serve games, Fed locked up shop and that was that.  It's awe-inspiring seeing a player of Fed's age do something as special as that against one of arguably this year's in form players."

Won more than 55% of 'medium' (not sure how IBM classified this) length rallies.   Huge respect towards Murray for never letting his focus loosen and his attitude positive throughout as he played one of the best performances I've seen outta him in a long time

He played really well today as well. But Fed was on another level. Stunning.   The way that he has adapted and changed his game to suit his aging legs is fantastic. In the past I've never really been able to fully want him to win. But I really do want him to win now. And I think he will. On yerself."
tennis,3ctmn1,The_Irish_Sea,3,Sat Jul 11 02:38:35 2015 UTC,"As a murray fan i'm not even mad, I just feel privileged to watch Federer at 100%."
tennis,3ctmn1,gg_2015,5,Sat Jul 11 03:57:06 2015 UTC,"That was because the points are played the typical Murray point, with great returns and great shotmaking, only Federer will not be fooled. You can't have much drama when you only have one break opportunity, and that was how crazy good Federer served today. However, Fed challenged in nearly all of Murray's service games.  Both guys played well for sure. Fed were just methodical and deadly today. 3 breaks, and they were on, in order: set point, set point, match point."
tennis,3ctmn1,TheMagicianDolph,16,Sat Jul 11 04:53:47 2015 UTC,The Murray/Djokovic Wimby match was fantastic too with a lot more at stake. A 3 setter that felt like 5 sets.
tennis,3ctmn1,juicaine,27,Fri Jul 10 18:02:26 2015 UTC,"In terms of quality, Djokovic was kinda flat. 31 winners to 40 unforced errors. 4 aces and 4 double faults. 65% first serves in. Andy was incredible but Novak was slightly off."

tennis,3ctmn1,ThatLiam,10,Sat Jul 11 00:14:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree. While it was entertaining the whole time it was just Murray fighting to hold serve. Good tennis but Federer was simply a beast today. Feds serve, returns, net play, and winners were just too good. He made Murray look weak out there and Murray is really good."
tennis,3ctmn1,Sloblock,23,Fri Jul 10 18:39:10 2015 UTC,I think it's possible for a very one-sided match to still be spectacular - which that was.
tennis,3ctmn1,redditacc2015,7,Fri Jul 10 18:54:10 2015 UTC,I only caught the final set and it seemed to me that almost every single point was won by high level tennis.
tennis,3ctmn1,winabean7,13,Fri Jul 10 19:29:11 2015 UTC,"This is it. Bang on. Murray was serving near his best but was fighting against a freight train on nearly all of his service games. He didn't really even get a whiff on the Fed serve and this is a guy who has won 2 grand slams, an Olympic gold, has gotten to the semis / finals of countless other GS and is widely regarded as being in the best form of his career (even better than he was in 2012-2013). Murray has been tearing it up all tournament (and for the past few months) and was completely dismantled. Fed simply hit too many unbelievable shots with a high percentage of success on top of serving like a guy on virtua tennis.  I see people thinking Djokovic could beat him playing like that but the reality is he won't. If Fed drops two levels and it goes to 5 then sure, but he plays like today and Djokovic's best bet is serving unbelievably well in the crunch games and getting it to a tiebreak, then maybe he could get a set.   I've been watching Fed all tournament and it's just looked like a semi amused cat playing with its food for a while, never really losing control, and then finishing any signs of resistance off when it's shown. I thought 'yeah but has he really been tested, and could he do this to Murray', and in all honesty nothing was really different today. I'm a huge Murray fan, and he played very well, but yeah, it wasn't close."

They've both been serving very well and as well as Fed is playing this tournament, his return game hasn't been all that amazing, he has played a large number of tie-breaks against even weak opponents in his last 10 matches.    Should be an epic."
tennis,3cvahf,Paragon_Flux,4,Sat Jul 11 07:47:46 2015 UTC,"I think this will be a different match than against Murray.  I was watching the Fed-Murray match again.  Murray had a tough time getting returns into play, often dropping them short.  I think he did that because he thought Federer might rush the net, but it allowed Federer to drive the shots down the line, and put Murray on the defense.  Also, because Murray was holding relatively easy in the first set, and because Federer was serving so well, I think Murray struggled a bit to get into rhythm.  He hit numerous shots into the net (at least, 8 by my count) which is something he doesn't do that often, so I don't know why it happened so much against Federer other than Fed was rushing him.  Fed played most of his good games at the end of sets where he broke, but early on, Murray held rather comfortably.  Not sure he can completely depend on that against Djokovic.  If Fed serves well, he should have a good chance to win, but I expect a tougher match, and that Fed won't be nearly as effective against Djokovic."
tennis,3cvahf,dropshot,0,Sat Jul 11 06:14:09 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. Djokovich looks susceptible on grass, and Murray was on Wimbledon winning form. These guys are all, still, at the absolute top of the game, and Djokovich is going to need to be perfect to beat Fed, because Federer is playing perfectly right now; his best tennis ever perhaps - his only weakness is weakness; Djokovich's best shot is to hold on to a set early and take the game long, and hope Fed gets tired."

He drops a gear and it might go to 4. Djokovic was taken to 5 last year by a slower Federer who's ground stroke play was significantly worse than it is now. Fed was serving very well - which heavily contributed to the match going the distance - but is certainly serving better this year as well.

He seemed really nervous last year but this year his play his much smoother and one of the key improvements is his inside out forehand.

tennis,3cu4mj,GATSBYH20,4,Fri Jul 10 23:26:08 2015 UTC,Good point. Just one contention: Djokovic is hardly a backboard.
tennis,3cu4mj,iwrotethissongin94,3,Sat Jul 11 03:26:17 2015 UTC,"Mentally, I give the edge to Fed. Murray was the hometown boy, so the support was sort of split even if in an obligatory way because, lets face it, more people love Federer. The finals will eventually turn almost into a Davis Cup like atmosphere, the crowd is going to be so squarely on the side of the guy they love, the guy who can make history, the older guy: Roger Federer. In the past, I've seen Novak become demoralized by how much love Fed gets over him, and I fully expect that to happen tomorrow. It's not going to be a factor immediately, but at some point, it's going to get close, or Fed will take a two set lead, the crowd is going to get euphoric for Fed, and Novak might just concede the match.   Novak and Murray are similar enough that Andy could be considered the ideal tune up for Novak. Novak is heavier and better off the ground, but they're essentially very similar. Fed couldn't be in a better position to win another Wimbledon title. If he plays like he did today, or close, serves anywhere above 70 percent or so, he wins it in 4 sets."
tennis,3cu4mj,GATSBYH20,8,Fri Jul 10 23:30:13 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you that the crowd will likely be heavily in Federer's favor. However, this has almost always been the case for Djokovic. He's had to face die-hard Federer or Nadal fans on so many occasions that I don't think it'll really impact him. The crowd was significantly in favor of Federer last year and it wasn't enough to pull him through that 5th set."
tennis,3cu4mj,iwrotethissongin94,2,Sat Jul 11 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"However, this has almost always been the case for Djokovic.   That's true. But Fed is playing incredibly well. Not sure if I said it here, but I acknowledged that even if Novak is irked by not getting the same love as Fed or Nadal, he's just so solid, he can just focus on execution and win. But Fed is playing very well, it's a Wimbledon final, he's a year older, and those 3 reasons together is why I mention the crowd being a factor, because Fed is always the crowd favorite and it's not something I feel the need to mention for every match."

tennis,3cu4mj,vunacar,2,Sat Jul 11 06:16:05 2015 UTC,"I think his confidence and immense crowd support will push him over the edge this year in four sets, if not straight sets. Djokovic is indeed a better returner than Murray, a more consistent serve (1st and 2nd), and more confident/accomplished. However, even if Fed doesn't play betterer than he did against Andy, just look at how great Andy had to play just to keep the score respectable.  Andy also brought his A game on his serve today, even on his usually weak 2nd serve. Fed was able to hit winners on some of his serves, not to mention those 3 timely breaks (2 on set points and 1 on match point). Obviously Djokovic is #1 for a reason, but I am confident on Fed's chances because of Fed's confidence on his game right now."

tennis,3cu4mj,vunacar,9,Fri Jul 10 22:13:25 2015 UTC,I guess you didn't hear during today's match when Roddick said Federer was serving better now than in the 2009 final.
tennis,3cu4mj,Jobin1616,-5,Fri Jul 10 22:32:48 2015 UTC,2009 final? This was last year vs Djokovic.

tennis,3cu4mj,dannhash,0,Fri Jul 10 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"He lost because his ground game was as bad as it can possibly be. Djokovic was absolutely dominant on his service games. Djokovic can't play much better and Federer can't play much worse from the baseline.   If Federer can serve close to the way he served in last year's final, his vastly improved ground game this year should be enough to give him the edge."
tennis,3cu4mj,Jackofalll,2,Sat Jul 11 03:24:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that, I feel like the reason Federer was able to impose his ground game against Murray was because of his serve PLACEMENT, not necessarily the amount serves he was getting in."

tennis,3cusyr,Personacorona,5,Sun Jul 12 02:43:32 2015 UTC,"I did this graph during the French Open as someone suggested that a good Big4 indicator/definition came from their presence in GS SF.  The Big4 peak domination is clearly 2011. The question is when to declare the period over.  Some people decided to call it over before the French Open because:   Nadal was having a bad year Djokovic was head and shoulders above everybody else Newcomers had won slams in 2014   If you want to believe the era is not quite over yet, based on these criteria it would require:   Nadal to come back at some point (waiting for the US Open) Djokovic to not win everything (done) No more Non-Big4 victories (waiting for the US Open)   Main scenarios now:   Nadal makes it to the US Open SF and there is no discussion: usual Big4 year Nadal doesn't make it to the US Open SF but the winner is Big4: 2007 situation (have to wait for 2016 to know!) Nadal doesn't make it to the US Open SF and the winner is non-Big4: discussion intensifies   This is of course only one way to look at it. I enjoyed doing it though because it shows quite a few things, among others why it is a Big4. Tsonga/Ferrer have 6 SF, Berdych has 5. Murray? 19!"

Secondly, I never understand why especially Wimbledon is so exclusive and so difficult for people outside of the UK to view. It is the biggest tennis tournament of the year and yet they're always so stingy in letting people view highlights, previous matches etc. It is an international event and they are lucky that for historic reasons it takes place in their country. The least they can do is be less clingy and let many more people around the world enjoy it."

The fact that they started something doesn't mean it should stay there forever.   I live in the EU and am not allowed to watch iPlayer."
tennis,3csoz8,yaaa_gunners_yaaa,8,Fri Jul 10 15:27:38 2015 UTC,Frankly this is one of the greatest displays of blithering idiocy I have seen on Reddit.   Wimbledon is a tennis club that hosts a tournament once a year that has grown to possess an immense amount of prestige and respect. You cannot simply artificially transpose that into another city.

tennis,3csde5,pikeamus,4,Fri Jul 10 12:54:35 2015 UTC,"I want it to run on as long as possible, so I am able to finish work before too much of the next semi has gone by."
tennis,3csde5,ASIC_SP,7,Fri Jul 10 12:58:10 2015 UTC,and it is a tie breaker!  can't help supporting the under dog Gasquet
tennis,3csde5,PTT_Derp,6,Fri Jul 10 13:00:13 2015 UTC,"Welp, I think this is it. It's been a good run for Gasquet."
tennis,3csde5,dannhash,12,Fri Jul 10 13:15:56 2015 UTC,Full respect for gasquet you can tell he's doing his absolute best
tennis,3csde5,missscottfraser,6,Fri Jul 10 12:32:09 2015 UTC,So many almost good points from Gasquet.
tennis,3csde5,Skyluz,7,Fri Jul 10 12:47:55 2015 UTC,"If Djokovic wins this set, it's all over. If Gasquet wins this set, we have a match on our hands."
tennis,3csde5,IAmNotASkycap,6,Fri Jul 10 12:59:44 2015 UTC,"Just run around everything and hit backhands, Richy."
tennis,3csde5,ImAlwaysLegit,7,Fri Jul 10 13:14:06 2015 UTC,Damn that shot by Novak
tennis,3csde5,PaintByLetters,7,Fri Jul 10 13:16:40 2015 UTC,Can someone explain to me how the computer system can calculate a shot being out by the width of a human hair like that?
tennis,3csde5,ThatLiam,6,Fri Jul 10 14:24:27 2015 UTC,The annoying thing is that it's only accurate to within 2-3mm so that might actually have been in.
tennis,3csde5,ScottishSeahawk,2,Fri Jul 10 14:26:50 2015 UTC,3.6mm is the calculated error number so it definitely could have been in.
tennis,3csde5,CaptainShocks,5,Fri Jul 10 14:30:48 2015 UTC,"It can track the flight trajectory in all 3 directions, X, Y, Z, using those radar cameras.  The court is a defined Z plane, and the lines are a defined X and Y lines.  It can detect where, X and Y, that ball intersects that plane of the court."
tennis,3csde5,ScottishSeahawk,6,Fri Jul 10 14:27:08 2015 UTC,Science.
tennis,3csde5,ThatLiam,6,Fri Jul 10 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"Just 7 more match points, Richard, then you can destroy him in the last three sets."
tennis,3csde5,itsmekathy,12,Fri Jul 10 14:28:58 2015 UTC,That Gasquet backhand is just sex
tennis,3csde5,KeyserSoze96,5,Fri Jul 10 12:31:16 2015 UTC,I swear I have seen like two first serves from Gasquet go in.
tennis,3csde5,Skyluz,5,Fri Jul 10 13:04:43 2015 UTC,Gasquet's forehand looks poor right now
tennis,3csde5,bustedracquet,4,Fri Jul 10 13:11:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting to note, that Roger, Andy, and Novak have all been apart of the last 3 Wimbledon finals, and they are all 1-1. Roger beat Andy, who beat Novak the next year, who beat Roger the next year."
tennis,3csde5,soxandpatriots1,6,Fri Jul 10 13:50:30 2015 UTC,Gasquet not giving up easily! love the effort
tennis,3csde5,goodstuff10,5,Fri Jul 10 14:31:06 2015 UTC,Going through all the comments makes it seem like Gasquet was blowing joker out of the water....
tennis,3csde5,tomdickandhairy,9,Fri Jul 10 14:59:22 2015 UTC,I think what makes Novak so dominant is that he doesn't appear it. So many times he seems phased or not on his game and then methodically picks a game to capitalize on mistakes and then it's done. Crazy
tennis,3csde5,pfc_bgd,6,Fri Jul 10 14:24:04 2015 UTC,Also hes solid as a fucking rock. He'll hit the same balls all day at a fairly good pace and its almost impossible to hit through him because hes so quick and a great counter puncher.
tennis,3csde5,CaptainShocks,4,Fri Jul 10 14:28:54 2015 UTC,"he's probably one of the most frustrating players to play against. When Fed beats you, he just beats your ass so fast you don't even know what happened. When Nadal used to beat asses, it would just look so ridiculous, you couldn't even get frustrated. Djokovic...well...he patiently looks for his chances, solid as a rock, and then he slowly picks up his aggressiveness as he starts building a lead. It's like getting choked by a python."
tennis,3csde5,red_280,9,Fri Jul 10 14:40:50 2015 UTC,Gasquet's forehand is falling apart since the beginning of that tiebreak.

tennis,3csde5,Skyluz,5,Fri Jul 10 12:33:45 2015 UTC,Gasquet could be up 0-40 here
tennis,3csde5,i-superhero,4,Fri Jul 10 12:47:45 2015 UTC,Great winner from Gasquet!
tennis,3csde5,DanteMustDie4,5,Fri Jul 10 12:51:59 2015 UTC,That backhand winner. Sex.
tennis,3csde5,jholachap,4,Fri Jul 10 12:52:04 2015 UTC,"Even tho matchup was deemed weaker of the two today the tennis we are watching today is beautiful.Lots of great points,Gasquet is playing good but Novak is on fire"
tennis,3csde5,missscottfraser,4,Fri Jul 10 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"Although gasquet is playing well, I think he's simply not good enough against djokovic......and it's showing."
tennis,3csde5,ThatLiam,6,Fri Jul 10 13:27:37 2015 UTC,Gasquet is playing some classy shots. Really want him to break.
tennis,3csde5,kuyakew,7,Fri Jul 10 14:21:15 2015 UTC,McEnroe still talking complete bollocks.
tennis,3csde5,Oh_Daesu,6,Fri Jul 10 14:21:47 2015 UTC,plz Gasquet
tennis,3csde5,manik_k,11,Fri Jul 10 12:33:32 2015 UTC,Djokovic is going to Djokovic him. It's not going to be pretty. Straight sets.
tennis,3csde5,red_280,3,Fri Jul 10 11:56:49 2015 UTC,Gasquet looks all pumped up. This could be interesting to watch.
tennis,3csde5,i-superhero,3,Fri Jul 10 12:30:26 2015 UTC,Trop bien!
tennis,3csde5,missscottfraser,3,Fri Jul 10 12:30:43 2015 UTC,Jesus can Novak run
tennis,3csde5,bustedracquet,2,Fri Jul 10 12:43:44 2015 UTC,He's one of the fittest in sport.
tennis,3csde5,BornInTheRSA,3,Fri Jul 10 12:45:12 2015 UTC,"94 MPH backhand, absolutely vaporized."
tennis,3csde5,dannhash,3,Fri Jul 10 12:45:05 2015 UTC,That backhand just keeps getting better and better for his game...
tennis,3csde5,rafessi,3,Fri Jul 10 12:46:06 2015 UTC,Gasquet nooooooooooo what the hell was that
tennis,3csde5,bustedracquet,3,Fri Jul 10 12:46:47 2015 UTC,"Gasquet's BH is an absolute thing of beauty...  But that was a horrendous miss, no need to go for so much in that shot."
tennis,3csde5,bustedracquet,3,Fri Jul 10 12:47:29 2015 UTC,Gasquet's backhand is a thing of beauty.
tennis,3csde5,BornInTheRSA,3,Fri Jul 10 12:52:10 2015 UTC,How many ridiculous passing shots have there been in this first set? Wow.
tennis,3csde5,i-superhero,3,Fri Jul 10 12:53:54 2015 UTC,"Just wish Gasquet wouldn't keep hitting great returns, only to miss the baseline after that."
tennis,3csde5,tvrwazza,3,Fri Jul 10 13:01:51 2015 UTC,Dammn Gasquet could've easily taken this set. Too many waste opportunities. Nice work from him though
tennis,3csde5,bustedracquet,3,Fri Jul 10 13:05:36 2015 UTC,Thiery Henry and Sir Alex in the house!!
tennis,3csde5,Skyluz,3,Fri Jul 10 13:07:33 2015 UTC,"Gasquet's fucked, Novak has woken up."
tennis,3csde5,zomb1,3,Fri Jul 10 13:16:25 2015 UTC,Good hold.
tennis,3csde5,thesmallprint13,3,Fri Jul 10 13:19:53 2015 UTC,Why is Djokovic so angry? He is a set and a break up...
tennis,3csde5,Skyluz,5,Fri Jul 10 13:27:43 2015 UTC,because angry djokovic is scary djokovic
tennis,3csde5,gladiatorface,3,Fri Jul 10 13:31:15 2015 UTC,Fucking hell that was a lifeline for Richard

tennis,3csde5,ScottishSeahawk,3,Fri Jul 10 14:06:03 2015 UTC,Gasquet looks gassed. Great tournament for him though. Hope it translates to the hardcourt season. Top 10!
tennis,3csde5,sweetmatter,3,Fri Jul 10 14:07:36 2015 UTC,That was a nice point. These little flashes form Gassy have kept this interesting...
tennis,3csde5,mathen,3,Fri Jul 10 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"Gasquet has great touch and a world class backhand. He needs to work on serve, footwork, mental and forehand and he could be up there at the top."
tennis,3csde5,nuginization,10,Fri Jul 10 14:32:53 2015 UTC,All you haters saying this was going to be an annihilation can frig off

tennis,3csde5,red_280,7,Fri Jul 10 13:10:29 2015 UTC,"Since everybody is so confident about Djokovic winning in straight sets, hope Gasquet wins the first set somehow. Come on, who the hell wants a 85 minutes long semifinal?! Allez Richard!"
tennis,3csde5,rafessi,8,Fri Jul 10 12:01:28 2015 UTC,So I as an Australian don't have to stay up to some ridiculous hour to catch Federer-Murray.
tennis,3csde5,dhendy91,2,Fri Jul 10 12:15:21 2015 UTC,"Djokovic will win in straights, but I hope Gasquet can at least make a match of it.  He should just come out and play freely without any pressure, easier said than done of course...."
tennis,3csde5,1931078649,2,Fri Jul 10 11:49:05 2015 UTC,I could watch that Gasquet backhand all day long!

tennis,3csde5,ThatLiam,2,Fri Jul 10 12:22:52 2015 UTC,"Big weapon for Novak will be high balls to the Gasquet backhand, causing him to just slice everytime into the middle of the court. Then Novak takes over every rally."
tennis,3csde5,TheKk-47,2,Fri Jul 10 12:23:51 2015 UTC,Allez!
tennis,3csde5,Skyluz,2,Fri Jul 10 12:24:13 2015 UTC,"Oh come on Novak, jeez, if Fed or Murray don't tire themselves out, one of them will win this tournament easily."

tennis,3csde5,tvrwazza,2,Fri Jul 10 12:28:33 2015 UTC,gasquet is playing remarkable and djokovic looks lost but early in the match
tennis,3csde5,marcpr,2,Fri Jul 10 12:30:52 2015 UTC,Backhands being produced by gasquet are lovely!!
tennis,3csde5,missscottfraser,2,Fri Jul 10 12:30:56 2015 UTC,Oh man Gasquet wasted opportunity...
tennis,3csde5,ThatLiam,2,Fri Jul 10 12:31:14 2015 UTC,Come on Gasquet!
tennis,3csde5,BornInTheRSA,2,Fri Jul 10 12:31:19 2015 UTC,What a point...
tennis,3csde5,Average_Pimpin,2,Fri Jul 10 12:31:53 2015 UTC,Crazy volley... where was that backhand on that last shot?
tennis,3csde5,ScottishSeahawk,2,Fri Jul 10 12:32:07 2015 UTC,Gasquet missed a trick there could so easily have had two break points. Great match so far let's hope this keeps up
tennis,3csde5,BornInTheRSA,2,Fri Jul 10 12:32:33 2015 UTC,Really hope Gasquet can keep this up for the match but I fear he won't be able to...give Djokovic anything and he will run away with it.
tennis,3csde5,ScottishSeahawk,2,Fri Jul 10 12:33:43 2015 UTC,What a rally!
tennis,3csde5,dannhash,2,Fri Jul 10 12:43:52 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, that was awesome."
tennis,3csde5,bustedracquet,2,Fri Jul 10 12:44:15 2015 UTC,Guys anyone know how I can get roddick's commentary? Is there any site or something?
tennis,3csde5,Skyluz,2,Fri Jul 10 12:45:47 2015 UTC,"So happy Gasquet got that break back at the beginning of the match, really has given him a wave of confidence. Could have gone the way of their French Open match if Novak had gotten off to a 3-0 lead."
tennis,3csde5,bustedracquet,2,Fri Jul 10 12:45:59 2015 UTC,Noooooo
tennis,3csde5,Average_Pimpin,2,Fri Jul 10 12:46:31 2015 UTC,"Damn Richard, wish he had taken the backhand volley there."
tennis,3csde5,marcpr,2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:05 2015 UTC,Dicky Gasquet's gonna break everyone's heart isn't he
tennis,3csde5,MoreDblRainbows,2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"Again missed opportunity, watch Nole win the game now..."
tennis,3csde5,bustedracquet,2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:43 2015 UTC,"I just woke up, have not even been watching the match and I knew that was going to happen."
tennis,3csde5,i-superhero,2,Fri Jul 10 12:48:57 2015 UTC,"Big hold for Novak even though it may not have seemed like one. He asserted some control after Gasquet was punishing him from the back of the court. I'm expecting him to take it up a level in this game and grab the break and the set.   EDIT: Well he did step it up, but Gasquet was ready for the challenge."
tennis,3csde5,sweetmatter,2,Fri Jul 10 12:49:02 2015 UTC,"Hahaha Novak at the end ""goddamit"""

tennis,3csde5,ASIC_SP,2,Fri Jul 10 13:02:35 2015 UTC,Gasquet will need to get a lot of first serves in during this service game.
tennis,3csde5,ThatLiam,2,Fri Jul 10 12:55:03 2015 UTC,"Tie break will be interesting, if it comes to that"
tennis,3csde5,Skyluz,2,Fri Jul 10 12:55:34 2015 UTC,Nooo.

tennis,3csde5,compileandrun,2,Fri Jul 10 13:04:30 2015 UTC,Gasquet being Gasquet in this tiebreak
tennis,3csde5,That70smoke,2,Fri Jul 10 13:04:43 2015 UTC,I feel like Gasquet is missing his chances or half-chances so to say and slowly he'll see he's losing this match as pressure and stress builds up.
tennis,3csde5,ASIC_SP,2,Fri Jul 10 13:05:07 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Gasquet will be ranked in the top 8 players by next years Wimbledon.
tennis,3csde5,marcpr,2,Fri Jul 10 13:05:30 2015 UTC,so that missed overhead has been costly..  wonder if Gasquet can keep up intensity
tennis,3csde5,BornInTheRSA,2,Fri Jul 10 13:06:05 2015 UTC,Welp that's it for Gasquet
tennis,3csde5,tvrwazza,2,Fri Jul 10 13:09:19 2015 UTC,"Man, Gasquet looked confident and on the attack up until that tiebreak..."
tennis,3csde5,ustegfail1465,2,Fri Jul 10 13:12:16 2015 UTC,Oh man the forehand is not quite up there with the backhand! That is hurting gasquet.
tennis,3csde5,i-superhero,2,Fri Jul 10 13:12:26 2015 UTC,there goes the first set....now gasquet seriously needs to maintain that first set level to have any chance
tennis,3csde5,KeyserSoze96,2,Fri Jul 10 13:14:31 2015 UTC,Gasquet mateeee come on you can do better than this
tennis,3csde5,tvrwazza,2,Fri Jul 10 13:16:12 2015 UTC,I'd certainly be okay with a rematch of last years final
tennis,3csde5,Skyluz,2,Fri Jul 10 13:16:46 2015 UTC,If nole picks up winners like that against those backhands then its over in 3 sets!
tennis,3csde5,THAT_GIRL16,2,Fri Jul 10 13:17:27 2015 UTC,I knew this would happen
tennis,3csde5,BornInTheRSA,2,Fri Jul 10 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"All I want is for this one to be tight. I don't want 3 7-6 sets, I want a five setter where one point either way could decide the match. I want that for both semis. The women (well, Maria) disappointed yesterday because the second semi was like a round of 16 match."
tennis,3csde5,bang_sloots,2,Fri Jul 10 13:18:59 2015 UTC,Hoping this means he comes back from those last 2 games...
tennis,3csde5,Sidarlo,2,Fri Jul 10 13:20:00 2015 UTC,Man.. that was the least effort I've ever seen put into an approach shot
tennis,3csde5,PaintByLetters,2,Fri Jul 10 13:23:19 2015 UTC,I can't help but feel Gasquet had to win that tie-break to have any chance. Hope i'm wrong and we have a great match
tennis,3csde5,tee5150ii,2,Fri Jul 10 13:23:35 2015 UTC,It would bananas if Gasquet finally puts it all together and wins Wimbledon this year.
tennis,3csde5,DanteMustDie4,2,Fri Jul 10 13:24:30 2015 UTC,I'm thinking longer points will wear down RG prematurely. He kind of already looks tired by the end of games...might be a diversion tactic perhaps?
tennis,3csde5,melodicsyrup,2,Fri Jul 10 13:25:03 2015 UTC,"Some crazy shots by Gasquet almost got him a break,but Djokovic mentality wins out"
tennis,3csde5,PaintByLetters,2,Fri Jul 10 13:27:30 2015 UTC,"When Gasquet is serving, I love that before he tosses the ball he does that little thing with his racquet which is like ""Let us dual."""
tennis,3csde5,That70smoke,2,Fri Jul 10 13:28:55 2015 UTC,Gasquet has to get deeper shots on return of serve or Djokovic is just going to keep him on his heels every time he serves.
tennis,3csde5,BornInTheRSA,2,Fri Jul 10 13:33:35 2015 UTC,I love gasquet's backhand.

tennis,3csde5,dannhash,3,Fri Jul 10 12:26:00 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it seems this is approaching its expected outcome. The way Đoković is playing these days, I can only imagine him losing to an absolutely Herculean, once-in-a-thousand effort (FO final Wawrinka style), and I honestly don't see neither Federer nor Murray as being able to pull that off come this Sunday.   If you're reading this, I'd gladly eat my own words, Roger!"

tennis,3ctmvv,mihir1993,9,Fri Jul 10 18:00:37 2015 UTC,"I truly believe that he would have beaten anyone else on the planet today, other than Federer in god mode."
tennis,3ctmvv,cuntarsetits,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:08:03 2015 UTC,"What really hurt Murray was not being able to get into many of Federer's service games. Federer was generally getting about 2 easy points on serve, sometimes 3, and even when Murray returned the serve, he dropped it short, or if he hit it deep, it was a bit high and spinny without much pace. Murray tried to hit the angle return a few times, but Federer did a pretty good job of blocking it (in the ad court) down the line with his backhand or slicing it back deep crosscourt.   Even better than Novak?"
tennis,3ctmvv,The_Irish_Sea,2,Sat Jul 11 11:29:23 2015 UTC,"I think so. I think Federer's serve in this tournament has been the most impregnable it's ever been, and a more consistently devastating weapon than anyone else's in the tournament by some distance. In addition, Federer yesterday (and through most of tournament really) just had no lulls, wobbles or lapses of concentration during the match whatsoever. It was like facing a sheer cliff face without a single toehold or handhold anywhere to get a purchase on. Djokovic by contrast has looked vulnerable and shaky in all sorts of places throughout the tournament and I could easily have seen a Djokovic-Murray match up yesterday going the same way as the 2013 final, based on their apparent current respective forms. It'll be fascinating to see what Djokovic can do if Federer maintains the same level in the final."

tennis,3ctmvv,The_Irish_Sea,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:28:53 2015 UTC,"He did many things well, and still lost.  He served at a high percentage (for him), comparable to Federer (at the least, by the end).  He hit his second serve harder than he normally does (90 mph as opposed to 75 mph).  What really hurt Murray was not being able to get into many of Federer's service games.  Federer was generally getting about 2 easy points on serve, sometimes 3, and even when Murray returned the serve, he dropped it short, or if he hit it deep, it was a bit high and spinny without much pace.  Murray tried to hit the angle return a few times, but Federer did a pretty good job of blocking it (in the ad court) down the line with his backhand or slicing it back deep crosscourt.  It really came down to a few mistakes, such as being lulled into bad approaches (I think he lost both first and second sets on a bad approach that Fed did a good job at passing), or netting shots.  GB has a tough time to play France.  France is so deep, that it can field, 2, maybe 3, different teams that could be successful.  Among the players they can pick from are: Tsonga, Monfils, Simon, Gasquet, etc.  Looks like they've opted to go with Tsonga, Simon, Gasquet, and Mahut.  Any of those players (including Mahut) would have a good shot at beating James Ward.  This means Murray has to win both singles (which he's capable of) though two players are in good form (Gasquet and Simon), and even Tsonga is probably playing well.  They'd also have to win doubles.  Jamie Murray is in the finals of the Wimbledon doubles, and he did a decent job with Dominic Inglot even though he normally pairs up with Aussie, John Peers.  The French are pretty good in doubles as well, though they seem to be adding one additional singles players (given you can only nominate 4 total players), rather than have a pure doubles team (like the US does)."
tennis,3ctmvv,dropshot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:35:41 2015 UTC,"He played well, but seriously needs to work on that second serve. The margins are so small in matches like these.  If the same Federer turns up on Sunday, Djokovic will get a similar pounding."
tennis,3ctmvv,scouting4food,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:35:42 2015 UTC,Here's something he did really well and nobody is talking about. He really made it hard for Roger to volley. Usually if Roger approaches the net he wins 80%+ of the points. Yesterday he only did like 65% because Murray was really good at throwing parallel passing shots and lobs.
tennis,3ctmvv,PicopicoEMD,-20,Sat Jul 11 17:11:56 2015 UTC,Murray has no charisma at all.
tennis,3ctmvv,StanDidNothingWrong,11,Fri Jul 10 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure what charisma has to do with tennis abilities But actually, he does have a lot of charisma. He's well-spoken and pretty hilarious, if dry British humor is your thing."
tennis,3ctmvv,winabean7,-7,Fri Jul 10 20:33:48 2015 UTC,I'll explain the connection. If Murray had the ability and record of a GOAT; if he had won two or three grand slams every year at his peak - the sport would lose a lot of its popularity. For a man like him to be the face of tennis even for a short time would be a problem because his victories would fail to inspire interest in the game.   Ps: He isn't funny either.

I thought it would have taken her another year to get the consistency in her game to go deep with several wins in a slam.  I am rooting for Serena, but I know Mugs will bring her A game so it should be a good match.  Not to be a Debbie downer, but, since 2005, players in their maiden slam final only have a 3-15 record, with only a 1-5 record at Wimbledon.

Regardless of whether they could expect to reach Serena's size, it seems they are missing out on a chance to improve their game.  But another thing that went unremarked here: surely there are plenty of pro women who are willing to bulk up as much as need be to reach the top.  The fact that they have not (except a few like Serena and Venus) reached peak success suggests that other factors may be more important."

tennis,3csva9,flat_tamales,5,Fri Jul 10 17:35:04 2015 UTC,I'm with you. The fact that people even think players with body types like aga or ivanovic can bulk up to Serena levels and are just choosing not to due to body image concerns is ludicrous. I also believe Serena 0 percent when she said she doesn't lift weights or hasn't lifted weights.

tennis,3csva9,KyleG,4,Sat Jul 11 04:26:25 2015 UTC,"For women, the key is lower body strength. Serena uses that to the extreme. This is one of the reasons her serve is so devastating.  Women simply can't bulk up in upper body strength. It is a biological fact. A 50% statistical average male is a 99% female in upper body strength. Where women excel is lower body strength. The more they can use that in their games, the better they will be."

Practice (not playing in matches) will help.  But even the best players dump an easy one into the net now and then.    It's only recently (since I had kids) that I don't expect 100% positive performance, and sometimes enjoy the challenge of getting out of trouble.  Making that shot down the line on the run is so satisfying.   Also, since I've relaxed, I don't mind losing.  I just like to focus on those great shots that make the game worth playing.  Always think about your best serve of the day, or that great passing shot you made, or that sweet volley get.  It won't always work, but there's always another point."

tennis,3cvmxv,chad311,3,Sat Jul 11 03:49:47 2015 UTC,"This is likely an unanswerable question.  Who are Federer's competitors for GOAT?  The three other possibilities are: Nadal, Sampras, and Laver.  I think we can eliminate Sampras because Federer has as many Wimbledons as Sampras, and Federer has the career Slam while Sampras never made the finals of the French.  Then, there's Nadal.  Nadal has a few things going for him.  First, he's up there at 14 Slams, so he's in the neighborhood of Federer.  He's also got a career Slam.  The biggest thing he has going for him is his head-to-head against Federer which he dominates.  He also has an Olympic gold, but some consider this not terribly important.  For the time being, Federer probably is ahead of Nadal, and this will be reinforced if Nadal somehow goes in decline, and doesn't win another Slam.  For now, he's also ahead of Djokovic because his Slam count is so far ahead of Djokovic.  Then, there's Laver.  Federer has more Slams, but Laver has the two calendar year Grand Slams.  There are many reasons why people might discount those Slams.  For example, only amateurs were allowed to compete in 1962 which limited the field.  On the flip side, one could discount the 1969 because this was early in the Open era.  The pro circuit had a limited number of players (probably under 100 worldwide), and these pros played a lot, so if you were the best of the pros, then, you would do well in Open tennis.  The argument that's usually made is that if Federer could play Laver, he'd whip him, and the competition today is so much stronger than it was during Laver's day, and Laver played so long ago that it shouldn't count.  Even so, he does have two calendar year Grand Slams, and Federer doesn't, so there could be those who think Laver is the GOAT.  Some will choose not to believe that because they never saw him play, so he doesn't count based on that criteria.  What would have helped Federer's case is to have beaten Nadal at the French Open on clay, and if he had done it twice, then it would have shown he was competitive on all surfaces."
tennis,3cvmxv,dropshot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:07:28 2015 UTC,Time is a continuum and things can change. If we take a snapshot of this moment in time Federer is the GOAT and this is something that's already been settled.

tennis,3cs2zt,AsSimpleAsSnow,4,Fri Jul 10 10:56:16 2015 UTC,"How much influence do you guys think these types of stats have on today's matches?   I'd say for Djokovic and Murray very little. They're both insanely fit athletes (not that Federer and Gasquet aren't) and have played great tennis before with similar or worse conditions. My thoughts are that they've all trained their bodies to peak fitness and have very strict recovery regimes between matches to ensure they're ready to play their best.   The only area I see these types of stats having great importance in is the likelihood of injury, which to my knowledge none of them have reported anything serious.   Another thought to consider is to think of any advantages more time on-court might entail. I'd think that going into the last two rounds a player would favor having at least played some tough matches prior. This might apply to Federer who, relative to the other 3 players, hasn't been challenged too much so far.   Who knows though!"
tennis,3cs2zt,TenNes,4,Fri Jul 10 13:20:04 2015 UTC,"The longer you're on court, the bigger of a deal it is, especially depending on who your next opponent is.

tennis,3cs2zt,maskiwear,2,Fri Jul 10 13:58:09 2015 UTC,"I partly agree with you. It's true that especially Murray in Djokovic, who are in their peak years, have great fitness and are able to recover fast. However, by the end of the tournament players get worn down and it gets tougher and tougher for them. For example, Novak was pretty tired today by the end of the second set. He did not look fresh and if he had played Wawrinka, he would have been in huge trouble. Every minute on the court counts and Federer knows that way too well. That's why he hasn't suffered any serious injuries in his career and is still phenomenal at almost 34 years of age!"

tennis,3ctjbw,GanduBaadshah,14,Fri Jul 10 17:34:37 2015 UTC,"This is a much bigger match for Roger's legacy. If he wins? 18 Slams? A ridiculous number and 4 greater than Nadal. I think it would cement GOAT status based on slam count, balance, and longevity. 18 slams with 8 Wimb / 5 US / 4 Aus/ a French title with 3 additional finals appearances, with the last Wimbledon coming at age 33? Unreal. A loss would nothing to be ashamed of in a vacuum - Djokovic is the number 1 player in the world and is 5 years younger. But it would be hard not to think Federer has lost his last chance for another slam. We all said the same thing going into last year's final, but Time is undefeated and Federer is at greater risk for a huge decline with each passing year.  For Djokovic, this match is just another small building block in the legacy of the most consistent player this decade. 15 finals appearances in the last 20 slams, plus the 2013 French semifinal which was basically the final. 4-6 in his last 10 finals but, with a few exceptions, it has taken some unreal performances to defeat him (Wawrinka...), and he has nabbed career-defining victories agains the two greatest players of all time in two of the best matches ever played (2012 Aussie v. Nadal, 2014 Wimbledon v. Federer). Say what you want but the dude just makes finals and is consistently putting himself in a position to win. With his freakish conditioning it's hard not to see him making several more Slam finals in years to come, and if he can duplicate what Federer has done by keeping up his play in his 30s...who knows where he'll end up. 9 slams is better than 8, and a win is better than a loss, but this isn't much more than business as usual for Djokovic.  Obviously I'm biased as a Nole fan...would love to hear other perspectives on this!"

tennis,3ctjbw,UnrealLuigi,2,Fri Jul 10 21:07:55 2015 UTC,"I'll give you that the Murray losses are suspect in retrospect, but look at his other finals losses. 3 against prime Nadal, including 2 at Rolland Garros? Prime 07 Federer when Novak was 20? God disguised as Stan Wawrinka?   Would his legacy be better if he hadn't even made it to those finals?

tennis,3ctjbw,SleepingAntz,6,Sat Jul 11 01:04:37 2015 UTC,"For Novak's career, I think nothing. He's still the best player over the course of a year and he'll win multiple GS after this match.

tennis,3ctjbw,strike2867,2,Fri Jul 10 18:22:46 2015 UTC,"Well, in the sense that if he can win slams at almost 34 by beating the best player in the world in the final, there's not much left to prove, even to his most serious doubters. Not saying he'll retire or won't compete afterwards, but let's face it, his chances are numbered now."
tennis,3ctjbw,S3baman,2,Fri Jul 10 18:24:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like Roger knows he needs a few more slams and possibly Olympic singles gold to cement his GOAT status. He is playing the best I've seen since 2007.   Novak will be 29 next year, the year that practically every tennis player seems to significantly start dropping off. He won't be remembered as one of the all time greats unless he uses this time to rack up the slam count. Winning for Novak here also brings the h2h to 20-20.   I'm a devout Fed fan, but I think he's going to have to play just like today to beat Novak. Just like Nadal, he tends to raise his game whenever he plays Roger."
tennis,3ctjbw,SLOWHAND87,7,Fri Jul 10 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"He won't be remembered? He has 8 GS and double the amount of appearances. All the masters, all the wins in big matches. He will definitely be remembered as one of the greats."

It is with guarantee that we will one day have robots (not necessarily human form, but perhaps a blocky machine that can slide across the court and hit balls) that can play with a racquet against us, eventually getting to the point where you can program them for perfection (beating humans guaranteed) or to play within 'human' limits (e.g. does not exceed force of fastest server on tour, does not exceed a certain speed, and has a certain degree of inaccuracy built in).    The former would be great to train players up, and there will be an array of 'profiles' you can play against (Federer, minus the smoothness of motion; Nadal with the high bounce and overlong, illegal time between points; and others). Experts will craft these profiles from a minimum of 200 hours of playing footage analysed and used for the system.    There will also be a profile that skews its play to force you to employ your weak shots; e.g. if your backhand sucks, you'll be hitting a higher percentage of backhands until your ro-pponent thinks you've improved enough.

tennis,3cti7a,MachinTrucChose,5,Fri Jul 10 17:26:12 2015 UTC,"1) Not significantly, modern top players are fit enough to avoid that. Occasionally you get abnormally long matches that do impact players in their next matches, e.g. Isner v Mahut, Wimbledon 2011, 70-68 in final set or Federer v del Potro, Olympics 2012, 18-16 or something like that.   2) Not often. Sometimes if you are losing by a large margin in a set you don't give your absolute 100%, but other than that you never give up- tennis sets can swing one way or another in a flash and you always want to manufacture any opportunities that you can. As for being frowned upon by fans, that only happens in the case of blatant tanking, e.g. Kyrgios v Gasquet this year at Wimbledon."
tennis,3cti7a,Lumos309,3,Fri Jul 10 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"1) tough question to answer ... depends on how long the match was, how many long matches the player had in the tourney, and the fitness level of the player  2) fairly common but not rampant on tour, most guys will fight for all sets in best of 3, regardless of the score but in slams, more common to see a guy call a set a lost cause when it's best of 5."
tennis,3cti7a,Sebastien447,2,Fri Jul 10 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"1) Tennis players are extremely fit, and usually you get a couple of days of rest until the next game, as opposed to usually a week in football. I think tennis is a sport that is very tiring while playing, but not too hard to recover from though. So I'd say not a huge advantage to play a short match, but there are exceptions of course, like injury in longer matches.   2) They would never sacrifice a set, they're too important, but a game yes sometimes. If you're down 0:40 on the other player's serve, and you have to serve well next, then sometimes it's not worth it to try to win 5 or more points in a row.   Additional: You often see players try to cut the opponent's rhythm. This is when the opponent is playing better than you, and you can feel he/she has the momentum or crowd with them. Sometimes a player will call for a medical time out to just pause the game, will leave the court to cut the flow, challenge a point, have long pauses between serves, etc... When Federer plays well, his service games are incredibly fast, this is done to simply keep playing while you're feeling it well. Nadal is known to resort to medical time outs and things like that, to cut the opponent's flow off. In football you sometimes see time wasting, making injuries seem worse, when the match is close to finishing and you're winning, to just cut the flow of the other team."
tennis,3cti7a,SwissBliss,2,Fri Jul 10 18:57:33 2015 UTC,"For (1), it depends on the fitness of the players.  The top players tend to be very fit.  Some of the lower ranked players may not be as fit (for whatever reason).  There have been occasions where a player played a lengthy semifinal match, but still won the final.  For example, in 2012 Australian Open, Djokovic played 5 hours against Murray in the semis, then 6 hours against Nadal in the finals, and won.  In 2009, Nadal played a lengthy match against Verdasco in the semis, then beat Federer (who had a straight set win in the semis) in the finals in 5 sets.  Federer, to be fair, didn't try to play long rallies to wear Nadal down (not his style of play).  On the other hand, Federer played a lengthy semifinal in the 2012 Olympics, and had nothing much to offer against Murray in the finals.  Similarly, Djokovic had a lengthy semifinal in 2013 Wimbledon, and had little for the finals against Murray.  Both semifinals, coincidentally, were against del Potro.  However, accumulated matches can affect a player.  For example, Nishikori, in last year's US Open, played a five setter against Raonic and Wawrinka, then a four setter against Djokovic.  He seemed a bit tired in the finals which he lost to Cilic.  Having said that, Edberg, back in 1992 US Open, played three 5-setters in a row (Krajicek, Lendl, Chang), but still won the event (over Sampras).  Admittedly, he was a serve and volleyer, but even so.  In any case, tennis players tend to be rather fit, and tennis is more than just a game of fitness (as football is).  There's also the power game (big serve, big groundstrokes) that can reduce the amount of energy required.  Fatigue can be a factor, but I wouldn't say it's huge, though it does affect lower ranked players more (since they play fewer matches per tournament, and aren't used to the kind of physical stress that higher ranked players are).  With regards to (2), it depends.  The one match I recall where this likely happened is the 1992 Wimbledon final, Agassi vs. Ivanisevic.  Ivanisevic got early breaks in the fourth, and I think Agassi decided to not try to win that set, and take his chances in the fifth.  I think Federer's done it before too.  In one of many numerous Federer-Djokovic US Open semis match, I believe Federer gives up on two sets (it was the 2010 US Open semis, and the set scores were 6-1 and 6-2 which he lost) once he got down a break.  At the time, I think Federer was a little scared about his fitness.  If he tried too hard against Djokovic, he wouldn't have enough energy to play Nadal, esp. with semis and finals on back to back days at the US Open (as it turns out, it was delayed to Monday).  However, the strategy backfired because Fed ended up losing that match despite having a match point.  In best of 3 sets, which is what most players play, there's usually no worry about fatigue, so players can opt to try to come back if they can (of course, they are generally down for a reason).  I don't think fans care if a player does this or not, because of tennis's unusual scoring structure.  You can always win the next set if you play badly in one set.  I suppose tennis players occasionally use things to disrupt the rhythm of another player.  John McEnroe frequently had arguments with the chair umpire when he played.  Maybe he was genuinely angry, but it likely disrupted the opponent's focus.  These days, it's more common for players to ask to see a trainer or to take an injury timeout.  Sometimes these breaks cause an opponent who is playing hot to cool off.  Fans don't particularly like this because they want to see a player that's hot continue to play that way.  One time, Sloane Stephens was playing Victoria Azarenka, and Azarenka took an injury time out.  Stephens was playing well and winning, then afterwards, Azarenka was winning.  Azarenka admitted she was having trouble with Stephens, then kinda backpedalled because it sounded bad.   (2013 Australian Open, I think)."
tennis,3cti7a,dropshot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:21:19 2015 UTC,"1).  It depends on the fitness of the winning player and the matchup for the next round.  More often than not, the player who had to play longer and run more in the previous match will not be as fresh in the following match.  That is of course assuming that the matchup for the next match has two players of equal caliber.  If it's someone from the big 4 who wins a 5 setter and moves on to play someone in the ranked in the teens, odds are the big 4 will still win the match.  If it's against another top 10 opponent though, it's a tossup.  If it's against another person in the big 4, the fresher of the two will have an advantage.  2).  Another word for tactically sacrificing a set is tanking.  No player who is mentally strong will stop fighting for a set intentionally.  Players who have their spirits broken may not be able to play their hardest but they won't just give away a whole set intentionally.  A lot of times you'll see players who accept that the other guy is playing too well to lose the current set so they'll try to just stop making mistakes to set up for the next set.  That's not the same as sacrificing a set."
tennis,3cti7a,avaliantheel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with most people here. The only time there is a real disadvantage with resting between matches is when someone has a match held-over for rain or something and then have to play on what otherwise may be their day off. That may give their next opponent some extra rest, but for the most part it doesn't play too much of a factor.  It isn't too common for someone to sacrafic a set to save energy, simply because player rhythm and momentum plays a large part in tennis. If you drop your level, it may be difficult to come back out firing in a higher gear - and it may give your opponent a huge mental advantage that they are confident in victory, which affects their play positively.  That said, some player have done that, with mixed results."

tennis,3cuggd,ADM31,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Consistency doesn't win at 5.0 unless the shots are actually good great shots. Even at 4.5, players are able to dictate/put away points.  There was one guy on our tennis team in high school who was basically ""the wall."" He never missed and always played long rallies, hitting it deep, but they weren't great shots. He'd win every match against lesser opponents and lose every match if he came up against a 4.5+ player. Most of the time, actually. He probably beat the occasional 4.5 player that just lost their cool against him.  I hated playing this guy but I beat him during challenge matches because I would dictate the point and eventually put it away. But man I hated playing him."
tennis,3cuggd,fawkesmulder,2,Fri Jul 10 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"By and large, yes.  Tennis is a game of errors, and the fewer you make, the better.  Having said that, you always want to improve, so you can learn to hit harder if you learn to hit with topspin.  You can aim higher over the net, have it land safely in the court, and still take a good swing.  Over time, you want to have consistency, while being able to hit hard, but that takes time to develop.  You can end up muscling the ball, which ironically makes the shot a bit weaker (you should hit with a relaxed, fast swing).  Take time to learn how to hit groundstrokes.  There are many good videos out there.  For example, this guy's channel at YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/user/TennisMindGame, is pretty good, IMO."

tennis,3cq1tz,holliniv,48,Fri Jul 10 04:46:09 2015 UTC,"I have a story about one of the most memorable matches I've ever played. Right after graduating college (where I hadn't played a lick of tennis) I visited my aunt in Atlanta and mentioned that I was looking to start playing again. She said, ""Oh! I know just where to find someone for you to play with.""  The next morning, she took me to her country club and introduced me to my opponent, who turned out to the be -- no joke -- the top-ranked 12-year-old in the state of Georgia. I was 22 at the time.   At first I was worried about beating up on a little kid, but that went out the window quick. It was humiliating. I had been good in high school, but was woefully out of practice. He didn't hit super hard, but he was so smooth and would just push me from side to side until I dropped one short enough that he could poke it for a winner. He won the first set 6-2 and ran the second set out to 4-0. A crowd was forming and cheering wildly for him, and I was so incredibly embarrassed. So to start the fifth game, I hit a drop shot. And then a lob. And then a drop shot. And a lob. Did I mention that he was about 4'11?   I won the second set 6-4, and the kid was struggling. It was Atlanta in June, so it was about 95 degrees. I was feeling guilty, but not as bad as when I was losing to a 12-year-old, so I kept it up. When I went up a double-break at 3-0, he ran off the court, threw up in a trash can, and quit.   When I got back to my aunt's house later, and she asked how it went, I just told her I won a close one.   TL;DR: I made a 12-year-old throw up, and I'm oddly proud about it."

A 22-year-old is supposed to beat a 12-year-old, so it was a lot less interesting when I started getting the better of him. When he threw up, several of them (and me) ran over to help him out, and everyone dispersed quickly once he quit."

I am a 3.5 singles (girl) player that can run almost everything down and am a grinder. I don't hit terribly hard but I can assess a player pretty well and figure out their strength and make sure I don't give them balls that play to it.  If I can take my opponent's strength away, I can usually put myself in a position to beat them. And I don't lose much. It doesn't have to be pretty to be good tennis.

tennis,3cq1tz,epracer71,2,Fri Jul 10 09:54:08 2015 UTC,"It's a playstyle that consists primarily of deep lobs.  Players with less experience against the playstyle tend to hit the ball late in its bounce which means they are hitting with their backs almost touching the fence.  Because of the amount of distance they need to cover from a position of very little mobility, they either hit a very weak shot back in play or they miss their shot altogether.  It's a tactic primarily employed in junior tennis because lobs are most effective against shorter opponents who cannot reach the ball at the peak of the bounce."

I started terribly and was down a double break, but I just kept fighting and got back on serve. I was match-point down at 4-5 30-40. On that point we had a long rally, before he approached deep to by backhand (two-hander), and I ripped a backhand pass down the line from way back. Felt like Nadal. I ended up losing 7-6(5) but it was a good loss.  Edit: I realized now you were looking for ugly stories but I figured I might as well share this because there aren't many threads like this."

The first time I played the style I described in my OP was against the guy I mentioned who'd beaten me with it before. I ended up winning the second match (finals of the playoffs) in straight sets after spending the middle of the season, in my free time, learning to play his game and then using my youth to basically play it better than he was by virtue of him just being older.  We could probably learn stuff from each other. If nothing else, we could all learn more about playing tennis is a more mindful, positive, educational way."

I came in with a cold and as a result, running around was not at all what I planned on doing for the match.  Which, of course, my opponent (a 50yr old guy) immediately figured out.  I have never played a match where I did not get a single topspin shot to hit.  Guy had excellent placement, found the corner with every slice or lob, and I ended up loosing 5-7, 7-5, 6-3.  guy apologized afterwards for giving me all junk balls since i was sick. I told him he did exactly what he needed to do to win, and gave him credit.  Winning ugly is smart when it means winning!"
tennis,3cq1tz,GayForRay,3,Fri Jul 10 05:32:31 2015 UTC,"I just got done with a match tonight, I felt like I played out of my mind. I'm usually very fast, and can run down almost any ball, but this time instead of a lot of unforced errors chasing after balls, every one seems like a good reply with pace. If he came to the net I would thread the needle with a passing shot, or have the perfect top-spin lob. So many times he came to the net on the offensive, only for me to hit a perfect lob and move up and put away a weak reply. Every time he hit a good shot I would somehow stretch out and make him hit one more ball.  I can count on one hand the number of unforced errors I had, and at my level (3.5) that's absolutely huge."
tennis,3cq1tz,ManateeSheriff,2,Fri Jul 10 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"Ah man, that reminds me a bit of my best match.  I started playing tennis late (age 20ish), no coaching, though I read books and watched matches and practiced, so I could hit all the types of shots, but was always pretty light on for power, and horribly inconsistent.  One night at the club I was up against a guy who was way better than me, but the stars aligned. I remained focused and calm, but aggressive. Before I knew it I had match point against him on my serve to the ad court. I thought to myself ""I am going to close this thing out with an ace out wide"", and, despite my serve being the weakest part of my pretty weak game, I smacked it down and did just that. Couldn't believe it. I've never had another match like that..."
tennis,3cq1tz,titmousecunt,2,Fri Jul 10 10:49:29 2015 UTC,"I, generally, have a pretty big serve, but against good returners who get it back a lot I'll totally throw in some super short ones if they're standing far back.   I also drop shot off of serves - but I also sort of like doing that."

The other team knew my buddy couldn't move around a serve very well and had trouble returning so they body served him a few times and well...he took one in the sack. We lost the next four games when I knew we were in trouble..so the rest of the match I sliced and smashed almost every point and usually aimed it at them..needless to say we won 8 straight games to win 6-4 6-0 :)

Since I got promoted to 4.5, everybody hits harder than me and has cleaner strokes. The only way I'm ever going to win a match is to scamper around the court and fight everything back deep.

In the second round I managed to get matched up against a guy who was miles better than everyone else, probably a ranked junior.   He was a purist, and as someone who wishes he was a purist, I know what I would hate the most: underspin all day, every day. I was hitting slice forehands, slice backhands, drop shots, and slide serves every single time. The frustration was evident.  I lost, but managed to only lose something like 4-8 or 5-8 (8 game pro sets). It was definitely not a terrible way to go out."
tennis,3cq1tz,Felixisism,2,Fri Jul 10 04:50:17 2015 UTC,"I knew my opponent was a hot headed wanker who just like to hit hard and flat. The conditions were super wet.  Tournament was delayed so bad that matches were shortened to 8 game sets.  syn grass that was soaked, slidding created a water spray similar to driving through a puddle.  I'm a counter puncher, I win by manuevering the ball and taking it out of the hitting zone.  But given the court surface and waterlogged balls there was no way I could get it above his hitting zone nor did I have the ability to beat him in a hard hitting flat match.  Soluton.  Slice everything.  I normally go 50/50 between slice, drive on my bh side depending on what i'm trying to acheieve but today I didn't hit 1 drive.  I rarely used to slice my forehand but on this occasion I drop over 3 forehands total.  With the balls so heavy and everything bouncing knee height he just couldn't put anything away. We're both holding serve 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4.  Then... he cracked.  He started dumping balls in the bottom of the net trying to hit harder and harder.  Challenging calls that were out by over a metre, yelling obscenities about how i'm a fucking cheating hack.  At that point I knew i'd won, he'd completely lost it.  Won the match 8-5  Was tough to transition to my next round against a good retriever and do a complete 180 on my tactics.  Tl;Dr waterlogged balls and a big hitting opponent.  Solution slice....everything."

I knew it was probably bothering him, so to beat him, I put everything as wide to his forehand as possible to put the maximum strain on his shoulder. I ended up winning."

tennis,3ctedv,Lumos309,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:32:29 2015 UTC,"It's hard to know exactly what you're looking for, but for reference I previously strung a full bed of Luxilon ALU Power Rough at 52 (or was it 55?) lbs, and it was the only setup to ever make my arm hurt. Currently I have my 4G at 52 lbs, which isn't too stiff and doesn't give my arm problems. You may want to go a little higher than that if you like the stiffness, though be careful of stringing polys at too high a tension as that will give you a dead-feeling, very low powered setup."
tennis,3ctedv,vlee89,2,Sat Jul 11 13:23:36 2015 UTC,"Most poly have poor tension maintenance. I get the feeling I have to restring every week. I would also advocate going below 50 lbs tension and experiment low tension poly, I think you will be surprised and should like it."
tennis,3ctedv,claybobay,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:22:25 2015 UTC,"4G, as mentioned, is excellent for tension maintenance. As far as tension, you need to string low with poly. Don't go quite this low, but I use full poly at 43 lb., and it's amazing. I actually tried 4G at 48 lb., and I still felt I could go lower. Since you are currently at 57 lb., try going to 50 lb. to get the full benefits (extra ball grab, spin) of using full poly."

tennis,3cq3c8,areascontrol,14,Fri Jul 10 01:46:20 2015 UTC,I don't like her at all but I will admit she has sex appeal and many many people find her attractive. Just being white and blonde alone doesn't mean people will think you are attractive.
tennis,3cq3c8,plump1234,-11,Fri Jul 10 01:49:20 2015 UTC,"serena got a fatty fatty, she sexy af. Honestly (imo) way more attractive than sharapova. But all that aside, race has huge thing to do with ""reaching beyond tennis"". I'm not trying to be trite or dismissive, but it's hilarious if you don't think so.   (for those who think i'm actually calling her fat, http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fatty)"
tennis,3cq3c8,suker009,6,Fri Jul 10 05:53:47 2015 UTC,"http://www.forbes.com/athletes/list/#tab:overall  The world's highest paid athlete is black. There are also 5 black people in the top 10. And as you can see, with the exception of Mayweather, these guys make most of their earnings from endorsements. You're point is absolutely invalid. Maria makes more money because she's pretty, not because she's white."
tennis,3cq3c8,silentdave23,6,Fri Jul 10 11:45:44 2015 UTC,"Alright i was specifically talking about this case between shrapova and williams but anyway lets at least get some sort of discussion going.   In regards to that list; Floyd makes a vast majority of his $ through salary/purse because he's his own promoter. He can probably make more through endorsements but he chooses not to. It can pretty speculative if we say he'd make more as a white boxer in the same position, but i think so.  Lebron and Kobe are arguably the greatest basketball players of all time (if not top 3/5) thank ducking god theyre on that list. Whens the last time the league had a good white person competing for mvp in consecutive years. I dont know when,  but without a doubt theyve would earning more through endorsements if they were even near as good as good KB LBJ or even Durant.   Tiger is technically half white. But he is your strongest case because he did have a draw to the sport and because of his early success essentially created his own brand.   There's is no doubt in my mind that race plays a huge factor in endorsement warnings between sharapova and williams. You gotta understand racism is still a thing outside the western world (its still a thing in the western world but trying to argue this to someone that isn't a minority who isn't a minority or ever experienced it is incredibly difficult. Also serena gets often gets typecast as 'in your face' or intimidating, even though maria throws more shade than any athlete ive ever seen across all sports. (Heres a compilation of the complete female tennis world. If u have the time i suggest checking out all the parts. https://youtu.be/1LQDDa63VWs)  And why the heck am i getting downvoted. I thought the voting system has to do with what adds to the conversation or what brings about discussion. Race, albeit sensitive, is a great discussion to have. (I meant my other post, not this one. This is what fatty means http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fatty it was a compliment!!!)"
tennis,3cq3c8,suker009,3,Fri Jul 10 13:25:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, I want to say that it wasn't me who downvoted you. Altough I don't agree with you 100%, but I like meaningful discussion, and I wouldn't downvote you just because you have a different opinion.  I see the point you're trying to make, but I still think you overestimate the impact of race in the earnings of these athletes. I'm from Eastern Europe, so believe me I'm well aware of the fact that racism is still huge in some places in the world. But these endorsements are mainly coming from western companies, who make most of their profit in western countries, so I just don't see how it would make that much of a difference.  For example, look at Messi vs. LeBron. Soccer is far more popular worldwide than basketball, and Messi, like LeBron, is an all-time great. So one would assume, if race is such a big factor, that he should definitely make much more money than LeBron. The fact that LeBron gets twice as much, shows that the majority of this money is coming from the US. The US, which has a black president. I know that race is still an issue there as well, especially nowadays there are a lot of controversies, riots and stuff, but this doesn't reflect the opinion of the majority IMHO, especially not sports fans over there. I mean, it's really hard to imagine a racist basketball fan in 2015, when most of the great basketball players (so probably their favorites too) are black, and this has been the case since the 50's.  So if there was a white basketball player, who is as good as LeBron, I just don't see him earning more than him. Because where is that additional money coming from? What companies don't want to advertise with LeBron or give him endorsement deals, juse because he's black? I just don't think there's any. So there's no money left on the table either.  Just think of Jordan vs. Bird. Of course Jordan is the greatest, but Bird is top 10 too at the very least. And in the 80's when Boston was winning, and Jordan was younger, you could absolutely compare them. Still Jordan was the one who got the huge Nike deals and stuff. I don't have the exact numbers, but I'm pretty sure he had more in endorsement money than Bird. In the 80's. When race was definitely a bigger issue in the US.  So I'm sticking to my point. If Serena would be considered an attractive black woman by the general public, and Sharapova wouldn't be considered attractive, it would be the other way around, race aside."
tennis,3cq3c8,silentdave23,2,Fri Jul 10 14:22:28 2015 UTC,race has a huge thing to do with 'reaching beyond tennis'<   I don't think that's true. There are a lot of examples in sport where an athlete achieves brand power regardless of race. Tiger Woods is basically tied with Phil Mickelson as the highest earning golfer this year despite only achieving a fraction of Mickelson's actual winnings.  In fact five of the top ten World's highest earning athlete list are black athletes. And being in that list inherently requires 'reaching beyond your sport' - almost all have a higher endorsement figure than winnings.

I'm a much bigger fan of Serena than Maria, but lets get real, not only is Maria more attractive, she's got a demeanor that IMO makes her a much better celebrity endorser for a much wider range of companies than Serena."
tennis,3cq3c8,GATSBYH20,9,Thu Jul 9 23:02:46 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, what exactly about her demeanor is more interesting?"
tennis,3cq3c8,gibisee4,21,Thu Jul 9 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"I read my post again. Did I say it was interesting?  She's not a zany girl, but when Maria is speaking matter of factly, there always seems to be a hint of a sense of humor beneath it all. It might be a Russian thing, because I thought Safin and Davydenko had that vibe, too, even if they were being kind of cranky, it was kind of funny and light hearted. Serena can seem very cranky and closed off. In fact, on court, I've never seen such a dominant player who looked like they were on the verge of tears even when they're winning. Granted, I'm mostly basing this on post match interviews and on court demeanor. But subtle things like that IMO make a huge difference in terms of effectively swaying potential customers of a good or service. Also, I think part of the reason Serena can seem so aloof and closed off is because she's wary of the press more so than Maria, who never had to experience the backlashes and racism Serena did.   With that said, Maria's never yelled at a linesperson the way Serena has. So yeah, just overall, Maria is probably a more suitable pitch man for a wider range of companies."
tennis,3cq3c8,GATSBYH20,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:31:09 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this at all. Serena's been extremely relaxed and candid with the press recently (for example, admitting that she choked after the French Open final, the charm offensive of the FO 2013, etc.). It's also interesting that you say that Serena comes off as cranky and closed off, because a lot of that criticism has been levied towards Sharapova."

tennis,3cq3c8,GATSBYH20,-2,Fri Jul 10 01:07:34 2015 UTC,"To add to that, I'd say that Maria's humor adds a bit more depth to her personality than Serena has. As much as I love how much of a dominant champion Serena is , she can come off slightly vapid off-court.  Serena also got side-tracked earlier in her career by off-court activities, so she might be avoiding that at the moment and saving it for after her sports career."
tennis,3cq3c8,gbinasia,7,Thu Jul 9 23:44:58 2015 UTC,"Also, a lot of Serena's outfits are pretty out there for the country club crowd. The stuff Maria wears has way broader appeal, so there's that, too."
tennis,3cq3c8,GATSBYH20,8,Fri Jul 10 01:09:41 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, the country club crowd would prefer Maria over Serena on the skin color alone. What I don't understand is why Serena doesn't have a shit ton of home endorsements; maybe because AA aren't massively interested in tennis? She should be up there with Shaq, Jordan, etc."
tennis,3cq3c8,gbinasia,5,Fri Jul 10 01:13:14 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, the country club crowd would prefer Maria over Serena on the skin color alone.     That's true, too. But, for example, I think Venus goes for a more elegant look and her dresses could do as well as Maria's. Serena's clothes are very Vegas looking at times.  Sampras wasn't killing it either. At the time, he was the best male player ever. Personality matters, too, and Serena has a love hate relationship with people. Even among tennis fans, I've NEVER seen more hostility towards a player than I've seen with Serena. I think people are softening up on her a bit, but for a while, she might have been the most hated female player in tennis."
tennis,3cq3c8,GATSBYH20,8,Fri Jul 10 01:20:48 2015 UTC,"I can't say I know much about how Sampras was perceived back then, so I can't really argue with you on that.  Venus certainly feels like the classiest of both sisters and maybe that accentuates Serena's personality issues. It's still disturbing to see how many hate Serena because she has plenty of muscles and how she roars on the court. Men's tennis has had plenty of divas with questionable outbursts yet none were hated like her. I feel like the hatred she's receiving is because of her appearance and that includes race. It's simply that some haters thought they were very smart by switching from calling her an ape to a man, but I think most decent people see through their bullshit."
tennis,3cq3c8,gbinasia,7,Fri Jul 10 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"For sure race and gender has a  LOT to do with it.

Serena's story would certainly sell, but it's also pretty familiar at this point: minority born into poverty, faces racism, eventually, after facing trials and tribulations, conquers the world through athleticism. Don't get me wrong, it IS an interesting story. But it's also not exactly unique.   Maria's life story follows a similar compelling-but-not-unique path. From poverty in Russia to tennis star, with her family making sacrifices along the way:   With money tight, Yuri Sharapov borrowed the sum that would enable him and his daughter, neither of whom could speak English, to travel to the United States of America, which they finally did in 1994.[11] Visa restrictions prevented Sharapova's mother from joining them for two years.[9] Arriving in Florida with savings of US$700,[11] Sharapova's father took various low-paying jobs, including dishwashing, to fund her lessons until she was old enough to be admitted to the academy."

tennis,3cq3c8,alpacafarts,7,Sat Jul 11 07:24:20 2015 UTC,"Perhaps Maria gets more endorsement offers because her business savvy (management/marketing) is far superior than any of Serena's failed ventures (Anares anybody?). Serena has courted controversy in interviews (RS int where she dissed Maria) and more importantly on court (suspended 2010 for threatening a line judge, 09USOpen). Her attitude in press conferences is not that great either (stand-offish, petulant or fake). Basically, all around Maria is far more marketable as a personality and that's without factoring her looks."

tennis,3cp5v9,idiedofcuriosity,21,Fri Jul 10 05:49:13 2015 UTC,"Federer-Murray this year feels like the hardest call of the tournament so far, one that could genuinely go to either extreme (3-0 or 0-3), to a drawn-out 5-setter, or anywhere in between depending on how things play out.   I don't think that Federer's near perfect serving record in the tournament so far will necessarily have relevance since Murray's returning ability is a couple of levels above anyone Roger has faced thus far, and Murray has proven his ability to unpick Roger's service game when he's on form and when it counts.  I feel that a lot of it will come down to mental stability and consistency of play, areas in which Federer has the edge, being less prone to blow-ups and mid-match wobbles. If Murray has his A-game frame of mind fully focused though, his ability to pull Federer around the court and to disrupt his usual smooth flow could well win out.  Either way, it's a fascinating prospect. Really looking forward to this one and so glad that both players are in fine form and injury free."
tennis,3cp5v9,cuntarsetits,2,Thu Jul 9 22:59:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that Federer has yet to face a returner as good as Murray this Wimbledon, but Federer's serve on grass is a whole different animal. Additionally, if he follows the serve in I doubt murray will necessarily be looking for the pass off the return.  They are an interesting match up on grass, because Federer is a better server than returner, whereas Murray is a better returner. I do think consistency will be a big factor, but I think serving will play a big role. With Federer at Wimbledon, if the first serve percentage stays high, he should win the match. I just don't think Murray will be able to neutralize the first serve enough to make Federer play a neutral first shot.  It will be a good match, hopefully I can find highlights without any spoilers after work."
tennis,3cp5v9,startinup,2,Fri Jul 10 01:40:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed that Federer's serve comes into its own on grass, but still, Murray has dismantled it (or negated it) on centre court before. Most notably in the 2012 Olympic final to win in straight sets of course, but also in the first half of the Wimbledon final that same year before his game started to fracture under pressure. It promises to be a riveting match. I hope it lives up to it, and I hope you manage to find spoiler-free highlights, or preferably the complete match.

tennis,3cp5v9,creepymanchildren,4,Fri Jul 10 11:01:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a Fed fan, but I have concerns... When Fed kept rallies short against Simon, he was dominant. Especially having had a great serving day, much like he's had all tournament. But when the rallies went longer, Simon was kind of bossing Fed around the court with his steady, get-one-more-back strokes. Fed played the important points better. There wasn't an enormous unforced error difference between them, if I remember the stats right. Fed also missed a routine overhead and had some bad shanks against Simon.   That's how Murray plays, and if Murray is able to do that and consistently rifle off down-the-line shots, he can make this very, very difficult for Roger. He's been hitting good passing shots all tournament too, in my opinion.  Murray was also quite gassed at the WTF, having played so many back-to-back touraments leading up to the event. Fed played great that night, yes, but Murray was in poor form. When Andy beat Roger in '13 at the Aus Open, Roger had just come off a tough 5-setter against Tsonga and looked pretty gassed by the 5th set against Murray, which he lost 6-2.   But hey, Fed's looked sharp so far, and hasn't really expended too much energy or time on court. He should have plenty left in the tank. He was pressed a lot harder with longer matches in 2012 when he won, so it's hard to bet against the man on his favorite court. Fed in 4."

tennis,3cp5v9,Personacorona,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:32:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, whenever Murray plays a neutral ball, Fed's going to do something with it, be it slicing it low and bumrushing net or using it to control the point.

tennis,3cp5v9,Valinor_,2,Thu Jul 9 22:35:44 2015 UTC,Murray's slice is easily good enough to tango with Fed's. Murray is also in the top 2 or 3 in the world at passing people at the net and is probably number 1 at lobbing people at the net. Roger's net game may not be as secure as you'd think.

Murray has been playing at the same level as Djokovic this year. Maybe one step behind. Even though I despise the guy, I think he'll sneak out a win and run Novak close in the final. I'm sure that Murray can play the attrition game and gas Federer out in the 5th. He just has too much youth and stamina on his side. This isn't 2012."
tennis,3cp5v9,bustedracquet,2,Thu Jul 9 21:23:46 2015 UTC,"Murray has not been playing at the same level as Novak this year. If he was, Novak wouldn't account for 4 of Andy's 6 losses this year. And it's not just that Novak's beaten him 4 out of 4 times, but it's the way they happened, he blew him out in Indian Wells, and then the other 3 times when the matches were competitive, Novak just blew him out in the final set. He served a bagel in the final set at the AO final, another bagel in the deciding set at Miami, and he tossed in a breadstick at Roland Garros.   Murray's clearly been the 2nd best player this year, but he has a mental block against Novak that prevents him from joining him at the present time at the top of men's tennis."
tennis,3cp5v9,ThatLiam,3,Fri Jul 10 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"All true. However, Andy and Novak were in pretty much the exact same situation in 2013, and Andy won the final. He usually peaks at this time of the year."

tennis,3cp5v9,bustedracquet,2,Thu Jul 9 23:24:10 2015 UTC,"If his serve is anywhere near as good as it's been the whole tournament so far, I'm going to say Federer in straight sets. His average match duration is hovering near 1:30, which is insane!"
tennis,3cp5v9,ifhe,2,Fri Jul 10 01:04:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to really bother discussing Novak-Gasquet since I think most people know that Novak's going to win and it'll be fairly routine. Gasquet's tank will be be close to empty after that match against Stan, and also Gasquet just doesn't present any kind of trouble for Novak whatsoever, he has no weapons to hurt him with.   With regards to Roger vs. Andy, obviously the two play completely different styles, and it usually comes down to who can impose their game on the other. Andy would just love to have 30 ball rallies with Roger all day long and bank on his consistency off the ground to outlast Roger and retrieve everything he throws at him. Roger obviously would love to shorten the points, and get up to net as often as he can. There's an inherent risk with that, because Murray is one of the all-time greats in attacking a player at the net via either a passing shot or the offensive lob. His crosscourt forehand pass is the very best in the game IMO (and predictable, it's ridiculous how players still don't get that and cover it), and he is capable of passing with his backhand crosscourt or down the line.   Keys for Roger:   1st Serve % - He has to win as many free points as possible, simple as that Pace - Similar to how Dustin Brown never let Rafa get in a rhythm, by just playing incredibly fast, Roger should employ the same tactic against Andy. It's hard to develop any kind of rhythm if you're never hitting the ball. Attack the Murray forehand - I remember in the first few matches that Roger played against Andy, he would try and break down his forehand, not his backhand. It was a successful strategy. As Roger has gotten older though, he now likes to be in a fixed position, just left of the service line where he can hit run around/hit forehands in the ad court, or hit backhands and dictate play from there. And these shots are mainly directed crosscourt, but that plays into Murray's biggest strength which is his backhand. Roger will venture to the net many times in tomorrow's match, and it's important that when he approaches, he covers the crosscourt pass when he goes to Andy's forehand, and he should be wary of coming in on Andy's backhand, even if it's a chip.  2nd Serve Return - I will cringe if Roger doesn't come over on the return of every single puny cupcake 2nd serve that Andy throws up. Either forehand or backhand, Roger needs to step up and be aggressive, and find his way into net to get quick and easy points and exploit Andy's greatest weakness.    Keys for Andy:   1st Serve % - If I was Andy, I would never try to bother trying to go for the big serve and win free points. I would roll my first serve in there around 115-120 every time, and start the point, and actually dare Roger to attack a first serve instead of just bunting it back which is what Roger always does, especially on grass. Andy's 2nd serve is so atrocious, that his % will be very key tomorrow, and I think he can enhance it by taking something off. Roger isn't going to hurt him by being aggressive with the return.  Inside In Forehands/Down the Line Backhand - Many of Roger-Andy rallies feature Roger dictating play from just the right of the service line either with his forehand/hitting backhands, and Murray being crosscourt and retrieving. As you know, Andy's been exploring how to add more options to his game, and one of those things he's added is being more unpredictable. Most of Andy's shots the last few years have been crosscourt. However he's mixed in more down the line backhands this year, and occasionally a few run around inside in forehands. Those have a really good chance of working against Roger who is usually camped on the other side, and struggles to cover ground wide to the forehand.  2nd Serve Returns - Andy has been much more aggressive this season at attacking 2nd serves. For most of Wimbledon, he has been a few feet inside the baseline on the return, and being offensive with it, and using it as a gateway to some quick points off the return, something Novak has been doing for awhile now.    Federer-Murray matches are usually tough to predict, but I'm going to go ahead and say Murray in 5. I think the longer the match goes, it favors Andy, and I think Andy will be able to get into more of Roger's service games than Roger will against Andy. Andy quietly has been untroubled in most of his service games in the tournament albeit against not very good returners."
tennis,3cp5v9,DilbertsBeforeSwine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:02:10 2015 UTC,"Basically, I agree.  In a way, it's similar to Federer-Djokovic.  Federer tries to intimidate with pace, and Djokovic either weathers the storm and forces Roger to play longer points, or sometimes he cracks under Federer's pressure.  For a Murray-Federer analog, I'd point to the 2012 Wimbledon final where Federer was able to apply pressure, though in 2012, I'd say Federer had a lot of rhythm in his groundstrokes, so he was able to play lengthy rallies.  That was also a factor in beating Djokovic in the semis.  If Fed can play long rallies (not sure he wants to do this in 2015) and win them, he'll make Murray a bit antsy.  I don't think he'll try that, and will opt for more aggression.  Obviously, it depends on how successful he is being aggressive.  Good observations!"
tennis,3cp5v9,Jzrt10,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:00:38 2015 UTC,"Well I think the biggest factor that nobody talks about in that 2012 match is the roof being closed. After the roof closed, Roger got into a ridiculous serving rhythm and Andy couldn't really do much to get into his service games, Roger was hitting his spots perfectly with no outdoor conditions whatsoever. That freed him up more to attack on Murray's service games, and eventually Roger had that break in the third set after that like 15-18 minute service game that really drained Andy mentally."
tennis,3cp5v9,missscottfraser,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:06:11 2015 UTC,"It's true Roger's better indoors (which is interesting because he's always claimed tennis is an outdoors sport), but I do feel he got in a great groove playing Djokovic where he felt he could get into 20-shot rallies and come out on top.  By the time he played Murray, he was still feeling this rhythm.  But yeah, that really long game was key for Federer.  I was traveling that day, so I heard it mostly on Wimbledon radio, and recalled hearing that long game.  The serve will be key for Federer as the return will be key for Murray."
tennis,3cp5v9,missscottfraser,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:46:59 2015 UTC,I'm interested to see how many return winners Andy gets against Roger off the 2nd serve today. His court position has been more aggressive on the 2nd serve return in this tournament.

If I were to bet, I'd say Federer in straight sets, which is an uncommon feeling to have in these past few years.  6-2 6-3 6-4.  Of course, I could be gloriously wrong, and I wouldn't be all that surprised.    Djokovic in straight sets 6-1 6-3 6-3.  I'll add the only way I think this match can be anything but a blowout is if Gasquet manages to hit every slice backhand so it stays around Djokovic's ankles."

tennis,3cuii9,SwissBliss,-1,Fri Jul 10 22:55:33 2015 UTC,Counts for the same. 1 Gold Medal for your country. That's the way I see it.
tennis,3cuii9,TheMagicianDolph,2,Fri Jul 10 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's as powerful for your resume as a singles Gold, but he is an Olympic champion and nobody can take that from him."

tennis,3cuii9,SwissBliss,0,Fri Jul 10 23:00:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's completely different than Grand Slams. Ya only having a doubles Wimbledon for example, isn't as impressive as a singles one, but in the Olympics, it isn't about the individual, it's about the country you represent, and he did the job (with Stan) by getting Switzerland the Gold. All Golds are created equal in the olympics."
tennis,3cuii9,jleonardbc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:01:40 2015 UTC,"doesn't a doubles win count as ""1"" gold medal for the country? So it's like a half a gold in terms of helping the country?  Or am I wrong on this and doubles gets twice as much medal count as singles?"
tennis,3cuii9,SwissBliss,0,Fri Jul 10 23:04:31 2015 UTC,"All events are 1, even football/soccer and other team sports."
tennis,3cuii9,PokeMyPillow,2,Fri Jul 10 23:23:25 2015 UTC,"Do you count doubles Slams toward individual totals? That would make the Bryans the tennis GOATs.  I'm a Fed fan, but doubles is almost a different sport (much more emphasis on net skills, much less emphasis on court coverage); and, given that singles players can sometimes sign up for doubles tournaments, team up with other singles players they've barely played with before, and win the doubles or at least go deep, it seems that the doubles talent pool is shallower or less competitive."
tennis,3cuii9,SwissBliss,-1,Sat Jul 11 00:19:17 2015 UTC,"My point is simply that Olympics aren't about individuals, it's about your country and people. Federer gave Switzerland a gold medal, all gold medals are the same, he did his job. Tennis trophies are different because it's about the individual athlete.  As a Swiss I just see it as: Roger Federer won the Olympics/got a gold medal. Doesn't matter how, he got gold for us."
tennis,3cuii9,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:49:24 2015 UTC,"Thing is, we are assessing careers and GOATness here. Not prestige or honor for country. Yeah both are gold medals and might be equally prestigious but we are assessing the GOAT for singles now. So you can't count Federer's doubles olympic gold or the fact that Nadal has more doubles masters titles than Federer then. In fact, if you made a poll for whether or not Federer's olympic doubles title should be counted as equal to Nadal's olympic singles title, I 100% bet at the vast majority would not count them as equal.  Sometimes you just have to accept the truth. I for one have accepted that Federer is the GOAT despite being a Nadal fan."
tennis,3cuii9,PokeMyPillow,-2,Sat Jul 11 01:01:49 2015 UTC,"That's the point. It's a misconception. If Federer had only won the French open in doubles, that'd be a big hole in his career. That's because these are tennis competitions. The Olympics is an international sports competition, where the goal is to bring back as many medals as possible for your country. Federer got a gold, Nadal got a gold that year, they both left with the same for their country, and both got the job done.  That's my opinion, it's not wrong, but you can disagree.   Id much rather Federer have all the Masters than a Singles Gold, he has the Olympic gold, he doesn't have all the masters.  To be fair though, there are 0 masters on Grass, and tons on clay."
tennis,3cuii9,SwissBliss,0,Sat Jul 11 01:09:30 2015 UTC,"Okay fine, that is your opinion and sure it isn't wrong then(so all opinions in tennis aren't wrong. Well I think Sampras and Nadal are both greater than Federer). Don't claim the strongly held belief that olympic singles gold does not equal olympic doubles as a misconception then too. Since then literally the whole tennis community except certain Federer fans would believe this misconception then.  I'm just going another comment and say that the Bryans and all the other amazing doubles teams better try their damn hardest for all the olympics then since apparently a doubles gold can highly boost a singles repertoire now. (And apparently Indian Wells is a clay event now since Rafa won that twice in doubles)."
tennis,3cuii9,PokeMyPillow,0,Sat Jul 11 01:17:06 2015 UTC,This is literally the argument for most Fed fans.....How is olympic gold singles=olympic gold doubles? So mike and bob bryan must be amazing singles players too since they won olympic gold. Hey thats even better than Djokovic! Wonder why the Bryans didn't play more singles then.

tennis,3cpoa2,rollupthepartition,20,Fri Jul 10 02:09:06 2015 UTC,I find it disturbing that there's isn't some kind of response from the ATP or other players when this kind of thing happens.

Mr. Dolgopolov’s views are his and his alone. The ATP does not condone such views in any way.” source  Problem with Stakho is that he is on the ATP player council himself, which makes it double awkward for the ATP."

Think of their attitudes towards it as being like the US in the 70s/80s where it's still really taboo and they still think they can 'cure' it with conversion therapy.  Give the country time.

You can be tolerant of bigots while still exercising your right to tell them that they're being stupid.

I've just looked it up and basically what would happen if they switched sides while receiving is they would continue to play in the incorrect configuration, then they would switch back at the end of the game. All points won in the incorrect configuration continue to count.  If one started serving in place of the other it would be corrected immediately."

But this year's W ladies' draw looked off at first sight.  In the first draw you had, Sharapova, Azarenka, both Wiilliams', and the British #1 Watson. There is no surprise what the first draw quarterfinals would look like.  Every top ten player in the second draw got ousted before quarterfinals and only Wozniacki (5) made to the 4th round.   Now perhaps that is just the current landscape of the WTA competition, but it just seemed off compared to the other 2 slams this year.  Honestly, the best thing about the whole ladies' tourney this year is to see Heather Watson breakout. She has only played 5 championships. She didn't qualify for the AO, made through to the 2rd round @ RG and to the 3rd round at W, where she gave the world's #1 a run for it. I look forward to seeing how she does in NY."

tennis,3coeye,GinGimlet,15,Thu Jul 9 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"I think Muguruza, Keys, Kvitova and Azarenka could run things once she retires. I love Kvitova's game but she can't be consistent enough to win the big ones with any regularity."
tennis,3coeye,MoreDblRainbows,6,Thu Jul 9 14:27:35 2015 UTC,Azarenka has everything it takes to be great right now. The others have holes.
tennis,3coeye,gbinasia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:10:16 2015 UTC,She should be back at winning slams once she gets a better seed. And that's probably gonna be soon; I'd bet the Australian Open.
tennis,3coeye,Atlaffinity75,5,Thu Jul 9 15:48:39 2015 UTC,I agree. A few players with huge weapons.
tennis,3coeye,bonoboboy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:52:41 2015 UTC,What about Sharapova?
tennis,3coeye,gbinasia,12,Thu Jul 9 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"She's kind of on her way out. She has 2-3 years of peak tennis left, probably 2-3 slams."
tennis,3coeye,complex123,8,Thu Jul 9 23:53:15 2015 UTC,"We have seen glimpses of a Serenaless WTA tour though. When fully fit (or motivated) Serena has pretty much dominated the competition, but she has had injuries, illnesses and periods of terrible form (her grand slams titles have been pretty evenly spread across 16 years). 2011 was probably one of her worst recent years and in the end of years rankings there was only 1000 points between the top 4 players, and a more even spread of points across the entire top 100 compared to the situation at the moment. So like people have said, much more competitive."
tennis,3coeye,alpacafarts,6,Thu Jul 9 16:12:13 2015 UTC,More competitive does not necessarily mean as good as quality as when Serena is around though!
tennis,3coeye,Sir_Psycho_Sexy_,-2,Thu Jul 9 16:08:17 2015 UTC,Women's tennis will be a sad game when Serena retires   it will be more competitive and better to watch imo
tennis,3coeye,ParanoidAndroids,26,Thu Jul 9 16:13:17 2015 UTC,It'll only be more competitive because the skill ceiling will be lowered.
tennis,3coeye,gbinasia,11,Thu Jul 9 16:12:06 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it would be more competitive if you take the most competitive player out. She's raising the bar for other players, who have a tendency to play 'their best tennis' when against her."
tennis,3coeye,Personacorona,3,Thu Jul 9 16:42:59 2015 UTC,You forgot Federer in there. He revolutionized the game.
tennis,3coeye,Beforehand87,22,Thu Jul 9 15:53:00 2015 UTC,I would love a tell-all book consisting only of the things Sharapova and Serena say about each other when they're only around their inner circles. Serena hates this girl so obviously.
tennis,3coeye,MoreDblRainbows,28,Thu Jul 9 16:11:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know if she hates her personally, I think she hates the idea of Sharapova. When she beat her in '04 people were literally gushing over ""The Fall of Serena"" . I think Maria has become the human embodiment of all the ""Williams Hate"" for Serena and she just wants to crush it every time."
tennis,3coeye,Beforehand87,27,Thu Jul 9 16:14:52 2015 UTC,"Chris Evert said it, and I agree. Sharapova is driven WILD by Serena's professional success, and Serena is driven crazy by Sharapova's promotional success. For Serena to be as good as she is and so much better than Maria, but still be outearned by her in a promotional sense burns her ass.  EDIT: This has definitely morphed into ""hate each other personally"", though."

tennis,3coeye,alpacafarts,3,Thu Jul 9 16:12:52 2015 UTC,"Wondering if Serena can bridge that gap in endorsement money earned, but I'm not totally sure.  As of this article in 2013, Serena was reportedly making a cool $12mil a year in endorsement deals (http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2013/10/27/serena-williams-finishes-historic-12-4-million-tennis-season-with-another-title/). Note, that alone netted her $24mil ($12.4mil prize money) for her 78-4 2013 season.  That article does state that her Nike contract does include significant bonuses for Grand Slam victories. I wonder if Sharapova's is written the same or not.   And just in 2015, I have at least seen Serena in Chase and Gatorade commercials as well."
tennis,3coeye,areascontrol,5,Thu Jul 9 16:18:39 2015 UTC,Serena just signed with Aston Martin as well.
tennis,3coeye,Shad0wF0x,2,Thu Jul 9 16:23:04 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I could see a pro tennis player driving an Aston. I don't buy for a second that LeBron drives a Kia and Shaq drives a Buick.
tennis,3coeye,areascontrol,2,Thu Jul 9 16:25:19 2015 UTC,Supposedly Rafa really does drive a Kia.
tennis,3coeye,zaviex,10,Thu Jul 9 17:19:33 2015 UTC,its definitely personal at this point. They started taking shots at each other off the record like that
tennis,3coeye,MoreDblRainbows,5,Thu Jul 9 22:20:33 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I think its grown from there because Serena is so intense against her and both have bruised egos. I think they see each other as foils
tennis,3coeye,melodicsyrup,3,Fri Jul 10 00:16:47 2015 UTC,I don't know if she hates her personally   she definitely does. just look at all the shady stuff she said about her

tennis,3coeye,Skyluz,9,Thu Jul 9 15:12:48 2015 UTC,Serena faced exactly zero break point in the entire match
tennis,3coeye,Skyluz,8,Thu Jul 9 18:09:12 2015 UTC,The gap in quality between these two is ridiculous.
tennis,3coeye,alpacafarts,32,Thu Jul 9 15:24:30 2015 UTC,Still can't quite believe how close Heather Watson was to beating Serena.
tennis,3coeye,jkalderash,42,Thu Jul 9 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"There is something you need to understand.  Serena Williams in the first week of a major is not the same player as Serena Williams in the second week.  Serena is more nervous about losing early in a major. By the time the second week comes around, especially by the semis, her confidence is there and her serve is on point."
tennis,3coeye,gibisee4,12,Thu Jul 9 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"So, you're saying Maria should strategically tank her ranking so she meets Serena in the first week? Brilliant!"
tennis,3coeye,DownWthisSortOfThing,7,Thu Jul 9 16:18:56 2015 UTC,"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/serena-williams-is-some-kind-of-clutch/  An interesting article on Serena's dominance in semis and finals (it should be noted that since this article, she's gone 5/5 in semis and finals)"
tennis,3coeye,bnlf,17,Thu Jul 9 15:45:33 2015 UTC,Williams d. Sharapova 6-2 6-0
tennis,3coeye,swolengomads,8,Thu Jul 9 15:12:52 2015 UTC,so far so good
tennis,3coeye,HausofKungFuDojos,8,Thu Jul 9 16:34:04 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why Serena's been able to completely dominate Maria? Like is it just a different style where they match up in Serena's favour?
tennis,3coeye,GinGimlet,39,Thu Jul 9 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"1) Serena and Maria play similar games, but Serena is just better at it in every department.  2) Maria became a star when she beat her in the 2004 Wimbledon final. Serena has not let that go.  That being said I do think Serena respects Maria's game and knows that if she's a little off, Maria will go in for the kill. Which is why Serena always shows up in these matchups."
tennis,3coeye,swolengomads,22,Thu Jul 9 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"I think one under-appreciated aspect of this is that they tend to play in Semis and Finals and, by then, Serena is usually 100% dialed in by that stage. You don't get 90% winning record in semis/finals by chance. I think if they played a bit earlier in each tourney maaaaaybe Serena might be a little of her game?"
tennis,3coeye,chief_running_joke,4,Thu Jul 9 14:37:42 2015 UTC,yeah you weren't kidding. yeesh
tennis,3coeye,dariusd2003,8,Thu Jul 9 15:21:00 2015 UTC,This is all true. I think Serena keeps a chip on her shoulder because Maria makes more in endorsements as well.
tennis,3coeye,chief_running_joke,5,Thu Jul 9 14:21:12 2015 UTC,That's nothing Serena can really control. Maria is a white blonde so endorsements are very easy for her. She can easily be commercial. Look at others like Bouchard that sprung up without half as many accolades as Serena.
tennis,3coeye,stup0r,7,Thu Jul 9 14:24:51 2015 UTC,"She can control beating her ass every time they play, though."
tennis,3coeye,GinGimlet,16,Thu Jul 9 15:11:03 2015 UTC,"Serena can do everything Sharapova can, only better. As a Sharapova fan, this hurts D:"
tennis,3coeye,TCK-OCR,2,Thu Jul 9 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"Maria's double faults are incredibly costly in this matchup--She's averaging 8 per match this tourney I think, that's a double break's worth of points. Facing one of the best servers in tennis history, male or female, that becomes fatal."
tennis,3coeye,HausofKungFuDojos,2,Thu Jul 9 15:58:30 2015 UTC,Sharapova's serve is the crucial difference. Since her shoulder injury in the mid 00's her serve has been her big weakness and has only won her tournaments since in spite of this. If serves weren't a thing I imagine they'd split a lot of their matchups but given Serena's godserve the matchup is a formality.
tennis,3coeye,frozen-creek,7,Thu Jul 9 20:51:33 2015 UTC,This is looking more like London 2012 than Wimbledon 2010 :(

tennis,3coeye,areascontrol,3,Thu Jul 9 15:14:56 2015 UTC,Has Serena expressed any interest in playing mixed at the Aussie and French Open to get the Ultimate career slam?
tennis,3coeye,MoreDblRainbows,2,Thu Jul 9 15:42:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything.  I think she's really focused on surpassing Steffi while she's ""young"".  She's got all the time in the world to get those mixed titles.  She'll probably snag one when she's 58 :D"
tennis,3coeye,jkalderash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:49:21 2015 UTC,I was just thinking its something that could set her further apart from Steffi who has only two doubles titles (as opposed to being on one of the most dominant teams ever) and no mixed.
tennis,3coeye,chief_running_joke,19,Thu Jul 9 15:51:32 2015 UTC,Honestly would like to see Serena win this one. She deserves a Serena slam.
tennis,3coeye,Tarul,10,Thu Jul 9 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"I would like to see her win too, but I don't understand the idea of ""deserving"" something before it happens. If she wins then she deserved it, but not before."
tennis,3coeye,chief_running_joke,3,Thu Jul 9 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"Bad weather, injuries, and other unforeseen circumstances can stop ""deserving"" players from winning."
tennis,3coeye,HausofKungFuDojos,2,Thu Jul 9 16:22:24 2015 UTC,"That's true, except for bad weather effects both players equally. Also, injuries are part of the game and often tied to fitness and conditioning. But I take your point. Like, if a player went through a personal tragedy or got stabbed by a fan or something, then they might lose by no fault of their own, even though they probably would have won. Still, ""deserve"" is a weird way to describe it in Serena's circumstance.   I think I can understand the sentiment, though. For instance, as an Andy Roddick fan, I used to think that he ""deserved"" to win another major because I knew how hard he worked and how close he came and goddamit Roger was just too good. But, unfortunately, Roddick only deserved to win the one major that he won."
tennis,3coeye,bonoboboy,8,Fri Jul 10 00:14:04 2015 UTC,What can Maria do from here on out?  1) Become Serena's friend. It's worked out for Victoria and Caroline considering how close their matches have been.  2) Change the goal from beating Serena to just winning a set off her.  3) Pray that Serena retires soon.
tennis,3coeye,zaviex,24,Fri Jul 10 01:56:38 2015 UTC,2) Change the goal from beating Serena to taking her to break point at least   FTFY

tennis,3cppdh,TacticalTennis,6,Thu Jul 9 19:55:46 2015 UTC,Could be a close one. I think if Federer is really on song with his movement then the serve + forehand seem to just naturally click into place. If he's getting about the court nicely then I like his chances.
tennis,3cppdh,peRFectTennis,8,Thu Jul 9 21:59:49 2015 UTC,"The author really nailed it with the backhand rallies. I've seen so many matches of Federer where he plays really aggressively to win the first set, only to get stuck in bad baseline rallies in later sets. The most memorable example for me is the 2012 semis against nadal in Australian open where he was a set and break up and then lost after getting stuck in an unfavorable rut of rallies."
tennis,3cppdh,mrfatbush,7,Thu Jul 9 22:04:35 2015 UTC,That's been Federer's downfall against Nadal - he has never found a pattern to successfully break away from Nadal hitting high and heavy into his backhand. I've always felt that he's been too stubborn in staying crosscourt and trying to hit over his backhand too much instead of using the slice down the line early in the rally to change the dynamic.
tennis,3cppdh,GATSBYH20,5,Thu Jul 9 23:30:59 2015 UTC,"Federer needs a very high serving percentage and constantly needs to be attacking, and if he gets a lead, he can't have long lapses. I think Fed still mentally intimidates Murray and even Novak. Novak is just so solid now that he can still beat Fed most times, but I think Fed still intimidates/rattles them in way that it can mean 1 freebie game a set.   I don't think Fed should serve and volley too much, Murray really seems to be focusing heavily on returns, and it might not be a good idea to give him a target."

tennis,3cqle1,hatpersonn,9,Thu Jul 9 23:57:32 2015 UTC,"You're almost entirely facing the net when you hit the ball. What I do personally is face the side fence and turn into the ball on contact(Sampras does this as well). This gives it a lot more power. Also, you're letting the ball drop too much. The current height of your toss is a little high, but you're letting it drop to a comfortable height to hit it instead of jumping up and reaching to hit the ball. By jumping up and reaching for it your power will increase tremendously. Also, another thing I would recommend is putting your ball on the throat of the racket before tossing. This allows you to start the toss at the same place, increasing the consistency."
tennis,3cqle1,Personacorona,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:48:42 2015 UTC,"What I do personally is face the side fence and turn into the ball on contact(Sampras does this as well)   Federer's the exact same as Sampras.  But saying that you have to be sideways at point of contact is like fundamentally wrong.  It's just a variation.  Many players with great serves face chest forwards on contact. Kyrgios, Safin, Isner just to name a few.  What's important is a good shoulder over shoulder motion, which is best observed by how the back hip rises up as the racquet swings upwards to contact.  Something which OP lacks, his body swings around."
tennis,3cqle1,ydna_eissua,2,Fri Jul 10 06:14:00 2015 UTC,Isner's serve is a thing of beauty
tennis,3cqle1,Valinor_,6,Fri Jul 10 10:45:07 2015 UTC,"You have good knee bend but you don't do anything with it. You bend your knees and hold it, then just fall forward into the court after making contact. After bending your knees you need to drive up and into the ball as you swing. Others say that you let the ball drop and that's true. But if you use your legs to launch into the ball you'll contact the ball higher. Engaging your legs will increase your power and allow you to maintain good serve pace throughout a match. It's not really jumping into the serve so much as pushing hard into the service motion with your legs."
tennis,3cqle1,Amendodleman2013,4,Fri Jul 10 01:46:00 2015 UTC,"The Biggest problem with your serve is that you are stopping completely in the middle of your swing which not only takes away from the power of your serve, but also could put stress on your shoulder since it is being used to generate all the force. You have two main options, slow down the start of your swing (what I would do) or change your toss. You can lower your toss, but you'll probably be speeding through your serve without getting the full potential out of it.  Slowing down your swing seems like it would be harder than changing the toss but it is actually rather simple. When you step up to the line take a deep breath and try to relax your body. I would also bounce the ball slower, because you wont be able to stay relaxed while throwing the ball like you did in the video. Just focus on the relaxation at the beginning and make sure your swing is fluid when you actually hit serves. If you find yourself stopping completely during your swing, practice the fluid motion without the ball.  Another added benefit of relaxation is that it allows you to access your current muscular potential fully through the stretch reflex cycle. SRC: think of your tendons as rubber bands, to get maximal stretch and eventually energy when the rubber band pops back you must stay relaxed, if the rubber band is so tight that it can't stretch very far it wont spring back with much force.   Moral of the story, relaxation during the serve will have many benefits besides a more fluid motion. Work on the timing and you'll have a more powerful and effortless serve in no time.   Good luck!"
tennis,3cqle1,startinup,3,Fri Jul 10 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"No pronation happening. Contact is too low.  You're floating during your jump, not getting any weight behind it.  Your arm action is weak!!!!     You can stop and hold the trophy pose (this is not an issue) however, you don't let the racquet drop when initiating your swing. Because of this, you have no momentum from your racquet going into the ball.  Loosen up a bit before you accelerate and whip that arm around without losing control.  The swing should mimic a double pendulum.    Only take this loose approach if you're properly pronating.  Arm pronation will help you accelerate faster as you're able to extend farther with your arm and giving yourself a much longer swing and more deceleration time.  I say arm pronation rather than wrist pronation because the humerus should be rotating within the shoulder capsule during your swing.    Do not just try to do this with your arm, your shoulder and torso should be in lock step with your arm as your rotate to protect over stressing your joints.  You do this already somewhat, but keep in mind that if you want your racquet to go faster, the body will need to be in full cooperation with your intent.  Source:  I've been a USPTA and PTR certified tennis pro, junior tennis director, and have played D3 tennis.  My serve is pretty boss too."
tennis,3cqle1,tells,3,Fri Jul 10 03:22:25 2015 UTC,"The first thing I noticed is that you're not swinging with a full extension of your arm.  This is most likely due to the fact that you're hitting the ball too late--on its way down.  You should be striking the ball at the apex of the toss, that brief moment where it's finished moving up but before it starts to fall.    Related to that, I think you're tossing the ball too high which interrupts your motion causing you to wait in an awkward position (after your back foot meets your front foot)."
tennis,3cqle1,soybobomb,3,Fri Jul 10 00:44:20 2015 UTC,"Not particularly relative to his serve, but when I hear ""hitting it at the apex of the toss"", I think of Berdych's ridiculously high ball toss.  Back on topic, I agree to soybobomb. I believe the most important part of the serve is the ball toss. Once you are really comfortable with the height and positioning of your ball toss, when you add in things such as knee bend, the jump and pronation, it all feels just right and comfortable. If you experience any pain with your serve, you're most likely putting yourself in an awkward position with your ball toss.  Also, I'm not sure what other people think (correct me if I'm wrong), but it feels like your serve is tight and tense (not sure if I'm using the right words here) most likely due to your follow through. After hitting the serve, you should just let your arm go through with the natural motion instead of stopping it yourself. This might put some additional strain on your shoulders.  Lastly, your ball toss arm. This is more towards power in your serve rather than technique. From experience, I keep my ball toss arm extended until the last minute and then I extend my knees and hit the serve. To me, if you're doing everything else correctly, leaving the ball toss arm extended prevents you from prematurely hitting your serve. It also feels like I generate more racquet head speed by doing this. More racquet head speed = faster serve."
tennis,3cqle1,tophuuu,3,Fri Jul 10 02:47:20 2015 UTC,Inadequate wrist pronation.  Hand and racket should start out together.  Follow through is not pronounced enough.
tennis,3cqle1,Unwanted_Commentary,3,Fri Jul 10 02:58:32 2015 UTC,"Use continental grip, turn sideways, keep your right elbow up in the trophy position."
tennis,3cqle1,LoveFifty,2,Fri Jul 10 03:02:04 2015 UTC,"I watched this video a few times and there's a few suggestions that I hope you may consider! Your serve is underutilized, and I would say it's because your power is being restricted due to the fact that you're stopping during your swing. I feel as if your follow through is not emphasized enough. I recommend you try to change up your toss if you're comfortable enough? It puts you in an awkward stance and it hinders your ability to really do all the things I've said above. I do believe it is the source of the small problems in your serve. I hope you find great feedback in these comments, and good luck!"

tennis,3cnyzi,Skyluz,6,Thu Jul 9 14:13:20 2015 UTC,Amazing point by Muguruza
tennis,3cnyzi,Beforehand87,4,Thu Jul 9 13:48:19 2015 UTC,Muguruza into the Top 10!  EDIT: #9 with the final; #6 with the title.

tennis,3cnyzi,rafessi,3,Thu Jul 9 12:26:25 2015 UTC,"No signs of nerves yet, Radwanska's only hope is if Garbine gets tight and let's the occasion get to her because game wise, she has nothing that can trouble her  Muguruza just has too much firepower for her."
tennis,3cnyzi,itsmekathy,3,Thu Jul 9 12:46:00 2015 UTC,Finally Aga! Now make a match of it!
tennis,3cnyzi,rafessi,3,Thu Jul 9 13:06:07 2015 UTC,"Lifeline for Radwanska, Muguruza made too many errors in that game."
tennis,3cnyzi,TareXmd,3,Thu Jul 9 13:07:29 2015 UTC,Loving Aga these past 20 mins...
tennis,3cnyzi,soyunamariposa,3,Thu Jul 9 13:17:53 2015 UTC,Gah 3 sets! Cmon Muguruza!!!!
tennis,3cnyzi,king_of_blades,3,Thu Jul 9 13:18:53 2015 UTC,Not like this...
tennis,3cnyzi,rafessi,3,Thu Jul 9 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"And she finally does it... Thoroughly deserved, but my... Aga would be livid with her box about that call."
tennis,3cnyzi,FoodCourtDruid,3,Thu Jul 9 14:07:16 2015 UTC,This final has a 3-set Serena win written all over it.
tennis,3cnyzi,WahooJunkie,-1,Thu Jul 9 14:18:08 2015 UTC,We've still got a semi to play...
tennis,3cnyzi,abuttfarting,6,Thu Jul 9 14:23:58 2015 UTC,"I would like either of these ladies to win, but I think it will be Muguruza."
tennis,3cnyzi,itsmekathy,4,Thu Jul 9 11:37:02 2015 UTC,Aga totally overpowered here.
tennis,3cnyzi,gregorramza,4,Thu Jul 9 12:34:00 2015 UTC,What happened there?
tennis,3cnyzi,WahooJunkie,5,Thu Jul 9 14:08:23 2015 UTC,"Aga issued a late challenge mid-rally when someone from her box shouted ""OUT!"".  She was wrong, it was in.    Muguruza had sent the next ball long, so if Aga had not challenged it would have been game point Aga instead of match point Muguruza.  Basically, one of her coaches might have cost her the match."
tennis,3cnyzi,blekginger,4,Thu Jul 9 14:14:09 2015 UTC,And she waited a long long time before actually challenging. Poor by the umpire to allow it.
tennis,3cnyzi,gregorramza,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:15:21 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/Fgam0aL.jpg  It seems that she challenged after Muguruza's error. That's really unfortunate. If she could wait for a few seconds maybe she would be the finalist.
tennis,3cnyzi,Skyluz,2,Thu Jul 9 14:27:12 2015 UTC,Was not expecting that. Third set here we come?
tennis,3cnyzi,AcingCoder,2,Thu Jul 9 13:14:40 2015 UTC,I really hope Radwanska makes it to the finals. She's a fun player to watch.
tennis,3cnyzi,juiceson,2,Thu Jul 9 13:26:30 2015 UTC,Haha oh no what an unfortunate challenge
tennis,3cnyzi,TareXmd,2,Thu Jul 9 14:05:21 2015 UTC,Holy shit..... Aga.
tennis,3cnyzi,Atlaffinity75,2,Thu Jul 9 14:05:36 2015 UTC,Phew. Sorry but Aga would have been mauled against Serena.
tennis,3cnyzi,MoreDblRainbows,5,Thu Jul 9 14:06:53 2015 UTC,She pushed her to three in the last final in 2012
tennis,3cnyzi,itsmekathy,2,Thu Jul 9 14:08:49 2015 UTC,Never realized how tall Lindsay Davenport is until I see her standing beside Tracy Austin and Sue Barker now.
tennis,3cnyzi,gbinasia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:11:24 2015 UTC,That failed smash...What's happening to you Muguruza?
tennis,3cnyzi,nachoman456,4,Thu Jul 9 13:39:15 2015 UTC,jesus who knew that the biggest mistake made would come from radwanska's team... it couldve been so different if she didnt challenge
tennis,3cnyzi,random989898,2,Thu Jul 9 14:06:51 2015 UTC,"When did the challenge actually happen? It looked like Aga returned the ""out"" ball and the Muguruza hit it out and then Aga challenged? I didn't see exactly what happened the earlier shot."
tennis,3cnyzi,nachoman456,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:14:23 2015 UTC,"mugu continued playing after the challenge call, and put it out, but aga had already challenged on a call that she shouldn't have because it seemed in and was"
tennis,3cnyzi,Skyluz,2,Thu Jul 9 15:28:54 2015 UTC,Muguruza has this in the bag.

tennis,3cnyzi,Skyluz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:18:49 2015 UTC,Just saying what everyone thought at the time.

tennis,3cnyzi,nighthound1,2,Thu Jul 9 14:44:38 2015 UTC,"Aga looks like a stick compared to Muguruza, getting completely overpowered."
tennis,3cnyzi,Atlaffinity75,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:49:02 2015 UTC,Radwanska looks too thin. TV adds weight so she must be scary thin.
tennis,3cnyzi,advicethrowaway619,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:57:58 2015 UTC,google says 56 kg at 172 cm
tennis,3cnyzi,TareXmd,5,Thu Jul 9 13:14:44 2015 UTC,"Wow. That's supermodel thin (NSFW), not athlete thin. Girl needs to add lots of muscle."
tennis,3cnyzi,gbinasia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:20:52 2015 UTC,"Did she lose a lot of weight? I remember her having a much bulkier build, but it could be my imagination."
tennis,3cnyzi,jkalderash,2,Thu Jul 9 13:16:29 2015 UTC,I can't believe I had Muguruza losing in the first round.
tennis,3cnyzi,melodicsyrup,2,Thu Jul 9 12:19:07 2015 UTC,"One thing is for certain, whoever wins the Williams/Sharapova match is Wimbledon Champion."
tennis,3cnyzi,beepbloopbloop,13,Thu Jul 9 11:40:06 2015 UTC,That's very kind of you to Sharapova.
tennis,3cnyzi,melodicsyrup,0,Thu Jul 9 11:49:12 2015 UTC,"Sharapova has a 12:2 record against Radwanska. And Muguruza is in the process of bottling a 1 set and a break lead, so I can't see her outplaying Maria for 2 sets."
tennis,3cnyzi,beepbloopbloop,3,Thu Jul 9 13:30:15 2015 UTC,I meant she has no chance of getting to the final.
tennis,3cnyzi,melodicsyrup,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:39:20 2015 UTC,Awww what?:( I have £10 riding on her.
tennis,3cnyzi,gman311,6,Thu Jul 9 13:46:43 2015 UTC,I wish it were more competitive. I hate that this is the case.
tennis,3cnyzi,MCallanan,13,Thu Jul 9 11:48:54 2015 UTC,I don't know... I think either of these ladies could give Sharapova a lot of trouble in the finals.
tennis,3cnyzi,Atlaffinity75,3,Thu Jul 9 12:15:42 2015 UTC,Yeah. I would favor Garbine over Maria.
tennis,3cnyzi,nista002,3,Thu Jul 9 12:51:25 2015 UTC,"If Aga wins, sure. Muguruza has the capability to beat Serena, and I think I would call her the favorite against Maria with the form she's been in."
tennis,3cnyzi,vedderer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:25:06 2015 UTC,"What makes you so certain?  I don't think Radwanska could beat Serena (if Serena wins), but I think Muguruza could.  She's beaten her before."
tennis,3cnyzi,TareXmd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:48:23 2015 UTC,"Wow. Aga struggling against hard hitters is no myth. If it's that long an issue, she really should have worked on her speed and power."

tennis,3cnyzi,rafessi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:05:47 2015 UTC,"Will be interesting to see how Muguruza recovers from this, against Kerber she recovered just fine, let's see whether she can replicate that here."
tennis,3cnyzi,Skyluz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:19:27 2015 UTC,Tables have turned it seems. Well played Radwanska.
tennis,3cnyzi,rafessi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:24:27 2015 UTC,"Nerves have definitely got the better of her, she's lost 6 games in a row now, has to reverse this slide soon or this could get away from her really quickly"

tennis,3cnyzi,mreatsum,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:43:53 2015 UTC,Needed that volley on the high ball.

tennis,3cnyzi,itsmekathy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:08:11 2015 UTC,"Aga needs to mix up her shot selection a little, I think. She's not going to beat her in a power battle from the baseline, but she could beat her in a battle of wits and clever shots."
tennis,3cnyzi,Atlaffinity75,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:41:49 2015 UTC,"You can't hit a ""clever shot"" when you are overpowered.   She could try coming in."
tennis,3cnyzi,itsmekathy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:59:16 2015 UTC,She's doing it now.
tennis,3cnyzi,TareXmd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:14:46 2015 UTC,"That didn't work when hard hitters made their appearance in the WTA, to dominate over Hingis and the like."
tennis,3cnyzi,itsmekathy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:49:41 2015 UTC,"Doesn't mean it won't work here, and she needs to try something other than what she's doing."
tennis,3cnyzi,TareXmd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:50:56 2015 UTC,"Hitting harder and running faster is what's required here. Beyond that, her only success has been with hitting the lines and approaching the net."
tennis,3cnyzi,jchaucer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:54:14 2015 UTC,"if muguruza starts showing nerves, then i think aga has a good chance. her game is just too smart."

tennis,3cnyzi,Skyluz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:32:56 2015 UTC,I swear you can't challenge after you've played on?
tennis,3cnyzi,jkalderash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:38:14 2015 UTC,You have to challenge immediately after hitting.
tennis,3cnyzi,bonji96,-1,Thu Jul 9 12:43:44 2015 UTC,"That was my impression too. It seemed like she looked up, saw her shot was going out and then challenged."
tennis,3cnyzi,Atlaffinity75,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:39:35 2015 UTC,Too bad Keys didn't win.  Would have been a fun match to watch.   Maybe Radwanska will pull a bathroom break.
tennis,3cnyzi,Skyluz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:50:18 2015 UTC,Muguruza making more errors now

tennis,3cnyzi,sidskorna,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:18:30 2015 UTC,Not able to watch this live (Edit: on TV).  Has any commentator pointed out that Radwanska has turned the match around since she started moving Muguruza side to side?

tennis,3cnyzi,dannhash,2,Thu Jul 9 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion that its a common problem for the players on the tour to maintain their level for a whole 2 sets, I could be completely wrong but its what I feel"
tennis,3cnyzi,gbinasia,2,Thu Jul 9 13:51:58 2015 UTC,Bla bla bla. What will your next comment be about? Grunting? How Serena Williams has too many muscles?   'Cause it seems like it's half the shit we read on the WTA threads.
tennis,3cnyzi,dannhash,4,Thu Jul 9 13:30:44 2015 UTC,"Serena is a great champion mainly because of her unparalleled mental strength....its what keeps her head and shoulders over the rest. This is quite clearly a mental crumble by murguruza and is sadly a feature in most WTA matches, some say its because its more competitive but I personally don't like the huge dips in form mid match....just my opinion."

Not sure where Judy is ""writing columns"", I've seen some tweets, but it's no more or less than most players or partners or parents do on tour. I've not seen her tweet much about her opponents but it's not a bad thing either.  Different strokes for different folks I guess."

tennis,3coh34,derf82,12,Thu Jul 9 16:26:21 2015 UTC,Yes I assume they do. I've always wondered why players with big serves don't play mixed doubles more often. Imagine Karlovic serving at some 5ft 6 woman
tennis,3coh34,pounro,8,Thu Jul 9 17:05:26 2015 UTC,"I think its just a matter of them wanting to concentrate on singles and mens doubles as the prize money in mixed doubles is less than 1/3 of winnings in mens doubles and considerably less than singles winnings. I think that's why you never see someone who has a realistic chance of going deep in a major play mixed doubles, might not be worth the fatigue/injury risk that may negatively effect their performance in the big money events.  edit: http://www.totalsportek.com/tennis/wimbledon-prize-money/"
tennis,3coh34,thevadster,7,Thu Jul 9 18:09:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, but often men will hit more kick or spin on their serve because women tend to have more trouble handling spin than men.  In the sense of taking it easy on the women, not if they want to win."
tennis,3coh34,Mehrban,3,Thu Jul 9 14:33:49 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Generally in doubles, you want to get a high percentage of first serves in so as not to let the opponents get a play on a second serve, so players won't go for flat bombs as much as in singles. Further, in mixed, if you miss the first serve, it's a bit of a waste; rather give the woman a 120mph first serve, which may be way more than she can handle anyway,  than risk missing a 140mph blaster."
tennis,3coh34,VandalsStoleMyHandle,8,Thu Jul 9 21:03:37 2015 UTC,There's a rule in mixed doubles that men serving against women can't try their best to win.

tennis,3cp16l,Iiii_I_I_I,5,Thu Jul 9 17:00:12 2015 UTC,"He wraps the leather around the buttcap several times before continuing it up the pallet.  If you look at his frame in 2013-14, you'll see a grey part (exposed pallet) where his leather runs out.   He then wraps his Tournagrip several times around the knob to build up the grip even further."
tennis,3cp16l,WeepingNeckbeard,3,Thu Jul 9 20:44:16 2015 UTC,Personal preference
tennis,3cp16l,Madd_wheels,2,Thu Jul 9 18:18:51 2015 UTC,"Since he plays one handed on both wings, he doesn't really need grip on the upper part of his racket. Like the guy said above me, it's really a personal preference, he just chooses to not have grip where he doesn't need it"
tennis,3cp16l,Wigley123,2,Thu Jul 9 19:04:14 2015 UTC,Buttcap area looks like it's been built up as a custom grip; guess he likes the way it fits in his palm. Plus overgrip (Tournagrip) wrapped only halfway up; one-handed backhand players don't use the top half of the grip anyway.
tennis,3cp16l,VandalsStoleMyHandle,2,Thu Jul 9 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"i either read or heard him say that he just copied it from someone else. I don't know if it was a coach or hitting partner, but when he was in the juniors he saw someone do it and just started doing the same thing. I'll try to find the source."
tennis,3cp16l,hooilgan111988,-2,Fri Jul 10 05:16:41 2015 UTC,"Typically the grip would cover the whole of the handle but since he had to change it during the game and uses one handed forehands and backhands, he only used the grip on the bottom half to save time (since he changed the grip at every changeover)."
tennis,3cp16l,King-Kongs-Dad,7,Thu Jul 9 20:26:07 2015 UTC,This is incorrect...he just wraps more at the bottom to have a thicker buttcap. Likely helps him hold the racquet better without it slipping.
tennis,3cp16l,TicallionStallion,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:58:49 2015 UTC,"No.. The butt is molded that way, it has nothing to do with his overgrips."
tennis,3cp16l,MCallanan,2,Fri Jul 10 03:41:09 2015 UTC,It is not molded that way.  The flare comes from wrapping the leather and overgrip several times around the bottom.   Thomas Muster did the same thing.

tennis,3cpxn0,rhomqw,2,Fri Jul 10 03:05:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard much, but from what I've heard, he's having trouble handling the power of the pro game. He's not a big guy and he hasn't figured out how to deal with big hitters.   Big hitters in juniors tend to be inconsistent, so he could count on errors. That strategy doesn't work as well with older pros."

Murray, whilst finally finding his clay form just isn't on Nole's level on clay and hardcourt and comparable on grass.  Nadal... well...  Stan is unpredictable and still inconsistent, despite having a ridiculous highest level. Also, not as good on grass."
tennis,3cnxvk,blekginger,14,Thu Jul 9 11:44:25 2015 UTC,"See now you've added from any era. I'd actually go Nadal 2008-2010. Federer, whilst being consistently the GOAT, I'd actually argue Nadal has shown the highest quality of tennis."
tennis,3cnxvk,blekginger,33,Thu Jul 9 12:50:08 2015 UTC,Federer lost only 2 GS matches in 2 and a half years. He won 8 out of 10 in that span. That's the highest quality you'll ever get.
tennis,3cnxvk,SlothkongCR,5,Thu Jul 9 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"As good as Federer was in 04-07, he wouldn't have been able to pull that off if today, in my opinion."
tennis,3cnxvk,blekginger,11,Thu Jul 9 17:53:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The man lost 9 matches from 05-06. He won over 170. This was just after 04, which people occasionally forget about. But immediately after that season people then classified it as the second best season in tennis. 2004 is now just a footnote in his career.  I'd take Fed from 2005-2006 any day."
tennis,3cnxvk,Rac3318,6,Thu Jul 9 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"Lots of questions about the situation that would change the best choice.  If you don't know the opponent or surface, and if your player is not being told it's a game for your life, Nadal would probably not be the best choice.  Federer had higher win percentages in 2004 (92.50) 2005 (95.29) and 2006 (94.84) than Nadal has ever had. Nadal's best season on this stat would be 2013 actually, with 91.46, not 2008 (88.17) or 2010 (87.65) ...even though his slam record was better in 2010 because of Wimbledon. So 2006 Federer is the better random-opponent choice.  On the other hand, if you know the opponent will be specifically chosen to foil your player choice, Federer suddenly is no longer a good choice at all, because he has an obvious foil for your would-be executioner to choose, and unless you get lucky and the match conditions are tail-end-of-season indoors, Nadal will most likely win and you will die.  And then if the conditions are such that your player is told they are playing a game for your life, the discussion becomes a lot more about who could mentally handle that situation the best. (Making the assumption that your chosen player cares about saving you, that is)."
tennis,3cnxvk,seyakomo,2,Thu Jul 9 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"Mentally, I'd go for Nadal. Djokovic is getting there but he's not at Nadal's mental strength level yet. I'd trust Nadal to handle the pressure. The most important stat to me: He's the only player to hold a winning head-to-head against every other player in the top 30.   If we're talking about current form though, then yes, of course Djokovic right now."
tennis,3cnxvk,bezjones,-3,Thu Jul 9 18:22:43 2015 UTC,No one could beat Nadal on clay. But no-one (not literally) could beat Federer on every other surface!
tennis,3cnxvk,pounro,5,Thu Jul 9 13:02:25 2015 UTC,Nadal is a two time Wimby champion after all (2008 and 2010). And I regularly think back at Nadal's 2013 US Open final against Djokovic - the most ridiculous performance I've ever seen by any player. It was just perfect - that final set was out of this world.
tennis,3cnxvk,blekginger,3,Thu Jul 9 13:12:59 2015 UTC,Novak at USO 2011 was even crazier IMO. Really comparable since it was the same two guys.
tennis,3cnxvk,nista002,2,Thu Jul 9 19:37:47 2015 UTC,The 2013 US Open was just Nadal crushing his opponents from start to finish. IIRC he didn't drop a serve or a set until the final. His serves and forehand were huge the entire time
tennis,3cnxvk,duskhat,3,Thu Jul 9 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm new to this sub and I've only recently gotten into watching tennis. I'm sure this question has been asked a lot, but what exactly went wrong with Nadal? He's only 28 right? Is it just that he played at such a young age that his prime was earlier than most athletes so he's just burned out? Or injuries or something? I'm just confused because I feel like he's not old enough where you can just shrug your shoulders and say he's declining."
tennis,3cnxvk,seijeezy,2,Thu Jul 9 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"He's always had injury problems, like when he was young doctors said he'd never be able to play past 21-22 with his body. So he's always been out for periods with his injury, only to always come back several months/half a year later just as strong or even stronger.   Only now that hasn't happened, he has significantly dropped in quality since he came back at the start of the year. The jury is out on why this has happened, everyone seems to have their own theory. One thing is for sure though: some of it is he just doesn't have the confidence he used to - he has said this himself, that he gets nervous/tight at big points. That's certainly some of it. If you ask me, he just doesn't seem to be at the same place physically either as he used to. He used to run and hit forehand winners from placers you that seemed impossible, and when he used to get a deep ball onto his forehand down at the baseline he'd just hit it right off the bounce and find a winner (this is extremely hard, it should be impossible).  Simply put: Rafa's forehand, when in form, is one of the best shots we've ever seen in tennis (the best if you ask me, others will disagree though).   Back to his injury problems: given that he's 28, that he's been able to keep on going for this long is astounding. And it's even more astounding when you consider the fact he plays one of the most physically demanding types of tennis out there.  Will he come back and compete for Slams again? Hard to say. The confidence problem is certainly a fixable one, but from there it just depends on what's going on with him otherwise. Have his injuries finally taken its toll and he can't come back physically where he used to be? Only time will tell. Lots of people are calling for a change of coach (he's had his uncle Toni as his coach since forever), but I don't know if that helps. If you ask me we first have to know what the problem is: is it still just a confidence problem, then sure - change coach and get a new perspective, that probably will help. But if his problems are physical? Then changing coach probably won't do anything, if anything that just risks messing up more as a change in pattern is very risky.

Not only is it poor sportsperson-ship, it's fucking annoying to listen to. Good tennis or bad tennis is irrelvant if no one wants to show up for an eight hour day of assholes screeching on drop shots. Some people don't seem to care, but you can't blame those that do."
tennis,3co32m,arturoman,5,Thu Jul 9 18:25:22 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't quite agree with arturoman, I know people who will switch off, for example, Ferrer, unless he's really playing someone at the top to make it a must see. They see it as a lot more forgiveable because they seem to be noises of genuine exertion, but its still annoying.  The main issue I have with it is some of these noises must be genuinely taking extra effort to make during the points. They are not an exhale, they are being given voice behind them and exaggerated beyond any value other than irritating your opponent. I'd say the majority of people I know into tennis these days flat out refuse to watch women's tennis, not because of the level of play, but simply because the chances of one of them screaming their heads off whenever they hit a ball are so high they just don't bother to see if it will happen anymore."

tennis,3co32m,LustreForce,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't understand why the WTA or ATP can't just outright ban excessive grunting. The article claimed that it was the way that players hit the ball that caused grunting. But an exhale from a particularly hard shot or serve is a difference noise completely. Also, there are players who don't grunt at all, even if they are hitting the ball just as hard as someone who does grunt. So to say that is just how they hit the ball makes no sense seeing as someone can hit the ball at the exact same pace and not make any noise. I just find it as a nuisance while playing and while watching. It's just distracting and takes your mind off the game."
tennis,3co32m,WhiiteMexiican,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:58:44 2015 UTC,Players will complain that a ban will upset their rhythm and rituals during a point. I'd imagine they'd try grouping it with pre-serve mannerisms (e.g. pulling up socks/shirt). And then how would you enforce it? With the players that do shriek it's obviously become a habit. What should the umpire do if they break the rule several times in a match? I agree that there should be a ban but it's a tough issue.
tennis,3coev7,t0by96,9,Thu Jul 9 14:09:19 2015 UTC,"The commentators say there is a psychological advantage to serving first, but that when they looked at the stats the winner of the fifth set was split 50-50 between serving first and second, no advantage.

tennis,3coev7,blekginger,5,Thu Jul 9 16:12:23 2015 UTC,"Well if we're talking football... in World Cup penalty shoot outs, the team that takes the first penalty has won 60% of the time.   If you're next to take a penalty and you win if you score, you score 90% of the time.  If you're next to take a penalty and you need to score to stay in it, you only score 45% of the time.  I'd imagine the psychology behind it is similar, even if football is a team sport and in tennis it's just you - which probably is a factor that plays a part."
tennis,3coev7,blekginger,3,Thu Jul 9 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"Do you have a link?  That sounds really interesting!  45% is so low, especially when I would assume that the normal conversion rate must be 75+%, I suppose it seems like positive>negative incentives."

I actually thought of the same thing yesterday while watching that match that is must be way easier to be up say 8-7 on your opponents serve and break rather than having to break and then serve for the match. It's probably just that if you serve and win that game, you really have nothing to lose when your opponent is serving because your focus is to break him and you win immediately. However if you don't, the score evens out and the same thing is repeated."

The problem with that is that the schedule's already crowded as it is with all the other events (doubles, mixed, etc) and you can't really fit it in  But personally, I still think it's just fine that they get paid the same if they're generating just as much revenue and viewers, which seems to generally be the case.  Also, at quite a few of the joint non-majors, men get paid more despite playing the same number of sets and I don't see anyone arguing that that's unfair."
tennis,3cpfdd,redavid,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:54:25 2015 UTC,I have a very good reason for that.  It's because I honestly didn't know pay was higher for men in some best of 3 tournaments.
tennis,3cpfdd,Aurua,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, i am sure the schedule would be difficult but probably doable. I was unaware, and kind of doubting, that they generate the same revenue and viewers. Maybe Serena does in america, like the US Open final, but i find it hard to believe in general that women's generates just as much revenue and viewers.. Perhaps they do and i am just ignorant.  I know that rogers cup, near me, has relatively less action during the womens year than they do in the mens year.   With that being said, if they are bringing in the same revenue and viewers at the grandslams then i have no issues.  I was unaware of the joint events don't offer equal. I think that is unfair and will eventually be equal payouts."
tennis,3cpfdd,alpacafarts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:18:37 2015 UTC,"Meh, you'd be getting really really tight with the scheduling  as it is if the women played best of 5. Most likely certain events starting (mixed, boys, girls) would need to be pushed back some in order to ensure that the men's and women's singles matches get completed and with some allotted rest for the players.  I'd say that Wimbledon would be the most difficult to adjust the schedule to this format at its current state."
tennis,3cpfdd,Jackofalll,0,Sat Jul 11 07:36:17 2015 UTC,"Ya but how many more tourneys and what's the difference in pay? I mean I think they still make more for playing less, when considering all the joint events and grand slams (since the GS payoffs are way more), which isn't fair. And plus the level of play is wayyy off, like not even close man come on. I wouldn't have a problem if they played a best of 5, and ONLY IF they do generate the same revenue and viewers but do they really? The payoff should be proportional to those 2 metrics. Ya the schedule is cramped but extend it a few days, what's the issue? And of course the trend seems to be that all the joint events will be paid the same in the near future. Edit: You think a Serena/Muguruza final will draw the same attention and revenue as a Djokovic/Fed or Murray final? Come on man..."
tennis,3cpfdd,redavid,2,Thu Jul 9 20:54:54 2015 UTC,"Edit: You think a Serena/Muguruza final will draw the same attention and revenue as a Djokovic/Fed or Murray final? Come on man...   At Wimbledon? Maybe not. But both US Open women's finals featuring Serena drew higher TV ratings than the men's finals in 2013 and 14 (and '13 featured Djokovic/Nadal). And it seems, at least for US viewers, the women's finals scored higher ratings at both the Australian and French Opens this year (I'm not sure it's really fair to include these things due to time zones and Americans having work or sleep or other things on a weekend morning to do).  Extending tourneys would be great, but I don't think that'll happen due to other events and logistics. Probably more likely that the men go to best-of-3 due to the injury concerns some players and pundits have expressed lately. Personally, I'd like both tours to go to the Olympics Men's format, best-of-3 for all rounds, best-of-5 for the final."
tennis,3cpfdd,Aurua,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:32:40 2015 UTC,"i am really against going to best of 3 for mens.  it ups the ante for the grandslams, makes them unique. It would not longer be ""so hard to win grand slam"" because it won't be like they are exerting themselves anymore than they usually do.. 7 matches in 13 days is not very hard for the pro's if they are all best of 3.  Bo5 is what makes grand slams harder to win. take that away and you just have a 2 week long masters.  I think that is my main issue with equal prize money for genders. Premiers seems harder, so why the big fuss about the grandslams.   But in general, i am fine with it as it helps promote womens tennis and the WTA, which is always a good thing for the sport."

I'd gladly give women the same prize money without feeling weird if they played best of 5, but I think they're going overboard for demanding the same court coverage if they are putting out a less exciting product."

Federer didn't really seem like he did stuff for attention like Kyrgios rather he just got mad frequently with a semi-Safin flair. Kyrgios literally climbs fences at Wimbledon and does the most pretentious things like wearing that headband or saying shit like ""I have sex before matches"". You don't really see Kyrgios smashing racquets but you do see him being a pretentious-ass fuck boy."

He told the press that he just liked it....just like all the other obvious cover up lies he told the press. Tell me that him climbing the railing to watch Hewitt/Kokkinakis wasn't pretentious. Tell me that him hugging the ball boy wasn't pretentious.   Okay I'll concede then, Kyrgios is not pretentious. He is just a 20 year old boy who still has yet to mature and did all the stuff he did because he is the new god of tennis :))))))))))))))))):::)))))"
tennis,3clgc5,Fikir1,12,Thu Jul 9 01:34:08 2015 UTC,He wanted to watch one of his best mates play.  How does standing on railing under those circumstances make you pretentious?

tennis,3clgc5,blekginger,35,Thu Jul 9 12:57:26 2015 UTC,Some other young Federer stories I know:   Federer ruining a club's brand new tarp by throwing his racket around during a practice session. Federer behaving so badly that his manager encourages the tournament owner to fine him causing fed to lose money from playing the tournament.
tennis,3clgc5,Irrepressible_Monkey,13,Wed Jul 8 21:31:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Federer used to have a reputation as a talented head-case.   I remember an early interview where he said he wanted to be successful like Marat Safin and not waste his talent by continuing to implode during matches as he had been.  How times change. :)"
tennis,3clgc5,TheOneSurvivalist,17,Thu Jul 9 01:18:10 2015 UTC,I'm sure I heard Borg was the same . Used to completely lose his temper when he was younger then he turned into the Iceman
tennis,3clgc5,KyleG,12,Wed Jul 8 22:25:32 2015 UTC,Borg's parents took his rackets away for a year because of his temper as a teenager. He must have been very talented for that not to screw up his development.
tennis,3clgc5,CookieDoughCooter,2,Thu Jul 9 03:48:09 2015 UTC,"You have to keep in mind that fewer people were trying to turn pro back then, too, so things were a bit less complicated. Very talented, yes, but the feat isn't nearly as impressive as it would be today.  McEnroe is on record as basically saying early rounds of a Slam you could dick around, have a smoke, have a drink, and show up and easily win your first round, whereas now you have to be on point from the first second or else you actually could lose.  Hell, Big Bill Tilden basically didn't start playing tennis until after college. I mean, he played before, but he was not good and didn't take the game seriously (his college team wouldn't even take him). It was only after college that he got serious about it."
tennis,3clgc5,HymenAnnihilator,4,Thu Jul 9 15:27:18 2015 UTC,That's so crazy. I used to not enjoy watching Federer in his dominance because he was so emotionless on the court outside of a quiet fist pump. It helped make him such a great player - no negative energy to feed off of - and now I really admire it!

tennis,3clgc5,get_go,15,Wed Jul 8 21:25:57 2015 UTC,I wonder if Kyrgios' demeanor will become Fed-like as he ages. That would be pretty funny
tennis,3clgc5,gibisee4,8,Wed Jul 8 23:03:25 2015 UTC,Also in those years there was none of this constant attention via social media and other things. People would only hear about Federer's antics. There would not be any video or a platform to amplify those behaviors.
tennis,3clgc5,get_go,3,Thu Jul 9 05:09:34 2015 UTC,"No one would hear about this if it happened today, even with social media. No one cares about someone in the 400's getting fined $100 in some tournament we've never heard of."
tennis,3clgc5,crutr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:39:46 2015 UTC,True. The ranking of the player makes a difference. I don't know if Federer was like that after he cracked the top 100.
tennis,3clgc5,102564,2,Thu Jul 9 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"I think, if anything, Kyrgios is very reminiscent of Andre in his formative years. Entertaining, brash, infuriating at times. You love him or you hate him. Sometimes both, at the same time. Maybe as he matures he can channel all his energy into positive thinking and actions on the court. He's so close to being absolutely loved by everyone."
tennis,3clgc5,CookieDoughCooter,2,Thu Jul 9 14:27:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah he definitely reminds me of Agassi. Especially with the whole ""I don't like tennis thing,"" which sort of makes me think he wants people to be reminded of Andre."
tennis,3clgc5,plump1234,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:43:35 2015 UTC,He has a pretty stoic demeanor before his matches. I could totally see him keeping that throughout if he doesn't burn out from tennis - he has already said he doesn't really like it...

tennis,3clgc5,c3vzn,2,Wed Jul 8 23:07:22 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Sure, Kyrgios might get a little hotheaded, but it rarely ever costs him matches. He's very mentally strong."
tennis,3clgc5,red_280,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:17:56 2015 UTC,Agreed. Fed only changed because he himself was embarrassed after seeing a comparison of him and Safin blowing up in a match. I think these top players have too much of an ego to change because of the media or public.

I tried stringing lower, I tried a hybrid, still was ruining my elbow. Haven't tried the 16x19 or the spin effect version but I imagine they'd be more comfortable. Wilson's QC is also notoriously bad so maybe I got a duff one. First racket I'd tried with 18x20 too so maybe my elbow's just weaker than I thought.   RF97 feels like a mallet, it feels nothing like the PS90. Really slow through the air. It seems like a vegemite racket though, some people love it. I absolutely hated it."

tennis,3cn7kw,ass_t0_ass,11,Thu Jul 9 07:20:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah stats like this are always misleading because you've got to take into account the opposition. Roger hasn't played anyone who's better than average except Simon at this year's tournament.   1st Round Dzumhur, who's up-and-coming but is probably top 50 at best in terms of potential. 2nd Round Querrey, who hasn't been up to much for a few years now.  3rd Round Groth, who is a worse version of Karlovic/Isner. 4th Round Bautista-Agut, who got injured.   Then you compare this to years where he's played guys like Berdych, Wawrinka, Raonic, Youzhny, Tsonga, Ferrero, Safin, Soderling, Ancic, Nalbandian all before the Semi-Final stage, his stats are bound to be better when he doesn't play players of that caliber."
tennis,3cn7kw,MakeshiftLeftBack,7,Thu Jul 9 10:22:01 2015 UTC,"4th Round Bautista-Agut, who got injured.   to be fair, Federer was absolutely crushing Bautista well before he tweaked his ankle.  The 1st set was over in like 19 minutes."
tennis,3cn7kw,bluemannew,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:19:56 2015 UTC,This is all very concerning; could mean a straight sets 3-0 defeat when he plays his first Top 10 in a semifinal.
tennis,3cn7kw,TareXmd,10,Thu Jul 9 11:15:05 2015 UTC,Murray hasn't played anyone in the Top 20. Could be bad when he plays his first Top 20.
tennis,3cn7kw,Personacorona,6,Thu Jul 9 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"If you want some positive news Murray has dropped sets against the 2 best players he's faced so far, Seppi and Karlovic, and I don't think he's looked as good as everyone says."
tennis,3cn7kw,MakeshiftLeftBack,6,Thu Jul 9 12:13:28 2015 UTC,"i agree, his opponents were just average. it seemed like gilles kind of succumbed to the federer magic. even in his press conference it seemed like he was really lacking confidence. i loved seeing him demolish tomas and the match against monfils he showed some great defense. seems to be back after his injuries. baptista agut was just not even close to his class. today gave me great hope though, gilles isn't a shitty player, he's not going to lose, he's going to make you beat him so we'll see how he does against andy."
tennis,3cn7kw,kingka,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:23:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he was lacking confidence. Simon plays a game that is simply based on probabilities - his main and only weapon is consistency. Everything about Simon is basically at the level of the top 20 player - his backhand is solid, he has a good forehand, pretty decent serve and good defense. He is not extraordinary in any one part of the game but he is no scrub either. So when he plays someone who has more weapons he needs some assistance from his opponents by being off their game. So if Giles is playing well and his opponent has a dip in form, he can take advantage. If Giles is off his game and his opponent's game is on, it makes the score very lopsided."
tennis,3cn7kw,btaz,6,Thu Jul 9 13:33:33 2015 UTC,"If you look at Federer's past draws, they've been almost easy if not easier in some cases. For example in 2006, he never dropped serve in 1st round-semis.  1)A young gasquet (14-2) 2)An old henman(he was over 30 and unseeded) 3)Mahut (done nothing notable at the time) 4)Berdych before he was ranked in top 10 5)Mario ancic  another year 1)H-T Lee 2)Koubek 3)Fish 4)Lopez 5)Schalken  Edit: Also, 1st serve % and aces are 100% not affected by opponnent type"
tennis,3cn7kw,MoronDetectorTennis,8,Thu Jul 9 12:01:48 2015 UTC,"Uh, that 2006 Wimbledon draw was one of the toughest draws in the history of tennis for a top seed through 5 rounds, idiot. There were audible gasps when he drew Gasquet in the first round (Gasquet was considered a HUGE talent and a potential future #1 and had finished ranked 16th the year before, would finish 18th that year, and 8th the following year, reaching the Wimbledon semis). ""Baby Federer."" It would be like drawing Dimitrov this year in the first round after he'd lost enough points by skipping clay events to be unseeded.   Henman was still dangerous enough to reach the SF at Queens and take a set off Hewitt that year. And this is only the 2nd round. You can not draw a seeded player in the first 2 rounds.   Then in the 3rd, he played Mahut, who was a Wimbledon juniors champion and would make the Queen's Club final the following year, having championship point on Andy Roddick.  Berdych was a rising star - the highest seed he could draw in the 4th round at #13. He was a finalist in Halle that year, won Halle in 2007, and was a Wimbledon finalist in 2010.  Ancic was a semi-finalist in 2004 (lost to Roddick in 4) and was called ""Baby Goran."" He was a young star who reached the Top 10 in 2006 but then contracted mono and was never the same again, forced to retire after trying to come back and it returning (and still managing to make the QF in Wimbledon 2008). His best surface was grass.   Compare that to his first 5 opponents this year. Dzumhur? On grass? Compared to fucking Gasquet? He's a 23-year-old clay court specialist.   Querry compared to Henman, even at that age?  Groth compared to Mahut?   Bautista-Agut compared to fucking Berdych?   Gilles ""pusher"" Simon, no history of success on grass, compared to Mario ""baby Goran"" Ancic?   I mean, really. Did you people even watch tennis back in 2006?"

tennis,3cn7kw,khfreek,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:01:24 2015 UTC,I can make a huge hyped up description of federer's 2015 players too if wanted.  1) dzumhur is a rising star. Made his 1st fo and wimby debut. Unlucky to play fed  2)Querrey has wins over djoko and many other top 10. His big serve is accentuatef on grass  3) Groth is legit ridiculous. Fastest server in the world with a strong forehand.   4) Agut has a strong baseli e game and former top 20  5) Simon has beaten fed twice and taken to 5 sets twice in 2 if his lossses  And again. 1st % and aces are SOLELY DEPENDENT on federer. But I can communicatey point w/o being asshole. Federer has improved his technique and strats over 9 years. Hes just less physically fit. Thats really the only reason he isnt dominating.
tennis,3cn7kw,MoronDetectorTennis,5,Thu Jul 9 15:26:06 2015 UTC,It's the internet and you made a ridiculous statement. You're gonna get called out on these things. It's just a pity you can't admit you were wrong.
tennis,3cn7kw,jleonardbc,2,Thu Jul 9 15:52:44 2015 UTC,"1) dzumhur is a rising star. Made his 1st fo and wimby debut. Unlucky to play fed   Nobody thinks Dzumhur is a rising star. He's 23 and virtually the only success he ever had on the futures circuit was on clay. And he's ranked 88th in the world. Gasquet had already finished the prior year 16th in the world.    2)Querrey has wins over djoko and many other top 10. His big serve is accentuatef on grass   Compared to Tim Henman...   3) Groth is legit ridiculous. Fastest server in the world with a strong forehand.   If Groth had a strong forehand he wouldn't have a career high ranking of 66 when he has the fastest serve in history. He had 19 career ATP wins coming into Wimbledon, and he's 27.   4) Agut has a strong baseli e game and former top 20   Average 4th round-caliber opponent who will never go past the 4th round at Wimbledon. Compare that to big-hitting 13th seed Berdych, one of only 6 active players to reach a Wimbledon final (aside from the Big 4, the only other is Lleyton Hewitt).    5) Simon has beaten fed twice and taken to 5 sets twice in 2 if his lossses   Never made it past the 4th round at Wimbledon (and only reached the 4th once), and he's 30. For Federer personally, this seemed potentially tricky given the matchup history, but it quickly became apparent that Simon wasn't as comfortable going against Federer's aggressiveness on grass as he was on HC and clay.    And again. 1st % and aces are SOLELY DEPENDENT on federer.   No, aces are also dependent on the return of serve. There's a reason big servers struggle to ace Federer. And do you think Federer would have hit 50 aces against Murray in the 2009 Wimbledon final?    But I can communicatey point w/o being asshole. Federer has improved his technique and strats over 9 years. Hes just less physically fit. Thats really the only reason he isnt dominating.   Yeah, Federer really needed to improve that technique of his. The ""most beautiful player ever"" who was dominating the sport for years. Federer is compensating for lost ground game with smarter serving. But he's also losing much more than he used to because he's not as good."
tennis,3cn7kw,hivaidsislethal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:31:38 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you, but first-serve % is based partially on serving strategy adapted to a particular opponent, and aces are based partially on opponent's returning ability."

tennis,3cn7kw,TODDLER_PUSSY,-5,Thu Jul 9 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"You are playing with fire here! Lots of Fed fans are desperately committed to the idea that Federer was much, much better in 2006 than he ever was again, regardless of any counter-evidence. It's how they excuse his relative decline from being a dominant number one."
tennis,3cn7kw,seyakomo,3,Thu Jul 9 12:18:40 2015 UTC,"Watch how he played in 2006. I love Fed, but he was FAR better in 2006. He was consistently unbelievably good. I believe one year he only lost to 3 opponents?"
tennis,3cn7kw,TODDLER_PUSSY,3,Thu Jul 9 13:02:52 2015 UTC,"In 2006 Federer lost a total of five matches to only two different opponents, Murray (once) and Nadal (four times)."

tennis,3cn7kw,plenty_of_time,3,Thu Jul 9 13:50:24 2015 UTC,You serious? Have you ever watched Federer in 2006?
tennis,3cn7kw,Personacorona,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:26:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, a hell of a lot. His second serve was weaker, his endurance was not at its peak, and his backhand was not quite the weapon it is at its best. Sure, he was injury free, and he played incredible tennis, but I think Fed at his best now beats Fed at his best then, and I bet he would tell you that himself. I know this is controversial!"
tennis,3cn7kw,plenty_of_time,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:39:17 2015 UTC,"It's controversial because it's wrong. His backhand wasn't a weapon you say? Also, are you seriously going to say Roger's endurance wasn't at its peak? Federer was unbelievably fit. And you forgot to mention his forehand-the greatest shot in the history of our sport-was at its all time peak."
tennis,3cn7kw,Personacorona,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:50:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, I say that because I've watched hours and hours of his 2006 play. His endurance was not at its peak--see the non-effort against Murray in Cincinnati compared to what he did the next year and in 09"
tennis,3cn7kw,seyakomo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"That was the only bad match he played in the entire year. Every other tournament he reached at least the final and won 12 of the 16. The 4 he lost? All to Nadal, 3 of them on clay."
tennis,3cn7kw,MoronDetectorTennis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:30:32 2015 UTC,"I think 2006 Federer would beat Federer of today on court coverage speed, long-match endurance, and his incredible reflexes (his ability to stand on the baseline and pretty much half-volley hard shots by big hitters back then was unreal)  And of course, if it were a random day, his 2006 self would be more likely to be on top of his game, given the day-to-day consistency of his level back then (he's definitely more prone to upset and having off-days now than he was then).   I do agree that Federer today on one of his best days would give 2006 a good run with his improved tennis intelligence, experienced, improved serving, and his modified aggressive net game."
tennis,3cn7kw,iCW_Phoenix,0,Thu Jul 9 22:44:35 2015 UTC,"There is no counter-evidence. None whatsoever.   People think because Federer managed to contend after declining that that means he didn't decline. It's so hilarious. Meanwhile, their idol Pete Sampras (virtually every single Federer hater in the world is a Samprastard...that's where they all originate from...90% of Nadal's fanbase and 99.99% of the ""weak era"" spewers are Samprastards who root against Federer because they hated Federer making Sampras look bad by comparison) was somehow allowed to be past his prime in 1998 with no questions asked.  Federer is totally cool to lose fair and square to Tsonga at Wimbledon in 2011, turning 30 in August, but poor Pete's 2001 loss to baby Federer at Wimbledon is MEANINGLESS, despite being almost exactly the same age then as Federer was in 2011 Wimbledon (actually 4 days younger than Federer)."
tennis,3cn7kw,Jobin1616,10,Thu Jul 9 14:04:56 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this can translate to a win over Murray and Nole/Gasquet. I like Murray and would love to see him win another slam, but damn #18 would just be so special. Also he would pass Sampras for most Wimbledon titles. I want to see it so bad."
tennis,3cn7kw,Nitro_R,3,Thu Jul 9 06:24:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, all this means is that he's serving better. You looked almost entirely at serve stats. I'm sure if you were able to analyze more return stats, winners/unforced errors, forehand winners, and backhand winners, you'd see that he was a much more complete player in the other years that he won the title. Federer is obviously a totally different player than he was years ago. He doesn't allow himself into long rallies, as his groundstrokes aren't quite what they once were. I really want Federer to win this title and I think he can, but I think it's a bit unreasonable to assume Federer's all around game is better now than during his prime, based on very few statistics."

tennis,3ckzkw,red_280,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:07:48 2015 UTC,"Totally agree here, lots of random errors from Wawrinka.   Sometimes you get matches where both people start out hot and keep playing better and better, like Nadal-Verdasco at the AUOpen in 2009. Wawrinka-Gasquet was not the case, it's frustrating knowing how well Wawrinka can really play and watching him lose focus."

French Open and Australia Open go best of 3 sets in men doubles and mixed doubles have a special tie-break with first to ten points to win (with the +2 points rules like a normal tie-break).

tennis,3cmhhj,daftroses,5,Fri Jul 10 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"i was surprised with gasquet when he handled dimitrov so easily. kyrgios was more expected but i was nervous during the 4th. but the way he kept his cool in the 4th and then subsequent 5th was something i've never seen in him. i've watched him for like the last 10 years and he wasn't the most stable player and his lack of a power forehand/serve made ti hard for him to compete against the bigger names but his defense is so good right now and his mental game is so strong. i really dont' like hyperbole but this might have been the greatest match of his life. you can see players like murray and djo get irritated with their match ups with big servers wear on them mentally but he just grinded his teeth (literally) and went to work. so happy for him, i'm hoping for a richard/roger final. ALLEZ   btw i picked up on a few of his superstitions. he doesn't always do the regripping but he's the only person i've seen that does it, kind of quirky and i love that. the ball thing is common but for those that don't know, if he wins a point, he will always use that ball again and then what i foudn hilarious is that the ball kind will give him a ball and he'll bounce it a few times and then hit it back and then the opposite ball kid will do the same and he'll do the same, it's completely unnecessary but so funny. also when he's returning serve, he'll tap his racquet 4 times. outside the baseline, inside the baseline, outside the singles court sideline but inside the baseline and then outside the singles court sideline but outside the baseline. it's so quirky. this match really was 50/50 at the 5th set, i thought he might lose it after not holding his serve at 5-3, but damn his mental game was so strong."

tennis,3cn7ql,reedsparks,2,Thu Jul 9 05:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yes it would be more of a shocker. Cilic was playing so well towards the end of the US Open, I didn't think anyone could beat him the way he was playing. He destroyed Federer in the semifinals and then he had Nishikori in the final and not Djokovic. It was impressive without a doubt, but if Gasquet can somehow beat Djokovic (which I personally don't think he will, but hope he does) then he has to face either Federer or Murray in the final. He would have had to beat 3 of the top 4 seeds just to win the championship (Wawrinka, Djokovic, Fed/Murray). That would be a much more impressive run."
tennis,3cn7ql,gogetakame,2,Thu Jul 9 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, while Gasquet winning Wimbledon would indeed be a shocker, I wouldn't say that it would be a complete shocker like Cilic winning the US Open. I think it's already been established that Gasquet is an immense bundle of talent, and while I don't want to discount Cilic as a tennis player, his skills are quite a bit more limited. As many have stated here, Cilic kinda ""blacked out"" and players at an absolutely insane level during the latter parts of last year's US Open. With Gasquet, he has flashes of brilliance, but I've always believed that Gasquet's biggest weakness is his reluctance at times to be aggressive and actively attack the ball. I'm not seeing that this year, Richard has been quite insanely aggressive whenever he had the opportunity all throughout the tournament.  Now, I'm not saying that Gasquet is absolutely going to win, he still has to go through the Terminator that is Novak Djokovic, and even if he beats Novak, he will need to take on either Murray or Federer, both of whom are prodigal grasscourt players. But don't discount Richard Gasquet, he could be potentially dangerous."

tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,26,Wed Jul 8 18:57:46 2015 UTC,OF COURSE BACKHAND SLICE INTO THE NET. OF COURSE. DAMMIT STAN THINK OF MY BLADDER.
tennis,3ck3li,IAmNotASkycap,26,Wed Jul 8 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"I love Stan but this 5th set has definitely made me a Gasquet fan, too. He's showing a lot of heart."
tennis,3ck3li,tramplemousse,11,Wed Jul 8 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"He's so exciting, I love how he moves around the court and keeps shots in play most players can barely touch."
tennis,3ck3li,Rac3318,6,Wed Jul 8 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"When Gasquet really wants to play it is a thing of beauty. Most of his career he's been haunted by tennis pundits accusing him of just playing for a paycheck, but today he played his heart out. Gotta love it."
tennis,3ck3li,red_280,25,Wed Jul 8 20:29:43 2015 UTC,Stanislam Wawrinkles vs Reechar Gas Can. Who will prevail in the battle of the single-handed backhands?
tennis,3ck3li,binks21,25,Wed Jul 8 15:11:54 2015 UTC,does gasquet regrip his racquet at every changeover?  edit : and again! is this normal?
tennis,3ck3li,avocadosandham,9,Wed Jul 8 17:52:51 2015 UTC,Gotta figure he is trying to get in wawrinka's head
tennis,3ck3li,BimbelMarley,7,Wed Jul 8 18:05:01 2015 UTC,He regrips extremely often because his palms sweat a lot.
tennis,3ck3li,Rac3318,5,Wed Jul 8 20:22:09 2015 UTC,It's one of his rituals. He changes rackets very often and on the changeover he puts half a grip over the existing grip. He's been doing that for as long as I can remember watching him play and he's been on tour for 12 years now I believe.
tennis,3ck3li,bustedracquet,23,Wed Jul 8 20:27:32 2015 UTC,The 5th set has taken this match from good to great. Ridiculous shotmaking quality and court coverage.
tennis,3ck3li,pianodeliverylady,19,Wed Jul 8 18:32:09 2015 UTC,These backhand exchanges... drool
tennis,3ck3li,TravisJLM,20,Wed Jul 8 17:44:30 2015 UTC,For those watching on the BBC: is it just me or is Peter Fleming getting a bit exasperated with John Inverdale? (I would be too)
tennis,3ck3li,cuntarsetits,15,Wed Jul 8 18:31:06 2015 UTC,I think he spoke for us all when he effectively told Inverdale to STFU.
tennis,3ck3li,TravisJLM,6,Wed Jul 8 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"I know. I'm baffled why they've stuck Inverdale in a commentary role. Literally anyone else that the BBC have employed would be better. He was actually not too bad on the evening show, even though he always looks a bit miserable."
tennis,3ck3li,Valinor_,3,Wed Jul 8 18:34:49 2015 UTC,What did he say to Inverdale?
tennis,3ck3li,DeltaStorm,8,Thu Jul 9 00:25:06 2015 UTC,"Thought this the other day when they were commentating on the Gasquet/Kyrgios match too. Inverdale said something along the lines of 'don't you think the foot fault rule is a bit archaic?' and Fleming just asked him 'why?'. Then, nothing. Such an insightful discussion."
tennis,3ck3li,Average_Pimpin,3,Wed Jul 8 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"I noticed that as well! He shoots down Inverdale like he's a child or something. It's kind of patronizing I mean come on wouldn't take long to explain your point, at least humour him a bit for us at home"
tennis,3ck3li,soxandpatriots1,6,Wed Jul 8 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely. This is also my first time watching the tournament on the BBC, and I'm not too impressed with this commentating duo."
tennis,3ck3li,TravisJLM,4,Wed Jul 8 18:34:05 2015 UTC,"It's a shame you're getting that impression, Roddick commentated with Andrew Castle on the Djokovic match and that combo was superb. Roddick is my new favourite pundit, actually - some great stuff in the studio earlier in the day."
tennis,3ck3li,soxandpatriots1,3,Wed Jul 8 18:36:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's really just Inverdale. Judging from this match, I'm not really a fan of his, and the apparent awkwardness between him and Fleming doesn't make for a great listening experience. I also heard that Roddick was pretty insightful, so hopefully I'll be able to get that in a future match."
tennis,3ck3li,TravisJLM,6,Wed Jul 8 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"Inverdale has been involved in a number of controversies in the past which doesn't exactly make him the most likeable to begin with. From calling Marion Bartoli ""not a looker"" a few years ago and then having a massive faux pas on radio by using the term ""rose cunted spectacles"" (when he meant tinted, obviously). I mean he must be somewhat knowledgeable but he's nowhere near the class of the others the BBC have. His timing with some of the things he says isn't that great either. And yes, Roddick's studio bits were the most impressive for me. Good sense of humour, insightful, seemed like he had good chemistry with the other presenters, etc. Even the odd chat in commentary about how his life is going after retirement, seemed genuine and not forced."
tennis,3ck3li,Rac3318,3,Wed Jul 8 18:45:16 2015 UTC,What was John Iverdale saying this time? He has a tendency to get on a lot of commentator's nerves.
tennis,3ck3li,TravisJLM,5,Wed Jul 8 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"His timing with some of his quotes wasn't good. Fleming was like ""let's sit back and watch it""."
tennis,3ck3li,PheromoneCvlt,4,Wed Jul 8 20:37:23 2015 UTC,It's fine - They're both bloody annoying in their own way
tennis,3ck3li,loeblich,37,Wed Jul 8 18:32:30 2015 UTC,"Well, it was too early, he's working toward the Wawrinka-slam. 2014 Aus.open 2015 French open 2016 Wimbledon 2017 US open  Although probably achieved by others before."
tennis,3ck3li,painfive,8,Wed Jul 8 19:09:36 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been achieved as far as I can tell.  The closest was Federer from 04 to 07, who would have got it if he won the 05 French (lost in the semis to Nadal).  Also, before the open era, Fred Perry would have got it if he won the 1937 US open (he turned pro in 37 and so didn't play in the opens after this)."
tennis,3ck3li,loeblich,5,Wed Jul 8 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"thanks for the research, good to know"
tennis,3ck3li,BlatantFix,19,Wed Jul 8 20:15:19 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be an important Gasquet match without a choke...
tennis,3ck3li,sriranjant,48,Wed Jul 8 18:18:12 2015 UTC,"Expecting this to be the best QF of the lot.      Highest potential for upset, and highest potential for STANIMAL BEAST MODE."
tennis,3ck3li,red_280,2,Wed Jul 8 15:11:27 2015 UTC,"I'm hyped, alright. Not sure if I have the heart to stay up for the whole thing though in my timezone."
tennis,3ck3li,Personacorona,2,Wed Jul 8 15:13:22 2015 UTC,You have to stay up? Do you live in Australia?
tennis,3ck3li,red_280,6,Wed Jul 8 15:48:35 2015 UTC,Unfortunately so.
tennis,3ck3li,nirtak,46,Wed Jul 8 15:50:24 2015 UTC,Gasquet deserved his win today. Congrats. What fucking pisses me off is that he will go on and lose  6-4 6-4 6-2 to Djokovic.   A Stan-Nole semi would have been much more entertaining.
tennis,3ck3li,abuttfarting,22,Wed Jul 8 19:03:23 2015 UTC,"A true testament to Djokovic' skill: He was able to beat Marin Cilic in straight sets, then go on to win the Wawrinka - Gasquet match only hours later."
tennis,3ck3li,Jzrt10,20,Wed Jul 8 19:47:10 2015 UTC,This. Djokovic will probably win the match in less than 2 hours. Gasquet has nothing that can threaten Djokovic. Gasquet is only going to win if Djokovic has a complete mental breakdown.
tennis,3ck3li,TareXmd,16,Wed Jul 8 19:11:10 2015 UTC,"That might be true. That said, if Stan couldn't overcome Gasquet, then he most likely would lose badly to Djokovic as well. It would have been interesting as some sort of ""revenge"" for RG."
tennis,3ck3li,ragedlion,17,Wed Jul 8 19:05:46 2015 UTC,Highly doubt it. I think Stan matches up better against Djokovic. Plus Stan only played Gasquet a few times before this match.
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,14,Wed Jul 8 19:19:01 2015 UTC,Stan has a much higher ceiling. Which you need when playing Robo Novak.
tennis,3ck3li,sirmackerel,6,Wed Jul 8 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed, he played a riveting match today but Djokovic is a horrible matchup for him.  I can't see Djokovic dropping a set against him."
tennis,3ck3li,emaG_eh7,29,Wed Jul 8 19:04:52 2015 UTC,Djokovic is probably as happy as Gasquet that he won.
tennis,3ck3li,missscottfraser,39,Wed Jul 8 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"""Warwrinka points to his head but Gasquet points to his heart"" - Andrew Castle's commentary really is dire."
tennis,3ck3li,beepbloopbloop,18,Wed Jul 8 18:25:36 2015 UTC,Scientists say we only use 10% of our brains. I say we only use 10% of our balls.
tennis,3ck3li,cuntarsetits,14,Wed Jul 8 18:45:34 2015 UTC,That's Inverdale. Should be pensioned off.
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,14,Wed Jul 8 18:28:11 2015 UTC,What the fuck is Wawrinka doing on return of serve. These two are going to be destroyed by Djokovic on this form
tennis,3ck3li,BennyUK7,14,Wed Jul 8 17:45:16 2015 UTC,These backhand rallies are orgasmic. Just what we want to see!
tennis,3ck3li,SirSpitfire,12,Wed Jul 8 18:52:21 2015 UTC,Bien joué Gasquet!!
tennis,3ck3li,fregebombs,10,Wed Jul 8 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"Goodness, Gasquet's backhand. A thing of beauty."
tennis,3ck3li,TravisJLM,11,Wed Jul 8 18:32:42 2015 UTC,Gasquet is playing the most solid match I've seen in years from him.
tennis,3ck3li,Tyrus84,11,Wed Jul 8 18:56:38 2015 UTC,This match really became a thing of beauty! Loving these late round 5 setters.
tennis,3ck3li,PheromoneCvlt,8,Wed Jul 8 18:41:23 2015 UTC,AYYYYY GASGOAT
tennis,3ck3li,mutt1917,11,Wed Jul 8 18:57:45 2015 UTC,Boy was that a stunning performance. On both sides.
tennis,3ck3li,rafessi,8,Wed Jul 8 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"Stan misfiring from all ends, safe to say he's a bit nervous, one must remember that he has never made the semis here..."
tennis,3ck3li,ForensicShoe,8,Wed Jul 8 15:53:07 2015 UTC,Misfiring from both ends? So that's why he went on a toilet break...
tennis,3ck3li,bustedracquet,8,Wed Jul 8 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"These backhands are unreal. As a neutral party please engage in more ""who can hit the more ridiculous backhand angle"" duels."
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,9,Wed Jul 8 17:44:33 2015 UTC,There it is. Stan's returns are begging for serve and volley. He's shooting himself in the foot. Absolutely horrid from 0-30.
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,7,Wed Jul 8 18:25:21 2015 UTC,Gasquet has some interesting faces when redoing his grip.
tennis,3ck3li,PheromoneCvlt,7,Wed Jul 8 18:38:30 2015 UTC,Fucking hell. Gasquet is getting everything in. It's Djoc / Murray-eqsue
tennis,3ck3li,btaz,8,Wed Jul 8 18:49:38 2015 UTC,I expected Gasquet to give some trouble to Stan but I did not expect him to fight this hard. Mad props to Gasquet - I did not expect him to dig this deep - especially in the fifth set.
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,7,Wed Jul 8 18:53:16 2015 UTC,Could there be a more fitting way to end the match?
tennis,3ck3li,frozen-creek,9,Wed Jul 8 18:57:23 2015 UTC,Incredible match.
tennis,3ck3li,TheHardWorkingIngo,8,Wed Jul 8 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe not the highest quality, but that was the most entertaining match of the championship so far for me."
tennis,3ck3li,binks21,15,Wed Jul 8 18:59:33 2015 UTC,Djokovic must surely be hoping Gasquet takes this
tennis,3ck3li,itsmekathy,10,Wed Jul 8 18:23:30 2015 UTC,"On one hand, I admire how much Gasquet really seems to want this, but I think Stan would give Djokovic a better match in the semis. I'm torn."
tennis,3ck3li,dannhash,7,Wed Jul 8 18:27:20 2015 UTC,Imagine if gasquet had a wawrinka-esque renaissance
tennis,3ck3li,MoreDblRainbows,4,Wed Jul 8 15:56:55 2015 UTC,I'd be so happy. I remember all the way back when he was with Golovin and the next big thing.
tennis,3ck3li,bonoboboy,8,Wed Jul 8 16:00:29 2015 UTC,"And with that, every player has lost at least a set this Wimbledon."
tennis,3ck3li,rafessi,5,Wed Jul 8 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"Gasquet is totally and utterly engaged in this, he wants it badly... Don't get the same feeling from Stan at the moment"
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,6,Wed Jul 8 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"""You can't get two bites at the cherry"", but lines people can miss obvious calls?"
tennis,3ck3li,rafessi,8,Wed Jul 8 18:32:12 2015 UTC,And the quality of this match has gone up several notches in this last set
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,3,Wed Jul 8 18:46:36 2015 UTC,I can't tell if it's the tennis or the drama. There's been some amazing rallies but also some really poor errors.
tennis,3ck3li,cuntarsetits,7,Wed Jul 8 18:48:17 2015 UTC,SHUT UP INVERDALE YOU MONUMENTAL COCK
tennis,3ck3li,mathen,4,Wed Jul 8 18:46:50 2015 UTC,"Please Peter Fleming, could you comment for the 10th time about Gasquet regripping his racquet every change of ends? I don't think we've bored the audience to tears yet"
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,5,Wed Jul 8 18:48:33 2015 UTC,Who was serving first again? They haven't been clear enough on that.
tennis,3ck3li,soxandpatriots1,7,Wed Jul 8 18:50:04 2015 UTC,Triple match/break point!
tennis,3ck3li,czgsmind,7,Wed Jul 8 18:55:45 2015 UTC,Stan you need to unleash the animal NOW!  Edit: At least I still got fed....
tennis,3ck3li,GinGimlet,8,Wed Jul 8 18:55:57 2015 UTC,"Congrats to Gasquet though, I just really wanted to see a Nole/Wawrinka rematch"
tennis,3ck3li,BourgeoisGanglia,8,Wed Jul 8 18:58:16 2015 UTC,As a long time Gasquet fan this was really satisfying but I'm worried about what lies ahead. Bon courage Richard!
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,7,Wed Jul 8 19:18:42 2015 UTC,Also why not serve and volley over and over against Stan? His returns are awful. They're slow and float high.
tennis,3ck3li,coopermanning,6,Wed Jul 8 17:41:02 2015 UTC,"jesus, that backhand rally was sex"
tennis,3ck3li,rafessi,6,Wed Jul 8 17:44:46 2015 UTC,Both players saving their A games for their service games...
tennis,3ck3li,MoreDblRainbows,5,Wed Jul 8 18:31:53 2015 UTC,Awesome breaking back for Gasquet! I thought he was going to get rolled over this set
tennis,3ck3li,Cyberfire,6,Wed Jul 8 16:18:16 2015 UTC,MY BALLS CAN'T TAKE THIS
tennis,3ck3li,scoobeee,5,Wed Jul 8 18:16:19 2015 UTC,What is the rule on contesting a call? Stan can't swing and still contest it?
tennis,3ck3li,Beforehand87,8,Wed Jul 8 18:31:55 2015 UTC,You can't play the ball then challenge that it was out.
tennis,3ck3li,godlesshero,4,Wed Jul 8 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"Yes you can. You are allowed to hit the ball back, but you must stop after that. If you continue playing the point then you cannot ask for a challenge once the point is over."
tennis,3ck3li,Beforehand87,3,Wed Jul 8 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"I would argue that doesn't constitute ""playing the ball"", but perhaps it's poor phrasing on my end."
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,5,Wed Jul 8 18:39:49 2015 UTC,Gasquet must be so thankful he won't have to try serving for the match again.
tennis,3ck3li,spencersss,7,Wed Jul 8 18:39:47 2015 UTC,I really had to laugh when it became 30-40 and the guy with the big red hat was standing in front of the camera. Classic
tennis,3ck3li,binks21,5,Wed Jul 8 18:51:35 2015 UTC,dammit Stan!
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,3,Wed Jul 8 18:55:51 2015 UTC,This happened earlier. Gasquet will get the last one.
tennis,3ck3li,Krakaka1095,3,Wed Jul 8 18:56:44 2015 UTC,are you a wizard
tennis,3ck3li,draconis228,4,Wed Jul 8 18:58:29 2015 UTC,Sigh
tennis,3ck3li,frundock,5,Wed Jul 8 18:57:33 2015 UTC,Well done Mr. Gasquet! Well deserved and wish you luck in the semi-finals!
tennis,3ck3li,TravisJLM,13,Wed Jul 8 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"Shame because I think Stan would give Novak a better game, plus it's a rematch from the French Open, but what a tournament for Gasquet. Completely deserved."
tennis,3ck3li,red_280,4,Wed Jul 8 18:58:20 2015 UTC,We got one 'allez' and one bear face.
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,4,Wed Jul 8 16:51:46 2015 UTC,The angles....
tennis,3ck3li,itsmekathy,4,Wed Jul 8 17:43:56 2015 UTC,I don't think Djokovic will be too worried looking at either of these two.
tennis,3ck3li,PheromoneCvlt,4,Wed Jul 8 18:07:17 2015 UTC,COME ON GASQUET
tennis,3ck3li,MoreDblRainbows,4,Wed Jul 8 18:11:45 2015 UTC,Allez Richard!

tennis,3ck3li,missscottfraser,4,Wed Jul 8 18:17:02 2015 UTC,This match is too good.
tennis,3ck3li,Gumpster07,4,Wed Jul 8 18:17:12 2015 UTC,This match is amazing!  Such drama in this final set. Loving it!
tennis,3ck3li,tropicalphysics,5,Wed Jul 8 18:26:43 2015 UTC,Don't hit poor Richard!
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,4,Wed Jul 8 18:43:05 2015 UTC,Three backhand errors in the first game you got a few returns back. Nice work Stan!
tennis,3ck3li,tramplemousse,5,Wed Jul 8 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"Inconsistency be damned, I love watching Gasquet play."
tennis,3ck3li,rafessi,3,Wed Jul 8 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"Clutch play from Gasquet, he's not going anywhere yet..."
tennis,3ck3li,bustedracquet,4,Wed Jul 8 18:52:47 2015 UTC,That would have been the worst way to end the match if that net cord had gone over. Phew.

tennis,3ck3li,Wigley123,3,Wed Jul 8 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"Although I'm not sure about Richards chances against Nole, his forehand was better today than I've seen it in a long time. And with his backhand, maybe he can make it a match."
tennis,3ck3li,engineer-in-a-rut,4,Wed Jul 8 18:59:21 2015 UTC,"That was an amazing match. After that effort, I hope that Gasquet is able to put up a good fight against Novak. Don't know if that's going to happen given his serve. Would feel kinda bad for him if he got crushed but that's how professional sports works, I guess."
tennis,3ck3li,CockroachClitoris,12,Wed Jul 8 19:05:01 2015 UTC,Guys I have a great pun I just invented. Stan rhymes with man. So like you can say Stan the Man! Please forward to your friends and give me credit I invented it thanks.

tennis,3ck3li,MoreDblRainbows,3,Wed Jul 8 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"Not great tennis, but great to see such heart from Gasquet. He has got to stop getting in trouble on his serve early in these sets though."

tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,2,Wed Jul 8 16:36:05 2015 UTC,Stan has been awful. Amazing he's managing to almost be up 2-1.
tennis,3ck3li,soxandpatriots1,2,Wed Jul 8 16:59:55 2015 UTC,Stan returns the favor that Gasquet did him at the end of the previous set
tennis,3ck3li,mhaydar,2,Wed Jul 8 17:34:16 2015 UTC,Do they provide special extra durable balls when Stan plays?
tennis,3ck3li,hungry4danish,2,Wed Jul 8 17:35:05 2015 UTC,I can go months between grip changes. Gasquet has done two in the past 6 minutes.
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,2,Wed Jul 8 17:37:17 2015 UTC,Stan must be easily the worst return of serve in the top 20. My god
tennis,3ck3li,blekginger,2,Wed Jul 8 17:42:40 2015 UTC,Maybe on grass. His returns at the French were excellent.
tennis,3ck3li,juiceson,2,Wed Jul 8 17:43:27 2015 UTC,Oh just stop it
tennis,3ck3li,MoreDblRainbows,2,Wed Jul 8 17:43:52 2015 UTC,If Gasquet takes this he is going to fly up the rankings (he already will) and he doesn't have many summer points to defend either.
tennis,3ck3li,zachkerr,2,Wed Jul 8 18:05:28 2015 UTC,Stan blowing this with unforced errors would be extremely fitting.

tennis,3cly9p,flat_tamales,23,Wed Jul 8 23:01:59 2015 UTC,He's brutally honest and he's absolutely right.
tennis,3cly9p,MCallanan,11,Thu Jul 9 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"17-2 is not a rivalry. A lot of people view them as rivals though because of that Wimbledon final, and because of being the two highest paid female athletes, and because they both are divas, and they both are loud on the court, and they're both hard-hitters, and they both wear nike gowns on the court, and all of that Dimitrov drama, and shade being thrown in the interviews.   Patrick Mouratoglou is 100% right and could also be shading Maria after she made that comment last year about him dating Serena. Can't wait for tomorrow's cat fight!"
tennis,3cly9p,sweetmatter,14,Thu Jul 9 03:44:01 2015 UTC,"""It's a rivalry in the same way a blender is a rival with a cabbage"" or something like that"
tennis,3cly9p,Personacorona,5,Thu Jul 9 04:04:31 2015 UTC,There was an article somewhere. Maybe tennis.com. The author was talking about how Serena made Sharapova and all the fame and money that Sharapova gets is because of Serena losing to her at Wimbledon that year. That Serena is not happy about the fact that she makes less money than Sharapova. Let me try to find that link.
tennis,3cly9p,get_go,7,Thu Jul 9 05:14:46 2015 UTC,Sharapova is more marketable and gets more money in the same way that Eugenie Bouchard succeeds.
tennis,3cly9p,red_280,3,Thu Jul 9 07:11:14 2015 UTC,How does Sharapova make more money than Serena? That's crazy
tennis,3cly9p,rimbad,2,Thu Jul 9 12:05:25 2015 UTC,Find it please! I've never heard of that. That would be an interesting read.
tennis,3cly9p,sweetmatter,2,Thu Jul 9 06:34:42 2015 UTC,Here is a non-mobile link: http://nytimes.com/2015/07/08/sports/tennis/former-no-1-victoria-azarenka-is-at-her-best-but-serena-williams-is-even-better.html?referrer=  Sourcecode | Feedback?
tennis,3cly9p,untouchedURL,-4,Wed Jul 8 23:02:48 2015 UTC,Pretty straightforward stuff. Both Sharapova and Williams are talented enough and have been able to perform at their peak potential. Sharapova is thin and willowy. Williams is muscular and built like a truck. There's only so much you can do to counter brute strength from a player who's very good at utilising her brute strength.
tennis,3cly9p,red_280,11,Thu Jul 9 07:09:58 2015 UTC,Uh anyone who thinks that Sharapova doesn't rely almost exclusively on brute strength has never seen her play. What makes Serena so much better than Sharapova (and everyone else) is that she brings much more to the court than just strength.
tennis,3clgle,chief_running_joke,44,Wed Jul 8 20:49:39 2015 UTC,Disappointed in Stan. I wanted another Stan - Djokovic epic 5 setter. Instead we'll get Djokovic rolling past Gasquet in straights.
tennis,3clgle,abuttfarting,15,Wed Jul 8 21:15:58 2015 UTC,"He has a really hard time to find his rhythm on grass. Making it to the quarters two years in a row despite that is well done.  You could see it today and in the last round, when he gets a slow ball that sits up nicely for him like it does on clay and on hardcourt he hammers in a winner most of the time.   As he doesn't get that on grass, he has a really hard time to find his rhythm for an entire match. You could see it in the third set today, he finally found it, but after that it was gone again.   Now, he was extremely close to winning today despite that (had break point at 9-9), but I think Novak would've won rather comfortably on Friday regardless. Probably not as comfortably as he's likely to against Gasquet, but I don't think we would've seen anything as tight as their Aus Open matches, or Stan getting near  the quality he showed in the RG final."
tennis,3clgle,blekginger,13,Wed Jul 8 23:45:59 2015 UTC,Interesting points though I'd put it down to the Wimbledon dress code not allowing him to wear his GOAT shorts.
tennis,3clgle,Fartoholic,8,Thu Jul 9 00:29:37 2015 UTC,"Bloody hell, how did I overlook that."
tennis,3clgle,blekginger,2,Thu Jul 9 01:37:44 2015 UTC,"I mean this respectfully, but I think your analysis is wrong. The slow ball off which he can hammer winners was not something missing that threw him off; the statistics make the perfect counterargument. Stanislas hit 70+ winners today. That is mind-boggling work. Wawrinka played an outstanding match; he just ran into an opponent that played lights out in his own respect and put on a defensive showcase. There wasn't a rally in the latter half of the match in which Gasquet didn't force Wawrinka to string together more than a few good-to-great shots to win the point (some of which he did)."
tennis,3clgle,PessimisticCheer,2,Thu Jul 9 04:54:28 2015 UTC,"True, but in the FO final he hit 60 winners in FOUR sets. He had a great level yesterday too, and he's adapted well to grass, but he STILL doesn't play his absolute best because the surface just doesn't let him."
tennis,3clgle,avic14,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:24:05 2015 UTC,"That is an extraordinary number, yes, but the due to the surface he just couldn't take control of the points regularly as he would've against Gasquet on any other surface. He just was often on the backfoot, and whilist he hit winners a plenty it was really Gasquet who most of the time was in charge of proceedings (Rich was better for most of 2nd set, too, just one poor game made him lose it).  Stan hit more unforced errors than you're used to him doing and he let Rich take control cause he couldn't quite deal with the surface."
tennis,3clgle,blekginger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I went to sleep before seeing the whole match but his backhand just wasn't doing it for him. I noticed that he ran around it quite a bit."
tennis,3clgle,red_280,14,Thu Jul 9 01:16:54 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to say the Gasquet - Wawrinka match, especially the final set, was incredible. They both battled it out and you could see how much they wanted that win. If you didn't get to watch it try and find a replay or something."
tennis,3clgle,Yuanfen91,26,Wed Jul 8 22:49:22 2015 UTC,"It's crazy to me that three of the four semifinalists are the same ones from 2007, with Murray replacing Nadal for the fourth."
tennis,3clgle,Volvulus,27,Wed Jul 8 23:40:17 2015 UTC,Just want to see Fed win another to cement his legacy as the greatest ever..not that its in doubt at the moment.
tennis,3clgle,347ninja,47,Wed Jul 8 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't win it, even if he makes it to the finals, as soon as the match is over I'm sure we'll be seeing the ""Is this it for Federer?  Is his career over?"" .  Seems like every time he doesn't win a tournament people start talking about how he's done with despite the fact that he is still #2 in the world, winning titles and running deep in large tournaments hah."
tennis,3clgle,Whata_Turkey,23,Wed Jul 8 22:27:57 2015 UTC,You know you're good when making Grand Slam finals still isn't enough to silence the critics.
tennis,3clgle,alittlebitfancy,5,Thu Jul 9 01:53:22 2015 UTC,"Spot on, but the sad thing is those people will eventually be right. I can't imagine that after a loss (probably would be in wimbledon) that his career will be truly over"
tennis,3clgle,RogerFedererFTW,2,Thu Jul 9 01:08:26 2015 UTC,Nah he's gonna win Olympic gold and then drop the racquet dramatically.
tennis,3clgle,kamshazam,8,Thu Jul 9 03:37:41 2015 UTC,"Really happy that Richard won, played brilliant tennis whenever he competed but got unlucky last year. However i feel it for him, on Friday it will be different story and Novak would probably beat him in straight sets. Thus, a small part of me wanted Stan to go, but then again, not even Stan would probably be able to contain Novak, especially the way he played vs Richard.  I really hope Richard turns up and gives a match against Novak like Kevin Anderson did and maybe steal a cheeky little win. (Still gutted this dude couldn't finish it off).   On the other hand, i feel like the Federer-Murray game would be a gem, big Roger fan so the support would be inevitable but i know Andy will really take the match deep, to maybe even a 5th set, who knows. BUT if King Federer turns up hot, not straight sets but i'd say a 3-1 for him."
tennis,3clgle,HeelR-,9,Thu Jul 9 00:31:03 2015 UTC,Brilliant results all round.  Djokovic to win
tennis,3clgle,MetalKeirSolid,3,Wed Jul 8 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"Federer vs Murray is the match to watch. I don't really think Federer was tested so far and he may preferred Murray to have been in Djokovic's half because these 3 are the ones who are  clear cut above the rest on this surface. Murray had a couple of slight scares but I don't think he has been pushed really. You could say that the Karlovic match was tough but playing Karlovic really does not tell much - it is a lot on his Karlovic's racquet.   Djokovic's team is probably going ""Lad, it's Gasquet"" right now. I am hoping that Gasquet puts in a tougher fight but I just don't see it happening. Djokovic will return far better than Stan and I don't think Gasquet will have an easy time holding his serve. But then I was expecting Stan to get through (albeit not in straight sets) so anything can happen."

They were my favourites for the title, and the fact that Novak will have a walk in the park and those two may battle hard for 5 sets makes me think Djokovic has now better chance to retain his title on sunday.  Can't wait for friday thought!"

tennis,3clgle,Ibrahimnaldo,2,Thu Jul 9 04:51:58 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, Djokovic is the best player in the world. He is a wonderful tennis machine and I would not consider a person insane for having him as the favourite, he is the number one seed after all. It has to do with gut feeling. Murray and Fed played well in the lead up tournaments, and djoko will surely feel extra pressure in the final since he lost another one recently. He is 1-6 in his last 7 grand slam final I think and showed to be under a lot of pressure. We expect the other 2 to lose to him so I think they could play more freely against him.   And since the semis are so unbalanced, I think the extra pressure on Djokovic will be negated by a much fresher body than his opponent in the final. We'll see on sunday."

I'm genuinely curious :) You may disagree with my opinion, but it's not offtopic/offensive and it does contribute to the discussion. Wawrinka played an average match, while Gasquet had to play some lights out tennis (both defense and offense) in order to beat Stan.

tennis,3cjb6n,TareXmd,11,Wed Jul 8 13:40:29 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he was implying the lack of a good voice. He walks around with a visible microphone so people think he's a singer with a good voice. Ahhh classic Djoker.
tennis,3cjb6n,Personacorona,-1,Wed Jul 8 14:20:08 2015 UTC,You don't laugh that maniacally if you're insulting someone's voice
tennis,3cjb6n,TareXmd,6,Wed Jul 8 15:55:14 2015 UTC,In Eastern Europe insulting someone's voice is to insult the parents that gave him his voice.

tennis,3ck7y5,MarkRosewater,5,Wed Jul 8 17:31:39 2015 UTC,Djokovic should try an underhand serve.

That's where I thought Anderson did well, he went big when the opportunity was there, took risks - but he didn't try to force the play when it wasn't there. I'm sure the fact that Novak underestimated him didn't exactly hurt him either."

tennis,3ck7y5,AHackFraud,7,Wed Jul 8 15:51:44 2015 UTC,In theory you would say grass since he's typically someone who plays relatively defensively and that lends itself to clay IMO
tennis,3ck7y5,Gogogodai,6,Wed Jul 8 15:56:08 2015 UTC,And yet he's won 2 Wimbledons and 0 French Opens. Funny that.
tennis,3ck7y5,AHackFraud,10,Wed Jul 8 16:06:52 2015 UTC,That's why I meant the in theory part. That being said saying grass is his worse surface is like saying return of the Jedi is the worse SW movie

(If you just want it for Wimbledon reasons, it's $7 a month.) He wasn't commentating on the Federer-Simon match. I'm watching the Murray-Pospisil restart right now, and he's not here either. Maybe he's doing the later matches today."
tennis,3cjg2b,Kashmir33,24,Wed Jul 8 14:31:22 2015 UTC,Federer wasn't lying when he said he felt much better coming into Wimbledon this year.

tennis,3cjg2b,PheromoneCvlt,5,Wed Jul 8 12:38:27 2015 UTC,"Simon is another one of my favourite players to watch, the way he hits the ball is so aesthetically pleasing."
tennis,3cjg2b,midairmatthew,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:40:26 2015 UTC,He's super efficient. Usually I don't think of maximum efficiency as being so graceful.

He'd be in the top 10 for the first time since 2009 and Nadal would be outside of the top 10 for the first time since 2005. If Simon wins here and Murray wins the tournament, then Murray would move ahead of Federer to be #2."
tennis,3cjg2b,binks21,8,Wed Jul 8 12:13:23 2015 UTC,Federer drops a service game for the first time in over 110 games?! The commentators were exclaiming at that as though he had lost the match!
tennis,3cjg2b,TustyTargaryen,7,Wed Jul 8 13:54:33 2015 UTC,Finally get a moment at work to watch Fed. Open the stream on my phone and everyone there opens their umbrellas and they suspend the match. God dammit.

tennis,3cjg2b,gregorramza,7,Wed Jul 8 14:25:49 2015 UTC,I catch up the match after 3-0 and Fed is not playing very good compared to his first 4 matches. I hope he will improve.
tennis,3cjg2b,Kashmir33,6,Wed Jul 8 13:24:21 2015 UTC,Fed is just ruthless.
tennis,3cjg2b,Fartoholic,8,Wed Jul 8 14:39:31 2015 UTC,Simon thought he was lucky with that rain delay. Probably wasn't expecting those aces.

tennis,3cjg2b,ThatLiam,6,Wed Jul 8 12:35:32 2015 UTC,Gilles sometimes plays like he's still in the warm-up.

tennis,3cjg2b,dannhash,5,Wed Jul 8 13:25:42 2015 UTC,Same feeling here but I think it's more the fact that he hasn't gotten a chance to get into any rhythm especially with the rain....he was flying before they went off and now he's playing alright
tennis,3cjg2b,Beforehand87,4,Wed Jul 8 13:29:56 2015 UTC,"For not playing at top flight, a potential 63 75 62 (or 64 if he gets silly) win would be outstanding for Roger. Conserving energy too."
tennis,3cjg2b,strike2867,4,Wed Jul 8 15:03:39 2015 UTC,I think he's pissed about that one service game.

tennis,3cjg2b,midairmatthew,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:40:49 2015 UTC,He's not doing either match! I was promised Roddick. Where is he?! Has anyone found him today? He better do one of the later ones.

Which is going to be the closer match?"
tennis,3cjg2b,DoubleDekker,5,Wed Jul 8 11:59:48 2015 UTC,Federer vs Simon. I don't see Pospisil troubling Murray any way.

tennis,3cjg2b,blekginger,5,Wed Jul 8 12:16:47 2015 UTC,Someone complained about the speed of Aga's serve yesterday (72mph). Simon just hit a 78mph second serve...
tennis,3cjg2b,dannhash,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:06:41 2015 UTC,Was that aga's first serve?
tennis,3cjg2b,blekginger,4,Wed Jul 8 13:18:00 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it was her second serve.
tennis,3cjg2b,red_280,3,Wed Jul 8 13:22:11 2015 UTC,Simon doing the unthinkable and playing aggressively.
tennis,3cjg2b,seyakomo,2,Wed Jul 8 13:28:22 2015 UTC,He's been looking a lot more aggressive in general this year (at least the three or so Simon matches I've watched portions of).   Not really helping him today though.

tennis,3cjg2b,reredef,3,Wed Jul 8 14:11:08 2015 UTC,They ought to make some sort of free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.
tennis,3cjg2b,henrax,4,Wed Jul 8 14:14:44 2015 UTC,Someone posted a link saying that the record was Karlovic's with 129 games. If we don't have a solid source to claim that Federer has the record then we shouldn't post it on Wikipedia yet.
tennis,3cjg2b,PenguinWriter,2,Wed Jul 8 14:16:33 2015 UTC,We can just enter it as his personal record/stat. Not as the outright record. :)

tennis,3cjg2b,blekginger,3,Wed Jul 8 14:01:08 2015 UTC,I just gave a spontaneous applause to Simon here in my living room. What a break! To love! Wow.  Roger had only faced two (!) break points in the entire Wimbledon before that.
tennis,3cjg2b,blekginger,2,Wed Jul 8 14:00:07 2015 UTC,And he's broken back :(  I really really wanted this to be competitive.
tennis,3cjg2b,mywifeisalesbian,3,Wed Jul 8 13:55:52 2015 UTC,Just wondering.  Are players allowed to talk to their coaches during a rain delay?
tennis,3cjg2b,AcingCoder,3,Wed Jul 8 13:56:35 2015 UTC,Cruise control now for Federer
tennis,3cjg2b,ThatLiam,5,Wed Jul 8 13:59:56 2015 UTC,Just heard that Federer's faced just 2 break points in the first four rounds. Wow.

tennis,3cjg2b,Itisits,3,Wed Jul 8 12:26:41 2015 UTC,Only on centre court currently. Roof on court 1 should be ready for 2019.
tennis,3cjg2b,blekginger,3,Wed Jul 8 12:34:13 2015 UTC,"As tennis is primarily an outdoor sport, they like to keep the roof off as long as possible. Not to mention the difference in tennis that follows (quicker play with roof on).  So when it's only a short rain break, they keep it off. Besides, it takes 30-40 minutes for the roof to close anyway - shorter than expected rain delay."

tennis,3cjg2b,ClimbRunRide,2,Wed Jul 8 12:09:52 2015 UTC,Is this far from being a record?
tennis,3cjg2b,jleonardbc,2,Wed Jul 8 12:13:46 2015 UTC,It sounds like the record is 111—so Roger could even break the record during the first set here.

tennis,3cjg2b,MCallanan,5,Wed Jul 8 11:47:17 2015 UTC,Simon has been playing some good tennis. His compact groundstrokes have really become a weapon on grass. He's never been known as a big hitter but he's begun hitting a bit heavier that and with the speed of the grass he's become a very dangerous opponent.

tennis,3cjg2b,gregorramza,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:11:12 2015 UTC,I don't know if you agree but Simon is hitting the ball very soft but deep. This causes Fed to make a lot of unforced errors. I am finding this very similar to Murray's style.

I think it helps that he was playing competitively up until quite recently, so he's actually familiar with the style of some of these players and knows what it's like to play them, especially Federer.

tennis,3cjg3e,RobertGriffin3,23,Wed Jul 8 14:52:20 2015 UTC,I agree that the call was bad and I'm rooting for Pospisil. But at the start of Wimbledon it looked like Murray would have to go Nadal-Fed-Djokovic to win. Not sure I'd call it a Mickey Mouse draw.
tennis,3cjg3e,Gogogodai,12,Wed Jul 8 14:57:42 2015 UTC,Tsonga in the 4th round as well. Not Murray's fault they both lost early (not that Karlovic instead of Tsonga is that much of an easy draw on grass anyway).
tennis,3cjg3e,Wearedondraper,-8,Wed Jul 8 14:59:13 2015 UTC,"Well, Nadal hasn't reached QF in three years and in terrible form. So really it was fed-Novak. And since Murray is 3rd seed. It was always going to be that. But he had the easiest path to semis of all the top four.  Last year they pushed his seeding up."
tennis,3cjg3e,Wearedondraper,-13,Wed Jul 8 15:25:24 2015 UTC,"Nadal is in terrible form and hasn't reached Wimbeldon QF in 3 years. Tsonga is a classic choker.  It's a joke of a draw and completely rigged. All the players who have a chance of beating Murray were put in the top half. Dimitrov, nishikori, Kyrgios etc.  Only tough match for him in the half was fed in the semis. And out of the top four you would have given Murray the best chance against him. Wimbeldon is ridiculously corrupt. Typical of the British."

tennis,3cjg3e,abuttfarting,9,Wed Jul 8 14:17:07 2015 UTC,Pascal Maria kind of killed this match with his time violation penalties. It certainly played a part because Murray broke Pospisil both times Maria handed out a warning.
tennis,3cjg3e,Wearedondraper,5,Wed Jul 8 15:33:32 2015 UTC,"Completely destroyed the match. Players often take a little longer after big points, especially as they are waiting for the crowd to settle down.  The rule is there for serial offenders not to interfere in big moments.

tennis,3cjg3e,Beforehand87,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"The one this set was earned by Murray the point before. If Pospisil had served sooner and hit a fault due to being tired, we'd be praising Murray's tactics. Pospisil stalled, and Murray earned the fault a different way."

tennis,3cjg3e,Gogogodai,7,Wed Jul 8 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"His average time during that game was 30 seconds though. Not saying that the time violation on that point was the right decision, but Pospisil was slowing down considerably to recover from the  longer rallies in that game."

His earlier mixtapes and albums are closer to Gambino in covering heartbreak etc. later on its more about him dealing with success but he still keeps it tight lyrically so you empathise with him while still getting hyped.  I'd say what sets him apart is his production choices. In my opinion only ASAP Rocky comes close to the level of the production posse he's built within OVO, Drake is really ""listenable"" for want of a better word."

I mean, I can see, if Maria called at 22 seconds randomly once, but when does leeway end? Just because he's not nailing them to the wall at 21 seconds doesn't mean he shouldn't nail them on points where they take well over 25.

Maybe that it happens on important points rather than unimportant points, but everyone's time goes even further on big points."
tennis,3cjg3e,bonoboboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:27:02 2015 UTC,My point is how much of a difference does it really make even if they take 10-15 seconds extra? Especially if they are quick enough on other points that their average time is 25s
tennis,3cjg3e,Beforehand87,2,Wed Jul 8 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"OK. I see your point, but it is the rule, and I don't see why they should be allowed to break it (especially to the extent it was broken on the point he was called for) because they were fast on other points. The rule is 20 seconds, so an average of 25 seconds shows that they're only usually breaking the rule a little."

tennis,3co00d,thewalltablet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:45:35 2015 UTC,"Several reasons.  First, it disguises the sound a ball makes off the strings, which can be valuable information to an opponent.    Second, it gets the whole body involved, and has been shown to slightly increase the power of shots.  Studies have shown a 4% increase in power when a player grunts.      Also, it is a mental distraction for the opponent.    Simply put, it works: http://regressing.deadspin.com/why-do-tennis-players-grunt-because-it-works-1597557402"

tennis,3co00d,Aurua,0,Thu Jul 9 12:58:21 2015 UTC,"A grunt resulting from exerting a large amount of force is fine with me, for example, Djokovic or Murray late in a match grunting while hitting the ball hard, or Nadal just being Nadal and hitting the ball as hard as he can.  Then there's the grunts that are a bit delayed, like Ferrer's extended grunt, Kyrgios' moan-like grunt that comes a bit after hitting or Stan's little delayed grunt. A bit unnecessary, but is probably just something that happens along with exhaling after hitting, so that's alright.  However, if the grunt seems like it takes more effort than the stroke itself, like Sharapova screaming on a forehand, hell, on a slice, even, that's when it gets a but ridiculous."

tennis,3ck7ui,startinup,3,Wed Jul 8 16:17:52 2015 UTC,"Just focus on the basics of movement and form. Make sure they pivot before moving to the ball and swing from low to high. Have them hit from the service line so that they don't just keep hitting into the net. Make sure they are swinging smoothly and following through on their shots.  One drill that I like to do with younger kids or beginners is this.  Have them start where it says to and toss balls to each of the numbered locations in order with the numbers being the desired contact points. The last ball is further away than the others because it is usually on the run which is more of a challenge and more fun, but you can start out with the ball closer in the beginning. You can make it four balls if they are having trouble with movement and you can do the same drill for backhands but in reverse.  You can also do almost the same thing for volleys, start them off very close to the net and have them hit volleys with an eastern grip. For volleys just focus on punching the ball and keeping the racket head angle the same instead of swinging through the ball. As their volleys get better have them move back a little bit.  Keep the mood light and be energetic. Don't worry about them missing shots, beginners are some of the most frustrating students because you want them to succeed, but you'll be able to see progress. Just have them focus on the correct form and not worry too much about if the ball is out or hits the net yet.  Have fun!"

tennis,3cm52u,Sebastien447,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:08:22 2015 UTC,"I actually think it's a smart decision.  He's not playing a heavy load first of all... just 7 junior events this year.  But he's risen out of the shadow of Tiafoe/Kozlov/Mmoh and is seen by many now as a Name To Know now.  He's the world #1, Brad Gilbert is talking about him, he's Federer's practice partner.  I gotta think getting people believing he could be a star is a helpful thing for his confidence, and I haven't seen anyone put the same pressure on him as I've seen with Tiafoe/Kozlov.  And also, I think it's a good idea in general when you're playing a lot of matches.  He's only won 2/7 junior events so it's not like he's thrashing the field, but he's consistently going deep.  Compare that to a Kozlov or Donaldson who have been entering events well above their ranking and losing early and often lately.  I think you could make the argument that Fritz could be playing a bit more Futures events, but I don't think the junior schedule has hurt him."
tennis,3cm52u,Sebastien447,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"He's thrashing everyone at Wimbledon, might get a decent match or 2 ... and that's probably due to him playing down to the competition.

Djokovic later said he talked to the girl (I believe he said it was a girl) and apologized, but maintained that he did note in fact yell at her, but was just venting his frustration. Given how shitty this video is at showing context, I am inclined to believe him - if the context was more damning, you know the British media would show it. He also claimed one news outlet was trying to manufacture a scandal.   Regarding the media, they seem to be particularly bad this year - first Djokovic and coaching, then Berdych's question, then the whole grunting thing which ended with Serena flat out refusing to answer the shitty question."

tennis,3chf5r,Personacorona,3,Wed Jul 8 03:42:13 2015 UTC,Djokovic in 4.  Murray in 3.  Simon in 4. I think we will see the return of Federror as the counterpuncher Simon wears him down.  Gasquet in 5. Wawrinka has to have an off match sometime and I think this will be it.

There's definitely a chance of that happening, but what annoys me about these sort of upset-ish outcomes is that a player like Gasquet has next to no chance of going all the way - he's going to get creamed by Djokovic. Wawrinka might suck on grass but he's got the high-stakes mentality, when he can find it, to quite possibly carry him through to the end."

But what can she actually, realistically do that's within her capabilities, to stand more of a chance?    concentrate on making Serena get involved in longer rallies early on, instead of being so hit and miss. Serena takes a while to warm up and Maria could get out to a lead mix up pace and spin to disrupt Serena's rhythm serve un-fucking-believably  not get Serena angry with her stupid screaming and antics. It never ends well for her    And the number 1, only realistic thing she can do:  -pray that Serena plays the worst tennis she has played since the 80s.  The matchup is so bad for Maria in basically every way.   Maria's game is based on hard, flat, aggressive hitting to the lines relentlessly. Well, Serena does that much better, and much more consistently too because her shots have a higher margin for error.   Maria's mental strength is pretty impressive. But Serena's is more impressive.   Maria has a good, if inconsistent, serve. Serena has the greatest serve ever.   Maria is a fantastic returner that gets her opponents on the defense straight away. Serena blasts winners off serves with alarming regularity.   Serena has so many extra talents. She's got much more of a Plan B/C/D game. Maria really never changes her plan - hit hard, harder, harder. If that doesn't work - hit harder. Serena can get things done in so many different ways, and with much more margin for error.   Also, Serena's net game is much better - Maria hardly has one.   Despite everything, I think Serena does respect Maria's game, which is why she takes their matches more seriously and rarely looks off. It's just bad luck for Maria that Serena does everything better.   She can win, but it's just very unlikely."

tennis,3ci2t1,MoreDblRainbows,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:58:23 2015 UTC,"Sharapova's serve was more of a weapon back then, and her ground strokes were a lot quicker. Since her surgery, she has retooled her game with longer ground strokes, which is why she has the time to set up on clay but not on grass. Serena has picked up on that and consistently takes time away from Maria.  Serena also did not have as good of a game back then. Her serve now is pretty much invincible, and everything about her tennis has improved (ground strokes, net game, etc). What Maria did in 2004 was a star making performance. Everything aligned. Serena was a bit off, and Maria played lights out."
tennis,3ci2t1,HausofKungFuDojos,2,Wed Jul 8 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"Those first two things, especially the second, are in opposition to her her natural playing style though. She's not the kind of player who mixes in off-pace shots, or plays with that much variety. She has a good drop shot that's effective against a lot of players, and she can (and probably will) mix that in, but that's just not enough against Serena Williams."

Serena takes a while to warm up and Maria could get out to a lead   This might work but I could also see Serena running her ragged.    mix up pace and spin to disrupt Serena's rhythm   I think she would if she could, I've ever seen her hit with much topspin and her slice is pretty bad.    serve un-fucking-believably   Yes, 100%. That serve percentage needs to be in the high 70s. She also needs to try and get a jump on Serena's second serve (if she gets a look at many)   not get Serena angry   Thats for damn sure. The best case for Maria is if she can kinda lull Serena into something like a 6-4  first set. And then try to blitz her in the second."

Probably not until near the end.  Is federer vs some nobody going to 5 in the first round? Probably not.   I go to the US open frequently in the early rounds when there's tons of matches.

Not that there's anything wrong with posting it, but I feel other news stories should get some notability over that.

tennis,3cfiuj,kuyakew,11,Tue Jul 7 19:03:31 2015 UTC,I'm sure Roger identifies to a degree. Young Roger had terrible body language and mood swings before he turned on GOAT-mode. Still what Nick did was a lot worse.

But it was one game. jeez, it's not like quit the match or got immediately swept. Djokovic was notorious for giving up sets if he was down a double break early on in his career because his mentality was, let's just get on with business, and it didn't receive no where near as much attention as this.  Get over it! Kyrgios took the third and frankly should have taken the fourth. He played his heart out that match and people want to bitch and moan over one game?

tennis,3cfiuj,redditlastnight,6,Tue Jul 7 21:57:29 2015 UTC,"I listened to Bill Burr's Monday Morning Podcast and he was recanting  about his experience there at the French Open finals.  He wasn't enjoying but couldn't pin point why until he realized he didn't like the tennis crowd.  In particular, he disliked the crowd when they booed Nole did when he smashed his racket.  And also when they booed Stan when he smacked the net with his racket.  He goes on a funny rant about the wealthy, snobby, elitism that the tennis crowd draws.  ""Like those rich snobs haven't hurled something across the room when their stock portfolio dropped"" (paraphrasing here).  At Wimbledon the crowd even booed Roger just for swiping an out of play ball into the net. Like we haven't done that. Imagine how we act when we are on court. We're not disrespecting the game, the opponent or the opposing player. (If anything, it's ourselves).  I think Bill's right.  I love it when the athletes wear their heart on their sleeve (without disrespecting anyone).  I think the crowds do create the typical (and what some would call boring) tennis players (robotic and unemotional). Almost scripted players. We need them to be themselves. Part of watching tennis is to watch the characters that play tennis and to watch how the game unfolds."

tennis,3cfiuj,Hizenboig,3,Tue Jul 7 16:11:00 2015 UTC,"Plus, it's all very well Roger saying that, but the guy denied that he was tanking. I feel it's more the way Kyrgios handled the whole situation and his attitude that was the bigger issue. I get that the journalists were pushing him a bit in the press conference, but if he's maybe just said something along the lines of ""I admit I lost my head a little and did xyz. Maybe I should have handled it a little better and I apologise if some fans didn't like what I did"", there probably wouldn't be such an issue. Instead he sat there and huffed and puffed like a sulking 14 year old denying he did anything wrong. Saying things like ""how about I give you the racket and you play him"" or whatever his exact words were aren't wise. You're the professional tennis player...expect to get asked to justify your shots or game. His attitude during and after the match is the main reason he is copping so much shit.  Hopefully he will learn from this and hopefully everyone else will let him move on. While I said what I have said, it was a single day and I hope it doesn't define his future or stop people giving him a fair second chance. It's not a huge deal, but it seems to have been turned into one."

I remember a lazy forehand where the ball barely made it to the net or bounced into it."
tennis,3cfiuj,is_pissed_off,27,Tue Jul 7 18:02:48 2015 UTC,"Either Roger did not see what Kyrgios actually did (seems to me he didn't from his phrasing), or Roger is just being Roger and trying to be the PR king that he always is, never saying a bad word about another player. It doesn't make him right, it just shows his class, which was never up for debate. I don't care how frustrated Kyrgios was, you'd never see Federer do anything even close to what that guy did, even under the worst of circumstances. There's no defending that garbage."

tennis,3cfiuj,sweetmatter,7,Wed Jul 8 02:54:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is Roger has no contex. He didn't see exactly what  Kyrgios did. He constructed an idea of what he thought happened (a game is only 55 seconds!!!!1!) and based his opinion off that idea. If you read that article Roger basically reveals his bias by saying he only caught the 3rd and 4th sets. Everyone looks to Roger as the hallmark of class in tennis. Roger has had moments in the past but he would never have acted that same way Kyrgios did. People who say ""well it was just one small little game that he tanked"" need to realize that Kyrgios got off easy and it was a small fine he received. His fines are substantially low. Yesterday people were quoting in the hundreds of thousands. $12,000 is honestly nothing compared to the aggregate prize money Kyrgios will earn this year. Roger, unfortunately, got it wrong. As one of the congenial ones on the tour I think he just wanted to avoid any drama with the other men."
tennis,3cfiuj,Rac3318,3,Tue Jul 7 18:07:15 2015 UTC,"Fed might not have context, but he was told Kyrgios only tanked one game... Because Kyrgios only tanked one game. When you put it like that, and then add context given why Kyrgios tanked one game, it's really not that bad. The kid was in a messed up state of mind at the time. People need to get off this crucifixion train and move on. Even Djokovic has tanked whole sets."
tennis,3cfiuj,sweetmatter,2,Tue Jul 7 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"Lol uh people need to get off the excuse train. There's a difference between tanking as strategy and then tanking because you're throwing a tantrum and want to be disrespectful. Also, if you choose to be a professional of tennis act like a... professional. There are real kids who look up to the players. Kyrgios' behavior and antics may be good drama and fun to watch by some people but it is setting a bad example to the kids that are watching him. Small fines, like the one he received, are just to protect the integrity of the game. Also, since when is citing the wrongdoings of others a sound rationalization for the wrongdoings of a person?"
tennis,3cfiuj,MoreDblRainbows,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:32:44 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not excusing his actions. But people are way overreacting to him throwing one game in the second set of a match he almost came back from 2 sets down to play a 5th set.  As to using others? It's extremely relevant. Even Federer has been accused of throwing whole sets. So has Monfils. Agassi was notorious was for it. Beating up a guy who has been on tour barely a year for getting angry and throwing a tantrum but completely ignoring that other greats have done it is completely absurd to me. Almost childish.  Let it go. Move on to something actually relevant."
tennis,3cfiuj,sweetmatter,2,Wed Jul 8 02:02:49 2015 UTC,"Uh it is relevant? It's part of an ongoing tournament. No one has ignored the greats. Kyrgios is young and will have ample opportunity to change how people view him. Just like how Andy Roddick did, and numerous other players have. His behavior this whole tournament was disrespectful to the point of being pathological. Every match I watched this tournament he would throw his racket or erupt in some sort of tantrum. He is an adult though, be it a manchild, and there are no excuses for his actions. You can't fault the tournament for issuing a fine and the public for his admonishment. I honestly don't think people are blowing it out of proportion. This will all blow over next week."
tennis,3cfiuj,sweetmatter,-3,Wed Jul 8 02:15:33 2015 UTC,So you're going to tell him what his own opinion is?
tennis,3cfiuj,Dyllyn,2,Wed Jul 8 02:52:12 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you're talking about. Roger has made his opinion clear...
tennis,3cfiuj,102564,6,Tue Jul 7 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"Yup and I'm merely critiquing it and explaining why his opinion is really moot ""because he has no context"" and didn't see what happened therefore is not particularly in a good place to make such a judgment."
tennis,3cfiuj,compuzr,-1,Tue Jul 7 19:00:25 2015 UTC,Til Roger Federer's opinion is of no relevance to tennis matters upon which he is asked to comment on

tennis,3cfiuj,Adariel,-1,Wed Jul 8 05:21:00 2015 UTC,"Can't believe people are actually defending Kyrgios' actions, let alone using examples like Djokovic tanking sets to justify it. I won't accept such behaviour from Kyrgios, Djokovic, or even Federer. When you stop trying because you disagree with a linesman or the umpire, it's disrespectful to your opponent, to the fans, to the people who invest money in you to give your best. If Kyrgios tanked in the middle of a game, Gasquet wouldn't know if Kyrgios is going to walk away from a serve or swing madly for a ball which might end up being a winner. It's mind games, it's lack of sportsmanship and disrespectful, and it shows an absolute lack of class.  Roger might defend this all he wants, but like some posters said, I don't think he really saw what happened. Roger himself would not do something like that no matter how much he disagreed with umpires, he might not like everyone on tour but he shows respect for his opponent when he plays. Can't say the same for #NKRising."
tennis,3cfiuj,Rac3318,6,Tue Jul 7 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"It's less people actually defending Kyrgios, and more of the absurdity of how people are reacting to it. Numerous players have tanked games and whole sets and people want this kid to be fined tens of thousands into hundreds of thousands of dollars for tanking one game? That's just silly.   He got angry, threw a temper tantrum, and threw one game in the second set. Then he proceeded to almost take the match into a 5th set from 2 sets down. I'm certainly not defending Kyrgios, but how people are reacting to this is damn near childish. It's not that big of a deal. Call for the appropriate amount of fine, say okay, then move on."
tennis,3cfiuj,Adariel,-1,Wed Jul 8 00:59:24 2015 UTC,So...Federer commented on it without actually watching the game in question?  The article makes it sound like he didn't watch the Kyrgios match until 3rd and 4th set.
tennis,3cfiuj,piepsam,3,Wed Jul 8 00:23:26 2015 UTC,"Well, he was asked about it and then they said Kyrgios only tanked the one game. He was just answering the questions being asked. Not like he went out of his way to comment."
tennis,3cks80,fakeshits,29,Wed Jul 8 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"I really don't get it...if the people in charge of Wimbledon thought that the crowd would prefer more women's matches on the main courts, then there would be more women's matches on the main courts. But that's simply not the case. Men's tennis has been insanely good over the last couple of decades, people are more interested in it than women's tennis, and we therefore have men's tennis dominating the main courts. It's really that simple..."
tennis,3cks80,pfc_bgd,15,Wed Jul 8 18:46:11 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head. I like both games (the men's and women's) but we're living in a veritable golden era of men's tennis while the women's game....is lacking, to say the least. It's all well and nice that Wozniacki says that they (the women) should be on centre court as much as the men, but she's the perfect example of what's wrong with the current state of women's tennis. How can you be a former #1 and currently #5 in the world without ever winning a major? Part of it is parity but a good part of it is the game isn't as competitive right now. 15-20 years ago, there was a slew of great female tennis players (Graf, Davenport, Hingis...even Navratilova at the trail end of her career) that were great to watch. At this point, we know that Serena Williams is one of the greatest all time, but it's hard to judge her in the bigger scheme because of how weak the field is (relatively speaking...obviously, if you're a pro tennis player, you're a great player).    While on the men's side, the ""big 4"" may very well rank in the top 20 players of all time (3 for sure, with Murray being the most questionnable one but looking at his game, it's hard to fault him). The Sharapova-Halep match at RG last year was amazing...and that's the quality you'd look for from majors/top tennis players. But they are very far and few between...while the men's game seems to have a few of those quality matches each tournament/major. I think Halep has a lot of potential, Bouchard could be great (but she's another example of the fleeting stardom that is women's tennis)...but the mainstays (Williams, Sharapova) shouldn't be this ahead of the game at the point of their career.     I'm not trying to sound misogynist...so I'm really sorry if I sound like it. I just would gladly take the women's game at centre court when the level of competition reaches the level that it has before and I know it can again."

tennis,3cks80,arturoman,7,Wed Jul 8 22:46:16 2015 UTC,"These journalists don't hold back, press conferences post match seem so aggressive. It seems rude to be hit with that straight off the court and possibly not get a single question about the actual game that was just played. I can't agree with Azarenka on Rafa's grunting though. Maybe it is louder, but it is definitely less annoying. Serena's grunt to me, sounds more natural. I've never heard anyone exhale like Vic."
tennis,3cks80,LustreForce,4,Wed Jul 8 18:15:52 2015 UTC,"I would imagine they run the sport like a business, giving people what they want for the most part and realizing they're not gonna make everyone happy.  Put one the big 4 on a small court and I bet fans wouldn't be happy."

tennis,3cks80,vivs007,5,Wed Jul 8 19:17:30 2015 UTC,"She meant that while guys also grunt, nobody seems to notice them grunting while everyone bitches about women grunting. For e.g. Victoria Azarenka or Maria or herself. So she was saying in that sense like people only point out the bad thing and not the good."
tennis,3cks80,michaelkrep,4,Wed Jul 8 19:37:33 2015 UTC,"sorry, I was referring to the part about the aces and her comment after it."
tennis,3cks80,Palnaj,2,Wed Jul 8 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"Earlier in the conference, they told her that Serena had 24 aces (which I think was actually wrong according to the Wimbledon stats) and then they asked her about the grunting. She asked if any of the guys had 24 aces because that's a huge amount of aces in a 3 set match. Basically saying that if a guy had that many aces in a match, they wouldn't be asking about the grunting patterns."
tennis,3cks80,arturoman,3,Thu Jul 9 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"The guys grunt as a result of exerting effort, not because they want to hinder their opponent as much as possible. Also, screaming like an injured banshee is not the same as grunting.  And if you scream on a drop volley, you deserve criticism. I'm looking at you, Sharapova."
tennis,3cks80,jroberts548,0,Wed Jul 8 22:48:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the difference between shrieking and grunting is that you hear this performative long wail from someone like Sharapova on every hit that doesn't finish till her opponent hits the ball, whereas from someone like Serena you'll hear grunts on long points or when the match gets tight and she has to dig in for extra effort. It's ""Awoooooo!"" vs. ""Ugh!"" and sometimes ""Come on!"""
tennis,3cks80,vivs007,5,Wed Jul 8 23:29:57 2015 UTC,"Agree with her point that grunting is irrelevant, everybody grunts and crowd shouldn't focus only on women. Disagree with her point that there should be more featured matches on main courts. If the matches were more interesting and thrilling than men's tennis, they would find a way to main court. But that's not the case because women's tennis is relatively boring."
tennis,3cks80,Yop333,-1,Wed Jul 8 19:35:21 2015 UTC,How can they complain about gender inequality when they receive the same prize money as men while playing much shorter games in front of smaller crowds and fewer tv viewers?   They should probably stfu before the organisers realise their mistake and reduce the women's prize pool.
tennis,3cks80,redavid,2,Wed Jul 8 23:51:30 2015 UTC,"The sets argument doesn't make much sense when it's not like women have a choice in the matter (many have said they'd gladly play 5 sets at the majors).  The better argument is looking at the revenue or interest generated, but even there, it ebbs and flows. Up until recent years, I think most would agree that the women's game was far more interesting and popular, and even today, something like a US Open final featuring Serena is going to draw far larger TV numbers than a final featuring two of the big 4 on the men's side.  And that argument is why, for example, it's completely valid that Germany gets $35 million for winning the men's World Cup and the US women only get $2 million."
tennis,3cks80,Yop333,0,Thu Jul 9 02:26:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the women tennis being more popular than the men for a while. All the tennis fan I know do not give a single fuck about women tennis, and never have. And last time I checked, the average viewing numbers for the roland garros finals in France were twice as big for the men."

tennis,3ch4xi,JamesOCocaine,29,Tue Jul 7 21:36:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Nadal's grunt is done by the time his ball passes the net. Azarenka grunts until the ball is on its way back to her."
tennis,3ch4xi,Eagled1001,7,Wed Jul 8 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"I always thought of that as an effort grunt, made on shots where he's really focusing. It's not something he's making himself do.   With people like Vika or Maria, it's every single shot, and excessively loud."

tennis,3ch4xi,beyeukr2004,8,Wed Jul 8 04:11:48 2015 UTC,"Azarenka should actually be called for a hinder if it is still happening when her opponent is trying to hit a ball. No different then yelling out as a player tries to strike the ball, as happened to Serena famously."
tennis,3ch4xi,whitey_sorkin,40,Wed Jul 8 04:15:42 2015 UTC,"The problem is the length of the grunt and its shrill-ness. It's really obvious in this match between Azarenka and Sharapova, for example:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA_iYkk9iPo"

You can't criticize her for her grunts after these comments because she'll say you are unfairly judging her when Men grunt  lounder.  I agree with you by the way her grunts are incredibly annoying and seemed very conveniently timed.  This is the only way she will stop people bringing it up though."

tennis,3ch4xi,SugoiBeans,43,Wed Jul 8 03:38:31 2015 UTC,"I dislike the unnecessary grunting, but Azarenka's is definitely one of the worst. With the shrill pitch and length of the grunt, it is much harder to ignore than Nadal's.   Looking back at the highlights of the Williams vs Azarenka match, you can see that Serena went from being mostly quiet to grunting excessively. This is an example of how a lot of the grunting is voluntary and an act of gamesmanship to put off the opponent. It's certainly making the women's game harder to enjoy compared to the men's games, where -- thankfully -- very few grunt with every shot."

I think the answer to your question would be no though, I don't think the wrist can bend in the required way (and with the required strength) to go through the same trajectory as the forehand which is why the general trend is that pro's forehands are stronger than their backhands."
tennis,3cifsx,mathen,3,Wed Jul 8 07:23:57 2015 UTC,"Semi western ohbs aren't very popular anymore. Most top ohbs are eastern or extreme eastern towards continental (index knuckle on the edge of bevel 0 and 1 (where 0 is eastern)).  I've started concentrating on my ohb seriously in the past couple of months and it's come on leaps and bounds.  Things I've changed:   Move to an extreme eastern grip. Stan and Federer use this grip, amongst many others I'm sure. Along with the extreme eastern grip, I've changed to a hammer-style grip (i.e., all my fingers are parallel to each other). This was probably the thing that made the biggest change. Concentrate on closing my stance by making sure my right foot is a good shoulder-width across my left. Concentrate on pointing my right foot across the net when I plant it. This seems to let me open up my torso more. Concentrate on having a loose wrist. This is what will give you top spin. Concentrate on bringing your left hand away and down slightly less. This has effed up my timing a bit (sometimes I open up way too early and hit a pretty feeble shot), but when I get it right I'm blasting my backhand about as hard as my forehand.   Basically I just watched slow mo footage of Stan's backhand and took these things that I wasn't doing before from it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgNASyLyGAg"

tennis,3chg0s,Jobin1616,2,Wed Jul 8 11:47:44 2015 UTC,Wow!!!! Federer had a great practice here and Fritz really does seem to be an up and coming player. Thanks so much for the video!!!
tennis,3chg0s,Fikir1,-6,Wed Jul 8 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"why the fuck do we respect this guy. he is obviously tanking in this match and you still praise him. double standards. when an african american (kyrgios) does it, it is a disgrace but if a white guy like federer does it, its considered ""stable, smooth and consistent""."
tennis,3cig3x,closingtime13,18,Wed Jul 8 03:59:48 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong, but I think you could say the same about a few players. Nadal, Djokovic, Federer, Murray, and I would argue a whole host more, when they catch fire are also unbeatable. That's why matches go so long and it's so amazing to watch when both players are playing lights out (ex. Wimby 2008) The difference between being number one and number 10 though is how often you can play at that level."
tennis,3cig3x,bezjones,7,Wed Jul 8 09:38:11 2015 UTC,"I believe Murray, Nadal and Djokovic rely more on defense. When an offensive player like Wawa or Federer go all out and don't miss, it's close to impossible for the opponent to get every ball back."
tennis,3cig3x,Kinon05,4,Wed Jul 8 12:34:39 2015 UTC,"Nadal and Djokovic (and to some extent Murray) are that good that they find a way to turn defense into offense. I don't believe for a second that even if Stan was playing at his peak, that if he was playing Nadal at his peak at the French, he would win.   The other side you need to consider is why players don't always play at 100%. Sometimes they're just not given a foothold in the game. Momentum, mental strength, etc. Play a huge part in it. Yeah attack Nadal's backhand, go to the net, etc. but what if he's on form? He hits that banana shot around you and all of a sudden you're down 2 sets to love? Even if it was a tie break both sets. You get what I mean? It's not just about how you play, come up against another top player and has studied your game, he won't let you play your best tennis."
tennis,3cig3x,bezjones,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:44:33 2015 UTC,Agreed.
tennis,3cig3x,bezjones,0,Wed Jul 8 13:05:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah i agree, though with Wawrinka, both times he's won Grand Slams it hasn't mattered who the guy on the other side of the net was or how great they played. He was simply too much for them."
tennis,3cig3x,bonoboboy,7,Wed Jul 8 13:03:42 2015 UTC,"(insert another top ten player here), when he's won Grand Slams it hasn't mattered who the guy on the other side of the net was or how great they played. He was simply too much for them."
tennis,3cig3x,Ted_F,-5,Wed Jul 8 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"I think Djokovic at his peak > Nadal at his peak > Federer at his peak > Wawrinka at his peak > Murray at his peak.  2011 Djokovic would get to the most insane shots. In 2015, he's playing average or slightly above average at best now, Nadal is playing the worst he ever has, Federer is playing slightly above average but not close to his peak. Only Murray and Wawrinka are playing close to their peaks."
tennis,3cig3x,TacticalTennis,6,Wed Jul 8 14:56:07 2015 UTC,"I share the same opinion. When Stan is on fire, he is almost unstoppable. He just doesn't have a weak point to exploit. He has a big serve, awesome forehand, outrageous backhand, good footwork and he's become mentally really stable. His only drawback is that he is not as constant as Djokovic for example."
tennis,3cig3x,Beforehand87,12,Wed Jul 8 04:06:39 2015 UTC,His movement is not on par with the other Elite guys. That's what can be exploitable if you can handle his power.
tennis,3cig3x,TacticalTennis,3,Wed Jul 8 11:47:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, you have to get him on defense and not let him stand on the baseline and take huge cuts at the ball. On grass, this might be a little easier with the slice, and trying to bring him forward now and then."
tennis,3cig3x,Beforehand87,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:57:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's IF they can handle his power. I have yet to see anyone who can when he plays great, but who knows, I hope we get a great match between him and Gasquet."
tennis,3cig3x,Alchemist32,6,Wed Jul 8 13:08:15 2015 UTC,2004-2007 Fed would have handled it well enough. Gasquet will cause Wawrinka at least some problems on grass because he opens up the court and will make Wawrinka move.
tennis,3cig3x,TacticalTennis,2,Wed Jul 8 13:17:53 2015 UTC,"If Richard can abandon his natural inclination to play two meters behind the baseline, yes."
tennis,3cig3x,compuzr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:24:23 2015 UTC,No way federer woulc handle his power as federer in that time no disrespect never really played opponents with stans power and ability to unload off both sides so that point is not proven at all I would argue otherwise that stan would overpower him just like the french this year
tennis,3cig3x,Alchemist32,3,Fri Jul 10 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"Did you never hear of players like Marat Safin, Fernando Gonzalez, Andy Roddick, Agassi, Ljubicic... they all hit the ball a ton. Safin hit as big as Stan off both wings. Agassi too, albiet a bit flatter but also significantly earlier. Gonzalez's forehand was bigger than Stan's forehand OR backhand, and Ljubicic crushed it. Roddick had a huge forehand that he was using following the biggest serve in the history of the game at that point... the reality is back then Federer was a step faster and handled power better than anyone."
tennis,3cig3x,TacticalTennis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:30:47 2015 UTC,"Don't forget del Potro, Robin Soderling, James Blake...and let's not overlook Nadal. When Nadal really crushes a forehand, it's unreal."
tennis,3cig3x,compuzr,0,Fri Jul 10 04:03:24 2015 UTC,Yes I did and none of those players are anywhere near as good as stan at his best. I dont think you know but the top players from 04-07 would most likely not even be in the top 10 in this era where the courts arent super fast anymore and you have to be a complete player and not just rely on a serve or a forehand. Stanislas wawrinka cant be compared to anyone federer played from 2003-2007 stan should be compared more to nole and murrays levels :).

Safin is way too inconsistent and he hasnt got the defence required nowadays to consistently perform week after week. Baghdatis reached a slam final in 06, Gauston gaudio won the french in 2004 I mean are you kidding me?!. Tim henman would definitely not be in the top10 and I can go on and on but yeah :)"

tennis,3cf7iz,swolengomads,13,Tue Jul 7 13:13:16 2015 UTC,Can't understand why anyone is surprised by the size of the fine. Fines are never all that significant. It took Nalbandian injuring a linesperson to even earn a full-prize-money fine.
tennis,3cf7iz,plenty_of_time,7,Tue Jul 7 16:36:42 2015 UTC,There appears to be a lot of animosity (maybe from a minority of fans) towards Kyrgios and people are expecting an irrational level of punishment to satisfy their emotional disgust.
tennis,3cf7iz,jeffwingersballs,19,Tue Jul 7 17:04:43 2015 UTC,I want to like Kyrgios. So I hope this serves as a wakeup call for him to clean up his act a bit.
tennis,3cf7iz,adizzle14,24,Tue Jul 7 13:26:12 2015 UTC,"He made $127,000 this week. I don't think $12k will be the wakeup call he needs."
tennis,3cf7iz,kyles24,12,Tue Jul 7 13:55:44 2015 UTC,"1% of his career tournament winnings (not counting endorsements or anything). A slap on the wrist, but I still think it'll dissuade him from doing this again."

Especially if he's not been so spectacularly stupid as not to incorporate. Even legal penalties (i.e., fines) are tax deductible in the US. Here's JPMorgan getting slapped with a $13B fine that it gets to use to reduce its tax liability in the US.  And before you complain about big corporations getting to do something you don't, you could always form a corporation/LLC and do a lot of the same stuff.

tennis,3cf7iz,tells,3,Tue Jul 7 15:50:28 2015 UTC,"How is it disrespectful to Gasquet, the umpire and the crowd?  Gasquet is looking to win.  Kyrgios going through a meltdown is not disrespectful.  The umpire's job is to regulate and keep score, not to pose as a member of the royal family.  They expect disagreements from time to time.  Finally, the crowd.  If the crowd was full of people expecting each point to have the intensity of a 20+ shot rally on match point, then yes.  However, any person who understands tennis or has played at a high level in any sport would understand the frustration you sometimes feel with your own game.    The reason he was fined is because the high ranking people in tennis want to maintain an image of being a clean and classy sport."
tennis,3cf7iz,KyleG,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:59:00 2015 UTC,This. LOL at tanking being disrespectful to your opponent or the umpire or anyone. That's a ridiculous stretch for some kind of aesthetic beauty of argument.

tennis,3cf7iz,redditlastnight,5,Tue Jul 7 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Why do we hold tennis players players to such high regard to the point where they must be polite, gracious and act ""proper"" all the time? I mean they are at a MAJOR tournament.  I posted elsewhere about Bill Burr experience at the 2015 FO final but here goes:  I listened to Bill Burr's Monday Morning Podcast and he was recanting  about his experience there at the French Open finals.  He wasn't enjoying but couldn't pin point why until he realized he didn't like the tennis crowd.  In particular, he disliked the crowd when they booed Nole did when he smashed his racket.  And also when they booed Stan when he smacked the net with his racket.  He goes on a funny rant about the wealthy, snobby, elitism that the tennis crowd draws.  ""Like those rich snobs haven't hurled something across the room when their stock portfolio dropped"" (paraphrasing here).  At Wimbledon the crowd even booed Roger just for swiping an out of play ball into the net. Like we haven't done that. Imagine how we act when we are on court. We're not disrespecting the game, the opponent or the opposing player. (If anything, it's ourselves).  I think Bill's right.  I love it when the athletes wear their heart on their sleeve (without disrespecting anyone).  I think the crowds do create the typical (and what some would call boring) tennis players (robotic and unemotional). Almost scripted players. We need them to be themselves. Part of watching tennis is to watch the characters that play tennis and to watch how the game unfolds."

He refused to play and refused to respect the umpire's decision, insisting he wouldn't play until a tournament official came out. When the out call was upheld he said ""dirty scum"" as he walked past the umpire. He was given a code violation.  In the third round he missed a break point and flew into a rage and smashed his racket - it bounced into the crowd and almost hit a spectator. He was given a code violation.  This time, he was swearing and then he refused to play a game, just standing and letting the ball go by him. I think they were fed up given pretty much every round he had caused issues so they fined him."

tennis,3cikh5,Starfire09,3,Wed Jul 8 04:59:52 2015 UTC,"Don't concern yourself with your height.  Sure you might not have the same maximum speed on a serve as taller people (more bend in the leg and acceleration for them), but you can hit all the exact same serves as them.  The angles on a court are such that you've gotta be like 6'8"" or something to hit a 100% flat serve and have it clear the net while landing in the box.  So you along with 99% of tennis players in the world still have to hit across the ball in some way.  Just look up the typical serves: topspin, slice, and kick.  They all use the same general motion, so working on one should help with the rest"
tennis,3cikh5,GibberingWreck,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:45:10 2015 UTC,"Well I wouldn't just concentrate on one serve. You just need to learn to serve, which will give you the ability to hit any type of serve. Look for youtube videos on Olivier Rochus - 5'5 - top 30 player at one point."

tennis,3cexqf,tommos,9,Wed Jul 8 05:20:00 2015 UTC,"Hoping that Simon does well against Federer.   I feel that Simon has realized his strengths and weaknesses and plays a tight game. This means that he also waits for mistakes from his opponent. I remember a match with Berdych sometime this year which Berdych won comfortably. Simon was not really playing that bad it was just that Berdych was far better that day. This makes it feel that Simon's game is passive, which it somewhat is but I can't help but appreciate a player who tries to make the best of what he can do."

tennis,3cgdgf,truthlesshunter,32,Tue Jul 7 18:25:11 2015 UTC,"I was unaware of any rules, written or otherwise, that say you can't move during your opponent's serving motion."
tennis,3cgdgf,ThePaddingtonBear,21,Tue Jul 7 18:58:42 2015 UTC,this is the main reason why I posted it. I saw the highlights and the two instances she's talking about; I don't get why Coco was so upset. A lot of players sway and move a bit during the opponent's serve and there aren't any inherent rules on the preparation for a return with regards to it. It just struck me as very odd that she would complain about it and I wanted to see what this community thought of it.
tennis,3cgdgf,areascontrol,2,Tue Jul 7 21:09:41 2015 UTC,"Apparently Maria was moving quite a bit more than she normally does.  If you're not used to watching her play you might not even pick up on it.  I would NOT put it past her to resort to a tactic like this.  I say good for CoCo for not giving a shit and speaking up about it.  Most players are too ""polite"" or intimidated."
tennis,3cgdgf,michaelkrep,13,Wed Jul 8 11:46:14 2015 UTC,"As long as you don't make a noises, you are fine. We see tons of players move forward during the toss. I don't know what she is complaining about."
tennis,3cgdgf,limbo696,10,Tue Jul 7 21:31:51 2015 UTC,"I just read the USTA rules last night and you're allowed to move but not do actions that will intentionally throw off your opponent serve like waving your arms or making noises.  Having said this, it's pretty obvious that Sharapova is a very rude sportsman like when she yells, ""Come on!,"" every time her opponent makes an unforced error or when she receives and turns her back and makes the server wait to serve--she obviously does things like this to try to get underneath the skin of her opponents."

tennis,3cgdgf,plump1234,2,Wed Jul 8 02:41:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I wonder if the ITF rules on the issue are the same. But yes, sharapova is the gamesmanship queen."

tennis,3cgdgf,CaptainShocks,12,Tue Jul 7 23:21:01 2015 UTC,Anyone have any footage to confirm if she was moving?  All the professional men take a quick shuffle of the feet and a hop forward during their opponent's serve.  Can't imagine Sharapova was moving any more than those guys usually do.
tennis,3cgdgf,pounro,14,Tue Jul 7 19:51:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people like Murray move a whole lot during a player's second serve."
tennis,3cgdgf,mathen,2,Tue Jul 7 20:36:43 2015 UTC,I've seen some players get annoyed at Nadal for this. Can't remember where/who it was but it was a particularly squeaky hard court and Nadal's opponent said Nadal shuffling around as he threw the ball up was distracting him.

tennis,3cgdgf,teemose,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:07:05 2015 UTC,When they showed the highlights on bbc2 she was moving around a lot during the serve
tennis,3cgdgf,TenNes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:04:51 2015 UTC,"She was making pretty large shifts along the baseline, but it may be that she was reading the serve based on Coco's body language and was trying to move because she thought she would slice out wide or something."

tennis,3cgdgf,Zuran,13,Tue Jul 7 19:05:25 2015 UTC,So if she feels like Sharapova did something wrong she should only talk if she wins?  Had she won and spoke about it people would say she has to win with grace.   Seems unfair.
tennis,3cgdgf,BraveSaintStuart,3,Tue Jul 7 22:16:51 2015 UTC,"Additionally, it seems like she was asked about it.  She could've dismissed the question, and we'd probably be talking about how she doesn't want to answer any questions from the media."
tennis,3cgdgf,anatabolica,4,Tue Jul 7 22:19:35 2015 UTC,"Wasn't she asked about whether the damn grunting was poor sportsmanship? I'd say ""No, but I think this was"" is a legitimate response.  Edit: misread your comment"

The most blatant example I can think of was when Daniela Hantuchova was destroying Ivanovic in the Semis of the Aussie and then Ana started doing this weird movement/shoe squeak thing. Now, I din't really pay attention to this match so I can't say what Sharapova did or didn't do, but she didn't deny it and she has always been down for some junior level mind games in the past. The bigger point is CoCo should be able to handle it.   Basically : Its not right, but its OK"

tennis,3ch9jw,MCallanan,9,Tue Jul 7 22:10:15 2015 UTC,I can't see Murray or Federer being particulary challenged.  Cilic will be a tough match for djok but he will win  But I can definitely see Gasquet upsetting the Stanimal tomorrow the way he's been playing.
tennis,3ch9jw,mrkingpenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:35:43 2015 UTC,Gasquet vs. Wawrinka is interesting to me. Gasquet has done a good job of playing the aggressor at this years Wimbledon which is strange considering his passive history. But Stan just hits with so much pace that I have trouble seeing a scenario where Gasquet is the aggressor. Even as a Gasquet fan who picked him to move out of his section I have a hard tim envisioning him winning the match without Stan piling up the unforced errors.
tennis,3ch9jw,Gogogodai,7,Tue Jul 7 22:54:07 2015 UTC,"Federer: his head to head against Simon is 5-2, but their only matches in majors both went 5 sets (2013 RG, 2011 AO) and Simon has been playing great this fortnight. I doubt it'll actually happen, particularly on grass, but I'd still call that the most likely.  Djokovic - Cilic could also be interesting; the head to head is massively one-sided, but Cilic did take Djokovic to 5 sets at this stage of Wimbledon last year. I don't feel like Cilic has looked all that impressive so far though and Djokovic will obviously be played in for big servers after coming back against Anderson so I doubt this one will happen either."
tennis,3ch9jw,Thelonius-Drunk,6,Tue Jul 7 22:42:25 2015 UTC,"But aren’t those majors the two slowest playing courts of the four? Not sure how the AO compares to the US, but RG is undoubtedly the slowest, and Wimbledon inarguably the fastest."
tennis,3ch9jw,Gogogodai,2,Wed Jul 8 01:15:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those were the slower majors. I agree that the surface might sway it, though Simon is looking more comfortable on the grass than I think I've ever seen him."
tennis,3ch9jw,Thelonius-Drunk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:58:02 2015 UTC,Have you watched his matches at all? I haven’t seen any of his this Wimbledon.
tennis,3ch9jw,Gogogodai,2,Wed Jul 8 06:11:00 2015 UTC,"Didn't see his second round against Kavcic, but I've seen at least parts of all of his other matches and a fair amount of him at Queens too (he made the semis before losing to Anderson). He's playing really well - moving and retrieving well as you'd expect, but also taking chances to play aggressively when he can, hitting down the lines and even coming to net a little bit. If he can bring the form he showed in demolishing Berdych (albeit helped by a slightly off day from Berdych) then it should be a good match."
tennis,3ch9jw,startinup,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:43:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, and AO is slower than U.S. Open. Wimbledon does slow down a little bit in the second week, but surely it wont be too slow this early."
tennis,3ch9jw,beepbloopbloop,4,Wed Jul 8 02:03:02 2015 UTC,I am entirely with you on Simon... I just have this hunch that this one is going to be more difficult than advertised.
tennis,3ch9jw,PheromoneCvlt,6,Tue Jul 7 22:49:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know, fed is cruising this year and this is the one he wants to win most. I think he'll be in the finals."

tennis,3ch9jw,Gogogodai,2,Wed Jul 8 10:08:57 2015 UTC,"Although in 2011 and 2013 Roger was playing differently, and arguably worse. The last time they played was Shanghai last year and Roger took it in straights. It'll be interesting to see how Simon handles Roger's bumrushing to net."
tennis,3ch9jw,winabean7,2,Wed Jul 8 01:22:35 2015 UTC,"Good points, though it could be said that Simon is also playing differently, and arguably better, nowadays as well. He looks like he's finally beginning to work some aggression into his game and isn't afraid to take the backhand up the line or smack a hard, flat forehand rather than just retrieve the way he has most of his career. I remember that match in Shanghai and, while it was straights, it was pretty close (7-6, 7-6).  I agree with you about coming to net though. I'd have to hunt for the comment but I think I wrote somewhere on this sub around the time of that Shanghai match that I thought Federer's relentless net-rushing might be exactly the way to beat someone who plays as far back as Simon usually does. On grass that might well be the difference."
tennis,3ch9jw,bumbleb333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:05:24 2015 UTC,"If Fed was able to beat Simon at RG in 2013 (his worst year on his worst surface), I like his chances tomorrow."

tennis,3ch9jw,eldasto,2,Wed Jul 8 08:43:54 2015 UTC,"Wawrinka, grass is not his best surface and Gasquet has been playing very well this tournament. Also one of Gasquet's biggest problems has been mental fortitude, and he was able to deal with Kyrgios' antics. I take this as a sign that his head is in the right place this tournament."
tennis,3ch9jw,DilbertsBeforeSwine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:07:07 2015 UTC,"Most likely? I think Wawrinka, he has the thoughest match of the first 4 seeds, Simon could be a surprise but Federer has been fairly consistent."

tennis,3ch9jw,reedsparks,2,Wed Jul 8 03:28:52 2015 UTC,"Going into the Djokovic-Cilic match Cilic is obviously the heavy favorite. he won the US open last year when Djokovic was eliminated in only the semis. But Djokovic has recently gained great form, nonetheless, Cilic is still the favorite here with the amazing serve and power game that he uses to DECIMATE the Big 100 time and time again. If Djokovic pulls up this upset it would certainly be amazing but I think he can do it just like he did last year."

tennis,3cfdfz,DamnShadowbans,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"This article is so annoyingly written, along with the fact that the data is presented in a weird way. In my opinion a better way of relating these matches to a players ability would be to use the percentage of lost matches that are Simpson's Paradox matches, and perhaps the percentage of won matches that are too. These would be both very low numbers, but to say that Federer performs badly in Simpson's Paradox matches is wrong, since there are no matches that are automatically going to be of this type."

The loss at the 05 Aussie open was the turning point for this ""rivalry""  I want Maria to win. SO BADLY. I also want Serena (no matter how much I dislike her) to win the Serena slam.   If she's going to ever beat Serena, she needs to play lights out. Like she did in the second set of their Aussie final this year, but better. She's capable. She hasn't won 5 GS for nothing."

tennis,3cfb0z,bumbleb333,2,Wed Jul 8 03:29:52 2015 UTC,Assuming Fed would have won when he nearly just beat Nadal (who actually did win the tournament). Show the guy some respect.
tennis,3cfb0z,bezjones,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:42:28 2015 UTC,"verdasco played a 5 hour match of high intensity and with only a day of rest I doubt he would have been able to beat a fresh federer. he does not have the insane stamina or recovery that nadal or djokovic possesses. plus, verdasco cant exploit federer's backhand nearly as well as nadal. and federer was in his prime in 2009"
tennis,3cfb0z,bumbleb333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:51:25 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah for sure Fed would almost certainly have won. It's never a certainty though. We can't say ""Fed would've"". Verdasco didn't win so we'll never know. After Djokovic beat Nadal and then Murray, it was a certainty he'd win the French and look what happened there."
tennis,3cfb0z,bezjones,0,Wed Jul 8 11:43:41 2015 UTC,"To be clear Verdasco played stunning, but you can watch Nadal losing his concentration and focus while getting tired. Still, absolutely breathtaking performance."
tennis,3cifxb,Ted_F,2,Wed Jul 8 03:58:03 2015 UTC,"Serena isn't a great match-up for Maria Sharapova, as evidenced by the last 11 years. I just don't see Maria getting a win on Serena when she's playing this well. Not here, not now.  The final prospects are what intrigue me. Radwanska was tricky for Serena in the 2012 final, and Muguruza has been tough for Serena every time they've played. I dare say Muguruza would be the tougher opponent, but I just can't bet against Serena in a final. She only gets tougher, and we all know she really wants the Serena slam and a shot at the calendar slam. I fully expect her to turn it up the next two matches and get it done."
tennis,3cifxb,DynamicImpulses,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:52:28 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I think Azarenka was the biggest obstacle on the way to the Wimbledon trophy this year. Azarenka played amazing tennis and Serena really had to put everything in to win it.

I've not been the greatest fan of Novak, but I like him a lot after that match. vs Cilic tomorrow should be a classic.

tennis,3ceo6k,Gogogodai,9,Tue Jul 7 16:57:25 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Serena was still making a noise as Azarenka hit her volley. There have been a few others that I thought were borderline from her but that was pretty blatant.
tennis,3ceo6k,GinGimlet,14,Tue Jul 7 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"Agree but I think you're gonna have problems if that's a hindrance but not Azarenka or Sharapova or Muguruza's normal loooooong 'grunts'. It's a very, very fine line, no?"
tennis,3ceo6k,melodicsyrup,66,Tue Jul 7 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"Azarenka grunt > Sharapova grunt.  Like someone already pointed out, the Azarenka grunt is like an owl. To me it is homely - I can imagine laying in bed on a summer night and hearing Azarenka in the distance somewhere and finding it peaceful. Also, Azarenka's is more breathy and exhalation-based whereas Sharapova's sounds like a badger being torn apart. If Azarenka could alter her pitch, she'd make a pleasant instrument, whereas Sharapova's would not be easy on the ear."

tennis,3ceo6k,MoreDblRainbows,7,Tue Jul 7 15:45:22 2015 UTC,Yeah the final might be a bit of a let down but her half of the draw is tough. The biggest obstacle in the final regardless of opponent was always going to be herself.

tennis,3ceo6k,moonmoney111,9,Tue Jul 7 12:52:48 2015 UTC,Fuck that's some clutch shit from Novak
tennis,3ceo6k,rafessi,8,Tue Jul 7 13:11:16 2015 UTC,"Serena really is something else..,  What serving in those final 2 service games, incredible... She's just a mental fortress out there   Credit to Azarenka for making this close and pushing Serena all the way. This was definitely the best match of the tournament on the women's side, some very high quality tennis."
tennis,3ceo6k,nachoman456,33,Tue Jul 7 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"i dont get the disdain for novak. he's a great competitor, seems like an actual decent guy and plays some of the most impressive tennis of the past decade. why the hate? well done nole!"
tennis,3ceo6k,fuzzyfeels,27,Tue Jul 7 13:21:48 2015 UTC,Have you seen this subreddit while Nadal was losing to Brown? It's a normal part of the champ vs underdog dynamic.
tennis,3ceo6k,Novatortoise,13,Tue Jul 7 13:30:37 2015 UTC,"I don't see much disdain for Djokovic, it's more just people rooting for the underdog"
tennis,3ceo6k,VJKotts,21,Tue Jul 7 13:22:39 2015 UTC,All the Federer and Murray fans are piling on. They believe that the only chance their player has got in the final is that if Novak is out of the final.
tennis,3ceo6k,MetalKeirSolid,3,Tue Jul 7 13:24:12 2015 UTC,"The problem seems to be the crowd bias:  vs. Nadal or Federer: he's still not the celebrated champions compared to these two, so the crowd will go for Nadal or Federer  vs. Nadal at the French, or Murray at Wimbledon: basically he becomes the challenger to the 'home' player  vs. anyone outside of those three: he's the 'obnoxious' winner everyone wants to see lose to an underdog  the only time you'll get a fair crowd is when he plays someone like Murray at the Aussie open  it sucks because he doesn't deserve it at all. Djokovic for life"

tennis,3ceo6k,marauding_forward,4,Tue Jul 7 17:46:34 2015 UTC,I can't remember when I last saw someone serve as well as Anderson has done today. Djokovic can barely return anything. Incredible to watch.

tennis,3ceo6k,gibisee4,5,Tue Jul 7 11:56:54 2015 UTC,I'd add on that Serena hasn't lost to Sharapova in 11 years (and only lost one set in the last 12 matches). I wouldn't be surprised if she never lost another match to Sharapova.
tennis,3ceo6k,rafessi,7,Tue Jul 7 12:40:36 2015 UTC,"Muguruza wins in straights, terrific match from her, really solid performance from her.  I can see her making the final on this form regardless of the opponent."

If she can work on that, I see no reason why she wouldn't contend for slams in the near future.  The ability is there, the question is whether she is mentally strong enough to go all the way...."

tennis,3cfq72,Brobeans1610,4,Tue Jul 7 19:18:12 2015 UTC,Dudeeee that is so weird I  was literally like 5 seats away to your right.... Me and gf queued from fri morning got crt 1 tickets at the gate and sat back and enjoyed the show. I thought it was really poor hospitality from the umpire not to let anyone know about the move... I only found out because I got a call from my dad saying he could see me on tv and that they were moving.
tennis,3cfq72,dogma4life,2,Tue Jul 7 21:24:21 2015 UTC,"So glad you had a good time. I was lucky enough to have a court two ticket yesterday.  Saw 2 great matches (Kyrgious Gasquet and Berdych Simon) then wandered to the exits of centre. Asked a lovely couple politely for their tickets and walked straight into the Federer game.  Literally got tickets within 10 seconds of waiting so definitely try that next time too.   Best event I've ever been too.  Everyone is so lovely and friendly with a genuine passion for the game, right down to the bar staff."

tennis,3cfdbj,BornInTheRSA,38,Tue Jul 7 14:04:47 2015 UTC,You're talking about djokovic v anderson right? Djokovic raised his hand not to challenge himself but to let his opinion be known that he thought it was in. It's generally good sportsmanship and djokovic probably also wanted to maintain competetive integrity since he doesn't want a point that he didn't deserve.
tennis,3cfdbj,mrcollet,6,Tue Jul 7 14:24:40 2015 UTC,"Incidentally, does anybody else do that besides Djokovic?"
tennis,3cfdbj,LoveFifty,28,Tue Jul 7 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"Federer did it vs Wawrinka once. They were rallying, and Wawrinka fell, Federer got an easy backhand but he hit it out because he was looking at Wawrinka, but the umpire gave him the point. Federer then said that it should've been Wawrinka's point because his shot was out. I'll find the video for that.  Edit: Here's the video"
tennis,3cfdbj,beyeukr2004,14,Tue Jul 7 16:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think many other players share this sportsmanlike spirit that is a tradition in tennis. However it's rare because the player has his eye on the ball whilst the linesman has his eye on mainly the line, and therefore it is unlikely that the player has a better judgement than the linesman."
tennis,3cfdbj,mrcollet,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you that players do that, if I'm thinking of the same point yesterday it was a case of Djokovic wanting to challenge faster than the line judge could call it out, hence the following confusion with the umpire."
tennis,3cfdbj,the_badgerer,22,Wed Jul 8 01:35:57 2015 UTC,Honesty. Integrity.  I remember Andy challenging a call in his favor because his opponent ran out of challenges but wanted to challenge. I think it was against Baghdatis and was probably match point.

tennis,3cfdbj,ghostlywillacather,9,Tue Jul 7 18:11:06 2015 UTC,I once saw Roddick challenge its own serve which was called in.  Since he missed his second shot thinking the ball was out.  Turns out he was right !  I'll try to find a link   Here is one where Monfils'return was a winner : http://youtu.be/OJIH6qFAZrU
tennis,3cfdbj,Sang0kai,6,Tue Jul 7 17:16:41 2015 UTC,"This was great, not necessarily just for honesty or for integrity but because his serve was so big that line judges had a lot of trouble judging it. Although obviously Monfils wasn't trying to cheat (not his call to make) I believe that in amateur tennis, this is the most common form of cheating/pulling calls. Especially on weaker serves, if the serve is just a few inches out, the returner will crush the shot, and if the return is in, they act as if the serve wasn't a fault. Some guys, if they miss the crushed return, will then finally call the serve out, well after they realize they missed their shot."
tennis,3cfdbj,droplob,2,Tue Jul 7 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this got to be a pretty big problem in NCAA doubles too. (Players usually call their own lines except in big tournaments).  Ordinarily the receiver's partner makes out/let calls, but it became fairly common for the partner to purposely fail to acknowledge a let, because the serving team kind of relaxes when they hear a let and are somewhat defenseless if the ball is played live.  At one point I think the NCAA had actually eliminated lets entirely, but not sure if that's still the case.  I guess it also speeds up the game a little bit, but the bigger issue by far was the let no-calls."
tennis,3cfdbj,salliek76,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:23:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah the ncaa still plays that way (in men's tennis), with no lets."
tennis,3cfdbj,droplob,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:23:54 2015 UTC,"I would've thought that doubles would inherently have less cheating, as the more players on court, the more people accountable, but I could definitely see that. I've also heard the reason for the rule is that receivers would call let's on big points, and it's a lot harder to overturn. World team tennis also plays by these rules"
tennis,3cfdbj,droplob,2,Wed Jul 8 08:33:14 2015 UTC,Same thing happened to me last time I played tennis. Hit a hard serve and was sure it was out and I didn't go after the return even though the ball was fed right to me. Unfortunately that was a mistake because I'm pretty sure it's the return of serve's call. He had admitted to smoking a few bowls before the match. If I had a challenge I would have used it.
tennis,3cfdbj,sweetmatter,2,Tue Jul 7 18:34:17 2015 UTC,He had admitted to smoking a few bowls before the match.   Seriously? Haha wow
tennis,3cfdbj,127crazie,4,Tue Jul 7 20:35:29 2015 UTC,The only case where I've seen this is Federer challenging his own serve that was called in because he was serve and volleying and he claimed thinking the serve was out made him miss the volley. The umpire didn't allow it though because it was clear Federer intended to hit the volley.
tennis,3cfdbj,khfreek,4,Tue Jul 7 15:35:32 2015 UTC,His reaction afterwards was hilarious :D !
tennis,3cfdbj,babunka,2,Tue Jul 7 14:36:12 2015 UTC,I remember Safin challenging his own serve against Fed years ago when Hawkeye first started being used. It was mostly a joke that they laughed off because Fed hit a ridiculous return winner.

I didn't see what was happening so I don't know, but find it so annoying when players complain (especially after the fact) about this. almost all players move prior to the return, bouncing on their feet and jumping into position, don't whine just focus on your serve"
tennis,3cf70l,droplob,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:39:51 2015 UTC,"she was talking with the chair umpire during the match too. 2nd set is when i saw her do it. ""well, yes she is. as soon as i start to go, she's moving. i'm telling you that and that's all i have to say about it. if you don't say something, i can say something, it's no problem."" that's after the 7th game in the 2nd set."
tennis,3cf70l,kingka,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:17:02 2015 UTC,"Ok, that's definitely a lot better than post match complaints. Was the movement unnecessary? Should she have been penalized or at least told to stop by the chair, or was it normal motion from the receiver"
tennis,3cf70l,droplob,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:43:05 2015 UTC,"i didn't notice anything when i first watched her service returns, i'm watching her service games right now and nothing is abnormal, just light hopping on the feet and then reaction. if anything, coco is moving a lot more before service ball contact versus maria. i wish i knew how to capture video. also, i see guys do this all the time, is that against the rules? murray does this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG2q_U-XhRA  ok i found the point where she stopped her service motion and reset because maria was moving around. it was second serve at 15/15, 2-4, set 2 and maria side stepped to her left to probably set up her forehand and then coco reset and maria went back to the right. is that against the rules?"
tennis,3cf70l,kingka,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:16:28 2015 UTC,"What murray did didn't look bad to me, maybe worse due to slow mo. Especially against a big server it's important to take a hop step. As fr the rules, i don't know but I think that you're certainly allowed to move (I think what murray did was legal) but if the chair deems something out of line they can tell give a warning, then take a point, etc. I think you could even set up far to one side, and take a hop step back to the center if you want (say to bait them into serving to the t or out wide)."
tennis,3cf70l,droplob,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:32:47 2015 UTC,"that's exactly what maria did on that one point. she moved to her left setting up her forehand on what she expected to be a easy 2nd serve. i don't know, seemed completely ok"

I like it though, I mean it is allowed in the rule, why not use it? It adds an interesting twist to these days 130mph all day every day players. And it's not easy to hit a good underhand serve with lots of spin either.   It probably will take someone who consistently does this, get some aces or unreturned serves with it and then it could be accepted again."

Cilic/Djoker I still call for Djoker though this one I think will be closer. Cilic has the firepower to win games/sets if he gets hot but I don't think he'll stay hot enough to win 3 sets, and I just watched Djoker gut out a huge comeback against another big server.  Wawrinka/Gasquet I pick Wawrinka but Gasquet is playing some great tennis. The pick comes down to the serve for me, I think when things tighten up Wawrinka can serve his way out of trouble and that gives him the edge."

tennis,3cgfe1,Jackofalll,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:40:31 2015 UTC,I am expecting Gasquet and Simon to give more trouble to their opponents than usual. Both of them have sort of flown under the radar with their opponents grabbing the headlines (Kyrgios and Monfils / Berdych respectively). Fed is definitely in hot form but Simon plays a somewhat tight game - if Fed maintains his hot form it should be a straight set win else it might go into tie breaks where Simon can snatch a set.   Djokovic - Cilic match will depend a lot on Cilic. Djokovic has been given a scare so he will play a very tight match - try to not make many errors. Cilic will need to serve really well to push Djokovic.   Murray - Posposil - I honestly feel that it is Murray's match to lose. Posposil has had some good results but I really think he had the luck of the draw and managed to get to face opponents who are at his level.
tennis,3cgfe1,btaz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:41:54 2015 UTC,Novak in 3  Gasquet in 4  Murray in 3  Federer in 5
tennis,3cgfe1,googaburra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:26:42 2015 UTC,"Djokovic in 5. Coin flip between Djokovic in 4 or 5, but i'm giving Cilic's fitness and conditioning the benefit of the doubt given that he's already played two 5-setters. If Cilic is to win he'll have to do it in 3 or 4. Gasquet in 4. Gasquet's been playing brilliantly and I see him winning against Wawrinka who's been OK, but not 'good', on grass. As an example, his defeat of Goffin in round 4 was the first time he's beaten a top 20 player at Wimbledon, and it was in 3 tight sets and even Goffin isn't that good on Grass with a 48% win rate on the surface. So i expect Gasquet to go though. Murray in 3.  Pospisil is not going to be competitive in this one. He's at a massive disadvantage. On Monday he played 10 sets of tennis in singles and doubles. That was after 5 sets in round three, 4 sets in round two and 5 in round one. He'll do well to win 4 games in a set. Easy Murray win. Federer in 4.  This depends what Simon turns up. If it's the one that beat Berdych so comfortably then it'll either be Federer in 5 or a Simon win. If it's the Simon that doesn't bother turning up then it could be Federer in 3 easy sets. Fuck knows. This is the most unpredictable match."

On the contrary, this thread is a great example of what not to do. Looking at the last line:   Really surprised at how well Simon has been playing, but I don't see him winning obviously.   Why not? What's obvious about it? Simon's 2 slam matches against Federer went to 5 sets, why won't that happen again?

I recently had to take about a year off from tennis due to capsular inflammation (inflammation in the spaces between your wrist bones). Some of the other possibilities are that you have an injured TFC tendon (runs right through that area), or several other tendons in that area.

As for power players, I think Keys is a pretty solid player, and I see a lot of potential in her as she gains more experience and progresses along her game. Looking forward to watching/hearing more about her!  Muguruza as well, she's got that height advantage over a lot of the other players, and hopefully she'll grow (harharhar) to capitalize on that.

tennis,3cep2j,Ted_F,14,Tue Jul 7 09:29:45 2015 UTC,"To be honest, no I don't see him winning this slam anymore, and that's fine because he's had his glory days on this court, like he also said, not many players can say that they played 5 finals on this court but he did, so that's an accomplishment in itself.  I would just like him to break the tie with Sampras and I think that's possible, just like Roger turned back the clock in 2012 at his favorite slam, Rafa can do that at RG.  In addition, if he can win another non clay slam it would be icing on the cake."

tennis,3cep2j,Randomliberal,4,Tue Jul 7 10:38:35 2015 UTC,"I'd never rule him out just like I never ruled out Fed. The only problem I have is Nadal doesn't seem to be at his physical peak anymore, and I don't know if or when he'll return there. It's how he wins so much on every surface, but now he can't even do it on clay. How much of a chance he gets in grass when the ball is faster and angle is lower?  Let's not get to the mental state as well, something that he has always used psychologically to put the fear in his opponent. Haven't seen Nadal in a dogfight and win recently. Is this just a long slump for him? Or will he find peace like Federer that he's gonna have good and bad days and cherish that role."
tennis,3cep2j,gg_2015,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:37:06 2015 UTC,"I heard that an appendectomy is really hard to return to physical form from.  Combine that with all of his knee problems and he's going to be a step slower as well as slower and less controlled in his core rotation.  Plus, with the wrist injuries he might be getting less topspin on the ball too.  I can see why he's struggling so much.  Mental toughness can't help you if your body isn't there."
tennis,3cep2j,avaliantheel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:51:13 2015 UTC,"Right. His injuries are really taking a toll. I can almost see the same thing with Murray, who's battled a lot of injuries lately, though not to the frequency of Nadal's. They chase after every ball, and those miles add up.  If I notice now w/ Djokovic, who's been relatively injury-free since 2010/11, he's changed his style. He doesn't chase after every ball, but he's dictating the pace of play. He's basically modeling after Federer, and it's helped him preserve his body longer."
tennis,3cep2j,gg_2015,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:54:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't help for Murray that since Lendl and he stopped working together, he's fallen into old habits of defensive tennis and elongating points."

tennis,3cep2j,dannhash,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:23:12 2015 UTC,You may know more about the topic than I since I'm not a doctor.  I've only heard that it's uncommon for athletes to return to 100% after an appendectomy.
tennis,3cep2j,avaliantheel,0,Tue Jul 7 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way, if Andy Murray can come back so well after BACK surgery then I assure you an appendectomy is nothing"
tennis,3cep2j,dannhash,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:02:31 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying, but back surgery is to help your back.  An appendectomy is to remove your appendix which is behind your abdominal muscles.  I would imagine that your abdominal wall will take some collateral damage in the process of removing the appendix.  Do you know a good source I can turn to so I can understand how this works?  My google searches have only yielded answers that are relevant for going to the gym but I haven't found anything good pertaining to athletes."
tennis,3cep2j,avaliantheel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:17:23 2015 UTC,"As a doctor I can tell you that appendectomies are now done via ""laprascopic"" removal so you don't actually cut through any muscle but just split the layers till you get to the appendix, patients come in for surgery in the day and are often discharged after a single day if not the same day..... Back surgery definitely is much harder on the body since there is certain work and perhaps damage of the muscles, and I'm sure you know how integral the back is to serving and a million other things in tennis"

tennis,3cep2j,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:49:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  His whole career, the narrative has been the first week of Wimby for Nadal.  With the grass not worn-down and a myriad of players in the mix, people always picked Nadal to either lose early or go far.    The fact that he went to the Finals for 5 straight years is a testament to his ability, but as his game declines, we're starting to see him lose in the early rounds as predicted."

What I don't get is how the USA have the best women's player, one of the best women's doubles team, and the best men's doubles team, yet there is no single great man's player. I miss Roddick. He's the only relevant US male player in the last decade. We're certainly not going to see a lot more of the Williams and Bryans at the top level, seeing as they're deep into their 30's.

For example, Canadians have Milos Raonic (former Yugoslavia), Daniel Nestor (Serbian), and Vasek Pospisil (Czech).  When Canada faced Serbia in Davis Cup, they could have spoken in Serbian (which overlaps a lot with Croatian, etc).  Americans had Sampras (Greek), Agassi (Iranian), and Chang (Chinese).  More recently, Kudla (Ukraine) and Bogomolov (Russia).  Wozniacki is Polish representing Denmark.  There's Zverev (presumably Russian) representing Germany.  Troicki representing Serbia (Troicki sounds Russian to me).  Ymer representing Sweden (Ymer's family originally from Ethiopia).  Countries like Kazakhstan have convinced players (mostly Russian) to become citizens and get financial support.  Aljaz Bedene, formerly of Slovenia, has become a British citizen.  There was even a possibility, many years ago, that Djokovic could have been a British citizen.

This is how things should work. I agree that outrage is not necessarily the appropriate response to someone having the wrong opinion - much better to tut and explain why they're wrong.

In the NRL 12% of players are aboriginal (compared to 2.5% of the population), 35% are Polynesian (hugely over represented). I can't find stats for first or second generation Australians not of Polynesian heritage, but there is strong representation from players with Italian, Lebanese and Maltese heritage (amongst others) playing in the NRL.  The AFL has 15% of its players being second generation Australians, as opposed to 20% of the general population. Also, 12% of AFL players are indigenous Australians.  Soccer is over represented by first and second generation Australians, and foreigners.  Rugby Union is hugely over represented by Polynesian players.  Cricket might be the only major sport in Australia where 'Anglos' are over represented."

tennis,3cbtbl,TheHardWorkingIngo,3,Tue Jul 7 13:23:24 2015 UTC,Man I thought he blew it at 4-0 after those break points.
tennis,3cbtbl,KetamineClive,3,Mon Jul 6 18:57:41 2015 UTC,"I swear Djok just takes matches to 5 sets for a laugh...or maybe a workout. So often it happens, and then he wins the last set 6-1. Same will happen here."

tennis,3cbtbl,Dole238,3,Mon Jul 6 20:04:16 2015 UTC,I can't believe they suspended the play that early. The visibility was fine in my opinion. Will the spectators have to buy another ticket to watch the conclusion tomorrow?
tennis,3cbtbl,beepbloopbloop,9,Mon Jul 6 20:08:20 2015 UTC,Will Novak finally overcome this new challenger? Will Kyrgios do something even more stupid? Watch the thrilling conclusion on tomorrow's episode of Tennis Ball Z!  edit: those names even sound like DBZ names
tennis,3cbtbl,poohnds,5,Mon Jul 6 20:08:51 2015 UTC,It's a good thing tennis isn't like DBZ otherwise each game would take a whole day to watch and there'd be even more grunting
tennis,3cbtbl,TzOctopus,3,Mon Jul 6 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"Just got back from this match, big shame we didn't get to see the 5th but was a great match none the less. Anderson's serve is a joke I could barely even see it. Unfortunately I think Novak will mop up easily tomorrow but I would love to be wrong."
tennis,3cbtbl,DeltaStorm,3,Mon Jul 6 20:37:26 2015 UTC,anyone else watching at the minute?

tennis,3cbtbl,KeiNishikori,15,Tue Jul 7 13:03:50 2015 UTC,Federer's match started later than Djokovic's.  Federer won the whole match while Djokovic couldn't win a set yet.
tennis,3cbtbl,arrz,9,Tue Jul 7 13:16:12 2015 UTC,"""He's the size of a giraffe but he ran like a gazelle then!""  Commentators do talk a lot of shite don't they? Maybe there's a big hat behind the scenes filled with bits of paper, and they fish out random analogies to spew off between points. There was a horribly forced football analogy earlier by Inverdale that just made me cringe."
tennis,3cbtbl,Cosmic_Colin,4,Tue Jul 7 13:25:38 2015 UTC,"Well, at least it makes some sense as he's South African."
tennis,3cbtbl,Perpete,4,Mon Jul 6 18:43:52 2015 UTC,A loss for Djokovic would break the quarter-finals serie he currently has. Letting Federer keep it for sure (and forever ?).

tennis,3cbtbl,startinup,2,Mon Jul 6 18:30:09 2015 UTC,Anderson is an ace machine in this 2nd set tiebreak.
tennis,3cbtbl,Kishara,2,Mon Jul 6 18:49:59 2015 UTC,Oh hell yes Djok! Great shot at the 6/5 game.   Edit 6/6 now. Can this get any more crazy?

tennis,3cbtbl,plenty_of_time,2,Mon Jul 6 18:58:54 2015 UTC,"Fellow Anderson fans know how tight he can get, as well as how many errors he hits, so this is just thrilling. Also the effectiveness of the serve--Drysdale at one point said that he always serves about as well as Isner and Karlovic, but this is definitely better than usual for him!"

tennis,3cbtbl,TheHardWorkingIngo,2,Mon Jul 6 18:59:47 2015 UTC,"Djokovic getting it together now. Doubt he'll be broken but if Anderson can make good in sets after, we may just have more tiebreaks."
tennis,3cbtbl,GreekCavalier,2,Mon Jul 6 19:00:16 2015 UTC,Guys djokovic did this in RG too he plays with like 70% of his streangth in the early rounds to save energy but if he needs to he brings out his best.

tennis,3cbtbl,missscottfraser,2,Mon Jul 6 19:33:43 2015 UTC,This feels a little like watching Murray in the early days. Really hope Anderson pulls this one out of the bag.
tennis,3cbtbl,Lemurians,2,Mon Jul 6 19:34:21 2015 UTC,Novak's going to steamroll through here on out. Looking much more comfortable now. Seems to have picked up Anderson's serve.
tennis,3cbtbl,dannhash,2,Mon Jul 6 19:34:44 2015 UTC,I wonder if the time of day makes a difference on the speed of ground strokes..... Maybe in the warmer temperature of day Anderson might do better which means he would benefit coming back tomorrow

tennis,3cbtbl,PicopicoEMD,2,Mon Jul 6 20:03:07 2015 UTC,"The suspended play can really benefit Anderson. With the momentum how it was Djokovic would cruise through the 5th. Now the momentum is gone, and they'll both start fresh. Of course Nole has a huge advantage, but at least now there's a chance."
tennis,3cbtbl,Disastrously_Dazed,3,Mon Jul 6 20:11:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I thought, fresh legs on Anderson will help him out, however the downside is there's no tiebreaker in the fifth so he has to break."
tennis,3cbtbl,get_go,2,Mon Jul 6 20:17:05 2015 UTC,Anyone know what the rule says about moving to Center Court?
tennis,3cbtbl,charlotte2785,3,Mon Jul 6 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"Not off the top of my head. It was done on Saturday but that was presumably because play couldn't resume on middle Sunday.  It makes more sense logistically to continue play tomorrow as you'd need to move the spectators to Centre, which could be time consuming... would just be a bit of a faff, really."
tennis,3cbtbl,Forzelius,2,Mon Jul 6 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"Poor Anderson, fought so hard for 5 sets and then threw it all away with the worst service game of the match."
tennis,3cbtbl,CaptainShocks,2,Mon Jul 6 22:21:24 2015 UTC,And I believe that'll be the end for Anderson.  That's what makes the top guys the top guys.  Anderson choked and Djoko shifted into higher gear at exactly the right time.
tennis,3cbtbl,vgn,2,Mon Jul 6 21:48:31 2015 UTC,2 double faults in a row. Physical giants can be mental midgets.
tennis,3cbtbl,r0bski2,2,Mon Jul 6 22:29:19 2015 UTC,God dammit. How does he do it...
tennis,3cbtbl,HeelR-,2,Tue Jul 7 13:15:49 2015 UTC,"What an unlucky end for Kevin Anderson. What a show did he put, props to him. Unfortunately he did the same mistake as Nick did vs Gasque, 2 double faults that cost the set and the match.  Lots of things that he can take away tho, easily a T10 player if he keeps his game at this point."
tennis,3cbtbl,MrDongji,2,Tue Jul 7 13:17:24 2015 UTC,A real shame for Anderson.  His forehand got especially tight at the end there and those double faults conceded the match.  Props to Djokovic for being so opportunistic and focused mentally.
tennis,3cbtbl,yiyiyiyi,5,Tue Jul 7 13:20:52 2015 UTC,"Come on Anderson, this time pls"

tennis,3cbtbl,thelarsonw,4,Mon Jul 6 19:29:55 2015 UTC,Don't worry guys. Anderson is just dropping this set to bagel Novak in the fourth.

tennis,3cbtbl,opiumgordon,2,Mon Jul 6 19:56:12 2015 UTC,That is the only scenario I foresaw before Anderson pocketed two sets. It's either one of the three you expect to win Wimbledon or Wawarinka  shows up and backhands everyone to death. I'm down.

tennis,3cbtbl,duffercoat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:19:40 2015 UTC,Looks like Djockovic is struggling to find his rhythm a little. Shots not coming off as well as they normally do and Anderson taking it right up to him.

I haven't forgotten how Federer, Nadal, Safin, Roddick, Hewitt, and others acted when they were younger (throwing rackets, tantrums, unnecessary celebrations of points won, etc).   Also, you'll notice that all of the other players on tour are saying they have no problem with him and he's a nice guy off the court"
tennis,3cdicm,lereddituser7575,14,Tue Jul 7 02:26:09 2015 UTC,I was surprised when gasquet said we needed more exciting players like him after today's match. You would think he wouldn't be very well liked with the players.
tennis,3cdicm,plump1234,16,Tue Jul 7 02:31:16 2015 UTC,"It goes to show that if the players are accepting his behavior this much and even defending it, it's not something to get worked up about. Before Hawkeye was put in place (around 05 I think?), players used to blow up at calls quite frequently. It's not seen as frequently nowadays, but his behavior isn't anything that people haven't seen before. People make it seem like Kygrios is punching babies on the court lol  People act differently on court from off court. Murray is a great example (animated, swearing, gesturing on court... soft spoken, witty, almost shy off the court)"

I think Tennis is a hard game to show personality because it's very constricting, and let's face it there is not much self-expression on the court, it's all very reserved, I think that's more to do with the game rather than the people.  Not to say I don't enjoy reading the articles that pop up following these out-bursts, but it's not like I feel like I know him any better through his behaviour on-court."

tennis,3cdicm,bitchdantkillmyvibe,35,Tue Jul 7 10:35:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. God this sport would be so boring without people like Kyrgios. He doesn't always handle himself the best, and that will come with age, but you can't deny that every match he plays is full of excitement.   I still support the guy because, well, he plays good tennis. I'm not deciding whether I want to be friends with him or not, he plays a very entertaining brand of tennis and I hope to see more of him. As long as his temperament doesn't start affecting his abilities, then I'm all for him and actually love his antics and watching how much it seems to rile people up, but that's why last night's game was a little disappointing because I did feel it was one of the few times his petulance did get in the way of playing well, but it's going to happen, we've seen this behavior from some of the best players in history, I think it almost goes hand in hand.   Someone last night made a really great comparison of Kyrgios to Happy Gilmore, and as silly as it sounds I agree, the kid just needs to learn to channel his anger and frustration, instead of letting it get the best of him, because when he does he plays a very fierce style of tennis."
tennis,3cdicm,Pleasuredinpurgatory,12,Tue Jul 7 01:56:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say his temperament got right smack in the way of his abilities. Until that changes, he'll just be a sideshow twitter highlight reel."
tennis,3cdicm,Pacify_,4,Tue Jul 7 02:52:40 2015 UTC,and yet hes still doing pretty damn well for someone so young  4th round again in a grand slam is nothing to scoff at
tennis,3cdicm,bitchdantkillmyvibe,2,Tue Jul 7 10:18:50 2015 UTC,"Last night? Yeah. The rest of the tournament up until that point? Nah, he played some of his best tennis against Schwartzman, Monaco, Raonic."
tennis,3cdicm,omadanwar,4,Tue Jul 7 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"Whats the point of getting this deep in to the competition if he is going to be ultimately be limited by his personality and not hours ability then? Such a waste of time and the incredible petulance displayed yesterday was nothing short of embarrassing for a grown ass man. Yea he is young, but you wouldn't expect that kind of tantrum thrown by even a 15 year old. I'm sick of people excusing him as a breath of fresh air just because he swears and walks around like quazimodo."
tennis,3cdicm,steve3635,3,Tue Jul 7 08:48:05 2015 UTC,haha I actually like that comparison. And yeah I like your point about how you aren't deciding whether or not you want to be friends with him. Sure he can be off-putting to some but it just makes him all the more entertaining to me.
tennis,3cdicm,bitchdantkillmyvibe,7,Tue Jul 7 05:11:08 2015 UTC,"I will make the same argument I made with a Brit in the 1980s regarding McEnroe, love him or hate him, he makes the sport more interesting.  He either gives you someone to pull for or against. (FYI: The Brit didn't buy the argument back then and now McEnroe is doing commentary on the BBC.  It took me 30 years to get vindication.)"

tennis,3cdicm,kopkiwi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:06:40 2015 UTC,"Not even remotely similar. People are mistaking mcenroes passion and hunger for the game to be the same thing as kyriagos' not wanting to though it out. He is mentally weak and bitched out of the match, using every excuse he could to justify his, at times, horrible performance. Big Mac never ever capitulated because he was to upset, indeed the opposite - he used it as motivation to get motoring."
tennis,3cdicm,TinKnight,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:51:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people are downvoting you, you're completely right. His attitude definitely hindered him in that match and if he's going to get pissed off, he has to be focused again by the next point."
tennis,3cdicm,Alex_1404,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:43:56 2015 UTC,I don't mind a bit of temper or flair. But Kyrgios is a flat out cunt whom I hate fails because of his shit attitude.
tennis,3cdicm,plump1234,11,Tue Jul 7 04:28:40 2015 UTC,"Being a brat != being an exciting personality  Characters are fun, but Kyrgios is just a poor character. There have been plenty of entertaining characters (Safin, Roddick, Hewitt, Santoro, Djokovic, Agassi) who are nuanced, entertaining, and still good sports. At least when McEnroe was a brat he had results to back it up."
tennis,3cdicm,Sebasu,6,Tue Jul 7 06:23:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't follow tennis at all pretty much. But to me, an outsider, he's a breath of fresh air that I've felt tennis has needed. Maybe that's not true to how tennis is supposed to be played, but that's just my view."
tennis,3cdicm,advicethrowaway619,4,Tue Jul 7 03:25:33 2015 UTC,"Tennis has always had rebellious ""punks"" throughout its history. PR drones have taken over the sport the past couple of years so I think kyrgios has taken people by surprise."
tennis,3cdicm,bwenstar,3,Tue Jul 7 04:15:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm I think so, yeah. He's got a lot of potential and he can go do really well in years to come if he puts the effort in. Sure, his attitude does worry me a little, but he's 20 years old. He's gone from being a nobody last year, to a well-known player ever since he defeated Nadal a year ago. So not only has his ego and the public's expectations grown larger than he could have expected, but I also think he's expecting himself to do really well in every match. Hence his anger when he mistakes and such. Hell, I'm like that too (with things other than tennis) so I understand a little.   What would make me stop liking him is if he doesn't grow up. If he doesn't learn to control his anger and use it rather than let it use him. But I think he will manage that. The news about the fines does suck a little, but hopefully it'll help him learn and maybe even grow up, both as a person and a player."
tennis,3cdicm,ADonkeysArmy,2,Tue Jul 7 02:37:26 2015 UTC,Anyone got a link of the 3rd game 2nd set where he was tanking? I started watching from the 3rd set so I didn't understand why everything was claiming he was tanking the match

tennis,3cdicm,eddyhans,2,Tue Jul 7 02:52:15 2015 UTC,"I thought it was hilarious in a way. Perhaps it is professional suicide but that kind of ""fuck it"" attitude is sorely lacking in tennis."
tennis,3cdicm,PoopOnGod,2,Tue Jul 7 06:47:03 2015 UTC,"He has to tone down his histrionics and I'm sure that will come as he matures a bit more, but as far as his tennis is concerned, I can get behind the guy. He's obviously very talented and is part of this new generation, so if he gets his head sorted out, I think he definitely has the potential to make it big."
tennis,3cdicm,squidjellyfish,2,Tue Jul 7 07:59:26 2015 UTC,"Being cocky, shouting, showing plenty of temper I don't really mind. I actually kind of enjoy it at times. The full-on tanking and not trying in slightest at times however was very disappointing to see."
tennis,3cdicm,somang2015,3,Tue Jul 7 11:16:05 2015 UTC,"I still like Kyrgios overall. I don't mind him insulting the ump, that's a tennis tradition. I don't mind his racket abuse in general, but I do mind it when it endangers the crowd. I don't like to see any player give up, which Nick did in that second set vs. Gasquet. But he seemed to try pretty hard in the other sets, so I forgive him.  Of the many current enfant terribles of tennis, Nick is the one I like most and mind the least. He seems generally good natured and good humored. He has his lows but he'll bounce right back. He also doesn't seem mean the way Fognini appears to be (Fognini has used racial slurs and homophobic insults during matches). He may not be a mushroom, but Nick seems like a fun guy.  I do hope that he gets more disciplined as a player. He is enormously talented and just needs that bit of mental development to be a contender for slams."
tennis,3cdicm,backspin_lob,4,Tue Jul 7 02:16:42 2015 UTC,"I think he is great! This bandwagon that the media is fueling against him is abhorrent. What's worse is when people who don't even follow tennis decide that their opinion matters because they've seen 30 seconds of out of context footage about him on the news. They act like he is the first tennis player to ever say a bad word or break a racquet... ha!  The fact that his ethnicity has now been bought up to attack him is sickening. Somebody needs to adjust Dawn Fraser's meds and send her for a quiet lay down or a sesh with her circulation booster.   Oh yeah not to mention the fact that everyone is supposedly against bullying and don't know why its such an epidemic in our schools, meanwhile ""adults"" are all over the internet calling Nick a flog and telling him to fuck off. Oh the hypocrisy!  I truly do not have any issue with anything that he has been torn into for, he really hasn't done anything wrong in my book."
tennis,3cdicm,red_280,2,Tue Jul 7 05:09:42 2015 UTC,"it was a disappointing end to the match, i was pissed at him for losing with a DF but in time he will mature and become better and a gun player."
tennis,3cdicm,DRUNKTENNIS,2,Tue Jul 7 02:53:26 2015 UTC,"It's funny to me how people quote his mentality as a weakness. He saved nine match points against Gasquet at Wimbledon and multiple against Seppi at the AO. And he's 20. Sure, it dipped today, but the average is still phenomenal."

He is not the only man on tour who has outburts and is not the only man on tour who has been subject to fines. He is an easy target, but I think people should be excited to see how he turns out."

tennis,3cb8am,nbhd,73,Mon Jul 6 15:37:48 2015 UTC,"Fine's appropriate, IMO. They're tired of Kyrgios already. What he did was dismiss the importance of Wimbledon flagrantly. Playing on the world stage, you become a millionaire for playing well. Why shouldn't you also lose money if you act totally unprofessional and childish on court at the world's most respected, traditional tournament?"
tennis,3cb8am,buddyweaver,18,Mon Jul 6 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"Tennis rules suck, man. He's obviously playing his own rules."
tennis,3cb8am,Haze667,13,Mon Jul 6 20:04:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. All of the other stuff, well, sometimes I would chalk it up to ""he's just being young.""   Enough's enough. He's been throwing worse and worse tantrums, he's not growing up at all, he's getting worse and becoming a man-child on the courts. Just the other day, I posted that I couldn't help but root for him, but this was the straw that broke the camel's back. Giving up on points when fans, spectators, the linespeople, the tournaments etc., have invested time and money into your match is utter bullshit.   If someone pulled this shit on our USTA team, it would be their last time to do so, I guarantee you our captain would never give that person playing time again. How much worse is it when you've got a stadium full of people who paid to see a match, sponsors who've paid to present the match, etc., etc.   He needs to be shown that this crap won't be tolerated."

I just became curious because it seemed to me a fairly mundane comment, probably neither worthy of upvoting or downvoting really, and yet when I made my edit it was at -4. No big deal, but I wondered if there was maybe some sort of taboo against betting in /r/tennis that I was unaware of, knowing that sports betting is illegal in much of the US, in contrast to here in the UK where if I throw a stone randomly in my high street it's probably around 5/1 to hit a betting shop."

Look at Lleyton Hewitt, he was regarded as an absolute shithead when he was young.    Andre Agassi was a wanker too.    If you judged everyone by the way they act when they're in their teens and early 20s the bar would be set a lot lower."

tennis,3cb8am,Bigclancy,4,Mon Jul 6 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"I'm young and it drives me nuts when apparently all the old people keep making excuses for him because ""he's only 20.""  Like, do these people know 20 year olds in their lives, or do they only know very entitled, spoiled 20 year olds or something?  I know plenty of people in that age range and they can't fathom someone behaving like that either.  Maybe part of it is his youth, but it definitely isn't JUST because he's ""only"" 20 years old.  Plus, seriously, 20 is not that young anymore.  The perception that it is and that it's ok to still be this immature at 20 because it's expected is precisely why millennial then have to deal with the backlash from older adults who think they don't deserve any respect.  It's like a catch-22, immature behavior from a few gets excused because of youth, then the entire age category gets accused of being immature!"
tennis,3cb8am,Adariel,35,Mon Jul 6 23:46:29 2015 UTC,"Should fine him even more, or ban him from Wimbledon for a year or two as well. This is the grand stage, people pay a lot of money to watch you give up? Don't come back next year."

tennis,3cb8am,goodstuff10,7,Mon Jul 6 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you start with a fine, which is not as irrelevant as you're making it out to be. Also a ban is a punishment that doesn't fit the crime."
tennis,3cb8am,jeffwingersballs,2,Mon Jul 6 19:12:27 2015 UTC,Yeah if he threw the third set as well I'd be calling for a ban but as it is I think a large fine is a sufficient punishment. If he does it again he would definitely deserve a ban.

tennis,3cb8am,jiso,-19,Mon Jul 6 22:37:35 2015 UTC,I can. Why shouldn't he give up ? It's his right. He loses and he doesn't gain anything.  Besides it's only a game it's not like he lost entire match on purpouse. I don't think he should be fined.  And how can they prove legally that he gave up the game and not that he tried to win but failed in doing so cause Gasquet's serve was too good ?  If this was a legal case it would be Kyrgios word vs whoever wants to fine him and maybe in the end he wouldn't be fined.
tennis,3cb8am,dragonsky,20,Mon Jul 6 18:20:01 2015 UTC,"Did you see the game in question? It's clear Gasquet's serve wasn't too good, he flat out blew it"
tennis,3cb8am,Novatortoise,9,Mon Jul 6 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear that he gave up the points, watching the video. He starts limply walking towards the ball before it gets to him, and he hits it very weakly. Also, it's entirely possible that he could have broken Gasquet if he actually tried to return the balls, so the outcome of the match may well have been altered by him doing that. It most likely wouldn't have, but it's within the realms of possibility that the outcome of the match was affected by him doing that."

tennis,3cb8am,TenNes,5,Mon Jul 6 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"You're incorrect about a legal case. In virtually all of the Western world, there is often a mental component to virtually element of a claim, criminal or civil. If we just took people ""at their word"" for their mental state, we would virtually never be able to prove that someone committed a crime ""intentionally"" for example.   The way we handle that is by having the reasonable person standard, which, at least in much of the US, is a question of fact for the jury, or judge who is adjudicating the matter. What would a reasonable person in the position of the actor be thinking.   If you look at the video, Kyrgios has clearly given up, that's the reasonable assumption that one can draw from his body language. This isn't rocket science."
tennis,3cb8am,xscientist,37,Mon Jul 6 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"Shit like that is infuriating even at an amateur level. In a Grand Slam it degrades the sport itself, literally and figuratively.

Although if we look closely, after the gave that 3rd game away, he looked at his box and gave a thumbs up. That's unusual, looked like his team said something that whined Nick and thus he did that. As we all know Nick, he does't want anyone to get under his skin."

tennis,3cb8am,Bamkill,2,Mon Jul 6 16:36:36 2015 UTC,What happens if he refuses to pay the fine? Banned from playing? If they apply the max penalty (250k) he will struggle to afford it.
tennis,3cb8am,freedoms_stain,2,Mon Jul 6 17:25:46 2015 UTC,"It'll be taken out of his Wimbledon winnings in the first instance, if it's the lower sum then that would be fine as he won £120K, if they went on the higher end of the max and he refused I don't know what they'd do.   They could potentially exclude him from future ITF events and the ATP could potentially exclude him from their events too. They could also range the money out of future earnings.   In all likelihood he will pay up."
tennis,3cb8am,KyleG,2,Mon Jul 6 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"There's no way they can fine him that huge amount. How in the world could you say that behavior is ""injurious to the tournament""?

tennis,3cb8am,kydjester,5,Tue Jul 7 03:58:11 2015 UTC,"So.. he lost 7 straight games in a row from the first into the second. He was frustrated and he bounced back with a solid 3rd and 4th and people are still crucifying this guy? Something tells me someone has a grudge against his attitude and nothing else. His game is fine. The big 4 have all given up games, they just hide it better."
tennis,3cb8am,henrax,-1,Mon Jul 6 21:57:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, thanks. It's not unusual to give up a few points to ""freshen your mind"". A fine for this is inappropriate imo."

That's at least an order of magnitude greater than any other sport. For a player that has probably made ~1 million dollars in his career, that is a very significant fine. It's not like he has physically harmed anyone."
tennis,3cb8am,Rac3318,10,Mon Jul 6 17:11:28 2015 UTC,This tennis subreddit is pretty silly. You can't post anything reasonable like you just said without getting down voted into oblivion

tennis,3cb8am,Rac3318,2,Mon Jul 6 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"One of the alleged violations had a 250,000 dollar fine and people were wanting that, so yea, his comment was pretty reasonable."

As for the alleged violation, people need to work on their reading comprehension and not just fall for the most sensational blurb.  I mean if he tanked an entire match in the final of a GS or something, sure, that's probably what that line was written for.  But obviously he's not going to be fined 250k so bringing it up was pointless."

tennis,3cb8am,henrax,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:24:24 2015 UTC,I really don't understand why you're being downvoted. These fines are just insane and make absolutely no sense.
tennis,3cb8am,Adariel,0,Mon Jul 6 22:05:01 2015 UTC,"According to this article, it's like $27,000.  I've also seen $20,000 USD.  http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-2015-nick-kyrgios-denies-tanking-accusations-but-could-still-face-27000-fine-20150706-gi6hyf.html  I don't know where the heck they're getting this $200,000 number from unless that's the absolute maximum, like if you tanked away the final of a Grand Slam (in which the players would be getting paid quite a lot in the first place for just showing up).  EDIT: You're most likely getting downvoted because it was never $200,000.  Even article linked in the thread title states 20,000 US dollars (£12,860)."
tennis,3cb8am,plstc,2,Mon Jul 6 23:35:38 2015 UTC,"You're right; surely it's just some number they pulled out of their asses for shock factor or something. $20,000 is much more likely. However, that's still a lot compared to other sports. I can see why he'd be getting a fine of that size, though, considering this isn't the first time he's been a massive dick."
tennis,3cb8am,Adariel,0,Mon Jul 6 23:44:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I doubt he'll be fined anything at all for the tanking, actually.  Apparently he was fined 2k but that was for the audible obscenity.  I do agree $20k is a lot compared to other sports but then other sports aren't always comparable to tennis in many ways, e.g. expectations of sportsmanship and audience cooperation/silence.  Plus, knowing that there is a possibility of a 20k fine should deter people from consistently being massive dicks, which is the whole point of the fine, I think.  Not that it's really supposed to be applied much, but that it's there at all to make players think twice about their behavior."

tennis,3cb8am,henrax,2,Mon Jul 6 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"Seeing the reactions on this thread I may be the only one but I don't really understand the fine. I mean he has the right to play like he wants. I don't say he has a good behavior of course but I don't understand how a fine is adequate.  If you want to walk for a game because you're tired, or just you need to wash your mind it's your right. I know that sometimes I ""let go"" the end of a set to be fresh in the next, I don't see how it's that different.   Come on, he was angry, he let go a few points because of the frustration. That doesn't harm anyone but him, I don't get why people are so offended.  I'm really willing to hear your arguments."
tennis,3cb8am,i-spye,6,Mon Jul 6 22:00:47 2015 UTC,"It calls into question the integrity of the game. Pretty much all sports have rules along these lines. Fans have paid money to watch competitive tennis.  It can also have knock on effects, him effectively throwing the game gives Richard Gasquet an easier match which could give him extra rest for the next round."
tennis,3cb8am,henrax,5,Mon Jul 6 22:47:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know, in a way it forces the players to play in a certain way. Maybe he needed that to get over the frustration and play better after that. Maybe if he had tried to stay focus and ""in the game"" he would have lost more heavily. We can't know that. Fans have paid money to see him play and he is playing, he owns them nothing in my opinion.   I don't think he should be fined for this : hated by everyone of course but fined ? I don't think so.  PS : also, is this really a habit in this sub to downvote when you disagree ? It's crazy how half the reasonable answer that try to start a discussion are downvoted sometimes heavily."
tennis,3cb8am,Adariel,4,Mon Jul 6 22:54:33 2015 UTC,"He absolutely does owe the tournament something.  The tournament is what is paying him, in part from the money from the fans, and when the tournament fines players it is also acting on behalf of fans.  They have rules like this precisely because it hurts the image of tennis overall.  This is the same reasoning why players can be fined for obscenities.  Of course the rules force players to play in a certain way - I don't get your point here?  That's like literally the definition of rules.  Fans have paid money to see him play according to the rules which include things like no obscenities and no outright show of disrespect via tanking or throwing games."
tennis,3cb8am,henrax,2,Mon Jul 6 23:08:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah my wording may not be very accurate, English is not my first language. What I mean is that the rules should not say in what mindset you should be when you play. Maybe, just maybe, this helped him to play better later. I don't think that rules should get you from playing bad."
tennis,3cb8am,Adariel,5,Mon Jul 6 23:28:41 2015 UTC,"It shows utter disrespect for his opponent, the game, and the fans - how would you feel playing someone who's so self-absorbed that he decides to walk over as you're serving?  Did you see Gasquet's face when he saw what Kyrgios was doing?  There's a difference from not really giving 100% and letting a few points slip by and actually doing it very ostentatiously to make a point, which is what I saw in that game.  You can check out the replay on the other thread."
tennis,3cb8am,henrax,-4,Mon Jul 6 23:01:18 2015 UTC,"Yes I saw the replay and understand what you say. I just disagree with it. I mean yes maybe he doesn't give a shit about his opponent, the game, the fans and everything else. But why should he get fines for this ? As long as he only harms himself and he considers that this is good for him at this moment (it's probably not, but we are not his coach) no one else should have a say.  Maybe making a show and acting like a dick is what made him play better later in the game. Maybe in the long run it was good for him.  He deserves all the hate, but not the fines. This is just my opinion. I just think that every one should have the right to play as bad as he wants (as long of course as you're not involved in any bet but that's not the issue here). It's also part of the game."
tennis,3cb8am,Adariel,4,Mon Jul 6 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"But why are you so sure he's only harming himself?  He harms the experience for the fans, he harms the tournament by behaving in such an unsportsmanlike manner, and he harms his opponent, who is inevitably distracted by his antics - so even if Gasquet gets a free game, he gets drawn into the Kyrgios show with the expletives, sock changing, sulking, and so on.  If this kind of behavior were regularly part of the game, tennis would be a joke and would definitely be losing fans.  Imagine if the top 4 players regularly acted like Kyrgios.  They might play great tennis but lots of fans would tune out - and yes, I've heard all the arguments about past generations loving terrible players, and maybe that was what tennis fans were like in past generations, but I sincerely doubt it would draw fans from ours, who mainly grew up watching and admiring players like Federer.  So yes, the tournament and the fans should have a say, even if it comes at a monetary penalty.  These tennis players are not entitled to do whatever they want.  At the end of the day, the fans are what makes it possible for them to be making a career out of playing sports.  So maybe in the long run it's good for him to act like a dick, but actually it won't be good for him when no one's around to care or watch him act like a dick, because fans have stopped watching tennis out of disgust."
tennis,3cb8am,henrax,0,Mon Jul 6 23:29:22 2015 UTC,"I understand your point but I think that in this case it's taking it too far. You can't fine a player for playing badly. Every time a player makes a fault he ""harms the experience of the fans"". They pay to see tennis players play tennis, you don't know if they are going to play well. Sometimes they are, sometimes they don't. Once again, maybe if he didn't have his little ""nervous breakdown"" he would not have played better later and would have harmed even more the fans experience. We don't know what went through his head at this point.  I understand that the players can't do whatever they want, but they can play at whatever level they want. Breaking a racket, insulting some one, those acts should be punished (as they are). Being so bad that it seems intentional should not in my opinion.  You have the right to not have a strong head game, for me it's the exact same thing as being fined for having a bad forehand. He played bad because he was frustrated and couldn't focus on his game. It's a weakness, you can hate him for it, but punish him with a fine is too harsh imo. And if Gasquet is distracted because his opponent is bad it's his fault. It happens often and that's part of the game.  Also, seeing the popularity of Kyrgios I don't think that it's leading fans away from tennis."
tennis,3cb8am,beepbloopbloop,2,Mon Jul 6 23:42:07 2015 UTC,"It's not about fining him for playing badly. He was obviously not even trying on the points, and that harms the viewability and integrity of the competition."
tennis,3cb8am,machidaad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:51:10 2015 UTC,for a few points. mental lapses happen all the time. bad strategies that last an entire game are even worse. the only reason I can see him being pointed out is because it was more blatant.

I don't think it takes from the integrity of the sport to have both positive and negative attitudes to draw more people into the sport."
tennis,3cb8am,tvrwazza,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:41:46 2015 UTC,"This incident takes me back to a similar one happened in another sport and it is Cricket. This requires a bit of knowledge reagarding some of the cricketing terminology being used and I will try my best to explain most of them. Back in 2010 when India played Srilanka (Two big cricketing nations) in an One Day International match (a game of cricket played between two teams and each team get to Bat for 50 overs and bowl for 50 overs, again each over consists of 6 legal balls to be bowled and the rules that define the ball bowled as legal are many but one of the variant of the illegal ball bowled is a 'No-Ball'. Where a bowler has to bowl the ball by not stepping past a line at the time of releasing the ball off his/her hand. An illegal ball bowled will grant the batting team automatic runs and will be counted towards extras and not to towards the batsmen's score but will add up to the team total, so in tennis words its like a double fault.)   The incident: India required 1 run to win the match. Indian batsmen (Virender Sehwag) was on 99, 1 short of a century (100, getting this score is a big deal in cricket for a batsmen). The srilankan bowler (Suraj Randiv) deliberately bowled a No-Ball to deny the batsmen (Virender Sehwag) his century but letting the match finish as that would award the batting team a run and in this situation a victory. Why give away the run and let the opposition win? Because the bating team (India) had ample amount of balls to be faced and there was no way they could lose out in the match. So this 'bowling a No-Ball deliberately and denying the batsmen the run is not considered an offense under any rule in cricket, but the bowler was suspended for his next match. This is in spirit of the game and the Srilankan Cricket Board (Srilanka's governing body of cricket) also apologized and they were the one who suspended him not the ICC (International Cricket Council). Links to the incident  1  2  3  In relation with this incident: What Nick did might not have been similar in terms of denying the opponent something but it counts up as not showing the spirit towards the game, not respecting the opponent as well as the fans. He should also keep in mind that he needs to represent his country in a respectable manner. This fine of $2000 might not be enough but that's not the question here. People should get the message that this sport will not tolerate such unspirited behavior."

'Tactically tanking' a serve receive game is commonplace against a hard-serving opponent like Federer explained (https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/3cfiuj/roger_federer_defends_kyrgios_over_tanking_issue/).  'Openly taking' however is frowned upon, and deservingly so.

tennis,3cct7i,compuzr,3,Tue Jul 7 04:04:43 2015 UTC,Yes I think Dimitrov needs a coach who is smart with the tactical side of tennis and Annacone fits that description. It certainly helps that part of Dimitrov's game seems to be modeled after Roger whom Annacone had success coaching.

Gasquet was a saint for putting up with and getting through."
tennis,3cao1r,Irishane,10,Tue Jul 7 05:29:23 2015 UTC,lol the crowd shouts in the middle of the points during murray matches. 10x worse than the fanatics who are quiet once players are ready.
tennis,3cao1r,plump1234,4,Mon Jul 6 15:38:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe because they're all Aussie die hard tennis fans and none of the other fans are?  It's nice to watch Andy for the first few games, until he or the opponent starts bouncing the ball just before the serve hearing 'C'mon Andy!!' 'Let's go Andy, take this!!' and all that is annoying for the rest of the match. Some go noticed some unnoticed because there are more than 5 doing it."
tennis,3cao1r,HeelR-,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:21:23 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. Granted fans do shout a ""come on"" in between points when other players are playing but the Australian fans take it to another level.  I'm not against the enthusiasm, it's great at the Australian Open or the US, but there is a certain tradition of decorum at Wimbledon which I think would be nice if it were observed and respected. I feel the same about any sets of fans who are obnoxiously loud at Wimbledon.  I've also noticed that more and more in tennis, fans take longer to quieten down between games, needing the umpire to verbally ask them to. This I find really disrespectful to the players."
tennis,3cao1r,jw2498,7,Mon Jul 6 18:11:26 2015 UTC,"At least the fans keep it to between points though, still gets annoying but they are well behaved during points mostly. Wimbledon crowd is generally awful, so much cheering during points, booing etc. Very annoying to watch."

Based on the fine they gave him, it looks like they were trying to make it match the prize money for a 4th-round loser: http://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/Wimbledon_Prize_Money_2015.pdf  In other words, they're sending the message that you're not going to earn money by not trying."

The big deal would have been if he continued with that attitude for the rest of the match but he didn't and made the last 2 sets close.

tennis,3cckjv,rbace,13,Tue Jul 7 03:00:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you, guy with more credibility than a prestigious big time tennis journalist who was actually there."
tennis,3cckjv,KyleG,3,Tue Jul 7 04:09:53 2015 UTC,"just go watch he match and see if you see a lack of effort. You can appeal to authority all you want, and i still disagree with his assessment."
tennis,3cckjv,rbace,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:29:11 2015 UTC,you cannot see minute reductions in racket speed by watching his matches on tv.
tennis,3cckjv,raftah99,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:43:19 2015 UTC,"So because his racket head speed went down he wasn't trying? Nadal ""hasn't tried"" all year."
tennis,3cckjv,rbace,0,Tue Jul 7 17:24:26 2015 UTC,"And to be honest, what are the chances federer loses a 6-0 set in 27 minutes if he's trying?   Not high, obviously, but it's a reflection only of how Fed was being outplayed in that set. He has bagelled the other Big 4 players numerous times, but you wouldn't say they weren't trying.  Federer may not have been giving his 100% in that last set, but Kygrios threw that game worse than some players do when delibrately tanking a fixed match."
tennis,3cckjv,Lumos309,9,Tue Jul 7 04:11:50 2015 UTC,"There's a big difference between being thoroughly whipped by your opponent where nothing you can throw at them is working, and walking to the other side of the court as the opponent's serve is coming to you."
tennis,3cckjv,nankerjphelge,3,Mon Jul 6 22:29:13 2015 UTC,"Federer did not want to be out there that last set and it showed. What I'm trying to say is that all guys get frustrated by missed chances, their opponents level, or something else and this translates to not giving their best effort to various degrees. Some guys let it ruin their whole match others can get over it after a slump. Kygrios let it get to him for a couple points and that's something he needs to work on."
tennis,3cckjv,plump1234,6,Mon Jul 6 23:09:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but again there's a difference between not giving your best effort, and what Kyrgios did, which was to not even try at all.  Never has Federer done something like that."
tennis,3cckjv,nankerjphelge,6,Tue Jul 7 02:20:03 2015 UTC,"You're on every thread complaining about ""this sub's hate"" for Kyrgios. The opinion here is not unusual, go to any other forum, Twitter, Facebook, whatever and you'll see an equal amount of hate if not more. His attitude is inevitably going to cause this, I don't understand how you can't see that even if you're fine with it. The likes of Fognini and Janowicz also generate this reaction but of course it's going to be magnified for Kyrgios as he's touted as the future of tennis."
tennis,3cckjv,c3vzn,0,Tue Jul 7 01:03:41 2015 UTC,Calls for him to be suspended obviously come from the fact that he is not liked. Pretty big over reaction. I know he's a dick and will never be liked.
tennis,3cckjv,plump1234,3,Tue Jul 7 01:28:43 2015 UTC,"No, the people calling for the suspension are trying to make him become more well liked. Not saying he deserves a suspension (yet), but it would definitely make him think twice about his action. What do you do to a child when they act out? You punish them in a way that restricts them, therefore they know not to do that action again."
tennis,3cckjv,Wigley123,-2,Tue Jul 7 02:39:27 2015 UTC,Basically people are calling for Kyrgios to be punished harder than actual dopers.
tennis,3cckjv,KyleG,2,Tue Jul 7 04:10:45 2015 UTC,"Play stupid games...wind stupid prizes. ;) Seriously though... if you're going to half-ass it on the court, admit what you did and don't claim you were ""trying to hit the ball."" I'd have more faith in him if he'd at least be honest. Sounds to me like his handlers got ahold of him and mentioned it would cost him upwards of $100K fine if it's found he didn't try to hit those balls.

tennis,3cckjv,dogballs8,3,Tue Jul 7 03:21:49 2015 UTC,Props to the journalist for pressing him on the game he threw. A blind person could've seen that he tanked those three points.
tennis,3cckjv,Lumos309,2,Tue Jul 7 04:14:41 2015 UTC,Really? Is he gonna sit there and praise Gasquet's serve? What the hell have we come to? It was obvious he didn't give two shits out there and he's being a dick about it.
tennis,3cckjv,Eagled1001,2,Mon Jul 6 22:22:03 2015 UTC,I truly feel for him. The way the media and general public are treating him is disgraceful.
tennis,3cckjv,squidjellyfish,3,Tue Jul 7 05:20:06 2015 UTC,"The guy had a meltdown. Is he being a baby/immature? Yes, but at the same time let's not forget he's only 20. Most 20 year olds are not anywhere near mature, especially him who has been thrown into the spotlight as possibly a future fantastic player, if not one of the next greats, for the past year.  At the same time, not even I give up points as badly as he did, and I start getting frustrated if I lose the first two games of the first set."
tennis,3cckjv,FlirtinMurgen,23,Mon Jul 6 21:31:59 2015 UTC,"Most 20 year olds are not any near mature   To be fair, he comes across as less mature than any other 20 year old on the tour.  I'm around the same age and play tennis (obviously at a lot lower level with a lot less pressure), and I haven't played against anyone who's thrown these style of tantrums since I was about 14.  He could be such a great player but his attitude is holding him back at the moment and it's making it really difficult for people to support him."

tennis,3cckjv,Kitaoji,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:12:45 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand why it would bother people how he acts lol. I hate majority of the fake nice act infront of press conferences. He's young and was clearly mad at maybe how good Gasquet was doing,, and then he lost, and they then wanted to ask him questions about it. Now many people can easily answer that, or say politely they do not wanna answer it, but that's fake and media training. This guy is just real."
tennis,3cckjv,Count_Critic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:20:51 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, it's an individual sport, he's only hurting himself. Of course if it were a team sport his attitude would be unacceptable but as it is it really doesn't affect anyone but himself and after that one game he came back and won the 3rd set and almost the 4th so it's not a huge deal.  And I don't usually like it when people defend an asshole by saying ""oh it's good for the sport"" or ""it's entertaining so who cares"" but I'm kind of in that camp with Nick. Because while I didn't like what he did, it was interesting and when I saw the bit with him arguing with the umpire about changing his socks and asking Richard Gasquet if he was cool with it I couldn't help but lol. So I agree about the fake thing, there's more than a few players I don't like for being bland and uninteresting or being a shitty person and then playing up the niceties when they remember the cameras and these are players with 10+ majors as well."
tennis,3cckjv,Kitaoji,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:33:52 2015 UTC,"Ye exactly. And really, 1 game where he's just like ""fuck it."" honestly I've seen it so many times. Just not as blatantly obvious as what Nick did, that's all.  And if he's not in the best of moods after a loss and not responding politely, it's perfectly normal. He's not cursing them out or something.  This might also come from the fact Andy Roddick is my fav player ever, on court and off court. As his press conferences were hilarious, but he could also have quite an attitude. I like that. It shows real emotion."
tennis,3cckjv,Idontlikekarmawhores,0,Wed Jul 8 05:36:47 2015 UTC,"He looks like on of those romanian gypsis, is he decendent of gypsis?"
tennis,3cdtya,amneziac1,14,Tue Jul 7 03:25:30 2015 UTC,"Federer has been playing really good so far, honestly at times I've felt like I've been watching the Fed of five years ago, it's been great. But saying that, his draw has been relatively easy. He's yet to come up against a true threat and I'm still unsure how well he'll hold himself when he does, which will most likely be against Murray.   I think he's definitely in with a chance at the final if he can take down Murray, and man a Wawrinka/Fed final would just be magic, and I think he could even have the ability to take Stan down. I really hope he does, I just wanna see one last grand slam win from the guy, and I think this may be one of his last real chances. But if it's Djokovic he comes up against in the final, I don't believe he'll be able to pull that off."
tennis,3cdtya,bitchdantkillmyvibe,2,Tue Jul 7 03:34:17 2015 UTC,"I agree about being his last real chance.  Its hard to imagine him doing this in another grand slam.  Murray will be tough, but Fed has the edge on him I think in grand slams.  Djokovic though, has a much tougher run.  He has to finish this match with Anderson, then Cilic, then Stan."
tennis,3cdtya,bitchdantkillmyvibe,3,Tue Jul 7 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I find it hard to see, Wimbledon has always been his best court and he has been gifted with an incredible draw really, it's obvious Fed only has a few years left and more and more rising stars are coming to take over the reigns.   He does have the edge on Murray I think so I can definitely see him taking Murray down but it will be tough. Djoko does have a very tough run to the final, but if he makes it which he is very capable of doing, I just don't see him then going on to lose to Fed but who knows. Regardless, I'm rooting Federer all the way, I watched him win so many of his grand slams as a kid, it'd be so special to see him do it one last time as an adult (missed actually watching him win his 2012 slam which I will forever regret)"
tennis,3cdtya,Personacorona,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:55:13 2015 UTC,"His next best chance is at New York, and if he plays as well as he did in Dubai and Brisbane he can really do it."
tennis,3cdtya,Personacorona,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:22:44 2015 UTC,The Fed of five years ago lost in the QF's. I'd say he's more like the Fed of 3 years ago.
tennis,3cdtya,TalentedMyAss,-1,Tue Jul 7 13:24:29 2015 UTC,"And nearly got beaten in straight sets (and then after winning the 3rd, had to break to stay in the match in the 4th) against Alejandro Falla in the 1st round. Then couldn't return Bozoljac's serve in the 2nd round and it went 4.   Talented, dominant grass courter my ass."
tennis,3cdtya,artistec,2,Wed Jul 8 03:26:55 2015 UTC,"It would be great if he won, wouldn't it? I think he'll get past Simon. Murray will be a problem as will be the final, if he gets that far. I don't see him beating Djokovic, but maybe Wawrinka who's less experienced on grass."
tennis,3cdtya,Volvulus,2,Tue Jul 7 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"Agree with others that it's hard to say, but he was gifted a pretty easy draw with Nadal out (which definitely helps, even if Nadal is not in great playing shape nowadays).   Just wanted to throw in that he has been so untested, not only has he not dropped a set, he hasn't even been broken. On top of that, he has only faced 2 break points against Querrey. That's pretty incredible. I think the way he's been playing has been phenomenal, but I don't know if he can keep that up over the possible next 3 matches to close it out.   Edit: Oh yeah, dropped a set against Groth. I'd rather not remember that though. Thanks binks21"
tennis,3cdtya,binks21,3,Tue Jul 7 09:23:18 2015 UTC,"actually he did drop a set against Groth. it was a tie break however, so you are right that he has not yet been broken. and I agree that he's playing fabulous tennis at the moment and a lot has to do with that serve working so well for him. can he keep it up though for another 3 matches is another question entirely. his opponents and matches will get tougher now and he does tend to lose it rather suddenly on occasion."

You think about Simon and you expect him to be some scrappy pusher, but then you actually see him play against Federer and he turns into a ball machine with perfect movement. Federer may as well be playing Djokovic in this QF...it wouldn't be any more difficult."

tennis,3cc06i,KetamineClive,9,Mon Jul 6 20:44:14 2015 UTC,It will improve a lot if Anderson upsets Djokovic.
tennis,3cc06i,dropshot,18,Mon Jul 6 20:47:58 2015 UTC,Stan lost the last 4 matches against Anderson. He beat Djokovic last time they played.  Though I'm sure he'd rather play Anderson.
tennis,3cc06i,SwissBliss,5,Mon Jul 6 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"If Djokovic advances, you have 3 GS winners in that half. And there are no flukes when you win a GS in this era (since 2003). In my opinion, don't count out Cilic, who reminds me of Marat Safin. He and Stan hits the ball very hard and both can be fearless. They have the ingredients to beat Djokovic if Kevin Anderson doesn't.  However, this is not the hard court however, where upsets can happen often. It's been very hard to break through on SW19 grass, with only 4 different winners in the last decade (all members of the Big 4). Obviously for me, the 5 GS winners are all capable of winning, with higher percentages going to Federer, Murray, Djokovic, in that order. It'll be an upset if it's not one of those 3 lifting the trophy this Sunday."
tennis,3cc06i,gg_2015,3,Mon Jul 6 21:58:33 2015 UTC,You'd put Fed and Murray as more likely to win than Novak?!

tennis,3cc06i,KyleG,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:05:05 2015 UTC,before mysteriously losing focus   You mean before no longer playing out of his mind. Stan on grass is not the same person as Stan on clay or the slow hardcourt of the AO because of the extra time he takes to wind up for his big shots.
tennis,3cc06i,KyleG,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:16:33 2015 UTC,"Stan's best surface is clay and worst is grass because his big time shots require slightly more time to set up for. If he were to make it to the final, he has zero chance of beating Fed, if that's who he met."
tennis,3cc06i,red_280,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:14:25 2015 UTC,Higher than they should be for a guy who's not great on grass. I think its a pretty great achievement for him to have made two QFs in a row despite never getting beyond the 4R previously (and usually falling much earlier). Kind of funny how being a recent GS champ (even if the last one was on clay) has boosted his stocks massively.

Click on the player's rankings breakdown, and it's the points from the top non-countable tournament.   What it's doing as part of that list, I have no clue. The information is largely useless, and it's garbage design to put it there. Most of the time players can't just sub in the ""next best"" if they bomb the current tournament, particularly the top players who have direct entries into all the required events."
tennis,3cdh8s,GTASanAndreasLubitz,2,Tue Jul 7 06:23:04 2015 UTC,"An ATP ranking is determined by your ""best 18"" events subject to a bunch of rules.  That means that it's possible there are events that you've earned points for but doesn't count to the best 18 (since your best 18 are better than these points).  However, they can count if points drop off and one of the events that didn't count can now count.  At least, that's my guess."
tennis,3cegsq,Gay_Wolverine,2,Tue Jul 7 07:29:43 2015 UTC,"I think the break may help Anderson actually, Djokovic clearly had the momentum last night and probably would have finished it had play been shifted to centre court.  Now Anderson has time to regroup and it's basically a 1 set shootout, so anything is possible. Wouldn't be surprised if Anderson pulled it off."
tennis,3cegsq,rafessi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:38:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like a well rested Novak could beat a well rested Anderson. Maybe its just me, but Anderson was playing some of the best tennis of his life in the first 2 sets and towards the end of the 4th you could see glimpses of that same guy coming out again. It'd be hard to replicate that same performance again on a different day. I hope the break works in Anderson's favour but personally, with Novak's performance this season, forgive me for been doubtful for the same."
tennis,3cegsq,rafessi,3,Tue Jul 7 07:52:15 2015 UTC,"Novak is the favorite because of his mental fortitude, but if Anderson can play as well as he did in those first 2 sets, and get Djokovic a bit rattled anything is possible. I'm not ruling out an upset."

tennis,3c9w6e,red_280,10,Mon Jul 6 07:24:38 2015 UTC,"Well one of the calls he got pissed about (where he threatened to stop playing lol) was genuinely a wrong call, all the commentators and even the court official agreed with Nick that he was right, but that simply, there's nothing he can do about it. You can see how such a thing would be quite annoying, especially when it lead to a converted break point for the opponent."
tennis,3c9w6e,bitchdantkillmyvibe,5,Mon Jul 6 07:51:25 2015 UTC,"Well, debating calls that can't be changed is something that even Roger does.

That there's no way it was a deliberate act by Karlovic - there's no way he had time to react to that."
tennis,3c9w6e,sarmatron,2,Mon Jul 6 18:03:16 2015 UTC,"If it's unintended, how does his racket change direction towards the ball after making contact with it?"
tennis,3c9w6e,S14Vine,3,Mon Jul 6 18:08:56 2015 UTC,Because he's following the motion through. As he hit the ball his wrist is bent backwards but his arm is still moving forwards. This means that his racket moves back a little then changes direction but it's still one continuous motion as the slo-mo massively exaggerates the effect. Human reaction times are not quick enough to account for the change in direction so it is not counted as a double hit.
tennis,3c9w6e,edgeoftheworld42,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:55:33 2015 UTC,"Possibly because he's lunging forward, off balance. Pretty common to revert your hands to a palm down position (which would cause his racquet to come forward too).   We're talking a fraction of a second here.  There's just no way a human reacted that quickly."

tennis,3c9w6e,Drilski,8,Mon Jul 6 11:00:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah god forbid any young player show a bit of emotion and be something other than a fucking tennis automaton. I love Federer as much as the next guy but come on, I appreciate Raonic v Kyrgios is an absurd contrast but how could you look at Raonic and be excited by him as a player or a court presence? His on court demeanor is designed to unnerve his opponent and Kyrgios was completely unfazed by it; I'd rather see more Kyrgiosesque players to actually make these matches a bit more entertaining.  Yeah sure Kyrgios could tone down some things but he's hardly a football player is he, not like he's running at a ref and screaming obscenities at him. People need to lighten up and let him be a character, if you want tennis to be just human shaped things in white playing in different ways go fund an MIT program to make tennis robots."
tennis,3c9w6e,sidskorna,4,Mon Jul 6 11:53:55 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of ways to be colorful without looking like a moron. Did you catch his antics in the 2nd set against Gasquet today - giving up on 3 straight points? Did that excite you?   Honestly, I wouldn't mind a bit of drama if I thought his outbursts were 100% genuine. See my link above above about his Beats ads."
tennis,3c9w6e,Drilski,0,Mon Jul 6 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I was a bit disappointed he gave up, but, at the same time, it made it pretty interesting in the third and fourth set. I mean I actually just laughed at my TV when he hit those shit returns in the 2nd (?) game of that set.  Are you seriously suggesting he gave up on a set because he's sponsored by Beats? I mean ye, Beats are bad, commercial, overpriced headphones and the target demographic isn't your average middle aged tennis fan who thinks Nick Kyrgios is nothing but a cunt, but he's a young marketable player who's known for colourful play and colourful behaviour. In the tennis world, that's about as close you're gonna get to an actual brand ambassador for Beats."
tennis,3c9w6e,sidskorna,3,Mon Jul 6 13:56:23 2015 UTC,"Dude, your comprehension skills are lacking. I said his tank job wasn't exciting to watch.  All I'm suggesting with the Beats ads is that he is being marketed as a rebel and he is playing it up a bit more than his usual self."
tennis,3c9w6e,Drilski,2,Mon Jul 6 14:06:40 2015 UTC,"Oh fair enough, I thought you were saying he tanked it because of the Beats sponsorship in order to play up the match and add some spice."
tennis,3c9w6e,LoveFifty,0,Mon Jul 6 15:28:30 2015 UTC,"and be excited by him as a player   If he plays good tennis, he should excite tennis fans as a player.   or a court presence?    Different strokes for different folks, but many people don't care for such presence (I actually admire Raonic for his). I'd have enjoyed Kyrgios' game a lot more if there was a little less showing off.  I do, however, understand that he's young and hope he'll just grow out of it eventually."
tennis,3c9w6e,Drilski,6,Mon Jul 6 13:20:05 2015 UTC,"If he plays good tennis, he should excite tennis fans as a player.   Ye good, let's just replace everyone with clones of Federer at his peak then. Or robots. Whichever plays the better tennis, I guess?  You admire Raonic for showing what, nothing? Do you admire people who paint their car silver? It's just a tactic to try and intimidate his opponent, and it's incredibly boring to watch."
tennis,3c9w6e,LoveFifty,0,Mon Jul 6 13:59:48 2015 UTC,"Whichever plays the better tennis, I guess?   As I said, different strokes. Some people watch tennis, some just want a soap opera."

tennis,3c9w6e,sidskorna,0,Mon Jul 6 13:39:42 2015 UTC,Kyrgios is just a pawn of his sponsor. He has to live up to the reputation flogged in this Beats ad - https://youtu.be/-rMrkyMn-sY
tennis,3c9w6e,egn56,15,Mon Jul 6 11:05:48 2015 UTC,"He had this reputation before his beats ad. Besides how is this any different than a young Andre Agassi. Who boycotted Wimbledon for it's dress code, would wear ridiculous outfits and his own attitude and on court antic issues? Or a young John McEnroe who was full of colorful language and couldn't help but fight line judges. He's 19, he's immature, and he's been suddenly thrust into an international spotlight. He has some growing up to do, but he's not the first and won't be the last to have this type of reputation/attitude on court."
tennis,3c9w6e,sidskorna,2,Mon Jul 6 13:45:09 2015 UTC,He's not 19. He's 20. Hewitt was a Grand Slam champion at 20. And people thought he was bad... Kyrgios makes Hewitt look like a monk.  I know what his reputation was. I'm just suggesting that he's playing it up a bit more now that he is more well known and is being marketed as a rebel who screams and smashes rackets.
tennis,3c9w6e,plenty_of_time,3,Mon Jul 6 14:05:43 2015 UTC,"Kyrgios does not make Hewitt look like a monk. Hewitt was higher profile, more of an asshole rather than just immature and bad tempered, and more disliked."
tennis,3c9w6e,sarmatron,3,Mon Jul 6 15:39:34 2015 UTC,I think you might need to research Lleyton a bit. He was straight-up racist and hated by a lot of his peers. Kyrgios is just an immature bro.

I don't like how lots of my fellow Aussies love to hate on Tomic when his on court behaviour has always been a lot better than Kyrgios'. I don't think I have ever seen him be rude or disrespectful to an umpire or his opponent, let alone the ball boys and crowd.   I remember in the Australian Open 2014 where he was called 'Tomic the Tank engine' in the press for pulling out in the second set of his first round match against Nadal. But it wasn't acknowledged by anyone in the press, that they had mad a mistake, when he had surgery immediately after the open and was out for months."

tennis,3c9w6e,Reddits_Worst_Night,2,Mon Jul 6 11:42:26 2015 UTC,I think in the case of double hits it's the umpire's job. There are no 'double hit judges' afterall?

tennis,3cb2w2,jpkx72,22,Mon Jul 6 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of these answers are close, and capture the essence but not the exact answer: They are simply selecting which ball they want to use. It doesn't necessarily have to do with fuzz or size of ball. They will look for balls that look and feel ""newer"" meaning less string marks on the ball, less fuzz, less wear and tear, etc. Plus, an added benefit is they get to ""control"" which ball they give back, adding an element of control to what's going on out on court, which is important to a player. You can't complain about the ball if you chose it."
tennis,3cb2w2,quickexc,5,Mon Jul 6 16:20:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of time its the fuzz on the ball but do take into account that the pros are pretty much always using fresh balls too. Yes they hit very hard but you even then, you can't really tell the difference between fresh balls after 1-2 games unless there were a slew of intense rallies or Karlovic hit 8 aces with the same ball. Sometimes its noticeable but for the most part its just to give them time to think. I sometimes do it too, picking up 3-4 balls instead of 2 then tossing the extra 1-2 behind me."

tennis,3cb2w2,hoglahoo,10,Mon Jul 6 14:57:19 2015 UTC,Honestly 99% of the time there is no real difference in the balls - it's mental on the part of the player. But yeah generally you want a newer ball to get more pop on your serve.
tennis,3cb2w2,politelycorrect,13,Mon Jul 6 16:46:45 2015 UTC,Amount of fuzz can affect a ball so it depends on what type of serve they're planning or just preference. The fuzz also tells you how fresh vs dead a ball is.
tennis,3cb2w2,kuyakew,5,Mon Jul 6 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"Embarrassing moment regarding chosen tennis balls that I witnessed live at the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany: James Blake was playing against Tomas Berdych (the eventual winner of the tournament that year) in an early round. Nearly every time Blake hit a ball into the net because he wasn't positioned correctly, he asked to inspect the ball as if the ball were at fault. As he continued to make bad plays, then examine each ball, the crowd began lightly grumbling. It was embarrassing to be an American rooting for a fellow American in that match."
tennis,3cb2w2,totosmaster,2,Mon Jul 6 16:14:52 2015 UTC,I'm assuming if theres any sign of fuzz on the ball
tennis,3cb2w2,mesutwilshere12,2,Mon Jul 6 15:00:32 2015 UTC,They're just picking the smallest balls because it means they are the less damaged and can serve better with them.

tennis,3cb2w2,melodicsyrup,2,Mon Jul 6 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"Why all the hate? When I say smaller it means the balls with the less ""fuzz"" on it, essentially what everyone else is saying ..."

tennis,3cb2w2,hoglahoo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know what players look for, but as far as the physics of projectiles goes, it could depend on the kind of serve s/he wants to hit. Because the seams in a sports ball affect its drag (be it baseball, volleyball, tennis hour or some other sport), they are key in using spin to manipulate a ball's trajectory.   If a tennis player intends to use a lot of spin on an upcoming serve such as a kick serve, they might actually benefit from using a ball that has slightly more pronounced or deeper seams than another, or might even opt to use a ball that has a defect at the seam where part of the adhesive material is sticking out. These variances will always occur in things that are mass produced, and technically will make spin affect the ball differently, even if only slightly or perhaps negligibly.  And, of course, there's the fuzz others have mentioned, which can affect a ball's speed by creating more air resistance with more fuzz and vice versa."
tennis,3cb2w2,furious_20,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:51:03 2015 UTC,"If you had three balls and could examine them before use to pick the two best ones, wouldn't you do it too?"
tennis,3cb2w2,jfoobar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:50:51 2015 UTC,"That was my thought, as well. And it seems that is the entire point of providing three balls to the players: to provide them with a choice and a sense of control. They get to choose the ball that they serve, so they can't really complain about it. I know it always made me feel better to examine the ball before I served it. I always liked to serve the newest feeling ball on my first serve."

tennis,3cduu4,machidaad,3,Tue Jul 7 05:46:40 2015 UTC,"I think Wozniacki has a point. Venus Williams didn't play a single match on center court until the fourth round with Serena. She owns the most Wimbledon championships behind only Roger Federer in this years tourney. That is a little ridiculous to me.   Women's Tennis is popular in its own right. I'll bet Sharapova and Serena earn more than lots of these men and are more recognizable names around the world, when naming famous tennis players. I don't think it would kill tournament organizers to schedule more women's matches on the big courts. Their matches are shorter and can be equally as entertaining."
tennis,3cduu4,mind_teaser,6,Tue Jul 7 07:50:05 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're talking about the number of grand slams serena and roger have when we are talking viewership.    I don't think it would kill tournament organizers to schedule more women's matches on the big courts.   It wouldn't kill the organizers if they gave more center court time to the german players but thats not the point; the point is that there is no obligation on the tournament give the WTA more center court time. Its also not fair to fans who pay to see what they want.
tennis,3cduu4,machidaad,6,Tue Jul 7 09:48:56 2015 UTC,"I mean the only thing I feel is sexist is limiting women's matches to 3 sets rather than 5. Complaining about courts is nonsense, courts are selected based on who will draw crowds, not gender."

tennis,3cduu4,DilbertsBeforeSwine,9,Tue Jul 7 07:22:20 2015 UTC,"Well personally I'm against that. I think it should be chosen based on merit (i.e. Popularity) rather than gender.

tennis,3cduu4,Takuya-san,8,Tue Jul 7 07:27:02 2015 UTC,"Here in America, that type of sexism is largely ignored because mentioning anything in opposition to something politically correct will leave you labeled (in this case) sexist."

I used to play at a club that required whites, background checks and had few (if any) minorities, and it made me take a really dim view of the sport's elitism.    Even though Kyrgios can be a total asshat I appreciate the fact that he shakes things up. Tennis needs an injection of youth, modernization and especially inclusiveness. People used to say a lot of the same things about Agassi, but in retrospect he was one of the best things that ever happened to the sport.   Many people on here are blaming Beats for his attitude (see the Tsonga / Kyrgios thread), which to me speaks to a broader cultural elitism. One of the best things about the sport is that it features colorful people from all over the world. And Nick Kyrgios, if anything else, is colorful."
tennis,3c9tgl,BehroozAraz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:48:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can compare him to Agassi.

tennis,3caomc,BeanMuffin,11,Mon Jul 6 12:43:09 2015 UTC,"If you divide the area of a tennis court by the cross-sectional area of a tennis ball, you get around 53000.  So if the shots were evenly distributed it would take this many shots to cover the court.  As a very rough guess, if there are about 200 points in a 3 out of 5 match, and about 5 shots per point, that means it would take 53 matches.  In a grand slam tournament (let's just take the men's singles for simplicity) there are 127 matches, so this would do it pretty well.  Of course the shots aren't evenly distributed, so in reality the area near the baseline would probably get completely covered, and the rest would be pretty spotty."
tennis,3caomc,painfive,-2,Mon Jul 6 15:07:33 2015 UTC,"Your logic is wrong. 53000 shots is the minimum amount, the average is *much * more. Think of it as numbers, if you had x numbers, would you need on average 6 guesses? No, it's the minimum.   Also, you are second argument is wrong. The rest of the court(except baseline) world not be pretty spotty, as serves would cause the distribution to even a little bit."
tennis,3caomc,RogerFedererFTW,2,Mon Jul 6 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"By evenly distributed I meant placed deliberately to cover the maximum area.  I agree if it was random it would take much longer to cover every single spot, although after 53000 a large percentage would be covered.  And, yes, the area near the service lines would also have a lot of balls."
tennis,3caomc,painfive,-1,Mon Jul 6 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"Oh i see. Saying that something is evenly distributed usually means random distribution, so i misunderstood.  By the way, fun fact: The probability of hitting all the spots in exactly 53000 shots by hitting truly randomly, is 1/53000!, which is approximately 10-227372 . If we have 100 trillion universes, and each universe has 100 trillion galaxies, and each galaxy has 100 trillion stars, and each star has 100 trillion  planets, and each planet has 100 trillion people, and each people has one hundred trillion computers, and each computer run one hundred trillion programs which trie a set of 53000 tries 100 trillion times per second for 100 trillion years, we would on average have a chance of 133/227232 .

We've seen so many great Wimby finals from Fed recently (08 Nadal, 09 Roddick, 14 Djokovic). It indeed could have been a golden year for Federer but the hard courts undid him.  Sobbing after succumbing to Nadal in 5 sets to start the yr in Australia, then finally winning the French and reclaiming Wimbledon in that aforementioned final vs Roddick, then collapsed in 5 sets against Del Potro. He was in all 4 finals that yr (3rd or 4th time he's done it in his career) but too bad he only won 2. Still one of the best yrs of his career."

tennis,3ca4qv,duskhat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:30:30 2015 UTC,As a Rafa fan I'm not sure how I missed him
tennis,3ca4qv,gg_2015,2,Mon Jul 6 17:03:05 2015 UTC,Prob bc in the last 5-6 yrs he's only showed up for the 3-4 mo stretch for the clay and grass season. It's sad he's been gone so much since his last great season 2010.
tennis,3ca4qv,dropshot,13,Mon Jul 6 17:40:53 2015 UTC,"First, I have to say, we're in an era where most players have fantastic passing shots.  Nearly every top player can hit anywhere inside the service box when passing, even against the best players (e.g., against Federer, Nadal, etc).  And by nearly every top player, I mean, in the top 40.  If only Djokovic, Federer, Nadal, and Murray were the best passers, then other players could still come to net against lower ranked players.  Among today's players, I'd say Nadal does the best in purely defensive shots.  He gets winners when he's falling off-balance, many meters behind the baseline.  It's the reason he's won so many titles.  It's really hard to attack Nadal.  I also happen to like Murray as a passer because some players, most notably, Michael Llodra, have tried to repeatedly attack him, and when Murray gets in a rhythm, he can make a lot of passes.  Federer, by contrast, seems to struggle a little if his opponent attacks a lot (see Stakhovsky).  If you go into the past, I'd look at Ivan Lendl.  Lendl has a period of time (around 1982) where he beat McEnroe 7 times in a row, and McEnroe was number 1 back then.  When you can force a serve and volleyer to play baseline because he thinks he's going to pass you, that's tough.  McEnroe eventually reversed some results when he decided to come to net regardless of how often he got passed.  Lendl was able to create an intimidation factor by aiming directly at a player, esp. McEnroe, and would frequently hit him.  I'm surprised we don't see that much hitting the player these days as intimidation.  Later in his career, Lendl added the slice backhand to his repertoire, and used the slice as a passing shot, which was impressive for its time.  If you look at the women's side, then you have to look at Chris Evert, who played a steady flat style, and whose backhand was more solid than her forehand.  Both Evert and Connors had better backhands than forehands.  While you can look at players like Gasquet and Wawrinka as having great backhands, their forehands are still at least as good (maybe not as steady or natural).  I think Connors and Evert truly had weak-ish forehands and they could only realistically generate winners off their backhands (esp. Connors)."
tennis,3ca4qv,that-dude-1234,7,Mon Jul 6 10:51:29 2015 UTC,"Nadal's forehand down-the-line and Djokovic's backhand cross-court have already been mentioned.  But another worthy mention is Fed's flick backhand pass, rarely seen since his decline. He actually used to be famous for it, and it was very consistent too. Here's one instance against Djokovic in 2008."
tennis,3ca4qv,Personacorona,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:23:58 2015 UTC,Fed also did this quite a lot during his prime
tennis,3ca4qv,TareXmd,3,Mon Jul 6 14:09:03 2015 UTC,"Nadal... Largely due to his ridiculous top spin that makes the ball reach places it normally wouldn't with most players. Also, he used to be so fast on the feet and capable of shifting to  a forehand swing on the backhand side. That said, he lost his top spin and with it the ability to pull those ridiculous shots off."
tennis,3ca4qv,politelycorrect,2,Mon Jul 6 13:52:30 2015 UTC,"If you count both sides it's gotta be Djokovic. Especially when you factor in all surfaces, the sliding thing on his BH side to scoop the ball wherever he wants is amazing.   FH side only, I'd say Rafa."
tennis,3ca4qv,morningelwood,2,Mon Jul 6 10:27:51 2015 UTC,"Ivan Lendl, he consistently made incredible shots in his time, and drove everyone crazy."

tennis,3c8sp9,jacktennisthrow,3,Mon Jul 6 05:37:10 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason Kyrgios' chances are being overrated is because of his Nadal victory last year. If Kyrgios can beat Nadal, and he's improved this year, then there's a small chance he may go all the way. So they're just guarding against Kyrgios defying all odds and sending them bankrupt, at least that's my opinion."
tennis,3c8sp9,StratOCE,3,Mon Jul 6 02:57:47 2015 UTC,"It's overrated, but you're right, it's not completely unwarranted. He beat Nadal when he was world no. 1, so when you pull of something like that it's hard to write off a player completely no matter who they come up against. He has also shown steady, consistent improvement since then, rising almost 100 ranks and beating the likes of Federer and just recently Raonic, which is pretty damn impressive. But reaching the final is unlikely, I think he's got a very good chance of taking out Gasquet, but from there on out he is likely to face some very tough opponents."
tennis,3c8sp9,bitchdantkillmyvibe,2,Mon Jul 6 07:43:46 2015 UTC,"He's got a tough path to the finals though to be honest, if he does win against gasquet, he could be facing Wawrinka next round and possibly Djokovic after that"

Or a team can win the league while scoring fewer goals, or even winning fewer matches (if another team has more draws).   In basketball, baseball, and hockey, a team can advance in a playoff series while scoring fewer points across the entire series.  So it's definitely not unique to tennis, but I get that it's weird to someone new to tennis."

tennis,3c9tul,JohnConnard,2,Mon Jul 6 09:26:56 2015 UTC,"Clay shoes exist, their soles have a specific zigzag pattern, but that doesn't mean other shoes are not acceptable. Nowadays most tennis shoes are of  designed for hard courts, but they are all ok for clay, meaning they won't damage the court. You could even use indoor shoes, or simple Adidas gazelles, the important thing is that the sole is flat to avoid ""digging"" into the clay. Go with your usual tennis shoes if you don't mind ending up with orange shoes, you'll have access to the court, no problem. They won't damage the court and there's simply no way the guy at the front desk knows how to differentiate hard court soles from clay soles."

tennis,3c6lok,tonderstiche,2,Sun Jul 5 13:23:03 2015 UTC,"Anderson dropped sets against Pouille and Ilhan but looked sharp against Mayer. His serve will need to be in top form. He has beaten Novak once but it was back in 2008.  Same for Ivo. Every match he's played against Murray has been tight and if he serves big he has a real chance. For the gamblers out there, I think Ivo over Murray is the most likely upset of the day but obviously still not likely."

tennis,3c6lok,Gumpster07,7,Sun Jul 5 10:08:13 2015 UTC,"Strangely enough, Monday looks set to be such an intriguing day. The all Williams clash should kick start a brilliant day of tennis, and hopefully the clash could deliver that although I feel Venus could get blown away. Radwanska & Jankovic will be a really pulsating battle there, Aga has quietly gone through the gears so far in Week 1 whereas Jankovic will be full of confidence after beating Petra.  The final match to look forward to in the Women's side is probably Azarenka & Bencic, I know Azarenka will be keen to progress, but Bencic seems an exciting prospect for the Women's game.  I have a sneaky suspicion that the Berdych & Simon match will be one of full drama, Berdych had a pretty poor start to his match the other day whilst Simon, managed to find the right gear to see off Monfils last night in such an entertaining tie. Simon has some real weaponry that he's showed up to Wimbledon this time, and I do sense he can push Berdych in this tie.  Troicki & Pospisil will be a good match to keep an eye on, was impressed with both yesterday especially Pospisil in the final set against Ward, I'm not sure what he ended on, but 1st Serve Points won was at 100% up to 6-5 iirc. Incredible sense of composure for a final set despite his massive horror dip in Sets 2 & 3. If these two bring their A games this could be a great treat to watch.  Just for a final watch, I'd actually pick Gasquet & Kyrgios, Gasquet has played incredibly high level tennis for the first three rounds of Wimbledon, and he dismantled an out of sorts Dimitrov in the third round. Meanwhile Kyrgios is his usual ""bullish"" self with no cares in the world just hitting the ball hard and clean and going for every single point. It could be really interesting to see how well Gasquet can deal with the brilliant Kyrgios, I'm not sure who I actually want to see progress here. However it should certainly be an incredible watch.  They are my highlighted matches tomorrow."
tennis,3c6lok,blekginger,3,Sun Jul 5 12:05:41 2015 UTC,"Gasquet-Kyrgios is my pick of the day, and I'd recommend putting money on Kyrgios (I have) if you're into betting, the odds are pretty even between them. Nick won last year, and whilst that was incredibly close (saved 9 MPs), that's definitely gonna work in his favour - he'll get extra confidence from it and it's likely to mess with Richard, who already is fragile mentally. Adding to that - Nick's arguably a better player than last year (I don't remember his backhand working this well before, but I could be wrong there).  Gasquet is definitely in good form, but he's also not that great of a defender and I think Nick's power will allow him to take charge - and if that happens there'll only be one outcome."
tennis,3c6lok,MCallanan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:33:34 2015 UTC,"Yea I disagree. Gasquet at the moment is the better all around tennis player. Like Kyrgios he prefers grass and has had some of his better results on grass. The difference is that Gasquet is playing a style better suited for the grass; attacking with the slice, using directional tennis and coming to the net to volley. Nick is simply go big or go home and has little to no net game.      Gasquet easily beat Kyrgios in Estoril a few months back on clay, which is obviously a different surface, but nonetheless I think it gives him some confidence going into the match. Overall Gasquet is playing his best tennis since 2013.     If Kyrgios was a big underdog I'd throw some money on him.. But with the moneyline being even I don't think the risk outweighs the reward."
tennis,3c6lok,blekginger,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I guess we'll see tomorrow. Kyrgios just seems to be so much of a big occasion player. Inconsistent, but pulls it out for the big ones. I'd actually be surprised if he doesn't beat Gasquet tomorrow."
tennis,3c6lok,MCallanan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"He's had some big match performances yes.. He's also showed his experience or lack thereof in some big situations this year.. The Estoril Final being one of them. I think it could be close and that Kyrgios could certainly pull it out but I also think if Gasquet simply plays his game, the way he did against Dimitrov, he wins. The hype train might be riding a little too high after Kyrgios defeated an injured Milos Raonic."
tennis,3c6lok,alpacafarts,5,Sun Jul 5 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"Very intriguing draw on the women's side. Top half:  Serena vs Venus - should be a good one. And, well excluding the French, Venus has had a great year so far on her own. So glad for her. Prediction: Williams Azarenka va Benic - could be a great match as well. Prediction: Azarenka. Sharapova vs Diyas - I believe it's Diyas' first time making the second week of a major! Still Sharapova looks on key. Prediction: Sharapova. Vandeweghe vs Safarova - Hoping Coco can step up and continue to serve and play well. Safarova has been looking a tad sluggish. Prediction: Coco.  Bottom Half - slightly open field with Halep, Bouchard, and Kvitova all done: Wozniacki vs Muguruza - hard to call, depends on which Muguruza shows up. If it's the streaky one, then I can see Wozniacki squeaking by. Prediction: Wozniacki Bazinsky vs Niculesu - gotta say it's been a great year for both players. Prediction: Timea Orovetsa vs Keys - Uhh to be honest, I have never heard of Keys opponent. Prediction: Keys Radwanska vs Jankovic - could be an awesome match with tons of great shot making. Prediction: Aga!"

Elsewhere, I'm interested to see how Murray handles Big Ivo, and how Goffin does against Stan. And then we have the prospect of Nick making it back to the quarters, and interestingly he has to go through the same guy against whom he had to save a bucketload of MPs last year, but this time I think it will not be that close, Nick in max 4 sets.  Federer and Djokovic will have straightforward wins  Another one I have an eye on is Azarenka vs Bencic, I think Vika will have too much for the youngster but it'll be close."

Some players to watch out for, however are; Berdych as always (who is in Fed's quarter), and Gasquet / Kyrgios who have the game right now to take out Wawa in the Quarters. No matter what happens the Semi's match-ups will look fantastic."
tennis,3c6lok,KeyserSoze96,3,Sun Jul 5 14:02:25 2015 UTC,"I am really looking forward to some of these potential matchups, going to be a fun week."
tennis,3c6lok,abuttfarting,5,Sun Jul 5 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"How does everyone feel about Murray's form? Looked patchy against Seppi, but he got lucky that the Italian completely shit the bed in the last set or it might have gone 5."
tennis,3c6lok,JurgenTheNotSoGerman,11,Sun Jul 5 10:37:10 2015 UTC,"Did Seppi really shit the bed, or did Murray just return to the dominance he showed all game bar the 3rd set"
tennis,3c6lok,rafessi,7,Sun Jul 5 11:33:18 2015 UTC,"He was pretty much cruising for 2 sets and then Seppi takes a MTO and he loses it mentally, like he has done so many times in the past.  I'd say his form is pretty good, but his mental fragility is still very much a cause for concern."
tennis,3c6lok,PheromoneCvlt,5,Sun Jul 5 10:57:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty good - He mentally fell apart in the 3rd set but it doesn't worry me too much. Remeber, he had moments like this in 2013 i.e. the Verdasco match. Seppi played well in the first 2 sets but Murray completely shut him down so I feel quite confident in muzza."
tennis,3c6lok,Valinor_,6,Sun Jul 5 10:57:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but if he has a lapse like that vs Roger or Novak he's snookered"
tennis,3c6lok,Gumpster07,2,Sun Jul 5 13:49:49 2015 UTC,"Roger - Not so much  Novak - yes he'd be snookered.  The reason why I say not much of a deal to Roger, is because Muzza has the game to take it to Roger and arguably now win considering how confident Muzza is on grass. Whereas against Novak I think it'd be a similar pattern to the Aus Open where he'd just think to himself about the past 7 meetings and how he hasn't managed to beat Nole yet.  I know Roger has looked solid so far, he still has big tests yet to come and we don't know if he mentally could break down."
tennis,3c6lok,Personacorona,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:59:42 2015 UTC,"It's not like Murray's played 3 top 5 opponents himself, he still has yet to be tested and Murray's mentality isn't exactly his strength. I think it would be interesting if Roger plays Murray since the jump for Murray between at best a 24th ranked player to 7 times Champion would be far higher than the jump from Berdych(assuming they both get there) to Murray. Plus you can't say that Roger isn't confident on this turf. And Roger can take it to Murray, since Roger would absolutely refuse to let Murray play his game. If they got there I think Roger would come in almost every point. Plus Murray would be thinking about that 6-0 6-1 humiliation on home soil last year."
tennis,3c6lok,bahamut19,2,Sun Jul 5 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"If Murray has any sense at all he should be rationalizing away every result last year as ""it doesn't count because I was coming back from injury.""  Federer can definitely win, but on this year's form I'd put Murray at favourite. He dominated Federer on Centre court before a few years ago in the Olympics - he can do it again.  Djokovic, on the other hand - I think Murray has to beat him here if he gets that far. Right now beating Djokovic is a bit of a barrier that Murray needs to break down if he wants to get back to his pre-back surgery run of success. It's the one surface I'd say Murray has the slight edge, and I think mentally he can have some confidence in the fact that he has never lost a set to Djokovic on grass before. If he fails here, I think he might struggle to win another match against Djokovic for a long while."
tennis,3c6lok,Personacorona,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:37:50 2015 UTC,He dominated Federer on Centre court before a few years ago in the Olympics - he can do it again.   And Federer beat Murray on Centre before. Why can't he do it again? This time hopefully he won't play a 4 hour match before it.
tennis,3c6lok,bahamut19,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:55:31 2015 UTC,"He can, I even said that in my post. But it is less likely that Federer will beat him now than it was in 2012 - the difference in their abilities has shifted in Murray's favour.  The 4 hour match is no excuse, though - Both players are more than used to playing 4 hour matches regularly, both Murray and Federer had the same rest, Murray had (on paper) the tougher semi final opponent, and Federer's inability to finish his match quicker is something that makes him look worse, not better."

tennis,3c6lok,gregorramza,2,Sun Jul 5 22:21:19 2015 UTC,My predictions:  -I don't think Anderson can push Novak. He only has a big-serve and I am pretty sure that Djoko can handle it: Nole  -Actually I don't know how Bautista Agut played in this tournament so far but Fed won't lose: Fed  -I have an odd feeling about Ivo. I feel he will reach the quarters. His serves are fast and well-angled. It is nearly impossible to break him. I expect a 4 tie-break and as I say: Ivo  -Stan will probably struggle against Goffin but I think he will get through: Stan  -Berdych would be the opponent of Fed:Berdych  -Cilic won't let there be a surprise: Cilic  -I really love Gasquet but Kyrgios would reach the QF:Kyrgios  -Troicki?
tennis,3c6lok,blekginger,2,Sun Jul 5 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"He only has a big-serve and I am pretty sure that Djoko can handle it   Novak generally has it hard against big servers, though. Has 1-3 H2H against Karlovic for example. Anderson doesn't have as good a serve as Ivo, but has much better all round game. He's not by any means just a big server. That said, as someone pointed out below, he usually under performs against the top players.  Djokovic probably will win, but that was just wrong on a few levels."

Murray is consistent but is a longshot to defeat Djokovic.  Although if Murray plays well he may have a chance against Fed.  My head says Djoker in 4 vs Fed in the final but my heard says Fed in 4 :) Also, well done to Kudla and Pospisil (hooray North America!) for making the 4th round."

tennis,3c6lok,Lemurians,0,Sun Jul 5 18:07:05 2015 UTC,"Gasquet v. Kyrgios is going to be the most fun match of the day and I don't think any other match is going to come close. Wawrinka v. Goffin, maybe."
tennis,3c9uq7,rain_slave,10,Mon Jul 6 05:56:32 2015 UTC,"It's not about popularity or even hard work. Otherwise I'd be rooting for Ferrer every tournament.  The question is what makes him more deserving than the eventual winner of Wimbledon. Whether it's the usual Federer or Djokovic, or maybe Murray. Wawrinka has broken through, as has Cilic. He deserves it if he wins it, but I don't believe he deserves it just bc he's been good for a long time."
tennis,3c9uq7,gg_2015,5,Mon Jul 6 06:26:26 2015 UTC,"You make a good point..But with his talent, don't you think Berdych could have won a major if he belonged to a different generation?.."
tennis,3c9uq7,gg_2015,2,Mon Jul 6 07:29:51 2015 UTC,"Talent yes. But the champions transcend the sports. They have the mental strength to deal w/ pressure, something that I think the likes of Ferrer and Berdych lack a little. Federer, Djokovic and Nadal embodies those attributes to perfection and have had stretches of domination.  Murray is often mentioned among those guys bc he has the game and been to a lot of major finals, but I've always seen it as Big Three, or maybe Super Big 3. Murray was lagging behind for yrs while Djoker rose to the top and won 8 majors.  Heck, Roddick was the best player for yrs behind the Big 2 of Fed/Nadal. Don't think Berdych is better than him. Or Wawrinka or Cilic or Del Potro. It's next to impossible for him in this golden age of men's tennis, and I don't think it's much better in a different era."
tennis,3c9uq7,skylinedude,3,Mon Jul 6 15:22:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this - so  many people misuse the term 'deserving' as if roughing it out at the top end is good enough.. No.. the winner is the only one who deserved it, everyone else got outplayed at some point."

Though I will say that if he doesn't win a slam by the time he hangs it up, for me he'll go down as the most talented player never to win a slam, usurping Nalbandian."

The tough choices you have to make, and the incredible highs you can achieve if you are lucky for Grand Slam qualifying. If they made it similar to the Free To Play movie that Valve did for DotA2 then tears could be shed. But in all seriousness it'd be interesting to see it from a player's perspective considering of what we've heard of Dustin and his incredible story of living in a camper van.  I know both the Grand Slams & ATP are trying to make the men's game not have such disparity in the prize payouts so that players at a lower level get more money for their worth, but even at the moment you really need to make a Grand Slam in any hopes of getting a slice of the pie and/or get to Top 100 in the world to break even."

I seem to remember Roger talking about how he'd never really want to be 'friends' with any of the big 4 because he needs to compete against them professionally at the end of the day. Simon and Monfils are like this because they both grew up playing with each other as Frenchmen and see each other all the time."

I don't want to say today's players are too soft, but we're almost too nice to each other sometimes. It's good when players go after each other a bit. As long as it stays within the rules and it's fair, that's OK. You have to be a bit tough.""    -http://en.espn.co.uk/tennis/sport/story/288295.html  I wasn't really suggesting that they weren't on good terms.

As of now, Thursday is scheduled for women's semifinals matches only. Schedule here  If your budget is max $225/ticket, you will likely only be able to afford one session, and you will have to sit up high. Even the second-highest level of seats are going for a minimum of a few hundred dollars per ticket now, and the prices are just going to get higher. Sitting up high is not the best obviously, but the experience of seeing live tennis is worth the cost.  As for whether to go to a day or night session - that's really a toss-up.  I prefer the night session because (1) the organizers usually put the most anticipated matches in the evening session and (2) the weather is actually bearable (sitting up high in Ashe stadium when it's 90 degrees and sticky can get uncomfortable). But you might not care about either of those things, so that's up to you.  Hope that helps!"

tennis,3c57w7,nwxj,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:00:22 2015 UTC,"Did he even try to talk with TA about this, before coming out to the media?  It seems like he just lashed out at them in a public setting, which is the last thing you should do. He should have addressed these problems beforehand with TA, and if they were unreasonable, then he can not only have merit to speak publicly, but can also draw on those talks.  Currently, he's provided no hard evidence, and just sounds like he hasn't made any attempt to talk with TA, and just wants to antagonize them.  Obviously it could be the other way, but I don't like to jump to conclusions, and the simple point is Tomic hasn't provided any evidence that supports him, it's all what he thinks should have and shouldn't have happened."
tennis,3c57w7,kingboz,2,Mon Jul 6 09:09:10 2015 UTC,"Well, Tennis Australia made a comment and they didn't mention anything about Tomic not speaking to them first.  Either way, TA's at fault here. The whole situation could have been avoided had they not pulled funding for Bernard and his sister because for 'attitude problems' and charged him for practicing in order to play for Australia!

In basketball, especially, time outs are called precisely to stop the other team's momentum, and this keeps the game interesting for both.  Sure, it was unfortunate that Murray cooled down, and lost form, but surely he can deal with a 5 minute delay, and he did eventually call for the trainer, and played much better once he did so.  In the end, it worked out for Murray.  If players are that sensitive to a break interrupting their momentum, then, in my opinion, they deserve to lose."

He was doing really well against Seppi beforehand and no matter what, a mto doesn't really give you that much of an edge to go as far as win 6 games in a row.  But yeah, I do believe the mto was abused by Murray in this case but there isn't too much you can do about it other than making rules to limit when or how long you can ask for a mto....which would then rush or inhibit someone who actually does need a mto."
tennis,3c80nh,alj8,4,Sun Jul 5 20:03:20 2015 UTC,"I think Murray said in the interview afterwards that he noticed his shoulder getting tight at the end of the 2nd set, but it 'cooled down' with the break in play for Seppi's MTO and started hurting and hampering his play so there's that.

Maybe he'll have another great run at a slam but in my opinion his playstyle does not fit with his physique. He doesn't have the fitness of 2005-2013 Nadal or 2011-current Djokovic to grind out the way he does as shown with the US open last year. Cilic was in grand form but Nishikori ultimately lost more due to playing so many intense and long matches in a row."
tennis,3c67nd,PokeMyPillow,0,Mon Jul 6 01:23:59 2015 UTC,"I would agree with this last year, but he just hasn't impressed me this year. Hopefully the US Open changes that."
tennis,3c67nd,DamnShadowbans,8,Sun Jul 5 17:56:41 2015 UTC,He's hitting his stride the quickest of all the young guys. The raw talent's there but there's so much he needs to refine first.
tennis,3c67nd,red_280,6,Sun Jul 5 11:56:29 2015 UTC,"Not by 2016, but he will eventually when he matures a bit"
tennis,3c67nd,pounro,8,Sun Jul 5 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"Final may be possible but I don't see him winning one by 2016.  Besides, he'd still be only 21, so he has a lot of time to win slams."
tennis,3c67nd,rafessi,6,Sun Jul 5 09:40:58 2015 UTC,"Eh, I doubt it. Maybe by the end of 2018, but 2016 is too soon. Being a teenage/early 20's superstar is a lot harder these days than it was even 7 or 8 years ago."
tennis,3c67nd,Rac3318,2,Sun Jul 5 14:50:00 2015 UTC,I don't think it's tougher . Just a lack of great young talent.
tennis,3c67nd,rbace,2,Mon Jul 6 00:30:08 2015 UTC,"I suppose that has some truth to it, too"
tennis,3c67nd,Rac3318,2,Mon Jul 6 00:42:40 2015 UTC,"If a Sampras, Agassi , nadal, djock  level talent came up right now I don't think they would have trouble breaking in."
tennis,3c67nd,rbace,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:24:43 2015 UTC,"It is somewhat tougher since Djokovic, Wawrinka, Federer, Murray, and many of the other top 10 are tougher than the top 10 pre Fedal era. But a 19-21 year old Nadal would have been very successful today too and same with a 22 year old Federer, achieving at least a top 10 rank."
tennis,3c67nd,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:27:53 2015 UTC,I don't think it's that much tougher. I think the tour peaked in toughness when all of the big 4 were playing great. Plus the homogenized courts makes things easier.
tennis,3c67nd,rbace,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:46:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah....its only somewhat tougher at the moment since Fedal is in full decline but are Roddick, Nalbandian, Coria, Roddick, Ferrero, and Moya really tougher than Djokovic, old Federer, Murray, Wawrinka, Nishikori, Berdych, Ferrer, and Raonic? Not to mention some other good non top 10 players like Dimitrov and Tsonga."
tennis,3c67nd,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:18:13 2015 UTC,Safin and wawrinka are kind of equal talents. I would say Roddick was better than everyone except the big 4. I would say that era gets underrated because of the Swiss forehand destroying everyone. Hewitt was a great great player that even beat Sampras in the final before he started getting blown off the court.
tennis,3c67nd,rbace,2,Mon Jul 6 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"No. Don't get me wrong, he has the talent. But his attitude will let him down when it really matters. If he matures he definitely will, but as it is right now he has a massive ego and an entitlement problem."
tennis,3c67nd,AussieVGCollecter,3,Sun Jul 5 16:04:08 2015 UTC,I get the ego statement but on what basis does he have an entitlement problem? He hasn't really done anything to warrant that label as far as I can tell.

tennis,3c3dwl,sink_or_swim_,26,Sat Jul 4 13:01:05 2015 UTC,According to the Wimbelton app he's made $153K in singles (probably most from this tournament) and $40K in doubles. I assume all this is USD.  Between taxes and a mass of expenses it's really not that much money.
tennis,3c3dwl,plenty_of_time,2,Sat Jul 4 13:32:53 2015 UTC,"This is only partially true. There is a ton of talent, and the game has only became more competitive and more financially successful and more global in the last 10-15 years. I don't see a dearth of talent outside the top 20 in any way. But it is very true that guys outside the top 100 are having way too much trouble making money, and 50-100 aren't making enough."

tennis,3c3dwl,sink_or_swim_,27,Sat Jul 4 21:24:18 2015 UTC,"Airfare, car rental, hotels, food, coaching, court fees, equipment, medical it all adds up. Tennis is a very expensive sport. Dustin Brown does not have any major sponsors as noted.  He's not ""living it up"" with his income. It's very hard to be a professional tennis player hovering around the ATP 100 rank mark. Lots of articles about this and how hard/expensive it is to make a living as a tennis player.  If I had to guess I'd say he has a lifestyle similar to that of a person making $50K a year."
tennis,3c3dwl,thecabbler,12,Sat Jul 4 14:54:14 2015 UTC,"You know, besides the part where he travels the world playing the sport he loves."
tennis,3c3dwl,reviloto,9,Sat Jul 4 14:58:42 2015 UTC,"The trouble is that his career lasts 10 years - and when that ends, most players do not have an education to fall back upon, or a job in media to rely on.

Sure you see some mediocre volleys and average backhands but you also get to see awesome shit like massive forehand winners that even people like Djokovic can't reach and I really enjoy watching serves fly at 140mph.

tennis,3c3oyq,PressureCereal,5,Sat Jul 4 17:15:01 2015 UTC,Well Federer was returning 140+ MPH serves this past match. But that would be interesting to see.
tennis,3c3oyq,SoftShoeShuffler,5,Sat Jul 4 17:22:11 2015 UTC,He returned a 147mph serve against Groth
tennis,3c3oyq,BadBackhanderererer,-25,Sat Jul 4 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"Did everyone see how helpless Federer was in rallies with this guy who has probably the biggest serve in tennis but struggles to stay in the Top 100? Groth makes a bazillion errors, but when Groth is hitting ground strokes, Federer can only hope he misses. He's helpless trying to hit punishing ground strokes himself."
tennis,3c3oyq,Rac3318,8,Sat Jul 4 16:49:46 2015 UTC,"I know you're just a troll, but your comment is just silly. With exception of Federer's last service game in the third, Federer barely lost a rally, either by Groth's unforced errors or because of outright winners."
tennis,3c3oyq,dreamerkid001,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:11:01 2015 UTC,I can understand trolling many people in this word.  But why would anyone troll about Roger?  He's the world's sweetest man.
tennis,3c3oyq,BadBackhanderererer,-5,Sun Jul 5 06:08:43 2015 UTC,Pretty much the only winners I saw Federer hit were passing shots. Groth was starting to unload and connect from the 3rd set or so onward. Federer faced pressure on a number of points in service games and got lucky Groth ultimately missed on the big points that would've set up break point or bigger holes. Groth hit much harder on the backhand (same as virtually every other player in men's tennis) and bigger on the forehand.
tennis,3c3oyq,Rac3318,3,Sun Jul 5 01:23:36 2015 UTC,"Dude... Federer had 56 winners and only 8 unforced errors. Hell, he only lost 7 of his first service points in the entire match. I don't know what match you saw but it clearly wasn't Federer's."
tennis,3c3oyq,BadBackhanderererer,-2,Sun Jul 5 01:45:05 2015 UTC,"Bad stats. He made way more than 8 errors, but they counted them as ""forced."" Probably because Groth overpowering him from the baseline was a ""forced"" error."
tennis,3c3oyq,Rac3318,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:15:52 2015 UTC,"You really need to think about how Groth could possibly overpower Federer when he didn't break serve and didn't see a single break point in the 4th set, and that Federer broke Groth 4 times in the match. You can try to keep trolling but you're failing pretty miserably so far."

tennis,3c4683,PureDarkness93,40,Sat Jul 4 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"As others have said, in the slow motion replay, the time between hits was 0.4 seconds or less. That means in real time there was probably less than a tenth of a second between them. That's way too short for Ivo to have hit the ball the second time intentionally. Since it can't have been intentional, the play is legal. Most likely, the force of the ball caroming off the strings caused the racket head to pull back up in a strange way, leading to the second hit as the ball went straight up and Ivo followed through."
tennis,3c4683,puffdonut1,5,Sat Jul 4 17:58:37 2015 UTC,Thank you for bringing reason to this thread.
tennis,3c4683,iamadacheat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:35:59 2015 UTC,It's not about intention or not. It's about whether it is the same motion through. I think it's pretty clear Karlovic's second hit was not following the same trajectory and was not in the follow-through of the hitting motion and therefore was an illegal double hit.
tennis,3c4683,yesh222,-22,Sun Jul 5 16:03:42 2015 UTC,0.1 seconds can be a long time when you're pumped up. Especially if he was aware a fraction of a second before contact that he was going to miss the volley.

First, the slice, which moved the ball away from the racquet, and second, the flick of the wrist that again made contact with the ball.

tennis,3c4h3o,flat_tamales,2,Sat Jul 4 22:39:34 2015 UTC,I really enjoy Muguruza's game and if she continues playing well I can see her get through this section just from sheer fire power -- although Keys is also up there in this regard.

tennis,3c4n8y,compuzr,6,Sun Jul 5 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"I thought he was a big fan of Djokovic too. I've seen him say great things about Novak's dedication, hard work and his ability to break through despite Roger and Rafa. But you're absolutely right about his attitude toward Roger. Everytime he comments a Fed match, you see it coming. He evenly openly challenged that Roger WILL NOT win any more grand slams and then he had to eat his own words after that last Wimby that Federer won. The final moments of that Wimby were a treat, just to listen to him apologize for all that he said when Roger was down.."

tennis,3c4n8y,avaliantheel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"Being opinionated isn't necessarily about supporting a player. With McEnroe his opinions can be about rule changes (get rid of let calls, etc), chair umpire decisions in matches, strategies players appear to be employing in various situations (or not employing that he believes they should), all sorts of things. When things happen he just often has unnecessarily strong opinions about them."
tennis,3c4n8y,seyakomo,3,Sun Jul 5 19:37:36 2015 UTC,"I think one big reason is Mary Carillo.  She and McEnroe won the mixed doubles in the French Open, and knew each other since they trained at Harry Hopman (when he moved to the US).  She was doing commentary in the 1980s, and probably talked him into doing it.  McEnroe has been doing commentary for around 20 years, so this shouldn't be a new observation..."

tennis,3c326g,Skyluz,7,Sat Jul 4 14:23:59 2015 UTC,Crazy to think Ward is the British number 4 at the minute. This is definitely the best I've seen him play!

tennis,3c326g,PureDarkness93,6,Sat Jul 4 16:04:00 2015 UTC,Karlovic just very clearly hit it twice to save set point against Tsonga in the 4th set tie-breaker and has gone on to win. Tsonga has a right to be well pissed off.

She will climb 42 positions from the last ranking after Wimbledon is over....even more if she wins her next match and she plays Keys.  If she wins that match she'll get to 53 positions up from her position before Wimbledon.  WOW   In the male draw the biggest surprise currently is Ward who is up 23 positions from his rating before Wimby.  If he defeats Pospisil he'll be 31 position up.

tennis,3c3mc8,RageMayne,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:46:47 2015 UTC,Those watches are pretty poorly designed if they die after getting sweat on them. Modern smartwatches are water resistant and designed for fitness use so they should hold up fine.

tennis,3c37vw,Shad0wF0x,3,Sat Jul 4 19:34:20 2015 UTC,"I think single player sports are like that. Golf for example, there's an incredible gap between casual and pro, whereas it's harder to see in say Basketball, even though there's obviously also a huge difference."
tennis,3c37vw,SwissBliss,2,Sat Jul 4 20:03:05 2015 UTC,Yeah there's obviously a huge difference. Even retired NBA players completely demolish lesser leagues like the Chinese Basketball Association. Rec-leagues get destroyed even more. Still. Basketball still looks like basketball. Soccer looks like soccer. Public park tennis looks like a bunch of people lobbing the ball desperately trying to keep the ball within bounds.
tennis,3c37vw,Shad0wF0x,2,Sat Jul 4 20:30:16 2015 UTC,I'm probably gonna get downvoted but Kyrgios has a visually unappealing forehand.

tennis,3c4mls,fly_penguin,4,Sat Jul 4 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"According to ATPWorldTour.com it's Djokovic, which makes sense to me. Second serve points won percentage is - imo - one of the two or three most important stats in the game. The alltime leader, per that site? Federer. Nole, Fed, Rafa, and Stan the Man are all in the top 10 this year for the stat, as well."

tennis,3c4mls,mathen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:21:47 2015 UTC,"Based on stats, it's Isner easily.  He wins the highest % of 2nd serve points on tour (58.1%) even though he's one of the worst ATP players on return of serve.  For women my guess is Coco Vandeweghe.  Her 51.2% of 2nd serve points won is just 0.4 short of #1 in the world (Stosur), but she's the least accomplished of the top 2nd servers from the baseline."

tennis,3c0khn,strike2867,13,Fri Jul 3 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"Short answer is that there needs to be a certain dB level of ""quietness"" so that the players can hear the judge make calls.

You see all the time hawkeye showing elongated ovals of where the ball hits the ground so the ball obviously slides very briefly and is deformed by hitting the ground.

Hawkeye gets a bad read and says the ball is out by 3.5mm.  The call is not overturned due to your rule.  Edit: to elaborate, under current rules, the worst line call we could get is off by 3.6mm.  Edit 2: Apparently Hawkeye's error is plus/minus 5mm.  Same argument applies.  Also, errors are normally distributed, so we can expect that most calls are within about 3mm."

tennis,3c01yf,chickensandwiche,12,Fri Jul 3 16:44:48 2015 UTC,Same argument applies.  The error bars go both ways.  Saying that Hawkeye has to have a certain margin of error for each call just makes it possible for balls that are even farther out to end up being called in (or vice versa).
tennis,3c01yf,iamadacheat,8,Fri Jul 3 16:05:47 2015 UTC,Well what I'm saying is that the entire premise of requiring Hawkeye to call a ball a certain number of mm in or out ultimately ends up leading to more inaccuracies.
tennis,3c01yf,iamadacheat,2,Fri Jul 3 16:51:19 2015 UTC,...what?
tennis,3c01yf,iamadacheat,2,Fri Jul 3 17:14:06 2015 UTC,Errors aren't always normally distributed.
tennis,3c01yf,Evilpotatohead,2,Fri Jul 3 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"You are correct in that this would open up a different type of inaccuracy. But that does not mean it is necessarily worse overall. The goal is to estimate the ground truth from the measurements that we have. Unless there is a systematic bias, the errors of the umpire and hawk-eye should be uncorrelated. This means that taking into account the estimate of both the umpire and hawk-eye is better on average than either one individually. Given that the umpire called the ball in, and hawk-eye called the ball out by 3.5mm, the maximum likelihood for the ground truth is somewhere between the two, not 7mm out. The umpire's call can give us some information about the direction of hawk-eye's error. While a ball 7mm out could potentially be called in, it is extremely unlikely as it requires relatively larger errors in the same direction by both hawk-eye and the umpire. Anyway, we could decide what kind of confidence interval from hawk-eye we find acceptable to overturn the umpire's call. It really comes down to whether we want hawk-eye to be the decision-maker or a decision aid for the umpire."
tennis,3c01yf,27B-Six,0,Fri Jul 3 17:44:27 2015 UTC,"Also, errors are normally distributed, so we can expect that most calls are within about 3mm.   ಠ_ಠ  no"
tennis,3c01yf,kneedragatl,9,Fri Jul 3 17:58:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think we can try to fix for accuracy errors just by saying ""well it's got to be more in or more out than the accuracy issue could account for."" the inaccuracy could be in any direction, correct? its not like the inaccuracy is 3.6mm in the opposite direction of what the ump called"
tennis,3c01yf,droplob,3,Fri Jul 3 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"The ump's decision should be the official one if it's only in/out by a margin of 3.6mm. Just like in cricket with LBWs where they can't decide whether it's close enough to be on the wicket, the umpire's call calls the shots."
tennis,3c01yf,BornInTheRSA,5,Fri Jul 3 20:01:39 2015 UTC,Except the ump is still less likely to be correct than Hawkeye.

Someone over viewing the calls should be able to halt play if the slow-mo replays are that clear especially if hawkeye is overruling the call and not just confirming it.

tennis,3c01yf,hivaidsislethal,2,Fri Jul 3 20:10:50 2015 UTC,I suppose but if it's a big point like that it could change the result of the whole set and there overruling the linesman's call by going by hawkeye. Could the chair umpire have overruled hawkeye if he'd watched that replay? Watching how far off it was and seeing nothing happen seems wrong.

tennis,3c01yf,1Subject,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:44:43 2015 UTC,It is. Look into hawkeye. It has a stated margin of error and uses computers to recreate the ball path based on its measurements.

On court the ball wouldnt leave a mark on the line but the system showed on tv had the ball touching the line.

tennis,3bz718,dichloroethane,30,Fri Jul 3 10:47:09 2015 UTC,"Dustin Brown was rushing to the net after every first and second serve. Nadal's shots were being intercepted mid-court or at the net by Brown.  Most of these were volleys: half-volleys, drop volleys, swing volleys. The full repertoire."

tennis,3bz718,holliniv,12,Fri Jul 3 12:53:08 2015 UTC,He actually tried it a couple of times but it did not work. Brown even hit a backhand smash winner off a lob.
tennis,3bz718,zettabyte,2,Fri Jul 3 14:16:42 2015 UTC,And Nadal doesn't really have the return game to handle that with consistency on Brown's wicked serve.
tennis,3bz718,PenguinWriter,5,Fri Jul 3 16:36:34 2015 UTC,"Brown has a good, hard first and second serve.  It was difficult to attack."
tennis,3bz718,dubsdaazn,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:40:44 2015 UTC,He is capable of returning much better but there's also the case of Brown hitting his 2nd serve almost as fast as his 1st so he didn't exactly make things easy out there.
tennis,3bz718,Rac3318,9,Fri Jul 3 12:56:06 2015 UTC,not to mention he was smacking second serves like they were first.
tennis,3bz718,simpleisreal,7,Fri Jul 3 17:14:28 2015 UTC,A lot of not is that Nadal never had any rhythm at any point in the match. The average rally was something like 2.6 shots. And it wasn't like Brown was giving Nadal the same look. The constantly variety of shots must have been incredibly frustrating for Nadal.
tennis,3bz718,GinGimlet,7,Fri Jul 3 14:02:26 2015 UTC,"If you saw Brown's serve you would understand. Huge first serve, it was extremely difficult for Nadal to hit any good returns, which let Brown step inside the court easily."
tennis,3bz718,compuzr,5,Fri Jul 3 13:37:33 2015 UTC,"Also nadal tends to stand way back and hit his high looping shot on a return. I know it's difficult to do but I've often wondered by more people don't move in and take Rafa's shots out of the air--lately they've been landing much shorter in the court anyways, especially his forehand."
tennis,3bz718,_Luminaire,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:47:38 2015 UTC,"Usually, on hard or clay courts, but not on grass. Rafa never stood more than a few feet behind the baseline to return serve in this match."

tennis,3bz718,_Luminaire,13,Sat Jul 4 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"Well, you're probably right if history is to indicate anything. Every person who has beat Nadal in a non-final at Wimbledon since he debuted in 2003 has lost the next round. This includes Srichapan 2003, Gilles Muller in 2005, Rosol in 2012, Darcis 2013, and Kyrgios 2014. All his other losses at Wimbledon were either in the final (2006, 7, 11) or he was absent (2004 and 2009)."
tennis,3bz718,alphyc,6,Fri Jul 3 15:55:48 2015 UTC,"Yup, thanks for backing me up on it.  Even guys like Stakhovsky, Robredo and Seppi who have managed to beat Roger early always lose a round later.  The emotional energy expended beating a top top guy always seems to be too much to sustain for another match"
tennis,3bz718,T0tai,5,Fri Jul 3 16:30:29 2015 UTC,Obviously no one expects him to go on and win it all. The fact that he played such amazing tennis is whats being appreciated here.
tennis,3bz718,opiumgordon,3,Fri Jul 3 19:27:34 2015 UTC,"he might lose the next round, but the extra 30,000 GBP prize money makes a pretty big difference for journeymen players"

tennis,3c2rv2,SwissBliss,5,Sat Jul 4 06:36:01 2015 UTC,"Presumably because the surnames represent dozens of different languages, and you can't expect the announcers to be able to actually pronounce all them. Approximate them, sure, but not get them right. I doubt most (English-speaking) people criticizing announcers for Kei's name could even pronounce Nishikori the way it is meant to be pronounced, because the r in his name doesn't even exist in English."
tennis,3c2rv2,KyleG,2,Sat Jul 4 08:06:46 2015 UTC,Commentators ask them how to pronounce their surname yet still get it wrong.
tennis,3c2rv2,831pm,4,Sat Jul 4 17:55:52 2015 UTC,"Also, the commentary is just terrible.  In the Nadal Brown match, it was obvious that Brown was doing something that really troubled Nadal.  The commentators left it at Nadal not playing well and Brown just being wacky and unpredictable.  Looking back, it was clear Brown tactically decided he was not going to let Nadal run laterally along the baseline and turned the game into a vertical touch match where it Nadal is basically very ordinary."
tennis,3c2rv2,flat_tamales,2,Sat Jul 4 15:24:11 2015 UTC,"At least in the US, commentators do find a way to mess up Nishikori, along with Spanish last names too. Then, Safarova has been mispronounced so much that she's given up on actually saying it correctly"
tennis,3c2rv2,KyleG,3,Sat Jul 4 07:37:17 2015 UTC,"commentators do find a way to mess up Nishikori,   In fairness, the r in his name doesn't exist in English. Nor does the rr in Ferrer or the r in Verdasco. Hell, Verdasco is from Spain, so there's an argument to be made that the s in his name is meant to be pronounced like a th because that's how Castilian (the prestige accent of Spanish) does it."
tennis,3c2rv2,mathen,2,Sat Jul 4 08:07:34 2015 UTC,"The <s> wouldn't be pronounced ""th"", that's <c> before <e> and <i>, and <z>.   Also the flap American speakers make in words like ""butter"" and ""reddit"" is pretty close to <r> in Spanish. <rr> I guess is present in Scottish English?"
tennis,3c2rv2,KyleG,2,Sat Jul 4 09:47:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the correction re Castilian. I never got that /s/->/θ/ rule down   <rr> I guess is present in Scottish English   OK so Scots might be able to pronounce the ""rr"" in Ferrer correctly. But the majority if English speakers, no (odds are not the guy who was complaining about pronunciation). And maybe the ""r"" in Verdasco (because it's not merely the tongue flap, but the fact that you flow immediately from it to /d/ that makes it difficult. Definitely not something an English speaker could do without practice (that's why so many would pronounce it (pardon my imprecise IPA) [ve:] or [veə] or [veɑ]dasco.  Guy complaining probably can't render the Japanese r correctly in Nishikori, either, and is probably getting the vowels wrong (the 'i' after 'sh' gets pretty much elided away).  Anyway, my point stands: stop complaining about announcers getting it wrong—shit's hard, yo. Hell, it seems even fans haven't settled on the correct way to pronounce ""Berdych"" yet! And I'd say there are two correct ways depending on whether you live in a rhotic or non-rhotic r English-speaking location, irrespective of the ""ch""'s proper pronunciation."

Someone tried telling me that generally going to Australia is very expensive and that everything is expensive and that just sounded a bit too vague for my taste.   How is the nightlife in Melbourne? Is it generally busy?   Also, would you happen to know the recommended airports to get there? I did a very brief search for airfare and it cost something around $2700! I intend on being there for about 7 days (can't miss too much school hehe), Jan 28 to February 2"
tennis,3c2pwk,ClippedShadows,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:00:48 2015 UTC,"Food is expensive when brought at the venue (always is). While general food outside of the venue is not too expensive when compared to the average Australian wage, it is more expensive from an American perspective.  A lot of people who go on the regular will be seen with a backpack which contain pre-made food and drinks. So if you want to save on costs, buy pre-made food from a supermarket/bakery etc. I'd strongly advise you to bring a refillable water bottle or two. There will be water stations that allow you to refill your bottle in the fan areas.  Other advice would be to cover yourself in sunscreen (can be brought from supermarkets/chemists) before you leave your accommodation and be prepared to re-apply during the day. Wear long sleeved breathable shirts, bring a hat and a towel. This advice is because you'll be here during the peak of summer and you're going to be get sunburnt if you're not careful. Actually, just be sunsmart.  There's really only one airport that's possible for you to arrive at, and that will be the Melbourne International Airport. And from there, catch the Air Bus shuttle bus to the Central Business District (aka CBD - city centre).  Get accommodation in the CBD, ride the #70 tram - it's free if you have a ticket."
tennis,3c2pwk,lifecanbebetter,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:33:30 2015 UTC,"Certainly in general everything in Australia is way more expensive than the US (I've travelled there quite a few times). For example, a bottle of water at the Open will be a minimum of $4. Food at the open will set u back about $15-20 a meal for one."
tennis,3c2pwk,ClippedShadows,3,Mon Jul 6 12:25:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a local Melburnian who has attended the Australian Open several times.  You can pre-buy tickets online in the months leading up to the tournament. Generally if you want tickets for the main arenas (Rod Laver/Margaret Court) you'll need to pre-book when they launch. But there's also ground pass tickets which gives you access to all arenas but the two ticketed ones. Ground passes are pretty popular for the first and second rounds.  I think if you're pretty happy with organizing things yourself, do the research and do the online bookings.   Access to Melbourne Park via public transport is pretty easy. So if you decide to stay near a train station you can get there pretty easily."

tennis,3c2pwk,Volunteer_Ninja,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:59:03 2015 UTC,"My flight was about $2200. Quite expensive yes, but Australia was worth it!! You can probably find a flight for $1600-$1800 if you're flexible.   I stayed at an AirBnB in Richmond. It was on the same tram line as Melbourne Park, so it was convenient to get to the tennis!   I went three days. I had a ticket to Hisense Arena for the middle Saturday. And then day tickets to Rod Laver for the quarter finals. Tickets were $60 or so for Hisense (I think you buy for Margaret court arena now though) and $350 or so for two days of the quarter finals. That's in Australian dollars.   You can also watch tennis on a big screen in a square outside in the CBD. Near Flinders station. It's a fun atmosphere.   Food is expensive in Australia. Everything is more there. But there are ways to eat cheaper. Buying groceries, eating take out, not going to restaurants all the time, etc."

tennis,3c2g8t,dkane91,2,Sat Jul 4 03:30:59 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting though that Nadal is heavily reliant on clay court wins to boost his stats. With clay court season gone, Nadal has got a slightly better win percentage than Fed's 2013 season. If he doesn't start improving soon, then he's going to have a statistically worse season than Fed did.   Fed lost a lot of his aura in 2013 and Nadal is going to find it much tougher than Fed to regain his, because of the manner of his defeats. Make no mistake, don't write-off Nadal. However, it is the time to start analysing his game more critically."

tennis,3c1yqq,KaiserHunger,0,Sat Jul 4 14:00:31 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but she's good looking so I'm not sure they'd be losing out on much.  EDIT: Controversial comment? Is it a secret they show attractive people on TV more? My point is what's the logic in not showing one player? All players should get some camera time. They made it to Wimbledon!"
tennis,3bz92r,paimeg,39,Fri Jul 3 10:21:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Obviously Toni has done a lot of good for Nadal. It's hard to say whether or not their coaching relationship has lost its luster from where I'm standing.  I'm inclined to disagree though. Nadal has lost early at Wimbledon the last 4 years. In 3 of those years he won RG and once the US Open, all under the tutelage of Uncle Toni."

tennis,3bz92r,three-two-one-zero,26,Fri Jul 3 14:57:18 2015 UTC,"Nadal is way too OCD to drop Toni completely but maybe adding another voice would be beneficial. Maybe Agassi could help, he battled through adversity and injuries and was able to win a slam at 31."
tennis,3bz92r,hivaidsislethal,14,Fri Jul 3 15:38:18 2015 UTC,That would be awesome I would love to see Agassi coaching
tennis,3bz92r,elrefai,13,Fri Jul 3 15:42:21 2015 UTC,I don't think Agassi would ever want to coach.

tennis,3bz92r,elrefai,10,Fri Jul 3 15:58:31 2015 UTC,Carlos Moya? Nadal's always had a lot of respect for him.

tennis,3bz92r,TarsierBoy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"Wasn't he a part of his tennis up-bringing anyway? I think adding yet another Spaniard will not amount to much. If he's looking for change, a completely new perspective is where it's at."
tennis,3bz92r,fuzzyfeels,3,Fri Jul 3 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah adding another voice is a good idea. I wouldn't want be Nadal and 32 years old wondering ""what if I had other input, could I have won another slam?"" Nadal should just do it. Don't drop Toni, but add another coach. Try it out for a year. If it doesn't work out, switch it up. Or just keep doing what you're doing until your knees give out."
tennis,3bz92r,Universehiker,23,Fri Jul 3 22:55:14 2015 UTC,John also suggested that Rafael Nadal stop playing Roland Garros all together to focus on Wimbledon so.

tennis,3bz92r,ElementalMagic,22,Fri Jul 3 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"He absolutely should not fire Uncle Toni. But he does need to add another voice, and get another coach, like Novak did with Becker and Vaida."
tennis,3bz92r,bustedracquet,8,Fri Jul 3 13:36:36 2015 UTC,I think he would rather give up tennis than begin a new journey with a new trainer.
tennis,3bz92r,cysun,6,Fri Jul 3 13:53:11 2015 UTC,"People keep forgetting this, but Nadal has always been shaky on grass, especially in the first week. I don't remember exactly how many times, but even though he made 5 finals, he also almost got knocked out (i.e pushed to 5 sets) in the first week 2 or 3 times during those 5 finals runs. His serve isn't the best and his balls don't bounce as high on grass, players can just play fearless and tee off against Nadal."
tennis,3bz92r,simpleisreal,14,Fri Jul 3 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"Also, people aren't mentioning the fact that Brown played an absolute belter of a game. That performance would've been enough to knock anyone out."

tennis,3bz92r,GayForRay,6,Fri Jul 3 13:12:56 2015 UTC,Him missing routine forehands can't be improved by coaching.
tennis,3bz92r,avaliantheel,17,Fri Jul 3 13:13:23 2015 UTC,Mental coaching might help.
tennis,3bz92r,SouareInTheMorning,7,Fri Jul 3 14:20:01 2015 UTC,"So, coaching? Not being flippant; what I mean is that at the top level, surely one of the most important things a coach does for a player is help mentally. It's not like anyone would come in and say 'ok rafa, let's sort out this technical issue with your forehand', right?  To be clear, I am disagreeing with your parent comment."
tennis,3bz92r,callmelucky,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:54:00 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but I think that removing a constant in his tennis career will do more harm to a creature of habit than good."
tennis,3bz92r,avaliantheel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:48:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe hire a sports psychologist? Could help maybe. Nadal clearly does not enjoy losing, and all the media eating up Nadal's own comments about his lacking confidence have got to be digging into him."
tennis,3bz92r,alpacafarts,5,Fri Jul 3 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"He needs a new perspective. He doesn't need to get rid of Toni, but he needs someone to give him different advice. His tactics won't work anymore, especially as he gets closer to 30 and older. Change the grip, change court position, change the baseline game. Nadal can't just grind away, anymore, to break down the opponent into unforced errors. It just won't work."
tennis,3bz92r,Rac3318,2,Fri Jul 3 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly. In fact, Uncle Toni himself could bring in some different coaches to help bolster his game. Why limit yourself to just one coach? I don't get that."
tennis,3bz92r,Nitro_R,6,Fri Jul 3 20:14:27 2015 UTC,I think Rafa should add Pascal Maria to his box
tennis,3bz92r,Personacorona,6,Fri Jul 3 14:29:39 2015 UTC,Or Carlos Bernardes while we're at it
tennis,3bz92r,raffig,2,Fri Jul 3 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"I do think that some of Nada;'s strategic thinking has been off, as well as his confidence.  Cant hurt to beef up his team.  Also, I dont think he's playing that terribly -- he just needs to make minor adjustments and mentally get his mojo back"
tennis,3bz92r,DudeAsInCool,2,Fri Jul 3 15:40:06 2015 UTC,"Remember when Nadal fell apart when his parents separated?  How that affected his game?  Part of me agrees he needs someone a new voice to reinvigorate him (and given what's going on, why not try it and see?)  But part of me wonders what else is up in his real life that might be digging at him."

tennis,3bz7s6,Thesolly180,13,Fri Jul 3 13:10:36 2015 UTC,Watching Dimitrov and Gasquet and their backhands is like watching two wizards duel.
tennis,3bz7s6,binks21,9,Fri Jul 3 13:07:54 2015 UTC,They have some of the most gorgeous backhands.
tennis,3bz7s6,TheHardWorkingIngo,13,Fri Jul 3 13:10:28 2015 UTC,Centre Court is going crazy right now! seems to be actually bothering Serena some
tennis,3bz7s6,mathen,12,Fri Jul 3 17:20:04 2015 UTC,I only expected Watson to win about two games. Win or lose now she has done very well.

tennis,3bz7s6,Stig-wannabe,15,Fri Jul 3 17:51:40 2015 UTC,"Amazing match, Watson played beyond her usual level and gave it everything, still wasn't enough to breach the wall which is Serena Williams.  Now the match which we all were hoping for is here and how weird would it be if Venus turns out to be the one who halts Serena's bid for a 2nd Serena slam and a calendar slam..."
tennis,3bz7s6,MCallanan,38,Fri Jul 3 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"I am a Brit, HUGE Wimbledon fan (been lucky enough to attend many times), but watching this match has been tough.   The crowd is crazy. I think its great having a crazy crowd, but not to this extent. The reason people are watching this is because we are tennis fans.   To boo the first seed like that isn't right. To scream during points isn't right. To call balls out during the rally isn't right."
tennis,3bz7s6,alpacafarts,27,Fri Jul 3 18:32:16 2015 UTC,Just kind of amazing to see Centre Court act that way... Not a crowd performance to be proud of.
tennis,3bz7s6,TheHardWorkingIngo,15,Fri Jul 3 18:34:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The shouts of ""out"" when Watson hit a return close to baseline were so classless.  I'm all about supporting the home player, don't get me wrong, but you just don't do that nor cheer a double fault or missed first serve."
tennis,3bz7s6,Stig-wannabe,15,Fri Jul 3 19:29:03 2015 UTC,Also cheering double faults.

tennis,3bz7s6,CommonMalarky,17,Fri Jul 3 18:40:32 2015 UTC,"During the game, even. There was at least one shot of Watson's that Serena applauded.  I get the feeling that Serena, when losing, puts the blame and anger on herself far more than her opponent, and she can respect their game. That's probably part of being a champion, I guess, I'd be far more petty."

tennis,3bz7s6,alpacafarts,5,Fri Jul 3 14:12:41 2015 UTC,For some reason at this angle it makes Tomic look like he's a giant playing a midget Djokovic.

tennis,3bz7s6,CohenC,4,Fri Jul 3 18:42:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure how I haven't died (I shouldn't joke considering my Uncle died of a heart attack post Wawrinka/Murray a few years ago) after that heart blistering match between Serena & Watson. Some absolutely brilliant tennis that both players played. It was really incredible, I mean it is amazing to think Heather was 2 points away from knocking Serena out. It would have been an absolute highlight had Heather defied all odds and all history books to stop Serena from ""history being made"".  Heather hardly put a foot wrong, I think at one point, Heather had only hit 1 BH unforced error, compared to Serena's 13 unforced error's. I mean that is incredible that Heather didn't let the occasion get to her because I know she has said that Serena is an absolute hero of her's and I had set myself up for Heather to be smashed off the court 6 - 1, 6 -2. But boy we were treated to something absolutely special.  Heather's game and movement have been key areas of improvement over recent years, I actually feel she's a far more complete package now than Laura was in terms of British women, and I feel she can now kick on and do something special.  I hope she doesn't reflect too badly on the missed opportunities at 3 - 0 & 5 - 4 and just think of the absolute positives that she managed to rattle the greatest woman of all time on the biggest stage and play some sublime tennis too!"

tennis,3bzuwo,cuddlefish,38,Fri Jul 3 14:24:17 2015 UTC,"I've heard some folks say he's still playing at the same level he's just dealing with tougher draws and an overall tougher crowd of opponents.   I would agree that the field has gotten tougher. I honestly believe that Dimitrov would've beaten the Andy Murray of 2014 at this years Australian Open. Grigor didn't play a bad match in that quarterfinal, Murray just happened to play superbly. Furthermore, Dimitrov has had some tough draws losing to Murray, Federer and Nadal all deep in tournaments. Today he ran into a Gasquet who has played some of his best tennis on grass and played great today.     The contrast to that is that Grigor has lost a lot of matches this year that I don't think he would've lost last year. Grigor Dimitrov should never lose a match to Ryan Harrison never mind get bageled by him in the third set. He shouldn't be losing to Sock, Cuevas or Muller x2 in straight sets. He's also lost matches to guys like Isner, Robredo and Fognini -- tough opponents but opponents you would've expected him to beat if his progression had continued into this season.     Ultimately I think Dimitrov has peaked under the tutelage of Roger Rasheed. He plays a lot of 'aimless' tennis lacking purpose and because of that he often plays himself into defensive positions which especially cost him in his losses to Murray and Sock. Even today against Gasquet; a man who's had his fair share of problems playing as the aggressor - Grigor constantly went to a neutral slice without direction and allowed Gasquet to go on the offensive. I think he really needs to hire a coach who has a better grasp on the X's & O's and general strategy of tennis."
tennis,3bzuwo,MCallanan,12,Fri Jul 3 14:48:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I reckon he's got the most out of Rasheed. His fitness has improved immeasurably, time to get more of a tactical coach."
tennis,3bzuwo,mathen,7,Fri Jul 3 14:51:45 2015 UTC,And even though his fitness has improved I still feel like it's hurt him this season. I thought he ran out of gas against Murray at the Australian Open in the fourth set and he's been bageled in third sets by Fognini and Harrison.
tennis,3bzuwo,MCallanan,2,Fri Jul 3 15:16:22 2015 UTC,rasheed is not really qualified to be a top tennis coach. he was originally just the fitness coach for hewitt
tennis,3bzuwo,bumbleb333,2,Fri Jul 3 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"that's crazy, I didn't know that.  yet top guys like Monfils and Tsonga and Dimitrov have hired him, good tennis coaches must be tough to find"
tennis,3bzuwo,_Luminaire,2,Fri Jul 3 19:35:21 2015 UTC,i wonder why people say this constantly... roger rasheed was ranked 192 in singles and reached the 2nd round of the aus open a couple of times... so he knows how to play tennis.

tennis,3bzuwo,Lewan72,11,Fri Jul 3 21:58:42 2015 UTC,"He's just not playing smart tennis. He's not spreading the court, using spin enough, he's playing far too flat and straight ahead."
tennis,3bzuwo,TacticalTennis,2,Fri Jul 3 18:52:37 2015 UTC,It's just a sophomore slump he will bounce back next year. I also think he could use a more tactical coach. There were rumors a while back about pairing with Paul Annacone but that didn't turn into anything. Roger Rasheed got him into great shape but he needs a little more now. He's got the weapons and the body but is sometimes tactically remiss.
tennis,3bzuwo,elrefai,3,Fri Jul 3 15:47:55 2015 UTC,"His level of play isn't too far off from last year, he, like Bouchard, is probably struggling to live up to the new pressure he faces."
tennis,3bzuwo,Personacorona,5,Fri Jul 3 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"So his play is off....its like saying Nadal's forehand isn't too far off from his 2010 form and that his forehand is only struggling now because of mental and physical issues....Pressure is part of the game just like the mental and physical aspects.   So yes, grigor's form is very off from last year and it is because of many reasons, one maybe being pressure(which he did face before even at wimbledon last year)...."
tennis,3bzuwo,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:32:03 2015 UTC,Racquet change apparently according to Tennis.com
tennis,3bzuwo,vgn,2,Fri Jul 3 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"Did you just notice? He has been using this ""new"" frame since the paris masters at the end of last year. It is 97 sq in with a 18x17 pattern, just like his old frame except 4 sq in larger. I didn't even read the article since the title is already complete bs. He is only ""making it official"" right now since Wilson is actually releasing this version to public in Grigor's exact specs(pre lead tape and such). I'm pretty sure the change has been official for him for a while now and he has only been tinkering with the weight, sw, and balance just slightly. It will naturally be called the PS97S and I suspect it will have the same PJ as the RF97 and PS97.  Who knows why he decided to change to a larger head size when he is still young and a 93 gave him so much success. Either way,a racquet doesn't influence your playstyle so much that you start sitting far behind the baseline much more rather than sticking to the offensive baseline strategy that gave you success."

tennis,3bzmuy,dropshot,2,Fri Jul 3 13:07:37 2015 UTC,"Troicki has worked his way to a seeding after months off due to a ban, and is favored over Brown. Brown is likely to have huge support. Can his serve and volley style throw Troicki off his game?    Worth noting that their head-to-head is at 1-1, both Challenger matches in 2014, with Brown's win being indoors (apparently carpet, is that still a thing in challengers?) and Troicki having a clay win.   Four of the five sets they've played have been tiebreakers. Could be a very interesting match. Surface favours Brown, but it might be hard for him to come off the high of beating Nadal to focus (as it was in the past for Rosol and Kyrgios). And ultimately Troicki has more tour experience."

The number I heard was 10k for clothing though I'm sure it varies quite a bit."

tennis,3bwgxe,kyles24,19,Fri Jul 3 01:36:32 2015 UTC,"I believe it was. He has no big sponsors, so when he got through the qualifiers, some sponsors popped up, and these were quickly sewed on."

tennis,3bwgn0,Parmizan,47,Thu Jul 2 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"It's even stranger when you consider how good he was before then. In 2006 and 2007, he only lost because he was up against the greatest player of all-time.  In 2008 and 2010 he won it, he reached the final in 2011, and obviously didn't compete in 2009. Basically, from 2006 to 2011, whenever he competed, he always either won the tournament, or reached the final.  His sudden decline on grass and at Wimbledon is quite bizarre, and a real shame."
tennis,3bwgn0,jojjeshruk,39,Thu Jul 2 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"His knees make it hard to get down to the low balls on grass. He only won Wimeldon because the CC turns into green clay in the 2nd week. His game has never suited grass that well. In 2012 Rosol simply outplayed him. In 2013 he was emotionellt spent after RG and not good at all, he had not played a warm up tournament. In 2014 he played well the first rounds. He beat Klizan and Rosol who both were playing very well. Kyrgios Simply played a perfect match. Rafa played good but Kyrgios was more clutch and ballbashed well. Dreddy is a nightmare match up for Nadal who has declined massively mentally and physically.   The only bizzare loss in my mind is the one against Darcis."
tennis,3bwgn0,bezjones,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:42:28 2015 UTC,Totally agree... except that he is the greatest player of all time :-P
tennis,3bwgn0,asm129,8,Fri Jul 3 02:01:18 2015 UTC,Nah... Fed has won more and he's going to end up being a top elite player for much longer than Nadal. It looks like Nadal might slip out of the top 15 soon the way he's playing.
tennis,3bwgn0,i_cri_evertim,4,Fri Jul 3 05:47:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say soon, he's still reached the quarter finals or better in 9 tournaments this year and can pick up quite a few points after Wimbledon if he continues to do so. I still believe he'll make the world tour finals if he stays healthy."
tennis,3bwgn0,JonnyArtois,6,Fri Jul 3 09:52:39 2015 UTC,greatest ever on clay...not so much on anything else.
tennis,3bwgn0,mbrw12,2,Fri Jul 3 09:15:55 2015 UTC,Nadal is the greatest clay court player of all time  Federer is the greatest player of all time
tennis,3bwgn0,bezjones,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:28:57 2015 UTC,Stats don't agree with you. The greatest player of all time according to you has a losing record to Nadal even if you take away clay court matches.
tennis,3bwgn0,Centaurd,5,Fri Jul 3 13:31:20 2015 UTC,What does the Greatest player of all time have to do with a losing record against one player?  So you're saying that if Nadal ends up playing Dustin Brown a few more times and loses those too he won't be the greatest player because of his losing record against him?  Of course Federer has a losing record against a player who reached his prime as Federer started declining.  The greatest player of all time should be whoever won the most prestigious tournaments.  Roger Federer has won more grand slam titles than anyone else in history.  Considering grand slams are the biggest events in the sport I think it's safe to say he's the greatest of all time.
tennis,3bwgn0,bezjones,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:54:14 2015 UTC,Grand Slams are a good metric for the casual tennis fan. There is so much more to tennis than that. We'll just have to agree to disagree.
tennis,3bwgn0,rmmdjmdam,2,Fri Jul 3 14:00:26 2015 UTC,"This argument has been used time and again.  So the only stat that matters is the ultimate head-to-head?  The best of all-time refers to performance against all tennis players.  The most significant tournaments that involve all players are the Grand Slams which Federer has won more of.  Novak who is near par with Nadal and Federer in W/L is not yet considered in the GOAT discussion for this simple fact, he's not yet close to their total Slams..."
tennis,3bwgn0,Gotebe,-3,Fri Jul 3 14:39:21 2015 UTC,"By which measure?!  Federer has more gs titles and has an effortless, yet fast and more varied game. (He is clearly better).  Sampras has the same gs title count as Nadal. (Nadal isn't better).  Djokovic is going strong with no sign of decline. (Might prove better with years)."
tennis,3bwgn0,LongLongDongs,5,Fri Jul 3 05:23:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but I don't understand what Federer's playing style has to do with any of this. You personally might prefer it to Nadal's, but Nadal's less ""effortless"" style has given him a 23-10 record against Fed."
tennis,3bwgn0,pineapple_unicorn,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:49:06 2015 UTC,"I guess he meant Federer has mastered a greater variety of skills, while Nadal perfected the physical defensive game with lots of spin until the opponent tires out and commits unforced errors, or is beat by Nadal's passing shot. I like Federer for the fact that he does lots of different things, though I admit Nadal at his prime was much more solid and consistent."
tennis,3bwgn0,Gotebe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:07:05 2015 UTC,"Federer wins with less effort. That's what keeps him up for so long.  Sure, when Nadal is at his top, he is exquisite, better than Federer, but what good is that if not kdpt up (imo)?"
tennis,3bwgn0,dragonsky,3,Fri Jul 3 15:48:45 2015 UTC,For  comparisson: Dustin Brown has won 4 Wimbledon matches in the past 4 years. (so far..)
tennis,3bwgn0,jmann9678,113,Fri Jul 3 02:26:42 2015 UTC,Nadal probably hates Wimbledon at this point.
tennis,3bwgn0,elfmeh,39,Thu Jul 2 18:43:52 2015 UTC,I've got to imagine that it is really messing with his head now. Nadal had his opportunities but he missed a lot of fairly routine shots. Dustin played well to not give Nadal any rhythm though.

I thought Brown had the grass court game and the mentality on the big stage to pose a fight to Rafa, and the guy just served phenomenally. Rafa is also insanely low on confidence, especially at Wimbledon, he missed so many routine forehands, and he couldn't problem solve against Brown's insanely fast pace tactic."

She played 38 net points of which she won 29 of them.  I've seen Dustin Brown plate a few times but had never had the opportunity to see him play on grass, which helps his style of play.

tennis,3bwgn0,JonEverhart,60,Thu Jul 2 21:04:56 2015 UTC,Wow...Dustin Brown made that look routine...
tennis,3bwgn0,Bachman_charles517,16,Thu Jul 2 18:43:26 2015 UTC,Dustin Brown is actually one of a few players who have a winning record against Nadal. He beat him also last year in the Gerry Weber Open 6-4 6-1 which is nuts.
tennis,3bwgn0,halfbrit08,16,Thu Jul 2 20:46:00 2015 UTC,He has huge serves and plays to win points quickly. Basically what you need to do to beat Nadal. You can't get stuck in long rallies with Nadal.
tennis,3bwgn0,JonEverhart,37,Thu Jul 2 21:10:26 2015 UTC,Unless you are Djokovic
tennis,3bwgn0,halfbrit08,24,Thu Jul 2 21:11:18 2015 UTC,Haha yeah. Unless you're the world number 1.
tennis,3bwgn0,TheFormidableGiant,3,Thu Jul 2 21:19:07 2015 UTC,Played some fucking amazing shots. Really toyed with Nadal.
tennis,3bwgn0,Parmizan,4,Thu Jul 2 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"Obviously Nadal really looks past his best, but in recent years he's also been unlucky in that he seems to come up against players who hit inspired form."
tennis,3bwgn0,JonEverhart,16,Thu Jul 2 19:07:30 2015 UTC,"That's fair, but Nadal had chances that he didn't take. The first game of the 4th set, at 30-30, he missed two routine forehands and was broken. Crushing those balls for winners in crucial moments and then gathering momentum from there is what Nadal is known for. He did exactly the opposite."
tennis,3bwgn0,Parmizan,4,Thu Jul 2 19:32:34 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely. Even though Brown was great, Nadal looks like a shadow of his former self by comparison."
tennis,3bwgn0,halfbrit08,9,Thu Jul 2 19:40:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, any player in Dustin's position is going to have to play lights out/risky aggressive tennis to have a shot against a top 10 player. The other factor then is if the top 10 players is playing decently enough to counter the lower seeded player's push. I'd say any top 10 player playing at even 90% with a good strategy could beat guy like Dustin even if Dustin was playing his best. So it's still on Nadal for not playing well enough to hold Dustin off."
tennis,3bwgn0,rbace,5,Thu Jul 2 19:41:23 2015 UTC,It's because if Nadal isn't playing his best his ball sits up for players to tee off on.
tennis,3bwgn0,JonnyArtois,2,Thu Jul 2 23:51:41 2015 UTC,"Surely all the top players encounter that fairly often, it's down to how they react...Nadal just doesn't react."
tennis,3bwgn0,Cyclone-Bill,26,Fri Jul 3 09:17:49 2015 UTC,"Amazing performance by Brown, but what is wrong with Nadal?"
tennis,3bwgn0,BlindBanditMelonLord,22,Thu Jul 2 18:47:49 2015 UTC,"It almost hurts just to watch him play now. No passion, no confidence, no energy. I don't understand what's been in his head this year."
tennis,3bwgn0,chief_running_joke,18,Thu Jul 2 19:19:59 2015 UTC,"I think he's in decline. I've resisted saying it until now, because Nadal's career has been defined by these up/down cycles, injuries and comebacks, etc. But there's something different now. I think he's lost a step, and more importantly, maybe just doesn't care as much about winning every point."
tennis,3bwgn0,BlindBanditMelonLord,3,Thu Jul 2 21:40:25 2015 UTC,It really seems that way. And I'm a huge Rafa fan so that is the last thing I would want to see. Maybe a coaching change will help him out. Murray had a similar problem not too long ago and hiring Lendl helped him get over the hump.
tennis,3bwgn0,BlindBanditMelonLord,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:36:49 2015 UTC,Highly doubtful. But whose to say that's not a bad idea?
tennis,3bwgn0,phalinshah,2,Fri Jul 3 02:11:41 2015 UTC,Is there something with his health? He was absent from the tennis scenario for a long time too. May be his body can no longer support the game he used to play. Full of energy & strength?
tennis,3bwgn0,ChaeDoc_II,23,Fri Jul 3 04:06:18 2015 UTC,"There'll be a lot of talk about how Browns unothodoxy won wim that match, and it certainly helped, but I think what helped the most was how little time he gives Nadal between points. I think that's why he was so assured on his serve. That had to be a huge advantage against someone like Nadal who likes time between points."
tennis,3bwgn0,machidaad,3,Fri Jul 3 06:47:24 2015 UTC,why doesn't everybody cut down on nadals time between points?
tennis,3bwgn0,startinup,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"It comes down to personal preference too, some people like to take a bunch of time between points, but usually more aggressive players like Federer like to keep things quick."
tennis,3bwgn0,rafessi,52,Fri Jul 3 00:38:11 2015 UTC,"I seriously think Rafa needs to look deeper into things now. I think he needs a fresh persepctive in his camp, someone who can come up with new and creative strategies depending on the varied opponents he faces. Players have figured him out now, and he seems to resort to the same old tactics time and time again.  These kinds of upsets are becoming routine to a point that they aren't even all that surprising anymore.  He needs to reviatlize his game big time if he's to pose any threat at the major tournaments for the remainder of his career.  He seems like a non factor at Wimbledon and unless he comes up with a specific game plan on how to counter opponents like this, he will keep losing to them."
tennis,3bwgn0,Gumpster07,10,Fri Jul 3 01:59:03 2015 UTC,"I must admit, when the draw came through, I had him to the QFs at least, but just thought Andy would have far too much for him on the grass at the QFs level.  But he is slowly becoming a ""non factor"" at Wimbledon. People spoke about how Andy had the toughest of the draws with the possibility of Nadal - Fed - Djokovic (QF - SF - F) and I just didn't feel it was really as tough as people made it out to be especially with Nadal lacking confidence this year."
tennis,3bwgn0,rafessi,8,Thu Jul 2 18:50:45 2015 UTC,"I think most did to be fair and with good reason, he had a fairly reasonable draw and I expected him to make the most of it.  I just don't see him being a factor at Wimbledon anymore, he's not getting any younger and he's physically declining. His best shot for another major is one of the other 3 slams."
tennis,3bwgn0,Gumpster07,5,Thu Jul 2 18:57:47 2015 UTC,"I do feel a fresh perspective is required. Just look at Fed, he's still getting himself within touching distance of Slam Finals, and doing well. Let's be honest Fed is older than Nadal and not getting any younger, so it'd be nice to see Rafa perhaps alter his game a little so he can adapt and get back out there challenging for more Slams."
tennis,3bwgn0,Gotebe,7,Thu Jul 2 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"Perhaps both Federer's body and spirit are younger though.  Nadal had to work both harder, for years."
tennis,3bwgn0,rafessi,2,Thu Jul 2 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, he certainly needs to do that, can't keep relying on his athleticism and physical game to get past opponents, he's clearly lost more than a step so he needs to come up with an agressive game plan especially against big hitters."
tennis,3bwgn0,seyakomo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:09:58 2015 UTC,"Surely his best shot for another major still has to be Roland Garros 2016, even with two more slams before it."
tennis,3bwgn0,jeffwingersballs,4,Thu Jul 2 19:36:24 2015 UTC,Time for some Lendl.
tennis,3bwgn0,Ersatz_Okapi,6,Thu Jul 2 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"I think Bjorn Borg would make a wonderful strategic advisor for Rafa. He clearly needs somebody other than Uncle Toni, who has made him into a god of clay while hurting his game on every other surface."
tennis,3bwgn0,rbace,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:40:09 2015 UTC,the guy that retired at 25 because he was burned out? lol
tennis,3bwgn0,darcys_beard,3,Thu Jul 2 20:10:22 2015 UTC,"I agree. He relied so heavily on his insane athleticism. That isn't there any more. He still has obvious talent, but he needs to change his game. Maybe it's time to give Toni a move sideways and update his coaching staff."
tennis,3bwgn0,plenty_of_time,3,Thu Jul 2 23:54:19 2015 UTC,It's physical much more than tactical. He has not returned to anything close to his previous top form. The Djokovic match at the French was clear evidence of that.
tennis,3bwgn0,rafessi,4,Thu Jul 2 19:26:48 2015 UTC,"But that's exactly my point, he can't keep relying on his physical game to bulldoze past opponents. He needs to create an aggressive mindset and game plan to get past them.  Plus, mentally he's at an all time low which doesn't help either."
tennis,3bwgn0,seyakomo,3,Thu Jul 2 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"I guess when he's spent his entire career being able to rely completely on his fitness allowing him to outlast basically any opponent no matter what else is going on, match after match, having even a tiny bit less of that must be a big hit on his confidence.   Like, Nadal's never really seemed like he had to conserve energy in the past. He's spent a career treating every point with the intensity of a match point, attempting to run down everything even on points that seem like certain lost causes. Now if he feels he can't be quite like that anymore, it must be almost like a distraction he's never really had to deal with."
tennis,3bwgn0,rafessi,2,Thu Jul 2 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"The thing is he's changed his game plan before but hasn't really sustained it over a period of time. USO 2010, USO series 2013 are tournaments where he played much more aggressively than he normally does, so he can certainly tweak his style a bit if he chooses to, but he has to fully commit to it which he seems unwilling to do."
tennis,3bwgn0,scouting4food,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"Is it really a tactical thing, though? I felt as though he had many opportunities to break today, and he just didn't have the confidence to take them. If he was even somewhat in form, I really do think that he would've won the match in straight sets.  I think it might be a risk to get in someone new to work with him, at this age. Right now, I feel as though it's purely a confidence issue."
tennis,3bwgn0,rafessi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:11:40 2015 UTC,"I think it might be a risk to get in someone new to work with him, at this age.   Federer did it, Novak and Andy did it at 27, so I don't see how that is an issue if he is really willing to commit to the idea.  I know confidence is low at the moment, but the fact that he keeps getting in these situations against lower ranked opponents on grass is not to do with confidence only, there is a strategic adjustment required.  How about him hiring a consultant only for the grass season ? That could work too I imagine..."
tennis,3bwgn0,scouting4food,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"I think it might be a bit more difficult for him since his uncle is his coach. I always feel as though it's riskier to get an outsider in when your main coach is part of your family, and in this case, even more so since Toni and Rafa Nadal have worked in a particular way since the very beginning of his career. The arguments for Federer and Murray would be that they've never really relied on one particular coach - they've gone through a few, so the risk is reduced. I do admit that Djokovic made a good call in acquiring Becker, though it was still risky.  You may be absolutely right though, but I just feel as though Rafa and his current team have worked out solutions to so many issues in the past, and that they'll get their heads around this one as well."
tennis,3bwgn0,rafessi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"The family thing is definitely a complication, that's why I said he could hire a consultant on a temp basis and see where it leads him, nothing wrong in trying something different.  But, I'm sure it won't happen simply because he's been coached by his uncle since he was 3 years old, that's more than a quarter of a century and a few months of bad results won't make him question his uncle's methods, it will be more of an emotional decision than anything.  The game is fast changing though and if you don't keep pace, you'll fall behind and I just hope this isn't the start of a permanent downfall for him."
tennis,3bwgn0,scouting4food,2,Thu Jul 2 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with all of that. Keeping my fingers crossed that the break before the hard-court season will do him some good, I feel as though he's tried a little too hard between the French Open and Wimbledon. You would think that a couple of weeks off would do his mind a world of good."

tennis,3bwgn0,fuzzyfeels,26,Thu Jul 2 18:54:49 2015 UTC,LOTS of new fans today and the first sight is Rafa getting his ass handed to him

tennis,3bwgn0,cone_eater,2,Thu Jul 2 19:07:40 2015 UTC,"Right on, welcome to the club! Great match, eh?  More thrillers to come at this year's Wimbledon too, I'm sure."
tennis,3bwgn0,politelycorrect,12,Thu Jul 2 19:05:44 2015 UTC,"2 of the people who beat Rafa at Wimby have rose a lot in the rankings (Rosol/Kyrgios). Hopefully Brown will follow, I want to see him regularly!"
tennis,3bwgn0,Spriq,8,Thu Jul 2 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"He's 30 already, but, then, he was able to keep up that insane pace for the entire match, so who knows?"
tennis,3bwgn0,3405193627242562145,4,Thu Jul 2 19:03:20 2015 UTC,Just look at him. He looks like the cardio king.
tennis,3bwgn0,Leckere,2,Thu Jul 2 19:15:29 2015 UTC,And he'd played four hours of doubles the day before or something ridiculous like that.
tennis,3bwgn0,Emphursis,10,Fri Jul 3 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"I only caught the last two games, but I couldn't believe how off his game Nadal looked.  2008 seems a very long time ago now."

tennis,3bwgn0,must1,8,Thu Jul 2 18:44:14 2015 UTC,"I used to hate Nadal when he was beating Federer in Wimbledon, now I enjoy him getting beat but I'm also feeling sorry for him."
tennis,3bwgn0,DudeAsInCool,4,Thu Jul 2 18:44:38 2015 UTC,Nadals play  is nothing to be ashamed about. What other top player could have handled Brown today?
tennis,3bwgn0,jeffwingersballs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:52:13 2015 UTC,Good question. We'll see who had the formula. I hope he maintains this level of play.
tennis,3bwgn0,DudeAsInCool,3,Thu Jul 2 21:01:29 2015 UTC,Tim Henman said he thinks Federer and Murray would have been better on handling Brown's returns.
tennis,3bwgn0,jeffwingersballs,3,Fri Jul 3 00:43:33 2015 UTC,"I wondered if it might have been a matchup issue for Nadal, but I also didn't want to make any excuses for him."
tennis,3bwgn0,TravisJLM,4,Fri Jul 3 00:51:16 2015 UTC,There's something about Rafa against these underdog big hitters. Does his forehand sit up too much? I don't know.
tennis,3bwgn0,freedoms_stain,2,Fri Jul 3 01:30:20 2015 UTC,It absolutely does.  He needs to accept that he can't keep playing his standard super top spin forehand on grass the way Murray had to accept that he couldn't keep playing his flatter forehand on clay.
tennis,3bwgn0,TravisJLM,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Nadal is perfectly capable of hitting a powerful flat forehand. He does it in practice. I guess he just goes back to what he feels comfortable with in match play. Super topspin has worked for him on grass in his 2 title years I guess, so he probably thinks that still works. He doesn't have the being tired from the French Open excuse this time either, you could probably say that was fair enough in his defeat to Darcis in particular. His backhand slice also is sometimes not deep enough/low enough over the net, which doesn't help as the slice is important on grass. I think Djokovic/Federer/Murray would have found a way to win against Brown in this form today, and that says a lot about Nadal's form and state of confidence. Can't be a coincidence now. 5 matches won in 4 years?"
tennis,3bwgn0,rbace,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:56:06 2015 UTC,"yes, when he's not hitting the ball he is more prone to upsets than the other elite players."
tennis,3bwgn0,TravisJLM,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:57:10 2015 UTC,The way he winds up for his shots needs insanely accurate timing compared to other players so yeah
tennis,3bwgn0,rbace,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:57:21 2015 UTC,The ball sits up in there strike zone.
tennis,3bwgn0,Spriq,9,Fri Jul 3 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"After that insane start Rafa seemed to get a nice handle on Brown's game in the second set and I turned to my friends and said, shaking my head: ""Well, it was fun for a second but now Rafa's figured him out. He'll destroy him in 4 without much sweat.""  I humbly retract my statement. Never have I been so glad to be wrong. What a game!"
tennis,3bwgn0,Jobin1616,7,Fri Jul 3 00:08:06 2015 UTC,Had Brown upsetting Nadal in my bracket! Yes!!!
tennis,3bwgn0,Perpete,3,Thu Jul 2 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"I had him too and I guess few others did. It says a lot about how Nadal form at Wimbledon is perceived nowadays.  Interestingly, you also chose Troicki as beating Brown next round."
tennis,3bwgn0,Jobin1616,2,Thu Jul 2 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured Troicki was a safer pick to go to the QFs because Brown and Pospisil are so unpredictable."
tennis,3bwgn0,Jobin1616,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"Well, FML. My bracket's gone to shit now that Raonic lost."

tennis,3bwgn0,AnalJibesVirus,2,Fri Jul 3 14:15:04 2015 UTC,what were the odds?
tennis,3bwgn0,Spriq,2,Fri Jul 3 14:17:43 2015 UTC,I thought about it for a second but then laughed it off. Darn!
tennis,3bwgn0,Jobin1616,3,Thu Jul 2 21:06:20 2015 UTC,"I had my regrets once I submitted my picks, but my man pulled through. The risk paid off!"
tennis,3bwgn0,RogerFedererFTW,21,Thu Jul 2 19:16:22 2015 UTC,"Well, i am not even mad. Most unorthodox upset ever."
tennis,3bwgn0,TenNes,25,Thu Jul 2 19:20:24 2015 UTC,"I don't get why? brown has beat him before, and out of the four last losses at Wimbledon for Nadal, Brown was the second highest rated out of the four."
tennis,3bwgn0,RogerFedererFTW,36,Thu Jul 2 18:45:44 2015 UTC,"It's not that it was the most unpredictable, but the tennis was so unusual, Brown hit passing shots, backhand smashes, second serve winners, dropshots, lobs, everything. Not your normal great performance, this was something special."
tennis,3bwgn0,TenNes,6,Thu Jul 2 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"Oh I see, then yeah, absolutely. In some ways it was one of the most complete displays of the variety of tennis shots I've seen in a long time. I love that kind of tennis, rather than the almost robotic topspin baseline rally tennis we see so often."
tennis,3bwgn0,RogerFedererFTW,7,Thu Jul 2 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"The thing is, this works only against one-dimensional(or in this case, fairly simple) tactics.  Fabrice Santoro, the magician, had also a unique play style, defeated an astonishing 18  different players who were No1 at some point in their careers.  He had 2-9 losing record against Federer because Federer's game was very complex, but against Safin, for example, who played a more straight-forward baseline game(like Nadal's but without spin) he had a 7-1 winning record.   My point is this refreshing high-risk kind of play works only against a certain type of opponents. Plus, you have to be on your day to pull off these shots consistently, which is extremely difficult to impossible, hence Brown's ranking."
tennis,3bwgn0,TenNes,2,Thu Jul 2 20:55:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah for sure. He definitely has to play, at least for himself, high variance tennis, and he has to be ""on.""  It seems to me though, that against the ""best"" players (top ten) he happens to have his ""on days"" as he has a 33% win percentage against the top ten, which is actually a very impressive win percentage, I think most players, even those who have been in the top 10, have about a 35% win percentage against the top ten.   Maybe this is for the reason that you stated, many players at the top are not as complex as a guy like Federer. They have perfected backcourt groundstrokes in such a way that they can overpower just about every player on the tour, and the only times they lose is when a player that comes around playing high variance tennis has an ""on"" day."
tennis,3bwgn0,RogerFedererFTW,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:45:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, although they get beaten when they face other ""simpler"" players. Ferrer and Djokovic are the perfect examples. Djokovic is struggling against Wawrinka when he is on, who definetely plays more aggresively.   That is maybe one of the reasons why prime Federer was so dominant, he had(has?) a game which made him capable to counter and beat almost every other game.(well, except Nadal)  That is why i think Kyrgios might have a better future than the other up-comers. Not because he played better, but because he has a slightly more aggressive style of play, and seems to elevate his game against big players."
tennis,3bwgn0,Elinozer,0,Thu Jul 2 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree. All players have difficulty playing against someone who just tries to finish every point as quickly as possible and no ""complexity"" will stop a player like Wawrinka on a perfect day. It's either aggression vs aggression, weathering the storm or counterpunching. Federer had the same problems as Djokovic in the FO."

""My motivation is try to be back to that level. But I've got to keep working.  ""If I don't make that happen then I've played five finals and taken the trophy back home two times, so that's not bad.""  ""It's not the end. It is a sad moment for me but life continues. My career, too,"" he added.   .  also  .  Rafael Nadal has been dragged in front of the press for a fuller explanation for his defeat.  ""It's not the end. It is a sad moment for me but life continues. My career, too. I have to keep going and working more than ever to try to change that dynamic,"" he said.  ""I am a good loser. When I am not that good, I always accept.  ""You know, at the end of the day, today I lost. Don't forget I played five finals here. I don't know how many players did that."""

I'm kinda glad he lost to Dustin to give him some time in the limelight, because if he had progressed to face Murray in the QF... it wouldn't have been pretty considering how Andy's playing, and at this point I don't want to see Rafa take a beatdown like that, he deserves better than that after what he's accomplished."
tennis,3bwgn0,Rac3318,5,Thu Jul 2 20:55:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I didn't expect Nadal to make it to the quarters, but if he had I would have said Murray in straight and it probably would have been even more brutal than the Madrid final. It would not have been pretty, that is for sure."

tennis,3bwgn0,HeelR-,2,Thu Jul 2 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"I know everyone says this every year when Nadal is doing it rough, but I think he's finished... I think he's entering his decline and we are not going to see a decline like Federer's with Nadal, where Federer is still able to maintain a high level of tennis despite not being able to win championships. I think The decline is going to much more dramatic for Nadal. Sad to see, but after losing the French Open for the first time in a while, I think that's a sign that Nadal's time is coming to an end."
tennis,3bwgn0,AmbientTech,2,Fri Jul 3 02:07:28 2015 UTC,"Nadal made so many unforced errors, that in a ordinary day Rafa could put them away without any doubt. The pressure created by Dustin w/ the aggression towards the net and lob's forced Rafa to not get any rhythm whatsoever and lose all the momentum that he gained from the first set and the second.   The third set, at that point there was nothing he could do, physically and mentally it was impossible, on the other side Dustin was clutch and his momentum built up from the 1st set carried throughout the matches and forced him to take even bigger shots that needs balls of steel to make it happen against one of the greatest.   At this point Rafa needs to recover asap and not let this get into his head and focus on the next one.."

Federer wasn't during 23-10. 2-0 or whatever it is =/= 23-10. Nor does 1-0 in slams = 9-2. Nadal has shown he has the edge over Federer everywhere (except maybe London WTF and Shanghai TMC). He's 3-0 vs. Federer at the AO, and won their last match there in straight sets. Dominated him on clay. Beat him Wimbledon 2008 and took him to 5 in Wimbledon 2007. Would likely have beaten him subsequent Wimbledons had they played.    I like Federer, but he turned out to be a product of a weak era with one of the worst backhands ever seen on tour and no power whatsoever. It didn't take much to expose this. A lefty who constantly abused his backhand and had the defense to retrieve his soft, ""precise"" shots was enough."
tennis,3bwz2x,BadBackhanderererer,12,Fri Jul 3 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"•Federer’s backhand was pretty good in his prime. He was dangerous with it when he didn't have to hit it on the run (cf. his 2005 Australian Open match against Safin, when he hit at least 4 crushing inside-out backhand return winners), and his slice was really special. Granted it wasn't Laver’s, but it was better than someone like Roddick’s, and a far cry from, say, Karlovic’s.  •In absolutely no way was or is Federer power-deficient. Nadal is a supernatural athlete; that is the main reason why he could hang with Federer in baseline rallies. Federer would absolutely murder short balls with his forehand, hit 130+ mph first serves, and crush first volleys."
tennis,3bwz2x,Lumos309,16,Fri Jul 3 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"one of the worst backhands ever seen on tour   Patently false. Federer's backhand is perhaps the second-best one-hander on tour (behind Wawrinka; Gasquet's flat backhand cannon is too rare to count) and probably top 10-20 overall depending on time period. It is only ""weak"" relative to the rest of his game where almost every other shot is among the best among everyone."

tennis,3c0xga,Noob_The_Legend,11,Fri Jul 3 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"For me personally, Serena is truly quite incomparable, both on and off the court. I genuinely believe that she hasn't gotten the respect she deserves for dominating women's tennis so long. It's literally once in a generation athlete that's capable of transcending tennis (much like Graf or Seles in their prime). Her serve (in placement, power, precision and clutchness), her speed on the court and footwork, the strength of her ground strokes and her mental tenacity have combined at such levels that Serena in her top form is unmatched. People love to say that the rest of the field is weak, but that's a discredit to what Serena has achieved.   She's gone through so many ups and downs in her life (including the fact she’s lost a half-sister in a shooting, she’s nearly died herself, she’s been booed and called names, she and her family been targeted for racism by the media, tennis fans, federations) that I wouldn't expect anything else than a real fighter behind those eyes. I think it's okay she's not a perfect individual. She has moments where she's been angry but I don't believe those alone define her (contrary to half of /r/tennis might believe). Appreciate her ferocity, her love of the sport, her unmatched tenacity. Take her as an individual who's been through a myriad of experiences and as a result, has achieved greatness."
tennis,3c0xga,unscientifc_method,3,Fri Jul 3 22:30:59 2015 UTC,this made me tear up. this was what I wasn't able to articulate. the lack of respect for serena is just appalling
tennis,3c0xga,SugoiBeans,10,Sat Jul 4 14:27:25 2015 UTC,"The mainstream tennis community criticizes Serena for her looks, her muscularity, and her vocal emotion on the court. She's had a few mistakes and small scandals (all about something she's said)  and that's usually what everyone brings up. When they talk about her game, they praise her athleticism and power and strength, which are true but don't give her credit in other areas of the game where she is leading the WTA. This select praise is due to a sexist perception. Moreover, there is a lot of collective hate for her because she is loud and expressively dramatic on and off court, and people castigate her for that because she is black and also a woman. She doesn't dope, and to make those allegations because you think she's muscular is wrong. She has always looked fit since she was a kid, that's just her body type. If Serena dopes based off her appearance then Michelle Obama dopes. Also, Serena actually isn't that big, there are bigger players than her on tour. She is only 5'9, ~130lbs I believe. The hivemin just loves to hate on her and most crowds root for her opponents because everyone loves an underdog. She is already the GOAT and she hasn't won the most majors yet. Disclosure: I've been a big fan of the Williams sisters and have been following them since I was a young boy in elementary school. I have memories of disappearing from all the kids at summer camp (I think I was 10 or 11 years old at the time), and breaking into a classroom just to watch the Williams sisters play each other in Wimbledon. Crazy to see the longevity of both. Unprecedented."

Barring some major, sport-wide and decade long conspiracy to keep her on top, if she took something at any point the world would have known about it.   Regarding her career, I am really split in appreciating how dominant a champion she is and feeling bad for all the girls she completely crushes without even trying.  The gap between her and the field is so huge, comparable to those magical 2004-2007 Federer years only sustained over a much, much longer period.  Yes, she loses sometimes, but her record over the rest of the top 10 (and Sharapova in particular) is embarrassing.    She is a world-class fighter and she has firmly established herself as one of (if not) the greatest players of all time, but in my opinion her dominance in her mid-30's makes this era of the WTA look really, really weak."

tennis,3bw288,14CatorcePalabras88,22,Thu Jul 2 16:56:48 2015 UTC,he's playing a lot of high risk tennis at the moment.   Thats the only way he can beat Nadal.
tennis,3bw288,Gumpster07,6,Thu Jul 2 17:12:40 2015 UTC,Oh I agree man. You have to play it to beat these top guys!
tennis,3bw288,BAshley1995,-3,Thu Jul 2 17:26:57 2015 UTC,There wasn't much variety in the first two sets. Drop volley after drop volley. It just feels that way because noone serves and volleys any more.
tennis,3bw288,Gumpster07,12,Thu Jul 2 18:05:53 2015 UTC,"""there wasn't much variety""  I dunno what you were watching, but when a player changes the pace of returns, and takes hard hits from Nadal to making drop shots, then yes there was variety. The serve-volley routine isn't in the variety, but that wasn't what I alluded to, I alluded to his playstyle when returning Nadal serves, and some of the rallies."

tennis,3bw288,EarnestlyEvan,12,Thu Jul 2 18:15:44 2015 UTC,Honestly I see Wawrinka taking his place soon
tennis,3bw288,chief_running_joke,4,Thu Jul 2 18:20:44 2015 UTC,You think he can become consistent?
tennis,3bw288,Oooch,2,Thu Jul 2 18:27:48 2015 UTC,"This tournament will answer that question, he's been more consistent than he was last year but last year he completely dropped off after the Aussie open, he's played well so far this tournament, I think as he does better he'll become more confident and then play his really aggressive style well"
tennis,3bw288,goodstuff10,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:32:53 2015 UTC,"I mean you can certainly make a fair argument Stan is the better player right now, but if you mean in a sense of being a new ""big 3 or big 4"" absolutely not. But in interviews I've read Stan acknowledges this and is fine with it. For sure see another major at least from him though"
tennis,3bw288,EarnestlyEvan,4,Thu Jul 2 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"I guess I am not thinking about legacy right now, just the current situation, Rafa and Fed are fading, Djokovic is on top, Wawrinka is rising, and Murray... Is just well, Murray."
tennis,3bw288,goodstuff10,9,Thu Jul 2 18:26:25 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I think Fed is still at a ridiculously high level, it's just the guy ahead of him is playing legendary right now. Big fan of Stan though. Love that he looks just like an average dude too. Like a guy you'd see having a smoke at the patio."
tennis,3bw288,EarnestlyEvan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:31:39 2015 UTC,"That's true, I'm not denying Fed is still amazing, but he hasn't won a slam in a while."
tennis,3bw288,Personacorona,0,Thu Jul 2 18:34:35 2015 UTC,Fed is not fading at all
tennis,3bw288,EarnestlyEvan,13,Thu Jul 2 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"You can't deny that compared to his past self he has definitely fallen off, I think he has a shot at winning this slam but Father Time is undefeated."
tennis,3bw288,Personacorona,6,Thu Jul 2 18:33:04 2015 UTC,"Obviously, but he's not ""fading"", he's playing pretty well in 2015 actually. Obviously if you compare him at 33 to him at 24 you're going to see that he's playing badly. In my opinion Fed right now is playing at the same level now as he was in 2011, and maybe 2012."
tennis,3bw288,EarnestlyEvan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"He won Wimbledon in 2012, if he does that again, I will agree with you."
tennis,3bw288,like-a-bbas,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:41:16 2015 UTC,"He's gotten significantly more consistent this year. If he can keep it up he'll be a top contender for years  to come.   With saying that, I'm rooting for Nishikori if he'll rest up and get that calf injury sustained."
tennis,3bw288,jeffwingersballs,3,Thu Jul 2 19:32:11 2015 UTC,Certainly not at Wimbledon. The commentator mentioned that this is the only tournament where Nadal won't backup off the baseline when against serve. I don't know how relevant that is.
tennis,3bw288,jomns,20,Thu Jul 2 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"Thing is, as well as Brown played, he'll probably lose in straight sets to the next guy. Seems to be a common motif in tennis"
tennis,3bw288,wehaveawinner,16,Thu Jul 2 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"This match is brilliantly entertaining, im not usually a fan of tennis and know little more than the big names and rules of the sport. One question, is Wimbledon seen as the most prestigious tennis tournament? Only asking as a big deal is made of it in the UK (prime slot on both BBC channels) and little else is noted of the other tournaments.   May have to start watching tennis a bit more after this performance by Brown and Nadal!"
tennis,3bw288,lmaotank,24,Thu Jul 2 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"To be honest, a lot of tennis matches aren't always this action packed, but nonetheless, tennis is quite entertaining. Wimbledon is one of the Grand Slams, of which there are four including Wimbledon.  The list is Australian Open, Roland Garros (a.k.a French Open), Wimbledon and the US Open. One could argue that Wimbledon has a more robust history than any other majors mentioned above, but in modern tennis, all Majors are very prestigious. But I do have to mention that Wimbledon's more strict rules (such as allowing only white shirts), gives it more ""prestigious"" feel than other Majors."
tennis,3bw288,wehaveawinner,2,Thu Jul 2 18:09:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info mate. I was basing my assumption of Wimbledon on Andy Murray having so much attention running up to and finally winning it - as far as i could tell he had already won a few of the other tournaments. So wasn't sure if thats just based on his nationality and winning at 'home', or if Wimbledon was just the one to win. Thanks again!"
tennis,3bw288,walleigh,3,Thu Jul 2 18:21:18 2015 UTC,Yeah it was mostly a big deal because he was the first British man to win Wimbledon since 1936.
tennis,3bw288,ChaoticMidget,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"In general, I think most people consider Wimbledon the most recognizable and therefore prestigious of the majors. It's one of those things where it has a name unto itself, as opposed to the British Open or something like that. In that same vein, I think the French is regarded as second most well known, followed by the US and then the Australian."
tennis,3bw288,plokmasdf,9,Fri Jul 3 06:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Wimbledon is widely regarded as the most prestigious tourney. I love watching tennis you should try watching more matches this week!"
tennis,3bw288,wehaveawinner,2,Thu Jul 2 18:09:11 2015 UTC,"I definitely will be! Funnily enough I was in Wimbledon yesterday playing a football tournament, and my boss had tickets to one of the matches (I think Serena Williams?). Just never really given it a chance I guess."
tennis,3bw288,Gumpster07,4,Thu Jul 2 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"Wimbledon is seen by ""many"" players as the Greatest Tournament of them all because it's a traditional event, which is also the oldest. The other Slam's have their charms, and of course as a player you want to win those, but playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon is like the biggest prize for all players.  The reason why BBC show Wimbledon more so than any of the other grand slams, is the fact that Wimbledon is regarded as one of 20 sporting events that should be shown legally on free TV, BBC hold the rights to the tournament in the UK. When British players make waves in other grand slams (US Open/Aussie Open mainly) they do get rights to the matches featuring Murray at Semi-Final/Final stages in extreme circumstances. Roland Garros (The French) is hosted on ITV4.  However, yeah you should watch more tennis, it is a vastly interesting sport to watch, considering coaches don't have any input into a match, so it's down to the player to work out how to beat their opponent. A few entertaining players to watch would be Monfilis, Brown, Kyrgios & of course Federer."
tennis,3bw288,TenNes,6,Thu Jul 2 18:33:55 2015 UTC,"I think it probably is the most prestigious of the grand slams, it is definitely top three, along with US Open and the French Open.   If you like Brown's athletic style of play, you will likely enjoy watching players like Kyrgios and Monfils, all very athletic and great showmen."
tennis,3bw288,wehaveawinner,2,Thu Jul 2 18:07:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right, the US Open and French Open are the only others I would recognise. Are they still in the competition now? Definitely have to give them a look in, thanks!"
tennis,3bw288,TenNes,6,Thu Jul 2 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"Both are still in. Monfils won today, Kyrgios is playing a huge big serving Canadian tomorrow I think. That will be a match of pure power, you should watch it for sure.   Kyrgios is everything you wouldn't expect from a tennis player, he showboats, talks trash, yells, shows lots of emotion, he is young, wears crazy styles, especially his hair, he is such a showman."
tennis,3bw288,wehaveawinner,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"Great, I'll make sure I watch those. Kyrgios definitely sounds just as entertaining as Brown, will be interesting to watch him play tomorrow."
tennis,3bw288,TenNes,2,Thu Jul 2 18:27:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, if they end up showimg the end of the Dolgopolov match, you will likely enjoy that, dolgo plays an unorthodox interesting style as well. He actually beat Nadal like a week ago as well."
tennis,3bw288,avaliantheel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:45:29 2015 UTC,Don't get your hopes up too much for Brown.  It's kind of an unofficial rule of professional men's tennis that a player who upsets a big name will lose in the following round.
tennis,3bw288,Personacorona,9,Fri Jul 3 13:18:23 2015 UTC,"AO is far from being prestigious, nobody really started showing up there until the late 80's. In terms of prestige, it goes: Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open"

tennis,3bw288,HeelR-,8,Thu Jul 2 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"Gosh Brown is playing world class tennis. High risk-tennis is the only way he can beat a quality Rafa.   HOWEVER you've gotta feel sorry for Rafa, you know it's not his day when he has unforced errors on his forehand, the one which he misses 0.5/10. Props to him, came back after 6 months and still keeps fighting hard!  By far the most entertaining match in Wimbledon 2015 alongside the Cilic-Berankis match."
tennis,3bw288,Tuga88,13,Thu Jul 2 17:10:19 2015 UTC,As a Rafa fan this match is hard to watch because it's the confirmation that Rafa is done at the very top imo.

tennis,3bw288,khfreek,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"He didn't play well in the last three Wimbledon losses, but his forehand has never been as bad as it was today against Brown."
tennis,3bw288,ravendward,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:25:50 2015 UTC,I honestly think he was just outplayed. It's easy to think his forehand wasn't on when he didn't even get a chance to get into any average length rallies.
tennis,3bw288,khfreek,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"Dustin played an awkward game for Nadal to handle, but he missed really easy forehands. There's no way Nadal at even 80% of his ability would lose to Dustin Brown, on any surface."
tennis,3bw288,King-Kongs-Dad,9,Fri Jul 3 02:02:25 2015 UTC,"Murray went through a similar thing and dropped down to 10th after surgery. Looking at players like Fed at 33, there's no reason why Nadal can't regain his form."
tennis,3bw288,Ploax,14,Fri Jul 3 15:19:37 2015 UTC,"Nadal's game is way more physical than Federer's though, so the comparison doesn't hold as much, but he can surely still come back to being on top.  It is being rumored that maybe Toni goes to captain the Fed team and Moya becomes his coach."
tennis,3bw288,patsmad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:27:14 2015 UTC,"Although Nadal is at pretty much exactly the same age as sampras and fed when they won their second to last majors and fell into two years of people wondering if they were done. Both of them then only had one win (so far) in their thirties.  Nadal is at just the right age to start dropping out of top form and starting to need ""luck"" to have a chance at any major"
tennis,3bw288,ThatLiam,6,Thu Jul 2 18:42:40 2015 UTC,Two-handed backhand cross court drive volley from Brown... Incredible.

It's awesome to see someone with a fairly unique (in the current professional landscape) play style go out and really compete with a top player. As silly as his shot selection appears, it seems to be working for Brown AND he appears to be having some fun."

tennis,3bw288,styuR,4,Thu Jul 2 17:24:22 2015 UTC,Brown is a drop shot king.
tennis,3bw288,yiyiyiyi,5,Thu Jul 2 17:45:18 2015 UTC,I've never been a Nadal guy but I'm rooting for him like crazy here. Dunno why.
tennis,3bw288,chief_running_joke,4,Thu Jul 2 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"Guess it shouldn't come as a surprise anymore when Nadal gets knocked out of Wimbledon early. Still, amazing performance from Brown. Hope he goes deep."

tennis,3bw288,brightfalls,3,Thu Jul 2 18:49:49 2015 UTC,Jesus two double faults in one game  edit: make that three
tennis,3bw288,politelycorrect,3,Thu Jul 2 18:57:22 2015 UTC,Brown had the third! If Rafa wants this he'll have to do it in five!
tennis,3bw288,slopnessie,3,Thu Jul 2 17:44:15 2015 UTC,What is going on!! Come on brown
tennis,3bw288,styuR,3,Thu Jul 2 18:09:41 2015 UTC,Sweet Jesus what a sprint for that shot. Can see how much it means to Brown.

tennis,3bw288,deptford,3,Thu Jul 2 18:37:05 2015 UTC,Match point  SPOILER
tennis,3bw288,Bamkill,4,Thu Jul 2 18:41:13 2015 UTC,"This has probably been the best tennis match I've seen since Roddick and El Aynaoui back in 2003, amazing tennis from Brown. I cant help but feel Rafa is a shadow of his former self. He was missing open forehands, the shot which carried him through the French Open countless times. I feel he needs to take a break from the sport, skip the US open and re-evaluate his career and then if he feels up to it come back for the Aus Open."
tennis,3bw288,duskhat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:20:48 2015 UTC,As a Rafa fan I agree with this. His mental slump has been ridiculous and it looks like he could use the time off
tennis,3bw288,fuzzyfeels,6,Thu Jul 2 18:48:54 2015 UTC,The time off was what did him in this year. I think he should compete in the US summer and try to play as much as he could with no pressure whatsoever. Nothing really was expected out of this Wimby run. He could benefit with a bump in his ranking to start off fresh in 2016.
tennis,3bw288,duskhat,3,Thu Jul 2 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I change my mind"
tennis,3bw288,Aj16ay,2,Thu Jul 2 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, clean sweep on service from Brown"
tennis,3bw288,JonnyArtois,2,Thu Jul 2 19:04:39 2015 UTC,That attempted return...just why.
tennis,3bw288,Aj16ay,2,Thu Jul 2 17:38:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, Nadal is really in a bad spot now. Could easily lose this set"
tennis,3bw288,quassus,2,Thu Jul 2 17:41:35 2015 UTC,I wanna watch a Brown vs. Monfils match; they seem to have the same sort of demeanor + showmanship with similar aptitudes for insane shotmaking.

tennis,3bw288,thecodingdude,2,Thu Jul 2 18:04:32 2015 UTC,Naffael Nadal has always been a bit weak on grass sadly to say =(
tennis,3bw288,jeffwingersballs,6,Thu Jul 2 18:16:18 2015 UTC,And yet he's won twice and been to five finals overall.
tennis,3bw288,worcs,4,Thu Jul 2 18:22:09 2015 UTC,Got to 5 finals in 6 years and the one he missed he was injured for. Not sure if that's  entirely accurate

tennis,3bw288,rafaknight,5,Thu Jul 2 18:42:49 2015 UTC,Every. Fucking. Year. Rafa gets one of this all-or-nothing dudes. Fuck sake. Its like he can't play vs them.
tennis,3bw288,BlatantFix,5,Thu Jul 2 19:05:15 2015 UTC,"I mean, part of the problem is once its starts happening its even more likely to keep going. I think a lot of players look at Rafa at Wimbledon now as a real opportunity to get an upset and just go for it. This year was even more likely than any others the way he's been playing."
tennis,3bw288,seyakomo,3,Thu Jul 2 18:02:27 2015 UTC,Was Darcis an all-or-nothing dude?
tennis,3bw288,rafaknight,2,Thu Jul 2 18:19:03 2015 UTC,"Yes. Consistency was not in his vocabulary. He played all or nothing that match, won, and now where's the last time you've heard of him?"
tennis,3bw288,Volvulus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:30:33 2015 UTC,The fact that he withdrew the next round would partly suggest it.
tennis,3bw288,machidaad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:48:51 2015 UTC,all or nothing implies high risk. thats not really the case when it keeps happening.
tennis,3bw288,rafaknight,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:42:08 2015 UTC,And firing forehands and backhands like crazy isnt high risk? It was going in. Good for him. It's not gonna happen again next round.
tennis,3bw288,machidaad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:56:42 2015 UTC,Players aren't playing high risk against nadal if they keep beating him.  Whatever is causing nadal to lose is his weakness. You don't get unlucky year after year in nearly all the grass tournaments.
tennis,3bw288,btaz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:00:51 2015 UTC,Kyrgios is not an all or nothing dude. This surface suits his game very well. Last year's loss was not a fluke.
tennis,3bw288,thecodingdude,4,Fri Jul 3 00:30:47 2015 UTC,Unlucky Nadal - he's not the best grass player but Brown was inspired out there today. Good and very entertaining match.

tennis,3bw288,MyNameIsDan_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:46:13 2015 UTC,Is it Nadal that's playing poor or Brown's playstyle that has Nadal on tilt? Haven't seen him so vulnerable early on in the tournament.
tennis,3bw288,white__box,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:48:17 2015 UTC,He did lose in the 2nd round of Wimbledon back in 2012.

tennis,3bw288,korencek,-7,Thu Jul 2 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"Just be warned his interview is almost cringe-worthy to watch. You can tell he is completely out of it following the win, and so he just talks and talks about absolutely nothing!  Edit: Downvotes for stating a fact? Credit to the guy for winning, and he seems like a nice guy, but his interview was a little bizarre.."

tennis,3bw288,BlatantFix,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:03:54 2015 UTC,I fear that Brown won't get so psyched against Troicki. I love to see him play this good.

tennis,3bw288,thedreee,-4,Thu Jul 2 23:59:17 2015 UTC,"You've gotta feel sorry for Rafa. There's only so much he can give and do against Brown's type of play. I'm pretty sure both Djokovic and Roger would've struggled too. A fully fit 100% Rafa would've had no problems going through in straight sets.  Props to Brown, played out of his mind."
tennis,3bw288,HeelR-,6,Thu Jul 2 18:52:34 2015 UTC,"Djokovic and Roger would've struggled  A fully fit 100% Rafa would've had no problems going through in straight sets   Genuinely, why do you think a fully fit Rafa would have been comfortable but Roger and Novak would have struggled?"
tennis,3bw288,arturoman,2,Thu Jul 2 18:42:47 2015 UTC,I think all three would have some degree of trouble but take it in 4 sets max if they're playing well
tennis,3bw288,Midwest_Product,-2,Thu Jul 2 18:45:21 2015 UTC,"No i meant in this match, with the way the 3 played the tournament so far, Roger and Djokovic would've struggled too.   In the usual manner, when the 3 are on top of their game this would be another 2n round tournament that they go in and come out w/ a win."
tennis,3bw288,Aj16ay,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:48:43 2015 UTC,"I mean, I haven't watched Djokovic so far this tournament so I can't comment on him, but after Federer's dismissal of Querrey I really don't see that he would have done. On the other hand, this is the fourth time in a row Nadal has failed to reach the quarters, and only even past the second round in one of those attempts. I'm not sure his fitness has that much to do with it anymore on grass."
tennis,3bw288,Volvulus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:48:52 2015 UTC,Its his second serve that is bad and players are taking advantage of that!  They're hitting the ball hard back at him and with the balls being faster on grass he can't really do much.
tennis,3bw288,arturoman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"There's no secret grass is Nadal's weak spot but his injuries and recovery didn't help him out either. I think Nadal didn't expect the quick change of pace and lob-shots which made him confused as to what he'll counter with.   Novak played brilliant so far, out of the 3 i'd say Novak would probably beat Brown but on a day like this Brown can beat even Roger and Novak."
tennis,3bw288,freedoms_stain,-9,Thu Jul 2 19:07:53 2015 UTC,Why does this match get it's own thread where all of the other matches do not?

tennis,3c0361,avaliantheel,4,Fri Jul 3 16:07:32 2015 UTC,It's just pretty hot in London at the moment so players are sweating more. Nothing more than that.
tennis,3c0361,PureDarkness93,-4,Fri Jul 3 15:39:33 2015 UTC,I don't know. I just don't remember anyone doing it back in my playing days and I think it's disgusting and unsanitary for the ballpersons to be handling players' filthy towels. Pro players are much more prima donna than they used to be.
tennis,3c0361,Sebastien447,2,Fri Jul 3 17:10:22 2015 UTC,"I second your opinion. I like how Agassi in his book discussed how he wouldn't let the U.S. Open kids carry out his bags for them because of how ridiculous pro players are treated now. It was 71 degrees at Wimbledon today, not hot enough to towel off every point."

It was a complete shocker that this complete unknown was taking it to Nadal and WON the match!! Every year after 2012, while still a big upset, doesn't feel quite as big as watching Rosol destroy Nadal on center court in the fifth set with nerves of steel."
tennis,3byq1w,Phoenix_1984,3,Fri Jul 3 06:52:32 2015 UTC,"To be fair, all these guys have played the match of their lives against Rafa, except for Kyrgios, who at the moment it's probably his best match, but he'll probably do better eventually."
tennis,3byq1w,bustedracquet,3,Fri Jul 3 07:11:59 2015 UTC,Brown always plays incredibly against nadal. I think game style - wise brown has a more favorable match up against him than most players but he seems to take it up a notch for rafa

tennis,3bv73e,StopThisULameass,49,Thu Jul 2 19:49:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he put himself out there and made a solid prediction with solid analysis. He just happened to be wrong. He didn't say something stupid; he just turned out to be incorrect. If bloggers and/or journalists got panned and gave up for every wrong prediction, there would be no journalists or bloggers. Or none would have the guts to make a prediction. He had the guts to make one and then had the guts to own up to it when he was wrong. I'm impressed by that, at least."
tennis,3bv73e,yesh222,8,Thu Jul 2 19:54:58 2015 UTC,"And he made a good analysis of why he did lose, and his prediction that turned out to be wrong almost put into perspective that Nadal very well me be on the decline, made the author accept that he isn't as good as he used to be."

tennis,3bv73e,yesh222,2,Fri Jul 3 02:22:40 2015 UTC,"Picking the upset and being right would've been impressive. Picking the overwhelming favorite is not a solid prediction.  It's a bit hard trying to find the odds now that the match has ended, but Nadal winning outright was paying around 1.10 (1, 2). So no there weren't many people talking about Brown."
tennis,3bv73e,nighthound1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:24:16 2015 UTC,"What solid prediction? His reasons don't belong in a tennis article. ""It's Britain not Germany!"", ""It's a slam not a 250 ATP event!"". At least in his apology analysis he had real tennis tall included."

tennis,3bv73e,831pm,3,Thu Jul 2 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"The author doesn't give Brown enough credit.  Nadal had to drastically change his serving strategy after the first set.  He was initially going for big first serves but Brown was reading them and teeing off on them.  Because of this, Nadal went back to a slower spinner serve to keep Brown honest.  This actually worked and Brown was not able to just walk serves back at Nadal's feet while he was still in the service motion.  Also, all those drop shots were smart.  Brown has a better chance playing patty cake at the net with Nadal than trying to slug away from the baseline.  Also, this is the reason he went for so many big second serves....to keep the match from the baseline.  Alot of people felt Nadal was exiting first week because he no longer has his main weapon...his speed.  He is now going to move on to his worst surface, fast hard courts and its down hill from here."

You write the name of every different shot there is on little pieces of paper. Then you let Dustin pull 3 out of a hat.  Today he obviously ended up with 'Backhand return', 'Drop shot' and 'Superman Swing'."
tennis,3butc9,Gumpster07,5,Thu Jul 2 16:35:53 2015 UTC,BOOMBASTIC RETURN.... should be emphasised as a way to finish a set off.

tennis,3butc9,startinup,19,Thu Jul 2 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"The only problem with being a Federer fan is that he finishes his matches so fast that if you don't pay attention to the stream you miss the whole thing.  A couple hours ago Lisicki was on, and I check back to see Nadal.  Shiiiiit... This is actually a good match, and Brown is playing really well. If Nadal will be taken out before the second week, earlier is more likely since the grass is still fast and low bouncing."
tennis,3butc9,xscientist,19,Thu Jul 2 16:12:12 2015 UTC,Brown's style is unreal. I love that he is chipping and charging off his forehand.

tennis,3butc9,BMKingPrime27,13,Thu Jul 2 17:01:54 2015 UTC,Ha!  Dustin forgot he's at Wimbledon again and didn't make us of the ball boys.  Keeping a ball in his pocket during a return game.
tennis,3butc9,TenNes,12,Thu Jul 2 17:39:51 2015 UTC,I love how Brown keeps balls in his pockets on return games.

tennis,3butc9,saviouroftheweak,7,Thu Jul 2 18:21:52 2015 UTC,Some are scraping around waiting for this big game to make their name. For Brown it's been a long time coming it seems. Pros are pros after all.

tennis,3butc9,BAshley1995,6,Thu Jul 2 19:06:54 2015 UTC,Who will advance to the QFs from section 4?   The winner of Raonic/Kyrgios. I think Raonic.
tennis,3butc9,MCallanan,3,Thu Jul 2 16:11:27 2015 UTC,I really think Gasquet can make it through the quarterfinals.. Obviously in the minority though.
tennis,3butc9,blekginger,5,Thu Jul 2 10:03:24 2015 UTC,"Really tight to call between Dimi, Gas, Raonic, and Kyrgios. Could be either and it wouldn't be that big of a surprise. I've gone for Milos though."
tennis,3butc9,MCallanan,6,Thu Jul 2 11:38:23 2015 UTC,Kyrgios is not a good returner so I suspect Raonic should get through him a lot easier than many are predicting. Dimitrov vs. Gasquet should be an interesting match. Dimitrov has a habit of playing himself into a defensive position so I'm wondering if Gasquet will be willing to be aggressive to take control of these points. If he does I think he will win.
tennis,3butc9,KeiNishikori,13,Thu Jul 2 12:21:43 2015 UTC,So Kyrgios.

tennis,3butc9,xmissgolightly,7,Thu Jul 2 13:14:08 2015 UTC,Could someone ELI5 what the differences are between playing Centre Court with the roof closed vs. open?  The pundits always mention it like 'he needs to watch out if the roof is closed!'
tennis,3butc9,blekginger,10,Thu Jul 2 14:15:18 2015 UTC,Basically the difference in air means play is a lot quicker if the roof is closed.
tennis,3butc9,derf82,6,Thu Jul 2 11:01:23 2015 UTC,"The big change is not the roof, but the air.  When the roof is closed, it activates a large air conditioning system that changes the humidity and temperature, which affects playing conditions.  It also eliminates wind, which can affect some players more than others."
tennis,3butc9,dropshot,5,Thu Jul 2 11:12:05 2015 UTC,"It plays more like an indoor court with no wind or sun or temperature issues.  Federer's play generally improves, for example, playing indoors even though he believes tennis should be played outdoors."

tennis,3butc9,MCallanan,8,Thu Jul 2 18:39:04 2015 UTC,Querrey is playing some pretty good tennis. He certainly has the skills to push Federer.

tennis,3butc9,bustedracquet,7,Thu Jul 2 14:01:22 2015 UTC,"Anybody surprised they put Dimitrov-Gasquet on center? There's Raonic vs. Kyrgios, or Stan vs. Verdasco, or Cilic vs. Isner. Dimitrov is the lowest seed out of Stan, Milos, and Cilic, and has the least amount of accomplishments out of all of them."

tennis,3bx4d6,Glorious_Tale_Comrad,5,Fri Jul 3 02:44:25 2015 UTC,Djokovic vs Stan 2013 Ozzie Open quarterfinal. The level of play was ridiculous. It wasn't for the championship but its my favorite match ever.
tennis,3bx4d6,LaidbackSam,4,Fri Jul 3 02:59:01 2015 UTC,"For me, it is the final of the Australian open in 2012. That was not just a tennis match, but a life lesson in pain, suffering and perseverance.   Sure Djokovic won the match, but I'm sure even the most ardent Djokovic fans would've been awe stricken at the level they both played. From 1st rally to the last, each rally looked like a glorified battle in the war of attrition. At the end it was really hard to accept that one of them had won because both went toe to toe for 5hrs and 53 mins that I was unable to find who was better at the end."
tennis,3bx4d6,startinup,3,Fri Jul 3 03:54:36 2015 UTC,"Everyone knows about the Wimbledon Final in 2008 as arguably the greatest match of all time, but I would like to add some variety and say that the 2009 final was arguably better.   I think that the drama of the 2009 Final was even better though. You go into the match and Roddick has a terrible head to head with Federer, so people didn't know what to expect. Many probably expected Fed to win in straights. Roddick came out and was clutch, I remember Federer got so many chances on the Roddick serve where Federer would go up love-40 or 15 - 40 and Roddick would fire a couple beautiful 135+ mph serves which were either aces or a one two punch opportunity. It was definitely a battle of serves, classic Wimbledon.  What made this match great was the back and forth where you think Federer has to break serve here and suddenly they're back at deuce or Roddick has a good chance, then 4 points later Federer holds.   Another part of this match that makes it a classic is that it went deep in the fifth set, 16 -14. The Fifth set always has the most potential for drama and tension because a 4 points could mean the end of the match. Each service game that went by with each player holding ratcheted up the tension a little bit until finally Federer broke and the rest is history. Another thing that made this match great was that Federer was trying to beat Sampras Grand slam record.  Lastly, the level of play was so high that the amount of winners hit was ridiculous. Federer hit 50 aces and 107 winners, while Roddick had 27 aces and 74 winners.   The most important things for GMOAT is that:   The Match is for high stakes (Grand Slam final, potential to make history, etc.) The Match is very unpredictable and back and forth, where the winner is a toss up. The Match has a lot of winners/aces and clutch moments, where the server has to come back against the odds.    I think the most important aspect of any great sporting event is tension, it must be unpredictable with shifts in momentum, with both sides fighting tooth and nail to win."
tennis,3bx4d6,HankScorpio4Pres,2,Fri Jul 3 02:45:29 2015 UTC,"Federer - Nadal in 2008 is the best I've seen. If you're looking for a stat that gives it that title you're never going to find it, there will always be a match with more or less of something. But the two that stand out the most for this one is the difference between winners and unforced errors and the break point conversion, which show that they played at their best when the stakes were highest.  The other reason you're never going to find that stat is because part of what makes it so great is that it was a grand slam final, is it was the final of a 250 event it would be great, but no one would call it the best of all time."
tennis,3bx4d6,Personacorona,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:09:26 2015 UTC,"So your match and your two parameters were the first on my list as well. I don't think 1 stat defines anything. But the combinations of various parameters controls a game. It is a matter of which ones are the most prevalent in this particular debate.   I agree, a grand slam final is weighted more than a 250 or even a 1000 but then think back to the time when 1000 events were 5 setters like Federer-Nadal in Rome. But again, this is just another parameter that probably factors into ""excitement""."
tennis,3bx4d6,mbrw12,2,Thu Jul 2 23:26:08 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the highest quality match of all time was Federer vs. Safin Australian Open 2005. However, quality of play is only one facet. The other facets are drama and significance. I consider Federer Nadal Wimbledon 2008 to be the greatest match of all time because, while the quality was maybe 10% lower than in the Fed Safin match, there was so much more drama, with Fed storming back, the rain delays and the skies turning to pitch black, and significance as Fed's 65 streak on grass was ended, his 5 in a row was ended, it was Rafa's first Wimbledon, Rafa became the first man to win RG and Wimbledon since Borg, and Federer's kingdom was overthrown, while the Federer Safin match, which had plenty of drama, was only a semifinal match. It was because of this that I rank it #1.5 on the list."
tennis,3bx4d6,SwissBliss,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:31:00 2015 UTC,Djokovic vs Del Potro Wimbledon Semifinal from a couple of years ago. By far the best I've seen (alongside that 2008 Rafa/Fed game)
tennis,3bx4d6,rbace,0,Fri Jul 3 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"Fed Rafa 2007-08 is widely considered the best of this generation.  However my favorite is Stan vs. Rafa AO Final 2014. It was just such good tennis for parts of it, then drama, and a new champion of Grand Slams that gave everyone hope to beat the Big 3."
tennis,3bx4d6,SwissBliss,2,Thu Jul 2 22:24:14 2015 UTC,You are one of the first to give a unique answer so far. I know what is widely considered but I am hoping for other results and reasoning!   Excitement factor/Drama is an interesting parameter to think about and even the idea of quantifying has me doodling on my whiteboard right now.
tennis,3bx4d6,rbace,3,Thu Jul 2 23:22:16 2015 UTC,You can't have the greatest match of all time be a match where one player is severely hobbled. That was a bizarre match and super disappointing.
tennis,3bx4d6,SwissBliss,0,Fri Jul 3 00:00:14 2015 UTC,"First set was 100% fine and Stan dominated. 2nd Set Nadal gets injured and Stan continues to beat him. 3rd set Rafa goes off the court and gets a magic potion while Stan gets pissed at the umpire. Rafa comes back on shirtless and gets booed by everyone. Now Rafa is back to normal and Stan is deconcentrated. Drama. Stan focuses again, and he wins his first grand slam, and starts a new era of tennis. Unbelievable match"
tennis,3bx4d6,rbace,2,Fri Jul 3 00:18:57 2015 UTC,"it's not even close to one of the greatest matches of all time, matter in fact the crowd was deflated afterwards. The Wawa Djockovich match in the semis was of much better quality. You just love the narrative."

His body can't sustain the counterpunching that he's used to at this point."
tennis,3bwfy6,Occitzer,20,Thu Jul 2 19:09:07 2015 UTC,No but it might be time for a new coach.
tennis,3bwfy6,SouareInTheMorning,7,Thu Jul 2 18:45:11 2015 UTC,"Yes this has been my thought this entire season.  He needs a fresh perspective on his game from an outsider.  Unfortunately, Uncle Tony has been his coach for so long, and he's family so it may not be easy for Nadal to do that"
tennis,3bwfy6,Whata_Turkey,11,Thu Jul 2 18:59:16 2015 UTC,Maybe bring in someone new with Toni remaining as a mental/spiritual mentor. Like Djoker's Vajda/Boris duo or something. I think at this point Toni should realize Rafa's need for something like that and shouldn't make a fuss over it.
tennis,3bwfy6,fuzzyfeels,5,Thu Jul 2 19:45:11 2015 UTC,Toni is cancerous and acts like he created Nadal.  He was a pillar when Rafa was weakminded but now he has no input and acts over important.
tennis,3bwfy6,artosis420,2,Thu Jul 2 20:09:49 2015 UTC,He seems to be stifling him. Look at my last couple of posts about how he doesn't adapt to other surfaces.
tennis,3bwfy6,scotty1987,2,Thu Jul 2 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like he should demote Toni and bring up Roig. Roig has helped Nadal in past tournaments without Toni and has even brought him to win tournaments like Indian Wells 2013. In my opinion it is too late to bring in someone new. Sadly, Rafa doesn't have much time left. Federer brought in Edberg knowing he would play for a while still(maybe even to or past the 2016 olympics) and with these new coaches it takes a little time for success, look at Djokovic-Becker, Federer-Edberg, and Wawrinka-Norman. Rafa doesn't really have this time so Roig would definitely be the obvious option here."
tennis,3bwfy6,PokeMyPillow,3,Thu Jul 2 21:04:44 2015 UTC,"Not completely but he could be on his way... I think he needs a radical change in how he goes about things and that can only happen with a coaching change or at least he should hire a new consultant of some sort, because these kind of losses have become way too routine now and his confidence will continue to remain low as a result."

tennis,3bwfy6,rafaknight,6,Fri Jul 3 00:14:23 2015 UTC,"He got to the semifinals of the Australian, then dealt with a bad back and racket switch, he looked fine at the WTFs. Everyone always knew Federer game was going to age better. I seriously doubt Rafa will be number 2 at age 33/34."

tennis,3bwfy6,Benmjt,9,Thu Jul 2 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"Lol. This Rata's Fed 2013. Nobody seems to remember the calls for Fed to retire and some were from his hardcore fans. Now everyone is happily lapping up Fed's ""new found"" awesomeness.  Rafa is 29/30 - he is not done yet."
tennis,3bwfy6,btaz,9,Thu Jul 2 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"I don't believe you can compare the two players. One player was relatively healthy and rarely injured, the other has had a ton of injuries already. The style they play is just so different. Federer was always easy on his body, Nadal put himself through the meat grinder to win. It's inevitable that Nadal was going to break down at some point. Federer always had his serve to lean on in the hard times, can you imagine Nadal trying to rely on his serve to get him through?"
tennis,3bwfy6,17to85,2,Thu Jul 2 20:40:55 2015 UTC,You guys are ignoring how much of mental game it is at the top. Nadal is fine physically - he has lost some pace but even this slower Nadal is top tier in terms of physicality. The bigger issue is his confidence. He himself has been talking about it. Because he has low confidence he is putting balls in the middle of the court rather than go for the lines - this makes it harder for him to get into a favorable position. Once he sorts this out - it will be easier to see how far of his best he is.
tennis,3bwfy6,btaz,3,Thu Jul 2 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"lack of confidence comes from a physical decline. Put Rafa in his 22 year old body and he would find his ""confidence"" damn fast."
tennis,3bwfy6,rbace,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:03:47 2015 UTC,Yup. That is why he needs to get over it and believe he can still do it.
tennis,3bwfy6,btaz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:51:21 2015 UTC,"He can talk about lack of confidence all he likes but the guy for years when the going was tough just took it to another level physically. If he's lost a step and can't raise his game like he used to then he's lost a lot and the lack of confidence is quite likely related to his body letting him down. No athlete ever admits that it's their body letting them down but it happens to them all at some point. Guys who played like Nadal don't generally have the long twilight, they tend to fall hard and fast."
tennis,3bwfy6,17to85,6,Thu Jul 2 22:11:00 2015 UTC,"Nadal missing simple forehands, serving double faults and making questionable decisions are nothing to do with his body, though. Those just clearly show that the issue is in the mind."
tennis,3bwfy6,scouting4food,3,Thu Jul 2 22:26:01 2015 UTC,I disagree. Guess we will have to wait and see.
tennis,3bwfy6,btaz,8,Thu Jul 2 22:21:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is comparable. Nadal's game has always been reliant on his physicality and that gets worse as you get older. Federer has generally relied on tactical nous and threw a bit of a wobbly in 2013 when he lost it and declined physically somewhat.   Nadal puts a lot more strain on his body than Federer does and so has a more damaged body. Unless Nadal starts playing with a more tactical gamestyle, he's not going to play as well as Fed is now."
tennis,3bwfy6,sociallyawkwarddude,2,Thu Jul 2 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"You are right. But you see, the problem with Nadal has been confidence. Yes he is no longer at his physical peak but physically right now he is fine - as in no injuries just lost some pace. But his confidence is probably at his lowest in his career. This will take him a long time to recover.  Nadal's game is physical but you see to win tournaments he need not totally dominate opponents as he did in the past. If you have a good run and a good draw you can win tournaments - even the major ones. We have seen it already.   EDIT: All I am saying is that if Nadal sorts out his confidence issues, even when he is not at his physical peak, he will win tournaments because he does not always have to be at his very peak to win.  So when people ask - ""Is he past his best ?"" do they mean ""Will Nadal ever dominate again as he did before ?"" or do they mean ""Will he ever win another GS ?"" - if it is the former, yes he is past his best. If it is the latter, yes, he has a good chance to win again."
tennis,3bwfy6,btaz,6,Thu Jul 2 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"You would probably think that this is extremely biased coming from a Nadal fan, but honestly, absolutely not. He's missed half a year from an injury, it's only natural for it to take time before he gets his confidence back. None of the top players have missed the amount of time that he has due to injury, but he's always come back from them to prove everyone wrong. He's in awful form for sure, but the issue is mental, and absolutely not physical. It would've been insane to expect Nadal to go far this year at Wimbledon after his recent form - if he had won today, he still would've lost sooner or later before the final.  He's still 29, so has a couple of years at the top level. The next 6 months to 1 year will be massive for him, though."
tennis,3bwfy6,scouting4food,4,Thu Jul 2 20:44:50 2015 UTC,This is not biased - this is the sensible way to look at the situation. Everyone seems to think Nadal is doomed because he has lost some of his pace. That is just one part of his game (major but not entire) and the most visible part.
tennis,3bwfy6,btaz,6,Thu Jul 2 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"This match is no compass on that. He would have beat almost anyone else, but was extremely unlucky to play Brown today."
tennis,3bwfy6,SwissBliss,2,Thu Jul 2 19:37:45 2015 UTC,"I thought that two years ago when he lost to Dracis--coming off the prior year's loss to Rosol. As in, I thought he just happened to play two guys at their absolute best (for whatever reason) on those days. But then he lost to Kyrgios and now Brown.  At this point I just don't see how it's a coincidence.    Just look at Djokovic and Federer--and to some extent Murray. They don't lose to guys outside of the top 100 in Majors (even on their weakest surfaces). They find ways to get through, even on days when the other guy is playing lights out. Even if you can find that lose somewhere in the record books (maybe Stakhovsky beating Fed at Wimbledon two years ago), it certainly isn't happening 4 years in a row."
tennis,3bwfy6,HiggsBozo,2,Thu Jul 2 22:46:12 2015 UTC,"Nadal isn't in any pain or injured, he's just losing. He's already acknowledged that he is not in his best shape. So it's really just a matter of him getting back on the grind. But you can't write him off in the same way you can write off Leyton Hewitt from winning a 500 or even 1000 event in the last few years. Nadal still got it, but does he still want it? I think he does but he'll continue to pick his moments."
tennis,3bwfy6,kydjester,4,Thu Jul 2 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"Tbh, outside of clay, he wasn't really there anyway.  He tries to play the same way on other surfaces where it isn't as effective as he does on clay. Look at where he won most of his slams...  Great player but not the master like Federer. If he shifted his style each surface like the other top ranked players do, he'd be winning a lot more."
tennis,3bwfy6,scotty1987,3,Thu Jul 2 20:42:30 2015 UTC,LOL.  Take a look at the US Open Final in 2013 and tell me he wasnt there.
tennis,3bwfy6,DudeAsInCool,2,Thu Jul 2 22:07:51 2015 UTC,"How many us open finals has he won? How many aus open finals has he won? How many Wimbledon finals has he won.  Compare that to how many he has won altogether AT ONE EVENT.  So please, tell me I'm wrong. Its his play on clay that kept him so high up. Now he's struggling, he's slipped down."
tennis,3bwfy6,scotty1987,2,Thu Jul 2 23:30:11 2015 UTC,He's been in 95 career finals and won 66 of them.  He has been in 20 grand slam finals and won 14 of them.  You do the math.  How anyone could denigrate a spectecular record like that is beyond reason.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal_career_statistics
tennis,3bwfy6,DudeAsInCool,3,Thu Jul 2 23:38:27 2015 UTC,"And a mass proportion of those are on clay.  Read it as it is, not what you want it to be. Outside of clay, he isn't the player he is on clay. Its a simple fact."
tennis,3bwfy6,scotty1987,-1,Fri Jul 3 04:57:20 2015 UTC,"Today, McEnroe said  that Nadal and Federer are the greatest tennis players that have ever played the game and that he thinks Nadal is the greatest based upon his record in the Slams, Masters, etc.  So stick that in your pipe and smoke it."

tennis,3bwfy6,rbace,2,Thu Jul 2 18:44:16 2015 UTC,When Rafa is not hitting well his ball sits up to get tee'd off on. It's why his upsets look like they are playing miraculous
tennis,3bwfy6,Legacy95,0,Thu Jul 2 21:01:54 2015 UTC,"The thing is if Rafa wasn't declining then he would have found that something extra in the tank to beat these players who have a dream match. It's what guys like Federer, Djokovic and Murray do regularly. Rafa used to do that too but he can't do it anymore."
tennis,3bwfy6,scouting4food,3,Fri Jul 3 00:05:44 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense, especially since he's lost in earlier rounds of Wimbledon in the last few years, but has still gone on to win slams around that period. The issue this year is confidence - if he gets that back, he will certainly be challenging for the top honours again."
tennis,3bwfy6,DudeAsInCool,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:36:46 2015 UTC,Not by a long shot. I find these kinds of thoughts ridiculous after having just watched him play one of the best sets in Wimbledon history.  He lost the first set by a small margin -- it wasnt because his tennis was lacking.

tennis,3bvca9,tennisruler11,6,Thu Jul 2 13:24:46 2015 UTC,"So, that's a lot of tennis in a day, especially for two weeks straight (it'd be a different animal if it was chilling at the courts for a third of that time or coaching). Make sure you are keeping hydrated and stretching and anything/everything else to stay healthy. I would also take a day or two of from tennis to make sure that such a large blister heals. (I'm presuming that since you're asking here that you're not on the pro tour and can take some time off tennis).  Now for what you want to hear: for this current blister you'll want to soak it in epsom salts. I'm not sure exactly how long, but you can do that a couple times a day. When playing make sure to wrap it.   To prevent future blisters think about your shoe and sock situation. Are you going through shoes very frequently? If you aren't, you should be with the amount you play. So replace your shoes more frequently. You can get cheaper shoes, as long as they fit your feet well and your foot doesn't move around (which causes blisters). If you wear through your outer shoe, you don't need to worry about the longevity of the cushioning.   For socks, are you folding your socks over? Are they too thin? Too thick? No socks?  Sometimes you just need to find the sock that works best for you. Or you already have and it's back to either playing so much or your shoes."
tennis,3bvca9,I_Am_Thing2,6,Thu Jul 2 14:11:02 2015 UTC,"If you need to play with the blister, use a pin to pop it, spray it with disinfectant then tape it and put some padding on it. Don't cut the skin off.  If you don't need to play, leave it unpopped until it heals.  In future it shouldn't be a problem as your feet will toughen up."
tennis,3bvca9,mathen,2,Thu Jul 2 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"I used to get a lot of blisters when I played, though never as much as you have. I changed the shoes I was wearing to ones that fit better and started wearing two pairs of socks. Now my feet get tender sometimes, but never really blister anymore.  When I was getting then a lot, I would just pop them and play. Your feet will toughen up, though if you're planning on maintaining the hours you're playing, blisters (and more) could be unavoidable.  In all honesty you should probably play less and devote some of that time to beneficial off-court exercise and body maintenance. Things that will ensure your level continues to rise while also helping make sure you can play for a long time to come."
tennis,3bvca9,r_smart,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:01:29 2015 UTC,You get better-fitting shoes or don't add so much extra time so radically.
tennis,3bvca9,KyleG,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:18:07 2015 UTC,I second two pair of socks. Change socks throughout the day. Check your insoles when I got blisters I dug a hole with ball of my foot.   While we're on subject of foot problems anyone know how best to prevent or treat corns? I get it on my pinky toes outside edge. Do I need to go up half a size or can I lace my shoes for wider fore foot?
tennis,3bvca9,vlee89,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"Most people are giving the same advice, and I'll just add a little:    The key is to reduce the moisture and friction between sock and foot.  Try a better fitting shoe Wear longer socks, this will capture sweat dripping down your legs into your socks/shoes Try two pairs of socks, one very thin sock underneath, that's form -fitting, the second, I like to wear a thicker sock, like a Thorlo, this fills out the shoe if it doesn't fit like a glove."
tennis,3bvca9,UNICY,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:06:54 2015 UTC,"Use two pairs of socks, use foot powder, wrap the balls of your feet with absorbent athletic wrap."
tennis,3bvca9,ryanmmm,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:40:49 2015 UTC,first quit playing until your foot recovers then try wearing two thin socks on each foot they will allow your foot to move around a bit more just try and get something breathable
tennis,3bvca9,DRUNKTENNIS,2,Thu Jul 2 13:59:09 2015 UTC,But it's the movement which creates the blisters. Two socks = more lateral and vertical movement = more rubbing = more blisters.
tennis,3bvca9,mrkingpenguin,5,Thu Jul 2 14:54:39 2015 UTC,"The idea is the friction between the sock layers is lower than between your foot and sock. So the socks slide by each other, but you foot is not sliding inside the first sock. It's fairly common to wear a liner and outter sock while backpacking for the same reason.   Now, the type of socks matter, and you don't want to use generic Walmart socks, at least for the inner one. Usually a thin, compression type one is best for the bottom layer."
tennis,3bvca9,srguapo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:01:12 2015 UTC,That sounds credible. I was told by someone who plays a lot of sport and does a lot of hiking that two socks don't help -- but its subjective I suppose.
tennis,3bvca9,mrkingpenguin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:21:30 2015 UTC,"It's somewhat of a holy war amongst hikers as well. The newer ""hiking socks"" you find in sports stores do not need liners, as they effectively have one built in, you can actually tell how easily the inside move compared to the outside when you put them on. Now, they are obviously made for boots and not tennis shoes, so I wouldn't use them for that, but the science behind it is similar I imagine."

tennis,3bxo23,mrkingpenguin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:51:31 2015 UTC,"this was a great read  And here you basically have the gist of Pete's wonderful book A Champion's Mind. If you enjoyed the article, I highly recommend the book - you won't be disappointed! (Disclaimer: I'm a lifelong Sampras fan; I have read that book 3 times and have Pete's signature on its cover :))  He totally should've experimented with new equipment. It set him back at the FO. I found it interesting that he wasn't on top of his nutrition back in the day and that it was just because he didn't eat the right things before the '96 Corretja match. Also, the one tip to serve down the line against Agassi was gold.  Actually, he was very strict on himself when it came to the diet. For example, he only allowed himself to eat a hamburger once a year (at the end of the season, if memory serves me right).  Jeez... I'm just imagining 16 year old Pete reading this then he starts to read the bit about cancer and stuff. Pretty grim stuff Pete  I just never was a Sampras fan. The hangdog look always staring at the ground. No personality...at all. His game of course was magic and his running FH incredible. And the serve on those fast surfaces helped him to win so many slams. But try as I might, just never was a fan."

tennis,3bxjgn,King-Kongs-Dad,10,Thu Jul 2 23:48:47 2015 UTC,"Brown beat Nadal in similar fashion in Germany last year, and he's been around for a while. His shots seem (at least to me) to be even more ridiculous than Monfils, and since they only really show up on grass, it makes them that much more special. I don't think that people are jumping on his ""bandwagon,"" but are rather excited that he was able to play so well. The saying goes, if you can't do it twice, you can't do it at all, and Dustin Brown is one of few people who Nadal is susceptible to."
tennis,3bxjgn,Comrod,2,Fri Jul 3 00:01:11 2015 UTC,"I was aware he beat Nadal, but other than this win I hadn't really heard his name before. So do you think this is going to give Brown the confidence to shoot up the rankings, much like Kyrgios has?"
tennis,3bxjgn,Pietjepotlood,2,Fri Jul 3 09:47:12 2015 UTC,"No. The big difference betweenness Brown and Rosol is that the latter was an absolute nobody when he beat Nadal. Brown isn't a nobody, he might not be a topplayer, but people are well aware of his abilities. I don't know if you've seen Brown play the weeks before Wimby, but if you did you would have noticed the commentators squeal with joy whenever he played. But because he doesn't play that often on the big courts in the big tournaments, he isn't that well noticed among the average tennis crowd.  Everyone being so crazy excited now is just a result of people hoping he'd get the opportunity to do what he did yesterday."
tennis,3bs40g,Nobody_likes_my_name,48,Wed Jul 1 18:25:03 2015 UTC,What a painful way to end it.
tennis,3bs40g,supremesuperextra,30,Wed Jul 1 19:11:28 2015 UTC,It's especially bad when you consider that HawkEye is only accurate to within 5 millimeters. Since a tennis ball is 69 mm in diameter I'm guess that was called out by about 1-2 mm...well within Hawkeye's margin of error.
tennis,3bs40g,drodin,21,Wed Jul 1 20:28:44 2015 UTC,"It likely has gotten better. ITF maximum error is 5mm. Tests from a few years age was 3.6mm. It is probably better now, though I have not seen recent stats."
tennis,3bs40g,derf82,10,Wed Jul 1 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"I guess the thing to keep in mind (as well as other comments in this thread about the subject) is that the hawkeye system is still on average going to be better than a linesperson making the call. It's an improvement, albeit not perfect. I still find it reasonably unbelievable that in the year 2015 we still don't have the technology to know whether a ball is touching a line or not but as a programmer who has a small amount of experience in dealing with simulations containing a lot of different parameters that it's not something easily perfected."
tennis,3bs40g,gurgus,12,Thu Jul 2 04:15:37 2015 UTC,what if it was 1-2mm's further out ? =) just playing devil's advocate.
tennis,3bs40g,dubsdaazn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:38:29 2015 UTC,In my opinion: if the ball is within the current margin of error (I would go as far to even account for starting time temperature as well which iirc affects hawk eyes accuracy) it shouldn't be used to reverse calls. Basically if it is within the margin of error the play stands.  But I think those in charge of tennis feel it is more important to be simple and consistent for the benefit of the viewer and I can't blame them for that.
tennis,3bs40g,patsmad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:38:39 2015 UTC,Or just replay the point
tennis,3bs40g,TicallionStallion,3,Thu Jul 2 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"I hate how this is never mentioned, it's mean error is self reported to be 3.6 mm. Commentators always go on about balls being a mm in or out so matter of factly. Any ball within 4 mm should be a replay the point. Otherwise why use the system? Why not flip a coin for any ball that close?"
tennis,3bs40g,HeikkiKovalainen,7,Thu Jul 2 02:01:05 2015 UTC,I think if it's within the margin they should just go with the original call. That's how it's done in other sports.
tennis,3bs40g,elrefai,3,Thu Jul 2 03:38:45 2015 UTC,Because hawkeye is far more accurate than a human.  There's better chance hawkeye got it right than the human.  Thus it makes sense to go with hawkeye.  The margin of error for hawkeye is much much smaller than a human's.
tennis,3bs40g,ralphplzgo,0,Thu Jul 2 15:24:13 2015 UTC,What I mean to say is if a call is challenged and the hawkeye is not conclusive evidence because of the margin of error it doesn't make sense to overturn the call. At that point it's just random whether the ball is called in or out by the hawkeye so just go with the original call.
tennis,3bs40g,elrefai,2,Thu Jul 2 15:42:49 2015 UTC,"but it's not random though, even though it's within the margin of error, the ball is more likely to be in than out.    For it to be random it the shadow produced by hawkeye would need to be tangent to the line.  And by random I mean no better than a coin flip."
tennis,3bs40g,ralphplzgo,2,Thu Jul 2 16:21:35 2015 UTC,Yeah agreed actually.

tennis,3bs40g,KyleG,0,Wed Jul 1 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"yes but I'm saying you listed the ball has a 69mm diameter, which is completely irrelevant to what is actually touching the court. Hence the ""center"" of the ball, ambiguous, but still more accurate than diameter"

tennis,3bx8dv,KyleG,3,Fri Jul 3 03:34:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's what they mean. Tennis analysts don't seem to have any memory whatsoever. They'll change their ""GOAT"" in a heartbeat. In 2004 during the US Open, McEnroe was talking about Federer possibly being the greatest player ever. He had won 3 slams at that point. Then Nadal comes along and suddenly he's the potential GOAT according to McEnroe. Then Djokovic starts dominating and it shifts to him."
tennis,3bx8dv,KyleG,6,Fri Jul 3 05:13:41 2015 UTC,"Well that's just McEnroe. There are good commentators. He's not one of them. All that experience, and he almost never gives you any substantial insight. Best commentators are people like Andre Agassi, etc. Especially Andre"

tennis,3bx8dv,trowawayatwork,2,Fri Jul 3 10:10:06 2015 UTC,"why are you turning feds backhand debate to a goat debate? You also dont go any further back than 2010 on what you know about feds backhand and just relate to rewatching matches from back in the day.  I completely agree with you that feds always had a top 5 backhand, as the 08 wimby final match point save in 4th set with an insane backhand down the line somewhere in this vid.  However, because of nadal just playing to feds backhand he actually went through a phase of rebuilding his backhand to try and go over it a bit more since the higher bounce on the slower courts meant he couldnt slice it back since nadal would punish all the short balls and going over the ball meant he was more prone to errors.  I have definitely seen an improvement in the consistency of his backhand since edberg joined the team. the shot selection and the winners are still the same, its the consistency in going over his backhand that has definitely improved"
tennis,3bx8dv,plenty_of_time,2,Fri Jul 3 10:26:14 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about 2011 and 2012 to illustrate that it wasn't the racket change that was responsible for his backhand improving from 2013, it was his health. Hell, watch him in the 2013 AO and his backhand was quite good there as well. It was after he began having serious back problems that his backhand, and the rest of his game, faltered.  As far as the ""GOAT"" thing, I'm pointing out how tennis analysts have very short memories. They don't even remember how dominant and awesome Federer was in his prime. They think of him the way they've seen him the last year or two.   And Federer never solved the Nadal issue. The last time he beat him in a Grand Slam was 2007. So if he was trying to change his backhand to adjust to Nadal, it didn't help."
tennis,3bx8dv,fart-sausage,3,Fri Jul 3 18:13:47 2015 UTC,"His backhand improved without a shred of doubt up until 2007 at least. It is technique-wise a different shot than it was early on in his career. That being said, it is very silly to talk about his backhand improving now, I would say."
tennis,3bx8dv,Jobin1616,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:37:56 2015 UTC,"I think his backhand has improved since 2013, but that's not saying much because he was shanking forehands on the reg that year. I shudder to remember those dark times."
tennis,3bx8dv,Jobin1616,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:31:30 2015 UTC,"His backhand was at its best during his prime from 2004-2009. The only person that was able to really exploit it as a weakness was Nadal.  But later in his career he lost confidence in it and it really deteriorated. By 2013 it was a huge liability. I think that's what prompted him to switch racquets. Since 2013, it has improved a lot. He's way more solid there now. But I don't think it's as good as it was during his prime."
tennis,3bx8dv,TimRattayGotScrewed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:19:24 2015 UTC,Everything was a liability in 2013 because he was playing with back problems. Getting healthy made his entire game better. The racket doesn't seem to have made much difference.
tennis,3bx8dv,plenty_of_time,2,Thu Jul 2 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"Seems like a pretty biased view to me. I'm a huge Federer fan but I can see that the racquet has helped his backhand. It's also been detrimental to his forehand, but it's caused a net improvement in his game from 2013 in my opinion. He was healthy towards the end of 2013 and he didn't enjoy results like he did in 2014 once he switched racquets."
tennis,3bx8dv,TimRattayGotScrewed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"He was coming off serious problems and had lost confidence at that point in 2013. It affected his training blocks.

Mahut, Kudla, Hewitt and Ebden got one for example this year.  Then, you have 8 guys who go through qualifications the week before the tournament. Entry to the qualifications are also dependent on your world ranking."

tennis,3bxsa1,dragonsky,7,Fri Jul 3 01:07:58 2015 UTC,Does everyone forget what happened with Federer in 2013? He had a terrible year by his standards and everyone said he should retire. Now he's back to world number 2 and competing for slams. Nadal's 2015 has been about as bad as Federer's 2013. As a Federer fan I believe in Nadal's ability to bounce back from this. It's only even been a year since he won a slam. Give him the rest of the year to sort things out.
tennis,3bxsa1,Jobin1616,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:40:21 2015 UTC,I think the main problem with Nadal is that for his game to be at its best his body also has to be at its best. His body is only getting worse with age and more playtime .
tennis,3bxsa1,TheOneSurvivalist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:37:14 2015 UTC,"You're getting downvoted because every year someone makes this thread after a less than perfect effort from Rafa but... this time I agree. First loss at FO since '09, poor effort at AO, and another poor effort at Wimbledon, ranking continues to fall, I mean he'll probably fall out of the top ten now and I can't remember the last time that happened.   Unfortunately, not every great player has declines as graceful as Federer, often they are quite dramatic and take pretty sudden nosedives. I honestly think this is the end for Nadal, he'll still have a presence for a while, but I don't see him winning another slam, maybe I'm just being overly dramatic, maybe he'll prove me wrong, but he's always struggled to win the other grand slams, the FO has always been the one to win for him and if he cant even do that anymore then I'm just not sure what presence he can continue to have."
tennis,3bxsa1,bitchdantkillmyvibe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:46:05 2015 UTC,I've been fan of Nadal for many years and I honestly can't see Nadal coming back to his best.

But I honestly doubt Rafa will win another GS.

tennis,3bxsa1,PokeMyPillow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:02:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if he retires after the French next year(if he doesn't win it).  No he is not the same as Karlovic, in fact, he is still leaps and bounds above most of the tour. Just taking a look at the race rankings which is more reflective of performance so far this year than the actual rankings, he is 8th right now with a 1,200 point lead over #9 Raonic and is only 105 points behind #7 Ferrer and 120 points behind #6 Nishikori. He is still a top player but in a way he is also like Federer now where he sometimes has off days that simply eliminate him from a tournament like it did today.  If he plays against any of the top 4 then I expect him to lose but I still think he can beat Berdych, Nishikori, Ferrer, and Raonic more times than not on hard court, but I wouldn't be too surprised if any of the aforementioned beats him or if he beats any of the top 4(except Djokovic...then I would be very suprised)."

tennis,3brudn,dilplunk,-8,Thu Jul 2 01:00:08 2015 UTC,"Power and accuracy. And speed/agility. That's tennis. Federer has no power and isn't really that accurate, either, considering how many errors he makes. He's accurate with his serve, but it's one of the slowest serves on the men's tour.   Hitting a shot between the legs doesn't mean jack as far as tennis talent. Nor does hitting some weird ""wrist flick"" shot. You don't win tennis matches doing that crap."
tennis,3brudn,BadBackhanderererer,4,Thu Jul 2 02:04:15 2015 UTC,Troll account much?
tennis,3brudn,Tvizz,2,Thu Jul 2 05:22:25 2015 UTC,"And how many majors have those ""talented"" players won?  Even combined not what Fed has."
tennis,3brudn,Jaguartactics,-12,Thu Jul 2 02:28:08 2015 UTC,That's not the point. The point is people rave about Federer's talent when he's not exceptionally talented for a pro tennis player. He can't hit the ball hard.
tennis,3brudn,BadBackhanderererer,4,Thu Jul 2 01:48:31 2015 UTC,Your definition of talent is much different than mine.  I would say being the number one player in the world for years takes more talent than a fast ground stroke.
tennis,3brudn,Jaguartactics,4,Thu Jul 2 02:03:10 2015 UTC,Talent doesn't equal ability to hit the ball hard...
tennis,3brudn,Pimp-My-Alpaca,-14,Thu Jul 2 02:53:40 2015 UTC,"Tennis is about hitting the ball hard between the lines. That's the sport. Hit it over the net, hard, and keep it in."

tennis,3brudn,xcyu,-5,Thu Jul 2 04:41:24 2015 UTC,"No, I get it right. That's why Djokovic is better than Federer ever was. That's why guys like Rios and other supposedly ""sooooo talented"" players didn't win squat. Because tennis fans have a screwy definition of ""talent."""
tennis,3brudn,BadBackhanderererer,3,Thu Jul 2 09:58:19 2015 UTC,"Djokovic won most of his slam titles playing percentage. Its only now with becker that he has sped up his serve and is looser with his hitting.  So next time, troll harder or not at all."

I can guarantee you he will straight sets destroy raonic like feds did last year.  literally the only wildcard is stan in the top half because i have no idea which one will turn up"

Other players have looked better. That's all I'm saying. No doubt he will pick it up as the tournament progresses but he's not as unbeatable as you think. Two of his losses this season came on fast surfaces, against bigger servers (Federer and Karlovic)."
tennis,3bqsx2,tonderstiche,2,Wed Jul 1 13:13:44 2015 UTC,"Other players have looked better.   Just curious, who? Novak just played two very difficult opponents.

I do think Dimitrov has looked very sharp but I'm not sure if he will make the final."
tennis,3bqsx2,Jobin1616,3,Wed Jul 1 16:19:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you're judging their respective opponents. Kukushkin is dangerous and Dzhumur was decent.

Djokovic made a lot of errors against Kohlschreiber but he cleaned up his game towards the end of todays match."
tennis,3bqsx2,tonderstiche,2,Wed Jul 1 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you're judging their respective opponents.    Kohlschreiber is obviously a tough R1 opponent so there's nothing to be said there. Nieminen is an aging veteran who has made a few slam QFs (admittedly long ago) and was once ranked 13.   Kukushkin is decent but barely a top 50 player and Dzhumur has never been ranked under 80.  So yeah, Federer looks good but hasn't faced a challenge and Murray looked decent but his second serve remains a huge liability.  I don't see other players looking better than Novak but I agree that he looked rusty in his first match."

tennis,3bqsx2,DilbertsBeforeSwine,0,Wed Jul 1 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"And Raonic on grass should be able to beat anyone.  He has given Djokovic some trouble on clay, he's better on grass than on clay, and Djokovic is worse on grass than on clay, so grass should be even closer.  Also, Djokovic has shown vulnerability to big servers (2 losses to Isner, 2 to Ivo including 1 this year, I think 3 to Roddick when Roddick was pretty good), so I think it's a fair assumption than a Raonic-Djokovic match on grass is almost a toss-up.    If it happens, I pick Djokovic in 4 sets (maybe 6-7 6-3 7-6 7-6)."

I wonder if he's like, couldn't he have made up his mind before our match? His calf injury was known. Knowing how much players (don't) get paid outside the top 100 or so, Bolelli probably could've used the extra $30K (or whatever) for making round 2.  I wonder how much players would support (or riot) if, in cases like this, the loser became the ""lucky loser"" and got to move on to the next round to play in Nishikori's place."

tennis,3bs4op,chicagotim1,76,Wed Jul 1 18:29:38 2015 UTC,"The primary difference between the court types can be attributed to A) the speed with which the ball comes off the court and B) the height of the bounce.  Both these factors can greatly affect, enhance, or hinder the strengths and weaknesses of certain players. To take the example of the two best players on both surfaces, let's go with Nadal and Federer.  Nadal, on clay, succeeds due to his defensive prowess and extreme topspin forehand. When a player catches him out of sorts in a rally, the ball sticking to the surface of the clay and bouncing high up gives Nadal time to get to it, making his opponent play that one extra shot. His forehand, already spinning up and away, is helped by the court's bounce, making it harder to hit back in an aggressive way, especially if you're a one-hander.  Federer is successful on grass due to his attacking style and steady slice backhand. When he gets the upper hand in a rally, he's able to strike the ball into places where once it hits the grass, it stays low and slides away deeper in the direction it was hit, making it super hard to get to. In other rallies, his slice stays low and buys him time, requiring tennis players (who are usually tall) to dig low and return the ball. This means Federer usually gets a neutral shot to feast on. The slice is a shot that is very effective and has helped him have such a good winning record against the taller men in the game.  This is not to say that these two shots are the only reason these players succeed. Federer moves very well on clay and has a killer forehand, and Nadal can attack well on grass too. It's just the simplest case to illustrate the difference between the two surfaces."
tennis,3bs4op,avic14,3,Wed Jul 1 19:25:45 2015 UTC,here's a video that does a pretty decent job at explaining. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX2h67S1ODg

tennis,3bs4op,kydjester,5,Wed Jul 1 21:34:26 2015 UTC,"Okay so the difference between clay and gra- kydjester, why are your eyes red? Look at me when I'm talking to you!"
tennis,3bs4op,Oooch,15,Thu Jul 2 05:15:50 2015 UTC,"clay: slower tennis, ball bounces higher, hinders big serve players, favours baseline players.  hard: faster than clay, slower than grass, middle ground between clay-grass.  grass: fastest surface, ball bounces lower, favours big serve players and volleys."
tennis,3bs4op,aldord,2,Wed Jul 1 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"Also a factor in the surfaces is the footing, you slide a lot more on clay and some on grass but not so much on hardcourt.  Grass also tends to have funny bounces and clay as well but slightly less unpredictable whereas hardcourts have a more predictable bounce"
tennis,3bs4op,yash97sriv,10,Thu Jul 2 04:17:28 2015 UTC,"People have covered the speed/bounce which are two of the biggest things but movement is a huge difference as well. You are going to be sliding a lot more on clay - you actually want to slide IN to your shots, while on hard/grass you can slide, sure, but it isn't a regular part of the average players movement.  Even accounting for the modern style of movement (more sliding ala Djokovic) it's difficult to do that on grass without slipping. Now, the wearing down of the grass should change that a bit but still you are going to want to take smaller steps and be more precise with your footwork. You will see more sliding on a hard court than a grass court due to the danger of slipping.   Incidentally this is why I find Murray to be the best mover on grass, because he rarely relies on sliding to balls and is really fast with great footwork."
tennis,3bs4op,politelycorrect,2,Wed Jul 1 21:05:34 2015 UTC,Are some players able to slide a lot more when it's rainy because the grass is wet? I have no idea how people slide on hard courts but I would've thought some pros are able to channel how slippery things get into some great moves.
tennis,3bs4op,gbinasia,6,Wed Jul 1 21:35:20 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough you will want to slide LESS when it's wet because there is a high chance you will lose control entirely. The reason why people tend to slide on grass less is not because it's less slippery - it's because it's MORE slippery. A slide on grass often results in a slip/fall which is obviously an undesired result. Rain only exacerbates this effect because it makes it even more slippery. Players would then be even more careful not to slip and fall.   Honestly the sliding on hard courts phenomenon that we are seeing more and more of and is amazing to me. I have tried to do it but it requires a lot of strength, balance and flexibility that I don't have. Djokovic is the king at this as you see him slide into a lot of his shots that require running. Roger does it the more intuitive way for me, as he slides mostly when defending off his FH side with a squash shot."

tennis,3bs4op,gbinasia,2,Wed Jul 1 21:58:20 2015 UTC,"Just a little add on to what's been said already, but the grass has been slowed down in the last few years. This, combined with string/racquet technology, has allowed for clay court specialists to see more success on the grass. It's also killed serve and volley tennis."
tennis,3bs4op,WorldlyBiscuits,5,Thu Jul 2 14:55:32 2015 UTC,Clay slower.  Grass faster.
tennis,3bs4op,Orangutan,6,Wed Jul 1 20:35:47 2015 UTC,Clay bounce higher. Grass bounce lower.
tennis,3bs4op,kydjester,2,Wed Jul 1 21:33:43 2015 UTC,"Clay courts: slow surface, higher bounce, players slide into shots, rallies last longer (due to the ball moving slower so players have more time to reach the ball) so stamina is a big factor. Generally, players with heavy (topspin), consistent groundstrokes do better on clay than big servers (the big flat serve is easier to return) or players who come to the net more (approach shots are not very effective on the slower surface, allowing opponents to pass the player at the net easier... also it's more difficult to quickly change direction, which is necessary at the net, on the loose surface).     Grass courts: fast surface, low bounces (although Wimbledon almost plays like a hardcourt), short rallies due to the speed of the court (easier to put the ball away: ie: to finish the point with a winner or unreturnable shot). Generally players with big serves and decent volleys have the advantage, as they can take control of the point with their big serves and finish points off quickly with volleys, although due to the courts being so good at Wimbledon and almost playing like hardcourts, there have been winners in the past who have been considered more as baseline specialists and not players who approach the net much (Nadal, Hewitt). The way the game has evolved, most players in the top 100 have excellent returns and passing shots so it's very difficult now for serve volley specialists to dominate completely at Wimbledon."
tennis,3bs4op,godlesshero,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:36:35 2015 UTC,"tennis players generally agree that clay is their least favorite surface on which to play. a reason for this may be that clay neutralizes power. on a hard court when you hit a ball as hard as you can, not much of the speed and power is lost after it hits the court. you can alter the path of the ball with spin but it will carry the speed. playing on a clay court requires you to be a bit more creative and precise with your shot making. since a player cannot just overpower their opponent as they might on a different surface, they need to create sharp angle shots to move their opponent off the court with the intent of hitting to the open court. clay courts produce long battle rallies, as it is not easy to pass someone with the slower bounce. this requires patience and a strong mental game. players will pull the trigger on a shot that they would expect to be a winner (and probably would be on most courts) but ball after ball comes back on a clay court and that can wear down players mentally and physically. grass/ hard courts are faster and magnify the effectiveness of taking response time away from your opponent. serve and volley players have traditionally had more success on these courts. when you volley the ball only travels half the distance of the court (as opposed to a baseline shot that travels from the net to the back of the court, bounces, hit, then the full length of the court) we are talking milliseconds but it gives your opponent time to recover from their own shot, get back to a neutral position to hit the next ball. tennis is a beautifully complex sport. i could have conversations like this for hours."

tennis,3bs4op,loeblich,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:47:11 2015 UTC,"i've been watching professional tennis for nearly 30 years. it's my personal opinion based on interviews i've seen. that's why i said ""generally"". my opinion is also based on, aside from Nadal, Chris Evert and Bjorn Borg, most players do not have consistent results at rolland garros. over the years, i believe it has become an exercise in developing a strong mental game to embrace what is challenging and call it our friend in order to have better results."

tennis,3btts1,nunchaku-,2,Thu Jul 2 02:31:09 2015 UTC,"It really took you 7-8 months to blow through vapor courts? I wear out the outsole of vapor 9.5s in 2-2.5 months and sometimes I have to toss them even earlier since I rip a hole in the shoe from sliding. Did you wear through the outsole so that you could see the midsole? If not then you must not play much. Either way, vapor courts are some of the least durable shoes around since they are second tier shoes(just never get second tier shoes, like the nike courts and asics games). If you really took this long to wear through the shoe without seeing the midsole then go for the zoom cages. The comfort is okay and this shoe is fairly durable with above average support. You can get it on sale for just $90 and it comes with the 6 month outsole guarantee so do something to wear through it in 6 months....  You can also try the barricade 2015. I know you said your price is $80 and you don't like Adidas, but this Adidas shoe is different. It gives the amazing support of a barricade while being somewhat lightweight and comfortable/non-stiff. Its on sale for $100 but it is more than worth it compared to 2nd tier shoes and it also has the 6th month gaurantee(if you can wear out the outsole....)"

tennis,3bspxl,cowd20,7,Wed Jul 1 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"You would probably be okay, although because it's a weekend day AND there's a heatwave the queue is likely to be far busier than usual. It's not a Murray/Federer day though (as of now; rain delays might affect that), so it's likely to be slightly less demand to get in.  We queued up today, arrived around 6:45 and were 5000th in the queue. Wimbledon sent out a tweet that the queue was at full capacity (~9000 people) around half an hour later. However, the previous day (which had Murray, Fed and Nadal), the queue was already full by 6:45, and anyone who arrived after that was having to wait until earlier attendees left the site before they could be let in (often mid/late afternoon). Demand has definitely increased in recent years due to the Murray effect - we queued up on Day 3 in 2012 and Day 2 in 2014 (both non-Murray days) and, arriving at 6:45, we were in 3000th and 3600th place respectively. I'm sure the heatwave is what caused the surge this year to 5000th.  I have no idea how much demand steps up once you get to third round matches and the weekend, but hopefully this should give you an idea of what to expect. The best thing to do is check the Wimbledon Twitter feed (@Wimbledon) as you make your way in - if you get in before the account tweets ""the Queue is at capacity"" then you're guaranteed to get in by 1pm."

Being there at 6.45, at what time did you actually get in? Where you able to see any interesting match? Sorry I've never been at a grand slam so I'm really clueless. Thanks in advance!"
tennis,3bspxl,Mascia,2,Thu Jul 2 11:52:10 2015 UTC,"Arrived at 6:45, got in at 11:30 - faster than we expected! I guess there wasn't much delay getting the crowd through security. Just remember to bring enough cash so that you can buy your ticket on the way in! This is very important. On Wednesday it was £25 (in cash only) but it may be more for Friday.  Your best bet for seeing some big players for free is Courts 3, 12 or 18 - they all have unreserved seating which you will need to queue for. We queued for 45 minutes to get into Court 18 for the Nick Kyrgios match. Courts 13-17 will have other singles matches on nearby and you'll see some of the lower seeds on there (Gasquet played there yesterday).  Also keep an eye on who's on Courts 4-11, these are courts that you can walk between and stand and watch a match from only a few feet away. They're usually used for doubles matches but you can still see some famous singles players - yesterday I saw Dustin Brown, Laura Robson, Madison Keys, Victor Troicki, plus British players Jonny Marray and Johanna Konta. Sloane Stephens did her singles match there yesterday too.  After 3pm, you can try and buy ""resale tickets"" to Centre Court, Court 1 or Court 2 from a booth above Aorangi Terrace (aka Henman Hill). These are tickets that have been handed back in by people who have left early, and they're really cheap - Centre tickets cost £10 each, and it all goes to charity. You'd be lucky to get anything more than 2 seats together though, so if you have a larger party you will end up scattered around the stadium. Yesterday we queued for tickets around 5pm, queued for 30 mins and got into Centre Court in time to catch the final set of the Cilic match and all of Serena's match. Some of my other friends decided to go for Court 1 and saw Stan play. It's completely worth it, especially if you've never been to Wimbledon before, even just to see inside the stadium! Just remember that the availability of the tickets is completely dependent on people leaving early, so if there's a popular player on later in the day (e.g. Murray) people will be less likely to leave and abandon their seat.  Definitely check out the practice courts too - if you go between 11am and 1pm you can usually see some of the top players! Yesterday we saw Murray, Nadal, Berdych, Wozniacki and Ward all within the same half hour.  Hope that helps! It's an unforgettable experience, I hope you enjoy it :)"

tennis,3bqigu,MCallanan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:52:56 2015 UTC,Even though Halep has been around longer than Bouchard she really just reached her peak last season. Feels like they're both going through a 'Sophomore' slump and having troubles with the expectations after stellar seasons in 2014. And this happens on the men's side all the time... Donald Young is a good example. I would argue that Dimitrov to this point in the season has had a similar setback to that of Halep as he lost in the first round of Roland Garros and has yet to win a title. And let's not forget about Gulbis who can't seem to win tennis matches any longer.
tennis,3bqigu,MajorMajorHenryFonda,2,Wed Jul 1 11:43:31 2015 UTC,"Halep has won three titles this year though, same number as Serena (yes I know Serena has only played 6 tournaments).   It was a shock yes; and she's lost a few matches she shouldn't have recently, but she's not in the same amount of trouble as Bouchard is (who has had what two decent tournaments in the past 12 months?)."
tennis,3bqigu,MCallanan,3,Wed Jul 1 12:11:33 2015 UTC,Agreed. I was just trying to draw a parallel between the gentlemen and ladies games. Your same example could be said about Gulbis and Dimitrov -- Dimitrov is obviously playing better tennis this season.

tennis,3bqigu,blekginger,7,Wed Jul 1 12:11:28 2015 UTC,"I'd pay for it honestly. You can get good VPNs for about €5/month, and paying €5 to watch Wimbledon in good quality is worth it if you ask me."
tennis,3bqigu,Thelonius-Drunk,2,Wed Jul 1 12:16:33 2015 UTC,I'm heavily considering it. How do I go about paying for a VPN like that?
tennis,3bqigu,rhomqw,4,Wed Jul 1 12:31:32 2015 UTC,Private Internet Access is fairly popular.  $40 a year or $7 a month.

Literally 5 minutes after the interview, a Beats commercial comes on the same channel; in this commercial he is being asked about his ""recent outbursts"" at reporters. See the connection?

tennis,3bq960,RockwellShah,4,Wed Jul 1 08:00:51 2015 UTC,"Obviously queuing is the way to get a ground pass for the day, I'm not sure how long the queue is in the morning but I intend to queue next week from 5 or 6am. A better way of doing it, if you just want to experience some of the tennis, is to turn up at 'after-work' hours and queue then (5pm onwards) the ground passes are cheaper and the queue is usually only half an hour to 45 mins, I'm told. You'll still get 3 hours worth of tennis which is ample for an evening."
tennis,3bq960,RockwellShah,3,Wed Jul 1 08:20:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I took a tour of the grounds last year, but I can't wait to see the actual tournament being played."

tennis,3bq960,i_cri_evertim,3,Wed Jul 1 14:38:52 2015 UTC,Hey i'm a night housekeeper! Just got in from doing my shift.   Is it as hard as LSS hype it up to be in the interviews?  Which court were you on and what's been your favourite match to watch? I hear there's a bit of expectation for everyone to go out after their shift a lot of nights. Is that true?
tennis,3bq960,Oooch,4,Wed Jul 1 09:05:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, you soldier. Must be an eery and interesting job. You get paid quite well though right?   The interviews are quite difficult and it's mostly down to luck. The vetting process is clearly quite strict and as you can imagine there aren't that many places due to returning CAs every year. Unfortunately it is quite a bit down to who you know as well. I was captain of Court 3 which was awesome, you really grow to care about your Court! We had some really great matches over the years, I couldn't possibly pick one - although I would say that when Bahrami and Leconte get drawn on your court then you know you're in for a treat (they're in the senior invitationals and really know how to entertain). This isn't strictly true. The two Thursdays are the social evenings when a large proportion of Wimbledon staff - housekeeping, catering, court attendants etc - go out in Wimbledon. This is always fun but seriously killer due to the 7am start the next day!"

They seem to make it out that it's extremely hard and physical but I can tell you that 10 hours constantly moving around cleaning is extremely tiring!"
tennis,3bq960,soleilvie,3,Wed Jul 1 18:15:57 2015 UTC,Who has been the friendliest player you have managed to speak to?  Who wasn't so friendly?
tennis,3bq960,pounro,6,Wed Jul 1 10:30:53 2015 UTC,"The Olympics was best for chatting to players as Court 3 was a behind-closed-doors practice court. Most of the players we spoke to were really friendly and keen for a chat. I had a great conversation with Ana Ivanovic, she's really nice - we tried to persuade her to come out with us in Wimbledon! I also remember having a bit of banter with Bernard Tomic when he was practicing, he came across as just a normal bloke who liked having a laugh.   Maria Sharapova is known by the Court Attendants and Groundsmen for being pretty nasty, she doesn't really have time for anyone and always finds a way to annoy people."

tennis,3bq960,Smallishes,2,Wed Jul 1 11:18:17 2015 UTC,"As I said, most players were really friendly and keen for a chat. I'm surprised that you couldn't have worked out that Sharapova is an unpleasant person.  During the Champs, you don't get much exposure to the players as they are there to play and are pretty focussed. The only time I really got close to players was when delivering ice to the changing rooms for the ice baths. The Oympics was a one-off and the atmosphere was much more relaxed and friendly and we got to chat to quite a few."
tennis,3bq960,AlexanderUGA,4,Wed Jul 1 12:12:21 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I briefly met Sharapova once, years ago, and she was very nice in that encounter. It was late at night, about midnight, and she had just won a tournament. We happened to be staying at the same hotel. Several people in the hotel lobby recognized her, and she patiently stood for photographs and signed autographs for whoever asked."

tennis,3bnojy,Sehs,23,Tue Jun 30 19:22:26 2015 UTC,"It's part of it, but not the whole thing.   You can find some of it here, in French  http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/05/26/rejean-tremblay-eugenie-bouchard-petite-baveuse-reputation_n_7442722.html  In short, she received the Athlete of the Year award and has rarely if ever acknowledged it. She plays hard to get with Canadian journalists, treating them as any other media. There's also the whole connotation that her parents are turning their backs on their own culture; someone with a last name like Bouchard who lives in Montreal yet speaks French slightly better than Harper speaks French is always weird. Her official website also had no French version; she insists on being called 'Genie', aka 'Genius' for your regular francophone. Her mother apparently even calls the French media when they spell her name Eugénie rather than Eugenie . To add to the assimilation picture, all the Bouchard children are specifically named in honor of the British monarchy.  It's not her fault, but at some point her (already rich) father came into a contractual agreement with another tennis player parent and incorporated a tennis business solely based on her future earnings while she was a minor to avoid taxes. The courts eventually voided that.  To each their own but it's not very surprising that she's starting to get backlash from fans who, only on name recognition, were happy to have finally found a home-grown tennis star. Since neither her or her family play 'nice' off-court, most fans are turned off."

I don't see why this is a big deal or even remotely important.   she insists on being called 'Genie', aka 'Genius' for your regular francophone.    I'm pretty sure this stems from the English pronunciation of her name. I don't think she's going around telling people to call her ""genius""  Some people aren't happy with her and that's fine but I'm not sure I'd say she's not very well liked. At least, it seems to me that it's for the same reasons as everyone else with the handshake and what appears to be a bit of a snobby attitude.  That said, I don't really know her as a person and I just hope her tennis can improve and she can bring some success to tennis in Canada. She's still very young and has a lot to learn and maybe sometime she does things that are a bit silly but I think people's reactions are way overblown.  Last year people were way too obsessed with her success and now people are way too obsessed with her troubles."

You might not think it's a big deal that she doesn't speak French like a native, but for some it does. It's a sign of English assimilation in your own province.

At the risk of repeating myself, there's more than just French speaking people in Quebec, particularly in Montreal. It seems to me like there's a community of people taking offense just because they can.  She's already on billboards and big ads in the Eaton Center in Montreal so she's doing her thing with PR.  I agree that she could do more if she really wanted to but I just don't see what the big deal is about. It seems to me like it's the media just fishing for stories.

Does Quebec own everyone born there?  No.  Just no.  It's sad that you think that way, and kind of bigoted.  The hand shake is less pedantic and more asshole-ish.  But I'll give this one to you since fair enough.  And who care's about assimilation?  I'm assuming your from Quebec.  And if I were her, I'd do the same thing.  Hmmm.. satisfy some Quebecers (small income) or satisfy where the big money is.  Especially if this is how you're going to act towards her for relatively minor stuff, then you'll never be happy."
tennis,3bnojy,Rattler3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"Seriously this guy's while argument on why people don't like her is because her parents are ""pedantic"".   That's retardedly pedantic."
tennis,3bnojy,AJT217,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:25:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that's the whole reason why. It's part of it. Nobody's forced to like her, especially when the whole clan emulates values most people don't cherish. That's all. I'm not saying whether what she does is the best for her (it might well be), I'm just saying it's no surprise she's not well liked when she, and her clan, are playing the part of the uppity snob in and out of court since pretty much ever."
tennis,3bnojy,gbinasia,2,Wed Jul 1 03:55:15 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda loving how I'm being told what we're supposed to think about her. Yes I do live in Quebec; I'm providing you with perspective. You can think it's petty if you want. People have different values in some parts of the world, ya know.  Funny though how all the comment supporting what I'm saying are from posters in Montreal/Quebec and the ones dissenting are from outside the province."

My friend also said that in the players lounge, a fan told her 'Bonne chance Genie ! ' and she turned to her mother saying 'I don't speak that loser language'. She also never spoke to anyone except her mother and didn't seem sorry for losing on the first day."

She also never spoke to anyone except her mother and didn't seem sorry for losing on the first day.   Did you watch the match?

tennis,3bvfe0,ChelsOK,9,Thu Jul 2 13:53:46 2015 UTC,I think Murray is sarcastic and hilarious and is one of my favorite players besides Djokovic. Your points stand about his frustration and his attitude on the court but I rather enjoy that kind of attitude and emotion. He definitely strikes me as down to earth in the limited amounts I have heard him interviewed.
tennis,3bvfe0,theprodigy77,-8,Thu Jul 2 14:22:14 2015 UTC,I am a full fledged Federer fan and I think because of his attitude and such I just base my ideals on him. I suppose what you find funny I find annoying :)
tennis,3bvfe0,theprodigy77,4,Thu Jul 2 14:36:37 2015 UTC,And I totally get that. I personally don't base my ideals on tennis players; I think at the end of the day they are just athletes doing what the love to do.
tennis,3bvfe0,gman311,4,Thu Jul 2 15:00:27 2015 UTC,"He became my favorite because I felt like he was an underdog when I first started watching. Still too. I started reading about his childhood horrors like when he was younger, a shooter killed people in his school. I appreciate his dry sense of humor and find it hilarious. He isn't afraid to make fun of himself either, which is something I truly hold in high regards; see here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR-LLVZYBMU I also am similar to him on court in that I wear my emotions on my sleeve, if I play poorly, I'm cussing. I'm really wondering how you could HATE him so much. Dig a little deeper, and you might discover he's not the shit human you think he is."
tennis,3bvfe0,iceman_xiii,2,Thu Jul 2 18:47:38 2015 UTC,"Andy Murray isn't my favourite. But, I will just speak about why people like him. Let's talk about his gameplay. Andy Murray plays a strong passive-aggressive game. He like to attack when on serve but his shot selection is usually passive-aggressive. He like to rally a bit and bog down his opponent. He is pretty sturdy in hitting tight cross court shots when chasing tight angle shots aimed at him. This along with his decent return of serve and general running about court makes him fun to watch. Well, to some, maybe not to everyone.   Other than his gameplay, Andy is a very moody/talkative player on the court. You see massive variations in his gestures and body response based on how the game is going. Of course these antics are off-putting to many, sometimes even his opponents.   Other than that, from what it appears to be, he is a chilled out person. And this I say from what I see outside the court and based on news and articles/ interviews. This is open to debate cause many people may not be what the appear to be!   He is a decent player to watch. Yes, occasionally appears to choke in big games (read finals!). But we must also understand that these past 12~15 years has seen a very competitive set of players in the Men's game. Federer, Djokovic, Nadal, Roddick, Wawrinka, Berdych, Ferrer, Nalbandian, Roberdo, Davydenko etc. (Might have missed a few names, but hopefully you get my point...)."
tennis,3bvfe0,TheOneSurvivalist,-7,Thu Jul 2 14:15:40 2015 UTC,"There is no doubt that his game play has become stronger over the last few years and he is a very capable player and he seems to be gaining control over his nerves in high pressure situations, but as you said his gestures and responses are off-putting and too me that makes him unlikeable... I can understand his frustration of being at the top of his game and still often unable to take the titles but I think I enjoy the sportsmanship of tennis, watching Djok lose the French open with such grace was tear jerking. I feel if it was Murray who lost in that position his anger would be clear and spoil the grace of the game for me anyway."
tennis,3bvfe0,TheOneSurvivalist,5,Thu Jul 2 14:43:39 2015 UTC,"He is an incredibly good player and your blind if you think otherwise. 17 consecutive grand slam quarter finals and 2 titles in an age with the greatest players of all time. He is one off if not the best returner in the game , he goes for every shot . Yes he is aggressive on court when he fails but it's because he is so passionate about the game . When Murray lost Wimbledon in 2012 final he actually began to cry . The English media but IMMENSE pressure on him always expecting him to win everything . Outside of the court Murray is a great guy with an amazing sense of humour. He is a truly remarkable player and person and we won't see another 'British' player like him for a long time."
tennis,3bvfe0,dropshot,2,Thu Jul 2 19:27:56 2015 UTC,I think it's also clear you don't follow tennis that often. Murray is a class above everyone outside top 3 .
tennis,3bvfe0,SwissBliss,2,Thu Jul 2 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"Obviously, people like Murray, otherwise, who would show up to his matches.  He got married, so his wife likes him.  His mom attends his matches, so she likes him.  Those who like him can forgive his temper.  There were people that liked McEnroe, who felt his genius was more relevant than his tantrums.  I think some Americans viewed Andy Roddick similarly to how you view Andy Murray."
tennis,3bvfe0,DRUNKTENNIS,2,Thu Jul 2 15:32:49 2015 UTC,"I'm Swiss so I like Federer and Wawrinka most. After them, I like Murray the most out of the Top 10. I like the way he plays, his style doesn't seem cheap to me like Djoko or Nadal sometimes, he's respectful to his opponents, and is a nice guy. He isn't super charismatic but I still like him.  I do however hate the hype England puts on him. They hype him up like he's the greatest player ever. He's very very good, but jesus they put way too much pressure on him. On BBC they said ""Murray is on his way to a 2nd Wimbledon title""... You wouldn't even say that for the Fed, Djoko, or Nadal."
tennis,3bvfe0,artosis420,-3,Thu Jul 2 15:11:07 2015 UTC,I like Federer the most too and I do think it is the media hype on Murray that makes me dislike him the most. The way they class him as one of the greats when in all fairness he has only won 2 grand slams.

tennis,3bs691,drodin,43,Wed Jul 1 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"During the 1998 Australian Open, sisters Serena and Venus Williams boasted that they could beat any man ranked outside the world's top 200. The challenge was accepted by Karsten Braasch, a German player ranked No 203 (his highest ranking was No 38). Before the matches, Braasch played a round of golf in the morning, drank a couple of beers, smoked a few cigarettes, and then played the Williams sisters for a set each, one after the other. He defeated Serena, 6-1, and Venus, 6-2. Serena said afterwards ""I didn't know it would be that hard. I hit shots that would have been winners on the women's tour and he got to them easily.""   Source"
tennis,3bs691,godlesshero,13,Wed Jul 1 19:21:31 2015 UTC,That's a great answer. I never realised there was such a big gap in quality to not even compete against a player outside the top 200
tennis,3bs691,Plaetean,17,Wed Jul 1 19:36:54 2015 UTC,"It's worse than that. This is going back a few years, but leading up to the Australian Open one time, Serena played a practice match against a guy who was ranked about 800 at the time. His game was all about serving and coming to the net, but because most women players don't do that he was asked to serve and stay back. Plus he wasn't allowed to serve too hard (one of his biggest strengths), or to hit his groundstrokes with too much topspin. He still beat her 6-4.     Another time Kim Clijsters, number 2 in the world at the time, played a practice match against a coach at a club where she was practising (also leading up to the Australian Open). This guy had never played at any professional level, only local competitions, but it was the holiday season and he was the best player around. He had had knee surgery about 4 weeks before that, so he had a big bandage on his knee and he couldn't move too well... and he beat her 6-2.

tennis,3bs691,drodin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:47:23 2015 UTC,Wow what is it about the topspin that women seem to have trouble with? Because they are shorter on average ?
tennis,3bs691,nobuild,11,Wed Jul 1 19:59:24 2015 UTC,"I think its a combination of everything, size, arm length and natural strength required to consistently generate topspin (you have to be able to hit with topspin to compete with topspin) etc"
tennis,3bs691,GATSBYH20,5,Wed Jul 1 20:10:07 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it has to do with how you generate power vs. spin.   You can generate plenty of power by simply leaning into a shot, timing it well, and following through. Generating topsin, on the other hand, requires a much more explosive movement from your legs, torso, and wrist. Women can physically generate a decent amount of power but topspin is much more difficult because their bodies cannot move as explosively. Therefore the women's game naturally developed around hitting flat shots.  Source: I'm grasping at straws."

tennis,3bs691,TODDLER_PUSSY,2,Thu Jul 2 11:44:24 2015 UTC,They're just not used to it. The ATP and even D1 players can generate a level of spin/action on their groundies and serve that the women just can't.

It isn't the height since Sharapova is 6' 2"" and Ivanovic is 6' 0"", but why is men's tennis watched A LOT more than women's tennis. Who would you put in your top 20 for the combined tour? Even if you were completely oblivious to womens vs mens tennis(which it does seem you are) then Serena would be the only one who would even remotely fit in the top 20 of the ATP(which she doesn't...). Even then, even if you knew anything about serves. Some of the lackluster servers in the ATP top 20 like Ferrer or Roberdo have serves that are twice if not thrice as good as Serena's in both speed, spin, and placement.  This thread is almost literally identical to the Sharapova heat sexist thing and countless other women vs men threads.........I've seen the Williams sisters vs Braasch point brought up at least 100 times now within the past year."

tennis,3bs691,MotherCanada,5,Wed Jul 1 23:33:48 2015 UTC,"Women could possibly do better in accuracy sports (say, bowling), but I think it's still the case they don't.  Even chess, which has no physicality, is dominated by men.  This year, in a college basketball 3-pt shooting contest, a woman beat a man.  Also, I recall an Olympic event in pistol shooting that was won by a woman (when it was open to both men/women).  For tennis, it helps that men run faster.  As hard as men hit, the top men still do a pretty good job of chasing shots.  A good hard-hit shot among women is typically a winner which is why I think women are more aggressive off the ground.  They take more chances since a well-struck shot is a winner due to differences in footspeed.  They've had women compete in driving, but Danica Patrick has not been able to do well compared to the men.  She's done OK, which is great, but then so few women compete."

Even if we want to break people into groups, there are practically no whites, asians, and hispanics in the 100m dash. There are practically no blacks in the swimming events at the olympics. These groups have different aptitudes yet they all compete as individuals."
tennis,3bs691,oojemange,6,Wed Jul 1 23:30:51 2015 UTC,"If there were no women's leagues, it is very likely that men would dominate nearly all physical sports. This leads to lack of motivation for women (why put in the same effort as a man when you're just going to lose to him anyway?). A former friend of mine would get very frustrated, because she would lose to me 6-0 nearly every time we played. We had both played the same number of years, but because I was bigger (6'1"" 160lb vs. 5'4"" < 120lb) and faster she didn't have much of a chance. She was significantly more athletic than I was, participated in sports that required a lot of stamina (soccer, track), yet I would beat her easily. Women should not be penalized for having been born with naturally smaller frames.   There are unranked guys who try harder than serena, play better than serena but still can't play for money.   There are people in every sport that try harder than the top players, but that doesn't automatically make them more entitled to prize money than the naturally talented players. I like to think I work hard, and I've both beaten and lost to players that put in significantly less effort than I do. This doesn't give me a right to say I'm somehow more deserving of a win just because I put in more work.  You love to claim sexism against men with comments like this one, yet you seem to lack any self awareness about your own sexism. Stop trying to push your twisted idea about ""equality"" in sports, and just realize that I and others are aware of your resentment toward women and your desire to make every issue about men."
tennis,3bs691,avaliantheel,-2,Thu Jul 2 00:35:33 2015 UTC,"Women should not be penalized for having been born with naturally smaller frames.   Most non pros (most the population on this earth) are penalized for not being as gifted as the top athletes. Most likely you aren't born to play djokovic no matter how hard you try. You are born to play below professional. But suppose you have a potential that is equal to serena; why can't you play against her if you are born with the same potential?   Stop trying to push your twisted idea about ""equality"" in sports, and just realize that I and others are aware of your resentment toward women and your desire to make every issue about men.   I was just playing with the idea. Kind of poking fun at the people demanding equal pay just because equal. Im fine with women having their own thing. I wish people viewed the men that way and let them keep what they earn."
tennis,3bs691,aranaSF,3,Thu Jul 2 01:04:42 2015 UTC,"But suppose you have a potential that is equal to serena; why can't you play against her if you are born with the same potential?   I (not me specifically, a male in general) may be able to have the same potential as Serena just by virtue of genetics, but it is nearly impossible for a woman to have the same potential as Djokovic. Again, I have to reiterate that directly comparing men's and women's players doesn't make sense. As /u/avaliantheel noted in this comment, women would have to be very physically different in order to even come close to the same build as men. In my opinion, it's likely that some women would need to resort to hormones/steroids because huge muscles on women are usually not possible for women to get naturally (obviously exceptions exist).   I was just playing with the idea. Kind of poking fun at the people demanding equal pay just because equal.   This right here just proves my earlier point. Similar to how a person might say ""I'm just asking questions"" in an attempt to avoid backlash against ridiculous claims, you say ""I was just playing with the idea"" to try to make yourself seem more reasonable. As for ""equal pay just because equal,"" women have offered to play best of five multiple times.   I wish people viewed the men that way and let them keep what they earn.   Given that you said this: ""There are unranked guys who try harder than serena, play better than serena but still can't play for money,"" shouldn't players, regardless of gender, earn money based on effort rather than popularity (higher viewership) or success?  To expand on an an earlier point: I'm undefeated against every girl I've played, but that's due to physical strength and endurance more than anything. When I win I don't think, ""Well, I'm just completely technically superior."" No, I think, ""Wow, I played well but this probably would have been much more fair if she were half a foot taller and fifty pounds heavier. You wouldn't expect a heavyweight fighter to take on a featherweight fighter, so they both get their own categories and their own prizes/titles. Different categories exist in sports (age, weight, gender), and it makes sense to have them in order for competitiveness to exist.  Regardless of what you say, we both know that you are simply resentful of women and would rather have all sports end up as de facto men only organizations. I'm sure you'll vehemently deny my accusations, but just be aware that no one is fooled."
tennis,3bs691,avaliantheel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:06:06 2015 UTC,"just an aside. I actually really like women's mma. Those women bring it and they don't make silly equal pay demands nor do they fight under easier rules. In short they are badass and deserving of respect. For the most part those women earn what they get and they take it upon themselves to promote their sport.   on the other hand, women's tennis has taken on a entitlement complex where they think they can just take what the men have. Its a disgusting attitude. Its even worse that the sharapovas and azarenkas of women's tennis get away with their horrible shrieking which reflects a lack of commitment to promote the WTA. Its also very hypocrital for the WTA to demand equal pay but 'offer' 5 setters..."
tennis,3bs691,aranaSF,0,Thu Jul 2 07:45:36 2015 UTC,"but it is nearly impossible for a woman to have the same potential as Djokovic   its impossible for most people, including most men. Its also is impossible for all women. What do these generalizations even matter?   directly comparing men's and women's players doesn't make sense   directly comparing 99%+ of men to djokovic doesn't make sense. Almost all men do not have the ability djokovic has.    Wow, I played well but this probably would have been much more fair if she were half a foot taller and fifty pounds heavier.   What is your point? try going to the nba and saying i got really good technical skill but i simply can't do squat because I'm slow, weak, and short.   People are limited by physical attributes they were born with. what does it matter if you are guy or girl.   Lets say your athletic potential is equal to serena, which obviously means you don't have the potential to play against the best men. Is it any more your fault that you were born without the skills to compete against the best in the world than it was serenas fault that she was born a woman? no.   This right here just proves my earlier point.   no, it really doesn't. Im not ashamed at all for the ideas I posted.   I was actually playing around. Im not the controlling type to say that gender bias in sports should not be allowed.    Different categories exist in sports (age, weight, gender), and it makes sense to have them in order for competitiveness to exist.   There is not a category for age at the professional level. It only matter what you can do as a individual. You can we well past your prime, like federer, and still compete with the rest. gender =/= ability. Why should gender be a category; why not treat people as individuals?  Women are generally weaker than men. But that doesn't mean we should categorically deny them positions as fire fighters, rescue workers, or soldiers if they prove themselves as individuals.    You wouldn't expect a heavyweight fighter to take on a featherweight fighter   In that analogy ethiopian women are middle weights and eskimo men are featherweights but you would use gender to make feather weights (eskimo men) compete against heavyweights (ethiopian men). You are using gender to push down people who are already disadvantaged.    Regardless of what you say, we both know that you are simply resentful of women and would rather have all sports end up as de facto men only organizations   by your logic we should have races compete separately. you think this would be different than separating men from women but that is only because you are used to that.    shouldn't players, regardless of gender, earn money based on effort rather than popularity (higher viewership) or success?   Im glad we agree that pay should be based on viewership."

tennis,3bovxy,DullahanPT,3,Wed Jul 1 01:52:50 2015 UTC,His stats were actually better this year:  +24 on winners/errors as apposed to +20 last year.  Higher 1st and 2nd serve points won.  Better break point conversions.

The queue experience is actually really good, and sometimes various people/players from the tennis community do come out and entertain the crowd. I know Judy Murray & John McEnroe have been out there talking to people before. I did it a few years ago, and managed to see some of the British girls play on the outside courts at around 6pm.

tennis,3bnl4z,droplob,4,Wed Jul 1 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"That's cause the WTA has different rules from the ATP, and yes, there is none of that in the Slams."
tennis,3bnl4z,Personacorona,4,Wed Jul 1 01:57:00 2015 UTC,There is no reason to play in conditions that could injure players. Wimbledon and every other major tournament has had extensions that made the tournament a day or more longer. It isn't a big deal. Delay matches to the evening if you have to. Some fans will be pissed while others will be happy because they don't have to watch sluggish players.
tennis,3bnl4z,ANukeGuy,17,Wed Jul 1 02:33:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, Wimbledon created the heat rule. It's not a WTA rule. It's a Wimbledon rule. The WTA and ATP own various tournaments, but the slams are not owned by the ATP or WTA. In the case of Wimbledon, it's owned by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, and The Championships is administrated by the ITF (a unisex organization), which created the heat rule."

The WTA has put this heat rule in effect to not harm their players. The ATP has not. Why even ask Maria that question? Its not her place to decide or answer. She answers it the best way she can.
tennis,3bnl4z,productivewinks,9,Tue Jun 30 18:15:29 2015 UTC,Update: Sue Barker just confirmed that it's because it's a WTA rule and that the ATP would have to decide to include it for men.    I thought that the slams were ITF run tournaments.  I'm with you on asking the question in that instance though.
tennis,3bnl4z,ChaeDoc_II,22,Tue Jun 30 18:34:19 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, during the 2014 AO when the massive heat became a real issue, the women had the the possibility to stop during the match. But not the men. The reason stated was that the WTA had a say in their players well being. But no such ruled existed for the men. But really, that should be corrected asap."

BUT, while some argue it's sexist against men, I think it's pretty sexist towards women. It implies women are too ""frail"" and need exceptions, even though many have shown to be quite capable of playing long grueling matches. I'm sure the women would much prefer to play the sport in the same way men do in these tournaments if given the opportunity. I think this is akin to how the WNBA (professional women's basketball in the USA) plays with a smaller ball. Do they really need that? I've played basketball against plenty of girls who kick my ass using the men's ball.   I am against the notion that women automatically deserve equal pay to men for playing the same sport if they are not playing each other (and this won't happen), but that doesn't mean you need to change the sport for them. Women are more than capable of playing these sports sports. Sadly for them, they won't garner the same attention and revenue that men's sports do, but it's dumb to change the rules of the sport to make it ""easier"" for them. They are more than capable."

tennis,3bnl4z,Kolaris8472,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:55:09 2015 UTC,It only takes one player to request it though. I would guess the players with better fitness do not like this rule.

There was an article in the NY Times recently about how they play on fake turf filled with bits of recycled rubber from tires, the stuff overheats, gets everywhere, and isn't even proven to be safe.  To me, that's totally crazy that they don't use real grass."
tennis,3bnl4z,Adariel,2,Wed Jul 1 14:30:37 2015 UTC,"It is, and a large group of players threaten to sue and called FIFA out about how the men would never have to deal with it.

FIFA also does some rather outdated and primitive gender testing (way behind even the IOC), doesn't do anything to make sure federations are giving their women's programs adequate funding, etc."

The idea that women can't play 5-set matches is completely stupid considering women are fully capable of completing marathons and other immense feats of endurance.   Do I think that 10min break for men would be nice? Yes. Do I think it's sexist that they don't have it? No."
tennis,3bnl4z,Friend_Lord,7,Wed Jul 1 03:35:21 2015 UTC,I think you'd find that most women would be fine with playing more sets (they offered just that when fighting for equal prize money at the majors). The problem is more the tournament organizers and getting every match on the schedule completed.  You're more likely to see the men go to 3 sets for injury concerns than  the women going to 5.
tennis,3bnl4z,redavid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:05:44 2015 UTC,I think they should start the men's or women's (alternating by years) 2 days earlier so the genders are playing 1st and 2nd round at the same time. Then women playing best of 5 would be no problem.  And that's several more centre court matches to sell.
tennis,3bnl4z,kroxigor01,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:47:49 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. So it's not that officials think women are incapable, it's that tournament organizers don't want women's matches to take up as much time? That's messed up."
tennis,3bnl4z,Friend_Lord,8,Wed Jul 1 01:26:31 2015 UTC,"TV ratings are presumably higher for men's matches, so it probably makes sense for organizers to prioritize them over the women's matches to maximize ad revenue."
tennis,3bnl4z,Rev_Up_Those_Reposts,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:28:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's still messed up though. It makes sense from a profit-maximizing perspective, but it at the end of the day it is inequality. In a sport where cross-gender competition exists (mixed dubs) it's a shame that there is still inequality within the professional structure."
tennis,3bnl4z,Friend_Lord,2,Tue Jun 30 19:48:27 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that mixed dubs was more for fan entertainment than for actual competition. It is, after all, played mostly by current singles players. I don't think that there are permanent mixed doubles teams at the highest level. If anything, mixed doubles is arguably detrimental to the women's game because it can show the average, casual fan the difference in overall power and speed, potentially causing them to choose watching men over women in the future.  As far as it being messed up, it's no more messed up than football and basketball players making more money than hockey players. There is not inherent sexism but rather the consumer driving the market. The average consumer would simply rather invest time and money into watching basketball and football because they find it more exciting. In tennis, someone choosing to watch men over women really isn't very different. Many find the men's game more exciting, so many people are more likely to view men play. Many enjoy and appreciate the women's game, although not as many will watch women more than men.   At the end of the day, the salaries, endorsements, and purses earned by players at the professional level is in direct proportion to the money made by tickets and ad revenue. There is no inequality within the professional structure but rather an inequality of revenue. One can say that it's a shame that women might not get paid as much as men, but it's the result of consumer preferences."

It's terrible that people don't know what sexism and racism mean these days..  Sexism is hating on females or males.  Favoring certain group about something is not sexism.  Obviously men can endure more pain and are generally stronger than women, so it's obvious that Women playing 3 sets tops and having 5 min breaks between sets is not sexist at all..  Come on, let's not make Women play best of 5 sets matches for equality or make men play best of 3 sets matches at GSs..  Let's keep this sexism/racism bullshit out of sports..especially tennis.

tennis,3bq322,daunvidch,2,Wed Jul 1 06:42:48 2015 UTC,im guessing your mains break first? 1.23 mm (probably a 17 gauge or 18L) mains is a very thin string for a midplus 99 sq.in. area with an open bed of 16x18 string pattern. the area and string pattern alone will probably eat through strings. i have the same problem with my 95 sq in 16x18 6.1 hyper prostaff. i have two recommendations: go a full bed of 1.30mm (16g) to 1.35mm (15g) poly OR in my opinion a hybrid of poly mains and synthetic gut cross will be far more durable in the long run using at least 16 g here too of course. maybe 16g poly in the mains and 15g syn gut in the cross.  i think the two biggest factors to increase durability is to reduce tension and/or change your cross to a synthetic gut so your polys dont eat into each other as quickly as well as increasing the gauge of your string for both scenarios.
tennis,3bq322,jrstriker12,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:32:25 2015 UTC,"Mostly agree, but a synth gut cross wouldn't be a durable as a poly cross, especially since he's using a shaped string. That shaped poly main will eat through even quicker."

tennis,3bq322,jrstriker12,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:11:31 2015 UTC,"synth gut is softer so it wont bite into the mains as much, preventing the mains from breaking as fast as a poly on poly would. if you dont mind switching string set-ups for better durability, i would really recommend a 1.30 mm smooth main poly (nontextured/shaped) with a 1.35 mm synthetic gut. it should last way longer. however if youre more concerned with keeping up your current performance over price, then just keep what you have."
tennis,3bq322,dubsdaazn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:20:04 2015 UTC,"Go for a thicker guage in the mains. Looks like the Mamba is only 17 gauge, may want to try 16 or 15.  Also maybe use a non-gear shaped poly main.  They also make lubricated / low-friction cross strings (http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/Gamma_Glide_Cross_String_Half_Set/descpageACGAMMA-GGX.html) - reducing the friction between the mains and crosses could keep them from breaking as quickly."
tennis,3bq322,iode,2,Thu Jul 2 21:01:52 2015 UTC,If i increase gauge i decrease the bite that i get from my ball. I've dont full poly bed of sppp 16 and they still break in 8 hours. And my string setup is designed to give me as minimum friction with good bite.
tennis,3bq322,vlee89,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:12:47 2015 UTC,"after reading all your replies, at this point you are probably going to have to sacrifice a little something. Either put some more durable strings in the crosses and take a hit on the feel of the string. Because basically your textured poly is sawing through your strings. I believe what you put in your mains would affect the overall spin potential the most so keep that the same and hybrid it with something like kevlar maybe. I can't tell how that will feel in comparison to what you have now though."

This is an irrelevance.  Also, for the sake of completeness, you're missing the 2015 French Open and 2013 US Open for Murray in Djokovic's half. Murray and Federer were also in opposite halves for Wimbledon 2012 and the 2014 French Open, though those are arguably outliers due to the rankings at the time.   Even so, that means that Murray has been in the opposite half to Federer in roughly half of the majors since 2012 RG. No conspiracy there."

tennis,3bnn3i,mastrkief,9,Tue Jun 30 17:49:42 2015 UTC,Depends on skill level and type of serve. 80-90% of the time you want to be close to baseline and cut off angle. Sometimes the server has straight GAS and you will need to back up to give yourself a little more time until you figure it out.
tennis,3bnn3i,sizzlingcurry,10,Tue Jun 30 18:00:43 2015 UTC,Nadal would like to have a word with you.

tennis,3bnn3i,dropshot,5,Tue Jun 30 20:36:35 2015 UTC,"It depends on the skill level of you and your opponent.  If your opponent can't create an angle, then there may be no reason to back up.  If you are slow to react, you may want to back up.  If you can react quickly, then you might stand in more.  You can experiment with both.  If one's not working, try the other."
tennis,3bnn3i,fart-sausage,2,Tue Jun 30 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"Great response here. I haven't been a good returner since high school, but I decided to start thinking about ways to fix that. My latest strategy has been to start matches standing back and then once I'm reading a serve well, start to crowd the baseline and be more aggressive with it."
tennis,3bnn3i,colincojo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:39:50 2015 UTC,"Great response. There is clearly no better way, as some pros stand right on the baseline, some pros stand super far back, and most pros vary their position greatly depending on many factors like the surface and who they're playing against."
tennis,3bnn3i,CorneliusFudgePacker,4,Wed Jul 1 03:29:48 2015 UTC,Mario Tennis is all about moving in and cutting it off
tennis,3bnn3i,BMKingPrime27,2,Tue Jun 30 18:33:54 2015 UTC,Mario tennis is my shit
tennis,3bnn3i,KyleG,2,Tue Jun 30 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"This question is a little like ""should I hit a topspin or underspin forehand against my opponent?"" The answer is: it depends on context."
tennis,3bnn3i,droplob,2,Tue Jun 30 23:13:37 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, depends on the level of play, but generally I think that for a big kick serve, it's better to move in and take it on the rise, for flat serves, a little better to move back and gain reaction time. Then again many pros seem to like backing up for the kicker, especially on clay"
tennis,3bnn3i,Huebsch,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:52:36 2015 UTC,Kicker is hard to control on the rise...
tennis,3bnn3i,droplob,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:55:54 2015 UTC,"True, but I think it's better than trying to hit it when it's above your head.. standing way back and waiting for it to drop works too but leaves you more open to the slice"
tennis,3bnn3i,vlee89,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:09:43 2015 UTC,"If they are serving with angles, you need to move in to cut it off. When they angle it they will have less power.  Some servers will hit really strong serves, but the harder you hit it the more through the court it will go and less angle you will have. So against these types of servers, you generally back up to handle the pace and aren't worried about the angle.  Both return strategies work depending on the situation. When in doubt, step in as much as you can to return the serve. If you find that the power is overwhelming you, you take a couple steps back to return and adjust accordingly."
tennis,3bnn3i,jrstriker12,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:47:42 2015 UTC,"I've done both depedning on the opponent and a serve.  For guys who can really slice the ball wide, I move in to cut off the angle.  If the guy isn't hitting slice and I'm not having much success taking it early I'll back up to give myself a bit more time."
tennis,3bnn3i,reddit_2901,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:16:46 2015 UTC,"I like moving in on the ad-side because I have a fast one handed backhand (try to copy Fed's tactic of a big backhand return).  On the forehand side I'm more likely to move back a half step against bigger servers, then on the second serve I like to take a step forward exactly when the opponent is looking at you right before the toss - can put some people off until they get used to it."
tennis,3bnn3i,winowmak3r,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:47:24 2015 UTC,"Video game tennis? I move in, like way in. I have success with this strategy when I've played Mario Tennis and tennis in GTA V. Real life tennis? Depends. More often than not I usually hang back a bit until I get a feel for my opponent's serve then if I think I can I move up to cut it off if I will. I feel that if you can move up to cut it off you definitely have the advantage."
tennis,3bnn3i,Comrod,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:26:11 2015 UTC,"I would say that, at least when I return, if I think about where the ball is going to exactly be, I miss it a lot. That is, giving myself more time to react to the serve often doesn't really help. So if the serve is going really fast that you're probably not going to get to it, you may as well stand really close. At least give yourself an opportunity to take time away from the opponent if you get a racquet on it."
tennis,3bnn3i,Lewan72,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:20:12 2015 UTC,"I remember Nadal games where he would stand super far back. I also remember Federer games where he stands closer to the baseline. It depends on the server, type of surdace, etc."
tennis,3bnn3i,831pm,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:30:05 2015 UTC,"Aside from the obvious thing about player level, in general, you want to cut off the angle on your ad court (where a right hander can slice it wide) and give yourself some room on your deuce (where a right hander can slice it down the middle)."
tennis,3bnn3i,DrStangle,-1,Wed Jul 1 11:53:21 2015 UTC,"You should always step in when returning a serve. This is so you have forward momentum which will help you with hitting a better return.  Think about a normal rally hit, you always want to be hitting it forwards so to say and so you never step back to hit it."

Will always be one of the best ever, although Rafa and Federer are so crazy dominant, I think they've both passed Pete.  I'll always relate to Pete though. I don't live at the net as much as him, but I think have a somewhat similar game. Big serve. Defensive one hand backhand most of the time slicing it back deep, on occasion, going for broke with a one hand winner (let's be real, it's probably more often than not into the net or long, but when it's good, it's the best feeling shot in all of tennis).  Inside out forehands all the time. Charge the net after a good groundstroke.  The bit about him being stubborn against technology I can totally relate to. We see new tennis advancements in racket technology all the time, and I got a new racket I actually like a lot (it's a Technofibre racket) but I somehow always find myself going back to my lead weighted Prince TT Warrior."

tennis,3bm3gk,Hizenboig,19,Tue Jun 30 12:51:30 2015 UTC,Thats an absolute joke of a call by the umpire. Tsonga hits a forehand which is called in on the baseline. Muller stops play and challenges the call a split second before the umpire overules the call to call it out. Now Tsonga has to challenge the call which hawkeye shows that it is in and the umpire says replay the point. That is absolute bullshit decision. Feel for Tsonga there.

tennis,3bm3gk,red_280,12,Tue Jun 30 15:13:10 2015 UTC,"It's all mental, right? I mean, she can't have gotten through a chain of quality players last time on pure luck alone."
tennis,3bm3gk,MajorMajorHenryFonda,8,Tue Jun 30 15:26:41 2015 UTC,"A good majority of it seems mental I'd say. Think some of it has to do with her approach of all-out attack against everyone backfiring a bit more than usual.   But whenever she is struggling a bit in matches, I'm not sure she thinks she can hit her way out of it at the moment."
tennis,3bm3gk,random989898,4,Tue Jun 30 15:34:17 2015 UTC,I haven't seen much of her this year but when I watched her matches last year she seems to struggle/loose confidence when she is in the lead and when shes behind she gains some confidence.  It's weird.
tennis,3bm3gk,red_280,3,Tue Jun 30 15:39:43 2015 UTC,"I think last year was all mental in a good way and this year is all mental in a bad way. She had a pretty easy draw at the AO in 2014 and made a good run giving her a huge boost of confidence. I think at that point her ego soared and she started to see herself as a superstar (dreams of childhood coming true). That overconfidence and a fairly easy draw carried her far in the FO, further buoying her confidence. She was the underdog, no pressure, come out of nowhere story. Lots of media attention, lots of endorsements, she was the ""it"" girl.  She went into Wimbledon believing she could win it, and beat Halep and Wozniaki. A combination of luck, some skill and a confidence level of 12/10. Then the luck ran out, the confidence started to go down and down and down and down. I think at this point she probably feels she is jinxed and can't win.   I think once she matures and settles down mentally she will be ranked in the 20s or so. Her skill level really isn't top 10 or even 15. She will probably make it to 2nd/3rd rounds fairly regularly and occasionally make deeper runs. If over the years she gets strong mentally maybe she will be ranked in the teens. If she doesn't strengthen mentally I don't think she will stay on tour all that long. I can't see her toiling in the 30s for a decade."

tennis,3bm3gk,freedoms_stain,2,Tue Jun 30 16:39:39 2015 UTC,"Very similar but not quite exactly the same either. A Grand Slam finalist gets 1200 points in the ATP but 1300 in the WTA for instance, and it's even more skewed in the earlier rounds. Winning a lower tier WTA tournament is worth 280 points in the WTA instead of 250. Overall, the ATP system is more in favor of the tournament's winner while the WTA redistributes the points more evenly."

tennis,3bm3gk,tinewashere,5,Tue Jun 30 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"Halep and Bouchard both going out in the 1st round.. yeah, I think Serena will keep dominating for a few more years, don't see anything special in this so-called next generation to trouble her consistently.

tennis,3bm3gk,dragonsky,4,Tue Jun 30 17:15:59 2015 UTC,"So much today to like.  Great to see Laura Robson back, there were flashes of brilliance but also more often flashes of being out of match practice and lacking sharpness. Meanwhile Watson looked impressive against Garcia, with only really the slip up at 6:5 up. So happy Watson wrapped up that win, she is due a deep run into a Slam (considering Robson has always been the player people have looked at) and I really hope she can make 2nd week (it'd be a tough ask).  Halep & Bouchard crashing out is concerning, Halep more so than Bouchard, because Bouchard is in an absolute slump, and now as she was defending points from last year will slump outside the Top 20. Halep was intriguing, not sure what happened, but the foot injury probably didn't help although it didn't really affect her actual movement on court. Cepelova played really really well though, but when Halep was on top of the rallies, she missed easy winners which is unlike her at Slams. It was strange to see.  Murray had a slip up in Set 2 of his match, but other than that was on auto pilot. Positive to see."

tennis,3bm3gk,jkalderash,10,Tue Jun 30 15:30:24 2015 UTC,The only reason why Nadal and Federer both seemed to be playing at the same time was because Kvitova won her match in 35 minutes. If it had been a 'normal' match time there would've been much less overlap.

tennis,3box88,gimmeporno,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:42:02 2015 UTC,I use a 17L multi filament. For a normal synthetic gosen of sheep micro is a decent choice. It's not as soft as a multi but the reels are cheap.  I gave up on poly strings when my shoulder started hurting. Way less pain now but I restring my racquets every 1-2 weeks.
tennis,3box88,jrstriker12,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:00:02 2015 UTC,"Gut is probably best but it sounds like you'll need to do more to correct the problem with your wrist.   Those shots will only temporarily deal with the pain, have you gone to a doctor to find the main issue that's causing the pain?"
tennis,3box88,jrstriker12,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:31:45 2015 UTC,"Haha, I went to the doctor and at the time they thought it was a wrist sprain, but after I got an MRI they said it wasn't a sprain. I never really got a diagnosis.  I think it is more along the lines of tendinopathy. The original problem was from falling on my wrists and it didn't hurt that badly at the time, but all of a sudden when playing tennis something popped and I couldn't even lift a spoon for the first couple days.  Also doesn't gut break really easily? I don't have a stringer so stringing frequently starts to cost a lot. Otherwise I've heard good things about it."

Man,   Sounds like a bit more than a over use injury, especially if the pain came after a fall.  A high quality gut is fairly durable as long as you don't get it wet and you're not a string breaking monster. It's a bit pricey though. Could also look at some softer multis or a string like Babolat Origin.   I'd still figure out what's going on with that wrist."

He said he played as though he was ranked 600 to give them a chance. Lots of D1 players could make it at least that far as pros, so I'd say the college player would definitely win."

tennis,3bnmm3,TacticalTennis,-5,Tue Jun 30 18:51:58 2015 UTC,"i don't think any D1 starting scholarship player would kill Serena.  a good chuck of them can, but I think a majority of them cannot.  If you're talking about talking about a D1 school that is ranked, then I'd agree.  But the range of D1 players is large as there are lot of schools that are not very good."
tennis,3bnmm3,ralphplzgo,4,Wed Jul 1 00:22:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you understand just how wide the gap in tennis is between men and women. I could pluck a good 16 year old boy from the junior ranks and he's probably going to beat almost every female professional player in the world. Any guy who is winning more than a single round in a Future's qualifying event is beating Serena in straight sets, pretty easily.  Any guy who's playing at a half-decent college (and yes, that includes most unranked schools) is beating Serena in straight sets, easily.  Heck, a month ago I drilled with a D1 guy from an unranked school who was working on his serve. He was literally serving with a half a motion, and Serena would struggle to win a game off him. The gap is huge. It's absolutely huge.  The former college guys I know who practiced with top female pros (including Serena) literally had to let them win games to keep their confidence up. As in the coach specifically told them to let the girl win games."
tennis,3bnmm3,TacticalTennis,3,Wed Jul 1 01:12:09 2015 UTC,"I understand the gap and I realize it is huge.  I really do.  I'm not saying that Serena is better than you think, I'm saying that I there exists a group for D1 players who are starting scholarship players that are worse than you think.  I understand the former college guys you know are probably prettttyy good.  That's probably why they have the opportunity to practice with top pros.   I'm talking about a scholarship players playing #3/4 singles for some bottom ranked D1 schools (think Big Sky Conf.).  I know one and watched some of them.  These guys are good at tennis...but not thaaat good.  Those guys have no shot against Serena.  I imagine your former college players would not belong to this group.  So yes, I agree, a half-decent college player would have an easy time with a female pro.  I'm just saying the statement -   ""By D1 player I assume you mean an actual starting, scholarship player. In that case the guy wins every single time. They would kill Serena.""  is a bit inaccurate."

I doubt its the only D1 school of this caliber.  Unless UND doesn't recruit, this seems to contradict your statement.  I agree good D3 schools wouldn't recruit 2 stars.  Some of them get so much talent just because of their academics.  I just don't think you are aware of how poor some D1 teams are.

Nonetheless, they do have funding but likely not enough to recruit outside the region.  I also imagine that other D1 schools are in a similar position.  Bottom D1 is not very good."

I'm sure you are right that the 16 year old could have beat Serena.  I'll even go further and say there is probably a 13 year old that could beat Serena.  I understand the gap dude.  I just don't think you are aware of the level down at the bottom of D1.  You seem to be playing/training people who are better than that.

tennis,3bnmm3,YaoPau,8,Wed Jul 1 02:20:40 2015 UTC,"Dude I stopped playing futures 10 years ago. And not to be rude, but it doesn't much matter to me if you believe me or not. It's just the reality of the situation.  I practiced next to a female multi slam winner every day for two weeks a few years ago. She had a professional hitting partner who had neither played college nor had ever gotten a single ATP point. I hit with him a little here and there. He was good, and he had to take it easy with the player so she could win games and feel good about her game.  He was on par with the guys I'm talking about having met playing futures, if not weaker than. He could crush this top 10 female player, and he wasn't even training to play competitive tennis. He literally went out every day and hit with someone much worse than him for money. Not exactly the same thing as training to play professional tennis himself."
tennis,3bnmm3,TacticalTennis,0,Wed Jul 1 02:36:00 2015 UTC,"These are big claims from a decade ago and this is the internet, anyone can claim anything.  You played futures, do you have an ITF player page?  You can't name one person you're referencing?  Your arguments are basically ""I was there, I know what I'm talking about"", and it's hard to take that seriously when there's no proof of it."
tennis,3bnmm3,YaoPau,6,Wed Jul 1 03:24:57 2015 UTC,"Essentially, you are asking him to reveal himself completely.  Not something Reddit members are too fond of doing.  So from another anonymous tennis player with ample experience like TacticalTennis, he knows what he is talking about.    Let's break it down.  The guys have way better range, spin, quickness, and well 10-25% more pace on just about every stroke.  Go ahead and watch an ATP match where groundstrokes are hit from outside the doubles lines and you might see that once a match for WTA. Did I mention they tried 3 out of 5 set matches with the women and it blew up in their faces.  Search: women try 3 out of 5 sets. Endurance is a huge factor in tennis.  Serena's footwork is atrocious but, she plays the closest to a man's power game.  Hence the 20 titles.   Sit down Yao, you retired already.    p.s. But really though, let's laugh for a minute and just think what would happen if they put Ivo Karlovic on the court with any female, from any generation...lots of bagels and breadsticks to go around."
tennis,3bnmm3,TheBreastCoast,-1,Wed Jul 1 07:20:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you've read this thread.  We aren't talking about ATP players, we're comparing Serena to an average #1 tennis player on a college men's team, someone who would be ranked in the #500-#1000 range, trying to qualify for futures, and has no shot at making a living off tennis."
tennis,3bnmm3,YaoPau,3,Wed Jul 1 12:51:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know how they matched up if they actually played a match, but Serena's former longtime hitting partner Sascha Bajin had a peak ATP rank of 1149, for whatever it's worth."
tennis,3bnmm3,seyakomo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:46:55 2015 UTC,"I met literally hundreds of people playing futures. Hundreds of them. For some funny reason no, I don't remember all their names. A couple of them I am still good friends with this many years later, and the rest bar one or two I wouldn't recognize if I ran into them on the street. It was a long time ago and a lot has happened to me in my life in the interim.  I don't know what proof you're expecting from me. A sworn affidavit from someone stating they beat Serena easily in a practice set back in 2005? Be suspicious. I was sharing the information to answer the question, not because I have some need to prove something to you. It matters little to me."

tennis,3bnmm3,droplob,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:58:29 2015 UTC,yup.  lots of shitty d1 programs exist.  lots of d2 programs that are very good also exist.  Bottom d1 programs have will have some 1 star recruits playing for them.

I think 1200-1300 would imply that a lot of the players at a top 25 school would be able to beat her and she wouldn't stand much of a chance at #1 singles.
tennis,3bnmm3,ralphplzgo,2,Wed Jul 1 03:46:46 2015 UTC,We have a coach for the summer that is a D1 player his explosiveness is unbelievable. I think that physicality would let the college player win every time.

He was a hitting partner for a woman ranked in the top 30 during the Australian Open.  In a practice match preceding the open he won 6-3 6-1.  She wasn't top 10 standard, but he certainly isn't top college material"

tennis,3bnmm3,ralphplzgo,4,Tue Jun 30 21:41:44 2015 UTC,I think Serena stands the best chance of any female player ever but it's still unlikely. There's a quote out there by Capriati saying how she couldn't beat her college athlete brother because he was so much stronger.
tennis,3bnmm3,Occitzer,3,Wed Jul 1 00:25:57 2015 UTC,Above average D3 players would beat up on the top women. Top high schoolers would as well. I don't get how people even need to ask this question.
tennis,3bnmm3,latman,2,Wed Jul 1 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"Hold up what? Do you really think D3 and top highschoolers could beat serena williams? Get out of here... the difference is not that big. Another user posted an article that serena would rank in the 1200s, hardly D3 level."
tennis,3bnmm3,Lewan72,3,Wed Jul 1 01:16:38 2015 UTC,The top few high schoolers would absolutely beat Serena. These are 18 year old guys. And many D3 players are D1 caliber. I played #1 on a mediocre D3 team and got a chance to play and beat Bethanie Mattek-Sands last year. It wasn't easy but was never really in doubt.
tennis,3bnmm3,latman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:36:50 2015 UTC,"Okay explain how an actual former-pro tennis player with more experience than you would put Serena in the 1200s, which is way better than ""top high-school players"" or D3 teams?"
tennis,3bnmm3,Lewan72,2,Wed Jul 1 14:20:05 2015 UTC,Once you get that high the rankings aren't even accurate. Some guys are higher because they can afford to play in more tourneys than other guys. You take a top d3 or high schooler and let him have a blank check to play in as many tourneys as possible and he will get an atp ranking in that range.
tennis,3bnmm3,latman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:00:29 2015 UTC,"The ""top highschoolers"" include guys who are already semi-pros. The top rising HS senior is Michael Mmoh, who's played in challengers. That's at a level I think everyone agrees is above Serena. And, forget rankings in the 1200s; his atp ranking is 646."

tennis,3bnmm3,Infectednarwhal,-1,Tue Jun 30 20:24:36 2015 UTC,"Wow I think the answers have tilted too far in the opposite direction.  First of all, Serena is around 5'11"" (listed at 5'9"" but she's clearly taller than that in pictures), and hits her serve around 120mph, which is decent pop even for a good male player (it's just a bit under what Djokovic serves).  Then add in that she's a lot more consistent from the baseline than most college players, and I think she'd be a good college player, possibly #1 singles at an okay program, which would put her in the #500-1000 range worldwide."
tennis,3bnmm3,YaoPau,6,Tue Jun 30 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"Her serve is just a run of the mill thing in the guy's game - nothing remotely special, and something they've all seen a thousand times before. Returning a 120mph serve that doesn't spread the box all that much is routine for them. Serena is used to hitting 120mph then mopping up from the middle of the court. Have you ever seen her play when she had to consistently hit her first ball on the run or on defense after serving?  Also a good college player would eat her second serve for a pre-breakfast snack.  Then the big factor is just the movement. In an agility test a decent college player will absolutely destroy Serena, and that's the separating factor. It isn't even about serve speed, or groundstroke speed. It's about movement. Serena just could not hang in a rally with a good male player. What you see as her being 'a lot more consistent' is her actually playing against people who rarely make her move, and struggle to handle her power level. Any decent college player would easily outstrip her in consistency against the level of opponent she plays. But they have to play people who serve better, hit better, and move better. The stakes are higher. So they make more errors.  I don't think she'd even make the starting lineup of the men's team at Emory University, and they are a no scholarship, D3 team (albeit a very, very good one)."
tennis,3bnmm3,TacticalTennis,-1,Wed Jul 1 13:33:49 2015 UTC,"First of all, Serena is around 5'11"" (listed at 5'9"" but she's clearly taller than that in pictures ), and hits her serve around 120mph, which is decent pop even for a good male player (it's just a bit under what Djokovic serves).   You bring up a good point, check out Andy Murray's second serve is slower than Serena's. Obviously neither of them is known for their serves, but it's still a good point."
tennis,3bnmm3,strike2867,3,Wed Jul 1 02:11:02 2015 UTC,"Obviously neither of them is known for their serves, but it's still a good point.   I'll have to respectfully disagree with you about Serena. With the third fastest recorded serve for women, she is definitely known for her serve. Her clutch serving is basically what has kept her in a few recent tournaments, because it's reliable even when she's not 100%. I may have misunderstood your comment, though, so if you were referring to Djokovic then I would definitely agree that he is not known for his serve."
tennis,3bnmm3,The_Murican,0,Wed Jul 1 02:42:21 2015 UTC,"I meant Djokovic and Murray, I can see how you could make the mistake from what I said, my bad."
tennis,3bnmm3,strike2867,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:26:53 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's all good. I figured I might have misinterpreted your comment since Serena's serve is so huge in the women's game; that's why I like to put disclaimers in my comments."

tennis,3boku1,Redblah,5,Tue Jun 30 21:49:46 2015 UTC,"Aside from the ones you mentioned these are the other top American teens:  Stefan Kozlov: Currently ranked 365, he made the finals of a challenger last year when he was only 16. He was also runner up at last year's junior Australian Open and Wimbledon. Since then though he's struggled a bit and has had quite a few losses. His games not too big but he could go far.  Taylor Harry Fritz: At 17 he's the number one junior in the world, and junior French Open runner up. He hasn't played much on the adult circuit (currently ranked 679), but he did just have his first tour level win against world 67 Pablo Carrero Busta at Nottingham. His game seems pretty solid and with work could go far  Reply Opelka: Standing at just over 6' 10"" and only 17 he's one of the tallest tennis players ever. After turning pro earlier this year he's had constant injur problems, but at the junior French Open he was able to oust the number one seed Orlando Luz only to fall in the quarters to the guy we'll get to next, Michael Mmoh. All in all as long as he can put his injuries behind him, he has the height and the skill to go on to have a career at least as good as Isner.  Michael Mmoh: He's number 4 ranked junior and junior French Open semifinalist (we did really good at the junior RG if you haven't noticed). At the US Open him and Tiafoe made the second round in doubles, but that's the only note worthy accomplishment on the main tour. Since he hasn't gone pro yet he's played mostly all junior events and because of that I haven't been able to see much of how he plays, so I can't say much about his actual skills  All in all American tennis seems to be in a brighter than it has in a looong time. If all our teens can live up to their potential, then America might just be a dominant force in tennis again."

Once inside buy a cup of Pimms and then you will have the cup and fruit without the £8 price tag every time! Second Thursday is closer to the end so there will be less opportunities to see players practicing, but a higher chance that if you do see someone it will be top 10/20. Bring food in with you or walk down to Wimbledon village to eat as food inside is very expensive, although it is rather good! You can get a reasonably priced burger if you go to the restaurant on your left as you walk through the front gate, just past the scoreboard. There will most probably be some exhibition matches on some of the smaller courts,  which are always great fun to watch and can let you get close to some legends, such as McEnroe, Bahrami, Conte etc... Make sure you bring water in as sitting on center with the sun beating down can really take it out of you unless you keep hydrated. The Fun area behind court 3 is always worth a visit, especially a few pimms down! You can do speed of serve and play little matches and what not so good if you have someone with you for a laugh!  Wimbledon really is a great day out, one of my favorites of the year, it can be done as cheaply or as expensively as you'd like, just need to make sure you take in food/drink if you are on a budget, only 1 bottle of alcohol allowed per person. Me and my girlfriend usually take a bottle of pimms and a bottle of prosecco to get things started. You don't have to pay £80 a bottle for the up market feeling!

tennis,3bmaz9,JasonWaterfallls,4,Tue Jun 30 13:19:30 2015 UTC,"Try the outside courts (numbered 3-19) if you ditch the match on Centre, your ticket allows access to all these. The big screen on Aorangi Terrace (aka Murray Mound, fka Henman Hill) has a great atmosphere too, where the beautiful people flock to get hammered. If you want to make the most tennis possible out of your trip, get to Wimbledon as early as public transport allows on Weds AM and queue for ground tickets. This lets you watch the outside courts, and after 3pm you can pick up early returns for the big seated main courts from corporate wankers who have left early"

Also, stay until play stops on the outside courts. The centre court games always finish before the smaller courts so once play is done on there, you can go find a space to stand on the courts outside. Some of them have stands and will let you in as well. It's crazy how close you can get to the awesome standard of tennis. Have a nice time though!"
tennis,3bmaz9,lminors,2,Tue Jun 30 13:44:39 2015 UTC,"Centre Court doesn't always finish before the smaller courts at all, especially towards the end of the tournament.

tennis,3bmaz9,lminors,2,Tue Jun 30 15:27:24 2015 UTC,"Obviously make the most of having Centre Court tickets - they're the most valuable and will provide you with the best tennis by far. Second Thursday is women's semi day so you'll most likely be watching those matches with some other fun invitational doubles thrown in.  When you get a chance or get bored then definitely go exploring, the whole ground is a sight to see with flowers and decor and a lovely atmosphere. By that stage of the tournament then most of Court 3 is not ticketed so you will be able to queue and go in there to mix up the matches that you watch. Be sure to download the Wimbledon App on your phone (presuming you don't have a Nokia 3310) as its great for the order of play and live scores etc.  Also, if you bank with HSBC then you can go and get a free serving of strawberries and cream from underneath Court 1."
tennis,3bmaz9,woodycanuck,2,Wed Jul 1 07:18:06 2015 UTC,"That late in the tournament it's pretty straight forward. I think everything not on Centre will be juniors matches. There might be some Legends Doubles or something, so you can check those out if you get a match you're not interested in watching. Be there 1/2 hour before the gates open and you should be able to get a decent spot for the practice courts (just follow the crowd). Pack a lunch and water, and refill it often.  If you want a cheap souvenir, watch where the players enter one of the outside courts from, and hang out at that exit at the end of the match. Often if you nicely ask a player (just know their name and say please) for their towel, they'll toss it to you :)  You should probably splurge and have the most expensive strawberries of your life, just to say you did it. But it's really the most ridiculous thing."

tennis,3bm7mj,Jones_Crusher,2,Tue Jun 30 17:17:32 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I never liked Tomic until Kyrgios started to matter.
tennis,3bm7mj,DilbertsBeforeSwine,6,Wed Jul 1 06:42:19 2015 UTC,I dunno what he thinks he's accomplishing. I hope they just default his ass if he makes a habit of this.

I really hope for tennis that Kyrgios never becomes a big name on the sport, or changes radically (which is still possible)."

Then we're going to have a 27 year old world number 1 who is a complete baby on court when he doesn't get his way and that's not good for the sport. Age should never be an excuse for poor behavior especially when your 19  years old; you should know how to not act like weenie. This is all just hypothetical and my opinion of course."

tennis,3bm7mj,sizzlingcurry,-3,Tue Jun 30 19:37:50 2015 UTC,"Seems to me you're a ""kid"" too.  Edit : just to be sure we disagree... Being a kid means you totally accept him yelling ""dirty scum""?

tennis,3bm7mj,sizzlingcurry,2,Tue Jun 30 20:01:52 2015 UTC,"Mistakes, exactly, that make him look like an asshole to me. And to many others.  And I wrote that I wouldn't him become a great name in tennis unless he changes his attitude (which I think is possible), because he currently makes mistakes yelling insults, threatening to stop playing which, in my opinion, is not a good example. I'm not a judge, I've been a kid, never been disrespectful to judges, linesmen or other players on court. Never. Call me an exception if you like."
tennis,3bm7mj,xcyu,-2,Tue Jun 30 20:23:43 2015 UTC,"Were you a McEnroe or Connors fan? They were ""brats"" but characters that the sport thrived on. Now they are beloved.   Nick is a transcendent talent, and I love to watch him play. The anger is just a part of the package. I don't really care if he matures or not, he's great to watch.   Who cares what kind of example he sets? Just because he can hit a 130MPH serve doesn't mean he should raise your kids."
tennis,3bm7mj,Mdizzle29,3,Tue Jun 30 21:31:04 2015 UTC,"I loved watching BigMac play, not whine or be disrespectful. Of course, it's ""the same package"" but... am I allowed to like one part of it, and dislike another ? It's the same for Kyrgios : damn, he's got such a good, powerful and entertaining game ! I love it ! I just can't stand him being an asshole, yelling insults and being disrespectful. Of course, he won't raise my kids, but that's not the point.  Point is, to me, tennis has always been more than hitting 130 mph serves, or have wonderful touch and ""soft hands"" : it's also being classy, being graceful whenever you play. Respect is important too, in tennis, as in other sports, to me. It doesn't matter how much talented one is, if one is an asshole, I can't help disliking this part of the ""package"".   I think we all agree that Kyrgios's manners aren't acceptable. The difference is that to some people, it's not a big deal, whereas to me, it is a big deal.  So, could we agree to disagree ?"
tennis,3bm7mj,xcyu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"No problem, variety and different opinions are what makes the world go round. I for one love Federer and the class he shows in almost all situations, which obviously rubbed off on Nadal and Djokovic.   But sometimes I like a little whining in my tennis just to spice things up a bit. Fognini is fun to watch because you never know when he'll melt down completely.   Same with Sir Nick. I love his passion and fire. He's a bit of a brat, but he's fighting for his career and its fun to see the drama sometimes."
tennis,3bm7mj,Mdizzle29,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:32:52 2015 UTC,"To me the difference between Mac/Jimmy is that they were passionate about the sport and the competition.

Sure people talk about his backhand a lot but we've all seen the outcome of only having a backhand(Gasquet). Wawrinka also runs around his backhand a lot, not as much as Sock/Nadal/Federer, but still a lot since forehand is always > backhand especially when both sides are equal.  When people talk about Wawrinka these days its about heavy power shots from both wings and the 1st serve. Not just the backhand."
tennis,3bl7t6,PokeMyPillow,13,Tue Jun 30 03:45:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's also that powerful aggressive forehands are common in the top echelon of tennis.  His backhand is a talking point because there are few outstanding backhands, let alone outstanding 1h backhands."
tennis,3bl7t6,ydna_eissua,3,Tue Jun 30 05:35:44 2015 UTC,I would go as far to say he has one of the best aggressive forehands on tour. It's a huge shot
tennis,3bl7t6,rbace,3,Tue Jun 30 10:15:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely. He wields a sledgehammer from both wings, in fact he hit more forehand winners than backhands winners during the Roland Garros final."

tennis,3boek9,Personacorona,2,Tue Jun 30 21:04:07 2015 UTC,I actually think this is the highest quality tennis I've seen.  Both players were excellent across 4 sets.  Federer had to play specially to win this match.
tennis,3boek9,DilbertsBeforeSwine,2,Wed Jul 1 06:36:01 2015 UTC,Same. It wasn't a classic blockbuster matchup (i.e Djokovic/Nadal Wawrinka/Djokovic Federer/Nadal etc...) but they hit they play insanely well. It's really scary to think that players can play so far out of their skin like Lopez did and still come up short. Federer was pretty scary then.
tennis,3boek9,gurgus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:02:48 2015 UTC,"Federer's 2004-2007 dominance made every other player in that generation (except Nadal on clay) look bad, especially in the record books."
tennis,3boek9,DilbertsBeforeSwine,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:50:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've recently been going back and watching his grand slam finals through that period. I'm just in absolute awe. I really hate declaring X is the best at Y sport, because there are so many factors in determining these things, and I think in a lot of situations it's difficult to make an objective call like that, but Nadal on clay through his wonder years (and who knows, he might have more wonder years in him) and Roger on hard/grass through his wonder years is just brilliant to watch. I wonder how long it will be before we see another dominance like that again. It surely won't be until Roger/Nadal/Djokovic/Murray retire (I included Murray in this list because I'm convinced that if it weren't for the other 3, he'd be the clear #1 player). I really want to see a really young player make another slam final/win a slam."

tennis,3bo85t,drodin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"Prior to 1976, it was even worse.  3 of the 4 Slams were on grass.  Briefly, (76 and 77), the US Open was on clay (green clay) and the French was, of course, on clay.  It would be nice if one of the Slams were played indoors, but it's probably a challenge to have that many indoor courts and reasonable seating (you'd probably need about 14 courts total).  Even that would mean three fast surfaces."
