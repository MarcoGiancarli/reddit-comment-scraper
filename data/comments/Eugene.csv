Eugene,3e14xe,VinceVenom,8,Tue Jul 21 05:27:03 2015 UTC,I live in the Whit on the Wrong Side of the Tracksâ„¢ and I don't mind the horns at all. I think it's kind of a nice sound. They're there for safety. They also tell me when I need to high-tail it in my car and in which direction so I can cross the tracks without getting stuck for 10 minutes. In that sense maybe it's not so safe after all ...

Eugene,3dx1rq,ShelSilverstain,4,Mon Jul 20 12:59:25 2015 UTC,"he was struck by a full-size pickup  it appears that the driver may have had an obscured view when he struck the boy   Guh, my confirmation bias is acting up. Obviously I don't know all the details of the accident, but I'd like to say that I rarely feel safe as a pedestrian around these modern bloat-fest ""full-sized"" trucks. I just don't trust that their drivers can take in enough visual information to safely navigate their 2.5 ton steel bubble in crowded/chaotic environments like busy parking lots.  More confirmation bias obviously, but they also seem to attract aggressive drivers. I'm not saying this was a factor at all, but it certainly contributes to my dislike of being in close proximity to these types of vehicles.  I'm really just venting anxieties here. Hopefully it was an honest accident. I'm sure the driver is feeling more horrible than I care to imagine right now."
Eugene,3dx1rq,B_Provisional,2,Mon Jul 20 17:09:03 2015 UTC,"You sound like you've never spent much time outside of here and places like here. Really, pickups are extremely common in many places. Much of Eugene isn't built to accommodate larger vehicles though."
Eugene,3dx1rq,Micamazing,3,Mon Jul 20 23:05:40 2015 UTC,I avoid west broadway for this very reason.
Eugene,3dx1rq,Floyd91,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"Taller vehicles actually give the driver a better position and view of whats around them. Most ""full-sized"" truck owners are actually very skilled operators and safer than the general car owner.  And, aggressive drivers are also attracted to small sports cars, Motorcycles, SUV's, etc. Idiots drive all sorts of vehicles.  I know you're venting, but you are coming off as narrow minded."
Eugene,3dx1rq,silverbull_it,3,Mon Jul 20 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"Here's a thought experiment: Picture a young child standing an arm's length from the center of an large pickup's front bumper. Now picture the same child standing an arm's length from the front bumper of a typical sedan. Which vehicle offers the better view? Can the truck driver even see the child?   Most ""full-sized"" truck owners are actually very skilled operators and safer than the general car owner   This statement seems to be about as loaded with confirmation bias and anything in my above comment. I personally know individuals who own these types of trucks basically as alpha-male fashion accessories. I have seen absolutely zero evidence that the particular individuals I am acquainted with have better than average driving skills. Sure, plenty of working people essentially need these types of vehicles for their livelihood. It would be stupid to claim otherwise. However, some people just like having big manly trucks. Neither fact has any bearing on the basic logistics at play.   I know you're venting, but you are coming off as narrow minded.    You seem equally entrenched in your views. There is a grieving family up in Junction City, and the two of us arguing about pickups isn't going to help them in any way. So have a nice day and stay safe."
Eugene,3dx1rq,B_Provisional,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah let's not argue.  But, we can agree to disagree.  I just don't think that you painting all ""full sized"" truck drivers as alpha males and inherently aggressive drivers is at all accurate and actually speaks more to what type of people you associate yourself with and your past personal experiences with that type of truck owner.  Granted, there are lots of dip-sh@ts with lifted trucks, the picture of the truck involved in this incident doesn't appear to be like that.     It is difficult to see a small child in front of any car, and the ""obstruction"" involved in this incident was not due to the size of the  truck.  I know the Firefighters who responded to this and the size of the truck had nothing to do with it.   Here is another ""thought experiment"" for you.  Say you are in a crowd of people and there is someone you are trying to find.  Would it be easier to find them if you were up on someones shoulders? You have a better vantage point when you are up higher, and are able to locate/avoid potential hazards smaller vehicles can't.  I'm not ""entrenched"" any view about this, I am actually saying there are bad aggressive drivers with all types of vehicles, even these evil ""full sized"" trucks. I'm simply defending truck drivers, who you are close mindedly stereotyping as ""alpha"" and aggressive Big trucks do serve a functional purpose.  The larger chassis, allow for hauling heavier loads.  Lifted suspension allows for greater ground clearance.  The full sized truck drivers I know are, professionals, who use these trucks for their livelihood. Someone driving an evil full sized truck built your house, farmed the food you eat and if you get injured Firefighters and Paramedics driving ""full sized"" trucks are going to show up.  But, you're right lets not argue, since you already stated you are bias about the subject.  It is futile to argue.  Be safe and watch out for those trucks.  (-;"
Eugene,3dx1rq,silverbull_it,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:14 2015 UTC,I think it is naive to believe that trucks arent marketed and purchased by certain people looking to fulfill their persona. I have been literally run off the road by a 3500 that pulled from the on ramp across three lanes of traffic into the fast lane right into me. Kept matching speed with me preventing me from getting back on the road then flipped me off when i finally passed him. I generally see a lot of big ass trucks with no regard for other vehicles or obstructions. Im not saying all truck drivers are trouble I used to drive a truck myself
Eugene,3dx1rq,antorell0209,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you had that horrible experience.  I totally get that there is a certain truck driving population that fit this ""aggressive alpha male"" stereotype.  But it would be equally naive to say all ""full sized"" truck drivers are like this.  That emotional experience left a certain impression with you and that is how some of you guys seem to perceive other truck drivers.  It would be like saying ""I once got rear ended by a granola eating, socialist, lesbian on her cell phone that drove a Subaru Outback, that must be how all Outback drivers are.""  That would be ridiculous to make that broad of a generalization, right?.  You are saying owning a truck fulfills a persona?  Sure maybe for some, but so does buying a Hookah or a Che Guevara poster.  Bad, aggressive drivers come in every age, gender, race, AND vehicle preference.  C'mon people. :-)"
Eugene,3dx1rq,silverbull_it,3,Tue Jul 21 01:40:17 2015 UTC,"Most ""full-sized"" truck owners are actually very skilled operators and safer than the general car owner.   If there's any actual data to back this up, I'd love to see it (seriously). That said, I don't have much respect for the safety decisions of anyone that doesn't realize how dangerous it is to move their bumpers up to the eye-level of most drivers. My sister was nearly killed when a lifted truck ran a stop sign and t-boned her. If the bumper had been down at the stock position, it would have just dented her door rather than smacking her right in the head.   I realize that some people have a legitimate reason for lifting their trucks, but most who do it are just going for a cosmetic change at the expense of safety. It would surprise me if these same people happened to be safer in every other area of driving."

Eugene,3dx1rq,etherbunnies,3,Tue Jul 21 22:47:35 2015 UTC,"Eye level, eh? It seems like you and B_Provisional have a very specific type of truck and driver in mind.  The truck involved in this incident isn't a jacked up monster truck.  I think you guys don't know what ""full-size"" truck means.    I'm also interested if there is any empirical data about this situation.  My statement is admittedly based on my own personal experience and observations."
Eugene,3dx1rq,silverbull_it,3,Mon Jul 20 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but you did seem to be saying that higher is better, so I made an assumption. Apologies if that was not accurate. I own an F250, so I do know what a full-size truck is, but I don't really consider it all that high off the ground."
Eugene,3dx1rq,DrKronin,3,Mon Jul 20 22:50:56 2015 UTC,"It's all good, bottom line, this was a terrible accident and I feel horrible for all involved."
Eugene,3dx1rq,silverbull_it,3,Mon Jul 20 23:04:50 2015 UTC,I disagree completely - I've driven my buddy's Dodge 1500 and I can't see anything shorter than 4 1/2 feet if it's in front of the bumper or behind the tailgate.

Eugene,3dvq6u,TheVonski,3,Sun Jul 19 23:58:26 2015 UTC,"Since the article brought it up, I wish the MUPTE produced condos for downtown instead of a bunch of apartments. Everywhere I look there are new apartments but I'm hard pressed to find new condo development anywhere.  Those apartments on broadway across the street from Sizzle Pie would have been better done as condos. The apartments nearby the Safeway on Pearl would have been better done as condos.   Additionally, since these developments are getting breaks on taxes they should have enforced a cap on the rental rates. With a lot of the new apartments you are basically paying $250k mortgage rates in rental fees. I'd love to see a city wide rental control / stabilization ordinance anyway. Rental rates are getting out of hand.  Also while we are on the subject I think a lot of the MUPTE development has been piss poor hack jobs.

I guess it worked out in the end for them as I've been recommending them to people for 20 years.  ETA: I remember when a coworker's father died suddenly they helped find homes for his koi (many of which were over 40 years old) and I believe assisted in transporting them to their new ponds."

Since all the college kids are moving out right now, it's likely someone abandoned them assuming someone would find them, it happened to me with an old room mate (luckily we found homes for them), but some people just don't realize it's a 10+ year commitment, not a novelty belonging. You should do this as quickly as possible though, there have been some cats being poisoned with antifreeze around town, it happened to one of my sister's cats & the vet told her about it when he was being put to sleep."

Some I just became friends with and others became intimate and have moved to platonic. My first girlfriend there is still one of my best friends. So don't listen to these nay sayers about it not working.  Also, meetup worked really well. I joined a board game group and a D&D group that both met weekly. We had a ton of fun and I made great friends with many of them.  I also stopped saying no and worked on being less wishy washy when being invited somewhere. For the most part. If it seemed safe and sane, I said yes and went. This helped solidify those relationships I was developing at all the public events.  I also work in a building with a ton of people. I'm not saying date or don't date co-workers, but going out with them (even the meh ones) can lead to meeting their friends who may be 8000 times more awesome. This has also worked well for me.   Anyway, best of luck =)"

When I went out to try and meet someone I'd usually try to bring a friend to stay entertained and have the ability to escape. I met one of my greatest friends by chatting him up at The Granary.  Places to not go:   Downtown, especially on the weekends. Meeting people during that craziness will bring only craziness. Campus. Most students already  have an active social life and aren't looking to branch out as much.   Places to go to:   Local shows at bars/cafes. Depending on what music you're into it's already a plus. Metal? Wandering Goat. Funk/Jam? Granary. Hippy Jam Bands? Luckey's. Punk Rock or Metal? Old Nicks. Horsehead has a great daytime atmosphere, OK food, and the patrons are usually friendly and regulars. Cafes. Start frequenting cafes. You'll be more likely to make friends if you have a favorite spot and go there a lot. If people start to recognize you it's easier to be friendly. I've met so many people through Wandering Goat, Barn Light, and Cafe Vero.   Good luck!"

Eugene,3dlplm,punsohard,7,Fri Jul 17 07:52:22 2015 UTC,The tap water is amazing.
Eugene,3dlplm,shadjack10,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:21 2015 UTC,Very true.
Eugene,3dlplm,oohcarrots,3,Sat Jul 18 01:55:48 2015 UTC,You should know this subreddit has a sidebar that will tell you more than you probably want to know.
Eugene,3dlplm,Moarbrains,3,Fri Jul 17 08:03:28 2015 UTC,"Damn, you're right."
Eugene,3dlplm,smashes2ashes,3,Fri Jul 17 08:52:40 2015 UTC,"What's your living/income situation looking like?   Unless you're pretty well off, try to avoid any place that calls itself ""Student housing"". Not only are all of them ridiculously overpriced but your only neighbors will be college kids who haven't grasped the concepts of courtesy or quiet hours."
Eugene,3dlplm,mimrm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:45:57 2015 UTC,Unless it is official UO Student Housing - that's a much better price.
Eugene,3dlplm,smashes2ashes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:57:40 2015 UTC,Better price but you still have unsupervised children as your neighbors.
Eugene,3dlplm,spellitcorrectly,2,Mon Jul 20 06:42:51 2015 UTC,Shameless promotion: the UO has a cricket team. It's a great group of people.   Where you from in India?
Eugene,3dlplm,spellitcorrectly,2,Fri Jul 17 14:38:22 2015 UTC,I'm from Delhi but living in Gujarat. I know about the cricket team but I'm wondering how come they don't have a men's soccer team??
Eugene,3dlplm,MonopolyJr11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:16 2015 UTC,There's a men's club soccer team.   We probably don't have a men's Division level soccer club because of Title IX which simply put says you have to have equality between women and men's sports and other things at schools that receive tax money.   The UO spends a huge amount of money on football therefore they have many more women's sports to equal the cost of football.
Eugene,3dlplm,spellitcorrectly,2,Fri Jul 17 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"Fyi, it's not about the spend, it's about ratio or equality of men's athletes to womens. So football has a roster of 65 or what not, it takes volleyball, soccer, and acro (or whatever mix) just to equal the roster of male athletes."
Eugene,3dlplm,spellitcorrectly,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"Really? I always thought it was about the money ratio and not the participation ratio.  But after reading Wikipedia and the Three-Part Test, you are indeed correct.   All such assistance should be available on a substantially proportional basis to the number of male and female participants in the institution's athletic program.   It never made sense to me why the UO got rid of the wrestling program (like what 8ish years ago?). They could have added another women's sport but realistically it was probably more political than anything (I think the athletic director was Kilkenny at the time and he was an asshole)."
Eugene,3dlplm,laffnlemming,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"I hear the current athletic director, Rob Mullens, has been doing a great job and that he presided over a great sporting era for the UofOregon. Is this true?"
Eugene,3dlplm,fivemanycooks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:13:53 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, I've kind of stopped following what's going on behind the scenes. Makes me too mad for various reasons.   Rob Mullens good be a totally great guy, I just don't know."
Eugene,3digbz,Kharmaticlism,3,Thu Jul 16 15:12:00 2015 UTC,"What's a ""side"" bar? Is that a special bar that only mods can see? Do they allow normal people inside? What kind of alcohol do they serve there?  I won't be there this week.  EDIT: I just noticed that it's a ""fucking"" side bar too. ;)"

Factors: /u/etherbunnies and I might be taking a long hike on Saturday, so we might want to save our legs for that. Also, I have a blood blister on my toe that I got from running down the Butte yesterday so I'll have to see what's going on with that."

Eugene,3digbz,floranfaunaa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:23:19 2015 UTC,It is! With leashes. I'll be bringing my boy along too.
