Android,3e2ax5,mattsatwork,62,Tue Jul 21 12:18:25 2015 UTC,"A very well written article exploring the many issues of Qualcomm.  Honestly though, (unfortunate for those about to lose jobs), splitting the company is almost the best for the industry. Qualcomm was a giant in the market and they were unmatched for the most part. Now with easier licensing for the modems and circuitry we may see more devices shipping with X - SOC and a Qualcomm sourced Modem."
Android,3e2ax5,altimax98,12,Tue Jul 21 13:10:45 2015 UTC,Isn't the S6 shipped this way in some markets?
Android,3e2ax5,DrTeacup,9,Tue Jul 21 15:16:35 2015 UTC,"I believe so, I think the GSM models ship with the Shannon modem and the CDMA variants have a Qualcomm modem"
Android,3e2ax5,altimax98,8,Tue Jul 21 15:21:16 2015 UTC,"I guess when you have orders for tens of millions of modems, they just can't say no just because you did not buy their SoCs too."
Android,3e2ax5,DrTeacup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:53 2015 UTC,They can't say no. They even give discounts to Samsung to use their processors. Even tried to court them by offering to use their foundry.
Android,3e2ax5,krohmium,18,Tue Jul 21 18:37:33 2015 UTC,CDMA is a proprietary technology from Qualcomm so this makes sense.
Android,3e2ax5,jwyche008,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:15 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that over the years they have lost a lot of the CDMA licensing/royalties, but I don't have any numbers to back that up..."
Android,3e2ax5,brintoul,32,Tue Jul 21 18:16:58 2015 UTC,Samsung uses Exynos (they're own SoC) in some international variants of their devices lately.
Android,3e2ax5,KaineCloaked,33,Tue Jul 21 15:22:09 2015 UTC,"They use exynos SoC on all SGS6 variants. They use their own modems only in some variants. Apparently, qualcomm has better CDMA modems."
Android,3e2ax5,DrTeacup,8,Tue Jul 21 15:35:17 2015 UTC,"Qualcomm has better modems all around, period.  Additionally, Samsung can't produce some of the necessary technology/band combinations used in the US, so they are forced to use Qualcomm radios in that case because they have no choice.  In the rest of the world the S6 uses Samsung modems, and there are lots and lots of problems that are not present on Qualcomm chipsets.  Source: I work in the field, operators haven't stopped reporting problems with the S6 since it was released."
Android,3e2ax5,VMX,7,Tue Jul 21 16:37:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Samsung SLSI now designs them inhouse or still simply licences design from CEVA, who also supplies design to intel, speadtrum, mediatek and broadcom. I think CEVA baseband designs are your only option if qualcomm won't licence. If it is infact a CEVA design in the SGS6, samsung might just have been stuck between a rock and a hard place. Perhaps it just isn't cost effective to come up with design themselves due to all the patents involved."
Android,3e2ax5,DrTeacup,7,Tue Jul 21 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"This guy knows what he's talking about. Also, Samsung modems tend to be 1 year behind Qualcomm modems in LTE features and capabilities."
Android,3e2ax5,mrafcho001,28,Tue Jul 21 17:27:12 2015 UTC,"Correct, and same for other non-Qualcomm vendors.  Which is the reason why Qualcomm keeps winning most RFQ's whenever operatores and handset manufacturers hold one.  The temperature ""issue"" of SD810 is only relevant to the usual pack of nerds on the Internet, but it will not make any difference to Qualcomm business.  What's more... I think it's very likely that the S7 sports a Qualcomm chipset again given all the issues Samsung is having with the Exynos."

Android,3dzxys,kenundrem,217,Mon Jul 20 23:06:59 2015 UTC,An oversight?  In a Google app?  I'm shocked!
Android,3dzxys,LaceratedCantaloupe,34,Tue Jul 21 01:41:49 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that Google as a whole suffers from a huge fragmentation problem.  Their developers are far too disconnected from their marketing and release goals.    I'm sure the developers' goals for this were something like ""- Switch backend from Google+ Platform to new Photos API"" and they nailed it, hands down.  And some other team had ""- Use Photos API to make a better Photos app.""  One team finished, and the other team was like, ""Cool, we did it guys, hi-five!"" ""Wait, what?  You said 'new', not 'maintain existing features from some other part of another project.'"""
Android,3dzxys,ew73,7,Tue Jul 21 05:41:51 2015 UTC,"And disconnected from each other. It's like there's no product roadmap that makes sense. They'll push out an idea only to have it duplicated or inconsistent with their other products (think Picasa>Google+>Photos). I'm still not sure what a +1 button actually does and I can't seem to figure out how Contacts in Hangouts marries with Contacts in Gmail/Google+. I understand some of this is complicated by the myriad of additional tools carriers provide (Hangouts does bring contacts over from my HTC contacts app, for example), but there doesn't seem to be a vision for ""Google"".  Perhaps I'm obtuse, but it's a company with smart engineers and good designers that make good apps, but no vision to make them a unified ecosystem. Compare this to apple, which has a unified ecosystem (music, photos, storage, email, tv all synced across PCs, phones and set top device) but some pretty poor apps (I'm looking at you, iTunes)."
Android,3dzxys,letsgocrazy,13,Tue Jul 21 15:10:38 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue, I think, is the fucking manufacturers sticking their own shitty additions to android, and the carriers doing the same.   They both conspire to make it impossible to root your phone, yet they drag their feet with updates to the software.   Once they've released a phone they're more interested in marketing the next one, rather than making sure the one they've just released doesn't descend into a pit of lag.   I've just got a new s5 replaced on insurance - a slightly different model with upgraded specs.   Except it has lollipop 5.02 which is a pile of shit.   I can't get a new rom because all the rom makers have moved on and already made roms for the popular model.   So I have to wait for Samsung to fix the issue. Which they are doing, but God knows how long that will take.   Then of course when that is done I have to wait for EE to stick their fucking oar in and fiddle with the Rom.   And I wonder how quickly they'll jump on that? How many resources they'll allocate to get that done in a timely manner?   This phone manufacturer / carrier thing is choking Android.   Google are fools for not putting their foot down about this.   ""get a Nexus""  Fuck off. It's much easier to get a phone through your carrier, I wanted a waterproof phone, and I didn't know it was going to be this much of a nightmare to fix.   I'm losing faith in Android steadily."
Android,3dzxys,ew73,5,Tue Jul 21 08:44:25 2015 UTC,"Google has done a lot towards ensuring Android is a lot more modular than it used to be, as evidenced by almost all the ""good"" parts of a stock ROM ending up as apps on the Marketplace.  The Launcher, Clock, Photos, etc. etc. etc. -- all of what used to be a major draw for a AOSP build are available as apps.    That said:  Yeah, carriers need to go away.  That said, I previously had a S3, and upgraded to the Nexus 5 that first day (I'd dropped my S3 in the toilet like a week prior and was using an old HTC in the interim, so I was in the market..).  Recently, I upgraded to an S6.    I somewhat regret that decision.  The S6 is a nice piece of harwdare, but Samsung's ROMs are just terrible.    ""Get a Nexus"" sounds like tounge-in-cheek advice, but in my experience, those phones are beyond awesome.  If nothing else, next time you're in the market for a phone, try the Nexus line.  In fact, the Nexus 6 is available through most carriers (in the US) now, so that's not really an excuse."
Android,3dzxys,noeyescansee,127,Tue Jul 21 08:59:10 2015 UTC,"The ""get a Nexus"" argument is such bullshit. Sure, the software is way better, but there has yet to be a Nexus device that doesn't lag behind on hardware, especially cameras. The Nexus 6 almost has a good camera, but it's not at the level of effortlessness that the S6 and iPhone 6 currently are.  Android users shouldn't have to choose between good specs and a good software experience. If only there were an S6 GPE, all of Android's problems would be solved. For now, though, I think the S6 is probably the closest you can get. The hardware is fantastic and the software is better than on past Galaxy devices. Despite a few quirks, I've found it to be a great phone."

If they coded it right the first time, it shouldn't take much to literally copy and paste the CC-related code from the Google+ app to the new Photos app and refactor as necessary.    But something tells me the Google+ app must've had a shitty codebase if they couldn't just take the CC-related code and put it in the Photos app to do the exact same thing as before.    EDIT: It irritates me so much how Google has been recently treating some of their Android apps (compared to their iOS counterparts).

It might make sense to move to a more moderate position, where Google+ still exists but everything doesn't revolve around it. Photos could be their own thing, but with Google+ integration.

On the other hand I have not opened my youtube account and think ""Hey, It would be cool to have it attached to my social network account with my real name on it"". Or my Picasa Account. Or I did not leave anonymous feedback to a local store in 2009 just so that Google would later attach my real name and Plus account where the owner can click on my review and learn about my work, where I study, look at the photos I took..etc. Same goes for the random youtuber. I know about the privacy settings but for a year I had no idea my Plus account was there exposing all my Picasa pics, reviews...etc since I never ever logged into Plus after I was forced to turn on the account for something I forgot now (I think they force you to have a Plus account if you want to use Hangouts now)  I don't think what I am talking about is incomprehensible. I was Ok with having a google handle to use their services, but I didn't want my social network to be attached to it and be easily accessible. Still, lesson learned and I am trying to use separate services for my separate needs, or at least have separate accounts when I am on the same platform. I stopped using Picasa after it was connected to Plus. I uninstalled Chrome. There is nothing that could replace youtube for me, so I opened a separate account for it. I am trying to switch to a different mail service nowadays. I use Yandex for maps in the country I live. I don't use Hangouts at all anymore (there a few people I used to chat and I only used Hangouts/Google Chat for it, not anymore. Thank God for Whatsapp and Viber). I am having doubts about Android as well, I will switch to an open source/platform competitor once they become usable (I wish MeeGo was still around. I can't now switch to iOS or Windows Phone, they are more of the same and don't like them much).

In most situations, if you have the time/resources to rebuild something from the ground up you can use newer technology (which will allow for more longevity as it will be more compatible with technology in 4 years) and you can redo all the little things that you did poorly in the initial build.  So instead of moving a nice 20 year old house to a new lot, they're building a brand new house from the ground up in the new lot. It might not have a basketball hoop and a second garage yet, but the house itself is more modern and better, and hopefully those things will be build in with new technology soon.

Now it's all in date order and mixes NSFW with family photos and other things, albums aren't alphabetical order, last upload instead.  Just a friggin mess.  I left because of this and went to Flickr same but different. Still haven't found a good replacement yet.

My company was looking at leveraging Chrome's app store for our new product, but with the way Google makes policy changes with Chrome, we've decided to just package it in Electron and handle distribution ourselves.  We're developing a voice application and rules about microphone permission and forced encryption have changed without much warning which caused headaches during development.  Chrome auto-updates and our app is suddenly broken.  We've had issues with scripting features suddenly breaking in Google Sheets too."

It's an interesting platform and one that I think has a lot of potential, but we can't offer a product on a platform where the rules are constantly changing and could eventually end up with our app being completely broken.  There was another thing that bit us when they blocked ""eval"" statements from Chrome apps.  This broke a SIP library we were using and we had to fork it and re-write it to work within these new restrictions.  It's too much risk to take on for our product (it's call center related so our app suddenly breaking is unacceptable)."

From my experience, there are two ways that the back key works, and it all depends on how you open the app:   When you open the app by tapping on the persistent notification, it opens the app at the currently-playing podcast.  If you back out of this screen, it exits the app because this was the ""opening screen"" for this session of the app.   If you open the app up from the app drawer, it'll open up at your home screen (mine is set to podcasts).  Then if you enter a podcast list and back out of it, it'll go back to your home screen.   I believe it should always act as #2, but that's just my opinion."

Android,3e1gn7,MrSnugglebuns,8,Tue Jul 21 15:27:25 2015 UTC,I tried slide but didn't like it. It would be cool if videos/more pictures opened in the app. Scrolling for some reason isn't smooth and I get force closes every once in a while.
Android,3e1gn7,ctnp,71,Tue Jul 21 18:13:38 2015 UTC,Relay for Reddit is great. It was formally Reddit News and has a really nice Material Design look. Pretty customizable too and has the best looking and most usable night mode as well.

I will say that for some reason, on Samsung Devices, the full list of items never populates, but on all my nexus devices, and all other non-samsung devices, it works fine.

It's awesome if you don't run into any issues, but even for simplest billing inquiries prepare to spend a long time on the phone with clueless ""level one"" cs reps that couldn't deviate from the script even if their life depended on it.  Also for whatever reason my wife's Google Voice number refused to properly ring through to the Cricket line.  The other Wi-Fi only backup phone rings through Hangouts for good 30 seconds before the Cricket one starts.  No such problems on Straight Talk.  I don't know whether it's Cricket or Google issue and frankly don't care.  From a customer perspective, GV is broken on Cricket."
Android,3e0w8z,Chahk,0,Tue Jul 21 13:22:20 2015 UTC,"I've been on Cricket for about a year and a half now (pretty much right after the Aio/Cricket merger), and have never had an issue with their customer service. I've been in contact with them three times, first because my number port from Straight Talk got FUBAR'd (ST's fault, not Cricket's). I ended up just signing on with a new number instead of porting, but they did everything they could to fix it, including a rep I spoke to in person at one of their corporate stores calling me on her day off to help resolve the issue. The other two times were simple account/billing questions and fixes, neither of which took more than 5 minutes on the phone.   Can't speak to GV issues though, I do have a GV account, but I don't use it as a primary number."
Android,3e0w8z,spilurum,0,Tue Jul 21 14:58:36 2015 UTC,"Consider yourself lucky. A seemingly simple billing matter had me on the phone with their support for over 2 hours without any resolution, and even less so in their brick-and-mortar store.  I ordered the activation kit online, but never received it. Mail getting lost happens all the time, but it looks like Cricket is in no way prepared for this situation.  They could not for the life of it figure out how to handle this.  They refused to send me a new kit, because their system wouldn't allow them to deactivate the first one.  They had me go to one of their stores nearby, where I shelled out $25 for a new SIM.  But even then they could not activate it on the account and credit the first month's charge that I already paid.  In the end I had to call my credit card and dispute the charge, but I was still out $25 for that SIM card that they couldn't activate, and now won't take back.  Google Voice issue is a real problem for me though, because my wife and I use our GV numbers as primary means of contact.  Calls not going through is simply unacceptable."

I even called the store manager to commend his employees, which is the first time I ever felt compelled to do something like that.  Whenever I recommend Cricket to someone today I always tell them to make the trip to a corporate store if they need to. The contract stores are only useful for dropping off your bill payment."
Android,3e0w8z,spilurum,6,Tue Jul 21 16:04:58 2015 UTC,You can also Verizon ST too. Though your data speeds are throttled to 5MB/s down and 2 up roughly. 4G though.
Android,3e0w8z,Sardiz,2,Tue Jul 21 07:03:54 2015 UTC,nerd here! I have tested all four carriers and the connection speeds are as follows: fastest to slowest T-Mobile AT&T Verizon Sprint  T-Mobile is a surprise because while they may not have the best coverage of the four they have the newest towers and hence the fastest speeds.  AT&T is not far behind with only slightly slower speeds  Verizon was significantly slower and sprint was extremely slow!  another report I found on the internet for anyone interested in someone else experience: here
Android,3e0w8z,s0urc3_d3v3l0pm3nt,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:29 2015 UTC,"This might be true where you are, but signal and connection speeds vary so much across the country that it's impossible to make absolute claims like you have.  In fact, Sprint is the fastest network in a handful of major markets while T-Mobile is the slowest.  That CNET article is a year old. Networks can change drastically in a year so it's tough to take their results as fact. It's also CNET, so it's tough to take that article seriously."
Android,3e0w8z,tanmaker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:10 2015 UTC,"So I used sprint towers with my straight talk phone a few years ago. When I moved to a mountainous college town I couldn't get a solid signal without driving a few miles down the hill. I was forced to get verizon, and I'm locked into it for another year overpaying for a bloatware phone and nervously checking my data usage every 10 seconds. Are ATT towers any better? I assume Tmobile towers are (sadly) worse."
Android,3e0w8z,SaladWithHotDogsInIt,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:21 2015 UTC,"No wifi calling on that plan. That combined with T-mobile's coverage meant that I had to switch. If you don't have to make many calls, it may be worth it."

My N5 fits in both of these, but can be annoyingly large in the jeans sometimes ... the N6 would be too big.  Secondly, the N5 is too large for one handed operation in some cases.

Only time I ever get annoyed is if I'm sitting at my desk for hours...but then I feel the same way about my keys or wallet...so I don't hold that against the phone necessarily.  I'm a fairly big guy, so the one handed use is rarely a major problem for me and is usually trumped by the massive improvement in media consumption (youtube/reddit/etc) to worry too much. But I totally get that it'd be too big for some people. After going to the note 2 back in the day, its been damn near impossible for me to enjoy any phone with a screen smaller than 5.5 inches.  I gotta think I'm the majority at this point though, considering if the market truly didn't want larger phones, they wouldn't be selling like they are. The only phone that managed to push ~4 inches to major sales recently was the iPhone...and even its jumped to the bigger sizes due to the market changing.

Android,3e0w8z,formerdigguser,6,Tue Jul 21 10:53:44 2015 UTC,"My own comments on top of this review as a Fi user:   Seamless WiFi only applies to calls, so it's not surprising he had issues with app updates when he switched over. No big deal like he said. Apps getting imported from your old phone will happen with any new Android phone, it's not something specific to the N6. The author doesn't seem to realize you can load as many ringtones or notifications sounds as you want onto your phone from your PC or the internet. There are phone apps that automate the process as well. [Edit: Of course the hard part is finding good ones!] I haven't had issues telling which way my phone is up. Typically when I pull it out of my pocket I can feel if I'm grabbing the camera end or the correct end (correct as in that's how I put it in my pocket in the first place). I haven't had issues fitting my Nexus 6 into my pockets. It is a big phone though. And it doesn't fit into my coin pocket like my GNex did. :) Early adopters will get a Welcome Kit as thanks for joining Fi early. It includes earbuds, an external battery, a phone case, and neat packaging you won't want to throw away. AFAIK it's still available for new Fi subscribers. I didn't get mine though and had to prod support to send mine out (somehow I fell through the cracks). They overnighted it to me which was above and beyond what they had to do as far as I'm concerned. Only had one instance with no data service, and that was a single time in the black hole that is my office where I frequently dropped to 2G/no data with Ting/Sprint. A marked improvement, though I understand Ting also does T-Mobile now and I didn't use my Nexus 6 with them so I can't do a proper comparison there since I assume my GNex couldn't leverage T-Mobile networks. I had an issue signing up initially. When you order your SIM card or Nexus 6 you're given the open to prefill a form to help speed along the number porting when you get your card/phone. I filled mine out, and Chrome autofilled it, but filled in the ZIP code with a 9 digit format ZIP. The website accepts it, but I suspect the system internally cannot handle 9 digit ZIPs, as later on I had issues where Fi was telling me the number port was declined, but it turned out Fi was never actually sending a request for it. When I completely reset the process I put in a normal 5 digit ZIP this time it went through, so the ZIP is my only guess as to what was fouling up the works. Just something to keep an eye on when you fill out that form."

If you find a good file to load onto your phone outside of apps like that, well first your phone needs to support the format, or you need to convert the file into a supported format. MP3 should be fine as-is so you don't need to worry about that.  Then you connect your phone to your PC and open the phone in your file browser. (I understand Macs may need to download a program from Google as an intermediate step.) Then you can see Notifications and Ringtones folders; your sound files can go into one of those and they will appear in the list when you go to select a ringtone or notification sound.  For app-specific sounds many apps allow for setting custom sounds for only them. There are apps which allow you to customize this for ANY app but I haven't tried them. Here is an article that appeared high on the Google search results that might be useful: http://lifehacker.com/megasound-lets-you-set-custom-notification-sounds-for-e-1520294226 You can of course do your own searching to look for more choices."

Android,3e0w8z,Lowganm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:03:32 2015 UTC,"So, I work for a large cell phone company (retail, ASM.) After Applying my employee discount for the service (we don't get discounts on the phones), my total comes out to about $35 a month for unlimited talk, text, and data.   However, that's without the cost of a phone. If i bring my current device (my Nexus 5), I'll get charged an additional $15-$25 a month for an access charge. If I get a phone through one of our several setups, I'll instead pay the price of the setup ($20 a month for the S6, for example) and not pay an access charge. So, all in all, I'd be paying about $60 a month after taxes. Which isn't bad.  But I also need to get my fiance a phone, and she's not eligible for my discount. That same setup that I have will cost her about $100 a month, after taxes. (And our protection plan, which is a MUST for her.) So, about $160 or so a month.   My company $160 * 24 months = $3840.  Google Fi  (2 Nexus 6 devices = $1057.88)  $60 * 24 months = $1440.  $1440 + $1057.88 =  $2497.88  It's an estimation, granted, but neither of us use data much at all, so we  would be paying less than the $60. It makes sense to me....but I don't know. I don't have the money to drop over a thousand Gil for the devices (and I don't have credit at all), so it seems like a really pricy purchase. But I would save money in the end.   I just wish there were more phones that supported the network. I know why there aren't, but I'm hoping they announce a Nexus 5 2015 with Fi support."

Re: the deli counter - here's a clear trade-off. We always allowed 24 hours to claim and another 24 hours to buy. In the analogy, that's like allowing you 24 hours to get back to the counter, and once you're at the counter you can do all your shopping for 24 hours. The trade-off, of course, is that for a hypothetical 100 items in stock, you send out - say - 100 invites. If the first 100 people are unresponsive or not interested, that means the next 100 are going to wait for 24 hours before their turn. Make it a week, and people have to wait for a week."

Android,3e1i0x,gumbald,2,Tue Jul 21 06:59:36 2015 UTC,"The invite system is grossly stupid. It's simpler to just do a FIFO pre-order system where products are shipped based on the chronological order of the POs received (older POs get fulfilled first, newer POs have to wait until the ones before them are fulfilled). You snooze, you lose.  An ordering system where products are shipped based on arbritary distinctions (e.g. US customers get theirs months before anyone else) is more likely to piss people off. Worse when it's tied to a bogus day-one 5-star Amazon review campaign.  As for Google, their ordering system is a basketcase. They're just being incompetent there: they had tons of servers to handle the traffic, but they suck horribly as far as inventory management were concerned."

Android,3e1i0x,Isogen_,4,Tue Jul 21 15:54:07 2015 UTC,"I might get down-voted into oblivion for this as well, but I agree with you. Given OnePlus's small scale of production, they're controlling the demand for their product to ease production, so that they only produce what they can definitely sell. It's understandable to me, at least.   The company can't afford to stock up on inventory of un-sold phones that they overproduced, or lose out on more and more pre-orders that they couldn't fulfill. Yes, I realize the invite system drove away customers as well, but it still gives them a much more optimal and predictable level of production to work with that helps them achieve the minimum profit loss (or at least I would assume so). I would much rather wait for an invite that guarantees me a phone than wait until my order gets fulfilled off of a preorder.  They really do need to fix their gimmicky marketing campaigns though. I'm not a fan of those in the slightest."

Android,3e1i0x,somewhatokay,3,Tue Jul 21 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"Well, like I said in my post, a normal preorder system still runs risk of losing out on profit. If the company gets preorders for something like 2 million units within the first week, then it has to produce that amount. But for the time that it takes to get to that production number, some people maybe have pulled orders out more than the amount of new people putting orders in, or the oceans of preorders may keep coming in that OP can't fulfill given their production line. When the One was being made, OP also ran into a few issues with certifications that forced them to reprint the backing of the phone; a change that would probably be easier on a fixed production level rather in the midst of trying to fulfill and change preorders.  But, if they use an invite system, they control the amount demanded, in turn controlling production. They can make exactly however many devices this week and however many the next, based on the invites given out that week, which leads to a more stable production run.   My logic's just based on a traditional preorder system. Someone above posted something about a different preorder system that sounds reasonable as well that OP could definitely implement, but it's just my 2 cents."
Android,3e1i0x,eunjis_skyline,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:35 2015 UTC,Then the invite system is a horrible way of controlling inventory. A pre-order system would be able to control inventory efficiently and you'll know exactly where you stand on your order.
Android,3e1i0x,ger_brian,9,Tue Jul 21 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"How so? A pre-order system just allows people to put in their order before the product is officially ready for distribution and the manufacturer is obligated to fulfill those orders when they have the stock. But the demand for the product is still fluctuating because anyone can put in an order or cancel their order as they please, which means that the adequate production level that OP needs would likely be changing as well, and there would still be sizable risk of exceeding or under-meeting demand (most likely the second one because a lot more people would put in pre-orders rather than fight for invites). It takes a lot of operations + supply chain logistics that I'm not sure OP has to figure out that out, and it's more difficult given that OP sells direct to consumer.  EDIT: Actually, a pre-order method that OP could do is open up an allotted time window for pre-orders (like 2 months or something), where they can judge demand that way. I don't like the invite system, but I just think it makes a bit of sense."
Android,3e1i0x,ger_brian,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:46 2015 UTC,I agree. Why not make a preorder system where everyone can order the phone whenever they want and it get's shipped whenever it's ready. Thats way more fair than making people beg for invites.
Android,3e1i0x,ger_brian,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:54:47 2015 UTC,"Well. I know invites aren't a great experience, but at least that way you're not sitting there out of pocket for a phone that might ship. Also, there's more sides to the fairness point - arguably, with invites, we get the phones to the people who care the most. Not necessarily those who beg the most - last year, we made sure to get them to early supporters, people who cared enough to spread the message on social media etc. The people who signed up for our forums in December 2013 are definitely not going to agree that pre-orders is more fair."
Android,3e1i0x,WickieWikinger,4,Tue Jul 21 12:08:40 2015 UTC,"You have proven with the OPO that your phone ships, so most people interested in the phone will believe you. On top of that, I would expect you to only charge me when you ship it, not when I order, that's how pre-orders are usually handled. And yes, a pre order system is more fair. If you think there are some people who didn't pre-order early but still deserve your phone because they were spreading the message, you can give them some additional units outside of the normal queue."
Android,3e1i0x,tru3gam3r,8,Tue Jul 21 12:40:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, I see. Problem is, if you don't charge people they'll most of the time not actually buy when the time comes (like, an overwhelming number).

Android,3e1i0x,ger_brian,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"It's not about loosing faith. If everyone signs up for a pre order, Oneplus will start ramping up manufacturing to produce all of the needed phones. This will take awhile and people will likely start canceling preorders. Now Oneplus is fucked because they spent a lot of money ramping up production and producing phones just so that they can shut it down right away.  It's far less risky to control supply by ramping up production on your own. This is why they have an invite system. It allows them to not lose a lot of money by overproducing. This is smart as a relatively new company and allows them to not bankrupt themselves.   This is the same reason that a lot of kickstarter projects fail, production costs in high volumes are expensive especially when it needs to happen very quickly. However, they could get away with it by increasing the cost of the phone to factor in these increased manufacturing costs, but I garuantee just as many people would be complaining about a more expensive smartphone. It may suck for people that really want to buy their product, but they are being smart in assessing their risks. Give them time."

When Apple released the OG 15"" rMBP, the shipping estimates started off at ""ships 1-2 days"". My order went in about 4 hours after the pre-orders opened up, and the estimates had already slipped to ""2-3 weeks"". A day later, those estimates hit ""4-6 weeks"". The special order config (Ultimate) added another 1-2 weeks on top of that.  FIFO makes sense for inventory management, accounting, and order fulfillment.

Android,3e1i0x,Onionsteak,4,Tue Jul 21 14:27:01 2015 UTC,"It's funny, the problem here is reduced supply and high demand. The solution to that problem is simple: increase the price.  Doing that of course reduces demand with the bonus of making more $ per unit. But, OnePlus of course wants to keep the price low as that is a key part of the appeal/demand.  Here's what I would do if I were them:   Announce target price floor of $400 (or whatever). Announce early adopter release for, say, $650 or something high enough to ensure supply is enough and no invites would be required. Announce that we will slowly lower the price down to the eventual floor over time based on available supply/demand. Special announcements and most likely lots of free publicity from the blogs/reddit each day as the price drops! Eventually we reach the price ""floor"" and we're done, supply at that price can now meet demand.   The invite system is designed to sort of handle that in an artificial way. Sure, this caters to people with more money willing to spend more by allowing them to get the phone first, but realistically with short supply this is the practical way of eliminating the need for invites and would be interesting to monitor.  A key point here is the pricing drop process would a public part of the whole promotion, not just a typical ""lower the price over  time"" scenerio or have sales now and then that most devices naturally go through."

To add to my earlier post: Buying unlocked devices in Canada sucks in general, we have very little in choices, and places to shop from. We generally end up having to shop across the border, so if I want to order a phone online, I pay for the phone, shipping, taxes, not to mention the weaker CAD means the $200 usd phone is now $260 cad.

Android,3e2vz6,_____DEADFOOL____,7,Tue Jul 21 15:33:00 2015 UTC,"is this because of lenovo??   From what I have heard(a Verizon engineer said this), is that Motorola is/was lacking the funds to get their updates certified. This could have have been why we were seeing so many sales for their products this Summer  Which kind of makes sense because I would think that Google was eager to hand them all the money they needed to get updates out but Lenovo wouldn't be doing that. So you could say that it is Lenovo's fault but if Motorola isn't producing the proper amount of funds to get up dates out then I personally think that it is their issue, not Lenovo's fault.  This is unconfirmed though and is just something that the Verizon engineer said when he leaked that information about the delayed Droid Lollipop update.  With that said, they're still getting 5.1 updates out before HTC, LG, Sony and mostly Samsung(yes, some of these OEMs have pushed out 5.1 updates but Motorola is working on getting 5.1 on a 2013 flagship).

Android,3dz8dj,ThunderJRodriguez,8,Mon Jul 20 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"Most, but not all. The ones that recognized their limitations (mainly battery life and processing power) and kept it simple are the winners in my opinion.  For example, the first-gen Pebble is still useful even though it's like two years old now, and I've never gotten my hands on a Pebble Time, but it looks very functional (although it's admittedly not very stylish).  Also, shout-out to the Xiaomi Mi Band. It doesn't have a screen, but the battery lasts like two months and it gives me custom vibrating notifications."

Android,3dz8dj,lightinthedark,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:31 2015 UTC,In press photos they look awesome but in real life the build quality is sub par. Especially when compared to the apple watch. I have done a complete 360 (heh) in my opinion of android wearables compared to apples attempt.
Android,3dz8dj,deckchair,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:39 2015 UTC,"Android smartwatch build quality is more than enough for the average user that cares mainly about functionality and their money's worth. And price value speaking, anyone that knows their stuff will laugh at the Apple Watch's pricing.   If you really just care about looks and have money to spare, then I guess the Apple watch is the better option subjectively speaking, since albeit the build quality is the best out there by far, not everyone likes it's design (a lot of us expected a sleeker, thinner, round screened watch). I've heard some big boned people love the lg g watch r / urbane because it looks exactly what a real watch would look like and blends right in without making the user look like a dork.   And I personally dig the Asus ZenWatch (even if the build quality sucks) because it's the smallest watch out there, and the only one that fits me since I have thin wrists and anything else looks huge on me. I guess it all comes down to personal taste."
Android,3dz8dj,sarxion,35,Tue Jul 21 13:24:05 2015 UTC,"A watch is an accessory. Form is one of, if not the, most important feature it has. It's like anything else that you would wear. You could find the most comfortable pair of shoes for $20 and you might not wear them if they look like shit (crocs hehe).  The average person has spoken and they bought the pretty watch. And I don't think that makes them wrong at all."

Android,3dz8dj,skwint,3,Tue Jul 21 17:42:11 2015 UTC,I personally think it's one of the better looking smart watches. The best looking is the moto 360. Now if some manufacturer can combine all the watches features together in a good looking package and give it good battery life....
Android,3dz8dj,MrRiotRick,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed - I sense a lot of odd anger/hate at the Zen watch - and smart watches in general.    I happen to love my Zen Watch and the bezels are small enough that it just looks like a skinny little band, nothing outstanding.  The swap-able band is a blessing because my sweat ran the color right out of the damn thing (I'm naturally acerbic/acidic).  The battery life is better than I expected and I'm no longer missing phone calls/messages from my wife (the main reason I got it).  Is it the most amazing thing out there.. nope, don't need it to be.  It was one of the less expensive SW's out there that does what I need it to do without being a distraction.  I work with middle schoolers and these kids are the aficionados of style (just ask them) and I've yet to have anyone toss hate on my watch.   People can piss and moan all they want - if you don't like it, don't get it, but shove off being an ass to those of us that do like it."
Android,3dz8dj,Snarky_Librarian,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Is it the most amazing thing out there.. nope, don't need it to be.     This is exactly what most people don't understand. It's a convenience that provides additional functionality over a basic watch. People are expecting it to function like a new phone or desktop computer, when in reality they should be comparing it to a wristwatch that only tells the time and maybe the date. From that it's a big step up. But /r/android has always had lots of vitriol over people having different preferences."
Android,3dz8dj,PantherHeel93,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, it's a couple steps up from a typical wristwatch.  Besides not missing phone calls/messages, I do like having travel directions on the watch...don't have to look like a complete twat with my phone out trying to figure out where I'm going.  And oddly enough I get a kick out of the weather alerts that vibrate when shit gets real."
Android,3dz8dj,Snarky_Librarian,6,Tue Jul 21 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's not going to make you breakfast or give you blowhandies in the peenstaff, but when used appropriately it will provide a variety of valuable conveniences that could very well be worth the price.

It measures your steps, continuous heart rate monitoring,  sleep tracking and it had a gps built in that you can use for runs / rides. Battery lasts a couple of days.  But it's not an android wear watch. No apps etc. If stuff like this gets combined into one watch I'll definately get it."
Android,3dz8dj,MrRiotRick,4,Tue Jul 21 06:09:19 2015 UTC,"The funny thing which proves my point is that none of the reasons you guys have mentioned are the reasons I'd be excited to get a smartwatch, save for the directions on the wrist. They have so much functionality even at their first iteration that there are at least three different viable audiences for them."
Android,3dz8dj,PantherHeel93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:38:45 2015 UTC,That's the thing I don't get.  Why would you spend over a hundred dollars on what amounts to be a wrist watch that requires daily recharging?  That's not very convenient.
Android,3dz8dj,AppleBytes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:35 2015 UTC,"Firstly, it doesn't amount to a wristwatch that requires daily recharging. It has much more functionality than a typical watch, and most people don't mind recharging things since they're not too busy while they're asleep. Secondly, different people have different lifestyles and budgets. They would therefore pay that price if they either have more money than you or if they feel that what it offers (convenience) is worth the price. It's even less of an issue if this hypothetical person also needs a new watch. It seems that a lot of people here don't understand that if you don't wear watches, you're not the target market."
Android,3dz8dj,PantherHeel93,5,Tue Jul 21 01:16:57 2015 UTC,"But isn't that the source of the product-class' problem?  People cannot articulate why they need it, beyond that it's new, shinny, and I want it?    The only people buying these watches are those that need to own the next ""in"" thing.  Which is fine, it's your money.  But i've yet to see any other compelling reason to own one."
Android,3dz8dj,AppleBytes,4,Tue Jul 21 01:43:25 2015 UTC,"If you look at it from only one POV.    I knew why I wanted it - I don't feel vibrations from my phone in my pocket, I certainly do feel the vibrations on my wrist.  I can discreetly look at my watch while I'm teaching to see what's what and not create a distraction like pulling out my phone would be.  (Not to mention having cell phones out is a no-no for our students, so I don't have to be a hypocrite...sort-of).    The only people buying these watches are those that need to own the next ""in"" thing.    I'd love to have all the latest goodies but it's not realistic to me, and I still have my Nexus 4 at my hip and it does everything I need a phone to do, so have no need to upgrade.  I wanted this watch because it promised an opportunity to fix a real problem I had (missing calls and messages from wife and daughter).  It's bad enough pissing off one woman, never piss off two if you can avoid it.  Don't write off a whole idea because you don't see it.  This isn't FOX news.  (That's a joke there see.)"
Android,3dz8dj,Snarky_Librarian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:10 2015 UTC,"I don't wear watches, never have, they've just never felt right on me.  The most compelling reason I've seen to get a smartwatch is that it stop you from pulling out your phone at social gatherings. It's not really considered apropos to be constantly checking your phone's notifications when you're at a dinner or other event... but checking your watch? Well, some people might be offended if you did that in the middle of a conversation, but it's still a hell of a lot better than digging in your pocket and pulling out a 5-6"" device.   Having a smartwatch completely negates the need to pull your phone out to check notifications, which is not only more socially acceptable, but also extends the battery life of your phone since it sits in standby more often. As someone who has never really been interested in watches as timepieces, that's enough to make me consider one if I found one that I liked."
Android,3dz8dj,spilurum,3,Tue Jul 21 02:56:07 2015 UTC,"I just described why people would want it, and if you want more in-depth reasons you can Google it, but obviously you're more interested in pushing your opinion to feel superior than understanding the opinions of others.

Android,3dz8dj,_chinchillin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:47 2015 UTC,"I would.  I've not gotten up close to the pebble so I can't make a fair comparison between the two.  I've only found a handful of apps that won't run, but nothing heartbreaking.  I had it up and connected to my phone and sending messages within 5mins. of opening it.  I know Pebble gets good reviews as to seeing it in sunlight (I work indoors, so not really an issue). I keep my watch on the lowest brightness and have no problem seeing it except in sunlight, which is only a problem if you're one handed... (shield the sun with the other see).  Colors are distinct, response time isn't super fast, but damn you're wearing a micro-computer on your wrist, how fast do you think it'd be?  Mind I can't tell if response time is just the watch or my 2yo phone (Nexus 4).  Giving commands is no less goofy than doing ""OK GOOGLE"" on your phone... most of the time it works great, sometimes it thinks you're speaking random shit.  (I mean I do that too, but mostly when I'm responding to my wife, just to mess with her.)  Final response - If given the option again, yeah I'd buy the watch again.  I can't wait to see what the 2nd generation can do and will probably get the ASUS again when this one craps the bed.  It honestly is a nice looking watch and is much smaller than the others.  Swapping out bands can change its look as well, so something to consider if you care about that stuff."
Android,3dz8dj,Snarky_Librarian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:12 2015 UTC,"I got one about 6 months ago and I have no regrets. I love this thing. It does everything I want a smartwatch to do and it looks good as well.   The battery life is good. One day on heavy use, and easily 2 days of normal use. It also charges in about 1-1.5 hours so it's pretty quick if you needed a boost.   People complain about the bezels, but honestly after a day or two you don't even notice them. They actually have a bit of a textured look to them that adds to the look of the watch in my opinion.  The band that comes with it looks great too. I prefer metal bands, but it fits any 22mm watch band with a spring pin, so it was a simple and cheap switch.   It also does something that I prefer over what would be my second choice of smartwatch, the Moto 360. The screen never turns all the way off. It goes into a dimmed grayscale mode, which means you can always see the time even when the watch is in it ""sleep"" state.   Overall it's a great device for an even better price. If mine broke today I would probably order another one with this deal going on.   If you have any other questions, just ask.   TL;DR: Yes"
Android,3dz8dj,Tdub93,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you think of smartwatches.  If, like me, you find them totally useless, solving problems that don't exist, and also like me, are of the opinion that they aren't as good as a real watch (battery, screen not always on, screen is digital, not analogue, not readable in sunlight), then there is no point buying one at all. Even if it's a fiver.  If you like the concept of smartwatches, why not. It's a cheap way to jump on board and see if it's worth getting a better one."

I agree that this watch would be a great fit for women tough, just because of its size, but that's not to say it's a woman's watch.   This is also in my opinion, the watch the looks the closest to a classic watch, when compared to its oversized modern competitors such as lg, Motorola and apple.  There was even an android authority article just yesterday pointing out how huge smartwatches are being made, leaving an entire demographic of small wristed people behind (the author, a woman, being one of them)"
Android,3dz8dj,sarxion,4,Tue Jul 21 13:36:22 2015 UTC,"I said the design of the watch is what makes it feminine, not its size. I also said it's too big for most women, which is true. It may be thin, but it is wide and very tall as well. Taller than the Moto 360 in fact.   That's just my critique of the watch. I'm still puzzled about how that makes me sound insecure.  Also, I absolutely agree with that article. I wish LG, Motorola, Sony, and Asus would release smaller veraions of their watches. I would definitely buy a smaller Moto 360 if I could."

I don't like the Apple watch's overly refined looks, but I don't call it a watch for women just because it doesn't suit my taste for more classic looking watches.

Android,3e1r2d,Pr3no,24,Tue Jul 21 10:56:48 2015 UTC,"You do need an app to tell you to switch to Relay. Oh, snap!  (Just joking they're both good, but I prefer Relay.)"

Android,3e1r2d,theDefine,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"So far I like Slide, but I have a few issues with it.   First off, if I choose a white theme for my subreddit color, it doesn't invert the text to black, so it makes it extremely difficult to see any text.   Second, I don't like having to hold down on a comment to upvote it. The thing I liked most about reddit is fun is the fact that you can upvote and do other things so easily. This makes it seem like a chore.   Third, it crashes ALL THE TIME. If I use the app and press more than three buttons it just crashes. Most of my experience with the app so far is it not responding."
Android,3e1r2d,Pantscada,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"I tried it a couple days ago when the dev made a post about it, it seemed pretty good, but there was no way to hide posts, and I simply can't use reddit without the hide button."
Android,3e1r2d,Pr3no,5,Tue Jul 21 13:37:30 2015 UTC,"I've never actually used the hide button, if there's threads I don't want to see I probably won't be subscribed to the subreddit. I'm curious, what do you use it for?  The deal breaker for Slide over Sync for me though was the lack of the comment navigation (the little arrows at the bottom left and right of Sync)."
Android,3e1r2d,tarots,0,Tue Jul 21 14:06:21 2015 UTC,Old threads I read and no longer care about that are still at the top of slower subs. Or threads I just don't care about in general - for example the uptenth video review of some budget phone I'll never have any interest in buying. The hide button cleans these things up so I can scroll to new content more quickly.

Android,3e1r2d,Schnabeltierchen,7,Tue Jul 21 13:29:35 2015 UTC,"I prefer Relay over Sync, too, but Relay is also really buggy.

For more esoteric artists, Spotify (and pandora, and probably everything else) is simply unable to draw a line to something else in the same vein, that isn't another song by that artist.  It's too easy to get stuck in the rabbit hole of ""I'm going going to play songs from these half dozen artists"".  Side bar: One thing I think Spotify hasn't fixed it is when it switched from starred tracks to checked tracks, you lost the ability to play a radio station based on your starred tracks. Albeit, the radio was so shitty that it basically just played my starred tracks but the idea of playing radio based on my favorite tracks is inherently a good one. I don't understand why Spotify hasn't added a radio button to your checked songs."

Spotify is like ""ah, you like metal, here's a station with metal from the 80s"". Cool, not really what I was looking for though...  Play Music also has radios for moods + activities. I love that they have a metal station that's only instrumental, and I love that I found it by asking it for radio stations for when I'm writing code."

I've gotten better results with artist/song radio but not much, but I just end up making new radios all the time as they get old quick. I rarely made new Pandora radios when I used that."
Android,3dy5ct,adaeth,12,Mon Jul 20 23:56:43 2015 UTC,"I mean start a radio station not from a single artist or single song, but from a playlist so it has a lot more seeds to work off of. The idea of radio is give you a lean-back listening where you skip as little as possible and so some of the songs are going to be directly from the seeds. It computes the songs in the radio station when you start listening based on the seeds.  Discover takes account of your listening history within a time period and is designed to show you songs and artists that you've never listened to (hence, Discover) but is typically generated overnight as it takes time to compute for all the songs you've listened in a period of time."

The added size in which to work with allows these advancements to be made, instead of spending large amounts of money in R&D to simply shrink the old technology. And seeing that it is a minority that lie below the trend in the size of the devices, it wouldn't be cost effective to do so. It is beneficial for the manufacturers to release devices for this minority with Sub-Standard specifications for this group, both offering freedom of choice and urging them to embrace the trend to purchase the more expensive and larger flagships.  It is a business strategy that has bought the smartphone market to where it is now, which is in the interest of themselves and the consumers which continue to be treated to incredible advancement in smartphone technology year after year.

The Galaxy Alpha didn't sell well because it was treated as a second class device by Samsung.  Only released on a small handful of carriers(only one in the US) and not marketed at all. People don't buy the small ""budget"" phones because they have crappy specs.  People want flagships.  Also, many of these ""budget"" phones were quite expensive.

Finding the perfect Android flagship is like visiting the world's biggest grocery store and looking for lettuce only to find no one has the basic lettuce you want.

I've always wondered whatever happened to the kickstand. Having to lean a $600 flagship against a cup of coffee so I can watch something over breakfast is a joke. One of the best designs of recent that I can remember would probably be the HTC Surround with kickstand and front facing speakers. Now we get $600+ LG G4 with one speaker on one side of the phone facing backwards. Really? And 5.5"" with no kickstand, as if it's default mode to watch your videos with it facing flat against a table. You can shove your ""Quad HD"" if I have to constantly find something to lean the phone against. I swear phone designers are turning into idiots."

Android,3dz6py,bentika,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:50:56 2015 UTC,"Not really a niche - a kickstand doesn't target a specific set of consumers who really wants it. A kickstand should be something that is a necessity for larger 5""+ devices that are marketed around multimedia usage. That's like a magazine page telling how you amazing their perfume is but doesn't have a folded sampler. Just the same, don't boast about your multimedia smartphone with Quad HD display and amazing single-backwards-facing speaker if it don't have something so basic to prop it up on a flat surface. You do not put the burden on the customers for them to purchase a solution. That is just laziness on their part.  No doubt there are kickstands that look absolutely hideous. But then there are kickstands which are robustly built and look absolutely gorgeous. This will be one of those ""holy shit why didn't we think of that"" moments that will happen when Apple decides to do it."
Android,3dz6py,ChulaK,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:57 2015 UTC,"I think a big issue with a built-in kickstand is that it's something mechanical that could have potential for malfunctioning.  Especially on a smaller device, where the kickstand will have to be relatively small and possibly not very durable."
Android,3dz6py,probably2high,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:31 2015 UTC,I'll have to disagree here. It is a niche and the proper solution is a case with a kickstand. If the kickstand is built in to the device it will either be easily broken (and hard to replace) or be of such a quality that it raises the value of a phone for a feature that not everyone is going to want.  A case with a kickstand is a way for people that want the kickstand to get their kickstand and for people that don't to have a clean looking smartphone with no external moving (read: breakable) parts.
Android,3dz6py,baneoficarus,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"I personally didn't think that kickstand looked too bad. If I remember correctly, it was just a strip of silver, wasn't it?

Android,3dz6py,ClearAsNight,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:25 2015 UTC,A kickstand adds quite a lot of bulk and many people wouldn't want one at all. It makes much more sense for the kickstand to be included in a case IMO. That keeps it optional and much more easily replaceable if it breaks.

Android,3dz6py,PantherHeel93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:42 2015 UTC,Product cycles don't work like that. You have people upgrading at different time frames. On average smartphones are upgraded every 18-24 months for most people. But the 18-24 month interval comes at different times for different people. Simple way to understand is what Apple does. If you got an iphone 4 you will likely skip the 4s and get the 5. If you got the 4s you will likely get the 5s. Android manufacturers don't have a simple to understand convention like this thus leading to the perception issue of lack of innovation and change. Apple has established the pattern of one design for 2 years and then change. Android manufacturers are too random thus leading to inconsistent expectations. HTC has already suffered due to a baseline expectation of a design upgrade every two years the way Apple does it.

Android,3dz6py,zirzo,15,Tue Jul 21 15:18:43 2015 UTC,Not Android and an obscure niche respectively. More storage barely needs a redesign from an existing model and 'MP3 player phone' is an obvious niche.
Android,3dz6py,ixid,5,Tue Jul 21 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"All phones are MP3 player phones.  For storage issues, local storage should not be the focus.  Storage will increase as it always has.  What needs to be the focus, and this is more the carriers and less the manufacturers, is cloud streaming and better data prices.  I would rather pay a little more for my phone outright, own it fully, and have a bundle that includes a certain amount of cloud storage for my files (music, media, whatever) and free access to THOSE FILES on that network.  So, for example, Sprint offers 10GB of storage on their plan, and streaming music, movies, etc from THAT storage (via an app or whatever) does not count towards your data cap (fucking data caps), but if I want to stream Youtube, then that still counts.  And it seems like a pretty easy way to get people to want to be on your carrier network and stay there, since they are now invested in all of the data they have put up into your cloud space.  Works with all existing phones and going forward, without requiring huge innovation.  Also offer a promotion to new customers buying into the cloud storage space option with bigger storage options, and tiered pricing for larger space."
Android,3dz6py,zzisrafelzz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:48 2015 UTC,"All phones are MP3 player phones.   You say that as if I wasn't aware of that. Of course they are. But more storage means much more music and entertainment. You can still brand it as an MP3 and video specialist device.   For storage issues, local storage should not be the focus.   Please tell me you're not serious. I have limitless 4G and live in a major city and there is no way that I can use the Cloud instead of local storage effectively. I, and many others, want extensive local storage.  You say storage will increase as it always has- it has barely increased in the last five years. Also higher res content is on the way which will REALLY need an increase in storage now we have 2K screens.  I own my phone outright and have plenty of cloud storage, it's not good enough.   Why the Cloud fails in Glorious technicolour  So as stated I live in a major city with complete 4G coverage. The Cloud is a joke because- I commute UNDERGROUND so no cell reception and limited station wifi.  I also use my phone extensively when travelling by train and on holiday. When travelling reception regularly drops out for significant periods and when it's there data speeds can be low and unreliable, local storage doesn't suffer from endless buffering. Streaming always does.  When on holiday when I will most want a stash of shows and music there will often be no reception at all or I will be in another country where data is limited (I have a great international data plan and it's still not good enough) or incredibly expensive.

Android,3dz6py,ixid,3,Tue Jul 21 16:13:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. The cloud super doesn't cut it - NOW.  Carriers currently have no impetus to compete on any front.  But, if there were a ""storage war"" to compete with both bandwidth (to access the content) and coverage (reliable accessibility), whoever gets out ahead in these two fields will grow HUGELY because they will have people subscribing to their service for both of those features, and because they can unify their cloud storage to be reliable on all devices, and free (or, covered anyways) to access on the go.  It is a huge opportunity to grow into, IF a carrier cares to actually exploit this huge market niche."

And if the attacker did bruteforce the home network I think the phone is barely relevant anymore, he can just sniff everything going through.  KARMA is neat but it doesn't solve the problem, it most cases the phone won't connect automatically to the rogue AP if it doesn't recognize the password/key. Modern encryption protocols and drivers protect both the client and router.

Android,3dypkk,redux42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"If phones work anything like these sensors, it will connect to the strongest signal until it connects to the same signal so many times in which it will become a preference. So even if the home signal is weaker, devices may still try to connect to it instead of an external AP.  I was thinking this application would be best say out in public with a little battery powered AP, or find some way to shut off someone's AP in their home, or something."

My neighbors can unlock my device, and so can someone that sits outside on the street. But honestly, WiFi unlock is useful for 99% of the users out there.

Android,3dypkk,dlerium,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:42 2015 UTC,"WiFi clients broadcast SSID's that they want to connect to   WiFi clients should only send/spam unsolicited probe requests for ""hidden"" SSID networks. With non-hidden SSID the client will only send a probe request if the AP has sent a beacon advertising it offers that SSID already. If your device IS sending unsolicited probe requests for non-hidden SSID that is isn't detecting beacons for your OS is really old/buggy and crowding the airwaves pointlessly. I know WinXP era operating systems do/did this but I believe this has since corrected in newer OS.  Due to this endless spam looking for hidden SSID I happen to know a local hospital has 8 hidden ssid networks with all 8 being wpa2 encrypted and SSID has a /r/im14andthisisfunny SSID of OSHIT (oh shit). My guess it is an unfortunately combination of the hospital's initials and the initials for Information Technology.   Then they just need to make a fake AP and they are in.   Only if the SSID they are faking is an open unencrypted SSID. Otherwise your device won't connect because the encryption and authentication differ from the stored values on your device.  If the SSID is hidden with WEP encryption I believe there is a way to spam the client and packet dump the wep-key the same way you would do it to an access point using WEP encryption.  KARMA and its derivatives mainly rely on tricking clients to connect to them through open unencrypted SSID that are on the device already. You aren't going to force my phone to automatically connect to your fake AP and somehow forget that the SSID you are using is missing the wpa2 enterprise encryption unless there is a [un]known bug in the wifi driver/firmware that is being exploited."

There is tons and tons of evidence that Google Play Services rapes your battery, and I'm quite confident I don't need to prove that.   I know it's Google Play Services, and I know it's specifically because of its location features and its mobile radio active bug that are causing the battery massacre. Want to know how I know? If I unfuck Play Services using a combination of tools and XPosed modules, I can hit 6 to 7 hours of screen on time with L. Out of the box? I'm lucky to hit 4. I usually end up with closer to 3.   On KitKat, no matter what, custom ROM or official 11S, I would easily eclipse 6 hours of SoT and 7 if I was paying attention. There were people getting 10 hours of SoT and 2 and a half days of standby. Maybe you didn't own your OPO back when it was on CM11S/KitKat, but I got used to the idea of not caring about my battery life anymore.

Android,3e0sni,zirzo,2,Tue Jul 21 09:48:39 2015 UTC,You are touching on part of the problem. The ad systems are a big part of the problem as well. Read the stratechery post linked in the verge article. That does a good job of showing high level strategy going on in the ad tech ecosystem. To summarize regardless of how good a job a dev team does with the website eventually the site will end up in the sales/ads team and they will add in a few trackers for ads from different vendors and a few for analytics and maybe some more for SEO. This eventually bulges up to 8-10 additional server side calls.
Android,3e0sni,devolute,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is often true.  I think too often we give up when it comes to advertising, as if it's some sort of last-stage to building the website. It should be an intrinsic part of the planning and considered in performance budgets, etc.  If we hold ourselves to a higher standard, we should certainly hold those who supply advertising systems to a similar standard.

Android,3e0sni,Mavendreas,0,Tue Jul 21 15:08:55 2015 UTC,Yeah. If technical priorities move up the ranks a bit more and the ad providers are evaluated based on their performance rather than pure revenue they can bring in it would help a lot. Whats RWD BTW

On a typical publishing website displaying the content takes just a small fraction of the total processing time. Monstrously inefficient content publishing frameworks take their toll, but it's usually tolerable. What little CPU power and RAM left on the mobile device is eaten up by dozens of trackers, ads, monitoring and statistics beacons, social buttons, 3rd party comment feeds and who knows what else.

Android,3e0sni,RequiemDK,2,Tue Jul 21 06:05:49 2015 UTC,"iOS being a lot less resource heavy is the consequence of it being arguably less functional/powerful. Jailbreak an iOS device older than the iPhone 6 and you'll find yourself running into lots of issues with the lack of RAM when you start installing tweaks to reach Android's customisability. My iPad mini Retina can barely upload full size DSLR shots to Instagram without crashing 8 out of 10 times.   The thing is that Apple has a strict screening process when it comes to the App Store, thus giving you the impression that all these games run great on the iPhone and the iPhone doesn't need to be stronger. The reality is that a LOT of effort is gone into optimising games and apps. Speaking from previous experience 1GB of RAM is really difficult to work with. The difference between having 1GB and 2GB of RAM to work with on Apple devices is huge.   2/3GB of RAM is one of the reasons why apps like Flynx and Link Bubble exist. The iOS counterpart of this is a Cydia app called Multify (I can't remember as I gave up on multitask tweaks after awhile) and it runs completely abysmally the last time I tried. Why do you think that split screening apps will only be on the iPad Air 2?   I'm not hating on either platforms, I dual wield an iPhone 5S and a HTC One M8 daily so I'm speaking from a purely objective point of view.  EDIT: just realized I was on /r/Android instead of /r/Apple, you could probably tell by how careful I was with the criticism against iOS lol."

Android,3e0sni,Carighan,6,Tue Jul 21 08:47:49 2015 UTC,"So while all commenters talk about Apple's tight control of hardware and software or super-optimized devices, here's the only real reason:   iOS has no garbage collection.

F1 cars really don't like sitting around without air flow, the brakes set fire, the engines over heat, the whole car just dies. But at the same time when you originally start them up from cold the whole engine is ceased in place due to the fine tolerances so heated fluid has to be pumped round it to even be able to start it."
Android,3dwdn7,Psyc5,13,Mon Jul 20 12:07:32 2015 UTC,"Tyres get heat by:   Load - This is why the cars weave back and forth not to gain heat from friction between the tyre and asphalt, but to compress the air inside the tyres. compression generates heat. Brakes - Racing cars' brakes get hot, like a thousand degrees C hot. These brake temps can transfer through the hub and then the wheel to heat up the tyres.   At speed, the brake temps are managed by Brake Ducts which catch air and move it by the brake assembly. At a stand still, no airflow, so less brake cooling.   Changing the temps of the tyres also changes the air pressure within the tyres, which changes their characteristics. Drivers on the starting grid have to compromise their temperatures since they'll be sitting stationary, unable to cool their car with airflow. , you could see the tyre surface temp heat up because the super hot brake hubs were transferring heat to the wheels and air inside the tyres, eventually to the point that you could see the change in the tyre surface. Look at any other car's wheels/hubs. They'll always much hotter than the surface."
Android,3dwdn7,vorin,4,Mon Jul 20 13:31:41 2015 UTC,"Brakes get up to 1000 celsius, that'll transfer heat into the wheel and tyre - look at the car to the right's front left, extremely hot brake and that heats things up. Driving along is essentially a breeze on a hot day turned up to 11, it'll cool the tyres down."
Android,3dwdn7,Blubbey,2,Mon Jul 20 13:02:43 2015 UTC,They put hot blankets on the tires to heat them before they set off. That's why they were glowing at the starts. Then airflow cools them.
Android,3dwdn7,1237894560,3,Mon Jul 20 15:40:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I'm not sure if you got a real answer here. I have friends who work in Motorsport as vehicle engineers.   So when you are braking, there is much more heat going into the tire because you are working it more. On a straight, the wheels are just free rolling.   Also, they design the rims and brake systems on F1 cars to keep the heat in the tires. The heat is very important and they carefully test and design the systems for optimal heat dispersion.   The same effects can be seen while turning. When going around a right hand turn, the outside wheel takes the load of the car and the outside wheel heats up. Also when braking, the tires heat up. They want the most grip when turning because it is most important.   It is also good to know that there is massive amounts of normal load on those tires from the downforce created by the aerodynamic aspects of the car.   Reply with any questions and if they are above my pay grade, I'll ask some friends for clarification. But basic idea is brakes heat up, they heat up the rim, they heat up the tire. And the tires are working hardest when braking because of weight transfer and friction with the ground."
Android,3dwdn7,sirius_not_white,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:17:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't expect that either. Probably when he was on the starting grid he had just finished a warmup lap, so the tyres were still hot, then when he starts racing they cool down due to the airflow, and heat up only on corners where there's a lot more friction."
Android,3dwdn7,Calneon,4,Mon Jul 20 11:46:35 2015 UTC,"When the races starts, the teams will actually have tire heaters over the tires to keep them hot for the initial launch. These are taken off by the crew at the last second to keep them as hot as possible.  Also when they make corners, there is a lot of residual heat that comes off of the brakes which will heat the tires internally, but most comes from the actual cornering friction itself."

They rushed it in an attempt to compete with Samsung and Apple's ARMv8 chips and went with a reference ARM design, something they haven't done since 2007.  They didn't want to temporarily fade out of existence like they did in 2011 when their older Scorpion chips were being outclassed by the A9 based OMAP and Tegra chipsets.  I honestly don't know why they were worried. OMAP is gone, and the Tegra K1 isn't suited for phones. They could have just released another Krait core with the Adreno 430 and likely not lost any contracts. The 810 was such a piece of hot garbage that they lost Samsung anyway.

Android,3dwdn7,sunjay140,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, then i'm sorry about that. I hope that Samsung fixes the S6's ram management issues. iOS does perform better."
Android,3dwdn7,Avamander,8,Mon Jul 20 21:00:39 2015 UTC,But it performs better.
Android,3dwdn7,Jokermika,24,Mon Jul 20 10:42:34 2015 UTC,Multi tasking still sucks arse and browser tabs constantly refresh. That isn't exactly good.
Android,3dwdn7,Avamander,4,Mon Jul 20 11:49:16 2015 UTC,"But apps do not get killed by OOM, keyboard will open every time and pages do show. (These happen when the amount of ram is too low)"
Android,3dwdn7,flamingspartan3,11,Mon Jul 20 11:53:51 2015 UTC,1 GB of RAM is terrible; my Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 2013 multitask so much better than my iPhone 6. Apple probably has the keyboard in permanent memory so that it will always load.
Android,3dwdn7,Avamander,7,Mon Jul 20 12:16:47 2015 UTC,I know it is awful. But iOS can do much more with the same amount.
Android,3dwdn7,beznogim,6,Mon Jul 20 12:34:52 2015 UTC,"Native iOS apps are quite efficient, but RAM usage is still a huge problem for the browser. It takes around 100-150 MB to load an article from a heavily ad-supported site. A single browser tab can displace several apps, leading to annoying app restarts and page reloads.

Android,3dwdn7,AlexMeanberg,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:17 2015 UTC,They don't care about the numbers race but they still manage to kick ass in benchmarks. Which is kinda funny.
Android,3dwdn7,oozekip,11,Mon Jul 20 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"Apple doesn't care about pointlessly adding more ram, CPU cores (why are 8 core phones even a thing? Most desktop CPUs only have 4, and they're MUCH more performance hungry than phones), etc. They optimize like nobody's business until they reach as far as they can, then upgrade slightly.  Say what you want about the iPhone's lower specs on paper, its able to do much more with it than any Android phone simply due to standardized hardware."
Android,3dwdn7,CykaLogic,3,Mon Jul 20 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"Uh, OEMs have AOSP source code. They also have only 1 flagship to optimize for. It's up to them to optimize the OS, you can't just say Android is less optimized because it has lots of variation."
Android,3dwdn7,Teethpasta,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:30 2015 UTC,No. Apple just has two big cores instead of 8 small ones. Which is the smart thing to do as single threaded tasks are mostly what people do.
Android,3dwdn7,BoatCat,20,Mon Jul 20 21:24:08 2015 UTC,Their SoC is literally 4 times larger
Android,3dwdn7,URAPEACEOFSHEET,23,Mon Jul 20 05:45:08 2015 UTC,"Not really, their soc is really small, the cores die area are really big."
Android,3dwdn7,Hi_My_Name_Is_Dave,11,Mon Jul 20 06:05:45 2015 UTC,So why can't Snapdragon do that? If the A8 can fit in something as small as the new iPod then why can't Snapdragon make a chip bigger for androids that are generally much bigger?
Android,3dwdn7,weinerschnitzelboy,15,Mon Jul 20 07:57:14 2015 UTC,"It's not that much bigger to be honest. That's misinformation. Apple has the massive advantage of custom designing the processor alongside the OS. This leads to really awesome efficiency in hardware and software. Apple and Qualcomm (or really Android in this case) approach their processor differently. Apple opts for less but larger and more powerful cores while Qualcomm goes for more cores with less power. Apple's approach is great in single core performance but not as good multi threaded tasks (not to say that it's bad), which is fine. Especially considering how iOS is built to handle multi tasking. Qualcomm is worse at single core performance, and until recently on par with multi core performance. This is great for the way Android handles its multi tasking.   The recent 8 core craze is a bit misleading. There are two clusters of quad cores, one dedicated to power efficiency and another towards performance. A max of only 4 cores can be used at a time switching between the two clusters depending on how intensive the task is."

Android,3dwdn7,TeutorixAleria,5,Mon Jul 20 15:54:29 2015 UTC,Multi threading is literally only useful for benchmarks and applications that generally aren't done on phones.   Apple is in this case completely on the ball the majority of mobile applications call for high single thread performance.
Android,3dwdn7,juanjux,8,Mon Jul 20 09:18:25 2015 UTC,"I only had an app on the Google Play Store, but it benefited immensely from multi-threading. Other apps that benefit for it: browser, email program, music players, video players...  Also, it's not a question of single apps. If your phone is doing some background work like processing an incoming Whatsapp or email while you are using a single threaded app, you still benefit from multicore even if the app that you're using doesn't benefit directly (but it will benefit indirectly, it'll go smother)."
Android,3dwdn7,ikjadoon,7,Mon Jul 20 10:46:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Even A8 has two cores (the A8X has 3 cores). Multiple cores is not some benchmarking gimmick.   ""8 cores"" or ""12 cores"" is a benchmarking gimmick, though, haha."
Android,3dwdn7,TeutorixAleria,2,Mon Jul 20 11:53:54 2015 UTC,You don't need 4 threads for that 2 will do.   In the vast majority of phone usage scenarios a dual core is as fast if not faster than a quad. Phones generally are doing one intensive thing at a time this means that have a higher clocked dual core is more efficient than having a slightly lower clock quad.   You don't need a fucking octocore cpu to handle background notifications.
Android,3dwdn7,ikjadoon,3,Mon Jul 20 11:44:25 2015 UTC,"But, Android has relatively decent multi-tasking: if you're running Tasker, and a handful of other apps in the background, etc., isn't it better to have at least 3-4 cores?"
Android,3dwdn7,cardenaso10,2,Mon Jul 20 11:29:06 2015 UTC,"For some applications it is. Most applications can use 2 or 3 threads, and separating those from the thread the OS is running on is nice. In theory, distributing large workloads over multiple processors should be the best for power efficiency but Apple has taught us this isn't always 100% true."
Android,3dwdn7,ikjadoon,2,Mon Jul 20 20:59:25 2015 UTC,"Most applications/Android use 4 cores very well:  http://www.androidauthority.com/fact-or-fiction-android-apps-only-use-one-cpu-core-610352/  Battery efficiency is another demon. Our discussion is simply about utilization.  Err, that's not necessarily the right conclusion to draw. The OSes have different expectations for users: Apple severely limits CPU usage in background tasks. That's one reason they have strong battery life."
Android,3dwdn7,icase81,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"Snapdragon can, its that the 810 isn't a Qualcomm design. Its an ARM reference design because the 820's Kryo core wasn't ready yet. The 820 is the first new core from Qualcomm since the Krait cores in 2012."

Android,3dy7n1,arcticblue,0,Tue Jul 21 12:08:06 2015 UTC,All my photos are on my iPhone 6 pretty much unless I want shallow DOF   Isn't that because the iPhone uses an f2.2 lense? Maybe Apple will follow Samsung's lead and go f1.9 since people seem to really like the shallow DOF look.
Android,3dy7n1,BaconatedGrapefruit,0,Tue Jul 21 13:07:16 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, that's why I'm saying the f/2.0 lens on the OPO certainly helps. But let's be totally honest. f/2.0 on an OPO is something like f/8.0 on a full frame sensor in terms of depth of field. It's not truly that shallow.  One has to take into sensor size into account, so while the OPO may get more light at f/2.0, the actual depth of field may be different due to varying sensor sizes and focal lengths. Its too hard to compute (and honestly its splitting hairs when we're talking about tiny sensors)."
Android,3dy7n1,dlerium,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"You can change how the exposure metering works in settings, but the tap to focus will also change the exposure where you tap unfortunately no matter what settings and will leave most photos with bad exposure due to the bad dynamic range it has."

The ease of which I can AF, AF/AE lock, quickly adjust EV compensation on an iPhone without fumbling through menus... it makes for such a better experience.  As for shutter lag, its apparent when you're trying to take multiple photos quickly. The iPhone's burst mode shines, whereas CameraNext will attempt to re-AF each shot, letting you shoot 1-2 frames per second. I think they implemented a semi-burst mode now in the latest COS12 update though, but it's probably 4-5 fps tops?"

The iPhone typically caps at 1/15s using the stock camera app. What about the OP2? Are these handheld shots?   Where this is going is that any camera with a tripod can get beautiful night shots with low noise at ISO100 with long exposure. I'm assuming the iPhone is tested with its stock camera app meaning its 1/15s shutter and whatever ISO needed for a decent exposure.  If the OP2 is using long exposure, then that's not really a fair test. The fair test should be what can the OP2 get at 1/15s shutter speed. Is the noise difference that noticeable with similar shutter speeds? The point is I want to know what I can achieve with both cameras (I carry an iPhone 6 for work) in a handheld shooting environment without having to worry about camera shake. What good to me are the OP2 samples if they're shot at 1s exposure?  Edit: Furthermore, remember the Clear Image option in the OPO Camera? It takes like 10 successive shots and merges them together for low noise. That could be what's going on here. I don't care about any of those gimmicks. I would like a 1 shot apples to apples comparison."

You take pictures with apples to apples settings--so look at DPReview for example. Typical comparison means same exposure and you compare the noise levels at each ISO level (100, 200, 400, etc).  In this case I understand both phones should have different apertures so you its more difficult to match exposures without tweaking other stuff.  The point should be to see what you can achieve at the same ISO levels here, or perhaps with night photography, have equal shutter speeds because limitations are with how steady you can hold a camera, and then look at the noise levels. That will give you a real world comparison of what your photos will actually look like."

Android,3dxe9o,nlitened1,6,Mon Jul 20 23:57:38 2015 UTC,Good place to look. Sweden has a lot of betas.
Android,3dxe9o,EntropismAtWork,6,Mon Jul 20 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"Why are they doing a beta test like this only in Sweden? Instead of something open for all countries, or their ""native"" country, a the one where they have the most customers? I'm not just complaining, I'm actually asking; it seems like such an arbitrary choice."
Android,3dxe9o,vmont,2,Mon Jul 20 14:55:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know but it might not be totally arbitrary since Sony has a research and development facility in Lund, Sweden. Sony mobile was ""Sony Ericsson"" before, founded by Sony and Swedish Ericsson."
Android,3dxe9o,MalevolentFerret,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:11:21 2015 UTC,You could ask the same question to American tech companies.
Android,3dxe9o,bradley129,-3,Mon Jul 20 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"Sony Mobile's biggest offices are in Tokyo, Japan and Lund, Sweden.  This would be hard to do in Japan, because the market is very operator-centric and -controlled. The Swedish phone market, on the other hand, is pretty decoupled from the operators, and phones are easy to unlock.  So, Sweden it is."

Android,3dyggp,SirPribsy,31,Mon Jul 20 15:44:18 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, I think most people like the hardware of the FirePhone it's just the software we hate."
Android,3dyggp,Rangizingo,24,Mon Jul 20 17:57:47 2015 UTC,Like any Amazon device really.... If they just did the hardware they do now and took stock Amazon and gave it a twist like everyone else does they'd sell their shit like hot cakes. So frustrating.
Android,3dyggp,theoriginalfathead,14,Mon Jul 20 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Amazon sells their hardware at cost, so they lock the software to their ecosystem and make money there."
Android,3dyggp,andrewia,17,Mon Jul 20 19:29:53 2015 UTC,"With the Kindles and Fire tablets, I can imagine that being the case. But the Fire phone was sold at full price. Was that really at cost?"
Android,3dyggp,tintin_92,6,Mon Jul 20 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"I get that completely.. But there has to be a better way to do it. Like, I'd always buy my books and stuff on Amazon anyway. I use prime anyway. Surely there's a way to provide all those services baked in without completely destroying android. I mean their appstore is just such a pain to use and the selection for some things is just dire that it makes me sad cuz I love my fire and the ease I can buy books but outside of that its just an irritation to use.. Going online is horrible on their silk browser.. Fml I wish I'd just bought a nexus 7 at this stage. Ha"
Android,3dyggp,theoriginalfathead,4,Mon Jul 20 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"I've got a hard time buying that the Fire Phone was sold at cost initially, or even now."
Android,3dyggp,Rangizingo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:25 2015 UTC,but that clearly isn't working. why not make it stock android + amazon apps that you can't uninstall? i would be ok with that and honestly probably buy one.
Android,3dyggp,pitypitybangbang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:31:50 2015 UTC,"The problem is Amazon doesn't have a guarantee you will use their app store.  In fact, it probably guarantees you won't use their app store and will use Google Play instead.  Their Fire tablets have decent sales so Amazon doesn't have much incentive to change the formula.  They just didn't realize cell phones are much different market and IMO Amazon should've either sold the Fire Phone for free on contract at launch to undercut the competition (Like the Fire tablets do) or rebranded a Chinese phone and add both the Google Play Store and Amazon Appstore, selling it under the Amazon Essentials brand."
Android,3dyggp,andrewia,65,Tue Jul 21 04:36:51 2015 UTC,"Seriously, amazon can lower the price all they want, but only backing up community devs is gonna make a difference."

I mean sure you can install the official Google play store and tweak out the phone but out of the box it isn't that great. I felt bad enough that I sold him my one plus one for 180 bucks.   The fire phone isn't that bad but, I couldn't imagine paying the initial price of this thing when it first came out, which was like 500 bucks or so."
Android,3dyggp,garcia85,21,Mon Jul 20 17:45:39 2015 UTC,"yeah, it was $600 at launch... what were they thinking??  But you're right, out of the box it's just... difficult. That lasted not even 24 hours for me before throwing google play on there and disabling every dynamic perspective/gesture thing I could find."

Android,3dyggp,NotSovietRussia,10,Tue Jul 21 11:48:48 2015 UTC,"I picked it up for my mother and she's pretty happy with it. Wish FireOS had a better language support, since she'd prefer her interface in Russian, but that's a minor thing. She seems to like the oversized UI elements, but doesn't take advantage of android's app ecosystem beyond some basic apps (skype, viber, etc), so she's a perfect use case for it"
Android,3dyggp,cheersdom,5,Mon Jul 20 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"I bought my mom one too. She's not on Ando phone yet (just tablet) so there shouldn't be a feeling of regression. I knew the AMZ app store is only oookkaaaaay (Kindle Fire HD), but for a lot of things you can just use the browser (I side loaded Chrome and it's pretty good although you CANNOT sign into your G-account if you're still on stock Fire).   Hardware is pretty fkn good gotta say."
Android,3dyggp,eaglesucf,9,Mon Jul 20 19:54:13 2015 UTC,Isn't there a root and a way to install CM11 on the fiire phone now? can you do that or am I missing something?
Android,3dyggp,eaglesucf,5,Mon Jul 20 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"there is! I mentioned it in the post. I'm more coming at the software issue from a ""normal user"" perspective. Installing from unknown sources is relatively tame compared to installing a new Rom, I'll probably try it out soon.  the CM11 build, while stable, still has some issues, no NFC, camera support in-third-party-apps is lacking."
Android,3dyggp,eaglesucf,4,Mon Jul 20 19:30:25 2015 UTC,Oh sorry! I thought I read the whole post I skipped right over where you mentioned that. My friend recently asked about getting the fire phone I said he should wait until the cm rom is more stable. So you think it worth it the way you use it?
Android,3dyggp,tintin_92,3,Mon Jul 20 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"For me, yeah! what phone is your friend coming from? Is he already a prime user? All of what I have done can be done on the phone, no need to connect to a computer, mess with adb, or any of that.   It's still super stable because it's running on the KitKat version of FireOS at the heart, and that way it still has all of the Amazon features, so if you are a fan of all the dynamic stuff, you can keep it on. I can still use firefly to identify songs/scan business cards/etc. I can still download prime video for offline (this is the main reason I haven't gone full CM yet actually)  Heck, I even have my moto360 working with it!"
Android,3dyggp,PandaKat90,2,Mon Jul 20 19:55:27 2015 UTC,He is coming from an iPhone 4 so he is looking for a cheap option. And would you recommend this over all the other budget phones like moto g?

Android,3dyggp,voluptuousshmutz,10,Mon Jul 20 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"lol indeed! the story would be - I was plagued with touchscreen issues on the OPO, was able to get a refund on a return. Realized I could get my wife a nice lense for her camera and a Moto E for the $ I spent on the OPO, and I have a little tech blog, so I could write something up on the E.  Then I caught wind of the CM11 rom for Fire Phone when it hit $160 for like 12 hours two weeks ago. Decided to give it a try since the Moto E kept crapping out on me during roadtrips (Nav + Podcasts just couldn't run together reliably with other random notifications coming through) Pulled the trigger when it hit $180, and as providence would have it I end up dropping the E butter side down onto concrete while doing some yard work..."

Android,3dyggp,dabotsonline,2,Tue Jul 21 01:25:58 2015 UTC,How was the Moto E 2015?
Android,3dyggp,negative_commentary,3,Mon Jul 20 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"I loved it, would probably still be using it if this deal hadn't popped up, and then I dropped the Moto and it landed butter side down :/  I would say they still have some memory management issues... not nearly as bad as the G I used last year, and supposedly CM helped that a lot, but never did anything but stock for the time I used it.  It's so dang similar to the moto G LTE, but the newer processor, quicker updates, front facing speaker all made it better IMO. And while I was apprehensive of the screen after 1080p screens on N5 and OPO, it turned out to be great. Sure it's not super High-res but it's dense enough that I had trouble noticing without direct comparison, and the colors/viewing angles/dimness were all great. Maybe could be a bit brighter on max... for outside viewing."
Android,3dyggp,losimagic,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:36 2015 UTC,I also went from a Moto E 2015 to a fire phone and it's been really impressive so far. The Moto E is really good phone but it would crash on me when I would use waze and google play music. I'm starting to think it was a lollipop issue since I've seen other high end phones also have this problem.  The only real issue I came across with th he fire phone was using nova launcher and trying to add/remove wallpapers. It seemed to add a wallpaper but wouldn't let me delete it and I could see it flash for a split second when I would unlock my phone. Did a fresh install and now I'm using the stock launcher.  I'm really happy for what I paid 159.99 and the camera is much better than the moto E.   Good writeup!

Android,3dyggp,GalenRuppsMask,3,Mon Jul 20 23:00:11 2015 UTC,"My dad just (surprisingly) got one. Aside from no back button or capacitive buttons, he enjoys it. His remarks were mainly ""it just works"", ""pretty good camera"", and ""it does what I want it to do"".  He's not a power user but he does use his phone plenty. He's happy with it for the most part. Can't beat that for $180.  That being said, I wouldn't buy one. I'm not a fan of the Fire UI. If that thing had Lollipop and Play Store but kept everything else, I'd get one in a heartbeat. To be honest, those sensors on the front were kind of cool."
Android,3dyggp,tintin_92,3,Mon Jul 20 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"CM11 (Kit Kat) is now on it in a stable release, probably not right for your dad as there are still some annoyances, but if you're ever curious enough to check it out...  I didn't think I was a power user, but both the Moto G and Moto E would fail me on road-trips, I'm happy to have a SD800 w/2GB of RAM again!"
Android,3dyggp,GalenRuppsMask,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:32 2015 UTC,"NO. No. No. No!  i have one for years. it is my backup phone just because of the radios it have match some countries i visit perfectly, so i use it a lot on travels.  it is heavy. the screen is OK. it has glass on both sides!!!! and no bumper. any fall is guaranteed to shatter glass on some side. specially because it is freaking heavy! did i say it is heavy? probably because of the 4 useless cameras that you disable after 2min with the phone.  and the construction is solid my a$$. even though this is the phone i use the least, with some usb cables it only work when the USB plug is pushed down (to the front of the phone). this haven't happened with any other phone using the same cables. (my main one is a 2yr old moto X, and just before that, a nexus one used for 3 yrs... it is now 5yr old without any hiccup --besides the touch screen issue that affect most of them from day one). so it is the crappies of the lot so far.  anyway, but the main problem is the software. it is CRIPPLED beyond reckoning.  It is exactly like having a Palm OS phone. You can't install anything. and the few things you can, won't work. because amazon hijacks several things in android, like allowing to open on any app you want. some intents (the correct android word for actions that be performed by several apps) are locked internally to the amazon useless apps.  mine is running with ADW launcher (same that i use on nexus and other phones) but you can barely use some basic functions without crash.   it's impossible to have proper google accounts. you can hack on some apps, such as gmail, youtube... but anything a little more integrated, like google voice, hangouts dialer, etc... you are on your own. you can't root or flash properly. only the very first phones could root. now you have to downgrade and live with some ancient kernel/android. thanks. no. also the CM11 thing... that's BS. still years from getting anywhere and little interest from other devs, because, well, they have better built phones to play with. which don't weight a ton. i could write this list with 999 items. but i have more to do with my time. and i hope you too. so avoid this flop phone."

Battery life is OK for me, several days with about 6h of SoT.  The biggest drawback is the performance in chrome. It's slow, refreshes all the damn time and makes the tablet heat up till the point it's uncomfortable for me.  A second drawback is the hardware design. It looks and feel very good until you start using it a lot. All the heat generating components are on one side making one hand very hot in landscape mode. My volume buttons are flush with the side making it hard to press.  Overall I'm still happy with the device because I wanted a 4:3 ratio screen which is much better for reading.

Ontop of that the tablet was still on 5.0.2, even the Nexus Player got 5.1.1. Those are the reasons I returned it and got an iPad Air 2 for €50 more. A bit larger and slimmer.

Android,3dxlcq,le_pman,4,Mon Jul 20 23:22:45 2015 UTC,"at the very basic, go through all of the settings for you to understand what you can tweak out of the box. familiarizing with developer options (not sure if the tap build number 7x also applies to the m9) which is hidden by default is a must.  then, check app reviews/roundups. some of the most frequently mentioned are airdroid, pushbullet, tasker and greenify - these apps will help you get the most out of your device - and it doesn't even need the more advanced stuff like bootloader unlocking, root and custom software  lastly, with regard to ""make it mine"" - I believe you're looking for ways to customize how your software looks. try checking /r/androidthemes for more info (since I'm not big on customizing the look)"

Android,3dxlcq,BassRatT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:56 2015 UTC,I am notoriously bad at describing things so I would suggest watching a youtube video. Basically it makes ui changes to things like the app drawer and adjusts grid sizes in some cases so apps can be placed more freely. They do this among other things. I'm on an S6 and notice a large improvement in performance. Touchwiz is awful. I'm not sure about your stock launcher though.

Android,3dxlcq,0verthinker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:44 2015 UTC,"I bought a Nexus 5 in January 2014 and it worked great for a year and a bit then this April it just one day, quit working. About a week before it quit on me I had installed the latest update at the time, Android 5.0.1 (or whichever update was after 5.0) which may have something to do with it.   Whenever I charged it on it would show the Google splash text for about half a second then turn itself off again and I could never access the Bootloader quickly enough as it would turn off in the next half second. This would stop as soon as I took the device out of the charger and I was never able to turn it on again while not charging. I looked up some answers on the web and I couldn't find anyone with the exact issue as me, some said the power switch was probably broken or jammed but I had that replaced in one of  the two repair shops I went too and it didn't seem to do anything at all. I installed 'Nexus Root Toolkit' to see if it would help, which was able to get me to the bootloader but everything I tried failed including factory resetting the phone and various other things. I contacted my provider and they weren't able to fix it and they couldn't replace it because it was after the one year warranty, I contacted Google by phone and they were no help at all and connected be to LG who told me I needed to pay $169 to send the phone to them to have them look at it which I would really not rather do.   I have been using an old iPhone 4 for the last couple months and am still desperate in trying to get this phone to work again. If anyone knows or has suggestions on what to do I'd appreciate them, thank you."

I'm looking for a case that I can put on, and was thinking of a Quick Circle case, since I mostly want to protect the screen (and I like flip covers, sue me :P). I have the AT&T Leather G4 and it looks like there are some weird bits about that, like some of the Circle cases not working with the leather version, and then there are 3rd party cases that don't say anything.  Particularly I don't really care about wireless charging and I didn't see any options for a circle case that didn't have wireless charging built in...is that the case (ahhh...a pun.)?  Also, what other good cases are out there for the G4? I may just get a bumper and clear screen protector and keep the nice leather on the back."
Android,3dxlcq,Uskglass_,2,Mon Jul 20 17:14:06 2015 UTC,"To be clear the circle case replaces the back you currently have on the phone so it doesn't so much ""work with"" your leather back as replace it completely, that's how it enables wireless charging because it has contacts that now touch the battery."

I saw some cases that explicitly say that they don't work with the leather version of the g4 but I guess they mean that you can't have the leather case AND the circle case at the same time? I'm okay with that (I'll probably end up swapping back and forth on a whim pretty often).  EDIT: For reference, on this page (http://www.lg.com/us/cell-phone-accessories) there's this case that says not compliant with leather version: http://www.lg.com/us/cell-phone-accessories/lg-CFV-100-Aqua-Blue-quick-circle-snap-on-folio-case  EDIT 2: This one is $10 more and claims no incompatibility with the leather case: http://www.lg.com/us/cell-phone-accessories/lg-CFR-100A-Violet-Black-quick-circle-wireless-charging-folio-case ...makes me wonder if the actual mechanism to attach the cover is different on the leather version vs. the plastic one."

For one make sure you have a decent amount of free space on your phone. 500 MB or so should be enough. This helps the system have enough space to cache things and not have to constantly reload stuff, as well as some other useful things.   Another thing that helps is restarting it regularly. I find if I leave my phone on too long it can slow down considerably. If you turn it off at night that should be enough.   Lastly factory reset it if it's getting too bad. Phones just get slow over time, and the only way you can really fix it is with a factory reset. It will even help if you reset it and then load your phone from a backup."

Android,3dxlkf,redthunda69,19,Mon Jul 20 12:08:47 2015 UTC,"Well a few reasons.  Tired of the lack of stability, which is in part a factor in the bad and inconsistent battery life I get. And this is running barebones on a HTC One M8 Google Play Edition. Wakeclocks are shredding my battery up like a lot of people's.  Then there's little things like getting apps first, TouchID (which I know is coming), better security (someone who finds a locked iPhone can't use it unless the Apple ID info is known) and the camera.  Basically I want a premium phone with a great camera and stock software/fast updates. I hate how OEMs are on Android. I don't fully trust any of them. They all have some major drawback, in my opinion.  So at this point I'm waiting to see the 6s, and I'll see what the Nexus 5 2015 looks like, but that's it. Not interested in other phones.

Android,3dxlkf,Izick,2,Tue Jul 21 00:56:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah the no setting default apps was annoying.   I don't really buy into the whole iOS is more stable. In my 3 days with the iPhone I had more app crashes than in my 2 years on Android. I have no idea why it was but it sure didn't impress me.  As for slow, no it ran smooth, but loading apps was slow, and for example, I was using Inbox for Gmail instead of the default Mail.app, I'd get a notification that I have a new email and open the app, the email wasn't displayed, I had to wait for it to sync before seeing it. Whereas on Android the email would be displayed as soon as I got the notification. Seems trivial, but it really didn't make the experience enjoyable. There are many other examples of small annoyances I had. I was really happy to come back to Android after.  For the record I used to be a huge iPhone fan. Had every single iPhone starting with the 3G all the way through to the 5S. (I'm not counting the 6+ because I only kept it for 3 days)"
Android,3dxlkf,PolyethyleneAirbag,3,Mon Jul 20 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  See, I like a lot about Android. I like it more as a platform, but it still just has some issues for me.  I think if the Nexus 5 2015 has a decent to good camera and a decent build then I might stick with Android. I guess I'd be willing to put up with battery issues if it has a decent battery, since M seems to be fixing some things too.  So you definitely are sticking with Android for the foreseeable future then?"
Android,3dxlkf,Izick,2,Mon Jul 20 13:02:34 2015 UTC,I'm 100% not switching back to iOS at this time. I didn't realize just how much I enjoyed Android until I went back to iOS and saw that it really just wasn't for me personally.
Android,3dxlkf,PolyethyleneAirbag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:38 2015 UTC,So you wouldn't recommend the iPhone I'm assuming?
Android,3dxlkf,Izick,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:24:40 2015 UTC,"I was given am iPhone 6+ for work. Sold my Nexus 6, two weeks of IOS, and I bought another nexus 6. Lol I was really not a fan."
Android,3dxlkf,The-Angry-Bono,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:22:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't get the iOS is more stable either. My house has an older iPad and a 6.  The iPad is slow on new OS version and I have minimal apps installed. The iPhone 6 is work phone and is (1) such a frustratingly basic UI - I want a back button! and (2) just wobbly as the old iPad with crashes.  My personal phone is a rooted S4A with Whizz Xposed hacks and Nova launcher which is very stable. In fact I can say it hasn't had apps crash in months.  The iOS story is very much from Android 2.2 on older phones vs. newest Apple release.
Android,3dxlkf,GnarlyBear,5,Mon Jul 20 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah the lack of back button annoys me to no end. Some apps support the swipe to go back, but definitely not even close to all, so I found myself randomly swiping and sometimes for nothing as it didn't work.   Most definitely older versions of Android weren't near as stable as iOS, but that's not the case anymore."
Android,3dxlkf,PolyethyleneAirbag,4,Mon Jul 20 18:26:11 2015 UTC,"As another switcher from Android, trust me, you're going to love iPhone."
Android,3dxlkf,autonomousgerm,6,Mon Jul 20 16:10:59 2015 UTC,Why do you feel that way? (Just very interested to hear people's input on the differences and their preferences.)
Android,3dxlkf,Izick,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:54 2015 UTC,"It has all the stuff you are expecting, stability, polish, immediate updates, and a great camera. The apps are superior, despite what anyone in /r/android will tell you. The ecosystem is better and the are usually the first to get truly usable technology (like home automation and Apple Pay). Android is incredible, and I love many things about it. I flip back and forth between the two, and I want them both to succeed, so I have a pretty unbiased opinion. If someone has lots of time on their hands, they can get it to do things the iPhone can't. I don't have time for that in my daily life, so the iPhone simply has a better out of the box experience. Try it, and if you don't agree, you can always go back to Android."
Android,3dxlkf,autonomousgerm,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:37:31 2015 UTC,That all sounds awesome!  So do you have an iPhone now or an Android?

Android,3dxlkf,Ncoder17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:47:39 2015 UTC,"No, I don't see a point in jailbreaking. You're potentially opening up the device to security risks to get basic functionality out of it. Plus a lot of my gripes with iOS wouldn't be resolved regardless."
Android,3dxlkf,PolyethyleneAirbag,4,Mon Jul 20 14:49:31 2015 UTC,"As an iOS user, I'm curious about what couldn't be resolved? I've never seen the point of jailbreaking ever since I switched from Android to my iPhone 5S."
Android,3dxlkf,Ncoder17,5,Mon Jul 20 15:12:05 2015 UTC,"Simple things, like for example I was using Inbox for Gmail, I'd get a notification that a new email arrived, I'd open Inbox and it was blank until it refreshed, so I had to wait a few seconds. Whereas on Android the email would be there instantly. The same can be said for Twitter, any app that's not Apple default. It seems so trivial, but it really affects the overall usage of the phone."
Android,3dxlkf,PolyethyleneAirbag,7,Mon Jul 20 15:15:02 2015 UTC,"That's the fault of whoever designed the mail app you're using, iOS has supported background app refreshing since iOS 8."
Android,3dxlkf,whythreekay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:25:03 2015 UTC,"That's a problem with Google's coding, not iOS. The APIs for an app to fetch data related to a push notification have been around for awhile now. Apparently Google just isn't using it."
Android,3dxlkf,DaytonaZ33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:37 2015 UTC,I hear what you're saying. Part of that is that Apple doesn't really have multitasking. It's more of a recent app list. Those apps can only run in the background for a few seconds at a time. That's how (in my experience) my iPhone gets better battery life than an android phone with a larger battery.
Android,3dxlkf,Ncoder17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:08 2015 UTC,"There's a really big shift in terms of how your organize your phone in both cases. In Android moving icons and widgets and making folders helps you organize yourself. In iOS, you need to configure your notification settings, and work out where you want your folders and how many pages you want and what each page/folder is for. I think that's the biggest problem with people trying to jump the gap. I personally prefer Android for more choice and a cheaper price. I might try an iPod Touch to see how iOS feels sometime later but my phone is probably going to run Android for a while."

Android,3dxlkf,PolyethyleneAirbag,-1,Mon Jul 20 12:30:18 2015 UTC,"The benefit is in the hardware - without having to account for the space for a physical depression Apple can pack even more stuff in there. Plus, no moving components is always a benefit.  If you view it as exactly the same as the previous setup then that's basically what Apple intended."
Android,3dxlkf,untogethered,3,Mon Jul 20 17:12:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree. After taking into account Apple's design habits, they'll just make the devices thinner because of the saved space."
Android,3dxlkf,ryan35310,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:24 2015 UTC,"Isn't it easier to use than a three-finger tap? Besides, the actuators in there open up the possibility for many other kinds of feedback, not just a click.    Could this very simple and very clever electromagnetic motor produce effects other than a fake click? “Most definitely,” Hayward says. In theory, the trackpad should be capable of yielding all sorts of illusions—clicks, indentations, holes, bumps, and other types of bas relief-like textures.   http://www.wired.com/2015/03/apples-haptic-tech-makes-way-tomorrows-touchable-uis/  Like the way they're testing it out in iMovie. “When dragging a video clip to its maximum length, you’ll get feedback letting you know you’ve hit the end of the clip. Add a title and you’ll get feedback as the title snaps into position at the beginning or end of a clip. Subtle feedback is also provided with the alignment guides that appear in the Viewer when cropping clips.”"
Android,3dxlkf,autonomousgerm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:58 2015 UTC,"On the Macbook, it's really not much different, especially since you can emulate force touch on older MacBooks with a three-finger tap.   It's cool because you can click anywhere on the track pad (like, on the absolute edge of the pad) and still receive the same feedback. If it was mechanical, it would be more difficult to click at that location."
Android,3dxlkf,inate71,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:52 2015 UTC,"The click isn't as ""deep"" as the old trackpad though. Maybe it would take some time to get used to it but I prefer the older mechanical style -- same for the keyboard."

Android,3dxlkf,Vince789,3,Mon Jul 20 12:13:06 2015 UTC,"It's different from having an actual pressure sensitive pad under the display. Software can only use certain cues to approximate data, but it really isn't that accurate (like I said before)."

Android,3dxlkf,Vince789,3,Mon Jul 20 12:30:25 2015 UTC,"Every modern smartphone has a digitizer. To implement force touch, there needs to be a pressure sensitive pad."
Android,3dxlkf,redthunda69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:43:29 2015 UTC,"It's incredibly crappy, it guesses based on the assumption that your finger will spread out and cover more area when pressed hard. So you could use your pinky and press hard but use your thumb lightly, and because the thumb has a bigger area it will say that it's pressed harder. It only works effectively when there is pressure sensitive displays which some phone do have but the majority do not."
Android,3dxlkf,Mista_Wong,2,Mon Jul 20 12:18:09 2015 UTC,"I actually replaced my navbar with an xposed module that does the fake force touch. Press with thumb over a larger area (like you said) and then drag up, down, right etc.   It works much better than any other navbar solution because unlike buttons or edge gestures, you don't have to reposition your fingers."
Android,3dxlkf,thehorsestaple,2,Mon Jul 20 14:57:58 2015 UTC,"I've played with this, and it seems to be getting those values based on the surface area of whatever is touching it. I could press on the screen really hard and I'd get an average touch, while pressing lightly with my thumb gave me a hard touch.   Still, the estimate is relatively accurate during normal use since when you lightly touch a device, only the tip of your finger touches the screen, and during a hard touch your finger tip gets squashed and thus you get a bigger surface area.  An impressive achievement nonetheless considering this is mostly software at work."
Android,3dxlkf,sarxion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"Galaxy Note II used a Wacom digitizer with 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity and this probably has increased over the years. I assume it might just be the pen, though."

Straight Talk is the more unique one of the bunch as it is a joint venture with Walmart.  Frankly, as someone who used Tracfone from 2002-2006, I'm amazed that they have smart phones at all. Even back then, their selection of phones was bottom-of-the-barrel. They didn't get the Moto Razr until a year or two after it first came out.  They get away with shit phones because they know their customers: People who absolutely cannot afford to sign a 2 year contract. For many of their customers, paying more than $30/month for minutes for their phone would be stretching the budget. Well, they get to pay the poor tax, where they're stuck with an inferior product with an inflated purchase price because, hey, it's good for the business's bottom line and they can't go anywhere else."

Either you're getting ripped off or you don't use data enough to justify owning a smartphone. I don't know how many older folks I've had to sell shit smartphones to on Tracfone (mostly Unimax MaxPatriots) because they were convinced they needed smartphones but wanted to use Tracfone because they were familiar with it.

Android,3dvwa2,MuddyGrass,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:04:37 2015 UTC,"In the US, ""unlimited"" data is usually some fixed amount of LTE, then it throttles down to 2G speeds, unless you pay $80 or more, of course."

Android,3dvwa2,moonknlght,2,Mon Jul 20 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"The thing with companies like MetroPCS, Cricket, StraightTalk, etc is that, while they offer LTE services, they throttle the speeds to 8mb/s.   Which is fine as long as the customer doesn't care. 8mb is perfectly capable of checking facebook, instagram, google something you don't know.   On my T-Mobile, I average around 35mb/s. I've gotten as low as single digits with full bars of LTE, and I've gotten as high as 95mb/s with 2 bars of LTE.  I still think they're all overpriced, and I hate how much I pay for mine and my wife's phones, but you do get what you pay for (more or less)."

Android,3dxijt,pixlbreaker,3,Mon Jul 20 21:55:08 2015 UTC,"It's safe. The TV was probably a CRT (cathode-ray-tube) monitor. They have metals in the screen which, when magnetized (which can happen just by leaving a magnet close to it) can cause electrons firing in the monitor to not reach where they're supposed to go.  Other places magnets can eff stuff up is on spinning hard drive disks, where the data is stored in magnetic materials where the extra fields casue data integrity to be compromised.   HDD storage is far to fragile for phones, so other more dependable materials are used, that are not effected by magnets. So, its all good."

Android,3du6e9,GNex1,58,Sun Jul 19 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"IIRC ""Moonshine"" was Google's internal-use codename for the icon standards when the first started talking about unifying the look of their products. It was sort of like an early draft of one of the aspects of Material Design (Project Hera was in a similar vein, I think there was a somewhat popular ""Hera Icons"" pack for a while even though Hera wasn't really about iconography). The blogs got a hold of the codename and it became a buzzword for the new post-Holo trend that Google was just slowly converging on, bit by bit. Of course, once the whole Lollipop/Material Design showcase happened, the old codename fell out of use.  This app seized the early-bird spot of grabbing the name when it was the talk of the town, and then they just stuck with it since they were already popular."

Android,3du6e9,Daniel15,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"What would be an example of plugin functionality you'd like to see that Nova lacks?  Also, an open source Nova would basically be what Cyanogenmod's Trebuchet is. Someone who wants to contribute to the theme of ""The AOSP launcher, with a lot more customization"" could pitch their work into Trebuchet and it would stay open for others to build on. These things only happen when willing/able people contribute, though.   Nobody here is saying that Nova's dev shouldn't be able to secure compensation for his work, but going open source would be a very foolish move for him, given that AOSP-clone launchers already mushroom up whenever the AOSP base upgrades. He'd basically be feeding all of his competition and there's a point where the FOSS model can become predatory downstream depending on how the upstream providers distribute their project."
Android,3du6e9,bull500,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:15:09 2015 UTC,More transition effects in the app drawer or homescreen switches. More app based integration like aviate. my color screen like themes. ^ all of this added/removed by the users wishes(so he/she can keep it light or as feature rich as possible).    Im not Saying Nova devs should'nt be rewards for their work. They have every right to put a price on their app after all the hard-work that goes into it.    But the possibility of the what nova can do can be really expanded once you have a user/dev/contributor system in place.    Also people will pay for stuff if they feel that it improves the overall experience on android.  If an opportunity arrives that they can invest on it/choose the set best set of features for the next version; many will definitely contribute to the development.

When you have an open environment, users/devs could write an unlimited amount tiny plugins that people can download for features they'd like to have in a launcher.

Over time the icons I use have become a pretty varied mix from different packs (I really like icons like moonshine's where the feel is ""material"", but there's not a standard shape/background/color scheme), so it's sort of a pain to pick a new default because the ones I set manually don't update unless I clear everything back to scratch. Even working with default sets, I usually end up scrolling the list and finding ones for apps I don't use, that I really like for the apps I have.  Double whammys have also come up in the form of an icon pack dropping an icon I like or updating it to a version I like less. Or, there have been times that I've uninstalled an app but assigned its icon to a replacement app first, and then that's a similar hassle to get that if I want to try anther one.  So, maybe I'll use this as a good reason to try poking my way around source/building and see if I can assemble an icon pack. Seems about as involved as when I used to follow beginner's app theming guides to tweak colors etc.  Edit: Oh, hmm, they just open sourced the icons themselves. Technically that doesn't help me at all since I could have just grabbed them from an APK for personal use. Ah well, back to looking for templates/guides on xda if I want to work on this. Given that the last few icon packs I've used have all used an identical UI for the app itself, I'm guessing there's a pretty robust template out there."

Siri is better at:    Geofencing; iirc it could combine location with time for reminders, and you could set reminders for when you leave a place, not just for when you arrive.  Music control: you could give a specific syntax to Siri to tell it to play a specific song, album, artist, or genre, or to shuffle. It would know that you were giving a music command, and look up whatever you asked for in your music library. If it didn't quite understand what you said, that's fine, it would find the closest match in your library and still usually be right. Telling Google to play music very often ends in it doing a google search for whatever you told it to play, and it doesn't accept any syntax to play an album, only a song or artist.  Better confirmation: Google Now has an annoying countdown before even doing something as simple as setting a timer. Siri would just set a timer immediately, and ask for confirmation immediately for most other things."

But it's just a business decision, Samsung must be making a healthy bit of extra profit off of sales of the higher capacity S6 variants, as people upgrade to get more storage. The mark up on storage increases is phenomenal, almost pure profit for the company. Once they were sure they could make the change without it impacting sales, they went for it.

Any more resolution at these screen sizes is primarily at the expense of performance with little benefit otherwise.  I personally wish my Tab Pro 8.4 was 1920x1200 so that it ran a little better than it does.  This new tablet line from Samsung might actually have a chance at performing really well, for once.

Android,3dvyzz,generalako,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:05:37 2015 UTC,"Nevertheless, this tablet is not worth upgrading to. And they have no reason whatsoever to downgrade, rather than upgrade, the resolution. The S6 1440p display is 20% more effective than the S5 display, despite having 80% more pixels. Samsung could have easily given us 3200x2400 with Exynos 7420, but even with the current one they could have gone significantly higher than 2048x1536, as the first Tab S has the same display technology as the S5. We've had that resolution since 2012 (same year Samsung made the first 2560x1600), when Apple released the iPad 3. At that time phones had 1280x720, and it was a completely rational idea that tablets would be in the forefront in hardware --    especially in resolution, given their larger screen and capacity for bigger batteries. And neither the iPad 3, nor the Nexus 10 (1600p) had any problems running their given resolution. Even in 2013, I had 1920x1200 on budget tablets like the Nexus 7."
Android,3dvyzz,Butterman1997,-1,Mon Jul 20 09:29:46 2015 UTC,I wonder if AMOLED yields decrease with increase in panel size and ppi. This would explain why AMOLED televisions are relatively expensive and uncommon.

I don't remember exactly what I though about it since I was too young to think about these kind of things, but I had until last year a pc at home with windows 2000 and xp in dual boot, and xp was a jump ahead in graphics and design. Probably not even close to Mac OS X 10.1 which came out in the same period, but still, not bad overall.  Mac OS has also probably aged better, thanks to apple maintaining the same language design and improving it slowly and consistently, but I feel that these days OSX and also iOS are a bit lacking on the design department (but maybe it's just me. I simply don't like many things of the design language apple chose, I prefer the material design and sometimes also the Modern design from MS (even though I find that it lacks a bit of white.

Android,3duk4e,smokeey,3,Sun Jul 19 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I suspected it had to do with CDMA.  Obviously that doesn't apply to the rest of the world."
Android,3duk4e,VMX,-2,Sun Jul 19 20:54:04 2015 UTC,But it is in every US model.
Android,3duk4e,Endda,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:05:41 2015 UTC,"Isn't it only present in the variant for CDMA carriers?  Either way, it's not used at all in the rest of the world I think.  We're receiving radio-related complaints from carriers all over the world regarding the S6 and its Exynos chipset this year."
Android,3duk4e,VMX,0,Sun Jul 19 21:12:13 2015 UTC,Shannon 333 is used in AT&T and TMOUS. Sprint and Verizon use MDM9x35.
Android,3duk4e,alphazero924,0,Mon Jul 20 00:03:41 2015 UTC,Samsung does not produce the proper LTE bands for the US with their ModAP series.
Android,3duk4e,VMX,2,Sun Jul 19 21:27:28 2015 UTC,"Ahh I didn't know.  In that case I assume the US models will be free from those issues.  However, if I'm not mistaken, chipsets which have a separate modem from the rest of the chipset used to have poorer performance because of the added latency, at least a few years ago. We saw some pretty wild increases in end to end latency of such chipset compared to fully integrated solutions.  I don't work in terminals so I don't know if this affects them more than usual in the US models than in the global/European ones, which use a fully integrated Samsung SoC."
Android,3duk4e,ZeM3D,8,Sun Jul 19 21:43:26 2015 UTC,especially after the numerous radio related issues that all operators are reporting with the Exynos chipset   Doesn't the S6 use a Qualcomm radio?   http://www.androidcentral.com/about-qualcomm-4g-sticker-your-galaxy-s6   :p
Android,3duk4e,VMX,0,Sun Jul 19 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"Not as far as I know, at least in the standard, international version.  Maybe they had to use Qualcomm stuff for some of the old CDMA stuff they use in some US networks, but that's only one or two networks in the world.  Edit: It's only for CDMA networks, as pointed out by smokeey here."
Android,3duk4e,llluminaticonfirmed,3,Sun Jul 19 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"after the numerous radio related issues that all operators are reporting with the Exynos chipset   What issues are these? I tried searching google and this sub but couldn't find anything, and I've been using the S6 for about a month now with virtually no issues."
Android,3duk4e,VMX,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:31:31 2015 UTC,"You won't find those things on the Internet.  I can't go into details about the Exynos especifically, but when these things happen (in general) you could notice your phone stuck without data connectivity, dropping voice calls for no reason, unable to move correctly between technologies (2G, 3G, 4G), getting stuck in connectivity loops which drain your battery quickly, etc.  Furthermore, if a very popular device (such as the S6) suffers from these kinds of issues, it can have a major effect on the network performance overall.  For example, if the device is missing a feature which prevents it from following the network procedures and move to the right frequency or technology at the right time, it could cause congestion issues which degrade the overall experience for all users, etc.  As said, you won't find this kind of things on the Internet as they're normally managed internally between operators, infrastructure vendors, device manufacturers and chipset vendors. They also cannot be tested by your typical tech website, as they don't own a mobile network to test on, and you need long-term testing (or a very large number of users) to detect them."
Android,3duk4e,Ice_Pirate,6,Mon Jul 20 10:54:43 2015 UTC,"Qualcomm is only capable of leading because it faces no real competition. It's pretty safe to say that with big names like nvidia, intel and AMD pushing for mobile SoC developpment that that lead will be short lived."
Android,3duk4e,Compulsive1,3,Sun Jul 19 19:44:30 2015 UTC,"That's not true.  Qualcomm has many competitors and you've cited some of them. The problem is, when operators and OEMs do an RFQ and all chipset manufacturers present their roadmaps, there's normally Qualcomm meeting almost all requirements, and then the rest of the pack miles behind.  I hope the situation gets better but let's not fool ourselves - Qualcomm is where it is because in the past few years they've done a hell of a job researching and developing their chipsets (especially in the radio department), which has taken them to a very comfortable position.  Let's hope competitors step up their game and catch up with them."
Android,3duk4e,Hustler_One,6,Sun Jul 19 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"Yep. Intel Subsidized the Zenfone to ""break"" into the market so i think we will start to see other chipset manufacturers doing the same thing... basically making deals with OEMs to include their chip onto a phone."
Android,3duk4e,funnyfarm299,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:38:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and this is also the reason why we don't see Nvidia anywhere near phone chipsets. Their chips are good in terms of processing power, but radio connectivity is completely different story.  People constantly forget that mobile chipsets are all about 2G/3G/4G connectivity, and they have no idea of the extent to which the quality and reliability of the chipset depends on that.  This is not just a spec race where you aim for the fastest processor like in PCs. Mobile connectivity is a very complex beast, and there are thousands of requirements and features that your chip needs to support in order to provide a smooth experience and play nice with the network in all possible scenarios.  They still have a long way to go, but I think Intel will be one of the first (if not the first) serious contender to Qualcomm in the near future, and hopefully the Zenfone will give them some good, real world experience to catch up and continue to improve.  I wouldn't want to be one of their testers though... I still have nightmares from my last non-Qualcomm device (Galaxy Nexus with its Texas Instruments chipset)."
Android,3duk4e,kokas22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:52:24 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say smokes considering an 801 based OPO gets up in the low 50k range. G3 if I recall is 801 and was getting 43ish out of the gate. Asus Zenfone for example falls right in line with the OPO 801 for the most part. Supposedly it even performs better than a S6 under sustained use (ie gaming/multitasking).
Android,3duk4e,bryster126,3,Mon Jul 20 13:40:36 2015 UTC,"we are sticking with the Oneplus One and Nexus 5 in our household until a clearly superior system comes out. Right now I don't see a reason to upgrade.    My wife would like a 5"" phone with similar performance as her Nexus 5, but better battery life. I'm happy with my Oneplus One performance and battery life. I don't think better screen resolution will make a difference for me. If Google comes out with a Nexus phone that is as smooth and lasts even longer than my OPO on a charge for $300.00 I might consider buying it. But if the new Nexus lasts the same time and has more pixels, which I can't perceive, I'm sticking with the OPO. My wife might get the new Moto G if it lasts longer on a charge than the Nexus 5. If not, we will just wait until the next generation of phones."

Android,3dugfa,JPhantom95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:55:55 2015 UTC,"There are signs. One is less battery time, but the most obvious one is uneven battery drain with jumps. This can be charging the phone to 100 % and then after discharging a bit the charge drops significantly. The phone can reboot when this happens and the battery can drop by several 10%. This can also indicate corrupt battery stats but it should even out on its own after a few full discharge cycles. If it doesn't, the battery needs to be replaced.   Other signs that are even more visible (if the battery is getting really degraded) is slight swelling of the battery. Batteries are designed as slim as possible, so if you can see or feel (carefully) any gas buildup under the protective plastic of the battery, replace it immediately!

Android,3dugfa,big_flapper,203,Mon Jul 20 21:52:02 2015 UTC,Non removable batteries are just another way of ensuring obsolescence. Nokia during their heyday (and moto before them) used to make all their batteries removable. Phones with removable batteries were the norm not the exception. Apple changed that and every manufacturer since has followed suit. From the consumer standpoint it makes no sense to make the part of the phone most susceptible to degradation inaccessible. Words like 'premium feel' just feel like a cop out. It's like sealing the hood of a car. A truly well designed phone would be sturdy AND easy to repair. I'd buy the premium feel argument if companies didn't make it incredibly hard to remove these batteries. I mean glue! Seriously?!? What's wrong with screws?
Android,3dugfa,fr33z0n3r,10,Sun Jul 19 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on all points. One thing worth noting is that the iPhone battery is actually pretty easy to replace in the most recent models, though. While you certainly won't be hot swapping batteries anytime soon, it is certainly within most people's reach (at least those who would even be having this conversation) to replace the battery once it is sufficiently degraded."
Android,3dugfa,sportscrazed2,9,Sun Jul 19 21:30:28 2015 UTC,I agree and think that wireless charging should also common.

Android,3dugfa,DrDerpberg,6,Sun Jul 19 21:49:26 2015 UTC,Sure but wireless charging is rather slow.   Good way to get in the habit of not losing your phone because it's always in same place.  Do you know what real wireless charging is? An external charger and spare battery.
Android,3dugfa,sportscrazed2,5,Sun Jul 19 23:57:20 2015 UTC,"wireless charging is rather slow   Doesn't really matter, because you never let your phone get all that low to begin with.

Android,3dugfa,flamingspartan3,4,Mon Jul 20 01:58:12 2015 UTC,"I would rather plug my phone in once for half hour than worry about putting it in exact spot every time.

I don't like setting it on a desk because i might pull it off with headphones attached still or trip over a usb cable and send it flying.  I think quick charge 2.0 is probably a better solution than wireless charging pads as it stands today.  Plus stuff like the mophie battery cases are true wireless charging.

If they refuse to do that i'd rather have either a removable battery for instant swapping, quick charge 2.0 which will charge my phone adequately in 30 minutes while i do something else, or one of those battery cases which is one less thing to lose and carry. I used to use wireless charging on my nexus 7 because i could drop it on my bedside table and have it charge while i slept.

Also the main reason they use glue instead of screws is probably because it's cheaper. Cheaper = bigger profit.   At the end of the day manufactures don't care about the small majority. They care about appealing to the majority and the majority wants a sleek sexy looking phone, not necessarily a functional phone.

Android,3dugfa,404redditornotfound,7,Mon Jul 20 12:12:46 2015 UTC,It makes phones thinner and allows you to make the battery a custom shape that fits wherever components aren't. That makes it easier to make it to a certain capacity.   Both of these are marketable. Removable batteries aren't.

That can be invaluable to be at 4% and just swap in a new battery. 4% to full in 30 seconds. There's no denying that value and for some whose jobs involve travel there really is no other option.   That said, I personally hate the way removable batteries make the aesthetics of most phones go to shit with the removable cover. In my experience one removable battery ≠ one internal battery in terms of capacity and overall health / life.  It is surprising that after all these years OEM's have yet to put slot-style batteries on phones."

Android,3dugfa,oklar,6,Sun Jul 19 18:22:57 2015 UTC,I think the question should be is what are the advantages of a non removable battery?  Besides metal bodies instead of plastic which if you are honest will probably be put in a case because it's a $700 piece of tech in your pocket that the entire front is glass.  It's advantageous to the manufactures because you'll buy a new phone just because your battery isn't as good as it once was.   If a pc manufacturer told me I could no longer replace my own power supply I would tell them to go fuck themselves.   I don't want to throw out a $700 piece of tech because something that would take 30 seconds and $20 max to fix is buried deep within.
Android,3dugfa,amorpheus,39,Sun Jul 19 23:38:15 2015 UTC,"Non-removable batteries allow for bigger batteries and a generally more efficient internal design. The phones tend to also feel sturdier, and it is easier to design them with higher grades of water resistance. Replacing the battery after a couple of years of degradation is generally still possible if you feel the need to do it, it's just something that requires more effort than with a user-removable battery.  Designing a phone with both removable batteries and non-plastic materials is certainly possible, but it is probably more expensive depending on how it is engineered. So far, a removable battery doesn't seem to be worth it from an OEM's perspective, with only LG continuing to offer it, and they use some rather low-quality plastic to keep costs down.  The people that do happen to use the feature often are very vocal about their love for it and consider it 100% necessary, but the same can be said about the people that loved physical keyboards. I don't think we'll have much of a choice within a couple of years, honestly."

Mostly it's due to design as you pointed out, but there are lots of phones where that's not the case, and more of an artificial limitation - my Nexus 5 basically has a removable back, it's just a PITA to get off and it annoys me that it would basically be the exact same phone with much better longevity if only that part were slightly different."

Android,3dugfa,mizatt,8,Sun Jul 19 17:45:42 2015 UTC,I think Apple had it right with the iPhone 4/5. Although not really designed for battery swapping at least the rear cover was held in place by two small screws on the bottom so it was trivial to remove and swap out the battery.

Android,3dugfa,AylaSilver,0,Sun Jul 19 22:22:39 2015 UTC,"This is right. If you're going to do a unibody design, you have to do it well. Apple did it well. The screen and the battery are the easiest-to-replace parts in the iPhone 5 and above. It's almost like they know which things people destroy most often, so they designed it such that repairs aren't impossible (this is good for repair centers and consumers alike).  The wrong way to do unibody design is the HTC way. The M8 was awful to take apart, but I remember the takeaway from the iFixit teardown was basically ""it's still horribly put-together on the inside, but at least it isn't the M7 where you have to destroy the metal casing to get inside of it"". And the M9 is no better. As always, HTC sets the bar as low as they possibly can."

I used to carry a spare battery in the dark days of early LTE Verizon phones (Droid Bionic, Galaxy Nexus...) where battery lasted around 8 hours. Nowadays I can't see myself doing that, but I'd still rather have a removable battery than not have one. The choice just makes sense to me.  Also, you say zero downtime but there's the downtime of switching out the battery itself, right? It's only like a minute but it's annoying to reboot, in my experience. It'd be cool if phones with removable batteries also had a tiny (~100mAh) internal UPS-like battery that could be used to keep it up while you swap the battery out. This will definitely never find its way into any mainstream phone, but I can dream."

I got a spare battery and an external wall changer for it... And I ended up getting another spare when my girlfriend at the time upgraded her Vibrant to something else (same battery model). There was something incredible about being able to so rapidly swap in a new battery to full charge, and toss the old one on the charger without tying my phone to the wall.  I also liked that when travelling I would usually have a battery with a bit of juice left in it for emergencies... Even if I drained all three.  Now I have a Xiaomi 10400mAh battery back and a oneplus one and I don't really mind not having the quick swaps... But given the opportunity I prefer them to tethering my phone to an external battery or the wall outlet.  I imagine that Quick charge helps reduce the negative aspect of being tethered to things... So perhaps my next phone will have that and make it more of a non issue.  While I appreciate the benefit of swapping the battery with age, I upgrade my phones often enough that it hasn't been too much of an issue. And now that I have a more secure revenue stream I imagine my upgrade addiction will be further enabled."

Android,3dugfa,Intermeadiate,3,Sun Jul 19 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"The obvious advantage is that you can go from 0 to 100% charge in like 2 minutes, which no charger is capable of. It's useful if you forget to charge your phone, or if you don't have access to a charger. You can buy aftermarket batteries that exceed the capacity of the default battery. If you're buying a used phone, or if your phone is getting old, or if you simply had bad luck with the battery lottery, then battery degradation is less of an issue. You don't have to worry much about damaging the back because you easily get a replacement.

And anyway, you can already buy microSD cards in huge capacities.

Android,3dugfa,404redditornotfound,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:26:10 2015 UTC,"Personally I had a few extra batteries for my Galaxy Nexus, and I used them sometimes on hiking trips for GPS tracking. Worked well enough to make some neat trail maps over the course of a few days. I never needed a spare battery to make it through the day, but if I was a heavier user I'd probably have used them that way (and also picked up an external charger).  I retired that phone for a moto G, which easily lasts me >2 days of regular use most of the time. I've used it for similar hiking trips and a single charge has supplied me with the equivalent of 1-2 extra batteries in my pack. So for me, the biggest thing is definitely having a phone that can go the distance in the first place. 2 day+ potential for regular use, plus a USB power bank seems ideal for me. Power banks seem so cheap and compact these days that I can't see myself carrying extra batteries the way I had imagined on my older phone.  That said, I appreciate that the ""non-user-replaceable"" battery in my moto G could be swapped with a ~$20 replacement just by taking out a few screws, it's right on the surface when you take the back cover off and is pretty much a 1/10 on the difficulty scale. I'd look for a similar design in future purposes. I like a minimal dose of planned obsolescence in my devices, so I'll vote with my dollars towards that end.  ...still waiting on project ara to prove itself to not be a dud, though. I'd be all over that concept in general, and if the battery is just one of many swappable components you'll hear no complaints from me."

Android,3dszut,muertex,3,Sun Jul 19 07:09:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I'm a 3D graphic artist, and small details like dust and scratches are not hard at all to make.  When editing a texture, the textures are split into channels. Most common being color, luminance, specular, reflection, bump, and alpha.  In this case, the scratches can be easily done by using the bump channel. The bump channel uses blacks and whites to determine how much a texture should show displacement, sometimes without actually showing displacement. (Fake 3D, games use this all the time, most noticable on floors and walls, but mainly everything)  The dust can be done by, yes, literally adding little tiny objects on the glass and environment.  Another factor would be the lighting, and this kind of lighting is especially hard to do, even by professionals if they are making the scene from scratch. So take a look at some renderers such as Octane or Maxwell! They do everything I just said and more, automatically. So even the noobs can create something as beautiful as this, especially since a lot of users and media centered people have some pretty decent computers, especially PCMasterRace. It doesn't take a professional anymore.  Edit: Confirmed a fake. Theres a water mark on one of the images, #BEESPLINE. He's Ivo Maríc on instagram. He's a CAD artist. He's also the guy who ever body was freaking out about over the last ""leak""."

It's apparently a common hardware manufacturing problem where the headphone jack's contacts can be so tight against the edge of a headphone plug that your phone receives false signals from what it thinks are headset control buttons/microphone that are sometimes included with a pair of headphones.  The fix that worked for me was turning off access to the headset controls.  If you run a custom ROM like Cyanogen there are built in settings to disable headset controls in the buttons/audio settings.  If you're stuck on the stock ROM, you can purchase Headset Button Controller on the play store and use that to disable them.  Doesn't hurt to try freezing the LG voiceover crapware with an app like Titanium Backup as well, but you need root for that one."

Over time, it gets worse to the point that the phone doesn't recognize the SIM at all, and is unusable. So I got the sim card replaced. Nothing changed. So I got the phone replaced.

I got it replaced one more time (the one im currently using) and it's happening again.   T-Mobile has acknowledged that more and more of the S4s have been having this issue, but all they can do is keep sending me new ones (two separate reps told me straightforward that there was a good chance they would keep breaking).

No contract, just upfront for the phone and then my monthly phone bill of $35.  But, since Nexus 5's are no longer in stock at Google, I had to be a ""manufacture refurbished"" one off of eBay. I thought ""eh, what the hell."" Should've thought twice before I did that.  The phone came. Worked well at first, then the data connection just shat itself. I couldn't get any internet access unless I was connected to WiFi, and that also meant no calls and no texts.  So, sent it back, got a refund. I tried another seller selling a Nexus 5 for the same price as the other one, hoping this one would be better suit.  Got it, and it worked for a bit longer than the first, but then WiFi shat itself and I could only get internet with mobile data, which would be fine if I wasn't limited to 3GB a month.

Android,3du1ct,CaretaTheSwedishBro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:23 2015 UTC,"I think I can speak for most note 4 users here when I say these defects.   1) GPS issues, no i don't mean the issues some phones have where it takes 15 seconds I stead of 5, if I leave this thing to try and get a gps signal, it will literally take 2+ minutes, and that's with full lte bars and on high accuracy.   2) camera focus issues, yea this camera refuses to focus until I shake it repeatedly really hard, tried getting it replaced by tmobile but to no avail because I tripped Knox and apparently the stores in my area actually check now.   3) auto brightness, I realize this is a os issue and not hardware, but seriously why can't the auto brightness fucking work right, it's always too bright in 0 lux readings and always too dark in daylight readings.   4) Multitask button. Also a software issue, but it seriously shouldn't take 4 seconds to bring up the recent apps screen  5) there are many various reports of having quick charge issues, like where the phone will not charge as fast as it should, or quick charge causes reboots, etc. I haven't experienced any of these... Yet. But I have experienced the battery issues, my phone used to shutdown at 15% every day. Never failed. It ALWAYS shut down AS SOON as it hit 15%, luckily there's a removable back on this phone, so 9 bucks and 1 week later all is right in the world.   Conclusion: the note 4 is honestly riddled with little and big bugs that will annoy the shit outta you, if you're looking for a rock solid device with no issues, keep going. This phone has any problems, but there are work arounds, like the squeezing of the sides to fix the GPS issues if u want a lock in 7 seconds every time. Or the build prop tweak to fix the Multitask button and also improve the ram management. And the xposed module to fix the auto brightness issue. Yes these work arounds work, but should you really have to do this to an 800$ phone to get it to work the way it should? No."

Basically, WhiteOS seems to add a slide up animation anywhere where there was previously lacking one, so you'll notice it (ironically) most often in google apps like G+ and Hangouts. Makes the whole phone experience just that much more fun to use.   There are a bunch of small but much appreciated aesthetic changes too. For example, when you go into Overview mode, the windows have smooth rounded corners instead of sharp edges. Same goes for pop up windows and boxes, like the reply window in Relay or the share window in G+. These visual changes are more in line with the Lollipop look imo"

Keep in mind that 6 hours SoT is regular for the iPhone 6, while you'd be lucky to get that much on most Android phones.  Shitty software is your opinion. iOS has always seemed smoother and better optimized to me, as evidenced by the fact that it runs just fine on 1GB of RAM. The ""tweaks"" that come with root and ""control"" over my phone always brought inferior camera quality in the case of ROMs and inferior battery life in pretty much all cases.

I'm the type of guy that likes to save music to my external sd card. I enjoy streaming music to my Chromecast, but of course, since I don't upload my music to Google music (I download music directly to my phone, not to my computer, so it becomes a pain to try uploading any of it), I can't stream it using the music app, which confuses me, since there are so many apps on the play store that are dedicated to streaming local files to your Chromecast.  On top of that, the more I used the app, the slower it got. It took a long time for it to load, and I became sick of having to use multiple apps to manage and enjoy my music.  That's when I finally gave up on the app. I switched to Shuttle Music Player, and when I saw the features available in Shuttle+, I switched over.  I've only been using it for a little while, maybe a few days or so, but I don't have much to complain about. If you listen to local audio on your phone, I would strongly recommend the app for you. You could also search for an alternative for streaming/backing up music. The app is has been snappy and easy to use, and if you really like it, and want all the features you could pay for the premium (Shuttle+). Obviously, if you can't/don't want to pay, but want all the features, you can find an apk online (although I'm pretty sure the dev won't be very appreciative of that)  Hopefully this might help you (or someone on this thread) out :)"

Android,3dtqdm,Meleagru,4,Sun Jul 19 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"I've owned every single Nexus phone from the original Nexus one, with the exception of the Nexus S and Nexus 6. After the battery on my Nexus 5 ended up lasting all of 6 hours before dying and I was fed up of the crappy camera, I decided to get something else and buy an LG G3.  I also own an LG G Watch R, and everything I use is heavily integrated with Google's services.  However, I'm starting to become really fed up with things not working exactly as they should. The battery life on my G3 has nosedived since it was updated to Lollipop. There is no news on whether it'll be updated to 5.1. The interface is often laggy and glitchy. For instance when I turn the phone on, sometimes it'll show the home screen before the lock screen flashes up on top of it – and this is the stock lock screen. 'Ok Google' from the lock screen takes several seconds between the noise telling me it's listening and the display reacting to it. On occasion I've been unable to answer a call because… well I don't know; sometimes the pick up button just doesn't work.  I want to blame LG for this – after all, they've put their layers of software on top of stock Android, and I had none of these problems with stock devices. However I also own a G Watch R, and…  For many weeks, navigation through the watch was completely broken. You'd be shown a message like 'starting navigation' for a few minutes, only to be told 'check phone to continue'. This complaint was widespread on Google's support forums but was unaddressed for weeks, and the issue appeared to be server-side. I think that the time it took for this to be fixed was unacceptable.  Similarly, for a couple of days we could not set reminders using our watches.  Sometimes the watch will recognise a command, pause, then announce 'disconnected' – even though it isn't, and I have good signal between the watch and my phone, and my phone and the mobile network.  Occasionally on the watch I'm unable to dismiss a timer… the UI just locks up and I end up with this device just vibrating on my wrist.  I'm really starting to get fed up with this. I bought an iPad Mini to replace my Nexus 7 because I was fed up with the complete lack of apps designed for tablets, and while iOS has its own issues, I've managed to continue using Google services with it even better than I could on my Nexus 7 – both in part due to app and hardware quality. Remember iOS has been running a newer version of Hangouts for weeks now, which Android hasn't yet seen.  I'm considering switching in a year or so to the iPhone and Apple Watch simply because I would value the peace of mind of knowing that when I receive a call, I'll be able to answer it. Or when a timer goes off, I'll be able to dismiss it. The only thing stopping me right now is money – my G3 and G Watch R cost around £480 in total; the iPhone and iWatch (that I would want) comes to £960 – so it would be precisely double the cost to me. But as I'm getting older I'm starting to appreciate and value my time more than I used to, and although it sounds incredibly cliché when talking about Apple, I want something that does 'just work'."

Because unlike most other technology, I'm kind of invested for year or two once I buy because otherwise the upfront cost is kind of crazy, and samsung has been going crazy with their SAMSUNG GALAXY S6 PLUS BONUS EDITION PART 2 REMIX bs that comes out like 3 months later, so I'll be too worried of a vr edition note 5 coming out like 2 months later that has the real screen, especially since rumor has it they're already testing 4k screens with the note 5, so if they had to put it off a note 5 plus seems very likely.

Android,3duv3i,ScruffyMuffler,26,Sun Jul 19 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"Very few people will actually care, for Android OEMs to truly bear the iPhone they need to improve the JPEG output as that's what most people would use.   After so many years, we've finally gotten to phones like the Galaxy S6 and LG G4 that can truly pose as real competition for the iPhone.   But I still have a feeling that the Apple iPhone 6S will likely blow the current flagships away, they've been doing so for quite some time."
Android,3duv3i,SACHD,2,Sun Jul 19 19:34:55 2015 UTC,"A mobile ISP (image signal processor) has a heck of a challenge in front of it and some of this stuff is very difficult.  If you look at the RAW files from any smartphone, especially ones taken in anything less than bright sunlight, you will see that they are very noisy because of the tiny sensors. They also have vignetting, geometric distortions and chromatic aberrations from the tiny lenses.  The ISP has to clean all that up without destroying the fine high-frequency information that carries the detail - and has only a split-second's worth of processing time to do it in and write the JPEG data to a buffer. Better algorithms take longer to run and need a more complex chip and there are bus bandwidth, heat, power consumption and size specifications that need to be met.  Apple (and to a certain extent Nokia) are top dog in this space IMHO and everyone else is still playing catch up. You'd think Samsung and Sony with their camera divisions would be killing it but somehow they're not. I definitely get the idea that things are moving in the right direction though so its just a matter of waiting and seeing."
Android,3duv3i,davew_uk,-12,Tue Jul 21 09:17:49 2015 UTC,"See the issue is the cameras don't suck because Google, they suck because the OEM. I think android would be wayyyyy better if people stuck to what they know. OEM is for hardware, and let Google do the software. We would have way better devices if everything was stock android. That way companies could focus time and money on hardware."
Android,3duv3i,toxicpaulution,22,Sun Jul 19 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"Actually this is one place I'm quite glad OEMs are stepping in, Google isn't even close to being good in the camera department.   For example you could compare camera quality of the HTC One M8 vs The Google Play Edition M8, the one that HTC's made wins out just about everytime over Google.   Samsung and LG have to totally managed to cripple the core user experience of Android, but they've also managed to improve in ways Google hadn't, mainly the CAMERA."
Android,3duv3i,SACHD,-9,Sun Jul 19 20:03:30 2015 UTC,"That's because the Google play editions weren't pure Google, also they wouldn't give the proper drivers to them. If Samsung and lg were forced to use pure android then they'd use the proper good drivers towards it. That's why they suck because they close source their camera drivers to only be used with touchwiz"
Android,3duv3i,toxicpaulution,8,Sun Jul 19 20:23:05 2015 UTC,GPE ROMs are not made by Google they are made by the respective OEM and the HTC M series has the HTC frameworks and drivers to use the same post processing as the non GPE version

Android,3duv3i,konrad-iturbe,5,Mon Jul 20 14:02:55 2015 UTC,"Apple will surpass. Considering Iphones already have great fast cameras, apple will probably include their own software that allows on device editing of raw, where as android still can't do this. Also, if they do support it, all their devices will end up having it, where as atm only few high end android phones do. Android just has a few 3rd party apps which allow editing on a phone or tablet.  But even then again probably most people that actually care to deal with RAW would be using dslr's. But I can see Apple could bring in their own software and make a cool easy to do stuff on ipads for example.  I even think Microsoft could surpass android in RAW too. Google to me still has too many bugs to fix first."
Android,3duv3i,booobp,9,Mon Jul 20 02:37:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, if RAW is going to be something that becomes mainstream, it most definitely needs to be easy for the user to manipulate. Apple will undoubtedly make that an easy process. I doubt they'll market it as RAW, though. They'll market it as something catchy. Everybody will know that Apple Adjust enables you to change your photos however you see fit, and most people will continue to have no idea what RAW is.  Google should take AutoAwesome and run with it. Regardless of whether they use RAW or JPEG as the base, they need to make it clear that it's a powerful adjustment feature that can do the magic for you, or allow you to do what you want."
Android,3duv3i,Freak4Dell,6,Sun Jul 19 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on that, Apple will definitely make it something catchy and I imagine something akin to Instagram filters.   Google really needs to add RAW editing into the Photos app. However, they've actually gone the complete opposite direction. It's downright insane that with the latest versions of Android they're adding RAW support, but at the same time they took all the editing power out of their Photos app. They're finally in a position to surpass Apple on Camera quality, but I feel they may lose their edge with this."
Android,3duv3i,quebecxico,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"""Captured on an iPhone 6"" says a lot more than raw, aparture, megapixels or image stabilization. Hate to admit it."
Android,3duv3i,davew_uk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"I think the benefits for the average user are limited right now.   The possibility is definately there for some enterprising manufacturer or third party developer to write a really good camera app that includes RAW processing as part of the package - with the right noise reduction, sharpening and post-processing algorithms the image quality would blow away any built-in ISP's JPEG engine.  However until such an app exists most people won't need or want RAW files unless they really enjoy downloading and post-processing their photos in Lightroom - so that's me, and about 10 other people on this planet it seems.  FWIW I had a play with a Nexus 5 over the weekend and the RAW quality was awful - the level of noise in the images presented a real challenge for even my most advanced noise reduction plugins (Topaz Denoise, Neat Image) and I couldn't get a good final image no matter what I tried.  With the Oneplus One however the RAW images are really very good indeed, on a par with a decent point and shoot at least. The Nexus 6 has the same sensor so I would expect the RAW files to be just as good. If someone wants to send some I'd love to take a look.  TL;DR at the moment I think the hardware isn't quite at the point universally where RAW would be worthwhile, and the software/UX is some years off."

Android,3drexu,WallyWinthrop,2,Mon Jul 20 02:28:45 2015 UTC,A bit of both really. Splitting up the image and slightly shifting the angle between each eye gives the illusion of depth and your phone's accelerometer tracks your head movement.

Android,3drnf9,notdeadyet01,8,Sun Jul 19 04:55:33 2015 UTC,"There's another incentive for developers to integrate with Permission Nanny that I forgot to list in the post - Not needing to request the permission at install time. Because 3rd party developers can now delegate their permission needs to Permission Nanny.  Imagine someone developed a social flashlight app that would show you the positions of other people turning on their flashlights nearby. It legitimately needs to access to the location permission, but when a user wants to install the app, s/he would need to grant that permission at install time. Without even experiencing any part of the app, s/he may feel uncomfortable to install the app.  This is where Permission Nanny becomes useful to developers. Devs who delegate all their permission requests to Permission Nanny would no longer need to request any permissions at install time. Users may feel much more comfortable and be more inclined to install apps which requires less permissions. Users can now also experience the 3rd party app for a while before granting the app permissions; a win-win situation for both parties."
Android,3drnf9,Flipper3,4,Sat Jul 18 22:56:37 2015 UTC,"Except Permission Nanny then is an extra bloatware for your phone and would make me highly un-inclined to install any new apps.  Why would I want to install apps knowing that they could be getting information that I don't want?  The reason for permissions is to allow each app to have separate permissions, not for one app to broadly control every single app.  There's a reason that flashlight apps don't need any permissions and all of the bloated ones in the app store are exactly why the Flashlight feature is now being baked into Android.  And getting all developers to switch over to Permission Nanny for a small subset of users is a mountain of a task."
Android,3drnf9,billynomates1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:44:34 2015 UTC,"You've misunderstood. Permission Nanny has only one job: to work exactly like Runtime Permissions, but available on all Pre-M devices; instead of granting all the permissions at install time, the user grants individual permissions at run time. Users will still know when a 3rd party app wants to access your data because Permission Nanny will display a dialog asking the user to grant/deny access, just like M's Runtime Permissions, but on any device.  The integrated demo app may help clarify your doubts about Permission Nanny; users do not grant any permissions during install time, forcing the app to run with zero permission enabled. Instead, users choose to accept or reject individual permissions when the app is running."

Android,3drnf9,lazyassedartist,13,Sat Jul 18 21:28:52 2015 UTC,"Indeed, malicious apps who want users to grant permissions during install time would never touch this. But this app was never intended for them; Permission Nanny was designed for the good devs, devs that would like users to experience their apps first with few or zero permission usage, devs who would like to give privacy controls back to the user.  Imagine a pre-M ecosystem where apps on the Play Store lists minimal permissions, where non-rooted users can also leverage the power of Runtime Permissions."
Android,3drnf9,bradley129,29,Sat Jul 18 23:27:50 2015 UTC,"I think the only way something like this would work would be if it was an xposed module or a custom rom feature, needing the devs to integrate it into their apps makes it almost guaranteed to never support apps that would have questionable permissions.

Android,3drnf9,wofa,6,Sat Jul 18 21:19:14 2015 UTC,"I wanted a solution that would work for non-rooted users as well, so that users on all operating systems could leverage Runtime Permissions.  Permission Nanny is actually the best solution for apps that legitimately need questionable permissions to function because when apps delegate their permission needs to Permission Nanny, they no longer need users to grant permissions at install time (Play Store), but at run-time! This provides 3rd parties the opportunity to let users install and experience their apps with zero or few permissions first, then ask for permissions to access a feature when apps really need it."

Android,3drnf9,krackers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:20:12 2015 UTC,That is correct. The best way I can think of at the moment is to deeplink the user to the Play Store and ask him/her to download the app and try again.

Basically every shooting mode in the camera for example is its own 50 MB apk active in memory. And every Samsung product seems to need the S-Pen stuff constantly active even though its not even supported. I even got Phone.apk on my Wifi unit. I mean there is a reason Samsung needs to hack the LMK functionality to get its shit performant.   In contrast though, I got to say after two Nexus tablets that Google Android is way to bare bones for most consumers and I find their updates really fucking buggy most of the time. Samy is in my experience relatively stable (of course they don't use .0 Android releases though).   Still, tablet is smooth after L, that a boy to Samsung."

Because the custom kernel I use for TW is noticeable faster (probably Interactive governor + dynamic FSync) but still stock L (debloated) was smooth for me.

Android,3dqo7c,HeroOT,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:34:36 2015 UTC,The only place I saw the claim removing screen area (compared to tab s1) is somehow good for web browsing was from people selling 4:3 tablets.
Android,3dqo7c,wurblr,0,Sat Jul 18 22:55:20 2015 UTC,Yeah sorry man. I've seen the browsing praise on a lot of threads (mostly on review threads of 4:3 devices). I don't peruse sale threads much so I cannot attest to your claim but I'm sure it happens. Makes sense they'd be well optimized for web viewing considering the popularity of the iPad. I'm intrigued but I do like my 16:10 Tab Pro.
Android,3dqo7c,HeroOT,3,Sat Jul 18 23:03:47 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the downvotes. I have owned both aspects ratios and found 3:4 to be a lot more useful on a tablet. Viewing photos, browsing, emails, redditing, reading books and papers, so on and so forth.   I'm really glad Samsung has finally learned this with both Tab A and Tab S2 lines."
Android,3dqo7c,felipelessa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:25:02 2015 UTC,"The iPad has nothing to do with it. Simple math tells you that the same diagonal length with a 4:3 aspect ratio gives you approximately 12% more screen area than one with the same diagonal length but a 16:9 aspect ratio. Furthermore, in portrait mode, you will have significantly longer horizontal space for text so the reader's eyes don't have to move down and left as frequently, and that makes a difference for longform reading. At tablet sizes, this longer horizontal space isn't long enough to make the eye travel to the left tiring when going down a line, which is a factor only really noticeable for large desktop monitors."
Android,3dqo7c,RequiemDK,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:23:08 2015 UTC,"Me too, that aspect ratio makes it an instant win for me.

Android,3dqo7c,generalako,-32,Sat Jul 18 18:15:05 2015 UTC,"Lol, you really aren't bright are you? They don't implement SD card support based on ""space"" on a device. You could easily put 1TB in a phone's internal memory without sacrificing more space.   They went away from it because of UFS 2.0, which brings 3-4 times faster random reading and writing speeds. Basically what that means is that the gap between internal memory and SD cards, which is already big, gets even wider. Using SD cards will therefore prohibit the performance of the tablet itself.  If Tab S comes with UFS 2.0, which it should if it has Exynos 7420 (or later), and SD card support, then you should try it out and see what I mean."

Android,3dqo7c,Teethpasta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:45:20 2015 UTC,An SD card in no way slows down a device and only even enters the picture when you are doing something that involves something stored on there. Pictures and audio or video files will not at all be bottlenecked by an SD card and will load off of it just fine. An SD card won't affect the OS or any apps on the ufs 2.0 storage.
Android,3dqo7c,CervezaPorFavor,0,Mon Jul 20 00:54:03 2015 UTC,This. I don't understand why people keep saying that UFS 2.0 is the reason for the removal of microSD support.   They could just put up a warning not to store application data in the microSD card and only use it for digital media.
Android,3dqo7c,Teethpasta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:21:40 2015 UTC,Because that's what marketing told them to believe and the ignorant bought it.

Android,3dqo7c,xxTheGoDxx,10,Sat Jul 18 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"I don't want no fucking 4:3 screen!!! Best Regards, current Galaxy S 8.4 user.  EDIT: I know some of people prefer them and have good arguments for it, but for me its basically less scree real estate with the same device dimensions, because most of the use cases I care about benefit more from a widescreen display than a 4:3 one of the same width, among those videos, landscape browsing and games. I read only novels (epub) so that is not a problem for me, besides the line lenght is even in portrait about the same as a paperback (tested with SoIaF). Comics is the only thing that I do that would benefit from that aspect ratio."
Android,3dqo7c,Godflow_,5,Sat Jul 18 18:42:03 2015 UTC,Actually the 8.4 and 10.5 Tab S are the most optimal ratios for comics single page. The dimensions are really close to comic book page as opposed to 4:3
Android,3dqo7c,xxTheGoDxx,4,Sun Jul 19 02:55:40 2015 UTC,"True but the 8.4 is just a little bit to small horizontally in portrait to read comics for me so I just zoom in a little bit (the app I use let's you jump inside the zoomed page quiet nicely, I might actually prefer it that way to not get spoiled by future panels).   The 10.5 it's probably the best electronic comic reader on the market (that AMOLED screen can really shine there thanks to the deep black parts of most comics and the vivid colors)."
Android,3dqo7c,Godflow_,2,Sun Jul 19 03:02:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have the 8.4 too. I love it for comics since it's so lightweight and portable. Yeah few times I have to zoom in on double page spreads but overall im really happy reading comics on it. Mangas are no brainers.   10.5 Tab S is actually the best for comics but not as portable (i take the 8.4 to coffee shops, the subway, parks, etc) and Marvel Unlimited works great on it (3 month free sub is awesome too). Reading comics in Amoled is just the best thing ever."
Android,3dqo7c,RequiemDK,2,Sun Jul 19 03:19:00 2015 UTC,"Ignoring your other points here, but... math says that a 4:3 aspect ratio will give more screen real estate than a 16:9 or 16:10 aspect ratio with the same diagonal. It's really not that hard to analyse quadratic equations =.="
Android,3dqo7c,xxTheGoDxx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:11:56 2015 UTC,"That is true but the diagonal isn't important in daily use, is it? The current 8.4 model has a small enough width that I can easily put it into one of the back pockets of my (baggy jeans without a problem. A device with the same width but a 4:3 ratio have less screen real estate while a device with the sane heights on the other hand has more. The S2 will have less screen real estate (btw both new models have a smaller diagonal).  Of course if we only look at the diagonal 1:1 would be the best aspect ratio."

It's been heavily debated if flac makes a noticeable difference with highend audio equipment but if you're listing directly from your phone it won't."
Android,3dr1wi,HubbaMaBubba,3,Sat Jul 18 23:40:55 2015 UTC,It certainly does make a difference if you're using a external DAC with your phone even some with the built in DAC.

The wire doesn't bother me when I listen to my music which is in FLAC quality. So it's objectively better by definition of measurable fidelity and audible noticibility. Might not sound much different to you but it does for me very distinctly therefore for me, its subjectively better. BT isnt perfect as you say, but for me its not good enough (most of the time)."

Android,3dssmf,iEmerald,10,Sun Jul 19 11:52:00 2015 UTC,"Actually I disagree with you. Touchwiz has really matured with the release of S6. I've been using it for about a week now and I've never experienced any issues, slow downs or lags at all! Except the UI is still horrible and the updates across different S6 versions are inconsistent. Some people in my country got the 5.1.1 update and I still haven't even though we have the same versions and both are carrier unlocked."
Android,3dssmf,Surokoida,2,Sun Jul 19 11:57:45 2015 UTC,"Well i agree, they really improved!  Im not a fan of the UI/Ux/Design though, but some people like it, some dont.   I also gotta admit i only saw a S6 once and couldnt play around with touchwizz and mostly only can rely on videos/posts people make.   For example one guy tested how fast the play store was loading on his s6 and his nexus whatevermodel.  Although the s6 is definitely fastet in terms of hardware it made too many draw cycles and loaded slower.   Maybe i wouldnt notice it in daily use, but somehow i cant really understand it.

Samsung is even updating their Note 2 - a 3 year old device - to Lollipop in most regions. No other manufacturer is doing this.
Android,3dssmf,P0llyPrissyPants,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:32:37 2015 UTC,"I think those ""Most"" manufacturers don't include Sony.    Why didn't they update their Galaxy S3 to KitKat?

Android,3dssmf,a5ph,3,Sun Jul 19 13:40:59 2015 UTC,Yes but the international Galaxy S3 had only 1 GB of RAM. For 2015 or even 2014 that's pretty low and no other 1 GB RAM phones other than the Moto G were updated to Kitkat.

OIS and the F/1.8 aperture make it an incredible experience, especially in low light. In addition, OIS make it good for action shots because it compensates for shake.

Android,3dprjf,Gajeel_,2,Sun Jul 19 12:54:10 2015 UTC,"I have since upgraded from that dark place :). Honestly it's just the poor partitioning on Huawei's part. The phone has 4GB of internal storage but it's partitioned in a way where 2GB is for data/media, 1GB for system OS, and 1GB for apps. If they made it  in such a way where all 4GB is for apps or it's a ""virtual"" partition like most other phones, it would still work decently."

Android,3dprjf,sagar1101,43,Sat Jul 18 13:55:45 2015 UTC,How the hell do you get surveys? I've had it for like two years and haven't gotten a single survey
Android,3dprjf,standbyforskyfall,63,Sat Jul 18 15:14:34 2015 UTC,This discussion usually pops up every time someone brings up that app but the general consensus is that if you're a younger white male or a liar you don't get many (or any) surveys. However if you're a young sassy woman who don't need no man (or are just a female in general) you tend to get a lot more surveys.
Android,3dprjf,bakabakablah,29,Sat Jul 18 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"What sucks is you can't re do the first survey. Like, I was 15 or 16 when it came out. I'm 18 now and could actually answer half of those questions, but I'm out of luck because the app came out when I was younger."
Android,3dprjf,mibikin,16,Sat Jul 18 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"Add another Google account to your phone. Install the app again, and it gives you the choice to pick which account you want to use to get your credits on.

Android,3dprjf,TeutonJon78,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:33:11 2015 UTC,Try clearing the app data. I retook the first demographic survey 3 or 4 times before I started getting surveys with any frequency. I had the app for like a full year before that and never got a single one. Just don't be a young 20-something white male programmer...

I bought Chaos Rings sometime ago and it doesn't run on anything I currently own and Square has seemingly no plans to fix it.

Poweramp is still good, but it stopped adding new codecs and any real enhancements years ago, all pending an audio engine rewrite and a separate UI rewrite. There even a whole 6/4 PowerAmp takeover even that ended up being just a give-away, as the mentioned 64-bit audio hubbub hasn't shown up yet.

I'm in what I'm sure is the most common demographic (young male), buy I've made about $30 over 2 years. It isn't an extremely large amount of money, but it's enough for the amount of apps I buy.

I really really like the gestures feature on my Liquid Smooth KitKat rom for my GS3. And the only thing separating the pay app from the free version is the ability to make custom gestures like I do on the LS rom.  The thing that's been preventing me from buying it? It's price. Before it was like $5 CAD which is hella expensive to me. I just checked now and it's $6.97. Holy shit.

I'm not sure about the app that I mentioned but on my rom all I have to do is swipe from the very middle of the left edge of the screen (customizable) on any screen (it brings out a darker transparent blank screen), draw on the gesture and it launches right away.  For clarification, the name of the feature is called Gesture Anywhere:   Settings.  Some of the gesture I use. So i you see on the youtube or tasker gestures, there are very specific ways I write those gestures. So that's why I need to be able to make custom gestures."

Ah... Apple the inventor of light. ALLL HAIL APPLE. MAY WE BASK IN YOUR NEWEST INVENTION WOODEN TABLES.   Take a closer look at the Mi 3’s camera lens, however, and you’ll see it was quite obviously pulled straight from Apple’s Aperture icon.   Or the photoshop guy was told to spruce up the camera, search for aperature and found Apple Apperature logo and used it by accident.  Nope that sounds too ridiculous what happened was this  ""Hey, photoshop guy, our products need to sell more and to do so we found that having our camera lens be the icon from the Apple Aperature software which no one in China has probably ever heard will help sell it.""

The reason I didn't include phones is design choices on them are so difficult to track down.  If they included a Finger Print sensor would I say they copied Apple or Motorola? After all motorola came first.  I mean likewise I could say Apple are copying Xiaomi for using bigger screens on their devices, so whenever someone makes a comment like yours I ask a very simple question. Find me an Xiaomi phone which copies something from Apple which must meet these requirements  -The design/idea was not previously on another phone(e.g a camera)  -You cannot be vague, you have to be specific/ridiculous (e.g duh, both white)  -You cannot suggest ergonomic choices as a point of copycatting(e.g iPhone 6 copied Nexus for it's rounded edges)  I'll wait."

Android,3dpu0b,FloppY_,15,Sat Jul 18 13:54:27 2015 UTC,Sounds like you shouldn't do that a whole lot. High temps will age your battery much faster. If you want to fast charge then try to avoid heavy loads or just disable fast charging while you use the phone.  EDIT: I'm not saying to NOT use fast charge I just mean to mediate it. I use it all the time but I never have issues with heat because I never put my phone through much while it's fast charging. Especially if it has no signal and it goes into tower panic.

Everyday quickcharging just gets slightly warm, nothing to worry about.  Fast charging is so convenient though. Easily one of my favorite features on the phone. I know there are a lot of myths floating around about battery damage, but last article I read it was better to quick charge than charge too slow. But who knows. The only thing that is certain is that batteries get worse over time and heat is certainly a factor in that. I'm going to trust that Samsung has designed their quick charge in a way that doesn't kill the battery faster than it should.  I wish they'd kept the replace-able batteries for peace of mind. But I'm sure it's not entirely impossible to replace as proven by previous ""closed off"" phones."

Android,3dpu0b,RedskinWashingtons,-1,Sun Jul 19 10:15:14 2015 UTC,The increased heat while charging is a natural result of Samsung Fast Charging / Qualcom Quick Charge 2.0  In general faster battery charging results in more degradation of a battery over time.
Android,3dpu0b,Miadhawk,2,Sat Jul 18 20:04:35 2015 UTC,The M9 gets pretty hot if you game on it and quick charge at the same time. I think the M9 tries to spread the heat throughout the aluminum of the whole phone which definitely cools it down considerably.

I saw a YouTube video of the S6 vs Z3+ recording 4k, where he took temperature using CPU-Z, and the S6 was about 10C hotter at the end. Are these ""overheating"" issues that are linked to the 810 a mixture of bad press and maybe the Samsung Exynos having a higher throttle temp?"
Android,3dpu0b,sidneylopsides,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:23:37 2015 UTC,"AFAIK video recording is done mostly by the ISP, not the CPU Cores or GPU Cores  The 810 overheating is due to the CPU cores, not the ISP  But I think both the Z3+ and S6 use external ISPs (not on the same die as the SoC)  Maybe they record 4K at different bit rates, a higher bitrate could lead to more heat (more data to process)  Or maybe its due to eMMC vs UFC, 4K recording causes a huge file transfer, maybe the 7420's UFS controller gets hotter than the eMMC controller in the 810  It would be interesting if a major site did an investigation into that, mine were just guesses, take them as tiny grains of salt"
Android,3dpu0b,Vince789,28,Sat Jul 18 10:31:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It's interesting that that linked test shows the S6 getting hotter as well. It might be that Samsung are happier with the Exynos at a higher temperature than Qualcomm are with the 810 temps, so throttling kicks in at different temps."

Android,3dpu0b,ReadThatAgain,2,Sun Jul 19 23:41:21 2015 UTC,"Was there a graph?  What probably happened was the 810 was running a higher temp than the exynos pretty much as soon as it was exposed to load, leading it to reach throttling temperature and it cooling back down much sooner, while the exynos chip had not reached throttling temperature and continued getting hotter.

Ideally you would have a graph for each device that showed CPU load, clock speed, and temperature from idle --> to peak load --> hold load to see if they throttle --> ramp down to idle to see how they go back to idle temps.

Android,3dpu0b,DylanFucksTurkeys,0,Sat Jul 18 13:47:15 2015 UTC,"Well they will have to work around the flaws somehow, as the SD810 is the only choice until the SD820 comes out. What other choice do they have? Mediatek is also stuck at 28nm until the Helio X20, Exynos is not really available to them. Intel's Cherry Trail is actually a real alternative, I'm surprised no other phone OEM has picked it up so far.  Personally I think underclocking is the way to go. Semiconductors require increased power as their operating temperature goes up, so if the temperatures could be kept under control in the first place they won't throttle so bad."

The above paragraph is a load of speculation. Anyways, my Apple Macbook Pro gets hotter while streaming video than my M9 ever has.

Android,3dpu0b,Domenicoh,2,Sat Jul 18 20:43:24 2015 UTC,The issue with the 810 is that it throttles much quicker and still reaches these high temperatures. It's just a dank meme to simplify it into overheating.
Android,3dpu0b,soapinmouth,-1,Sat Jul 18 17:34:30 2015 UTC,"If there Snapdragon phones were throttling that quickly, they wouldn't be maintaining the same FPS as the S6, which is what's happening in the linked test."
Android,3dpu0b,avitaker,2,Sun Jul 19 03:45:04 2015 UTC,Where it's capped at 60
Android,3dpu0b,soapinmouth,0,Sun Jul 19 03:59:36 2015 UTC,"Whaaa? So to summarize your points, the S6 gets hotter because it throttles slower, and is getting hotter at a capped frame rate. Meaning... it's getting hotter trying to do the same thing as the other phones, yes? It would be cooler if the frame rate wasn't capped?"
Android,3dpu0b,avitaker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:15:50 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is they both get similarly hot, but the 810 is throttled to get there, why is that so difficult to understand. Google any article about the 810 overheating/throttling if you can't understand it from me.  Actually there is a direct m9 vs s6 throttling comparison out there should make things easier."
Android,3dpu0b,soapinmouth,2,Sun Jul 19 05:14:00 2015 UTC,"If the M9 is throttled to reach a lower temperature than the S6, then how do they have the same FPS? That means the S6 must be getting throttled as well, or it means the M9 has a better processor, even when throttled, which isn't the case. So the S6 is being throttled just like the M9 and they both end up at about the same FPS."
Android,3dpu0b,yoitsjustin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:54:59 2015 UTC,The Adreno is faster than the Mali so the M9 can throttle but still perform solidly.
Android,3dpu0b,beno619,0,Sun Jul 19 07:12:00 2015 UTC,So M9 is being throttled more but still outperforms S6 with FPS and temp?
Android,3dpu0b,yoitsjustin,2,Sun Jul 19 14:09:57 2015 UTC,Like I said they're capped at 60..
Android,3dpu0b,soapinmouth,0,Sun Jul 19 06:02:56 2015 UTC,Are they both capped at 60?
Android,3dpu0b,yoitsjustin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:14:57 2015 UTC,All three are.
Android,3dpu0b,soapinmouth,0,Sun Jul 19 07:07:04 2015 UTC,"Oh my god. Throttling=limiting performance because load is deemed too heavy for whatever reason. In the case of the M9, throttling is done to reduce surface temperature. So, if the temperature gets too high, then the CPU is throttled.  If the devices are capped at 60 FPS (I don't know where you're getting this from anyways), that means that both the S6 and the M9 are going to render at a max of 60 FPS, correct?   If the M9 was throttling to reduce temperature, that FPS would come down. However, in this case, the FPS of both the devices is nearly identical. That means we can remove performance (or throttling) as a variable.   The only other variable in this test is temperature. According to this test, the S6 reaches higher temperatures while doing the same tasks as the M9. This has little to do with throttling because the article specifically says that all the phones didn't seem to have to throttle."
Android,3dpu0b,avitaker,0,Sun Jul 19 06:33:04 2015 UTC,"Oh my god. Throttling=limiting performance because load is deemed too heavy for whatever reason. In the case of the M9, throttling is done to reduce surface temperature. So, if the temperature gets too high, then the CPU is throttled.   No shit. What's your point?   If the devices are capped at 60 FPS (I don't know where you're getting this from anyways), that means that both the S6 and the M9 are going to render at a max of 60 FPS, correct?   You think all three phone just happen to get almost exactly 60 fps  on nfs? It's either got vsync on or it's caped at 60 probably the former, but point still stands. Yes.   If the M9 was throttling to reduce temperature, that FPS would come down. However, in this case, the FPS of both the devices is nearly identical. That means we can remove performance (or throttling) as a variable   Not if it can maintain 60fps even at a reduced clock.   The only other variable in this test is temperature. According to this test, the S6 reaches higher temperatures while doing the same tasks as the M9. This has little to do with throttling because the article specifically says that all the phones didn't seem to have to throttle.   See above, discredited.  What are you trying o prove? That all the hundreds of articles are wrong about the throttling on the 810 because of this one incredibly inaccurate temperature test? LOL"

Android,3dpu0b,soapinmouth,0,Sun Jul 19 06:06:51 2015 UTC,"If it throttles quicker they're still reaching the same place in a few minutes... They both end up with about the same FPS and the S6 ends up warmer. If it throttles too quickly, how is that a problem if they end up at the same average FPS?"
Android,3dpu0b,yoitsjustin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:52:54 2015 UTC,Because NFS doesn't put much stress on either phone.
Android,3dpu0b,soapinmouth,0,Sun Jul 19 05:56:49 2015 UTC,4k recording most definitely does though. Doesn't 4k video result in some Sony phones actually shutting down due to overheating?
Android,3dpu0b,yoitsjustin,4,Sun Jul 19 05:58:01 2015 UTC,"Sure it does, but both phones are still capable of maintaining the 30fps recording needed even when throttled, that's all this proves."
Android,3dpu0b,soapinmouth,-2,Sun Jul 19 06:00:15 2015 UTC,All this proves is that the M9 doesn't overheat or throttle any more than the S6. People have been literally avoiding purchasing S810 devices because they throttle or overheat. Both of which are false after looking at this article!
Android,3dpu0b,yoitsjustin,2,Sun Jul 19 06:16:57 2015 UTC,"How on earth does that prove anything related to that? All this article showed is the phone can maintain 30fps 4k video and 60fps in need for speed, oh and what temperature it does it at. You are in some serious denial."
Android,3dpu0b,soapinmouth,3,Sun Jul 19 07:08:34 2015 UTC,The S6 gets hotter than S810 devices in many cases! The difference is there's a humongous Samsung circlejerk on /r/Android and Samsung using a different processor than a Snapdragon resulted in false rumors like overheating.

Android,3dpu0b,acondie13,2,Sat Jul 18 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"Why the article is useless, it doesn't show anything about throttling which is the actual issue, it overheats even when it's not running at max capacity and has to throttle just to maintain a decently high temperature. Of course the dank memes about frying an egg oversimplify the issue."
Android,3dpu0b,soapinmouth,0,Sat Jul 18 17:39:16 2015 UTC,"I do kind of wish heat design was a bigger concern. I can barely use my Nexus 6 as a GPS because if I mount it on my dash and have GPS with the screen on it gets so hot it starts throttling the CPU down to 600 MHz. Once I can get the power wires rerouted I'm going to try sticking it in front of one of the AC vents, but I'll probably have to move it again in the winter so the heat isn't blowing directly on it."

Finally figured it out (or at least found a way to fix it): changing the local network/homegroup local media sharing settings and disabling it. Maybe it kept trying to keep the connection to the Xbox One on my network open... not sure.   A related item you can check is disabling your LAN card's Wake on LAN, Magic Packet, and Pattern Match settings to disable them, as well. I believe I was still having an issue with these even after I set the LAN card setting under the Device Manager not to allow it to wake the device.

If the media sharing setting you're referring to is the one under the advanced power configuration setting, yeah, even with that set to allow sleeping didn't matter when it was doing it for me.   I don't have any real evidence that it was anything to do with the Xbox—it could have been any of my devices on the network... or maybe it has nothing to do with them, I honestly don't know, but I was just happy that it correctly sleeps and hibernates, now.   I really doubted this could be it because I only used Plex to stream from my computer but it happened even without Plex running... I only tried it because I was getting annoyed and desperate.

What its missing is just about everything - hotkeys and key word detection, refinement of the notebook system, driving directions seem to be missing, voice recognition doesn't feel as good as google now's, voice feedback on actions..... Its a beautiful start and from what I understand all this is present on windows phone, so its just a matter of time before it gets properly implementation in android.

Android,3do9zg,FevaForDaFlava,9,Sat Jul 18 03:22:29 2015 UTC,Well the S6 was already extremely light and thin. A few MM and ~40g*more (just a guess) wouldn't be a huge deal in comparison to what you're getting in return
Android,3do9zg,UJ95x,27,Sat Jul 18 04:28:10 2015 UTC,"Its 15.24 mm thick, that's double the thickness, probably a deal breaker for some"
Android,3do9zg,Vince789,2,Sat Jul 18 05:36:25 2015 UTC,"Then again for those that are used to a note with a zerolemon, it's still quite compact."
Android,3do9zg,theadvenger,2,Sat Jul 18 17:48:58 2015 UTC,I nearly broke my toe when I dropped my zerolemon note 3.
Android,3do9zg,hjb345,2,Sun Jul 19 18:01:51 2015 UTC,I find a bit of shoulder pain after having it in my shirt pocket all day.  I actually have started to put it in my front pants pocket.
Android,3do9zg,theadvenger,2,Sun Jul 19 18:21:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, explaining the awkward bulge never gets old"
Android,3do9zg,hjb345,7,Sun Jul 19 22:18:45 2015 UTC,Maybe. But I already know a bunch of people who use really bulky cases. Having one that also added 150% the battery life and expandable storage would be worth it for them
Android,3do9zg,UJ95x,23,Sat Jul 18 06:01:06 2015 UTC,But not that guy.
Android,3do9zg,muertex,4,Sat Jul 18 08:08:49 2015 UTC,40 ounces more!?  So 2.5 pounds.
Android,3do9zg,Solkre,4,Sat Jul 18 06:24:57 2015 UTC,Sorry. Grams*
Android,3do9zg,UJ95x,0,Sat Jul 18 06:27:59 2015 UTC,"If I get a full day of use out of a phone, as a person who has very easy access to a charger at night, I'm not going to bother with any extended battery stuff. Especially one that adds a heavy, bulky case to the phone.   While on that point, I've never gone over 18 GB on my phone's internal storage, so that's not a concern wither."
Android,3do9zg,rainydayseveryday,3,Sat Jul 18 16:31:27 2015 UTC,40 / 16 = 2.5.  Learn2Math
Android,3do9zg,sivak1rl,2,Sat Jul 18 13:04:39 2015 UTC,"For me, I just don't need the battery...never run mine down.  The reason I'd want it separate is purely size and financial...I can't help but think that something that just added the SD card option would be smaller and cheaper."
Android,3do9zg,Crow-T-Robot,-4,Sat Jul 18 13:49:27 2015 UTC,There's been some odd cases of fires when Samsung phones are paired with non-official batteries.
Android,3do9zg,JacksterTO,2,Sat Jul 18 03:49:47 2015 UTC,non-official internal batteries.
Android,3do9zg,teamhoun,3,Sat Jul 18 04:24:21 2015 UTC,It's called USB otg.  But I prefer to have  the SD card inside so I don't have to worry about breaking USB port.   Maybe when USB c is commonplace someone can make a thin ribbon cable otg adapter that fits nicely under a tpu case and you don't have to worry about it.   Then you would have the advantage of using full sized SD cards.   But that would bring up question of charging
Android,3do9zg,sportscrazed2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:17:45 2015 UTC,"I use that too, but I want it just go be without the battery so it isn't so bulky"

Android,3do9zg,stereosteam,2,Sun Jul 19 00:07:56 2015 UTC,I remember hearing that Sony open sourced their drivers. It has been a while though. They could have just released them. Samsung still hasn't released any of their drivers for phones.

Android,3do9zg,FiendFyre498,28,Sun Jul 19 11:04:21 2015 UTC,$90 is kind of pricey.
Android,3do9zg,Release_the_KRAKEN,14,Sun Jul 19 11:08:23 2015 UTC,And it's only 3700mAh. Can you quick charge with an extended battery though?
Android,3do9zg,super_octopus,24,Sat Jul 18 00:20:44 2015 UTC,"Well 3700mAh is not bad considering the internal battery is only around 2500 (I don't remember exact number), and yes I think some can, not sure about this one though. I believe AuKey has one that does do quick charging."
Android,3do9zg,Release_the_KRAKEN,14,Sat Jul 18 01:47:45 2015 UTC,I guess I'm so used to my 7000mAh brick :(

Android,3do9zg,Release_the_KRAKEN,34,Sat Jul 18 01:54:41 2015 UTC,"A humper dumper Galaxy S3 (no service, I use it as a wifi/media player) with a zerolemon extended battery. Yes it's thick. Yes it's heavy. But it's not as heavy as people who hear/see it think. Plus I regularly get 10+ Screen on time so that's nice.

Android,3do9zg,somewhatokay,5,Sat Jul 18 05:24:32 2015 UTC,These are great.  I won't upgrade to a phone if it won't be able to use an extended battery or a data card.
Android,3do9zg,Release_the_KRAKEN,2,Sat Jul 18 05:29:33 2015 UTC,"Me too. I've been saving up all year to get a Note 5 and then I finally find out that there's no micro sd card or removable battery?! Nope! Gotta have atleast 10,000mAh. Guess I'm going for the Note 4 then!"
Android,3do9zg,404redditornotfound,2,Sat Jul 18 06:32:37 2015 UTC,Same. If the Note 5 disappoints. I'll wait for the Note 5 to be released to get a great deal on the Note 4.
Android,3do9zg,dark_roast,3,Sat Jul 18 06:39:32 2015 UTC,It's the waiting that's fucking me. Every few days I'll check on google to see any updates. The no micro sd card was not a nice update :(

I've tried some of the Lollipop Roms and they gave better battery life but the bugs were everywhere. Very disheartening stuff. Plus the big thing that's kept me with this Rom (besides the bullet proof stability) is the built in Gestures features. No icons on home page for me!  But if you're asking whether you think the custom Rom is significant reason as to why I can pull off battery life like this, I'm not sure that's correct. I'm also a big fan of greenify (I've greenified many apps include system apps like Calendar and such) and DisableService."

Android,3do9zg,internet_observer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:26:40 2015 UTC,"I used to use a similar setup, 10hrs SOT is real. I've just upgraded to an S6 active, it's marginally thicker than the base model S6, but it has given over 8hrs SOT with moderate use. (I don't know the max SOT since I haven't gone 100% to 0% yet.)  When you consider it doesn't need a case, it will be thinner than an S6 w/ case.  If you don't mind the style of the phone and the fact that it's exclusive to att, the S6 active is worth a look."
Android,3do9zg,FiendFyre498,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:31:29 2015 UTC,I'm in Canada so I think it'll be more expensive to get the Active. Plus I like keeping the phone as a media player so I'll need the SD card to load up an ass ton of vids.
Android,3do9zg,Release_the_KRAKEN,3,Sat Jul 18 20:09:05 2015 UTC,I had a 7000 for my s3. It was nice. I could go a full weekend of dencent use without charging. I could also go a full day of constant GPS use which was fantastic when I was traveling.

Android,3do9zg,FiendFyre498,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:25:12 2015 UTC,I meant for the S6. Note 4 has a removable battery so I'm sure you could get an extended battery at 7k mAh without it being overly large.

Android,3do9zg,ScruffyTheJanitor_,2,Sat Jul 18 12:54:07 2015 UTC,"I purchased about a month after it was announced last year in September. Honestly, the phone's been holding up really well. It's still as smooth and fast as the day I got it. The battery lasts me 1-2 days on moderate usage (mostly music listening). Under heavy usage (5-6 of actual on screen time), it will last me through the day. The only thing left to be desired is the screen. Don't get me wrong, the LCD is great. Just coming from a Samsung Amoled, it takes some getting used it. It has lollipop available (5.0.2) but I'm still on Kit Kat due to the memory leak bug. I haven't affected by the whole back glass breaking issue. It's been a case since day one.   My only advice is, if you're on T-Mobile, explore your options. This phone doesn't have Band 12 (LTE @ 700 MHz). If that's not a deal breaker, I'd say go for it. For the price and specs, it's a really good deal. Plus, it's supposed to get 5.1.1 sometime in the next month.   Let me know if you'd like any additional info on the phone. More than happy to help out! :)"

Android,3do9zg,AnWar90,3,Sat Jul 18 21:01:59 2015 UTC,Funny how you put a video from someone who nobody knows and only has 2 videos on his channel. While everyone other reviewer says it overheats.  The S6 5min limit is a software limit by Samsung.   Here's a better video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EkHJw_VNcU
Android,3do9zg,FrozenCaveMoose,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"It still shows the S6 and the Z3+.  Why does the S6 have a 5 minute limit? Because the S6 overheats too, Samsung just masks it while Sony lets you go all the way.  That videos proves nothing. The Z3+ is a properly sealed device due to water and dust resistance, it obviously gets warmer."
Android,3do9zg,ctkatz,3,Sun Jul 19 16:13:37 2015 UTC,"Pure misconception. Your point about sealed device is nonsense. There are no devices on the market that has a cooling system based on convection, it's either blackbody radiation or thermal conduction onto the rear of the case. No phones vent heat through ports. Forget the facts, just look at IRL common sense stuff, opening the flaps on a z3+ does not make the phone any less prone to overheating. Adding port covers using sugru or something  will not make s6 any more likely to overheat. Hermetically sealing a device will only affect its thermal characteristics if it has a fan inside blowing air outide the system (like in the case of servers)or use other similar forms of convection. On phones, no heat is moved using convection.     Lets forget all of that. S6 active is waterproof and dust proof, no reports of it overheating."
Android,3do9zg,i_did_ur_mom,-1,Sat Jul 18 11:59:14 2015 UTC,Are you saying that a sealed phone does not retain more heat?   The Z3+ is also a lot thinner than the S6 Active.
Android,3do9zg,solidcopy,2,Sat Jul 18 14:31:11 2015 UTC,"Yes. It will not retain heat more than an euqivalent non waterproof phone. No OEM will use ports as vent holes for the purpose of convection. This is a dumb idea since people plug stuff into ports. A thicker phone might have more volume of heat generating components, this means that the thinner phone should run cooler."
Android,3do9zg,i_did_ur_mom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:59:08 2015 UTC,I'm not saying that the ports are vent holes and the ports aren't the only place where the phones are sealed. A thin phone can also have the same about the same heat generating components as the thicker phone.

Android,3do9zg,mdneilson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:27:14 2015 UTC,I take it off rarely but if I'm wearing a suit and want a slimmer phone I have that option. I think my overall impressions of it are good.   The hand feel is excellent and it definitely does what it claims and more than doubled the battery life of the s6.

I haven't tested it personally, I want my phones to last for years and that's why I chose the Active in the first place, to have as many safeguards as possible. I do get the urge to submerge it or throw it just to find out if it'll really hold up, but I've resisted so far."

Android,3dswgg,SkoivanSchiem,18,Sun Jul 19 03:31:26 2015 UTC,I think it makes more sense in AMOLED because of how low its pixel fill factor is compared to LCD/IPS. I really think AMOLED will become the panel of choice for high end phones (including the iPhones). So it makes sense to see both Samsung and LG fighting it out to improve the panel in every way possible (including the panel resolution).  Edit- I should add that Samsung has done a very good job at decreasing AMOLED power consumption with each generation of AMOLED while at the same time increasing the resolution. I think the goal is to keep finding ways to make the panel more efficient without holding back the panel resolution.
Android,3dswgg,Mykem,5,Sun Jul 19 04:20:16 2015 UTC,If anyone wants any AMOLED then don't Samsung only sell 2 year old tech? Isn't that the reason the Nexus 6 has an awful screen in terms of colour and efficiency compared to the note.
Android,3dswgg,swear_on_me_mam,2,Sun Jul 19 12:03:18 2015 UTC,I'm more inclined to believe that Motorola was unwilling to pay the premium price Samsung was asking for the latest panel.

Android,3dswgg,HubbaMaBubba,2,Mon Jul 20 23:02:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does. The Apple Watch uses AMOLED panel made by LG. And LG produces OLED TV.  http://www.oled-info.com/lg-oled"
Android,3dswgg,Mykem,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:10 2015 UTC,OLED isn't the same as AMOLED.
Android,3dswgg,HubbaMaBubba,0,Mon Jul 20 23:20:11 2015 UTC,Explain the difference.
Android,3dswgg,Mykem,2,Tue Jul 21 00:27:11 2015 UTC,http://oled.lcdtvbuyingguide.com/oled-tv-articles/oled-vs-amoled.html
Android,3dswgg,HubbaMaBubba,2,Tue Jul 21 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"The display on the Apple Watch is Flexible OLED. Here's from Displaymate's assessment of the Apple Watch display:   Flexible OLED displays are the latest advancement in OLED technology. They are made on a flexible plastic substrate, so they can be used to make curved displays. But they also provide major advantages for flat screen watches because they are extra thin, typically less than 0.5 mm, much lighter in weight, plus the flexible substrate makes it possible to enclose them into a smaller space. LG and Samsung are the leaders in this display technology. In 2013 both introduced Flexible OLED smartphones (the Samsung Galaxy Round and the LG G Flex) and in 2014 both introduced Flexible OLED smart watches (the Samsung Gear S, which has a curved display, and the LG G Watch R, which has a full circle round display, which is only possible using an OLED plastic substrate). Note that on the Apple Watch the Flexible OLED display is bonded to the sapphire crystal or cover glass, so it isn’t flexible from the outside.   As to whether LG actually produces AMOLED:    Flexible OLED displays Samsung and LG already mass produce flexible AMOLED panels, used in mobile phone and wearable devices. Samsung's Galaxy S6 Edge, for example, uses a 5.1"" AMOLED on a plastic substrate - that bends around the device edges. LG Display is also producing large flexible AMOLEDs, used in their own mobile phones and also reportedly in the Apple Watch. You can find out more information in our Flexible OLED Market Report.   http://www.oled-info.com/amoled  So, I would say LG does manufactures AMOLED."
Android,3dswgg,Mykem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:11:37 2015 UTC,That's interesting.
Android,3dswgg,HubbaMaBubba,2,Tue Jul 21 01:12:25 2015 UTC,"I think it makes more sense in AMOLED because of how low its pixel fill factor is compared to LCD/IPS.   When comparing the GS5 to the GS5 LTE-A (same AMOLED generation), the higher resolution came with a visible power cost. It wasn't until the Galaxy S6 that 1440p had equivalent/less power consumption than 1080p of a previous generation.  As far as we can tell, LCD and AMOLED are equally affected by higher resolution in terms of power consumption."

Android,3dswgg,j__h,11,Sun Jul 19 04:10:19 2015 UTC,>90% of the time phones are not being used for VR. And with smaller devices like the g3 1440p is just a waste.
Android,3dswgg,pelvicmomentum,26,Sun Jul 19 06:18:36 2015 UTC,Having these screens mass produced for phones brings down the price of the screens for a low(er) volume VR product actually making them commercially viable.

Android,3dswgg,123ggafet,13,Sun Jul 19 04:54:05 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a issue, but unless you're playing 3D games a good amount of time, I don't think the GPU usage has a big difference in 2D for 1080p vs 1440p."
Android,3dswgg,Shadow703793,4,Sun Jul 19 05:10:53 2015 UTC,2D UI drawing in 1440p shouldn't be too taxing on the GPU as well. Mostly the problem stems from LCD needing that much more backlight power.
Android,3dswgg,axehomeless,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:14:28 2015 UTC,"Isn't backlight power dependent on screen size, not pixels, since every pixel uses the one back light.  AMOLED has each pixel lit independently and that still uses less power with each gen and resolution upgrade anyway."
Android,3dswgg,BWalker66,2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"Both. The problem is that LCDs function by putting the backlight through a layer of liquid crystals (hence the name). The more pixel, the more light ""gets lost"" in that layer (which is converted to heat). On the way so to speak. So to achieve the same display brightness for us to see, you up the light output of the backlight, push more light into the LC layer. The display gets warmer and and draws more power as a result, even though it's the same size and same brightness to our eye as before.  This is what happened to the G3 with it's display overheating ""problem"". And that's usually why the higher-res penalty in terms of power draw shows much more strongly in LCD than AMOLED-Displays."
Android,3dswgg,axehomeless,2,Sun Jul 19 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"it's not the pixels that are the problem, it's the wiring needed to control pixels that gets more dense, as PPI increases and lets less light through (requiring a more powerful backlight).   See this picture https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/574/7105/8d/www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sas2011-sharp_chart1.jpg  This perhaps only applies to LCD, not amoled."
Android,3dswgg,123ggafet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks very interesting. Could it be that because AMOLEDs don't need backlight, the wiring can just be behind the pixels and not interfere with the picture?"

Supposedly the G4's screen is 30% more efficient than the G3's while offering better colors and stuff (thought I read that somewhere, but I could be wrong). There's still the added drain on the GPU,  but things like that are likely to catch up soon if it hasn't already.

Android,3dswgg,yoitsjustin,4,Sun Jul 19 05:34:30 2015 UTC,"It takes up around 40-50% of the total battery usage on the G3   That's actually perfectly normal, that'd probably happen even on a 480p screen. The things is, the display doesn't use that much battery because the resolution is too high, it's just that displays always use the most battery, that's just how it works. The rest of the phone is just ""low profile"" components, they don't use that much battery. A microphone, a camera, a speaker, etc don't really use a significant amount of battery, but a 5+ inch screen that's always working when you actually use your phone will drain the battery, especially on higher brightness.  The resolution will only make the GPU/CPU drain more battery, since it has to work harder to draw way more pixels.  I love it when my phone's display use the most power, that means that it was discharging because I actually used my phone, not because some apps caused wakelocks or not because the phone radio bug."

Android,3dswgg,newbcoder,0,Sun Jul 19 05:35:24 2015 UTC,You are right. Phones work just like a desktop computer: lower resolution = faster rendering and lower [GPU] power usage. This is a good read about what you can achieve when reducing resolution.
Android,3dswgg,naco_taco,-3,Sun Jul 19 07:47:42 2015 UTC,"I for one really can see a difference, and it's appreciated."
Android,3dswgg,axehomeless,6,Sun Jul 19 11:14:57 2015 UTC,So far the screen resolution battery drain has only affected LCD displays. LCD screens requires a stronger backlight for 1440p screens. Amoleds screens have individually lit pixels that makes a 1440p screen drain as much battery as a 1080p one.
Android,3dswgg,duykhang,-2,Sun Jul 19 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"The battery drain also affects AMOLED screens due to needing more GPU power to render everything at 60fps. Remember, QHD is FOUR TIMES the number of pixels than a 720 or 1080 screen depending on overall resolution. Yes, even when not playing games. It does take a fair amount of GPU resources to keep everything refreshed at 60fps."

Android,3dswgg,timawesomeness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:34:23 2015 UTC,"You're pushing the same amount of pixels. The number of pixels on your screen don't change, it's just uses less GPU power to draw as 1080p, but extra CPU power to upscale it."

Though there must be people who can actually tell the difference, I guess it's only a small percentage of the population, so OEMs could easily stay at 1080p and maybe they'd lose 1-2% of the customers who wanted QHD or higher res."

Android,3dnc3g,Brysamo,48,Sat Jul 18 04:20:39 2015 UTC,Because standard 'naive' timelapse looks awful. The movements of the camera become jerky and difficult to watch.

Watch about the first minute of this video for an explanation.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOpwHaQnRSY

Android,3dnc3g,darkpivot,20,Fri Jul 17 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"Well Hyperlapse does some interesting stabilization techniques to make the video super smooth. It basically generates a bare 3D model of the scene from the video and generates the camera movement on a spline path, interpolates that path to a much smoother one, and re-projects the video onto the generated model to produce a smooth almost steadycam-like result.   Sometimes it works very well, sometimes you can see some obvious flaws.    Edit: I'm getting some conflicting information in the comments and apparently the mobile version does not use this technique, but it does still stabilize it. Sorry about that."

I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, or expecting too much, but the initial introduction videos Microsoft had shown a couple of months ago were so much more impressive than what I get now.

Android,3dnc3g,krackers,13,Fri Jul 17 23:43:54 2015 UTC,It's because they're using a different algorithm on mobile -- the original scene reconstruction was too intensive to be done on mobile processors.

Allowing an app to cast to a Chromecast specifically is part of Google's SDK, and not as open. This means you certainly can easily make your app Chromecast ready, you just have to agree to Google's SDK agreement. So Amazon could make their FireTV devices show up and work with any app that supports casting right now with no Google agreement. If they wanted to make their Amazon movie app on phones and tablets work with a Chromecast, they'd have to agree to Google's SDK license and they are probably in violation by running their own app store.

By the way, I've been curious. Is the interface on the Fire devices better than it is on the Android app?

That's a false choice, since FireTV offers both. I have a FireTV and a Chromecast, I quickly stopped using my Chromecast after purchasing the FireTV.  Chromecast: You can cast things from chrome or phone to the TV.  FireTV: You can cast things from your phone (Netflix, Youtube) to your TV OR you can use the full interface on the TV itself.  Not sure what killer apps are missing caste ability on the FireTV, the only things I've EVER casted are Netflix, Youtube & Chrome tabs (and the Chrome tabs where gee wiz gimmicks only).  Honestly, there seems to be something flaky about multicast discovery on my home network (trust me, I've tried to fix it) so I'm MUCH happier with the full interface then casting, as app discovery of my chromecast is hit or miss (the FireTV is almost always discovered as a cast target in Netflix)."

I also use a lot of Prime and opt for the $1 video credit so the Fire Stick has enabled me to purchase about [roughly] $150 in content at no cost to me and enjoy it with a high quality viewing experience.

Android,3dm5fk,armando_rod,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:13:12 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll start this off by saying I always was a huge fan of Google (Play)  Music. I was a beta tester back when I was a freshman in high school with my HTC Thunderbolt. It was great to have all this music in the cloud and I could deal with some of the issues and slowdowns, thinking it was because it was in beta or my phone was getting old.   But then it went out of beta and was officially released. The first thing that made me mad was when they stopped having the interface color change to match the album art (but to be honest that was a dumb gripe). But the slowdowns never stopped. I kept getting new phones (Droid DNA, HTC One M7) but it always took forever to load, would freeze my phone at inopportune times, and sometimes just flat out didn't work. But I powered through. Until the summer before I went to college, when I found out college students got discounted Spotify premium. I signed up right away and, even if I own the album (maybe even a physical copy that I ripped to my computer and uploaded to Google) I'll find myself turning to Spotify to listen to it. It loads faster, and like 9 times out of 10 I'm on my campus Wi-Fi, as shitty as it may be, and if I'm going off I'll download a Spotify playlist and it's often done before the shuttle to the subway station arrives.   The only reason I still have Google Play Music is for the few albums that just aren't on Spotify and recordings of concert bands that I've played on. I could say before that their instant mixes were a reason but not anymore. I'm this close to removing it from my home screen. But we'll see."

Android,3dn7h3,cryptoz,46,Fri Jul 17 17:15:12 2015 UTC,"This looks good. I had PressureNet installed for a short time years ago and the uninstalled because it didn't do weather.  I'll download and see if it can supplement if not replace Weather Timeline on my phone.    Also you guys may want to do a bit of FAQ upkeep on your site...   Does the iPhone have a barometer?   The current models unfortunately don't. Though, it's rumoured that the iPhone 6 will have one!"
Android,3dn7h3,BlackMartian,14,Fri Jul 17 19:18:01 2015 UTC,"Some feedback from giving it a spin:  1)I don't think that my current phone (moto G XT1045) has a barometer, and it seems like it would be appropriate for the initial setup to detect that and show me something that takes that into account. The whole first screen basically sets me up with some false expectations for what the app does, as it is.  2)Are you familiar with Weather Underground's ""Wundermap"" feature? Your primary interface is a lot like it (personally I prefer your forecast bubbles to the cartoony giant numbers), but without the ability to tap a forecast and get a little card for the weather station it's coming from. I think that functionality goes a long way to making the information intuitive and useful. If pressurenet is pulling weather station data and modifying it based on user data, it would be very nice to pull up a little card that names the station, tells me its data, and then tells me the pressurenet correction, if there is one.  3)Submitting a conditions report and seeing others works well, but I wonder how the app would handle overload if it gets popular? Perhaps that's a bridge to cross later, though. For now it seems fine that it just shows everything at all zoom levels since it's so sparse. Conversely, though, zooming causes the forecast reports to re-organize themselves in a way that's sort of awkward to watch unfold, feels like I'm watching it say ""oops that's too much data, oops that's also not what I want to show you, oops let's try these stations instead"".  4)I know you said you're still working on the UI overall, but for the record, some things that could stand to improve there:   -Make the left menu slide out with a swipe from all screens instead of just the primary one.  -The feature that Google Maps recently implemented where tapping the screen dismisses the overlaid UI elements would be very nice here (the white bars take up a lot of space, the bottom one in particular feels like a lot of space allocated poorly).  -Flesh out the location settings to a better menu. I don't think it's good to rely on people figuring out to long-press on a popup to manage/delete.  -Similar to the last one, flesh out the export function. It would be good to launch a little menu that lets the user configure the location and name of the file, and put the actual function on a more clearly labeled button.  -Some indication that the two panels in ""About"" will launch a website in another app would be nice.  5)The data sharing permission seems excessively fine-grain to me. It seems to be a given that you're promising that the service isn't being used to collect my location data to sell to an advertising service etc. If that's the case, I find it hard to believe that people would want to limit researchers or forecast services from using it. I think it would make more sense to make public a separate opt-in (or is that completely defunct now?) and just make yourself/researchers/forecasters one unified yes/no sharing setting.  6)When I first launched the app, it crashed after the setup screen (I had not changed the submission control, and selected no for notifications). It didn't give me the option to submit a crash report, and later I cleared app data to see the initial setup screen again, and it didn't crash the second time around. Not sure if there's any way I can make that useful to you, but well, there it is."
Android,3dn7h3,GNex1,7,Fri Jul 17 19:25:56 2015 UTC,"Fantastic feedback. I'll address:  1) You are correct, but this is weird - I do have an entirely different message that is supposed to show when a phone doesn't have a barometer. See here on GitHub. Perhaps there is a bug in detecting the barometer or something, I will look into this.  2) This will be a balance between simplicity, and providing detailed weather data. Right now I would agree that we aren't showing quite enough data to the user, especially given the complexity behind generating the data. However, I want to keep the UI simple without all the extra fields that often accompany weather apps.  3) As the app grows in popularity, we will start to use clustering on the reports - only show the data once ~3 people have reported a condition, and as you zoom out, cluster the conditions.  For the map temperatures, we actually have > 10,000 locations that we are generating forecasts for and sending to the phone. I'm working on a better way to show this. Thanks for the feedback that the current method is confusing.  4) Good UI feedback. I'm migrating this from API level 11 (Android 3.0 Honeycomb) to a more modern API 21 (Lollipop), so there's quite a bit to do here. I will definitely flesh out the locations menu and the export function (the export one is really bothering me too).  5) The detailed permissions was due to user feedback about 3 years ago, and I tend to agree that it's too fine-grained now. We wanted to provide maximum flexibility, but I think maybe we went too far!  6) Yeah, someone else reported a crash (NullPointerException). I don't know why there's no Report button! I hope I can find a stack trace to fix this.  FANTASTIC feedback. Thank you so much!"
Android,3dn7h3,GNex1,7,Fri Jul 17 19:44:02 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, and thanks for taking the time to respond to my points.  Just to elaborate a bit on that crash report, it wasn't instant after the setup screen, subjectively it sort of seemed to be linked to the map data loading. I think I had a few seconds in which I panned around slightly, I could see the forecast bubbles but the map clearly wasn't loaded yet. After re-launching the app it resolved at what seemed like normal speed for google maps. Then, after I cleared data and re-did setup (no crash), all the map data seemed to be cached and loaded instantly.  I don't regularly use any other apps that use google's map data other than google maps itself, and I hadn't launched that in several days when this happened. So, maybe something tripped when building the cache from scratch."

Android,3dn7h3,throwaway_redstone,3,Fri Jul 17 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"Your data will definitely be skewed when you're in the tower, but that's okay. We have built systems to clean and filter the data; in fact, all of our data is quite noisy. The barometers are very sensitive to altitude changes, even the difference between your head and your feet can be measured.

Android,3dn7h3,PM_ME_A_NEW_USERNAME,4,Sat Jul 18 01:41:47 2015 UTC,"Well, the trends in the  data are really what's important to us, not necessarily the exact value. So, if you're in a tower and you stay there for a few hours, the pressure trend (rising, or falling, and at what rate) will still be useful.

But we just don't have much to offer you in return for using the app right now, except for the Current Conditions notifications / self-reporting of the weather.  Forecasts can be very expensive to run, depending on the resolution and geographical scale. The US gov't and the EU both spend > $100M / year running weather forecasts on supercomputers at very high resolution, for global scale geographies. We spend a lot less than that obviously, but...it's still expensive (we're a small startup). I'll consider tabulating the costs later and publishing something about that..maybe."

Ideally, I'd like to crowdsource temperature data too, from the sensors in the phones that have a thermometer (like the Galaxy S4). However, the temperature sensor data is very unreliable (pocket temp, CPU/battery temp, inside/outside, etc).  User-input temperatures would probably be more reliable than trying to do it from the sensors. But I wonder, how many users will input what it feels like to them, vs. using a real thermometer? Maybe that's not a bad thing, either, but I'm definitely concerned about data quality. On the other hand......how else will we ever know if we get the temperature right or wrong?

Android,3dn7h3,Memeinist,2,Fri Jul 17 21:12:57 2015 UTC,"We deal with a lot of bad quality data actually; pressure controlled environments are a tough one, though. The barometers in these phones are there to detect your changes in altitude (for Google and Apple to offer stair-counting, indoor directions, etc), which is a major source of noise for us.   Bias in the individual sensors is also an issue: two phones right next to each other might report different readings.  AND pressure controlled buildings also add noise.   So, we do a fair bit of work on algorithms to automatically filter out bad data and to clean the good data, but it's definitely a challenge."

Sorry, I had my phone in my house for six days with an app notifying me of all air pressure changes (rise or fall) and it always failed to predict rainfall.   My point is that mobile phones suck in giving valid measurements of air pressure for the purpose of weather prediction."

I've come across only two really minor issues:    In the sentence ""...  In some corners, we had critics who thought we were Us Weekly; in others..."" if I click ""Us"", it chooses ""we were Us"" (apparently a song by Miranda Lambert) and not ""Us Weekly"". I'm not even sure if this is a deficiency really, just wondering how does it establish a priority in a situation like this, and couldn't the capitalization (of Us Weekly) provide a hint for it to make the more obvious choice?  If I click ""Hosoda's"", it correctly finds Mamoru Hosoda (a Japanese director) in the Google Search page, but since it only shows the selected text verbatim I don't know if it really recognized that as belonging to a person until I click the tab. I'd prefer if it changed the text in the tab to ""Hosoda"", for instance. Also, if I click on a lesser known person's surname with the - 's - at the end, ""Safina"" of ""Carl Safina's"" for instance (a scientist/author), it selects the full name, but asks ""if I meant Carl Safina"". If I click that, it shows the correct person. These two (admittedly pedantic (sorry!)) examples makes me wonder if it could be taught to ignore suffixes like 's?

Android,3dohld,stormarsenal,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:02:35 2015 UTC,Is there any reasons to get these new budget phones really. It possibly could be that I'm not the audience as I am more of an android geek than the average user with flashing roms and such but I feel as the N4 or N5 would be as good or better than this phone. The N5 may be getting M I believe and there's a huge android modding community for those phones that put it ahead of this. There will be little to none of this phone and the software updates by LG will probably be slow and not frequent.

Half of my emails are task-based, while the other half are either updates from services I use or notifications for random things.  I've always thought of Inbox as being geared toward people that have a very task-oriented inbox.  And if I do use it, should I stop using gmail, or at least disable its notifications?"
Android,3dmdh7,probably2high,12,Fri Jul 17 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"You sound like you're in a position similar to what I was a couple of weeks ago. So to answer your question... Yes, you should at least give it a go.   The majority of my emails aren't work or school related. They're mostly newsletter subscriptions or updates from various things I'm following. However, occasionally I'll receive something that needs to go down on my calendar or that I need to be reminded of e.g. an important meeting or document.   This is the beauty of Inbox. It allows you to prioritize your inbox in such a way that little updates can still be seen but ultimately, the most important and pressing emails rise to the top. The concept of being ""done"" with an email rather than trashing it may seem strange at first but it's actually very intelligent because it means you can always have a clean inbox but you never truly get rid of your old emails, so they're always open to being searched should you need them later.   All in all, I would give the app a go. I used CloudMagic for a long time before I realized that 90% of my emails went to my gmail account so I might as well try out Inbox. And I've loved the transition. It has allowed me to keep a clean inbox while also made managing important emails and information so much easier.   tl;dr: Do it.   Edit: Oh yeah and if you do use it, disable gmail notifications."

I still use it for tasks, regular emails, seeing my lists from Google Keep, AND adding small reminders for myself (today, this evening, ...) that do not deserve a new Google Keep list with only one checkbox.   All those small tasks (buy groceries at 6PM for example) do not deserve a new Google Keep list with one item, or one huge entry in the calendar. Inbox is perfect for that. They are still shown in the calendar but I don't really care anymore. Inbox does everything.   Well, almost since I can't use external emails accounts with it but I still use Gmail for that."

It's really disappointing because I want to buy the Note 5 but will probably get screwed over the same way as with this device
Android,3dnaur,notso1nter3sting,64,Fri Jul 17 18:58:36 2015 UTC,The delay because of GearVR was IMO fucking stupid. delay a great update to a device to ensure that a 200 dollar headset works for teh 7 people who bought it.

By running rooted TW 4.4.2, I still get serviceable speeds in my house and my phone isn't busy switching between LTE and 3G al the while not giving me any data.   Outside my house, it doesn't matter then. CM has no issues with data. But because I've been in my home for the majority of the last two years studying, I've stuck with TW after I heard someone on XDA mention something about custom ROMs not having the same radio-somethings as stock.

Android,3dnaur,Izick,51,Sat Jul 18 12:06:41 2015 UTC,"Ok, so, let's see: the S3 got multi-window, which if I recall correctly, was included in an update. That was a major feature. The Note 3 was pushed to Lollipop, and received many S5 and Note 4 features, including the new multi-window. It didn't receive all of them (no toolbox, no side menu), sure, but the Note 3 got a massive functionality boost on Lollipop. The Note 4 does not run a similar skin to the S6, no. The Note 3, S5 and Note 4 all ran different skins, though, in aesthetics and functionality. The Lollipop TouchWiz builds pushed to those devices are almost the same now, except for device-specific features. But this doesn't mean that S phones don't get major Note features, and that Note phones don't get major S features. It also doesn't mean the Note 4 will get theme support, and it probably wouldn't until an M build anyway.   You see, my problem is not with his claim, which is probably correct. It's how he justifies it. Note 4 XDA developer Dr. Ketan managed to port the S6 theme engine to the Note 4, managing his job and real life. Trying to insinuate that it's not possible, that it's a lot of work (for Samsung), and the like, is just speculation -- and that's really what all of Sammobile's editorials are. Speculation and speculation only. No analysis no anything. They don't even look back at previous cases, because you could have argued that many old Samsung phones wouldn't have gotten many major updates or features and you would have been wrong many times. I am not saying all Samsung phones get all the newer features, but this is a speculation piece without any real arguments, just like their previous MicroSD feature. Luckily they learned from last time and worded this one's title properly (imagine what would have happened without the word ""probably"" in it).  So this is just 3 short paragraphs, each saying:  1 - Phones have been getting 5.1.1 and we received questions  2 - Samsung is not doing it because they won't port the entire UI  3 - ""Bad Samsung, bad. We need to buy the Note 5 now.""  I don't see how this was worth a feature. They should have just tweeted a few sentences of the middle paragraph. Oh, money.   I really don't get these guys."
Android,3dnaur,TachyonGun,12,Fri Jul 17 19:04:26 2015 UTC,"This also makes me think about how he note 3 didn't get the s5 features, but eventually it got the note 4 features.

LG? granted they are now working towards unlocking the bootloaders but before they seemed pretty anti community.  That leaves HTC, and Samsung as the big 4, Samsung and htc lock bootloaders on select carriers, but on the majority they are unlocked. both can be rooted without a need for an exploit (flash a custom recovery/kernel to gain root via download/fastboot mode)  last i knew htc still has a few hiccups releasing kernel source in a timely manner, the evo lte (sprints htc phone of teh same ""gen"" as the S3) is left on jellybean, while samsung was kind enough to update teh sprint s3 to 4.4.

I had a nexus 5 and thought it was a powerful and nice device, but weak battery and camera held it back from being a truly amazing device IMO.   The nexus 6 had awesome build quality and a great feel, but was too large for the sake of being large. Since there was no Moto X 2014 for Sprint i picked up the Note 4 which while large at least had features that offset it, I've since switched away from it because usage was too difficult.  I'm anxious to see what Huawei brings to the table for the new Nexus as after playing with a P8 Lite and spending some time working with them I am truly impressed and would love to play with a new high end phone from them."
Android,3dnaur,Shabbypenguin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"See I am the opposite, I love the size of my Nexus 6. I do miss having an extra battery or extended battery and external SD card support, but I got a 64gb device and really didn't 'need' an external SD card it was just nice to have.  I fought with myself for the better part of two months on which device I wanted the Note 4 or Nexus 6. I eventually ended up on the Nexus 6 because I value rootability along with customization over anything else. Battery life is not as good as a Note 4, but I was willing to make the sacrifice so it was okay to me.   The biggest reason I got it over the Note 4 was because it supports all US carriers. US Cellular coverage is a fucking joke outside of the Tri state area so I have a few prepaid sims of other GSM carriers I can just pop in if needed. That alone is what makes this device perfect for me IMO.  I too am excited for the new Nexus, I may even save up and sell my current one to upgrade for it, if it's awesome enough."

The GPS is just weak on the samsung when compared to other manufacturers. I have quite the lineup of phones from most android, iPhone and blackberry releases.

And different versions of Qualcomm cpus housed in Samsung phones. Each needs it's own 'driver'/kernel code, and has its own feature set/power management that needs to be addressed.  Then, there are different versions of touchwiz that need to be made to work on whatever version of Android that it will sit on top of.  Then, there are the actual  OS releases by Google, which Samsung engineers will have to first understand how changes will affect their software (and hardware) , then go about trying to shoehorn everything together and pray things don't go south.  Not as easy as saying OMG WTF SHOULD DO WHAT APPLE DOES!!  So no, your comparison is not accurate....

Want to get a bootloader unlocked Moto X? No. The only Android phone that is bootloader unlocked on their current roster of modern flagships is the Nexus 6. This let's them dominate their phones with non-removable bloatware and customers have no choice.  Thankfully, because LTE needs a SIM, I can at least jump ship to another carrier with my Nexus 6 if I need to. But the moment that companies get rid of the SIM card will be the moment that carriers all take one step closer to being like Verizon in having total control over what devices are allowed on their network... And that is not a positive for the customer."

Android,3dmdn7,Squat-Tech,2,Fri Jul 17 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"CDMA can carry a lot more (maybe 3x as many?) calls in the same amount of bandwidth as GSM (TDMA). So it's a good thing. But yes, it's too bad the CDMA carriers in the US only use SIM cards for LTE."
Android,3dmdn7,rechlin,2,Sat Jul 18 03:52:15 2015 UTC,Can you do voice and data at the same time on CDMA now? I know you couldn't before.
Android,3dmdn7,speedhunter787,-1,Sat Jul 18 07:10:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on the phone and carrier. For example, my old Galaxy S2 could do it, but even some modern phones cannot."
Android,3dmdn7,rechlin,2,Sat Jul 18 12:39:32 2015 UTC,I believe that was the main weakness of CDMA carriers (for me at least). No simultaneous voice call + data. Don't think it's so much to do with the phone.
Android,3dmdn7,speedhunter787,2,Sun Jul 19 05:33:20 2015 UTC,"That's for pure CDMA. But they've been doing CDMA in conjunction with WiMax or LTE for a while in phones that we still call ""CDMA"". Depending on how they route the radios, they can sometimes do voice on CDMA with data on LTE or (in the past) WiMax. I believe this won't work with Carrier Aggregation, though. So it really depends on the phone and carrier.   Of course, I'm being downvoted by the people who don't understand the technology."

In Europe CDMA does not exist at all, all carriers follow the GSM standard, and because there are many small countries here, if you travel a little bit you constantly have to swap SIM cards to get local service. I often have to juggle between 3 different SIMs, and I constantly fear losing one of them. An e-SIM solution would be very useful for this. And with the fierce competition between carriers here, the first one who will try to pull some device control crap will quickly lose its customers."

Android,3dmdn7,toddthegeek,2,Sat Jul 18 00:37:43 2015 UTC,"Depends. Can I switch carriers in seconds, possibly for a foreign one? Can I quickly switch to another phone in seconds, without going online, even if the first phone is dead?   These are my doubts about the e-SIM idea and what makes a regular SIM card so valuable to me. If I break my phone, I can quickly switch to a second one (even borrowed) in seconds, without any sort of activation or internet access. Bonus points: I still have my important contacts if they've been saved to the SIM card.   It's extremely convenient to be able to cross the border and quickly switch to a local provider just by popping in a SIM card I already have. It's convenient to be able to carry a dumb phone in the car or bag for trips that I can pop my SIM into and use right away if something happens to my device. Also, I happen to switch phones occasionally depending on where I'm going and dealing with any sort of activation/switch that takes more than seconds would honestly be a hassle."

Android,3dmdn7,toddthegeek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:56:55 2015 UTC,"I just had an idea.  Maybe you can NFC the eSim information to the new phone (by just tapping them together) and then click on the esim app to activate the phone (which deactivates the other).    I'm just throwing out ideas.  I didn't see any specifications on how esim would actually work in practice, but I want to believe it's a step in the right direction.  I'm actually working in engineering on a LTE system and we're activation 60 sims on the system.  It really sucks because we have to match the imei to the sims id in a spreadsheet, copy that over to a server that does some other stuff and... well the process leaves a person wondering if it could be easier.  Also on our system the SIM in locked to the imei so you can't put it into another phone.  That kinda defeats the point except the phones will work on other carriers if ever needed."
Android,3dmdn7,toddthegeek,5,Sun Jul 19 05:11:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with ""No, please no."" but the rest of your post doesn't make all that much sense.

Android,3dmdn7,maximumhamburgers,11,Fri Jul 17 17:08:49 2015 UTC,"Actually... no, other carriers can't do the same thing. Part of the GSM standard is allowing any GSM-compatible phone on the network. The whitelisting for IMEI is only used to block stolen phones.   CDMA service providers aren't held to this same standard, allowing them to avoid access to any device as they please."
Android,3dmdn7,sargunster,5,Fri Jul 17 20:44:54 2015 UTC,"Well, right, I meant in theory.  ATT would get slapped with a huge fine for it, but they could do it.  It doesn't have anything to do with SIM cards - you could see this with the N6 on Verizon.  At the start, people were activating SIMs in another device and moving them to the N6, which let them on the CDMA network just fine, but then VZW put the kibosh on it by tightening the whitelist (IIRC).  The SIMs provided a short-term workaround, but it ended."

It's a huge pain in the ass when traveling to have to track down a brick and mortar shop to buy a specific SIM card, or work out an address that can receive mail. Not to mention, all those SIM cards typically run around 10 USD, so this would save significant money for short term users.   Anyone on a Sprint MVNO would also understand why this is so useful. Sprint officially only gives SIM cards to their own customers, meaning you have this fun task of going from store to store until one will finally give you a SIM if you're only a MVNO customer. The fact that there are 3 different SIM card sizes also makes it a pain in the ass. To me the positives clearly outweigh the negatives.

With this concept it sounds like you as the user might be able to just take your phone and connect it to whichever network you want - the carriers won't have the ability to do SIM locking that they do on some phones currently. Since AT&T is fighting apple on this, it sounds like that's almost the case. You'll still probably be on some kind of contract with X provider if you choose to do so, but all phones being sim-unlocked by default sounds like a net-win here.

With AT&T unless they install a whitelist option they can't control what phone you use. I can go overseas and buy any phone I want--so long as its band compatible with AT&T, I can slap a SIM in there.  Even though Verizon works with SIM Cards now for the LTE portion the CDMA portion was SIM-less. Think of Verizon as a no SIM option and given the fact that in the CDMA era, Sprint and Verizon phones were cross compatible, you can see how they abused the system of only allowing a phone with fat Verizon logo onto their network (Sprint is equally guilty)."
Android,3dmdn7,kdlt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"No, CDMA is a wholely different beast. With CDMA you have the device ESN/MEID that  authenticates the device to the network. The carrier must maintain a whitelist of devices, by design of the protocol.  With GSM the device's IMEI has no role in the network authentication1 - only the SIM ID. The carrier has a list of their customer's SIM IDs and allows1 any device with those IDs. Wit a user programmable SIM, you just need a carrier to be willing to sell you the ID (with a contract or whatever). Any phone you buy will be eSIM programmable, so they're all effectively sim-unlocked by default. Apple will likely ensure this happens as well - if they don't allow any network who doesn't follow suit to sell the iPhone, which the carriers will bend for.  1 the carriers can see the IMEI and use it after authentication as secondary auth for actual network access if they wanted to, that's how they blacklist stolen phones etc. Technically they could implement a whitelist the same as any CDMA system, but that would be pointless since that's what the SIM is already for (and would probably break many existing customer's service)"

The thing is, that's a Verizon approved device, sold by Verizon, software approved by Verizon. What if you want to use one that they don't approve of, like multiple nexus devices? Or most recently the nexus6 that multiple people here and on r/nexus6 complained they wouldn't activate, because of random reason #2434?

Even though any play store n6 should work, it doesn't , and if that's the situation were gonna have here in Europe/with GSM, then may the gods be merciful, because that's some serious amount of bullshit to handle, from something that is absurdly simple like just switching out a little simcard."

The subscription should be with carriere and not with the manufacturer... obviously   I'm not sure I understand your point, would you care to explain?   That's precisely how it works for us that use SIM cards exclusively. SIM cards interface the device with a carrier so to speak, the carrier has no opinion on what device I choose to pop the SIM card into, nor the manufacturer has a say in what carrier I am using. We can switch carriers in seconds without a call, text or internet access. And we're free to borrow a friends phone in seconds (while still having many contacts accessible). It's perfect IMHO."
Android,3dmdn7,PantlessKitten,2,Sat Jul 18 08:55:07 2015 UTC,"The sim card is just a user id connected to the phone number. My idea is that you buy a number and then you can use it wherever you want, it's the smartphone that send the pin and it's checked on the carrier side. In this way you can use it on multiple phones at the same time or you can use multiple numbers on the same phone, or even use it on a friend phone as guest. I said controlled by the carrier because if the manufacturer is the one with the gate key, Apple will try some nasty thing as usual to trap and lock people in their system."

The report refers to the new standard as an embedded SIM — or an e-SIM — which would remain inside the phone and give consumers the ability to switch carriers without getting a new card, rather than locking them into a specific carrier, as they do now. That means no more swapping SIMs to switch phones or carriers; it would all be done through an interface on the device"
Android,3dmdn7,smartfon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:13:44 2015 UTC,"What they say and what they do are separate entities. I don't trust them and would guess that it will give them more tools to be able to lock you in. Of course, they can do it now by limiting the radio frequencies."

Android,3dmdn7,Alltrix,2,Sat Jul 18 16:40:31 2015 UTC,Honestly this sounds like some sort of walled trap. I dont use CDMA because I dont want to futz with ESNs and Verizon/Sprint/Alltel/etc telling me which phone I can or cant use. Plus I like using MVNos in America instead of the large branded carriers and those guys tend to use SIMs. Sounds like it's not really a problem using a SIM hell when I was traveling alot it was way convenient to just pop in a local SIM and call it a wrap. Especially when I had dual SIM phones
Android,3dmdn7,UHRXMG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:36:18 2015 UTC,How hard could it be to use the phone number of the SIM as identification and the PIN to make it secure. So whenever you power up a phone it asks for a phone number and a pin then it connects to the network and that's all. I don't developing the technology to do this would be THAT hard.
Android,3dmdn7,UHRXMG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:58:36 2015 UTC,Yes :-)
Android,3dmdn7,dlerium,-5,Sun Jul 19 03:03:26 2015 UTC,"Why all the hate?  I see that being able to take your SIM card out, and put it in another phone is a great thing, but will probably not be used often.  However with no physical SIM could the software not be implemented to have multiple SIM cards on the same phone? like 2, 3, 4?  In my head it depends on how it will be implemented. I imagine a scenario where the carrier sends a SIM card request to your phone, which you then have to accept or install or whatever. Might even be done totally unrelated to the network, but by receiving an activation file by email? Also the ability to change freely between accepted SIM cards."
Android,3dmdn7,UHRXMG,9,Mon Jul 20 13:49:48 2015 UTC,"Because think of Verizon. I know they now use SIMs with LTE, but the CDMA portion is essentially SIM-less. Prior to the move to LTE (and it might somewhat apply today), you needed to give Verizon your ESN # and then they activate the phone on their network. IT was up to them to accept or deny phones. SO even though Sprint phones were 100% compatible in CDMA with Verizon phones, they never let you use a Sprint phone on their network. They know the ESN #s of phones stamped with Verizon logos.  This is bad. Now compare with AT&T. I've been buying unlocked phones since 2004. It doesn't matter WHAT phone you bring, as long as the bands are compatible, I stick my SIM in and it connects. So remember that Nexus 5 that did have Verizon's Band 4 and CDMA access? It doesn't matter what AT&T says about the Nexus 5--unless they blacklist all N5 IMEIs, I can stick a SIM in knowing that it has all the necessary bands, and then I'm on their network.  The current SIM situation is beautiful. This new system could be abused. Could it also be setup to work just as well? Let's wait and see."
Android,3dmdn7,dlerium,-4,Fri Jul 17 18:28:16 2015 UTC,"So the standard should be designed to make Verizon happy? How about they adapt, and if not they just dont get to have any new phones on their network ;-)"

Before the iPhone 6 there was no curved glass so your fingers would glide smoothly over the corner. Even Samsung was the first to bring a curved AMOLED to the market. So next year if the Mi5 has a curve like that will Barra say that all smartphones have to have that? BS. Looking at their marketing and store setup as well as product design they are obviously HUGE Apple fans. Even more so than Samsung ever was. As unfair as it may seem the smartphones we have today was invented by Apple. So if you are going to ""borrow"" aspects from them doesn't it make sense to license those patents? Like everyone else? Problem here is...Xiaomi never did. Until recently they didnt even abide by Googles/Androids terms of use. Thats why they haven't entered the US/Canada/Eu market because every single tech company including Samsung will smite them. I bet the Xiaomi team are in talks with Apple right now on a settlement of some sort, to avoid a public disaster."

Dude, we've been over this before. The Z3C is smaller than them.  The Z3C is smaller than the 4.5"" SGS2 variant, and only a little bit bigger than the 4"" iP5S, and that's despite it adding waterproofing.  The smaller SGS2 variant and 2011's Galaxy Note were a similar deal  Hell, it's smaller than the 4"" SGS and Droid 4.  The 3.7"" HTC Desire was also around the same size (shorter but thicker), and don't get me started on the Desire HD or the Incredible, let alone the HD2 or the original LG Optimus G.  Oh, and every Nexus since the S has been around there or larger.  .  If you want a flagship phone smaller than the Z3C, then you're not talking about 2011-2012, you're talking about 2008-2009 (and they were all substantially thicker back then, often due to the fairly common keyboards).  Yes, the screens were mostly still smaller in 2011, but the bezels were much bigger (and without waterproofing adding more size), and they all had terrible battery life compared to today (especially compared to the Z3C).  Oh, and the Z5C is going to improve that even further, shrinking the bezels again, adding flapless waterproofing, switching to a more powerful chip (S820), etc.. I just hope they add wireless charging this time, as a waterproof phone can really benefit from it."

Android,3dlzpl,beener,8,Fri Jul 17 14:48:44 2015 UTC,"Things like the size of the action bar and back arrow at the top left are different from other apps and makes Messenger feel out of place. it also uses a custom animation when opening up a message thread, which is jarring when you are used to something else. The status bar also should probably be colored to make the app feel more at home in the multitasking view (and this would be good for branding purposes).

Qualcomm will have to release a new chip this year, else they will be losing a lot of money.  The way i see it is either, Qualcomm releases the 815 and introduces another unwanted CPU, or jump to 820.  As far as i can tell, the only restriction with qualcomm is that the 820 is supposed to be 14nm. this march samsung announced that they can indeed make 14nm chips. before samsung, only intel was able to achieve that and intel doesn't share.. ever.  Wishful thinking. we get to see the S820 this year, else for a power user. the only choice would be waiting or the note 5.

It may not be necessary for non gamers but better hardware can subtlety improve the user experience.  The newer generation GPUs have a greater performance/watt, which means they're more efficient which in turn leads to better battery life. A better GPU allows for a ""smoother"" experience throughout UI and apps this won't be immediately noticeable unless compared with a phone with less capable hardware. A more powerful GPU, will improve performance in photo/video editing apps, it can improve the experience in browsers etc."

Android,3dlj3s,wranglingmonkies,5,Fri Jul 17 21:17:05 2015 UTC,"It just feels so secure and solid. The European plug is really bad IMO, out doesn't instill one with confidence when there's 220 volts running through it, and then it's a different sort of plug if it's got a ground lead as well, which is annoying because the non grounded type is reversible yet the grounded type isn't and then many European plug extension cables don't work with certain plugs because of the grounding pin.  The north american style plug is better than the European IMO, but again there's a little bit of wobble and movement when it's connected. Whereas the UK one has a satisfying secureness when it's in, as well as being much safer due to the ground pin (regardless of if the device needs a ground) being slightly longer and entering the plug first, which opens little plastic covers on the other two holes, so someone can't electrocute themselves without pushing something into the third hole.  I wholeheartedly recommend them"
Android,3dlj3s,MogwaiAllOnYourFace,2,Fri Jul 17 21:55:36 2015 UTC,"I live in germany and every plug here is reversible, grounded or not. also it doesnt make any difference if the life wire gets cut first or all at the same time. because the european plug is designed in a way that you cant possibly touch any metal on the plug as long as it is still connected in any way. the part about the grounding pin is a very good thing though"
Android,3dlj3s,Treshy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:52:09 2015 UTC,"We have family in France, and on extension cables mostly it has two female pins on each socket and a male ground pin.

Android,3dlj3s,MogwaiAllOnYourFace,2,Fri Jul 17 23:25:54 2015 UTC,"ah so thats what you meant. the euro plug is the one without ground. (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Euro-Flachstecker_2.jpg) and some countrys have a different grounded plug than others. our outlets have 2 metal pieces that function as ground and thr 2 holes for the plug (http://www.elektroversand-schmidt.de/images/jung_es_steckdose.jpg). the plug looks like this (http://www.dienadel.de/cosmoshop/default/pix/a/n/1348829285-30964.5.jpg). note the metal piece on the side? it is on the other side as well, making it reversible. the hole is for the french outlets with the pin sticking out I think, so that one isnt reversible."
Android,3dlj3s,Treshy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:54:19 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you mean the French plug when you say talk about the grounded type. I think Schuko is used in more European countries and is always reversible, and there is no grounding prong but side contacts instead (which are the first to make contact, and last to disconnect when unplugging). And yes, it also usually has the plastic covers. It is also super secure (IMHO more so than UK plug, as the socket has a tight-fitting cavity for the plug). I've never used the French one, though, so not sure how it compares.  In my experience Europlugs (the 2-prong ungrounded flat ones) wobble less or at least no more than US plugs, and, more importantly, only the tips are conductive, so there are no live parts exposed if the plug is not fully connected."

Android,3dmdsc,gliz5714,3,Fri Jul 17 14:17:40 2015 UTC,Probably depending on market... They have used both chips in different markets before (I think exynos and SD801 on the S5)

I could understand them using the 808 to reduce manufacturing costs (as it is a larger phone it will likely cost more in materials) or the exynos for consistency, but the two SoC's really arent on the same level at all.

Android,3dmdsc,forgetfularse,2,Fri Jul 17 16:00:37 2015 UTC,"While I'd like to see a 1080p screen as well, the thing is that you'd need to be able to scale interface elements to be smaller.

Android,3div04,guzba,260,Thu Jul 16 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"First... thank you very much for a VERY useful app.  That being said, I have two question:  General Question 1)  I am not just referring to end-to-end encryption, but stolen devices possibly having sensitive data in notifications and SMS.  What are your future plans for security?  Something as simple as ""notifications expire after <userSetAmountOfTime>?  Another method for SMS...  Specific Question 2) The SMS update is amazing and what I have been waiting for!  However, I would assume that the list of conversations on the left would be all my active conversations on my phone.  It oddly also contains the secondary phone numbers (home/work) from contacts which I have a conversation going with (as a separate empty conversation), random other contacts (power company for example), and archived conversations (I understand this one may be difficult to detect as ""not active"" as not all SMS apps have this feature.)  Are any of these known bugs?"
Android,3div04,random_123,114,Thu Jul 16 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"The case of a stolen device is handled by removing the device from your account. That should log you out of that device and delete all the local data in it. Having said that, you should probably have a Google or iOS-wide clear my device remotely app set up.  The issues you list on two we are aware of. We just released the feature so we're still working to get everything fixed and polished. Some of these we just don't know (like you said, it's difficult) which ones are active, etc... It's a bit tricky."

I understand this is a somewhat normal practice (Google Photos, as a recent example) and that these URLs are long and likely difficult to guess, but a lot of people's MMS's are private.  The sender of an MMS doesn't expect their image to be uploaded to the internet, by default, at a public URL.  I also imagine Google may have better resources to detect a machine scraping for these URLs better than a smaller team like Pushbullet.  Do you plan to address this or enable a setting to disable MMS's showing up in the Pushbullet plugin?  I love your software and it makes my life easier - but I do have concerns, would love to hear your take."
Android,3div04,treeform,21,Thu Jul 16 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"The SMS support is optional right now. You can disable it, its kind of confusing place (we will make it better) by going to the Android's app settings, notifications, only for some apps, disable texting. That should be it.

Android,3div04,drbeer,18,Thu Jul 16 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"Would love an option for disabling MMS - please!  Again, I just don't think its fair to upload them, by default, as many senders would not appreciate that."
Android,3div04,canireddit,17,Thu Jul 16 20:18:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the thing that scares me most about this is that it's a public URL and you don't have a say in whether or not they get uploaded."
Android,3div04,SirPribsy,14,Thu Jul 16 17:38:56 2015 UTC,"a public URL is actually extremely secure if it's a randomized string of characters, and the string can't be tied to some pattern linking to you or your other photos. It's the same thing Google Photos does.   *Edit - OK maybe it's only extremely secure if there's also a monitor that keeps track of access and flags/blocks brute force attempts that access many photos across multiple accounts in quick succession. Not sure Pushbullet has the resources to do this."

Android,3div04,veeti,21,Thu Jul 16 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't. A properly random identifier of sufficient length is impossible to predict. The more apt analogy would be leaving your wallet in a random bush in a park with, say, 2128 bushes."
Android,3div04,Borgbox,12,Thu Jul 16 21:22:38 2015 UTC,"But quite literally, though, it's not about randomization. It's about the fact that people don't want their MMS or photos to be posted to the internet at all.  The thing about the internet is, as soon as something is put on the internet; it's forever.  Let me see if I can think of an analogy. How about if you use your own camera to take a photo and you show the picture you take to someone whom you want to see it, then a random passer-by observes you showing your intended recipient and snaps their own photo of your photo and puts their copy in a very very large public art gallery.  Sure, it may take some time before another unintended recipient finds it but now it's in a place where anybody who has a desire to may go and search for it."
Android,3div04,veeti,6,Thu Jul 16 21:36:10 2015 UTC,"I never argued otherwise. All I'm saying is that random identifiers are a secure scheme and claiming it is ""about as safe as leaving your wallet in a random bush in the park"" is utter nonsense."

Android,3div04,kare_kano,6,Thu Jul 16 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"""Impossible to predict"" is a very tall order for cryptography. Most random number generators merely make it ""very difficult"".  Even assuming it's a very good random generation algorithm (is it? we don't know, nobody audited the code yet), there are lots of other ways in which the URL can be disclosed: browser caches, history, proxies, caching proxies, HTTP referrals etc. In keeping with our analogy, there's a billion bushes but one has footprints leading up to it.  And this is without considering the day someone hacks in and grabs the whole list of numbers.  With services where the sharing is explicit it's understandable to not bother with any real safeguards. After all, you shared it with at least one other person, on purpose, the cat is out of the bag. But if you didn't mean to share it with anybody else it's not alright for it to be available on the Internet."
Android,3div04,veeti,7,Thu Jul 16 21:43:04 2015 UTC,"Most random number generators merely make it ""very difficult"".   It sounds like you know how ""very difficult"" it is. Since encryption is based on randomly generated keys as well, is it also ""security by obscurity""?   there are lots of other ways in which the URL can be disclosed: browser caches, history   If the link is cached locally then the picture itself is most likely present as well.   proxies, caching proxies, HTTP referrals   The URL is a part of the encrypted HTTPS request body. Referrals from secure contexts aren't passed to insecure ones.     it's understandable to not bother with any real safeguards   I don't disagree that I wouldn't want Pushbullet doing this for my messages either without end to end encryption, but a random identifier is a perfectly fine and ""real"" safeguard."

Is there a plan to have a ""light"" version, where you just have the basic features?  Also, some pushes do not dissappear anymore, is that a bug?"
Android,3div04,yarian,19,Thu Jul 16 17:07:44 2015 UTC,"We haven't abandoned the concept of easy notification alerts, we still have those. The universal messenger is an idea we're still fleshing out but the idea is to bring the best qualities of pushing to yourself to everyone.   Not sure where you click the link, clicking a link you send yourself it should take you to the link, not the chat window. Unless it's from somebody else.  As for a light version, we're open to the idea of separating different parts of the functionality into different apps.

Android,3div04,theroflcoptr,266,Fri Jul 17 06:05:16 2015 UTC,"We already use proper security, the same as Gmail, your bank, Facebook, etc.  We also had a lengthy discussion on this topic here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3bplym/hey_randroid_pb_dev_here_lets_talk_about_endtoend/  The big question I asked was, what does end-to-end encryption get you? The conclusion was it would prevent us from being vulnerable to subpoenas from the government or being hacked. (Many think it keeps your data more private but that's not true, as discussed in the post.)  To be clear, I want us to add end-to-end encryption. It's simply better to have it than not, and I like the sentiment behind it. I personally don't want us to have to store personal data, but much of PB can't work without doing it.  Regarding ""proper security"", I find that a misleading statement. Essentially no services you use have end-to-end encryption. Not Gmail, not hangouts, not Amazon, not your bank, no one. We have the same security in place as all of them.  I'm really curious about one thing myself--why does this topic always get so aggressive? Even this first question is off to a touchy start."
Android,3div04,geekamongus,22,Thu Jul 16 17:33:47 2015 UTC,"Your analogy is flawed. Amazon doesn't use end to end because amazon IS the end. With pushbullet, I am both ends and pushbullet is the carrier. End-to-end encryption in this case is functionally equivalent to Amazon using HTTPS; the endpoints can see the data but the carrier cannot. I don't think ""proper security"" is misleading in the slightest here."
Android,3div04,Natanael_L,9,Thu Jul 16 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"The lack of understanding these basic concepts is what gives me little faith in the Pushbullet app to safeguard my information.  If it's all unencrypted on their servers, what comfort can be provided to assure me that their team is trustworthy and trained to be vigilant against things such as spearphishing? That their network security is up to par? That their physical security is strong?  These things become much less concerning (though they don't go away completely) if I know my data is encrypted on the server."
Android,3div04,frayesto,57,Fri Jul 17 01:24:52 2015 UTC,"The aggressive tone is probably because 2FA security and more is incredibly important, and you haven't yet proven yourself to be as good at security as Google and Amazon.

Android,3div04,i_lack_imagination,6,Thu Jul 16 19:09:29 2015 UTC,"We also had a lengthy discussion on this topic ... The big question I asked was, what does end-to-end encryption get you?   Piece of advice to you from a consumer to a new CEO.  Stop arguing with your users about what they want.  This never goes well.     why does this topic always get so aggressive?   It's clear you think you know better than your users about what they desire but in reality you're just mentally masturbating with strawman arguments while the real users of your product are getting upset that you are not listening to what they want."
Android,3div04,Travis_Cooldown,14,Thu Jul 16 22:32:03 2015 UTC,"The whole point of end-to-end is to remove the requirement of trusting the middleman. When the data is encrypted even as it passes through your servers, that alone is a huge plus to privacy. I fail to understand how you can see it any other way.   I'm not sure if you read the link that they provided, but if you are referring to pushbullet as the middleman here, then they answered this. Unless they open-source their software, you have to trust their implementation of the encryption.    The problem is, if you want end-to-end encryption because you don't trust us, you're still totally trusting us. It doesn't make almost any difference. If you don't trust us, why are you going to somehow trust us to not sneak your decryption key to our servers? If we were evil, this would not be hard and completely defeats end-to-end encryption."
Android,3div04,i_lack_imagination,17,Fri Jul 17 08:05:18 2015 UTC,"But what about the concern of someone gaining access to their servers? Google was mentioned earlier, but they are a huge company with what I imagine must be some of the best security in the biz protecting their servers.  Meanwhile, pushbullet is a tiny startup that's gaining more and more users. It's only going to get more appealing for someone to try and break in. I'd feel much better knowing that even if pushbullet's servers were breached, the hackers would have useless encrypted data."
Android,3div04,Travis_Cooldown,10,Thu Jul 16 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"Of course that is an area of concern, I wasn't trying to say that encryption doesn't matter there. I was just replying to the specific concern that if you don't trust pushbullet not to read your messages, then you can't trust them to implement encryption correctly either.  I'd much rather see encryption than not, especially for disallowing eavesdropping from other parties, but without open source software you can't do much but trust the company or not use the service."
Android,3div04,i_lack_imagination,10,Thu Jul 16 19:14:02 2015 UTC,"It's a bit hard to totally trust them with how weirdly they've handled this. First it was radio silence, then it was like they were scratching their heads trying to figure out why their users would want it at all. I'd think my example is a pretty obvious reason to have it. Even now we don't really have a response. /u/guzba said he wants to implement it...does that mean we're getting it in the future? Or never? They've been so cagey about it for no reason."
Android,3div04,fourg,6,Thu Jul 16 19:46:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly I agree that it's a little off-putting, and as others have said, considering that we didn't pay for the app, it makes us that much more wary. I just don't know if anyone who is suspicious of PushBullet is actually going to be satisfied with end-to-end encryption if they get it at this point. For the people who already have their suspicions raised about Pushbullet developers, at this point nothing short of open-source software or an open API allowing others to make open-source software is going to make them feel better.  So then the question isn't if they are being cagey about the encryption, it's being cagey about whether or not they want to allow open source software. Whether or not it's fair for them to do that I don't know. Does it potentially lower the value of their software/company if the clients are open source? If so, then it makes sense that they're cagey about it. Is there some other issue that could arise for them by having open source clients? I don't know enough about that to say, I'm sure others do, but my point is, if there are such issues, then to me that seems to be where you question if the cagey behavior fits."
Android,3div04,lnked_list,3,Thu Jul 16 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"There are a number of developers that get validated by the security community without going open source.  Look at something like LastPass.  They describe in great detail the encryption they've put into place and thanks to that have been validated by a number of security experts.  They are also very transparent anytime a security risk presents itself.    PB could do the same explaining how they did it and be validated by the security community.  It still comes down to trusting they're actually doing what they say, but if they are found to be lying they're as good as dead so it's in their best interest."
Android,3div04,thecodingdude,18,Thu Jul 16 20:20:35 2015 UTC,"There was an alternative solution provided over in the thread:  ""With end-to-end encryption and your API kept public, I could create an open source client in which I would completely trust. Or you could open source your clients. "" . Some people use encryption over gmail too and because the protocol is open, apps like k9 mail can encrypt the mail, send it, have google receive garbage and so on.

I hope they can prove me wrong and demonstrate they take this issue seriously. Personally, I want a straight up answer, are they going to add e2ee or not, and if so, when can this be expected?

Just because you don't know what's coming up for the company doesn't mean they don't have a ""solid business model."" They wouldn't have gotten backed by VCs or received seed money if they had no business model.  So far they have done nothing that is unseemly. I find it ridiculous how this community has turned on them because of the lack of end-to-end encryption. Is it an issue? Yeah, but it's not like Pushbullet guys have done anything else to lose my trust.

Android,3div04,DinsFire64,23,Thu Jul 16 19:53:13 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the community buzz is a lack of understanding of end-to-end vs the encryption in transmission.  The later is seemingly already in place - as in, someone listening to the same wireless network as you only sees encrypted traffic.  (server-to-client).  E2E encryption isn't very common in any service we use, but would guarantee* that nothing in the middle was intercepted (ISPs for example).  PushBullet would still be ""trusted"" in an end-to-end encryption.  I don't exactly see what the fear is myself.  I use Google Hangouts, Facebook messenger, etc. and don't expect E2E.  I think it may just be people aren't fully understanding what they are asking for.  That said, I think Pushbullet hasn't done a terrific job at explaining it themselves.  *Nothing on the internet is secure as a US citizen or someone using a US-based network to transmit data.

Android,3div04,Avamander,8,Thu Jul 16 19:16:12 2015 UTC,"Your understanding is correct. It is difficult for someone to intercept and ""pretend"" to be PushBullet like in my example, but not to say unfeasible.  With a product such as this I am just reluctant to trust another company to control aspects of my phone. I already have to trust Google in this ecosystem and the Play Services has been a bother more than once if I may say so myself.  The fear that I have is if someone were to gain access to their servers, spoof their servers and protocol via MITM, or get copies of the data (even though it is stored for a such short period of time), all of the information that I shared the service with is private.  All of this escalates when I realize some of the control that PushBullet has over the phone. I am extremely reluctant to give SMS sending abilities to software that can be controlled from afar. I don't want the possibility of someone pretending to be me.  But maybe that is just where it comes to the fact that ""maybe the product isn't for me.""  Would E2E encryption magically make me want to use the product? Probably not, but if anything it is just another safety net. And in the ages of hacking, government interest in spying, ease of access of tools, and with a smart group of people in a new startup that is connected so closely to the user's data, I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be used."

They are private messages between loved ones, friends, coworkers and the like.  Now in this day in age what is stopping someone from using a GSM sniffer and reading the messages as they go in and out? Or getting T-Mobile to release documentation? Not much other than the hardware, know how, and experience. All of which is fairly cheap in this day in age.  But what I am concerned with if I were to use your product is the assurance that the message that displays on my computer is in fact sent from my phone and has not been modified along the way.  It is easy for a networking route to be compromised with a MITM attack depending on location, and if this attack happens to occur while I'm responding to a message from a loved one, I don't want a third party pretending to be me.   I don't want to be chatting with my girlfriend with my laptop while I get my car fixed over their free wifi and have the bloke next to me intercept the conversation pretending to be me. And on the same note I want to ensure that messages that arrive on my laptop are indeed from her and have not been modified to include asking for favors, black mailing, etc.  My point is this, yes you are doing a fantastic job with security in your product, but when it comes to my phone I don't want to take any chances. I want to know that the connection from my phone and other devices are as secure as possible especially with a newer product that has dedicated developers at the wheel."
Android,3div04,frayesto,21,Thu Jul 16 23:18:30 2015 UTC,"I am not a security wiz by any standards, however, I think what the dev is saying is that your scenario of    I don't want to be chatting with my girlfriend with my laptop while I get my car fixed over their free wifi and have the bloke next to me intercept the conversation pretending to be me.   is impossible.  They use encryption from your laptop to their servers and then decrypt the message and then ecrypt it from their servers to your other devices.  When people are saying end-to-end encryption they want it encrypted from your device to their servers (still encrypted) and then down to your other devices, where they are then decrypted, so that only the sending device and receiving device ever see the unencrypted message.  How they have it now (as I understand it) is safe from a man in the middle attack.  It is not safe, however, if pushbullet is compromised either by the government or hackers, essentially becoming the man in the middle.  Edit: The dev saying    Essentially no services you use have end-to-end encryption   may be essentially correct.  However, a service I do use every day, Plex, does have end-to-end encryption.  It took them a while to do this and I think at great financial cost (something I don't know that Pushbullet could afford).  https://blog.plex.tv/2015/06/04/its-not-easy-being-green-secure-communication-arrives/."
Android,3div04,amkoi,4,Fri Jul 17 03:40:51 2015 UTC,"This still isn't a real answer.   The reason it seems to get touchy/aggressive is because they is a lack of communication on the part of PB.   Either say, yes we will offer true encryption and are working on it, or we will not offer end-to-end encryption and this is why."
Android,3div04,TNoD,3,Thu Jul 16 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"(Many think it keeps your data more private but that's not true, as discussed in the post.)   (From said post:)   If you don't trust us, why are you going to somehow trust us to not sneak your decryption key to our servers?   One can just monitor the traffic going out from the Pushbullet app, just like people did with the (completely proprietary) WhatsApp traffic. If you steal keys it will show up.   We would encrypt and drecrypt using a password you enter in both places.   You might want to use certificates. Passwords are weak most of the time if user chosen and a hassle otherwise."
Android,3div04,recalculated,2,Thu Jul 16 19:22:39 2015 UTC,"We know all these big companies let the government tap into their databases at will and they don't need subpeonas, I personally don't think those companies want to, but they have to. I don't know if pushbullet is part of that yet, but there's no way I'd want to use pushbullet knowing all this while there is no E2EE.   Also, a branch of Google has been developing open-sourced integration of pgp/gpg easily into Gmail (look up End-to-end).  I think you're asking the wrong questions, it's not ""nobody is doing it, so why should we""? It's the community asking you to be on the forefront of innovation and privacy. Do it for us.   The issue of privacy is still very new in terms of what was revealed by Snowden so there hasn't been much time to adapt yet. Everything needs to incorporate E2EE."
Android,3div04,tgunter,21,Thu Jul 16 22:29:20 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Coupled with this concerning line in the privacy policy:   We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.   So basically, Pushbullet can do whatever the fuck they want with everyone's data as long as the people they're selling it to say ""don't worry, we'll keep this a secret."""

Android,3div04,ccrama,18,Thu Jul 16 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"d in development? When did you have the idea to create Pushbullet?   Pushbullet started off as a side project by /u/guzba, who is now our CEO. Five of us were working at Hipmunk at the time (awesome way to search for flights and hotels). Ryan came in on a Monday and started to show us this app he built in his spare time to easily send links and files from Chrome to his phone.  It was put on a shelf for about a year before we went through Y Combinator as turned Pushbullet into a real company. When the three founders got together they rewrote most of it."
Android,3div04,yarian,7,Thu Jul 16 18:34:03 2015 UTC,That's awesome! What are you guys' backgrounds in development?
Android,3div04,ccrama,17,Thu Jul 16 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"We've really done a lot of different things. The great thing about working at smaller companies (and specially in one or two person development teams) is that you do it all.  We worked on the analytics, crash reporting, the UI, the background processes, the networking, the database layer, the notifications, user accounts, hotel booking, map integration, and basically anything else.  It's very fast-moving sometimes, and you don't get all the time to polish everything up because you have to keep moving, but it's a fun challenge and you learn a lot in a very short period of time.  Edit: Personally, I studied Computer Science at Northeastern University for about 4 years before dropping out to join Hipmunk."
Android,3div04,salisburymistake,6,Thu Jul 16 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"Very cool! This sounds like something I'd like to do in the future, and I will be going into college in the computer program in the fall. Thanks for the answer!"
Android,3div04,yarian,12,Thu Jul 16 17:25:41 2015 UTC,"Are there any plans to incorporate the Nearby API?  Right now, in order to push things to others you have to be friends with them on Pushbullet. I think it would be neat if you could have more of a temporary, anonymous connection with people you don't necessarily want to be friends with. Like, if you meet a dude and he shows you a cool picture on his phone that you'd like him to send to you, or he has directions to the after party, instead of him getting your email or phone number or friending you on Facebook, he could do a one-time push to your phone.  Admittedly, there aren't a lot of use cases but I'm of the mind that cool shit should be made for cool shit's sake."
Android,3div04,sirhc6,10,Thu Jul 16 17:33:15 2015 UTC,I love all of this. Just found out about beacons yesterday and they sound amazing.

Maybe even use nearby to add people. Having to go to the mobile site to add friends is really a pain when doing it from the app would be so much quicker."
Android,3div04,deathless203,4,Thu Jul 16 22:32:15 2015 UTC,"You'd definitely need some method to curb spam. Maybe you could specify a keyword or hashtag? Actually, that would be really neat. Then you could link up a bunch of people at the same event and you could all push and receive photos with each other. Sure you could do something similar via Facebook or Instagram, but this keeps it all local to your devices and wouldn't be posted to a feed for all to see. Sort of an adhoc mini social network. I like it."

Android,3div04,indeedelle,19,Thu Jul 16 17:04:58 2015 UTC,"A couple of questions in regards to Portal:   Will Portal gain the ability to send files to a computer from your phone? iirc Portal only sends files the other way. Will there be a PC program for Portal, or perhaps offer integration with Pushbullet for PC? I'd rather have a dedicated app than use my web browser for file transfers."
Android,3div04,luckybuilder,19,Thu Jul 16 17:55:25 2015 UTC,"Portal will eventually be able to send files in all directions, yes.

Android,3div04,breul99,11,Thu Jul 16 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"I definitely think portal should be integrated into pushbullet. You've built an incredible amount of momentum with pushbullet. I'd even go as far to say that it's /r/android's favorite app. You also already have a desktop pushbullet app. From what I can see, you have all your bases covered with pushbullet.   Portal, on the other hand, just complicates things. Now we need two apps for complete functionality both on desktop and mobile. Also, you're losing out on a lot of brand recognition."

Android,3div04,devopia,2,Thu Jul 16 18:47:29 2015 UTC,"Yes it's my primary OS. It would depend on the amount of functionality I'm getting from it, so for a word processor or a web browser, sure that's fair. But for something like pushbullet... I'm not sure if that kind of overhead trade off is fair. It would also be interesting to have a cli-only version that conforms to the general unix philosophy and could be chained with other programs. For instance a notification triggering events on a server/device."

Android,3div04,super_cr7,28,Thu Jul 16 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"Reddit took venture funding and needed to make profit to appease investors. They tried to monetize the AMA, fucked up big time and faced epic backlash, to inappropriate proportion. PushBullet got some funding and also needs to make profit. Did you learn anything from backlash reddit faced and do you foresee anything like that in PB's future?  P.S. - I'm not saying PB shouldn't monetize. Of course it should and it will. My question is geared towards whether Reddit incident effected their strategy / plans.  P.S 2 - When can I see bulk delete option for old pushes?"
Android,3div04,_chinchillin,61,Thu Jul 16 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"Reddit is actually a pretty personal issue for us. 5 of the 7 of us worked together at Hipmunk, the company /u/spez started after leaving reddit. He's a big supporter of ours and we all really respect and look up to him. The fact that he's back as CEO of reddit should make everyone feel much better about where reddit is headed, I say this knowing him personally.  Pushbullet did take venture funding which does mean we have certain expectations. We've taken seed funding, which is the earliest and smallest (relative) amount of investment. The goal of taking this investment was to be able to focus on our product to prove that we could make it useful to a larger audience. This made sense because we've been growing as an app with far more success than ""normal"".  Getting Pushbullet to the point it can support itself (monetize) clearly will need to happen. Fortunately we have at least one obvious strategy, which is freemium. This is where much of our app is free, and the rest comes with a pro account or similar. As a productivity app, this is a natural fit and doesn't betray any of the work we've done so far. I'm sure we will be upset if we begin to charge for features, but I don't think it will cause people to be quite as much as reddit has managed to upset people.  To your P.S 2 - you can clear your entire history here: https://www.pushbullet.com/#settings/history, we're bringing multi-select back on Android, and I think deleting per stream would be great too."
Android,3div04,StovetopLuddite,24,Thu Jul 16 17:34:30 2015 UTC,"My experience is - if a product is free for a long time and later charges for something/anything, people go apeshit and treat it like ""bait n switch"". PB is so popular, I'm willing to bet at least half of your userbase will fit that bill. Entitlement. I hope you guys find a balanced solution.  The link for delete will delete entire history. What I was requesting is selective bulk deletion. For example, delete all pushes from certain channel and certain person. OR select all pushes from this device, other than this-this-this push (i.e. select all and then tap-tap-tap to deselect a few) and delete them."
Android,3div04,armando_rod,22,Thu Jul 16 17:01:05 2015 UTC,"Gmail has been free, but you can pay for more storage. The point is free should be setup to give you a reasonable product especially if the product was once ONLY free. If you add paid tiered services, you need to make sure people aren't feeling like they must upgrade or that's the only way to get a decent experience.  That's why freemium games like Clash of Clans do so well, whereas the other ones where you desperately need IAP to even play effectively fall flat. People need to enjoy the experience without feeling that big of a drive to make purchases. Some still will, but its a careful balance the developer needs to find."
Android,3div04,rpr69,3,Thu Jul 16 17:15:55 2015 UTC,Yeah! I think PB can go the Pocket way. Charging for extra features not interfering with the important components.

I have gotten into the habit of using Portal to transfer my music from my computer to my phone. Whenever I use Portal for this, it transfers the music just fine (it shows up in my file manager). However (and I've tried this with both Phonograph and Shuttle+), my music player cannot read the music files after transferred through Portal.  In order to fix this, I have to power off and reboot my device. Also, when this happens, I get the GCM error regarding Pushbullet which won't fix itself unless I switch to mobile data if I'm on Wi-Fi or vice-versa.

One thing I will check is the Friends nearby and Places nearby apps on my own Facebook. I don't remember ever adding them and it could be causing Facebook to keep polling Play Services.   An issue I have with the Facebook app stems from what I can see on Greenify. If I don't cut off wake-up paths, then Facebook seems to show as awake within Greenify pretty much every time I use another app. Open Instagram? Facebook is awake. Hit home button and use Nova launcher? Facebook is awake. Uploading pictures to Google Drive? Facebook is awake.  I would love the Facebook app to be more like Instagram. It's there when I want to use it, it doesn't cause excessive wakes or battery use and notifications just work."

Android,3dkpfi,taario,5,Fri Jul 17 15:22:38 2015 UTC,"Great post, thanks for the data. Would be nice to see a few follow-ups if you have the time.  The issue I have with Facebook - even Facebook lite - is that their push service runs all the time even with notifications turned off completely. MQTT is a pretty cool and efficient protocol, but I'd really rather not have it run 24/7 unnecessarily when Google's cloud service is perfectly acceptable for virtually every other app."
Android,3dkpfi,taario,5,Fri Jul 17 03:56:11 2015 UTC,"My understanding from discussing with the Greenify developer is that MQTT is only used when messenger is in the foreground so you get an instant response as GCM does have lag sometimes. If you look in Greenify, it will mark Facebook and Messenger as using GCM, which is why you can Greenify both apps and still receive notifications.  So unless you are actively using Messenger for many hours of the day, I don't think it should be an issue.  As for follow up, I will. I know its hard to hold me to it, but I'm pretty anal retentive about battery. Its easiest to do it during weekdays, so I'll probably give it a shot tomorrow or next week. After all I should be working and not on my phone right?

She is not rooted or has any battery apps but the upgrade from 4.4 to 5.0 killed her phone essentially. It drained 15-20% per hour and was always overheating. We did a factory reset after a week of this hell and even then it drains poorly--maybe not as bad and the overheating is gone at least (I figured something was keeping the CPU pegged at 100% or whatever). Then another OTA came maybe around April or so and once again she saw super rapid drain again prompting another factory reset.  She used to be able to get by the whole day on 4.4 without charging and her battery life was very comparable to my 4.4 battery life on my OPO. Now she's constantly on a hunt for a charger. The Battery % screen never looks suspicious, but I'm guessing her mobile radio stats are horrible.  Also are you on WiFi most of the time or cellular data?

Android,3dkpfi,cjeremy,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"Perhaps this is just me, but I thought I would share. I have been getting immense battery drain on my S6 since I purchased it, main culprits were Facebook and Facebook Messenger. Finally, after much deliberation, I disabled both Facebook Messenger and Facebook, and downloaded Tinfoil instead.  My RAM usage immediately dropped, consistently, from 80-85% used on idle, to 70-75% used on idle. When being used, the highest it goes is 80%, versus 90% before. I did this in the middle of a usage cycle, and even so, you can really see what a difference it made just by looking at the battery usage graph. Sharp drop from 100%, and all of a sudden, at around 50%, the graph stabilizes and plateaus. Idle battery drain went from 2-3% per hour to 0-1%. Overnight last night, my battery drain was 1% for the whole night, when it's usually a whole lot more, sometimes 8-10%, with wifi off and data off.  I'd say, for me anyway, those are some fantastic numbers. Samsung's RAM management is indeed aggressive, so a lot of RAM will be used naturally, but Facebook and its Messenger were only exacerbating the problem. Tinfoil allows me to still use Facebook without any of those nasty aftereffects.  Obligatory Google Play Services is a RAM hog and battery killer, because, you know, it really is.  EDIT: a word."

Instead I'm left with a sub par (sometimes above average, depends) camera with buggy unrealiable modes, terrible low light performance and so-so manual functions. Videography is basic. I wished it had a feature or mode or two like the iPhones that can make sometimes, something stunning. It makes a great high end typical cameraphone atleast I can say that much.  My Z1C was a great phone and served me well. I've move on to an Asus Zenfone 2 but I did it without the high expectations that came with Sony. I'm very happy thus far."

I have used a bunch of Sony phones (Xperia S, P, ion, TL, Z, Z Ultra, Z1, Z2, Z3) and have never been impressed with their low light capabilities. Way too much noise. In bright outdoor shots the pictures are amazing but as soon as the light is limited you see lots of noise.   Considering changing to the LG G4 for better control of the camera settings and hopefully better low light shots.   It's too bad because I really like the Sony UI and hardware designs.

If you've rooted your phone but you haven't installed SuperSU/SuperUser/any other root manager, apps can run as root without asking.  Even if you're good with all of those things, I could still probably trick you into giving my app root access pretty easily. I can pretend to be a different app, I can give you an innocent explanation, I can stimulate a tap at the same time the prompt comes up, and depending on which root management app you have, I might even be able to draw over the ""accept"" and ""decline"" buttons to make them appear to be swapped.

Android,3dkpob,---s-t-e-v-e---,34,Fri Jul 17 11:17:28 2015 UTC,"That's impossible to do.  Let's say the pattern lock dots are represented like this:  123 456 789   You can represent pattern locks like a PIN… right? So let's have a simple pattern lock: 1739, like an N.  …however, that's the same as 1475369 as 4, 5 and 6 must be passed through when going through the pattern. You can try it on an actual device: ""skipping"" pattern lock dots will still unlock your device, the same as not skipping dots.  So… if you randomise pattern lock dots, you may end up in a situation where you skip dots like from 9 to 3, which will give you a completely different passcode. And then that's impossible to unlock."

Android,3dkpob,generko,10,Fri Jul 17 11:45:31 2015 UTC,"They're saying that when you have a pattern, any dot between two sequential dots is automatically included. You can't just curve your finger around the middle dot and leave it out. Someone might think that their pattern is a 4-point ""N"", but the computer knows that as an 8-dot sequence.  So if a randomized layout puts a dot between two dots in your sequence, you have no way to input your code. The only ways around this are to make it not entirely random(you'll end up with only a few scrambles that work, plus rotations)or change the basic rules and let people weave between dots using squiggle lines instead of straight ones.  ELI5 answer: Unlocking with a pattern is like being a baserunner in baseball, to go from 1st base to 3rd you have to tag 2nd. Now imagine that I say that we're randomly swapping 3rd base with 2nd base, but you still have to run the lanes, there's no skipping a base you run past, and you have to go 1-2-3 or we call you out. It doesn't work, the rules don't let you advance past 1st base."

We could first make a random of the nine numbers to get a random starting point. After this, if we have eg. number 2 on position 6, the next number could be in position 2/3/5/8/9. Randomise that and you have the first line. Keep on doing this and we have a working pattern system, of course it cant be the single balls, but requires to be numbered or marked someway. Also the rest of the numbers remaining, a random scramble for empty slots.  Now I wish I could code java to make this into a app..."

Android,3dsw12,firefiend,-5,Sun Jul 19 05:16:28 2015 UTC,"I can understand these points, but what ends up happening is people use their 32gb or 64gb cards to capacity, and then leave their phones storage empty, aside from OS and Apps, obviously.  My other caveat of removable storage, as well as removable batteries, is that offering these two, usually, at least in Samsung's case, ends up meaning a non metal built device. Then, those people who cried about a lack of sd card and removable battery, are upset because the device is largely made of plastic, and feels cheap.  I'll take my data plan, cloud storage, and a solidly built metal device over anything else right now."

Also once the battery goes on an iPhone it's a must to replace the unit.  On a device with a removable back, you can extend the life of your phone.

With cloud storage, like Dropbox and Google drive, it is not a one-time fee, it is a yearly charge, usually to the tune of a hundred bucks or so, every year, until the end of time. This charge also does not include the cost of the data that you will use to access the files in the cloud.    Outside of pictures, you don't need one.

The people that want and use an SD card, like myself,  are normally talking about media. I have about 20 gigs of music and another 30-40 gigs of movies and TV shows on my card so that I can stream them to my chromecast without a computer. An SD card is essential for me and I wouldn't consider a phone less than 128 gb in size that didn't have one. I consider myself a power user and I get the absolute most that I can from my phones. For the average user they normally wouldn't need an SD. For people like myself though, it is essential. The fact that they make phones with a laughable 32gb total storage anymore is ridiculous.

Android,3dsw12,DustbinK,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:46:19 2015 UTC,Yeah the problems that I run into are more of a speed issue. The wifi at my house has a lot of interference and I haven't bought a good AC router yet. Even with a good gigabit direct connection to the router I can never get more than 40 mbps transfer rate. I was usually streaming outside of my house though because it was always just easier to stream local media to my chromecast than to use the Nas stream when I was home. I'll be springing for a better router soon though and then the Nas setup should be a lot better for streaming from the home to hotels and whatnot.

You debate like a 7 year old.  microSD cards are cheaper per gb. microSD cards are easily transferrable when you buy a new phones microSD cards can be transferred quickly between different devices. I can plug in a microSD card into a laptop and watch movies at my friend's house in an instant. Or transfer large files. microSD cards can be replaced if memory ever dies, without having to replace a whole phone. microSD cards can be swapped out depending on what you need. Movies on one card, music on another, etc.  For a lot of people, this stuff matters. If none of these scenarios apply to you, that's fine. Just don't use it. The presence of microSD doesn't impact you in any way except MAYBE waterproofing, but you can waterproof and have microSD as proven by several phones now, so it's not even a good argument not to have it.  EDIT: Oh, here's actually my favorite reason to include microSD. Motorola saved money by releasing the Moto E with 8gb of storage. That savings gets passed along to me. I didn't have to buy a 32gb phone costing another ~$100-$150. I just popped in a $14 microSD card to handle it instead. And when I get my next phone, I won't even have to spend $14, since I'll have this microSD card already."

Android,3dsw12,AdmiralCrunch9,2,Mon Jul 20 20:37:39 2015 UTC,I don't see why your personal use case should be deciding the design of the majority of phones. MicroSD cards are a stopgap solution and nothing more.

I'm just explaining to you why a lot of people actually have a use for them.  Very few people have music collections as large as yours, and so the problem you're running into with SD cards is not one most people will have.  For the people who are in a situation like yours, or who have almost no music to store, SD cards are a non-issue.  For me and the other people in this thread, they're a life saver.    Oh, and beyond the music storage, SD cards also make backup apps like Titanium much more useful.  Android M might be making that obsolete with automatic cloud app backups, but we'll have to wait and see how well it's implemented."

If you have 16GB of internal storage then you have enough for apps, backups, etc. Trying to design Android around SD cards is ultimately limiting which is why we've seen them treated so poorly by Google and why things like just making them internal storage (enjoy your poor read/write speeds btw) is what they have to go with."
Android,3dsw12,DustbinK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:26 2015 UTC,"It's not about storage with TB, it's that you can factory reset the phone or flash a rom without erasing your backup.  Same goes for all of my podcasts and music stored on the SD card.  They all stay right where they're supposed to be while the phone's internal memory gets wiped.  And since basically all I keep on the card are pictures and audio files, read/write is basically a non-issue.  That's the only limitation you run into when you design a phone with them(besides space, but that's generally not the issue), and it's completely circumvented by simply storing only the correct things on the card."

And since basically all I keep on the card are pictures and audio files, read/write is basically a non-issue.   I was talking in general and not your use case. Your use case isn't relevant here and neither is mine. SD cards are slower, making them internal storage and using them for apps makes those apps slower.   and it's completely circumvented by simply storing only the correct things on the card.   Except that Google themselves disagree that this is simple which is why it was so restrictive in 4.4 and why they're now going with the ability to make them act as internal storage. People shouldn't have to worry about where the data is stored. Thus, why it's only a stopgap."

I don't need truckloads of space, and internal space is more convenient than external storage. But I can buy a name brand 64GB card for $22 any time, while a 16GB -> 64GB upgrade must be selected at time of phone purchase and might cost $200.  Which leads to the most vehement objectors, who feel like the SD card support is being removed simply to force us to pay exorbitant prices for storage upgrades."
Android,3dsw12,peasncarrots20,8,Sun Jul 19 03:49:08 2015 UTC,"We already pay exuberant prices for phones! The thing is though that even name brand SD cards tend to read/write slower than local storage, and as a result can cause a slower experience which people may blame on the OEM of the phone. That's likely a major reason to get rid of SD cards, and Google's reasoning for not having them on Nexus devices. Other manufacturers also likely did it for their own convenience and to make extra money since more people would opt for a larger phone size when there isn't SD card support."

Android,3dsw12,Bantag,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:04 2015 UTC,So doing something with the internal storage trips the bootloader? I haven't heard about that. Are you sure you're not talking about two completely different things? On the Z3c you have to dual boot to bypass the bootloader without tripping the unlock but storage is not at all relevant to that process. What would Samsung be doing? They wouldn't be able to tell if the file you loaded onto the internal storage is a ROM.

Android,3dmcp0,Comment-Leaver,6,Fri Jul 17 13:04:41 2015 UTC,"Guitarist and pianist checking in!  First up, this is a very cool idea. As you'll find out, though, the ""ideal"" app for musicians is tough to make because all of us are pretty darn different. Take the guitar: my preferred method of learning a song is by hearing it, slowing it down, and actually playing along by ear to learn the riffs + strumming patterns. For me, an app that slows music down and/or displayed the chord while doing this would be cool. That's just me though: someone else might hate this implementation completely.  I probably didn't give you the answer you wanted, but it's a good place to start - narrowing down exactly what you want to do. More importantly, rather than doing many things okay, I think it'd be better if your app started by doing one thing extremely well.   Good luck! I'll also be downloading G Chords and trying it over the weekend - I'll leave a review for sure :)"

I hadn't considered slowing down audio, as its not something I've ever done, but I know you can slow youtube videos, so I'll definitely look into that!   Thanks for checking out my app, id love to hear what you think, and what I can do to improve it. When you've been working on something for a while its easy to miss something obvious to another pair of eyes!   Cheers!"
Android,3dmcp0,sonorangoose,8,Fri Jul 17 22:49:11 2015 UTC,The reason why probably has to do with (lack of) low latency audio support on Android.
Android,3dmcp0,_pelya,2,Fri Jul 17 22:06:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's definitely a factor! iOS runs circles around android in that regard... Saying that though apps such as caustic provide an excellent user experience! I don't know how the dev did it, must be a miricle worker! Haha"
Android,3dmcp0,BenPistlewizard,3,Fri Jul 17 22:50:51 2015 UTC,Are you aware of this open-source app made by a Googler which shows how to minimize audio latency?  Samsung has their own SDK for low-latency audio

Android,3dl87a,run400,7,Fri Jul 17 15:44:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true about Apple Pay and the media hype. And if Google Wallet/ Android Pay suddenly had this feature /r/android would be ecstatic, instead there has been a lot of negativity and false claims about Samsung Pay on /r/android. I think the real excitement will come when Samsung releases the first commercials for it and people actually see S6 users using it.  I'm still amazed about how intrigued people get when they see me use my LoopPay."

I assume the password would work fine for Samsung Pay, but obviously that would be a hassle and defeat the purpose of the fingerprint reader.  I have totally wiped my 4 fingerprints and re-entered them, and this didn't help.  It works most of the time, but it'll get finicky and not work. Very annoying. I think it prompts me to restart the phone, too, but that doesn't work."
Android,3dl87a,DesertPunked,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:33:15 2015 UTC,That actually sounds like your phone is in dire need of a factory reset. The possibility of the programming code itself becoming corrupt isn't as low as you would imagine. In fact 1 in 10 phones I think are known/expected to have a hardware defect.
Android,3dl87a,NewToKansasCity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:50:11 2015 UTC,Do I have to take it in to the T-Mobile store?
Android,3dl87a,DesertPunked,0,Sun Jul 19 00:18:37 2015 UTC,"The employees there could probably do it for you if they're willing, but it is something you can do on your own.   Since you can get into your phone you'll go with a soft reset.   Directions are as follows. Go into settings, Under the Personal section (should be yellow/orange) at the very bottom you'll find ""back up and reset"". Inside that option menu at the bottom again you'll find ""factory data reset"". Then pay attention to the instructions, and warnings as you get closer to the delete all option. It'll delete your phone and reset to be just like new.   There's no going back on this!"

Android,3dl87a,AshTheGoblin,0,Sun Jul 19 01:27:24 2015 UTC,"My fingerprint reader on my S6 works great and I've had it since launch. The only time I have noticed it has some trouble is immediately after I got out of a long shower and I had prune hands, though it still worked after a couple of tries. In my experience it works just as well as the reader on the iPhone 6. Do you work a job where you use your hands heavily? Or get calluses or other injuries to your finger tips that would cause the appearance/texture of your fingertips to change frequently? In any case, I would clear out the existing fingerprint data on your S6 and try setting it up again and be sure to follow the onscreen instructions carefully."
Android,3dl87a,Leprecon,96,Sat Jul 18 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"A comment from that video: ""Samsung pay is less secure than the apple pay because it shows your expiration date and the person name on the card.""   What? So does an actual card."
Android,3dl87a,FreshOllie,39,Fri Jul 17 05:12:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some people are just trying to find fault with it because it competes with both Apple Pay and Google Wallet. Even if you use a physical card, the merchant is within their right to match the last four digits of your card to the one on the receipt and to compare the signature on your card to the one on your receipt if it's a signature transaction. They can also request to see an ID for Discover and AMEX transactions and can refuse a transaction if you refuse to show ID for those cards. Visa and Mastercard don't allow merchants to require an ID. Samsung Pay allows you to flip the card and show your signature if the cashier requests it."
Android,3dl87a,TheRealKidkudi,23,Fri Jul 17 05:21:14 2015 UTC,"A comment from that video: ""Samsung pay is less secure than the apple pay because it shows your expiration date and the person name on the card.""   Hence the person said it is less secure than apple pay. If the guy wanted to say 'is less secure than an actual card' then they would have said that...  Credit cards are vulnerable to theft in regular usage. Giving your card to a random waiter does take with it some risk, and a lot of people get their info stolen that way."
Android,3dl87a,SWATZombies,3,Fri Jul 17 08:33:37 2015 UTC,"The last four digits are on your receipt and on the screen on most POS terminals to help prevent fraud and for record keeping. The last four digits are not going to compromise your card. This is more than likely to facilitate you if you are trying to determine which card you used to pay in the event of a refund. Where the cashier asks for the ""VISA ending in 1234""."

Android,3dl87a,DesertPunked,19,Fri Jul 17 12:06:59 2015 UTC,"A few places do, like restaurants and the apple store. A few weeks ago I went to the Apple store to get my mother's iPhone screen fixed and when it was time to pay I asked if I could use Google Wallet and the guy seemed confused and said "" Sure, How do you do that?"" and I just held my S6 edge to his terminal and the payment went through. The people at the genius bar seemed annoyed when they realized that I paid with Google Wallet on a Samsung  phone in the Apple store."
Android,3dl87a,nDQ9UeOr,7,Fri Jul 17 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"The people at the genius bar seemed annoyed when they realized that I paid with Google Wallet on a Samsung  phone in the Apple store.   That seems petty. The Apple store and its employees have no reason to care what form of payment you use - just that the store gets your money. The only people who have an excuse to be annoyed at anyone's use of Google Wallet would be the people on the Apple Pay team who are relying on its widespread adoption, and even then I would expect them to realize that someone not using their platform is just evidence that it isn't compelling enough."
Android,3dl87a,preprandial,9,Fri Jul 17 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"The employees at that store were just rude in general. It was like a circus in there in the middle of a week day with a bunch of people being trained on using their iPhones, taking photos, installing apps etc and a long line of people waiting for service. That was my first time in an Apple store and it was a terrible experience. I showed up on time for my appointment had had to wait 45 minutes to an hour past that before I could talk to someone. They kept telling me to just go look at the Apple watches during this time. Then the guy that I spoke with about fixing the screen was very rude. The fact that there was a negative reaction to me using Google Wallet to pay did not surprise me. I suspect if they knew I was going to pay with a phone other than an iPhone, they would have told me that it wouldn't work."
Android,3dl87a,tmiw,2,Fri Jul 17 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, most of my experiences when getting a device checked had always been negative. I was always turned away saying you just need to reset the device, or your phone's battery life sucks, deal with it, and these guys were often short, and act like I'm wasting their time. The only positive experience was when I bought a Macbook pro recently, and I reckon it's because they have to treat someone right if they're dropping a huge amount of money."

Android,3dl87a,Charwinger21,-6,Fri Jul 17 14:33:45 2015 UTC,"The statement is still true. It is less secure than Apple Pay, and ""only"" as secure as a regular card."
Android,3dl87a,condor85,9,Fri Jul 17 10:29:34 2015 UTC,"No, it's just as secure as an Apple Pay payment or a chip & pin payment.

Android,3dl87a,honestbleeps,6,Fri Jul 17 04:23:44 2015 UTC,How is this compared to Google wallet?
Android,3dl87a,bizzenwoof,8,Fri Jul 17 06:18:18 2015 UTC,"It's more secure for one, the tokenization is not cloud based like it is with Google Wallet/Android Pay because it uses the secure element in the S6 and Note 5 to pass along the EVM cryptograms. Also, there is more privacy since Samsung is not mining your transaction data the way Google is. It's also accepted at millions more places because it works with NFC like Google Wallet AND it works on any old credit card reader using magnetic secure transactions. NFC adoption is slow here in the U.S. and will unfortunately remain slow, so if you actually want to use your mobile wallet at more that 10% of the places you go, then Samsung Pay is a much better option."
Android,3dl87a,sargunster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:31:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer! Can you explain how it works without nfc more? How does it work pagnetically without sliding something past the magnets?
Android,3dl87a,dragon50305,7,Fri Jul 17 12:05:55 2015 UTC,"It sends a magnetic pulse which mimics the pulse generated by a card swipe. Only the data is in the form of an EVM cryptogram, so it's much more secure than simply swiping a card."
Android,3dl87a,WaywardWit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"Hey not trying to hate but I am Apple only and I love the idea of using the magnetic strip with Looppay. However, NFC adoption is growing a good amount just based on Apple Pay coming out and I don't think it's gonna stop anytime soon. Even Chevron now takes NFC payments. The only places I think they need to add contactless payments are Publix and Kroger."
Android,3dl87a,JarrettP,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:48:24 2015 UTC,"It's a stop gap measure that allows Samsung users to enjoy almost universal mobile payment acceptance while making those magstripe transactions just as secure as a NFC transaction. As more retailers add NFC it won't really make a difference to Samsung Pay users since they can use either to make the same secure payments. The unfortunate thing about NFC adoption is that it's going much slower than anyone imagined it would. Some merchants may never adopt it, as they can use EVM terminals without NFC, or turn of NFC features to save money (some merchants pay more for activated features on their terminals)"
Android,3dl87a,ukfashman,-9,Sat Jul 18 15:31:15 2015 UTC,This is not more secure than Google Wallet. NFC will always be more secure.
Android,3dl87a,JarrettP,15,Fri Jul 17 08:39:33 2015 UTC,"It is more secure. Samsung Pay passes EVM cryptograms over BOTH NFC & Magstripe transactions which are passed on by the secure element on the S6, both are tokenized. Google Wallet doesn't use a secure element (not anymore) they rely on a cloud based solution to tokenize the transactions, which is naturally less secure. Perhaps Android Pay, will be more secure than Google Wallet, but phones would need the secure element to make use of it."
Android,3dl87a,stereosteam,2,Fri Jul 17 08:49:45 2015 UTC,"It is more secure. Samsung Pay passes EVM cryptograms over BOTH NFC & Magstripe transactions which are passed on by the secure element on the S6, both are tokenized.   No, it does one or the other. It doesn't use both simultaneously. That's not a security feature, that's a convenience feature.   Google Wallet doesn't use a secure element (not anymore) they rely on a cloud based solution to tokenize the transactions, which is naturally less secure.   Google switched from a physical token to HCE because of security issues and vendor lockout issues caused by using said physical token.   HCE is substantially more secure, as it provides far more protection against privilege escalation issues.  Samsung's solution is still pretty damn good though."
Android,3dl87a,DyingWolf,0,Sat Jul 18 07:33:13 2015 UTC,Both NFC and Magstripe transactions are EVM cryptograms. Both NFC and MST signals are initiated when you pick a card and verify with your fingerprint. The choice as to which method you use is yours and depends on what's available on the terminal. Either type of transaction is just as secure as the other.
Android,3dl87a,Akashady47,0,Sat Jul 18 14:55:15 2015 UTC,"Google's switch had nothing to do with security and was about getting around carriers blocking Google Wallet and enabling more phones to be compatible with GW. Google's method is less secure in that it adds a third party to the transaction who we have to hope secures their data properly. Unlike Google, Samsung doesn't have any access to your transaction data or account information."

Android,3dl87a,jwwpua,4,Fri Jul 17 14:17:23 2015 UTC,Samsung has no access to your card information and it's not stored on the device. Your bank/card provider provides a temporary account number which needs a secured code from your phone to transfer the EVM cryptogram  to the payment processor. Samsung never has your account numbers.
Android,3dl87a,-Rivox-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:12:45 2015 UTC,does this temporary account number mean that you won't receive category-specific cashback rewards from your credit card provider just like with Google Wallet?

Android,3dl87a,OssotSromo,8,Fri Jul 17 17:46:50 2015 UTC,I think I read that you can disable the gesture and just use the app launcher if you prefer.
Android,3dl87a,PrototypeT800,2,Fri Jul 17 05:06:03 2015 UTC,"why is that? the gesture seems awesome, works with the screen off."
Android,3dl87a,PrototypeT800,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be necessary for NFC transactions (like Google Wallet) and while I understand why you need some user input for the loop pay method, I'm generally against hidden triggers for core functionality."
Android,3dl87a,i_forgot_me_password,2,Fri Jul 17 18:09:51 2015 UTC,I don't think it's necessary for nfc. That's probably just for the loop method.
Android,3dl87a,i_forgot_me_password,7,Fri Jul 17 18:18:50 2015 UTC,Compared to Apple Pay demo (the keyword being the demo not the technology):  http://youtu.be/4I9MbIrlEUw  the Samsung Pay demo seems a bit cluttered. What's with all that button presssing? And does the person has to wear all that jewelry on her wrist.
Android,3dl87a,i_forgot_me_password,23,Fri Jul 17 08:48:38 2015 UTC,"The difference is that the total was already ready (staged) in the apple pay demo and in the Samsung demo they were adding items to the total first, then completing the transaction and showing the steps for that particular terminal. Some of which would normally be automated, like printing the receipt. I thought that was rather obvious. They could have streamlined the demo, like Apple, but it doesn't really change how the transactions go through."
Android,3dl87a,fuck_jews_911,2,Fri Jul 17 08:58:45 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I was thinking, Apple just didn't show any of those steps. Looks to be just as simple and thought out as Apple pay."
Android,3dl87a,fuck_jews_911,-4,Fri Jul 17 16:04:30 2015 UTC,"The samsung pay system requires the user to launch the service, then authenticate, then scan. The apple pay one will automatically launch when it is near an NFC payment, and the user scans his/her thumbprint. Very similar, but more convenient on the apple end IMO."
Android,3dl87a,fuck_jews_911,3,Fri Jul 17 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"Any NFC payment app (or any NFC capable payment app) - including Samsung Pay - set as default on Android KitKat or later will auto launch when the device's NFC antenna is near an NFC POS terminal and subsequently asks you to authenticate, even from the lockscreen, the screen just needs to be on. So I fail to see your point; S Pay and A Pay are just as convenient as the other and are effectively the same."
Android,3dl87a,solid07,2,Fri Jul 17 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's more convenient to have a mobile wallet that works at just about anywhere, rather than a small number of places. I can live with a split second difference and a thumb swipe is not going to kill me."
Android,3dl87a,solid07,3,Fri Jul 17 16:06:45 2015 UTC,Good luck using apple pay when no nfc is available
Android,3dl87a,Understandingly,-5,Fri Jul 17 18:09:04 2015 UTC,That is a significantly better process than anything Samsung or Google has done. Nice.

I don't want to use my credit card to pay for stuff, I want to use my debit card so the money comes from my bank account."
Android,3dl87a,solid07,2,Fri Jul 17 09:36:48 2015 UTC,If it's a Mastercard or Visa debit card it should work.  Edit: It could also depend on your bank. You could always ask your bank if they plan on supporting Samsung Pay and see what they say.
Android,3dl87a,CJC_Swizzy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:40:49 2015 UTC,Could someone elaborate on which countries it will work in on launch and why? As I was under the impression that it would work in almost every country as it is compatible with MST?  I assume there is deals with banks to be had etc. that stops it coming out earlier in countries such as Australia?
Android,3dl87a,soapinmouth,4,Fri Jul 17 09:56:27 2015 UTC,"It will be the US and S.Korea first. Then they will announce other countries. They are making deals with banks and payment processors, so that may affect the timeline for other countries as well."

Android,3dl87a,soapinmouth,3,Fri Jul 17 22:09:48 2015 UTC,"Well with Google Wallet you just install the app, setup tap and pay (has easy instructions). Then when you're asked to pay and the terminal has the contactless payment icon on it, you touch your phone with it, it'll beep, and then you enter your wallet pin of necessary. Done. The transaction details will pop up on your phone too!  Apple Pay is basically the same.  Apple Pay and Google Wallet need an NFC enabled phone (almost all phones these days do) and an NFC capable terminal (they have that logo you described on it)  Samsung Pay can be used the same way, but can ALSO be used with regular card swipe terminals. You hold your phone near the swipe reader and it'll work its magic :) you need an S6 for this."
Android,3dl87a,solid07,2,Sat Jul 18 00:40:58 2015 UTC,Any news of it coming to the GS5? Or is it only S6 and up?
Android,3dl87a,soapinmouth,3,Fri Jul 17 08:26:41 2015 UTC,Just make sure you don't buy an S6 and trip Knox and expect Samsung Pay to work. There are probably going to be a lot of S6 users on /r/android who are not going to be able to use Samsung Pay because they've tripped their Knox.
Android,3dl87a,solid07,2,Fri Jul 17 09:06:41 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if it will work on 5.0.2 with root...
Android,3dl87a,solid07,2,Fri Jul 17 09:10:28 2015 UTC,"As long as Knox isn't tripped, it could very well work. You could always try it and if it doesn't you could decide then if you want to upgrade or not."

The founder of LoopPay was apart of the team that invented mag stripe readers in the first place. It's pretty cool"

Android,3dl87a,soapinmouth,13,Fri Jul 17 06:59:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I use LoopPay (which it's based on) and it works just about everywhere on the first try. In my own experience Google Wallet has had more hiccups than LoopPay. I've had Google Wallet fail at places that have Google Wallet signage at the register (like at Sprouts). The only two places I currently haven't been able to get LoopPay to work are at CVS and Lowes. Everywhere else I've tried it has worked without a hitch. Keep in mind that MasterCard/Visa and Amex as well as several banks are all partnered with Samsung on this."
Android,3dl87a,solid07,3,Fri Jul 17 07:04:18 2015 UTC,"May I ask, why do you have loop? I've looked into it a few times and I can't find a reason to spend money on it.   I use 1 card 99.9% of the time. Loop requires a card. I have to carry my license on me. I have to have proof of insurance on me. Which means I have to have a wallet with me. Loop would make my wallet millimetres smaller at the cost of $100. Do some people just have way way way more plastic than I do? Or do you live in states where you can magically show digital IDs?"
Android,3dl87a,soapinmouth,7,Fri Jul 17 08:02:55 2015 UTC,"I have a LoopPay fob (which is no longer available on the store). I spent a total of $15.95 (that included shipping) back in February after Samsung announced that they had acquired LoopPay and incorporating the technology into the S6. I had been planing on getting an S6, so this news intrigued me and it just so happened that the fobs were selling for a very good price, so I bought one.  I figured it would fill the wide gap that Google Wallet leaves and I could test it out to see how it works in anticipation of Samsung Pay. Well it certainly does fill the gap in usefulness and I've charged it once since I got it and I think I still have over 70% battery and I use it basically everywhere I can't use my Google Wallet, which is a lot of places. The only places I don't use it are places where the payment terminal is not customer accessible. In those cases I just hand over my card. I do have several credit cards and a couple of debit cards, so it is very handy to have access to them without necessarily having to carry them with me. That allows me to decide which card is best for which transaction and get the best rewards out of the cards that I do have. I do have one card I use as my default, but I can switch between cards with my phone if I need to. I use my LoopPay much much more than I use Google Wallet, just because I can use it just about anywhere.   Another benefit of LoopPay is that I'm not actually pulling my wallet out for transactions, so there is less chance of me losing my wallet. Though if I lose my fob, it's like losing the card that is loaded on there, and someone could use it if they know how it works.   One time I forgot my wallet when I went to go pick up a take out order from a small restaurant and thankfully I had my LoopPay and I was able to show them how to hold it near the terminal and press the button and they kindly obliged and that saved me a trip and cold food. That is a prime example of why acceptance is a huge thing when it comes to mobile wallets. Neither Google Wallet nor Apple Pay would have done me any good in that situation."
Android,3dl87a,solid07,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:41:32 2015 UTC,"I wonder how exactly they will charge your credit card. Unlike Google wallet, Apple pay actually has partnerships with credit card companies so a transaction will be correctly redeemed for the right amount of cash back or points. I bet Samsung just does a blank charge, but I am really hoping it is more like Apple pay."
Android,3dl87a,soapinmouth,6,Fri Jul 17 12:38:08 2015 UTC,"The have partnerships with mastercard,visa, amex, and several banks and processors. Your transactions will pass along data for reward points. EDIT: by the way Google Wallet does also pass transaction data for rewards points, that's not exclusive to Apple Pay."
Android,3din4o,ccrama,92,Thu Jul 16 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"Just installed it! Loving the UI. But a list of criticisms so far:   the upvote and downvote colours seem to be swapped when going into another subreddit with a different colour, I think there should be some transition with the colours   I'll keep updating as I go through with using it   i'd like the ability to swipe out of a post when I'm viewing it more stuff to mess with in the settings would be nice any chance on righter res preview images? Any chance on a go-to button when hitting the subreddit button? I know its in the pullout menu but I think that would be a better slot for it I'd love the ability to sort posts when looking at a profile when I go to the task switched (5.1.1) it shows the subreddit I was in last as a the app title, not sure if that's intentional the casually subscribe feature is an awesome idea! I'd love to see there be a tab or something when going to the 'subs' tab that's up top for casual subs saving posts doesn't seem to be working I think saved and upvoted from the pullout menu might be better suited in the Profile section   Sorry if it seems like this is a lot or im being nit picky! The app is great these are just small things   day and night themes would be icing on the cake! when clicking the edit button on a subreddit in casual reddit's, it brings up the collections page I would kill for an option to remove a subreddit from the action bar list the ability to swipe out of an image or gif (like Google Photos) would be awesome"

And it's going really well! I'm still not totally sold on the action bar UI, but the 'Subs' tab on the far left, Collections, and the latest custom re-ordering features are great steps to remedy my grievances with it (though I think you should just put the collections on the main page like they're normal subreddits, instead of a separate screen).  Being beta, it still has ways to go, of course, but it has great potential, so keep up the good work!

Let me tell you why, even though it's far from perfect, I prefer and use Sync, so you can take what you want from that (I can't stress enough that these are all personal opinions, of course, and are meant to be constructive):   Its card view looks nice, and is very easy to parse. What I mean by ""easy to parse"", let me show you by comparing the same screen on both apps: Sync and Slide.   First of all, on Sync, I can use a big Roboto Light (or Slab) font for titles, so they're really easy to see and read. I'm sure you'll provide more customization options for the Card UI (including corner radius!) in the future, so this is not a big deal.   Second, on this screen we are looking at 3 types of posts: an Image at the top, a Link in the middle, and a Video at the bottom. I like Sync's card version better, because I can instantly tell what type the content is just by skimming it, and know what's gonna happen if I click the card because of it. Only a big picture? Image. A title and a thumbnail? Link. A big picture with a play icon on it? Video. A big picture with ""GIF"" written on it? Gif. Only a title? Self text. In Slide, there is no differentiation and I have to read a text on the bottom left to find it out; but that's a bother, and it adds up to a mild frustration over time.  Third, because you're making every image into a big hero image, the ones with low resolution (coming from the link thumbnails) look pixelated, ruining the pretty, clean layout your app otherwise have (also lowering the information density).  Sync is very easy to navigate, and that's the number one feature I look for in a Reddit client. You just swipe from the left, and all your subreddits are listed there right in the drawer. When you're inside a thread, you don't have to click the back button to go back, you just swipe left. Inside threads, you have two buttons on the bottom to navigate by parent comments (though I'd prefer volume key navigation more, like in Relay). This is why I suggested that you put Collections on the main page, it's just too many steps otherwise.   Before you implemented the 'Subs' tab and custom reordering, Slide was a no no for me, but now I can kinda see myself using it, actually. I especially like the idea of assigning different colors to subreddits so I can put relevant ones side by side (and tell them apart on the Frontpage). That way, the ""side-by-side"" UI actually becomes an asset instead of a hassle for me. I like Collections, too, but even when I'm inside a Collection, I still wanna easily tell which subreddit a post is coming from, so I would prefer 'color groups' to Collections, I think.    Anyway... things like that. Sorry for the length. The 'undifferentiated' card types and general Beta bugginess/slowness keeps me from using Slide as a daily driver for now, but I'm honestly glad I didn't uninstall it back then. I feel very optimistic about its future. Thanks for the hard work!  PS Thanks for playing gifs as mp4s so we can control the playback, that's awesome! If you provided ""share the link OR the image itself"" and ""save as gif OR mp4"" options for media, it would be perfect."

I would guess that Samsung has purposely modified the phone renders being used to make it look slimmer, more elegant, and more marketable. The s-pen is useful but only adds noise in an advertisement unless you're advertising the pen itself. Removable batteries also add unnecessary lines that can break up the look of the phone and detract from the appearance of a case render.

It should even play full screen. It takes a decent WiFi signal but that's what I've been doing with Amazon Prime for months.   [edit: just curious why this is getting downvoted?

Android,3di7v1,superfootbal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:21:04 2015 UTC,Have you personally done this with HBO Now on Android?  I ask because HBO's site specifically states that you cannot output HBO Now over HDMI from any mobile device.
Android,3di7v1,sphigel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:07:47 2015 UTC,It might be hdpc protected. (At least that's what I think it's called when companies prevent people from either recording or sending a signal through an hdmi cable for copyright reasons). I did a quick search the HBO now app prevents you from displaying your phone through hdmi. That's bs.   Edit: looked online and HBO go added support in 2013. I can't see why HBO now wouldn't let you. They'll likely add an update for it.  Edit 2: HBO go is only available to cable subscribers of HBO. HBO now is available to anyone.

Android,3di7v1,denelor17,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:17:53 2015 UTC,Why?
Android,3di7v1,likeaglovebutamit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:04:06 2015 UTC,HBO Go was developed internally.  HBO Now was developed by MLBAM.    http://www.wsj.com/articles/hbo-to-use-mlb-advanced-media-for-stand-alone-streaming-product-1418150584  Side note:  I think MLBAM is one of those awesome little-known stories of internet success.   http://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2014/07/07/the-biggest-media-company-youve-never-heard-of/
Android,3di7v1,denelor17,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:50:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that info, that cleared up the who but not really they why. Maybe I just don't see a difference in what the two are offering. To me it seems silly that HBO is handling the streaming option that comes bundled with cable, and then having an outside company handle the version that is sold separately (thereby creating a middleman content distributor, aka a cable company). And if the content made available to both services is identical (as I assume it should be and is), why couldn't they move forward with HBO Now by simply re-branding the existing app and scaling up their infrastructure? And if MLBAM is so much better at all this then maybe just give them permission to merge and maintain both applications?   The partnering with MLB Advanced Media essentially means the end of HBO’s internal effort to build a stand-alone online streaming product, code-named “Project Maui.” That project would have required hiring several hundred engineers to build out the service, a strategy favored by some at the company.   How is HBO Go not a standalone streaming product that is unlocked by proving your cable subscription includes HBO? Are the videos being hosted by each of the cable providers individually? I assumed the entire catalog of HBO content I was accessing was coming from an HBO server somewhere, and if this is the case I see it as a tremendous waste of money and effort that an entirely new application needs to be built and maintained to access the exact same media files."

Android,3di7v1,Z3ppelinDude93,3,Fri Jul 17 00:17:48 2015 UTC,HBO Go can steam to three devices at once so I'm guessing Now is the same way (haven't ever tried it though)
Android,3di7v1,totalBS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:28:02 2015 UTC,Three would be good - split with a couple friends and its $5

Android,3di7v1,Wrexem,-2,Thu Jul 16 19:57:59 2015 UTC,Point is I never had HBO to begin with. I'd be willing to buy HBO now is it was cheaper. Hell I only pay 8/month for Netflix and they give me way more content.
Android,3di7v1,Gangreless,2,Thu Jul 16 20:04:54 2015 UTC,And they are about to raise prices.

Android,3di7v1,NiceGuyNate,0,Thu Jul 16 22:54:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, meh, it's only 8/month now, with how any hours a day we use it, it'll still be worth it. HBO now just doesn't have enough unique content to justify that price. Amazon prime has quite a few of  the series that they're offering. As others have remarked, the only reason to get it is for GoT. And I can wait until a few mins after its over to watch it."

Android,3di7v1,doodoo_train,6,Thu Jul 16 16:21:56 2015 UTC,Nah. Slingtv actually gives no access to hbogo. They make you watch through through their slingtv app. Sucks.. so I cancelled hbo through them.

Android,3di3s6,kappaofthelight,8,Thu Jul 16 22:03:58 2015 UTC,"It broke notifications for me.   Also, something that has always existed that I hate and never see anyone talk about is how it auto scrolls chat to the newest message which is something the pc client doesn’t do.  I've found no option to turn it off either and don't see many people complain about it which makes me wonder if it only annoys me.   For example,  say I'm back reading a bunch of messages from a friend. If he types me a new message the app auto scrolls down to show me the newest message making me lose the spot I was back reading.  I then need to scroll back up to find my spot again but as soon as he types another new message I get auto scrolled down to the newest message again.  I need to ask them to stop sending me new messages so I have time to back read the previous messages."

It had a 2MP shooter and flash.

There were multiple hits after that like the W810i which actually made it to the US, as well as the K790/K800 series. The K850 in 2007 had Xenon flash.

SE phones were all the rage if you wanted a $400 featurephone without shelling out $600 for a Nokia N91.  There's also that phone signature that many users use in forums that shows their history of phones (I forget what it's called), but you can see the K700 and K750 dominating in 2004 and 2005 as the top phone of those 2 years.  In fact the K750 was one of the highest interest phones in GSM Arena even well after the iPhone  became mainstream.  Here's a snapshot from 2008: https://web.archive.org/web/20080829185018/http://www.gsmarena.com/stats.php3  Sure Nokia's N95 was at the top, but that was a 2007 phone and it was also a $600 phone.

Android,3dinno,choiboy05,0,Fri Jul 17 06:02:45 2015 UTC,"They definitely do research of their own but these days most electronics companies don't make their own components that go into a product. A lot of hardware is bought off Samsung and LG and is just assembled in the company's factory. These days most flagship cellphones use the same main components like snapdragon processors and samsung screens and ram. Plus I'm sure if Google is investing into this Chinese company, they have done their research and deem them worthy of sporting the Nexus name."
Android,3dinno,sw2de3fr4gt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:24:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Most people don't know but China has a HUGE android market. Huge market -> lots of competition -> great for the consumer. There are tonnes of big third-party app stores to overcome censorship by Google and the government. If you just look at the Play Store, you are just scratching the surface.   I had a chance to play with an Honor (6?) recently and the build quality was pretty good. My friend claimed that it had a 2.5 to 3 day battery life which is on par with the Z3. On top of that, dual sim is a pretty standard feature for a Chinese phone."

Android,3dinno,hells_cowbells,6,Fri Jul 17 00:20:35 2015 UTC,Customer service would be my biggest concern. What kind of service is a company with almost no presence in the US going to have?

Android,3dinno,AlexKnolly,2,Thu Jul 16 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"I would like to think that they're generally pretty good.  I've had maybe 3 or 4 exchanges over the last several years (have had three Moto devices), and the first few were fairly positive.    Now, however, I was told my phone would ship within 3 days of them receiving my old one, and they've had my phone for three weeks.  Three times I've been told they'll call me back the next day after they look into it.  Haven't heard back once and have constantly just been given the run-around.  I just want a phone again.  tl;dr: Unfortunately, all it takes is one bad experience to ruin your previous good ones."
Android,3dinno,dlerium,0,Thu Jul 16 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the OnePlus?

They're already the undisputed leaders in wireless infrastructure (i.e.: most mobile networks in the world, no matter the country or the operator, are actually Huawei networks)."
Android,3dinno,Tempeduck,7,Thu Jul 16 19:25:40 2015 UTC,Aren't then banned in a lot of western countries from selling backend equipment?
Android,3dinno,VMX,5,Thu Jul 16 23:28:27 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, only the US government is banning their telecommunications equipment for security concerns (i.e.: they don't trust them).  But in all other countries they're normally one of the first choice vendors (if not the first) when a mobile operator does an RFQ for their network. They've been the world's leading vendor for a few years now.  If you pick any country in the world, it's very likely that at least one or two of the mobile operators in that country are using Huawei infrastructure."
Android,3dinno,Kind_Shibe,3,Fri Jul 17 00:18:58 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure they were not allowed to invest in Australia's National Broadband Network for the same security concerns.

Android,3dinno,SMofJesus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:00:49 2015 UTC,They are cheap but my dads company refuses to work with them. They have loads of backdoors.

My dad refuses to trust them and quite a few electrical  and networking engineers I've talked too don't trust them either. I wish I could remember the stuff that was mentioned but I understood why they were banned. But now the US government most likely does it too so I guess you just need to pick where you want your backdoor to be. /s  Edit: Remembering things: Just even mentioning Huawei made my dad furious. His other reasons where that they undercut everyone and work on quantity not quality. He basically concluded that they were running the good products a lot of americans were developing out of the business/contracts with their reverse engineered versions. People may not agree with me but my dad has been around his field as an engineer. All I'm really saying is research what your getting into especially with what is happening in the tech world these days. I personally won't trust or buy their devices because of what they have demonstrated in every other market they have been in. Maybe Google can prevent that but I'm still skeptical.

Android,3dinno,VMX,3,Fri Jul 17 11:35:44 2015 UTC,"Many people have Huawei phones where I live, and I've tested several of them.  From what I've seen they're up there with the other big brands, and their designs normally have a nice, premium feel to them.  They don't use Qualcomm chipsets, but for the reasons above Huawei has even more experience than Qualcomm when it comes to mobile networks. They're probably the only chipset manufacturer in the world that can say so, which puts them in a very good position. They don't have the huge handicap that Samsung, Intel, MediaTek or Nvidia have."
Android,3dinno,pelvicmomentum,-8,Fri Jul 17 11:36:10 2015 UTC,Huawei has even more experience than Qualcomm when it comes to mobile networks because in my opinion they're nice    hwat
Android,3dinno,mrjojo-san,23,Fri Jul 17 22:31:05 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding what I said.  I work in the field, and Huawei is the leading network infrastructure provider in the world. Most mobile networks in the world are made by Huawei, with Ericsson being a close second (but Ericsson doesn't produce chipsets or phones anymore). This makes them the most experienced vendor as well, which is a massive advantage.  Maybe you don't realize this, but one of the most important things that a phone chipset does is handle the communications between the phone and the network. Throw a crappy chipset in a phone and watch how it constantly loses connectivity because it can't perform handovers properly, see it drain your battery because it can't manage the different network power-states the way it should, expect lots of dropped calls or inability to connect to the optimum serving cell, etc.  As a reference, this is the first time that we get a flagship Samsung phone (Galaxy S6) carrying a non-Qualcomm chipset, and operators are reporting new issues every month experienced by the users. Normally these issues have to be solved by bringing together the chipset manufacturer, the operator and the infrastructure vendor where the issue is happening, and investigating the details.  Huawei has a massive edge here because he's both the network manufacturer and the chipset manufacturer, so their chipsets are likely to behave really really good, given the vast amount of experience and resources to test and debug them themselves in countless networks all over the planet.  It's not my subjective opinion - they're arguably the most important player in the mobile network business."
Android,3dinno,uinstitches,-19,Thu Jul 16 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"So Huawei's got their hands in telecom in China, but things are way different everywhere else. China's government operates mobile networks in China, but pretty much everywhere else mobile networks are owned and operated privately. Because if that Huawei's chipsets are not likely to behave well on American networks. Building network hardware for China doesn't help them in America."

On top of that, I do actually have a brand new tablet, but it runs Windows, which is a fairly decent chunk of users. If they wanted to piss off a good chunk of their potential customers, this is basically exactly the way to do it - selectively roll it out on certain devices and sign silly exclusivity agreements.

Unfortunately everything we see in this range is complete garbage unless you live in an area where your carrier supports the Sony Z3 Compact. (i.e. ATT may not have bands 2/4/12 rolled out, so you don't get LTE) Even then you're using older tech (Snapdragon 801) but still landing in the sub $400 range, which you'd expect for a midrange phone from most companies.  I don't understand this race to have a huge screen. My gut tells me that the increase in screen size is partially due to needing more space for internal components. New features can't exist without taking up space, so more and more space is needed for things like fingerprint scanning. I suppose I feel the same about this strange desire to have the thinnest phone possible. Look what's happened with the iPhone 6+ and it bending near the weakest point.

Android,3do30h,_njd_,-4,Fri Jul 17 23:31:40 2015 UTC,Sometimes you have to accept that the app is less functional than the web-site. Sometimes it takes a browser to get things done.  https://xkcd.com/1174/
Android,3do30h,_njd_,6,Fri Jul 17 23:45:16 2015 UTC,Maybe I should clarify... The music is on my device. Not in the cloud. I'm playing music locally off my device. I wouldn't be able to use the Web Browser to sort and play music on my phones internal storage.
Android,3do30h,kuboa,-1,Fri Jul 17 23:51:29 2015 UTC,"So this is about how GPM imports playlists from other apps? Or are you creating the playlist in GPM?  In GPM, the playlists you create just have the tracks listed in the order you add them, though you can rearrange them using the grab-handles on the left.  In fact every other application I've used that deals with playlists generally saves things in m3u format and doesn't give a damn about the ID3 tags."
Android,3do30h,_njd_,4,Sat Jul 18 00:08:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. m3u's. I make playlists in iTunes. I sync them using iSyncr. iSyncr transfers the music and creates m3u playlist files. Then whatever player I use, Touchwiz, Sense, Shuttle, etc. reads those files and displays the playlists in the correct order. All except GPM. It seems to not care about the m3u's and displays the songs in whatever order it wants (which also doesn't seem to be in order of date modified because files all added the same time are randomized). It reads the playlists and knows they exist, but the songs are out of order.   So it's not even an import issue it seems. GPM doesn't read local m3u's properly. Neither does CM music player. Which seems like a pretty basic function of a music player. And with larger playlists that problem is magnified because all the songs are random and it makes it difficult to find the songs you want to play."
Android,3do30h,_njd_,3,Sat Jul 18 00:18:35 2015 UTC,"Google doesn't care about local files, it's not their focus. Google Photos is wonderful for online but horrible for local, too, for instance (so you use QuickPic for that). Play Books, though a great app for online reading, doesn't even open local books until you upload them first (so you use Moon Reader for that). Etc. If you are a ""mp3s on my sdcard"" guy, just don't use GPM."
Android,3do30h,thoomfish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:46:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice until this week just how terrible Google Photos is with local files: there's no way to delete photos from cloud storage without deleting the original from your device.  Unless you move your local files somewhere else first, where Photos won't look.  Given that Photos can store compressed and degraded copies online, deleting a higher-quality original so readily is a monumental data-loss bug."

I wasn't aware that GPM could even import playlists, although the feature isn't worth shit if it's so broken.  Until now my biggest gripe with GPM was that it doesn't give you much control over which tracks you upload, or mention the file-size of tracks you've uploaded: when I diligently kept folders of <artist>/<album>/<tracks> and stored heavily-compressed VBR versions in a subfolder with them, GPM slurped up both copies and gave me two of each track in every album. Cleaning that up was a real waste of my time.   GPM doesn't read local m3u's properly. Neither does CM music player. Which seems like a pretty basic function of a music player.   Wow. I didn't guess it was such a basic problem.  The whole point of a playlist is that it's a sequence, and the software should preserve the sequence.  How is it possible for them to screw up something so simple? It's just lines in a text file."

Android,3dg50j,Sekrim,168,Thu Jul 16 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"The fix will come. We do actually care a lot about these issues. It's just there's a lot of code to manage.  I don't know how exactly Android functions since I work on a Chrome team, but we will test our code very intensively. It's very possible that fixing it may introduce a new issue, so it's important to be very thorough in testing. That's partially the reason bug fixes take a little while.  Android faces a few challenges that we don't have on Chrome though. For example, Chrome is an ongoing product that can easily be pushed. It doesn't take a lot of effort to update Chrome, and odds are it does it for you by itself in the background. We release a new version every 6 weeks and if a feature is ready, it'll get pushed to the next launch. Otherwise, it'll go to the following release cycle.  Android updates are usually pretty taxing and take a while to do. And your phone is pretty much incapacitated until it's done. So they have fewer release cycles which is why it seems like bug fixes are slower. But each cycle has LOTS of bug fixes.  So don't lose hope! We all work really hard here, so I'm sure the fix will come soon! :)"
Android,3dg50j,nascentt,80,Thu Jul 16 06:39:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the biggesst  issue with Google/Android isn't the slow nature of the fix, it's the slow nature/complete lack of acknowledgement of the issue in the first place.  I have multiple android devices as does each member of my family, and my girlfriend and some of my friends, and colleagues, and we're all suffering from massive issues with Lollipop, and I see the same from google groups, online forum users and reddit users, and yet nothing is ever ackowledged.  All it would take it ""oh dear battery issues found with Lollipop, we'll try and figure out what's causing it and fix asap.""  and ""Ooops, seeing thousands of users are getting major sluggishness on their Lollipop updated devices, will try to get fix done by ETA 1/9/15.  Then at least there would be hope.  We're getting really frustrated with Lollipop, and many of us wish we still had KitKat."
Android,3dg50j,AccidentallyDamocles,18,Thu Jul 16 08:45:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's a customer service failure. I understand that testing a bug fix on a large code base can take time. But in the meantime, Google needs to acknowledge that they're aware of problems like this and working to fix them. I think that would go a long way toward making happier customers."
Android,3dg50j,mph1204,10,Thu Jul 16 14:03:20 2015 UTC,Google has never had customer service as its top priority.  They're a grown up company now.  They need to start paying attention to it.

Assigning to project manager for prioritization.  Project Manager: Assigned to release 4.x, will be looked into in 2016 Q2.   The android bug tracking system is a fucking black hole.

Android,3dg50j,Jedakiah,5,Thu Jul 16 13:59:18 2015 UTC,"Obviously you can not point to another company with well over 1 billion users that does support like that. But, can you point to one at one-tenth the scale, say 100 million users? This is a genuine question. I work in development, and scaling to support people for free open-source products is extremely hard. I honestly don't think it can be done past a certain point, without relying on the community to help each other. But if you know of any examples where you think that their responses are timely and they have found a way to communicate clearly, please share it. I would love to study their methods."
Android,3dg50j,nascentt,10,Thu Jul 16 15:04:29 2015 UTC,"To keep it at scale lets name a pretty big company that announces fixes in advance of release, give etas for patches, and even have a patch release schedule monthly:    Microsoft"
Android,3dg50j,Jedakiah,3,Thu Jul 16 15:40:57 2015 UTC,"They don't have a public Windows bug tracker nor any sort of communication channel like that.  They usually only give ETAs for security patches that are actively exploited in the wild. Not for features or bug fixes. Not free nor open source. Which has a huge impact on how much monetization you can make per product and thus level of support you can offer.   They were naturally the first folks to pop into my head before asking the question. But, it's apples and oranges. Since they do not have a public issue tracker there is really no comparison. That said, their way might just be better and Google should take note. Relying on the your major partners and their tech divisions to give you bug feedback requires a lot less triage and communication than a public tracker."

Android,3dg50j,Zebster10,9,Thu Jul 16 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"AFAIK Google's policies as far as what can be changed from stock Android and shipped in a product are a lot more lax than Microsoft's, and it'd be rather hard to change at this point, and this is done for two reasons:   It helped early adoption. Allowing manufacturer's a customizable, compatible base to work from meant that underlying Android got everywhere, on every cheap $30 smartphone in Kenya to a $2k gold-plated special edition phone sold in the British art market. It's open source. This is important for the long-term sustainability of Android as well as the trust-factor. If people couldn't trust the code, it wouldn't be used in important situations. If people couldn't review the code, working with esoteric hardware would be a lot harder. And if people can build Android distributions hundreds of years from now, even if Google has since disappeared, well that's plain awesome. The difficulty arises in that manufacturer's could (please correct me if I'm wrong) just ignore Google and use Android anyway, but be more ""on their own,"" and (if I remember correctly) unable to use much of Google's branding and important apps like the Play Store, ostensibly ""The Android App Store"" according to most people. Amazon's Android distributions are a prime example of this. (Couldn't resist the pun!)   Let's look at some technical limitations as an example of why Google can't just release patches like Windows: Let's say Google finds a serious bug in Android's bluetooth stack and they patch it. That's great. But could they just push the update to all phones? Let's just look at Samsung for a moment, here. Their ""TouchWiz Suite of Modifications"" even uses their own, modified bluetooth stack. Google not only couldn't patch it, but even if a system were in place to accomplish it, were it not designed specifically to handle Samsung's modifications, the software would only break.  Meanwhile, Windows is closed source, and Microsoft has bullied OEMs for a long time. This is what those antitrust lawsuits were about in the early 2000s. Microsoft wanted to push everyone onto Internet Explorer, which was seen as a separate product to Windows. What an OEM can and cannot do to stock Windows has been an issue for a long time. Sure, we've long had bloatware and media software preloaded, but Alenware's ""Alienware Alpha"" that ships Windows 8, booting to Steam Big Picture, is actually the first time anyone's spat in the face of Microsoft's forced-onto-OEMs desktop paradigm.  Now, Google is trying to resolve all these issues with Google Play Services and all that jazz. For example, they moved Android WebView, the integrated browser-engine that might as well be essential to the system, to the Google Play Store so it could be updated timely, rather than dealing with the old days of Android in which a simple browser update that couldn't be distributed could render entire OS distributions vulnerable. However, there's still a long way to go to clean up Android's fragmentation, and, in some regards, ethical questions of how far they really should go."
Android,3dg50j,iamabra,5,Thu Jul 16 21:18:23 2015 UTC,thank you for the commitment you put into a comment that probably won't be widely seen.    but basically what you're saying is that Windows is basically iOS but distributed to competing manufacturers. did I get that right?
Android,3dg50j,Zebster10,5,Thu Jul 16 21:58:28 2015 UTC,"Windows is basically iOS but distributed to competing manufacturers   Haha, I never thought of it like that, but that's actually a great comparison. You're right, it's basically iOS distributed to the manufacturer's. :D  Now if we really want to get technical on the differences... They're allowed to distribute it preloaded with drivers (to make the hardware work) and some custom apps (as if they could add a few apps to a default iOS install, but not remove any of Apple's), but they can't change the core OS. Meanwhile Android is out there being both literally and figuratively mobile Linux, complete with custom desktop environments and alternative packages for core system services, all able to be redistributed."

But when go somewhere and don't remember to turn of mobile radio (or actually need to use it), my phone goes in a wake lock and if I don't remember in time I don't make the end of the day.  This issue will probably never be solved for my phone. I will hopefully get 5.1 at the end of this year, and I guess Sony will produce M as well, but knowing that it is probably not fixed in M there is no hope. I really like the recent trend of pushing more and more parts of Android to the Play Store. And doing that with web view has prevented a huge disaster.

If your device is rooted, just download Wakelock Detector + better battery stats and compare the time the device lasts on Wifi only and when you are out.   An example from me. When I am at home with Wifi and freshly booted my device (Note Edge) has a ~6-8% Wakelock time, the rest is deepsleep. Once I go out of the house and come back a few hours later my wakelock time is ~90%, so my device basically never goes into deepsleep, it's insane.

Android,3dg50j,johker216,8,Thu Jul 16 11:58:29 2015 UTC,"The difference being that people are reporting smoke but not giving any indicator of where the smoke is so the fire can be tracked. If you're going to post on a bug tracker, then you should be prepared to submit logs. It is ludicrous to assume that Google is going to be able to track down issues based on the vague complaint that the network is draining the battery without assistance. Technology is give and take.  With regards to your car maintenance analogy, the mechanic can pull info from your cars computer if need be. They also tend to take your vehicle from you to look for a problem (cars are orders of magnitudes less complicated than phones). Unless you're willing to send your phone to Google, if you want to help with an issue that you are having, learn to pull a log and offer it to Google."

I will not buy from you or recommend you to others in the future.  No, I do not have an engineering degree and cannot supply you with detailed technical information, but if you want to have a successful business going forward, you need to take my concerns seriously and fix it.  Especially if there are hundreds of similar, vague comments from people like me floating around on the internet, rather than dismissing it  unless I can supply an impossible amount of detail...""  This is exactly the attitude that allowed Apple to climb from near failure to the largest company in the planet - when people had problems getting their PC to work, techs dismissed it with 'update drivers' and a ridiculous amount of configuration requirements to get things working right.  Apple said - 'Screw this, my mother should not learn how to configure the proxies on her router to access the internet, lets make it consumer based rather than tech based.'  And they won.

It's a smartphone; take a guess at just how much code could lead to the mobile radio being active. My guess? Damn near all of it. Logs tell the devs where to look, it's just a fact of life.

In all honestly, the OEMs don't want to release software updates for phones in people's hands until their new flagship with updated OS and features has been released. Blame your OEM and/or that Google allows that (not that they have much to enforce anything else).   Personally I'm hoping a for a future where Android has chunks that are restricted to Google on the fly updates, like most Linux distros and similar to small chrome fixes. Updates that can be done while the device is online with a quick service restart or ""Android System"" restart. I'm not going to hold my breath though"
Android,3dg50j,ianuilliam,2,Thu Jul 16 04:32:21 2015 UTC,They don't cause it but they sure as hell don't prevent it either.

Android,3dg50j,psycam,5,Thu Jul 16 16:55:22 2015 UTC,You can't blame Google/Android for LG taking months to release a phone update.   You can blame Google for their ridiculous update model where every update has to be modified by the phone manufacturer.
Android,3dg50j,awkreddit,2,Thu Jul 16 08:58:47 2015 UTC,No you really can't. That update model is precisely because the oem's choose to modify the os in order to try to differentiate from other devices. Google doesn't make Samsung put touchwiz on top of Android.

My screen of course, is completely shattered and the service center wants me to play almost the price of a full phone for a screen replacement.

The distortion in the audio signal when the volume is cranked up, which for some other audio purposes are undesirable, is a key sound in rock, blues and many other related types of music.

Tube amps aren't better than traditional amps, they serve a different purpose and give a significantly different sound profile to your setup compared to traditional amps. Most tube amps give a more rounded, smooth and warm touch, so it's usually paired with vinyl players.   They cost more simply because they're a lot more difficult to manufacture. It's like comparing a microwave to an oven, similar on the surface but each serve a different purpose.

Android,3di116,atsu333,2,Fri Jul 17 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"this is their entry into the smartphone market. They had to front a lot of money to get production started, whether or not it was by their own plants or if it was made by someone else. Motorola can afford to make those specs cost that much because they've been in the game for years and years, and have all the necessary equipment and knowledge to make a proper phone.   If they sold this for less than $300 it would likely be a loss until they'd sold way more than they thought they would. They know it won't sell well, and it will only really sell to a certain demographic. They know that demographic is willing to spend a little bit extra for a phone with their name on it, and feel safe marketing it at $500. It's still undercutting most flagships, and that's fine. The only thing that looks like it should have been upgraded is the battery, otherwise everything else is decent for the current generation and software."
Android,3di116,SnakeHarmer,3,Fri Jul 17 20:44:18 2015 UTC,"If they felt the production cost was too high to sell the phone at a competitive price, it may have been smarter for them to partner with an existing OEM to include Marshall audio technology in one of their phones.

(Using the Wolfson as the chip, the driving heart for the digital amplification). The two ports actually come in handy here, as one slot would be occupied for the line in on the guitar, and the other can be used as the output for the speakers.  You can even add in effect using apps alike Pocketband, or any of these apps, and I'm pretty sure Marshall will deliver their own garageband-esque app on their phones.

I've seen people commenting on how it's gimmicky, too expensive, and whatnot, even on tech websites. But it certainly feeds a niche that doesn't exist yet or is not catered to; having a pretty feature complete portable audio studio with you. I for one, certainly love to jam anywhere and walk around, just thinking of stuff while absently recording; sitting down at the balcony or whipping out an instant possibility of performing anywhere if I have my electric guitar with me, as opposed to being tied to my battlestation to just be able to record something."

Android,3di116,GentlemanIntheSuit,-14,Thu Jul 16 13:41:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, genuinely. 16gb is 4000 songs, or nearly 17 days of solid music. Assuming you listen to music 6 hours a day, that's more then 2 months before you ever hear a song repeated.  Meaning that anyone with that much music either:  A) never hears most of it  Or  B) has a shit ton of junk music they don't like anymore.  Music lover is one thing.

Android,3di116,ryan_m,17,Thu Jul 16 16:33:48 2015 UTC,"That honestly depends what format/bit rate your music is in.  FLAC files are much larger than MP3 files, and you could probably get around 600 songs into 16GB if the OS didn't exist.  Your estimate of 4000 songs is probably based on 128 kbps which is really low.  A 320 kbps collection would be around 1,400 songs.  My collection is around 20GB, and it's honestly not that much because of larger file sizes.  I enjoy having my entire collection with me so that if I want to listen to a song I like, I can.  That being said, 16GB is really anemic especially if it's being marketed towards music lovers.  That 16GB of storage turns into a lot less once you account for the OS and all of the apps you'll add."

Furthermore, that 16GiB is only about 14.3GB after the decimal-binary conversion, and you have a few gigabytes taken off for the Android OS files, apps and customizations.  I have 4500+ songs and the /music (mix of FLAC and AAC) folder eats 60GB all by itself.

The headphone brand is owned by a company called Zound that also makes Urbanears and two other brands that I've never really heard of (I'm clearly not their target demo).  I guess this phone is to phones what their headphones are to headphones - more expensive because brand, but fundamentally lacking in internals that justify the price. It's a bold move because, with phones, the perceived difference in quality is so much greater than with headphones. You might not notice that your headphones are extremely bass heavy with no mid-range, but you're much more likely to notice a Moto G spec sheet and performance. Props to them for trying - with phones as with headphones, to each their own."

Kind of ashamed to admit my great HP win8.1 2in1 that I scored for about $600 has beats audio. I'd love to see audiotechnica technology put inside a phone, and I don't think that would drive up the price at all.

Probably still are some in shops around the world.  The dude that runs Epiphone, who was a Gibson exec/high-up guy has said he takes a lot of pride in running Epiphone as their own thing and loves competing with the Gibson brand in terms of quality.  We are seeing the same with Squier these days too.  Even the low end Affinity series are better today than they ever were.    Having said that, there will always be lemons.  But I have seen some Gibson Les Paul Standards with gaps in the paint at the neck joint and sloppy bindings and fret issues too.  Lemons happen at all price points, but obviously if one encounters lemons in their first encounters with a brand, that will colour their opinion of that brand, and understandably so."

Android,3di116,movings,2,Thu Jul 16 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"Go used if you want a MIM. They're not worth it full price, imo. You're better getting off a CV Squier if you need new. They are fine instruments, but definitely play the exact guitar you want. You want to avoid playing something badly set up. They'll sound perfectly fine through any quality amp.   I'm of the camp that thinks after $1000~ you're not getting much besides the name and out of the box set up. American Standards are great if you want the guitar to ""just work"" right out of the box, a hardshell case, want the Fender name, and some better pups already installed in the guitar. Otherwise, you're better getting a MIM, a Squier, or putting together your own partscaster and doing the work yourself.   There's also resale value to take in to mind if you think you may sell it in the future. A used American Strat goes for around $800 while a MIM used will get you $300-$400."

The banks are making a ""Liability Shift"" So  ""Any retailers that choose to accept payments made via a chip card’s magnetic strip can continue doing so, but they’ll accept liability for any fraudulent purchases.""

So good luck waiting for for merchants to buy NFC capable terminals (and activate them). A lot of merchants already have cheaper EVM capable terminals which DO NOT have NFC and are not going to waste money on buying NFC terminals. Those merchants will not accept Google Wallet or Apple Pay for the foreseeable future, but they will be instantly Samsung Pay compatible."

Android,3dgma8,leviwhite9,14,Thu Jul 16 13:19:15 2015 UTC,"Imagine a 'carrier' is a router that pushes out a set amount of speed (or spectrum, or bandwidth). T-Mobile's fastest LTE being pushed out of these 'routers' is 40mhz (known as 20x20, 120-160mbps theoretical max speed). Sprint's is 20mhz (60-80mbps theoretical max speed). Sprint flipped the switch on aggregation yesterday, where they can now bundle 2 20mhz signals into 1, making it the same speed or faster than T-Mobile's fastest LTE. in the future they'll add another, making 60mhz. they can do this up to 120mhz in 90% of the top 100 markets (they have a LOT of available spectrum).  TL;DR - Sprint is now as fast, if not faster, than T-Mobile in more places *on phones that support 2x20 CA (galaxy s6, galaxy s6 edge, htc m9, LG G4, LG G Flex 2, probably the next iPhone)"
Android,3dgma8,mitten_mike,2,Thu Jul 16 13:43:08 2015 UTC,Awesome explanation! Thanks for that.   Looks like you've got quite the speed now. Lucky.   My state has about 5 counties on your map. I wish it were easier to get mobile connections in mountainous areas.

Android,3dgma8,whomad1215,3,Thu Jul 16 19:41:14 2015 UTC,"m8 cannot, sorry!   m9 can.   there are 2 types of LTE; TDD and FDD. B41 (Sprint's 2.5ghz) is TDD, which is a lesser used type of LTE, only newer phones can aggregate TDD. your phone supports FDD aggregation, so for instance, it can aggregate 2 T-Mobile 10x10 signals into 20x20. it cannot aggregate 2x20 of TDD though. Snapdragon 805 and 810 are the only chips able to do it right now, as well as whatever the hell the Galaxy S6/S6 Edge use.  and yes, colors are either markets or make it easier to see."
Android,3dgma8,mitten_mike,3,Thu Jul 16 19:53:18 2015 UTC,Spectrum is the bandwith you use to transfer data to your phone. Sprint's bandwith is scattered all over the place into three different areas. This means that you cannot connect to just one and get good speeds. You can combine all three and have a lot of bandwith which increases your download speeds. Which is called carrier aggregation.

The perfect example of this was the Nexus 6 sale. It went in moments, but then it was right back at $500 shipping tomorrow.   This sale had little to do with actual sales and more to do with pushing Prime, Kindle and garage sale type items with something decent thrown in here or there.

It's for that reason I've still kept on using CyanogenMod. These 3rd party ROMs get it--they offer you the few options a user might want, like the ability to toggle battery % in the status bar, etc.  I'm not asking for a long list of options as complex as the Microsoft Outlook Preferences/Options menu--just the ability to set a few choices that most other users would want to be able to have control over."

Android,3dhmao,zpepsin,2,Thu Jul 16 14:08:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, always. But it has always worked. Except for a couple of times. Which makes me certain that it is not the issue here."
Android,3dhmao,stthicket,0,Thu Jul 16 15:24:06 2015 UTC,It's probably because the system has killed the app for one reason or another (AFAIK no non-system app can be 100% sure of not being killed when running in the background).
Android,3dhmao,superherolover,3,Thu Jul 16 15:29:20 2015 UTC,But shouldn't there be an alarm service? Apps don't necessarily need to be running--the services do though. Or a trigger to start a service.
Android,3dhmao,dlerium,2,Fri Jul 17 00:10:17 2015 UTC,The clock app definitely doesn't need to be running all the time that would be a horrible way to code a mobile phone alarm. I'm sure there's a system alarm function.

Android,3dhmao,ynautdoe,-4,Fri Jul 17 06:24:06 2015 UTC,You either had the alarm volume off or you didn't set it properly. It's not a piece of shit just because you used it wrong. And keep in mind that you can't expect things to work well if you're using a touchwiz device.
Android,3dhmao,pelvicmomentum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:39:47 2015 UTC,Just because it hasn't flaked on you yet doesn't mean GP is wrong. That is only one of the bugs this app has.  I run a stock nexus device so you can't blame samsung either.
Android,3dhmao,temp91,2,Thu Jul 16 21:58:27 2015 UTC,I also have a nexus and after missing it a few times (sometimes it would just vibrate with no sound) I finally went to a third party alarm clock.

Android,3dhmao,fjd422,2,Thu Jul 16 23:55:24 2015 UTC,Sleep As Android has been completely reliable for me.
Android,3dhmao,temp91,2,Fri Jul 17 00:49:43 2015 UTC,"But as some users pointed out there is the possibility he was in silent mode and judging by his responses, the OP didn't even really understand silent mode.  My point is confirmation bias is a dangerous thing. Just because you had an issue today doesn't mean its a widespread problem. Don't you think if the alarm was not working that 50% of the Google employees would probably be showing up late for work?  Poor settings choices (like the silent mode implementation) does not necessarily mean that the alarm is broken. I don't think Ive ever had an alarm fail me on the other hand with the exception being when I forgot to charge my phone and it died overnight."

Android,3dj3a4,douknogreg,17,Thu Jul 16 18:59:11 2015 UTC,I love customisation so I'm saying this because I'd really like your app to be good but it looks worse than Google's messenger app in a lot of ways. Make it look at least as good then add the cool stuff on top. And if you're going to call your app material messaging it should really follow the guidelines a lot better.   Send and attach icons do not need shadows. That's just ugly.  Do you really need a hamburger for settings? Sent message icon next to all your messages seems unnecessary.  New message screen obviously needs work. What's with the grey boxes?  Dark theme needs a lot of work. The message boxes have an extremely ugly bright grey glow. The gradient list dividers are not material at all.  Message boxes should have proper card shadows.  Nitpicking but the default animation speed is dreadfully slow.  App icon colours are kinda ugly.    Also I think it would be neat to be able to set the fab colour independently. I personally think it looks better in a complementary colour.

But I agree with all the suggestions to make it better that have been given except the navigation drawer. Keep that. I love the settings all being sleek and right there. I think the three-dot menu is boring and usually just leads to to a settings page where there are like a dozen settings and then settings behind those settings. The navigation drawer is nice and if m9re settings are added, maybe make them collapsible. Or maybe have it where it does bring you to another page in a similar way to YAATA. But please don't make it over saturated with like 100 different settings. It's nice the way it is now, but could use some more customization (meaning colors mainly), some optimization, and some aesthetic fixes.   Otherwise awesome app. I really love it and find it near impossible to leave it.   Edit: auto correct screwed me over."

Android,3dhdaj,MudHolland,70,Thu Jul 16 09:49:54 2015 UTC,"When a chip overheats, it throttles performance. The 810 throttles performance much quicker than other chips.

For a real-world example of the 810 crippling a device, the Sony Xperia Z3+ has an 810. Sony has acknowledged that the phone has an overheating problem, with people reporting the camera app shutting down after only a few seconds of use of its more resource intensive modes."

Android,3dhdaj,strat_0,3,Thu Jul 16 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"It's also important to mention that Z3+ is a completely sealed phone, so OPT might be better in terms of heat dissipation.

In the last OTA I noticed that 2 of the A57 cores are off most of the time."
Android,3dhdaj,alishmufan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:23:38 2015 UTC,"Also the location of the chip matters. The 810 in the Z3+ is located in a bad position, whereas the HTC One M9 has a better location that allows heat to move throughout the body of the phone and not be restricted to one area. As a result it throttles less and doesn't get as hot, nor does it have to shut down due to overheating. Location and chip are both very important when it comes to overheating."
Android,3dhdaj,yoitsjustin,-19,Fri Jul 17 11:49:55 2015 UTC,"Everyone is overusing the word ""overheat"". It's similar to how people say ""electrocution"" to mean anything other than death by electricity. Overheat is specifically to the point of combustion OR the device shuts off to prevent said combustion. Apps closing or processor throttling do not count as overheating. Processor throttling and app closing is to prevent overheating (it hasn't overheated yet). I could write an app that gives a ""Temperature Warning"" at 30C, does that mean that device overheated? No.  It is true to say 810s are slower than 801s after a prolonged time or that you can't use the camera because the system gets too hot. But neither case would be overheating."
Android,3dhdaj,JonnyShips,8,Thu Jul 16 13:55:14 2015 UTC,Overheat to become too hot or to heat to excess.   This is the most commonly used definition and is absolutely accurate in this case.
Android,3dhdaj,dailyapple,2,Thu Jul 16 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"Seriously, people are taking one very specific definition and pretending it's the only way to use a word.

It's a gimmicky thing but it gives oneplus a physical handout for events that actually holds some value (assuming the recipient wants a 1+2) and costs them next to nothing to make.   Say you went to an event and saw 2 companies, one with these physical invite cards and one with a sign up sheet for an email invite.

While that may be true for some people, I think it does a lot more benefit for OnePlus in the long run. Obviously the first benefit is that it gives them tight control of supply, so they can pretty much sell at whatever pace they want, but also it builds hype for the phone because you have all these people fighting for an invite, participating in forums and stupid contests for a shot at an invite, raising awareness. It also builds this air of exclusivity around the device, which might make some people buy the phone on an impulse when they finally do receive an invite, especially if it's a time limited one, because of all these stories of people struggling to get invited.   At the end of the day, if OnePlus had any reason to believe the invite system was damaging them as a company, they wouldn't have stuck with it another time round."

Android,3dhdaj,Omar__Coming,6,Thu Jul 16 14:38:38 2015 UTC,What I'm trying to understand in their reasoning for having the invite system for inventory control purposes but refuse to do pre-orders. Wouldn't that give you a better picture of the product's demand? Are they trying to set a world record for how long a product can be hyped?
Android,3dhdaj,givewhatyouget,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:05:17 2015 UTC,"People get annoyed with preorders more than invites. The OPO had demand that took over 3 months to catch up on, if it had had no invite system this demand may have been even higher - maybe even 5 months.  When you have given someone £270 and they keep it for 3-5 months with no phone, from a unknown Chinese company - you think you have been scanned and get angry.  If you aren't given the chance to buy a phone until it is ready to ship, this doesn't happen."
Android,3dhdaj,oscarandjo,0,Sat Jul 18 10:16:17 2015 UTC,they could do pre orders but theyd rather do #HYPE with mkbhd
Android,3dhdaj,kankaswag,0,Thu Jul 16 13:34:54 2015 UTC,"Because supply chain is something they totally suck at. It doesn't matter if they have pre-orders because then people will pre-order the phone and they won't be able to fulfill many of those orders. So customers wait, get impatient, and cancel the order. So OnePlus might be ramping up to hit that target number, but then have a lot of extra inventory on their hands and angry customers.  Preorders Invites allow them to directly control the ""demand"" and string it out so it is on pace with their supply."
Android,3dhdaj,thinkbox,-1,Thu Jul 16 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"What's to stop you from cancelling your pre-order? Absolutely nothing.  If an invite exists, the phone that goes with it exists. I don't really see what's so difficult about this to understand."

Android,3dhdaj,aurorafluxic,0,Fri Jul 17 00:31:58 2015 UTC,"No, they would time the release in order to get enough inventory to fulfill all of the pre-orders. Companies do this with all different types of products and they don't have issues. Or do what Google did with the Nexus 5, they produced a fair amount to gauge the market and they sold out immediately. For the next two months, people scrambled to get their hands on one. THAT is how you #hype"
Android,3dhdaj,givewhatyouget,0,Fri Jul 17 00:39:18 2015 UTC,"Yes yes, you're an expert in all things distribution and OnePlus couldn't possibly have any logic behind their decision other than to create hype.

Android,3dhdaj,aurorafluxic,0,Fri Jul 17 01:58:43 2015 UTC,Are you thick? People want to give you money NOW and you tell them to wait. Realllly simple for most people to understand.
Android,3dhdaj,givewhatyouget,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:01:20 2015 UTC,"I can't even believe I'm going to take this much time to break this down, but you're clearly lacking in the field of critical thinking.   Pre-purchasing is not pre-ordering. Except for Kickstarter campaigns, no one will take full payment for a product before it launches because no one is that fucking stupid. Ever pre-ordered something on Amazon? You don't get charged until the day before it ships. That system works fine on things like video games where the supply chain isn't a concern and it has a set-in-stone release date and everyone who pre-orders gets one.   If people give you money now and you can't make phones fast enough (which is a very real risk for them, it seems), you'll be holding their money hostage until you can, and people don't like that. You run through buyer protection periods, you lose face from all the people angry that they haven't gotten their phone yet, your support lines get inundated by people asking when their device is going to ship, your social media channels will tank with complaints, and you'll become a poster child of how not to sell a phone, which is certain death for a new phone company.   What, you think people are gonna be fine shelling out $300 to $450 dollars on a phone that could ship within days or could ship in a month? What kind of insanely naive bullshit scenario is that?? What happens when you pay that money, they get the phone prepared and account for all of its costs, and then you cancel your pre-order? What happens when you have to wait so long that the customer decides to buy another phone and asks for a refund? These are support logistics that require an understanding of the bigger picture to see, something that I get the impression your theory is severely lacking in.   It's either that, or pull a Xiaomi or a Google and sell it out in 20 minutes and force people to wait just long enough to be interested in something else. Because hey, fuck all these people that want to buy your phone. They didn't show up to the site at this specific time on this specific day to give us money for this product? Fuck them, the losers. Better luck next time.   Most people don't understand this because it takes 5 seconds longer to think about then the attention span of people like you. With a system where one invite = one phone ready to ship, no one gets screwed out of any money. You're guaranteed a phone with an invite, and if you don't use it in time, it lapses to someone else who will use it in time. They said this is just for inventory control and they have 30 to 50 times more inventory this year, which means this invite system won't last for nearly as long as the OPO's. I mean, you really think that OPO is totally in the black as far as money goes? You don't think they might still be in the red with all the R&D they put into pretty much their only other main product?   They sold more than a million phones since they started. Despite you throwing around your common-sense-ology as though it's fact, the simple truth is that if they though the invite system was hurting them significantly they wouldn't have it in place.   THIS is what I fucking mean when I say I don't know what their distribution and finances look like. You don't know either. This is what I mean by armchair analysts, because if your point of view was so accurate and correct, OnePlus would be dead right now and we wouldn't even be having this conversation. And don't tell me it's about explaining how OnePlus could maximize its profits; you don't give two shits about how much money OnePlus makes, as long as you try and make sure people think you know more than you do about how to ""fix"" things at OnePlus.   But of course, everyone and their mothers know better, and by not following that circle jerk, I have no doubt I'll be tagged as ""OnePlus shill"" in everyone's RES control panels, all because the logic behind invites actually has some sense to it, and I'm approaching it from the point of view that they must know what they're doing and they must know something I do not, seeing as they still exist and are still actively selling making new phones.    Remember how many people proclaimed that the Galaxy S6 would do terribly because it got rid of ""super important things"" like removable batteries and MicroSD slots? How it was going to be a flop because it was trying to be an iPhone and it would fail?  They sold 20,000,000 S6s and Edges. 20. Million. Samsung knows what they're doing. They know what works. Similarly, OnePlus knows what they're doing, and they know what works. The idea that you think it's so clear and so easy to their job is always telling of people who don't understand what they're talking about but want so badly to reduce a complicated issue to a simple one so they can be the messiahs who ""deliver unto us"" the correct way of doing something."

Android,3dhdaj,YukarinVal,4,Thu Jul 16 23:21:59 2015 UTC,"That last line should have said ""invites"" not Preorders.   Also, supply chain isn't something that is easy to do. Price doesn't always go down with volume.  Supply chain is why most Kickstarter projects totally fail, even when they get way more money (and more demand) than they asked for in the first place.  Making 1 thing, 100 things, and 10,000 things is different from making 1 million - 5 million things. Yield, suppliers, timing, and up front costs are totally different when you start getting bigger.  And what if you make 1 million things for the first month, then you sell 10,000 things for the rest of the year? You already ramped up factories and production to sell millions, you can go bankrupt that way.  The widget you make is always most expensive for you to make at launch. The OnePlusTwo might cost a LOT more to make today than it will in January. But if they mismanaged the supply chain, it could cost them a lot more in the long run.  The invite system is a smart way to manage supply chain issues.  And it can be good for marketing too... if people weren't so fucking sick of it."

I can't vouch for the screen and battery life... but the Camera has been on point and you're able to swap out you battery AND have SD expansion."

Car keys, house keys, tv remotes, stereo controls, credit cards, identification, heating, and lighting.  For me losing the IR blaster would be a big hit. That strait up cuts out my ability to control my tv, room fan, stereo system, and wireless candles. That's 4 more remotes I have to bring out of the remote box and keep track of. Or at least I would have to go out and buy a new universal remote.  And lets not forget that I also have settings for: my parents and in-laws theatre setups, a few conference screens at work, and I've used it numerous times at friends houses when they couldn't find their remote to put something on for the kids.

Android,3dhutg,Onionsteak,3,Thu Jul 16 15:30:24 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. They've shamelessly imitated them and copied things to establish an equivalence between the iPhone and Samsung phones in people's eyes. But at the same time they've pursued a very different strategy of throwing every feature possible into their phones, so that people would think about as ""It's like an iPhone but it does more and costs less"". They seem to now be eliminating the ""does more"" part. I can actually see logic in that for the S6. But I don't see any logic in it for the Note, especially when they are launching the S6+, which presumably caters to the ""I just want a large phone dammit"" crowd. Now that the iPhone6+ exists, they need more than ever to have differentiators, and having a true ""power user"" device seems like a valuable market. To just not have a device at all in their portfolio for that market seems like a hugely stupid move to me."

The microSD argument has been debated to death. But I can't find a good reason for a device not to have removable battery, unless it's for waterproofing.

Android,3dhutg,garcia85,7,Thu Jul 16 17:20:53 2015 UTC,"No, because:   Power packs are typically bulkier than batteries for the same mAh. Tethering to a power pack while it is charging the phone is really cumbersome. As the battery's capacity degrades, you'd end up tethering the phone to the power pack more and more frequently. The only alternative for most people at this point would be to buy a new phone. Which is silly if the phone is still working well otherwise.   All these problems can be solved by simply making the battery removable! Sometimes I wonder why we argue so much about something like this."
Android,3dhutg,CervezaPorFavor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:51:12 2015 UTC,Not an argument. I have a Note 3 & have an extra battery for similar reasons mentioned above.

Android,3dhutg,ohcomeonthatsfunny,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:09 2015 UTC,"Oh ok. Yeah, both the microSD and battery issues can be solved (more or less) by buying a larger capacity phone and a power pack.

Android,3dhutg,alle0441,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"It means the phone comes from the factory water-resistant (or nearly).    Water can seep in even more easily through the USB port, the audio port, or the various other orifices of a phone that's not specifically designed to be waterproof. Besides, most people use a case that protects the back entirely. So I don't think this is a real concern for most people.   If you take a trip, bring a battery pack.   I've explained in another post why this is an inferior solution to having removable battery.   My $30 pack has the equivalent charge of 4-5 batteries.   Sure, if you don't mind the weight. Having removable battery means I can have the best of both worlds. On normal days. I simply carry an extra battery with me.

Perhaps again take direction from Sync for Reddit where Imgur images with text are selectable.  Just a couple of thoughts.

Android,3difwa,kingphysics,6,Thu Jul 16 21:47:37 2015 UTC,If this was the new Nexus 5 I'd expect it to be running M. This is probably the G4 Pro.

Android,3difwa,Uskglass_,-5,Thu Jul 16 15:15:56 2015 UTC,"Nexus phones usually use the latest SoC, so if Huawei is using the SD 820, I would expect LG to use the 618 (or 620) assuming they are targeting lower price range."
Android,3difwa,0kpkp0,6,Thu Jul 16 15:28:15 2015 UTC,The Nexus 5 had a lower price yet still carried the SD800... they don't seem to cut costs on the chipset.
Android,3difwa,VMX,0,Thu Jul 16 15:52:21 2015 UTC,"True, but they never had 2 Nexus phones out at the same time, so I don't see them going for the same SoC on both phones. If it's still/also a dev phone, going with the same SoC seems a bit pointless. Also the SD 618 looks really impressive on paper. The gap between the 600 and 800 series this year could be smaller than usually."
Android,3difwa,0kpkp0,2,Thu Jul 16 16:03:02 2015 UTC,"It could be. But in the end I think for a dev phone they will go with the highest specs.  Screen size is not a matter of higher or lower specs, but rather preference. In other words, we will definitely see 5.2"" flagships carrying the SD820, so I'd be surprised if they assumed that 1080p phones are mostly a second-tier class. I think the market is more like Apple portrays it right now - iPhone 6 is 4.7"", while iPhone 6+ is 5.5""... both carrying the same chipset.  As said it could be... but it would be the first time we see this kind of split.  Now, if they made a third 4.5"" Nexus... :)"
Android,3difwa,VMX,2,Thu Jul 16 18:16:24 2015 UTC,The 820 won't be available to co-launch with Android M though so I would expect an 810 but with the issues I wouldn't be surprised to see an 808.
Android,3difwa,Uskglass_,4,Thu Jul 16 16:16:58 2015 UTC,"It's not clear yet what is the 820 launch time frame, but the 600 series refresh should come out soon and before the 800."

Android,3dh4bq,IHaveDrainBamage,130,Thu Jul 16 05:51:22 2015 UTC,Every time it updates I hope that it's not going to be a battery whore any more. But I know it still will be. I always know.
Android,3dh4bq,Randomd0g,42,Thu Jul 16 07:40:46 2015 UTC,"This isn't a bug, it's by design. It's usually the location services, and these are a massive battery hog due to the way they're programmed to function. Which is a shame, the functionality is good in some apps but the battery life nosedives incredibly hard, especially around bad reception."
Android,3dh4bq,Carighan,39,Thu Jul 16 08:28:34 2015 UTC,"I'm just not sure where someone figured that 60 second updates for location make sense from a practical standpoint. Given a good number of individuals are at work 8 hours a day, does it make sense to ping Google servers 480 times for 480 wakelocks that can each last at least a few seconds?  The big red herring is disabling GPS. That's not even your main drain here. It's the wakeups for network activity, and its far worse when you're on mobile data instead of WiFi."
Android,3dh4bq,dlerium,31,Thu Jul 16 08:57:00 2015 UTC,"It's also baffling that this isn't self-throttling. Something like the accelerometer could tell them whether the phone is even moving (much), and they could just not do updates at all while it's lying on the desk - or still in the same WiFi assuming they know where the WiFi is.  Then having it run 60s intervals only if you're moving quickly, like in a car. And if locale changed very little the last 3-4 updates, start throttling."
Android,3dh4bq,Carighan,14,Thu Jul 16 09:22:38 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is, it you're in un accelerated motion (car or train at constant speed) there is nothing for accelerometers to measure"

Android,3dh4bq,CedarMadness,3,Thu Jul 16 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"There was a talk at I/O this past year about just this. They have a lot of really interesting ways of detecting what you're doing. It's not one particular sensor doing the work, it's gather data from the all the majors ones (GPS, gyro, accel, etc). Nothing is 100% though. So if I remember correctly, if the device thinks you're biking it's because of the up/down motion asserted. They use a combination of the gyro and barometer if available to get to this conclusion. But the ""fused"" location services, is how they handle all this logic. Just because it wasn't purely detected via GPS, doesn't mean it's not the location services doing the work."

As well as a few annoying scratches on the glass  The phone has lasted me extremely well over the last 3 years and will probably be run into the ground before I pick something else up, I do like to have something planned. If money allows whatever the newest Nexus is will do, If money is tighter then a Moto G 3rd Gen will be a fine replacement without much if any loss over my current phone and its functionality."

This would be reflected in the retail price, which will definitely be inflated compared to the US.    I do believe there is an element of assfuckery coming from a general lack of competition (there are basically 3 major parent companies that control the marketshare for department stores, supermarkets, and hardware stores.)

Android,3ddl4g,crosph,26,Wed Jul 15 17:37:54 2015 UTC,"That's crazy.. in the US, SMS/MMS is still flourishing.  And it's almost always free and unlimited (or at least in the 100s or 1000s) to send and receive them. I haven't heard of anyone paying per text in probably a decade.  Must be a regional/generation thing.  I don't know of a single friend who DOESNT send MMS/SMS.  But I know Whatapp is a lot more popular in younger generations.  All of my friends (late 20s/early 30s) and everyone I work with all use SMS."
Android,3ddl4g,SocksForBreakfast,14,Wed Jul 15 17:56:22 2015 UTC,"Me and my friends are mid/late 20s and we all prefer messaging services instead of SMS/MMS (this is in the US). For one thing, MMS is slower than sending photos and group messaging than data and unless you save them somehow, your conversations are gone if you change phones. Messaging services like Hangouts make it easy to save all your conversations, links, and photos sent. It's probably the only reason I use Hangouts to talk to my best friend: everything we've talked about daily for the past few years is stored in the cloud and we can search through it if we are want to."
Android,3ddl4g,DornishMasterPlan,2,Wed Jul 15 20:01:28 2015 UTC,"In the past, when unlimited messaging plans and smart phones weren't commonplace, one of my friends and I used Windows Mobile phones and had unlimited data and messaging, and our other friend didn't have any of that going on. One day, we decided to spam him with texts, and because we could copy and paste and send large amounts of text rapidly, we hit him hard. He never said how much he had to pay as I think he was on a pay as you go for sending and receiving messages, but he surprisingly took it quite well. He also switched right away to unlimited messaging."
Android,3ddl4g,esoomenona,3,Wed Jul 15 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with MMS? You don't need to be connected to the internet to use it. And, no, not everyone has reliable internet service"
Android,3ddl4g,viperex,11,Wed Jul 15 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yup, MightyText found that out too. It was broken for months after the last Android release. You guys are still working on it though, right?"
Android,3ddl4g,Advacar,31,Wed Jul 15 14:15:29 2015 UTC,We have looked into it. But I can't promise anything.
Android,3ddl4g,treeform,7,Wed Jul 15 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"There is already some level of integration between Pushbullet and the SMS client EvolveSMS, and if you look in the secret settings of Evolve, there is an option to try a completely untested and very beta MMS-over-WiFi. Maybe that could be of some help? I have no idea if that has any relevance to the issues you are encountering, but I thought it was worth mentioning at least."
Android,3ddl4g,ranavalona,7,Wed Jul 15 15:07:50 2015 UTC,I think that would only work if your carrier supported it
Android,3ddl4g,dragonice81,6,Wed Jul 15 16:00:27 2015 UTC,Hey - any word on Mac support for Pushbullet SMS conversation view?
Android,3ddl4g,nolongerlowres,17,Wed Jul 15 14:57:17 2015 UTC,Sorry not done yet.
Android,3ddl4g,treeform,6,Wed Jul 15 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"No problem, I'll just try it out in Chrome in the meantime. Thanks for a great app!"
Android,3ddl4g,nolongerlowres,3,Wed Jul 15 15:10:42 2015 UTC,"So, I just got setup with the updates (the windows app w/ chat heads is frickin' awesome BTW!), but looking at texts I've received recently that contain a picture I only see an empty text bubble for that message on both the chrome extension and the windows app.    So viewing doesn't necessarily work either?  Edit: If it matters, I use Chomp on my phone instead of the default."
Android,3ddl4g,Kidd_Funkadelic,2,Wed Jul 15 15:58:42 2015 UTC,Viewing images should work. Any one else has this problem? But there is still SMS/Phone combination we need to debug and test.
Android,3ddl4g,treeform,2,Wed Jul 15 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"On closer inspection, it was only the first photo I was looking at that is missing. Other pics appear to be working.  I can't tell what makes that pic any different from others but I'd say don't worry about it :-)"
Android,3ddl4g,Kidd_Funkadelic,2,Wed Jul 15 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"Please let me access the SMS conversations from my other Android devices too, not just PC. I have a tablet I'd like to be able to communicate by text on."
Android,3ddl4g,Natanael_L,48,Wed Jul 15 19:14:56 2015 UTC,Your flair indicates that you're from the states so is MMS free over there? Here (in NZ) we have to pay some bullshit fee (50c) per MMS message.
Android,3ddl4g,NIGHTFIRE777,52,Wed Jul 15 13:15:16 2015 UTC,It depends on your carrier but usually it just goes along with whatever regular SMS plan you have (we have unlimited SMS very cheap here).
Android,3ddl4g,open1your1eyes0,26,Wed Jul 15 13:17:08 2015 UTC,"I see, we have unlimited SMS for all most every single plan but MMS is regarded as some sort of special thing. Real PITA to be honest."
Android,3ddl4g,NIGHTFIRE777,29,Wed Jul 15 13:18:15 2015 UTC,"it was like that 10 years ago when MMS was new, packages was usually something like 1000sms and 50 mms per month or along those lines.  It's been included in sms for me for quite a long time though, I can't even recall when it switched"
Android,3ddl4g,danvasquez29,9,Wed Jul 15 14:05:25 2015 UTC,"They switched right about the time people started using apps to get free calls/texts. They realized that charging for texts and calls was pointless when you have unlimited data so unlimited data disappeared and they switched to free everything else then just charged you for data and pegged on a fee for the ""privilege"" of owning a smart phone."
Android,3ddl4g,s2514,3,Wed Jul 15 17:19:41 2015 UTC,Yeah it was hilarious paying $15 for unlimited data and $10 for 1000 messages once upon a time. Made no sense.
Android,3ddl4g,petard,3,Thu Jul 16 00:16:39 2015 UTC,In New Zealand? Which carrier are you with?
Android,3ddl4g,NIGHTFIRE777,14,Wed Jul 15 14:06:14 2015 UTC,"sorry, I was talking about what happened in the US."
Android,3ddl4g,danvasquez29,2,Wed Jul 15 14:19:48 2015 UTC,consider yourself lucky MMS is a heaping pile of shit
Android,3ddl4g,Tweek-,6,Wed Jul 15 15:56:07 2015 UTC,"Damn, Here in Australia you have to pay on pretty much every plan.  For example I get $700 of calls and unlimited SMS but MMS is 50c per message. Received receipts are something like 15c per message too which starts to add up quite quickly."
Android,3ddl4g,Totallynotatheif,2,Wed Jul 15 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's terrible."
Android,3ddl4g,Hurrah_for_Karamazov,8,Wed Jul 15 17:25:06 2015 UTC,Just curious. But could you tell me why MMS is still used when almost everyone actually has a data plan and these pictures/attachments can be easily sent over apps like Whatsapp or Telegram? It seems rather odd.
Android,3ddl4g,zweilousbot,7,Wed Jul 15 13:28:08 2015 UTC,"Or snapchat, or bbm, or hangouts, or viber, or slack, or whatever Microsoft is pushing these days.   Which one do you use? Never mind, just text it to me."
Android,3ddl4g,lazylion_ca,3,Wed Jul 15 15:21:34 2015 UTC,"Usually cause of the convenience/compression too. Honestly people are just stuck in their ways and prefer SMS (I used SMS because everyone else I talk to only does, I'd prefer a messaging client) They're mega compressed as MMS, less compressed on a client so it would use more data. Most people wouldn't care/know about that though honestly"
Android,3ddl4g,Rangizingo,5,Wed Jul 15 13:47:23 2015 UTC,"Stuck in their ways seems to be the probable cause. To be frank, i have never sent an MMS in my 7 years of using smartphones, initially due to cost and later due to the utility and ease of sending over the internet."
Android,3ddl4g,zweilousbot,3,Wed Jul 15 13:52:14 2015 UTC,"Or email? MMS is a piece of shit. Seriously, badly designed top-to-bottom, just use email."
Android,3ddl4g,keiyakins,12,Wed Jul 15 14:34:35 2015 UTC,Nobody uses whatsapp or telegram so sending a picture to their phone number is easier then telling them to download an app add them then sending it. Also there's data caps on almost all carriers mms doesn't count toward this.

Android,3ddl4g,soapinmouth,3,Wed Jul 15 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"My boss here in the UK actually still uses MMS, which I find really weird. Mostly I send pictures on WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. MMS pictures appear to be of comically low resolution that there's barely any point. I think they're generally seen as something you use when you have a dumb-phone as opposed to a smart phone.  Maybe in the US they're higher resolution or something?"
Android,3ddl4g,HawkUK,3,Wed Jul 15 14:37:15 2015 UTC,"Not really, the quality is pretty garbage, you just email or generally if quality is important and they don't have hangouts wtc"

Android,3ddl4g,soundwaaves,68,Wed Jul 15 13:21:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. When I first got pushbullet, it was pretty cool, and useful. But NOW? HOLY CRAP?! These guys are awesome. I cant wait to see what they have in store for us next, and I would love to provide more support to this team."
Android,3ddl4g,angermngment,44,Wed Jul 15 15:02:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I got pushbullet you could just push, no SMS, Channels, Windows App. I don't think it even had notification mirroring."

Android,3ddl4g,jakeryan91,185,Wed Jul 15 13:58:54 2015 UTC,The security issues surrounding this app are astounding.  One example regarding two-factor authentication: this app renders sending verification codes to your phone useless. A thief doesn't need your phone to log into your bank account if he gets the SMS alert on your stolen laptop via Push Bullet.
Android,3ddl4g,geekamongus,59,Wed Jul 15 14:04:15 2015 UTC,aw shit I never thought of that.
Android,3ddl4g,touche112,29,Wed Jul 15 16:04:23 2015 UTC,In general two factor auth via SMS is bad even without using pushbullet. Something like a yubikey is much more secure: https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/
Android,3ddl4g,nano351,30,Wed Jul 15 16:44:27 2015 UTC,So disable pushbullet on your phone if you get your shit stolen.
Android,3ddl4g,mirfaltnixein,29,Wed Jul 15 16:51:24 2015 UTC,"Assuming you have enough time to realize your laptop is stolen, sure.  Assuming your laptop was hacked and is still in your possession, no."
Android,3ddl4g,geekamongus,7,Wed Jul 15 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"You can disable specific things from showing up on your PC. If you carry your notebook a lot in areas where it might get stolen it might be smart to set text messages to not be sent to your notebook.  And for your second point just don't download ""PC SPEEDUP 2019 ULTRA EDITION"".  It's really not Pushbullet's fault if the user fucks up by not taking any precautions."
Android,3ddl4g,mirfaltnixein,25,Wed Jul 15 17:59:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure the point was to blame pushbullet, I think the point was to highlight how this app undermines two factor authentication if your account gets compromised. It doesn't matter if it is pushbullet's fault or not in that situation, it's just the reality that it does indeed undermine the additional security."
Android,3ddl4g,i_lack_imagination,17,Wed Jul 15 18:05:23 2015 UTC,"If you're that concerned about security you've already encrypted your laptop and have no need to worry about this to begin with.   Most people these days are logged into their Chrome browser, have their passwords all auto-filled, and 90% of their accounts set to remember their session, giving any thief pretty much every tool they need to get everything they want. Pushbullet is the least of the average consumers worries if their laptop is stolen."
Android,3ddl4g,halethrain,3,Wed Jul 15 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"One more thing to worry about, eh?"
Android,3ddl4g,civy76,6,Wed Jul 15 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"Useless might be a bit strong. The thief still requires the physical access in your example. But yes, it is a concern."
Android,3ddl4g,TableLampOttoman,11,Wed Jul 15 16:17:34 2015 UTC,No physical access is needed if your computer has been compromised.
Android,3ddl4g,geekamongus,5,Wed Jul 15 16:25:01 2015 UTC,Good point.
Android,3ddl4g,TableLampOttoman,3,Wed Jul 15 16:32:55 2015 UTC,Tbh you could simply transition all your two factor alerts to go through authy instead. That way its unlikely to be as much as a security risk..
Android,3ddl4g,potatofaceking,6,Wed Jul 15 17:34:51 2015 UTC,Almost every dual factor auth system has options other than SMS.
Android,3ddl4g,tintin47,5,Wed Jul 15 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"This is simply not true. Google, Dropbox, Facebook... everyone of these systems prefers SMS."
Android,3ddl4g,civy76,5,Wed Jul 15 19:00:25 2015 UTC,"Google, Dropbox, and Facebook all allow app based two factor authentication. Try Authenticator+ or Authy."
Android,3ddl4g,Jammintk,2,Wed Jul 15 19:18:11 2015 UTC,"True but encryption doesn't solve that problem. Two-factor authentication needs some rethinking imo. For one, most phones display the part of the text message containing the access code, without even requiring anyone to unlock it."
Android,3ddl4g,klinetic12,31,Wed Jul 15 17:07:07 2015 UTC,Seriously. Now we get entire text message threads in the clear. Woohoo!  I might finally uninstall PushBullet after this announcement. Encryption needs to come first before you start sending more and more of my data over the internet.

The interface is more polished, it has better functionality, and the 'IM' functionality basically relies on the same parameters- you have to get the friend to install the app on their computer and phone.

Android,3ddl4g,s2514,30,Wed Jul 15 17:22:05 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they have an angel investor that is dumping cash into them until there is a billion dollar buyout.  This app is waaaaay too solid and polished to be the result of volunteer labour.
Android,3ddl4g,merelyadoptedthedark,19,Wed Jul 15 17:27:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah after posting that I looked around and it seems this is the dream. Google should buy them out, they need something to rival iClоud."

Android,3ddl4g,angermngment,6,Wed Jul 15 15:04:10 2015 UTC,will you guys be able to add functionality where i can send SMS from my tablet?    edit - also i noticed after the last update to the chrome extension when i get a notification of a youtube channel update when i click the popup it just takes me to youtube.com and not the actual video.  let me know if i should hit you guys up from the app feedback for this stuff.
Android,3ddl4g,dullknives,5,Wed Jul 15 14:25:48 2015 UTC,But what about end2end encryption? Or the fact that SMS 2FA codes also get synced?
Android,3ddl4g,Avamander,2,Wed Jul 15 18:52:05 2015 UTC,"Will you guys be adding Emoji support?  As of now they don't show at all and you can miss some context if people are showing an emotion using them.  Still an amazing update, even without it!"
Android,3ddl4g,FLHCv2,2,Wed Jul 15 15:02:53 2015 UTC,"I love it! You guys are awesome. I am telling all of my friends about Pushbullet, and hoping that you guys get all the attention you deserve."
Android,3ddl4g,angermngment,2,Wed Jul 15 15:03:29 2015 UTC,"So, when is end to end encryption happening?"
Android,3ddl4g,the_enginerd,82,Wed Jul 15 18:17:37 2015 UTC,I would still like to see them implement end to end encryption.
Android,3ddl4g,AngrehToast,8,Wed Jul 15 14:19:08 2015 UTC,Hopefully their AMA later this week will address these things. I'm guessing they were busy implementing this SMS threading feature before getting started with E2E encryption.
Android,3ddl4g,LearnsSomethingNew,16,Wed Jul 15 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"Seriously, sending everything on my phone through a ""free"" service with no revenue stream is just asking for disaster.  As much as I would love the ease it seems to provide, the security risks are too great.  Pushbullet is an NSA dream."
Android,3ddl4g,ThePa1eBlueDot,31,Wed Jul 15 20:08:57 2015 UTC,Blog Post: https://blog.pushbullet.com/2015/07/15/sms-converstations-on-your-computer/
Android,3ddl4g,skipv5,26,Wed Jul 15 13:08:28 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, they keep on making this app better and better. How do I give these developers some money?"
Android,3ddl4g,bravoavocado,31,Wed Jul 15 13:15:21 2015 UTC,Become a venture capitalist and get in line. These guys are pretty well funded at the moment.
Android,3ddl4g,wewd,31,Wed Jul 15 14:15:33 2015 UTC,These guys fuck.
Android,3ddl4g,Drsela,8,Wed Jul 15 17:58:31 2015 UTC,"We still need one feature: the ability to resend failed texts.  MMS isn't a biggie for me personally, mostly because it doesn't work that great with my carrier."
Android,3ddl4g,ThePegasi,11,Wed Jul 15 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"Is anyone else unable to use this function? I had SMS working on the old version, but the tab in the Chrome extension simply disappeared when I installed this update. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled on both ends, nothing. This update looks great, but right now all it's done is made me worse off than before.  EDIT: Fixed. Upon uninstalling and reinstalling the Android client for a second time, it prompted me to allow notification access again, and this fixed it."
Android,3ddl4g,treeform,5,Wed Jul 15 13:54:20 2015 UTC,"Thats odd, but I am glad you got it working."
Android,3ddl4g,ThePegasi,4,Wed Jul 15 14:07:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, it was indeed a little odd, but I can't find anyone else who's had this issue (even my brother on the same phone, Moto X 2014) so probably just a bit of bad luck insofar as it not displaying the notification access request. Maybe I even tapped home or something when it came up without noticing, no idea.  Loving the update, by the way! Thanks for all your work, such a great product."
Android,3ddl4g,EMW16,3,Wed Jul 15 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"I'm having the same issue (same phone), but uninstalling and reinstalling hasn't fixed it."
Android,3ddl4g,ThePegasi,5,Wed Jul 15 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"Try manually navigating to the Notification Access screen in Settings -> Sound& Notification -> Notification Access and enabling there, if possible.  When you uninstalled and reinstalled, did you open Pushbullet again and see if it prompts you to sign in again. This is the stage where it should prompt you for notification access."
Android,3ddl4g,EMW16,3,Wed Jul 15 14:25:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! I do have notification access enabled, it prompted me, however they're still not showing up. My SMS tab is also completely gone on my chrome extension.  Edit: Was able to fix by uninstalling both the app on my phone and my chrome extension. Reinstalled the android app first, and gave the appropriate notification access.  Then reinstalled the chrome extension.  Everything seems to be working as it should now!  Just a fantastic app guys, thanks so much for all of your hard work!"
Android,3ddl4g,ThePegasi,3,Wed Jul 15 14:34:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's weird. Maybe try going in to Settings -> Apps and clearing data for Pushbullet, then opening it again to see if it prompts you this time?"
Android,3ddl4g,Stouts,2,Wed Jul 15 14:48:01 2015 UTC,"Exact same issue here, had to reinstall twice as well. Which is... odd? It prompted me for notification access both times, but the difference might have been that i (re) turned on its accessibility access the second time?"
Android,3ddl4g,ThePegasi,3,Wed Jul 15 15:25:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I didn't have to do that. Though I did restart my phone between the first and second reinstallations."
Android,3ddl4g,Kidd_Funkadelic,2,Wed Jul 15 15:27:12 2015 UTC,"I had the same issue, fixed by clearing data for PB in the android app."
Android,3ddl4g,misteraugust,50,Wed Jul 15 16:07:21 2015 UTC,And still no end to end encryption.
Android,3ddl4g,SparingCreature,5,Wed Jul 15 14:41:47 2015 UTC,Goodbye Motorola Connect!
Android,3ddl4g,ThePegasi,2,Wed Jul 15 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, just uninstalled it from Chrome! Having more and more contained within this one extension is nice."
Android,3ddl4g,fancygriddles,2,Wed Jul 15 15:42:00 2015 UTC,And good riddance. Only ever worked half the time.
Android,3ddl4g,Weed_O_Whirler,10,Wed Jul 15 18:55:19 2015 UTC,"OK, this is really cool, but two questions:   Is this pretty dang slow for anyone else? Maybe it is just new and still updating, but on my computer clicking on a person leads to about a 5 second delay until the conversation pops up (or it could be my super slow hotel internet I'm on) Did we lose the ability to search for people to send a text to? Or am I missing something? It seems like I can only text from one of my previous conversations"
Android,3ddl4g,guzba,17,Wed Jul 15 13:35:29 2015 UTC,"1) Right now the full turn-around time on a confirmed delivery is about 5 seconds. We will be able to  make this faster in going forward.  2) We need to improve this, but if you scroll to the bottom of your threads, you can click ""Send new message""."
Android,3ddl4g,moyako,16,Wed Jul 15 13:47:18 2015 UTC,Is possible to release a 'lite' version of Pushbullet? Honestly I only use it to share links between my devices and it's getting too inflated for me. It's slower and I have to do more steps just to do the same.
Android,3ddl4g,MisterJimson,7,Wed Jul 15 14:13:29 2015 UTC,Right click > send to   On any chrome page. How is that more steps.
Android,3ddl4g,Kidd_Funkadelic,4,Wed Jul 15 16:46:54 2015 UTC,IMO send new message should be somewhere other than at the bottom of a long list of conversation threads. Perhaps next to the device selection above the threads or something.   What makes this worse on the windows app is that I'm not getting a scroll bar for the conversations and can only get down to the off view entries (and the new msg btn) via the mouse scroll wheel.
Android,3ddl4g,Sn8pCr8cklePop,11,Wed Jul 15 16:15:51 2015 UTC,This almost completely kills Motorola Connect. The only missing features are seeing the device's battery and ringing the device. But device manager already does that anyway.
Android,3ddl4g,biggie101,3,Wed Jul 15 15:14:02 2015 UTC,"Man, I had to ditch MC as soon as Pushbullet implemented sms in the first place. What a shitty extension that turned out to be."
Android,3ddl4g,BeaSk8r117,10,Thu Jul 16 01:23:43 2015 UTC,Any idea on when Firefox will get this? I switched to Firefox because I personally like the customizability of Firefox over Chrome.
Android,3ddl4g,terabitzz,3,Wed Jul 15 14:42:12 2015 UTC,You can also install the Windows client which works flawlessly.
Android,3ddl4g,BeaSk8r117,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:57 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm using right now. I would like the convenience of a browser extension, though."
Android,3ddl4g,The0x539,5,Wed Jul 15 18:49:47 2015 UTC,Soon enough. They give a damn about parity.
Android,3ddl4g,guzba,5,Wed Jul 15 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"We do, and it is going to happen. Right now we're still waiting on Mozilla to approve our previous update (looking like it might take them a month, which really sucks). After that's approved though, we'll get this one submitted right away."
Android,3ddl4g,jherazob,8,Wed Jul 15 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"For those of us who haven't used this app yet, care to give us an intro that isn't their sales pitch? Specially since it seems like now it's yet another instant messaging app too?"
Android,3ddl4g,armando_rod,14,Wed Jul 15 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"You can mirror notifications to a pc, sync to other devices too, if you dismiss in the pc or a device it get dismissed in all devices as well.   It has an universal clipboard between pc - device.   You can send links, notes, etc to other devices and/or friends aka push.   You can send SMS from the Chrome extension or Windows app.   Also the windows app is integrated into the right click to send files directly."
Android,3ddl4g,Gliste,3,Wed Jul 15 16:53:07 2015 UTC,How does this compare to AirDroid?
Android,3ddl4g,Kerumen,14,Wed Jul 15 14:34:51 2015 UTC,This. Is. Awesome.
Android,3ddl4g,CryptoEdge,8,Wed Jul 15 13:13:33 2015 UTC,Love Pushbullet. Seriously one of the most useful apps.
Android,3ddl4g,Joemasta66,3,Wed Jul 15 13:14:14 2015 UTC,Does this work if you have a windows computer and an iPhone?
Android,3ddl4g,nirvanes26,3,Wed Jul 15 14:52:23 2015 UTC,Or a Mac and an Android... which is my case. It isn't working.
Android,3ddl4g,armando_rod,8,Wed Jul 15 15:26:53 2015 UTC,Use Chrome
Android,3ddl4g,nirvanes26,3,Wed Jul 15 15:35:47 2015 UTC,You are right :/ just asking for an app update.
Android,3ddl4g,mrimite,2,Wed Jul 15 16:08:19 2015 UTC,It's working for me. Mac & 1+1
Android,3ddl4g,armando_rod,2,Wed Jul 15 15:40:24 2015 UTC,"No, Android only"
Android,3ddl4g,Kagron,3,Wed Jul 15 15:36:01 2015 UTC,So is this better than Airdroid?
Android,3ddl4g,ziggurqt,5,Wed Jul 15 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"For texting? Definitely. Actually, I don't use Airdroid anymore, as I don't find any use of it."
Android,3ddl4g,Kagron,2,Wed Jul 15 16:01:00 2015 UTC,"Well I mostly used Airdroid for the texting and easy file transfer. I'll have to try this out though, thanks!"
Android,3ddl4g,ziggurqt,2,Wed Jul 15 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"Do as you see fit. For file transfer, I personally use Solid Explorer (with the FTP Server feature) and Filezilla. Once it's setup, it's much quicker and easier to transfer files than Airdroid, and you don't have to keep the whole software just for that feature. Check it out if you can!"
Android,3ddl4g,dlerium,3,Wed Jul 15 16:09:00 2015 UTC,"Can I understand how this works? If I have 500 conversations, does it have to sync in advance? Or is the SMS conversation is only loaded upon a notification showing up?"
Android,3ddl4g,zenithyoda,3,Wed Jul 15 17:27:00 2015 UTC,Can someone explain to me why I should switch from MightyText to PushBullet?
Android,3ddl4g,imrunningfromthecops,3,Wed Jul 15 19:25:23 2015 UTC,Can somebody explain to me what Pushbullet is exactly? And what this specific situation is as well?
Android,3ddl4g,jamesking420,3,Wed Jul 15 19:56:35 2015 UTC,Any chance you could add hangouts messages as integrated conversations?
Android,3ddl4g,moeburn,7,Wed Jul 15 21:44:36 2015 UTC,MightyText user since MightyText was born here.  Never used anything else.  Someone want to sell me this?  Why is this better than MightyText?
Android,3ddl4g,Kidd_Funkadelic,2,Wed Jul 15 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"There is a native windows app that you can install that works awesome (looks like the MT tablet app / browser page), but allows you to pop out a user to a chat head that can be collapsed, and shows an unread count when you get a text. When the chat head is out for a user (expanded or not) you unread number replaces the popup notification. The whole experience feels superior. And I'm with you, until this morning I've only ever used MT.  Also, MT is creating copies of the texts, so if you want to delete a txt you have to do it twice.  PB is merely relaying the texts from the phone, so deleting it off the phone instantly removes it from the windows app...  That said, I have to keep MT around for tablet integration for the moment (Asus tablet w/ keydock used as a mini laptop). And for me MMS messages aren't showing the picture in PB even though it supposedly is supported in a read only manner."
Android,3ddl4g,jpGrind,2,Wed Jul 15 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"Same here. I've been an avid Mighty Text user since it launched. It's always worked quite well, and I've never had any major complaints. I'm all for alternatives, and choice, and all that. But I don't fully understand what about Mighty Text it is that makes people want to switch. Especially since Pushbullet isn't capable of MMS yet.  Is it just the slight benefit of having one less app installed? Do people just simply not know Mighty Text exists?  I'm not channeling my inner fanboy and blindly defending Mighty Text or anything like that. I plan on testing out the Pushbullet PC <-> SMS integration, just to see if the experience is better."
Android,3ddl4g,t0k3n98,5,Wed Jul 15 17:55:26 2015 UTC,Please someone show me their donation page or something these guys are amazing.
Android,3ddl4g,NIGHTFIRE777,4,Wed Jul 15 13:17:49 2015 UTC,"Here is the AP post about the update, that gives a neat overview of the changes. For some reason the mods just kept the post that linked to the Play Store (because it was first)"
Android,3ddl4g,hanssone,2,Wed Jul 15 13:23:00 2015 UTC,Biggest news since in a long time. They are definitely pushing it hard. Oh yeah
Android,3ddl4g,puckbeaverton,2,Wed Jul 15 13:41:59 2015 UTC,Oh shit.  Tootles mighty. Been a good ride.
Android,3ddl4g,gadget_uk,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:21 2015 UTC,"This is great.   Now, what are the chances of enabling this somehow for my iPad - either through IOS Chrome or in the App? Is the problem with Apple's restrictions on Apps that mimic built-in functionality - which includes SMS?  Oh, one other thing. Any chance of something like a quick disable/enable slider in Chrome - or perhaps a ""snooze"" setting so I don't get notifications when I'm, for example, sharing a screen while doing a presentation?"
Android,3ddl4g,tintin47,2,Wed Jul 15 15:14:57 2015 UTC,"Is it not working for anyone else?  I can respond to texts, but incoming texts don't show in thread form in pushbullet, and texts I send through pushbullet are not displayed on my phone, even though the targets received the messages."
Android,3ddl4g,SupaZT,2,Wed Jul 15 16:58:52 2015 UTC,But no Google voice and sending of mms
Android,3ddl4g,topgun966,2,Wed Jul 15 17:00:39 2015 UTC,How is the battery drain? Biggest complaint with mightytext is that.
Android,3ddl4g,edgesrazor,2,Wed Jul 15 17:33:40 2015 UTC,"I wish I could share the same enthusiasm as everyone else, but it seems that every time they release an update it becomes more unreliable. I updated the extension earlier this week and the app today and now I can no longer send texts from my PC. This is such a bummer as I absolutely love this app.  EDIT: Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it's working again."
