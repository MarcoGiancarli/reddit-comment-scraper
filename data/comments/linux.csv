linux,3e395n,paroneayea,16,Tue Jul 21 16:54:25 2015 UTC,"Summary of everything about this:   Hardcore BSD folks who want to end GPL and end copyrights and patents and proprietary software are consistent. Fine. ""GPL blocks my freedom to be proprietary"" is hypocritical nonsense. Being proprietary isn't a freedom, it's a power (proprietary terms aren't what you do for yourself, it's how you control others) concerns about GPL and license compatibility problems within free software are legitimate GPL is not about ""giving back"" upstream; it's only a downstream license about passing on the freedoms to others Proprietary software doesn't have to be evil, and the majority of free software advocates and GPL-defenders wouldn't care about these issues if proprietary software didn't have anti-features and do malicious things. I.e. if those with power via proprietary software terms never abused that power, far fewer people would object. But they do regularly abuse that power. Some don't, but enough do that we can't generally trust proprietary software to not abuse us. The argument that permissive (""pushover"") licenses may do better because of more participation is a tactical detail that may sometimes may sense (but could sometimes be flat out wrong, GPL may get more in some cases), but the issues are unclear, speculative, and complex. Even when true, this argument doesn't make GPL necessarily wrong or bad."

We used to (still do for 13.1) ship a bunch of -basedonopensuse branding packages which offered a sanitised, but still 'openSUSE-esque' theme, but they were technically a pain and we figured most of the time if people didn't want something openSUSE-ified, they'd prefer to use their own packages or upstream, so I don't think we'll be doing them any more  But yeah, pretty different from how I see Canonical dealing with the same issue."

That leaves you with Everything Is Utterly Broken. Before you do that, though, you might try ALT-SYSRQ-F (Free memory) to call the oom_killer and terminate the most ram intensive process, this is very rarely good enough but definitely useful when your system is thrashing the disk because it's gone deep into the swap space. A lot of times when your computer is heavily swapping, you're just waiting for the terminal to pop up so you can use top/htop to find the memory hog and kill it. ALT-SYSRQ-F can do that for you."

Does that make me terrible person? Based on my personality I'd say borderline arrogant person with strong beliefs. ""I do it my way"" is absolutely normal when you're smart enough to see where things go wrong and refuse to be the part of the sheep nation.   But, if I ever avoided something is telling people THEY should do it as I do. You can tell them what they are doing wrong, but understanding and fixing is their problem. Life would just be too complicated with too much hustle otherwise  There is only one case where your statement probably partially hits the nail. Part of my job is checking quality of code and approaches taken to solve the problems. In short, ensure long term quality and predict possible problems we'll face. At that time I'm required to propose solution and demand problem resolve (which is either my way or something new I can't see problem with).

However, back then I had a cheap computer during the dial-up era and something called a 'winmodem' which would not work in Linux. Having no connection to the internet, I set linux aside until 2005 when a friend said I could download debian or ubuntu for free. Since then I have had it in different capacities, either multiboot, virtual machine or dedicated devices.  It is really a toy for me. I installed Gentoo on an old computer just to go through and learn how that distro worked. It was pretty fun but I missed my ""apt-get install.""  I use cygwin-64 on Windows computers to get my command line. Most recently, I've gotten into the Raspberry Pi and have three of those now."

Please read this : http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html  I'll quote :    Suppose you develop and release a free program under the ordinary GNU GPL. If developer D modifies the program and releases it, the GPL requires him to distribute his version under the GPL too. Thus, if you get a copy of his version, you are free to incorporate some or all of his changes into your own version.  But suppose the program is mainly useful on servers. When D modifies the program, he might very likely run it on his own server and never release copies. Then you would never get a copy of the source code of his version, so you would never have the chance to include his changes in your version. You may not like that outcome."

In the future, if you're interested in comprehensive password management,  Let me suggest  KeePass 2.x   (www.keepass.info), a FOSS password manager with a ton of features and available plug-ins.

Thanks for the reminder, I had been meaning to do so!) it shows that I have 1 free alias available to me on my user account. Does this mean I've locked in on the free alias promotion?   Or do I actually need to choose/activate the alias ASAP or risk losing it?   Since I am undecided on what I wish my alias to be,  I've not set it as of yet. I'd greatly appreciate if simply having an account created while the free alias was granted will mean we can actually enable/choose it later, especially as we cannot change it once chosen!   Overall this looks like a great service and I'm very glad to see the commitment to  privacy and open source at every level!   I would request however, would it be possible to create a plug-in of sorts for FOSS mail clients and OpenPGP key export for advanced users?    For years I've preferred to use Thunderbird (via IMAP) or other FOSS mail clients, alongside OpenPGP/GnuPG.  I know this is a bit cumbersome and that the way Tutanota is currently setup it won't work with IMAP.  I was wondering if it would be possible for Tutanota to create a (ideally, FOSS) plugin/extension or somesuch to work with many of the major FOSS clients, and/or allow manual exporting of OpenPGP keys?

A few years ago I wouldn't have said that but several things improved at around the same time:   Hardware support improved drastically (to the point where it's rare to find something unsupported. And dealing with hardware in Linux is generally a breeze compared to Windows (no installing drivers!) Modern desktops emerged. The Win95-a-like start menu/taskbar/systray is fine for some people but doesn't really provide an incentive to move to Linux, just to put up with it. The arrival of desktops that look modern and work in a modern way - Gnome Shell, Unity, Plasma 5 and Pantheon - helps give the Linux desktop its own identity. The web became far more important. More of what most people do happens on the web and 'web apps' somewhat diminish the importance of desktop software for many people. There are downsides to this, of course, but it certainly makes switching to Linux easier.   The are still difficulties of course. The sheer amount of choice (in terms of things like what distro to use, what desktop to use) can be off-putting. And where it's not, it can cause people to hop around attempting to try everything, without ever feeling settled and getting to know what they're using.  And, of course, for long-time Windows users, it's just a very different system. If the Windows way of doing things is ingrained in you then you really need a bit of patience when approaching Linux.  But yeah, broadly speaking and unless you absolutely must use Photoshop (or whatever) I think we're finally in a position where the advantages (flexibility, speed, freedom, stability, power) outweigh the disadvantages."

If someone were to use Linux exclusively for a very long time and not have any sort of occupation that requires interaction with Windows, I'd think it's entirely reasonable for people to forget the rituals that fix Windows problems, and since it's really kind of a mind-numbing fuckfest, I could easily see their mind eager to kick that information out.

People aren't used to the choices coming from windows or Mac.  Hardware issues? Rare for most hardware, but it does happen with devices that require binary firmware coupled with drivers, and with some high end video cards.  Sometimes a distro kernel might not have had the module for your hardware, and you would need to find the module compiled in another repository. The distros try their best to remain as free and open as possible while covering as much hardware as possible, but they can't cover everything.  On the business side, and even consumer side, its a comfort thing. They aren't used to something different than windows. Its quite a bit different, and takes a new mindset.

Why would the Apache Software Foundation (a foundation dedicated to the stewardship of programs licensed under the Apache License) donate Open Office to a new owner that had not previously owned it (but had heavy ties to its previous development), when the requirements for them getting it in the first place were that they re-license it under the Apache License and incorporate the code donated by IBM?  It seems like donating it to a group that intends to re-license it again under the MPL+LGPLv3+ instead of keeping it under the Apache License (which allows for re-licensing without transferring ownership) would be going directly against the reasons that it was donated to them in the first place.     Now, I understand why LO doesn't like the Apache License (as while it provides more freedom than the MPL, it doesn't enforce your freedom), however that doesn't prevent me from being a bit disappointed in the outcome of LO's decision."

I use it for study (programming and writing stuff using LaTeX), browsing, working (landed a Unix/Linux job because of my tinkering with Linux on older machines to learn), tinkering and recently also gaming. I used to boot to windows 7 just for gaming and have done so for years. But with the coming of Steam on Linux I needed Windows less and less. I still have a disk in my system with Win7 on it for gaming, but I haven't booted in at least 6 months. I used to play Civ5 and Counter-Strike: GO a lot, nowadays it's War Thunder and Settlers II Gold in DOSBox with the occasional CS match. All run great on Linux. I also played XCOM and Left4Dead2, ran great also. So I'm on Linux exclusively for the past half year.  If you want to try it: go for it. Expect to run into trouble and having to relearn a bunch of things. Like Rome: nothing is built in a single day. Moving platform is a step-by-step process for most. And it's hardest for Windows power-users, because they are very set in their ways of clicking.  Protip: learn to embrace the terminal. It's available on every machine and you can do pretty much anything with it. And it's easy too once you get the hang of it, just requires an initial hurdle of getting to grips with it.

I don't really use the features that Linux freedom offers, sure having a custom desktop environment is neat, but Windows and OS X don't have terrible UIs on their own.   Problems have come up more than once and the time spent on it was not worth the freedom of Linux.

I've had multiple issues that required a full reinstall more than once.   I've had issues getting my backups back, and when restoring from backup the program didn't inform me it wouldn't back up anything above my home directory.   Linux is a great idea and a useful tool, but it's not ready to be a primary OS, and until a company the size of Google makes a distribution and supports it the way MS does, it never will be in my opinion. Desktop environments are too unstable, the computer is too easy to break, and third party support is lack luster.   I still have Linux on my computer.

I started using Linux in 2009 with Ubuntu, and have always dual-booted with Windows. No experience on Mac systems whatsoever. So that's where I'm coming from.  Anyway.  I've been quite happy with Linux, and for the most part, the disadvantages have been because of my own inexperience and hesitation to dive in. Linux can be intimidating, for sure, but there's lots of documentation out there, and a lovely community. And you won't completely break your stuff if you dive in too deep... or if you do manage to break it somehow, you can always reinstall. Once you get a taste of Linux, though, I think you'll want to use that more and more often :)  The other (small) complaint I have is that the formatting always seems to get screwed up when I write a document in LibreOffice and try to change it up to Microsoft Office formats. (Necessary, unfortunately, because almost everyone I know uses MO.) But I don't know if that's a Linux problem or a LibreOffice problem, or as I suspect, a Microsoft Office problem. Either way, it's a small grumble.  I personally do keep a small Windows partition on my hard drive because I anticipate working in an office environment that uses Windows, and I want to be very very good with the software. As they'll likely be using W10 and the latest versions of Excel and Access, I keep those on my disk so that I can teach myself the ins and outs of those things.  That said, Linux is already my daily driver, so to speak. The more I learn about Windows 10, the more I'm delighted to have the option to use Linux.  tl;dr: There's no shame in dual-booting if you need to or if you would be more comfortable in having it just-in-case.

linux,3dzlv6,dbbo,4,Mon Jul 20 23:09:12 2015 UTC,"If I am to work on this source (contribute, modify it for my own, or even just read it) I'd be making a local git repo after fetching it with apt-get source. dgit makes that a single step, plus gives me the upstream history.   So, why?   I think it's obvious that if I was working on the code, I'd want to have revision control to track my changes. Every change I make, I'd capture in git (locally).   But even building a package can some times go wrong, and I may want to start clean... So I'd run ""git clean -dxf"" to blow away all the build artifacts.  Finally there is ""git grep"" which I can run on the git database to locate some code I am looking for. It operates much faster than grep, and only searches the files in git... thus ignoring the build artifacts.   Having the history is also useful, most notably if I want to build (inspect) the previous release."

So will distros based on other distros. It is a risk inherent to new distros, not one inherent to independent distros. Independent distros can be very interesting as they can experiment with the internals of the system. For example, NixOS. It has a very interesting package manager which isn't really a viable thing to change if you base the OS on debian or another linux distro.  In this case, I don't really see the advantage of building the whole OS. Most of it seems to revolve around the desktop environment."

linux,3dxeic,ufee1dead,7,Mon Jul 20 14:09:05 2015 UTC,"In short I believe the traditional concept of packaging is somewhat dead, and I look to it as a build tool. Our particular build tools (ypkg, evobuild, etc) make many of the decisions automatically, say, on package splitting, file locations, etc.  Solus is built very differently, and its built from the ground-up to avoid the common pitfalls of other generic distros (like all the conflicting packages, the 3 concurrent package versions.. the two different libjpeg providers.. etc)  Do it right once :]"
linux,3dxeic,speeding_sloth,4,Mon Jul 20 14:26:12 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. So it is also trying it's hand at packaging. Interesting. The build script you links does remind me of Arch PKGBUILDS. Is this also a bash script? Or is it only a fancy way of calling the makefile?  As a second question: This system seems to be more ports like. Is it mean to be a system where people can package their own software easily?  EDIT: Just realised you're the original dev. Thanks for the answers :)"
linux,3dxeic,ufee1dead,9,Mon Jul 20 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"Its sorta like a mangle between RPM and PKGBUILD files, I guess. Its a YAML file so its very simple to work with programmatically, unlike pure bash files. It also lends a very nice syntax, such as with the rundeps multikey system.  It has some handy macros as with RPM, such as %configure, %make, etc, to ensure consistency and simplicity.  Those repos all back a single binary repository, users simply need to ""make publish"" the package they own (all publickey/account based) and our build system will pick it up.  It is actually incredibly simple for users to package software, we want to make the tooling as simple as we can. Still ongoing works in that area :] Quite a few ""ordinary"" users are now actively contributing packaging to Solus, which I think is nice.  https://wiki.solus-project.com/Package.yml"

linux,3dxeic,Ditti,36,Mon Jul 20 12:32:31 2015 UTC,The eOS devs suddenly decided to charge for their downloads and called everyone who got the ISO images without paying a cheater/thief (can't recall the exact term they used).
linux,3dxeic,0x6c6f6c,36,Mon Jul 20 12:52:51 2015 UTC,"They did still publicly bash people for not paying, I read the post from their dev team and there wasn't enough specificity to those direct links being what they were mad about if at all, but rather plenty of connotation to the lack of income on a FOSS project. They literally called users who downloaded it without paying cheaters.  It's a good project but coming out and bashing your consumer base for not ""buying"" a free OS is just wrong. They took a poor approach to the issue and alienated plenty of users in the process.  I appreciate hard work from developers, and I have and will continue to donate to projects I use and appreciate. Had I some more luck with Luna when I installed it, and not been bashed while having just installed Freya to test it out that week, I might've donated to their project. I won't hand money to people who seem to be in it for the wrong reasons, especially those who would talk down to their consumer."
linux,3dxeic,embik,17,Mon Jul 20 13:08:20 2015 UTC,"If you're actually interested in discussing this (if not, just let me know), I'd like to light this whole stuff from a perspective within the elementary contributor team (okay, to be honest it's just my opinion as one single contributor watching this whole stuff):  The whole blog post was, uhm, bad. It tried to explain a stance regarding funding in FOSS and how the people responsible for the download process adjusted the download according to the views they hold. Of course you cannot explain such a - well, let's say controversial - position without coming off as self-centered when you're using it as a justification for a decision you just made.  But what's the actual position? From my perspective (I cannot see into others' heads, so I might be wrong of course) it boils down to ""I like FOSS software and I would like to do this as my real job"". I think that is a desirable wish. Actually, Linux pays for quite some people's lifes - Developers employed by companies to work at core Linux components (Kernel, business applications, etc), people employed at commercial distributors (Red Hat, Canonical, SUSE), developers creating custom solutions for Linux, system houses, etc. Canonical, as example, is making most of its income with commercial support for Ubuntu servers. And that's the crucial point: You can only have a constant influx of money if you're working on the server side of Linux; the desktop is mostly free as in beer (which actually leads to less maintained projects sometimes because developers have to cease free-time development). Now, the obviously controversial opinion is ""desktop developers should be able to be paid by their work"" - That's in no way limited to elementary OS of course.  Now, the blog post said ""people are cheating the system"" - Let's just ignore for a second how truly terrible this is worded, what's the meaning behind it? What's the system if not FOSS? Let's be honest, FOSS only works if the community contributes in some way. Some projects are only running because their users are also developers and therefore sending patches, pushing development, etc. Developers are investing a resource (the time they need to write the code). The focus group for elementary OS are users who just want their system to work - Users coming from Windows or OS X. Most of these cannot contribute code (because they're not developers), but they can help improving elementary OS by spending money, so bounties can be set up, servers and devs can be paid, etc. Now, saying you're ""cheating"" this system by not contributing is wrong. Yes it is, truly. It did not reflect the position explained above at all. But it tried to address the fact FOSS does depend on contribution - In whatever way possible. The way it failed to do so was spectacular.  God, this text is already too long. I'm sorry. It's hard to say ""just believe me"", I know, but nobody at the team is mad because only ~1% are paying - We are very thankful for everyone who donates, and we wish more would do so, but we don't bash ""non-payers"" internally or something like that. The fact you can get a full-blown operating system for free is just pure beauty in itself.  Now, handling PR issues is really hard - You see it yourself: A lot of people are still mad about that one line. A lot of people are also mad at how elementary handled the situation. Truth is: After the initial fallout, the responsible person reworded that line very fast, because they realized it was offending the reader (and rightly so) and failed to address the real intention. People took that even worse, because they were under the impression someone was trying to hide that statement away, although obviously people already knew about it (and even more obviously, the internet does not forget). The team talked aobut how to handle the whole thing (and there were lengthy discussions with people arguing over different positions), and in the end the responsible people settled on ""we fucked up but we'll ride it out"". Because they were under the impression we were facing a shit storm and there would always be people not satisfied, no matter what we would have said. And, don't get me wrong, I was no supporter of this stance, but I understand it - What people said (on here, for example) was really beyond ""mh, that's a shitty thing to say"". And most of these people weren't even elementary OS users.  I really don't have any final conclusion to offer, the only thing I can say is: I absolutely understand your (and many others) position. The intention doesn't matter if it creates a wrong impression around readers and that was the big fuck-up. We didn't want to bash the user base, but yeah ... One final question (because I'm actually wondering), is there any way to convince you of ""we're not jerks""?  Edit: Well I'm not mad about downvotes (as said, I understand the anger), but I'd actually like to get in touch with you all and talk about what's your problem with the post, if you have any."
linux,3dxeic,phre4k,3,Mon Jul 20 13:56:43 2015 UTC,"I speak for myself but I already got what the blog post meant as I read it. In the aftermath the devs didn't even apologize but deleted the controversial statements.  What upset me was that I donated to eOS before and felt downright betrayed by the eOS devs with their attitude. I stopped donating after that.  Begging for donations is acceptable, calling your users cheaters is not. And not apologizing for it is just evil. That's really all there is to it."
linux,3dxeic,embik,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:32 2015 UTC,"Uhh, I'm not sure how to say this without coming off as dick (sorry for that in advance), but what you're saying was exactly what I tried to address in the post you answered to. If we're going down that road, I fear we'll spin around the same points for a long time, because I tried to explain exactly the stuff you mentioned (what the attitude is, why the responsible people reacted the way they did, etc). I'm not sure how to address this in another way. So, basically, because there was no apology, the dev team lost the benefit of the doubt to you and you interpet everything the ""worst"" way possible?   Truth is: After the initial fallout, the responsible person reworded that line very fast, because they realized it was offending the reader (and rightly so) and failed to address the real intention.

They didn't even apologize after being called out for not apologizing. I read your whole post again and the part you quoted, too.   ""we fucked up but we'll ride it out""   That's not how apologizing works. They poured liquid oxygen into the flames.  I might change my mind if the attitude of the devs changes. But until then, I see them as a bunch of arrogant dickheads. I am an arrogant dickhead, too, but to this date I still didn't manage to piss a large potential userbase off.  I'm just sad I have to use eOS because my mom can't really work with another OS. I made a mistake explaining a non-standard DE.    My advice to the eOS devs:   Become more human.

Their first thought is going to be that they are limited to the built-in settings.   Both the default and the so-called gnome2-style are inefficient.  All current desktop environments have menu with applications, folder shortcuts, system buttons, system settings, maybe some favorites.  So that you don't need to put buttons or another menu somewhere else.  They also make good use of the space in the various ways they achieve this.  Budgie has plenty of space but only applications and search.  Also, sometimes you want to keep something installed but not have it in the menu.  For instance, programs like eyeofgnome or mpv do not need to be in a menu, but you do want them to be used when clicking on a file to open it.  There is also the case of installing multiple desktop environments and having overlap issues."
linux,3dxeic,ufee1dead,2,Tue Jul 21 11:28:53 2015 UTC,"I explicitly said ""which is going to be replaced in the future"". I've addressed this point.  Disable the compact menu, it has categorisation. Or use the GNOME2 style menu, which has the other shortcuts you've detailed (This point was previously addressed). You also seem to have the wrong concept of inefficient. Budgie keeps out of your way, that's the idea.   There is also the case of installing multiple desktop environments and having overlap issues.

linux,3dxeic,mostlypissed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going based on what I've seen in budgie in archlinux and what I see in the screenshots, which looks exactly the same as I remember.  If major changes have occurred very recently, I apologize.  The only thing I mean with efficiency is that there are certain ways of setting up the menu where you can get to things you need in a short amount of time.  Some things are relative to the user, which is why some customization is necessary.  And I think it is not always satisfied by minimalism for it's own sake.  If something is too simple, you could spend more time trying to get to something.  Which is as bad a problem as when it is too clunky and overly complicated.  I think gnome 2 was good for it's time, for instance, but now there are much easier menus to use.  (Linux Mint MATE menu is a major improvement over the default MATE menu as one example).  I just used the other DEs thing just as example of how easy it is to clutter up some menu, but what about other unnecessary menu items?  If there are too many unnecessary things, I think it is defeating your own principle of staying out of the way."
linux,3dxeic,ufee1dead,3,Mon Jul 20 16:27:59 2015 UTC,"Mint Mate Menu (formally mintMenu from GNOME2) is horribly inefficient in terms of resource usage - which is where I deem ""efficiency"" :]  I said ""get out of the way"", but I certainly didn't say ""minimalism"".

The project needs to remain ""on task"" and avoid bloat/creep. So you won't find 15 different image viewers, for example..  It's purely a desktop distro, you can see our repos here: https://git.solus-project.com/  And a source package list here: https://git.solus-project.com/common/tree/packages  We also somewhat fly in the face of traditional packaging with our package.yml builds.

Not to mention that fully Free Software alternatives for Android such as Replicant's hardware support is woefully minimal, and because these devices get obsolete faster than PC hardware, and one can't change their parts, supporting them is futile.

Another thing is that people tend to keep their ""real"" computers longer than their phones. Using my wife as an example, she goes through at least 4 phones over the lifespan of 1 laptop.  Yes laptop market is more mature than phone/tablet, so sales will grow more sharply percentage-wise among the latter. But the latter is also less durable and cheaper.

Especially the immediate hashing of the secret message with the already broken SHA-1 represents a single point of failure in the implementation.[52][53][54] The server is able to perform a man in the middle attack, because there is no authentication of the messages. So, it is possible for the server provider to forge messages in the name of the user. Further, the keys are not generated randomly, as it is common throughout cryptography, but are calculated from the plain text message. This is seen as a gross error in the conception of the protocol.[55] All messages are stored unencrypted on the device and can be accessed easily by an attacker with access to the device.[56]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_%28software%29#Security_concerns"

It's getting increasingly incompatible with Firefox extensions, to the point they now have their own (quite small) extension page.  Iceweasel is just Firefox with Debian-made branding, as said above. Icecat is based on the ESR versions, and seems stuck on ESR31 at the moment. Not sure if they'll ever move to ESR38. I wonder if Seamonkey and Conkeror will survive the coming Firefox ""revolution"".  Chrome/Chromium is the new IE6. Opera is now a Chromium skin. As for all those hip ""indie"" browsers that keep popping up, they are just Webkit (or maybe Blink) wrappers, nothing more :("

I use Debian Testing, which is a rolling distro, stable enough for daily use (only had one issue with it with closed source nVidia driver). During net install process you are asked which desktop environment you would like installed and Cinnamon offered among the rest. Network install ensures you have the bare minimum of packages you need so there's as little bloat as possible.  Granted it's not as polished as Ubuntu or Mint. Things like boot splash image is missing and some other small things which I personally don't care about. Also, it's Debian, so you get to keep apt and is well supported with packages. You won't get to a point where you would have to compile something to get it running."

Just don't expect support from the ""official"" debian org once you've messed up your software sources, which IMHO is fine (bugs are expected to be reproducible on plain Debian).

A certification, however, suggests that you care about knowledge over improving your actual skills.  Does that mean no employer cares about them? Not exactly. Some do.

Though my agreement can change based on the resume they are looking at. So I can see both sides of an argument here.   Yes I was using a high school student as an example but I can switch it up by asking this question.   Who are you going to an interview? The 45 year old that has worked at walmart/mcdonalds/construction as his last jobs or the 45 year old with programming/IT based certs that his last jobs were walmart/mcdonalds/construction  Certs are just a way in the door at the end of the day.

linux,3duzai,lamayonaise,49,Mon Jul 20 15:47:35 2015 UTC,"Honest answer here, as an Arch user who has used Linux and Unix for several years.   I don't hate the idea of Linux Mint. User choice is good. Providing an option that is ""user friendly"" (it's not very friendly to me, it's subjective whatever way you slice it), is good. That's what is important to me about Linux is user choice. While I positively adore Arch, I would never recommend it to a beginner, it simply would not suit their needs any better than Linux Mint would suit mine. That's the beauty of it!   The point is, the idea of a simple, easy to use, pretty, performant system, that works reliably out of the box is great. If that means more choices for the users, I'm all for it. My issue with Linux Mint is the execution. Unless things have changed in the last few months, they still repackage Ubuntu's repositories. Ubuntu's repositories are not particularly great, with out of date or insecure software taking months, or even a new release to fix. Of course, re-packaging Ubuntu's repos means that LM's lead time for package releases is going to be even longer than Ubuntu's. This means that users may often not be getting the best, most up to date and secure software packages, and that's a bad thing.  Now, one thing I always hate is people who whine about things without offering a solution, so I will offer several.   If you like the LM ideology and graphical design  Try Linux Mint Debian Edition, it offers a much more solid (in my opinion) foundation, with better packages. The only thing missing is the ""app store"". I would not consider that a great loss, as there is always Synaptic, but that's a personal choice and opinion.   If you like stable, non-rolling releases, and you think Cinnamon is good  Try Debian. The Debian installer is no harder than the Windows installer, although certainly not as pretty as Mint's. Debian also offers Cinnamon as a desktop environment. GNOME, KDE, MATE, xfce, and lxde are available as well, all of which are fine desktop environments worthy of consideration.   If you like cutting edge software and ease of use  Try Manjaro. It ships with KDE or xfce out of the box, comes with a very easy to use installer, and gives you the performance and bleeding-edge packages of Archlinux. I would say it is on par with or close to LM in terms of ease-of-use. Be aware though, as with any rolling release, shiny new software comes at the cost of stability.   As all of the above (except Debian), as well as LM offer liveCDs, I would encourage users to try all of them, then decide if LM really brings anything to the table for them, compared to the above three. If not, I would choose one of the above."
linux,3duzai,urbanabydos,4,Mon Jul 20 03:03:31 2015 UTC,"That was a great reply, thank you.  I've been using LM for quite a while but only because I used Ubuntu and got fed up with the stupid changes they were making.  But yes, out of date repos are frustrating... Maybe time to shop around."

linux,3duzai,Dekula,6,Mon Jul 20 03:26:11 2015 UTC,"The main difference is that Antergos will install everything for you. You get a choice of what software, DE and which repos that you want access to. It then proceeds to download everything and install it.  Antergos is actually pretty solid and it is the closest you can get to Arch without actually installing it. heck, if you run uname -r, it will give you 4.0.7 Arch (for example) as an answer.   Manjaro is based off of Arch but it is to Arch, what Ubuntu is to Debian or LM to Ubuntu. Manjaro does hold back updates, often times. So, you won't necessarily have all of the updates that an Arch user would have.   I've used both, both in a VM and on actual hardware. Manjaro was too buggy and the downloads speeds were horrible. I also had many problems even getting it to update. Then, you have the situation where one of the Manjaro devs was telling people to change their system clock, because they forgot to renew certificates...  Antergos was fast, sleek and did everything I asked of it. It was a nice OS and everything except my printer worked. I'm using Fedora 22 now but if i were to switch, then to Antergos."

You end up with half assed repos while they ""stability test"". There was even a bug involving the clock, and manjaro's official answer was to manually change it. Not exactly a good solution.  Secondly it doesnt work out of the box quite as well as ubuntu/mint.  For example, media keys, standby on lid close work out of the box for ubuntu. Manjaro to get working ""properly"" without any apparent day to day issues, still required you (at the time of my test) to dig through dotfiles. If you're going to dig through wikis, mans, to edit dotfiles, might as well go through the effort of working with the real deal."

linux,3duzai,GeneticsGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:08:26 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, Manjaro is to Arch as Ubuntu is to Debian. I would add that Antergos is to Arch as LMDE is to Debian. I have tried both, and I don't really see the appeal of Antergos. That isn't to say its a bad distro in of itself, but I'm not sure what hole it's trying to fill. Ultimately, Antergos is Arch, and I would not feel comfortable telling a beginner that Antergos will offer a GUI-only, or issue-free experience; advanced users should be able to just install Arch, or use the AIS (I suggest Evo/Lution Linux for this purpose). Ultimately, a beginner who does not have Arch experience, and who encounters issues on Antergos will be totally lost, because Antergos tries to hide it's Arch underpinnings with pretty GUIs.   Manjaro on the other hand, at least tries to be user friendly, and hold back updates (as others have mentioned) to improve stability. I will admit, Manjaro has had it's fair share of problems in the past, but has shows consistant progress with each major release. I have never had to use the shell on a Manjaro system, while I need to use the shell on Arch (and by extension Antergos) frequently, in order for the system to operate correctly. Additionally, the Manjaro community tends to be more welcoming and friendly towards beginners, whereas you are far more likely to get an ""RTFM"" from the Arch camp.   Of course, there are users of both, and while I philosophically disagree with Antergos, it is a fine distro, and I have nothing against it from a technological perspective. Besides, any distro one or more people use is a valid and useful distro, as it expands user choice and freedom, regardless of whether I or anyone else agrees with it at all."

linux,3duzai,Godzoozles,4,Mon Jul 20 01:58:23 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the only reason I stepped back to using Arch is because it comes with so very very little that it allows you to build Linux exactly how you want.

I mean, ya, you'll learn real fast, but you'll probably also learn to hate linux too in the meantime if you are not used to it lol.  I should also point out that I like Linux Mint, but cool thing on Arch Linux is just install Cinnamon in Arch and I've found it to be more stable on Arch.  I have not tried the new 17.2 Mint though.

I prefer a well tested, stable OS that doesn't change when I run daily/weekly updates I disagree with their update policy about holding back security fixes and new versions of certain packages   Specifically, Mint Updater doesn't display updates for packages they consider ""unsafe"" to update. The rules file lists these:  dbus|*|4|| *xorg|*|4|| acpid|*|4|| mountall|*|4|| mesa|*|4|| systemd|*|4|| plymouth|*|4|| upstart|*|4|| *base-files|*|5|| *linux-|*|5|| linux|*|5|| grub|*|5|| grub2|*|5||   As security fixes come out for the Linux kernel, systemd, xorg, etc. they don't get applied. You can turn back on the unsafe packages in the settings, but since they're targeting the less savvy user, most likely they won't know about the policy or the settings to change it.  To be fair, most home users are behind a firewall, so it's not a critical issue, but it's not infeasible that a user could get compromised on a public WiFi network, or as part of an attack against something that is public facing like a web browser.  If they changed this policy, I personally still might not use it, but I would have no issues recommending it to others because of how much work Mint puts into making the OS functional right after install."

I think it started with a newbie being talked down to by someone high up, and little other things such as changing internal identifiers from Ubuntu to Mint and downright bashing the horse they rode in on. :/  Edit: I guess my opinion offended someone? Seriously, what the hell guys..."
linux,3duzai,Wily_Penguin,-5,Mon Jul 20 01:27:23 2015 UTC,"I can't say about other people, but when I look at Linux Mint screenshots, it feels like it's trying to resemble Windows. I like GNU/Linux because it is not limited by the look-and-feel of Windows. When I see distros hinting that ""user-friendly"" means ""more similar to Windows"", I don't really like that.  Oh, and, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Mint does not try to look and feel like Windows. But I'm just explaining what might be the reason for the backlash, not defending it."
linux,3duzai,nextnextfinish,2,Mon Jul 20 00:59:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say Mint is more Windows than Windows now. My Grandfather just got a new Windows 8.1 notebook. He's rather confused by it. He just wants web browser, solitaire and word processor and can't understand the new look. I bet he'd feel at home with Mint."
linux,3duzai,Wily_Penguin,3,Mon Jul 20 11:38:00 2015 UTC,"The way windows looks and feels has been tried and tested over the past 15 years extensively and fits the widest ranges of uses for the common person, both due to intuitiveness without sacrificing a lot in usability and the fact that it's by far the most common desktop GUI. There is likely to be a lot of people who don't like this as a fact, and that they're willing to spend a lot of time customizing specific details to achieve a setup that works specifically for their needs - but yes. User friendly can be said to be to some degree analogous to ""similar to Windows"", given that Windows is more abundant.   Thankfully, there's a lot of other choices available, but by my own personal experience Cinnamon on Mint has been by far the best choice for me deploying on other people's equipment without complaints, ranging from children to people studying electronic engineering, Mint simply works the way the majority of people expect given the limitations present in the ecosystem provided."
linux,3duzai,dog_cow,0,Mon Jul 20 01:36:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree. ""User-friendly"" is by no means equivalent to ""what users have been used to"". Windows is not really the #1 operating system because it's better or easier. It's pretty much the other way around: it is seen as easier because it's so widespread and people are used to it. I've heard of people that grew up with Linux who find Windows unfriendly.  Maybe people who are new to Linux really want ""a Linux that looks and feels like Windows"". But I guess those who grew used to window/desktop managers like GNOME et al. don't really like the idea that Linux would be limited by the look and feel of an OS that is just learning to value things like multiple desktops and powerful command lines."
linux,3duzai,Wily_Penguin,4,Mon Jul 20 02:20:34 2015 UTC,"It's not equivalent, but there is a large degree of familiarity being important in ""user-friendliness"", this exists in all aspects of life, not just software. Personally, I haven't used Vim much because I prefer the simplicity of Nano, despite the fact I know Vim has a much greater capacity than Nano, I'm much more used to Nano than Vim and so continue to do so. (To anyone reading, please don't drag Emacs into this, it's completely tangential to the point :P ). Similarly so, when people are presented with something they're already accustomed to due to familiarity, whether or not it's the most efficient way of doing something, they'll happily utilize it and will need a large incentive to overcome the lack of willpower to learn something new. For example with me, I'm varely rarely editing such quantities of text in a command line environment for me to find it worthwhile to learn Vim, although this is likely to change in the future. Analogously, to the lay people, Mate with Cinnamon is a great fit, although people like myself will constantly try new environments ""just because"" and eventually find something that sticks."

Nice install, system up very quickly on a spare.   HOWEVER, as soon as I went to add a custom keyboard short-cut, the machine froze. Only way out of it was to drop down to the terminal and restart X. I could not stand how laggy the animations are -- this on the same machine which runs GNOME 3.16 like an absolute champ.  I noticed at least half a dozen other, minor bugs. This kind of thing seriously ruins the experience for what is supposed to be a 'polished' distro.

In fact, just in general to connect a suffix to some weird symbol that isn't normally pluralized.  http://www.grammar-monster.com/lessons/apostrophes_show_plural_of_abbreviations.htm"

And I entirely disagree with usages like:   You use too many and's in your writing   Which that page claims is right.  Of course, arguing about this only goes so far since English is not standardised or regulated (except through use). Some guides allow for apostrophes for pluralising single characters (""all the 7's""). Personally I find that unnecessary and jarring.  edit:  The Guardian and Observer style guide (my preferred guide since it tends to take a modern approach and favours clarity of meaning and readability) suggests (under 'abbreviations and acronyms') capitalising in such case, which is my preferred approach."

linux,3dsozw,cowens,7,Sun Jul 19 12:49:14 2015 UTC,"There's DNSCrypt which both encrypts and authenticates the communication. It does require the DNS provider to support the protocol so the provider options are currently much more limited than with normal DNS.

I don't know how it'll affect OpenDNS but I'm always cautious when it comes to companies merging into larger ones (the bigger they are the less ethical they become in my experience).  Just to clarify, you're in no way required to trust OpenDNS if you want to use DNSCrypt, I only mentioned them because they seem to be the only widely know provider that supports DNSCrypt. I use OpenNIC myself, though if I had to choose I'd still rather trust OpenDNS or even a random entry from that provider list than my ISP or Google."
linux,3dsozw,MoonlightSandwich,2,Sun Jul 19 15:55:56 2015 UTC,"that would require you to trust OpenDNS   No, it wouldn't. Using DNSCrypt with OpenDNS will protect you against MITM sniffing regardless of your trust in them."

How is DNSCrypt making it so you don't have to trust the DNS provider?  Unless everybody up to the root servers is implementing it, I don't see a way to ensure you get valid information."
linux,3dsozw,cowens,2,Sun Jul 19 16:38:18 2015 UTC,I don't see a way to ensure you get valid information.   I'm talking about not being necessary to trust the DNS provider to solve the specific issue of someone sniffing your DNS traffic. Ensuring the responses to your queries are actually valid is a completely different problem that has nothing to do with DNSCrypt.
linux,3dsozw,_hlt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"The original claim was:   There's DNSCrypt which both encrypts and authenticates [emphasis mine] the communication.   And if the provider is the one responsible for providing the encryption (which I am almost 100% sure it is under DNSCrypt), then nothing prevents them from running a MITM attack on their own DNS servers.  If you think this is unlikely, please look up Paxfire.  They paid ISPs to run MITM attacks on their own DNS for fun and profit (at least until bottom dropped out of the ad market and they went out of business).  This means you must trust the DNS provider.  OpenDNS (which gets funding from some of the same sources Paxfire did), has proven in the past that they are not trustworthy.  Verzion, Comcast, Frontier, Cox, and host of others have also proven they are not trustworthy (either by working directly with Paxfire or implementing their own version of Paxfire's technology).  DNS, and all of the variants I have seen so far, are fatally flawed from a privacy perspective.  You really need something like TOR to be reasonably certain no one is looking over your shoulder (and even then it is susceptible to an advanced persistent threat)."
linux,3dsozw,cowens,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"Alternate longer answer: run your own DNS server that accepts recursive queries.  Get several thousand other people to use it.

Why do they have this power? The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) explains why this is necessary in RFC 2826 (may, 2000). Only to be followed by RFC 2870 a month later, talking about a new root. The IETF wasn't happy with the way the new TLDs discussion were going in the hands of ICANN (https://archive.icann.org/en/tlds/new-tld-resolutions-16jul00.htm). After this happened, they changed the way the new TLDs would work, and insted of putting more power in the hands of the already-too-powerful DNS registers, the new TLDs were set up in a way that created more options on this space. This made the discussion about a new root go away. But, time to time someone will actually set up a new root, ICANN keeps track of them here. Doesn't mean much though, because Operators just ignore them, they would only accept a new root if the IETF appointed it.

You don't have to setup a passphrase, but it is recommended, especially if you are doing this on a laptop. If your device is compromised, having a passphrase on the key gives you time to be able to remove your keys from your other machines so that they aren't compromised too.

I agree about key based authentication, it also gets rid of the necessity of providing the first password to log in as normal user.   For the passwordless sudo I have some hesitation as anybody who has the password for that user would instantly become root (sudo bash and there you go). But in the other hand, I'm thinking that if somebody can have the password for that user he could as well have the password for the root user, with equal probability, or maybe more probability since people with malicious intent generally go directly after root.

linux,3e0meu,McSwiggens,4,Tue Jul 21 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"Why would that be a sign of a browser exploit? The browser is supposed to show a dialog box with an OK button, if the page requests that (with the JavaScript function window.alert).

Furthermore, why would someone who posesses a highly valuable Firefox 0day tell you that with an unneccessary dialog box, instead of simply infecting your computer silently?  I can't replicate the behaviour you report. But I also can't find a ""download"" button on nodejs.org. I only see a ""DOWNLOADS"" link, an ""INSTALL"" button, and a ""DOWNLOADS"" button."

Again, why would that be a sign of a browser 0day?  If there was a browser 0day involved and you got infected by visiting nodejs.org, the code of nodejs.org would necessarily have been modified to trigger that exploit (you did visit https://nodejs.org, didn't you?). But if we assume that nodejs.org was modified, the behaviour you observed can be explained entirely without the involvement of a browser 0day (e.g. someone added alert(""I would rather not"") to the ""DOWNLOADS"" button's ""click"" event handler).  On the other hand, alerting the user by showing a dialog box is highly unexpected of an attacker that has a browser 0day.  I simply don't get why your conclusion from this is ""More Firefox 0days!?""."
linux,3e0meu,Eingaica,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:40:48 2015 UTC,"""More Firefox 0days!?"". Notice the question mark?

The light-ish weight desktops (such as lxde) are kinda 'retro' by design. In that they forego things like swooshy animations, transitions, heavy graphics etc. in favour of being lean and fast.  If you want a desktop that looks modern out of the box then, in terms of the mainstream, you're pretty much limited to Gnome (that's not default Gnome, I just think Antergos does a really nice Gnome) and KDE (Plasma 5). Outside the mainstream there are a few other options such as Elemenrary's Pantheon and Solus's Budgie desktop (if you're ok with something Android-looking).  But... part of the joy of Linux is that many DEs can be configured to your liking. KDE in particular can be made to do/look like anything you like and work in any way you like. But most other desktops are extremely configurable too. Even Xfce (of which I am not a fan) can be made to look very modern and slick.  Have a look on /r/unixporn and see what sort of things people are doing. Ignore the tilers as I don't think that's what you're after. And when you see something you like take a note of what DE and themes they're using and try to replicate what they're doing (tailoring it to yourself along the way of course). You can even ask people for their configs if you like - most people are happy to share them.  Now if you want it set up for you - if you want it to be beautiful and modern out of the box - then you'll have to take a look at various distros and see how they set up their default desktops. Wikipedia's good for this. If you want some recommendations then I personally think Antergos does a great job with all their desktops. OpenSUSE does a decent (though very standard) job with KDE. And Xubuntu does an okay Xfce.  But...   i don't want to do a install with a DE just to find out that was not the right one and having to wipe it reinstall the os again.   You don't have to switch OS to try different DEs (with a few possible exceptions: Unity, Pantheon, Budgie(?), Cinnamon). Most DEs are available on most Distros. Find a distro you like (it really doesn't matter which you choose, they're the same in all the important ways, they each just have different personalities. Find the one you get along with) and then install the DE you want."

You can edit the password store using ordinary unix shell commands alongside the pass command. There are no funky file formats or new paradigms to learn. There is bash) completion so that you can simply hit tab to fill in names and commands, as well as completion for zsh and fish available in the completion folder.

Yes, the question states it has to be open source, and yubikey neo is open source afaik. but you don't know if your key is really running the open sourced code, neither what the hardware is making.

This is not something about what you think you they can do, but just checking their history.  If you are looking for an open source solution, yubikey is not a candidate as you don't know neither the software it runs and neither the hardware it runs. Years ago yubiko let people load the OpenPGP applet, so you can download the code and install it... open source it that case had a meaning.   Currently, a yubikey is not an open source solution and it can be a really really good one, but also a bad one, who knows? It's just a matter of trust. I only related this as the search was for an open source solution.   The main issue is still that, if there is a software bug you have to put the yubikey in the trash like here https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/SecurityAdvisory%202015-04-14.html"

Tldr: you were able to use (not retreive) a PGP Key stored on the Yubikey without the need of the user pin due to the bug in the unpatchable openPGP applet.  The bug itself cost Yubico a lot of reputation. It's a serious issue, a good code review process definitely should have covered. There is simply a lack of alternatives and even if there is, who knows if they know it better? Yubico was at least open and transparent about the issue and getting a replacement was no problem. Sure that is the very least they can do but unfortunately not how every company handles issues like these recently.  Not being able to update/modify the openPGP applet is a security feature that prevents Eve from installing malicious software on your device. Yes, that means there is no way to compile it on your own, but as you already mentioned this would be pretty useless anyway as long as you didn't built the hardware yourself.  I really understand what you're trying to say, I'm just saying that at some point you have to trust some third party. Which party that is might differ from person to person. The alternative is to either go back to using no digital devices at all or really design and built all your systems and software yourself. Otherwise you're just moving around your line of trust."

Both free as hardware and software, because it's the same gpg people. The problem is that they don't want to support nfc because it will open ""too many attacking vectors"".  To be honest, i doubt that's the reason why the neo is locked. My guess is... too many people bricking them (i did that once, using their documentation. they replaced it for free which is awesome they do that and why i know they have that policy). Then, they have to keep it simple to avoid those problems which will stop preventing Even from installing software there.  If you have some time and nfc is not mandatory, try gnuk sometime. As it's made by gnupg people it has even support (in the development version) for ed25519 and curve25519 which are the fastest things i have tried in an openpgp device.  For me, it's the only option of having a nice usb openpgp token with open source software and hardware and as it's made by gnupg devs it also reduces the people who you needs to trust.

linux,3dtczr,totallyblasted,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:52:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on the attacker. Let's say the attacker has gained access to a database of passwords, where yours was included. Fortunately, these have been somewhat secured, unfortunately it is with md5 as opposed to some stronger mechanism (yes, some sites will still do this) and the salt is server wide as opposed to user based. This is a really shitty security setup, and we obviously wouldn't ever do this.   But that doesn't keep certain sites from doing it anyway.  Then there's the idea that the username is not encrypted, and the attacker, through a few Google searches, gains useful information about one of the users. Namely that they are statistically likely to use words, as opposed to random combinations of ascii symbols.   Now the attacker can reduce a lot of it to dictionary attacks with a without capitalized words. Suddenly the attack becomes a whole lot more realistic.   This is not a made up situation either."

Now whenever you want to read or edit it, vim will prompt you for the key. Hopefully it goes without saying but the swap file that vim creates when you open it will also be encrypted.  From the :help encryption:    There is never 100% safety.  The encryption in Vim has not been tested for robustness. The algorithm used for 'cryptmethod' ""zip"" is breakable.  A 4 character key in about one hour, a 6 character key in one day (on a Pentium 133 PC).  This requires that you know some text that must appear in the file.  An expert can break it for any key.  When the text has been decrypted, this also means that the key can be revealed, and other files encrypted with the same key can be decrypted. Pkzip uses the same encryption as 'cryptmethod' ""zip"", and US Govt has no objection to its export.  Pkzip's public file APPNOTE.TXT describes this algorithm in detail. The implementation of 'cryptmethod' ""blowfish"" has a flaw.  It is possible to crack the first 64 bytes of a file and in some circumstances more of the file. Use of it is not recommended, but it's still the strongest method supported by Vim 7.3 and 7.4.  The ""zip"" method is even weaker.    So it's not the greatest security, but if someone wanted to go through that much trouble to figure out the password I used on some vaguely described message board, they can have it.

linux,3du0vn,tankmohit11,9,Sun Jul 19 13:35:31 2015 UTC,"EDIT BELOW:  Lots of great responses and a couple things I want to preface this with. I mention the resource heavy nature of i3 which is only half true. i3  is very light compared to other programs, and extremely light compared to desktop enviorments.   When I say resource heavy It is in comparison to other, lighter wm's which do not have the same functionality as i3 by a longshot.   /u/Slabity corrected a couple of my points: SLOC not equating to speed becuse of diffences in xlib and xcb libraries.  Read about that: here  Pretty graphs: here  OP BELOW:  Hey! As someone who has switched wm's like it was going out of style I thought that I would try and give you a good awser.  For the most part they are very similar and their differnces can be boiled down to three things:   Custimization  hotkeys  features vs sloc  First off all to awnser your question about preformance: There are certain attributes that can make wm's run faster. One is the smaller the program, for example dwm is a lot smaller than i3: It will run faster. Another is that some programs are edited with a config file in your home directory, others have to be recompiled using a config.h file. Typically when you have to recompile the program to change things as opposed to having a dotfile, It will run faster. Reason being that the program doesnt need to read off a dotfile each time you start it, and change it.   I'll go through the ones you mention and a couple more:  xmonad: xmonad has the intresting aspect of being haskell centric. Editing the program is done in haskell.  Becuase of such I have not used it, I don't know haskell and have no drive to learn in. I have heard from people who use it though that you can edit and use xmonad without knowing haskell. Much the same way that I can edit the config.h file for other wm's with only rudimentry c knowlege. many of these wm's focus on being small and simple: xmonad is one of them.  Differnces in hotkeys are trivial as they can almost always be changed. I belive that xmonad uses alt as its mod key, something that I, since starting as an i3 user, get annoyed by. Going hand in hand with the theme of being a small program xmonad by default is simple and lacks features many people want. It can be extened though with modules.  Dwm: Dwm or dynamic window manager was made by those suckless folks. That being said you can assume a few things about it. It will be: written in c, boast a low line count, have to be recompiled, and extendable. Similar to xmonad but  c not haskell.  dwm is technically not a tiling window manger becuase it supports tiling, floating and monocle views, hence the dynamic part. dwm is lean,  fully customizable through the config.h (hotkeys, colors, etc etc) I'd say that dwm is one of the fastest wm's (of the ones that are dynamic)  Awesome: Awesome is similar to dwm as many other window managers are. Dwm is amazing but lacks the functionality that some poeple want, also some people do not want to bother installing extentions for it.  Awesome is small, customizable with lua and has many more features than dwm. things like support for various text boxes and status bars.  Ion3: I dont know much about ion, I do know that the programmer had a bit of drama around him in regards to copyright things. Ion also uses lua. and has been abandoned, dont use derilict software: there are better alternatives.  Musca: Another old software that I know nothing about, I think its similar to dwm and ratposion and makes use of the standard dmenu that so many of these wm's like to borrow.  Again, development stopped in 2009, time to move on.  catwm: cute And Tiny wm is just what it says, a small wm with minimal functionality. Written and c and configured in a config.h. I have no doubt it is extremly fast. What it isnt though is maintained.  Those are all the ones you mentioned but I wanted to mention a few more of note:  i3: i3 is pretty heavy on the resources and provides the same functionality that can be achieved elseware.  Becuase of that I have left it behind, If you do want to use it, check out the airblader i3-gaps fork. You customize it by editing a config file which slows it down a little more. Resource heavy but also feature rich it is some peoples favorite and others least favorite. the hotkeys make use of the mod4 key (windows key) and are similar to most other wm's.  FrankenWM: This is my current wm and I am very happy with it, basically dwm with some extra features. Useless gaps, and differnt tiling layouts like fibonnachi and so fourth,  Notable mentions:  Bspwm: Some poeple swear by this and it seems cool, I need to try it.  2bwm: Not exactly tiling but a simple script can change that, Love this wm.  Swm & wmutils using this combo you can achive a minimal window manager that really sticks to unix principles.  cwm: simple but not for me.   More you might want to look at: spectrwm, monster, fluxbox, openbox, fvwm, herbstluft, stumwm, wmfs, wmii."

linux,3du0vn,HouseofTea,7,Mon Jul 20 00:14:36 2015 UTC,"I think you are unfair about i3 being slow and heavy on resources. In practice i3 uses only a tiny bit more memory than i3 or xmonad, and a lot less than awesome or even openbox. On top of that, i3 has even less CPU usage due to using XCB over Xlib. This is one of the reasons why 'Low-line-count' != 'Faster'   You customize it by editing a config file which slows it down a little more.   The program reads the file once during startup. Run-time speed is unaffected. Even if it had to open 100 files, it would only affect the startup time. Making a connection to the X11 server is where most of the startup time goes to anyways for most small WMs.  In any case, there is probably going to be no noticeable difference in the performance of any of these WMs, even on a 10 year old laptop."

The main difference is the language that the WM is built on and the language used to configure the WM. Sometimes, those two languages are the same (e.g. xmonad is both written and configured in Haskell), while other times they are different (e.g. awesome is written in C but configured in Lua).  Most tiling WMs have the same basic functionalities, and most also have the same extensions. However, when I moved from awesome to xmonad, I did notice that there were a few xmonad extensions which (as far as I know) had no readily available analogous extension in awesome (at least at the time). (Probably vice versa, too.) Note also that some tiling WMs come with a status bar (awesome, I think), while others do not (xmonad).  My advice is to choose the WM whose configuration language you're most comfortable in. I like playing with Haskell, so that's why I use xmonad. (I also like the idea that the Haskell code is type-checked at compile time, so that in principle there should never be any runtime errors, hence no freezing.)"

One nice feature: it algorithmically retiles your windows among several different layouts with a keystroke, so you don't need to think very hard about where to put your windows.  (This is similar to tmux, if you've used that.) Stumpwm is insanely hackable (it's a running lisp system, with all that entails), however it's heavier than xmonad.

In other words, if you just replace the WiFi card with some random card that should fit your computer, your computer might not accept it (I've heard it won't even get past POST). From what I've read, it is not purely malicious. According to advocates for this, it has to do with Lenovo attempting to save money by not having to license every card under the sun thus (supposedly) passing the savings on to the customer."
linux,3dsb4p,fixed_that_for_me,3,Sun Jul 19 01:23:07 2015 UTC,"Aside from refusing to boot, there's really nothing the firmware can do to prevent you from using an alternative wifi card. From the perspective of any legitimate purpose the firmware has, it's just a PCIe device that it isn't doing anything with, and even in Lenovo's bullshit firmware it can only check the vendor and device IDs and class code. If a device isn't on the firmware's approved list, it can't even know whether it's a wifi card or something else.  There's no licensing of anything that could possibly provide a motivation for this. The only remotely sane reason could be to dissuade users from making repairs or modifications and then attempting to get service from Lenovo."

The only remotely sane reason could be to dissuade users from making repairs or modifications and then attempting to get service from Lenovo.   Common theory, sadly totally false.  The whitelisting is a holdover from the IBM days.  It stemmed from an interpretation of FCC certification rules.  Most of the industry didn't share that interpretation.  (Personally, I agree with the rest of the industry; certification of the device as shipped isn't void just because you can replace the WLAN/WWAN card and make it non-compliant...)  That said, Lenovo has recently revisited that issue and taken a more mainstream approach, hence why new notebook BIOS/EFI implementations don't have a whitelist."

Yes, although obviously you can map them however you want.   Is EFI able to be disabled?   No, nor should you want to.  You're probably confusing Secure Boot with UEFI, but they're not one and the same.  Secure Boot can be disabled (although with modern Linux distros there's no reason to do that either.)  UEFI is integral to the notebook's operation, and while you can boot using BIOS emulation, there's absolutely no reason to do so provided you're using a distro which supports UEFI (i.e. one made in the last several years.)   I'm looking for a new laptop, but the whitelist thing really bothers me and is common on lenovo laptops.   Good news for you then!  There's no whitelist anymore."

Modern BIOSes are complex due to the number of hacks, while UEFI implementations are complex due to the breadth of what they support.  Neither is simple.  And as far as 512 MB?  Well... it doesn't have to take that much, and most drives are more than big enough for the space that it does need not to be an issue.  Unless you're using a BSD or an old distro, there really, really is not a good reason to disable UEFI.  Unless you like longer boot times and worse modesetting support early in the boot process."

Yes, he might not be using it on his main computer because he's unsure of how to dual-boot, but that just means someone here should help him out.   /u/Sleepy-Foxie, if you are interested in using Linux, you don't need to wait or boot off a USB. Installers for most distributions have setups for side-by-side installation, so you can start your computer and decide which you'd like to launch into.   Ubuntu, Linux Mint, among many others have this option in the installer, so after you've booted to that USB and decide to install, it'll ask if you want to install it alongside Windows. It's smart and detects it on the hard drive for you. Later on you can access files in Windows from Ubuntu, and resize partitions (portion of space reserved to one thing on a hard drive) later if you'd like. This would give you some good experience and you can always delete one or the other later with very little hassle. Ubuntu offers this guide, although it's much more self-explanatory in the actual installer.   If you'd like to know some more about it, let me know. Glad you had some fun messing around with Linux, and hopefully you'll get back to it soon enough."
linux,3dtcca,crosenblum,6,Mon Jul 20 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"I've had similar experiences.  Been a long time computer since 1980, on my 1st pc the Apple ][+.  The pc before this was using Windows XP, I was considering maybe upgrading to Windows 7.  But as soon as I saw Windows 8, and saw what a disaster in UI it was, I knew I had to find an alternative.  I tried a wide variety of distro's, Pinguy OS, Linux Mint, Peppermint Two, Xubuntu, and a few others I just can't remember.  I liked having an older pc, being faster runnning, more secure and reliable.  But what I really loved is the wide variety of DE's there were/are. Because I loved being able to have total control over my desktop.  I am currently using Debian Jessie 8 with XFCE and loving it.  Even though I am still dual-booting, with Win7-64 on the other partition.  Okay now here's the basics of dual-booting from my personal experience.  Before you make any changes, make full offline backups of all data, files, anything essential, that you might need.  For a simple dual-boot you need to divide your partitions like this.  Windows OS Linux OS - Your Distro of Choice -Root Partition -Swap Partition -Home Partition  So the second step is figuring out how you want to divide your main hard drive into multiple partitions.  There are tons of guides out there, but I just divided into two major partitions.  Then take the linux half and divide that into 3 seperate partitions.  -Swap is basically a garbage partition, I usually put like 20-30 gigs in there at most.  -Home Partition will have all your personal user data, your documents, images, videos, etc.   The benefit of a home partition is that if you like to switch linux distro's a bit, or do distro-hopping, you keep the home partition, just change the boot os.  So how you divide your partitions depends a  lot on the side of your hard drive.  I hope this helps a bit."

I can't think of anything that would be reasonable to remove from it. This tame call is too inflexible. It has hard-wired assumptions about use cases and even paths.

That's not true: Consider I write a program against libfoo.so. I test the program and find what system calls it uses. Now libfoo.so is updated and the new libfoo.so uses fallocate to speed up file IO. My program didn't use fallocate before and thus crashes now. Another example would be if the library started to use openat instead of open to support very long path names. If you didn't anticipate this, your program is going to crash. Are you going to think about including every single obscure system call?  This kind of stuff happens way more often than you would think and it's really hard to anticipate what exact system calls a program is going to use on the machine it runs on. For this reason, it makes a lot of sense to only roughly specify what kind of things the program is allowed to do instead of regulating each and every system call.   Preventing system calls that weren't anticipated is a good thing, because programs need to be adapted to a meaningful sandbox model.   So you like having a system where programs break every other week because of minor changes in libraries they depend on? Notice that there doesn't even have to be any changes in dependencies to cause stuff like this; for instance, you can configure glibc's malloc using some environment variables to either use malloc, brk, or both.

Anyway, simply removing privileges in an undisciplined way also doesn't provide a sandbox. It has to be integrated into the application that's being sandboxed to be useful.

Where tame()'s API falls short is that it isn't flexible enough for practical use. In defines whole classes of operations in order to not have one enum value for syscall but that means it's very coarse. It tries to fit applications into topical slots but in 2015 we know that doesn't work out.

The tame call is a whitelist of permitted low-level actions applied by processes to themselves. That's also exactly what seccomp provides. The tame call is a bit more flexible/useful than the original mode 1 seccomp, and much less useful than the modern mode 2 seccomp. It's not a general purpose tool for creating a tight sandbox for any use case like mode 2 seccomp. It only handles the use cases it was designed to take care of and poorly at that. It permits more privileges than necessary when it's capable enough to be used while falling short of working at all in other cases.  A less capable feature based around a union of inflexible, hard-coded policies it not something to be proud of. It's not simplicity, just bad design."

If it's not juddering, it should be playing back at the native framerate of the source media, lagged or interpolated to your monitor's refresh rate; you wouldn't see the number budge at all.

It's time for that to die as a criticism so it can stop holding the industry back - just because 1080p made old remastered movies look obviously fake doesn't mean 480p is superior for film. The soap opera effect needs to be renamed ""the as it actually looks effect"" and if it really bothers you so much it takes 2 seconds for you to set your players fullscreen refresh rate to 24 while the rest of the world enjoys HFR content.  Now that being said it does take a lot of computing power to make more frames out of crap 24 fps content that is still the mainstream and if you don't have a good gpu+cpu or good hardware interpolator you'll likely get some extra artifacting that is noticeable if you pause on in between frames."

Calling it the as it actually looks effect is very questionable, as it is not. This is an algorithm that creates fake frames between real ones. Sure, I much prefer real 60fps over real 24fps, but that's not what SVP does.   it takes 2 seconds for you to set your players fullscreen refresh rate to 24   24fps scaled down from fake 60fps scaled up from real 24fps is not the same as the original 24fps. This is like transcoding music, lossy codec to lossy codec, only worse, as not just the codecs but the fps scaling filter itself is lossy. For fuck's sake, if you want fps upscaling, keep it at the player! I'd probably even use such a filter when playing, sometimes. Just please, don't distribute mangled videos.  Rather than stretching, I'm more interested in getting 24fps without jitter, via the freesync that DisplayPort 1.2a implements."

The amount of interpolation for that gives more percentage generated data than frame doubling with the same amount of information to predict from.

I also feel that motion interpolation can be useful for some sources e.g. those where the smooth motion of 60 fps is ideal but you don't care about any potential artifacts.   I agree overall with those that have suggested a closed source implementation isn't ideal because I'm sure it won't be maintainable over a long period (5+ years).

linux,3dozlb,trish1975,5,Sat Jul 18 23:00:55 2015 UTC,How difficult would it be for Mozilla to switch everything over to GPL? Perhaps this event could be a catalyst for convincing them to do that. That seems like their (and our) best hope in the long term.

I imagine there's reasons besides legal difficulties that they came up with and have kept the license they did, though.  I don't think they're the only ones that are facing a very real problem that maybe didn't exist even 10 years ago - widespread commercialization of their products and potentially being snuffed out by them.  Lot of this stuff is just above my paygrade; the Canonical kerfuffle gave me enough of a migraine to last me a week. :p"

Oh, this is a problem that has existed for a long time. It's basically what happened with BSD and OSX, right? The GPL was designed with this problem in mind. Now that I think about it, I wonder why Mozilla hasn't been using the GPL since their beginning - they ought to have known better. I'm sure there must be some reason. In fact, I just went to the Mozilla website and found this email for questions: licensing@mozilla.org - I'll ask about it and post back here.  Who knows, maybe we (the foss community) could start a petition or something?  EDIT: Instead of sending an email to that address, I've made a post here instead: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozilla.governance  I'm also going to post that link to some mozilla subreddits as well. I really don't know the answer to the question ""how difficult would it be for Mozilla to protect their open source better?"" so I'd like to just spark discussions before demanding it of them."

Back then it might have been a device driver, a router, someone swiping little things here and there for Windows programs...now, seems like there's a couple stories every month you can find without even trying about companies riding Linux like a rented mule.

linux,3dozlb,thgntlmnfrmtrlfmdr,2,Sat Jul 18 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"Why spin off and monetize rather than build the successful mobile OS you were hired to do in the first place?    I'll answer your rhetorical because honestly, there are answers to be had for it. It isn't limited to a diaspora out of agreement which your question implies. What if it was a split due to ideological disagreement? They made a run at the open market with the cellphones, but that doesn't mean it was a success, does it? What if their working together was contingent on it being one?  The company backing Gong is owned by the Chinese government, a group that has been seeking operating systems to act as a soft barrier against Chinese domestic adoption of Western ideas through applications, etc. They have been looking for a contender against Android, which many felt FirefoxOS might actually be. Their $100 million investment in Gong's copy, to go proprietary, is a copy of the same model Google chased in acquiring Android initially.  Massive body flush with cash pours it into an open source project in an effort to spur adoption. Then spends more to make proprietary and more popular variants, in an effort to create a competitor for the current market leader. If China could pull that off with a variant that allows them to build a competing market more closely limited to their geography, that would meet with longterm ideological goals of theirs. So they likely baited Gong into a partnership that way. Although it's possible they had their fingers in him long before he went to Firefox."

linux,3dozlb,pizzaiolo_,5,Sat Jul 18 02:59:47 2015 UTC,"A great mobile os doesn't mean jack, if you don't have an ecosystem around your platform. An ecosystem can mean and does include a lot of things. PIM (mail, calendar, contact syncing), media store (movies, music), app store and a developer following, hardware manufacturers dedicated to brining your os to the end user, partners, sound financing. What killed off competition to Microsoft Windows in the desktop market was the lack of applications and developers. Desktop Linux never took off without Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop. PIM and media can be brought to your os through apps. Therefore I would argue that a large application ecosystem is the most important part. But, of course, it means nothing if no phones get released, because no hardware manufacturer is willing to pick it up.  Even Microsoft wasn't successful at this in the mobile market. And Nokia failed within four years and went under.   Saying this more or less means that Android and iPhone will continue to dominate the market for the forseeable future.   Then again.... There is a big BUT. For example the hardware makers. They loath Windows. They have razor thin margins, because they are replaceable. Meanwhile Microsoft enjoys monopoly prices. For Windows and Office they have huge profitability. For every dollar invested they get what? 10 dollars in profit? Something like that. And the hardware makers get bossed around.   So you already have the hardware makers on your side. They have a core interest in pushing alternative operating systems. Symbian the company was founded in 1998 for exactly that reason by the companies dominating the mobile phone market at that time. Microsoft had just entered the smart phone market and they were trembling in fear that they would share the fate of the pc makers. In the end, Android did exactly what Microsoft had done earlier. They are currently fighting being replaced by companies like Xiaomi. Google has all the power. They have none.  To get the developers? Difficult. But web apps may work for both iPhones and Android and a third (Firefox) operating system. Which is exactly why Firefox OS or similar operating systems have the highest chance of becoming a viable option. If developer tools become popular that directly target the web browser that limit the work for porting applications between the dominant operating systems and work in that third platform as well. Blackberry simply made themselves Android app compatible, because they can't wait that long.  Now if any of those forks become popular, it can benefit Firefox OS as well. If the apps are compatible.  There is an added bonus. Currently the trend is towards webkit and it's children. For a free web it is better to have a diversity of browser engines. If the forks stay with Gecko, even better."

linux,3dozlb,samisafish69,2,Sat Jul 18 17:10:43 2015 UTC,"From my understanding of the MPL (please correct me if I'm wrong), it has a benefit over BSD in that any code under the MPL, even after being modified, must still be made available. So at the very least, the FFOS parts will get some contributions back from this. Of course, the question is if the company will even care about violating the license..."
linux,3dozlb,ydna_eissua,3,Sat Jul 18 07:06:53 2015 UTC,"has a benefit over BSD in that any code under the MPL, even after being modified, must still be made available   Yes, but I think you have the idea backward.  If someone takes the code and leaves the license as is they are under no obligations to release their source.  If they incorporate it into a GPL they can release the project as a whole under the GPL.  BUT must also make the MPLv2 parts available individually under MPLv2   From all intents and purposes it's BSD license which can be transitioned to GPL for compatibility sake."
linux,3dozlb,samisafish69,5,Sat Jul 18 07:30:17 2015 UTC,"Huh. But looking over the license again, section 3.2a says:   Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient   Doesn't this say that the parts of software covered under the MPL must have the source code be made available?"
linux,3dozlb,ydna_eissua,6,Sat Jul 18 07:37:13 2015 UTC,I appear to be wrong then.    The FSF needs to re-word their summary on the license list page.  I did not gather that from their wording.    Apologies everyone!
