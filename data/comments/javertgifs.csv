javertgifs,2p7pxi,mr_jiffy,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:43:37 2014 UTC,"I ""photoshoped"" it onto that puppet. By ""photoshop"" I mean I actually use GIMP.  This is my OC and thank you so much for the feedback. Nice to hear. Because sometimes I feel like I am not putting enough effort.  Cheers :)"
javertgifs,2p7pxi,mr_jiffy,1 point,Tue Dec 23 02:02:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I think when people say photoshop it has become the term for editing a piece of media that requires more than your usual mspaint."
