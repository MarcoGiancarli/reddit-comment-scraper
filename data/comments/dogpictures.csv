dogpictures,3e299w,DrSeafood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:22 2015 UTC,Not sure. She is a rescue but we think long haired Chihuahua and maybe some Pom.

dogpictures,3e2ley,Ileach,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:24 2015 UTC,:(  It's hard on both of you
dogpictures,3e2ley,congalinechachacha,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've been doing it for years and it never gets any easier. His other trick is to camp out and sleep on the door mat in the hall, like a silent protest.  Probably thinking ""You shall not pass""."
dogpictures,3e2ley,tinyirishgirl,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:28 2015 UTC,In our lifetimes our beloved dogs will always be the ones who give us unconditionally from their loving hearts.
dogpictures,3e1za6,ScarlettSpice,4,Tue Jul 21 09:50:11 2015 UTC,Very sorry for your loss. Newfies are the best kind of dog.
dogpictures,3e1za6,tryingnottobefat,2,Tue Jul 21 10:18:17 2015 UTC,Cinder was definitely beautiful - so sorry for your sadness and loss.
dogpictures,3e1za6,congalinechachacha,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:51 2015 UTC,I am so sorry for your loss.  Your precious Cinder was so very beautiful and she had the loveliest kindest eyes.  Holding you both in my heart.  RIP Dearest Cinder
dogpictures,3e1za6,tinyirishgirl,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:04 2015 UTC,Thank you for your kind words. It means a lot.
dogpictures,3dyp6k,-73-,19,Mon Jul 20 16:45:53 2015 UTC,"We bought 3M traction pads for our Kayak, the stuff is designed to get more grippy when wet. Our dogs love kayaking and with the traction pad, we've been on some fairly rough (ruff) water and they've always done well.   http://i.imgur.com/a3GzGFv.jpg"
dogpictures,3dyp6k,turkeyworm,4,Mon Jul 20 20:37:15 2015 UTC,That's a really great idea!
dogpictures,3dyp6k,blunt_monger,8,Mon Jul 20 20:48:56 2015 UTC,Look at his little cocked eyebrows! üòç
dogpictures,3dyp6k,zumawizard,5,Mon Jul 20 20:30:24 2015 UTC,What a majestic looking beast.   BTW: Outward Hound Lifejackets are the shit.
dogpictures,3dyp6k,phill0406,4,Mon Jul 20 23:39:11 2015 UTC,I second this. It worked wonderfully
dogpictures,3dyp6k,4wnl05,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:00 2015 UTC,Can you tell me what size life jacket this is?  I was looking at the same life jacket but was unsure which would fit.
dogpictures,3dyp6k,4wnl05,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:57 2015 UTC,I got an xl when I needed a large. Still worked fine. Just needed to tighten it a bit
dogpictures,3dyp6k,AwkwardRN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:38 2015 UTC,Third. Got one for my pup a few weeks ago and used it last weekend on the boat. She didn't mind it one bit.
dogpictures,3dyp6k,sarcasmplease,3,Tue Jul 21 14:08:26 2015 UTC,How did that life vest work out? Was it buoyant enough to keep his head up? I'm currently searching for a life vest for my 20 lb pup for going on canoe excursions.
dogpictures,3dyp6k,silianrail,5,Mon Jul 20 21:03:27 2015 UTC,It worked out really well! Kept his head up and everything. The handles on the top worked well when I need to get him back in the kayak. I got it on short notice so I wasn't able to get the exact size I had to get 1 size up. But it worked super well. I just had to tighten down quite a bit
dogpictures,3dyp6k,littledaisymoo,2,Mon Jul 20 21:19:47 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks so much for the review :]
dogpictures,3dz6sz,aliciasheesh,4,Mon Jul 20 18:47:49 2015 UTC,So cute! What breed is this? Some sort of bulldog mix?
dogpictures,3dz6sz,ZeeFishy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:03 2015 UTC,Yep I think it was an English bulldog mix. Such a sweetie!
dogpictures,3dz6sz,SeaDegree,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:49 2015 UTC,Looks like English bulldog/boxer mix to me
dogpictures,3dz6sz,bubblitious,3,Mon Jul 20 23:29:27 2015 UTC,I could totally see that.
dogpictures,3dz6sz,ArsenicAndRoses,2,Tue Jul 21 00:19:38 2015 UTC,He just wants a hug and lovins.
dogpictures,3dz6sz,hiyosilver64,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:59:01 2015 UTC,I need this dog in my life. Such a face!!!:D
dogpictures,3dz6sz,TakePillsAndChill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:12:38 2015 UTC,Awww - His fur looks so soft - I want to kiss the top of his head and massage those ears!!!
dogpictures,3e1lu0,B1tchImTatted,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:49:16 2015 UTC,Too wonderful!  I think your precious pup is making a Contract Statement.
dogpictures,3e1lu0,tinyirishgirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"Separation anxiety, not cute.. That's a problem lol.. Perhaps you are overly good and will keep him.. But many people surrender their pets because of problems similar to this."
dogpictures,3dzyw4,PlanToBe,2,Mon Jul 20 22:08:28 2015 UTC,He's a mighty Maltese? Of course he's brave!
dogpictures,3dzyw4,congalinechachacha,2,Mon Jul 20 23:32:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, a Maltese and a best friend!"
dogpictures,3dzyw4,catkaj,2,Tue Jul 21 01:22:17 2015 UTC,Adorable!!
dogpictures,3dzyw4,RunicSSB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:08:35 2015 UTC,Not a brave enough boy for this!
