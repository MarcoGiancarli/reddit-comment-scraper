Rachel McAdams talks about length and girth of penis... lookin' real hot real nice. Taylor Kitsch is handsome man. Vince Vaughn in smaller font.. in jokerman font is also giving quite an interesting performance."
TimAndEric,3e2xo8,OptimusMine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:24 2015 UTC,"In short: yes. The first few episodes were pretty complicated and slow but now the season has really hit its stride. No character quite as memorable as Rust but Colin Ferrel, McAdams, and Kitsch are very solid. Vince Vaughn, not so much. I have a feeling that the last couple of episodes are going to be fantastic."

If it weren't for Gregg carrying the On Cinema empire when Tim abdicated the throne, he wouldn't have had anything to come back to after Jackson Hole broke him.  You can't have Bond without Q and you can't have a movie review show without a buff."

I think it's ironic that you bring up VHS, because Tim is like a Blu-Ray player - no matter how many times you try, you just can't record any new information onto his brain.

The screencap is from an episode of the GoPro show that aired 2013 and it seems pretty true to their plans so far, other than the moon short having been delayed. But it looks like we're getting a telethon next, possibly what they'll start working on after they've wrapped up season 2 of Bedtime Stories.

It's taking something that we know and can relate to, but deconstructing it and revealing that all the things that we think are normal can really be strange. Combine that ""out of body"" look at comedy and television and the like with silly characters and bits and throw in some improv and that's comedy bang bang.  I say improv but that's really mostly the podcast. The show takes many bits and characters and edits them and refines them into something more fitting for whatever the episode needs.

TimAndEric,3dhyft,Boygzilla,8,Thu Jul 16 21:13:31 2015 UTC,Was there a time in the 90s where talk shows would be randomly dispersed with old film footage? I've also seen Kyle Mooney make fun of this. Does anyone have examples of when this was originally done?
TimAndEric,3dhyft,igor6661,6,Thu Jul 16 15:59:03 2015 UTC,I do remember this happening pretty often in like educational programming for kids in the 90s. They often tried to be really cool and edgy in those.

TimAndEric,3dhyft,drayb3,3,Thu Jul 16 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yes! 97-2000. But this also looks more current. They have the ""form without function"" or ""style with no substance"" of MTV down to a T. I love this episode and can watch it again and again for its dead on satire of the MTV after school show style. Only thing they were missing was a medicated acne wash commercial featuring a boy band."

TimAndEric,3cuc2a,tiny_nosferatu,2,Sat Jul 11 05:19:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I went to a live show of his a couple of years ago, and between songs, he'd make incoherent mentions of not working for Tim and Eric anymore, and seemed to feel like they'd cheated him out of some money. As far as I can tell, he just felt he was somehow owed continued exposure/pay through T&E.   Sure was awkward, but I suppose if one expects a David Liebe Hart show to be lacking in awkward moments, the mistake is the ticketholder's.   Also, probably weirder: he'd changed the melodies to all of the songs he'd performed on Tim and Eric. I don't recall whether it was a copyright issue, or just David Liebe Hart being David Liebe Hart."

Stuff like this makes it obvious that it was the case, it has to be exhausting working like that. It was one of the charms of Tim & Eric Nite Live that they really had a hard time keeping things together with a unedited DLH on the set.

I would say that the relationship between the two gals and how it shows up in the show transcends toilet humor.  Even if I didn't find it outright funny (which I do), I would watch purely for the sake of the sisterhood these chicks have.   It's empowering for women and heart-warming for humanity.  Transcendent humor, I say!  also noteworthy:  They come out of UCB and have done a very funny internet show for years.  Amy Poehler dug them and then pushed the show (from the internet) to Comedy Central."

I did hear some of the Iliza Shleshinger stand up and thought it was funny, it doesn't feel like she takes herself so seriously. I also thought that girl from portlandia is pretty funny on that show.  I do like ucb, idk about this show though. As a dude, I just didn't find it very funny. I don't really care about sisterhood.  Idk, talking about dilldos and having a dildo on the wall to hang up jewlery is essential toilet humor haha. Same with the almost instant talk about vaginas.  To each his own though!

TimAndEric,3c0318,Phylogenizer,6,Fri Jul 3 21:36:21 2015 UTC,My friend's band played with him years ago and apparently he made a ton of sexist comments and racist comments towards Mexicans.

EDIT:  STANDBY FOR AN EMERGENCY APOLOGY  EDIT 2:    I'm sorry I got carried away and I said things I shouldn't have said, and I deeply apologize for saying wrong things about sex to women.  We men should have more respect for you, and sex should only be for two people that love each other and only with marriage, and I’m so sorry that I derailed and said the wrong things."

Nothing against people who are still fans, he just seems to have some actual problems he really ought to get sorted out, and some musicians who take advantage of that to turn a profit.   There's a reason Tim and Eric cut ties with him, I trust their judgement."
