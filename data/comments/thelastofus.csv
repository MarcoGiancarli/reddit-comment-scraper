thelastofus,3e4aoj,jimmy_man,2,Tue Jul 21 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"As well as the others have said, he wanted to find both the girl and the man that killed all his men, so he let her go to follow her back to Joel."
thelastofus,3e4aoj,Miniduffa,3,Tue Jul 21 21:52:28 2015 UTC,"Did you not pick up on the fact that he was trying to warm up to her? Earn her trust?   He didn't want to kill her. He wanted to convert her onto his side. He didn't try to ""capture"" her, his people tried to kill her, so he stepped in and just took her in so they wouldn't."
thelastofus,3e4aoj,sks442,2,Tue Jul 21 21:11:59 2015 UTC,"I understood he was earning her trust when they fought off the clickers together, but right after she leaves David and co immediately track her down. I guess I'm just confused as to what David intended to do with her while obviously not letting her be killed by his cronies"
thelastofus,3e4aoj,sks442,6,Tue Jul 21 21:19:03 2015 UTC,"I'm just confused as to what David intended to do with her   I made a comment about this a few months ago in a thread about what his motives were:    Once to put the pieces together It's pretty clear David wanted Ellie as some sort of willing sexual slave, or ""Pet"" as that guy Joel tortured put it. He befriended her, ""saved"" her from the others who wanted to kill her, and apparently tried to convince his group that she could be swaded into joining them. When you add it all up you can see that he definitely had some sort of creepy shit in the works.  He's a pretty fucked up guy. But he's smart. He had a plan, and that's why he's so terrifying. He isn't a dumb brute that makes his intentions clear. It's a classic pimp thing. You befriend the vulnerable child/teenager, make them reliant on you, and feel indebted to you. This wouldn't have, and didn't, work on Ellie because she isn't very weak or vulnerable, and that became clear to David eventually which is why he just gave up and decided to kill her"
thelastofus,3e4aoj,TabletTeacher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:40:21 2015 UTC,"She knew her way around a gun, bow, and how to fight clickers. Her knowledge was better than most. He lets her leave because she would lead them to Joel (or more people that know how to use weapons). He wants her ability just as he wants Joel's ability to join their group. Since things didn't go as planned, David looks to eliminate them.   That is how I took his intentions versus Tommy's. Tommy liked the fact Joel knows how to fight but he and Ellie had a focus of family and togetherness. David has the intention of survival and fighting."
thelastofus,3e4aoj,drmehmetoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:52 2015 UTC,"He wanted her to lead him to Joel, as Joel killed a lot of David's group. Presumably to get revenge on him and then capture Ellie anyway to make her his pet."

It says they'll put it up at a ""random time"" on Wednesday. As of now, I'm planning on getting up at midnight and starting a Netflix marathon while I refresh the page every 20 minutes. Is this overkill? Are we talking about a matter of minutes, hours, days? I really want this album."
thelastofus,3dyobk,poorscribbler,7,Mon Jul 20 21:02:38 2015 UTC,"This question came up over on r/vinyl and from MY experience, the vinyl seems to take a bit longer to sell out than the prints they put up. I've only been able to score ONE print that i've wanted, but i have gotten EVERY record that i've gone for. I currently have 3 from Mondo. I'm planning on getting a good nights sleep and logging on as soon as i get to work. I'm on the west coast, and in the past year or so, nothing has gone on sale (to my knowledge) before i'm at work ready to go. I hope i don't get burned this time, because, like you, i'm very excited to get my hands on this one. I've also seen a fair amount of people saying that $75 is a bit too rich for them. Hopefully every true fan will be able to grab one before they're gone. Good luck!"
thelastofus,3dyobk,MegaMuto,2,Mon Jul 20 23:05:40 2015 UTC,Is this the type of record they'll have on hand for a while? Or do you reckon it would be more of a one time offer type of thing?

thelastofus,3dyobk,DiCtAtIoNeR,2,Tue Jul 21 01:43:05 2015 UTC,"Man, it's tough to say. It's hard for me to look at this release objectively since i REALLY want it. I love collecting vinyl and i LOVED this game. This is a must-have for me. But it's $75 plus shipping. That's pretty pricey for a lot of people. I do know that once they're gone, they're gone. I haven't known Mondo to ever re-release anything . . . but they've only been in the vinyl game for a year or two, so who knows. To answer your question, i don't think it will sell out in a matter of minutes, but i'd be surprised if it lasted more than a day or two."
thelastofus,3dyobk,MegaMuto,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:56 2015 UTC,"Awesome, yeah i started collecting vinyl a few years ago and i struggle to find places that release/ sell the good stuff (I'm in Australia) and I absolutely adore this sound track it is honestly one of the reasons why I love Tlou so much.

thelastofus,3dyobk,MegaMuto,2,Mon Jul 20 23:10:00 2015 UTC,"I am an avid Mondo collector of both vinyl and prints so I can give you guys a few pointers. One thing to know is that the guys at Mondo are top notch and will always answer any questions and inquiries. Sometimes it takes a while but they will get back to you. Usually Mondo stuff is a one time deal. Sometimes distributors in other countries will put out a similar vinyl, but this doesn't happen very often. This will be the chance to get it in this shape or form. Mondo has yet to ever repress or reprint something exactly as is. Very rarely (as in the case of the Jurassic Park vinyl,) they will repress things but again this has happened one time. As for how long these will last, one of the guys at Mondo (Mo) said if you pick it up on Friday you should be okay. I would expect maybe even the weekend but its hard to say. They haven't released pressing info but they are pressed and ready to ship so it is finite. Mondo Vinyl editions of 1000 have sold out in minutes as well as sat on the shelves for weeks, but I would expect these to fall under neither category. Shipping will be pricing as these are over 4lbs so for us lucky folks in Canada and elsewhere, expect shipping to be quite high (my guess is around $40-50 USD)! If you guys have any questions about Mondo vinyl or prints feel free to holler! Also, expect these to go up sometime midmorning CST, or Texas time!"

After doing an ""Aww fuck it"" frustration brawl and clearing the level, I was like ""Well that was fun. Lets try it again."" and recorded the next stage of the high school completely ignoring stealth.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVPBgEiPij4  Kind of want to just run & gun(or punch rather) my next Grounded play through."

thelastofus,3dwn4h,EABACA,2,Mon Jul 20 03:42:41 2015 UTC,It's possible to get through that without killing one. I like how the revolver rapes in grounded
thelastofus,3dwn4h,regdent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:55:01 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to know your method. I've done leaving a nail bomb in the generator room so the one that runs at you when you start the generator, then running to the door. I've also done grabbing the keycard, then running to the generator, but there's always one stalker that follows me in there."
thelastofus,3dwn4h,AsITurnBlue,2,Mon Jul 20 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"I saw It on YouTube. I was having trouble as well. As soon as the rats come, turn right. Dont go to the electric door. Go straight up and get the Key card. That spawns the walkers. Once you have it go straight down to the generator. Dont Fuck with any infected. Once generator is done you need to squat down and chill for like 4 sec. This spawns bloater downstairs . after 4 sec haul fuckin ass to the door. Home free. No damage no kills either"
thelastofus,3dwn4h,regdent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:54 2015 UTC,Send me a PM if you need help with any part. I should be able to help.
thelastofus,3dwn4h,AsITurnBlue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:13:37 2015 UTC,"I notice a lot of walkthroughs online where they start with the Key Card, and they always either waste resources, take damage, miss opportunities for kills, or a combination thereof.  I've always found it to be better to spawn the first set of stalkers by attempting to open the Key Card Door.  You'll have a larger area to work in and an escape route if you need it.  But what helps the most is walking a bunch of throwables to whatever area you feel is best.  If you spawn them with the Key Card Door, you can also induce them to attack and retreat for easy grab melees or one-swing melee weapon kills.  Walk some more throwables after you're done and use this spot again for the next wave.  If you decide to run for the exit, it may help to wait a few seconds for the Bloater to drop down before heading upstairs... Taking care of the Bloater will allow for a Bomb to drop..  The only other one you'll get in G Mode (as Joel).  But if you don't plan on revisiting it, then no worries.  Feel good about yourself for getting by one of the tougher stages in the game!     For any of the stages where you have trouble, it helps to learn the spawn triggers and enemy behavior...  Hang in there and don't be discouraged.  Come to this sub for help!  Take care, GL, endure and survive...  And have fun!  TP"
thelastofus,3dst9v,ThumbPower,5,Sun Jul 19 02:56:12 2015 UTC,ive finished the game on all difficulties... I had no idea that was there in the first place.
thelastofus,3dst9v,balamory,5,Sun Jul 19 15:08:02 2015 UTC,"One thing I like doing is checking the game for cutoffs and ""backtrack blockers"".  While replaying the Hydro Dam chapter, I found another El Diablo!  If you restart/reload when you get to the flow control thingy, you can still go all the way back and pick up another El D bullet!  Note that not all Load Game checkpoints will be Restart Encounter ckpts... It's always better to reload from the same slot than to Restart Encounter.  This exploit might not mean much, but every bit counts!  In addition to this, there's also a double rifle at the Boston Capitol...  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JIE1EN8yrwQ  TP     Edit: Wow!  There are a lot more checkpoints than I thought!  It's possible to exploit this for 4 more pickups (can get to max capacity in lower modes)!  Here are the Load Game checkpoints up to the reunion cutscene:   base of river before climbing the rocks that lead to the comic. at the flow control spin thingy. just before giving Ellie a high 5. at the top of the last set of stairs / top of the teddy bear cliffs; before you need to crouch-walk below a log."

thelastofus,3dwrru,BeatPeet,2,Mon Jul 20 11:06:43 2015 UTC,I agree but smal ishue with your game theory is Ellie is Catgirl. It dosen matter who killed hospital because Joe was fought for Ish and not Ellie. Reasun u car not spell Ellie without lie so all hope was lost anyway. But Ish wa sdifferet Ish made a diary and died. Lie just got carried. U think that Batjoe killed Marlene for Lie but ur rong because Mariley died in Left Bhind dlc that was revealed so Riley was never there because she died in Left Bhind she was never at the hospital. Joe was hallucating thats y he's crazy so ur right about that. Hospital di not di serve di pain but Ish killed hospital not Joe...sothats why we play as Joe becuase Joe fight for Ish.  Good theory bu t u missed a lot of impotent stuff. Sorry for my bad German I used Bing Translate. Thanks.
