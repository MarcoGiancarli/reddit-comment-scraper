blackops2,3e0loj,Housekoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:04:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth getting, still one of the top CoD in my opinion. I haven't ran into any hackers in a while. I wish I could say the same for BO1 though, I really miss that game."
blackops2,3e0loj,sushiondeck,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:26:58 2015 UTC,Bo2 is the reason my PS3 blew up and was unrepairable. It's also the only reason I bought another one. Best FPS there is. Getting all weapons gold was a blast and taught me a lot about each weapon and how to use them effectively and on which maps and game modes they work best on. Still working on getting all the calling cards.

blackops2,3don67,The-Invalid-One,3,Sat Jul 18 00:00:18 2015 UTC,restart the game
blackops2,3don67,captainrotmg,3,Sat Jul 18 00:21:59 2015 UTC,Corrupted game files if you're using PC or a scratched disc if you are on console. Clean the disc or if you are on PC verify game integrity through steam.
blackops2,3dljp7,JimboDaCopKilla,6,Fri Jul 17 06:34:07 2015 UTC,"Ballista everyday of the week. DSR takes to long to rebolt. Now pre-patch DSR on the other hand...that thing was so fucking good, honestly not even upset it got patched."
blackops2,3dljp7,abobrowski,4,Fri Jul 17 12:35:46 2015 UTC,"Their both good, no hate for either, they both have their moments where they are better in certain situations, certain maps, against certain enemy teams"
blackops2,3dljp7,KillerzRQuiet71,4,Fri Jul 17 07:38:38 2015 UTC,"DSR for playing picks in SnD, Ballista for fun, XPR for everything else. Seriously, its a semi-auto Ballista with low recoil, can't go wrong."
blackops2,3dljp7,fatcIemenza,7,Fri Jul 17 14:16:36 2015 UTC,The recoil on the XPR is huge
blackops2,3dljp7,SingWithTheWolf,3,Fri Jul 17 19:12:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I always just end up spraying with the xpr because the recoil is so bad.
blackops2,3dljp7,abobrowski,2,Fri Jul 17 20:12:42 2015 UTC,Yet still low enough to put out follow-up shots faster than the bolt rifles.
blackops2,3dljp7,fatcIemenza,0,Sat Jul 18 00:04:22 2015 UTC,... As it's supposed to
blackops2,3dljp7,SingWithTheWolf,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:05:21 2015 UTC,"Haha right, we call it a double shot lol, but the clip ends up looking gross if you spray so."
blackops2,3dljp7,abobrowski,3,Sat Jul 18 00:50:00 2015 UTC,They're both godly in the right hands.
blackops2,3dljp7,PhilHolz,-5,Fri Jul 17 20:41:43 2015 UTC,Pamaj's hands*
blackops2,3dljp7,abobrowski,2,Fri Jul 17 21:22:31 2015 UTC,I prefer the DSR despite the fact it's a slow behemoth. I like the default scope and I can control it better than any other sniper rifle. Being the big 50 cal monster helps too... :p
blackops2,3dljp7,Beowulf891,2,Fri Jul 17 16:17:29 2015 UTC,I like the Ballista for the faster ADS speed and less sway. It's a bit better for aggressive sniping in my experience
blackops2,3dljp7,Maschinengewehr,2,Fri Jul 17 16:31:27 2015 UTC,"DSR, by far. Higher damage and I don't need the cpu."
blackops2,3dljp7,l0_0I,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:48:23 2015 UTC,I play with the Dsr mainly slower but alot more destructive maybe just for me but I have better accuracy with it besides the slower bolt time it's great
blackops2,3dljp7,GINGERtheKAT,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"They're both good and both feel great and smooth. I switch out between them all the time, but I'd have to go with the Ballista for a higher mag size, faster ads, and faster movement speed."
blackops2,3dljp7,DankMemeDepot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:35:50 2015 UTC,"At first I didn't use the ballista, the slowness of the DSR actually helped me when I first picked up a sniper rifle but now I have to use the ballista, the DSR is nice for not getting hit markers but it's too slow"

blackops2,3dk4q8,ItsPratty,4,Thu Jul 16 22:34:44 2015 UTC,"Hey there.   Sorry to hear you're having this issue. Are you using a disc or digital copy of the title?   Can you please try the following:  Delete the title from your console and clear your cache. Install a small demo or free content onto your HD. Then reinstall Black Ops 2. Let us know if your still seeing the same issue.   Thanks,  KJ"
blackops2,3dk4q8,ATVIAssist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:37:03 2015 UTC,I'm using the disc version of it. And there is no scratches on it.
blackops2,3dk4q8,ATVIAssist,3,Fri Jul 17 01:38:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for letting us know.  We suggest trying the disc in another console and check the results. However, If the console is not reading the disc properly then it is possible that you would need a console repair.   Try a friends console and let us know.  Thanks,  KJ"
blackops2,3dk4q8,ATVIAssist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:59:50 2015 UTC,I tried my friends Xbox 360 and his worked fine. If it's a console repair what inside of the Xbox would need repairing and how much would it usually cost?
blackops2,3dk4q8,PhilHolz,2,Fri Jul 17 04:19:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry but we wouldn't have any information or details on repairs to your console.   You would need to contact Xbox for more information.   Thanks,  KJ"
blackops2,3dk4q8,ChallengeFreakinOwne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:58:29 2015 UTC,"See if you can install BO2 to your hard drive.  If you can, then you only need the disk for the xbox to verify that it's a legitimate copy, then it'll run digitally.  SO if there is something wrong with your disk it gets around that."
blackops2,3dlobj,CreationandControl,9,Fri Jul 17 07:33:14 2015 UTC,I don't think you should be admitting that your (likely) 870 is getting outgunned by anything with how easy the 870 is to use

Just keep your distance, try to dodge, jump, drop shot out of the way and you should be ok.  Trust me, when BO2 was the actual release game SOOOOO many people bitched about this and nothing was done, so it's not going to happen on a 3 year old game."
