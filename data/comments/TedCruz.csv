This decision established the Federal Government's primacy in immigration enforcement even as it allowed Obama to disregard state laws which he does not like.  As illegal immigration is prima facie crime against the Federal government, sanctuary cities fly in direct disregard of this primacy.  Also, Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution allows the Congress -- not individual cities - to set ""uniform rules for Naturalization"".  Sanctuary cities, due to the primacy of the Federal Government established in Arizona and by Article I Section 8, have no legal authority to disregard immigration law as passed by the Congress."

TedCruz,33elto,MiG_Pilot_87,0,Wed Apr 22 01:19:34 2015 UTC,"Republicans historically were a ""3 leg stool"" of competing interests:   Fiscal (low taxes, low regulation, balanced budget, free trade, competition, and capitalism). National Defense/security (strong military, proactive state policy, strong police). Religious (Judo-Christian Morals (or at least Ethics), Pro-Life, Pro established social structures (i.e. family, church), and anti-drug.   Since Regan, and especially since the rise of the Tea-party in 2009-10, more and more we have 4 legs:   Libertarian (individual liberty, Laissez-faire economic policy, minimalistic government, non-interventionism)   Although, this fourth leg is not really that new.  The anti-slavery movement during the 19th century was absolutely a libertarian movement.   Of those 4 legs, only 2 are really in favor of small government (Although, all are in favor of focused constitutional government).  Religious and defense wings most definitely favor a more active role of the federal government (and you might argue that fiscal does as well, but I think on balance it is pro-small.)  I honestly believe that marriage should remain traditional (1 man and 1 woman) - thus I do fall more into the religious wing of the party.  However, I recognize the fact that libertarians are logically consistent with the approach that as long as it doesn't harm someone else, then it should be legal.     On many issues, I strongly agree with that point of view in fact.  Unfortunately, it is a fact of life that the religious and libertarian legs are on opposite sides of the stool when it comes to some areas of personal freedom.   Drugs and Marriage are the 2 most obvious.    Ted Cruz's comments in this article are actually spot-on in my opinion as he is calling for the religious to pray to preserve what is historically good for society and families.  His bill to leave the decision to the states is in my opinion the best, most logical way to rectify the situation for both wings of the party."
TedCruz,33elto,sirel,0,Wed Apr 22 17:40:35 2015 UTC,That wouldn't be equality under the law across different states.   This is copping out.
TedCruz,33elto,VegaThePunisher,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:14:03 2015 UTC,"Laws do not follow people when they cross state borders.  A great example of this is concealed carry laws vary quite extensively between states.   Every state has equal right to bare arms, but states have leeway in the licensing of concealed weapons varies greatly, see Gun Laws by State.  Since the inferred right of marriage is certainly no more of a right than the right to bear arms which is explicitly stated in the 2nd amendment, certainly it is obvious that a similar situation occurs with the issuance and recognition of a marriage license.   The 14th amendment requires laws be applied equally within a jurisdiction not equality of laws between jurisdiction.  Marriage is not a power reserved by the federal government in the constitution.    Thus, allowing gay marriage to be left to the states creates a nearly identical situation where what is legal and recognized in one state remains legal and recognized in that state.  However, when residing or traveling to a state that does not recognize the same definition of marriage then the local laws take precedence.  That does not mean that a gay couple from Washington visiting Texas would cease to be married Washington.  However, it does mean that while in Texas that the marriage would not be recognized.    The only way the 14th amendment (equality) comes into play is if you assume that the 16th amendment (income tax) grants Congress the power to provide tax breaks to those filing married.  Although I am highly skeptical it does, the language is easily addressable by specifically stating ""married as defined by the state of residence in year xxxx"".   edit minor typos"

Then he makes the remark I quoted above as if Uber and Lyft are strictly better for consumers than city taxis without even attempting to illustrate his analogy. His entire argument in that piece regarding net neutrality can be boiled down to Obamacare is bad, Obamacare is government, government is bad, net neutrality is government, net neutrality is bad. The fact that he accepts lobbyist money from Comcast does create a conflict of interests for him which warrants a discerning eye at any position he takes regarding internet policies that have financial impact on Comcast."
TedCruz,2njcmv,thatguybane,0,Thu Dec 4 03:52:39 2014 UTC,"Cruz is a politician, he uses shortcuts to get people to agree with him. Obamacare=Net Neutrality is certainly not a perfect analogy but the basis of comparison is what you point to: government regulation.  Regulation has a history of stifling innovation, locking in monopolies and, maybe worst of all, regulatory capture (a regulatory regime essentially run for the benefit of the regulated and the detriment of the public). That's why I am extremely wary of what is being proposed to ensure Net Neutrality, imposition of Title II."
TedCruz,2njcmv,Dunebridge,0,Thu Dec 4 21:05:40 2014 UTC,Inman pretty much made an ass of himself here.  His humor is typically spot on too.

TedCruz,2jw46q,thebrightsideoflife,1 point,Tue Oct 21 14:43:05 2014 UTC,"The freshman Texas senator predicted that longtime Republican attorney Ben Ginsberg would serve as his campaign lawyer should Mr. Cruz run for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.   Ginsberg is the guy at the center of the massive power grab at the 2012 GOP convention by the establishment.  It removed power from the state, district, and county level of the Republican party and centralized that power into the RNC.  The power grab was orchestrated by the Rockefeller Republicans - the moderates who got McCain and Romney on the ticket in '08 and '12.  How did that work out for the Republican party?  This is who Ted Cruz will be working for."

TedCruz,2gmcs3,PoliticalModerate,1 point,Wed Sep 17 02:00:02 2014 UTC,Muslims hate Jews is some sort of revelation? Really? Don't you mean Middle East Christians hate Jews? Who knew? It seems hatred in the middle east comes with the territory.
TedCruz,2gmcs3,BrutalTruth101,1 point,Wed Sep 17 07:54:52 2014 UTC,I was just criticizing the ambiguous sentence construction. I don't know anything about their relations with Muslims.
TedCruz,2gmcs3,BrutalTruth101,1 point,Wed Sep 17 21:53:51 2014 UTC,Fear is the main reason and I don't think it's an issue to be lightly brushed aside.
TedCruz,2gbkl7,caferrell,2,Sat Sep 13 21:51:07 2014 UTC,"The waste is spread pretty evenly around.  There's so much of it, it's probably best to handle it like any big problem.  Break it into little pieces and go after it that way."
TedCruz,2ba9ln,literlife,3,Mon Jul 21 10:40:28 2014 UTC,"exactly! no taxes no fees, just freedom!  just ask gov. brownback of kansas what a good idea this would be and how much liberty we could have if we just leave everything up to the market economy."
TedCruz,2ba9ln,mishaco,2,Mon Jul 21 23:09:55 2014 UTC,"no taxes, no fees and somehow these 110,000 employees will guard the border... for free?"
TedCruz,2ba9ln,bluefootedpig,4,Thu Jul 31 21:48:43 2014 UTC,Genius! What a brilliant idea! I'm so glad this man is going to run for President. He represents every single thing a true American should be. He hates gays and brown people and Muslims and women. Those are all of the things that I hate too!! #CRUZIN'  TED CRUZ FOR PRESIDENT 2016!!!

TedCruz,28vm9i,jcm267,0,Mon Jun 23 15:20:24 2014 UTC,a great article! Ted Cruz apparently is an brilliant guy.
TedCruz,28vm9i,simplemagico,0,Wed Jun 25 02:55:59 2014 UTC,"He really is brilliant. And he terrifies the left. The article pretty much described him as ""Sarah Palin with brains"" which made me laugh. This man is a once in a generation political talent for the right-wing. James Carville admits to it. Most on the other side don't, even if they still admit that he's always the ""smartest guy in the room"".   The next Republican nomination will likely come down to between Cruz and some more moderate guy, perhaps Jeb Bush."
TedCruz,28vm9i,simplemagico,1 point,Wed Jun 25 03:40:26 2014 UTC,"The article didn't elaborate, which is fine coz it's about profiling Ted Cruz. But how exactly in the history federalists have failed applying the constitution literally?"

TedCruz,251zuw,Clatsop,1 point,Thu May 8 17:06:59 2014 UTC,"After trying two different schools local to here, I ended up Home Schooling. It goes beyond ""choice"" and right to what is being taught..  Here is a question on a Health Class test given to my son in 4th Grade.  If you need to make an important decision do you:  A. Ask your friends for advice  B. Make the choice your self  C. Ask your Parents for advice  D: Use the Guidelines for Responsible Decision Making Book  When my son choose C, he was told that he was wrong and only choice D was correct. I asked to see that book and was refused. I was also told that the book taught children to NOT make mistakes and by doing that, de-stressed the child's life.. My sons were pulled there and then."
TedCruz,2515jp,Clatsop,0,Thu May 8 10:46:30 2014 UTC,I think the GOP field is very strong.  I wouldn't mind seeing a Walker/Cruz ticket.  Nothing against Ted Cruz but I put Scott Walker at the top because he has been in an executive position and accomplished real and difficult gains in Wisconsin.
