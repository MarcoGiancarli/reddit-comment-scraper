Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,tiggr,12,Tue Jul 21 21:57:39 2015 UTC,thank you guess they do listen
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,xts-kingbeef,8,Tue Jul 21 22:06:27 2015 UTC,Awesome Ill be looking forward to this.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,1stMora,6,Tue Jul 21 22:07:58 2015 UTC,well I'll look a head to test this :)
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Girtablulu,4,Tue Jul 21 22:02:22 2015 UTC,"So, if i understand correctly, the turret can now turn at faster rate but can't turn faster than the threshold you decide.  And if you change the vehicle sensitivity slider, you will be able to change this threshold from a minimum to a maximum you decide? Or the slider just change the acceleration of the turret?  I don't get what this change means. Is the turret will be able to do twitch movement now?  Also, is it possible to have the value for the turning speed in Degree per second? It's easier for us to compare and give you feedback."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,S3blapin,2,Tue Jul 21 22:43:18 2015 UTC,yes its just going to be a min-max system because the current set up where slower is fast will not work
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,xts-kingbeef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"okay.  I can live with a min max system. it's allow players to more easily tune the turret speed. And it prevent the insane turning speed we could see in retail. If the max turning speed is something like 1,5 second for a 360, it would be okay (this means that infantry still have chance).  What i don't understand is how this speed will be tuned. With the sensitivity slider? If it's the case, everybody will use the maximum possible to allow them to turn fast and just reduce their mouse senistivity to keep the accuracy on small movement... And i don't think it's a good idea. (if it's the case)  But i really don't know how they could solves this with a system like that. Only a warthunder style system could solve this. I know you don't like it, but it's the best way to make th turret effective and not OP."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,S3blapin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:56:11 2015 UTC,"if it still works as it does now it just help to get quicker to the max speed and the difference is in the ms, will be interesting to see the difference with the new system"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Girtablulu,2,Tue Jul 21 23:08:43 2015 UTC,okay. we will see when the patch will hit the server
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,S3blapin,4,Tue Jul 21 23:15:23 2015 UTC,"Well that was an unexpected. As a hardcore tank driver, as long as the turrets are working fine in 60/120hz servers, I personally don't really mind the change. Whatever works I guess"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,TheLankySoldier,2,Tue Jul 21 22:02:04 2015 UTC,do you even tank brah?
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,xts-kingbeef,5,Tue Jul 21 22:09:24 2015 UTC,What's a tank?
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,TheLankySoldier,3,Tue Jul 21 22:11:40 2015 UTC,something that shits on infantry players :)
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,xts-kingbeef,6,Tue Jul 21 22:13:44 2015 UTC,Sounds like an asshole bird

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,NixNB,2,Tue Jul 21 22:20:02 2015 UTC,"Ah btw tiggr could have a look into the zoom turning speed? it's why to slow right now! with the turret system we have at the moment the difference is about 3 sec in CTE, in retail about  1 sec from non-zoom to zoom"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Girtablulu,3,Tue Jul 21 22:25:53 2015 UTC,If that is true then thank you! I'm eagerly waiting to see it in action.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Smaisteri,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:11 2015 UTC,I hope you guys did it right.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,yolotryhard,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for listening to player feedback on this one.  Looking forward to testing it out tomorrow.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,fanny_bandito,2,Tue Jul 21 23:19:55 2015 UTC,Could you tell us what DPI you used to test?
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,TheDeadRed,5,Tue Jul 21 22:06:35 2015 UTC,"We tested with the most generic crap setup available (sadly that's what most players are on), without tweaking the vehicle sens in game (like most players wont). Making that feel good.  Then we made sure that maxing out the sensitivity and moving around didn't allow crazy speeds, but still fast ones.  The real test will be when we unleash this change on the CTE for you so we can get your feedback - but I also tested it with my deathadder mouse here running at max polling rates (cant remember what they are), and some fiddling with filters and it feels really good to me."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,TheDeadRed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:22 2015 UTC,"IIRC max DPI with the Deathadder was 5600 when I had it and 1000 for polling. I run 800 DPI with 25% ingame sensitivity for vehicles in retail, so I'm hoping this will be much less intrusive.  Slightly still on topic, but yesterday you made a post saying that you had considered increasing the damage of tank shells. Could you explain this? I'm assuming that since you've all made the choice to increase the threshold that that idea is off the table though."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,TheDeadRed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:36:03 2015 UTC,RE: tank shells - an example for the future (what limiting turret max speeds can unlock). It's a pet peeve of mine that tank shells are so crappy vs infantry (and they have to be to not make tanks super OP in current turret setup of course).
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,1Bryce1,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:07:52 2015 UTC,"So you meant to just increase splash damage? Do you feel this is an issue with all shells or just SABOT and HE? I only use AP and to be honest I feel the splash is sufficient, and if it was increased for SABOT and HE then it would render the AP kind of moot. That is, unless AP's splash was increased further to balance it, in which case I'd honestly say that might move it into the territory of overpowered. Although I guess this is all theoretical if the threshold is being increased."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Xuvial,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:28:21 2015 UTC,Now if only CTE would show back up in Origin I could test it on my crap system. :(
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Girtablulu,2,Tue Jul 21 22:47:18 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they use standard 800 DPI on a 1080p monitor with Windows mouse sensitivity at default.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,TheDeadRed,3,Tue Jul 21 22:18:30 2015 UTC,Of course we tested that first :)
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,xts-kingbeef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:31 2015 UTC,why 800 DPI? I think most gamer do have a gaming mouse with higher DPI but would be interesting which which values they are testing
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Girtablulu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:43 2015 UTC,Most players from what I can tell run at less than 1000. I can't think of very many that run higher.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,S3blapin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:25:22 2015 UTC,I run 800dpi with 29% in vehicle and yes most guys do not fun super high just makes aiming to hard
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Fiiyasko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:12 2015 UTC,I have always 5600
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Girtablulu,0,Tue Jul 21 22:28:39 2015 UTC,O_o I use 425 dpi...
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,stickbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:54 2015 UTC,"Unless your one of those ""Ermhgrd must have insanely high sensitivity"" players, you should try reducing the DPI in half and doubling the in-game sensitivity (For the love of PC gaming you'd better have your windows mouse sensitivity at 6/10 aka default aka 1:1)  Alot of people's hands are less accurate than they think and often make their accurate shot a miss from over-aiming because of an ittybittyteenytiny movement on the mouse.  fwiw, i'm techically a low sensitivity player, I use 1000 DPI and ~17% ingame, a ~35° movement with my mouse makes my soldier do a 180°, I used to try and use my mouse at >4k DPI, but It felt too sensitive and I would consistently overaim and overcompensate, the further I reduced my sensitivity the more accurate I became, arguably you could say that I should've just reduced my ingame sensitivity for simmilar results, but that messed with my muscle memory for my desktop and my clicking became inaccurate on Everything"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,LaiLaiHei,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:09:28 2015 UTC,"piu you ask me something I have this mouse a few years (6 years), but could be about right when I was a bit younger and thought in this way :D never really tried any other DPIs out and I'm used to play with this.  It depends on your playstlye if you are more a distance player, yes a lower sensitivity is better but if you are a close player a higher sensitivity is better. But meh I stop putting my time into figuring out what's the best sens I just wanna play and have some fun nothing competitive"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,1stMora,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:28:00 2015 UTC,"I use a very low sens so I like the maxed options normally. This time we tested on both my mouse and a crappy ""regular"" dell mouse on a no special driver system."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,BleedingUranium,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:08:50 2015 UTC,Mother of God. 800 is kinda the defacto standard for fps gaming. 400 is the runner up. I personally run 800 15%.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,xts-kingbeef,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:40:05 2015 UTC,I've ran 1800 on my Deathadder since BF3
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,BleedingUranium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:54:57 2015 UTC,Yeah 800 seems very low to me. Personally I use 1650DPI at 1000hz polling rate. And leave every sensitivity to default. Or at 20%. I think  that's default anyway. (steelseries rival)
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,xts-kingbeef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:16:00 2015 UTC,"800 is the ""standard"" test I guess. Or whatever DPI a regular crappy mouse turns out into."

We're all going to get the changes in the end.  Edit: Why would someone downvote every single post here, on both sides of this? :|"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Xuvial,6,Tue Jul 21 22:04:28 2015 UTC,other than this is more for pc guys I have no clue  I got down voted to
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,LaiLaiHei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:16:56 2015 UTC,"It does affect PC more, but I believe the idea is to make it the same on both, and even the current, highly complained about version is faster than ours, so it's very relevant."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,GunSizeMatter,2,Tue Jul 21 22:19:17 2015 UTC,well I'm sorry but pc has twice the pace as console and the way the turrets are currently would not work very well. to get a penalty for moving my mouse to fast isent right and a bit silly
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4hae,Fiiyasko,5,Tue Jul 21 22:22:19 2015 UTC,This chang should not affect console (really gamepad input) at all. the limitations are in the speed of the turret then (you can't go above max LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN on a controller like you can with a mouse). But we will be testing this on the xbox one CTE as well of course!
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4pll,M60E6,3,Tue Jul 21 22:59:11 2015 UTC,So beautiful. I'll probably spam them just to watch this.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4pll,BleedingUranium,2,Tue Jul 21 23:00:47 2015 UTC,"I know they buffed them in CTE, though not to this extent. Just curious if it'll actually make it since it was so close to the spring patch last time."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4pll,Zergonaplate,3,Tue Jul 21 23:12:16 2015 UTC,"They should be. Although, IIRC, they didn't actually receive any buff, it's just the visual/sound effect that has been changed."

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4pll,xXDoomerXx,2,Tue Jul 21 23:18:36 2015 UTC,Ahahha nice trick with IED   I wish they look like that in retail
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4pll,1Bryce1,2,Wed Jul 22 00:21:28 2015 UTC,JDAM does need a buff because this weapon takes massive skill to use.

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4oik,Elementofprgress,3,Tue Jul 21 22:50:50 2015 UTC,/u/maars_dicela could you clarify this? Thank you :)
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4oik,Girtablulu,2,Tue Jul 21 23:13:06 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the update to tracers went in before our summer break. It included:     Reduce tracer frequency to one every third round on automatic weapons. DMRs, snipers, pistols and shotguns should remain one tracer per bullet Reduced brightness of tracer tails. They're still there, just harder to see.    Changes were due to feedback here and to reduce the appearance of certain bugs in the system. I'm still not completely happy with how they look, but /u/jjju has been tied up with high tick rate this whole patch cycle. /-: Bugs that still persist:   Tracers get super wide at low frame rates (read: 360/PS3) Tracers spawn near/behind soldier's shoulder in 1P Tracers spawn near/behind soldier's head in 3P Tracers sometimes streak back towards [0,0,0] when reaching the end of their lifetimes   I am hoping we can get the bugs ironed out of HTR so we can get some movement here in time for Fall Patch. That said, if you feel we're reduced the brightness of the  tails, I'm open to tuning them back up a little."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4oik,Maars_DICELA,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:36:55 2015 UTC,"Please No, leave them down. And feel free to tune them down even more, I would say 0 is ideal. :) is the tracer setup per bullet so you can have them on some and not others? I always have to laugh when i see a shotgun blast shoot up in the air like fireworks."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4oik,1Bryce1,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:19:37 2015 UTC,The tracers are fine how they are. They don't need to be made more visible and then us run into the same problem we had with the Spring Patch.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e4oik,xXDoomerXx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:40:21 2015 UTC,I don't like the new tracer effects. Feels even weirder than before.   I don't mind the tracers themselves but it affects the amount of those ''glowing bullets'' that you see when the bullets have traveled some distance. I liked the old system where you could see every bullet you fired against a darker background.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,batchick93,17,Tue Jul 21 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"Support just kinda seems like a mixed bag of shit they didn't know where to put or how to make work thrown onto a class, ammo and LMG aside.    LMG is fine.  ammo is mostly fine, though the small ammo bags really seem like a downgrade. The grenade resupply times from it are flat out broken though. Between the long waits (with no timer) that you have to sit on this damn box for, and the box vanishing, resupplying other ammo, or walking away too far restarting the timer makes for one hell of a shitty functionality. Cut at least 30% of the resupply time of grenades from the ammo boxes, untie the delay from a single ammo box on a single resupply queue, start the timer from when a grenade is thrown, and maybe add a progress bar/timer by the grenade ammo icon.  claymore and C4 are fine, though the doubling with recon is weird. Class role seems very confused.  XM-25 seems like it's on the wrong class. Screams assault given grenade launchers are its thing. Not to mention, being on the ammo class meant it had to get needed into oblivion. This thing needs a faster resupply and/or more ammo to be of any use, maybe offset this with some projectile drop. Smoke is pointless, needs to be much thicker.  MP-APS is not useful enough at what it does do, doesn't detonate grenades or LVG like it needs to, and doesn't give any reward for using it. Also, odd role given the rest other than ammo are explosives. Random gadget throw on the class of random stuff without a home.  mortar seems fine in concept, but the click on a map and shoot implementation is really dull and quite cheap. Should have been line of sight like BC games. But since it's here to stay, it was fine pre-nerf, now like grenades it's just another frustrating timer with no explanation that may as well be called a bug rather than a feature. Timer at beginning of round is fine and the length is fine, but it needs an indicator. The thing has a blank screen, why not put the timer there? Timer on mid round spawn is quite unjustified and should go. What's next, you can't use an RPG or revive paddles for a minute after your spawn to ""balance"" them? Yes, that sounds ridiculous and like a bad idea because it is one, for anything. Good way to encourage people to sit around doing nothing and camp. The timer resetting when you move the damn thing? Now that's just a slap across the face for anyone trying to use it, terrible design.  UCAV was just kinda a bad idea to start with. Stretching for random ideas that may not work that well, and throw it on support because why not. Since it here though, it really shouldn't give a burst artery trying to use it. More random unexplained timer that people probably think are a bug. Prevent it from use at the start of the round and when redeploying or using a commander crate with a timer, fix the exploits directly. Not just piss of anyone trying to use it. And when a timer is restricting it, give an indication so people know that the hell is going on.  riot shield. Why? Another random idea just thrown on support. And since they did it anyways, as you said, how about making it actually stop some damage?  the field upgrades. WTF? More ammo capacity on a class role that is supposed to carry more bags of unlimited ammo? A top level spec boosting a single gadget that isn't the class's main role, is highly specialized in where it can be used, and is probably the least popular gadget in the game? Boost to three separate gadgets in the same path when you can only carry two?  Redo them. These are the worst field upgrades in the game."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,Crack-The-Skye,6,Tue Jul 21 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"I see where you're getting at here, a lot of the gadgets for this class are either useless or just misplaced or misused.  But my one gripe are 2 items - the MPAPS needs some sort of buff and point system & the riot shield needs to actually be effective and carried on the back."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,JamieNoonZ,4,Tue Jul 21 20:24:32 2015 UTC,The shield pretty much needs to just be replaced with the one in Hardline. It feels like ours was a test on how NOT to make it in Hardline.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,BleedingUranium,5,Tue Jul 21 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"claymore and C4 are fine, though the doubling with recon is weird. Class role seems very confused.    Indeed. You know why? Back in the Alpha Support had Claymores and Recon had C4. That makes sense, and it's how they should have stayed. However, parts of the fanbase raged hard, and DICE Stockholm gave Support C4 again (and Claymores to Recon to even it out).  And thus, we were given one of the worst imbalances in the game, and this is also why the Support C4 and Recon Claymores had issues counting toward Assignments.      XM-25 seems like it's on the wrong class.   Nope, it's indirect fire like the Mortar and UCAV. If you're trying to use it like an M320 or M32 MGL, you're going to have problems."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,Crack-The-Skye,4,Tue Jul 21 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"Ya, it's quite obvious the swapping was a late addition. c4 has way more linking to recon/sniper than it does support, i guess it was BF3 joined fans raging.   Except it has the exact same role as M320. You don't fire an M320 at a guy in the open standing in front of you (unless you have to), at that point you'd have killed him with you AR way before you pulled it out. Both are for grouped enemies, enemies in cover, enemies around corners, shooting down, and annoyance to vehicles, the functional differences are rather minor. The XM-25 (well airburst) has already existed in the series, and it was for assault and it worked there. And just look at the alternative ammo types. Long distance smoke? M320 has it and assault has had it with a GL in previous games, and the XM-25 has it. Shotgun rounds for a back-up shotgun? Something assault has with the M320 (and M26), and something the XM-25 has. It's an assault gadget through and through, and the only reason it got horribly nerfed is because it does not mesh with the ammo class."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,Jais9,4,Tue Jul 21 20:49:38 2015 UTC,"Indirect fire and defensive gadgets make plenty of sense on the support class. Your job is to support others by protecting when on the defensive, working as anti-cover artillery on the offensive, and providing ammo no matter where you go.  It's the implementation of those gadgets that absolutely suck.   Ballistic shield: as mentioned, would work fine if it weren't for the fact that it doesn't do its primary job properly (that is, protecting you and others). It's not a gadget for all maps, but it definately has a role on Metro and Pearl Market (provided it gets an overhaul). XM25: again, a good concept and actually a pretty well-balanced gadget if it weren't for the botched resupply time. MP-APS: A great concept, but it needs to have a fixed shield to block normal bullets, otherwise you're just fodder for a coaxial machine gun. Also, block grenades and give points when destroying explosives. XM25 Smoke: It's very fitting that the support class can lay down smoke from a distance, but this gadget is so pathetic I have no idea why they even thought it deserved to be in the game, instead of just giving smoke shells to the mortar."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,Crack-The-Skye,3,Tue Jul 21 20:31:13 2015 UTC,"They do, but that's not how things work out.  The XM-25, call it indirect fire or whatever, is an assault gadget with near the same role as M320, shooting rooftop snipers aside. Riot is an offensive gadget. You move up and attack things, assault would have been a better fit, not that it fits any in BF4 really. Support isn't a bad choice though, it also works, but the gadget concept in general doesn't. Scraping for DLC ideas, and throwing it on the mixed bag class. MP-APS works for support in theory, you are ""supporting"" the team. The gadget isn't really well throughout though and ends up another another random piece thrown on support."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,Jais9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:09 2015 UTC,"The XM-25, call it indirect fire or whatever, is an assault gadget with near the same role as M320, shooting rooftop snipers aside.   It doesn't have the same role, and they don't work the same way. The M320 is used on the move, whereas the XM25 requires careful planning, is more accurate, has greater range and a slower time to kill. It's like saying the RPG works the same way as the M320 and therefore it belongs on the Assault class.  The XM25 Smoke has greater range and is more precise than the M320 variant, but again, requires that the user exposes himself for longer (with the M320 you just peek a corner and pop a quick smoke - perfect for the mobile assault class). The XM Smoke could be a decent gadget if you could blanket an area with smoke that actually lasted a while, but as it is it's useless. I agree the XM25 Dart variant doesn't belong on the support class, and I have no idea why they even added it to the game.  The riot shield could work on the assault class, I admit, but it's primarily a defensive gadget where the assault's job is pure offense and infantry killing. For this reason, it works better on the teamwork-oriented support class. I disagree that it's about moving up and bashing people, it's more about safely pushing a lane while your team mates advance behind you."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,BleedingUranium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"Right, the XM25 is like a Mortar/UCAV rifle, and the Shield is like an infantry-oriented MP-APS."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,Crack-The-Skye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:58:56 2015 UTC,"It has the exact same role, just the M320 has more damage and the XM-25 has more range. It's to kill infantry in scenarios where a grenade launcher works better than your gun, behind cover, around doors, shooting down from above, grouped enemies, etc. Your analogy is terrible, the RPG kills vehicles, neither grenade launcher is good at that. A correct analogy would be the MBT LAW, RPG, and Javelin all have the same role, but with slight variations, so belong on the same class. The same goes for the grenade launchers, they belong on a single class.  Once again, same point about the smoke. Same role, slight variation. The M320 smoke and XM-25 smoke (if it worked) do the same job. Though smoke doesn't have an issue being on multiple classes. The XM-25 dart much an assault weapon as the airburst is.   Anyways, forget assault or not, let's ignore which class it should be on. Lets just look at support, the class it should not be on regardless of where it should be. Grenade launcher (who cares how it functions specifically, it's a grenade launcher) meets unlimited ammo. There's an issue, this is not the class for it. It's why the thing had to be nerfed into the ground. (Also why C4 should have stayed a recon thing)   The shield is offensive, not defensive. Not whether it kills or not, whether you use it to defend or attack. A flashbang or smoke would be other example of a good offensive tool that doesn't kill. A claymore is a tool that kills but is defensive. It has nothing to do with whether it kills or not. The shield is meant to assault things, not stay back and defend or cover from behind.    team-work oriented support class    Good one."

But I agree with every point you've made here. Class roles in BF4 are really all over the place with no clear focus on what they should be doing."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,Pronato,2,Tue Jul 21 20:21:26 2015 UTC,"Personally i don't think the shield belong in the game period. Assault would seem like a better candidate though, given the are supposed to move in and assault things while support is a little more geared to sitting back.   Engineer is about the only to the point class, and also the most used and most effective. Assault has two clear roles, which it seems fine at doing both. Recon is a little off, and support is all over the place."

I think it goes somewhere in the direction of, you can only reload a grenade every minute, but with a much lower timer for the actual resupply."

I understand that the point was to make the UCAV detectable but right now people will just mistake it as the sun. It doesn't help. At all."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,Dingokillr,5,Tue Jul 21 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"Excellent post! Here's my short take on each of them:  Indirect   XM25: Perfect, except for the resupply nerf. XM25 Smoke: As you said, a joke. XM25 Dart: Haven't used recently, but is apparently very good now. M224: Needs more ammo types, to be more ""supportive"" rather than ""lethal but underpowered"" (Smoke, Flare, Incendiary). Tube needs to regen or be resupplyable. UCAV: As you said, needs proper fix for spawn delay.      Defensive   Claymores: Only decent, and highly situational. Ability to have and/or place more than one would be ideal. Ballistic Shield: Yep, awful. Better hitbox, glass, and protection from grenades, just to name a few. MP-APS: Needs to be invulnerable to most small arms (think Mines) to be useful, should also despawn or detonate hand grenades.      Resupply   Pack: Needs to stick to people, likely resupply more total ammo. Box: Fine. Maybe should resupply all items at once, instead of in order.      And C4. C4 has far too much throwing range, too much splash damage vs. vehicles, fast resupply time, infinite ammo, and can be used for nearly every purpose.  Recon is supposed to be the C4 class, and until it gets some nerfs here, and other Support tools get buffed, it will continue to be a problem."

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,FPS_Bogan,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:30 2015 UTC,"The mortar should be reworked completely. It is pretty much a single-use gadget. Once those 5 rounds deplete and you want to use it sometime again, you'll need to deploy it somewhere and wait next to it a whole minute before its full. Also if it gets destroyed, its gone for good and you'll never get a new one.  I'd rather make it so that you only get those 4-5 rounds once you deploy it and once they are gone, they won't resupply. The mortar also could not be picked up. You would automatically resupply the mortar back after 90 seconds or so.  No other gadget in the entire game can be made unusable once it runs out of ammo or gets destroyed. Every single other gadget can be resupplied or they auto-replenish. But the mortar is so incredibly difficult to resupply unless you straight out camp with it, plus if it gets destroyed, the only way you can get a new one is from a commander supply crate. And pretty much nobody ever plays the commander anymore, more less drops supply crates."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,kht120,2,Tue Jul 21 23:44:30 2015 UTC,The riot shield needs a fix. I once hit a guy 4 times before I got the kill. It should be a consistent 2HK.

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,Smaisteri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:50:49 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting that 2 years after it's release, the game still doesn't have proper balance.  I hark back to BF2 & 2142 and yearn for the balance of those games. In all aspects of the gameplay those earlier games nailed the proper balance. I don't think they had even a fraction of complaints that comes with this game.   The sheer amount of weaponry must play a part in this dilemma. When there is so many guns, then there is a need to nerf the better weapons to encourage use of the lesser used ones. But all this does is make the fun weapons less fun, and the boring weapons remain boring. If there were just a handful of guns that fullfilled their unique purposes (close range, long range, high damage high recoil, etc.,) then there wouldn't be a need for constant weapon rebalancing.   When it comes to gadgets, I think there needs to be better gadgets. I suggest the ones from 2142. Well to be frank, I'd rather just have a BF2143 with everything pretty much the same except update the graphics. It was the prefect game, excellent class/kit balance, top notch teamwork gameplay, and amazing maps. More of that would be nice.  P.s. My suggestion for grenades would be not to have different damage models & different amounts you can carry, but keep the total the same and just change the way they function. For example, have a bouncing grenade that will keep bouncing for a short period of time, have a sticky grenade that will attach itself on walls or vehicles or wherever, another that detonates when you choose, and finally your normal grenades and smoke grenades."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e3wbe,Deyno9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:47:38 2015 UTC,"XM-25 AIRBURST:  This gadget is too OP. It should not have the ability to kill within 3 shots. Make its maximum damage kill with 4 shots. This is coming from someone with 1892 kills with it. XM-25 SMOKE: Almost completely useless. Or maybe not useless, its just that nobody will ever pick this over anything more useful. I have no idea on how to fix it except having it together with the other XM-25 ammo that you can alternate between like in Battlefield 3's crossbow. Would make the XM-25 overall too OP though. Maybe pair it with the XM-25 DART? C4: Its fine at the moment. However C4 jeeps, quads and dirt bikes are not. Mortar: The mortar itself, the tube needs to be resupplyable. And not only from the commanders supply crate, but from an ammo box. Or a timed auto-resupply like the UCAV or SUAV. Ballistic Shield: The glass breaks from almost anything. I think it should be completely unbreakable. Also the whole shield needs to be wider. Don't worry, it won't be OP because half the players will have rocket launchers and grenade launchers with them and blast off your face anyway. MP-APS: It needs to be more resilient. Make it like mines and C4, it doesn't take damage from small arms fire and your usual 5.56. Make it only take damage from like DMRs, sniper rifles and heavy hand cannons. And other non-infantry heavy weaponry of course. Plus explosives when it is offline. Also add score of something like 50 points per explosive deflected. Claymores: They are quite fine as they are right now. They can still feel quite underwhelming compared to other gadgets. How about keeping them as they are but rework field upgrades so that you get a perk early on that allows you to place 2 of them simultaneously? UCAV: I really don't have much trouble with it. Except that it looks ugly. The 60 second (or was it 90?) timer may be a bit too long though."

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2zkm,1stMora,8,Tue Jul 21 16:43:48 2015 UTC,I agree. The death should occur when I plunge the knife into the guys neck. The dog tags aren't his source of life. :)

Countless times in BF3 i would have run out of both primary and secondary magazine, and rather than Reload I would slash my knife at the guy, If he had less than half health and I was close enough I'd get the kill.  Not to mention, it was MUCH, MUCH faster to Slash the unknowing guy twice for a slient takedown, instead of ""Hang on, lemme disable myself for atleast three seconds while I stab you and hope Nobody is around and Nobody spawns on you""  I'd be happy with 40 dmg per slash instead of 50, Heck, even 30, just let me swing the knife for some damage!, I hate how BF4's knife slash literally does 0 damage"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2zkm,b1tchwood,2,Wed Jul 22 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"No, I think it's part of the risk and to be honest if anything they should fix the bug where you can't always kill the guy taking the tags. The animations are pretty solid though."

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e36xu,crawlerz2468,4,Tue Jul 21 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"good luck with that. Target prioritization has been an issue for more than 3 years as it was the exact same problem with bf3.  Bf4 made the guided missile problem worse because guided missiles are completly unreliable against laser designated targets now :   laser designated missiles can sometimes do less damage than when not designated, namely against jeeps. laser designated targets out of your sight are no longer hinted by a red box on the edge on your screen. laser designated missiles miss chopper and jets 3/4 of the time, even when no counter measures are deployed if the target is moving a bit fast.   And i could go on...  But on the other hand, we got auto-lock staff shells and active radar missiles that require no teamplay and (almost) no aiming at all...  This is so far down their fix list that i bet these issues will still be there in bf5."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e36xu,ProCandleLighter,3,Tue Jul 21 16:48:36 2015 UTC,laser guided missile should be low effort low reward  they should add more dumbfire options for the aircraft in general though.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e36xu,dewasser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"laser guided missile should be low effort low reward   That is correct.  Also, the way game balance is now, armor is already being hit by 20 different things.  We don't need the highly-agile, fast and repaired-on-the-move scout helicopter farming tanks with an effective lock-on."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e36xu,fugazied,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:46:14 2015 UTC,"Meh, armor is pretty easy to do good in. But the scout still doesn't need to be more versatile than it is, it can already win over every air vehicle and farm infy like no other."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e36xu,dewasser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"Copy-pasting my comment from the main sub:  I know how frustrating it can be, but the issues you mention are actually ways for ground vehicles to counter LGMs. Whether this was intended or not is debatable, but given the general lack of cover in most BF4 maps it seems appropriate for drivers to have some other means of avoiding LGMs (other than relying on their APS)."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e36xu,Malaria_AIDS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yes you should lose lock after you fire the missile if you stop aiming at the target, otherwise they are fire-and-forget bombs against the ground like a heatseeker is for the sky. Keep in mind that LGM's goto their last aimed position if you lose lock so long as you get the ""one two three"" stages of the launch (Drop, acquire, ignite rocket booster and fly towards target)  Aside from all the bugs with the vehicular weapons (TV going through APS, LGM's various locking and damage issues, TOW unable to hit a moving designated target) it would be nice if we got More CM diversity, not less, I'm sick of APS being the #1 best pick in every scenario."

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2cb5,Fiiyasko,2,Tue Jul 21 16:03:05 2015 UTC,"Since Spring Patch SOFLAM is completely useless against fast moving air targets:   no, the issue already existed before. But it is not well known because when it is reported, people usually say that the targets must have popped ECM or flares.  Another interesting fact, the javelin and guided missiles fail against fast moving targets but sraw actually hits.  Or, at least, it used to before the stupid sraw nerf. Didn't try since then.  Anyway, laser-designation target implementation is half-assed in battlefield 3 and 4 and the devs never bothered to take a good look at it. Jumping between targets, soflam that can be destroyed by a quick burst of tank HMG, no longer the lock signal on the edge of your screen if a target is locked outside or your view... i could go on."

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,BattlefieldBumPoop,5,Tue Jul 21 12:57:50 2015 UTC,They need to bring back the flag defense ribbon/medal that was in BF3.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,kfm946,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:06 2015 UTC,Yes!! Along with MCOM defender ribbons.   Defending flags is something people seem to seldom do and it turns the game into a circus of chasing people back and forth. My personal pet hate are those players that always go for the back flag over and over and over and over. If I choose to defend the flag I end up bored because it's not where the action is but I have to stay there because this guy won't give up. Yes I have done my job but I am rewarded with very few points but more likely to get the win.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,b1tchwood,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"Idk what it was, maybe the design of them, but getting ribbons in BF3 was far more satisfying in the way it popped up and how much more authentic they looked.  Also, combat efficiency needs to come back pls."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,M60E6,3,Wed Jul 22 00:48:49 2015 UTC,Could be an incentive for snipers to stay ON the flag instead of camping behind some random rock 300 meters from the next objective.  It shouldn't exceed 50 points every 30 seconds IMHO (or 25 points every 15 seconds). 100 points a minute for potentially doing nothing is the limit for me personally. Every point more would lead the more long range campers on the flags...     It could be worth to test it. I wonder how many more campers it would attract...  I can't decide if I like it or not :/
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,AzagsGaming,4,Tue Jul 21 13:18:31 2015 UTC,100 points per minute seems fair for being inside the flag radius. So if your guarding 1 flag during a round which lasts 20 minutes it would net you 2k teamwork points just for doing something useful.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,_Z3N_UK_,5,Tue Jul 21 15:47:07 2015 UTC,But you already get a 25 Conquest Defense bonus if you kill someone while defending a flag.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,GlennBecksChalkboard,5,Tue Jul 21 13:16:58 2015 UTC,"Really, you are going to pretend there isn't a massive asymmetry between the reward of attacking and defending? You get shit all for defending (the kill bonus is nothing), where as attacking you role in the points. It's better strategy to lose flags on purpose to retake than defend them. Aimlessly running around capping and instantly losing is heavily rewarded compared to actually take critical flags and holding a line, a much better strategy.   Points are needed for simply being on a flag and halting or slowing enemy neutralization or capping. Points are needed for re-capping a flag that wasn't quite neutralized, scaled to how much it was neutralized. A ribbon and medal is needed for defensive actions rather than just offensive. And a small reward for being on a flag ready to defend it is needed, there's not always enemies trying to cap or ready to be killed, but nonetheless you are still defending. Not a whole lot, you are standing there waiting, but if there's no incentive no one is going to stand by ready to defend when enemies do come 30 seconds later."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,Crack-The-Skye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:46 2015 UTC,But no ribbon anymore :(  (Like 2nd/3rd MVP)
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,speakingmoose123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:02 2015 UTC,"Uhh, majority of the time when you kill someone while ""defending"" you aren't in the flag capture radius (and you shouldn't have to be!) and don't get any points for it, not to mention 25 points is Pittiful for a person that sits there and waits for people to try and attack, rather than seeking out action.  There needs to be incentive for staying by the flag and guarding it, saaay during your guarding time, you get X points for the kill based on how long you've been there, so, sitting there without getting a kill gives you nothing, but sitting there and then killing an intruder would award you all your ""sitting"" points, because you actually did something useful after all that wasted time"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,Fiiyasko,0,Wed Jul 22 01:56:35 2015 UTC,"Giving points for camping flags doesn't seem like a very good idea. I mean you're essentially getting points for doing nothing much. What you can do instead is give more points for actions that happen on a flag, like killing or spotting enemies that are in the capture radius."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e2eui,Ghostflux,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:05:39 2015 UTC,"if you get 100 points per minute for flag defend, and a match is around 20 minutes, it means 2k points for defending, looks fair to me it aint that much, but its a good incentive"

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e21sx,CrazyFroggins,8,Tue Jul 21 10:25:47 2015 UTC,"On Dragon Pass you can't spawn into defenders' MAA during the last set of mcoms.  On Operation Firestorm attackers' attack jet self-destructs in the beginning of the round without the ability to spawn into it. It doesn't happen always, but very often.  On Giants of Karelia you can't spawn into attackers' IFV in the very beginning of the round (AMTRAC is available, though). You have to wait an additional minute.  I might be wrong, but on Nansha Strike you can only spawn into one RCB during 3rd set of moms, even though there are 2 RCB available."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e21sx,ReconRP,2,Tue Jul 21 10:53:58 2015 UTC,I always thought of it as a feature to keep rush mostly infantry while having those vehicles there for if actually needed. Stops vehicle rape but still keeps the vehicles in the game. I am of course mostly wrong about this and probably over thinking a bit.

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e1qp9,Thotaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not experiencing any crashing with my 2x 770s in SLI, and I've used most drivers from 347 to 353.49 (the most recent). I also don't think the issue is very widespread since we aren't seeing more reports about it (yes there are plenty of people, but the 770 was/is a very popular card, so the population with this issue is actually quite small).  This means it's not as simple as using GPU X with driver Y, there's some other part in the system configuration that is fucking this up, maybe it's a bad overclock, maybe there's some monitoring software that fucks it up, who knows? Have you tried reverting everything to stock, and doing a clean install of windows, while only installing the absolute minimum for testing? (drivers, origin, and the game itself)."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e1qp9,Thotaz,2,Tue Jul 21 09:12:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not doing any OC on my system, neither for CPU nor for GPU.  I'm also not running any aggressive background apps or monitoring software (completely disabled AV). My system is clean and every other game runs just fine even when it maxes out my GPU. This issue is limited to just ONE map in the current retail version. Every other map works fine, with no crashes, even when it maxes out my GPU.  Can you give info on your rig, just for reference?  You are right that the 770 is a popular card. But keep in mind that this issue is currently only limited to ONE map, that is also part of a DLC. Players that only play vanilla have never encounter this issue. And those who do play Pearl Market, might simply not come to the conclusion that it only crashes on that specific map, thinking it might be one of those random crashes that you get every once in a while.  IMO the rest of the system (hardware wise, OS might still play a roll here) is probably not involved in this issue. You can revert to old drivers and the bug stops to appear. This however makes other games perform very badly on my rig. So there must be something wrong with either the driver (IMO unlikely since every other game runs fine) or the GFX code of BF4 (shaders would be the first thing that come to mind)."

Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,SWE_Hyper,6,Mon Jul 20 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"I was on the fence for the new physics when I heard rumblings about it a year ago.  Now I'm scared of a new system. It seems much safer to address the complaints of the current system than would be to start from scratch, especially when we're getting at most one balance patch this year after the vehicle balance changes. Everything from stinger range to cannon damage to render distance and vehicle damage modifiers needs to get changed once you start speeding jets up."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,thesmilies,11,Tue Jul 21 00:13:37 2015 UTC,"I have to completely disagree with the ""it's too late in the game"" reasoning. BF3 is still populated years after BF4 released, and the next BF game isn't even announced yet. BF4 still has a long life left, and I don't think it's fair to let the ""I don't want to relearn this"" reasoning get in the way of balancing and improving the game."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,Zergonaplate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:34:36 2015 UTC,"Jets are highly OP in BF3. Don't take BF3 as a ground level to balance BF4 jets. The big problem are the Scout Helis. The GAU could use a little speed buff to be more dangerous to SJ. But apart from that, the overall balance of the AJ is very good with spring patch. It was OP before spring patch.  The AJ is not reverted to 313 in CTE atm. Your statement in the video is wrong. It got the old agility back but has still the new physics (devs told otherwise). This means that full speed gives you the max turnrate. This brings me to one very important insight: You guys from the ""jet community"" don't care about shit when it goes about testing in the CTE ( I knew that the new AJ physics would slip in retail with spring patch, I was enjoying it to see the AJ finally getting a nerf). Most jet guys mostly only moan and try to get the jets as OP as possible. I'm a guy who plays everything on the battlefield (except MMA, i got some honor) and tries to get every aspect of the game as balanced as possible. And the most important thing is, that I really test them on the CTE, while others just start rages about things they never experienced by themselves. Youtubers (sadly) reach much more people than a thread on CTE reddit, and thus you guys have the responsibility to try to be as neutral as possible. And more important, your facts have to be correct.  We got at most a couple of weeks left until the summer patch is locked. We need to work together to get the best possible balanced jet experience out there with this patch. This will be sadly based on the 313 physics for now, but we need to make the devs to tweak it in a way that most guys on the battlefield are happy with it."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,MaChiMiB,2,Tue Jul 21 11:50:09 2015 UTC,"The attack jet was never OP. Literally anyone with 2 hrs in a stealth jet could kill the attack jet, due to the SJ turning so much tighter. If you can't be bothered to learn basic speed control in order to deal with the occasional ace pilot in the AJ, you don't have the right to complain. As if that wasn't enough there was still the MAA which would always win over any jet even before the patch(ofc depending on how good the driver was)  The attack jet after patch is terribly underpowered. There was so little that was needed in order to balance the jets before the patch(basically = JDAM for SJ)but they went overboard and broke it.  Most of the jet community doesn't play cte, because there isn't really a dedicated jet community anymore. It died with spring patch."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,dewasser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:21 2015 UTC,"I know how to fly jets, and it was not easy to get an AJ down. There were very often guys easily going 70-0 on paracel and goldmud.  After the spring patch it's still possible to do very well with the AJ, but it's not that easy anymore. No more kill farming, you have to choose your target wisely and support your team/ your team has to support you.  BF4 does not need an OP airforce like in BF3.  The SJ does not need a JDAM, the LGM needs a buff, so repairing engineers die on impact. Possibly APS should not block LGM."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,MaChiMiB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:39 2015 UTC,You are pretty incorrect my man. Stealth jet pilots can easily take down Attack Jets. Just equip ECM if you need a better chance to stealthily take out an attack jet. It's all about your surrounding as the stealth jet can VERY easily out-turn an attack jet.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,Graphic-J,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:01:16 2015 UTC,Hah? Are you kidding me? You barely need to keep your speed between 280 and 340 to outturn an attack jet. Not to mention speedfailing is very common in the attack jet due to lack of afterburner. Put active radar on that and if you fail at killing an attack jet you must fail at everything else too.    The spring patch completely wrecked jets. Scout heli always wins over an attack jet due to OP miniguns and attack jet that can barely scratch them.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,dewasser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"ah, come one! A good AJ could give a good SJ a very hard time (still speaking about pre spring patch DFs). I don't care about the ultra pro jet pilots, I care about the medium skilled playerbase and want to get the overall balance right.  I already said that the scouts are OP."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,MaChiMiB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"Lol no, he won't. Anyone, literally anyone who spent 2hrs dedicated to learning the stealth jet, speed control and basic dogfighting used to wreck attack jet pilots. Going SJ vs AJ is like clubbing baby seals."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,dewasser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:50 2015 UTC,What is the 313 system? I don't fly jets much.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,aj_thenoob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:38:34 2015 UTC,313 is the perfect turn speed in jet
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,Girtablulu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:48:54 2015 UTC,When your speed is at 313 - you achieve the tightest possible turning angle which makes it easier to outturn your opponent. You do this by tapping on your brakes or afterburner at the right times. Going even a little bit too fast or too slow can get you killed.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,loner_ru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok, thanks! Now what is the optimal turn radius for the updated jets?"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,aj_thenoob,3,Tue Jul 21 02:05:29 2015 UTC,"There isn't one, that was the whole point of the new jet physics. Different speeds have their advantages and disadvantages. Going faster makes you turn faster but wider, going slower makes you turn slower but tighter (going too slow will make you stall of course).  Physical energy also plays a bigger role because planes are more affected by gravity.  Depending on your angle you'd lose or gain speed much faster than before, which you can use to your advantage.  Also in 313 system you had unlimited afterburner, but you didn't actually gain anything from going fast. The new system does have an advantage for going fast, but the afterburner is also limited and needs to recharge after a while."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,loner_ru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:37 2015 UTC,"Huh, I'll have to check that out! Thanks!"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,aj_thenoob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:39 2015 UTC,"No problem, but I don't think you can check that out anymore since they reverted the system back to 313 in CTE. :/ Hopefully that's just temporary."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,loner_ru,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:37 2015 UTC,"I was going to make a similar thread about what to do with both jets to bring them into the game more.  Does that make sense?  I'll clarify.     The Rogue Transmission gameplay in your video perfectly showcases the underlying issues with jets.  You only took 16 points of damage in total throughout the entire video, and it wasn't all at the same time either.  There are a myriad of reasons for this, here are some of the major ones:   Jets fly too fast.  When you're gunning it at full speed you can cross most maps from one side to the other in under 20 seconds.  This speed means you can evacuate a dangerous area almost immediately.  The game gets balanced around that speed and things become very volatile for jets.  You ever stopped to wonder why even the machine gun on a super-light transport vehicle can dish out so much damage to jets?  However, slowing jets down means you get more time on target, so they'll have to take a damage nerf, or maybe lower the overheat threshold. The flight area is too big.  For now it has to be this way because the jets fly so fast, we don't want another Dawn Breaker situation.  The problem here is that there are so many safe zones that are out of ground forces' reach.  On Rogue Transmission alone there are 3 major safe zones: Behind the hills of D flag, the middle of nowhere by E flag (which technically does allow infantry to enter, but there's no reason to) and the vast emptiness on the far side of the satellite dish.  Along with the uncaps, these areas are where jets commonly flee to so that their vehicle health can safely regenerate.  If the jets are slowed down then the flight area doesn't need to be so much bigger than the ground area. One last safe zone exists, and it spans the entire area of the map.  High up in the sky, out of reach of SAMs (surface to air missiles).  In the video you were constantly flying deep into enemy territory with no care in the world.  Obviously it's extremely helpful when not a single person decides to point a SAM at you, but even if they did you could still locate them with the lock on direction indicator and pick them off with a JDAM from orbit.  That is why I think SAMs should have a cylindrical lock on zone rather than a sphere.  It eliminates the high altitude safe zone so jets will have to take more caution when entering enemy territory. Jet gameplay is too volatile.  There are a lot of factors that contribute to this:  Cannon damage is too high against other jets.  When another jet goes in for the kill you can go from full health to dead in only 4 or 5 seconds.  You could make the comparison to infantry, but they respawn in 5 seconds and have ways to heal themselves back to 100 reasonably quickly if they survive the encounter.  Mobility hits are a big topic, but that all relates to the lock on balance with jets (and helicopters).  2 of the 3 counter measures instantly nullify any number of incoming missiles and negate further lock ons for a short time.  Because of how extremely effective these counter measures are, the missiles have to be much more deadly.  Hence we have mobility hits.  However mobility hits create the potential to be killed by a single missile.  See how the balance is kind of spiralling out of control?   To solve this at the root, the fire extinguisher should be the only counter measure for jets.  Think about that for a second.  If missiles can't be nullified, SAMs no longer have the requirement of reloading and locking on really quickly.  Sure it means your jet will be taking more hits overall, but if SAMs are tweaked at the same time it should hopefully reduce the missile spamming that we see currently, and lead to an overall more positive experience for both the pilot and the guys on the ground.     TL;DR   When piloting a jet it feels like you're playing a minigame, separate from the main battle.  The flow of battle on the ground needs to have a much bigger effect on jets. Following on from that, there are very few effective ways to bring down a jet.  You could jump in your own jet (join the minigame) or use SAMs when they get close.  Because of this lack of options, jets should not have flares or ECM so that they can no longer nullify a primary source of damage.  This should obviously come with tweaks to the reload and lock on speed of SAMs. Jet gameplay is too volatile.  When you die, you usually die quite quickly.  It goes without saying that this is not fun for the pilot. At the core of it all the problem is that jets fly too fast.  They can swoop in out of nowhere and deal a lot of damage very quickly, then get out of range of a counter attack just as fast.  No amount of fiddling with reload speed and damages is going to make jets balanced and fun to play, you've got to look outside the box."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,ZephyrusSpring,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"This should obviously come with tweaks to the reload and lock on speed of SAMs.   With maps like Floodzone and Dawnbreaker would make them almost useless against copter unless damage is increased, then you are back to how they impact jets.  Another idea without touching damage you could make AA-Mines more useful for maps like Floodzone and Dawnbreaker"
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,Dingokillr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:26:47 2015 UTC,"No, increasing the damage would not solve the floodzone issue where the missile never hits in the first place.  I find using SAMs is fairly useless against the SH on Floodzone, however I've shot down my fair share with rocket launchers and grounded many with the M320.  Besides, there are likely a few changes coming to the SH very soon, so we'll have to re-evaluate after that happens anyway.  I've never considered helicopters to be an issue on Dawn Breaker because the tall buildings force them to fly in confined pathways, making them pretty easy to shoot down with a SRAW or even RPG."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,ZephyrusSpring,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:42:09 2015 UTC,You have more chance of destroying a copter with AT weapons then with AA and yet you want to make it even harder for AA weapons.     Good luck on hoping changes will come to the SH.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,Dingokillr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:32:00 2015 UTC,"Even with the current super fast reload and lock speed the SAMs bare little threat to the SH, what do you want to do? Speed the SAMs up even more!?  Long story short, Floodzone needs an MAA for each team.  It's a map with very little vertical cover at the central flags, and transport vehicles can't get get up there to get the necessary line of sight to chip away at the SH with their machine guns.  Infantry are left with no cover and have to fend off the anti-infantry helicopter that has lots of cover due to the elevated setting.  It's a map design issue, and how do you fix map design issues?  You change map elements of course.  Ie fiddling with vehicle allocation.  The MAA would make good use of its long range cannons to force the scout out of a portion of the map, and the elevated flags mean that the MAA would not be able to gun down infantry unless they wandered too close to the building's edge.  I can see MAAs sitting on the roof of A flag and shooting players as they cross from B to C and back, but if the MAA was not able to aim low enough then that problem goes away without majorly affecting the balance on every other map."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,ZephyrusSpring,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:38 2015 UTC,"The MAA in it's current state would be able to sit in spawn and deny the entire map to all helicopters. That's not balance. That's broken as fuck. Not to mention, it would be just as powerful if not more than an IFV."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,SagittandiEstVita,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:35 2015 UTC,"In its current state   This is the part where you've got to look at the big picture.  The MAA is almost definitely getting nerfed at some point during this vehicle balancing, we'll have to wait and see if your statement still applies once that's happened."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,ZephyrusSpring,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:21:49 2015 UTC,Past DICE balance sweeps in BF4 have done nothing to make any pilot think the MAA will be catching a much needed nerf any time soon.
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,SagittandiEstVita,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:36:51 2015 UTC,"I also feel that the jets need to be part of the battlefield. Reducing their speed is a key aspect to achieve this. Reducing speed doesn't mean that their agility needs to be worse!  You should be able to take down jets if your team works together. This is barely the case at the moment. As you said, jets have too much save zones."
Battlefield_4_CTE,3e0age,MaChiMiB,0,Tue Jul 21 11:14:09 2015 UTC,It's already confirmed 313 will be back for both jets in Summer patch AFAIK. With the new system being added in Autumn hopefully.
