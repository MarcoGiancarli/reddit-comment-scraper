Again, it's not fun for others. Don't be afraid to go outside of your comfort zone. Some of the best RP comes from doing exactly that.

Little things that could have great significance later on, that Professor Moon may or may not notice the next time they interact.

He's dressed in comfortable summer-weight gray slacks, and a green and white plaid, button up shirt. His beard is neatly trimmed.

HogwartsRP,3dggex,elphieisfae,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"The ""July 7th"" title but ""submitted July 16th"" timestamp is really confusing me    I was actually fairly happy with the way it ended, even the Hermione/Ron romance. But I think a neat alternate ending would have Harry actually killed along with Voldemort...    ...fade to black...    ...and Harry awakes in Limbo, which is actually another world entirely. The story can end with him happily greeting his ""dead"" loved ones here (instead of the somewhat cheesy use of the Resurrection Stone earlier). But! The story can also continue, with Harry trying to find a way to either continue through to the afterlife with his loved ones, or possibly return to the mortal realm and live out his life."

It's drawback is that it is attuned to inner conflict. If I am not honest with myself and I fail to recognize all that I am, my wand will know and it perform inadequate magic as a result.   As for getting resorted, I don't know where I would go if not Ravenclaw. If there is anything I love more than quidditch it's finding answers to questions I have, learning new things that I want to learn, choosing my own path, that part of me has not changed. I guess I'd be in Slytherin since... well, I don't want to be considered average. I don't want to be ""a face in the crowd"" I want rise above that nonsense. I want to be great, I want to achieve, I want to be... Superior.  OoC: So, yeah I actually gave Wesley my own wand and modeled his initial character around it (he's developing into his own person now but the traits of that wand will still linger within him). I personally have been through my fair share of inner struggles and I wasn't too surprised to find that Pottermore wand I got would ""short out"" on me when I was not sure of myself.  Unlike, Wesley I already know I'm getting Ravenclaw. Like everyone else I possess traits from all four houses, what I value the most are the traits of Ravenclaw.

I was sorted into Hufflepuff, which was a surprise. I do not consider myself very friendly or hardworking, and was sure I'd be sorted into Ravenclaw. I can't say I was crushed.

Im not going to mention the core of my wand Dragon heart string, and Acromantula web - which is illigal in the UK, becuase I dont like any of you. Oh its also 11.5 inches and ridged.

In my time at Hogwarts I could not think of anywhere else I could belong besides Ravenclaw. I'm no Hufflepuff, and I don't care too much for ambition as I do knowledge, I'm brave but that's not my most defining trait. If I were sorted again, I'd just tell it that I plan to stay in Ravenclaw since it was logical and it would likely agree with me.  OOC: Ravenclaw through and through. If I had that hat on my head  I'd have a debate with it as to where I would go. I'd question it's judgement too and point out that the my most valuable parts of myself are the Ravenclaw parts."

HogwartsRP,3ckbom,bshef,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"I think the Harry Potter system of magic is deliberately vague and mostly neutral, in nature. It draws a lot of inspiration from neopaganism. As a result, many spells we see are utilitarian in nature (though they're not always used for their original intended purpose).    But I always thought it would be cool to expand on the nature of the ""Dark Arts."" Specifically, if there was another element to it entirely, such as Blood Magic a la A Song of Ice and Fire by GRRM. For those who don't know, this type of magic requires living sacrifices to be made in order to work powerful magic. The more ""powerful"" the blood spilled (royal blood, best of all), the more powerful the magic. So it's considered evil, because it requires killing someone or something. But those who use it don't necessarily view it as evil, just a necessary and noble sacrifice made for the greater good."
HogwartsRP,3ckbom,Wesley_Drayton,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:12:14 2015 UTC,"In the Inheritance Cycle, those who are capable of magic can store their magic energy in various gemstones for whenever they are in a pinch. That would be something interesting to have."

It would be fun to see."
HogwartsRP,3ckbom,Assassinsayswhat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"From what I can understand this subreddit, as well as Harry Potter fans in general seem to think that the ability to use magic is limited by some sort of energy pool withing the user. I recall from the battle that fatigue is given to a user if they use magic too much, that they are capable of passing out if they overdo it. Personally I like the idea that magic will only cause physical fatigue to the user if they are waving their wands far too much but the real fatigue comes from in their minds.   To properly execute a spell a user would need knowledge of magical theory, proper technique, practice, and willpower. Every student to ever attend Hogwarts would have to know how spells work, this is proven in the first book at Harry's first Transfiguration class. Then students would learn the proper technique, they would have to carry it out at least once either in class or later in the evening for homework. Immediately they would have to practice for exams, enough practice is makes perfect or at least guarantees a passable attempt. Lastly is willpower, or more like the desire to try your best in the spells you want. In the OotP it's said that you mean what the Cruciatus Curse. I think that should apply to all spells, you won't get the desired results unless you seriously want them. In conclusion, I think it would be cool if there was a similar system here on the sub."
HogwartsRP,3ckbom,ElmaNore,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:49:34 2015 UTC,I've seen some RPGs implement various Bots that roll dice... and it would be pretty trivial to script one out. But the problem is that we'd all have to agree on the rules used by the Bot.
HogwartsRP,3ckbom,elphieisfae,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"I imagine we'd have to assign a value to every spell based on difficulty? Alohamora would have a lower value, and something like the silver shield would have a much much higher value. The caster would have to meet the value just to have a success, but a perfect cast requires more than that. Things like year and the roll of the die would add points to the caster. Mispronunciation would have a high negative penalty to the caster. Too many prior spells cast by that person in the same thread could also have a penalty... That's correct, I've never made a reddit bot before and have no idea what is or isn't easily possibleXD  but then would we have to add rules to account for some students having learned nonverbals, and some students being good at transfiguration, but bad at defence?"

HogwartsRP,3cg89n,bshef,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:17:16 2015 UTC,"OOC:    There were a LOT of classes I wanted to take, but just didn't have the time or energy for. There were a couple classes I was really excited about, but was disappointed to learn I had misconceptions. I took a robotics course that was way more intense mathematics than actually working with robots. I took a graphics course that didn't teach me how to make awesome-looking video games, but rather taught me how to make my own graphics card (more super intense math.) I took a Software Testing course which taught nothing practical, and turned out to just be using the students to do the heavy lifting for the professor's own niche research. I took a Software Engineering course which turned out to just be using the students as unpaid labor for the professor's software which he was selling to a hospital (he had to make the hospital sign a waiver and declare the class as a Graduate-level course in order for that to be legal. It was utter bullshit.)  The weirdest class I took was ""Special Topics in Literature."" So, I needed one Literature credit, and this was the only class that fit my schedule. Whatever, right? My first red flag was that the course description and teacher were both listed as ""TBD."" I just assumed that ""special topics"" meant we'd being going over things like foreshadowing, character development, blah blah blah. So the first day of class, there's about twenty of us (mostly engineers) sitting outside in the hallway, and this tall, thin man carrying a big bible under his arm walks up, unlocks the door, and lets us in. He smiles, and says, ""Alright, let's talk about Jesus."" We were like ""Uh, no, we're here at a public University, not church."" He then goes on to explain that as this semester's guest professor for the course, he gets to decide which special topic to discuss, and the topic he chose is Jesus. In Literature, and Pop Culture. (See: Superman, The Matrix, etc etc.) So we wound up reading and discussing the four books of The Gospel in detail, and then reading and watching a bunch of other material that evoked Jesus Christ. It turned out to actually be a very cool class. Here's a group video project we did for the class (audio quality sucks, so wear headphones): https://vimeo.com/16334038    My favorite class, however, was Senior Design. We formed a multidisciplinary team, and spent the entire first semester designing a project -- an open-source, fully customizable, intelligent security system. And we spent the second semester developing it. We then had to present it and receive a satisfactory grade in order to be allowed to graduate. Some Universities in the US call this a capstone requirement. What made it really awesome is that my team was so awesome! We were MONTHS ahead of schedule at every checkpoint, so we screwed around a lot. We'd put a bunch of pictures of Sexy Sax Man in our official presentations, we'd have Nerf wars among the cubicles in the research lab, we'd have ""Pizza and Porn Parties"" every Friday night (in which there would be Pizza, but no Porn. Just stupid YouTube videos.) And during this time, I took three weeks off to go get married and enjoy my honeymoon. Didn't affect our schedule in the slightest! While every other team pulled all-nighters for a week in the scramble to come up with a Powerpoint Presentation, we made a full, horribly corny commercial for our system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN-me1DeKcI Our final grade: 98%. We blew away every other team."

HogwartsRP,3bmjjy,bshef,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:46:14 2015 UTC,"Wall of Text Warning:    I had just started middle school (6th grade in the US, 1st Year in the UK), and right away my English/Literature teacher noticed I was far more advanced than most other students in terms of my reading, writing, and grammar skills. I'd blow through the assignments with ease, and spend my idle time screwing around in her class out of sheer boredom.    So one day she shows me a Scholastic catalog, and recommends books to me. She knew I had a thing for fantasy, and she recommended Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. She explained it was about a boy my age who learns he is a wizard and goes to a wizarding school. I remember being apprehensive at first because the cover art seemed geared more towards younger children. But she promised it was definitely more my speed. So I brought the catalog home, told my parents, and they ordered the book for me.    I. Was. HOOKED. I tore through that book like nothing before! Previously, my favorite series was the Animorphs (come on, it was the 90's, gimme a break), but even then I'd never read a book in a single sitting.    I was so disappointed when I had finished, though. I felt like I had somehow ""wasted"" the book by reading it so quickly. When I told my teacher about it, she winked and said there'd be a sequel. And by the time Chamber of Secrets came out, I noticed that the Harry Potter series had become... popular.    And this was a totally new experience for me. For the first time in my life, I was ahead of a cool trend! My parents were quite impressed, too. I was always sort of a bookworm, but this was a whole new level. So they started reading too, and got hooked! They began reading the books, a chapter at a time, to my younger brother before he went to bed. And he loved it, too!    So now I was the official source for all thing Harry Potter in my family. When the first movie came out, I didn't even care that they had to cut so much out -- what they left in was almost precisely how I had pictured things, and that was exciting. Besides, I knew there'd be many more movies.    But it wasn't until I heard about the Wizarding World of Harry Potter that I realized just how enormous the fandom had become. I thought I was an expert, ahead of the curve... but there were people out there tattooing the Deathly Hallows on themselves, people that were transforming the series into roleplaying games, people that were making recipes based on the book, etc etc etc.    And last year, I grabbed the entire movie series on Blu Ray for a fantastic deal, and watched them all the way through with my daughter. Of course, she didn't really understand, being an infant, but she liked the funny noises and flashy colors. And in doing so, I sort of fell completely into the fandom. I signed up on Pottermore (despite being far too old) just to get my official Sorting and Wand. I got Slytherin lounge pants, which I happily wear in public. (My wife's dirty looks make it all the more worthwhile).    And now it's gotten to the point where for Father's Day, my wife bought me the Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook and a REALLY nice-looking Hogwarts Diploma (I swear to God, it's nicer than my actual university diploma). And we've decided that for our kids' 11th birthdays, they are going to get acceptance letters, get sorted, get wands, and get whisked away to the nearest Wizarding World. I sure hope they're as geeky about Harry Potter as I am."
HogwartsRP,3bmjjy,ElmaNore,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:02:10 2015 UTC,"I was maybe 9 or so when I first picked up the books. I knew they were getting popular, but all copies of the book were always on hold. I'm not sure if other schools had this, but my school district was using Accelerated Reader and mostly everyone in that school read. Like a ton. That library book was never going to come off hold XD  I came across the first book at Planet Video and Music. Now, back in my day, they used to have these places you could go to in order to rent VHS or DVD. It was much like red box, but it was like an actual store. They also sold cd's, candy and movie posters. Also, evidently, books. They were just on a table, scattered about looking all temporary.   So I convinced my parents that I wanted to read the book, and I'll give up my movie rental for the next few weeks if they bought it for me. Done. (I believe I'd tricked my brother into thinking he wanted to rent all the movies that I wanted to rent after that.)  So I read the book in one day, completely enthralled by this world. I thought it was the most fantastic thing ever. I fantasized about turning eleven and being carted off to this magic school far away from home. Hermione was instantly my favorite character, of course XD    Now, the back off the book had a little advert for the Chamber of Secrets, which I also acquired through the most nefarious means a child can come up with. I thought it was a scary book, with the slithering and the snake talk and the dead kids. But again, I loved it. Moar!  Unfortunately, my uncle had decided to visit. I was on my fourth read through of the first book when my uncle asked if I liked the book  Yep! Goes back to reading.  ""It's about witches, right?""  My dad turns and looks at me. Witches? You're reading a book about witches?   I tell him it's not a big deal, they're good witches.  I come back from school the next day with my Bertie Bott's backpack, all happy from another fun day of learning.   I kid you ducking not, my dad took my backpack as soon as I walked in the door. My uncle had a bible out, reading some prayer as my dad waved a burning stick around the backpack. They were purifying my backpack o.o  ....by the end of the day, I'd have to give away both books, the poster, the little Harry Potter board game I had and anything else I had Harry Potter related. I was devastated.  You bet your ass I had a plan.  The first two books were almost always unavailable in the library because new people kept getting into the series, but the later books were free. It was so painfully easy to continue reading the Harry Potter series. I would check the books out at school and either leave them in my desk, or just keep them in my room to read.  I hit a bit of a road block with the fourth book. I thought it was boring. I could not make it through to the end. I kept picking up other books to read, kept having to renew the fourth book until eventually I just returned it and stopped with the series. I did not want to skip the book. I did not want to skim it either.   So the movies started coming out, and I watched movies 1-3.   I wouldn't pick up the series again until university. By then, I already know who dies at the end of which book, but I warned all of my friends that I will shoot them if they gave details. I am so happy that I continued reading the books. Honestly, aside from the fourth book, I was hooked on every single word. She's a fantastic storyteller and I only wish I hadn't taken so long to finish the books. I wish I'd stick it out with the fourth book, that I was part of all the hype everytime a new book was out. I feel like I missed something great, to be honest.y  I never recovered my original collection, but my current collection would put it to shame."
HogwartsRP,3bmjjy,elphabaisfae,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:22:49 2015 UTC,"I tried reading them when they first came out. I couldn't get into it much. I liked Luna and Tonks though; I had friends who were mad, mad about it. I just kept resisting.  Finally, when Book 7 came out, I was a manager at a bookstore in Northern Virginia (Landmark Mall, if you remember that Waldenbooks!) I was 27.  My head manager put me in charge of the midnight release. I was the Headmistress, I dressed up in my pink and black ball gown and was a fucking fairy princess with a tiara and everything.  I read all the books in one sitting, about 16 hours worth of reading. (yes, I read fast. Very fast. Absorbingly fast).  I got it then. and OH MAN WAS I HYPED for the release. All the boxes in the back room.. we were going to be fired and jailed if we opened them before we could. It was scary. (No; seriously. Someone got fired at one store for breaking into a box.)  I ran all the games, I had a blast.   Then we got to open the boxes.   oh man, was that a thrill. Got everyone rang up, went home about 2 am, and read my copy from cover to cover. Got really pissed about the ending, holy shit I still am and I hate the ending of book 7 with a vengeance.  But then worked open to close the next two days and finally loved all the books."

I fling an armful of rocks (3 small stones really), that I gathered at some point previously, forward, in the general direction of the tree, up into the air, and quickly attempt to cast Wingardium Leviosa (read: Wingardium Levi-longooo- sa :P) on them all at once.  I wonder how it came to be so violent.  And if it ever sleeps.  Maybe in the winter? And-- Gah, so many questions flying through my mind!

HogwartsRP,3bcgnh,TheTestAdmin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:18:55 2015 UTC,"An hour before midnight, Professor Moon finally finishes rowing his boat to the middle of the lake. The thin sliver of moon above his head does little to light the lake, instead letting the twinkling stars and wispy tendrils of the Milky Way play about in the gently lapping, obsidian waters.    He begins setting up his equipment: The journal and enchanted quill, a jar of shimmering, silvery liquid (this time, giving off an eerie, deep violet glow), and a jar of espresso. But he's also brought a few extra items with him this time, as well. Sitting in the boat next to him are several thick, woolen blankets, as well as a set of small vials. Finally, he also pulls out a tiny vial containing barely a thimbleful of a white powder.    He slowly rolls it around between his fingers, apprehensively, for a minute. He makes notes about the date, the environment, and the astronomical configuration in his journal. Though he wasn't particularly keen on astrology in general, he knew it did have a profound effect on magic. And while Pluto wasn't traditionally considered in the arts of alchemy or potions, his research has indicated that the more he can do to align his work with the faraway, icy world, the better his results. And he knew from reading the papers that there was a Muggle spacecraft quite near the little dwarf planet tonight, which should be enough of a connection... astrologically speaking.    He looked back over the lake, waiting for Crumbs to appear. /u/elmalilalimes"
HogwartsRP,3bcgnh,bshef,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:42:43 2015 UTC,"Crumbs appears over a hill, wearing an apron and dark trousers under her green robes. She carries with her a bag full of her own equipment should they need it. She looks at him, dark eyes assessing him before looking over the lake.  ...why the lake?"
HogwartsRP,3bcgnh,Elmalilalimes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming she rowed out to meet him?    Well, aside from it being remote and pretty and serene... I have easy access. A little magic to slip through the window in my office with my supplies, and poof, I'm on the surface and dry before the merfolk even know.    Plus, I've been prepping this area for quite some time now. It's attuned to enhance my work, and quite secure. I have contingencies upon contingencies... You didn't actually think I was ""patrolling"" (he makes air quotes here and rolls his eyes) all those weeks before the attacks, right?    He holds up the glowing jar of silvery liquid. This is Formula 23. When I ingest it, I fall into a sort of metaphysical coma, where I can explore my subconscious, and study my own memories. When I awake from the coma, I have a very limited time to record what I've learned before the experience fades from my memory completely. I can extend that time to a tiny degree by quaffing a horrific quantity of espresso... He gestures to the jar of dark liquid... But tonight I'm willing to try a much stronger stimulant... He now holds up the tiny little vial containing white powder. This little fella makes me a tad apprehensive, I will admit, but nothing is off the table as far as I'm concerned.    My ultimate goal is to figure out what happened to my memories, and devise a cure. I've sacrificed much for this work, and I'll have many sins to atone for when it's done... So please don't try and betray me while I'm unconscious. He doesn't say this with an ounce of malice or threat in his voice, it's merely a general statement, as if he had said, 'Please pass the salt.'    Now he begins to wrap himself in the woolen blankets, and hands her the jar of Formula 23, knowing she'd want to examine it. I really could use your help. Every five minutes, try to extract a memory from me... I expect to be inside my own head, trying to push important ones towards the surface. They might be of more use in a pensieve if I've hand-selected them from within my own subconscious.     As Crumbs examines the exotic potion, Moon sets his wand down at his feet, and murmurs a complex vanishing incantation over it, concentrating hard. The wand pops out of existence -- presumably to reappear later, in order to prevent anyone from taking it while he's unconscious. He is showing his true self: Highly meticulous and logical and focused on his goal; not the goofball professor dragging barrels of lemons around the castle."
HogwartsRP,3bcgnh,bshef,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:59:26 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh, I didn't catch that he was on the lake already. Okie, sounds good.  She shrugs Patrolling would have made sense, I had no reason to think otherwise. Regardless, I had other things to think about. She takes the potions and looks it over as he talks. She's intrigued by the formula and intends to ask him what it's made of and how he developed it.  It is rather curious...you say you don't know exactly what you don't remember, but your skills and knowledge seem to have remained intact. You were able to make this? And you know enough to perform magic on this level. You know where your family is, yes? What's missing? She frowns slightly  I'll do what I can, but drawing out memories isn't exactly a skill I'm well-versed in. Occlumency, that's another matter, she thinks wryly.  ....This stimulant you'll be using, it wouldn't happen to originate from a plant whose leaves are chewed upon in the Andes for it's effects?"
HogwartsRP,3bcgnh,Elmalilalimes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:25:16 2015 UTC,"Moon takes a deep breath. Not only was his family's predicament highly personal... It was potentially dangerous. There are likely people in the Ministry who would kill to keep this whole thing covered up, rather than let Moon expose the accident. But until he can recover his memories, he an his family are not technically reliable as far as evidence.    His voice is low, quiet, serious, and razor sharp. My family suffers much worse than me. They often don't remember me at all. There was an accident, and a cover up, and I'm picking up the pieces. Until then, they're committed to St. Mungo's for the rest of their lives... And they are under strict orders from the government to treat my family like dementia patients.     This is why nothing is off limits to me. I need to fix my family.     He clears his throat. All his cards were on the table, now. Well... Yes that's cocaine. Unless you can brew some amphetamines, that's the strongest stimulant I can get a hold of.     I've been all over Knockturn and Diagon Alley, and all over Leeds and London, securing suppliers of various ingredients. I'm using my status as a Professor at Hogwarts to gain access to otherwise restricted resources for ""research."" Most recently, I had to acquire that cocaine myself.     He winces. It was not fun. And I've used industrial quantities of mandrake and Mercury in my formulas.    ... I need to fix this, Cookie."
HogwartsRP,3bcgnh,bshef,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:14:50 2015 UTC,"She responds sharply  Do not call me that. It's Veronica.  She sets the formula down next to him. Mercury and Mandrake...this man will get himself killed if he isn't careful, she knows. She is already thinking hard about her own experiments. Has she discovered anything that looks even remotely promising for this situation? She'll have to dig through her lab.  Have you considered that with Black in charge up high, you could be authorized to move your family out of St. Mungos? Get someone you trust to help care for them.  As for your memories, what precisely is the coverup? A coverup is often more than simply burying the truth. What is the lie? What are they telling you when you try to ask why your family is in St. Mungos? When you ask why you don't recall?"
HogwartsRP,3bcgnh,Elmalilalimes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:19:29 2015 UTC,"Black wouldn't say one word to me. Positively ignored me. Bigger fish to fry, I suppose, but... I'm not going to wait for him.    The cover up is... Well... From what I can tell, it was the Ministry's fault. Some obliviator messed up, and wiped out my family's memory, thinking they were Muggles. It went horribly wrong, and they tried to hide it from their superiors. They succeeded, by tampering with my memories to make me believe my entire life was very different. They stuck my family in St. Mungo's and classified the circumstances.     My consumption of caffeine allowed just enough of my memories to return for me to start piecing my own life back together - something they didn't count on."
HogwartsRP,3bcgnh,bshef,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:43:10 2015 UTC,She nods and pulls out her wand  Alright then. You want me to help you draw out a few things while you're under? That's what you wanted tonight? And I assume you intend to bring it up with those superiors? You're absolutely sure that this coverup does not extend to higher echelons of the ministry?
HogwartsRP,3bcgnh,Elmalilalimes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:54:16 2015 UTC,"Yes. And if I haven't completely freaked you out after that... I could obviously use a more nuanced approach to the formulae.     He takes back the jar and unscrews the lid. The pair is assaulted by a strong, sickly sweet scent.    I don't know the extent of the cover-up, to be honest. I killed someone who could have provided valuable information... In hindsight, that was a bad call.     He shrugs, and gives the jar a swirl.    L'chayim! He grins at the wholly inappropriate use of the traditional Hebrew toast 'to life,' and then tilts his head back and chugs as much of the potion as he can stomach.    Oof, that's much thicker than last time. He smacks has lips. I'm actually detecting a hint of licorice, and--    Suddenly, his eyes roll back and he collapses back into his rowboat, sending gentle ripples to slowly drift away under the midnight sky."
HogwartsRP,3bcgnh,bshef,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:21:04 2015 UTC,Professor Crumbs leans over him and puts a hand over his mouth to check for breath. Then she pokes his eyelid with her wand to see if he's actually under or just pretending.

HogwartsRP,3autt4,ElmaNore,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:51:08 2015 UTC,"To me, that a Hufflepuff student was made the Hogwarts champion meant something. The house is generally overlooked as the catch-all house, but you know, maybe it's the catch-all house because the people in it -loyal, friendly and hardworking- are the type to accept everyone into the fold.  It has smart people, it has brave people, it has ambitious people, it has people that are all of the above, but they are also terribly kind, which I strongly believe to be a more admirable trait.   It's hard. With everything that goes on in the world, it's hard to be kind, to be generous , to be compassionate. I think Hufflepuff is beautiful house, and I try everyday to one day be worthy of it."

So many people who are way out of Hogwarts still have fond memories, are still with the same friends, some are still with the same lovers/husbands/whatever.  The fact is everyone goes into Hogwarts. Everyone is treated equally by the hat. Then it's fate, kismet, and hard work from there.   I really just try to think if I'd be worthy of being a friend to Tonks, Minerva, Luna, or Molly. Having so many amazing female role model characters.. I wish that happened more often in literature and the real world.

HogwartsRP,3acmco,king_kalamari,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:43:40 2015 UTC,"Born in Los Angeles. Moved to Literally Hell Tucson, Arizona after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Managed to survive being stranded in the desert for over a decade. Turned 18, nope'd outta Arizona, moved to the Dallas, Texas area for college. For the past 10 years, I've moved all over Dallas/Fort Worth.    I've been to Mexico and Canada. I much preferred Canada. My favorite vacation ever was a winter cruise up to Alaska (and visiting parts of Canada). I looooooove winter weather, and the landscapes up there, especially the glaciers, are beautiful. Alaska would be a wonderful place to live, if it weren't for all the damn Alaskans. You think Texas rednecks are bad? Oof.    My other favorite vacation spots include Mission Beach in San Diego, California. Most of my childhood summers were spent there, and I'm still in love. It's not the prettiest beach, it's not the most remote beach... but it's HUGE and tons of fun!    There's also Torch Lake, Michigan -- ""America's Most Beautiful Lake."" And it's true! The cool thing about Torch Lake is that the shallows extend far, far out into the lake, which means you can walk in just waist-deep water for miles. And it's crystal clear! There's a sand bar at the southern end where everyone walks to, with volleyball nets set up, grills, etc -- all in shallow water!    I've also vacationed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Florida can eat a bag of dicks. (There was an incredible Peruvian restaurant down there, which saved the vacation!)    Aaaaaand the most impressive vacation spot on my list is Hawaii. I've been to Kona and The Big Island. I think I preferred Kona. The 9 hour plane ride from LAX gave me a bit too much anxiety, so as great as Hawaii is, and I'm eternally grateful for the experiences, I think I'd honestly rather not visit again. (I DID eat at the geographically southern-most restaurant in the United States, which is kind of neat. And swam with giant sea turtles. And got in a lot of trouble for swimming with giant sea turtles -- how was I supposed to know it was mating season??? And got drunk at a Luau and jumped onstage with fire-dancers and danced and embarrassed my mother, which was a huge, huge bonus!)    I think that, when I retire, I'd like it to be Torch Lake, Michigan. I'll spend my summers jet-skiing, and my winters snow-skiing. Like God intended."

Narrowing it down to just three songs that define Professor Moon was extremely difficult. In a way, I think that's a good thing, because it speaks to his complexity.)     Gortoz A Ran - Denez Prigent The words ""In the dark shadow of rain towers / You will see me waiting forever"" (English translation) speak to Professor Moon's eternal love for and dedication to his family. Obviously this is a sad song, and it's all about Moon's sad past still affecting him in the present, as he awaits the future. Like Real People Do - Hozier This song is much more hopeful and romantic, but sweeping and dramatic. The lyrics ""Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips / We could just kiss like real people do"" represent Moon's strong desire to rekindle the relationship with his wife, and have a return to normalcy with her. This goes hand-in-hand with Gortoz A Ran, because despite the sadness, he holds out hope and dreams of the day things are better. Henry Nearly Killed Me (It's a Shame) - Ray LaMontagne This song is an absolute perfect fit for Professor Moon. I'll direct your attention to the lyrics, ""Just because you can knock a man down doesn't mean you got him beat,"" to really drive home Professor Moon's ambition and tenacity. Not only was he nearly killed in his past, but recently he survived the attack on Hogwarts, too! He'll do anything -- anything! -- to survive, really: he needs to, for his family. So if anyone wants to kill him, they better succeed, or they'll regret it (""It is a crying shame!"") Not to mention this song also describes Professor Moon's propensity for blues music, and his generally flippant, upbeat nature when he's not dwelling on his past."
HogwartsRP,39wqet,elphieisfae,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:03:18 2015 UTC,"great question.   Augustana - Sweet and Low. Aptly describes her, aptly describes her needing to be with Alyssa to stay sane / not turn absolutely insane.  David Wilcox - The Nightshift Watchman - the song is about a man who in the midst of the cold war is on the overnight shift making sure that a nuclear bomb isn't incoming and what happens if he has to push the button. Not what you expect from a folk song!  I Stand - Idina Menzel - ""And I don't know what tomorrow brings A road less traveled, will it set us free? 'Cause we're taking it slow, these tiny legacies I don't try and change the world But what will you make of me?""  Bonus song: Kate Miller-Heidke - The Last Day On Earth -   ""In my head I replay our conversations Over and over til they feel like hallucinations You know me, I love to lose my mind (it's the last) And every time anybody speaks your name I still feel the same I ache, I ache, I ache inside (day on earth)"""

But this song really seems to typify them for me because they've been together almost a year (omg).  ""Runaway darlin', won't you stay with me Now, I will back you up""  Muse - Butterflies and Hurricanes  Probably because it's my favorite Muse song, and it aptly describes my her drive to want to do great in everything and her fatal flaw of perfectionism."

Kate really does want to chase the sky. She wants to fly really fast, and really high, and just be free.  Forever Young- Alphaville ""Forever young, I want to be- Forever young"" This is self explanatory. I chose this because it's basically how Kate wants to live her life. She wants to live her whole life fast and free.  Champions- Fall Out Boy ""Some legends are told, some turn to dust or to gold, but you will remember me, remember me for centuries"" Funny story, I heard this song on the radio after the Legends game was announced and thought ""Oh my god, this is a theme song for the Legends game"" So yeah, that's why I picked it.

I don't think it's actually about Oedipus, so lets not be squicked XD but this song has a few parallels with Elsa and her feelings towards her mother. Elsa wanting to be someone, wanting to be notable, and the very little positive (or even negative) attention she would get from her parents. The mother in the song is rather passive, though,where Petra really wasn't. ...I have Petra songs too.   Vienna Teng- Stray Italian Greyhound  ""What do I do when every 'no' turns into 'maybe'?""  I feel this is Elsa's ""meeting Wesley"" song. It's so sweet and upbeat, and perfectly describes that initial ""What the hell? this isn't something that I do!"" feeling Elsa had when she started falling for Wesley.  Now,listen, this was hard because 98% of the music I listen to is Audiomachine and Two Steps From Hell....and tango, and instrumental soundtracks...I...I have very narrow tastes in music XD So I have like a ton of theme music for various scenes, but very little in the way of defining songs :c"

While the other team tries to stop them. Then you've got the beaters. Which are two players on each team with small bats that are used to beat back these great balls of lead, those are called bludgers, at the other team's chasers-- Now, keep in mind. These bludgers are also flying around at high speeds trying to unseat as many players as possible. So they're a right bloody pain in the arse. Then you've got the keeper. One team's keeper guards the hoops on one side, the other keeper guards the other side. Their job is to make sure that no quaffle whatsoever gets into the hoop. And finally you've got the seeker.

HogwartsRP,38olz2,bshef,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:57:43 2015 UTC,"There was a sort of government I had developed for a different roleplaying game. People who could cast magic were known collectively as mages. Magic was only permitted in the kingdom by mages who officially registered with the Magi, the governing body of mages.    From there, mages were organized into different levels. Mages without any formal training were called ""robeless,"" and they generally did their best to blend into normal society. Mages could go seek elementary training at a variety of public and private schools throughout the kingdom, and earn Brown Robes and the title of ""The Brown"" upon successful graduation. This usually started around the age of 5, up through the age of 10. Chiefly, kids would be taught to control their magic, and learn basic, useful spells, as well as the fundamentals of how magic works. While most mages were happy achieving Brown Robes and then going out to find a profession, some fell in love with spellwork and wanted to further their magical education. These would go on to the Mage Academy, which generally lasted 7 or 8 years, depending on the student's aptitude. Upon graduation, they'd earn Gray Robes and title of ""The Gray."" These were highly skilled wizards, witches, sorcerers, and warlocks, having mastered many spells and techniques. They could likely cast many more spells in a day than Brown mages. Grey Wizards have the opportunity of earning White Robes and the title of The White. The Magi council would come up with a special project, such as inventing a new spell or reclaiming some long-lost artifact or removing an ancient curse. Once a mage earned White Robes, they were welcome to sit on the Magi council, or teach at the Mage Academy.    The Magi council consisted of every White mage, and decisions were made by voting. Each year, an Archmage would be elected. They wore special silver robes, and their job was to vote as tie-breaker, and represent Magi for the Kingdom. Essentially, the Kingdom treated the archmage as a prince, and White mages as lords under the prince.    Specific jobs, such as Treasurer or Head of Law Enforcement, were fluid at best. Like the archmage, these jobs would often change year-to-year. Mages actually like this, because it makes it extremely difficult to seize power.    Mages who did not agree with Magi, however, would simply move beyond the borders of the Kingdom. Many of them would wear bright red or green robes, to demonstrate that they had received education at the Mage Academy but were not loyal to Magi or the Kingdom. It was a common misconception among commoners that Red or Green wizards were evil; Magi and the Kingdom happily left them alone.    Necromancy was strictly prohibited by Magi, however. The King granted Magi the authority to seek out and capture or kill necromancers even beyond the borders of the Kingdom. This facilitated the need for a special unit of Ranger Mages -- a very controversial decision."

Any students endeavoring to fight with him are told to stay behind him, moderately spaced, wands pointed in alternating directions, so as to provide full cover for their little ""unit""    He passes the rubble and crumpled bodies, checking each face to see if they were Hogwarts or enemy.    Suddenly, he sees a flash of red clothing dashing around a corner.  He picks up the pace, a lightning spell already forming on his lips. Just in the nick of time, he sees the enemy wizard point a wand at a student pinned down behind a cracked, stone column... And Professor Moon sends the white, arching lightning bold at the wizard.    There's a flash and a shower of sparks as the lightning spell strikes true, and in an instant, the enemy wizard is left motionless in a heap on the floor, his robes blackened and smoldering where the electricity struck him.    The Great Hall is clear and safe. Keep your head down, and run there, and meet up with your Housemates, he says to the trembling student. She takes a deep breath, and obeys.

He issues a curt order to the statues Defend Hogwarts. Prioritize students!

But then he walks over to the Slytherin table, climbs atop it, and clears his throat.    Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls... The Fable of the Three Sisters.    Three sisters came to a man,   Down by the lake where he liked to stand.   They said, ""There's a boat on the shore,   With a gas lantern and one oar.""    ""Go to your home, across the sea,   And tell your mother not to weep for thee.   Leave your worldly things beside the lake,   For beasts to trample and birds to take.""    Said the man, ""Tell me your names,   Since you've told me why you've came.   I've heard tell you're named by men,   And as a man you should tell me then.""    ""I am Love,"" said the sister with the fairest face.   ""All men have want of me, and for my gentle embrace.""    ""I am Wealth,"" said the sister with the glittering eyes.   ""Most men would kill for me, to claim me as their prize.""    ""I am None,"" said the sister with a dark black hood.   ""The lonely know me, the rich desire me, for as well they should.""    ""With one of us, you must sail,   It's always been and always will.   Though nobody's told you so,   Make your choice, then away we'll go.""    The man said, ""I've no need for a friend to love, For I am blessed by God above.""   The man said, ""I've no need for gold,   If I'm to leave things as I'm told.""    And so the man cast two sisters out, And went with None, without a doubt.   ""Surely,"" said the two, as they went their way,   ""You won't miss us after today.""    To to the boat, the man was led, Looked it over, and suddenly said, ""We must prepare this boat before!   For we need oil to see our way, and another oar.""    The sister None simply laughed from the shore.   ""Wealth can buy you oil, and a friend can man an oar.""   When he had finished, Professor Moon takes a deep bow, and then a long drink of coffee."

HogwartsRP,382o0o,bshef,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:32:23 2015 UTC,"Professor Moon came into the school extremely naive. He was very excited and wanted to be involved in everything -- he didn't fully understand the dangers facing the school. He's since come to understand, however, and he's also gotten a little bit better about what not to say and whom not to say it to. His social weirdness continues to make interactions with the other staff... well... weird. (But of course, this is partly due to having his head messed up somewhat by a misfired memory charm in his recent past.)    I couldn't have predicted how he'd changed. Personally, this is my first Reddit roleplaying experience so I've had to learn some customs and rules and lingo, which worked out great in Professor Moon's case because he had to learn a lot of new customs and rules and lingo as a new teacher, too!    Moon hasn't really had an opportunity to truly address his flaws or show off his strengths -- he's only been around for a couple months. But watching characters develop is one of my favorite things about roleplaying, so I'm always keeping an eye out for rich opportunities for Moon to grow."
HogwartsRP,382o0o,elphabaisfae,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:38:45 2015 UTC,"Amiera has learned more spells. She was much more confident in the beginning of the year than she is now; maybe confident is the wrong word. Because of the bullying she's kind of withdrawn a bit; it has just deepened her resolve to want to become an Auror, though.  Her weakness is Shaun, and she'd do anything for him.   She still doesn't understand why she has gotten all the accolades for Quidditch, though. She just likes to play.  And no, not necessarily in this way, but it's fun to play a younger kid."
HogwartsRP,382o0o,ElmaNore,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"Elsa started 2015 knowing that six months of near constant bullying via harassment curse were over. But her mum had just died and her sisters were missing. Plus Wesley had been kidnapped.   I sort of expected all of this to result in her getting into more trouble than she had last semester, to be honest. But when I sat down to rp, it only made sense that she'd get into less trouble. The issues from last semester were almost entirely because of that curse. She spent the first month of this semester simply depressed and feeling horrible and lonely, and then angry for being so pathetic.   In addition, all of the studying that she did, all of that potions work... That was all focused on either lifting the curse or treating the resulting aches and pains. Her failure in removing it had completely wiped out her confidence in her abilities as a witch and as a result, her actual abilities suffered. Certainty in success really does matter.   This semester was sort of a breather term, I suppose. I wanted to do something big, but with the main plot picking up, I saw little room for it. She's been slowly regaining her confidence and skills in spellwork. There was a point this semester where she saw little value in potions, but that's changing. She's been processing the type of person her mother was. Getting used to the idea of both of her parents being gone. There are a few big steps I want her to take, but it's been tricky getting her there."
HogwartsRP,382o0o,Assassinsayswhat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"Oh where to begin... Jordan got spattergroit over the break and had to take a couple months off, when he came back he was excited to continue school and see Kate and his friends again. He.. wasn't too thrilled when he found out Kate had cheated on him and he felt even worse when Wesley got banned right before the match against Ravenclaw vs Slytherin match began. He also began to theorize on his own that Cromwell did not care for Ravenclaw's team and would rather ignore them. This is what caused him to be rather bitter towards his Head of House and made him lash out during The Reckoning post.  As for his lessons, he's shown some great improvement in his spell casting both verbally and nonverbally while knowing he's good at it. Since the season ended he has had much more time to study and made some serious progress.   Jordan seems to come off as an arrogant jerk who is way too full of himself and not half the wizard he thinks he is, he doesn't get along with some of the other sixth years, and he failed to surpress his attitude which costed him his accolades. Now he barely has any chance at becoming Ravenclaw Captain again, has withdrawn into his studies even though exams are over, and he had lost some serious drive to play quidditch for his final year.  Honestly, I didn't expect him to become what he is now. His dignity has deteriorated, he's emotionally withdrawn, and he's detested by most of the other students. He was supposed to be someone you could count on to be rational about any issues that came up,to be responsible and to be both a good influence as well as a talented leader. He also was supposed to help keep the order and make sure everyone was well taken care of. Things didn't really turn out well for him this semester and I hope he can turn things around over the summer or during the next school year."
HogwartsRP,382o0o,Wesley_Drayton,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"This character of mine....is something else.   I feel like he has made a turn for the worse this semester, he came back bitter towards Cromwell because he didn't understand how with all her power and resources she could not find him and he began to have thoughts on whether or not she even cared if any of her students were missing. He has improved in his spell work and learned a few new spells but he has yet to truly prove himself in action.   I can't say he has grown much besides becoming physically taller more talkative. He hasn't worked much to address his weaknesses either and when he tried got pissed off and decided that he wasn't the problem, it's everyone else. He has little respect towards his elders(mostly the Aurors), he is bitter because he is banned and sometimes wonders if he'll ever fly again, he is seen by the staff as spoiled, bratty, pig-headed, insolent, and arrogant. Although deep down, he knows he is wrong for this and that he knows better. He isn't entirely willing to swallow his pride because he feels it's all he has left.  I didn't think he would stoop this low over the semester, he arrived feeling a mix of emotions after a few days at home and now he feels mostly anger and sadness. Anger because his words and actions totally him over and sadness because he believes he will never receive any acknowledgement or approval for any good he does regardless of how hard he worked. I didn't plan his development to go this way but I intend to make sure he gets more back to his old self during his time in the States."

The fun part is, she's much MUCH darker than I originally had her. Only really Michael is keeping her from being as dark as Bellatrix."
HogwartsRP,382o0o,Wesley_Drayton,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:39:32 2015 UTC,"Vesper has gotten much more withdrawn, much like when she first came, only now she behaves more cheery and smiley. When she opens her mouth, she really doesn't care if she hurts any feelings.  She's lost all of her friends and doesn't care if she gains any more. I'd wanted the carachter to gain some empathy, but with the way drama club went for her (multiple people ripping up or burning her flyers right in front of her), she sort of dove head first into just not caring."

HogwartsRP,382o0o,Ravencleverindeed,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:00:30 2015 UTC,Slytherin and Ravenclaw are probably the 2 closest and hard to choose houses.  In actual Hogwarts she was far much more bookish.

She hates that a professor decided to use students to advance an agenda at the beginning of the school year, and that all of this could have been avoided if those in charge were less arrogant.   She feels rather excluded from everything as a professor, and took it personally that someone with less time at Hogwarts was made head of house over her. She's bitter, and has added it as yet another failure. At 34, she feels she has run out of time to actually do anything with herself.   But she loves her students, creatures or not, and will do her best to keep them safe."

HogwartsRP,36s2xz,elphieisfae,1 point,Thu May 21 17:52:42 2015 UTC,"Professor Moon read this newest Daily Prophet from his hospital bed with a growing sense of unease. A sudden reversal? This made him highly suspicious.    With a grunt, he got up, dressed himself, gathered his things, and told the nurses he was releasing himself. He didn't stick around to hear their protests.    He heads towards the Great Hall, hoping to run into someone to talk to. Preferably one of the Aurors. Hell, even someone in the Owlry Trio probably can answer some of his questions.    The 'monster' was obviously the Acromantula. But how are any of these killings related to the anti-creature racism? And how does someone like the Minister stand to profit from kicking out less than a dozen people from Hogwarts?    Unless... Professor Moon doesn't normally like jumping to conclusions, but he had plenty of evidence at his disposal. So he thought to himself  Unless the killings, by a creature, are to drive the anti-creature racism. Which in turn allow the Ministry to seize the opportunity to take over Hogwarts, using 'creatures' as a mere excuse. But the Aurors have been alluding to other killings: PERSONAL killings.     So what's the difference between the random, old or sick people killed by the creature, and the specific murders being investigated by the Aurors? Not money; whomever is architecting this probably already has plenty. If Power is the universal motivator, and money is no object in this context... that leaves... information?    Knowledge is power, certainly. So obviously someone's trying to get into Hogwarts for information. Some old archive? Something the Aurors know?     He realized he had been muttering to himself as he wound his way through the corridors. It was a frustrating feeling, making so many connections but not being sure where it would lead. Maybe he was close. Maybe he was way off.    He hoped he bumped into someone to talk to before his headache forced him to retire with his thoughts for the night."

The three of them and our current Headmistress were all then put under close watch by the Ministry and soon people around the UK started calling for her resignation.

Then our old  Headmaster was sacked, a new Ministry-appointed Headmaster came along but he got run out of the school by Cromwell after trying to expel the three students as well as muggle borns and half-bloods.

Hopefully some sort of tragic something or another will happen to which the revolting muggle sympathizer between now, and then tomorrow when the class was scheduled to take place. She could only hope.  She knew literally nothing about brooms, their brands, and she really did not care in the slightest. The grade was important though, and since she had taken no flying course, or anything related at Durmstrang, she doubted there would be any transfer credit leeway. Of course she had plenty of elective credits that would take its place, but still. Nothing to supplement the fact she had only flown a few times as a child, and since then had never touched a broom since.

HogwartsRP,351vag,elphabaisfae,1 point,Wed May 6 15:10:08 2015 UTC,"He nods Most third-year Transfiguration spells do involve animals. However, I must point out that when you transfigure an object into an animal, it doesn't TRULY become a living thing with a soul; and likewise, you cannot even cause it pain during the process unless you intentionally warp your spell in a cruel way.    So would you be willing to attempt the Lapifors spell, transforming... er... He picks a toy tin solider from the basket this little guy into a rabbit. Done correctly, you'll find you can direct the rabbit's actions with your wand, and allow the rabbit to revert back into the toy soldier when you release the spell.    Then you can show me a Switching spell, I think switching an apple and an orange twenty paces apart should suffice. And finally, let's see... we'll try a slightly more difficult version of Match to Needle: See if you can get a lit match to transform into a sewing needle before it burns out. First years learn to do this with unlit matches, and the difficulty increases with the addition of the flame to manage -- it should be a fair challenge, but one I believe you can handle."

Though it still wears the toy soldier's tin hat. You realize you have a sort of mental connection with it, able to think simple commands like ""forward"" or ""turn"" and have it obey.    Professor Moon chuckles. Not bad. Working with animals is tricky. Once you release the spell, you'll find the rabbit will quickly revert to a toy solider once more."
HogwartsRP,351vag,d1m0nsrcha2001,1 point,Thu May 7 12:12:53 2015 UTC,"She makes it walk around, then stops and releases the spell on it so it reforms into a soldier.  Okay... what next?"

I have no idea what became of my custom one from my days as a student... it's been close to 15 years since I last saw that thing. Groundskeeper probably had it destroyed.    But I'm older now, and wiser, and I can certainly do an even better job. Even though I'm starting from scratch. It probably won't be a match for the latest Firebolt... but it'll fly me from point A to B without dumping me on my ass.

I'll leave the broom in my office while I'm out and about, and you can work on it there in your spare time.    It's a lot more complex than simply waving your wand, though. It's much more similar to engineering a car. First you need measurements... precise details of the object's properties. Then you design everything -- deconstructing common spells into their individual components, and reconstructing them to fit the object.    For instance, last week's ""Citra Verto"" was a modification of ""Vera Verto,"" so it worked to transform lemons into glasses of lemonade, instead of animals into water goblets.    The broom will need to hover, and land. It will need to fly forwards, backwards, side to side. It will need to turn. It will need to balance. It will need to accelerate and decelerate... You get the idea. Each of those functions requires a host of spells imbued into the broom, and made permanent, to boot!    If you're up for it, I'll waive all your Transfiguration homework in place of this project.    He smiles, very glad indeed to have some help"

HogwartsRP,34c6xu,d1m0nsrcha2001,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:00:22 2015 UTC,weeelllll  kind of did a similar thing on pjrp and the amount of time that was put into it... i worked less at my job in 2 weeks than I did on that tournament.
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,elphieisfae,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:27:33 2015 UTC,How about a Biwizard Tournament....with Potterplay.
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,Elmalilalimes,2,Thu Apr 30 01:59:00 2015 UTC,Great Caesar's Ghost.... it's possible.
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,Ravencleverindeed,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:01:41 2015 UTC,"No, it's actually not.   Sorry, there's an issue where my character actually had to leave PPRP because of some OOC issues with some people there that... were very less than satisfactory. left an 8+ month storyline because I felt threatened."
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,elphabaisfae,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:16:15 2015 UTC,"hmm....are you why Emerald left? She said something while she was here about having to leave when certain people show up or she'll turn into a cow. (her words)  I guess that's what happens when a sub has too many ooc resources. People start really talking to each other ooc and realize they really don't like each other. Then it spreads....QuadHouse tournament? The other schools were nuked, and that's why we can't invite them."
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,Elmalilalimes,2,Thu Apr 30 02:50:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah no I was here when Emerald left.  She was never one for mods or having to follow the same rules as everyone else. And her ""cow"" comment is simply a ploy she still uses for sympathy and pity."
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,elphabaisfae,2,Thu Apr 30 14:10:15 2015 UTC,"Emerald left here because of a disagreement with plot and mods. She left of her own Accord and that's really all there is to say about that.   No this dealt with another sub and the fact I was told some very Awful things that as a human being I wouldn't put up with, much less someone I don't know. Too many kids (I'm 35 within a month, i use it accurately)  spout their mouth off with no repercussions or actual understanding what they do. When I legitimately feel threatened, and then when I air my thoughts to the mod team and get blown off, it's not the place for me anymore.   I'm not going to comment further as I have no want to relive this drama. People make their own decisions,have their own subs and lives, and the world spins slowly on its axis."
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,elphieisfae,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:48:18 2015 UTC,I could see doing a house tournament modeled after the triwizard.  But we'd need a LOT more students for that.  maybe next year.. that would give us the summer to figure out logistics and stuff.  this could work.  steeples fingers
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,bshef,1 point,Fri May 1 12:33:57 2015 UTC,I just wish there were more students :) (I always liked when teachers seemed exasperated by all the student shenanigans)
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,d1m0nsrcha2001,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:11:37 2015 UTC,That's what Kate's for :P

HogwartsRP,34c6xu,Assassinsayswhat,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:35:16 2015 UTC,Really? Kate never struck me as the type of person with a mischievous streak.
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,d1m0nsrcha2001,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:24:14 2015 UTC,"She used to be when she lived in Ireland. Her cousins had quite the influence on her, I'm trying to get her back into her trouble-maker stage. It's kind of fun to RP"
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,Assassinsayswhat,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:31:59 2015 UTC,A Groundskeeper and Caretaker would be nice.
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,Elmalilalimes,2,Thu Apr 30 01:13:19 2015 UTC,"Funny enough, we used to have one. Long time ago.  He was an ass. Enough said."
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,Elmalilalimes,2,Thu Apr 30 01:14:09 2015 UTC,"I thought he was supposed to be an ass. That seems fun to do. Snitching on everyone. Actually, ghosts would be fun for that too. Dude. We need a peeves. And I second more students :( I want more students :("
HogwartsRP,34c6xu,MsMastodon,2,Thu Apr 30 01:16:03 2015 UTC,I meant he was an ass OOC.
