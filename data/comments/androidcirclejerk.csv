androidcirclejerk,3dkduy,cutestrawberrycake,0,Fri Jul 17 10:49:27 2015 UTC,It works 5% of the time if your phone works after drying in rice it would have survived even if you just had it laying around. all the minerals in water is gonna rust and corrode the insides of the phone.
androidcirclejerk,3dkduy,Whyareallthegoodname,0,Fri Jul 17 15:34:07 2015 UTC,"I'll say it in short sentences in hopes of my message penetrating your thick skull. Rice absorbs water. Water goes away from insides of phone. Phone has chance of surviving. If phone is left being wet, phone will surely break. It's ridiculous to assume phone will rust because it was wet once. And you're fucking retarded if you think the minerals in water cause rust."

I've been reading up the specs of their Galaxy Alpha phones and was annoyed they had a battery of under 2000mAH, when phones their price or cheaper have batteries with more capacity than that. The Lumia 640 has a battery capacity almost identical to the S6, even though it's a mid-range phone, and even LG are doing a better job with their G4c and the Spirit."
