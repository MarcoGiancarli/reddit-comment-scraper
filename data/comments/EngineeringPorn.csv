EngineeringPorn,3e1c0s,azza10,10,Tue Jul 21 10:16:20 2015 UTC,You're going to be killing your bit if your taking off 5mm unless the feed rate is very low.  Ultimately it's how much material volume you take off versus tool life.

EngineeringPorn,3e1c0s,YouMustChill,0,Tue Jul 21 12:02:58 2015 UTC,I didn't say you can't.  I said there is a trade off between volume of material coming off versus tool life and the material being cut as well as the cutter material is also important.  The depth is just one dimension which then needs to be multiplied by the feed rate to get you volume.
EngineeringPorn,3e1c0s,Szos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is completely wrong.  Kennemetal CNMM-RW geometry can do 0.500 radial DOC at 0.050"" per rev, 200+fpm and there are certainly others.   If you don't know and you're not willing to look it up, don't bother."
EngineeringPorn,3e1c0s,DeleteFromUsers,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:09:37 2015 UTC,Did you seriously miss the part were I stated depends on the material being cut and the material of the cutter?   You ain't doing this with HSS and expect to have any real tool life.
EngineeringPorn,3e1c0s,Szos,0,Tue Jul 21 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"Also wrong. You can take massive radial DOC with HSS tools as long as you drop your surface speed a bit to compensate. Often enough it's more efficient to make fewer passes with a slower surface speed than more with faster (i.e. roughing).  Metalworking runs on percentages, not absolute numbers like 5mm or whatever.  HP and rigidity are what's important here."
EngineeringPorn,3e1c0s,DeleteFromUsers,0,Tue Jul 21 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"So you drop your surface speed which means you removing less volume of material which is what I've said like 3 times already,... but somehow I'm wrong.  OK."
EngineeringPorn,3e1c0s,Szos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:06:00 2015 UTC,"Well no the modest drop in surface speed would not cancel the benefit of the deeper DOC hence a benefit of taking bigger DOCs and fewer passes. So you are indeed literally wrong. EDIT: For instance fine finishing cuts might be taken at 120sfpm for HSS tools in mild steel. Medium/finishing cuts might run at 100sfpm. Very heavy roughing cuts of any DOC could be taken a 60-80sfpm. Those roughing cuts could be 1.5-5x greater feedrate and 2-10x greater DOC than medium finishing (and even greater multiplier than fine finishing). So the increase in volume is obviously much greater  Feedrate is limited by the tool's clearance angles which then limit the edge's strength i.e. more clearance = weaker tool. So if you want a strong edge for long life, you can boost your volume by massively increasing your DOC which requires only a modest reduction in surface speed.  I don't understand why you're arguing here. It's a simple numbers game and a heaver DOC, correctly run, will increase your material removal rate all else being equal. There's no debate, unless literally everyone has been doing it wrong for 200 years?   You're going to be killing your bit if your taking off 5mm unless the feed rate is very low. Ultimately it's how much material volume you take off versus tool life.   You said this. I gave you evidence (it's in the Kennemetal catalog) to precisely the contrary. Do you have independent evidence which supports your position? If not, best to let the guys who do this for a living explain the situation."

EngineeringPorn,3dqxsu,06Wrangler,8,Sun Jul 19 03:33:55 2015 UTC,IIRC if they didn't tie them down properly without being folded while at sea they had a habit of breaking their own wings at the root.
EngineeringPorn,3dqxsu,Sasakura,21,Sat Jul 18 18:37:32 2015 UTC,Oh they can rotate the entire wing assembly (or whatever it's called)? I thought they can only rotate the propellers. That's cool.
EngineeringPorn,3dqxsu,ReasonablyBadass,16,Sat Jul 18 17:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the nacelles rotate for flight, while the propellers, nacelles, and assembly all rotate/fold for storage."
EngineeringPorn,3dqxsu,Shaex,4,Sat Jul 18 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"The wings rotate in a vertical axis for storage on aircraft carriers. They do not rotate in a horizontal axis: when transitioning between VTOL and forwards flight, only the engine nacelles rotate.  Have a look at NASA's GL-10 Greased Lightning prototype if you want to see a true tiltwing.  (A tiltrotor is less efficient in a hover than a tiltwing, because the wings ""get in the way"" of the downdraft. However, it is at less risk from crosswinds.)"

EngineeringPorn,3dqxsu,ReasonablyBadass,5,Sun Jul 19 12:30:55 2015 UTC,"It is powered by gas turbines, specifically a pair of Rolls-Royce turboshaft engines.  (A turboshaft is just like a turboprop, only not directly connected to a propeller. In the MV-22's case, the engines drive a complex transmission system with a shaft going through the wings to allows both proprotors to be driven by a single engine in the case of an engine failure. This was probably included because a survivable autorotation landing is much, much less likely than in a conventional helicopter, and because of the possibility of the whole thing flipping over due to asymmetrical lift.)  Anyway, I presume you actually meant ""why don't they use turbofans"". Probably for the same reason a C-130 doesn't; namely that they perform less well than turboprops at low speed and altitude."

EngineeringPorn,3dndc4,ChrisVolkoff,10,Fri Jul 17 21:30:53 2015 UTC,I think it would only be of matter in cases where the winds are so high that hollow cylinders are more prone to vibrating and creating minor vibrations in wind flow around it. Depends on material as well.

EngineeringPorn,3dndc4,stygarfield,12,Fri Jul 17 22:15:45 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain what the captions mean? It doesn't mean much to me.   What's your background?  Edit: By ""what's your background?"" I wanted to know where to start from.  The Reynolds number is ""a dimensionless quantity that is used to help predict similar flow patterns in different fluid flow situations."" In this particular case (cylinder in cross flow), it is equal to ρ*U*D/μ = U*D/ν, where ρ (rho) is the density of the fluid, U the speed of the flow, D the diameter of the cylinder, μ (mu) the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and ν (nu) the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.  Depending on the value of the Reynolds number, you can predict if the flow is going to be laminar, turbulent, or in between (transition).  Laminar flow (lower/lowest Reynolds number) is ""when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between the layers.""  Turbulent flow is ""a flow regime characterized by chaotic property changes."" It includes ""rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time.""  A von Kármán vortex sheet is ""a repeating pattern of swirling vortices caused by the unsteady separation of flow of a fluid around blunt bodies."" You can use some formulas to predict and find some characterizing properties depending on the Reynolds number.  It is important to note that the behavior of the flow (laminar/turbulent) may not be the same everywhere. In that last image, the flow reversal/flow separation is what can cause lost of lift and stalling with airplanes.  Hope that helps."
EngineeringPorn,3dndc4,ChrisVolkoff,3,Fri Jul 17 22:09:21 2015 UTC,The hollowness indeed does not affect the airflow. A hollow cylinder is just a normal cylinder with a smaller cylinder cutout from it.  They Reynolds Number is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes airflow ( as seen in the video/gif ). It's main purpose is to compare small windtunnel models to large real life objects as a similar Reynolds number means a similar aerodynamic behaviour.
EngineeringPorn,3dndc4,Shitting_Human_Being,6,Fri Jul 17 23:02:11 2015 UTC,Would it matter if the cylinder was hollow or not?

The transmission angle cannot be adjusted dynamically so it it can't be used as an acute universal joint.  It takes up more space than a two or even three gear box.   If you can come up with a compelling application for this great, but by looking at the joint, it doesn't appear to improve of even match existing solutions."

EngineeringPorn,3d8xb3,moretorquethanyou,12,Tue Jul 14 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"You could put the 45-degree gear face at the far side of the input (?) shaft.  in other words, the output shaft would cross over the center of the input shaft and connect to a gear on the far side, not the near side."
EngineeringPorn,3d8xb3,mike413,2,Tue Jul 14 19:58:11 2015 UTC,"Good point, such a configuration would net you the same rotational ""polarity"" as this device with only two gears."
EngineeringPorn,3d8xb3,moretorquethanyou,7,Wed Jul 15 00:37:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on the perspective.  If you look in the direction power is being delivered, these are rotating in opposite directions and bevel-geared shafts would rotate in the same direction."
EngineeringPorn,3d8xb3,thyratron,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:47:34 2015 UTC,True. Couldn't they be made to rotate in same direction if the piece that moves up and down were two pieces that hinged about that shaft? This would also allow the two shafts to be at another angle than 90* (I think).

He would design by a gut feeling, delegate that, and then engineers under him would spend hours double checking and confirming what he did in a few minutes.

EngineeringPorn,3d08qk,Kiwibaconator,2,Sun Jul 12 12:07:52 2015 UTC,Interesting. But has some big problems current bikes don't.   The single sided swing arm is going to twist and flex too much.  The suspension is pivoting around the bottom bracket which makes for extremely mushy pedaling and it looks very heavy.
EngineeringPorn,3d08qk,hwillis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:20:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with the flexing, especially if he slides at all there is going to be a ton of torque on the back wheel.  That swingarm will need to be way, way stronger to compensate, at least 20x than if it was on both sides."

EngineeringPorn,3czkcn,paulhammond5155,3,Sun Jul 12 11:13:52 2015 UTC,"The SR-71 is, to me, for sure the greatest plane ever built.  I highly recommend reading Skunkworks.    That TEB he mentions for the ignition system is nasty, nasty stuff.  It autoignites at 20 C below, burns at 3000 C and boils at 95C(meaning, it has to be stored nearish to the cockpit).  Its necessary to ignite the JP-7 (Jet Propellant 7), which is intentionally hard to ignite as the tanks can get up to 300C.  Its a very careful mix, which is unsual- gasoline, oils and jet fuels aren't really a mix typically, they are just pulled at different points in distillation.  JP-7 is so hard to ignite you can hold a lighter to it to no effect.  JP-7 has a ton of additives, for extra lubrication, to add some mild self-oxidation for a little extra oomph, and A-50, which obscures the radar and infrared signatures of the exhaust.  There isn't a single part on that plane which isn't a marvel and an engineering masterpiece.  Skunkworks was a bunch of guys running around asking each other for the impossible, with Kelly Johnson at the top dispensing genius and expecting it from everyone on his team.    So the fuel is stored in tanks that reach 300C.  The fuel itself reaches 180C.  The outside of the windshield gets to 260C, and during normal operation the inside of the windshield is 120C, again obviously requiring special glass.  Don't touch it.  The cockpit is kept at... 60C, I think?  Cold enough to make a noticeable heat gradient in the cockpit.  Without a flight suit you would 1) not last long and 2) feel like you were sitting in front of a stove.  That massive amount of heat gets dumped into the fuel before it gets burnt using an absolutely MASSIVE heat exchanger.  It caused them a whole lot of headaches before they said fuck it, lets just do it.  Its powered directly by a bypass from the compressors.  The air in the compressors is 400C.  Any problem at all in heat exchanger would kill the pilot in seconds, if not instantly.  They are kept cool by air at 400C, moving heat into fuel that is hotter than the cockpit.  Its witchcraft.  They tested the thing by putting it inside a giant furnace because they wanted to be 100% sure it would work.  Because its terrifying.    And thats just the air conditioning system.  THIS PLANE IS SO COOL"

EngineeringPorn,3czkcn,PilotKnob,8,Sun Jul 12 16:08:45 2015 UTC,"The SR program wasn't born out of ambition to ""go faster""... it was because the U-2 was capable of being downed, and the US needed a platform that could outrun Soviet anti-air.

EngineeringPorn,3co48e,SergeantTibbs,11,Thu Jul 9 16:06:35 2015 UTC,Might be a variably tempered coated steel?  Hardness is related to brittleness so a relatively softer tooth with a hard work surface would allow a lot of flexing instead of just shattering.
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,Jaracuda,6,Thu Jul 9 13:39:30 2015 UTC,I was guessing more tungsten carbide teeth
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,SergeantTibbs,9,Thu Jul 9 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"That could be prohibitively expensive.  Plus while tungsten carbide is an astoundingly hard material, it's also brittle and would be more likely to just snap instead of tolerating the inevitable abuse machines like this will take.   It's great within its work envelope, but get outside it and it'll fail catastrophically."
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,Jaracuda,2,Thu Jul 9 17:10:08 2015 UTC,Is there a reason hardness is so related to brittleness? Does the amount of carbon make it harder or softer?
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,JViz,4,Thu Jul 9 17:14:21 2015 UTC,"Hardness, strength, and toughness. You get 2 of the 3. Hardness is the refusal of a material to deform to pressure. Strength is the refusal of a material to continue to deform once it has started to deform. Toughness is a refusal of a material to weaken and retain the deformation.  Metals that are hard and strong are usually brittle, and when they fail, they crack. You can also have hard and tough, like spring steel, which is fairly hard and tough, but deforms easily. Some non-metals are good examples of strong and tough, but not hard, such as delrin and carbon fiber."
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,Greatfish,2,Thu Jul 9 18:02:42 2015 UTC,can you give some examples of everyday metals that have these qualities? Just so it makes more sense in my head
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,kenofthesea,3,Fri Jul 10 03:45:54 2015 UTC,"A chef's knife. It has to be hard enough to take and hold a good edge, but tough enough that if you flex it a little bit it won't snap. A knife that is too hard will also tend to chip along the edge when sharpened. This happens a lot with ceramic knives. They'll hold a good edge for a long time, but will eventually chip, and then they're too hard for most conventional sharpeners to make a dent."
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,Kiwibaconator,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"That's an oversimplification based on plain carbon steels.   There are plenty of hard, strong and tough steels.   Source: mechanical engineer."
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,JViz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:12:40 2015 UTC,"Sure, but for anything you have, you can usually work/age/heat harden it at the expense of toughness. There's usually some kind of trade off."
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,Kiwibaconator,2,Thu Jul 9 20:16:20 2015 UTC,No.  Strength and toughness are obtained through refined grain structure.  The alloys in the high strength alloy steels are there to pin the grain boundaries and dislocations to stop them growing and softening the material through the usual processing.
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,SergeantTibbs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:52:32 2015 UTC,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardened_steel  During hardening and quenching, carbon sets up in the material as martensite, which resists bending.  However this makes the material more likely to fail through breaking rather than from bending.  So you temper it, which reduces hardness but improves toughness.  If the metal is hardened and tempered in different areas, you can end up with a strong but slightly flexible shaft to a tooth but a very hard edge.  This gives the properties of having a tooth that can punch through material, without subjecting the shaft to so much stress that it would break. The tooth shaft will ""give"" a bit instead of breaking."
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,Kiwibaconator,0,Thu Jul 9 18:46:08 2015 UTC,The brittleness only relates to plain carbon steels at high harshness.  High strength alloy steels don't have that problem.   Source: mechanical engineer.

The former is, relatively speaking, much more brittle than steel, and it just fractures when it's put under enough pressure, and the latter is a lot softer than steel, so a hardened steel tooth can just rip it apart. The teeth on these machines do wear down, and have to be replaced/resurfaced regularly.   All that said, it's fucking awesome."
EngineeringPorn,3co48e,thefattestman22,2,Thu Jul 9 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"Engine blocks aren't actually that tough. They're mostly cast metal that isn't heat treated. No tool steel there. I'd be more worried about stuff like connecting rods that are made of forged, hardened steel."

So this just encouraged me to test my 2 pairs of cheap calipers.  Up first was the Amazonian ""True Power"" pair that showed 14 microamps while either on or off.  Second up was my Harbor Freight pair that showed the same current draw.  This was interesting to me since the HF pair seems to eat batteries while the True Power pair doesn't.  I'm going to let it sit for a while and see if it enters a sleep mode or anything.    I let it sit around 20 minutes and no change.  Just perception I guess that it doesn't eat batteries as fast, unless it has a lower cutoff voltage."

I will say this though: No watch company marketing videos ""extensively"" cover engineering, including that one. It's a shame for those of us who really would want to see it, but we are not the intended audience. The engineering work is a large part of each company's proprietary knowledge base so they will never share their hard earned lessons with outsiders.  I will say that it is one of the longest videos I have seen put together that has some neat scenes of manufacture, finishing and assembly. Very few watch companies do so much work in house.

It should be noted that if the shutter is blocking the screen for half the rotation, half of the lightbulb's energy is blocked/absorbed and is wasted. This both heats the projector, and means twice the output of the lightbulb (a bigger, hotter bulb) is required for a given image brightness.  My initial guess would be most manufacturers reduce the time the shutter blocks by speeding up the film movement. However, the faster you move parts, the more wear you cause.

EngineeringPorn,3cb9bu,ArthropodOfDoom,11,Mon Jul 6 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"In addition to that, it's usually a leak between the oil in the turbo to the intake piping which pulls oil from the motor and injects it into the air stream.

One of my least favorite assignments was visiting a customer that had the engines in tractors used to prepare natural gas drilling pads. You could sometimes get a gas leak in the area, including a hydrogen/sulfur compound that was highly poisonous (and also extremely flammable). The operators were worried about the engines running out of control if there was an ambient leak so their mechanics installed butterfly valves in line in the intake tubing. The theory being if the engine ran out of control they could yank a wire in the cab to close the valve and kill the engine.   Of course, we told them that if there was enough of that gas in the air to run the engine out of control the operator would have been dead 10 minutes ago. We were there in the first place because installing that valve fucked the intake tube pathing and they were complaining of lower power output..."

EngineeringPorn,3cb9bu,unhedged,5,Tue Jul 7 08:26:08 2015 UTC,"Not sure why I got downvoted since I'm a railcar mechanic and know what I'm talking about, at least for trains in the US.  Anyways, railcars' brake systems require a constant supply of air to operate and to stay disengaged. They operate on air and air alone.  Every car on a train is connected to each other and the engines in a continuous, unified system. Each car has its own valve block mounted on the ""B"" end of the car (usually). The block has a service portion and emergency portion that regulate the incoming air pressure and control the brake cylinder(s). When the air supply is removed and pressure is lost, the emergency portion of the brake system engages automatically. This is a great safety feature in case cars uncouple unexpectedly, which does happen. Railcars are ridiculously abused throughout their lifetimes and inevitably end up with leaks in their brake pipes and brake systems. If the air pressure gets too low from one of these leaks, that can also cause the emergency brake to engage.   So obviously the supply of air is pretty important to conductors and engineers. If a car's brakes lock up while they're traveling it can do serious damage to the car and rail, and potentially cause a derail. In the US, every locomotive has an air compressor and the vast majority are run off of the drive shaft of the diesel engine. So to ensure they have a good, reliable air pressure that can overcome any leaks, they will pull with one or two of the locomotives and use one of the others as a giant air compressor, and dedicate all of its engine's power to supplying air, especially on very long trains or trains with a lot of damaged cars and leaks."

I should've worded that better, they need the air to operate and keep the emergency brakes from engaging en route.   When we switch they never bleed off the air, they just uncouple and let the hoses break away, which throws the emergency brake. When cars are sitting on our tracks, their brakes are always engaged. When we have to move an individual car, we always have to manually drain the reservoir and brake cylinder.    That being said, how do y'all keep them from rolling? Just the handbrake and chocks?"
EngineeringPorn,3cb9bu,peese-of-cawffee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:47:28 2015 UTC,Just chocks and brakes on the rail to slow them down while coupling.

EngineeringPorn,3cb9bu,SocialForceField,3,Mon Jul 6 20:27:07 2015 UTC,"It might be burning its oil due to a leak, in which case it might continue running until its out of oil or the whole thing just goes boom..."
EngineeringPorn,3cb9bu,gnartung,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:05:12 2015 UTC,So there's no actually off switch for this?? I'd imagine you cant unhitch the engine to get away from the fire?
EngineeringPorn,3cb9bu,SocialForceField,3,Mon Jul 6 21:33:40 2015 UTC,"It's not really on fire. It's unburnt fuel making it out of the engine and igniting in the exhaust.  edit: Just to add, once it starts pulling fuel from places other than the fuel tank (like an oil leak) you've got very limited options on shutting it down, and none of them include the ignition system."
EngineeringPorn,3cb9bu,elephant7,2,Tue Jul 7 00:40:01 2015 UTC,"That's one of the un-fun things about diesels. They're compression-driven, so no ignition system. When a diesel engine ends up in a runaway state like this, it's quite frequently because it's burning something other than the normal fuel, most usually the oil lubricating the engine.   The only real options then are A) Dump pressure to keep combustion from occurring, B) Chill the system to the point where combustion doesn't happen, and C) Starve out the other thing needed for combustion: oxygen.   As you might imagine, cutting the air supply is generally the only practical solution. This is why anyone with any diesel experience learns to keep something big, thick, durable, and just flexible enough to seal an intake at hand whenever working on an engine.   Another early lesson is to never, ever, put any bits of yourself in front of injection nozzles that are hooked to a system that can possibly have pressure applied. Not really related to this, but very much worth noting."

EngineeringPorn,3cb9bu,bbqroast,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:21:54 2015 UTC,"If something breaks and the oil that's meant for lubrication starts entering through the intake of the engine, it will act as a fuel source and run the engine.  The way diesel engines work is unlike gasoline engines you may be used to, where a spark plug is required to fire for every combustion cycle, and thus the combustion cycle can be cancelled by turning off the electrical.  In a diesel, the previous cycle ignites the following one, so if there's fuel present, turning it off isn't as simple as turning off the electrical.  At that point, the only way is to choke the engine by preventing air going into the intake, which I imagine is pretty damn hard to do on a train like that.  On a diesel truck for example, if an engine begins to run away, a mechanic is supposed to try to clog the intake with a wet rag or something, from what I remember reading a while ago."

EngineeringPorn,3bz9an,bzzeigler,5,Fri Jul 3 21:17:51 2015 UTC,"Internal wastegates bypass the turbine. The whole point of the wastegate is to stop making more boost. Untenable or external wastegate, doesn't matter, it diverts the exhaust some where other than the turbine.    External wastegates are typically way louder due to the fact that they tend to just dump to atmosphere, rather than being routed back into the exhaust system just after the turbo.    Internal wastegates are dumped right back into the downpipe after the turbo, meaning it will be muffled by the catalytic converter and mufflers (provided they exist in the exhaust system)"

EngineeringPorn,3bmmir,ZioTron,0,Tue Jun 30 18:55:28 2015 UTC,"/u/iDev247  actually IT IS A VIDEO  Being a video a sequence of photographs taken at a predefined time interval (24fps =1/24th of a second apart, 30fps = ..., etc..)   You have to sync the capturing rate (fps) with the rotation rate (rpm/60) to capture the rotating object always in the same position.  That will not suffice anyway because you need to phase the recording (change the starting recording time) otherwise you could end up seeing the object in the wrong rotation (eg. only the blocking part).  You obviously need a special camera for this since the lathe rotate at rates that are not usable with consumer grade camera, or as /u/ultramarine8 pointed out you can ""do yourself the job of a shutter"" with a stroboscopic light.  But check this experiment where there's water resonating under a 30Hz sound wave filmed at 30 fps:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uENITui5_jU   half the time the cut would be obscured by the solid half of the cylinder   videos are not continous in the time domain, they are discrete in the form of pictures, it would be half the times if the recording is set for a rate that doubles the rotation rate."
EngineeringPorn,3bmmir,ultramarine8,3,Wed Jul 1 00:20:52 2015 UTC,"You don't need a special camera or anything if you use stroboscopic illumination.  As long as your lathe is only illuminated at a certain phase of the rotation, any video with a decently long shutter angle will have the rotation ""frozen""."
EngineeringPorn,3bmmir,ZioTron,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:16:24 2015 UTC,I think you're mostly right.   decently long shutter angle   I think you meant bigger? or you were talking about shutter speed?  the shutter angle depends on the fps and shutter speed..  shutter angle = (fps) x 360/shutter speed  so you would need a shutter angle of 360° and a stroboscopic light in sync with the rotation.
EngineeringPorn,3bmmir,truetofiction,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:37:09 2015 UTC,Any angle of 180° or greater would work.  You would only need a 360° shutter if the light was not in sync with the camera.
EngineeringPorn,3bmmir,ZioTron,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:56:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, maybe I'm getting this the wrong way, because I find my knowledge to disagree with your statements...  If I have a camera with a 180° shutter angle, wouldn't it mean it would be open on half of the frame time?  How could you be sure the rotating piece would be in sync with the shutter?"
EngineeringPorn,3bmmir,truetofiction,2,Wed Jul 1 06:45:44 2015 UTC,"You're right.  At 24 fps and a 180° shutter angle, your shutter speed would be 1/48th of a second.  The other 1/48th of a second is used to advance to the next frame.  Though I think you're thinking of this the wrong way.  In this example, shutter speed doesn't matter.  Since the part is lit with a strobe, your shutter speed is limited by your flash duration (~10,000-30,000th of a second, depending).  For the camera, that means the entire frame needs to be exposed in that duration.  If the shutter angle is narrower than 180°, only a slit of the frame will be exposed during the flash duration.  This is the same reason still cameras with a focal plane shutter have a ""sync speed.""  To sync everything you would run the strobe pulse off of the camera's timing output, and then it would be easy to adjust the lathe's RPM to match by eye."
EngineeringPorn,3bmmir,ZioTron,2,Wed Jul 1 07:29:36 2015 UTC,That's what I wasn't thinking of:   it would be easy to adjust the lathe's RPM to match by eye   We can adjust the RPM!!!!!!! all my assumptions were on an a fixed RPM   Thanks for putting up with me.. I'm tedious...
EngineeringPorn,3bmmir,whitcwa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:45:27 2015 UTC,"You're talking about film cameras. Video cameras which I use (broadcast TV) have an option for setting the shutter speed or leaving it off. When off, the equivalent shutter angle is 360°. The camera (video or film) does not have to be synced to the strobe, however if the rotation/strobe speed is not high enough you may get flicker. Further, you can't phase lock a lathe to camera sync. The strobe is synced to the lathe, and the camera picks up what your eye sees."
EngineeringPorn,3bmmir,truetofiction,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"You're right.  With a broadcast-level video camera and a 360° shutter angle, the camera would not need to be linked to the strobe.  A film camera with anything less than a 360­° shutter angle would need to be linked to the strobe however, because of the shutter obscuring part of the frame.  You would also have registration issues regardless of the shutter angle.  Flicker is a whole separate issue :P"
EngineeringPorn,3bmmir,whitcwa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:04:55 2015 UTC,The light can't be in sync with the camera. It has to be locked to the rotation in frequency AND phase. Even a lathe with perfectly repeatable electronic speed control wouldn't phase lock to anything.

EngineeringPorn,3bip23,havealemon,2,Tue Jun 30 04:51:09 2015 UTC,"Fourier series:       In mathematics, a Fourier series (English pronunciation: /ˈfɔərieɪ/) is a way to represent a (wave-like) function as the sum of simple sine waves. More formally, it decomposes any periodic function or periodic signal into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or, equivalently, complex exponentials). The discrete-time Fourier transform is a periodic function, often defined in terms of a Fourier series. The Z-transform, another example of application, reduces to a Fourier series for the important case |z|=1. Fourier series are also central to the original proof of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. The study of Fourier series is a branch of Fourier analysis.

EngineeringPorn,3bip23,Bullz-Eye,2,Mon Jun 29 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"That thing is so much worse than it looks. And by worse I mean much better. Also basically all of these things you see with German titles are not ""theme park rides"" as such as they are usually portable and only remain in the same spot for a few days to a few weeks.  Usually these rides are incredibly safe with your whole body being locked in so tighly that there is no way for you to hurt yourself. The most interesting one I have been on is a very simple and in my opinion a very dangerous one. It's essentially a spinning disk with cage walls and benches around the outer perimeter (no roof) and there aren't any fucking belts or other measures to keep you in place. You just gotta grab the cage bars and hope the ride is over before your fingers give out. This disk btw doesn't only spin but can be tilted to be almost perpendicular to the ground. With no safety measures besides an observant operator. It's not one of those ""centripetal force will keep you locked in place""-things either. People regularly go tumbling and the operator will just slow down, wait for them to get seated again and then start the mechanical spinning bull disk back up."

EngineeringPorn,3bernp,Elrathias,13,Sun Jun 28 17:41:52 2015 UTC,The soviets made a lot of cool crazy stuff. Sometimes I wonder what we could have achieved working together.
EngineeringPorn,3bernp,wh3873,9,Sun Jun 28 19:03:49 2015 UTC,"An interesting proposition, with one fault. The majority of advancements whether it be engineering, medicine or whatnot have all been during wartime. We operate at our best when we're under constant pressure. So working together we'd be able to achieve something dramatic but only if we're working towards a cause (I.e. against a bigger force .. like aliens)"

EngineeringPorn,3bernp,duggatron,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:12:11 2015 UTC,"yes, it can do any conversion, just depends on the motor & generator type :) quite inefficient but one of the few means before solid state came along, i had one that stepped between 240VAC to 24VAC 400HZ :)"

EngineeringPorn,3bernp,salty-kraken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:58:38 2015 UTC,"In fixed-wing aircraft, ground effect is the increased lift (force) and decreased aerodynamic drag that an aircraft's wings generate when they are close to a fixed surface.[1] When landing, ground effect can give the pilot the feeling that the aircraft is ""floating"". When taking off, ground effect may temporarily reduce the stall speed. The pilot can then fly level just above the runway while the aircraft accelerates in ground effect until a safe climb speed is reached.   wasn't sure if ground effect was something aerodynamical or just flying below radar."

EngineeringPorn,3bcfr7,terrorobe,2,Sun Jun 28 13:10:54 2015 UTC,Here you go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_amplifier#Basic_principle_of_EDFA
EngineeringPorn,3bcfr7,autowikibot,2,Sun Jun 28 15:12:41 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Basic principle of EDFA of article  Optical amplifier:       A relatively high-powered beam of light is mixed with the input signal using a wavelength selective coupler. The input signal and the excitation light must be at significantly different wavelengths. The mixed light is guided into a section of fibre with erbium ions included in the core. This high-powered light beam excites the erbium ions to their higher-energy state. When the photons belonging to the signal at a different wavelength from the pump light meet the excited erbium atoms, the erbium atoms give up some of their energy to the signal and return to their lower-energy state. A significant point is that the erbium gives up its energy in the form of additional photons which are exactly in the same phase and direction as the signal being amplified. So the signal is amplified along its direction of travel only. This is not unusual - when an atom “lases” it always gives up its energy in the same direction and phase as the incoming light. Thus all of the additional signal power is guided in the same fibre mode as the incoming signal.There is usually an isolator placed at the output to prevent reflections returning from the attached fibre. Such reflections disrupt amplifier operation and in the extreme case can cause the amplifier to become a laser. The erbium doped amplifier is a high gain amplifier.

EngineeringPorn,3b8d55,PsycoHenny,15,Fri Jun 26 20:08:01 2015 UTC,It saddens me to know that all of the knowledge is going away with these older professionals in industries such as this. We need to have more mentorship and programs that bring these people back in from time to time after retirement.
EngineeringPorn,3b8d55,johnjay,10,Fri Jun 26 22:37:07 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think the big issue is the push for kids to pursue higher education. Highschool tech programs are being cut to prepare students for college. There's this inherent belief that without a degree, you won't amount to anything. Our society looks down on those with only a highschool diploma, and it results in a severe lack of skilled tradespeople. It's a shame, because people like this are the ones we should be admiring and emulating.  There's things my father has taught me that no college program or any amount of loan debt could ever do."
EngineeringPorn,3b8d55,scalisee,5,Sat Jun 27 00:50:30 2015 UTC,"Trades pay so much more out of highschool than degrees do, in general, too.  It's frustrating how little the level of respect a skilled tradesman gets these days."
EngineeringPorn,3b8d55,boundone,4,Sat Jun 27 04:23:37 2015 UTC,Skilled tradesmen make a good living get lots of respect . It's the unskilled tradesmen who don't.
EngineeringPorn,3b8d55,superUnknown3,3,Sat Jun 27 19:58:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The thing is, the really skilled tradesmen don't often get noticed because ""everything just worked like we expected it to"". The unskilled idiots who fuck the job up, causing completion of the job of the job to be pushed back and blow the budget are the ones who cause all of the undeserved negative attention. People simply hop into the perfectly functioning elevator at the mall and don't realize what it took to make it and keep it a perfectly functioning elevator.   And some trades just don't don't seem to have many skilled tradesmen. I can't recall meeting a drywaller who I'd truly call ""a highly intelligent person"". Everybody notices when the drywall looks like shit."

EngineeringPorn,3b8d55,johnjay,5,Mon Jun 29 02:27:37 2015 UTC,"These kinds of skills won't go away, he has younger people that work with him that will keep it going I'm sure. And I'm an engineering student, and a lot of my friends and I spend time developing craftsmanship outside of school. Woodworking, restoring cars, repairing electronics, home restoration and repair.   Plus, this generation will pretty much have the first ""high-intelligence robot"" enthusiast communities.  And will basically define the future of autonomous robots as materials and software become inexpensive.   Tech schools definitely need to be seen as perfectly okay option for high-school students. It would help if companies did not link college degrees with upward mobility in companies. There is a bad culture of not promoting someone unless they have a degree, which forces people to get a useless degree maybe not even related to the work, just so they can check the box in an application.   Overall, there will be a decline in skill in some crafts but a boom in others that our parents and grandparents didn't have available to them, which is exciting."

But some of these require a LOT of skill to do, and since they're sadly no longer economically feasible, people wouldn't spend much time maintaining those skills.  There are a lot of stories out there about ""the last master X craftsman is 80 years old and will teach everyone who will listen"".  It is sad.  There are a few people out there who want this knowledge, but they're scattered across space and time (bushcraft folks and homesteaders, folks in third world countries, renfair folks), so it makes sense to convey the information electronically, an Encyclopedia Galactica of sorts."
