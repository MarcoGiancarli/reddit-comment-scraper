ImaginaryHorrors,3cjyvp,ethan_kahn,9,Wed Jul 8 14:31:44 2015 UTC,Reminds me of this comic called planetary by warren Ellis. In one issue the main characters recover a crashed spaceship that's been in orbit for 150 years. They pop it open and discover the remains of Victorian era astronaut crew. Turns out they figured out a means to get into space but never returned and thus no one ever found out about it.
ImaginaryHorrors,3cjyvp,Scoop_Life,3,Wed Jul 8 16:16:43 2015 UTC,I want to read this. Any idea what it was called or who wrote/illustrated it?

ImaginaryHorrors,3cj033,MrMond4y,5,Wed Jul 8 07:49:52 2015 UTC,"Mirror. Thought you guys could use some more Keith Thompson. He has a certain style that I absolutely love, and it's very suited for horror.  Description of Viraemia, taken from his website:   The civilised world lies on its knees, a sickness wracking its body. The affliction causes a necrotising of tissues so perfectly uniform in distribution that victims take on the appearance of corpses long before death occurs due to organ failure or secondary infections. The crumbling remnants of academia swing from fatalistic resignation to maddened optimism in their addressment of what could be done to fight the sickness.   The vast numbers of doctors attempting to stem the tide of infection, invariably falling victim to the malady they treat, have begun to form fanatical extermination squads whose policies are condoned by authority. A notion forms, twisting the tenets of the Hippocratic oath to say that when the oath taker is subject to the half-death of infection they are obliged to spend their lasting days attempting to destroy the source of the contagion. The paramilitary forces formed from the infected medical practicioners find themselves deigned to mete out persecution to the sufferers they were formally treating. Equipped with the leftovers of dissolved military forces, the Doctors' Militia are organised to burn all infected areas and sufferers; a campaign which stalks across blasted lands, mirroring the wave of infection in an addled attempt at backtracking all the way to some imaginary source.   Extensive bombing campaigns start firestorms that incinerate whole cities. Squads of ""scorched earth"" units are tasked with eradicating outlying locales. The distinctive appearance of the plague doctors, the only sight originally associated with any idea of hope, often causes the confused survivors of bombing runs to rush, open armed, towards the oncoming squads."
