baconreader,3e2cdh,alpastotesmejor,16,Tue Jul 21 12:32:46 2015 UTC,Thank you those people who worked hard for this app and giving it away for free (with ads)
baconreader,3e2cdh,nadiatheunicorn,8,Tue Jul 21 16:19:26 2015 UTC,I will not go on reddit without bacon reader. That's how much I appreciate this app. I find the website terrible to read from.
baconreader,3e2cdh,ardymusprime,2,Wed Jul 22 01:11:34 2015 UTC,I'm glad I'm not the only one!!  I don't think I've been on the website in about 2 years.
baconreader,3e2cdh,BioluminescentCrotch,5,Wed Jul 22 02:28:42 2015 UTC,I agree. It's like I buy phones just for this app.

baconreader,3e2cdh,throw_my_meme_away,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:31:37 2015 UTC,I use this app just so i have a reason to have a phone.
baconreader,3e2cdh,roverboy1104,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:43:22 2015 UTC,It's pretty good. I use it on my tablet but I use something else on my phone
baconreader,3e2cdh,thatsmejb,3,Tue Jul 21 20:28:23 2015 UTC,I use it on the iPad and on my android phone. The iPad app is much better
baconreader,3e2cdh,logikfail,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:03:43 2015 UTC,I've used it on andriod ipad and iphone and honestly out of all of them I liked the iphone version the best.

baconreader,3e2cdh,Fapiness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:02:26 2015 UTC,It's a fantastic app with great support and updates. What else can you ask for when you get it free?
baconreader,3e2cdh,BioluminescentCrotch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:40:00 2015 UTC,"I love this app so much! I don't even use the website anymore.  Two quick questions; is there a search function within a post? Like to see if someone has already said what you're about to say?   Second, is there a way to see the shortcuts for typing? Like, how to make links into words, italics, bold, strike through, etc?  I can never remember how to do those and a little guide would be awesome!!  Other than that, amazing app!!"

baconreader,3dyreb,Star_Couch,4,Tue Jul 21 06:25:21 2015 UTC,"/u/gallowboob takes a lot of content from different subreddits and reposts them in other subreddits, including some that are relatively small (like /r/wellthatsucks.)  He is generally hated around Reddit for being notorious reposter and a karma whore.   However, I have grown to respect him for his work in /r/photoshopbattles (this thread is amazing)and his comments in general (he posted a hilarious OC gif in this thread.)  Edit: added links"
baconreader,3dyreb,mrpunaway,2,Tue Jul 21 09:07:30 2015 UTC,Someone who does A LOT of reposting old content

baconreader,3e1qha,CaptainRobotnik,2,Tue Jul 21 07:49:36 2015 UTC,"This is Google's fault. App developers can make a version and declare it to be ad free, then Google basically says ""what's that lol :^)"""
baconreader,3e1qha,Got2Go,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:52:57 2015 UTC,I believe there have been some posts in the past regarding whether you have the premium version you buy in the play store vs upgrading to premium with an in app purchase.
baconreader,3e1qha,chiggawat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:26:50 2015 UTC,I also have this problem from time to time on start up. A refresh usually takes care of it for about two weeks on my note 2

baconreader,3dxwqz,imasickcunt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:03:56 2015 UTC,It's been a problem since 4.4.4 the only way to get around it is to root your phone. But good luck doing that on lollipop.
baconreader,3dxwqz,aHairyWhiteGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:43 2015 UTC,Its an issue (security feature) with android where with since i think 4.2 you can no longer have third party apps save to the sd card without rooting your phone. Its an android issue not baconreader.

baconreader,3dtwuj,boomitslulu,16,Sun Jul 19 12:43:04 2015 UTC,You should talk to imgur about that. The Baconreader devs don't control website ad delivery.
baconreader,3dtwuj,theillien,4,Sun Jul 19 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"True, wasn't sure if there's something in baconreader that blocks pop up ads though"
baconreader,3dtwuj,randomdude21,2,Sun Jul 19 22:09:53 2015 UTC,Despite the fact that you're correct it is disheartening that imgur would allow these things to slip through.   Personally I open links in external browser -  Ghostery which loads pages faster by not loading ads and not letting outside parties track you
baconreader,3dtwuj,bagoowwshh,11,Mon Jul 20 04:43:28 2015 UTC,Hurry! quick! Your phone might have a virus!!

baconreader,3dtwuj,foreveralog,2,Mon Jul 20 02:26:53 2015 UTC,I'm seeing a lot of those too. It's very annoying. Anyone gotten in touch with imgur?
