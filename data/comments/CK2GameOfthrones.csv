CK2GameOfthrones,3e1ztj,Specialist290,12,Tue Jul 21 15:33:37 2015 UTC,"I started off as Jon (obviously) in the AFFC start and joined Stannis in his war for the North. I refused to marry the wilding girl and later married a Morment. Anyway we win the war and I wiped out the Boltons, then I marched south and took revenge on the Freys. After this I marched to Kings Landing and took it. This only got 50% warscore, and the war would drag on until 8307. Eventually we win thanks to Littlefinger who joins us and seiges out enough of the Westerlands to force Tommen to surrender. I then Declared war on Cersei and captured every Lannister I could, putting them all to the sword.   After that I sailed to Braavos and got Arya (Rickon and Brandon having already been found) and married her to Robert Arryn (I married Rickon to Daenerys and Brandon to a Tyrell). Oh, and the lord commander won the war for the Dawn soon after I joined Stannis."
CK2GameOfthrones,3e1ztj,fleetfarx,3,Tue Jul 21 10:08:07 2015 UTC,"Some questions:   Do you need to have the ambition ""obtain a dragon egg"" to get this event? It's never happened to me before either. How and why is Jon dressed so nicely? I want my Jon to look that good. Walder Frey dies almost immediately in every game I play :( And once he does, his next-of-kin declares for Stannis, and I can't march down to the Crossing and behead them all. Any ideas on how to keep my Frey friends alive long enough? In previous patches, I did the same thing you've done (kill all ~80 Freys, leave Walder for last)."
CK2GameOfthrones,3e1ztj,UDK450,3,Tue Jul 21 20:12:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't have the 'obtain a dragon egg' ambition. In fact I was tempted to marry Dany to gain a dragon but decided to not to on the grounds that a Playthrough with a dragon is way too easy (and I hate that she constantly calls you into her wars). It just happened. It might have to do with Jon's traits such as humble and honourable. Who knows.   Jon's dressed like that because of the congenital overhaul submod, which adds new traits, hairstyles, and clothes.  As for keeping the Freys alive, just hope that Stannis is lucky and wins against the Boltons quickly like he did for me. I attacked the Freys on my way down to help Stannis and only with 5000 men since the Twins only have a 200 strong levy stationed there and I didn't want my men to die."

CK2GameOfthrones,3e33kk,Specialist290,2,Wed Jul 22 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"I, for one, quite enjoyed reading this.  You'll make an excellent AAR author with a little practice, and I'd definitely like to see more from you in the future.  A few odd turns of phrase that stood out to me:   The prestige of the duel went to Tarly, and Luthor returned home in good spirits. He knew that he needed one of these magical swords. His new purpose was to find one of these swords and forge it into something his family would hold for generations to come.   ""But"" would seem a little more natural here than ""and,"" given that you're trying to contrast Luthor's loss with his his overall attitude towards the duel.   Luthor was relieved his brother in law was not wounded, but breathed a sigh of relief that he had won. He didn’t let any of the worry show on his face however as he opened the viewplate of his helm and basked in the glory of the crowd’s cheering.   I'd probably changed it to something like ""Luthor was overjoyed by his victory, but also relieved his brother-in-law was not wounded.""  Rearranging the clauses like I've done makes the transition to the next thought fit a lot better, and using two different words to describe his thoughts conveys a much better contrast of the two most important things on his mind in that moment than simply using ""relieved / relief"" twice.  I'm not a real stickler for grammatical perfection, myself, but I thought I'd point those out as examples of how the particulars of the words you choose and the order you put them in can reinforce the overall message if you pay attention to those little details.  To quote Mark Twain:  ""The difference between the right word and the almost-right word is like the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.""  Again, hoping to see more!"

This works pretty well if you are part of the Iron Throne holder's court, less so in more isolated spots like the North.  I think you can also kidnap women and ""Visit Chambers"" once you have them in your prison, but doing this obviously will start pissing people off, potentially starting wars, and I'm not 100% sure if it counts towards that life goal.

CK2GameOfthrones,3dw8lp,Wolf6120,2,Mon Jul 20 02:00:59 2015 UTC,It's actually a Lannister name. Ser Joffrey Lydden was the Andal forbearer of house Lannister who took the Lannister name when he married into the house to continue the line.
CK2GameOfthrones,3dw8lp,One_Wing,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:51 2015 UTC,It seems like it is a common name across various cultures -- there was a Joffrey Velaryon (the family is Valyrian) that was killed during the Dance of the Dragons.

CK2GameOfthrones,3dwvaa,Arizona_Kid,7,Mon Jul 20 05:04:50 2015 UTC,"Look at the supply limit of the provinces you plan to march your army through. Supply limit will tell you the maximum number of troops that province will support without suffering attrition.   Supply limit is mainly based on the terrain modifiers, but also varies based on whether it is a province you control, owned by friendly party, or if it is hostile territory. Disease and winter also cause supply limit to take a pretty significant hit.  Attrition is basically a % of the total troops in that province die (can't remember if its daily or weekly). The % is calculated based on the modifiers mentioned above. This means that the bigger the army, the more you stand to lose through attrition.  Armies also suffer monthly attrition when they are no longer in their own realm or adjacent to their own realm. If you occupy a province, the monthly attrition should not affect you when in or adjacent to the occupied province. There is a bit more nuance to this mechanic, but that is basically how it works.  Armies do not suffer attrition aboard ships."
