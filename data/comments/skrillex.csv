skrillex,3dxfub,LynchMaleIdeal,22,Mon Jul 20 09:43:18 2015 UTC,Ellie Goulding Breakup EP
skrillex,3dxfub,Neutr4lNumb3r,9,Mon Jul 20 13:40:18 2015 UTC,"I love the EP and find it to be a very enjoyable collection of very ""personal"" tunes. They're not bangers, but they're just really feelsy sounding, and both The Reason and Leaving have a really cool chill atmosphere that takes me back to my first summer and winter in university when it came out. More importantly, there's something about those songs that makes me feel like they're special to Sonny too, like they're little windows into more personal parts of his life (as opposed to the over-the-top hard stuff).  ...On the other hand, most people kinda panned the EP for not having any hard tracks other than SBD, which people panned for being a rehash (because most people didn't know it was a dj tool, or what a VIP was because lol wuts electronic music), and then more people shat all over Leaving because it sounded like Burial (even though people go nuts for every other artist that sounds like Burial).   So yeah, my reaction was that it was great, the general reaction was negative. I feel like the negative reception discouraged Sonny from doing more releases like it actually. I don't have any proof of that though, so take it with a big boulder of salt."
skrillex,3dxfub,RayRay_Sugarbutt,8,Mon Jul 20 10:46:11 2015 UTC,I wish we got more of the stuff Sonny came up with in 2012 - 2013 :/
skrillex,3dxfub,theEman40000,6,Mon Jul 20 11:19:43 2015 UTC,"Me too, honestly. I'm not one of the people wishing he'd go back to that sound, because I appreciate his new direction, but I think people might feel better about him moving in this more hip hop and trap oriented direction now if he'd fleshed out his 2012-2013 sound more. There's not very much of it that got released, so as is it's kind of like the briefness of that sound left a lot of people (me included) wanting more of it. And it made the transition to the more hip hop oriented material kind of abrupt, since there wasn't much in the way of a transitional period. Just sorta straight from hard dance sounds into Jack U."
skrillex,3dxfub,RayRay_Sugarbutt,4,Mon Jul 20 11:24:59 2015 UTC,"I was there, it was incredible. I vividly remember watching the Mexico livestream and hearing The Reason and Leaving played for the very first time. Those two and that other ""Bungle"" demo that he played were all so cool, I would've never imagined two of them would be released just a few days later.  12th Planet had actually said on the stream that SBD would NOT be released and I think it was the chat's negative reaction to that which made Sonny decided to release it.  The EP itself was actually due to the fact that they couldn't release the M Machine remix of Middle Finger on time due to issues with getting the Tupac samples cleared again, so they needed an emergency treat to give us instead.  It was so crazy being back on the forums, anxiously awaiting what the surprise would be. Everyone was clamoring about it on twitter. I remember Sonny saying something like ""Hush Nestlings, moments away"" which just made everyone more excited and began to expect a Skrillex release."
skrillex,3dxfub,plasmaticriver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's an amazing story! I wish he'd do something like this again, for the fans - anything really, you know?"
skrillex,3dxfub,plasmaticriver,3,Tue Jul 21 01:34:31 2015 UTC,I'm sure he will. I actually think another short Jack Ü album may be out by the end of the year if not early next year tho.

I just love chilled vibes like that similar to Summit & Fire Away. I had heard Reason from the stream and was fairly glad he released that too, because it's very different and experimental, I love that sort of stuff.

I wasn't and am not into the pre skrillex stuff, such as ""Sonny moore"" stuff, mora etc. Not my thing, gave it multiple tries but it's not my thing. So.. The leaving kinda combinates those little things I could enjoy from the pre skrillex stuff with his stuff right now. It's weird, haha."

skrillex,3dz6oe,plasmaticriver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:03:49 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right it isn't easy at all but it isnt impossible too..
skrillex,3dz6oe,poellemonster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:12:26 2015 UTC,I just mean it's more trouble than it's worth. You don't actually need the drums isolated to remake the VIP. For the first part I'm just pitching the original synth and sidechaining a one-shot drum sample underneath it.
skrillex,3dz6oe,plasmaticriver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:10 2015 UTC,"Haha I'd do exactly the same but I was just referring to the isolation of parts of a mastered record:D There's nothing easier to remake than this vip and I'll gonna do it when im back from Spain and no one did before me.

skrillex,3du3sk,TomLube,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:28:52 2015 UTC,It was one of his favourite childhood films (as it was mine too) so it makes sense to utilize elements from an often overlooked (and horiffically panned) classic.

Besides, most bands have a set list that they stick to verbatim for tours, Sonny at least changes it up massively even if the skeleton is the same..."
skrillex,3dtu0t,TomLube,3,Sun Jul 19 15:13:32 2015 UTC,"Bands do that so they can perfect and memorize it. There's way much more work required to hitting an instrument and staying in tempo with your band mates then mashing buttons. If a band ever goes on the tour, it's always the same set list because that's what they see fit.   All the things dj's have to do is cross fade into different songs. Might as well prerecord it if you're going to play the same stuff. It's apples to oranges."
skrillex,3dtu0t,PimpinPedo,2,Sun Jul 19 15:15:01 2015 UTC,most of the sets I watch online are pretty much the same so I just sort of based it off of that. I bet his private shows are fucking nuts though. all the ones that are just huge festivals are the same sets from what i've seen.

Not everyone likes unreleased Skrillex tracks, people wanna hear their favorites and thata why he uses the VIPs as buildups for the original mixes now.  Also, although his 2013 sets had more unreleased tracks off of Recess and what not at the time, I can honestly tell you that they were not even 50% unreleased Skrillex and VIPs.

Oh who am I kidding....  Promises VIP, Ruffneck VIP, Bug Hunt, WTFIWWY and SM&NS (DnB Mix)... They're ones that still live on his hard-drive, have been played recently within the last 2 years and are probably the most likely to see maybe a release in the future when he feels like letting go of the masterpieces...  I doubt it'll ever happen although I pray for Bug Hunt... That Noisia remix will never be appreciated until we get the original - EVEN THE FILM MIX!

I was hoping it would immediately be hot like fire, but alas it was more sizzling bacon in the pan. I think the Bieber track is just the first bite and we'll get some more cool shit as they become more comfortable and acclimated to eachother."
skrillex,3dtbaw,FunkyMonkeyBanana,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"I think they're acclimated as they'll ever be. I've been following them both on snapchat for months, and they definitely seem like two peas in a pod. I think they're vibing really well, and I'm pumped for the next album and subsequent new set material."
skrillex,3dtbaw,marcopolo22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:22:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Lately they're clicking. Idk who down voted me, but that Jack U/Justin Bieber was prolly recorded a year ago. The rest of the stuff with it was average at best. They weren't synced up. It's one thing to be connected because you're friends or because you like to party together. It's another to musically connect that is synergistic. Very little of Jack U musically has equalled the sum of the two parts separated. Skrillex and Diplo are fuego each on their own. Aside from the publicity is Jack U fuego?  No. It's a cool concept still that we hope pans out.  Snapchat isn't an album. I follow them as well and enjoy seeing them good around."
skrillex,3dtbaw,FunkyMonkeyBanana,2,Mon Jul 20 01:45:13 2015 UTC,"You're right, snapchat isn't an album. But it is a fair representation of their live sets and overall style. I agree that the album didn't live up to what it could have been. I'm just appreciating Jack Ü as a fun collaboration between two buddies who love creating music that makes people dance. If you view Jack Ü with that mindset, the project becomes a lot more enjoyable."

skrillex,3dp8kr,PimpinPedo,8,Sat Jul 18 03:32:44 2015 UTC,Uploaded =/= made  Was made around the Fall Tour in Chicago
skrillex,3dp8kr,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"Are you 100% on this? Again though, Skrillex Album. I don't think he'd be referring to any remix EP either. If it was supposed to be the Jack Ü album, wouldn't he say he has another album coming soon (not specifically ""Skrillex album"") or a Jack Ü album? And he also said ""another Skrillex album"". Jack Ü had never released an album yet (if this was from Fall Tour) so it couldn't be ""another"" Jack Ü album if there wasn't one already to succeed."

skrillex,3dn70c,BioTechnix,4,Fri Jul 17 19:51:45 2015 UTC,NO FUCKING SOLO ALBUM? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
skrillex,3dn70c,LynchMaleIdeal,5,Fri Jul 17 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"No new album, meaning of the Jack Ü name and Justin Bieber will school anybody in anything?  Let's get one thing clear; JB won't school Skrillex at music production that's for sure.  The album comment was quite a heartbreaking thing to read but also contradictory to the interview he did a little while ago. When he says ""album"" does that mean EP as well? So unclear. I can imagine within a month or so everything will change and well yeah...  The amount of songs that have remained unreleased etc proves that a change of mind isn't unlikely."
skrillex,3dn70c,KrazyTrain18,2,Fri Jul 17 17:17:30 2015 UTC,Well that's quite a bit disappointing....
skrillex,3dn70c,BlackMatter2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:14:37 2015 UTC,Wasn't there actually a video a while ago where he said he was working on an album? I think it was a bowling video.
skrillex,3dn70c,chasethenoise,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"He said there was a jack ü album coming out, and some new Skrillex too. But that doesn't necessarily mean a new album. A single, a remix or even a collab as Skrillex fulfill that promise, and we've since gotten that. No single though.   On a brighter note, we can reasonably expect more Jack Ü later on based on Diplo's tweet."
skrillex,3dn70c,plasmaticriver,2,Fri Jul 17 19:15:28 2015 UTC,"He said a ""new Skrillex record"" specifically. That may have not meant an album and just been one of his songs released since then tho."
skrillex,3dn70c,SunderedYT,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah he specifically said ""I've got another Skrillex album coming out soon"" It had to be an album to some extent. I'm not sure what he meant though if he's saying it isn't actually true"
skrillex,3dn70c,plasmaticriver,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:08:37 2015 UTC,It almost sounded like in this interview that he was beginning to work on one but had to immediately stop to focus on whatever else he's doing.
skrillex,3dn70c,SunderedYT,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:31:24 2015 UTC,"Well that's what it sounded like to me too. But read his answer to that question again. He's pretty much saying that this is just a big rumor and he just wants to end it now. And he never had formal plans for an album release, implying he hadn't gotten to work on one yet, which doesn't make sense considering he said a new Skrillex Album was coming soon (After Skrillex and Diplo Present Jack U was released already!)"
skrillex,3dn70c,plasmaticriver,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:35:05 2015 UTC,Maybe the video was recorded even earlier than we thought. Wasn't it BEFORE the Jack Ü album came out? I feel like I remember that.
skrillex,3dn70c,SunderedYT,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:18:39 2015 UTC,"I know it was posted and blew up on April 2015. I've been told it was from his Fall Tour but I'm not 100% sure myself. It is possible it was before the Jack U album, but remember he said ANOTHER and he said SKRILLEX album. Jack U didn't already have an album to succeed and i'm sure he would have specified it was a Jack U album. It just doesn't add up..."
skrillex,3dn70c,BlackMatter2,2,Sat Jul 18 04:29:29 2015 UTC,Maybe he is working on an album or EP and just wants to keep it under wraps. That's very possible too.
skrillex,3dn70c,RayRay_Sugarbutt,0,Sat Jul 18 20:05:04 2015 UTC,"I think he might've been referring to the Jack U album, since it came out not too long after that video"

Track one is just an intro using the Take Ü There chords, track 10 is just Missy Elliot rapping over Take Ü There, which I hardly consider to be a remix, and many of the song have about 45 seconds of filler at the end. There just wasn't as much content as they made you think there was going to be.   Also, what they did to Febreeze upset me for a long time. Whenever I listened to the album, which was A LOT, I skipped that song for probably 2 months because I was just so hyped on the version from the D&F mix and what they ended up giving us what standard festival trap. It did grow on me though, I'll admit.  Besides that everything else is really strong. To Ü is probably my favorite, with Mind being a close second. Where Are Ü Now was an instant classic as soon as I heard it and I'm honestly happy that they made such a big hit with JB of all people.   I also want to add how I still remember the very first time I heard Take Ü There. As soon as I heard that ""Jack Ü snare"" in the drop I knew we had something special. I'm really looking to more from these guys. They're basically the Kanye and Jay Z of the electronic scene right now."

skrillex,3dis7r,MaddManInc,2,Thu Jul 16 16:54:23 2015 UTC,"I remember that day :D I saw/listened about 6 hours of the 18 Jack Ü livestream while working, until i had to go to study. I went back to my house about 10:30pm, tired af, and I was starting to fall asleep when they uploaded the album to soundcloud. I heard 4 songs that night: the intro, Mind, Where Are Ü Now and To Ü. First reaction that night was that Mind was awesome, WAÜN was incredible and To Ü wasn't the Party Mix, but still really good.  Next day I arrived to my work and heard the whole album on sc, then torrented it. I was more amazed by WAÜN, never really liked Holla Out (until the Snailed It Mix's VIP), was really sad because how they changed Febreze and Jungle Bae, and was happy with the final Beats Knockin."

skrillex,3dis7r,BioTechnix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"For me it was pretty much just a huge let down. like most Skrillex releases.  Unlike Recess, I was really hyped for the Jack U album since I liked pretty much all the unreleased songs they were playing live. I knew the songs would get neutered, but not to the extent of completely changing most of them into completely different songs.   The released version of Holla Out is just a directionless clusterfuck and for some reason they felt the need to remove all of the build up vocals that were in the VIP. Which was bizarre since it just sounds so empty without them, that's not even debatable.  Febreeze sounds nothing like the BBC version. If you compared the instrumentals there's barely anything in common besides the drop synth sounding kind of similar to the BBC one.  The really unfitting bass sound that got added into To U is a good example of Skrillex feeling the need to put in some sort of random sounds and percussion stuff into the final version take make it less enjoyable.  Jungle Bae also has almost nothing to do with the VIP, which wasn't that good either, but it could have been the joke track of the album instead of that weird thing they put in as an intro track. It's just so unbelievably bland and generic that maybe it still counts as a joke I guess.  Mind is probably my favorite track on the album.  Beat Steady Knockin got neutered, but I already knew it would.  I liked Where Are U Now at first, but after hearing it on the radio I realized it's just another annoying, repetitive, generic, radio-friendly pop song."

skrillex,3dis7r,lolroflqwerty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:11:46 2015 UTC,"due to the lack of promotion, I went for a whole week not knowing it came out. I found out at work and got home as soon as possible to buy & listen to it. at the same time I logged onto here, and saw the same thread like 'at least we know the VIPs will be released soon!' and I realized that the little mixtape I had downloaded that was ripped from the BBC mix was better than the actual released album. If I had never downloaded that mixtape or anything, the album would be a straight 8.8/10, everything was amazing. Except I had heard the better versions. Only Jungle Bae sounded better than the BBC mix. Currently though, the album remains 7.5/10 because there was so much varying sounds, it was beautiful. I just didn't understand why they didn't release a 'remix album' or something."

Although after the hype has died down with Where are U now, Jack Ü SHOULD be over. They shouldn't try to over extend something so organic.  I'd like to see Sonny go back to his electronic roots and collab with more artists like Deadmau5, Savant, and MUST DIE!, not Vic Mensa and other various rap artists."
skrillex,3dis7r,MostWanted2011,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think. I know for a fact that people have the demos and VIPs for the album, and it fucking pisses me off that nobody leaks them or even sends them around. Whore. Shit. Besides that Mind is my favorite song, Jungle Bae instrumental is better (and it uses that Ragga Bomb arp), Holla Out is OK, not better than the demos (and it uses the All Is Fair arp), To U is really good, Sonny should make more Future Bass, Beats Knockin is weak, even though I like Fly Boi's vocals, the track could've been better, Take U There is an awful mess, and I can't even remember the names of the other tracks."

skrillex,3det5g,BioTechnix,3,Wed Jul 15 18:36:47 2015 UTC,have we gotten any word about whether this is going to be released in the future?
skrillex,3det5g,-Syko,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:42:42 2015 UTC,"no it's not. They lost Snail's parts, meaning they can't make a final master, and there would be to much legal shit for Snails to do it himself. I'm sure he'll find a way to put the entire thing in a mix though."
skrillex,3det5g,MaddManInc,8,Wed Jul 15 19:17:43 2015 UTC,"He could pull a ""7/11"" and "" leak it""."
skrillex,3det5g,marcanin3,2,Wed Jul 15 19:19:30 2015 UTC,How do you know they lost snails' parts? Can they not just master whatever version he plays live?
skrillex,3det5g,captain8ball,0,Wed Jul 15 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"Cuz Diplo said so.  And no. To master it properly, they'd need the individual stems. You can't do mastering on an exported render other than EQ.  Ofc he could just leak the render, but again he doesn't have the rights to it.  All he really needs to do is put the fullish thing in a full studio mixtape like slander did here and people could just edit out the mixing."
skrillex,3det5g,plasmaticriver,2,Wed Jul 15 20:13:31 2015 UTC,When did diplo say that?

skrillex,3det5g,MaddManInc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:26:38 2015 UTC,"Nope, he was full on wanting to release it when I met him. The only reason he hadn't at the time according to him was because he was having trouble contacting Diplo (even when they were both at the same festival)."
skrillex,3det5g,Eagles1000,2,Wed Jul 15 21:33:19 2015 UTC,"Haha, I hope he is. I wonder why they don't like that version. It's more trappy than the released one. Seems like diplo would go for it. At least the second part."

He needs more than just their permission. The labels involved have to agree to it since it's technically they're property too. It's just like if they decided to give out the original mix as a free download in a torrent or something. They couldn't just go ahead and do it, they'd have to get clearance first."
skrillex,3det5g,plasmaticriver,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:02:32 2015 UTC,"But then what about bootlegs? He could just rename it ""snails bootleg"" and drop it for free.

skrillex,3det5g,plasmaticriver,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"First of all, you're not supposed to be able to do that. Smaller artists can get away with it cuz they're labels don't care or they're unsigned.  Like I said, if it were only Snails' track (4 artists involved total) and we weren't dealing with Atlantic, Mad Decent AND OWSLA, it wouldn't be nearly as difficult.  Also, just for the record I'm pretty certain KP were NOT going to release the VIP ever until so many people bothered Rob on Twitter about it that he eventually gave in (even though an almost full studio copy had already leaked and we all could've lived without it and had Baghdad goddammit)."

skrillex,3daa4m,IAmZackTheStiles,0,Tue Jul 14 21:48:43 2015 UTC,Kinda why it's called an edit
skrillex,3d8onj,LynchMaleIdeal,2,Tue Jul 14 11:04:11 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on what you're looking for. If you mean stuff like ""Make It Bun Dem"", a lot of modern dubstep subgenres often have songs with some kind of guitar skank going on as part of their rhythm. Vocals in either Jamaican patois or just with a Jamaican accent will obviously only be present if they've had someone guest on the track. I don't know of many artists who produce it consistently though, just songs here and there from various different artists. If you wanted something more oldschool though, you could try stuff like Skream's debut album, since that was one of the formative dubstep records (since it literally combined dub reggae with 2-step garage)."
skrillex,3d8onj,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:11:50 2015 UTC,"Skream's debut album's fantastic. But I would love more stuff like ""Make It Bun Dem"" and ""Bonfire"" etc..."
skrillex,3d8onj,RayRay_Sugarbutt,2,Tue Jul 14 12:58:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I honestly don't know any artist that makes that type of song as their main style. Hell, the majority of heavy reggae-infused drumstep/brostep/whatever I know is actually by Sonny and KP -- the Ruffneck VIP, Scary Bolly Dub, Give It Up, Fire Hive, etc. You'll find a lot of songs here and there like I said. You might wanna try Liquid Stranger's ""Brass Taxed"" and Snails' ""RDM"", but there isn't a huuuge amount of stuff I know that's got the really strong reggae vibe + horns. Not in modern dubstep anyway, I have tons of ragga dnb and older dubstep with it. If the horns aren't as important, you might wanna check out Habstrakt x Skism x Megalodon - ""Jaguar"", if you haven't heard it already. If all you're craving is heavy sounds + Jamaican vocals, there's also stuff like Must Die! - ""Zipper"", Getter - ""Stomp"", etc... Really, anything the Ragga Twins have contributed vocals to is faring well lately."
skrillex,3d8onj,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:14:04 2015 UTC,"I love RDM! Haha, I know of some other great ones such as Bass Farmers' ""Ruff Rude Boys"", Bear Grillz' ""Praise It"", Pegboard Nerds' ""Pressure Cooker"", etc but yeah would love some more!  That Ruffneck VIP sparked this, not going to lie (its so perfect, do we have a good rip of it!??)"
skrillex,3d8onj,RayRay_Sugarbutt,2,Tue Jul 14 13:24:28 2015 UTC,"lol, you know more than me on this then. In fact, hit me up with a list of songs like this, because I need moar."
skrillex,3d8onj,LeagueBaldoro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:25:43 2015 UTC,"Well that was my list, tbh - hence I asked for more, haha! Although I just found this!  https://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/1dw5qu/looking_for_heavy_bassreggae_dubstep/"
skrillex,3d8onj,SunderedYT,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:09:33 2015 UTC,"This is really cool, though a lot of this seems to be more traditional dubstep. Still not much in the way of stuff in the vein of Bonfire and Ruffneck VIP. :("
skrillex,3d8onj,SunderedYT,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"I know :( Such a shame, Skrillex needs to be bring this back - I feel like 2012 was going to be the year of this kind of dubstep, I read somewhere he was like ""my next album's going to be reggae-infused shit"" which just kills me as I would have DIED for this.  I feel like it's the future of Dubstep. Heavy Skrillstep and Reggae."

skrillex,3d54vx,RayRay_Sugarbutt,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"well, i'd say its just some sort of respect. Its the same thing that i gave this file a password which on the one hand means more to do for me because i have to pm the password but on the other hand i know who can open it and pass it around. I have decided to share this mashup but if i hadnt it would go crazy in my sets anyway so its my thing to give others something that i have worked on. Even if this is technically a remake it took me a least an hour to make drums that sound like something in a live video and in the end get everything to a commercial loudness level. I guess you get what i wanna say:) its my work and as long as the original isnt released i can do whatever i want with it and so is the acapella of that guy r/speeds161"
skrillex,3d54vx,TomLube,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:10:55 2015 UTC,"It's also kinda lame that people are shitting on you for not sharing something someone  else sent you. You didn't say or anything, he might be your friend. But everyone's like ""no lol just give it here""."
skrillex,3d54vx,mgh1323,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"yeah its just dumb and i guess thats the reason why nobody leaks something, because as soon as something gets out there, it is ""worthless"" and just a few people will show real appreciation!"
skrillex,3d54vx,JackU3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"Meh, I don't even care about the value of the track. I was just mainly bothered because the way you put it in your post, it coulda been a close friend who gave it to you or something. And if my close friend gave me something and was like ""Don't give this to people, I just wanna give it to you because we're friends"", and then I posted it everywhere, that'd be really dickish, moreso than just leaking a track by itself."
skrillex,3d54vx,silentxor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:44:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally agree with you but its also that you for example put a lot of work into something and decide to share it and most people think its self evidently to get something they have nothing to do for.. If you refer it on production,.. it takes years of learning to make good music and build a name for yourself but in the end you'll be judged for things like a change in your style or something.. Or DOMO... people would have killed and still would, to have it in good quality but if someone leaked it today, everyone would download it and 2 weeks later it would be the boring old track that everybody got and thats just sad:/"

It just doesn't sound good with Kiesza singing it live in my opinion. I get that they sort of go for a goofy almost old live mtv style prefomance but introducing all the sets with Kiesza singing this song off tune almost every time just seems so.... forced. if you know what i mean.

skrillex,3d3lqi,plasmaticriver,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:05:46 2015 UTC,Remake?
skrillex,3d3lqi,-Syko,-1,Mon Jul 13 23:17:39 2015 UTC,"What, you think he keeps around every project file he makes? Just remember all of the shit he FORGOT about. He forgot about tracks like Rio Hotel, Because and Voltage VIP because they were just little one off tracks that he made in hotel rooms or on a tour bus, nothing serious in his eyes.  If he really did want to make a full song out of it, he would remake it from scratch with better sound design."

skrillex,3d3lqi,risaxis,0,Wed Jul 15 03:34:39 2015 UTC,"It's his opinion vs yours vs. everyone else. He's obviously not an idiot, he's just not doing exactly what you wish he would.  If Sonny did what I wish he would, he would release every unreleased song and get me a job/sign me at OWSLA. Should I call him an idiot because he's not doing that?"
skrillex,3d3lqi,BioTechnix,7,Mon Jul 13 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"It's just the fact that he has a ton of unreleased songs that, even if they aren't ""finished"", they are better than most other Electro produced today, but he chooses to release the same boring, seemingly copy and paste Riddim style shit rather than just throw all his old stuff in a zip and throw it on Soundcloud like Alesia did, or even just make a legit pay for album.  That's why I think he's an idiot.  I'll be honest though, Sonny as an Electro artist, holy shit, godly. Anything else? eh. It just seems like more of the same. I don't hate everything he makes or has made."

Should I call him an idiot because he's not doing that?   I would call Sonny somewhat of an idiot if he released everything he made. It's not like everything he produces is pure gold, even if it is in your eyes. He has plenty of rough demos that never went anywhere and would only be valid decent. Every artist has a quality standard of what they decide and decide not to release. His reputation would tank if he just released every shit he made.  That's why a lot of aspiring artists take down all their old tracks and remixes from their SoundCloud pages after they reach a certain level of attention. They only want the public to see the music that they are actually proud of."
skrillex,3d3lqi,plasmaticriver,-2,Mon Jul 13 14:10:34 2015 UTC,"It didn't get released because he didn't want to release the original mix, not because he couldn't. He's already stated since the AMA that he has no interest in going back to it.  Eveb if he does return for the sequel, he will more than likely be making NEW music, not rehashing old shut from 3 years ago."

skrillex,3d20dr,Nyptane,4,Mon Jul 13 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"100% sure. Its doesn't use the stems, if he WANTED to do an actual remix he could easily ask Alvin for them. Also, the song is 2 years old. But really, it should be obvious that it's just a placeholder sample as the rest of the track doesn't use skyclad in anyway and has all original production. If it were an actual remix, the vocals would come in again later in the song.  Not to mention, it doesn't even use Alvin's actual vocals, just the squeaky ""shining light"" bit.  Also, when 12th Planet plays it he says ""this is brand new Skrillex, untitled"". Obvo not a remix lol"
skrillex,3d20dr,plasmaticriver,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"""try to make it right"" is what the lyrics actually say and yes, they are in fact Alvin. He also used them in Dark Heart."

skrillex,3cyhm0,LynchMaleIdeal,3,Sat Jul 11 22:48:05 2015 UTC,Loved every bit of it and still do.
skrillex,3cyhm0,BioTechnix,3,Sat Jul 11 23:03:22 2015 UTC,"Initially, I was only excited for AIFILAB since I've heard UDJT so many times. Then I heard live rips of it and at first I found it hilarious (previously hearing Terror Squad). Then I became worried that it had been changed (pitch change mid way bothered me). Ended up forgetting about that problem after release since the song kicked ass in lovely 256 Kbps.  I initially only gave Recess, Ragga Bomb, and Ease My Mind a chance. But months later, I started listening to the rest of the album. Stranger was very jungle like. Dirty Vibe was so dirty in a good way. I love the Jazz D&B feels of Coast is Clear.  Fire Away gave me a chilled out feeling like Summit. Doompy Poomp was really goofy and fun. Fuck That ended up being my favorite song out of the album since it was so different and brought Crash Bandicoot memories.  Overall Recess made me realized why Skrillex is himself, and not just a ""Dubstep"" artist featured on MLG montage parodies."
skrillex,3cyhm0,rockstarme10,2,Sun Jul 12 01:37:08 2015 UTC,"I was really excited and still love it.  I was so happy when Fuck That appeared on it because I didn't know it was a Skrillex track until that point, always thought it was Jack Beats or something.  I do wish that he saved Dirty Vibe for the Jack U record and released something else but whatever."
skrillex,3cyhm0,KrazyTrain18,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:02:00 2015 UTC,"Were any of the tracks (minus Try It Out, AIFLAB, Recess and Doompy Poomp) previewed beforehand then?"
skrillex,3cyhm0,KrazyTrain18,3,Sat Jul 11 23:06:29 2015 UTC,Alright here it goes:    AIFILAB - Everybody knew about it and heard it before release in his Fall Tour sets & as the demo version UDJT from the Essential Mix. Recess - Once again everybody had heard it in his sets before release Stranger - Already released on Divergent Soundtrack Try It Out - Already released on Try It Out EP Coast Is Clear - To my knowledge hadn't been heard until release Dirty Vibe - Mostly unheard but it appeared in a Glenjamn video shortly before release Ragga Bomb - Was in all his sets leading up to the release Doompy Poomp - Already Released Fuck That - Only played once prior to release but nobody knew if it was his track or not Ease My Mind - Played out many times prior to release Fire Away - Only played once prior to release
skrillex,3cyhm0,ThisPlaceLooksCool,2,Sat Jul 11 23:14:36 2015 UTC,"The Divergent Soundtrack came out the same day as Recess was leaked/announced mind you, haha - and I get this feeling EMM was played years ago?"
skrillex,3cyhm0,KrazyTrain18,2,Sat Jul 11 23:19:44 2015 UTC,Stranger was played a few times before the leak in his sets as well
skrillex,3cyhm0,KrazyTrain18,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:04:20 2015 UTC,Ease My Mind was played for the first time at HDOTD 2013.  You may have heard it in years prior since the original by Niki & The Dove has been out for a while.
skrillex,3cyhm0,Warau-Chan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:26:30 2015 UTC,"I know of the original but that's kind of awesome! Sparks hope for future releases although how come it was never marked as a re-issue?  I mean blimey people are like ""Skyclad remix is impossible"" but tbh anything seems possible with Sonny haha he could put it out with a slightly altered name and the WTIWWY drop!"
skrillex,3cyhm0,KrazyTrain18,2,Sat Jul 11 23:42:05 2015 UTC,"It just ended up getting released as an ""original"", you never know WTFIWWY could get released with the Skyclad samples as an original too"
skrillex,3cyhm0,Warau-Chan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"I know, I just wondered how that worked and yeah exactly - that would be awesome!  Or again like the new Burial... could be just credited as Skrill & Alvin again and stuck on the album, nothing is impossible! (Anyone notice WTFIWW is the exact same percussion and drums from the Red Lips remix?)"
skrillex,3cyhm0,theEman40000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:45:15 2015 UTC,Fuck That actually played a few times prior to release.

skrillex,3cyhm0,whitem4ge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:10:35 2015 UTC,Coast is Clear got played out once or twice before release too
skrillex,3cyhm0,whitem4ge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:08:11 2015 UTC,We heard coast is clear before released (set) and a version of ragga bomb had gotten leaked.

I picked this file up during in the early days of the sub, fairly sure it came in a zip along with Oceans or something.. I'm 95% sure it's the original export, the 5% of uncertainty comes from the outro having a fade out.. Would be good if someone could shed some more light on this one.  edit: So it's probably a mix rip from an Excision mix, my bad. Still 320 tho, so I'll leave it up here for anyone who wants it"

If deep house and electro house didn't both have the same tempo, they wouldn't be ""house"" anymore. I'm not saying that a tempo makes a genre, but in that particular case it does.

Just like it isn't considered dub-step when it doesn't have a 2-step beat. You need to actually figure out whats what. You can slow down or speed up tracks to those tempos, but they aren't that exact genre when they're produced at a different tempo. They're just some fusion/genre-less track which is fine, but you still wouldn't call it that."
skrillex,3csjrg,plasmaticriver,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"Actually they are. You call that shit ""electro"" if there are no like electro bass and stuff. Go listen to the last album by nadastorm, im pretty sure there are 115bpm and lower tracks."

skrillex,3copgy,TheManTh3yCallJayne,3,Thu Jul 9 16:12:33 2015 UTC,That's cuz bangarang was sort of a surprise drop that be announced like 2 weeks before it came out.
skrillex,3copgy,plasmaticriver,3,Thu Jul 9 15:50:52 2015 UTC,The beginning of the most painful trend ever.   I mean it works.  But it hurts so much.

I asked him once if he has Origins, since he apparently has contact with Barely Alive. He said yes but couldn't share it, then it ended up that he was lying.

I was in Toronto and the sound system was better, acts were a bit more what I personally was into (all DJ sets except for Hundred Waters) and the crowd didn't suck, but the actual sets and music (even from people I wasn't expecting to enjoy like Ferg and Kiesza) was really good.  4-5: Mija & Anna Lunoe  515:545: Hundred Waters  6-645: Tycho  7-730: Kiesza  730-815: ASAP Ferg  830-930: Zed's Dead  945-11: Skrillex"

I doubt I'll be so lucky to be that close this time but the (imo) better lineup makes up for it.   Where there multiple stages like last time? Also were there any opportunities to meet artists and take pics or whatever like there was with Tokimonsta and KOAN Sound in 2012?
skrillex,3cn47z,carterhutton,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:55:49 2015 UTC,I liked the lineup in 2012 more but to each his own.  No. One stage.  Not for public.

skrillex,3cl79a,deeninetysix,2,Thu Jul 9 08:43:27 2015 UTC,"Nah, remixes count as a solo release honestly. Like cmon, at this point the Cinema remix may as well just be a Skrillex song. Remixes can become the definitive version of a track sometimes."
skrillex,3cl79a,RayRay_Sugarbutt,2,Thu Jul 9 09:53:40 2015 UTC,"""Remixes can become the definitive version of a track sometimes.""  Hell fucking yes they can, I totally agree with this. Sonny's remix of 'Cinema' is far better than Benassi's original.  ""Nah, remixes count as a solo release honestly.""  Nope. They count as remixes. Originals =/= remixes."
skrillex,3cl79a,deeninetysix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:08:52 2015 UTC,"Didn't say they were originals. Did say they were solo releases. If no one else is featured on the track and the track's been completely reworked to sound like the remixing artist's style, it's the equivalent of a solo release. It's not an original mix, but it is a solo effort by the artist that sounds like the artist. For all intents and purposes, you're getting the same thing. The only way it can't be is if you define a solo release as being 100% composed by the artist with zero elements of other existing songs, which is, again, more of what an original mix is rather than a solo release. Maybe my original post made it seem like I was talking about original mixes because I mentioned the thing about remixes becoming definitive versions."
skrillex,3cl79a,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:07:17 2015 UTC,"But... Remixes aren't solo efforts? You can't have a remix without an original song. A Skrillex remix of a Benny Benassi song is a Skrillex and Benny Benassi effort. A solo release is a release done solo, with no other artist involved. Remixes can SOUND like the remixing artist, but that doesn't mean that song automatically becomes BY the remixing artist. It's a song BY the original artist REMIXED by the remixing artist."
skrillex,3cl79a,deeninetysix,2,Thu Jul 9 12:11:50 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I kinda disagree. The original artist just gives the remixer the stems and the remixer does whatever they want with it. Thats what separates a remix from a collab. The original artist doesn't actually have a say in what the remixer does, it's the remixer's creation at that point. The original artist just puts it out as part of a remix EP. But like, I don't consider the remixes EP of Recess a Skrillex release, I consider it a compilation release featuring the remixing artists. At that point I guess we just get into differing perspectives, but I think it's a lot more reasonable to look at a remix EP and go ""Sweet, a release from (remixing artist)!"", not ""Sweet, a release from Skrillex!"" or whatever, because it's not full of songs made by Skrillex.  That, and if you wanna get really technical about it, you can't listen to a remix of an artist's song and use that as your basis to say you enjoy the artist. So in that sorta way, the remix belongs to the remixer, rather than the original artist. Like, if I play Diplo's Hot Chip remix I can't be like ""Oh yeah, that's a great Hot Chip song!"", because it wasn't made by Hot Chip, it was made by Diplo using stems from a Hot Chip song, and also doesn't sound like Hot Chip."

But that's probably not gonna happen because it's getting released on remix EP/LP from GTA. But if they pull a Jaded Future and put in several remixes from Skrillex...

skrillex,3cl79a,xTrill,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:49:34 2015 UTC,He's got to like all of them enough to release them though. Skrillex actually said in a interview that he and Alvin Risk made about 7 different versions and scrapped 4 for the EP. Most of the different versions are more 'updates' to the original rather than alternates.
skrillex,3cl79a,plasmaticriver,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:33:24 2015 UTC,You're right but they probably think like 7 finished version. Who knows how many drops they made.
skrillex,3cl79a,xTrill,7,Thu Jul 9 04:08:17 2015 UTC,"My best guesses:  Big Room UK  WTFIWWY  Katie Couric Collab (I know it's weird, but just remember that doompypoomp got released on Recess a year after Sonny leaked it).  As for the rest, I'm really not so sure that they're gonna be on a Skrillex record. Most of the collabs sound more like ""feat. Skrillex"" anyways. The Dillon collab was just released on his EP, the DJ Snake collab is confirmed for his next album and Wiwek confirmed that Killa will be on his new EP after the summer ends.  This leads me to believe that GOH! and the Miami ID will prolly be a double single or something, since Emoh confirmed that GOH! isn't on the Gemini EP and that he would prolly release it later in the summer.  I also think that if the Ape Drums X GTA, MUST DIE!, Jauz and Yellow Claw collabs get finished, they'll be on those artists respective releases as well."
skrillex,3cl79a,plasmaticriver,0,Wed Jul 8 22:49:37 2015 UTC,When the hell did he confirm GOH! wasn't coming out on the EP? :(

Both of them said that Emoh said the exact same thing: GOH! isn't on the Gemini EP and it might be released sometime in the late summer.  They're both very trustworthy people and certainly didn't both make up the exact same response to the same question. I get that people here are sometimes stubborn asf when they don't have absolute concrete proof shoved in front of them (I'm looking at you /u/xTrill), but this is just reality, sk accept it and move on."

skrillex,3cl6ov,Eagles1000,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:57:42 2015 UTC,maybe they lost source tracks/samples in project so that they can finish it
skrillex,3cl6ov,oknoxyx,-8,Wed Jul 8 22:29:04 2015 UTC,"He wasn't bullshitting, you're misunderstanding. Snails has an exported render of the VIP that he uses in his live sets. They just don't have the stems to it any more, so its ""lost"" in the sense that they cant master it for an official release. The only thing Snails could do is leak the render he has, which wouldn't sound finished at all."
skrillex,3cl6ov,plasmaticriver,5,Wed Jul 8 22:30:16 2015 UTC,are you just making that up or do you have a source?
skrillex,3cl6ov,whitem4ge,-7,Wed Jul 8 22:57:03 2015 UTC,"I don't have a ""source"", I draw conclusions based on what I know. Sonny only ever played out the VIP once and neither him or Wes have played anything but the released Holla Out since then. That makes sense considering Diplo said he doesn't have it anymore. Snails might still have it, but THEY lost it. If they don't have the stems, there's not much they could do to release it other than getting Snails to leak an old unmastered render like the ones drops in his sets. Snails is also the only one that showed any interest in the VIP at all, that should tell you something."

It's far more of a stretch that Diplo would flat out LIE about an answer to a question in a fucking ask me anything Q&A. I mean, its an AMA ffs, if he didn't want you to know the truth, he wouldn't have bothered with the question, not lie about it when Snails could obviously prove him wrong.  Either they lost it in the sense that they don't have the project file, or he made a mistake and didn't have the correct information. End of story."

skrillex,3cl0q8,SunderedYT,2,Wed Jul 8 19:04:59 2015 UTC,"His remix of Badman and the version of Red Lips he played in Aspen all sound almost exactly the same.    I really don't get when people say this. They're the same particular style of genre, but they don't sound that alike in their actual compositions. Like, just think of all the old house tracks that are in a certain style. We don't say those are all the same just because they're the same style.  I feel like no one listened to riddim dubstep before Burial, so they just assume they're more similar or some shit IDK"
skrillex,3cl0q8,plasmaticriver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:14:53 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is, the riddim influence in those tracks still isn't enough to make them like the rest of riddim dubstep. Like, let's talk shit like P0gman's ""P0lice"" or Getter's ""Knocked (or his Trenchlords series) if you wanna get closer to what that sound's actually about. Especially in the case of the Red Lips demo, that thing's barely even in riddim territory."
skrillex,3cl0q8,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:33:41 2015 UTC,Haha I know ppl are starting to stretch the term. I have riddim EDM from years ago that sounds nothing like those remixes.
skrillex,3cl0q8,plasmaticriver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that's just what I hear... I know the composition is different for the most part as well, minus the few bars of synths with no beat in the beginning of the drop, which all of them have at some point in the song. I know I'm not the only one that hears this, I remember one big edm site editor was giving Skrillex SO MUCH shit for the Badman remix sounding like the Burial remix"
skrillex,3cl0q8,SunderedYT,0,Wed Jul 8 20:51:03 2015 UTC,"Again, that's just because it was a relatively unpopular genre compared to the other ones. Take trap for example. If I had shown you an average trap track back in like 2012 when it was still new, you'd prolly say quite a few sound the same because they all use the same snare roll patterns and what not, even though they aren't.  Even if its true, if you listen to genres like liquid dnb or prog house, sounding too similar obviously isn't anywhere near a big deal in whether or not its good music.  Hear them live, and you'll notice just how different they really are. It's just not a style like SMNS or FOTY where its totally original never-before+heard bass music that any track that sounds similar would obviously be ripping off."
skrillex,3cl0q8,plasmaticriver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:01:56 2015 UTC,"But did you read the second half of my first post? I love all three tracks! I just think they sound similar but it's really a non-issue if it's good music, and I wouldn't think of it as ripping off it's all by the same artist.

skrillex,3cid69,-Syko,12,Wed Jul 8 03:32:08 2015 UTC,"Skrillex, deadmau5 plus tons of other musicians use ableton so i definitely recommend this. The best way I've found to learn ableton is to read the manual published by Ableton. There's a chapter in the beginning called Live Concepts. Read that. This will give you a basic idea of what the fuck is going on. Then just fumble around a bit yourself, try making a little melody even if you don't quite know what you're doing. You'll get a little bit familiar with the software.      In addition to the manual, there is a help view in ableton and it has it's own interactive tutorials within the software. It for example asks you to load up a template ableton set and you follow along. You'll learn how to use ableton's default instruments, drums, pads, basic compression, eqing a bit, it's really useful. If you want in depth info then continue reading the manual from ""live concepts"" onwards. It's a good idea to read this chapter every month or so if your starting out. Keep trying stuff in ableton, then come back to this chapter, then you'll understand better. To become a music production wizard, read the whole manual (later on i mean, in the long run). Also, ableton has an info view (a little box in the bottom left of the screen), and this will tell you information about anything in the software simply by hovering your mouse over something.     This will teach you your way around ableton. However you will want to use some third party plugins as well. Since you came to /r/skrillex i can recommend some to you. Skrillex uses FM8 a lot. And he uses Massive. He said that he doesn't deviate too much from using these softwares and said that's becuase he can pretty much make any sound he wants with these 2 synths. Massive and FM8 are synths (sound makers/instruments). Then in addition to this he uses third party effects. He uses Izotope Ozone and Izotope Trash, plus more. Ozone and Trash are pretty good so learn these too.      To learn Massive, FM8, Ozone and Trash, the manuals will help as well. However, the manual will only teach you how to use these softwares, which is good and necessary. But to learn how to actually make cool sounds, youtube is the best. And trying to make sounds yourself is the best way to learn.     For Massive, SadowickProduction on youtube has great tutorials on how to use massive, about 20 vids in the playlist i think https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laCzbtTeXxA     So basically, manuals to learn the software, youtube to learn how to make sounds. And the best way to learn is to experiment by yourself :)     One thing I must add is that simply learning these things does not mean you will now be a good musician. A lot of it is about creativity, which can be learnt, but not everyone has it in them. Be aware of this, but also know that it can be learnt. When you’re out and about, make up some melody in your head and humm it out loud or in your head. Melodys will be short at first, but as you practice, they’ll get longer and more complex. Always stretch yourself. Another way of learning melodys is to open up an intruments in ableton and hit record. Midi files don’t take up a lot of hard drive space so don’t worry about recording for a long time. Find a piano in ableton or a flute or even make a dubsteppy sound, it doesn’t matter. Hit record, hit some notes on your keyboard and let your mind go wild and free. Remember, always stretch yourself. Stretch your creativity as far as possible, and there is no limit to how creative you can be. Learning has no limit. Practice, practice, practice.     You need to have a lot of quality control as well. Don't ever convince yourself that what you made sounds good if it really doesn't. And don’t ever release shit music. Take your time and release your songs when you are ready. Look at the reality of things and accept that it takes a lot of time and a lot of pulling your hair out and that your first song will be terrible. In my opinion, you have to make about 100 full length completed songs to be a good producer, and after this whatever you make will be decent and something to be proud of, and maybe releasable.      One last tip. Know your headphones/speakers inside and out. Listen to them a lot and really get to know them well. Listen to other people’s music. know how loud the bass is when you play bassy songs, notice how clear the highs are. Use other peoples music as a benchmark. You don’t need expensive equipment. Just a laptop and headphones is everything you need. Maybe a mic too if you want to record stuff. I think Koan Sound said that a lot of their music was made on 25 dollar headphones yet their music sounded so good becuase they knew their heaphones well. Also I find that listening to songs is an incredible way to learn, such as skrillex’s, deadmau5’s or any good producers music for that matter. Whatever musicians you like, listen to their music over and over and over. Notice what instruments are in the background, listen carefully to how much percussion there is, listen to how many melodies are playing, how the intro was built up, the lead up to the drop, listen to the guitars subtly influencing the mood of the whole track. Listen to songs over and over and really really pay attention.     It will take a few months to get the hang of it, and will take even more time after that to make something you feel semi proud of. Starting is the hardest, so don't give up if everything you make in the first few months sounds like total shit :)"
skrillex,3cid69,OceansOfMossBells,3,Wed Jul 8 13:03:31 2015 UTC,"To add to this, if you're truly serious, don't give up. You will hit points where you feel like you're not good enough to keep producing. You will get discouraged. Don't stop producing. Find inspiration.   Now if you ever hit a creative rut, there's plenty of ways to get out of it. The three I like to try are remixing, recreating, and taking a break. Remixes give you a base to start at, recreating gives you a clear end product, and taking a break allows your mind to clear. During your break, listen to new genres and find new inspiration.

skrillex,3cgeki,JurassicFan,13,Tue Jul 7 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"I have solved it guys, this video has enlightened me. 73,97,99, 107,666 are the alt codes for each individual letter in Jack Ü. Entering 739799107666 on google leads to a lone website. As seen in the site, the sine of 739799107666 is 0.10773835356328. Add every digit and you get 61, add these 2 digits and you get 7, which is Mind (feat. Kai) on the Jack Ü album. If you look at the last song on the Gypsyhook Ep, you'll find Kai sui, which is the Japanese version of Mora. The music video for Mora was released in 2009 and adding these numbers together we get 11, and these we get 2, which is the track number for Mora. So lets round everything up... Our key numbers here are 7 (Mind track #), 8 (Kai sui track #), 2(Mora track #), and 2 again (addition of digits in Mora video release year). So with these calculations we now know that the next skrillex album will be released in one of these years: 2278, 2287, 2728, 2782, 2827, 2872, 7228, 7282, 7822, 8227, 8272, 8722!!! Of course these years exclude the Soon™ variable which not even Sonny himself knows the value of, so lets keep our fingers crossed for 8722!!!"

PWEU was a collaborative project between Skrillex, Diplo, and A Trak, to debut music on their respective labels as well as other things they enjoyed. Sometimes they'd premiere a song, such as Knife Party's Power Glove, other times A Trak would show off his cuts, some days Scattle would bitcrush a popular EDM track, and occasionally a guest mix would show up. It was very much just a mish mash if everyone's favorite music."

skrillex,3cf1vh,iffamies,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:31:25 2015 UTC,"My bad,I get them confused more than I'd like to admit."
skrillex,3cf1vh,iffamies,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:33:31 2015 UTC,It's an awesome mashup for sure though
skrillex,3cc0eg,Epic_MC,27,Mon Jul 6 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"This also kinda defeats the argument that the other VIPs were too unfinished to come out. Like, come on, this is literally the simplest VIP they could possibly put together, and it came out shoehorned into a mashup. But Rio Hotel is too unfinished, Force is too unfinished, Bug Hunt's not finished, Voltage VIP's unfinished... I mean, I get it. Sonny's a perfectionist. He wants to finish tracks properly for them to come out. But this came out, and the way the mashup is put together is honestly awkward as hell, and his only contribution is a drop. If this can come out, why can't those songs be stuck into mashups and put out? Why not just make a big string of Scary Bolly Dubs, if the songs themselves aren't going to be completed? Hell, why does THIS get to come out, but the Imagination remix is unreleased? This whole mini-mix release model going on here raises some serious friggin questions.  Did this one only get to come out because it doesn't sound like his older material? Because the Feed Me collab got scrapped at least once because they didn't feel it reflected their current sounds well enough, despite that being light years ahead of this, even if they half-assed it and stitched the old version on to the second version. I just dunno right now, man. And I'm not trying to come across as ""WAAHHH, GIVE ME THE UNRELEASED SONGS SONNY!!!!"", but like... The entire time I was at least grudgingly accepting that stuff wasn't coming out because he wanted it to be the best it possibly could. But this proves there's an exception to that rule sometimes, so what the fuck?"
skrillex,3cc0eg,RayRay_Sugarbutt,2,Mon Jul 6 19:41:26 2015 UTC,I feel like since there were so many artists involved and not just his label he probably didn't have as much of a say in whether it got released. Personally I don't find it that terrible.
skrillex,3cc0eg,chasethenoise,2,Tue Jul 7 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"It was a Yogi and Skrillex collab and I think they put it together. The others had to be credited, because... well... Their parts were used!"
skrillex,3cc0eg,LynchMaleIdeal,3,Tue Jul 7 01:49:33 2015 UTC,"Except that Sonny's contribution to this collab is, at most, 50% of the drop (that gets repeated twice), maybe the slightly changed intro, and the outro. This isn't a collab. It's just a mashup. It shouldn't even be billed as ""Yogi + Skrillex"", because like a third of this is Moody Good. Other than pushing up visibility/sales, there's no reason it shouldn't at the very, very least just bill it as ""Yogi x Trollphace x Skrillex x Moody Good"". They all contributed the same amount to this."
skrillex,3cc0eg,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:38:33 2015 UTC,"True tbh, but if we didn't get this and they played this out we would have all died for it to be honest..."
skrillex,3cc0eg,LynchMaleIdeal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think it woulda ended up being a Jungle Bae sorta situation. Some people would still want the VIP version, but there'd be a vocal group who'd be like ""Oh, this one. My favorite. /s""."
skrillex,3cc0eg,RayRay_Sugarbutt,-2,Tue Jul 7 22:46:04 2015 UTC,"at least they didn't blatantly steal an artist's song with no credit given and give it out for free as a ""JACK U VIP"""
skrillex,3cc0eg,whitem4ge,5,Mon Jul 6 20:47:37 2015 UTC,??? What're you referring to here?
skrillex,3cc0eg,RayRay_Sugarbutt,7,Mon Jul 6 20:48:40 2015 UTC,The Cinema/Get Free VIP that was just cinema vocals over the Andy C remix
skrillex,3cc0eg,ShotsLotta,7,Mon Jul 6 21:01:13 2015 UTC,"It's not really stealing an artist's song when it's a remix of one of Major Lazer's songs... Like, it was silly that they called it a VIP when its just a mashup, yeah, but cmon. Diplo can't steal remixes of his own songs, much less remixes he himself approved for release."
skrillex,3cc0eg,RayRay_Sugarbutt,12,Mon Jul 6 21:07:01 2015 UTC,I think Sonny may be getting the not giving a fuck and having fun waaay too far..
skrillex,3cc0eg,lightingequinox,14,Mon Jul 6 20:58:48 2015 UTC,"There's a tipping point where it just turns out to be a bad idea. He made his best music when he was hungry and homeless - pouring his heart and sweat into the music.  Recently it's hard to tell if he's still doing that, but I know he definitely still can, and I hope to hear it again one day."
skrillex,3cc0eg,FuckTheZer0,7,Mon Jul 6 21:12:19 2015 UTC,Such a letdown. We wait 3 years for new music and then 1 year for a new music video to an old song. Why not just have us wait half a year longer and premiere the song with the music video? This way of doing things is so backwards and disappointing tbh.
skrillex,3cc0eg,Casualll,8,Mon Jul 6 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is more of a disappointment to me because this video came out, but we never got the music video for Recess, despite it seeming like it was very much so filmed and finished. We get this, and Breakn' A Sweat's retarded vampire robot shark thing, both like a year after the fact, but the Recess video stays in limbo. The fuck?"
skrillex,3cc0eg,RayRay_Sugarbutt,9,Mon Jul 6 19:31:09 2015 UTC,"Watch. 3 years from now he's going to drop a new album, and then he'll hype a new video. It'll be a Recess VIP with Iguana screeching added into the drop. Screen cap this.  <3"

skrillex,3cc0eg,theEman40000,2,Mon Jul 6 21:01:20 2015 UTC,the same with Try it Out we got the single with a cover then it was changed and we got the proper music video later with went with the original cover i reckon the proper music video was actually heaps cooler
skrillex,3cc0eg,PimpinPedo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:26:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you would think he would release the video to promote his album called ""Recess"". It's getting close to a year and a half and he still hasn't released it."
skrillex,3cc0eg,Itacticality,6,Mon Jul 6 23:25:14 2015 UTC,What are we talking about?!
skrillex,3cc0eg,mulquin,2,Mon Jul 6 20:20:37 2015 UTC,Why are people bitching about this? Genuinely curious.
skrillex,3cc0eg,chasethenoise,4,Mon Jul 6 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"Well, they promoted it like it was going to be a whole new track and then it just turned out to be a video VIP of an old track. It's not that big a deal but a lot of people feel let down."
skrillex,3cc0eg,killermicrobe,5,Tue Jul 7 01:40:14 2015 UTC,"Because there are like 100 unreleased  perfect songs collecting dust in Sonny's HDs, but all we get are music videos and countless vips/remixes to his new more average songs."
skrillex,3cc0eg,KrazyTrain18,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:25:40 2015 UTC,Not sure what everybody is bitching about.  The mashup is dope as is the video.  It was a long shot to get a new track anyway so I don't understand the massive disappointment.
skrillex,3cc0eg,DoItMeowX,7,Tue Jul 7 00:59:32 2015 UTC,"Because the one time we ""get"" something, it's low work quality, or a bad stereotypical music video for a one year old song. As compared to Sonny's earlier years, where he put all his work into his music and perfected it till he liked it. This ""VIP"" is absolute garbage. He's letting current music trends as well as the people around him heavily influence him, instead of him just going his own way, and making his own stuff.  IMO, he's putting less and less effort into his music."
skrillex,3cc0eg,xTrill,2,Tue Jul 7 01:26:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's necessarily all Sonny tbh. The only solo thing he's released this year was the Bad Man remix which was very Trollphace esque. The other project he released was Jack Ü, of course with Diplo, which is why it sounds like it does. The latest thing - this. Like 5 artists & more labels involved, I don't think he had much say in whether to release etc tbh. Just remember we haven't had an original mix from him this year, yet."
skrillex,3cc0eg,arixant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:14:59 2015 UTC,we heard the new terror squad from him too.
skrillex,3cc0eg,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:28:39 2015 UTC,"I actually like the VIP drop of the Burial remix better. It's got a bouncier rhythm to it. I'd also say it's a good thing for him to be influenced by the people around him. It let's him grow and expand his style. There's still a very Skrill component to everything he puts out. I'm mostly just mad that this VIP was allowed to come out as part of a mashup, because it means that other VIPs or originals or remixes could come out as a part of a mashup, they just haven't. I love that Sonny's trying all these new sounds, but they need to COME OUT for me to actually appreciate him using them as an artist. It's like if a painter made a shitload of unfinished paintings, then showed them to a few people and burned them. I can't go ""Look at how great this artist is!"", because so much of their best work is unreleased. Luckily Sonny's put out a lot of stuff that's great already, so I still have stuff to be proud of, but it's weird telling people how interesting and original Sonny's music is when half the examples I want to cite are songs that never came out."

skrillex,3ccnxj,KrazyTrain18,7,Tue Jul 7 01:29:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He used to let the audience enjoy the music as they wanted, and his sets were awesome because of it. He made a point to not say things except to ask if everyone was feeling good and to tell us to stop watching the set through our smart phones. I really liked him for that.   Now it just seems like he's too caught up in his own shit and thinks that talking and telling us what to do adds to his sets.   It doesn't."

Bottled water helps because food and stuff is ridiculously priced. Other than that just have fun and don't be a knob :) I hope you have a great time man.
skrillex,3ce8ld,Norakx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:04:18 2015 UTC,Go insane and have a great time!

Bring a bottle of water and sunscreen maybe if it's needed - a hat will also help too. Wear shorts with a tight pocket or perhaps zippable ones. If you're holding down the front row don't be aggressive but don't let people push in unless there's room and you want them in. Don't drink too much liquor (or any at all, if possible).   And have fun dude. I will be there so if you want to meet up PM me and I'll send out an address you can text me from if you have an iPhone. :)"
skrillex,3ccrpp,AMCREATE,26,Mon Jul 6 22:14:59 2015 UTC,"Hey bro, a lot of us on this reddit enjoy Skrillex's new music, his new sets, and the people he hangs out with. And some of us don't... but almost all of us are still here mainly because we love him and support him and want to keep updated on him. A lot of people here might tell you he hasn't changed, which is not true. In the past years you have to understand he's learned a lot of things and been inspired by a lot of new people. His inspiration from deadmau5 and 12th Planet has changed to Diplo and Trollphace, and will continue to change for sure. A lot of us have theories and speculations as to why his style of music is changing or why he hasn't released or finished certain tracks, but at the end of the day remember there is nothing we can do about it. We can all spam his youtube or twitter or even get backstage passes and run up to him and be like ""dude! release this or go back to that"" but it has a lot to do with 1. his inspiration, people he wakes up everyday to see and hang out with and 2. The EDM scene in general. He is always part of what's new or promoting people that are. The EDM scene right now is very different now than it was five years ago, and it will be even more so in another five years. He might change up his style to something even more obscure, or try to go back to his roots, but we don't have control over that.  Just remember that it's music, and if you don't like his new stuff, listen to his old stuff; it will always be there. Remember that no matter how different he seems today, he's the same guy that made My Name is Skrillex and Scary Monsters and First of the Year and Bangarang. A lot of his new music I don't like so I'm always listening to the older stuff as well, remember there's nothing wrong with that.   And remember he tweets and stuff everyday, right now he is living it up and is happy and is working hard to promote other artists. That's something a lot of fans of other artists don't have the privilege of having, you know? A lot of the most famous and renowned artists are dead! We will never hear new music from them! But we will from Skrillex! I think that's something to be happy about :)"
skrillex,3ccrpp,SunderedYT,4,Tue Jul 7 03:04:16 2015 UTC,you've just summarized my feelings on this topic. Thank you.

skrillex,3ccrpp,SunderedYT,7,Tue Jul 7 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"I think the only people who could think he's peaked already are the 2011 brostep fanboys honestly. He made some sick ass music yea, but I love the direction bass music has been going for the last few years, and skrillex has a knack for either leading the curve or scouting the newer artists at the head of the curve. If you only listen to 2011 style brostep you are getting left behind imo. Also I think he is going to be dropping another solo album soon with all the unreleased material he has, and he hasn't been playing his own music because he wants to keep it under wraps"
skrillex,3ccrpp,RymeswithOrange,5,Tue Jul 7 00:00:20 2015 UTC,"Sonny's new concerts are perfect for trap and edm lovers, but ironically not for his fans.."
skrillex,3ccrpp,lightingequinox,2,Tue Jul 7 00:30:47 2015 UTC,"sonny needs to broaden out to a wider audience, thats part of growing as an artist. but doing that by playing out songs with a guaranteed reaction is not the way to do it. while i dont entirely agree with it, this lines up with what deadmau5 said about where are u now. sonny, diplo, & justin KNEW very well that song would take off and be easy to market. I see that same effect with sonnys sets."
skrillex,3ccrpp,nickwrocks1,9,Tue Jul 7 01:04:08 2015 UTC,"I think as long as he's making the music he wants to make, We'll continue to get some pretty sick music. I honestly  loved Recess as much as his older stuff, and his recent remixes are also pretty sick, but only time will tell what he's doing next. And with a solo album coming ""soon"" apparently, I feel nothing but excitement for what the future may hold."
skrillex,3ccrpp,LynchMaleIdeal,5,Mon Jul 6 22:18:49 2015 UTC,Agreed. Putting any kind of limit on him would be a huge mistake.
skrillex,3ccrpp,disgustedRedditor,2,Tue Jul 7 00:45:16 2015 UTC,If anything it'd make him put out more crazy stuff due to pressure etc.
skrillex,3ccrpp,LynchMaleIdeal,8,Tue Jul 7 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"Peaked? Peaked, AMCREATE? Let me tell you something. Skrillex hasn't even begun to peak. And when he does peak, you’ll know. Because he's gonna peak so hard that everybody in Philadelphia’s gonna feel it."
skrillex,3ccrpp,disgustedRedditor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"Why philadelphia? Perhaps i shouldve worded this differently. Youre right. He hasnt peaked and isnt close, he is progressing more every day. But his music seems to have plateaued. a lot of the strong musical elements that made his style unique have been missing from his recent tracks, such as his strong melodies, variety in sound, and diversive design. His recent tunes have been very percussive heavy and predictable. Exceptions like holla out & to u, shouldnt be exceptions. These were once standard for him. These are both very musical tracks, where as tunes like burial and red lips are all bass driven. Thats not a bad thing. But this is just something to note."

skrillex,3ccrpp,arixant,3,Tue Jul 7 07:45:30 2015 UTC,I think he's at a point in his career where he can really help artists develop their own sound and launch their careers. What could be more satisfying than helping someone else realise their dreams?
skrillex,3ccrpp,FuckTheZer0,2,Mon Jul 6 23:14:47 2015 UTC,Sonny has always been doing this though and it is a great thing.
skrillex,3ccrpp,ElephantBoxer,3,Tue Jul 7 00:51:51 2015 UTC,"Listen to Mora, then to Slats, slats, slats and then to Scary monsters. He's always changing, flow with him."
skrillex,3ccrpp,5ynd1c4t3,2,Mon Jul 6 23:19:35 2015 UTC,"These tunes actually arent all that different. Very musical and melody driven, upbeat, and constantly changing. Compare that to bad man, for example, or beats knocking. These tunes dont have a ton of those elements, bad man rides an offbeat piano into a drop with one synth with different automations. Beats knocking relies heavily on its percussive elements and effects. Where are the strong leads? Goosebump inducing bridges? Again, these are in no way bad songs. But you cant deny that some elements that were key to him are just flat out not there."
skrillex,3ccrpp,edyer12,3,Tue Jul 7 00:50:47 2015 UTC,"Peaked in 2011, Just listen to the melodies in Kill Everybody, we will never hear sonny do shit like that again."
skrillex,3ccrpp,KrazyTrain18,4,Tue Jul 7 12:31:34 2015 UTC,"On a side note, it sucks ass that he's playing less and less of his own songs at his own shows. Playing shit like Hey Sexy Lady, In For the Kill, Right In, Kill Everybody, etc would get ppl so fucking hyped. They're there to hear Skrillex after all.  Also it totally kills the song when he finally does drop something like First of the Year, but he doesn't play the build up at all, instead he uses some other songs build up. It completely throws off the song in a bad way - the build up is a necessary part of the song."
skrillex,3ccrpp,whitem4ge,2,Mon Jul 6 23:04:04 2015 UTC,Its much worse to get the build up of first of the year into something like make some noise. I love all music. I love the variety in his sets. But i want to hear more of his music in his sets. Granted his shows are about much more than that.

skrillex,3cb0n2,ValeraTheFilipino,3,Mon Jul 6 14:51:17 2015 UTC,"I'll provide actual feedback I suppose. It seems your mashup is 7/11 for the buildup and Ragga Bomb (Zomboy & Skrill remix) for the drop. After that, you pretty much play Ragga Bomb until the end of the track. I think people are downvoting because it hardly qualifies as a mashup and that it's also very harshly compressed/saturated."

skrillex,3c9cl2,JuanJChaca,3,Mon Jul 6 02:45:40 2015 UTC,The new drops reminds me of the Skrillex Goin Hard remix… so I basically love it.
skrillex,3c9cl2,ShotsLotta,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:57:08 2015 UTC,"Heard it for the 2nd time at Electric Forest, besides the intro the song seems..kinda generic. Maybe its gotta grow on me"
skrillex,3c9cl2,cmS1L3NTmc,0,Mon Jul 6 02:54:36 2015 UTC,Generic? Name ONE song that sounds like the new version.
skrillex,3c9cl2,plasmaticriver,2,Mon Jul 6 20:41:38 2015 UTC,"I think the sub (and the forum) kind of confuse ""generic"" with ""thing I don't like"". Ironically, if Sonny made songs like his old material, they'd be more generic than the new songs, because his old sound's been beaten to death by a billion artists."
skrillex,3c9cl2,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:46:27 2015 UTC,True asf.
skrillex,3c9cl2,plasmaticriver,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:59:02 2015 UTC,"Dunno what you're doing taking this up with me, mate. I just said you're using ""generic"" wrong. You can decide whatever you like about the quality of the song, you just have to know the definition of a word if you use it."
skrillex,3c9cl2,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:26:21 2015 UTC,"The song sounds like holla out, its not generic but again I I wasnt actually putting thought into it."
skrillex,3c9cl2,cmS1L3NTmc,0,Wed Jul 8 10:19:04 2015 UTC,"Not hating it, generic just seems like such an arbitrary word to describe it. Generic means it sounds like the majority of the other shit out there, and I'm legitimately wondering why you think that when I've never heard anything remotely like it."
skrillex,3c9cl2,plasmaticriver,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:45:41 2015 UTC,"I honestly cant even remember what is sounds like, so Ill use whatever word I want to describe it. Right now I can say its forgettable.   Fine, call it whatever you want, but don't expect anyone to give a shit when you can't even use words correctly, Jesus. You call it forgettable and generic when you can't even remember a single track it sounds like? Are you high or something?"
skrillex,3c9cl2,plasmaticriver,0,Mon Jul 6 21:46:52 2015 UTC,"Well now that you're hopefully done insulting me, feel free to leave the sub since you obviously don't like Skrillex if the only thing you enjoyed at a live show was listening to with you friends sped up."
skrillex,3c9cl2,plasmaticriver,0,Tue Jul 7 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"Ha you're delusional, just shut up, there is no logic behind what you said.   You're the one who called Red Lips ""generic"" when you couldn't think of what it sounds like buddy. I think you're the one who's fucking crazy."
skrillex,3c8rsk,Holden_Linton,3,Sun Jul 5 23:32:40 2015 UTC,Black Ops 2 was awesome.

skrillex,3c8rsk,LynchMaleIdeal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:06:27 2015 UTC,Did the video come out before the song!?
skrillex,3c8rsk,Eagles1000,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:48:59 2015 UTC,But we had heard Try It Out quite a bit in live shows before the video dropped...we have yet to hear anything to do with a new yogi x skrillex track.
skrillex,3c8rsk,-Syko,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:49:14 2015 UTC,Still disappointed in the original mix not being released

skrillex,3c8qvo,MiNiHiKiD,5,Sun Jul 5 23:24:35 2015 UTC,This a great way to see the de-evolution of this remix

skrillex,3c8toy,TheOfficialRezzax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:09:45 2015 UTC,Wait so is the artist showing up as SebastiAn? Cause if so you could just edit the tag

skrillex,3c9366,LynchMaleIdeal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:18:46 2015 UTC,I mean it could just be the music video but it'd be really cool if it got released
skrillex,3c9366,oromuzik,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:22:21 2015 UTC,As someone else stated it might be like Try It Out where the video was released on the 9th October and the EP was out on the 14th kind of thing. There's still hope for new music.

skrillex,3c7alf,nickhue,3,Sun Jul 5 15:37:17 2015 UTC,Imo that bit would be dope as like a second or final drop
skrillex,3c7alf,xvcii,2,Sun Jul 5 17:20:20 2015 UTC,Sounds nice. Try some Distortion or heavy saturation on the vocals at the beginning. Or maybe use a frequency Shifter. I like it
skrillex,3c7alf,poellemonster,2,Sun Jul 5 15:48:42 2015 UTC,Sounds a bit raw but you are on the right track. Good job.

skrillex,3c6wki,Warau-Chan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:43:16 2015 UTC,As in the first version being the Sonar / Hangout Version and the second being the GTA Mix version?
skrillex,3c6wki,BioTechnix,3,Sun Jul 5 12:48:36 2015 UTC,I think he means the first being original Aspen version and the second being the Hangout.
skrillex,3c6wki,Warau-Chan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"If you're right, I'd like to know if it's both drops combined for the Hangout, just Drop #1, or Drop #2."

skrillex,3bwkm1,plasmaticriver,0,Thu Jul 2 20:58:19 2015 UTC,What makes people assume he's being an asshole is his comments about it on twitter.
skrillex,3bwkm1,ItsDagda,7,Thu Jul 2 22:01:53 2015 UTC,"All he said was that he made it out of vengeance samples and that he was bewildered as to why he has a recorder, how is that being an asshole? That's just Joel being funny, which is Joel being Joel and not the ""Joel being an ass"" part of Joel being Joel."
skrillex,3bwkm1,plasmaticriver,0,Thu Jul 2 22:26:32 2015 UTC,"Go back on his timeline lad, he's said it was shit."
skrillex,3bwkm1,ItsDagda,6,Thu Jul 2 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"I saw. Him saying it was shit ≠ him being an asshole. It's just his opinion, which is entirely subjective. More than likely has to do with his deep-rooted hatred of Bieber, but not liking that particular song is fine."
skrillex,3bwkm1,plasmaticriver,0,Thu Jul 2 23:26:59 2015 UTC,"His manner of saying it made him an asshole imo, he said it in a very attention seeking way + he didn't even realise he was listening to Marshmallow."
skrillex,3bwkm1,ItsDagda,2,Fri Jul 3 00:06:09 2015 UTC,"That's just his personality, but that was very tame. I think you're too quick to judge because you think he should like song so much."
skrillex,3bwkm1,plasmaticriver,4,Fri Jul 3 00:37:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think he should like the song, I don't think you should have to like anything but he's just simply a cunt about these sorts of things in my opinion.  He has all the musical talent in the world(I'm even subbed to his subscription service) but his social skills are warped af. But you know, that's just what I get from him."
skrillex,3bwkm1,ItsDagda,2,Fri Jul 3 00:42:30 2015 UTC,"Except he's not actually being a cunt. I've seen him being a cunt and this isn't it. He's making fun of a song he didn't like, just like when he made fun of hardstyle. Literally all he said innthe tweet was that he gave the track a shot, didn't like it and regretted listening to it. Didn't make any rude comments about the artists. Everyone is just quick to judge Joel's opinions nowadays."
skrillex,3bwkm1,plasmaticriver,3,Fri Jul 3 00:53:50 2015 UTC,"My last reply wasn't just about this, this is fairly mild compared to everything else he's said.  I just mean, I have to separate his personality from his music etc."

skrillex,3bwkm1,laurenmcdo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:36:36 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. You act like friends don't have the right to criticize their friend's music simply BECAUSE they're friends and that's wrong. He said something on twitter which is a place to share short thoughts an opinions, he didn't write a page memoir about how much he hated it or hated Sonny for making it.   For fucks sake, you're all acting like sharing an negative opnion on your friend's song on social media is like a dick move and it isn't. It certainly isn't the nicest thing to do, but it isn't mean either.   No one is saying that Joel doesn't have a superiority complex, but this isn't that, its literally him JUST having an opnion and him reacting to a song that be heard that he doesn't like. People are sensitive its like disliking someone else's music and talking about it is a crime on social justice or some shit."

The way it was mixed in aswell with just the acapella and some heavy trap beat - it's not the final thing. I refuse to believe it. It sounds odd as fuck. He plays the other remix way more often too... (I know that's not much to go by, but still - GTA have always had the older version of the remix, think about it) If this drop is the final genuine shit however, I'm terrified for release day.

skrillex,3bwg4g,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:54:17 2015 UTC,"honestly i don't know why you guys are shitting on this, some of the best sound design i've heard in a while"
skrillex,3bwg4g,whitem4ge,0,Thu Jul 2 19:14:24 2015 UTC,"The song sounds all fucked up during the buildups. Whats with the overpowering muddy bass there? It actually sounds cleaner in the rips we have, which is just... Wat. Not feeling the new rhythm of the drop either.  EDIT: The muddiness is probably just from the stream being compressed to shit by Soundcloud. The structure of the drop, not so much."
skrillex,3bwg4g,P_Wood,-3,Thu Jul 2 19:37:26 2015 UTC,skrillex has forgotten how song structure works. most of the time when an artist spends this long trying way to hard to make their song better it turns out this way.
skrillex,3bwg4g,RayRay_Sugarbutt,6,Thu Jul 2 18:54:37 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try and pretend that I didn't just read that you said skrill ""forgot how song structure works""...."
skrillex,3bwg4g,P_Wood,3,Thu Jul 2 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"He's exaggerating too much, but I understand what he means... Kinda. The structure of this remix kinda... I dunno, it's not the greatest. In my opinion, obviously. Especially now that the rhythm of the first drop's changed again, it just feels... Really repetitive to me. And the amount of times the rhythm's broken up also draws a lot of attention to how short the drop actually is. /:"
skrillex,3bwg4g,plasmaticriver,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get what you're saying. I'm really anxious for the final release. I hope he keeps that second drop from hangout, that shit was nuts."

skrillex,3bwg4g,RayRay_Sugarbutt,2,Thu Jul 2 20:50:49 2015 UTC,I mean he's exaggerating a lot more. I think he does it for effect and attention. Prolly thinks he's a learned academic with a PhD in Sonnymoorology and therefore is best Skrillex critic ever lol.
skrillex,3bwg4g,Travdog,3,Thu Jul 2 23:13:02 2015 UTC,"I dunno if he does it for attention, he might just legit be so in love with old Skrillex that the change in style's made him passionately pissed. It's retarded, but I did it when I had a band that I adored every album by put out an album I didn't like, so I know where he's coming from... Sorta."
skrillex,3bwg4g,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"Lol I remember my super fanboy stage, it was around the pre-Bangarang era. When Sonny dropped the Bangarang EP I remember a part of me being super pissed, I wanted an EP that sounded exactly like SMNS lol, but I never plastered my opinion over the sub.   I think the super fanboy stage is something a lot of Skrill fans go through, especially when you're a young hormone driven teenager. I was like 16-17 during that era, but even that's young enough for me to look back now and realise my opinion on music at that point was garbage, lol."

skrillex,3bpm3m,KrazyTrain18,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:42:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, IMO there's a huge difference which nobody here has really mentioned yet.   EDM shows inside are the absolute best, IMO. The reason? The bass travels all the way out the massive speakers, through the floor, and up your spine. You feel all the bass in your body, which is something nobody prepared me for during my first show (which was Skrillex).   Festivals are still fun, but the bass gets muddied/almost entirely lost due to the relatively soft ground and the lack of walls. If you're looking for a mind-blowing music experience, I would pick a venue over an outdoor festival each and every time."

skrillex,3bm4gg,cyberforte,2,Tue Jun 30 14:01:13 2015 UTC,Kind of a bummer. I think it sounded better at hangout fest.
skrillex,3bm4gg,GiantFishyLazer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:08:46 2015 UTC,"It's really not that different now—just some added drums, one removed laser synth, and a cool change near the end. Nothing wrong with the new drums and the new synth at the end, so if this ends up being the release version, just add back the laser and we're good"
skrillex,3bm4gg,cyberforte,2,Thu Jul 2 01:33:35 2015 UTC,"A while ago, I don't think he played the first one for long before he started gradually changing it."

I kinda thought the Red Lips remixes would be out in August or so, but if the final version hasn't even been sent off for mastering yet or anything, that seems a lot less likely."
skrillex,3bm4gg,Korpseio,2,Tue Jun 30 13:19:26 2015 UTC,Skrilly & Diplodocus said they were working on the master for the Jack U album the last week before release. There is hope.

skrillex,3bkz2l,TomLube,20,Tue Jun 30 01:57:39 2015 UTC,I'm 100% sure that this fan community and its mods are more upset about leaks than Sonny and his team themselves
skrillex,3bkz2l,Eric_DA,2,Tue Jun 30 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"Sonny doesn't care as much about his own music leaking because HE is the one who usually leaks it. He says he doesn't care about demos leaking, not full tracks. He also may have said in the last that he doesn't care about torrenting, but that's because he knows that he has fans who can't afford his music. He's not playing into all the fans who are just cheap and don't wanna pay for full quality of his music.  If you support the artist, compensate them for their work. If you don't want to, settle for a free alternative like a streaming service. You don't get to have it both ways. I mean here on the sub ofc, no one cares what you do on your own time.  Also just FYI, Dillon was pissed at Kygo for leaking their collab early on flash drives when it was supposed to be on this EP. I'm sure if Sonny had gone ahead and leaked this collab early without getting the OK from him, he'd be pissed too, it's understandable.  What amazes me is how people literally expect us to just throw caution to the wind and embrace piracy when we're supposed to be the ""ideal"" upstanding fans. We have rules, we're a no-piracy sub, and if you don't like it, take your own chances elsewhere.  But please, stop downvoting the shit out of Tom for doing his job as mod and specifically following instruction from Sonny's management while you make up excuses to brush off their warnings."
skrillex,3bkz2l,plasmaticriver,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:52:06 2015 UTC,"Kygo & Dillon, IMO, different story. Kygo and his team leveraged the track as a promotion for their own campaign while Dillon, if he was truly upset, probably had release plans lined up considering it is a track forthcoming on his own EP. I can see why an artist would be furious over this - who gave Kygo's management the right to give away a track that had been made for Dillon's EP? Also note that the whole USB thing - who even knows. The only copy of the track is uploaded by Dancing Astronaut (at least the only 320 copy I'm aware of) and I promise you no one was in the crowd to ""catch a usb"""
skrillex,3bkz2l,Eric_DA,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"Apparently you don't know the actual story:  http://pulseradio.net/articles/2015/04/dillon-francis-is-fuming-over-kygo-marketing-stunt  He threw the USBs to the crowd at Coachella. The USBs contained the Dillon collab that was supposed to be on Dillon's EP. Dillon was pissed because of this, end of story.  The whole point is that you don't go leaking something you know has plans for release. This leak was quite different, most likely due to someone else's carelessness, but it's the kind of thing that if the person who was responsible was known for a fact, they would most likely be fired.   In general, leaks of stuff on releases are bad. They can cause tracks to be pulled from release, or worse. It should be EASY to understand why we don't throw caution to the wind and have an anarchy of music piracy in a sub that's supposed to represent true fans of the music.  And let me tell you, true fans don't pirate shit they could easily afford just because the artist doesn't detest them for it. Even when Sonny said he wasn't bother by piracy, he also said he PREFERRED that his fans buy his music. That should be obvious, but apparently everyone is just bewildered by the idea that spreading leaks might actually be harmful and shouldn't be encouraged."
skrillex,3bkz2l,plasmaticriver,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:52:12 2015 UTC,"No, I know the actual story. I know they ""threw USBs"" but I don't know if they actually threw out any USBs... if you know what I'm saying, considering there's only one source of the track...   Anyway yass I agree that you don't leak something with plans for release, and you don't pirate things planned for release, but realistically the music is out there and I'm going to listen to it, I've already preordered the EP, so I'm going to download the leak. I'm viewing this more like when a track/album releases like a week before release. It will probably just generate more promo that Dillon just hit the world with a highly anticipated single + a Skrill collab"
skrillex,3bkz2l,Eric_DA,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:07:40 2015 UTC,"Dude, I personally have nothing against you or anyone else doing it, nor do I care. I was just explaining why it isn't condoned on the sub and that people should listen to Tom rather than downvoting him because they disagree.  Now, if you're claiming that the whole Dillon-Kygo thing was just made up for promo, I don't see any reason to believe you, but my points stand."

I totally get that you took the action you needed to by making this thread/deleting links, but when you hit us with the   You cannot pretend to support the artists and then leak their tracks for free on the internet.

skrillex,3bkz2l,plasmaticriver,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think you realize what leaks actually do when they happen. If something leaks early, it can actually put the release of the track in jeopardy. It's more common with pop artists signed to bigger labels, but its very normal for an artist to have to pull a track from a release if it leaks because the label has no interest in selling something that everyone already has for free. It might not always be the case, but it can have other negative concequences, like making the tracks album only so you have to buy the entire thing."

I can't recheck cause I'm on mobile right now, but I'm fairly sure at least one mod was active on reddit while It was happening.   Hahaha yea I understand that mods have social lives outside of reddit, but that doesn't excuse the fact that nobody read the sub for a good 7+ hour block, lol. You have to agree that the mod team should take at least some responsibility for the leak being spread all over the sub..."

Sounds like something FM. Sonny tends to stick with FM8 or Operator. As for process most likely some saturation, distortion etc. etc. Finally it could possibly be layered with other sounds. A sub of course, and possibly other synth layers for texture. It seems many artists are working towards serum as massive is becoming quite boring. Play around with this process, best case you create something like it, worst case you have your own sound!"

I recommend reducing their volume a bit, especially of the kick (it's a bit too high pitched), adding a bit of reverb (short decay) or eqing the highs out just a tiny bit (or both) in order to dull them a bit and soften them. Also I don't hear much of your own instruments other than the drums so it's more of an edit than a remix. Also some long and medium length crashes would work well."

skrillex,3b3xy6,69ingJamesFranco,11,Fri Jun 26 05:02:47 2015 UTC,"The interviewer seemed like a sweet genuine person, but was out of touch and tried to over dramatize certain parts of the interview, thankfully Skrillex played off and dismissed the attempted drama and corrected her when needed to and did it properly. With that being said these flaws did not occur enough to ruin the interview especially given Sonny's attitude. I enjoyed this interview, a tad generic but it was good, Skrillex is so chill and nice, want him to release that song he was making in the video."
skrillex,3b3xy6,plasmaticriver,8,Fri Jun 26 07:27:04 2015 UTC,"The interviewer    Apparently you don't know who Katie Couric is lol.  She was just trying to get statements on certain points for insight, since as she mentioned in the teaser, Sonny doesn't do many face to face interviews. Especially ones about his personal life.  I was slightly unnerved at Sonny's neutral-ish position on Scientology tho. I know being raised from great parents that were unfortunately immersed in that religion makes it hard to criticize sometimes, but I feel like he was too PC. He obvo doesn't buy into the scientology bullshit, but it almost seems like he would have possibly embraced it if it hadn't taken away so much from his music life. That being said, I hope Sonny is aware of the scope of the corruption of the CoS leadership. He should deffo watch Going Clear if he hasn't, it might enlighten him a bit.  Overall I think the interview just shows what a mature, kind and down to earth person he really is. I'm glad he isn't phased by the haters, but I feel like no one could literally watch this interview and still call HIM a shithead no matter how much they hate his music."
skrillex,3b3xy6,HolySwagg,4,Sat Jun 27 08:58:37 2015 UTC,"Interview was clearly for Katie's audience not Sonny's, still wish she'd made the effort to ask a few unique questions. You can tell he's so tired of getting asked about his haircut.   It came out a while back that Sonny took some basic Scientology courses, his name was on a list of course registrations or something. Wish I could link to the source, it was years ago that I saw that. The auditing stuff really does help clear emotional blockages and stuff but I agree that the organization as a whole is terrifying and cultish, and even if 90% of the bad press is over hyped, all it takes is for one of those stories to be true for it to be evil. But when you associate good people with something you have a really different perspective on things. They go to extreme lengths to make it compelling, including, wait for it, stories about how we're descended from aliens. How could Skrill not be intrigued by that?"
skrillex,3b3xy6,edyer12,7,Thu Jun 25 21:03:56 2015 UTC,I still think Skrillex might help Marshmello make music because that Katie collab sounded like a straight marshmello song

I get that the point was to showcase how human he really is, but they spent minimal time actually talking about the music as well as overplaying SMNS too much."
skrillex,3b3xy6,Zdendaozzy,2,Fri Jun 26 00:12:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't think so... The questions were good if you had no idea who Sonny was, but most on this sub already knew the 90% of the stuff in here  It was a good interview, but nothing of massive value imo"
skrillex,3b3xy6,fraynor,3,Thu Jun 25 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"I know it wasn't of huge value and we didn't learn anything new really, but it felt like a really genuine interview, like they actually had a vibe going on, seeing skrillex really express these things and his feelings rather than reading about it online was a nice experience to watch. Seeing him vibing out in his studio too, seeing the equipment, the set up, the mics was definelty good to see."

skrillex,3b35e4,IAmZackTheStiles,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:15:54 2015 UTC,"Currently there's no official meet n greets scheduled for any of the Full Flex dates.  If you show up really early and hang around the venue there's always the chance that you'll meet Sonny, however after the show is probably not going to happen.  If there's an after party that's probably your bets chance, the after parties will probably be announced closer to the date if there's going to be one."
skrillex,3b35e4,KrazyTrain18,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:16:59 2015 UTC,I'm lining up like 5-4hrs early soo haha. Where would I look for after party dates?
skrillex,3b35e4,HolySwagg,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:22:25 2015 UTC,"You might have luck talking to promoters for other electronic shows in Montreal, just make a short hitlist for possible venues.

skrillex,3b35e4,HolySwagg,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:06:52 2015 UTC,"Also, from a strategic point of view, since this is a train tour, they might pick venues near the train station. Anyway if I was booking it that's what I would do."

skrillex,3b34pe,edgebigfan,6,Thu Jun 25 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"The reason the Jack Ü album isn't talked about that much anymore is because 1- Sonny has a load of new solo shit in the works (and I think nearly everyone here prefers that) & 2- They slaughtered all the demos we heard (imo) - Febreze, Jungle Bae etc were fine the way they were to begin with imo. But the final product did sound much more complete so I guess that's something."
skrillex,3b34pe,xTrill,2,Thu Jun 25 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"Febreze, Jungle Bae etc were fine the way they were to begin with imo   Febreeze is probably the only songs where skrillex is involved that i don't like, it's awful. The demo is way better, just like you said."
skrillex,3b34pe,Einstein303,5,Thu Jun 25 16:16:49 2015 UTC,Febreeze is Jack Ü (Skrillex & Diplo)

skrillex,3azxn5,GiantFishyLazer,7,Wed Jun 24 22:19:36 2015 UTC,Both Version of Red Lips sound amazing. I hope they both get released I don't get why everybody is hating on Jack Ü. I think Jack Ü is the shit. I pretty much like all the songs in that album. The Recess Album was kind of hard to get use to at first but it grew on me. I still listen to the album to this day. And for what I see he's an awesome person. Can't wait till he releases more stuff!  Thank you for making this btw. That other thread was getting WAY out of hand. I hope if skrillz does read all of that maybe just take all the positive and ignore the NEGATIVE PEOPLE (just to be nice)
skrillex,3azxn5,cyberforte,2,Wed Jun 24 21:53:41 2015 UTC,"Same here man, both versions are killer! The one that got posted the other day/mash up with Big Riddim Monsta was incredible. My ears just melted it was perfection!!!  Jack Ü's album to me was incredible, so diverse and well thought out. Absolutely brilliant and masterful.  Recess is incredible, some tracks were real growers - initially only liking some of the tracks I ended up loving ALL of them. I mean the only one I remember thinking was odd was Dirty Vibe tbh as I was still discovering electronic music and had no idea what the fuck Trap was, however that song is just amazing. Technically Jack Ü which I always seem to forget (do I change the artist on my iTunes... Hmmm...?)  And yes, that's why I created this because I couldn't stand to sit back and just let everyone think it was okay to slag him off and moan about him doing what he enjoys.  People like that really annoy me. True Skrillex fans love all his shit.  There's only song I can think of right now, that I'm not as keen on as others yet it's starting to grow on me so I'll regret saying this soon! - This Is A Shark Attack (Skrillex Remix), it'd really bouncy and very unique having thought about this more..."

People are leaving the comfort zone of their genre which makes new and exciting music for us to listen, and I feel Skrillex had one of the biggest contributions to this change!

If you fuck up even like one directory that had samples in it or something, you can corrupt the entire thing accidentally. Try being a producer lol, happens all the time.

It was actually the only Jack Ü track from the BBC mixtape that didn't get finished/reworked and released on the album, which was super disappointing considering how long were waiting for it.

skrillex,3b1dzr,itskvin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:50:08 2015 UTC,"I don't really see how brostep isn't a thing. It's a name that was used to describe an offshoot of dubstep, with many very recognizable elements to it. Using the term allows you to differentiate between the more typically grime and dub influenced material associated with the term ""dubstep"". There's nothing wrong with brostep being used as a genre name, and you'd think that Sonny embracing it would be everybody else's queue to be okay with it. It even makes sense to use it when talking to people who go ""BOOO, HE RUINED DUBSTEP"", because you can go ""Actually, he just created a new genre. You still have regular dubstep that's being created right now, you can find quite a lot of it.""  Additionally, brostep's evolved to feature many tempos and elements that just aren't ever present in dubstep. I suppose if you treat brostep's parent genre as dubstep, then you can claim it's the same thing. But that seems kinda pointless. Why not make further distinction to make it clearer what you're talking about? Plus, a subgenre isn't exactly the same as its parent genre, because subgenres let you be more precise. Pendulum and Noisia both make drum & bass, but the styles they make are quite different, because Noisia typically makes Neurofunk and Pendulum made more melodic and atmospheric dnb styles.   tl;dr, What I'm gettin' at here is that I suppose you can argue with people that brostep is dubstep in the sense that it comes from dubstep. But it's become so different from it that I kinda feel like dubstep being its parent genre is more of a historical footnote now than a categorical relation.   EDIT: I also realize it started as a derogatory term to make fun of the sound Skrill helped shape and popularize, but again, it's literally in the title of the opening track on Sonny's first LP as Skrillex. I take that as meaning the term's been reclaimed. I suppose if you just don't like the name you could use one of the alternate ones people throw around, like ""filthstep"". But that seems even goofier than brostep to me."

I was previewing them all on itunes and was just saying to myself ""this all sucks, this isnt hard skrillex""  Then i hit doompy poomp, and it just sounded so freaking crafted, so surreal... it sounded like a cross between a horror track (the first half) and a soft melody (the second half). The sound production is phenominal.  And only THEN did i start digging the recess songs."

skrillex,3awd6x,Einstein303,6,Wed Jun 24 03:53:18 2015 UTC,"No, he meant that Ruffneck Bass should have been on the Bangarang EP."
skrillex,3awd6x,lolroflqwerty,4,Wed Jun 24 05:17:47 2015 UTC,But why? It sounds nearly identical to Kyoto. What's so special about this one other than the ragga vocals?
skrillex,3awd6x,Einstein303,3,Wed Jun 24 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"Idk, imo kyoto is better."
skrillex,3awd6x,lolroflqwerty,2,Wed Jun 24 05:44:50 2015 UTC,exactly. i always looked at this Ruffneck as a demo for Kyoto. which is why i didnt understand why he said that

skrillex,3awd6x,SunderedYT,20,Wed Jun 24 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"And my unpopular theory is that Skrillex actually, to an extent, doesn't enjoy his own songs anymore. In his old sets over half the songs he played were his or his remixes. Now it's less than a quarter or so, today.  A lot of his songs are also someone elses remixes (usually bad ones imo) like instead of playing Ease My Mind he'll play a trap remix of it.  Also a lot of his songs he syncs at way higher BPMs, like Breakn a Sweat and idk if anyone else noticed but he plays a shorter and shorter portion of that song every time. But he doesn't speed up anybody elses songs that much, just his. You can't tell me he just does it to make it sound better; he wants to  get through it faster.  And now he always plays some stupid song or clip right before he drops First of the Year, almost as if to say ""hey if I made this song today in 2015 instead of four years ago, this is how bad I would have liked it to sound, but whatever I'll drop the original First of the Year drop after this terrible club beat, because I got to have SOMETHING I've made in this set"".  Haven't heard him have any throwback in years. When was the last time you heard: Burst, Hey Sexy Lady, In for the Kill, My Name is Skrillex (even the acapella in another song), Bug Hunt, Cinema (Not just the so over-milked gem shards drop or the acapella into a Jack U song)? Oh that's right, 2013 or earlier is probably the last time we heard any of those played.  I think the only reason he'll play stuff like FOTY and SMNS at all is because there's no denying he'll disappoint everybody if he plays zero of his best-known songs.  And if you plan to hate, please read it again because it's NOT a rant, it's really my honest opinions and observations, as a true fan and close follower, from watching him change over the past few years"
skrillex,3awd6x,KrazyTrain18,9,Wed Jun 24 04:59:55 2015 UTC,"This pretty much sums up my thoughts except I believe he still loves his older tracks, but isn't in to dub step anymore"
skrillex,3awd6x,Cdecker82,9,Wed Jun 24 05:03:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with both of you, but I think it could also be due to the fact that he's probably tired of hearing them."
skrillex,3awd6x,chasethenoise,6,Wed Jun 24 05:16:25 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about that as well. You have to be a special kind of person to like hearing the same handful of songs every single day. I'm sure it's at least partially gotten old for him by now.
skrillex,3awd6x,SunderedYT,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:44:41 2015 UTC,"But if he loved them he could still play some or at least throw back on occassion. 12th Planet is still dropping Burst and Needed Change, not because it's new or relevant today, but because he still thinks it's really good music. I think Skrilly may have moved away from that entirely. Idk, here's hoping we see some sign of the old Skrillex make a return on Full Flex Express"
skrillex,3awd6x,KrazyTrain18,2,Wed Jun 24 15:31:14 2015 UTC,I doubt it considering it's all Jack U sets
skrillex,3awd6x,sylenthikillyou,7,Wed Jun 24 16:20:28 2015 UTC,"I get that first point, but let me try and explain this. By the way, I'm not belittling your opinion, I agree with you that some songs sound great when they're sped up 10bpm, some don't.  A lot of the trap coming out these days is 145-150bpm. That means that if Skrillex is playing mostly these songs, it makes sense to keep his own ones at this tempo, since bringing it down 10bpm would decrease the energy of his set. Also, in a live setting there are a lot of people too drunk to care that it's 10bpm faster and only pick up on the higher energy, making them believe it sounds better.  But I do totally agree; All is Fair sounds shit at 150bpm. I thank my lucky stars that I was lucky enough to see him live around the time he released Bangarang and his sets were played on a laptop and a Trigger Finger."

Like somehow Diplo is forcing Skrillex to make music with him. Spoiler alert: he's not. They obviously get along great and Skrillex wouldn't be taking time off his own career in order to make music and perform with Diplo if he wasn't 100% on board.   Skrillex has always been someone who makes what he wants, regardless of what people think of it. He's constantly pushing the limits of the scene with all kinds of genres and styles. He is usually the only one playing the kind of music he plays at festival main stages. Stages that are usually dominated by whatever flavor of house is ""in"" at the moment.   He obviously feels inspired by the trap and hip hop scene and he was experimenting with those styles way before Jack Ü was even a concept. He wants to make this kind of music and who better to make it with than the absolute juggernaut in the scene that is Diplo?   Anyway, my point is, you don't have to like the music that he and Diplo makes as Jack Ü. You can even be disappointed that he's not making the kind of music he was making when you became a fan. I get that, especially since his output isn't exactly mindblowing (with few releases per year). What you really shouldn't be doing is acting like Diplo is somehow steering Skrillex down some dark alley of bad music. This is what he's wants to make. I'd rather he made what he truly feels passionate about rather than put out something that's uninspired just to appease the masses."

I reckon Skrillex is gonna come back with something so incredible that it'll blow our fucking minds away! (Prays to God the Adult Swim single is something huge)  Another thing, I'm not a Diplo fanboy but I do really like some of his stuff, even before I knew it was him who produced it. People hate on him for his personality over his production/DJing - as others have said, he hasn't got a specific sound - he genre-jumps (like Ralph game-jumps in Wreck It Ralph... I couldn't resist, guys...) and therefore just works with anybody and everybody and as he's with Skrillex a lot of the time, Skrill goes along and well yeah the ""magic"" happens. Diplo doesn't care as long he's making music.  Have you seen his release schedule though? It's absolutely insane, every week a new song or remix comes out somehow involving Diplo - I'm glad I'm not a Diplo fanboy because I wouldn't be able to keep up with the amount of stuff he outputs!  Hopefully, and I'm sure this is actually a POPULAR opinion (sorry), Diplo may influence Skrillex to put out more new material, some VIPs maybe or something, who knows? I feel it's only good news that Sonny's working with Diplo, tbh.  I might have lost my point a little, but yeah.

When I first heard Skrillex, I absolutely did not get it. I didn't like it, and I pushed it aside and forgot about it. This was when First of the Year came out. Fast forward a while and I started getting into electronic music more and started listening to Skrillex occasionally via pandora. I was listening to stuff like Avicii, and Skrillex gradually grew on me to the point where I now own almost all of his released content and will pay hundreds to see him perform live.   Maybe, we shouldn't be nitpicking everything he releases and calling it weak or what have you. Sonny is an artist, and I for one have really enjoyed watching his music evolve from Scary Monsters to Summit to Leaving to Bad Man and all the works and side projects as well. It's music, it's supposed to make you move and create a connection, and it doesn't always succeed, but that's art. I hated Scatta and it's now like a bible for sound design for me. Everyone has bought a cd for one song and then the rest grew on you over time.   Maybe we should not be posting complaints, but rather support and appreciation.   Maybe then he'll release some VIP's and shit ;)  (Forgive formatting, I'm doing this from my phone)"

skrillex,3awd6x,KidLouis,8,Wed Jun 24 17:56:46 2015 UTC,I think that the Badman remix is one of Skrillex's worst/laziest tracks.
skrillex,3awd6x,IAmTheCatMaster,4,Wed Jun 24 04:40:02 2015 UTC,"Gotta be honest, I really don't like this whole ""riddim"" phase dubstep is going through. I also hate that it got a new name even though ""riddim"" has been around longer than ""brostep"". I also fucking hate the term brostep."
skrillex,3awd6x,OmnipotenceUprising,2,Wed Jun 24 05:16:50 2015 UTC,"really? I love the term brostep! i love that it started as an insult from people who listen to ""real dubstep"" (Benga, Caspa, old Rusko, etc) but it turned into the official term for that kind of dubstep. shows you how lighthearted the people involved that industry are"
skrillex,3awd6x,supadupakevin,2,Wed Jun 24 12:32:08 2015 UTC,"I definitely see your point, I just feel like ""brostep"" is such a douchey sounding word, which is why I guess ""real dubstep"" listeners gave it that name. When you think about it though, it definitely made sense, a bunch of ""bros"" jumped on the dubstep band wagon as Skrillex started to get bigger, but I feel like most have abandoned ship by now. They've all moved on to big room."

skrillex,3awd6x,Syaoran07,2,Wed Jun 24 11:12:18 2015 UTC,Including Red Lips? That sounds pretty similar to Badman and Burial. I hope Sonny isn't going down that road where all of his music starts to sound the same.
skrillex,3awd6x,vylandasa,2,Thu Jun 25 12:49:56 2015 UTC,I actually think that this was one of the better tracks. I like it for the engineering rather than the sound
skrillex,3awd6x,MaddManInc,11,Wed Jun 24 10:15:37 2015 UTC,I don't think Diplo pushes Sonny creatively.
skrillex,3awd6x,theEman40000,7,Wed Jun 24 01:38:50 2015 UTC,i don't see the significance behind barcelona/sonar
skrillex,3awd6x,MaddManInc,15,Wed Jun 24 03:49:06 2015 UTC,"Most of his new, unreleased collaborations are shit. Goh is awful, the way it has those breaks is annoying, and the vocals are way to much with the amount of time they take up, which isn't even that much. Just an all around boring track. The Yellow Claw collaboration is the worst fucking shit i've heard since the DJ Snake remix of Dirty Vibe. the annoying siren over and over, not to mention the reused Jungle Bae demo synth. All around an annoying track that, while it may be good live, is a piece of shit to listen to ay home, making a thrown off balance Sonny has never created before. Almost all of his demos are better than the released tracks. I can think of fewer rather than more that are better released. Scatta has an awful drop, unorganized, and scattered. (dum dum, tishhh) His sets have been getting better this year, but in 2014 all the trapy and rap shit was getting thoroughly annoying. I still want a 12th Planet collaboration, and am glad he's going back to the more brostepy sound, but still experimenting. A huge debate though is wether or not Diplo is fucking up his sound, and honestly, I don't think he has a sound, rather then a way he produces. When I hear a certain sound, I hear certain synth types and what not. I DO THINK Diplo is throwing him into more mainstream sounding production, which pisses me off, just because I know he has so much more potential. If you played Bangarang then Ease My Mind to a person who didn't know who made it, they'de have no damn idea. In conclusion (to this bit), this is because he's going through a phase, Diplo is just part of it. Even though Dog Blood is far superior as a group live, Jack U still isn't awful. I also want Sonny to stay the fuck away from martin Garrix and Hardwell. House music and Hard Dance are both god awful, boring, generic, and lack talent. Also, I want to shove a horse cock down his throat whilst yelling at him to release more, but honestly he only releases tracks when he feels they're ready, which shows he cares. I want him to be him, and continue what he's doing."

skrillex,3awd6x,RayRay_Sugarbutt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:07:15 2015 UTC,"Hardwell makes electro house, though. I think what you mean to say is you hate a certain variety of electro house, or maybe deadmau5-influenced ""progressive house"" (which in itself is really just an offshoot of electro house if you wanna genre snob a bit, but whatever).  Regardless, I kinda dislike ""generic"" as a descriptor, just cause if you think about it hard enough, if enough people make a style of song, that style becomes generic. But that means that songs that would otherwise be considered good get shafted because there's a lot of them already out there. It's a fair opinion to have, I guess, but I'd rather pick the song apart and decide whether or not it's crap based on something other than saturation. But then you can get into a whole nother dumb argument about whether or not other styles are generic based on a cookie cutter structure instead of saturation, like how you can sum up most brostep as intro -> build -> drop composed of screechy synths and bass growls interspersed with melodic interruptions -> interlude, etc... Fuck.  (DID YOU KNOW I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS REALLY HARD?????)"

skrillex,3awd6x,MaddManInc,5,Wed Jun 24 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"Skrillex has become less influential as he becomes more commercialized. Not Sonny, his brand. This isn't just me being a hipster and wanting him to stay uncool - he used to be more creative in his sets, dropping tracks you've never heard of before. Now it's the hit tracks he plays at every show + 1 or 2 (if youre lucky) unreleased or new tracks of his to please the hardcore fan + 1 or 2 unreleased tracks from other artists + relevant at the moment tracks (coco-type stuff) + when he finally gets tired of mixing he drops bootlegs/mashups/edits until his time us up. He doesn't really curate the sound of electronic music like he used to.    This doesn't apply to when he releases new music, because it is influential. Just not performances   (harsh opinion i know im sorry)  The Trollphace sound is cool but they gotta stop hyping up this Red Lips remix, it's just gonna get slapped next to Bad Man as a meh track.

To me, his actual music starts at his SMANS EP. The Leaving EP is, again, totally not relevant to me, although Scary Bolly Dub eventually grew on me - though it's essentially just a mash-up. Too. Many. Remixes. I'm not a fan of nearly anyone remixing Skrillex songs because they usually make the songs less interesting, bar really few exceptions. Skrillex ""officially"" released a billion mixes, first of Scary Monsters, then lately of like every song he does. All in all, not even Recess is that much of a grower. I listen to 3-4 songs of them, everything else usually just gets skipped. On the other hand I used to not really like Bangarang EP but all songs kinda grew on me eventually. Never really cared for Dog Blood. Guess the whole techno-ish sounds don't interest me much. Not strictly about Skrillex, but I hate his shows in Italy. That's where I live and I love seeing him live, but the crowd is downright retarded, full of prepuscent drugged kiddos who think that pushing around, kicking and waving your arms in people's faces is actually what an EDM performance's about. When I look at stuff like the Red Rocks stream I just see everyone dancing and think: damn, now that's where I'd love to be. This community is way too much into demos and the public uproar begins when Sonny changes one note in a song for when it actually gets released. I learned not to overplay the demo versions, rips and whatnot, because it's not Skrillex ruining the tracks, it's your ears getting used to something and then even if it's only slightly different it'll obviously sound wrong and much worse. I remember when it took me weeks to get used to the differently shaped drop in Bangarang. Never again. Never overplaying demos again."

Of course, it's not mindblowing or breathtaking but I think it is brilliant because of the connections it makes. I hear a lot of people saying things as ""Skrillex is a pioneer and Jack Ü clearly is nothing special"" but I really disagree with that one. I often compare Jack Ü to the game console Wii. It was not brilliant talking specifics, Jack Ü/Wii did nothing really weird or innovative concerning music/hardware. But what they did do, is make the connection with ""mainstream"" people. Take a record like Where are Ü now for example. It is a connection between pop and EDM, and I think that is kind of what they're trying to do now, trying to reach a bigger audience and loose the ""Skrillex is dubstep!! My printer makes the same noises!!1!¡! Diplo only cares about girls and can't produce xD"", and show the people that they definitely can make things that people will like. Because at the end of the day, eventhough Sonny always made the music he wanted to make, nobody likes it when people criticise the things you did your best on. And coming back to the pioneer thing, this is the pioneer side of Skrillex (and Diplo). Make something more people will enjoy than the casual festival visitors, but the moms who are taking their kids to school too."

skrillex,3awd6x,singtome70,2,Thu Jul 9 15:01:15 2015 UTC,Recess was a flop? Ok.
skrillex,3awd6x,Typerramper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:09:24 2015 UTC,"In my opinion? Yes. The only songs I actually like on that album are Try It Out (which shouldn't really count as it was released before the album came out - it filled a slot which another track we haven't heard could have), Recess and Ragga Bomb. That's 3 songs out of a 12 track LP - I only liked a quarter of the album.  So for me, the album was a flop."

I can only speak from the perspective of someone who joined just over 3 years ago, but this subreddit used to only have just over 2k people and they were all freaking out because they didn't have any idea who I was, and I seemed to be 'in the know' at the time.

It sounds like the perfect infusion of Jaguar and the new Skrill. Anyways just because you don't like it shouldn't mean you should cast ill will towards it. Besides, the finished version will actually have proper mastering and will no doubt be a lot more varied than the pre-master. Don't you remember the Jack Ù album?"
skrillex,3asb43,plasmaticriver,-7,Wed Jun 24 14:55:03 2015 UTC,"Good god, this sounds awful IMO...the mix of the song makes me want to puke. Let's hope that this isn't the final"
skrillex,3asb43,hudsonmogul,3,Tue Jun 23 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"Nahh it isn't lol dont worry, you'll notice it says it's an edit in the tracklist. This is actually a super old demo version that they (back when WSN was duo) started playing around June 2014. They gave it to Dillon and he drops it a lot, but it's just the version that Emoh plays in his sets for whatever reason. IDK if Sonny got arround to giving him the updated master (from Jack Ü stream, holy ship, etc.) but I think he just plays it cuz it's the ""dubplate"" version. It's also a lot shorter and easier to use in mixes, like his live sets on the Gemini Tour."
skrillex,3asb43,plasmaticriver,5,Tue Jun 23 03:25:43 2015 UTC,"gotcha. that's weird though. In dillon's Something Wicked set, he plays it, and it sounds massive...and that's a live recording vs this mix  thanks for letting me know!"
skrillex,3asb43,hudsonmogul,2,Tue Jun 23 03:46:41 2015 UTC,"np and yeah like I said, it's a demo and it's kinda poorly mastered so it sounds okay live, but in studio you can really hear the mastering flaws. Not like it really matters tho, the updated one sounds fine. Here's my HQ reconstruction edit of that if you dont have it btw"

It's big, loud bangers with very very good production and fun guest spots. Some of his solo work is very smart and evocative, but not Jack U. Especially a song that features 2 Chainz."

I enjoy 2 Chainz because he's like that. I think that, unlike rappers similar to him, 2 Chainz is very aware of how dumb he's being and that makes him fun and cool to me.  We should expect better from artists than pure bullshit, but I can let it slide when the music is pretty much designed to rek festival and club dance floors - that's not really a setting for any kind of deep thought."

skrillex,3apmob,BioTechnix,2,Mon Jun 22 16:04:05 2015 UTC,"It's just... Better. One thing I can't avoid saying I dislike is that lately, Sonny seems to break up a lot of his drops with interludes, but in doing so shortens the drops to really bitesize portions. The drops are still good, but they're so short that I usually feel like I'm left wanting more, which is why when I did stuff like my Holla Out edit I ended up sticking the drops together to make lengthier drop sections."
skrillex,3apmob,BioTechnix,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:25:40 2015 UTC,Forreal. Having it seperated is like if FOTY had the more melodic part of the drop as the 2nd drop. The subtle differences sound so much better together.

However it's the earliest footage I can find of him in 2009. Probably doesn't help you but it's still interesting to see him at the beginning of his career (As Skrillex).
skrillex,3anruw,theEman40000,2,Mon Jun 22 01:16:12 2015 UTC,I'm working on a list of all live streamed sets and at the moment the earlisest is 24th march 2011 and the first video is that 6th of july Ottawa bluesfest show

I mean we got their permission to use any of their songs in the WYF podcast - which is available for free download. Let's be real here, it's a bunch of bloody photos of Skrillex and Diplo. Hardly impacting album/merch sales."
skrillex,3anci3,QuakePro,4,Sun Jun 21 22:29:13 2015 UTC,The backspin? Its a lot easier to do with CDJs than with other controllers given the fact that CDJs spin with the track. I've tried to do backspins with traktor and its a lot more difficult because the plate doesn't spin and a magnet stops it from spinning too much.
skrillex,3anci3,Syaoran07,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:33:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah the backspin, I just find it hard but when you watch someone like Skrill do it, he makes it look so easy, like my timing is off and all sorts haha & that's exactly my problem I think I use Traktor and it doesn't spin for that long."
skrillex,3anci3,TomLube,3,Sun Jun 21 22:47:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's just called backspin and actually considered a pretty amateur move. As someone else said, as you're mixing into another track just backspin the plate you're mixing out of really hard and switch to the new track (or put it about half way for a second as it spins)."
skrillex,3anci3,TomLube,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:15:31 2015 UTC,Yeah it probably considered an amateur move but it sounds really effective and a nice transition between tracks.
skrillex,3anci3,Syaoran07,2,Mon Jun 22 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wasn't trying to downplay it or anything. 95% of people you spin for will think it's cool :)"

skrillex,3akz3c,KrazyTrain18,5,Sun Jun 21 07:02:11 2015 UTC,"Real talk, I just happened to stumble upon that news video that led us to this while looking for a better recording of RaggaBomb WIP. It wasn't even tagged as Skrillex and the official version of that clip on the CCMA website actually cuts out the part with Skrillex at the beginning.  If we can find a setrip of fucking Barcelona ID, just by using teamwork we can probably find anything."
skrillex,3akz3c,Travdog,9,Sun Jun 21 13:49:38 2015 UTC,I like this way of thinking.  The problem is people like OP take advantage of situations like this for personal gain.  And that is why we can't have nice things.

skrillex,3agu97,Casualll,8,Sat Jun 20 01:35:25 2015 UTC,I don't think those are house songs at all. They are some of his most glitch hop-ish songs he has.
skrillex,3agu97,BioTechnix,2,Sat Jun 20 02:17:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't mean they're house songs. They're housey - they have house elements.   Take Cats Rats for example, and that disco-esque breakdown. That's straight up French House. It has house elements, without a doubt."

skrillex,3agu97,ThisPlaceLooksCool,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I guess you're right. I guess I was thinking more in terms of it not being electro-house since it just doesn't sound like that type of style, even with the tempo. I supposed Cat Rats is French Touch or something then."
skrillex,3agu97,plasmaticriver,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"I guess both songs aren't the easiest songs to classify. :P but yeah, Cat Rats is definitely French-inspired. No idea what genre it is though."

skrillex,3afarj,ryan077,2,Sun Jun 21 12:27:24 2015 UTC,im very drunk roght now but all i know is skrillex didnt use the stems of red lips to remix it
skrillex,3afarj,Unlucky_Narwhal,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:24:34 2015 UTC,"He certainly did, on the b section of the drop where the vocals come in, he's used a different chord progression from the original. It would sound horrible if he layed the original track (with the vocals and original chord progression) over his new progression, it would clash and shit."
skrillex,3afarj,ryan077,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:25:55 2015 UTC,"actually, he uses the transposition type called ""complex"" on ableton to pitch it down to -5, that then changes the sound of the vocals, and thats why the chords sound lower too"
skrillex,3afarj,Unlucky_Narwhal,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:15:10 2015 UTC,"Yea but what I'm saying is that there isn't a point in the track where the vocals are playing on their own, even if he transposes the chord progression of the original, the chords still aren't in the right order. You can't just remove the vocals from a track, it's like putting a cake in the oven and then asking to remove the flour once it's been baked.  That acapella I've posted below is the best anyone can do unless if you had an instrumental version of the track where it'd sound a little better but still, it wouldn't be as clean as the actual stem. I've removed the bass as much as I can but if I take anymore low end out of that, it'll start to thin the vocal out and make it sound tinny.  Why would Sonny even bother trying to remix a track without stems when he's in a position to get stems from pretty much anyone?"
skrillex,3afarj,Warau-Chan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:32:14 2015 UTC,"why would he transpose the vocals down with the chord progession to the same level at the exact same time, if they werent together and if they weren't, all i said was that he didnt use them for that particular bit"

skrillex,3aduhl,captain8ball,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:29:54 2015 UTC,I'm not totally sure. It definitely sounds like they did and rob posted something about the waveform of it being obviously his or something along those lines if I'm not mistaken. He said it in a non-vicious way though and said that he liked the album.
skrillex,3aduhl,plasmaticriver,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:05:24 2015 UTC,"He said on twitter ""drum sample royalties plz"" or something like that lol. Had a screenshot of the identical waveforms in ableton, didnt know if it was legit tho. Someone should try phase inverting them foreal"

This subreddit needs positivity in it and people all enjoy it, that's why I'm upvoted so much. People like you who don't like happiness are the only ones getting angry and using their multiple accounts and harsh words to get what they want, a feeling of accomplishment. But you've accomplished nothing at all. Meanwhile, your post only has ONE downvote, which is why it's at 50%. That's nothing for you to complain about. Now if it was at something like 11%, then that's something you can complain about.  TL;DR: Stop being a negative nancy."

If anyone needs to grow up, it's you. Stop taking things so seriously. You want to write pages of angry text at each other? So be it.  Everything should be ""OH EVERYTHING IS SUNSHINE AND DAISES"" positivity. Yes, but do you see posts like ""I think Skrillex is a massive cunt""? No, you don't. People label their posts as shit posts because they are afraid that people won't like them. They are discussion threads, not ""shit posts"". No, I wouldn't post a comment like ""Oh we love u too baby boi no post is shit"" because there are no instances where I would do that. Same, I've been around for 3 years and seen a lot, just like you. Don't resort to calling people you don't like ""12 year olds"" because their is nobody here that is 12. You're saying that this place lacks conversational content? You're harping on the ""shit posts"" that ARE actual discussion content, but you perceive them as shit posts because they are labeled that way. Your post is as of now sitting at 11 votes, which are half downvotes, half upvotes. Don't get so angry over your meaningless internet points friend.   Oh, my account has accomplished nothing? Why am I seeing a bit more positive comments in those threads I comment in? Such as /u/ValeraTheFilipino's response to my comment, thanking me for being one of their most positive replies, ever.   Sticky for a reason? That sticky is completely irrelevant to this. It's an unreleased community run directory. Not a ""have less shit posts and requests on the sub reddit"".   This isn't circlejerking. If you'd take the time to think about what you're saying, maybe you won't forget to take your meds next time.  So, instead of writing to me a wall of text, as well as insulting me when you can in various threads, why don't YOU grow the fuck up.  I'll be happily waiting for your overzealous reply."

While this Diplodocus one has good sounds, there just isn't enough melody or structure for me to follow. Even the sound design isn't as sophisticated as the other two I mentioned - it's more noisy and less ""full"" sounding."
skrillex,3a8ap2,cyberforte,3,Thu Jun 18 12:07:05 2015 UTC,"I guess I like it more because I was more a fan of his work as Ewun, when he made dark, aggressive and street-vibey drum & bass. I never cared much for his melodic stuff once he became KtN, so hearing him make a mean dnb track was just what I wanted."
skrillex,3a8ap2,RayRay_Sugarbutt,2,Thu Jun 18 12:55:22 2015 UTC,Kill the noise part I is the most nasty and brutal dubstep song out there. It can't get get more filthy.

skrillex,3a5eh5,thewholeukskinscast,2,Wed Jun 17 13:11:35 2015 UTC,Skrill's set last night was garbage. If it had been billed as Jack U I would have stayed home. I didn't need to stay out until 2 am to hear some generic hop hop edm top 40 bullshit. He didn't feed of the crowd's energy at all. He played his hometown crowd like he'd play anyone else. I love the guy but if Skrillex doesn't get back to being Skrillex soon I'll be very disappointed.

I was hoping he'd be himself and cater to people who actually want to see skrillex and could give two shits about diplo, but he just stayed the course and bored any real fans. I wanted to get into it, and I wanted people to get into it, but when he eventually gave us a few tastes of old skrilly it was already too late. I am slowly accepting the fact he is not a good DJ. I love sonny, and i'm critical because I love him, but god dammit Jack U needs to die already and diplo needs to stay the fuck away from sets billed as Skrillex."

I miss the Hey Sexy Lady era of Skrillex, he'd rarely play trap and hip hop. Just focus on bangers. He knew how to work a crowd. Recess was garbage minus maybe 4 songs tops. Fuck That, Ease My Mind, Fire Away and possibly Ragga Bomb. I want Diplo out of Sonny's hair, Diplo is a douche bag, and is utter garbage. I don't care if they are close friends or whatever, the only good thing that came out of Jack Ü is Sonny singing again. So Sonny get it together...."

skrillex,3a4vi8,plasmaticriver,0,Wed Jun 17 21:38:57 2015 UTC,How did you rip this? From the m4a stream?
skrillex,3a4vi8,plasmaticriver,3,Wed Jun 17 11:51:06 2015 UTC,"no, i keyed in the stream into my download manager and it revealed the m4a version and a higher quality mp3 version. i ripped drom the mp3"
skrillex,3a4vi8,plasmaticriver,-1,Wed Jun 17 15:18:19 2015 UTC,"I figured that out last night too lol, was gonna post it but good job. I did an edit with the intro from the Jack Ü mix with the tempo and pitch corrected, might post that later. Still need someone to remake the drums on the intro and outro tho. Phase inversion was a bust."

skrillex,3a69el,PimpinPedo,2,Wed Jun 17 15:47:40 2015 UTC,It's an amazing song
skrillex,3a69el,captain8ball,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:04:58 2015 UTC,Why do they not just call tracks like this collabs?
skrillex,3a69el,xTrill,3,Wed Jun 17 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"They prob should if he done a lot of work, but that's common in the music industry I think. I mean, we don't see all the people who played instruments for ""Uptown Funk"" credited as collaborators"
skrillex,3a69el,plasmaticriver,-1,Wed Jun 17 18:01:00 2015 UTC,"Cuz they aren't collabs. It says he played guitar on it and did some of the production/mixing/mastering/programming on it, but he did write any of the creative aspects of the track."
skrillex,3a69el,adicted2gravity,-1,Wed Jun 17 18:13:00 2015 UTC,It's ghost producing so they dont get any major credit other then cash
skrillex,3a69el,gazhere,3,Wed Jun 17 23:50:24 2015 UTC,Ah it all makes sense now :P

skrillex,3a4xh6,Acipere,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:14:11 2015 UTC,my speculation is a VIP. the vocal chops are textbook sonny. I'll upload my rip with both drops when I'm home.

skrillex,3a7vab,pedagogyedm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:32:23 2015 UTC,I liked it but it was slightly disappointing because I love the OG drop of Night Shine so much hahah
skrillex,3a7vab,TomLube,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:08:52 2015 UTC,Ehh. I'm not a fan of the first drop...the build up just doesn't fit the drop. But the second drop was great so I wanted to keep it.
skrillex,3a3g3e,plasmaticriver,2,Tue Jun 16 22:43:48 2015 UTC,Fucking love Space Laces
skrillex,3a3g3e,4ZA,2,Wed Jun 17 01:10:37 2015 UTC,"Ripped from Evolcast 009 - hosted by Gigantor  Also, here is an edit I made. I removed pretty much all the mixing, but the drop is still watermarked as fuck and I had to use the watermarked one to replace the second as the second has mixing entirely over it. Could not get a decent phase to remove it either, oh well. This flip was also made exclusively for the podcast, so I doubt he'll release it.  As always, enjoy. -plaz"

Such a shame for the 2013 one tho, if it hadn't been for him being worried about Recess tracks leaking, he might have not canceled the stream. Then we would've had Force AND crazy Break'n a Sweat DnB Drive/updated Cell intro finale thing."
