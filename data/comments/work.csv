Your recruiter will get your interviews based on your skills, interests, and price range. Don't tell your recruiter you'll work for $50k if you're going to turn down any offer under $70k. While it may seem like a good way to get your foot in the door, or a good negotiating tactic, it's pretty much a surefire way to upset the HR person who might try hiring you. Better to be honest about the salary you're looking for an negotiate within a reasonable range than to try to tack $20k onto your asking price.  Good luck!"

If you're tracking what you do, you can use that information to prove that you deserve more. If your teammate is bringing your team down, you can ask to switch teams so that you can excel.

Know that you are not alone, there are many, many introverts in your shoes, especially in this day of 'collaborative team work.' Here are a few tips I've learned over the years:   No one expects you to know everything off the top of your head. It's OK to say, ""hmmm, I'm not sure about that, let me do a little background research and I'll get back to you.""  We're a society of self-absorbed narcissists. Everyone feels nervous in these situations. Everyone is worried what other people are thinking about them. So worried, in fact, that no one will pay attention to what you're doing.  Get to know the common archetype of your fellow man. Take a few personality quizzes. There are tons of them out there; the Keirsey color wheel is one of my favorites. Learn who other people are and how to interact with them in the way they want to communicate. It will take some practice on your part, but no matter how the conversation goes they will leave it feeling satisfied. Be confident in your abilities. If they're asking you for help, it's because they don't know how to do something, and are coming to you, as the expert. You know more about this topic than they do, so believe in what you have to say (this one helped me a lot in graduate school).  Practice, practice, practice. Push yourself out of your comfort zone as many times a day as you can without having a nervous breakdown. They more you do it, the more you'll learn the cadence of a conversation, and it will become easier (never easy, just easier).  Last point: Hanging on and hoping for a promotion isn't going to make you feel better right now, and chances are getting promoted will only mean that you oversee people doing the same thing, meaning you'll have even less independent work and more interaction. Best get used to it now while you still can.    Apologies for errors, composed on my phone."
work,3cw5tm,kukainis,2,Sat Jul 11 07:33:51 2015 UTC,"You have to consider the cost/benefit of automating tasks. Sure, in the long wrong, automation is better because it is cost intensive at first but low-cost each iteration. (Here, effort is part of the cost). The question is: will there be enough iterations to warrant the initial investment in time, effort and money?  Consider that, for your colleagues who don't know anything about DBs or R, the initial investment is higher because they now need to learn something new, and since you're the only one doing it, they can't just take your files and expand your work from them. You really are putting them in a very tight position and it may not be worth it for them.  If you think about it, the mail merge issue isn't really worth it, because the long term is too long for the automation to pay off.  When it comes to R, then yes, there I grant you how much better R can be to Excel, but it is difficult to share the process with the client.   They any also already be predisposed to dislike you, so there's nothing you can do to ""win"" the argument.

I spent the last 5 years working full time and making a lot of money for my age in a job that made me completely miserable and made me wonder ""is this how I want to spend the next 45 years?""  I quit in December to finish this final year at school and have been living a frugal lifestyle since. I enjoy spending time with the people I love and exploring the outdoors in the Pacific Northwest. To me, time and life experience is more precious than money. After college, I plan on working part time which is enough to cover rent and a few bills and spend the rest of my time climbing, hiking, traveling, and doing what I love with my friends. I know I'll never drive the newest car or wear the coolest clothes but that doesn't matter to me or the people in my life anyway. Eventually, if a good career presents itself which allows me to be outdoors for most of my week and continue connecting with people and sharing my passion for the environment, I would take it and have no problem spending a majority of my week doing so. I've kind of declared retirement though since I never want to ""work"" another day in my life.   I think if you find the right position, spending 40 hours a week somewhere shouldn't feel like work at all. Until then, ask yourself if spending a huge chunk of your week and life in a place you aren't happy with is truly the best way to spend your time.

Maybe after responding or suggesting something, ask her for her opinion on the topic.  It puts a spotlight on her and her abilities.  You can also make notes during these meetings, itemize them, and then submit a weekly or bi-weekly report to your superior noting what you've accomplished and what Jane accomplished.  Straight factual.  It's possible that they recognize her inability, but they need ammunition to act and probably don't care enough to get any if the assigned tasks are being completed.
