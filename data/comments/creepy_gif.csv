creepy_gif,375s29,rollerGhoster,4,Mon May 25 05:33:44 2015 UTC,It didn't help that I'm Hispanic and most Hispanics grew up with some sort of aspect of La Llorona. The maze gave me nightmares . The entrance of the church and the wailing women didn't help.
creepy_gif,375s29,rollerGhoster,4,Mon May 25 06:55:02 2015 UTC,Same here. Hispanic. I love HHN I go every year. The most was so creepy. That year I brought my best friend too who is also hispanic. He was so scared just waiting in line for it he almost couldn't handle it.

creepy_gif,375s29,theodopolis13,2,Mon May 25 15:23:27 2015 UTC,"All the versions differ depending on who tells it to you or what region, but basically this mother fell in love with a man. He didn't want to have her because he didn't want her children, so she drowned her children in the river to be with him. Later he still didn't want her, so she killed her kids for no reason. She went on screaming and wailing the streets in sorrow for her children and looking for new children. Parents would say to go to bed or else La Llorona will get you and drown you. I guess in some regions they say the village made her wear a horse's skull to shame herself."
