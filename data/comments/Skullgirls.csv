Maybe that's just my live music background talking :P  I think some people's disappointment is linked to the non-gameplay things, you know? For a lot of viewers, production value contributes to their enjoyment in a huge way, and Combo Breaker, by comparison, was a much bigger spectacle. I still say, ""disspointed,"" is way too strong a word to describe it even in that comparison, though. It was a great tourney, and the pool stream and top 8 stream were both really awesome to see.  I know I'm not alone in appreciating your TO'ing ;)"

Got around four thousand people in the stream chat all watching some great matches.  Perhaps there is some lingering sourness that Skullgirls isn't on the main stage where it belongs. Maybe next year, eh? For a side tournament, it was still felt like a big deal, well-organized, and was entertaining. Could've been worse!

I have a lot of respect for all the players at evo and I'm glad they got to play but it felt like a lot of the play was sloppier than combo breaker and way less exciting. Kind of like people were winning not so much because they were making smart decisions but because the opponent made a pretty bad mistake(like dropping a combo) that I don't really feel like I should expect from high level play. Not to say the players weren't smart and made good choices, but I think sonic fox and swift fox are miles ahead of the other players because they are consistent and have set ups that the other players just don't have(I mean, did anyone really expect anyone else in the top two).   Maybe since there were newer players who aren't usually in the top 8 they weren't used to being in the spotlight and had a lot of nerves which made it worse for them.   I also feel like at combo breaker we had a lot of great pool matches as well and surprises(Like /u/digitalskyfire fighting skarmand).   Edit: the stream itself I have no problems with and I am really happy we got to just watch the top 8(with no blackouts or tekken tag tournament). I felt the commentators did a good job as well and props to them."

Skullgirls,3e31d5,Adwins,0,Tue Jul 21 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"100% disappointment at the tourney this year. No one came out, because everyone spent their money on Combo Breaker (Understandably so, mind you). This really made the outcome inevitable. I was hoping for a Mike ""Based Z"" Z upset, but instead I only got to see Mike ""Mike Ross"" Z. All in all, the game was rigged from the start.   The commentary really needed some work as well. I'm not trying to be a jerk (shoutout to that guy for stepping up to do it), we just got a lot of fidgeting and general uncomfortable-ness.   Oh, and one more of my whiny, first world complaints: Don't enter tourneys when the finals of your main game are going on, delaying the whole tourney and wasting everyone's time. That struck me as very rude and disrespectful to everyone who worked hard to make the side event happen.  All in all, I hope this game gets enough support with its official release to really see some cool stuff start to happen, but I don't think we are there quite yet."

It's not SonicFox's fault that SG finals and MKX top32 were scheduled for the same time, and he happened to be doing well in both of them. I RAN THE EVO SG TOURNAMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY START TO FINISH and I didn't find it the least bit disrepectful.

Skullgirls,3e04a0,Sauceofspace,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:33 2015 UTC,"I forget what the default is. So I cannot commentate on that. What I can say is. Try the Hitbox Stickless Arcade Stick layout but on a keyboard. For example when I was using a keyboard I did S,D,F,Spacebar for directions. That is S = Left, D = Down, F = Right, Spacebar = Up. I used the number pad 456 and 123 rows for LP MP HP and LK MK HK buttons. Put start and select where ever you want. With this layout you should be able to piano your fingers from left to right for a 360 input. Also in case it was not obvious. You can more or less mirror this layout to a certain degree if you want your directions on the right side and your punches and kicks on the left.  Something that may be of concern. Your keyboard may suffer from a low Key Rollover. Also known as NKRO. First, Key Rollover means how many inputs can your keyboard accept at one time. If a keyboard is labeled as 6KRO then 6 buttons can be pressed at once and each button will be registered at least once. NKRO means Infinite. As in unlimited keys can be pressed. Most cheaper keyboard are unfortunately not this cut and dry and make it difficult to figure out how many keys it supports pressed at once. I mentioned this because if your keyboard has a low Key Rollover value then it may impact your ability to input complex move combinations along with attack buttons.  Feel free to ask any questions if you have them."

Skullgirls,3e04a0,Razzeus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:52:46 2015 UTC,I did.   TLDR: if your keyboard is relatively cheap. It probably doesn't support more than 3 or so buttons being pressed at a time. Anymore and it simply doesn't register the input. This is a bad thing for fighting games.

Resets however may be harder to find. A basic reset you may be able to do with most characters: when, mid-combo, you land, do an instant airdash normal for a high reset, or dash then low/throw. Bam, 3-way reset. For characters that can't airdash try finding a overhead/jumping move that you can combo from, e.g. Parasoul's f.LP, Cerebella's j.HP, Squigly's divekick (I think)."

I don't know whether that makes them as good as teams yet, and considering no-one in the recent EVO top 8 ran a solo team, they probably aren't. At low levels however it doesn't really matter that much - once you've got a basic grasp of how your character works, know a BnB and know when to punish shit, you're going to do pretty well against like 50% of the online PC community (seriously).  In terms of learning the game though, I think it would serve you well to try to learn a duo or a trio, because that way you'll also have to learn to use a few mechanics that solos don't have (assists and DHCs obviously, along with raw tags and alpha counters). That way you won't have to waste time after learning your first character, by trying to understand where and when to assist, for example. Plus if you decide a team isn't for you, you can always just cut out characters and not have to learn anything new (apart from that snapback thing I mentioned)."

Skullgirls,3dyc00,arly803,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"It's a technique which forces your opponent to switch characters. You use it by doing a quarter circle forward and pressing the button combo for the character you want to swap to (mp+mk or hp+hk). It consumes a bar of meter, but it also gets rid of the red health the forced character was regenning while not in use, and it can allow you to get a kill from a happy birthday if you know an infinite wall combo set up."

Skullgirls,3dyc00,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"3 characters are not necessary for success, solo is underrated, duo is great.  That being said, having assists is the main reason you would want to have more than one character on your team, they add to the options you have at any given moment, which is valuable.  if you want my suggestion, start with a solo, practice the shit out of them and play online (don't worry if you lose a lot, that's going to happen a lot at first but it's not the end of the world) and learn the fundamentals of the game.  Then once you are very comfortable with your main and with the game's mechanics, start experimenting with different characters as assists, when you find an assist that compliments you playstyle and is good, try out that character, repeat this until you find a char that feels good in the duo.  repeat as desired until you don't want to learn anyone else, or you've learned everyone."

Skullgirls,3dxcx4,Sanwanchez,3,Mon Jul 20 09:00:40 2015 UTC,"Hi, fellow BB user here. H Giant Step works great. My brother plays with zoning characters (Peacock and Fukua) and it helps to get them close. You might want to try H Brass Knuckles if you are playing with Peacock or maybe L Beat Extend for close range. If I'm playing against a low range character I switch the assist to M Giant Step. It's slightly faster and it hit stuns the opponent enough so I can start my BnB.  Good luck to you in the future!"
Skullgirls,3dxcx4,n0837,2,Mon Jul 20 12:24:21 2015 UTC,"i don't see anyone use it or use it myself, but if it works out for you go for it.  I stick with lp beat extend for almost all of my teams, and hp brass for peacock."

Skullgirls,3dvlm8,Myed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:43:19 2015 UTC,"Latching on to this to note that any assists that require more than one button press are usually not a good choice because they only perform the first button input. Bang Bang Bang only shoots out one projectile, Elizas HP only does the first hit, etc. In all respects Peacocks cannonball (hp) is a straight up better assist than Bang Bang Bang as it serves the same projectile path and does more damage, but as arly said there are more optimal options out there."

Skullgirls,3du1cj,MrJHound,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I feel like if you kept doing j.mp and j.hp to annoy the opponent, they'll slip up and go in to hard on you. When they do, bam, blockbuster grab. Or, if you gave a punch charge, center stage into blockbuster grab. I myself haven't explored center stage much, as I've been doing fwd.hp for mixup, but I know there's some nasty stuff you can do."
Skullgirls,3du1cj,Mr12000,2,Sun Jul 19 15:39:59 2015 UTC,You can do some crazy stuff with stance cancels to go c.lk to fwd.hp into c.lk.   Against bad players you can just cancel the recovery of your heavy kick for example and watch as they think they can punish it.

Skullgirls,3du1cj,Mr12000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:21:54 2015 UTC,When you get a grab you can get a combo in if you spend a punch charge on a Center Stage. If you then end the combo with something that gives you some space you can easily get a charge in.  In my experience meter on Squigly is far to precious to use for extra damage. Especially in some matchups such as Parasoul where approaching is very hard without super.
Skullgirls,3du1cj,karhax,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:03:25 2015 UTC,"Good to note, thanks. The guys I play with regularly don't use Parasoul."

Make good use of them and any assists you may have (I like lockdown personally) and try not to get too predictable with your j.hp since it can be punished pretty easily. If you have a charge on Center Stage you can pull your opponent in literally any time they're doing something unsafe anywhere on the screen. Hit them with an SBO and start your set play.

Skullgirls,3ds0l8,M3YH3Mx,2,Sun Jul 19 01:18:37 2015 UTC,"Just learn to block. If you do get caught in a combo, pay attention. You need to be ready to react immediately when the combo is over, and be wary and ready to go if the enemy drops the combo early in order to go for a reset. If you are just zoning out, you've already lost."
Skullgirls,3ds0l8,Ordinaryundone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:39:37 2015 UTC,"hold away from your opponent on the d-pad/keyboard/hitbox/stick, that way the moment the combo drops (and it has to at some point, because of the infinite protection system and undizzy), you will be blocking.  next comes the big moment, the reset. Your opponent will try to get you into a new combo either by messing you up by doing high/low mixups (quickly alternating between moves that need to be blocked while standing and moves that need to be blocked crouching) or by attempting to grab you (which can't be blocked but if you input grab, lp+lk, just as you are grabbed you and your opponent will be throw back a short distance and no dmg will occur).  if you successfully avoid the reset you have a couple of things you can do.   If you blocked a mixup and are now in a blockstring (you being pressured by attacks, but you are blocking them), you can pbgc into something with fast or invincible startup (pbgc is push block guard cancel, if you pushblock by hitting two punches at the same time you push them back a short distance and recover to neutral and can do something).   If you've teched a grab reset, you're in neutral now, go back to neutral game.  when it comes to not getting comboed in the first place, block more. If you aren't doing anything else you should always be blocking."

Skullgirls,3dpsrw,Ordinaryundone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:57:23 2015 UTC,"Solo Peacock is definitely a thing, trust me. You've just gotta be more aggressive than you'd normally expect to be."

Like, I'm sure you could make it work, but... :/  I think I'd be doing you a bigger favor by just telling you to get another option. Get another option."
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,digitalskyfire,3,Sat Jul 18 03:41:42 2015 UTC,I used to play CvS2 with a GC controller and can confirm that it is better then an Atari 2600 controller for fighting games. It also worked pretty well for Tatsunoko vs Capcom.
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,shelcod,2,Sun Jul 19 06:06:32 2015 UTC,What controller would you recommend for skullgirls?
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,digitalskyfire,6,Sat Jul 18 04:08:39 2015 UTC,"PS3/4 controllers, 360 controllers, or fight sticks, those are all the most common options, and all totally viable."
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,ScarlettSerenity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:21:21 2015 UTC,"Also:  If /u/SomeGuyNamedW doesn't want to spend any money, keyboards work just fine for most characters, but if you plan on moving on to a pad or stick, learning to block again is hard as fuck."
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,DrOmnyx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:30:12 2015 UTC,I guess I'll stick with the keyboard for now until I find a better controller.
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,Navy_Pheonix,10,Sun Jul 19 02:51:32 2015 UTC,"I'm usually an advocate for using whatever input device you're comfortable with, but I have to make an exception for GC controllers for two reasons: There are literally not enough face buttons for standard inputs, and because Smash players really like them.  Check out Waifu's Input Device Guide for information on more-functional, less-Smash alternatives."
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,matthewrobo,2,Sat Jul 18 04:35:32 2015 UTC,"Well, a GC controller does have the same amount of face buttons as a 360, minus the Back button, and there's no LZ, so you lose one macro button.  It does still have 4 Face buttons for LP MP LK MK, the issue here is that they are arranged extremely strangely.  Then you have Z and R for heavies, and considering the iffy-ness of the Z button, I would say using a GC controller would make learning the game 50x harder."
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,Prime1153,3,Sun Jul 19 17:09:22 2015 UTC,"If you're using a GCC, you're probably using a computer. Try the keyboard.   For dashing, push two punch buttons instead of using the stick. More reliable."
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,GreaterEvilGames,5,Sat Jul 18 08:15:15 2015 UTC,"Get a different controller. You are not going to be able to play this game effectively if you're trying to use a GameCube controller.  Inputs for performing specials/supers are different for each character, and it depends on your button layout. Check out the command lists and play the tutorial."
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,matthewrobo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:28:05 2015 UTC,"At some point in the near future I'll be acquiring a GC pc adapter so hopefully I'll be able to assist you, until then try reconfiguring you controls to better suit a characters playstyle. Something I would recommend would be to map some controls to the C stick, such a one of your macros, and the Z button being your other macro.  As someone else said it's easier to press 2 buttons to do a dash. A low kick + heavy kick combo or similar Low + Heavy combo should be easiest.  Edit: /u/matthewrobo was the one who suggested to use 2 buttons"
Skullgirls,3dp6kj,GreaterEvilGames,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"I do not recall double kicking being a dash, but your comment did remind me of the macro function. With each button assigned, there are still a few inputs remaining. A macro can be set to two punches for easy dashing."

However, the GameCube controller is probably the worst possible gamepad you could use for any fighting game, and its really just not that viable outside of Smash (and even that part is debatable)  I'd recommend an actual PS3/ 360 pad , or a fight pad if you're dead set on using a controller, otherwise get an arcade stick."

Skullgirls,3dogjy,FluffyHuffy,2,Sat Jul 18 12:36:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I just bought skullgirls a while ago on the xbox and I got really into it so I bought gold membership just to play skullgirls online (I wasn't aware that the community was pretty non existent on xbox) and I was pretty disappointed when I tried to look for a match. I'm just surprised that I couldn't find a single person when I spent hours waiting for a match.
Skullgirls,3dogjy,NomNomicus,2,Sun Jul 19 15:38:49 2015 UTC,yea as someone who bought the game day one the xbox community is pretty dead i recently got it on steam when it was on sale. I would be glad to play with you xbox people if i had gold. I recommend getting it for steam as many others had suggested. you can scout the store for sales or this sub for whenever its on sale
Skullgirls,3dogjy,thetaco707,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:11 2015 UTC,"Will XBox 360 get all the relevant gameplay updates? Yes. Therefore, XBox 360 still serves as an accurate way to play Skullgirls. Updates may be late however due to how long it takes for Microsoft to certify patches. If you need to practise Skullgirls and discover tech for it, your 360 can still be used. However, if you want to play online, yes, the 360 version isn't ""relevant"". The vast majority of players in SG are on PC, and the Sony consoles will probably have a large contingent now thanks to 2nd Encore's release on PS4 (and its cross compatibility for online play with PS3 and Vita). I'm pretty sure there are still 360 players around (I think there was a 360 matchmaking thread on Skullheart), but you'll find a far more vibrant community on PC. Also, 360 hasn't been nice to SG in many ways, both in the difficulty of patching the game and the fact that it just didn't run the game well. Mike Z had to basically revamp the way the game's files were packaged so that SG would load well on 360, which meant that updates on all platforms (except PC) essentially had to re-download the entire game. So yeah, Xbox did suck.   Two weeks"

Skullgirls,3dnkqt,Prime1153,3,Fri Jul 17 20:27:33 2015 UTC,"There are two types of stun in this game, Hit Stun and Block Stun. The important one in your situation is Hit Stun. Whenever an attack connects, the character on the receiving end of the attack is placed into Hit Stun for a period of time ranging from a couple of seconds on certain moves, to only a couple of frames on some light moves. Because most moves recover from the animation or can be canceled into another move faster than the Hit Stun wears off, you can hit them another attack to perform a combo. Any Hit Stun from a new move will overwrite the Hit Stun of a previous move in the combo. If you are interested in investigating the Hit Stun properties of any move, you can enable the ""Hitstun Bar"" option in training mode to display a timer underneath a character every time you hit them.

I either catch them in the air and drop the c.mk, or drop the combo at the s.lk itself. I can do it maybe 10% of the time, but only if the jump-string carries the opponent to the corner.  Are there any tips or tricks to linking the airstring to the ground string?

If you can time it, I'm pretty sure Gigantic Arm can cover the screen, hit Peacock during the flag animation for Air Show, and put both of you in the corner, which is very good as you might imagine.  I'm not sure what to tell you as far as other zoners go. Peacock is easily the hardest to approach, and I know for a fact that Parasoul can be Gigantic Arm'd during Napalm Shot. I'm not so sure about Fukua, though."

Skullgirls,3de1qk,xWulf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:57:39 2015 UTC,"Well, something I like to do is cancel Grendel Sweep into his anti-air blockbuster. You have to time it well so you don't hit anything on the way up after your invincibility finishes.  If your arm is blocked you get some pressure because its basically a free jump in  (if your blockbuster doesn't hit anything you can just cancel it into a jumping normal) , and if your arm hits you can get a followup with that jumping normal if you time it right.   Either way you can get almost full screen distance for 1 bar, which I honestly don't think is bad because Beo does some major damage from combos and potential resets in the corner."

Skullgirls,3dbaqf,SadisticBuddha,7,Wed Jul 15 00:22:15 2015 UTC,"Yo, you're on point with other fighting games having an awful tutorial/training mode.   Growing up I briefly played Tekken, SC and Mortal Kombat but none stuck for the reasons you mentioned. None really stuck because of that punishing attitude and all around bad intro to the genre.   So yeah, thanks for covering a well deserved game that does the right stuff and kept me in the genre."
Skullgirls,3dbaqf,tiredocean,4,Wed Jul 15 01:25:46 2015 UTC,"I feel you, buddy! What excites me is to see how much this game could set a good example for the genre, too."
Skullgirls,3dbaqf,nice_nate,22,Wed Jul 15 02:06:36 2015 UTC,"You spend a minute or so complaining about the difficulty (or rather unfairness) of old-school fighting game bosses, and then you say that Marie is a fantastic end of game test? What? Marie was explicitly designed to be an incredibly unforgiving throwback to arcade FG bosses, and she completely is. I play on Nightmare difficulty (unfortunately I'm holidaying in a country where I have pretty shitty internet, so I can't get my online fix) and I still perceive that jump between matches that feel rather easy, and a practically unbeatable end boss. I've never noticed Marie reading my inputs (unlike Gill or SNK bosses), and her skull patterns can be deftly avoided if you have a character with a double jump (like Val), but she's still designed to frustrate and make you lose. Funnily enough, a few patches ago Marie's difficulty was actually toned down from the preceding fighters by two levels, so even if you pick Normal difficulty, you'll play against a Sleepwalk level Marie. It was mainly prompted by people who whined about overly difficult bosses...  I'm also highly skeptical with your theory that the story mode is designed to teach players to deal with various other characters. Painwheel isn't the only character that needs to get in close to be effective - yet Filia's story, for example, doesn't have Peacock as your first fight (which you claim is the way the game teaches you to deal with zoning). It's nice of you to think that Lab Zero were trying to use the story mode as a way to nudge players into understanding what their characters' moves do, but really, it does nothing that a regular arcade mode does. In fact, as there are almost no 2 or 3-character teams you have to face in the story mode, it can be argued that it does a worse job at preparing players, as it doesn't teach them how to deal with assists in a live environment.  In any case, I never really like critiquing the single-player offerings of fighting games, since it's always so weak compared to the real thing (fighting games by design are multiplayer, with single player kind of tacked on). By ""single-player"" I of course don't include the training mode, which is so fucking good it has ruined other training modes for me (playback as reversal should be in every fucking fighting game ever). The tutorial is also good, but it actually does more to teach players how to play traditional 2D FGs (e.g. Street Fighter) than Skullgirls, since it doesn't really mention resets that much and also does not teach you PBGC.  You complain that a lot of fighting games have too many characters, and that Skullgirls' small roster is helpful for new players who want to figure out what's best for them. While I would be the first person to tell you that a well balanced roster is better than a large one, I'm pretty sure the amount of characters in SG were there due to constraints of time and money, not a concious decision by LZ to make the game more accessible.  I could say more, but I think my previous sentence probably sums up my issues with this video. A lot of your praise for Skullgirls seems to be a sort of selection bias due to the fact, that as you say in your video description, it ""taught me how to not suck (as much) at fighting games."" Even though I agree with plenty of your points, they always seem to be from the perspective of granting accessibility for new players, with very little at what it brings to the genre for veterans. I really wish someone (other than Mike Z, of course) could go around and proselytise about the game and really go in-depth about it.  I know it's all about exposure and what best attracts new members to the community, but I always feel shortchanged by this stuff because there doesn't seem to be a lot of critique for ""us"" - being the people who are already here."
Skullgirls,3dbaqf,Livingwind,5,Wed Jul 15 03:04:12 2015 UTC,I think it's more important to attract new players than to tend to veterans. There is content out there for people that have already committed to the genre.
Skullgirls,3dbaqf,trulyElse,5,Wed Jul 15 06:19:16 2015 UTC,"The second I started watching this video, I got the PBG vibe of over simplification tied down by wacky noises.  While I do appreciate Skullgirls getting the attention it needs, the a Selection bias was o rely present in this video.  It is also kind of hard to add more to tiredocean's comment though."
Skullgirls,3dbaqf,trulyElse,3,Wed Jul 15 21:06:01 2015 UTC,"First of all I appreciate your feedback:   I wouldn't say that I am complaining about FG roster sizes, I even say ""having a huge roster is great"". As for story mode teaching you, clearly not every match is going to start with Peacock, but I used Painwheel's story as an example to help introduce unique player tools to the script since she has her ability to hover. I kept live-environments out of the equation entirely, if you are new to fighting games: you need to learn the basics before getting trashed online. Even if there are lobbies for certain skill-levels, I have played in a few with people who just look for easy wins.   I didn't make the video for people who are already fans of Skullgirls and fighting games, I myself am clearly not a veteran player and am very new to the fighting game scene, so I have no business pretending to be an authority on the matter.  I wanted the video be accessible; I talked briefly about little aspects of fighting games like match-ups  (Painwheel V Peacock)  and the basics of training mode, I even give a description of what a hitbox is. I am clearly not making the video to tell hardcore fans what they already know and I am not going to clutter my video talking about every single intricacy of Skullgirls and the history of all fighting games. Fighting games have so much to offer and I would rather not spend the rest of my year making an hour long video.  Thanks for the comment, I hope you enjoy your holiday!"

I was mildly confused about using Eliza's taunt for OLoS while Sekhmet is out.  By the by, maybe i just wanted a fancy looking combo to generally blast my opponent mentally.

Skullgirls,3d9xm3,fuzeebear,3,Tue Jul 14 19:37:44 2015 UTC,"A conversion means going from some random hit (reversal SSJ in this case) to a full combo.  You're ""converting"" the hit into a combo."
Skullgirls,3d9xm3,arly803,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:06:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! Does the difference between a conversion and a chain just depend on what the plan was if the hit did not confirm?
Skullgirls,3d9xm3,Adwins,3,Tue Jul 14 20:09:34 2015 UTC,"Say I'm Peacock and I get an ground throw. I could just let it finish and end in a sliding knockdown (no conversion), or I could do something like this to get a lengthy combo off of it. People usually know how to convert from c.LK and such, since that's what most BnBs start with, but it's also important to learn (or invent) conversions for various other situations: ground/air-throws, reversals, air-to-air hits, assist hits, etc.  The distinction between conversions and hit-confirms is that with a hit-confirm, you're trying to decide what to do based on whether or not your opponent is getting hit, so you don't let them block an unsafe move. Conversions usually apply in situations where you have plenty of time to see that you've gotten a hit, but need to to know/have practiced how to get a combo from it.  Chain is just a term for moves cancelled into each other, regardless of the situation."

Skullgirls,3d9o0a,brocoder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:59:30 2015 UTC,Medium or Heavy Shadow can work well. Medium is good at limiting your opponent's approach (is a decent ranged anti-air). Heavy keeps Fukua back and adds an overhead for keeping the pressure on. Heavy Platonic Relationship can be good for keeping pressure on or adding damage to combos.  Try out the different moves and see what's good for your playstyle.

Are you going with full zoning/runaway? Maybe you want something like M Shadow or H Dart to take up space and get in your opponent's way.  Are you trying to frustrate your opponents with zoning, then take advantage of their frustration to open them up when they try to get in? Maybe you want something like L Shadow that'll set you up for combos.  Are you trying to straight-up rush that shit down? Maybe you want H Drill or Inevitable Snuggle."

Skullgirls,3d0gnq,Screedledude,23,Sun Jul 12 13:39:18 2015 UTC,"To taunt, you press a combination of buttons that varies from character to character. A few taunts have effectively no effect, but a few have actual effects.  In the character tutorials for every character with a useful taunt, the taunt is mentioned in its own little section about what it does. These are Robofortune, Eliza, Peacock, Beowulf, and Big Band.  All taunts, even the effectively useless taunts, are listed in the command list of each character.  The useful taunts are:  Eliza: mk lp down lk mp. This allows attacks with Sekhmet to restore Eliza's health and the ability to use Lady of Slaughter from Sekhmet while Sekhmet is out. The effect wears off next time Sekhmet is returned to her body.  Big Band: forward hp mp lp forward. This adds an extra tuba-tuba effect to Supersonic Jazz or adds an extra bell hit after Tympani Drive. You can also hold down the punch buttons at the end to make him play music for longer.  Peacock: lk hk mp mp up. This makes your next Shadow of Impending Doom that reaches the final stage (third stage) the second most damaging one, with the spiky balls that drop from the sky. If the next Shadow of Impending Doom doesn't reach the third stage, the taunt is wasted.  Robo-Fortune: hp lk back lp lp. This makes your next Headdrone Missiles double in number. And you say a funny line.  Beowulf: lp mp forward lk mk. This builds one level of hype, which is his unique mechanic.  The useless taunts (from this page):  Filia: Born With It (LP, MP, forward, MK, MK). It can hit the opponent for 5 damage, but can’t kill.  Cerebella: Medici Muscle (LP, MP, back, LK, MK). Boosts the chances of a cat from Lock n’ Load hits to 25%!  Parasoul: Bâillement (LP, HP, back, LK, HK). Encourage your next Egret Call to be a bit more sassy! (Excuse me, princess).  MsFortune: Nyaaawn (HP, LK, forward, LP, LP). Heals 5 recoverable damage.  Painwheel: SMILE (MK, HK, down, MP, HP). It can hit the opponent for 5 damage, but can’t kill.  Valentine: Chocoglycemia (LP, MK, back, MP, HK). Heal 5 recoverable damage! Build up!  Double: False Intentions (LP, LK, MK, HK, HP, MP). Donate 1% meter to your opponent!  Fukua: Breakdown (LK, MK, back, MP, MP). Donate 1% meter to your opponent!  There's also Squigly, whose taunt is part of some super secret dealings. From the page: Snake Charmer (LP, LP, forward, LK, HP). It… looks cute!  But if you have five meter, both charges, and have done the taunt, then doing the taunt in reverse (lk lk forward lp hk) will do her 'secret' level five."
Skullgirls,3d0gnq,CocoKyoko,2,Sun Jul 12 14:06:23 2015 UTC,If I'm not mistaken. Peacock's taunt prepares the second most damaging one. Road roller does more damage does it not?
Skullgirls,3d0gnq,Oh_Riginal,2,Sun Jul 12 19:05:28 2015 UTC,it makes me sad it doesn't bring out road roller just cause it's awesome
Skullgirls,3d0gnq,genericgamer,2,Mon Jul 13 02:11:51 2015 UTC,the reason it doesn't is because it's the input for Lei-Lei's Tenrai Ha from Vampire Savior/Darkstalkers 3

Skullgirls,3d0gnq,genericgamer,2,Mon Jul 13 17:10:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're quite right. I couldn't find any figures for the damage of Tenrai Ha or Road Roller drops and I read on Shoryuken that Tenrai was the highest damage.  After using training mode for some time, I managed to get the Roller. The Roller does 3000 damage in 14 hits, though only the last hit actually did damage. The Tenrai Ha never did above 2380 damage in the tests I did.  The Tenrai Ha does one hit of 1300 damage, then 7 hits of 200 damage for a total of 2700. Scaling kicks in, so the actual damage is lower that that (and any hit after the third does less than 200 damage).  Corrected! I agree with /u/genericgamer that Road Roller should have been the one. The birdie thing even appears with her taunt!"

But yeah, it's just something you get used to as you play your character.  Out of bypass Val is now in neutral state (I think), so you can do another bypass (of different strength), airdash, supers."
Skullgirls,3d06zv,Kuroonehalf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:41:01 2015 UTC,what chains are best to use after an airdash from bypass? everything ive tried seems to whiff or knock my opponent too far away
Skullgirls,3d06zv,Fluffy_Ducks,2,Sun Jul 12 13:13:11 2015 UTC,"Here are two bnb combos you can look at:   http://youtu.be/Xs5uAN5qPbg  http://youtu.be/4hl4eJoUmlQ  If you're having trouble doing them you can always run and do a ground chain off of the otg hit(if you don't mind your combo being super short). Lots of bypass combos depend on the weight of your opponent, the time you airdash out or the height of the two of you. Usually if I get a raw bypass I just run and do launcher so I can combo in the air afterwards"
Skullgirls,3d06zv,brocoder,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:14:49 2015 UTC,That's only on hit; on block you're still screwed.

Skullgirls,3d06zv,SwissCheeseMan,2,Mon Jul 13 15:26:07 2015 UTC,"I found with peacock she stays in place a little bit before moving forward in an air dash. It makes her look more cartoony which I love, but throwing out your next attack before she actually moves forward will keep you in place. Try messing around in training mode to see what different timings can get you. I believe if your next attack came too soon after the dash you'll go straight down while throwing out the attack, too late and the opponent can block, but feel free to prove me wrong because I just got the game in summer sale."
Skullgirls,3d06zv,shadowdude777,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:03:38 2015 UTC,"Try some simple chains. One of my favorite combos to do with Valentine is:  c.LK -> c.MK (1 hit) -> c.HP -> jump j.HP -> Bypass (L) -> airdash -> j.HP -> Bypass (H) -> land run up -> c.LK (OTG hit) -> s.HK x3  This is a really short combo that does a lot of damage (almost as much as ""fully optimized combos""), it's ultra-easy to do once you get the hang of the 2nd line with the weird air chains, and since it's short, your opponent doesn't gain a lot of meter from you doing it."

Teabag her character, not mine. I think it's also very poor sportsmanship to do something like that in a tournament designed for beginners. How do you think behavior like that reflects on the community? Some are going to turn away from SG because they won't want to participate in a community that encourages rude behavior. Others will just see that as the norm and start doing it themselves because that's 'what the cool kids are doing'.  That tournament was created for beginners. I myself take it seriously, because I'm there to win. I'm sure many others in that tournament are there to win and prove something to themselves and their peers. But if people show up with your mindset that ""i was mostly under the impression we were using our secondary characters/teams"" nobody else will take the tournament seriously either, and you'll ruin the experience for the newbies that deserve a tournament of their own.

In fact, i specifically went through the rules and skullheart post to remove all wording of ""beginner"" http://skullheart.com/index.php?threads/i-wanna-be-the-skullgirl.7410/  So again, there must be some miscommunication somewhere because i still dont get how this was a beginner focused event, i was actually entering because i want to improve my main team but was denied such.

Skullgirls,3cyle1,fuzeebear,5,Sat Jul 11 23:23:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely a cool idea. My hand didn't seem to like it much unfortunately. The right side of my hand ended up fatigued after running through arcade mode for a bit to get used to it. I guess I use the lights and mediums way more than the heavies, and my ring finger wasn't hardcore enough to cope with mashing the lights.  On the plus side, combos felt a little more ""punchy,"" weirdly. Hitting HP with the index finger to launch is kinda satisfying for whatever reason. And moving from right to left in combos did feel pretty smooth. Could all be placebo tough.  tl;dr - my hand is too much of a filthy casual to use this. But it was fun anyway"
Skullgirls,3cyle1,Aurelyn,2,Sun Jul 12 01:40:28 2015 UTC,"I press the buttons with my left hand, so it's kinda the same?"
Skullgirls,3cyle1,FluffyHuffy,2,Sun Jul 12 00:56:45 2015 UTC,In that way working from left-to-right would follow the natural pink-to-index flow! Do you have a special arcade stick or do you use keyboard?
Skullgirls,3cyle1,Dawngaward,2,Sun Jul 12 09:50:56 2015 UTC,"I'm on a keyboard, QWE punches ASD kicks and arrow keys movement.  It's because the first fighting game I played was KOF XIII and in that game combos are made up mostly by special moves and supers have complicated inputs, so it made sense at the time to use my dominant hand to do motions.  But the layout stuck and I still use it all the time and it's really comfortable to me."

Skullgirls,3cyle1,spaceflare_rebs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:02:40 2015 UTC,"I would give the standard layout a bit more time before deciding to switch to one that radically different. Seth Killian started playing cross-handed because it seemed more natural; ask him about it now and he'll tell you he thoroughly regrets it.  Also consider that you usually can't customize button config in arcades,  it would be much harder to read input overlays, etc."
Skullgirls,3cyle1,brocoder,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:25:43 2015 UTC,"Pretend you're bored, and tapping your fingers to pass the time. You work from pinky to index. It feels natural.   Yeah, but that doesn't apply to chains in FGs, because you never press buttons that fast anyway. The only time in SG where you have to move your fingers that fast is for taunts, and in Big Band's case, the buttons go from HP to LP anyway."
Skullgirls,3cyle1,tanbu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:05:31 2015 UTC,"I guess you tap faster than I do when you're bored.  I was referring to the motion, not the speed at which the motion is executed. It was only to articulate an example of how that the particular motion of pinky-ring-middle-index feels natural to me.   Unrelated but still worth mentioning, 1-frame links - SG doesn't have those, but some games do - will require a very fast input."
Skullgirls,3cyle1,tanbu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"Of course the progression from pinky to index feels more ""natural"", but that's never a consideration for anything got to do with muscle memory and precision. Any initial discomfort can be overcome with practice; all you're doing with mirroring the button layout is making button config messed up if you ever want to play at a local.  The 1 frame link argument is also misguided. A ""natural progression"" does not imply an increase in the precision of inputs (which is what 1f links need). Also, very 1f link I've had to do allowed for me to reposition my hand slightly so I could press the necessary button easily.  Where you do have a point is doing kara-cancels, where the rolling of buttons from heavy to lights are much easier. For example, I can do Elena's kara-throw in 3S easily because it's just MK~LP+LK, so I can just quickly rotate my hand to do the motion. However, I can't do roll cancels in CvS2 at all, for instance, because I need to press LP+LK and then do a special motion and press HP or HK. Of course, I could just practice roll cancels for a while...  EDIT: A couple of years ago, when I was getting into FGs via SFIV and SFIII:3S, I was also thinking about changing button layouts. I was too lazy to do it, and now I am more than comfortable with the standard layout; it's just natural."
Skullgirls,3cyle1,tanbu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:39:40 2015 UTC,"Well now you're moving goal posts, my mention of 1-frame links was just in response to your statement that no fighting games require timing as quick as tapping one's fingers."
Skullgirls,3cyle1,tanbu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:54:45 2015 UTC,"I was saying you never have to tap buttons in quick succession for doing chains (in GG, if you tap buttons too quickly, they won't even come out). Either way, 1-frame links aren't about speed. They are about the precision of timing."
Skullgirls,3cyle1,Kiyobi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:26:08 2015 UTC,"I follow your reasoning overall, but precision and speed are factors for inputs that are required to be one frame apart."
Skullgirls,3cyle1,Kiyobi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, now I understand what you were saying.  Inputs that are 1 frame apart aren't 1-frame links. They are technically, but such inputs are almost always called something else (e.g. kara-throws, kara-cancels, ""the knee"").  As I said before, when I mentioned kara-throws and roll-cancelling, when you have to make two seperate button inputs that are 1 or just a few frames apart, you do have a point. It's just that for everything else, no change in layout is better than just practicing to get better at doing the input with a normal arcade layout."
Skullgirls,3cymbr,cwolfcommander,17,Sat Jul 11 23:32:07 2015 UTC,"It might help solidify some of your thoughts on this to know that if we get to make a full sequel someday, Marie, Umbrella, and Black Dhalia are DEFINITES in terms of new characters to add to the roster.  Also, I don't know why people speculate that we might reuse assets and have all of the original cast return in a sequel. Considering our game is 2D-animated, and has a small roster compared to other fighting games, it would be foolish of us not to include the full cast from the original game."
Skullgirls,3cymbr,earlfriend,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:29:33 2015 UTC,"had a feeling regarding at least Marie and Umbrella, given Umbrella's standing in the Pre-Double Roster and Marie's popularity. Black Dhalia I wouldn't have expected as a Definite but can totally dig it.     As for the reusing assets thing, kinda seems like it would be the obvious choice to bring back the full set. There's a Reason MvC2 had such a massive roster after all, Bringing back characters just makes sense in a standpoint like that, only reason I could see not to would be complete removal of them thematically (i.e. Why we wouldn't see Blackheart in Children of the Atom), and I can't see anybody in the Skullgirls roster who'd fit that descriptor."

I don't know about how many active players there are on ps3, but if you're looking to get serious about the game I'd get the pc version, because as far as I know, that is the one with the most active playerbase (and there is also potential that pc will get all ps4 content)."

If you have a PS4, and don't have all of the DLC characters downloaded for your PS3 version, it's probably best to pick up 2nd Encore.

Skullgirls,3cxdw0,Immortails,3,Sun Jul 12 08:35:09 2015 UTC,Skullgirls is a fantastic first time fighting game. I'd suggest working through the tutorials as they are some of the best I have seen in any fighting game ans will teach you most things you need to know in a beginner friendly way.
Skullgirls,3cxdw0,Steviewonder322,2,Sat Jul 11 18:02:18 2015 UTC,"Stick with what you have, and learn the game - tutorials, story mode, etc..  If you end up really enjoying it (I did!) but have none of the DLC characters, then go ahead and get 2nd encore. It has all the DLC characters built in.  EDIT: beowulf and robo fortune are free, snatch them up. But don't bother buying the other characters - if you're gonna drop $20 on characters alone, then you might as well spend $25 on the new version that comes with them all."

Skullgirls,3cxoaz,GuytheFun,15,Sat Jul 11 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of reasons you shouldn't get too used to playing the beta instead of the main client. One is that the active player base is smaller. The other is that the ""endless"" beta won't last forever. We are likely going to close it relatively soon now that all of the DLC characters have been released.  The entire purpose of maintaining a beta version was so that we could tweak balance, identify bugs, and experiment and fine-tune gameplay changes. We let everyone playing the beta use all of the characters not just because we're nice, but it was necessary to properly test balance. That's largely unnecessary now, so you won't be able to keep playing those DLC characters you don't technically own forever. ;)"

Skullgirls,3cwuw2,SavageKinkajou,3,Sat Jul 11 13:55:23 2015 UTC,"In skullgirls team building isn't as important, there are characters that work well with each other and have specific setups but most of the time you can just pick 3 characters you like and it'll work out great.  Parasoul is used mostly on point, she builds quite a bit of meter and likes the round start position but you can also use her as an anchor, Big Band is an anchor character, he has amazing assists and needs meter to work well. About the other characters... you'll have to ask someone else.  Solos can work, they have a lot of life and do a lot of damage but teams are generally considered better (I also personally hate solos)"
Skullgirls,3cwuw2,FluffyHuffy,3,Sat Jul 11 14:28:15 2015 UTC,"Just a little add for solos: They are typically harder to play because you don't have as many options. You lack assists, which means they don't have to be careful of anything but you. This can make getting out of the corner or getting in a lot harder. Completely viable though."
Skullgirls,3cwuw2,omegareaper7,3,Sat Jul 11 17:27:37 2015 UTC,"The usual team game things apply. If your character functions well with meter even if they don't have an assist to back them up, they're good as an anchor. If they build meter well, they're good on point. If one of your characters is much stronger with a particular assist, such as Filia with an assist that helps her approach or Peacock with an assist that fills the gaps in her zoning, then choose an order that lets them use that assist.  Don't pick a character just for their assist if they don't suit you as a player. You're pretty much always better off replacing them with a slightly worse assist attached to a character that you're much better with, or removing them from your team entirely for the extra damage and health. This is especially true if you're using a team based around zoning or chip, because that extra damage is a big deal if you can't try to make up for your lower damage with more resets.  Solos are fine as long as your character can function well without assists and without a ton of meter. The only character who has an especially hard time doing this is Peacock, and possibly Robo Fortune too but I'm only saying that because she's too new for me to know one way or the other. Just remember that even if you don't have any assists yourself, you still need to be good at baiting, punishing, and generally playing around your opponents' assists. Don't be one of those beginner solo players who cries about teams being overpowered because they haven't got any team game experience."
Skullgirls,3cwuw2,MrPeckerston,3,Sat Jul 11 17:13:35 2015 UTC,"Due to the smaller cast than say an MvC game and being a pretty well balanced game, you can build a team just about any way you want. That being said, there are teams out there that have been formed just like and MvC team. Using the right assists to cover the gaps in other characters game plans. There are no bad characters in this game, imo. That being said, there are some characters you wouldn't want to play solo ( Val, Squigly, Peacock...).  Find a character you like, looks like Beo which is good because I think he might be top 3-5 in the game, put together a game plan, find assists to help that. Beo has limited movement options compaired to the rest of the cast so helping him move across the screen is always good, Big Band H Brass, Para Tear Shot, and Squigly Center Stage would all help with that and give you good set ups when you do get in. You might be able to find some cool DHC things so play around with that too. Team building is fun with the ability to use any move, even dash, as an assist. (have still yet to see anyone use dash assist alpha counters)"
Skullgirls,3cwuw2,3DPK,2,Sat Jul 11 17:54:03 2015 UTC,"Red Mage was using backdash assists the other night in tournament. I didn't quite understand the implementation until she started using alpha counters. It was a novel idea, but I wasn't sure if it was worth giving up assists for, unless there is another reason to use it outside of alpha counters."
Skullgirls,3cwuw2,DeerAZ,2,Sun Jul 12 15:09:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen on so far and I've been playing since day one. Unless you're the type that using an assist as bait is part of your main game plan, I don't think it's that good of an option. I mean, using Locked n Loaded to alpha counter into 360 is good enough for me."
Skullgirls,3cwuw2,3DPK,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was my logic as well. I figured that using platonic drill for the invincible startup would be more than good enough for alpha counters."
Skullgirls,3cwuw2,DeerAZ,2,Sun Jul 12 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"2 or 3 chars is usually what you want, so that you have access to assists.  as for your characters  squiggly, beowulf and parasoul are great on point  parasoul(Napalm Pillar or napalm shot) and bigband(light Beat Extend or heavy Brass knuckles) are powerful assist characters and so make great second/anchor choices  i don't know how well beo does second/anchor now since chair throw assist got nerfed a while back  so if you wanted my suggestion it'd be  3 man :  Beo/squiggly on point parasoul on second (napalm shot assist) and BigBand on anchor (light beat extend)  2 man : Beo/squiggly/parasoul on  point, BigBand on anchor (light beat extend)"
Skullgirls,3cwuw2,arly803,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"Generally, characters that tend to use more meter, can function well without assists, and/or have strong assists themselves should go later in the team; characters that tend to build more meter than they need, gain more from having assists, and/or don't have particularly good assists themselves should go earlier."
Skullgirls,3cwuw2,LifeSmash,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:05:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, positions on this team are not all that important. Everybody benefits from being a point character, as assists are always beneficial. Most characters (pretty much everybody except Val) is a usable second character on a trio, because they all either have a strong dhc or a strong assist (Beowulf has hp chair assist, arm dhc for damage, jump dhc to be somewhat safe; Squigly has c.hp assist, sbo dhc; parasoul has pillar/shot, and bikes is an okay dhc). Anchor is a little bit harder, as you want a character that has an all around amazing assist (Big Band hp brass, lp extend), but more importantly, should not be reliant on assists, yet still be competant at fighting assists. Big Band is not that scary in neutral, but one good read and their assist is bleeding for the rest of the match.   Between your four characters, I'd probably do Beowulf/Squigly/Big Band, Parasoul/Squigly/Big Band, Beowulf/Big Band, or Parasoul/Big Band, depending on whether you want duo or trio."
Skullgirls,3cyfk9,Drawlestia,8,Sat Jul 11 22:28:55 2015 UTC,"There isn't a priority system, it's based on hitboxes and hurtboxes, invincibility also comes into play."

Skullgirls,3cyfk9,TheBigBruce,2,Sat Jul 11 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"http://wiki.shoryuken.com/Skullgirls/Game_Systems/Advanced_Attacks#Blockbusters  No priority system, most supers in this game just have invuln startup. So normals will whiff on a super unless the normal can land a hit after the startup"
Skullgirls,3cyfk9,Aurelyn,2,Sat Jul 11 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"It's whose hurtbox gets hit by the hitbox first.  In other words, if two Big Bands try to do L Brass at the same time, whoever hit box (the giant fist) hits a Big Band (the other fat robot smooth jazz man) wins the interaction."

Skullgirls,3cyfk9,Blisteredhobo,2,Sun Jul 12 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"To be more specific, it's all about timing (some moves have  hurt boxes that come out sooner-- low startup frames, and some have moves that stay out longer-- high active frames) and placement. There are moves that are immune to certain types of hits  (peacock's qcf+p is immune to hits on light and throws on medium if I recall correctly) but if two players have moves that overlap each others' hit boxes at the same time, they'll both be hit. There's some knowledge to be gleaned about what your characters are immune to when, and what moves might just have poor frame data."

Skullgirls,3cvs9a,BabyEatingFox,2,Sat Jul 11 06:33:04 2015 UTC,Better options are going to be the characters you're good at and like. I chose Big Band because I feel I can't use Squigly when someone is using range against me. You may be a little different. Someone who has a lot of range is going to be the best with Squigly.

Something Squigly lacks is a reliable reversal, so someone like Parasoul or Filia are good for their reversal assists (Napalm Pillar, Updo).  EDIT: My Steam is in my flair if you want to play some and I can show you Squigly stuff."

Skullgirls,3cvs9a,Adwins,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:56:03 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree with Napalm Pillar being a reliable reversal. It's certainly useful in some situations, but if you're put into the corner and dealing with a flurry of high/low mixups, you can easily be hit high while charging it. And unlike Guile's flash-kick, it's way more baitable since it can also be air-blocked.  I find it's mainly useful in situations where you know your opponent is going to be pushing buttons, and where you have enough time or good positioning that won't result in you getting hit high while charging.  </pedantic>"

Skullgirls,3crii4,CK_Crash,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:14:52 2015 UTC,"Get both charges, 5 meter, taunt, then do the taunt input with punch/kick buttons swapped"
Skullgirls,3crii4,Navy_Pheonix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:27:51 2015 UTC,"You need to charge both of her resources, use the taunt, then input Akuma's Raging Demon Input Reversed, LK LK > LP HK. It's a secret Level 5.  As far as Mongert's question though, no. The only characters that use their taunts for actual game-changing mechanics is the DLC characters, ranging from Big Band getting extensions to his supers, to Robo Fortune getting more Missiles from her heads.  Peacock is the only exception to this rule, as her taunt makes her next fully charged impending doom always Tenrai Ha (or maybe Road Roller?), which deals significantly higher damage.  Edit: Painwheel's can hit for a little bit of damage too."
Skullgirls,3crii4,jaytorade,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:40:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the information

Skullgirls,3crii4,weealex,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:31:11 2015 UTC,"False.  It's totally worth it on the Transit stage.  It's one of the two ways to summon the hype train.  It does have some invincibility too, so you can use it as a good PBGC.  I mean, you get more damage out of DP xx SBO into full combo, but 7777 damage is still half the health of a trio character."

Skullgirls,3crqid,thunderboyac,3,Fri Jul 10 07:26:44 2015 UTC,I use the DPad to do the quarter circles and the stick to move
Skullgirls,3crqid,Dronfax,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:30:43 2015 UTC,"D-pad is the faster of the two (less travel time, digital, etc). I'd go with that. It's not like the stick is that much worse, though. Some people use it to great effect. It's really whatever feels best to you."
Skullgirls,3crqid,digitalskyfire,2,Fri Jul 10 06:23:28 2015 UTC,"I think the D-pad is generally better too but I'm having issues doing quarter circles let alone do the one's that look like z's with it.   I was wondering if it was viable to use the analog stick as I fear it can be inconsistent. MKX was the first fighter I played and nobody really uses analog stick for that reason, though it seems that's not the case for SG."
Skullgirls,3crqid,jonmsanti,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:09:06 2015 UTC,"this game is hella lenient with their QC's make sure all of your directions are working in training mode and don't forget your diagonals! Also a tip for the 'z' move, forward then QCF grants you the DP. so like tap forward, then immediately do qcf+Hp and you should have successfully pulled off a DragonPunch."

Skullgirls,3cmhpj,MystyrNile,9,Thu Jul 9 01:37:24 2015 UTC,Her normal throw is good in the corner since diamond drop moves them behind you and merry-go-rilla might not be in range.
Skullgirls,3cmhpj,lolpounder,3,Thu Jul 9 01:50:41 2015 UTC,"On top of this, if you ever get a normal throw mid screen you can do cerecoptor into super.

Skullgirls,3cmhpj,Fluffy_Ducks,5,Thu Jul 9 14:00:41 2015 UTC,"that they won't really expect(cerebella almost never uses normal throw)   Does it matter that they don't expect normal throw? Defending against it is the same as her command grabs, jump."
Skullgirls,3cmhpj,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if they're jumping do something else. Cerebella's throw is bad mid screen except in the specific situation where the link can kill and you manage to get a throw on them(but there are probably a bunch of other options you have as well). Sometimes if you're down to the wire and the opponent and you are just tip toeing around it can work- not a great tactic otherwise, but a useful link to know."
Skullgirls,3cmhpj,spaceflare_rebs,2,Thu Jul 9 18:03:36 2015 UTC,"Wow that sounds cool, i'll have to experiment with that."
Skullgirls,3cmhpj,Captain_Ochinchin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:28:14 2015 UTC,you can also grab them with excellebella and go into super off the normal throw  not sure which has better scaling though if you wanted to get max damage
Skullgirls,3cmhpj,TheBigBruce,5,Thu Jul 9 14:22:57 2015 UTC,"her airthrow is usually better than grab bag because you can combo out of it and it doesnt take 9 years to recover on whiff  groundthrow is good cus you can choose which side to throw your opponent, and it has a good compromise of range and speed. plus you cant throw tech with other throw inputs iirc (even though diamond drop is throw-invincible...)  (is mgr throw-invincible?)"
Skullgirls,3cmhpj,erkicman,2,Thu Jul 9 05:04:36 2015 UTC,"According to SRK's wiki it is, but not on startup."

Skullgirls,3ck46l,FluffyHuffy,13,Wed Jul 8 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"Was literally unable to fight back the first time   Impossible. Even if you were 1v1, they need at least 4 solid confirms. You probably got reset a few times and didn't notice it. That would be the first step toward improving. Notice when and what is resetting you, and try to figure out how to fight against it.  Also, don't worry if this takes you a while. Even among similar skill, it can be hard to adapt to certain players' playstyles."
Skullgirls,3ck46l,Kuroonehalf,6,Wed Jul 8 16:17:33 2015 UTC,"This is what Quick Match will be like as you learn the game. The most important thing is not to panic. Stay calm and try to assess what's happening.  Pushblocking is really, really important if you're stuck in blockstun. PBGCing is a very strong tool, but it takes a lot of practice. If you're using a team, alpha counters are an option. It's also important to know what your reversal options are depending on which character(s) you're using."
Skullgirls,3ck46l,Prime1153,2,Wed Jul 8 15:20:32 2015 UTC,"My issue is that the opponent was doing everything so quickly, I had basically no time to register what was even going on. It wasn't an infinite combo since I know you can break out of those, but switching around to different combos, tagging in Parasoul time to time, and leaving me not even half a second to readjust myself."
Skullgirls,3ck46l,digitalskyfire,7,Wed Jul 8 15:39:11 2015 UTC,"This is just how it is in the beginning. It's not much different than first stepping into a local boxing ring or basketball court; you're gonna get laid out for a while, but if you stick with it, things will start to make more sense, and not everything will seem so fast and out of control.  You need to find somebody at your level (there should be no shortage of those right now, with the SG2E release) and do long sets with them. You'll both be able to progress without being beaten down so harshly.  Also: watch the video that /u/FluffyHuffy posted. It's very important."
Skullgirls,3ck46l,Kuroonehalf,2,Wed Jul 8 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fighting games have this sort of visual language that you have to get used to. You learn what things to disregard and what to focus on, and become more efficient at reading what is going on. It happens with most sports. It's all a matter of time. You'll get better at it as you play. :p"
Skullgirls,3ck46l,Tibbersz,2,Wed Jul 8 16:37:49 2015 UTC,"Adjusting and getting used to blockstring and pressure is just part of the game. Like Kai said, its better to ease your way into it by playing people around your skill level.   I recommend taking a look at the ""Get Good"" event that is held every Sunday by /u/Prime1153 and /u/Tommer. Should have people around your skill level and the commentate your matches, giving advice in what area's you need to improve on. If you have the time, I would definitely enter.   http://www.steamcommunity.com/groups/skullgirlsgetgood"

Skullgirls,3ck46l,Gakuno,3,Thu Jul 9 06:35:48 2015 UTC,"infinite comboes are not possible in skullgirls, the opponent's combo has to reset in order for it not to trigger ips(infinite protection system), areset is when the aggressor allows the combo to drop(by letting you recover to neutral, at which point you can act) and then attempting to start a new combo by mixing you up with high/low hits, crossing over you and hitting you from the opposite side to where they were in relation to you earlier or by attempting to grab you.   one of the easiest ways to prevent the most easily avoided mixups (american resets a.k.a. accidental resets and frame traps) is to hold the direction that is away from your opponent on the stick/controller/keyboard. That way, as soon as the combo drops, you are blocking then you can either wait for an unsafe (slow) move from the aggressor and punish when they are in the recovering animation or pushblock(press two punches at the same time just after a move connects with you while you were blocking) and reversal with a pushblock guard cancel (if you pushblock, you recover to neutral immediately after that animation and it's shorter than most blockstun so it's faster than waiting to recover) into some move that has invincible startup or armor or a disjointed hitbox.  the mixups and crossups are stopped in a similar way, while you are holding away, pay attention to where your opponent is during the combo and just as the combo drops (in the air in front of, in the air over you , on the ground) and to pay attention to the move he tries to hit with and blocking appropriately, standing if your opponent is in th air or starts an overhead attack, crouching if he's on the ground, and hold the switch to holding the other direction if he moves to the other side of you.  as for throws, in addition do doing what i outlined earlier, watch for grab animation ad if it happens tech the grab(input grab just as the grab connects with you, no damage will happen and both players are thrown back a bit)."
Skullgirls,3ck46l,MrPangolin,2,Wed Jul 8 18:22:59 2015 UTC,"Learn their unsafe moves and defend, is all the advice I can really give. What goes overhead, what goes low, what's safe and unsafe, what moves you can use to fight back with on your character, all of that jazz. Practice pushblocking as well, get the timing down on pushblock reversals."
Skullgirls,3ck46l,arly803,2,Wed Jul 8 15:17:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips everyone. Obviously I know I wasn't ""literally unable to fight back,"" but for someone who figured he was pretty OK at the game, that experience really soured my confidence.  So now I know to stay the hell away from Quick Match..."
Skullgirls,3ck46l,arly803,3,Wed Jul 8 21:40:23 2015 UTC,"Or... play a lot more quick matches so that you can learn to face the crazy pressure.  If you have someone your level you can play against, that's fun and fine, but if you want to improve you should challenge yourself!"
Skullgirls,3ck46l,SpiceMastah,2,Wed Jul 8 21:49:37 2015 UTC,"There's challenging, and then there's not even being able to fight back.   I'm not competitive enough to handle those guys, nor do I plan to become that, as I have other games I also want to devote time to. I'd like to enjoy myself."

Skullgirls,3cij3t,Redditisquiteamazing,7,Wed Jul 8 04:28:36 2015 UTC,"have you ever played fukua? seems like you've never played fukua.  they share no specials, and while a decent number(but not all as things like her s.lp and j.hk and other i don't remember because i basicly never play fukua/filia) of the normals are similar, most of the similar looking ones have different properties.  as for their playstyles, they're polar opposites, filia's playstyle is that of the rushdown character, get in on an opponent quickly and applying constant pressure whereas fukua is a zoner playstayle, staying mid to fullscreen away and pelting you with shadows and firballs so that you have to approach her instead of her coming to you and then taking advantage of your aggresion to get reversals on you with armored/invunerable hits/grabs and such."
Skullgirls,3cij3t,arly803,2,Wed Jul 8 13:19:50 2015 UTC,"I know that the fighting styles and a bunch of the moves are different, but my point still stands that Fukua was literally made to be an April fools joke and parody of fighting games whose new character is just a shameless recolir."

Skullgirls,3cjjl0,Kuroonehalf,2,Wed Jul 8 13:57:46 2015 UTC,"If you don't have basic fighting game vocabulary, or experience with complex controls, it can be a bit weird. But yeah, just give it time, and it'll all slide into place.  I always recommend this to new fighting game players, but check out UltrachenTV's series of First Attack videos. They're basically super indepth tutorials about fighting game stuff. Although they exemplify most of it with street fighter, the majority of concepts carry over to SG and other games exactly the same."
Skullgirls,3cjjl0,Kiyobi,2,Wed Jul 8 16:01:30 2015 UTC,I can do all of the basics without any problems it's just doing stuff like cancelling moves to extend combos or air combos which give me a lot of trouble
Skullgirls,3cjjl0,Nodscouter,5,Wed Jul 8 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"Cancelling in SG is pretty simple as long as you understand the basics.  The basic order of priority is normals < specials < supers, so: - Any normal can be cancelled into any special - Any normal can be cancelled into any super - Any special can be cancelled into any super  No exceptions There are very rare exceptions. However, not all of them combo properly, that part is situational.  But there's more. Even among normals, there's certain priorities: - Most punches cancel into kicks - Most lights cancel into mediums - Most lights cancel into heavies - Most mediums cancel into heavies  So with a lot of characters, just doing LP LK MP MK HP in quick succession is a valid combo in which the moves cancel each other.  Doing air combos is a bit more tricky and highly situational because it depends entirely on the character's weight, movement options, and moves."
Skullgirls,3cjjl0,Kuroonehalf,2,Wed Jul 8 17:10:59 2015 UTC,Wow that's extremely helpful! Thanks. :)
Skullgirls,3cjjl0,Saigancat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:46 2015 UTC,"Different characters have different cancelling rules with their normals. Like Squigly for example, she can't cancel a punch into a kick*. You'll want to try out any character you're interested in inside the training room and see if your character can go from punches to kicks.  *You can Stancel to go from punch to kick, but that's a fairly advanced Squigly technique."

Skullgirls,3cmbug,SneakNSnore,2,Thu Jul 9 05:23:38 2015 UTC,"The story modes can be easily completed by beginner players (they actually brought the difficulty down in 2nd encore), what they do is teach you the basics for being able to just play the game.

Skullgirls,3cmbug,bloodipeich,2,Thu Jul 9 01:06:29 2015 UTC,Get away and spam lasers. You're gonna run into trouble on Eliza too. It seems like the DLC characters A.I. is more aggressive than normal.  Also you're gonna want to definitely spam lasers on Marie. It was almost TOO easy.
Skullgirls,3cmbug,SnipingBeaver,2,Thu Jul 9 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"I had the same issue.  Lost the first 4 fights or so against him.  I'm bad, and I'm ok with that.  I adjusted and geared towards a more aggressive approach.  I pushed into him with the c.mk a lot.  I followed up with the down to back mk to spin fists on him immediately afterward.  The AI had trouble dealing with it so I just kept doing it.  The key is to push into him trying different combos.  It gets much easier after him."

Skullgirls,3cgml9,Fixer_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:42:01 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  I'm still new to fighting games.  The first one I was really able to get onto was Injustice.  I heard about skull girls but never played it.  Saw 2nd encore for 20  bucks and decided to get it on ps4. I'm still trying to figure out how to do the blockbuster moves.  I'll definitely be checking back from time to time! :)"
Skullgirls,3cgml9,VoidHaunter,2,Tue Jul 7 20:15:30 2015 UTC,"Blockbusters are generally a quarter circle and two buttons (i.e. Two punches or two kicks). Command grab supers use light punch and light kick with either a quarter circle motion or a 360 motion (a complete circle with the stick).  The game is extremely forgiving on imputs so you don't have to be perfect, but practice on cleaning up your imputs so you don't accidentally do something you didn't mean to.   I hope this helps."
Skullgirls,3cgml9,Immortails,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:52:05 2015 UTC,I second the statement on input forgiveness. Playing SG then going back to SFIV it's a huge difference when pulling off quarter circles.
Skullgirls,3cgml9,bumpacar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:29:28 2015 UTC,When is it a good idea to start playing Multiplayer?
Skullgirls,3cgml9,Dkharvison,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:47:23 2015 UTC,I just got the game and a stick for PS4. I've beat the tutorial and I've got one characters combos down almost to memory (I can pull off 3 out of 4). Of course in game is a different story. I've got to get better at defending against the other characters I end up fighting against. I frequently go up against robo-fortune and she looks like a lot of fun so I'll probably learn her as my next character. I'm definitely going to take you up on the one on one training session some time soon. I'll PM. Can't wait to come back and beat this guy online I couldn't beat. I figure after a couple days of more practice on my defense and my combos and I'll be able to beat him. If you are the type of person who learns from failure and losing then this is the game for you. I can see myself getting better after every defeat it's so much fun.
Skullgirls,3cion9,BigE1943,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:26:14 2015 UTC,Any reason you can't manually hit the 2 buttons yourself?
Skullgirls,3cion9,Brisk83,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:26:21 2015 UTC,"Good point, lmao. I'm just so used to using stick motions to dash instead of punch buttons. If I can't find a better solution, I will, in fact, just do this. Somehow this slipped my mind..."
Skullgirls,3cion9,Gakuno,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hitting the two buttons manually sometimes registers when the macro doesn't. I use a keyboard so double tapping to dash is actually faster for me, it's great."
Skullgirls,3cion9,AOWYomabuddy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:17:29 2015 UTC,What part of the combo are you dropping? Maybe you're getting it because you're doing a certain part too fast.
Skullgirls,3cion9,Immortails,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:30:19 2015 UTC,"Just go over it in training mode so it's ingrained into muscle memory.  That's how I've learned my Valentine combos, but I can't help you here apart from that."
Skullgirls,3cion9,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:32:11 2015 UTC,"What combo is this? I use the double tap when dashing in Val combos and I find the timing very forgiving(each to their own though). The dash macro you set effects which normal comes out the fastest(with punches, kicks aren't affected). For example: I use LP + MP so that my HP comes out the fastest. The downside is the MP takes longer to come out than if I were to use a double tap. But, if you're finding this issue outside of combos I think you're just pressing the button too much. There's a cool down period between a dash but if you press the dash button too fast it'll see it as you pressing both buttons(and the LP comes out)"
Skullgirls,3cion9,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"The combo is from Skullheart, and it goes:  c.LK, c.MK, c.HP,  j.HP, Dash, j.MP(3x), j.HK,  j. LP, j.MP(3x), j.HK  LP , MP, HP, HK Bypass  I'm really not used to dash-cancels, and this combo seems like you have to move very fast to get all the jumping hits in.  As for just regular dashing, yeah, on characters without a run I spam dashes to move quicker. It's probable that if I use a macro, it'll be faster than the dash cooldown."
Skullgirls,3cion9,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your j.MP might not come out as fast because of the macro you use. If you don't feel like double tapping, I recommend changing it to a different set of punches. You have to dash immediately after the j.HP hits(i just do this with double taps).   Also, are you sure you're not supposed to put a j.MK after that last air j.HK? Even not, try it(it won't add undizzy or trigger IPS, does more damage and might make the last string easier to hit). Also, your last chain can be improved by doing cr.MK after st. MP and then into st.HK or HP. You can even do st.LK after st.LP but this may drop on lighter characters. you should check out the Val combo in this thread for more damage(this will work on all fighters). This combo does around 6K and the other does 7.5K"
Skullgirls,3cion9,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:05:44 2015 UTC,"I've no idea, man. All I've gotten down out of this thing is the first 4 hits. Looking at these, just the thought of the amount of button presses I'll have to remember is making me cringe. I love Val's mobility and moveset, but damn if this airdash nonsense isn't scaring me; air hits are something I find hard to stay consistent with, especially with my coughBROKE DICK PIECE OF SHIT cough, um, absymal computer, and they look to be Val's focus.   (warning: pointless venting ahead)  After 90 hours the only BnB I really know is a basic Parasoul one, and that one is one that I constantly drop online because of my shitty PC's horrid framerate nonsense in matches. (It's a simple crouch -> air-> standing combo but I consistently drop it after 2-3 hits)  /vent  Maybe I should try to find a different character, and then come back to Val..."
Skullgirls,3cion9,brocoder,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:17:16 2015 UTC,"You can stick to that combo if you find it easier. It might be an issue of controls all together that you aren't comfortable with. Can you do inputs regularly and on purpose?   There are ways to improve your frame rate as well. Skullgirls is built so it can run on the worst computers.   If you feel overwhelmed, break it up into chains to make it easier. Instead of thinking of the combo as 15 moves or whatever, think of them as three or four parts. Ex: you do the launcher which is three moves. Practice these moves until you can get it down every time and then move on to the next string which would be j.HP > airdash > j.MP. When you do that, the combo is much more manageable and not hard to memorize."
Skullgirls,3cion9,brocoder,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:33:34 2015 UTC,"I can do pretty well with individual chains, yeah, but air chains are one of my (many) weaknesses. The longer I have to spend in the air, the less comfortable I am with my ability to pull off the combo, especially since you really can't break down an air chain into smaller chunks to link together later. Timing is way more important in the air, and the more light hits, the smaller the window to try and input it fast enough. Maybe I psych myself out over it, I dunno.  Yeah, I need to hit the settings to see if I can fix my framerate issues. Oddly enough, offline, it usually stays above 50, but online, it takes a hit, rarely rising above the 40 mark."

Colorblindness just makes it a little harder to see differences in color tones. Looks like I did get it right though ^  Hopefully I'll see a cure sometime in my lifetime, it looks like gene therapy is making some progress."

Skullgirls,3cb1q5,BigE1943,4,Tue Jul 7 05:12:27 2015 UTC,"Quick question;  We know Eliza's powers are blood-fueled, and she can smell strange blood. Would it be possible for her to, say, absorb Painwheel's blood (or anyone who's been infused with Skullgirl blood)? Maybe even Marie's blood itself?  ...maybe this is a question for Alex?"
Skullgirls,3cb1q5,RadagastTheBrownie,4,Wed Jul 8 00:10:50 2015 UTC,"Painwheel vs Eliza:   You wanted blood. You got it!   I'll give you a taste, alright!   So, Eliza can drink blood of all manner of types and flavors.  Whether this blood is any more practical or delicious than other varieties is doubtful."
Skullgirls,3cb1q5,BigE1943,3,Wed Jul 8 00:36:01 2015 UTC,"I dunno. We know Skullgirl blood does a lot to help Painwheel's body survive the use of the Gae Bolga Matrix, perhaps it could be of greater use to Eliza somehow."
Skullgirls,3cb1q5,RadagastTheBrownie,3,Wed Jul 8 06:20:17 2015 UTC,"Eh... I just replayed Eliza's story mode, and Marie's bone dry, so it's not really clear where ""Skullgirl Blood"" comes from.  Eliza would appreciate the flavor, but it's doubtful the blood would give her angry superpowers.  Painwheel has special science stuff injected into her to utilize it.  Eliza consumes blood and has full control over her own produced blood-like substance.    At least the impression I got was that it's more of an ""appreciation of fine wines and cheeses"" kind of thing than ""Mario-style power ups."""
Skullgirls,3cb1q5,Marya_Clare,2,Wed Jul 8 06:43:10 2015 UTC,"Eliza is a pretty crafty character. She doesn't seem to just absorb some defeated foes blood right after the fight. She'll only do it if it serves to benefit her later (Cerebella).   Plus with Painwheel she would probably store her somewhere in the catacombs as she seems to do that with enemies who have strange blood types. But she might actually just drain Painwheel anyway because I can't really picture her having a reason to keep Painwheel alive (Painwheels parasites are artificial) also Eliza pretty much defeated the skullheart and absorbed double (at least appeared to). Draining Painwheel would probably be no different from any other enemy and keep in mind she never actually makes any attempts to drain Maries blood possibly because Marie no longer bleeds as shes slowly transforming into the Skullgirl (the wiki says at the time of the game Marie isn't actually fully transformed).   And then the part where they get into the whole ""Queen Lamia"" thing with the Skullheart really kinda messed with the continuity. Because it just adds more unanswered questions and makes Double's ending probably more confusing (Was the trinity formed from the spirits of dead people?)   And than we still have the classic ""Why would the trinity want to destroy the world?"" And ""Why did the trinity resurrect Marie in the end?"". Did Marie somehow successfully  bargain with them?"
Skullgirls,3cb1q5,BigE1943,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:53:10 2015 UTC,It's like science! In our quest for answers we discover... More questions!
Skullgirls,3cb1q5,Redditisquiteamazing,3,Sat Jul 11 01:31:10 2015 UTC,"This probably shouldn't bother me as bad as it does, but I feel like it's a massive plot hole. How does Cerebella not know Filia? The Wikia says that Cerebella is like 18-20 and Filia is like 16, and considering that Cerebella has been under Vitale's wing since she was like a baby and Filia is allegedly the granddaughter of Lorenzo Medici, they had to have crossed paths several times pre-skullgirls. How could Cerebella beat the living shit out of Filia and not think at any point ""wow, this girl has a striking resemblance to Vitale's niece!"" It just seems like a glaring issue to me."
Skullgirls,3cb1q5,BigE1943,4,Wed Jul 8 18:10:35 2015 UTC,"Well, it's possible they've crossed paths a couple times, but have you ever seen someone, like, three times in your life, and not recognized them? It's possible Filia didn't really spend much time around the ""family business,"" and thus, Bella didn't really see her but maybe one or two times. That doesn't explain why she wouldn't recognize her from all of the ""MISSING"" posters the mafia no doubt had made, though. (kinda hard to ""protect"" businesses if you can't protect your family, no?) Granted, the girl's eyes (probably) and hair both changed color (and style, WRT hair), making her harder to recognize to your run-of-the-mill Medici footman like Riccardo. However, people who have seen her before should recognize her...  If you think about it, though, the random, plotless (i.e. no storyboard before/after) battles in the original 8 characters' storylines don't really make sense. Why's a 16-year-old amnesiac girl fighting the princess regnant of the entire kingdom?"
Skullgirls,3cb1q5,Redditisquiteamazing,3,Thu Jul 9 00:55:16 2015 UTC,"I noticed that in some of the flashback art, filia has a different hair color, blonde or white, I think it was, which could maybe explain why Cerebella doesn't recognize her, but I mean, a face is a face. Unless Samson broke her nose and jawline before she lost her memory, it should take Cerebella 5 minutes tops to figure out that that is  Filia Medici, and not just some run of the mill schoolgirl with demon-like hair.  Also, considering how both are associated with the highest parts of the Medici family, it seems way more likely that Cerebella has ran into Filia a lot."
Skullgirls,3cb1q5,BigE1943,5,Thu Jul 9 01:11:10 2015 UTC,"It's possible Filia is/was being kept in the dark about the actual mafia, or her parents don't actively participate in running it; that's just speculation, though. Cerebella also seems to be a kind of mafia contact, but not necessarily always on a mafia job. Bella may have been raised by governesses, for all we know.  Still, even at best, it doesn't make a terrible amount of sense."

Skullgirls,3cb1q5,Marya_Clare,2,Thu Jul 9 05:23:49 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind about the whole storylines is that pretty much everybody has an alternative agenda other than ""kill Marie"" or ""Claim Skullheart"". Cerebella is madly in love with Vitale and Vitale sent her on a mission to claim the life gem from Ms Fortune. It all ends with her crushing Ms Fortune back into the life gem and handing it back to Vitale, the shot ends with her feeling guilt for what she did.   But that just proves Cerebella will pretty much do whatever it takes to please Vitale, even if she feels completely against it. Also watch Elizas backstory she's fights back when she finds out Eliza is going to keep Ms Fortune for herself but than winds up dying trying to fufill Vitales mission.  If Vitale gave her a mission to decapitate Filia or something she would do it in a heartbeat. And than after meeting with Vitale, going to her apartment to eat a carton of ice cream and sob over the awful deed she did (ok, probably not but I can still picture that).  One more thing, one of Cerebellas dislikes is cockroaches. Which character performs the blockbuster move ""Gregor Samson?"""
Skullgirls,3cb1q5,BallotBoxer,3,Fri Jul 10 20:28:05 2015 UTC,"Simple. You don't invite goons to the family picnic. Circus star by day, mafia legbreaker by night, Cerebella wouldn't be introduced to family members kept in the dark of the criminal business. Vitale is interested, but maybe Filia's father, Vitale's brother, has no interest in the criminal empire. Perhaps ""Vitale's niece"" is just a vague, faceless item of info to Cerebella. Mutual ignorance.  Also, Cerebella may not have been around long enough to encounter Filia. Cerebella is called an orphan in her bio, but it doesn't specify when she was orphaned and given a slug like Vitale as a father figure. Perhaps as a baby. Or maybe when she was Filia's age (two years ago)."

I just tried it out, and it works. Mostly, anyway. It thought that square was LK, though that sometimes happens anyway. I did a quick rebinding, and everything was hunky-dory. I did have a bit of trouble pulling off specials, but that might just be because I haven't used it in a while."

Skullgirls,3c7ze9,MacdougalLi,17,Sun Jul 5 19:22:39 2015 UTC,"'cause evo is pretty lame about that kinda thing. Reality, though, is that the numbers aren't high enough to warrant it chosen as an official game.  Numbers are good enough to get main stage elsewhere, though, which is why we like going to tournaments like Combo Breaker and some East Coast stuff."
Skullgirls,3c7ze9,digitalskyfire,6,Sun Jul 5 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's due to a small scene, no real big publisher for the big pot bonus (three out of seven games don't have one, expect to see more bonuses in the future IMO), no big established online viewership community. Madcatz will probably stream top 8 like last year so that's nice. Maybe L0 has some pot bonus cash idk but still we don't get noticed by senpai."
Skullgirls,3c7ze9,Hakumen,10,Sun Jul 5 22:24:10 2015 UTC,its too hype for evo
Skullgirls,3c7ze9,MomiziWolfie,12,Sun Jul 5 22:13:38 2015 UTC,"EVO is nothing but a commercial event, as of lately. The Evo formula: # of players, # of viewers on stream, commercial bonus (ie Warner Bros, Capcom, other big companies pushing their game for evo).   Even if the player turnout is great, it doesn't meet Evo standards in viewership and commercial. We are better off not caring for EVO and instead care for other majors that care for SG like Combo Breaker.  Also this is Skullgirls. Most of the fandom care more about the art/story/lore than the gameplay. Even though lately we have been having a player increase, a lot of skullfans aren't interested in learning fighters or watch fighting game tournaments. And thus plenty of SG players are trying their best to convince skullfans/casuals to support the tournament scene."
Skullgirls,3c7ze9,GhettoThrasher,5,Sun Jul 5 23:27:09 2015 UTC,"Skullgirls was at EVO for 2 years though, I wanna say it was 2012 and 2013? might have been '13 and '14.

Skullgirls,3c7ze9,Averious,6,Mon Jul 6 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"Overall? Cause entrance numbers were quite low across tournaments. Combo Breaker numbers were impressive but this needs to happen in more than just one tournament.  The strategy the community is using now, of supporting events that actually included Skullgirls on their official lineup, instead of begging to be officially included in events that don't care until numbers are high enough, is quito good IMO.  Also, being Evolution largest side tournament three years in a roll could help too, but actually showing up to other events is more important."

Skullgirls,3c7ze9,arly803,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"As it stands, the Skullgirls community isn't making noise. It's blowing smoke.   If you want more of a presence, stop asking for event space and publicity and make those things happen yourself. Is it work? Yes. But if you want the payoff, it's worth it.  Prime example is Killer Instinct. Through constant community work to run frequent online tournaments, properly publicizing and hyping those tournaments, despite being a (currently) one-platform game, it's managed to get not only the full backing of the community, but of the developer and publisher too.   That doesn't happen by 'asking'. It's because the community wholly pushed for it. The problem with the Skullgirls community in this regard is that it's a rather insular thing, while not happy to be in the background, still makes no attempts to push from it."
Skullgirls,3c7ze9,CaptainNeuro,0,Tue Jul 7 06:37:26 2015 UTC,"because we need ki to be there!!!!!! ki is great!!!!!!  basically just popularity/company pot bonuses, noting else which ironically is why killer instinct is there omg fuck that game its so bad"
Skullgirls,3c7ze9,wedl-dah-dee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"KI's probably got the best mechanics and design of any fighter released since and including vanilla SF4. It also has all three of its community's, developer's AND publisher's hardcore support and constant pushing, which doesn't at all hurt.   Skullgirls, while a great game, has the issue of while having a dedicated fanbase, also having a LOT of people who shout loudly that 'something should be done to improve this game's visibility!' instead of just going out and doing it. Until that changes, the game won't see more majors or build up more of a community."
Skullgirls,3c7ze9,CaptainNeuro,0,Tue Jul 7 06:32:54 2015 UTC,"Killer Instinct got into EVO just because of MS pot bonuses, when no one played the game. MK9 was dead yet still got 3 years because of nrs money."

This will allow you to use your stick on a ton of consoles, but you'll have to open it up, rewire the inputs to the new PCB, install an RJ45 connector, and make/buy custom cables for each console.

Skullgirls,3c9qt6,acfan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:32:34 2015 UTC,"I purchased a Mayflash for 15$ and used this. Modding the stick is relatively easy and doesn't require any soldering (unless you're tapping into the top four buttons). The kit comes with ten buttons, the stick and a microcontroller. If you can find a Mayflash used you can get yourself a decent stick for under sixty dollars. If you're adverse to modding, or can't find it cheap the Qanba Q1 is probably your next best bet. These things don't come cheap it seems.   There's tons of guides online for modding it as well, if necessary."

Skullgirls,3c96nm,brocoder,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:27:18 2015 UTC,If the bar fills up essentially you cannot continue your combo.  If it fills up during the middle of a chain you can finish that specific chain however.
Skullgirls,3c96nm,brocoder,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:27:59 2015 UTC,"Your combo is probably from before the Undizzy update. Undizzy is the green bar below health, and triggers at the start of a chain if the combo is getting too long.

They were not ""scammed"", Konami kind of just screwed them over at a certain point, which meant they were unable to do much with the 360/PS3 versions for a while. The PC version has been thriving since it was released, has been the go-to version (with a bigger community than the PS3 and 360 versions combined), and has had constant updates.   With that said, there won't be any more content. Not because they got scammed or any dumb shit like that, but because this is all of the content that Lab Zero promised we'd get. Once Robo-Fortune's update is released for the PC non-beta version, 360, and PS3, they're going to do Second Encore, which is non-gameplay changes (extra challenge modes, voice acting for the story, etc) and that's it. Then they're moving on to another project, which you can follow at /r/indivisible.  tl;dr: Game is not dead, I get quick-matches with people online every night.

Skullgirls,3c63iz,kylethewarlock,18,Sun Jul 5 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"Keep on blocking. If your opponent drops their combo, you don't want to get caught in an American (accidental) reset.  Do not mash super. It might work, but it's a bad habit to get into and skilled opponents will destroy you for trying.  As you play more, you'll start to learn when to anticipate resets. Keep your eyes open for throws, high/low mix-ups, and crossups/crossunders. If you have a feeling you know what's coming, you can block/tech accordingly.  If you need to get your opponent off of you, reversals and supers are an option, but don't rely on them."

Skullgirls,3c63iz,Always_Helpful,-5,Sun Jul 5 13:28:34 2015 UTC,"Another thing to try is if you're playing with more than one character, try to mash out a switch. As long as the character's switch attack has the possibility to hit your opponent it should work pretty well. When you get better at this you should try to predict their hits to avoid getting the character you're swapping out for hit on their way in.  The best characters I've noticed for this are Cerebella, Double, Parasoul, and Big Band. I haven't played in a while so I might be forgetting one...or I might be giving bad advice because I'm not super mega pro at this game. Use with apprehension."

Skullgirls,3c63iz,FluffyHuffy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:12:35 2015 UTC,Just do a slightly slower reset to bait it. You can block the super post flash if they nave undizzy.
Skullgirls,3c63iz,brett6452,2,Mon Jul 6 12:33:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the help. I already know that stuff, its just that online people mash super and any dip in connection means I can drop a combo or reset unexpected and they just get a free 1 meter punish.  Skullgirls has the best FG netcode in my experience, but its still not perfect and that allows people to just mash super instead of play defense. It is just frustrating is all."
Skullgirls,3c63iz,arly803,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:59:13 2015 UTC,"the thing is, mashing super has never been and never will be more effective than actually playing defense.   it's just a foo strategy in noob vs noob environment, which a good number of player will tend to try to stick to, rather than lose a lot of games to better players and consequently learn new things and grow as players.   Which is why i shared the ""you must lose to win"" video released by maximillian dood about two weeks ago, as it's info that a sizable number of new fighting game players don't get right away."
Skullgirls,3c63iz,kkwalker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:35:27 2015 UTC,mashing supers totally works offline. it just doesn't work after the 3rd time.
Skullgirls,3c63iz,LOTO-12,3,Fri Jul 10 16:05:38 2015 UTC,"Something that hasn't been mentioned yet is anticipating throw resets. Take a bit of time and learn what characters reset where and with what throw. For example, I see a lot of Big Band players use his air grab when they want to reset.  Personally, I find binding one of the two macros to the throw input lets me mash it when I'm anticipating a throw so I can tech out of it."
Skullgirls,3c63iz,CrankMachine,2,Sun Jul 5 07:26:37 2015 UTC,"Keep holding back, switch between low block and high block as needed to be prepared for when the reset it coming. A combo has to end, whether in a reset, burst, etc.   Keep a careful eye to only burst if you think the opponent cannot safely punish you for bursting (e.g. they are not blocking, or they are not too far away).  If they continue to apply pressure, (for example, if they failed a reset), then you can try reacting if you know what moves are safe, or push-block, to help relieve pressure, and react from there. Look into techniques like PBGC and Absolute Guard, which are very powerful benefits from push-blocking successfully. More information is here: http://wiki.shoryuken.com/Skullgirls/Strategy_Tactics  BE VERY CAREFUL, at high levels of play, players will try to read your push-lock, and stop attacking. This way they can bait out a back-dash, and punish you while you are vulnerable. This strategy is medium-risk medium-reward.  So I see a lot of do not use a super to escape pressure, do not raw tag, etc. A more accurate way to say this is these are high-risk high-reward maneuvers. It is okay to do this sometimes, but it is very important to be aware of the ups and downs of all the different things you can do while blocking."
Skullgirls,3c63iz,nordiquefb,2,Sun Jul 5 08:41:38 2015 UTC,"A hit leads to a combo. A combo in Skullgirls (and other fighting games) is an advantageous situation for the aggressor and a guessing game for the defender. In Skullgirls, if you get hit, it's a situation that is obviously in the other player's favor, but you are not helpless.  A combo from a good player is going to end one of a few ways:  -Spending the meter to kill your character when the proper amount of resources are available  -A reset  -A burst bait -A hard knockdown or oki situation -Reversal bait  Skullgirls is reset heavy. You're not going to die from getting hit once pretty much ever. If your opponent hits you, they are looking to do one of the other things if they CAN'T kill you. When you get hit, you should be looking to block/tech (or reversal) a reset or paying attention to whether  your opponent is trying to burst bait you. You should also be wary if your opponent is trying to bait a reversal. Many setups are ""anti-mash"" setups, which are similar to safe jumps in that they try to bait the opponent into something unsafe.  Make sure you're blocking during points in a combo you've noticed your opponent drops all the time. Cerebella is a classic example of this. Many players get by j.HP in the second restand of her bnb because the opponent just drops the combo and the player isn't blocking high. Don't get American reset!"
Skullgirls,3c63iz,Jwiggity,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:56:31 2015 UTC,"You look at what character they're playing and you tell what options they have available and even if you get opened up its ok really, then you've seen their combo at least once, it then becomes apparent where they'll try for a reset or going for the extra damage ender, the tricky part is when it gets hard when they have the right set up, and how they adjust to your adjusting."
Skullgirls,3c63iz,arly803,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"hold back.   hold back all through you getting comboed and if the combo drops or they try to reset with a mixup, you'll allready be blocking.  when it comes to throw resets it's more of paying attention and having good reaction time, if you see the little shine from exiting hitsun and returning to blocking state (rather than to neutral because you were holding back during the combo) expect a reset to be attempted.  If you're in the air it will almost always be a throw reset (unless it was an accidentally dropped combo) and if you are on the ground it could either be a high low mixup, or a grab reset, so make a pay attention and react accordingly.  Don't mash.  a burst bait is when an opponent will trigger the ips (infinite protection system, which keeps combos from being infinite) or undizzy (the green bar under your health which fills up as you get hit in a combo, which keeps combos from being too long) in a way that makes the not get hit by the burst if it's done immideatly.  if you mash, you will fall for burst baits, and you won't be blocking if the combo drops, so all in all, it's just a bad idea."

For hitgrabs, you just need to block, which in case you haven't been dropped this fundamental piece of advice, is what you should do ~85% of the time. if you aren't currently pressing buttons to attack, you should probably be holding back. Even when you're trying to move forwards, there's ways to block as you approach, like jumping forwards and then holding back (be careful with this though, Bigband and cerebella can grab you out of the air from the ground, but bigband's can be blocked if you are no longer ascending).  for characters with command grabs, most command grabs can be avoided by jumping backwards away from your opponent (again be careful, bigband/cerrebella can punish you if they predict you)."

Skullgirls,3bz45s,BigE1943,2,Sat Jul 4 03:14:26 2015 UTC,The plus side of button mashing? Your moves are really unpredictable. The negative? Essentially the fighting game equivalent of spray and pray. Except less effective.
Skullgirls,3c01ji,hellsbellltrudy,16,Fri Jul 3 15:21:40 2015 UTC,"Fighting games don't get sequels at the same pace as other games. There were four years between MK9 and MKX. SF4 has been around since 2009, and although there have been ""expansions"" like Super and Ultra, a true sequel isn't coming out until at least 2016. It takes time for the scene to explore the depth of the meta and push the game to its limits. Devs need to see how people play the game in order to determine what gameplay changes to make in a sequel. I know that there are people that are really into the Skullgirls universe, but when it comes to fighting games, gameplay takes priority over story. The story alone is not enough to justify Skullgirls 2.  With all of this in mind, it doesn't make sense for Lab Zero's next game to be a Skullgirls sequel, especially after they have spent the past three years adding more and more content to the original game. Now that the game is ""complete"" in the form of Second Encore, it's time to stop making changes and see where the community takes it. In the meantime, I'm very excited to see the talented team at Lab Zero work on other projects."

Keep all the old and DLC characters the exact same, I don't want to have to relearn them, but then maybe add some of the rejected DLC characters and a few more maps and etc. I don't want a whole new game so much is I want a much more expanded version of what the original had to offer."

The best strategies against Marie (that work on every difficulty) are probably:   Diamond Deflector with Cerebella. The damage is ridiculous for some reason, removes need to approach. Purple poison with Valentine. The damage is a percentage of max health, so it's quite strong with little risk. Stun with multiple hit moves, such as Fukua Drill or Double/Peacock jHK.

Marie doesn't really do that great against air attacks, and since she doesn't block and therefore can attack in the middle of a combo the only way to reliably keep her from striking back is to keep her stunned. It may be because o play a lot of Parasoul, but on normal difficulty it's really not that hard to beat Marie without taking a single hit by just spamming j.HK, which stuns for days and takes advantage of Marie's poor air game"

Skullgirls,3bu53i,Ontrevant,8,Thu Jul 2 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, totally right!  Although you could probably keep that 80 hit combo in your pocket to make a match drag and hope your opponent goes to sleep for a second. Catch them unaware with a random reset~"

Skullgirls,3bu53i,BigE1943,2,Thu Jul 2 05:40:21 2015 UTC,"Val always has to worry about damage scaling a lot, because some of her best normals are multi-hit."
Skullgirls,3bu53i,digitalskyfire,3,Thu Jul 2 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I actually also didn't know that air Savage Bypass now scales to 75%. It's not so bad I suppose, considering you usually won't use it early enough in the combo to really affect your damage output.  Lately I've been trying to do combos that start with single heavy-hitting attacks (Valentine's j.HP and Savage Bypasses), and using multi-hit moves (j.MP, s.MP, s.MK) only later in the combo. Best I've got so far is:  c.LK > c.MK(1) > c.HP >  j.HP > qcf.MK > airdash > j.HP > qcf.HK >  land and run to opponent > c.LK (OTG hit) > c.HP >  j.HK > airdash > j.MP (all hits) > j.HK >  land + rejump > j.LP > j.MP (all hits) > j.HK > qcf.MK > qcf.HK  It seems to have decent crossunder points with j.LK, I've managed to get burst baits by following up after an air savage bypass with j.HK instead of dashing in for another hit, and there's always the ultra-simple ""2 air savage bypasses one after another"" burst bait to catch mashers. I'm pretty sure that with some finagling and weird positional setup, air bypass > airdash > j.MK >j.HP can cross under sometimes. Not sure about that one.  Sometimes it's also worth stopping the combo after the OTG with a simple c.LK (OTG) > s.HP > Savage Bypass just to keep the opponent's meter gain to a minimum.  I feel it can be optimized further, but this is what I figured out in training so far."
Skullgirls,3bu53i,shadowdude777,2,Thu Jul 2 13:18:53 2015 UTC,"This isn't really meant to be a combo-sharing thread, but:   Why do M Bypass and then H Bypass, and not the other way around? If you're going to end your combo early, you might as well use s.HK for corner carry."
Skullgirls,3bu53i,shadowdude777,2,Thu Jul 2 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly do them in that order because it's easier to link H Bypass off a M Bypass than it is to chain H Bypass off a regular attack like j.HK. Sure, they're both easy links, but I'd rather go for the combo I'll hit 100% of the time than the one I'll hit 95% of the time if the damage outputs are not significantly different. EDIT: Also, by that point in the combo, isn't damage scaling at a minimum already anyway? And thus it wouldn't make a difference? Would it affect the opponent's meter gain, maybe? Probably a good idea, I've been toying with both s.HP and s.HK actually. I just liked that s.HP was only one hit, and lets you go into Bypass, while s.HK x3 wouldn't (because the OTG is already used up). I guess there are pros and cons to both."
Skullgirls,3bu53i,Adwins,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"Fair point. At the end of the combo it doesn't really make a difference, but in that first air chain it would."

Skullgirls,3bu53i,HaLire,2,Thu Jul 2 05:53:27 2015 UTC,"For those making combos, here are a few rules of thumb:  Don't start with moves that force scales.  Don't use multihit moves in roughly the first half of your combo.  Do use single hit, big damage moves early in your combo.  If you are forced to use an early combo scaler or a big multihit move, reset instead of finishing it for the damage."

Skullgirls,3bu53i,JohnReiki,2,Fri Jul 3 04:16:41 2015 UTC,There's a lot of stuff that factors into overall damage. Val used to be on the low side but now she does just fine. Squigly also has pretty good damage potential.  Here's some examples of pretty optimal stuff:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs5uAN5qPbg  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB4-F4kcOqA
Skullgirls,3bu53i,Immortails,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:29:15 2015 UTC,I thought it was really strange that I'd get more damage off of comboes starting with j.MK->MK divekick on Squiggly than ones starting with c.LK. I was used to stuff like Melty where if you started a combo with 2A you'd get like 60% of the normal damage because it prorated so hard and you'd hit several times to confirm it.

But by sheer coincidence Parasoul's play style happened to really fit my own like a glove. Her zoning and ability to fight like a fencer up close is a lot like the way I tend to play fighting games. I like to keep room between myself and my opponent, then come in and deliver a few damaging combos and retreat out, I guess since I'm really bad at lengthy comboing and reacting to situations up close that I'm not in control of and haven't initiated (I also suck at fighting games :/). And Parasoul delivers, baby. She's just that kinda girl :3"
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,XenophonTheAthenian,3,Thu Jul 2 00:37:25 2015 UTC,"Parasoul, because legs. Legs make the world go round. Also redhead.   Well, can't deny, that's part of her appeal. Heh.   But by sheer coincidence Parasoul's play style happened to really fit my own like a glove.   How coincidental! Same for me. Your playstyle sounds similar to mine. I hate being in high-pressure situations; dealing with rushdown characters isn't a forte of mine, but I suppose I'll learn with practice.  She actually can and will push out long, brutal combos; she's got the tools to do it, but it takes a lot more skilled player than I to make use of things like the Egret assists. The most I get up to is about 14, but it does a very healthy amount of damage."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Thu Jul 2 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"She actually can and will push out long, brutal combos   Yeah, I've seen a lot of videos of nice, long, beautiful Parasoul combos. They take after her legs like that :3 I'm still learning how to play the game, only got it a few weeks ago, so I don't really know how to do anything like that--I only recently figured out how to charge Napalm and whatnot while comboing a little while ago! Egret cancels and her resets are way beyond me so far...   I hate being in high-pressure situations; dealing with rushdown characters isn't a forte of mine, but I suppose I'll learn with practice.   I've found that Parasoul dominates if she can control the fight and keep the initiative. If you're choosing when and where to engage and forcing the opponent to fight on your terms Parasoul's golden. She's far from useless when the pressure's on her (unlike Peacock...), but the fact that she excels so much in that deliberative, thought-out sort of play really helped make me fall in love with her. Plus she has a lot of tools to keep the initiative, even if she's not putting pressure on the way most characters do to keep thr initiative. I actually like her mobility--she has lots of zoning options that actually make her mobility a plus, since she doesn't need to be air dashing and double jumping around to close in. Even if Napalm and Egrets don't actually connect, it's still something the opponent has to worry about that's not you, and one way or another it gives her the ability to jump in and punish. Speaking of which, she's got a lot of great jump-ins and stuff  She's just a classy sort of gal..."

Skullgirls,3bt6vh,BusinessCalzone,3,Thu Jul 2 15:34:17 2015 UTC,"Squiggly strongly appeals to me due to her strong control of the game with notes and centre stage. I also find leviathan to be awesome. I love the cooperation aspect of the two.  She also thematically meshes with me as a person due to her being centred around singing and music.  I don't sing but I play a few instruments and am passionate about the medium as cliché as that is.   Also, I think SG is a beautiful game but I really find the hypersexualization rather cringey. TBH the only character that can pull it off is probably Eliza. Bella and Val I can't justify in my head.  So as much as she appeals to me, the rest of the cast turns me off too.  I love Parasouls play style but she is a little too deep for me atm. Im really just getting a real grasp on squig for now."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,Indefinitions,3,Wed Jul 1 23:33:02 2015 UTC,"Squigly is my third character that I use on occasion. I agree, she has some powerful tools that can help her control the stage, but I find her difficult to master. I really just need to learn some combos; her moveset is something I have down pretty well, but I have issues keeping her safe from the more up-close-and-personal characters.  I guess you could call SG hypersexualized, but I think all of the characters that are played for fanservice have some legitimate basis in their personality (except maybe Filia, but she was supposedly a prissy mafia princess pre-Samson; the tiny uniform is a bit strange, though, unless she's grown a lot since Samson, or she liked it and the school didn't dare enforce the dress code with her). Bella is a performer, through and through, much like Eliza, and the character sheet lists flirting as one of her likes. Also, in her design sheet, it labels her as a big personality, who knows what she has and likes to show it off. Valentine's act hooks into her female ninja mystique; ""honey traps"" were a common thing for them (many were prostitutes), and IIRC Alex said something about her getting down and dirty for information. My headcanon labels her as asexual, though. I just think of her as an all-business character who will do whatever it takes to get the knowledge she needs to complete her mission.  I honestly think the ""cheesecake"" is a bit of a novelty; after a panty shot or two you stop caring. And anyway, who can pay attention to such things in such a fast paced, intense game?! :D"

Skullgirls,3bt6vh,samfivedot,2,Thu Jul 2 01:32:50 2015 UTC,"I do think it'd be neat if we had alt. outfits, like, a properly-sized uniform for Filia, but that would require the devs to redraw all the sprites for practically every animation."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,Adwins,4,Thu Jul 2 16:23:05 2015 UTC,Bella and Eliza. I just like the way they move and look. Eliza's Egyptian theme is well executed and Cerebella's adorable. Plus Horus.
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,BlackQuartz,5,Thu Jul 2 00:27:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a Squigly main. Main reason for picking her up is thanks to ZONE during the IGG, and he promoted the campaign on his YouTube. Her kit was so unique to me, and I love the synchronization of movement between her and Lev. She has a way with moves to take down foes in style, which is what made me love her even more.   Plus she's cute."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,arly803,5,Thu Jul 2 06:36:40 2015 UTC,"Squigly and Big Band. Because She gotta booty on her Gothic looking girls are a plus for me. Also, she's really polite and her stance cancel combos are fun. Big Band because I like punching stuff with a big, metal, musical man."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,Immortails,4,Thu Jul 2 13:26:40 2015 UTC,"Squigly just clicks with me on every possible level. She has everything I look for in a fighting game character (stances, divekicks, long-reaching normals, no airdash canceling) and visually I think the Tim Burton thing she has going on is very cool. She's not only my favorite Skullgirls character - I think she's one of my favorite fighting game characters, ever.  I also use Big Band because I just like how it feels to play him. He's clunky, but it's a good clunky, if that makes sense."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,ibbolia,4,Thu Jul 2 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"Gosh. It's embarrassing how much of a freak i was over Squigly...  BEFORE I even had her. Like seriously, she's the cutest damn thing in the world and i hated that i couldn't play with her on retail. My girlfriend bought her for me and the rest is history.  Eliza is my second main. I was participating in the Get Good event for the first time but with my current skill with Squigly, there was no way she could fly solo. When choosing a partner, i don't know what exactly i was thinking that made me choose eliza, but that's whom I chose.  Honestly I think Squigly helped define what kind of fighting game player I am, at least in 2D ones. I thought that I'd be rushdown because it seemed easier and would be less of a pain to learn than other types, but i've found that being patient and being REactive instead of PROactive has earned me more success since squigly rewards that style. Thanks, zombie lady"
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,Trickysticks,3,Fri Jul 3 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"Painwheel. Glad to be the first person who said that. I started playing her because I wanted to pick the character that made me feel the least creepy, which brought it down to Painwheel, Fortune, and Peacock. (didn't have dlc at the time) I already knew Peacock was a zoner, and I'm no good at that, and I tried to play Fortune but it just didn't click for me. The first thing I learned as Painwheel is Jump back, flight, press forward, j. MP, which is a sweet kind of fake out that pushes her forward and feels really cool to do. That's what really made me want to learn her and play skullgirls. That's why I STARTED playing her, but Painwheel is really sick. She is the character I use almost exclusively, her movement and attacks are all second nature to me. Once you get a feel for her you can keep the pressure on, do some crazy cool flight tricks, and do some wild combos (if you're any good at that) just from muscle memory. Her character is interesting too, and I like her design."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,omegareaper7,2,Thu Jul 2 02:19:53 2015 UTC,"i really want to learn her but i never get the chance to practice very often, so i kinda just stick to what worked for me most naturally (that being big band and peacock)."

I don't know fighter types, but Big Band's slowish plays is pretty fun, and I found him easy to learn. And Fukua has so many options.  I want to git gud at Val, but honestly I pick her and then I have no idea what I'm supposed to do."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,Nadaph,3,Thu Jul 2 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"I main Parasoul solely because one of my friends would keep linking me Poccola videos and I loved watching Parasoul's playstyle, even if I didn't have the game. When I got the game I decided to start with her because watching gave me at least SOME idea of how to go about it."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,Prime1153,3,Thu Jul 2 04:14:39 2015 UTC,"Val: Because I like her character in general, story and all, and her mobility is absolutely amazing.   Eliza: I wanted to play her as soon as I learned about the blood mechanics(which sadly didn't get added, but thats fine), played her in the beta, like her. Her story absolutely sold me though. Evil through and through, love it!"
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,ThePickleAvenger,2,Thu Jul 2 16:40:31 2015 UTC,Eliza/Bella.  I like decent mobility and heavy hits.  I don't need the longest combos in the world... I just need to pop all the right bubbles.
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,MAxichan,2,Wed Jul 1 23:31:47 2015 UTC,"Eliza's c.HK... (shivers)  She's certainly a strong character, has a pretty bulletproof moveset.  Bella's got some strong moves to be sure. She just doesn't have those ""poke"" type attacks that initially drew me to Parasoul. Titan Knuckle's a deadly attack, but it's quite telegraphed and can be countered with a light, quick attack if timed right."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,Dracowolfmon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:04:06 2015 UTC,"a pretty bulletproof moveset.   My experience against Peacock says otherwise <shudder>.  Eliza has great range, but pretty much all that range can be hurt.  Bella's power takes a little more setup.  Battle Butt, Lock n Load, Diamond Drop... these things hurt.  Then I learned about her jHK...  Parasoul's decently strong and a terror to go up against, but I have trouble with her mobility.  Same with Big Band."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,flamesrose,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:14:00 2015 UTC,"Lol, I dashspam with Parasoul. She's an interesting combination of advance/retreat; a lot of her combo-starting or linking moves require you to be up close, but a lot of her damaging moves, and her somewhat lacking mobility, make you want to have some breathing room against rushdown-focused characters. Napalm spam can keep the heat off for awhile (ha, pun), but you'll definitely need to know real combos and such once they close.  I've not encountered a Bella player online, but I've gotten quite used to stopping her slow, more telegraphed moves (Tumbling Run, Lock n' Load, Titan Knuckle, etc.)"
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,ActivityZone,2,Thu Jul 2 00:19:12 2015 UTC,"Well I was after school one day and my friends were playing Skullgirls. I asked if I could join and they said yes. I asked who they recommended and they said Filia.  To this day, I'm the only one who still plays the game and I still play Filia."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,LOTO-12,3,Thu Jul 2 00:17:04 2015 UTC,Ain't no shame in that. She's terrifying to keep off of you when the player knows their stuff!
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,Prime1153,2,Thu Jul 2 00:22:07 2015 UTC,"Good question. Hope this leads to some character discussion.  In general, I like to be fast and aggressive when I play games. When I picked up Skullgirls, I was looking for a character that fitted that playstyle, so I chose Filia as my first character. Her speed and mobility immediately clicked with me, and I grew to like her even more once I realized how scary her reset game can be.  When I started playing, I practiced a lot against my friend's solo Peacock, and I couldn't figure out how to get in with Filia. I decided to add a character to my team that could help me deal with projectiles better, which led me to Cerebella. Diamond Deflector and her armored moves made that matchup a lot easier for me.  Nowadays, I still play with Filia and Cerebella as my main team. With both characters, I can play aggressive and do lots of resets once I'm in, which is exactly how I like to play. Filia gives me mobility, and although she doesn't have high damage output, she is an insanely fast reset machine. Cerebella's playstyle isn't as fast as Filia's, but it's still aggressive and she has a lot of fun tools for resets and damage."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,AdiXeR,2,Thu Jul 2 01:09:32 2015 UTC,Double because she was the only one who wasn't complete fanservice. Or at least that's what I thought until I played her story mode. That and she just feels right in my hands
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,user4992,2,Thu Jul 2 01:26:29 2015 UTC,"When I first picked up the game I thought I mained Eliza because I liked the character and sonicfox played her, but then I picked up Ms. fortune and the combos came to me naturally and the character flowed much more smoothly with my playstyle."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,arly803,2,Thu Jul 2 01:31:18 2015 UTC,Val. I got bodied by her when I was new and started off in arcade mode. Tried her out and liked her style of being sorta quick.  ...thewholenursethinghelpstoo

Skullgirls,3bt6vh,JohnReiki,2,Thu Jul 2 16:24:23 2015 UTC,"Squigly and Miss Fortune, I chose Squigly initially because I didn't hear a lot of people using her, I stuck with her until I learned to use her to the best of my ability, I still need to work on using some of her stage control stuff, but I'm pretty good with stance cancelling and stringing long combos. Ms.Fortune was someone I picked up easily and I liked how her ability to keep pressure on the opponent helped Squigly. Also butts."
Skullgirls,3bt6vh,JohnReiki,2,Thu Jul 2 04:39:34 2015 UTC,"Originally I played as Valentine/Parasoul, because Val is a sexy nurse and Parasoul is one damn fine redhead, but Parasoul didn't play the way I wanted to play (I do rushdown almost exclusively) and Val just didn't output enough damage for me.  After I dropped Parasoul I threw Ms. Fortune in there because she was the most ""normal"" looking character after Para and Val and also because of that fantastic yellow/black palette I always use. She's also the only character in the game you can really get away with button-mashing with. After I dropped Val I needed someone to take her place so I opted for Cerebella because Waifu told me to.

And her moveset is perfect for me. So I was lucky here, I guess.  Big Band because of his design. Big, jazzy black man. Do I need to say anything else? And he was surprisingly easy to learn.  Beowulf - his playstyle. He's really fun to play. Way more fun than I expected. He's not really my type of character though, so play him more for fun. For now.  Honorable mention - Isaac. Yeah, I know he's not in the game. But if he was, I would play him for sure. I mean, time traveling as a gameplay mechanic in a fighting game? And his design is great, on top of that. All I have left is this time travel concept video, sadly."

When I first started out, I skimmed through all the tutorials(save for DLC ones) and, being my combo-inept self, I took a great liking for Parasoul's great normals, zoning capability and class.  I then tried to go online. I actually won a couple of fights, but lost a lot, too. Big Band Giant Step really got my attention there, and that's where I decided to get and learn the DLC characters.  I don't know if it's because they are a nice matchup or because both are charge characters, but I never really feel like I'm helpless when I'm fighting anymore.   But I still suck at combos."

Skullgirls,3buetr,BabyEatingFox,3,Thu Jul 2 06:23:30 2015 UTC,"never have i ever heard of this problem, what are you using as a controller?"
Skullgirls,3bucwl,BigE1943,2,Thu Jul 2 05:45:19 2015 UTC,"If your computer is trash-tier like you say, lowering the resolution a bit should work good. Nothing TOO low, but if you're on a 1366x768 screen or something similar, 1280x720 would be fine."

Skullgirls,3bucwl,FluffyHuffy,2,Thu Jul 2 11:22:59 2015 UTC,"You say that the game works perfectly fine when you play locally, and it only tanks online. I think this may be a network issue. I think /u/digitalskyfire knows a bit more about this, but the netcode handles player and spectator traffic differently. They're on different ports or something like that."
Skullgirls,3bucwl,Prime1153,2,Thu Jul 2 15:07:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I believe spectator traffic is sent via TCP while game traffic is UDP. Memory's a little fuzzy, but Mike himself explained it when I asked about why spectators couldn't see the lag that players did in the same match.  My advice is to do as /u/FluffyHuffy suggested: check the actual frame rate in-game, and make sure a frame rate drop is what's actually happening. I suspect it's actually GGPO trying to work with poor network traffic, making it look like a lower frame rate as it tries to constantly correct things.  If it's a network thing, you might need to do some research into how to get your router to prioritize the ports and protocols that Skullgirls uses in network play (which I don't know off the top of my head)."
Skullgirls,3bucwl,digitalskyfire,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:14:45 2015 UTC,"My ISP is pretty bad, but when my internet works, it works alright. I definitely wouldn't write off a networking issue, though, especially since I only get the issue in a match."

Skullgirls,3bucwl,Redditisquiteamazing,3,Thu Jul 2 16:16:10 2015 UTC,"Check if it's actually frame drops and not lag, use Fraps or a similar program.  Being online shouldn't affect framerate."

Skullgirls,3bp5dg,Channing_W,3,Wed Jul 1 00:46:58 2015 UTC,What is the ps4 exclusive content?
Skullgirls,3bp5dg,Roflbattleship,2,Wed Jul 1 13:33:43 2015 UTC,"Fully-voiced story modes, challenges/trials, and a few other things I'm forgetting."

Skullgirls,3bp5dg,FluffyHuffy,5,Wed Jul 1 14:55:37 2015 UTC,"It actually wasn't paid for by Sony. I thought the same thing, but Lab Zero confirmed that the publisher, Autumn Games, paid for everything.  The exclusivity is likely part of a deal involving marketing/promotion from Sony."
Skullgirls,3bp5dg,SSBM_Ogma,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's even more bullshit.  I fucking hate consoles and their exclusives."
Skullgirls,3bp5dg,Scorialimit,3,Wed Jul 1 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"Why is it wrong for a publisher to make a calculated business decision? Autumn believes this is the way to make a return on the investment of having all this new content made. They know that the amount they can potentially make off of a brand new PS4 version wth extra content is far more than they could with PC DLC, plain and simple.  They've been great with lots of sales promotions and keeping the gameplay the same across all versions, so I'm not mad at all."
Skullgirls,3bp5dg,Terminia,4,Wed Jul 1 17:29:17 2015 UTC,"How does preventing people from buying their product, because they don't own a specific system, make them earn more money?"
Skullgirls,3bp5dg,Cymen90,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"It's a good marketing choice. Next gen SF4 is PS4 exclusive, GGXrd is PS exclusive, SFV is PS4 and PC only. The PS4 is going to be the go-to console for tournaments meaning the player base will be gravitated towards it. Because everything else is being played on ps4 they may be able to actually sell a significant amount on the ps4, likely enough to make up for the lack of cross platform."

Skullgirls,3botrb,soph1st1c,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:17:52 2015 UTC,Added. GGs you improved a lot over those games.
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,Cavalcade_,6,Tue Jun 30 19:03:59 2015 UTC,"One universal bnb (works on every character, anywhere on the stage) per character is enough, imo. Knowing corner and counterhit variants is nice, but not necessary at this stage.  Resets are more important than combos, in this game. 1 universal bnb with 4 good resets is better than 4 good combos and only 1 basic reset.    ALSO, here's the Fukua bnb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfdWEzdGtqE"
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,digitalskyfire,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:32:36 2015 UTC,Not sure why you linked to a HCH combo that also won't work off of any assist starter...
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,brocoder,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:12:23 2015 UTC,"Posted the wrong link, is all. It's fixed, now."
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,digitalskyfire,2,Tue Jun 30 22:15:30 2015 UTC,"Generally, I think most people start with one midscreen bnb and then one corner bnb. As long as there's at least one reset point in that bnb, this should last you a pretty long time. It took me maybe 300~ ish hours of play for me to get comfortable enough to move on to more advanced things, but I also started out playing like 4 people. It'll probably be less for you if you stick to one fighter.   It's absolutely fine to start off with one person. Go at your own pace and when you feel comfortable enough to learn another person then add them. I'm not the best at squiggly but from what I've played from her, it's a little difficult to get in but once you get a single hit, you have an easy time converting that into a full combo and you have a a lot of resets available to you. She's a little meter heavy as well. I'm sure a way better squiggly player can tell you more"
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,Fluffy_Ducks,2,Tue Jun 30 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"Kinda unrelated but please, please learn some resets off of that bnb it's just as important if not more.   I see so many beginners online doing full combo into super every time they get a hit and that's not how you're supposed to play this game."
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,FluffyHuffy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"O yeah definitely. I probably should have noted this in the original post. I only ever finish into super if I know it can kill. I'm not entirely sure if this is what you mean, but i like looping this part of the combo cLK > cMP > cHP > MK Shadow > jHK > cLK > cMP > cHP until I see that their green bar is almost filled to burst me away. I watched the video in the Beginner's FAQ about resets, so I try to drop the combo on purpose, slightly, and loop again if I can."
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,FluffyHuffy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:35:39 2015 UTC,"Just making sure, and yes the c.mp c.hp M shadow is a great setup for Fukua, she can do crossunder, fake crossunder, command throw, low all that kinda stuff.  Oh and maybe check out top 8 at combo breaker if you haven't already, there's lots of great Fukua play there."
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,Prime1153,2,Tue Jun 30 19:44:44 2015 UTC,"For starters, you need to know a midscreen BnB and a corner BnB. These combos should be universal, meaning that they work on every character regardless of size or weight.  BnB combos are essential, but resets are what will get you far in this game, and they are mandatory for playing beyond a beginner level. Once you have your combos down, experiment with finding reset points."
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,BigE1943,2,Tue Jun 30 19:40:41 2015 UTC,"I have absolutely no clue about resets (uh, 50/50 <-s.HK or c.HK for Parasoul? A grab??) and only have 1 midscreen combo for 2 characters. I really need to learn resets, and then learn a corner BnB. And OTGs. I have no idea how to OTG into combo right now.  ;_;"
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,videogamefool11,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"Do you have it on steam? I'm pretty new(22 hours) and I'm also melee player, if you wanna play sometime let me know."
Skullgirls,3bnxv8,HaLire,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"In general, i think its good to learn one combo that you get off of the hit or hits you feel like you score most often while running around in neutral. After that, id prioritize learning your nastiest punish combo, so you can properly punish bug mistakes. The one after that would be the combos you score after mixups when you have the advantage."
Skullgirls,3boby6,StarrTheSquirrel,6,Tue Jun 30 20:45:07 2015 UTC,"You know I was gonna make a joke about getting a pentagon gate, but then I started to wonder if that wouldn't help with preventing accidental jumps on forward rolls."
Skullgirls,3boby6,gryffinp,2,Tue Jun 30 21:27:31 2015 UTC,/u/AshtonFaydenko posted a great explanation on the differences between gates in this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Skullgirls/comments/39sorj/best_joystick_for_custom_arcade_stick/cs68nxd
Skullgirls,3boby6,Prime1153,2,Tue Jun 30 22:02:10 2015 UTC,"I used to have a q1 myself :)  Use square. It's weird, but it's standard on every stick and having the corners rocks for blocking."
Skullgirls,3boby6,hawtsalsa1337,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:38:22 2015 UTC,"An octagon gate might be better for tighter inputs but to be honest, it probably just comes down to personal preference. My stick has a square gate and it took me a little bit to get used to, but not very long. Try using all of them and seeing which one you have the easiest time doing inputs with."
Skullgirls,3boby6,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"I have the q1 too.  I personally found octagon to work well for me for sg. I eventually tried square because i tried picking up street fighter 4 and found square gate worked better for characters i like to play (yun, decapre) for the diagonal divekicks and charge moves (decapre anti air ultra motion).  But i eventually went back to octagon gate because it felt better for sg for me."
Skullgirls,3boby6,Snackys,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:51:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you are used to. Personally I use a square gate, but my roommate uses an octagon. If you grew up in american arcades you will feel most at home with octagon. I find doing the shoryuken motion is easier on a square."
Skullgirls,3bn5vl,kuistocke,3,Tue Jun 30 15:48:24 2015 UTC,"Uh, if you're trying to zone OUT Fortune, then I find either Napalm Pillar or Hornet Bomber kicks my ass up and down the block.  If you're trying to zone AS Fortune... Uh... Good luck."
Skullgirls,3bn5vl,LOTO-12,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:10:13 2015 UTC,Maybe he meant Robo Fortune?  Edit: looking at another reply... no. No he did not. I am equally confused.
Skullgirls,3bn5vl,Saigancat,3,Fri Jul 3 13:36:00 2015 UTC,"To be totally honest, I've never heard of a zoning fortune so if you wanna play like that you'll have tons of area you can't really control(even with you head off). If you have the head on for ground control and your napalm assist for horizontal coverage you have a lot of room in the air you're not in control of(except the distance of fiber, but that's not gonna do you much if the opponent is across the screen). Because of all that I recommend any assist that controls the air. Either of big bands assists work well. Knuckles is probably better for general zoning but his DP is so huge it's great for controlling space. Peacock's flying bomb might also be a good tool. Your other DP assists don't go very far horizontally so that's the best I can think of."
Skullgirls,3bn5vl,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"I think I'll give Brass Knuckles a try, thanks!"
Skullgirls,3bn5vl,Krye07,2,Tue Jun 30 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"Zoning or fishing? Fortune doesn't have a zoning tool.   Flailing her head about is much more akin to fishing because a head hit means confirm into damage, even at full screen."
Skullgirls,3bmt8a,PrimeSwiggins,2,Tue Jun 30 14:13:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm, if you're up against a Beo who's abusing j.HP, both Medium and Heavy A-Train get armor frames. If he's being obvious about it, grabbing him should be no problem. Really all of Beo's air options farther than a half screen away are weak to it, including Blitzer.  Additionally, SSJ + Tuba will beat out Bionic Arm, but the normal SSJ gets hit out if you don't have start-up invulnerability."
Skullgirls,3bmt8a,Navy_Pheonix,2,Tue Jun 30 14:52:17 2015 UTC,"However, you have to be careful with using A-train vs. j.HP because if he is doing it without The Hurting, you will get grabbed through armor instead.  If that's the case, I would block, pushblock, and either L Beat Extend or s.LP.  It really isn't about starting a combo to get him off your neck, but either of those can combo off there (you have to do TWO c.MP to combo off the LP, but that's really hard to do)."
Skullgirls,3bmt8a,SC2Humidity,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"i have, 3 times, beaten out ssj with chairless j.hp.  That's all i have to say about that."

Skullgirls,3bpzb1,Caulidemo,8,Fri Jul 3 18:04:51 2015 UTC,Dead? The game's been exploding in popularity since the free weekend (week?). Even before that it was still growing and was even main stage at Combo Breaker. It's had more people playing on steam than MKX and Ultra.
Skullgirls,3bpzb1,Caulidemo,-6,Wed Jul 1 13:14:51 2015 UTC,Really?  More popular than MKX?  I have to scroll 10 pages of Twitch before I find Skullgirls.  MKX has 1-2k nightly views on Twitch.  Skullgirls has 1-2 hundred.  No comparison.  You obviously are not in touch with reality.
Skullgirls,3bpzb1,Ghiblier,8,Fri Jul 3 04:38:00 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why most of your arguments have to do with the game's popularity. The most important thing should be whether you're having fun or not. If you like the game, you can definitely find people at your skill level to play with. There are lots of matchmaking groups you can look at, and there are quite a few ""looking for players"" posts here.

Yes, it's been boilingly hot lately and I have been sweating like a pig.  It started-out as a prototype to test-out different button layouts (the official Hitbox layout is hand-crampingly unsuable for me), and the iteration in that pic just happened to work so well that I ended-up sticking with it.

There are a bunch of two button motions in skullgirls like dashing(2 Punches), throws(light punch + light kick), tags(Medium punch+ medium kick), assist(light punch + medium kick). So if you have a macro you can punch in two buttons so instead of pressing those two buttons, you only need to press the button associated with the macro(so I can dash with one button now). You can have macros on keyboard too!"

I'm not a Cerebella player, but a hitconfirm with her is like c.lk c.mp if blocked do runstop if hit go into launcher, you can also runstop after launcher, I guess.  I also see people doing either far or close command grab after a blockstring depending on positioning, you could also do anti-air grab if you think they're gonna jump, but it's risky and not very rewarding.  Her gameplan is basically landing a command grab going into a combo and resetting the opponent to death."

TL;DR: Mash super sometimes  You didn't really elaborate, but I'm guessing you're playing Cerebella solo, and having trouble with opponents using assists and such for pressure.  Despite her notoriety, Solobella is actually pretty hard to play. However, there's a reason she's notorious: Bella is basically a walking reversal. Devil Horns, Battle Butt, Ultimate Showstopper, Diamond Dynamo, Diamonds are Forever, all of these are good defensive options. While most of these are very punishable if they don't hit*, the implied threat of them is critical to getting your opponents to respect your space. If you recognize that your opponent keeps doing a blockstring, calling their assist to cover their unsafe move, and then starting another blockstring, then you can reversal after you block the assist and hit both characters.  *Diamond are Forever (her lvl3, a.k.a. Rocks) is actually plus on block, and generally amazing."

I'm interested in Eliza and Parasoul a bit, so perhaps I'll branch out after I get more comfortable on Bella."

Skullgirls,3bhvja,brocoder,2,Mon Jun 29 20:35:28 2015 UTC,"Hit confirms are non-existent as far as I can tell.   They're pretty important in SG. With Bella, you should be starting out with c.LK > c.MP, giving you plenty of time to hit confirm. You can even do cr.LK > cr.MP > HP > run cancel for a safe(ish) block string."
Skullgirls,3bhvja,digitalskyfire,2,Mon Jun 29 16:44:27 2015 UTC,"I would also recommend c.LK > c.MP > c.HK xx run-stop. If your c.MP gets pushblocked (which will happen pretty much all the time against experienced opponents), c.HK will still hit, whereas s.HP might whiff. Also, iirc c.HK xx run-stop is her most ""advantageous"" run-stop (+0 on block), whereas the others are varying amounts of minus."
Skullgirls,3bhvja,kkwalker,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:15:49 2015 UTC,cr.HK is indeed the safest.
Skullgirls,3bhvja,RadagastTheBrownie,2,Mon Jun 29 19:30:52 2015 UTC,"Yea that seems to be what everyone is saying. I didn't realize how long I had after cr.mp to confirm if I should go into launcher or not.   I only started playing this game because both of my sticks are broken (going to an Akihabara stick shop tomorrow to get new joysticks, though) and I didn't want to mess with my SF4 muscle memory by playing on controller. I'm really digging it though so I'll keep playing once I get them fixed. Thanks for your help!"
Skullgirls,3bhvja,RadagastTheBrownie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:01:45 2015 UTC,"Learn the flow chart combo. If you're blocked you can cancel the last hit (which is where you would be punished) into diamond drop. This makes your opponent respect the combo and not punish it all the time. Instead, they puchblock which returns you to neutral. If they jump instead to about the grab then hit you on the way down, you can cancel instead into excerabella, which is unblockable while they're jumping up"
Skullgirls,3bhvja,Kuroonehalf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:34:16 2015 UTC,"I had similar trouble with not keeping up with enemy activity.  These past few days, I've found turning off sound effects and voice lines really helpful in making the game calmer and easier to keep track of. Defense in general, it helps to block low by default, and then block high if they're in the air.  You pretty much can't jump back and away from an enemy low, so it's better to either jump without blocking and hit them from above, or to block low... I think.  The recent upback changes are kinda complicated. Cerebella Specifically:  jHK is a fast, reliable way to maintain your own mobility and try to sting the enemy.  It also leads rather nicely to a cLK-started combo.  If I'm not sure if something will hit or if I want to break through enemy offense, I adore the armor on Battle Butt. Learning General: I find it helps to watch other players on streams, or to record my own matches.  I want to say Magma442 is a decent Cerebella player to watch.  Recording and watching your own matches is also really handy."

Skullgirls,3bhvja,MnemonicJohnny,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:07:02 2015 UTC,"Happy to help.  Not sure if it'd be good as an air-to-air; it's fast, but pretty vertical.  If you can get the angle right and find yourself above the enemy, go for it.  jLK might be better in air vs air, and you can then go for the jMP -> jHK etc.  As an air vs ground, though, jHK is fantastic.  I've also seen good use of jMP, but I've yet to incorporate it into my own stuff."

Skullgirls,3bgv3b,Scorialimit,4,Wed Jul 1 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"I have a question regarding Parasoul's backstory, in the end she wishes that her sister wouldn't become the new skullgirl and yet that wish is somehow impure because the skull heart says Umbrella will be spared...but Parasoul will take her place...""in time"". What makes Parasoul impure? Little confused on that one, considering she never took part in the creation of painwheel (or any mechanically altered beings like peacock created by the ASG Labs), not to mention she enforced the law and brought criminals to jail and not outright killed them. Is there a part of the story I missed?  Although their mom did ask for peace from the skull heart and became a skullgirl anyway. Which also begs a question of what exactly constitutes an ""impure heart""? Is it based on how noble a wish is? Or is it based on how virtuous and pure someone is?   I feel like I missed something in the cutscenes:P"
Skullgirls,3bgv3b,Redditisquiteamazing,6,Mon Jun 29 21:51:54 2015 UTC,"It's a rigged system. The Skullheart will never grant anyone's wish as they wished it, no matter how, ""pure,"" they are. Based on the other story modes, we see that the Skullheart often refers to the selfishness (or lack thereof) of wishes impacting how the wishes are granted (and the transformation speed), so we know selflessness delays the process, somehow.  The Skullheart is an anime monkey's paw, basically."
Skullgirls,3bgv3b,BigE1943,3,Mon Jun 29 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense. When you think of it, the Skullheart has planned a good luring technique. It gives the false sense of hope for certain people using it because they probably think in their minds that they are pure for whatever reason, or that their desired wish is too pure for the Skullheart to corrupt them.   But probably a good number really don't care about consequences (think ms.fortune in the start of her backstory)."
Skullgirls,3bgv3b,Redditisquiteamazing,5,Mon Jun 29 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"Put simply, the skullheart considers the mere act of wishing selfish because it is bending reality to your desires, and thus impure. This is just my understanding though."

Skullgirls,3bat77,Schwachsinn,8,Sat Jun 27 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"No it's how they are. They are called charge moves and require you to hold that direction for a little while before you can use the move.  People get these moves to work however because you can charge them while doing anything, from attacking to blocking. An example of this is if you use Parasoul's s.HP and start to hold down or back you can cancel the s.HP into napalm pillar or shot, depending on which one you charged."
Skullgirls,3bat77,Metal_Shadow,4,Sat Jun 27 13:09:38 2015 UTC,"Aha! So i dont need to actually move into the direction or sit down like a breeding duck, I just need to hold the direction while doing anythign else. Uff, thats gonna be tough to learn. But thanks a ton!"
Skullgirls,3bat77,Metal_Shadow,6,Sat Jun 27 13:11:23 2015 UTC,Yea. And it's easier to learn then you think. It's really just holding back or down during the combo then using the move like you would use a special move normally
Skullgirls,3bat77,Fluffy_Ducks,2,Sat Jun 27 13:53:22 2015 UTC,"A good practice is just to do st.HP and do napalm shot(light or medium) over and over. You only need to charge for around 2 seconds and st.HP is pretty perfect in timing. Another thing you can do is go full screen and do napalm shot HP version. If you do it correctly, you should just be spamming napalm shot every time your last shot hits full screen with no real waiting time."
Skullgirls,3bat77,RedArremer,2,Sat Jun 27 15:02:17 2015 UTC,"You only need to charge for around 2 seconds    Half a second, if I'm not mistaken."

Skullgirls,3bat77,BigE1943,3,Sat Jun 27 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"After HP you wanna do LP napalm shot and then follow up with a st.LP. Unless you're in the corner, there's no real way to combo off of st.HK so just don't bother with that move for now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwt-EnTPlfI  Your first link should look like the first link in this combo"
Skullgirls,3bat77,CK_Crash,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know of anything that you can follow up a standing chain with, but if you replace s.HK with <-s.HK, you can do some OTG thing. I don't know how to OTG combo yet, so I just do 2xHP.  (I'm not sure this is actually a combo move, I've seen it blocked before, but that might be because I don't hit the button fast enough)"
Skullgirls,3bat77,digitalskyfire,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:15:26 2015 UTC,This is the reason why Parasoul has so many x2 hit normal moves! You should use the extra time they buy you to setup charges.

Skullgirls,3b56iw,digitalskyfire,3,Fri Jun 26 02:41:04 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is one of the better answers, as it's reactionary, and not a prediction thing. If you block j.HP on the ground, you'll have plenty of time to react and pushblock.   The other answer, which is equally as safe, is to Up+Back shortly after you see him jump. If j.HP comes out, you'll chicken block it, land cancel your blockstun, and then you can counterpoke for free (You do have to watch out for j.HP xx Wolf Blitzer, but Blitzer is minus, and Skyfire's answer will work).  Do this against people who are looking to press buttons after blocked j.HP and you'll stuff them every time."

Skullgirls,3awp37,Razzeus,2,Thu Jun 25 00:31:47 2015 UTC,"Protip: The fastest way to get run followups is to press two buttons simultaneously. Pressing LK+MK will get you run-stop (you'll need to hold it for a few frames). Pressing MK+HK will give you Kanchou (you'll need to hold this for longer, obviously).  It's pretty easy to verify this in training mode. If you do run-stop cancels with the shortcut, you'll see that you end up at greater advantage.  So doing this as [4] s.LP > s.MP, 6+MK+HK should fix your issue."
Skullgirls,3awp37,brocoder,2,Wed Jun 24 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"I'll do you one better. I'm actually in the process of making a video to explain this. Charge Tumbling Run > Hold button for the special you want, I'll use Kanchou as an example, so MK > While holding MK, Input Tumbling Run with LK or HK. Instant Kanchou. Completely skips over the running animation. You can also hold the punch button for the special you want. Tumbling run has to be input with a K though. I made this to illustrate for someone else. https://youtu.be/OjzAMHReTZo"
Skullgirls,3awp37,TheBigBruce,2,Wed Jun 24 19:36:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that should work too, but I don't think it's any more instant than the method I suggested. More of a personal preference.

Skullgirls,3ax9i6,sjhwvu,12,Wed Jun 24 06:12:52 2015 UTC,Pushblock.
Skullgirls,3ax9i6,lolpounder,3,Wed Jun 24 06:58:12 2015 UTC,"Pushblocking is often the answer as mentioned yea, though Ms. Fortune does have tools around that, it's nevertheless a good idea to get into your muscle memory to pushblock whenever your opponent starts putting you in long blockstrings.   For more Squigly-based advice, it really depends on what situation you're in. My first advice would be to not get caught in the corner in the first place. Make sure to tech away from the corner and don't just jump backwards and spam aerials. Squigly has lot of tools that allow her to get space, J.HK beats out your opponent belows, J.MK and J.LK gives you space if they're closer to you and in the air. If the enemy Fortune is just spamming J.HP, one option could be to jump in and grab them during their startup. Divekicks as well are an excellent tool to maneuver around and avoid your enemy punishing you. Jumping up into J.HP will either hit your opponent, or if it's gonna miss, just do a light divekick to get out of trouble and maybe even get a chance to punish your enemy's attempt at punishing you.  If you are in the corner however, the most potent tool, though one that's difficult to use correctly. Daisy Pusher has a very quick startup and a lot of I frames, but your opponent can jump out of it. Unless, of course, they've already used their double jump and airdash. They'll also get caught by it if they're stuck in an animation as they're falling. It takes some practice, but if you can learn to spot when they're vulnerable, Daisy Pusher is an excellent reversal option.  Similarily, if Fortune is spamming jumping attacks, you can try using LK-HK or MK-HK Squigly Battle Opera depending on Fortune's position if you can predict where she'll be. SBO also has invulnerability on startup, and if hit will allow you plenty of time to combo and get out of the corner.  Finally, Squigly's DP, Draugen Punch, is a meter-less reversal option with enough invulnerability to get a hit in. If it is charged, you also have an extra couple of frames of invulnerability, though if it is blocked, you are at a major disadvantage. Only use it if you're confident it won't get blocked."
Skullgirls,3ax9i6,Nodscouter,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:38:57 2015 UTC,"Try to figure out how he starts his combos, and learn to block those particular openings.  Keep building charges, and remember that both Draugen Punch and Liver Mortis have invincibility frames."

For an alternative to it maybe you could have something like this that I made? It's obviously not the 'final cut' to the idea or anything since I whipped it up in like a minute; and I know there's more dialogue in the matchmaking service than just 'please wait searching for an appropriate match so maybe it could get closer to clapping together as it progresses through the 'matchmaking' process until it finds a match and 'claps' together? It could help people that take a minute or two who wait to look for a match too instead of just wondering where in the 'process they're in too!  You could also just make the icon in the task bar flash when the match is ready too instead of having it flash ingame! Thank you very much for responding!!

Skullgirls,3atvmk,rushnorush,6,Tue Jun 23 13:49:44 2015 UTC,"It's kind of up to you depending on how serious you are. If you're looking for basic commentary on stuff like getting in and character playstyle or match ups then stuff more than a year old would work as that hasn't changed very much. Keep in mind it should be after the undizzy was changed to 240(which was sometime in 2013 I think). If you want to watch stuff looking for resets or tech that still works, I would suggest watching stuff after the wulf patch(April of this year) since lot's of people had changes done to them. Though again, this is a little iffy as well since some fighters were changed greatly(ex: valentine being able to combo after Bypass) while others weren't changed very much.   Because you play val/bella though, I would recommend watching after the wolf patch because that valentine change was really big to her gameplay/combos. Bella also got a few changes that nerfed her in that patch. You can be flexible though and watch stuff from I would say the Eliza patch(which is november of 2014).   For people, Thatoneotherdude and hopsawtch play val and bella. Unfortunately, I don't know how often these guys play skullgirls anymore since I haven't seen them very actively in tournaments or online. For cerebella, there's dekillsage of course and there's tons of gameplay for him. Here is his youtube channel. He doesn't post so much gameplay here though(at least not very recently) but if you look for him on youtube there will be tons of stuff(recent too). There's duckator and cloudking for valentine. For filia, there's wingzero and sonicfox(though he doesn't play filia so much anymore).  For tournaments:  Here's Combo breaker top 16 and then top 8 - very recent  Arc Divide-4 months ago  Winter brawl  Keep in mind there are a lot of good players you can watch besides the ones I mentioned, I just thought of them first. Duckator is the only one that posts vids regularly on his channel. There are plently of great players online too, so if you see someone and think you can learn something, add them(assuming you play on steam). Watch twitch too, there's tons of online tournaments that are run on the weekends that you can see."
Skullgirls,3atvmk,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks a lot for the effort you put into this!   I already watched through all the combo breaker footage I could find (even some pool matches) and will watch the other ones you posted as well.   I have the game on ps3 and, thanks to the recent sale, also on steam. I didn't venture into the online world much yet, so I'm not sure which platform I'll use for online play."
Skullgirls,3atvmk,Fluffy_Ducks,5,Tue Jun 23 19:47:58 2015 UTC,"I would suggest using steam for online play since I think it has a larger playerbase(and it will definitely have more people in your skill level).

Skullgirls,3atvmk,brocoder,2,Wed Jun 24 06:51:47 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how(I guess I would just ask /u/digitalskyfire). If it were to be put into the Beginner FAQ I would probably want to improve it and make it its own post.
Skullgirls,3atvmk,brocoder,3,Wed Jun 24 14:22:48 2015 UTC,"There were a few Val/Bella players at Combo Breaker (SomePerson, Hopscawtch, and myself), but I don't think any of our pools matches got streamed.  SomePerson plays at Salty pretty often, so if you watch that you can see him play (he's a weirdo though, and only uses Excellebella assist). Hops used to stream a used to stream a lot, but I don't think he streams very often these days. If you want to see me play, the easiest way would be to watch/join Skullgirls Slapfest (there's casuals tonight, actually). You can also just add me on Steam, I'd be happy to help with advice."
Skullgirls,3atvmw,EmotionlessSarc,12,Tue Jun 23 13:49:57 2015 UTC,"Neither is better. They are completely different characters made to do completely different things. One is rush down, and one is a zoner. That is almost like comparing val to peacock."

Skullgirls,3atvmw,LOTO-12,3,Sun Jun 28 07:02:53 2015 UTC,why not both? :^)
Skullgirls,3atvmw,Captain_Ochinchin,5,Wed Jun 24 06:01:05 2015 UTC,"Well, Skullgirls IS a team-based fighting game.  Why not split the difference and pick both up?  They each have moves that work remarkably well with each other - for instance, Fukua's various Drill specials let you lock someone into a blocking animation for a while which allows you to get behind or above or below them a lot easier, and Filia's Updo is an extremely potent anti-air that covers an angle Fukua's fireballs don't quite hit."
Skullgirls,3atvmw,MnemonicJohnny,2,Tue Jun 23 14:27:21 2015 UTC,"Filia, because Hairball."
Skullgirls,3atvmw,Sauceofspace,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:03:58 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, the characters should be mostly balanced. There will obviously always be matchups where some character is better against some others, but in exchange, said character is worse against some others. Thus, there is really no ""best"" character, and no character is better than another generally, but against a specific opponent, there are better and worse characters.  Obviously, Fukua will kick ass against range-challenged characters, and Filia is somewhat the opposite. But that doesn't really say much. As someone already pointed out, since you get to choose 1, 2 or 3 characters whenever you play, why not pick both and use the other in situations where the other struggles? Get the best of both worlds."
Skullgirls,3arh4y,KidPanda,4,Mon Jun 22 22:30:51 2015 UTC,So glad this game gets recognition at evolution.  So polished.    Not sure if I'll like it more than MKX but it's off to a good start.
Skullgirls,3as9c0,kkwalker,2,Tue Jun 23 02:32:32 2015 UTC,"Any invincible move would beat this (afaik there's no such thing as a move that's hit invincible but still throw vulnerable), and there's no need to guess on using meter. Against this setup, you can super on reaction if you're looking at Beowulf to go for the command throw."
Skullgirls,3as9c0,digitalskyfire,3,Tue Jun 23 03:02:33 2015 UTC,"MP Bang, one of the beat extends (i forget which one), upper khat, liver mortis, and heavy chair are all strike invincible only.  I always forget if it still is, but heavy drill used to be strike invincible only."

Skullgirls,3as9c0,brocoder,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:02:17 2015 UTC,MP Bang! is only hit invincible during startup iirc.
Skullgirls,3as9c0,adrigreat14,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:16:03 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. Most invincible moves are only invincible for a limited amount of time at the start :P"
Skullgirls,3as9c0,digitalskyfire,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:24:44 2015 UTC,No I mean you can throw Peacock out of MP Bang!. Its hit invincible but not throw invincible.
Skullgirls,3as9c0,adrigreat14,3,Tue Jun 23 04:59:33 2015 UTC,"Checks out, because LP bang is only throw invincible. Peacock actually has zero unconditional reversals."
Skullgirls,3as9c0,HotsteamingGlory,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:30:10 2015 UTC,"Weren't these taken out? I thought if you enter prejump and the point character's command grab box connects, the assist is no longer unblockable while rising.  At the very least, I'm pretty sure it was taken out for Low Assist connecting during prejump + Command Grab overlap during prejump."
Skullgirls,3as9c0,TheBigBruce,2,Tue Jun 23 03:38:20 2015 UTC,"In situations of up backing, they'll have already left the ground before the command grab hitbox touches them."

Skullgirls,3as9c0,Prime1153,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:02:02 2015 UTC,"These setups used to be unblockable back in the day, but nowadays if you jump out of a command grab you become invulnerable to throws, and your pre-jump frames are invincible (or something like that). You can still create hard-to-escape setups by changing your timing (say, Excellebella then Wulf Shoot), but nothing's inescapable."
Skullgirls,3aqhi9,senbei616,5,Mon Jun 22 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"I would think pressing the Gamepad's Start equivalent (usually ENTER) would get you the desired effect, testing now. *Just tried it, when selecting your character instead of selecting with LP press enter on your desired character."
Skullgirls,3aqhi9,jonmsanti,3,Mon Jun 22 18:23:16 2015 UTC,Press the Start button to select the color palette manually with the movement keys. Use the different punch and kick buttons to quick select the specific color you want.  I don't use the keyboard so I have no idea what the actual keys are.
Skullgirls,3aqhi9,tredecima,2,Mon Jun 22 18:28:31 2015 UTC,Whatever your start button is mapped to allows you to manually select whatever color palette you want from a little popup menu.

Skullgirls,3ashi5,AshtonFaydenko,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah no problem man. The only problem I've ever noticed by this was just after the 'choose character', that the whole screen flashes black and white like a flash bang really quickly; other than that I'm fine. Most of the time it needs to be something like a strobe light or something to actually effect me. Stress is always gunna be a thing and honestly, I'm in a more stressful situation irl than anything ingame so if anything it helps me relax and get my mind off of a lot of irl stuff that's happening."

Something would 'happen at the last minute', also we got scammed royally by a fake realtor for the rest of our money so now my mom is couch surfing with my brother at my friends house while I stay at my dad's. We're all penniless, and the only reason I'm even online, let alone not dead is because my dad took me in and feeds me.   So tl;dr, no I can't."

By setting it to 1280x720 you'll be turning 1 pixel into exactly 4 pixels, since it's half the resolution in each direction. By using a weird resolution like 1344x756 you're scaling the image by a non-integer number and thus distorting the image."
Skullgirls,3aoe5m,shadowdude777,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:13:49 2015 UTC,here's the really weird part. On the Imac the current resolution without any boxing occurs at 1280x720. The weird resolution of 1344x756 is the exact resolution of my laptop which skullgirls plays flawlessly on. but no matter what at 2560x1440 it turns in into a box in the top left corner.

I use to do the bootcamp thing but just didnt want to dedicate hard drive space to Windows OS. The good thing about the wineskin port option is that the PS3 controller works without any drivers.
Skullgirls,3aoe5m,shadowdude777,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:22:41 2015 UTC,Does the Wineskin option really work for you? That's surprising. I never got it to work. Maybe the different hardware on my Macbook Pro Retina (Haswell CPU) as opposed to your iMac is the culprit here.

Skullgirls,3aiftw,Lucavora,7,Sat Jun 20 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"A fight stuck is absolutely not required. If you are comfortable with your controller, then use it. If you're having trouble with your inputs, I recommend going into training mode, putting the inputs at stick and list and then look at how you do the actual move. You might notice that you're hitting the button too early or late or something else. I don't know what moves specifically you have trouble with, but a lot of people have trouble with doing dragon punches. If that's the case, try to see if doing a forward and then a quarter circle forward, pressing the button in the middle of the quarter circle, helps out.   If you need any help with cerebella you can add me on steam(my name is the same as my username) and there are also a bunch of other guides I can link you(unfortunately I'm on mobile right now, so I'll do that later). Cerebella is nice in that she's very beginner friendly with her links and does high damage for simple combos. The hardest thing you'll have link as a beginner is probably st.HK > cerecoptor > super. I hope this helps    EDIT: I made this video for you or anyone else needing reference for inputs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6GFS2SWXyg  I inputted some of the moves a little sloppier so you can see how easy going skullgirls is in recognizing a special move. Focus on the stick inputs at the left or the bottom. The video is also done at 75 percent slo mo so just keep that in mind."

Go at your own pace though, it's split up into three different sections. Focus on the beginner one for now."
Skullgirls,3aiftw,Adwins,2,Sat Jun 20 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"it's funny because I found NRS games to be more complex than SG (started with Injustice). if you haven't noticed, combos work differently here than in MK so it'll definitely take getting used to. However, a lot of links/combos are still timing-based so just try and grind combos in training.  with my little experience in MK, i don't know how neutral works there, but choosing cerebella (as a non-cerebella main, mind), you're in luck because she's got a lot of good normals to get in, pressur the opponent, and/or defend. Just think of normals as the dialed attack strings  Cerebella is also really good because a lot of her damage comes from grab resets, and resets are very important in this game (especially at higher levels). so if you want to learn that, Bella is a good start"
Skullgirls,3aiftw,3DPK,2,Sat Jun 20 16:25:28 2015 UTC,"You're weapon of choice is all up to you, what ever you feel more comfortable playing on. Took me 2 years to learn clean inputs on my arcade stick, and my execution is still really bad. If you're having troubles with inputs I'll go ahead and parrot everyone already and say that training mode with your inputs turned on are your best friend. Try doing each move 10 times in a row with out messing up, on each side, everyday, a few times a day.  As far as how to play Bella, that's where I learned. Zidiane put in a lot of solo Bella work, but there is always something small you can learn from other people."

I'd recommend the tutorials if you haven't already, then look up a couple of combos and practice them in training.  If you're having issues with moves coming out make sure you're actually pressing the right commands, I don't know about MKX, but Skullgirls gives you a lot of leniency when it comes to executing and chaining moves together."

Skullgirls,3aiftw,7upjawa,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:04:40 2015 UTC,What logitech controller do you use?
Skullgirls,3aiftw,TheBigBruce,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"Been playing this game for a while now on pad, and switched to stick for no other reason than that i wanted to. I still practice on both though, and i don't find stick any easier than pad, it just makes more sense to me. Honestly, I would stick with pad unless you really just want to play on stick. If its the Xbox controller holding you back, but you wanna stick with a PD, try a PS1, PS2, or Sega Saturn controller with an adapter. I still use an old black Logitech pad because I don't own a ps2 adapter. If you want to go with a stick, don't cheap out on one. Don't go for the most expensive stick, but for a budget, look for anything from a $120-$200 range, and make sure to do your research. I run a custom 6 face button stick with Sanwa Buttons and joystick on a Cthulhu PCB, but if you want good sticks for decent prices premade cheack out quanba/eightarc, or if you want a stick that is used at all levels of play and is trustworthy, try the Madcatz TE (comes with a hefty pricetag of $200). Realistically you could play on anything. There is a guy who Plays MvC3 on a Guitar Hero Guitar, and he can do Chun Li infinites, So if you want to be that guy who plays skullgirls on an N64 controller (which isnt that bad for KI gold lol) go right ahead.  In terms of tips on how to improve...  1. Get Bodied online  2. Don't give up  3. Spend hours in training mode  4. Get bodied online but not as bad  5. Rinse and repeat until you are Skull-Jesus. If anything as long as you overcome the not giving up part, you will be good. Edit: Also I have tried to format this post so those were bullet points like 6 times now. fuck off reddit XD"
Skullgirls,3aiftw,Alchnator,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"Combos and strings in MK are very rigid, and the situations on hit and block are pretty cut and dry. Skullgirls is very freeform in comparison, but know that just because you blocked something, doesn't mean it's ""your turn"" until you pushblock the opponent away (Or they do something truly unsafe).  One of the big things you'll find that's different is, even on whiff, that any point of normal attacks can be cancelled into specials/supers, and that almost any point of specials can be cancelled into supers.  Movement is also far different, is a lot more responsive, and is different for every character.  Just how familiar are you with MKX? The biggest thing you can take from that game is it's focus on frame advantage."
Skullgirls,3aiftw,kkwalker,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:05:45 2015 UTC,"i never touched MKX, but if it is anything like MK9 then the big difference you gonna find is with the way the game buffer commands.  mk9 essentialy buffers everything and requires a clean input string. ie you do the whole combo input at once, and the character will keep hitting even if you finished the input looooong ago. now skullgirls during a chain will give you the time of your current move to buffer the next one in a chain. if is not a chain then there is no buffer at all even if the combo doesn't breaks. imho it is actually a lot easier.  the other big difference is combos as whole, mk9 give you some ""premade"" combos per character that can be canceled in special moves and combos happens mostly because of juggling.  in skullgirls anyone can do weak to strong chains(just do the chain tutorial) and anything goes in a combo as long you don't trigger the IPS(infinite prevention system) which is something you definitely shouldn't worry about right now(the tutorial again explains the basic of it). in the end it is actually a lot simpler and flows easier than MK9 once you get the gist of it"

Skullgirls,3ah6mh,Rhizy27,8,Sat Jun 20 03:38:43 2015 UTC,"For a long time I didn't feel like I had a satisfactory understanding of neutral in this game, and in some ways I still don't. You'll be able to find a lot of advice for how to play Parasoul in neutral and that'll be useful but it's not the kind of answer that would have helped me when I was trying to get a handle on things.  You probably already understand that neutral in Skullgirls is about getting a solid hit confirm in so you can transition into set play. Once you're in it's very easy to make a lot of headway in a match. There are a lot of players I can't beat if I let them win neutral once or twice (cough cough Joshb)  The best I can do for you is to recommend watching some games. You don't have to find expert players to watch, sometimes it's best to see what happens when people make mistakes. Find games with parasoul and look at how she plays. Pay attention to where she puts herself relative to her opponent, take note of approaches and retreats, how she responds to pressure, when to attack and when not to, and anything else you think is useful.

Skullgirls,3ah6mh,Tommer,2,Sat Jun 20 06:32:21 2015 UTC,"use tears for zoning and dash jump j.HP for pressure, poke range-appropriately (LP closest f+HP farthest), know your safe blockstrings (i think the first hit of s.MK is safe? and youve always got 2 hits of LP/LK for confirms)  parasoul has good lows and 2 standing overheads, so even though her throw is a little lacking in range shes good at opening up opponents, even in neutral"
Skullgirls,3ah6mh,Captain_Ochinchin,7,Sat Jun 20 04:00:31 2015 UTC,For dash jump use j.LP. If it hits you can confirm unlike j.hp
Skullgirls,3ah6mh,Krye07,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:55:37 2015 UTC,i always use j.HP because it has a million years of stun but j.LP confirms are objectively better now that i think about it
Skullgirls,3ah6mh,Captain_Ochinchin,2,Sat Jun 20 06:25:49 2015 UTC,LP is also much faster
Skullgirls,3ah6mh,Krye07,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:39:16 2015 UTC,"The running joke is that SG doesn't have neutral game. I play both Peacock and Filia, and I can tell you for the most part its true (for me). Skullgirls is fast, and lots of stuff is happening all the time. Once you have momentum you kind of keep it. Mode for getting that momentum of course changes depending on the characters. from what I've seen, parasoul is used as denial. Most of her moves are big, and used to swat people who think they are ""in"". Tears of course create tears."
Skullgirls,3agzb6,_5Cents,5,Sat Jun 20 02:20:51 2015 UTC,"lows tend to come out faster than overheads, so block low on instinct and block high on reaction. tech throws when you feel em coming, parasoul especially has to be very close for her throw to connect (closer than she normally likes to be, so use that as a tell)  EDIT: i forgot you can totally also jump throws and that works better but is also riskier (you might get anti-aired or just straight-out airthrown, but as long as you are holding up you cant be groundthrown)"
Skullgirls,3agzb6,Captain_Ochinchin,4,Sat Jun 20 04:03:49 2015 UTC,"I wrote this copy-pasta earlier:  Get in the habit of pushblocking immediately upon blocking something, unless it's a multi-hitting move. The only time you shouldn't be pushblocking when you can is if there's an assist in play, at which point, a late pushblock works far better (You get some high/low and left/right protection during the pushblock animation)  If you think they're going to do only Lows: Block low and pushblock immediately. If they try to chain into another normal, it will whiff in front of you in some cases, and you'll have plenty of time to act.  If you think they're going to try and Throw you immediately or Overhead, hold Up+Back. It beats both options.  Once they've used all their possible lows in their opening string, move from Down+Back to Up+Back by default. There's no reason to block low unless they have a low later in their chain of normals. If you think they're going to go for a late Low (Sweep or Squigly Stance Cancel into a Low) and you haven't pushblocked yet, then you're going to have to keep blocking low until you get a pushblock off.  Only when the opponent is using a Grab assist should you theoretically be required to Throw Tech to escape something (Since you can't block the assist, which means you can't avoid the point character's own grab via movement options).  If someone is being predictable or doing something reactable, you can DP or Super. No harm in doing it if you're sure it's going to hit. It can be simpler than dealing with a tricky setups.  Against some characters, like Big Band, who commits to Big Reads™, sometimes it's a good idea to jump forward into a j.LP air chain into full combo if you make a big read on his throw/command grab attempts. Risk vs. Reward.  Really good players have setups that will beat both a high and low block if you just do one and don't switch it up after the first hit (or pushblock immediately). They will also reset you in ways that a reversal Super will not work. It's up to you to identify these situations and pushblock accordingly, reversal when appropriate and act accordingly once you've made that tiny bit of space with the pushblock.  Great players are literally going to be able to read your mind through your actions. You are not a special snowflake, and they know everything about new player habits, intermediate habits and top player habits. Don't get discouraged when the defensive options you've chosen don't work out, or you don't escape at all in a match against a practiced player. They will train you midmatch to act a certain way, or to block a certain way.  When you're reset in the air, you will have to throw tech if they're going to throw, since you can't get out of the way. You will have to block if you think they're going to try and catch your throw animation with an attack. If you play a character with a double jump, you can jump with Up+Back to keep blocking AND sometimes escape the mixup if they're not in your face when you recover."
Skullgirls,3agzb6,TheBigBruce,2,Sat Jun 20 06:23:44 2015 UTC,Some resets you have to block. Some resets it's better to mash. Others you just escape. Look for openings and use them.
Skullgirls,3agzb6,Krye07,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:06:25 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there's only one answer to this question.   You have to learn to see where the attack is going to come from. Maybe watch some actual Parasol reset combo vids to get a feel for it. When it comes to resets, there is points it can be blocked and punished. Time and practice help the best. <3"
Skullgirls,3agzb6,Ontrevant,2,Sat Jun 20 02:53:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is a very good idea because there's all kinds of resets Parasoul can do, but the folks this guy is playing are likely only using a select few. Trying to account for all of them is probably overkill and way too bulky of a task.  My advice is to try to challenge those people to some longer sets, and focus on identifying what buttons they used to reset you, and roughly at what part of the combo they used them. Remember that there's handy indicators to be able to tell if you got hit by a low or an overhead (the broken heart, the !?). Then, try to figure out how to deal with those resets, either by blocking or possibly using a reversal special or super move."

If you want to go from doing forward + attack into a QCF attack, do a half circle.  You technically only need to hit d+b, but i generally find full half circle a little easier and more reliable."

Of course Tager's version is without meter but it accomplishes the same thing which is to bait them into thinking you dropped combo then punishing.  As for it being worth the meter, not too sure but if you can get more damage off I suppose it would be.  All and all it is just a flashy way to trigger a burst bait."
Skullgirls,3a95kz,Livingwind,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:57:41 2015 UTC,There is actually a reason because I am sure after the delaying the magnetic trap people like to press buttons in the air. Combined with some people's tendencies to mash reversals and things of that nature a burst-bait using meter isn't really all that unacceptable by the standards of using a burst-bait.
Skullgirls,3a95kz,AOWYomabuddy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:59:35 2015 UTC,Why would someone good hit a button?

Skullgirls,3a4s44,Captain_Ochinchin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:52:22 2015 UTC,Faster than SF 4 for sure. Slightly faster than UMvC3 but slightly under MvC2. But can it possibly be as equal as the other two depending on playstyle. So I would put SG in between UMvC3 and MvC2.
Skullgirls,3a4s44,GhettoThrasher,2,Wed Jun 17 07:09:13 2015 UTC,Have you seen modern marvel? If magneto is on screen the game moved way faster than pretty much any other game.
Skullgirls,3a4s44,ZachityZach,2,Thu Jun 18 05:25:38 2015 UTC,This is about overall pace and not necessarily just game speed. Magneto still moves faster in MvC2 anyway. But the pace is pretty similar anyway between 2 & 3 and the difference isn't that much. Skullgirls was design to be similar to MvC2 but with hints to other fighters.
Skullgirls,3a4s44,GhettoThrasher,-1,Thu Jun 18 06:04:38 2015 UTC,"Slower than Vampire Savior/Darkstalkers, faster than most others though. I find it comparable to 3rd Strike (maybe a bit faster though?)"

Skullgirls,3a18nz,Streloks,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:03:12 2015 UTC,"Most supers only freeze you long enough to get a guaranteed hit point blank (This is actually a change from long ago, where they'd freeze you for far longer). If you're enough of a ways out, you can counter with an invincible move or your own super.  The freeze is so slight into the first active frame of most supers, that it rarely goes past the first hit. This let's characters like Painwheel cover reversal windows with j.HP, absorb the first hit during the freeze and Thresher right through before she gets tagged by the 2nd hit.  ""Super-Proof"" setups like these are all over high level play. Many are character specific."

Skullgirls,3a2w3d,Spieren,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:54:56 2015 UTC,"You have no assists so countering assists is difficult, you don't have access to DHC's for extra damage (and Para's damage is already worst in the game, though the ratio difference might balance it out somewhat), your pressure/neutral is worse because you don't have assists backing your pressure/neutral up and you don't have access to raw tags and alpha counters that are really useful reversals in some circumstances (raw tag in particular is great against command grab + anti air grab assist mixups). There's probably more but these are the most significant."
Skullgirls,3a2w3d,AOWYomabuddy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:56:38 2015 UTC,You raise some good points that i will keep in mind. While Parasoul will have a much more significantly difficult time to get in and play the neutral game when i could get caught by an assist or zoned out. I understand the MvC2 influence in the team game and assist make matches much less difficult. I really tend to like to play footsies as i have Recently picked back up Street Fighter after playing only Melee for a Year and a Half. I really want to find a good team for her. I really like Fillia and can play her to an extent. I just need another Fighter to fill the 3rd slot.   Edit: Added a word

Skullgirls,3a16p7,BMonkeyPower,4,Tue Jun 16 12:40:37 2015 UTC,"No combo lasts forever. And you don't want a combo that goes on that long, either. Skullgirls has damage scaling implemented such that every hit after the first two has a damage multiplier of 0.875 attached to it (down to a minimum of 0.2). So with every hit, you're doing less damage than the last one.  To make things even worse for you, the meter-gain formula in this game is a function of the damage-scaling. For you, the attacker, the damage-scaling gets factored in as a coefficient. For the defender, 1 - damageScaling gets factored in as a coefficient.   Which means that as a combo goes on:   You're doing less and less damage per hit You're gaining less and less meter per hit Your opponent is gaining more and more meter per hit   Keep your combos short, sweet, and damaging. You'll find they're easier to pull off, they let you work with a high undizzy bar without getting bursted, and they still do like 80% of the damage that your mega-long combo does.  As a Valentine main, I know it's easy to assume that longest combo is best combo, but it's far from the truth. You're just going to give your opponent a buttload of meter and do maybe an extra 1k damage. It's not worth the tradeoffs."
Skullgirls,3a16p7,shadowdude777,3,Tue Jun 16 13:03:49 2015 UTC,"Just to tack onto this: raw number of hits is a bad indicator of combo quality.  I mean, Bella does something like 9 or 10k in 40 hits.  Parasoul barely hits 7k.  What really matters is undizzy."
Skullgirls,3a16p7,weealex,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:42:56 2015 UTC,"Just got to say, she can't typically do quite that much damage on her own anymore (without using level 3). She got gimped in the Beowulf update and now she does about 8-8.5k with her max damage combos. After that she hits full undizzy."
Skullgirls,3a16p7,StillApony,2,Wed Jun 17 10:52:08 2015 UTC,"Never seen it that way. Thanks for all that good information! I will definitely take this to the bank. I have one more question actually. It not about Valentine in general, but i have always wondered if there's any difference in having 3 characters, or just one as solo. I know if you have more characters in a match, there gonna do less damage and have less health and the opposite way if you have 2 characters or less. I just because i have seen people either play 1 or 3 characters online a couple of times, and was wondering if it makes any sense? or is it just whatever you like?"
Skullgirls,3a16p7,shadowdude777,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:50:33 2015 UTC,"The damage + health are scaled to generally make it fair to 1, 2, and 3 man teams. The main disadvantage of being solo, though, is that you don't get to use assists. Skullgirls has a really chaotic neutral game and assists are frequently your only way to start a combo. Especially as Valentine, who has fantastic mobility and really poor mixup options. She really only shines with an assist to trip the opponent up so she can get in and do some damage. Valentine is generally regarded as the worst solo character, but the best character to have as the lead on a team with 1 or 2 good assist backing characters.  Conversely, some characters just play fantastically solo. For example, Cerebella or Beowulf. They can play potentially even better with assists, but they shine on their own, too.  It's all about team synergy. But for beginners, I generally recommend starting solo (yes, even if it's Valentine). Get really, REALLY comfortable with that character, and then add a 2nd one to the mix if you want. You'll pick that 2nd character up way quicker once your fundamentals are solid.  Teams that I play:   Valentine, Eliza (current main team) Valentine, Squigly, Eliza Valentine, Eliza, Bella Valentine, Eliza, Robo-Fortune (this will be my new main team once R Fortune is out)"
Skullgirls,3a16p7,weealex,3,Tue Jun 16 14:56:54 2015 UTC,"Neutral isn't chaotic.  It just looks like that if you don't know the game.  It's like Marvel 2 in that respect.  I mean, watch Duckator play.  Is that chaotic?  It's basically Storm/Sent/Commando."
Skullgirls,3a16p7,Drawlestia,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"Valentine and Eliza? That sound pretty awesome man!

You're looking to dodge and weave your way in, then go ham on your opponent  Cerebella - The bully.  You do big damage on clean hits and have OK options in neutral, but not super great mobility.  Once you get in, you want your opponent afraid.  They expect throw? You hit them low.  They try to block?  You grab 'em.  You have some options to force people to play honest.  Mostly thought, you're just trying to force your opponent to fall into defensive habits you can punish  Parasoul - You gotta play honest.  She has some OK mixups, but they're not nearly as ambiguous as most everyone else's.  She has the worst combo damage output in the game.  Her mobility is very awkward as she lacks both double jumps and air dashes.  However, despite all this, her buttons are amazing.  Long range, many are disjointed, and relatively quick.    Valentine - Best mobility in the game IMO.  Both her vertical and horizontal speeds are good.  Her light normal attacks aren't very good, but her stronger normals offer a lot of options.  Her raw damage isn't very much, but she can make normally weak combos can rack up a lot of damage if you have some poison vials loaded.  Her biggest weakness is her terrible defensive options.  She lacks a meterless reversal and even her supers are fairly weak as a defensive option.  She also has really shitty assist options.  Ms. Fortune - Really weird.  Imagine Ice Climbers except sometimes you want Nana and sometimes you don't.  She does OK damage and has some good resets, but her biggest strength is strong pressure strings, especially headless.  She has a relatively easy time forcing her opponent to just keep blocking.  She's also got some goddamn filthy burst baits.  Her biggest weakness is that her headless reversals are very hard to set up and that when you're head off, there's a very real risk of just dying if both head and body get caught in a combo.  Her assist options are also really weird, as they're generally different depending on if she's head on or off  Double - Much like parasoul, she has to play honest.  She lacks a lot of the dirty mixup options that most characters have.  She benefits more than most for having meter, as her supers are very good.  She does OK damage, but has to rely fairly heavily on throw mixups, limiting her combo damage.    Painwheel - Hi-low: the character.  Because she can fly cancel most everything, she can be very dirty on her mixups.  Hatred Guard also means she can bait out reversals and punch right through for extra damage.  The skill of a Painwheel player can be entirely determined by how well they fly.  You need to be able to fly-cancel at a moment's notice to block quickly or avoid an attempt to poke her away.  The problem with her is that her attacks are relatively slow or short range.  Also, her assist options are pretty weak.  That said, Hatred Install is a reeeeeally god DHC option.  I'll cover dlc characters when i've got a bit more time"
Skullgirls,39xxt5,weealex,19,Mon Jun 15 18:57:25 2015 UTC,"OK, got dinner and my oil change.  Also, realized I forgot Peacock, so,  Peacock - Your prototypical zoner.  Your goal is to put enough crap on the screen that your opponent can't hit you.  She's got better escapes than most zoners, and really heinous mixups, but her bread and butter is full screen.  Her great flaw is in that her reversals only work on specific types of attacks.  You have to pick whether to dodge throws or strikes.  Fukua - Probably the closest thing to a shoto in this game.  She's got a fireball and a forward moving attack kinda like a tatsu.  No DP though.  Her defense is suspect, as her only fully invincible moves are in the form of supers.  People who player her go one of two ways:  either they try and chuck fireballs while airborne at full screen or they go in and take advantage of her really good j.hk.  Squigly - She's... weird.  You've gotta play a really weird defensive game for a while, as her methods of approach aren't great.  However, her buttons are really good and once you've got a punch charge, you can threaten any whiffed normal as long as you have meter.  Once in, her mixup game is near the top, especially if she's got a stance charge.  She's just a very opportunistic character, looking to snipe a bad decision by her opponent, then press until victory  Big Band - One of, if not the hardest hitting character, with the best reversal options.  He can make someone's day very bad and very short.  Problem is, he's huge.  There are tricks that hit him that hit no one else.  He spends most of the match having to wait for his opponent to do something, then he hammers them.  He's got some offensive options, but his hallmark is getting a counterhit and making everyone dead.  Eliza - Long range attacks and brutal, reversal safe mixups.  She's an offensive juggernaut.  While she isn't especially fast, she has a few reasonable options to move around, and her long reach lets her hit without being in point blank range.  Excepting her very good anti air options, her defensive options are very weak.  She just wants to be attacking all the time, preferably from above her opponent.  Beo and Robo are new enough that I'm not gonna try and explain them"
Skullgirls,39xxt5,weealex,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:41:38 2015 UTC,dont forget squiggly has some insane frame traps too. it is almost impossible to reversal her from blockstun since she can stance cancel at any time
Skullgirls,39xxt5,kkwalker,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"Based on what you mentioned about Eliza, specifically her excelling at straight up ""attacking all the time, preferably from above her opponent"", would you say she and Fukua would make a good team?  I'm pretty new to the game and I've pretty much only played Fukua. I've gone through her story mode on nightmare mode and found that her air game specifically her crossup (is that the right term?) j.HK was pretty strong, at least versus bots. Based on what you said about Eliza i feel like she'd be a good teammate for Fukua in that sense. Is this the case?"
Skullgirls,39xxt5,AghhPlaygu,3,Wed Jun 17 03:38:01 2015 UTC,"Well, Sonicfox won combo breaker with that team.  SG is a game that lets you just kinda play whomever you like and call it a team."
Skullgirls,39xxt5,weealex,7,Wed Jun 17 17:57:20 2015 UTC,Well to explain in terms of smash is near impossible considering the games are as close as it comes to being opposites. However I can give a quick rundown of the casts strengths.  Filia : Rushdown/Airdasher  Painwheel: Rushdown/fly-character  Ms.Fortune: Rushdown/Puppet (Headless)  Squigly: Rushdown  Peacock: Zoner  Fukua: Zoner/Rushdown  Bigband: Punish/Mixup  Cerebella: Grappler  Eliza: Strong Neutral  Robo Fortune: Incomplete  Beowulf: Punish/Mixup  Parasoul: Mixup/Zoner  Valentine: Rushdown/Airdasher  Double: Utility? (Im not quite sure how to describe double)

Skullgirls,39xxt5,FluffyHuffy,2,Mon Jun 15 19:00:55 2015 UTC,Could elaborate more on how they're opposites?
Skullgirls,39xxt5,TheBigBruce,3,Mon Jun 15 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"The fundamentals you focus on are completely different. I think the only thing they share is the concept of ""whiff punishing"", but even that is slightly more open ended in Skullgirls with Super Cancelling and Assists available to the whiffer.  You're going to find that situations where you make hard reads on your opponent come far more abruptly than in Melee play, and keeping your offense going is going to rely more on tricking your opponent to block incorrectly than your own ability to tech chase.  All in all, characters can not be quantified or compared to Melee characters, simply because what defines them is slightly out of Melee's scope. What they're good at and used for has no relevance in Melee's engine, if that makes sense.  Traditional fighters can be more punishing if you don't learn how the engine works. I'd say well over two-thirds of the people I talk to at my local melee tournaments (Roughly 100 people) aren't completely familiar with Melee's mechanics, but due to tech skill and Melee's analog environment, they do very well regardless.  You're going to find that the skill-floor to effective play in SG is far easier than Melee, but that learning system mechanics are going to go a long way due to Pushblock, Undizzy/IPS and the Assist system."
Skullgirls,39xxt5,lolpounder,3,Mon Jun 15 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"Yes essentially the games just are not compatible in the sense of engine and mechanics. You block in directions in traditional 2D fighters instead of having a shield. There is breakaway/teching throws, very long and damaging comboes, etc. The game also is completely reliant on health rather than the concept of ringing out your opponent so positioning whilst important is less important than in smash."
Skullgirls,39xxt5,CptRedLine,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:53:57 2015 UTC,"And even concepts of combos are largely different. There's no such thing as a block string in smash, and there's no cancelling. Offensive in both games are so wildly different."
Skullgirls,39xxt5,bashdemears,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:08:23 2015 UTC,There's ALOT of canceling in melee.
Skullgirls,39xxt5,videogamefool11,2,Tue Jun 16 01:21:48 2015 UTC,"Not really, the only times moves cancel is when you touch the ground after an arial, which puts you into a state where you can't do anything for a number of frames, other than that shine can be canceled into jump, but only two characters in the game have a shine."
Skullgirls,39xxt5,bashdemears,2,Tue Jun 16 06:12:17 2015 UTC,"Well there are some character specific cancels. LIke you mentioned there's shine, as well as ledge cancelling, needle cancelling, jump cancelilng, etc. But those are a lot different than the cancelling you do in this game as far as I can tell."

Skullgirls,39sorj,FavorableCookie,6,Sun Jun 14 11:28:42 2015 UTC,"What kind of characters do you like to play?   If it's charge characters, the you should go for a square gate (I like the Hori Hayabusa for a square gate option, but it lacks the ability to change your gate). Squares are the most common gate, and the pro-scene expresses a distinct bias towards them.  Rushdown/Shoto? Anything should do, so long as you can pull out quarters on it comfortably, you are good to go. The real decision is just gonna be how it feels to you. Square or Octo are both fine. (Anything by Hori/Sanwa/Semiutsu will be just fine)  Grapplers? It's all about Octo gates here man. Every grappler ever has a 360 command in their kit somewhere, and a Square gate makes it way harder to do. The key things you are looking here is a Octo gate and a minimal ""throw distance"". (I am a HUGE fan of the Semiutsu LS-32 for this, but I like to put a 2lb tension spring on it)  This is all just opinion though, and everyone likes something different. At the end of the day, the things are so customizable, that you will isolate down what you like eventually, and it'll be smooth sailing from then on out."
Skullgirls,39sorj,AshtonFaydenko,2,Sun Jun 14 16:04:17 2015 UTC,"If I was to purchase the Semiutsu LS-32, does it come with the octo gate already installed, or would I have to purchase the gate separately?

Skullgirls,39sorj,AshtonFaydenko,3,Mon Jun 15 03:49:41 2015 UTC,"You'll need to pick up an octo, should be cheap though.

By ""experimental"", I mean that you need to reconnect the stick to the console every eight minutes. Not very convenient, but as far as I know, this is the closest you can get to PS4 support on a custom PCB right now.  To be honest, I only think you need Xbox 360 support if you want to play Ultra, but that's on its way out. I'd be more interested in getting something that will work with PS4 games. It seems like quite a few developers are using the Lab Zero driver for PS3 sticks (although the implementations aren't perfect), so a Cthulhu might be the best choice."

I don't have a ton of money but when I get a stick this is what I was thinking of.  The reviews and a guy that works at an arcade near me told me it was compatible with real Sanwa parts if I ever wanted to switch out the buttons from the stock ones.
Skullgirls,39r3do,Herculefreezystar,3,Sun Jun 14 01:42:41 2015 UTC,I saw that one recommended as a good cheaper stick as well. Since I had some more spare cash I thought I would splurge a little and get a more expensive one.
Skullgirls,39r3do,grangach,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:50:58 2015 UTC,If you're doing that consider going for a more expensive ps4 stick so you can be in the current gen. Maybe a TE2 or something.

If you want to stay completely future-proof, you'll want the Hori RAP4 for ps3 and ps4 ($150 and you probably will only find it new. They're pretty in demand right now)."

If you need some guidance you can check out this video for some tips on how to use a fightstick (although this is just a starting point: you should do whatever's comfortable for you)."
Skullgirls,39r3do,AshtonFaydenko,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:38:42 2015 UTC,"I own a RAP4 and love it. I highly recommend it and would be happy to answer any questions you have about it.  The most important thing to consider when getting a stick is the type/quality of the components. Cheap sticks use generic joysticks and buttons that don't feel too good. More expensive options use arcade-grade parts made by companies like Sanwa and Semitsu. If a stick uses parts made by those companies, it's probably a good buy.  The RAP4 uses Hori's own arcade-grade components. Sanwa purists are divided on the buttons, but I haven't heard anyone say anything negative about the joystick.  For more details on arcade sticks, check out my input device guide in the beginner's FAQ."

I bought the cheap Mayfly one a year or so ago and yeah, it was fun for the novelty of it, but you can tell just by using it that it uses cheap parts.  The review I watched about the RAP4 said the stick was arcade quality, and the buttons may not be the best out there, but they are still quality and get by on their own.   I just had a birthday today and now have access to some spare money (which is hard to come by as a college student!) so I figured now was the time to get a stick that is quality and will last. Thanks for all the info! I will be purchasing the RAP4 most likely tomorrow and can't wait to get my hands on it!"

Skullgirls,39r2wg,TheRealChizz,5,Sun Jun 14 14:58:31 2015 UTC,Delay the buttons so they technically out of blockstring. When you have a good mental read on your opponent on when they pushblock you just stop right before and watch them backdash.  It's easy against people who play games like marvel 3 and bring the habit of pushblocking all the goddamn time into skullgirls.
Skullgirls,39r2wg,Snackys,2,Sun Jun 14 15:19:31 2015 UTC,Kind of like a frame trap!
Skullgirls,39r2wg,MystyrNile,2,Mon Jun 15 05:32:57 2015 UTC,"Is backdashing something you can punish, or is the reward just gained space?"
Skullgirls,39r2wg,MystyrNile,3,Mon Jun 15 05:34:01 2015 UTC,Whenever you dash backwards you aren't blocking so in that sense you are vulnerable. The reason your staggering your hits is so that when they do backdash they still get hit by you immediately.
Skullgirls,39r2wg,mongert,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:22:08 2015 UTC,"Oh right, because there's no invincibility on backdashes.  So the idea is to catch them in the first couple frames of their backdash? Before they get any distance from you?"
Skullgirls,39r2wg,MystyrNile,2,Mon Jun 15 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, you got it. You also might wanna refrain from using the same attacks over and over again because staggering your hits is punishable most of the time and opponents will catch on quickly if your staggering the same attacks over and over again."

Mainly the part about not getting hit by air show. I've actually watched that video many times and am now using it to mess with people as I know what they are looking to do now.   Most Fukua's will try and double jump up from full screen and tag me with a fireball, they get far item drops and nothing else as it's the only thing I can hit them with at that point to get them to do something else. I also play Bella and where as deflector is great, you have a lot of other options to use. Run and LnL are VERY useful at getting in. Can't tell you the number of times I've just qcf.HP my way through, when close enough, and punched Pea in the face bc a lot of Pea players don't know when to stop pushing buttons.  One thing that video doesn't prepare you for is a Pea with a good teleport game. I tend to try and rush down/mix up as much as I can using assist and teleport along with item drops.

Somebody else posted this ages ago, see if it still works:   Open a web browser with your account logged in  Open 2 tabs with the steam store  In one tab, ad any random giftable game to your cart  Click ""purchase as gift"" in that tab  In the other tab, add the gift pack to your cart and remove the filler game  In the first tab, click ""Add to Inventory"" and it'll show a 4 pack to buy that will go into your inventory."

Skullgirls,39ke4n,weealex,3,Fri Jun 12 13:17:14 2015 UTC,"The thing you have to look for vs sekhmet is her s.hp.  She can stagger her other attacks so that you can never throw her (unless you're squigly, cerebella, fukua, or beo with 3 meters)"

Skullgirls,39ke4n,StillApony,3,Sun Jun 14 18:57:06 2015 UTC,"How about advice on dealing with grab resets? Seems the only way to reliably deal with them is to memorize them (especially with paras- I mean eli- I mean characters who have fast and reliable, easy to follow up grab animations that totally don't make me salty or anything.) or just mash grab like an idiot whenever the enemy is even remotely capable of grabbing you.  Neither of which seem like good options.   *as for advice on the other things, I have some but will post it when not busy"
Skullgirls,39ke4n,Fluffy_Ducks,2,Fri Jun 12 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"Up back is a good tactic against ground grab resets(along with highs). The problem with mashing grab in hopes of a tech is that you can miss the inputs and get grabbed yourself. Another thing you can do is press a light and hit them out of their grab start up. Also, just watch for when you're getting grabbed. Chances are you're getting grabbed at around he same place/after the same chain. Ex: it's pretty common for parasols to grab after their restand or in other characters it's common to do a poke n throw tactic. If you keep an eye out for it then you can defend yourself properly at that one time and you won't have to just guess what to do the rest of the time you're defending(which can get you into some pretty bad situations, ex: the opponent can realize you're mashing and set you up for a burst bait)"
Skullgirls,39ke4n,Lepony,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:51:20 2015 UTC,"The only real way to reliably deal with grab resets is to memorize them and tech them.  The alternative on the otherhand, just hold up-back when you sense a grab reset but you don't know when. It protects you from all ground grabs+mid/high attacks. The obvious downside is that you'll be completely vulnerable to low resets or the other player reads/assumes your upback and does a thing."
Skullgirls,39ke4n,Adwins,3,Fri Jun 12 17:27:04 2015 UTC,JUMP OUT OF FUCKING DAISY PUSHER  Don't forget that Silver Chord only staggers once per combo. if you see me do it a second time...  on tears: jumping works. you just gotta do it between certain shots when there aren't any traps
Skullgirls,39ke4n,Adwins,2,Fri Jun 12 23:08:32 2015 UTC,"Ha!  I often find Daisy Pusher catches me as I'm landing, the clever sods.  And I'll make note of Silver Chord's stagger limit, but given how easy it is to miss a reset...  I'll say this for Squigly: When she creams me, it doesn't feel cheap.  The opposing Squigly's performance is enough for me to think I'm simply severely outclassed.  That, and I have a hard time keeping track of what's going on, but I think that's just me..."
Skullgirls,39ke4n,weealex,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:29:56 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I bank on the fact that people forget you can jump out of Daisy, but if you haven't used up your air actions (air dashes and double jumps), you can totally mash one or the other if she tries to catch you landing. (which makes it good against beowulf because he has literally no movement options to avoid it except upwards Wulf Blitzer)  speaking of daisy, a charged Center Stage (it turns the screen blue and freezes the screen as if it were a super) removes your opportunity to jump out of Daisy. so if you see a squigly charging dragon's breath (where she jumps around), she has meter, and she's at least 3/4 screen away, be careful about pushing buttons.  and yeah, in order to be good with squigly, one needs to understand how her moveset works from inside and out and then use that to read and react to your opponent. It takes a bit of practice because her weaknesses are very exploitable (mobility, situational everything-in-her-move-set, poor reversals without meter and/or charge)"
Skullgirls,39ke4n,weealex,4,Sat Jun 13 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"OK, Luger xx Car is easily avoidable.  Just don't get hit by the gun.  Most everyone can duck light shot, and you hold back to block.  If they're not hit-confirming the luger, car is minus a million.    All jumping attacks:  either know how to standing anti-air or jump-block it.  Check hitboxes here.  Look for something that has a higher hit box than a hurt box.  Alternatively, DP the fools.  The other option is to jump block.  If you land before they do, you're at advantage.  Parasoul zoning:  see Worldjem's video.  Same principles.  Just way easier.  Assist Band:  depends on the assist and how they use it.  Cliff's Notes answer:  counter call assists to lock out their assist calls for longer.  Be aware when they're able to call assist so you don't get blown up.  Robo Zoning:  see world jem's video  Anti-rushdown:  watch the videos on absolute guard and push block guard cancel"
Skullgirls,39ke4n,Fluffy_Ducks,2,Fri Jun 12 16:59:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input; ""Don't get hit"" always fails eventually, so I like having a way to use it to my advantage.  And yeah, most humans don't luger-spam, but the computer does it enough I like having a counter tactic.  Especially because, when solo does it to a team, it hurts a LOT.  Also, I didn't know about that link with the hitboxes.  Neato!  Looks like I want to smack Beowulf in the toes...  Counter call assists to lock out theirs?  ...huh?"
Skullgirls,39ke4n,XenophonTheAthenian,3,Fri Jun 12 20:59:47 2015 UTC,"I just tested it.  in 1.0 damage, luger into car does 3.2k damage.  My rather basic double combo does 7.3k for 1 meter.  It's just not that much damage.  Counter calling assists means you look for their assist call, then call one of yours that deals effectively with their assist.  Alternatively, just block and hit their assist.  If an assist gets hit, they can't call an assist again for longer.  I forget the exact amount of time, but it's a couple of seconds"
Skullgirls,39ke4n,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:58:12 2015 UTC,"Another thing about Luger into car, I don't really think that many double players even use it(outside of AI) because it's really not that good. Seems like a waste of meter."
Skullgirls,39ke4n,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Fri Jun 12 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"AI sure does like to spam it though, it likes to use it on me at least once every time I fight it"

It's not a great idea to practice against the AI after a certain level because they use tactics that aren't good- like Luger into car and combos that do around 1/5th of your HP. At the same time, higher levels do stuff like always tech throws so it gets you used to tactics that aren't good for fighting actual people."

Skullgirls,39ke4n,StillApony,2,Fri Jun 12 20:17:44 2015 UTC,"Against Beowulf's j.HP you can either: * Use an anti-air move (e.g. updo, napalm pillar, beat extend etc.)  Or you use a good air to air move that beats out Beowulf's j. HP, I think Fillia's j.HP beats it out."
Skullgirls,39ke4n,Nodscouter,3,Fri Jun 12 14:01:41 2015 UTC,"You're also forgetting the best option: Get as close as you can when he jumps and hit Up+Back. You'll block the aerial in mid-air, fall to the ground and immediately cancel your blockstun (Landing cancels blockstun). You can then punish Beowulf for free if he doesn't Blitzer (Or get a guaranteed punish with some Supers)."
Skullgirls,39ke4n,StillApony,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:04:11 2015 UTC,I think you can block and punish it fairly easily too. It's not really that safe.

The CS:GO subreddit seems to be a good balance of what that looks like (ie about half funny content) and nobody seems to ever mind if the conversation shifts to something else.  It would pain me if the Skullgirls sub ended up like the league one where there is this strange witch hunt mentality towards fan art.  As for the megathreads directly, I don't think they have a place on the subreddit and would rather just see the content equally in my feed.  If I really need help on a certain issue like tagging or push blocking or whatever, there is a search bar to where I can find the content that helps.

The numbers you have posted do not represent the real cause. There were three posts (that I caught) that most likely resulted in the formation of the megathread. One was the soundcloud.com link. I didn't get to hear it, because apparently chromium doesn't support flash (not my normal browser, and I've switched back) but it was tagged NSFW after a couple of hours. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but I do remember the top comment saying ""play with this for maximum lewdness"" (or something similar) with a link to the announcer clips from a r34 flash game.   Second was the NSFW Venus fanart currently in the megathread. If you didn't see it yet and are okay with gore and boobs (no nipples at least), I recommend checking it out in the current megathread, because it's a well done piece of art for so many reasons. But this really isn't the time to talk about that. I think that one that set of the ""red alert"" for the mods was this post requesting r34 for Filia. Notice that the time for this post and the ""Discussion about new rules with fanart"" thread are no more than an hour apart. Are these events related? Most likely.   There was a huge influx of new players with the steam sale: eleven days ago we had just short of seven thousand subs. I don't have numbers on this one, but I remember the average online population being about twenty to thirty. Our population has grown significantly, that much is not up for debate. More people got interested, and that made the sub more active in general. As far as a ""fanart problem,"" I really think the two NSFW things and request for more was probably the major concern.   With more new people, they have less past content to go off of as reference to what this sub is about. It's much easier to teach someone something new than to teach against what they know. More specifically, if they notice mostly ""lewd"" content, they might think that's just the norm, and it will be hard to change their mind. Would everyone think that? Probably not. But there would be people who believe it is, and they could influence what newcomers think. Being in this sub for about five months (less than many here, but still awhile), I can honestly say the request for r34 is the first one I've seen in this sub. I can't help but believe the recent (although small) NSFW posts, the crowd of new players joining us, the one post requesting something entirely out of place, the soon to be released Skullgirls 2nd Encore, and the recent filtering of art posts into one megathread are all connected.   Is this the right path to take? Maybe. As it is, it's nearly impossible to get people to start a competitive Skullgirls scene in my area. When people hear bnb in the context of Skullgirls, they think it means boobs n butts. It's not exclusive to here either. Some of the top steam reviews include ""Hard to play with one hand"", ""Its a fun game. Unless if you're near your parents."" and my personal favorite, ""More than one waifu will ruin your laifu."" People who don't play Skullgirls competitively see see it in a different light, and we run the risk of confirming it in this sub, especially with 2nd Encore on the way.  Is the megathread the right way to go? It will help the first impression of newcomers (there will be many soon). The problem is people are worried art will be seen less here, and they're probably right. Ideally, we would keep only NSFW content in a megathread. The problem is that there isn't enough NSFW content to justify it, and even if there was, requiring it's own thread would probably make people think that NSFW content is a problem here (in a way, it is). A weekly thread for all art is the best solution, as it is the easiest to enforce and keep organised.   TL;DR (even though I shortened the original post significantly): The megathread is to give us a game oriented look to people entering the sub, which Skullgirls needs.  Post script because I just thought of this: what if we make a weekly contest (after the release of Robo-Fortune) where the most popular piece of art gets to be the picture below the submit button for a week? This would show our appreciation for the communities artists and make the megathreads more popular as they give the community a say in how the sub looks, and artists will feel more appreciated."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,Scorialimit,9,Thu Jun 11 05:30:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I really couldn't have explained it better if I tried. I'm just horrible at explaining, to be frank. It's just the little things people forgets about. We want the community to be about the gameplay and art, but we just want to organize it a bit better for the newer players that are coming in. That and the reasons I've already listed so far in this and the other thread. Thank you so much for your support and understanding."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,FlatchestedMaid,0,Thu Jun 11 11:51:09 2015 UTC,"I understand your position on nsfw posts. I'm not rant crazy about them either. However, Nsfw posts and fanart are two different things. If nsfw posts are the issue, then change the rules regarding them. Don't lump in other groups into the issue. And two of the posts mentioned above aren't even fan art related.  You probably should have just created a nsfw sub (call it /r/sexyskullgirlboomboomtime ) and redirected that content there.  Clearly this change hasn't been well received.  *also speaking of other subs, when is /r/skulljerk coming out?"
Skullgirls,39dcvr,StillApony,5,Thu Jun 11 13:17:12 2015 UTC,"what if we make a weekly contest   This is a great idea, thank you for the suggestion. It's an incentive to post good art."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late to the party, but other gaming subs have a lot of weekly events/talks. Ex: the osu sub has weekly accomplishment threads where people talk about something they've accomplished in game that they're proud of. Tf2 has weapon match ups every day I believe. Of course there's aren't perfect examples of what's good for us as skullgirls is very different from both of those games and much smaller(if we had match up threads every day we'd run out pretty quickly), but it might be something to think about(I personally would enjoy something like the weekly accomplishment threads). Maybe a player of the week thing would be a cool idea too? I dunno, I'm just kind of spitballing ideas because it feels like the same content is here all the time. Not that I don't love this sub, I just think it could use some improvement."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,digitalskyfire,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds reasonable. I'll give it some thought, and we'll re-engage after the weekend."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,StillApony,13,Fri Jun 12 20:17:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly this whole rule change is silly. The vast majority of content has nothing to do with fanart, and I don't think I've ever even seen any lore discussions. Maybe the occasional ""who's this background character?""."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,DeathKidFTW,8,Thu Jun 11 00:55:12 2015 UTC,"I think this whole discussion is a little silly. There shouldn't be NSFW art on this sub. Or any NSFW content at all for that matter. If anyone comes to this sub and sees a few fan art submissions, it isn't going to scare them away or give them the wrong impression. I mean seriously, 4 posts out of the last 50? It's now suddenly a problem? I feel like this sub should be celebrating everything that is Skullgirls, and shouldn't be fracturing itself. Splitting up a small community just because you don't want to see the occasional fan art on the front page. I mean hell just look at this thread. Clearly this isn't well received."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,StillApony,2,Thu Jun 11 02:32:30 2015 UTC,"I think the mods are just being stubborn at this point. Clearly this change isn't well received. Hell, even the sticky thread has been down voted into oblivion. But they are going through it anyway because they don't want to feel silly."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,Trans_Canada_Highway,7,Thu Jun 11 13:13:28 2015 UTC,"I would just like to note that this past week has brought a lot of traffic to the subreddit. Two weeks ago, there was certainly less gameplay discussion and more fan-made works and ""funny"" content."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,StillApony,6,Thu Jun 11 00:58:46 2015 UTC,"I check this sub near daily, and I barely saw any fan art then either. Let's plays and newbie posts are much more flooded than anything else. I think the mods are making a mountain out of a molehill."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,Trans_Canada_Highway,5,Thu Jun 11 01:04:09 2015 UTC,"And I've been subbed pretty much from the beginning. I'm not going to lie and say that, for a good while, it's been anything but anemic. Free week actually brought discussion, and you really can't deny it. Can we stop circlejerking about ""the numbers"" and just get on with it, or can we get an actual explanation as to why everyone is so opposed to the rule?"
Skullgirls,39dcvr,StillApony,8,Thu Jun 11 01:13:17 2015 UTC,"can we get an actual explanation as to why everyone is so opposed to the rule?    Many of us enjoy this type of content, and feel that this is both unsubstantiated as well as, poorly thought out.   Personally, i wouldn't mind it if there was actually a good reason behind it.  Though, if we do have to have a rule change: We shouldn't be cramming things into megathreads. The problem with megathreads is that no one looks at them after a few hours, when they drop off the front page, so people will have to wait a week so they can post their fanart as soon as the thread comes up, if they want it to have a chance at actually being seen. That's more of an issue with reddit's upvote system, than something the mods did, but it's still an issue either way. And honestly, making different subreddits for different things leads to the same problem, as no one usually looks at those other subreddits.  On top of that, forcing people to move around all their posts leads to isolated communities, where people only talk about one aspect of something, and those who arent interested have nowhere to go. Some good examples of this are /r/smashbros or /r/leagueoflegends. There is almost nothing there for people who arent interested in the tourney scene because nearly everything else gets removed, which is shitty, especially in /r/smashbros as there are many more casual fans of that series, who don't care what mew2king did last night. /r/skullgirls has a big share of more casual fans too, on top of that, we already have skullheart as a hub for serious discussion and until now /r/skullgirls has been fairly good at accommodating all kinds of fans.  *edit: Some afterthoughts."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,RedArremer,3,Thu Jun 11 01:26:46 2015 UTC,"Some good examples of this are /r/smashbros[1] or /r/leagueoflegends[2] . There is almost nothing there for people who arent interested in the tourney scene because nearly everything else gets removed, which is shitty, especially in /r/smashbros[3] as there are many more casual fans of that series, who don't care what mew2king did last night.    I couldn't agree more. The best thing that ever happened to /r/leagueoflegends was the mod free week because stuff other than the esports stuff actually appeared. I'm so tired of reading professional gamer diaries and paparazzi, and I hated seeing content related to the game itself suppressed so much."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,thatgfyofanriokita,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:57:06 2015 UTC,"Firstly /r/Skullgirls will never turn into what the LoL subreddit turned into, because there's no big eSports style scene of players to go all TMZ over.   And although /r/smashbros still has posts that are just reports of which player has gone to which team,  I find that there's a decent amount of posts that are about gameplay (specifically cool highlights from tourney matches). As someone who couldn't give a shit about what, as you say, Mew2king did last night, I still find plenty of cool stuff there when I sort by top. It's even better now than before as I don't have to sort through meme garbage to get to it (Home Depot, Shrek).   However, doing the same (sorting by top) on this subreddit gets me mostly art. It would be okay if there was some kind of balance between gameplay and art posts, but there isn't. In that respect, it would be better, not worse for this place to be more like /r/smashbros."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,StillApony,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"/r/smahbros is a bit better than usual right now because smash 4 is bringing in content, in a couple months once that dies down, it will likely be back up normal."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,thatgfyofanriokita,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:57:59 2015 UTC,Are you joking? Smash 4 turned that sub into Meme Central.
Skullgirls,39dcvr,StillApony,0,Thu Jun 11 23:06:40 2015 UTC,That's what I mean. It went from nothing but e sports to e sports and something else occasionally.

Where is this magical alternate dimension you're living in, and how can I get there?  /r/smashbros is fanart, non-gameplay related bullshit central."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,StillApony,0,Thu Jun 11 18:31:02 2015 UTC,"That's why none of the posts on the first two pages are fanart, or non gameplay relayed right? (Though there are a few swaggy meme posts) If you think it's good now, wait till smash 4 is finished dying down. Pre smash 4 /r/smashbros was even more of a wasteland than ever. /r/smashcirclejerk however is a quality subreddit."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,jonmsanti,4,Thu Jun 11 20:00:35 2015 UTC,"I think because this game is rated Teen for a reason we as a community should embrace it and try our hardest to embrace 'thoughtful art' if there is such a thing. I love fanart, tell me that a large pool of players haven't played largely for the art style and I'll call you ms.informed. (ha!) I think this forum can hide thumbnails and label NSFW content and that's enough in my eyes.   As for the amount of content I think it should not be a site rule or stickied thread but taken care of on a case-by-case basis. What I mean is when this game picks up it will be bound to get new players as well as artists alike so when it becomes an overwhelming issue (which the mods will be privy of via mod-mail) a stickie thread could be made, maybe an art contest or two? Who knows. I don't think it's currently an issue though but hell what else are we doing?"
Skullgirls,39dcvr,StillApony,2,Thu Jun 11 05:04:00 2015 UTC,Ms. informed   YEEEEEEEAAAAHHHH
Skullgirls,39dcvr,jonmsanti,0,Thu Jun 11 13:20:56 2015 UTC,You love it stop frontin' :D
Skullgirls,39dcvr,Kuroonehalf,2,Thu Jun 11 14:11:45 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents: While I don't think there's currently enough fanart being posted to pose an issue, nor do I personally find that fanart is an issue in and of itself (as an artist I find it great), I am not terribly bothered by having it confined to a sticky thread either. Artists still get to share their art like normal, and it's just as accessible."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,zuxtron,2,Thu Jun 11 13:34:18 2015 UTC,"I would argue that it is NOT ""just as accessible"" when confined to a mega-thread. In the past, people just browsing the sub could stumble upon a fanart post. Now, they have to be deliberately seeking fanarts in order to find them."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,FlatchestedMaid,4,Thu Jun 11 14:08:50 2015 UTC,"We're not out to be the no-fun police. We just don't want new players going into this sub and being annoyed at the fact that they'll search and see more NSFW content and artwork than gameplay tutorials. I understand subreddits are like a portal of community information gathering, but you guys also should understand that we're also doing this to protect you guys (obviously the younger people). SkullGirls community in general is already notoriously known for being ""lewd"", I really don't want us to get to a  point when everybody just calls us out on it because all they ever see from here is NSFW fanart. I love fanart, I browse Pixiv almost weekly. But I wouldn't post every single thing I loved and straight onto here, it'd clog up the subreddit. Gameplay should be the most dominant thing here, because this is a subreddit about the game SkullGirls. As much as this isn't what you guys want, it's more about what the community needs. I know our moderation team is getting some backlash about this decision, but it's really in everybody's best interests. If you guys have a problem with the meme-threads, that's fine. We can move that too. It's not like anybody here is singling out art only. Also, if you want to say I was the condescending one, go ahead. I'll apologize for it."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,grandmasterthai,4,Thu Jun 11 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"No, no, you're not the one that was condescending, no worries. The issue that I took with the whole situation was that there seemed to be a very cavalier attitude concerning the fanart. The purpose of my post was solely to call attention to the fact that fanart isn't the real problem. Even if we count the post that disappeared earlier today, there would have only been 3 fanart posts. I understand the fear of being called out for the NSFW content, but it's nowhere near the fear you should have of being seen as a non-serious subreddit due to the amount of ""funny"" posts. I will be the first to admit, I come here for the serious content. I have little to no interest in fanart or non-serious content, which is why it bothered me that the art seemed to get singled out."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,digitalskyfire,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:34:19 2015 UTC,I love the fanart that pops up every so often. Gives me more of a reason to browse /r/skullgirls directly rather than whatever is on my main page.  Also I very much dislike mega threads.  I would much rather have the fanart as it is now.
Skullgirls,39dcvr,Livingwind,-12,Thu Jun 11 07:55:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but you're just gonna have to live with it. This is a subreddit that focuses on the actual game and how it plays, and it has always been meant to be as such. If you feel like you're not getting enough Skullgirls fanart, you can go to deviantart, tumblr, twitter, or any number of places. /r/Skullgirls is for players of the game, and we also have space for you to enjoy fanart if you want.  Gameplay is the focus, here, because that's what helps the game. It will remain the focus."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,StillApony,6,Thu Jun 11 01:01:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like you may have missed the point of the post. The point of my post wasn't ""We need more fanart AND I disagree with the new rule,"" it was ""I disagree with the new rule because there simply isn't enough fanart to justify putting it all in a megathread."" You mentioned in the modpost that you felt it was ""cluttering"" the subreddit. My point is that it didn't, but in fact, it was the least posted category of thread on the subreddit. If you want to take it in the megathread direction, you may consider megathreads for ""funny/meme"" content as well, since that focuses on the game and how it plays just as much as the fanart does.  I'm pointing out that I disagree with the new rule, and am providing reasons for this. I am absolutely not against the idea of  megathreads as a whole. I'm suggesting that if you want to keep megathreads, then make megathreads for the content that's ACTUALLY cluttering the subreddit."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,SaintKairu,5,Thu Jun 11 01:13:16 2015 UTC,"It's not about the amount of content. It's about NSFW and non-gameplay content being upvoted to the top of the sub every couple of days, and being constantly visible. Every sub on reddit has shown us that it's super easy to upvote a pic, so it's always gonna rise to the top, but it makes us look like that's what we're about; lewd fanart instead of actually playing a game.  This is not a new thing, it's been an ongoing issue from the beginning of the game's life. It's an established problem, and one myself and others are simply not willing to handle with kid gloves any longer. There is only one more influx of players coming to Skullgirls wih 2nd Encore, and we want them to stay. Fanart doesn't do that.  And we are actually going to roll funny/meme content into that megathread, for the same reason."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,Trans_Canada_Highway,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:22:30 2015 UTC,"There is plenty of non-gameplay content on the sub that isn't being cracked down on.  I hesitate to think that ""look at my new combo video"" posts really help further mechanics of the game as much as you think they do.  The community is just that, everyone brings their own thing to the table and now there is this strange precedent set that videos fringing on game play deserve their own posts but fan art doesn't."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,SaintKairu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"I also wanna say, i can only recall like 2 NSFW posts being on the front page since I've started frequenting here. Honestly though if NSFW posts are the issue, mods should just deal with them on their own.  I personally don't care for them either. However some people do, and I think they should be allowed to discuss them here if they want to, but if we can't have that then at least dont lump in other content into the issue."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,digitalskyfire,2,Thu Jun 11 01:32:23 2015 UTC,"You keep failing to address my point about the ""funny/meme"" content, which I would argue is just as obnoxious, if nor moreso. Do you not consider this to be a problem too? It's no secret that ""funny/meme"" content vastly outnumbers fanart, and funny videos get upvoted rapidly like pictures do.  Edit: Perhaps have a daily gameplay thread if you're so concerned about it, just like /r/streetfighter?  Edit 2: Nice ninja edit."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,tanbu,2,Thu Jun 11 01:28:31 2015 UTC,"it makes us look like that's what we're about   What?  No no, I mean seriously, what? I don't think any reasonable person who should be part of this community is going to assume that because there's a few fanart posts on the frontpage, that's the only thing this sub is about. That's idiotic, and assuming anybody who enters this sub to be part of the lowest common denominator of intelligence.  This sub is small, and relatively low activity. There's only so much ""gameplay discussion"" that can be had the further you get from any big update or event, and fan art is content that can and should be recognized."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,SaintKairu,4,Thu Jun 11 01:28:33 2015 UTC,"You've never been on /r/kappa, apparently."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,digitalskyfire,-1,Thu Jun 11 01:38:27 2015 UTC,"I'm at a loss for the relevance here. it's just a fighting game circlejerk sub, near as I can see."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,SaintKairu,0,Thu Jun 11 01:44:32 2015 UTC,"If you don't understand this concept, then you're clearly not aware of the FGC at large and how our community fits into it."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,digitalskyfire,4,Thu Jun 11 01:35:15 2015 UTC,"This is the exact point. I don't like to admit it, but first impressions matter.  The earliest exposure of Skullgirls I had was of this video. All I could see back then was the dedication to something I really loved seeing in games, which is 2D animation. What really struck me was the sequence starting at 1:23, where at the end Alex Ahad says ""This is like 2000 man-hours of work you're watching in 20 seconds."" It blew me away, and I was on board SG ever since.  In contrast, there's a lot of people who just do not care for SG's lore or art, especially the way some people in the community handle them. Some people will see sexualised fanart, think that the community literally circlejerks over it, and turn away. Especially if it involves a 13 year old girl."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,SaintKairu,2,Thu Jun 11 01:51:43 2015 UTC,"So we're not our own community then? You can't deny that Skullgirls has an incredibly appealing style for fanart, much more so than, say, Street Fighter.  Besides, to each FGC their own. Street Fighter has less so fanart, more gifs/webms of pros. Following your logic, /r/streetfighter must be solely based around pro play and not low level play."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,tanbu,-4,Thu Jun 11 01:43:47 2015 UTC,"No, based on that logic, /r/StreeFighter would be based around gameplay. Which it is.  And my concern is helping /r/Skullgirls, a sub that is intrinsically linked to the health of Skullgirls the game. Fanart does not help the health of the player community, simple as that. I look at tons of Skullgirls fanart... on sites that are about that."
Skullgirls,39dcvr,SaintKairu,2,Thu Jun 11 01:47:52 2015 UTC,"Reddit is a link aggregator, a content aggregator. If anything, reddit is more appropriate for fanart than it is discussion, because that's its purpose. So don't argue what reddit is about.  So would you rather we post gifs/webms of combos? Because those barely foster discussion as well. What do they bring to the table to discuss? ""Nice combo!"" But that's okay content to you because it is gameplay?"
Skullgirls,39dcvr,tanbu,-2,Thu Jun 11 01:54:10 2015 UTC,Watching a combo video directly translates to how a person plays the game. Any one of the 50 hits in a combo can help a player devise new tech or learn about a mixup situation.  The fact that you don't understand the inherent value of a combo video says a lot.
Skullgirls,39dcvr,SaintKairu,4,Thu Jun 11 01:59:03 2015 UTC,It's a shitty kind of community that refuses to support artwork just as much as gameplay itself. The posts aren't nearly common enough to drown out gameplay discussion. This reaction would only be justifiable if they really were.
Skullgirls,39fsw6,cerzi,8,Thu Jun 11 12:54:23 2015 UTC,"Muscle memory will be different obviously, but you can still learn the base game and get a better understanding of it. This way you can focus on perfecting your bnbs when you're stick is here instead of slogging through everything at once. Personally though I have no problem transitioning combos between the two, just minor things like assists and certain motion inputs get me."
Skullgirls,39fsw6,drfurry,2,Thu Jun 11 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"You'll have to relearn combos, but you can get the hang of the game mechanics: blocking, movement, assist calling, etc. while you wait."
Skullgirls,39fsw6,tylertks,0,Thu Jun 11 21:43:26 2015 UTC,This will seem weird.   But I say use a keyboard.   The controls will transition well. You'll have the combos memorized more so. Muscle memory and what not.   Edit : You'll be used to the 2x3 button layout right when you get it.

Skullgirls,39cp9s,Tho76,14,Wed Jun 10 21:47:53 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing. Skullgirls is often praised as one of the best games for those who are new to the genre. It has great tutorials and is fairly beginner friendly as traditional fighters go. It was the first one for me too.  That being said, the very nature of the genre, is difficult to learn, harder to master. Five minutes isn't going to teach you anything. And even the tutorials will take some practice.  Don't be discouraged though, it took me ages to do them as well. If I were you, id just try to get as far as you can with them, then do some messing around. And then come back to them later after some practice.  Maybe play through the stories on easy mode, and by all means if you have a friend who's into the genre, open a training lobby with them, mess around with some characters and get them to show you the ropes. Or you can always add people from here. My steam ID is in my flair (Though I'm a bit busy lately with real life stuff so I don't think I can help much.) and I'm sure more people will volunteer to help.  The real payoff comes later. There is nothing like a round between two experienced and well matched players. And you get a real sense of improvement that other genres usually don't provide."
Skullgirls,39cp9s,StillApony,2,Wed Jun 10 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip about the new players meeting up, I might do that.  I played some more, and got okay at some tutorial combos except the air combo one...which never seemed to work, even if I landed it...  But the game seems fun, thanks for the answer"
Skullgirls,39cp9s,digitalskyfire,9,Thu Jun 11 00:08:53 2015 UTC,"Most people don't like actually fighting games, and they'll basically just play the story mode and drop it once there's no more story or eye candy to motivate them. That's how it goes. Not everybody has the right frame of mind to enjoy fighters, and there's nothing wrong with that. Fighters require both patience and practice, and do not yield as much, ""fun,"" in the first few hours as some other genres like shooters or platformers.  If you don't like it, and you don't feel like you even want to like it, don't play it."
Skullgirls,39cp9s,FluffyHuffy,3,Wed Jun 10 22:01:41 2015 UTC,"Skullgirls was basically my first fighting game and now I have over 400 hours on it. I'd say it's worth it, it's really fun when you know what you're doing.  BUT, if you want to get good and actually have fun, you'll have to play and train a lot, so keep that in mind."
Skullgirls,39cp9s,FluffyHuffy,2,Wed Jun 10 22:02:05 2015 UTC,"I have no problem training. I was top 100 in Brawl type game called Brawlhalla, and still near the top. I train for that, nbd.  How long would you say it took to pick up? Also, I when I learned Dota 2, I still had fun while I was learning the game. Did you just get comboed endlessly early on, or were you put with fellow noobs?"
Skullgirls,39cp9s,Kuroonehalf,4,Wed Jun 10 22:04:31 2015 UTC,"It's alright with noobs but with good people it's not fun, at all. I had no idea what to do against resets and it gives you the impression that you're being combo'd to death. (Here's a video on that by the way)  But, there's a weekly event that gets posted here often just for new players and there are groups on steam and stuff like that, so finding players at your skill level shouldn't be a problem"
Skullgirls,39cp9s,TheBigBruce,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:09:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah nowadays there's tons of groups for new folks to focus practice without having to go into the wild and face experienced players. Couldn't have picked a better time to join, from that standpoint. :p"
Skullgirls,39cp9s,Spieren,3,Thu Jun 11 14:21:56 2015 UTC,"Would you like to play more fighters someday? If so, then it's great, regardless of skill level. People who play fighting games do so because their skills carry from game to game within the genre. Your time spent in SG will help you in other titles once SG falls by the wayside, or you grow tired of it.  If you just want to play Skullgirls and only Skullgirls, then it depends on how much time you feel you would put into it."
Skullgirls,39cp9s,me-tan,2,Wed Jun 10 22:02:33 2015 UTC,"If you played fighting games before, it definitely helps. But SG is indeed a great entry to the genre, it teaches you a lot of basics.  Skullgirls is a pretty fast fighting game though, and can be very confusing for beginners sometimes."
Skullgirls,39cp9s,CisseV,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:13:20 2015 UTC,"I would suggest avoiding the online play to start with. Do the tutorials to get the basics. Play though the story modes and work out what character suits you best, start focusing on that character and start learning simple combos for it, then sign up for get-good and go from there!"

Skullgirls,39btuf,FlatchestedMaid,11,Wed Jun 10 18:30:53 2015 UTC,"The post was labeled nsfw.   This is exactly what labeling nsfw is for.   It's up to the adolescent to make the moral decision to view it or not.   They know if they are supposed to or not. We aren't their parents, why are we holding their hands?  Either state that nsfw posts are NOT allowed in the rules of the sidebar, or allow the posts that it seems you allow."
Skullgirls,39btuf,ThunderCuntVI,3,Wed Jun 10 22:03:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. ""Think of the children"" is always, always suspect. It can be used to shoehorn in virtually any rule, and I'm surprised to see it being used on an internet forum."
Skullgirls,39btuf,RedArremer,2,Thu Jun 11 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the Venus post?   If yes, I agree."
Skullgirls,39btuf,Trestanray,8,Wed Jun 10 22:06:57 2015 UTC,Make it weekly imo
Skullgirls,39btuf,TronIsMyCat,3,Wed Jun 10 19:48:42 2015 UTC,I second this. Separating it into a controlled thread is a great idea but people do still like the fanart.
Skullgirls,39btuf,ibbolia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"I'm open to that, but what's the benefit of weekly over monthly?"
Skullgirls,39btuf,digitalskyfire,5,Wed Jun 10 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"I don't have much past speculation to back this up, but weekly threads seem more likely to promote conversation. If a new person sees a post where not a single comment at the top is less than a week or two old, they may get the false impression that a thread is dead. Plus, longer lasting threads seem like they'd be more difficult to maintain over time as the comment count goes up."
Skullgirls,39btuf,ibbolia,4,Wed Jun 10 19:57:04 2015 UTC,"We'll try a weekly, then."
Skullgirls,39btuf,digitalskyfire,5,Wed Jun 10 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"Because reddit sucks and monthly threads make no sense. Anyway that it gets traction after more than a week would have to be through a sticky, which would be silly because how long should it stay up for? Weekly thread could get stickied the day it's posted and then bumped off the next. Fanart folks are a sizeable part of this sub (obv) so might as well give them that."
Skullgirls,39btuf,TronIsMyCat,14,Wed Jun 10 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"A bigger problem is that Venus thread's disappearance. Where did it go? I can't see it scrolling past four pages. Good thing it is still in my history: Intense picture of Venus Lovelace by idlecom [NSFW?]  Why was it sent to Gehenna? It was labeled NSFW so I think it should stay like a normal submission.  You complain of art cluttering the subreddit, but I don't think the general consensus agrees. Compared to other submissions, fan art posts are the most upvoted (average gameplay post barely breaks double digits).   I drawed a thing. score: 35 Minette and Ms.Fortune by Agawa Ryou score: 152 A friend told me he was drawing ""cute anime girls with guns."" I took this as a challenge. score: 99 I got bored after taking one of my finals, so I sketched up Filia and Samson. score: 49 Squigly by BrendanCorris score: 115   Minus an off-model drawing of Peacock that got a low score, that's almost all the artwork from the last two weeks. Fairly outnumbered by gameplay discussions. So I don't see the ""too many fanarts"" issue."
Skullgirls,39btuf,BallotBoxer,11,Wed Jun 10 19:32:05 2015 UTC,"Fanart is easy for a lot of users to digest. Upvote and move on. Gameplay discussion threads, while relevant and useful, may not pertain to every player. Eliza tips? Might not get votes from players who aren't interested in the character. ""What's the secret to consistently doing X?"" Might be something in the beginner FAQ already, or not worthy of lengthy discussion. A lot of Skullgirls fanart exists, and I don't agree with having every single piece of fanart someone decides to submit being it's own thread, as there isn't much to discuss about it. Unless you just want to comment on thick thighs, etc. Seriously, look at the thirst in the threads you've posted, there are even references to a Skullgirls R34 subreddit."
Skullgirls,39btuf,Trans_Canada_Highway,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:53:41 2015 UTC,"But this subreddit was made to discuss about the gameplay, not the artwork. I guess you could say that this should be about everything SG related, but then where and when will we draw the line? I feel like a subreddit about a game should contain mostly gameplay related content. Most other FG subs are like that as well. If we have too much fanart, we might as well call this /r/SkullGirlsFanart. As for the Venus thread, I'd have to check it when I am at home. I am at work atm. Also if it is obviously unsafe, I could see why it was removed."
Skullgirls,39btuf,Nodscouter,10,Wed Jun 10 19:45:57 2015 UTC,"As much as I don't have a general opinion on how to deal with fan art (or conversely, how not to deal with it). The ''slippery slope fallacy'' is one we're all familiar with and one that's quite ridiculous in general. Let me make one to demonstrate: If we ban fanart, then what's stopping us from banning everything else that's not just gameplay tips? Might as well just call us /r/howtodealwitheliza.   There's a point to be made that it's a fighting game and should contain things related to fighting, but in comparison to for example Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, there's a huge contingent of people (Sometimes known as ''Skullfans'') who are interested in the characters, the art, the music etc because quite frankly, the aesthetic and generally non-gameplay side of Skullgirls is fantastic as well. I personally find it odd to just rule out that entire side of the subreddit for no better reason than that you feel like it. It'd be like if r/UnitedKingdom suddenly decided that all content by users living north of London was to be banned."
Skullgirls,39btuf,Trans_Canada_Highway,4,Wed Jun 10 20:09:19 2015 UTC,"You may be familiar with the ""slippery slope"" fallacy, but are you aware of the ""straw man argument""?"
Skullgirls,39btuf,Nodscouter,5,Wed Jun 10 20:52:30 2015 UTC,"But that's exactly what I'm protesting. It's not a huge change, barely any change at all in general considering how little fan art we get anyway, but it simply seems like it's not based on much. This ''Flood of fan art'' simply doesn't exist. If anything is swarming the subreddit it's newbie posts, or Let's Plays. So from what I've been seeing as someone who checks the subreddit every day, the ''fan art straw man'' is, well, unsubstantiated at best.  Once again it really doesn't matter overall. It just seems like this is built on shaky ground."
Skullgirls,39btuf,digitalskyfire,2,Wed Jun 10 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"Good thing nobody's banning fanart, then."
Skullgirls,39btuf,cantinera,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:17:25 2015 UTC,"""Might as well just call us /r/howtodealwitheliza.""   Don't even joke about this. This isn't funny. You're not funny."
Skullgirls,39btuf,StillApony,0,Thu Jun 11 10:45:28 2015 UTC,On an unrelated note: I'm kind of dissapointed that /r/howtodealwitheliza doesn't exist.
Skullgirls,39btuf,Nodscouter,0,Thu Jun 11 01:37:29 2015 UTC,Never too late to make it?
Skullgirls,39btuf,BallotBoxer,3,Thu Jun 11 06:45:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like a subreddit about a game should contain mostly gameplay related content.   Agreed. And it already is. Fan art is a minority, about 10%, if generous, of the posts here.  I also agree with a round-up if fan art starts appearing in a greater frequency or in lesser quality.   This is a subjective, gray area, but I think only worthy art pieces should be posted (like that superb Venus that was shot down). Pencil sketches, doodles, and other quick or unfinished work don't deserve a thread. Most comments will be ""Can't wait to see what it looks like when it is done!"" or ""Good job. Keep practicing."" I know I sound like an elitist jerk, but I don't think a bad drawing, like a wonky Valentine with the eyepatch on the wrong eye, is worth the space."
Skullgirls,39btuf,gallifreyan_pleb,6,Wed Jun 10 20:59:52 2015 UTC,"I'm of two minds about this: gameplay threads are bound to get less upvotes by their nature, but no one wants this subreddit to go the route that so many have went, with every post being an image link fishing for upvotes.    I'd say make a weekly fanart thread for artists to do more than just say ""I did a thing"" and actually interact and maybe work together. It's important to remember that the fanbase of this game has a huge component of people that care a lot about the art and lore, more so than any other fg I'd say, so this should be represented. On the other hand, I'd say ban only images representing sexual intercourse or other things that might not be suitable to a younger audience, and just enforce a nsfw tags on anything else that is ""risky""....the game itself doesn't shy away from sexy images and suggestive poses and behaviours, why should we?"
Skullgirls,39btuf,Dalextable,6,Wed Jun 10 20:49:49 2015 UTC,Its not hard to see gameplay posts at all...
Skullgirls,39btuf,StillApony,4,Wed Jun 10 22:22:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine as is. The subreddit has a healthy amount of gameplay content, fanart, sales information/other, etc.   There really isn't too much of anything, and please for the love of God don't turn this sub into another /r/smashbros. (Literally nothing but swaggy combo gifs, tourney player worship, other tournament discussion and ""how to do X/is X a good technique"" posts. Then the rare relevant news post once a month, which is the only reason I'm Subscribed.)  The only real issue I can see is nsfw stuff. I think ""deviant art"" rules are good for this sub. (Mild nsfw stuff is okay as long as it's labelled. Nothing extreme.)"
Skullgirls,39btuf,RarelyKnownAs,3,Wed Jun 10 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"While I don't see this as clutter, I'm fine with this decision. I wanted something similar for the subreddit that I was a mod of before I demodded myself because reasons. I like this though."
Skullgirls,39btuf,KidPanda,2,Wed Jun 10 20:29:14 2015 UTC,Keep it lewd and rude! after being away from the community for a while. its nice to see how much its grown. ggs everyone. see ya on the webs.
Skullgirls,39btuf,Diztance,2,Wed Jun 10 21:51:56 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't see this sub as active enough to warrant excluding SG content of any kind.
Skullgirls,39btuf,RedArremer,2,Thu Jun 11 17:25:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen it mentioned (maybe I'm just blind), but have we considered just requiring image posts to be self posts to reduce the incentive for karma fishing?   Might that stem the tide enough to allow fanart posts outside of a weekly/monthly megathread?"
Skullgirls,39btuf,Prime1153,3,Thu Jun 11 20:43:32 2015 UTC,"This is the direction I want the subreddit to go in. Personally, I have always been more interested in the gameplay than the art and lore, and I'm excited to see what happens when we get an influx of new members from Second Encore. Gameplay-related content is what really fuels and engages a community. Since the Steam sale, there have been way more discussions here than usual. Most people just vote on art posts and move on without commenting. The intense picture posted earlier (you all know which one) got thirty-three votes, but just seven comments. Since none of the comments were replies, there was no actual discussion taking place.  On the topic of art submissions, Skullgirls is rated T, and two of the reasons for that rating are violence and partial nudity. The content on the subreddit should not exceed that rating, meaning that R34 is out of the question. However, visitors should be expected to know that some of the T-rated content on here is NSFW. It looks like this is the policy in the art thread, and I think it's the right call."
Skullgirls,39btuf,AshtonFaydenko,4,Thu Jun 11 00:08:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for doing this Mods! Makes my experience on this sub waaaaay better. I love this game and it's community, but I don't really like the whole pornographic side of it (but hey, to each his own, right?). This is a good way of separating that, so that the only people seeing it are those that want to."
Skullgirls,39btuf,BallotBoxer,3,Thu Jun 11 01:08:41 2015 UTC,"Here's the issue, folks:   Skullgirls is a fighting game. The health of this fighting game is not helped by fanart or r34, but by player participation. This being the case, to make sure we're doing everything we can to strengthen our game's community, we're trying to make gameplay the focus.   We're going with the monthly art threads because they help us achieve this goal without restricting anyone's freedom to post art. Past that, we're putting a full stop to any r34 because, frankly, it's incredibly harmful to the image of the community.  I'm sorry if you don't agree with this move, but it's one we feel needs to be made. 2nd Encore will be here before you know it, and we need to be ready to receive and nurture a new wave of players."
Skullgirls,39btuf,digitalskyfire,10,Wed Jun 10 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"I agree on strengthening the player base and sweeping that r34 stuff in the shadows where it belongs (I want to preserve Skullgirls as presentable, as it already is. Not some non-canon, harmful mutation in someone's mind). But I still think a fan art round up is an overreaction. One in fifteen posts is a fan art post.  I would agree with restrictions if the subreddit was being flooded with mediocre art, but it is only a few blips on the radar. Tiny islands of great visuals in a sea of text.   Tell me how is it fair that a vividly-amazing piece of art like that Venus post gets banished, yet some screencap of some shitpost stays? If that Venus post broke the rules and didn't put on a NSFW tag, then fine, slap 'em with whatver punishment deemed fair, but if you want to crackdown on things getting in the way of gameplay, send the trash trucks after the fluff first.  I'm fine with art round-ups if they become too frequent, but right now it seems like a disproportionate reaction on par with Skullheart freaking out about Off Topic."
Skullgirls,39btuf,BallotBoxer,3,Wed Jun 10 20:38:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not without sympathy for your position, but the simple fact of the matter is that people can still post all the art they want, they just have to use the allocated space. I find it hard to call this an overreaction when it's almost literally the smallest change we could have made.  We're going to be taking a look at shitposts soon, don't worry."
Skullgirls,39btuf,remeD,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:43:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I'll give it a try. The way reddit keeps streaming posts through, having a place to collect the art might be good to get more people to see it. Besides, I went through and looked at recent art threads and no one really comments anything substantial inside.  Who knows, maybe the change will work out so the subreddit becomes a welcome mat for general gameplay and all the more in-depth art and lore will always be at Skullheart."
Skullgirls,39btuf,Rafer45,3,Thu Jun 11 03:24:08 2015 UTC,"Make sure you don't count out the non-player fans as potential players in the future (or even lapsed players who may want to come back). I'm not saying ""cater the subreddit to them,"" just make sure you know they're present in the bigger picture. Personally? I sucked, lapsed, played Injustice for a while, stumbled across some Skullgirls porn, managed to remember that the only thing I didn't like about the game was that I sucked at it, and decided to re-download. Plus, I'm less-terrible now and I convinced a few friends to pick the game up during the last steam sale. Not every case, sure... but I'd like to imagine that this isn't the thing that makes me a special little snowflake. If nothing else, let me dream; but you have to admit that the music, the characters, and the art style are all very appealing in their own right, and there should be some space for that in the general game's subreddit.  Anyways. Super-relevant ""two cents"" coming right up:  • /r/Skullgirls with a focus on gameplay, and a healthy (read: present in some sense; not-uncommon) amount of art and/or other fan-made things.   • Porn goes into /r/SGRule34, ""which we all just learned exists today."""
Skullgirls,39eg9f,Nathanyal,3,Thu Jun 11 04:45:06 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure all previously released DLC will be included in 2nd Encore.
Skullgirls,39eg9f,Nox_Alchemist,2,Thu Jun 11 04:51:11 2015 UTC,This is the case. All content ever released for Skullgirls will be part of 2nd Encore.
Skullgirls,39eg9f,digitalskyfire,2,Thu Jun 11 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"And the colors in particular that he's wondering about will be in Robo Fortune's patch, which isn't 2nd Encore-exclusive."
Skullgirls,39aa5e,TheBigBruce,2,Wed Jun 10 11:22:42 2015 UTC,"Looks great, but the last throw could be broken, correct?"
Skullgirls,39aa5e,Ontrevant,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:23:50 2015 UTC,Isn't that a tag and not a throw?
Skullgirls,39aa5e,Dalextable,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:34:19 2015 UTC,I just saw the ips green cloud on the final hit's contact is why i asked. It's also why when combo train i have it set to break on 1st hit to simulate a good player. <3
Skullgirls,39aa5e,Ontrevant,5,Wed Jun 10 16:41:42 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the damage is done at the same time IPS can be triggered, so even if they're mashing, you already got the KO and they can't do anything.  I won't be able to test that though because my Painwheel is absolute garbage."
Skullgirls,39aa5e,Scorialimit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:49:43 2015 UTC,"I thought about training Painwheel, but I'm currently frustrating myself with Eliza's c.HP - j.Mp - j.Hp - adc j.Lk - j.Mp - j.Hp. just can't seem to.find the timing for them to be restood when the last j.Hp hits.   The only other question i have is how easy it it to gather 5 bars in a match?"
Skullgirls,39aa5e,Ontrevant,2,Wed Jun 10 17:17:24 2015 UTC,"There's no special timing needed for that restand, just fyi. I do it front to back without any delays the moment she leaves the ground, and I always get it."
Skullgirls,39aa5e,digitalskyfire,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"It seems that the timing eludes me. I got it once, and having been going crazy trying to get it again.  Edit- normally it finishes in the air for me, which leads me to I'm off on the timing.  Double edit ~ I just thought of something. Does it matter if you macro air dash or double tap air dash?"
Skullgirls,39aa5e,Ontrevant,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"Nah, I just hit the first j.MP as soon as possible, and then do everything after that ASAP, and I get enough time to get my first grounded normal after the second j.HP."
Skullgirls,39aa5e,digitalskyfire,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:39:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on the character. Ms. Fortune builds a ton and only uses air super in neutral, but Squigly tends to disappoint compared to how much she uses it for all her Lv.1s  I'm not sure how good Painwheel's meter build and use is though. In 3v3 I think you'll be getting a lot of meter anyways, but I tend to play solos and duos so I can't say from experience.  Ninja edit: also, no experience with Eliza, but experiment with timings and you should get the hang of it. Sometimes you need to delay a second and sometimes it's a really small frame window."
Skullgirls,39aa5e,Scorialimit,2,Wed Jun 10 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"Sometimes that's not the best thing to do. More often than not, breaking in the first hit of an IPS/Undizzy burst against a good player will get you punished, as there are setups to force a burst if you're just mashing. So, breaking the first hit is usually bad unless you know you're safe, like if you see they're continuing a combo when they didn't expect to trigger IPS or Undizzy. There are even some setups that involve baiting bursts on the second or third hit.   That being said, leaving the training dummy to burst on the first hit lets you work out burst bait setups, but don't think bursting on the first hit is indicative of a ""good player."""
Skullgirls,39aa5e,Trans_Canada_Highway,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:17:42 2015 UTC,"I like having the buffer so when i do get online i don't get ahead if myself. So maybe not a ""good player"" but someone who knows what's up."

Skullgirls,39a9dt,Thatsanunu,3,Wed Jun 10 11:14:08 2015 UTC,"Cerebella main here.  I'm not sure if it's because I haven't learnt to properly fight against it but i always have a hard time with rushdown techniques, especially if it's something like a Fillia constantly j.hp were you can't get a good grab on them and have to push-block, you could probably do something similar with Fukua's j.hk.  Also, Cerebella has only one overhead and that's the second hit from her s.hk which is very easy to spot and can only combo into some special moves.  As for Beowulf he can be tricky, for his leaping grab (QCF lk,lp) i believe it can be counter grabbed(?) and is easily spotted. as for his dash i'm not quite sure, he has quite the easy mix up with that. best advice i can give for this is to watch for him dashing to get close and block high then low.  As for grabs most of them can be dodged by simply jumping, when to jump is up to the person you're up against, look for patterns, when they grab. When a Cerebella doesn't push block usually they're looking for a grab. (This doesn't apply to Cerebella's anti-air grab)"
Skullgirls,39a9dt,justicetree,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:54:56 2015 UTC,"Ill try jumping more and see how that plays out, I usually try and spam low attacks when im stuck in a corner which is actually probably making it worse. What is a push-block?"
Skullgirls,39a9dt,justicetree,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:09:47 2015 UTC,When the enemy is attacking you while you're blocking you can press 2 punch buttons to push them away. If you push block while an enemy is doing a multi-hit attack (Cerecoptor) it will not push them back while the move is still happening.
Skullgirls,39a9dt,justicetree,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:40:02 2015 UTC,"Is there a cool down on it? or can you use it at any time, between hits?"
Skullgirls,39a9dt,MnemonicJohnny,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:35:05 2015 UTC,"There is a slight cooldown on it, and you are very vulnerable if you do it incorrectly, but in my experience it's very rare for it to be an issue since they are usually still doing the move.  I believe there is a tutorial on this if you wan't a good demonstration."
Skullgirls,39a9dt,Kuroonehalf,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:35:02 2015 UTC,Something ill definitely look into. Thanks a ton.
Skullgirls,39a9dt,RadagastTheBrownie,3,Thu Jun 11 10:56:59 2015 UTC,"I can only really talk about Cere, but one of the things that you need to understand about those command grabs and armored moves is that each one is a bit of a gamble for Cere.  Sweeps/grabs beat out armor, and simply jumping beats most grabs (except Excellabella, which is a different story.)  Try to watch who you're playing against, see what they like to do in certain situations, and base your game around anticipating and countering the big, slow moves.  Also, when you're playing as Squigly or Eliza, remember that Cere wants to get up in your face.  If you can, don't let her - both Eliza and Squigly work well when they can keep their enemies just out of reach with their long-range normals and specials."
Skullgirls,39a9dt,RadagastTheBrownie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:03:55 2015 UTC,"If you can, don't let her - both Eliza and Squigly work well when they can keep their enemies just out of reach with their long-range normals and specials.   I highly advise against this actually, especially with Eliza, since her long range moves are all single hits. The armor on Bella and Beo's moves will eat your pokes free.  Squigs I don't have much experience with, but as Eliza try to mess around with Sekhmet MP release. That thing shreds armor."
Skullgirls,39a9dt,shadowdude777,2,Thu Jun 11 14:25:03 2015 UTC,"Eliza/Bella player here, who's run into enough Beowulfs online I should have some advice, somewhere...   Eliza has a fantastic air-grab which slams the opponent into the corner.  See if you can use this to counter some of Bella's airgame.  Might not work as well against Beowulf due to his chair, but worth a shot. DON'T try punching if it looks like you'll be grabbed.  You'll just be grabbed by your own fist.  Eliza has fantastic reach, but this also means she can be hit from almost anywhere.  (This is part of why I've started picking up Parasoul... stupid sexy disjointed hitboxes.) Calling Horus against a jHP spamming Beowulf is tempting.  DON'T DO IT.  You'll get smacked before birdie has a chance to come out.  Unfortunately, I don't have a good counter-tactic for your team (I typically call Cerebella against Wulf).  Maybe try crossing under?  Word of warning, Eliza's boat can be hit and interrupted from above. Squigly always messes me up, especially her jMK (the spinning move?).  Her extended ""Get over here"" grab also hurts me a lot. You may want to double-check me on this, but I think you can grab armor?  Might be handy against Beo-Arm.   Here's the biggest thing I've found so far: assists can't be grabbed.  So, they can be used to cover your approach, especially if they have armor.  Also, please for the love of god don't Fukua jHK spam, it's so annoying.  [Edit] Also, projectiles!  A big part of why I'm picking up Robo Fortune.  Can't be grabbed by a glowing ball of hurt!"
Skullgirls,39a9dt,Spieren,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:48:54 2015 UTC,I might need to use assists more. I currently dont use them much in fear my whole team will get combo'd together. From what a few people have said i might want to pick up Bella to use against Beo.
Skullgirls,39a9dt,Navy_Pheonix,2,Wed Jun 10 21:14:42 2015 UTC,"Play the team you want to play; I'd hate to see someone pressured out of characters he likes due to characters other people like.    Squigly is freakishly powerful in the right hands, has really fast lights, and Silver Chord has all sorts of utility.  Likewise, Center Stage can mess with the opponents spacing, which can be really powerful against grapplers.  Might be a good assist.  Eliza is powerful and has good range.  I need to go into training to see where she can avoid being hit, but jLK seems to work pretty well if you're careful.  Funnily enough, I've yet to find a good assist for her; I've tried Dive of Horus and Osiris Spiral, but they tend to get interrupted.  Fukua is really fast, aggressive, and annoyingly powerful.  If you really, really like her, use her.  Also, fireballs.  Burn the wolf!"
Skullgirls,39b822,WirSindAllein,3,Wed Jun 10 16:06:33 2015 UTC,"The combo in that guide isn't really the best you can have right now. Instead of that, I would recommend working towards a more up to date combo like this one:  c.lk, c.mk(1 hit), c.hp,  j.hp xx H Air Savage Bypass,  M Air Savage Bypass,  air dash, j.mp(2 hits), j.hk,  rejump, j.lp, j.mp(3 hits), j.hk, adc, j.mk, j.hk*,  dash, s.lpx3, s.mpx2, c.mk, s.hkx3 xx otg H Savage Bypass xx EKG Flatliner.  Which you can watch a video of here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs5uAN5qPbg.  Because this combo might take a bit of time to get used to, I'd make sure you have an easy backup combo that you feel comfortable with.  Anyhow, both combos do the c.HP into j.HP, and it is a pretty standard link for Val. Because of how wide the arc on the heavy punch is, you do not actually need to jump forward into them, so instead of jumping up and moving forward, just jump up and heavy punch as soon as you can do so. I used to have problems with dead crossing too, but that fixed it, so it should work for you.   Finally, the big ""secret"" to teching grabs is knowing when they are going to come. Points in a combo where someone will want to grab reset you become a lot more obvious the more you play the game.  If you have any more questions about Valentine or the game in general you can add me here: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043203001/"
Skullgirls,39b822,Dalextable,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:29:51 2015 UTC,"Does the h savage bypass make a big difference? I've been doing  m bypass > l bypass (because someone didn't put notation on their video.) and finding the combo pretty unreliable, especially since timing differs a lot between characters. Does the h bypass make it more consistent, or does it not really matter?"
Skullgirls,39b822,StillApony,3,Wed Jun 10 16:56:43 2015 UTC,"All of the bypasses move you different distances related to your opponent. L bypass might be messing with it, and the combo will do a fair amount less damage if you use that instead of heavy."
Skullgirls,39b822,Dalextable,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:02:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I thought doing H didn't work, but I probably just did it too slowly. I'll have to test it a little tonight and see if it helps at all...   The main problem I was having was that doing the light bypass too early on most light characters would cause valentine to whiff, adding more timing issues to an already timing intensive combo."
Skullgirls,39b822,StillApony,2,Wed Jun 10 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"The reason you get dead cross is because ou quarter circle forward to jump. As a pad player I tap up after. Also to predict grabs be looking for them when you are on wakeup, since they are slightly easier to react to than lows. If you ate in neutral if they whiff attacks that dont push them back they could be trying for one so be ready."
Skullgirls,39b822,7upjawa,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:22:58 2015 UTC,"Try j.MP instead after c.HP and then lead into j.HK. You can also cancel into Val's air dash and to j.MP and j.HK again. j.MP comes out faster and is less likely to be blocked if you're going to delay the attack.  In terms of the Dead Cross problem, that's likely a result of the 360 controller. The D-Pad isn't really the best and neither is the analog stick. It's totally possible to make it work though, it'll just come with practice. It used to happen a lot to me too."
Skullgirls,39b822,LOTO-12,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"I used to have that dead cross problem as well when i was using the 360 controller. The controller would misread the change from down to forward jump as a qcf motion if you pressed even slightly in the down forward direction. But you can get around it on the 360 by just being very careful not to hit down forward when you jump.  Haven't had that issue (and most other 360 pad issues) since switching to ds4. The second biggest issue I had with the 360 pad was that, I found the stick (used the stick because the d pad was terrible.) had a hard time reading between crouching and crouch blocking, which, though it can be fixed by just being very careful with your inputs, was very annoying in the heat of Battle, when your precision will likely not be perfect.   Would definitely recommend the DS4 over the other controller options to anyone who isn't willing to shell out for an arcade stick. It's the best controller out right now for sure."
Skullgirls,39b822,StillApony,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:30:53 2015 UTC,"On the subject of grabs. Don't try to tech. Hold Up+Back. Teching should be reserved for air-grab setups only, or certain assist setups involving throws."
Skullgirls,39aogd,j0eymeister,5,Wed Jun 10 13:41:12 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for events, I'll go ahead and say the stuff we always say to beginners:  First: Every week on sundays, /u/Prime1153 and his menagerie of commentators run an event called Get Good, where you sign up, you get to play 3 matches against someone of equal skill and in the same region as you and while you're playing, the commentators discuss what you could be doing better, what you're doing well and what could be improved upon. There's a specific subset of the event specifically for European players. Matches are streamed here and signups are posted on the subreddit a few days in advance of the event as well as on the steam group. The stream group itself is a great way to find other people of your skill level to play with.  Second: I Wanna Be The Skullgirl. Each saturday, /u/cantinera and her co-commentator /u/GhettoThrasher streams a tournament for newbies, previously called ''Newbie Night'', commentates it as well as broadcasts a few instructional videos to allow people to learn from more experienced players. They also usually have a more experienced player as a guest commentator who helps to give more advanced and in-depth feedback. While a tournament might sound a bit competitive, it's all very newbie-friendly. Unfortunately due to the smaller size of IWBTS you might not find European matches here. Main thread is here and the stream is here.  Third, we have Skullgirls slapfest. Slapfest is usually less instructional-focused than the two events above and is more aimed towards getting a lobby and a chat going and playing friendlies. The players are very willing to help you out though and the on-going commentary, while more casual, can be incredibly helpful. Steam group is here and some matches are streamed here.  Fourth, we have the Skillgrills Weekly Tournaments group. Though officially a tournament for all players regardless of skill level, we have quite a few beginners coming around. It's also streamed by /u/Catfish_Maw and I, and we've lately been moving towards more serious and instructional commentary like the events above. Your matches will be streamed and we will commentate them, and like all other stream events, just being able to see yourself play without the heat of the moment is a great way to learn. Every friday, streamed here with the steam group here."

Skullgirls,398g4h,StarPolaris,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"Big Band - many of his moves are unsafe (beat extend, brass knuckles, etc). Learn when it's safe to punish him, and when it just seems that way. If you are ever unsure, go into training mode as Big Band, set your opponent to Parasoul, set frame data on, and do different moves at different ranges to see what is negative on block and what isn't.   Also know that Parasoul has a quick instant overhead on Big Band. It is j.lp, j.hp. If you hit that, you get a full combo. If it's blocked, you can do it again (often works the second time, I find),go for a cr.lk, or block if you expect him to reversal.   A big part of fighting Big Band is experience. You'll learn his tricks soon.  Peacock - Useful moves to get over her wall of spam are m.egret call, h.egret call, raw silent scope (very risky, but often works if you can see an obvious pattern), super jump into j.mk (if you can set up m.tear toss first, it's more effective, gets beaten by item drop though), and the simple jump forward and block. If ever you are at a range where st.lp can hit, go for it. It's long range can often surprise people. Always be ready to punish a teleport if you are getting her close to the corner, and maybe most important of all- once you hit her, kill her. Reset her to death, use plenty of meter, etc. If you let her go with even a little health, you gotta do all that work again to get another hit.   Fortune- her normals are faster than yours,so don't try to challenge them. In situations where you'd normally hit cr.lk instinctively, you need to rethink that against fortune. Always be wary of her head, and whether or not it is on cooldown or not. If it looks asleep, she can't use it, so you don't have to worry about blocking it for a moment. Remember that you can stun the head for a moment by hitting it. So if you want to shoot a napalm shot, but the head is close, do a quick cr.hk (or cr.mk or lk,whatever will reach), and then cancel that into the napalm shot. The shot will be a few frames slower, but it's worth it if it protects you from getting nom'd.  On phone, sorry for typos. I play Parasoul and Double, would love to give any other help I can."
Skullgirls,398g4h,Streloks,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"Ty, as of now I'm playing mostly Parasoul and Valentine so Big Band and Fortune are really getting on my nerves. Against Peacock as Valentine I seem to have no trouble as I can dash to follow her teleport and jump over all of her stupid crap.  I'm also having trouble resetting with silent scope. I most often end a combo with it but I can't seem to pick up again after that. Should I try to set them high with the overhead hk into c.hp and normal jump combo or go for c.lk into c.mk until they get back up?"
Skullgirls,398g4h,Streloks,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:13:25 2015 UTC,"If silent scope hits the opponent out of the air, you can't combo off of it. If it hits them on the ground but far away, I'm pretty sure you can't combo off of it. And if it hits then on the ground and close, but you already used an otg in that combo, you can't combo it. I think those are the situations where it doesn't work, won't be able to test it for a few days."
Skullgirls,398g4h,weealex,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:28:27 2015 UTC,"Brass is usually kinda safe, assuming they're spacing right.  I mean, technically it's minus, but it hits so far from his body that you can space it properly to make it effectively unpunishable by most of the cast.    Parasoul vs peacock is probably the worst match up in the game.  If you play point parasoul, you basically get one good chance to et stuck in.  Once you're in, you beat up hard on peacock since her only reversal options are grounded.  If you get stuck full screen, check out (i think) worldjem's youtube video on approaching peacock.  Short version: push block lots to make space and look for item drops.  After a Shadow of Impending Doom drops, that's your opportunity to dash jump forward.  The other option for Parasoul is to look for a George toss and respond with either medium or heavy egret and immediately cancel it into sniper scope.  Even if you mess up the timing of the heavy one a bit and they can block, they'll still have to block the soldier since it only stops hitting if parasoul is hit in the recovery of the soldier summon (since you're cancelling the recovery of the soldier summon with a super, you're essentially skipping the entire recovery of it).  Val's high mobility gives her much better options to approach.    For Fortune, she's good on the ground, not so hot in the air.  Make her come to you."

Block: Sometimes, you just have to block. Filia doesn't have too much range on her normals, so at certain spacings, she just has to block (versus properly spaced long-range pokes). Generally you want to try to stay either outside or inside these ranges (preferably inside).   Another option is to just run up to them and do an invincible move, but that's not going to work every time, and is a bad habit to get into."
Skullgirls,397i28,MystyrNile,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"Use normals with faster startup (lights instead of heavies)   Filia's good at this too. She, Ms Fortune, and Fukua are the only characters with 5f normals."
Skullgirls,397i28,brocoder,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:04:37 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I'm not patient enough. When I started, I have been running at my opponent and trying to hit them, which I've realized is a bad strategy. Thanks for the help!"
Skullgirls,397i28,shadowdude777,2,Tue Jun 9 23:24:34 2015 UTC,"If you aren't already, you should be air-dashing"
Skullgirls,397i28,Saigancat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:29:47 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you need to block more. This is something that most beginners realize when they transition to being intermediate. If you have no reason not to be blocking, you should be blocking. You'll probably want to block low when they're on the ground unless/until you see an overhead coming, since most ground moves are mid/low, and block high if you see them jump in.  Rushdown doesn't mean ""shift the pressure off of you and onto the opponent"" so much as it means ""keep the pressure on your opponent once you have it."" In reality, Filia and Valentine (the game's other rushdown character) both have trouble getting opponents off their backs, but once they have the upper hand, they're terrifying."
Skullgirls,3969sx,Ianjohn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:42:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, seria stancels are 6 frames faster than non-seria stancels. Without a charge you can't for example link S.HP into S.MK -> S.HP, so without a charge, your combos are more limited.  I base this on http://wiki.shoryuken.com/Skullgirls/Squigly ''A standard stance cancel is 18f total and a Seria cancel is 12f, making cancels significantly faster if Squigly builds a charge.''"
Skullgirls,3969sx,Nodscouter,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"Mmk, makes sense. Still doesn't explain what's tripping me up, unless those 6 missing frames are just a bit too fast for me to consistently land, which is possible"
Skullgirls,3969sx,weealex,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:05:24 2015 UTC,Are you trying to do standing lp or crouching?  It's a huge difference.  s.HP xx stancel s.lp is something like a 5 or 6 frame link.  S.HP xx stancel c.lp is 1 frame.
Skullgirls,393coe,StarrTheSquirrel,7,Mon Jun 8 23:29:24 2015 UTC,I'd recommend the Qanba Q1. It's $70 and shouldn't give you any problems.
Skullgirls,393coe,SchizTurtles,3,Tue Jun 9 00:55:50 2015 UTC,"I've had a PS3 Q1 for close to a year now. The only problems I've had with it are that the stick squeaks (minor annoyance, but doesn't disrupt gameplay) and the table clamps are kind of gimmicky and cheap. One of them cracked and can't clamp to the table anymore. I play with the stick on the table or in my lap, so it's not a real bother. The clamps do add a nice weight to it, too. I highly recommend the Q1 for a first stick.  Also, I've replaced the buttons with GamerFinger mechanicals, so I can't comment on the button feel, durability etc."
Skullgirls,393coe,Dormoxx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:30:56 2015 UTC,Mine doesn't squeak..
Skullgirls,393coe,Noughiphiet,5,Tue Jun 9 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"The base Mayflash is pretty garbo. If you are looking for a quality stick, I would try to pick one up second hand, because I don't think the Mayflash is worth it. I bought 2 of them and honestly, it would be fine if I knew how to mod the thing and put some actually good parts in it. (Replacing the face plate would be nice too, as it is pretty ugly as a base.)  Hate to ask out of the blue, but if someone could maybe link me a good guide to modding fight sticks, I would greatly appreciate it."
Skullgirls,393coe,DeathKidFTW,3,Tue Jun 9 00:06:53 2015 UTC,"Don't get the mayflash, it's a waste of your money."
Skullgirls,393coe,solarparade,2,Tue Jun 9 00:06:22 2015 UTC,"Even if you're limited on the amount of money you can spend, I'd say it's worth waiting and saving up for a TE with sanwa parts. It'll last you for years so you'll be getting your moneys worth that's for sure."
Skullgirls,393coe,Tessius,2,Tue Jun 9 00:06:46 2015 UTC,"People here are saying the Mayflash is bad, and they would be right. HOWEVER, I started on the Mayflash and while it was not ideal, if you can solder and grind plastic down, its about 2 hours of work to make it an all Sanwa fighting game machine. I got the Mayflash cheap because I wasn't sure if I could transition to stick and I was willing to try out a bad one to see if it was even worth it.  I ended up loving it, saved up and bought Sanwa parts and replaced everything myself and now, besides its light weight, it is a phenomenal little stick. After I got my Qanba/EightArc QRaf 4 (which is objectively a better stick in everyway) I still use the modded Mayflash here and there for fun with no issues. I also bring it to my weekly locals and let people use it if they want and as soon as they find out its all Sanwa they have no issues with it (some hated it before thinking it was cheap and bad and then loved it when they found out what it was... which is a stupid placebo effect thing I guess and goes to show that sometimes its all in our head).  TL;DR if there is no other options, you are uncertain if you will like stick, and you can do the mod work on your own (I promise its pretty easy you can even PM me and I will tell you how step by step) then I would go for the Mayflash. If you don't fit ALL THREE of those, then save up for a better stick or stick to pad."
Skullgirls,393coe,brett6452,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"I think the $40 mayflash is the only thing available, short of a 2nd hand purchase of something better."

Seriously. as a person who owns 10 different fighting sticks. I was super surprised at how amazing that stick is for being how small it is. I love the clamps too.. works so well if I am doing GGPO on my Surface Pro.  It was also super easy to swap parts out. Just keep in mind once you go that path, there is no going back.    I was planning on buying a second one.. I think I was going to wait till EVO and see if there might be a sale.  You might snag a deal."
Skullgirls,393coe,Noughiphiet,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:22:17 2015 UTC,"Came to this thread late but yeah congrats on the q1, i got it and i feel its a good start with a stick since the button holes and stick are fitted perfect for sanwa parts.  So enjoy the stick now, beat the crap out of it for a year or so, then upgrade the buttons/stick to higher quality parts, its super easy too."
Skullgirls,393coe,Snackys,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:13:30 2015 UTC,Whatever you get don't get the Hori Fighting Stick Mini. It's honestly a downgrade from controller or keyboard.

Skullgirls,392stb,MystyrNile,17,Mon Jun 8 21:05:23 2015 UTC,"PIMPING TIME  First off: Get Good. Every week on sundays, /u/Prime1153 and his menagerie of commentators run an event called Get Good, where you sign up, you get to play 3 matches against someone of equal skill and in the same region as you and while you're playing, the commentators discuss what you could be doing better, what you're doing well and what could be improved upon. I would suggest this is the prime event for new players, but it's also great once you graduate to intermediate. Matches are streamed here and signups are posted on the subreddit a few days in advance of the event as well as on the steam group.   Second: I Wanna Be The Skullgirl. Each saturday, /u/cantinera and her co-commentator /u/GhettoThrasher streams a tournament for newbies, previously called ''Newbie Night'', commentates it as well as broadcasts a few instructional videos to allow people to learn from more experienced players. They also usually have a more experienced player as a guest commentator who helps to give more advanced and in-depth feedback. While a tournament might sound a bit competitive, it's all very newbie-friendly. Main thread is here and the stream is here  Third, we have Skullgirls slapfest. Slapfest is usually less instructional-focused than the two events above and is more aimed towards getting a lobby and a chat going and playing friendlies. The players are very willing to help you out though and the on-going commentary, while more casual, can be incredibly helpful. Steam group is here and some matches are streamed here.  Fourth, we have the Skillgrills Weekly Tournaments group. Though officially a tournament for all players regardless of skill level, we have quite a few beginners coming around. It's also streamed by /u/Catfish_Maw and I, and we've lately been moving towards more serious and instructional commentary like the events above. Your matches will be streamed and we will commentate them, and like all other stream events, just being able to see yourself play without the heat of the moment is a great way to learn. Every friday, streamed here with the steam group here.  Finally, I'll just recommend you to check some of the Skullgirls resources posted on here and of course all the other non-event streams, like Indubitable's stream on the rskullgirls twitch channel as well as other random streamers like /u/Magma442, /u/Dalextable, snackysnacks etc. All events will let you use a solo character, and the commentators will adapt. You're also very likely to meet other solo players during these events, simply because few beginners pick up teams directly.   Welcome to Skullgirls."
Skullgirls,392stb,Nodscouter,3,Mon Jun 8 21:50:14 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for this information! I think I'm going to sign up for the next get good and see how it goes before I jump into my first tournament.
Skullgirls,392stb,Dametualma,-13,Tue Jun 9 10:25:27 2015 UTC,"It's extremely simple. Here is a step by step guide.  Stop thinking it's a good idea to get used to having no assist.  Learn some simple basics for another character.  Choose an obnoxiously OP assist and learn what it's good for and how to convert off it (Napalm Pillar, Cerecopter, Butcher Blade).   Drink every time someone uses a raw tag.  Get good.  Then sign up for Get Good."

Skullgirls,392stb,LOTO-12,0,Tue Jun 9 21:49:40 2015 UTC,"You also CAN be successful in MvC3 by going by in and knowing from your first day what team you're going to play, with what assists, and deciding that you don't need to learn anything else because your way is fine.  Assists and DHCs are a big part of Skullgirls, and a very powerful tool. if you decide to go without them instead of learning to use them, you are depriving yourself of experience and doing yourself a grave disservice. Even if you then decide you prefer going solo, you are still depriving yourself.  Besides, you can easily go back to one character from two. You can't immediately go to two characters after learning how to play the game using only one character."

Skullgirls,393vr1,hyperhopper,4,Tue Jun 9 01:58:32 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, if you just did K, K, K, P, you'd get more damage without having to change anything else. Second, Grendel Killa (Back + Kick) does more than the Cossack dance (especially if it hits the chair). Third, you can combo off a grab.P ender with cr.MP, saving your OTG.  Basically, you choose between damage, positioning, and meter gain. Just use training mode to see what's what. Short version: use grendel killa for damage, and cossack dance or canine press for positioning."

But the enders that do more damage have less opportunity for oki setups. There's one ender throw that ends in a hard knockdown, meaning you can get a setup after, like a dash overhead/empty dash low or crossup j.HP. The others are techable knockdowns, meaning they can quick rise/tech roll, and some enders are harder to tech chase, even if you make the read."

Skullgirls,3913j2,jaksida,5,Mon Jun 8 15:53:52 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with the final boss is that she isn't like any other characters. She doesn't experience flinch, you can't sweep or overhead or grab her."
Skullgirls,3913j2,jaksida,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. With other characters, you have comparable movesets to combat each other with. With Marie, you basically need to find your hardest hitting attacks (jumping HP/HK), do lots of blocking, and spam projectiles if you have any.   It's not worse than Shao Kahn (that fucker is 100000% more annoying than Marie), but I can't quite say it's very....fun."
Skullgirls,3913j2,jonmsanti,2,Mon Jun 8 20:09:58 2015 UTC,That's the problem with 2D fighting games. Bosses are hard to pull off unless you do it Street Fighter style.

Skullgirls,393d3r,tekkaxe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:46:13 2015 UTC,"Even though you said you don't run into that issue in USF4, I'm still a bit suspicious that it might be a DS4 problem. I've ran into basically the same issue: While holding a diagonal, I sometimes get one of the cardinal directions instead. However, I made a thread about it on skullheart a while back ( http://skullgirls.com/forums/index.php?threads/ps4-pad-issue-or-my-ps4-pad-issue.7022/ ) and didn't get that many responses.  But I think this is what it boils down to: the contacts underneath the DS4 d-pad are a bit finnicky. You have to JAM the buttons down pretty hard to actually get the input. It's possible to be holding two directions down at the same time, yet only getting one direction because it apparently wasn't hard enough of a press on one of the buttons.   I never had to press that hard with my DS3, but have to sometimes with the DS4, as much as I enjoy the thing. And because I can get away with a light touch on the DS3, it leads to a lot of errors on the DS4."

Skullgirls,390j2b,Lyrony,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:46:10 2015 UTC,Yea I think that's how I need to start doing it. I've been kinda rolling my thumb. It doesn't hurt that way but then you miss the diagonal press more often.
Skullgirls,390j2b,shadowdude777,7,Mon Jun 8 10:51:08 2015 UTC,"You don't need the diagonal press. In this game, just pressing down followed by right is enough. I think you aren't allowed to go back to neutral between the two inputs though."

Skullgirls,390j2b,BruicidalBleathMetal,2,Mon Jun 8 13:13:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know but I feel this is a thing many gamers do in general. Do you think you may be pressing the D-Pad a little to hard? I say this because I feel with a lighter thumb it's easier to move it and do these sort of inputs. D-Pads, especially a PS3's does not need to be pressed that hard to register. Stickier D-Pads of the olden day may have given us this sort of behavior and hasn't REALLY effected us in games, until a game like Skullgirls where directional input is very VERY important.

The D-pad will naturally want to go past the down-forward/down-back position on the way.

Skullgirls,390j2b,Saigancat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:36:11 2015 UTC,It'll eventually just come with practice. What I do is use the bendy bit on the palm-facing part of my thumb to roll from Down to Forward and that works roughly 100% of the time. Although that part of my thumb hurts after extended play sessions.  Source: I use a PS3 controller.
Skullgirls,38y5cy,A_Hint_of_Lemon,31,Sun Jun 7 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"Lab 0 has expressed an interest in making a Skullgirls 2 at some point in the future. Just not now. The team has been working on the same game for quite a few years now, and at a ridiculously low pay and for an insane amount of hours, and many of them are gonna be really really happy to be done. They've mentioned and hinted towards making some non-Skullgirls projects, but no details so far. Lab 0 wants to make Skullgirls 2 at some point in the future, but there are a lot of factors in play here. Suffice it to say, it certainly doesn't look like Lab 0 is dissolving or breaking up in the future, but it's pretty understandable if they need to take a break from Skullgirls for a while."

I had asked Mike the following: ""When are you ever making a playable maid?"", I never mentioned Marie specifically. However, it ended up becoming a topic about playable Marie. He also had asked me to come back to him at a time later in the future about the possibility of a playable Marie. Long story short, a joke topic ended up being a possibility of a playable Marie for a future idea. It is very possible he will do it, it's just how he will implement her. Obviously she won't be anything like how she is in story mode. I am heading back to Anime Expo this year, if I see MikeZ, I am obviously bringing up the question again. ;)"

Skullgirls,38yzw4,TronIsMyCat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:36:40 2015 UTC,"This is why I should change my training mode settings. You can do j.lp instead if you want the bait. The HK lets you set up a reset or a mixup with an assist more reliably, which makes it a bit better if not bursted."
Skullgirls,38yzw4,CK_Crash,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"It is though. First, you can see it's punishable because the burst is blue. Second, the dummy pops on the physical hit of j.hk, not avery. If the defender waits to get hit by avery, then bursts, they're fine."

Skullgirls,38ypq7,TheBigBruce,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you, tried it out a bit, increase dmg by ~800 makes the a train follow up an amount more than a bit but not alot harder to time. as for the follow ups, i wasnt necesarily saying that it have to end the way it does, any suggestions for alternatives would be neat."

Skullgirls,38ypq7,Fluffy_Ducks,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:45:43 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you can continue the combo with airdash and then either j.MP or j.MK
Skullgirls,38ypq7,Dalextable,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:38:41 2015 UTC,"1) I used the airdash to get the grab  2) forgoing the grab and adc'ing a kick triggers ips in this case  3) in this particular setup, I seem to wiff the adc mp a fair bit, but I'll try it out some more, might just be my execution."
Skullgirls,38ypq7,brocoder,2,Mon Jun 8 09:48:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was just thinking valentines airgrab in general. That can be combo'd off with a j.MK or a j.MP(this might be depending on the fighter. I think if they're heavier j.MP would be better). If you start off with an airdash then there's no way for you to combo off of it without a DHC unless you are in the corner. My recommendation for you would be to use a combo with more damage and use less lights at the beginning. Unfortunately, the two optimized val combos I know(here and here) both encounter issues with your set up.   Because you use two chains at the beginning before you get in the air, when you finally launch you're in combo stage 5 and have a ton of undizzy. Generally as valentine, the meat of your combos is in the air and you need to have enough undizzy and normals available to be effective. If you use the first combo I mentioned, you hit IPS on the second bypass. If you use the second combo, you hit undizzy pretty fast and the opponent can burst without a real set up available. If you go by yours, you don't have undizzy or normals left to be useful so you're forced to reset(unless you wanna go for very little damage). The set up isn't very strong as a result(unless you wanna go for a burstbait/throw reset every time. Even then there are much better options). I would recommend putting your assist somewhere other than the beginning if you want more out of valentine in general(or finding a different assist entirely).  Other random tips: when you're in training mode and you want to test something, put the meter at 3 bars instead of 5 so you can see how much meter you will gain/lose from a combo/set up. Also, if you run a team of three it's a good idea to make the opponent a duo so you can see the real damage being dealt. 3 v 3 multiplies everyone's damage by 1.3(you can see in the attack data box)so this set up does even less damage in any other team scenario. hope this helps"

If you want to go to tournaments and events, you'll need something that works on PS3/PS4.

See Beowulf would be worthless without his chair. It can do everything you ever wanted.   Piss off your friends. Check Cancel Stuff. Check Nuke people out of nowhere aka Hurting Hurl M. Check Trip people by offering them a chair to relax aka Hurting Hurl L. Check Remind people that there is no escaping the big bad wolf by running to one side of the screen aka Hurtling Hurl H. Check Get your crowd hyped by slamming someone's face onto your chair and then picking it up aka any aerial slam onto Hurting. Check And finally do a russian dance on a chair aka Down Kick while grabbing. Check   There is also those other stuff like a dash grab, Wulf Blitzer (chainable dash), the Grendel arm with which he does stuff, but of from that the most important is his Milk (at least that's what my friends and I call it).  Milk is his level 3 special attack (quarter circle back + double punch). First Beowulf uppercuts his opponent three times and then bodyslam him. Looks aweseome, feels awesome, does awesome damage.

Personally,  Coming from playing akuma in third strike,  I'm all about rush downs and zoning. So my team came naturally as Peacock and valentine. I recently added beowulf because Jesus fuck does he have a crap load of options, and his neutral game is alot like Hugo. Dick around with some bnbs and see what you like to use."
Skullgirls,38w15k,Kraines,2,Sun Jun 7 08:38:04 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about buying the game but mains in games are usually chosen by how much you like the character. If you were playing an MK character, you might decide on Jax because you like his fatalities or if you are playing Street Fighter you might chose Dan because of how comical he is.  Just play all the characters a couple of times in story or otherwise and see which one you like the most."
Skullgirls,38w15k,JetSetDizzy,2,Sun Jun 7 11:52:45 2015 UTC,"I chose Painwheel because I love her design. Though flight cancels took a bit of getting used to, they aren't that hard and are second nature by now. Picked up Bella for the second spot because of how goddamn good she is there.

I fucking love him. He's this huge guy and everyone of his special moves are instruments. For fucks sake he toots a horn when using a neutral punch. lol.

If you just need basic stuff, check out nuuance on youtube.  He's not the highest level player, but his stuff is pretty easy and is intentionally online and beginner friendly.  As far as I know, his corner stuff is still the most optimal for damge"
Skullgirls,38vza1,Waveofshadow,3,Sun Jun 7 08:04:09 2015 UTC,"I personally use the 360 Analog Stick (Sue me) and I find that the easiest way to do the DP is to hit forward, then roll the stick/Dpad to down, then do a QCF. Doing it this way means it will input as a DP and you won't need to return the Dpad to the neutral position before hitting down-down forward. If you can comfortably do quarter circles in a combo, doing it this way might feel familiar."
Skullgirls,38vza1,Nodscouter,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:32:35 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to avoid using anything but the dpad if at all possible, but I have experimented with switching to the stick just for the DP motion because yes, it is very easy to DP with the stick. I just find the stick really awkward to use for everything else."
Skullgirls,38vza1,Prime1153,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:28:03 2015 UTC,"When it comes to execution, I'm afraid you just need to grind it out or consider a different controller. One of the big reasons I switched to stick was that I couldn't do DPs consistently on the 360 controller."
Skullgirls,38vza1,Wal_Mart,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"I made a thread earlier about this combo, and I'd feel a bit silly making a whole new thread for one little question (let me know if that's how this sub goes, i'm used to the sf sub where they consolidate everything)  BUT -- I can't for the life of me get the dp to connect. I can get it to come out just fine, but it just shows this little white flash that's not the usual red ""no"" sign but it's not a hit either.  What is this/what am I doing wrong?  edit: please disregard -- I would still like to know what the white flash means, but I got the dp to connect   yay"
Skullgirls,38vza1,brocoder,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:41:18 2015 UTC,"The white flash appears when the character leaves hitstun, i.e. you've dropped the combo."
Skullgirls,38vza1,Wal_Mart,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:28:05 2015 UTC,Thanks -- so it's functionally identical to a block?  Does it give you less/more blockstun or anything like that?
Skullgirls,38vza1,brocoder,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:40:26 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, you're not getting the DP to come out at all?  I'd suggest setting input display to list in training mode, so you can see exactly what you're inputting.  If your input looks fine and it's still not coming out, a recording might help us see what's wrong."
Skullgirls,38vza1,Tibbersz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:33:57 2015 UTC,"I explained this earlier in another thread. After Horus hits em (qcf+ml), hold forward. You don't have to dash, just keep walking.  Now cr.hk (the boat) has to be used when they hit the ground. You want the move to hit them off the ground (otg) and than put in your dp. If you hit them with cr.hp earlier (while they are airborne) you'll miss.  Also let the boat ride and once you see it connect, THAN dp hp into mp adc whatever. If you do it earlier, you'll cancel the boat before it hits.  Edit: early in morning. Did not read question throughly.  So if you're having trouble with raw cancels, and claim you can do dp consistently by itself, than there isn't too much I can say. I'm going to assume that you just panic or aren't good at canceling.  You should just practice cr.hk xx dp.hp. It will not combo when it connects, but you can get used to canceling. Also try canceling s.hp x2 xx dp mp>hp. This'll also help with getting used to canceling and it'll also help you down the line.  I'm not sure if there are shortcuts like in street fighter, so make sure your inputs are clean (hit up training room). If you need any help just send me a message with your steam. I'm also learning Eliza on the side!"

Skullgirls,38vqxp,HotsteamingGlory,3,Sun Jun 7 13:11:41 2015 UTC,"From a solo standpoint, Parasoul is better. She has more options at a variety of ranges. Filia is great at rushdown, but that's about it. She's better when placed on a team that can make up for her weaknesses (ranged combat, getting through zoning, etc.)."
Skullgirls,38vqxp,Prime1153,2,Sun Jun 7 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"I think as a solo character Parasoul is better, Filia's neutral game is ass so she really needs an assist.  Maybe try playing both, you get a good assist as Filia and a safe DHC (bikes) and as Parasoul if you do reversal Pillar then you can DHC into gregor to convert off of it."

H Hurting Hurl is also a great assist since it covers a lot of space and can make your approach safer. s. HK doesn't really work from my experience, because it will trigger the IPV faster. The chairless variations of cr. HK and cr. HP are pretty good but Big Band doesn't really need them, since you already got tons of armor."
Skullgirls,38vqrf,Spieren,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:48:26 2015 UTC,Why do you need a combo extender? BB does crazy damage as it is.  H Hurl is pretty much your best assist option with Beo since it has the potential to make BB rush punches safe with the right timing.
Skullgirls,38vqrf,AOWYomabuddy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:56:51 2015 UTC,"Go with one of the Hurls.  I play Beowulf in various double and the hurls never failed me. Especially nuke hurl (medium punch). L Hurl isn't a bad ides either and H Hurl is good, but I am not really a friend of it."
Skullgirls,38vl6m,Wal_Mart,3,Sun Jun 7 05:03:27 2015 UTC,"I've been attempting the exact same combo, and it seems like you need to dash first, then hit them off the ground with c.HK - the spacing's a bit weird, but you can get a decent idea from this video in the General BnB Compendium thread on Skullheart."
Skullgirls,38vl6m,MnemonicJohnny,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:07:55 2015 UTC,"wow that looks like you hit it really late then, I think I was going for it way too early.  I'll give it another shot tomorrow."
Skullgirls,38vl6m,Shezestriakus,2,Sun Jun 7 05:16:12 2015 UTC,"You want the c.HK to connect between the first and second bounce, not juggle.  Midscreen, a dash is required to close distance, as you can only special cancel the first third or so of c.HK.  c.HK xx DP doesn't work on a standing opponent.  If you're still having trouble, I'd recommend practicing in the corner, so you don't have to worry about the dash. Keep grinding out c.HP xx qcf.MK > c.HK xx heavy DP until you have a good feel for the timing, then practice it midscreen to learn the dash timing."
Skullgirls,38vl6m,Tibbersz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm pretty sure I know what you're messing up on. Doing this on my phone though, so forgive and typo's.  First I off, after qcf+mp, you don't have to dash to connect cr.hk (although you will lose out on dp mp>hp).  Instead, I prefer to casually walk forward. Now you want to hit cr.hk when they hit the ground (or otherwise called otg, off the ground), than put in dp.hp. If you do it too early than you'll hit them while they are airborne and you'll whiff the dp.  If you're still having trouble, message me with your steam and I'll gladly help."

Since I wasn't able to buy more game copies and I just bought quadruple DLC. For whenever they're not on sale, and we have tournaments. I'll give em as rewards.   Edit : I read up a bit. Apparently steam does that on purpose to stop people from abusing deals and then reselling at a higher price.   Also. If you already own the game. Even a single copy.

Skullgirls,38sz9f,Dalextable,6,Sat Jun 6 16:18:05 2015 UTC,"I came from USFIV just like you, but I'm a Sak main so I guess I was already halfway to Skullgirls. Now I play Fortune/Robo... A Ryu player? I'd recommend Fukua or Parasoul if you're okay with charge chars.  It's been a few months now, and I've learned fairly optimal undizzy combos and resets for all my chars, so I guess I'm comfortable. Combos are longer than USFIV, but canceling means the timing is almost always easier. Restands are braindead muscle-memory compared to the anus-puckering 1F tatsu loop bullshit I deal with when I play Sakura, plinking or not.  Long story short is that there is spacing, but it's not as obvious as Street Fighter since... imho, good footsies are outshined by good resets in this game until absolute top-level play."
Skullgirls,38sz9f,Whalen207,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:31:04 2015 UTC,Shouldn't footsies be the biggest part of a fighting game?
Skullgirls,38sz9f,Whalen207,8,Sat Jun 6 17:34:18 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Whiff punishing, poking, counter-poking, and normal spacing are present in anime fighters, including marvel-liked i.e. Skullgirls. I'd argue, though, that that SF mid-range neutral isn't always present -- when some character have full-screen crouch-unblockables (big band), ambiguous as fuck mixups (filia), quick and comboable overheads (parasoul, painwheel), a veritable wall of projectiles (peacock), insane grab pressure (beo, bella)... long story short every is really matchup dependent, and few matchups end up prioritizing mid-range footsies."
Skullgirls,38sz9f,BoatsandJoes,4,Sat Jun 6 18:08:44 2015 UTC,"Footsies are important in Skullgirls just like they are in Street Fighter, there's just other important stuff as well, on both defense and offense. In my opinion (different from the guy you replied to), footsies are more important than offense, but it depends on your perspective (like Whalen said, they play Sakura. I play Ryu, so it makes sense I would value spacing).  If you really learn the game, you'll understand that it's just as deep as Street Fighter. If you write it off, you're missing out on the best neutral in any fighting game I've ever played.  EDIT: this came off as a little snobby. Basically the spacing is there, but you have to be really good at it because a good player will get in instantly (when two people are equally skilled at neutral, it's really fun). However, unlike street fighter 4/mkx/even guilty gear, the pressure game is also really interesting."
Skullgirls,38sz9f,TronIsMyCat,3,Sat Jun 6 18:17:31 2015 UTC,"Also, to give a comparison, think of calling an assist in SG like jumping in SF. Your assist can't block, much like you can't block when jumping in SF. When you call your assist, you are running the risk of losing control of the situation because you need to protect that assist. Maybe you need to give up good screen position to protect the assist, or give up building up abilities like squiggly stances or val's poison.   Sometimes you can't risk protecting it at all because your guaranteed to get hit back. You called an assist in a bad spot and now you get hit for it. You can think of that like jumping in on crouching Guile. Just...why?  Whether by a straight punish or a counter-called assist, if your assist gets hit too much you have a big liability on your hands, as red health goes away on snap, tag or dhc.  Assist footsies are a big part of this game (and vs. style games in general) and understanding them can perhaps unlock some of the neutral game."
Skullgirls,38sz9f,Wal_Mart,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"I think, as anoth SF player coming into thos style of gameplay, assists make this game incredibly hard to follow, even when only watching replays.  It feels like it has a totally different tempo. Is there a guide to assists or a guide for SF players coming into anime fighters?"
Skullgirls,38sz9f,TronIsMyCat,2,Sat Jun 6 19:48:10 2015 UTC,"I don't remember them too well, but I'm sure there's at least a basic tutorial in the game for them. Other than that look to some intermediate to higher level matches. What kind of assists do they use? When do they use them? How often? How do they protect them? How do they get punished? Answer these questions as you watch match footage of people who know what they're doing, and it will start to help.  Assists are definitely something hard to get a hold of when first learning vs style games. That's one reason why many people recommend learning solo first, then finding a teammate that works well with the character you learned."
Skullgirls,38sz9f,TronIsMyCat,2,Sun Jun 7 04:07:57 2015 UTC,What don't you enjoy about the neutral?
Skullgirls,38sz9f,TronIsMyCat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"Lots of infighting  There isn't really any spacing. In USF4 you can keep rush down characters away by using hadukens and zone them out into choosing bad options (such as anti-airing in which you can anti-air). It seems like in skullgirls everything is up close and personal, with constant pressure, versus constant pressure at various distances through projectiles. Constant 100 MPH speed  IDK if this is just sub-genre differences, but it seems like the game is so fast you can't really make good decisions because they get countered by whatever is faster. Combos are easy as fuck and not as rewarding  In USF4, links and strings just feel harder than in Skullgirls. Practicing these strings and links and punishes and then applying them in USF4 just feels so much more rewarding because they are hard to apply. Yes I'm sure it takes alot of practice to optimize punishes, but if I wanted to do that, I would be playing melee.   Which I already do."
Skullgirls,38sz9f,brocoder,12,Sat Jun 6 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"I think the problems you have are due to inexperience and your actual tastes in fg's.  There is a ton of spacing in Skullgirls, it just goes by quick. The optimal player can play that little bit of neutral, then mix you up 2-3 times once they get the hit and your character is dead.  There are plenty of characters that can rely on projectiles or strong normals that can force then into bad situations, whether that's putting them in the corner, forcing them into a mixup, or w/e. There's a lot more layers than projectile>jump>dp that's in sf because there's a lot more options on defense. What you see as ""constant pressure through projectiles"" doesn't make it any less zoning. One player forced a situation for the other to get stuck full screen in a fireball trap. There are plenty of options on defense where this is still a mindgame, and not just mindless setplay.  Game speed is on you, either by preference or by your inability to keep up with it, or both. Look at Marvel 2, and then think about how quick you have to think in that game. SF4 is slow by comparison, and is slow even when compared against more or less every other SF.  You don't like the combos. OK. That's about the end of that, then. There are plenty of ""hard"" combos in SG too, though, and it can be very rewarding to land some stupid hard damaging combo that kills a character. To me what's more rewarding are the resets, and that's where real training mode creativity comes in.  It's also ok to not like something, but I would say that a lot of what you don't like may be cleared up by playing more and getting better and playing better players. But you also might just not gel with it, which is fine."
Skullgirls,38sz9f,BeefPorkChicken,5,Sat Jun 6 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"lmao, if you want super hard combos, we can find you some stuff."
Skullgirls,38sz9f,AOWYomabuddy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:47:50 2015 UTC,"There's nothing great about hard execution combos, a computer could do it. What's great about fighting games is the mental aspects, not the technical ones."
Skullgirls,38sz9f,AOWYomabuddy,2,Sun Jun 7 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"Protip: All fighting games don't work the same way. Watch Skullgirls videos (don't watch older stuff, vanilla and SDE were pretty much k u s o g e b o y s, and even after that characters got changed a bunch so your mileage may vary), and also try to watch MVC2 videos since Skullgirls is heavily based around Marvel 2. If you come into the game from a fresh perspective and not thinking of it as SF4 you'll do much better.  EDIT: BTW you'll have to deal with shitty and thoughtless play a lot like braindead DP assist calls, mashing while getting combo'd till you get really good since the playerbase is kind of like that but if you can get in touch with people who actually know what they're doing and play smartly you can see what high level SG is really about."

It's a bit of a curve, (i used to play a boatload of UMvC3) but now i play Squigly smoothly, Eliza and Big Band are still wip, lol.

Skullgirls,38tq9o,n0837,3,Sat Jun 6 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"If you can be commited, set cpu to nightmare in training, and block for your life, I'd reccommend going against a team of quite different characters, such as Filia/Cerebella/Parasoul, as this should prepare you for different types of blocking, evasion and throw techs. I only partially agree with Saigancat about playing against cpu, but if you're struggling, playing against cpu can help to an extent.  I personally use nightmare mode arcade as a warmup before I play online, however this is after nearly 200 hours on the game, playing against the cpu should give you a decent idea on what moves charavters will do and what to look out for, of course this does not apply for high level play but will help you in begginner stages.  It's a shame about your internet but have you tried playing online much? I very often play a friend who is based in america where as I'm in Uk, we have at minimum 200 ping but we can usually get a fairly good game out of it, of course you need to compensate for the input latency and it's no match for playing locally but it's definitly doable."
Skullgirls,38tq9o,Lyrony,3,Sat Jun 6 20:10:12 2015 UTC,"I hope I don't get downvoted for this.  I play Project M, a mod for Super Smash Bros. Brawl that adds technical systems into the game that the previous game in the series, Super Smash Bros. Melee, had but did not carry over to Brawl. I play with the CPU's every day, highest difficulty. But it doesn't matter. I look at these other people who play Project M and they're so good. They don't play against bots. I am forced to, which is a shame.  Now, with Skullgirls, I think that going straight up against a Nightmare level CPU outright would be a little difficult for me but I could manage. I wish my internet was just a little better. My very terrible 150 kb/s average is horrid in any video game. I think my ping at one time was a minimum of 500. My location simply does not allow for me to play online, but I do have some friends who are into the fighting scene. Maybe I could push them into it and play against them. It's a shame, really. I wish that CPU's could teach as much as humans but it simply isn't possible.  Thanks for the help :)"
Skullgirls,38tq9o,FunkyLobster,2,Sat Jun 6 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"I'm getting into Skullgirls coming from the Smash scene as well (primarily a Melee player, but I adore ProjM) and I have to say that you can actually learn a lot from fighting bots in Skullgirls. I certainly have. Obviously players online will play different than nightmare bots and you shouldn't be practicing against them, but Training mode actually has a lot of options you can benefit from, like setting which direction bots will tech, if they block high or low, et cetera. You can learn some characters mix-up options and how to block them, as well as how you can mix-up yourself and lead into a combo. It's not like Smash where matches against bots are entirely useless for learning unless you want to practice your DI. Kinda wish more fighting games had features like this..."
Skullgirls,38tq9o,Dametualma,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:54:57 2015 UTC,I thought the tutorials helped a lot. I learned a bunch of combos from them and I took down a lot of CPU's with them. It's pretty sweet. I am starting to develop procedures and resets and combos. I feel a lot better now and I now do have friends to play Skullgirls with.
Skullgirls,38tq9o,Lyrony,2,Sun Jun 7 01:13:53 2015 UTC,"Hi, you can sign up for the weekly Get Good tournament. (I'm new too) You get matched with other people of your skill level/region and get some critiques of your matches afterwards.  What kinda conditioned me to block better in this game was just trying to beat Marie on Hard with Eliza haha. Eliza has the hardest time against her because she can't cheese her way to victory with projectile spam. You need to approach while constantly being pressured by projectiles and stuff."
Skullgirls,38tq9o,Snackys,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:33:20 2015 UTC,Yeah! Eliza is one of the characters that I can say that I am decent with. She's really good. And I will check that out! Thank you so much!
Skullgirls,38tq9o,Lyrony,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:56:51 2015 UTC,"I've never really been into any of the smash games so I can't really comment there, but it sounds like you definitely reached the point where you can't learn any more from the CPU ahah, and maybe I was a little hasty suggesting nightmare off the bat, but I definitely think that normal difficulty will not really help you in the long run as they let you get away with too many mistakes.  I just noticed you have a squigly flair, have you checked out This guide? for squigly, it's a pretty popular one (but I believe a couple of things are outdated, especially a little exploit he points out) and helped me greatly seeing as I have squigly on my team, it's pretty long but if you can find the time it's definitely worth it as a Squigly player.  But yes good luck with Skullgirls"
Skullgirls,38tq9o,Saigancat,2,Sat Jun 6 20:35:22 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you good sir. If you poke around a little bit, the professional Smash community will greet you with open arms. However, I do prefer Skullgirls because Project M is designed to allow anyone (and I mean kids too, if they can get into the mechanics and such) be good at it. I bet the same can be said with Skullgirls but then again it seems hard as hell.  Thanks for the good wishes :)"

But on topic, fighting games are extremely mental over execution, and you cannot practice this versus a cpu. The cpu topic is something i do wanna make a video on eventually, but ill see when i get time for that.  But there are other ways to expand your knowledge and skill, i highly suggest everyone to read ""The fighting game primer"" as it explains how fighting games fundamentally functions.

With the released of Beowulf, Eliza, squiggly, and big band, I noticed that it would be SUPER easy for them to continue releasing DLC characters. And I'd GLADLY keep paying for them.   It seems there's a TON of side characters in the story that could easily get their own story arc as well as become characters.   I also feel that if more characters don't get released this game will become stale and I REALLY don't want that.   So my question is, do the developers plan any future character releases?   I know they said this is the final version and if it's not here it won't be there, but does that completely end the chance for any additional characters in future updates?"
Skullgirls,38rf1w,Trestanray,5,Sat Jun 6 06:57:29 2015 UTC,"As stated on the indiegogo campaign. The Planned characters that were funded were Squigly, BigBand, Eliza, Beowulf, and Robo Fortune.

Skullgirls,38qc2s,sunflower_love,7,Fri Jun 5 22:48:19 2015 UTC,"Lots of slightly incorrect information in this thread, so I just wanted to set things straight.  The Dragon Punch motion is: →↓↘  In other words: forward, down, down-forward  But because forcing players to input that perfectly all the time is a little silly, various other inputs will still be accepted as a DP: →↓↘→,  →↘↓↘→,  →↘↓↘,  →↓→↘,  etc.  → ↓ → will not work as a DP input; there needs to be a down-forward input after down.  And don't worry about not understanding the motion, I remember going through the same thing years ago"
Skullgirls,38qc2s,brocoder,2,Sat Jun 6 05:55:27 2015 UTC,"The Z shape is known as a Dragon Punch, and on keyboard is put in with Forward, Down, Down-Forward, Forward. So basically Forward + Quarter Circle Forward (QCF).  Reverse DP is also in the game with a character, IIRC, and that is back + QCB.

Skullgirls,38qc2s,Sarmondia,2,Fri Jun 5 23:05:12 2015 UTC,One of the options in training mode allows you to see what you input across the bottom of the screen. It shows arrows and a six button input for punches/kicks.

It seems that it's a little strange for me, as sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but that's probably just my computer being an ass like it always is. I feel really stupid now for not attempting two different kick buttons. Thank you so much again!"

Skullgirls,38rx82,jonmsanti,3,Sat Jun 6 07:53:55 2015 UTC,"If it works don't fix it. To answer you question, yes that's basically what a Z motion is. The Z motion is: forward, down, forward and down at same time, forward. With a backwards Z being: back, down, down and back at the same time, back. While a QCF is: down, forward and down at same time, forward. Remember if you are getting the attack to work pretty much every time then you aren't doing it the wrong way!"
Skullgirls,38rx82,BabyEatingFox,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:15:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, the game is actually programmed to take ""forward, down, forward"" as a dragon punch. In SG in particular, they went out of their way to make all inputs very easy. This actually gets in the way sometimes. If you want to run-in and then do a QCF move immediately, sometimes you get a DP accidentally. ;)"

Skullgirls,38pc6f,Spieren,2,Fri Jun 5 21:17:20 2015 UTC,"I break it down into three different categories different from beignner, adv., and expert: scrubs, potmonsters, and top-players.  Scrubs don't know why they're losing and blame external factors. They aren't willing to learn. Making it past this is one of the biggest steps, realizing only you can cause yourself to get good.  Potmonsters are finally not going 0-2 in tournaments, but they're not really making it to top 8 either. This is a huge range, as it accounts for those that are okay, and those who are just out of the top 8. I think this accounts for a high majority of players.  Top players are always a threat. You always make it to at least top 16, with a few top 8 appearences if not wins.   That's just my opinion though. If you're looking at it as beginner, intermediate, and advanced, I feel like that implies time is all it takes to level up. I've known people who have been playing for 10 years and still kinda suck, while some who have been playing for 1 year are already getting intensely good. It's about learning, being open and receptive to criticism, and being creative. As long as you can look at your loses and learn something about figure out how to better play the next time, or even how to win then that's what's important."

Skullgirls,38pc6f,BabyEatingFox,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"I think you're an intermediate player when you have a general grasp on fundamentals. You know the movesets of your characters, you can block decently, you know when you can attack, and you can reliably perform BNBs. These are skills you need to play any fighting game. Once you have these down, you can start focusing on the more advanced systems and mechanics of Skullgirls. Understanding how the game works allows you to develop skills that aren't immediately obvious when you start playing. For example, as a beginner, you probably try to learn the longest combo possible, because ""more hits means more damage"".  When you learn how damage scaling works, you understand that it's more effective to perform multiple short combos. This leads to you learning how to reset.  It's all about the depth of your understanding of the game and how you're able to apply that knowledge in a match."

When you learn how damage scaling works, you understand that it's more effective to perform multiple short combos. This leads to you learning how to reset.   Not only that, but as MikeZ pointed out one time, everyone goes for ""optimal damage combos"", but as you go further into the combo, your opponent gets more and more meter. It's better to do short combos. You're probably going to get something like 80% of the damage and only give them 50% of the meter gain through it."
Skullgirls,38pc6f,shadowdude777,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:35:33 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has said, intermediate is by far the largest skill range. Once you have a pretty decent combo, you understand resets and maybe even a burst bait, footsies + the pressure game, you're intermediate.   But a higher-level intermediate player resets often, uses mixups as if they're second nature, takes advantage of assists, can do doublesnap combos, and has an intuition for certain things (""should I end this combo and kill this character, or snap them out and deplete all of that 3rd character's red-health?"", ""would an alpha counter help me here?"", ""would it be safe to pushblock guard cancel here and go for a reversal?"", ""am I being too predictable? Does my opponent know I'm going to try to jump-in again?""), etc.  I've played this game for 400 hours or so. I feel like I've been in intermediate since around hour 100. And I feel like I'm never going to leave intermediate, because I don't play often enough for my skills to get that sharp. There are huge diminishing returns in how much effort you put in vs how much better you get. Most people plateau at a certain point. The people who surpass that plateau through hours of work? Those are the ones we call ""experts."""

Skullgirls,38p0fo,hyperhopper,2,Fri Jun 5 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"Marie is really tough. She's going to have lowered difficulty in story mode in the next patch.  It depends on what character you're playing, but there are two general tips: 1) alternate between walk forward and block to get close. It's difficult if not impossible to dodge every projectile, especially in form 2, so you'll have to block them. Once you're in, use the most damaging move you can, block one attack, then do it again. This fight takes patience and good blocking, but it is doable. 2) save your meter to kill form 3 with supers as quickly as possible.  Everyone has some sort of strong character specific anti-skullgirl tactic. Peacock's projectiles are really strong against her (makes sense, given her backstory). Eliza has crouching heavy kick, which moves her forward really far and is projectile-invincible. If you say what character you're playing people can give you more specific tips.  Unfair fighting game bosses are a tradition (unfortunately), but they are beatable with the right tactics and practice."
Skullgirls,38p0fo,BoatsandJoes,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"I'm using beowulf, and his most damaging move is I think his chairless cr.HP, but even that gets me hit before the animation is over. Also using that means that I don't have a chair, and all the chips from blocking add up quickly."
Skullgirls,38p0fo,Nodscouter,3,Fri Jun 5 17:56:54 2015 UTC,"I'd say that J.HP with chair and a C.HK without char are the moves you're going to be spamming a lot vs Marie as Beo. Grapplers are sort of weird to play against an opponent that literally can't be grappled, but thankfully Beo has an excellent neutral game even without grabs."
Skullgirls,38p0fo,BoatsandJoes,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"again the c.hk has a super long backswing and I get hit during that, especially in second and third form. The j.hp seems good in form 2 but form 1 the flying skulls and the exploding skeleton kill a ton of health if you just spam that."
Skullgirls,38p0fo,Spieren,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"You can ground tech after the crouching heavy kick, which helps (either direction and a button when you hit the ground to do a roll-getup). Sounds like you'll be using crouching heavy kick in form 1 and jumping heavy punch in forms 2 and 3.  Don't forget to block, though! Try to block a move -> hit -> block a move -> hit. Sometimes you'll have to block a few moves in a row before you get a chance to attack. Knowing what attack is coming based on Marie's voice clip helps."
Skullgirls,38p0fo,Trestanray,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:29:38 2015 UTC,"Spamming J.HP with chair is great against Marie, also your Gigantic Arm blockbuster is a great finishing move since it goes trough projectiles. Losing the chair is not recommended since you'll take a lot of chip damage. And blocking is important too!"
Skullgirls,38p0fo,BoatsandJoes,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:22:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP but, any tips for Eliza? I can't beat Marie either."
Skullgirls,38p0fo,Trestanray,2,Fri Jun 5 17:47:48 2015 UTC,"Sure! I had a lot of trouble with Eliza too. The ""easy"" strategy is to just spam crouching heavy kick for the first two forms (since it goes through projectiles), and kill form 3 with level 3 super (crouching heavy kick will no longer reach because Marie is floating). If she's still alive after you super her, jumping heavy kick is a nice big normal to finish her off with. This worked fine for me on normal.  On higher difficulties, you might have to time the crouching heavy kick to go through the projectiles on purpose. One thing that really helps as all characters vs. Marie is knowing her sound cues (what voice clip corresponds to which attack)."

Skullgirls,38na0c,rushnorush,5,Fri Jun 5 09:05:00 2015 UTC,"1) Your 2nd and 3rd characters make ONE difference; when your 1st character dies or DHCs, it's the 2nd character who will come in. I generally will put the character I use as the assist most often as my 3rd character, because that means they will get hit a lot more and thus get more time to regenerate red health than if they had to come in immediately after my point character dies. But then I also play Valentine, who is a bit of a glass cannon and I generally don't switch her out before she dies.  For example, I sometimes run the team: Valentine, then Squigly, then Eliza. It makes sense to me because Eliza's assist (Butcher Blade) is the main one I use, while Squigly's (Cremation) is used less often, so Eliza takes a lot of abuse. Eliza also plays much better as a solo than Squigly so she can be my anchor.  2) I personally started solo, then added a 2nd, then a 3rd character. I'd say definitely don't start with 3 characters. It gets confusing because then your tag-out and assists get more complicated, because you have to specify which assist you want. Plus, with 3 characters, each one dies very quickly. Go for 1 or 2 at start.  3) You want a team with a good point character (first one) who benefits from your other characters' assists. You'll learn who is good at what over time. For example, Valentine has horrible assists, and she is pretty bad alone, but with assists, she's fantastic. This is why I'd say 99% of the time, you'll see people play Valentine as their first character.  With your team, I'd likely go with Valentine (c.MK assist), then Peacock (George at the Air Show), then Cerebella (Cerecopter or HP Lock 'n' Load). Out of the 3 of them, Cerebella is the most likely to do well alone, when the other 2 die, and you'll probably be throwing her assist out a lot as Valentine, so when Valentine dies, you get time for her to regenerate further as Peacock fights.  Hope that makes sense. Let me know if you have more questions. And of course if you feel that way about the art style, kudos to Alex Ahad, Mariel Cartwright, and the rest of the art team, and kudos to Michiru Yamane for the music. The whole LabZero team is fantastic. ;)"
Skullgirls,38na0c,shadowdude777,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:32:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed answer!   Do you try to have your strongest character at the beginning (because he'll start with full health while the others will have suffered during assist by the time they're tagged in)? Or is it more of a synergy/sitiuational thing (Peacock in the beginning because that's when you want to zone)?   I guess I'll start with a two man team of either Valentine and Cerebella or Peacock and Cerebella then. I really like Valentine's design, but she seems more complicated than Peacock to me."
Skullgirls,38na0c,shadowdude777,2,Fri Jun 5 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"It's more ""characters that perform well as solos at the back (because their teammates will likely be dead by then), characters that perform well on teams at the front"". The front character is generally called the ""point"" and the last one is called the ""anchor"".  Examples of good point characters: Valentine, Peacock  Examples of in-betweeners: Squigly, Eliza  Examples of good anchor characters: Double, Cerebella, Big Band  Valentine's combos are definitely more complicated in terms of execution than Peacock's (and probably than most of the rest of the cast), but Valentine's strategy is also way more straightforward. Get in close, keep the pressure on using a combination of jump-ins and forward-offensive assists, and NEVER let your opponent put pressure on you (because her reversal options suck). Another Valentine mantra I like to go by is to try to get hard knockdowns on your opponent (s.HK 3 times, the move with the IV pole, results in hard, sliding knockdown), because while they're down, you can load a purple poison vial. Valentine's raw damage output is really bad but with poisons, she can do a scary amount of damage.  Peacock is the game's quintessential zoner, but people have found success with her as a rushdown character too, surprisingly. She's actually very good at keeping pressure on the opponent with a good assist backing her. So, very similar to Valentine.  Cerebella can absolutely hold her own as a solo. She has an invincible reversal (Devil Horns), tons of armored moves in Tumbling Run and Lock 'n' Load, and deals absurd damage. She also has very good assist options (Cerecopter, Heavy Lock 'n' Load, and Excellebella). For that reason, I tend to put her at the back of a team.  These are all guidelines of course. One of my favorite things about SG is that it's so well-balanced that you could decide to do the ""wrong"" thing and it'll still be good. You could run solo Valentine if you want. Or solo Peacock. Or put Valentine in the back of your team. Experiment and do what's best for you. :)"
Skullgirls,38na0c,Bitjump,2,Fri Jun 5 18:55:46 2015 UTC,"I'm still new - so take the following with a pinch of salt - but I'll answer from what I've picked up so far.   Character order can be changed both when loading into a match and when playing. The order of character 2 and 3 will determine which ensemble you get when you call one. LP+MK, LK+MP or LK+HP will call your second character's ensemble. MP+HK, MK+HP or LP+HK will call your third character's ensemble. Tag commands work as expected, but if you hold both it'll switch characters 2 and 3.If you hold a tag command during the loading screen, it'll switch that character to point. Character order can be quite fluid because of this and the only thing it directly effects is blockbuster sequels - cancelling a blockbuster into a blockbuster from your next character.   From what I've seen, it's best to start with one or two characters - purely to learn combos, tech, proper play with that character. Using two characters gives you some experience with ensembles, tags and such. Solo isn't super common at a high level but it definitely exists. It's the same with pretty much all fighting games, learning one character at a time is generally easier than two or three.   You'll generally find that when you start playing a character you start wishing you could do something about a certain playstyle or wish you had a certain move to cover certain options. Certain characters lack a good DP so DP assists generally work pretty well with those characters - the same goes for characters with few projectiles or mid/far engage options, they might work well with a projectile assist or something like Big Band's Brass Knuckles."

First and foremost, if you're developing a game, don't put off working on the final boss until the very end.  Marie almost wasn't even in the game, but a few programmers and animators threw her in at the last minute. Generally, high-damage to start followed by consistent multi-hits.  It's good against Marie to start with a super and follow-up.  The only character off the top of my head who can't do this is Eliza. Crossups, especially for the second phase where she can't gang-bang you with skulls out of nowhere. Diamond Deflector and pushblocking against slow, consistent projectiles.  Unfortunately, Peacock is too erratic for the practice to apply to her. The power and glory of Robo Fortune Patience.  Just about the only one of these that's really applicable against real people.   Here's a thread on how to beat her on Skullheart, which is a fantastic forum and I highly recommend it.  Also, Robo Fortune's going to nerf Story Mode-Marie two difficulties less than the selected (So, Nightmare becomes Very Hard on Marie Only).    Also, any strategy is only going to work sometimes.  There's always the random chance her AI will decide moving around the screen's a good idea and she'll utterly penetrate you from behind.  I recommend patience and a flavorful adult beverage."

Who let that through? Because that's all Marie is - a broken boss fight. I don't care if you realised your boss was shit and shrugged it off saying it was a reference to other bad boss fights, because it wasn't, you just made a terrible boss. And if it really was, then you're just fucking stupid. Why would you make the reference to OP bosses by making your own boss OP? That takes the fun away. If you want to make a stupid reference like that, make it optional, like having Marie 300% be playable for every character or something like that.  I play story mode to find out more about the story, and to unlock artwork and ultimately finish the game. I don't want to go through a character's story mode, enjoying the fighting, having fun, and sometimes even enjoying the story (as poorly conveyed as it usually is), just to end up at Marie and remember: ""Oh, that's right. This boss is impossible."" All that means is that I've just wasted all of the time I spent on the story mode as well as the extra hour or so it took to beat Marie. It's all for nothing because I just end up quitting the game and I never go back to that story mode again.  To whoever designed Marie and whoever let her through, you fucked up your job.

You know, the type of friend that carries you home after you got really drunk and started hitting on the girl you'd probably regret taking home later? Yeah. Use it to approach if all else fails. The range on it is stupid. There are a few mechanics you should try to learn to work into some of your combos, the number one of which is double-snapping. Skarmand, a parasoul player (but we won't hold that against him), has actually made a really awesome tutorial about it here. Guess what solo characters receive all a portion of their red health back when they snap any character of a double or triple team. That's amazing."

She's slow af. And wow, yeah, she DOES have a low, but you can't use that low when you leave Eliza, can you? NOPE. YOU CAN'T. Sure, I've had dreams of a world where no one grabbed and Sekhmet roamed free, slaughtering all and showing her lack of weakness to the world, BUT IT WAS JUST A DREAM. Don't be me. Be better than me.

Just do a quartercircle forward and press MK to make him appear.  4: Be careful how you end your combo strings. This is just a good overall tip for playing the game, but especially with a solo character. Any openings you give other teams will be super hard to come back from. You have damage and health on your side, but it means nothing when you're being reset to hell by a fucking Valentine who apparently had nothing to do but beat on a lounge singer.

That said, someone with a good reversal would probably help her defensive game. Off the top of my head, Big Band's beat extend is generally one of the best, having a huge hitbox and pretty much ensuring you get a combo off of a hit. Beowulf's hurting hurl and Filia's updo are both pretty good at this.   But you'll know more what you're looking for in an assist once you catch yourself saying ""I wish I could do X or Y better"" or ""I wonder if that character's assist would help me with X or Y."" If you don't find yourself thinking that, you should probably continue solo. Eliza is probably one of the better solo characters, at least from what I've seen."
Skullgirls,38jsuy,kkwalker,2,Thu Jun 4 18:48:04 2015 UTC,You can do well as a solo. Only downside is not getting the knowledge of how people use assists and how they work and more importantly how people use them against you.  Also neutral game gets a bit harder without an assist to help you confirm into a combo
Skullgirls,38jsuy,Zeugirdor994,2,Thu Jun 4 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"To add onto what other people has said, there's also one clear disadvantage to going solo, and that is that you can't take advantage of health recovery by switching fighters out."
Skullgirls,38jsuy,UnluckyGhost,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:31:06 2015 UTC,"You are able to regenerate all of your red health if you're able to land a snapback onto an opponent however. Still not as good as tagging out since you need to use meter / sacrifice damage, but it's still something."
Skullgirls,38jsuy,shadowdude777,2,Thu Jun 4 21:15:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's 2/3rds if you hit the point character, and 1/3rd for an assist. Which adds up to all of your red health if you hit them both. And I think that you lose the rest of the red health once you do a snapback? Not sure about that part though.  In a way it's better because it's an instant regeneration. With teams, if a character gets really beat up, you have to tag them out and then your new point character has to not die for a long time so the assist can regenerate."

Skullgirls,38ldff,digitalskyfire,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:40:33 2015 UTC,The type of tournament you are talking about is single elimination by the way.
Skullgirls,38ldff,arandompurpose,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:17:58 2015 UTC,"The most common is called double elimination, where there's a winners and losers bracket. This gives you a chance if you lose to still be in the tournament for 1 more shot.  Skullgirls typical rule is for teams vs anything its no rounds and in 1v1 its 2 rounds (or downs, as some people call it, like street fighter downs).  From there its up to you if you wanna make each match on a bracket best of 3 ( You need to win 2) or best of 5 ( most finals do this, you need to win 3)  Use challonge for this"

Have you tried keyboard though? This is probably the most playable fighting game for keyboard that you'll ever find. The inputs are all quarter circles, DPs, and a few 360s, and MikeZ specifically programmed it to make it easy for hitbox and keyboard users. For example, with 360 inputs, you only have to input the 4 cardinal directions (no diagonals), and you can have 2 frames of the stick being at neutral in between each of the directions. That's super-lenient."

Skullgirls,38ho7o,Xelnastoss,7,Thu Jun 4 07:39:03 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, you're not going to see solos in competitive play. It's not necessarily that they're bad, in fact, if a solo goes up against a trio, each trio character might take two combos before they're down, it's just that you're gonna lack a lot of flexibility playing solo. Not having assists to pressure your opponent or to keep you safe with DPs can be very dangerous, and not being able to switch out of what you might feel is a bad matchup is pretty bad, at best. Some say that lately a lot of people have started playing Duos instead of Trios to get more damage and so on. The danger of course is that if you get double-snapped while playing a duo (In short, someone hits your assist character while its out and by performing a snapback, can get said assist character trapped in an infinite combo and killed) you've just lost half your team in an instant.  All in all, all three are doable. Most tournament players play with duos and trios, but solos work as well."
Skullgirls,38ho7o,Nodscouter,2,Thu Jun 4 09:50:06 2015 UTC,"As a note, I got bodied by Solo-Beowulf in an online tournament last weekend, and I'm considered a ""good player""."
Skullgirls,38ho7o,TheBigBruce,3,Thu Jun 4 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"I remember DeKillSage (one of the top players right now iirc) saying ""Solo is underrated, and no one plays a very good solo) Not to many people are worried about solos though. I think with the right character and the right combos and resets they can be deadly, since you can focus more on pressure once you get in than getting in at first, but duo seems to be popular at the moment."

Skullgirls,38ho7o,arly803,2,Thu Jun 4 19:59:07 2015 UTC,I am so ungodly bad at Big Band that I cannot love him.
Skullgirls,38ho7o,tstilly,2,Thu Jun 4 22:48:56 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you're looking for from your playstyle, trio gives most overall NET health meaning individually they're hp is weak but combined beats a solo's hp overall. Trio also gives you options with ensemble attacks and tag-out health regen, but you lose power with attacks. Duo is a good balance, but like already mentioned double-snaps are a pain. Now I'm advocating for Solo play here because if you really know your character and how to maneuver at will, block constantly and effectively, and how to take advantage of the smallest slip-up (even if the slip-up is yours) I think Solo character is VERY viable. If you do a snapback you get red health back! I mean C'mon!"
Skullgirls,38ho7o,jonmsanti,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:21:19 2015 UTC,"So, the primary benefit of playing solo is that each individual hit you land counts for a lot more damage.  This means if your neutral is rock solid and you have a solid set of resets, solo may be good for you.  This is really hard, so you don't see many good solo players.  Most solo players are new players trying to figure out which characters they like.  The only absolute top tier solo player I can think of is Fenster, though players like Devita and Zidiane are very good.    Duo is kind of the default choice for most players.  You get most of the benefits of a trio (assist and DHC options) with less of the drawbacks (lower individual health and damage).  The biggest weakness of duos is that they're a little more vulnerable to snaps (outtakes) and double snaps as they lose a more significant percentage of health from them.  Trios have the most flexibility and, oddly, the least margin for error.  It's very easy to just lose a character in a trio because of a mistake.  Off the top of my head, I know that Bella has a 2 meter touch-of-death combo in 1v3 ratios.  Probably Big Band and Squigly too.  It's really easy to look really dumb if you mess up blocking as a trio.  Virtual perfects happen.  The plus side of trios is that you have 2 assists and 2 DHC options.  I run a trio which lets me have a mixup assist, a lockdown assist, and a reversal assist.  Having 2 DHC also means you can suddenly crap out a ton of damage off a reversal without a full combo (not me though, my supers do bad damage).    Also, fwiw, Double and Bella are a really good pairing.  They offer each other useful assists (classically light bomber and heavy lock-n-load) and you get the easiest safe dhc + mixup in the game:  bella tumbling run into dynamo, dhc to catellites."
Skullgirls,38ho7o,weealex,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:55:45 2015 UTC,who is a good third for Double Bella? I like the movement and gliding of Valentine
Skullgirls,38ho7o,weealex,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"honestly, anyone.  They're a solid core and can jam whatever you like into the third slot.  You may have to tweak assists and team order, but you can do whatever.  Personally, I've been learning Val recently and my team is Val (c.mk), Double (light bomber), Bella (heavy LnL).  My general gameplay is pretty straight up stolen from Duckator.  Jump, call assist, double jump, throw shuriken.  Repeat until hits happen.  I don't get quite the same corner routes that Duck gets, but that's fine, this is my funsies team, doesn't need to be super optimal.    Val's big weakness is that her assist options kinda suck.  Her normal throw is good, c.mk is a 2 hit low, and specific teams can use heavy bypass for combo continuations, but that's about it.  Her alpha counter options are further limited by her not-so-great assists.    I guess she also has low damage output without lots of poison, but who cares?  It's all about the resets, and her mixup game is good."

Skullgirls,38jeze,shapular,2,Thu Jun 4 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"Not a fantastic Double player so I can't really give you some high-level analysis, but Double is a pretty good all-around characters. She can do some minor zoning and projectiles, but she's more of a heavy character who's very good at keeping you locked down, constantly pressuring and advancing, though she's not fantastically mobile compared to say, Filia or Fortune.  For your more specific questions, you can combo off of a HP Luger by dashing forward and then going from a standing or crouching light kick into a normal combo. Almost all throws can be comboed off of in Skullgirls, though some require you to spend meter or some other non-normal attack to do it. For Double specifically, you can combo off a ground throw using her command dash, Flesh Step, by inputting Quarter-Circle back and then any kick button. From there, you can pick up with a standing or crouching light kick for example. For her air grab, you can pick up using a normal dash and then, you guessed it, a standing or crouching light kick.  For partners, I would personally say that one of Double's main problems is her lack of mobility. Her flesh step is quick, but is vulnerable, especially against zoners like Peacock. Having someone like Big Band, Cerebella or Eliza on your team to provide armour or to get around zoners is an excellent move I've found, especially using Heavy Brass Knuckles on Big Band. Other good assists are generally the DP-inputs like Big Band's Beat Extend, Fortune's Fiber Uppercut or Filia's Updo, which can also double as anti-airs."

Canceling to jHK causes you to fall faster, allowing you to use cLK or grab unexpectedly fast.  Some assists are excellent for cross ups when used together with Flesh Step. It's hard to hit the assist if it's blocked too.  In the corner, sHK > jump back > jLK > jHK pulls them back out. You can use this for cross ups with Flesh Step, but be careful not to corner yourself.  Ending an air string with jHP or jHK gives you ample time to dash under, air grab, or do fancy stuff with assists.  Cat heads is a really good super to DHC into because it becomes level 1, does lots of chip, and provides lockdown while you try mixups."
Skullgirls,38jeze,Xelixi,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:29:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, welcome to the game and picking Double!  If you want some resources on Double check this link for some standard good combo's (Skullheart is really good for resources in general if you want to check it out further). Filia and Valentine are I believe good partners, I play her coupled with Eliza (dlc) sometimes as well and I enjoy using that. If you plan to use Double in a team her best assist would be Hornet Bomber (m).  I can help you further if you'd like just add me on steam. I'm not the best Double player out there, but I can maybe help you with some problems/combo's and just play with you in general."
Skullgirls,38jeze,Streloks,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:47:33 2015 UTC,"IMO, her 2 most important buttons in neutral are j.hp, and cr.lk. Both are outstanding normals, with great range, and can lead into full combos.   I find the most success with Double while using her as an anchor. Her hornet bomber assist is incredible, being able to DHC into her cat heads super for 1 meter instead of 2 is great, and I think she has the capability to take games back even after losing your other character(s)."

Skullgirls,38i8dj,blackrabt,6,Thu Jun 4 11:41:36 2015 UTC,Eliza is pretty safe until she hits the ground and uses any medium move. You have valentine. Grab a bitch!   Peacock is much more tricky to explain. You have to find the space in their patterns to get into. You can always do super jump>double jump>air dash to move up high if you're having difficulty close to the ground. I highly recommend staying close to the ground so you can better react when they do something silly.
Skullgirls,38i8dj,Krye07,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:24:06 2015 UTC,Thanks! I did seem to be having a little luck getting close when in the air but then she grabbed my head and slammed me into a wall with a stone tablet and I forgot what I was doing.  If I can stun her (like with Valentine's throw) long enough to start a decent combo I could probably make decent headway.
Skullgirls,38i8dj,Whalen207,2,Thu Jun 4 13:33:59 2015 UTC,With Fortune your approach is practically free. HK Fiber > Pop-Up > Delayed DJ > Air dash when possible and you'll clear 80% of the screen. If she's controlling the air use your great low dash to get there. Remember to stop and block projectiles. Val can react with lv.1 needle super to a lenny throw iirc  Also fortune best girl
Skullgirls,38i8dj,CK_Crash,2,Thu Jun 4 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"Eliza is tall and lacks anti-air, so she hates overheads. Her air-to-air is quite good, but you can challenge it with projectiles and air grab. Aim to put her in the corner, since she can't do much except Khepri Sun when she's under pressure.  Peacock is weak against grabs because she has to choose between hit invincibility and grab invincibility with her reversals. If she's using a keepaway assist, poke it before it goes offscreen to buy more time before it comes back."
Skullgirls,38i8dj,iPlaySkullgirls,2,Thu Jun 4 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"Keep pressure on Eliza, as she has no real good way to get you off of her once you're in. Especially when you're above her. Fortune's j.lk hits at a very difficult angle for Eliza to contest. If you can, bait out Horus before you go in, as it gives her a free combo off of hit.  Against Peacock, NEVER jump back. It's a mistake that a lot of people make when air george is coming at them. You avoid the chip, but she gets more space between you. You can jump forward and take the chip, or just neutral jump. If you neutral jump, you avoid chip, and keep your position. Once above the air bomb, you can airdish in if she doesn't call item drop. Alternatively, you can crouch under it if you're close enough and she doesnt have a george on the ground.  There is also a deadspot just above the ground that Peacock has a very difficult time hitting without the use of an assist. Valentine can abuse this really easily by doing savage bypass in the air, but very low to the ground. This could get stuffed by an assist, but it's hard for her to deal with on her own if she's not expecting it. Off of hit or block, you can cancel into knifes and either be safe or hitconfirm from it."
Skullgirls,38i8dj,Redditisquiteamazing,2,Thu Jun 4 19:57:45 2015 UTC,"Peacock is good at range, so get up in her face. I use Ms. Fortune's wheel of fortune kick to interrupt her attacks, and then hit her with some light and medium kicks and punches."

Skullgirls,38hpu6,literallycantsteven,6,Thu Jun 4 07:59:07 2015 UTC,"A raw tag is almost guaranteed to get you stuck in a combo and snapped/outtaken. If someone snaps you back to your original character, you lose all of the red health that you could have regenerated by switching out your character, meaning not only did you get trapped in a combo and lost a lot of the life on the character you tagged in, you also entirely wasted all the life you could have regenerated by tagging out safely using a DHC/Blockbuster Sequel.   Furthermore, there are some extra tidbits that you might want to know about spending the meter. For one thing, combos in Skullgirls scale in damage the longer the go on. So for example, if you start a combo with an attack that does say, 200 damage, at the end of the combo that same attack will do 40 or less. The longer a combo goes on the less damage each attack will do, down to 20% for attacks that do under 1000 damage. Now Blockbuster Sequels/DHCs reset that value to 80% when performed, and sometimes you can even combo off of the DHC. Meaning that DHCs are generally speaking a great way to get some extra damage to finish off a character, even if you don't need to switch out.  It's also worth noting that a DHC will reduce the amount of meter it takes to perform a super by 1, unless it's already 1. DHC-ing into a level 3 super only costs 2 bars, DHC-ing into a level 2 costs 1, DHC-ing into a level 5 costs 4 bars. Combined with DHC-ing resetting the damage scaling, DHCs can become a great way to pull out some unexpected damage on your opponent."
Skullgirls,38hpu6,Nodscouter,2,Thu Jun 4 10:01:38 2015 UTC,"So, just to tack onto this, there are often safe ways to just tag in a character, but it requires setups.  The most common are Squigly's ""Squigly Battle Opera"" or Double's ""Beast of Gehenna"", as they both set up safe zone that you can tag behind.  Also, several characters tags can be combo'd into.  The easiest one off the top of my head is Eliza.  If you do a launch then immediately tag into Eliza, her entrance will continue the combo.  EDIT:  Also, some DHC are safe on block.  This gives you a free-ish way to get a hurt point character out to recover some health"

Skullgirls,38hpu6,Monsyphon,2,Sat Jun 6 08:35:14 2015 UTC,"For the most part, switching characters with using 2 supers (DHC) is relatively safe and it can continue your combo with the right setup.   Raw tags can be punished at most ranges, you have to be far away or catch them off guard in some way to make a raw tag go unpunished"
Skullgirls,38hpu6,Adwins,2,Thu Jun 4 09:34:08 2015 UTC,"Raw tags are like a move with long startup/recovery, and thus very punishable in most circumstances.  Another option to switch out characters is the Alpha counter (forward + Tag during blockstun). It cost 1 meter but your assist comes out doing their assist move. safer than raw tags but still punishable depending on the situation and the assist move"
Skullgirls,38hpu6,Spookymank,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:59:46 2015 UTC,Alpha counter with Napalm Pillar assist sounds really strong then.
Skullgirls,38hpu6,shadowdude777,2,Fri Jun 5 06:22:42 2015 UTC,"Because when you spend 2 bars, your next character comes in with a super safety net. When you hard tag, you're left vulnerable and your next character gets big ouchies."
Skullgirls,38hpu6,omegareaper7,2,Thu Jun 4 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"Against some characters, a raw tag is never safe. For example, I don't think there's a single tag that Valentine couldn't respond to, even at fullscreen distance, with EKG Flatliner or (if it's something like Double's tag in, for example), blocking and just retaliating once they're in blockstun.  Even Cerebella's tag, which is probably the safest one, is not really safe. Eliza could respond with the Sekhmet super. Squigly could respond with Center Stage + Battle Opera. Beowulf could respond with the Grendel Arm super. And while tags like Beowulf's, Squigly's, and Double's are all tricky, if they're blocked, the opponent will full-combo you with no meter spent."
Skullgirls,38dkgn,M3YH3Mx,12,Wed Jun 3 14:56:49 2015 UTC,"I urge everyone interested to check out the Steam statistics here:  http://steamcharts.com/app/245170#48h  Since the game started its free weekend, we've gone from roughly 100 online players on average to over 3200. Based on the responses on this subreddit, a lot of players are interested in picking up the game what with the ridiculous discount. If even a fraction of these players stick around, we might just have witnessed the largest increase in Skullgirls activity we've had for a long time."
Skullgirls,38dkgn,Nodscouter,5,Wed Jun 3 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this was a fantastic move from Lab Zero especially right after combo breaker. Hopefully we get a lot of people to stick around."
Skullgirls,38dkgn,grandmasterthai,3,Wed Jun 3 17:31:27 2015 UTC,Just took a look at the charts and it's great to see that Skullgirls is getting more players. Hopefully this will get more people to join without the fear of getting bodied every single time they play online.
Skullgirls,38dkgn,Vecore,10,Wed Jun 3 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"Just a reminder, during this time of influx of new players, please show them the best our community has to offer! If you massacre them in QM, don't teabag or be an asshole. Don't go into new lobbies and just sandbag.   Be nice. Be supportive. Have fun.  Make them WANT to stay forever. ONE OF US. ONE OF US."

Skullgirls,38dkgn,cantinera,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in western Canada. Not a lot of lobbies in that area (from what I saw), so I just went on any server and rerolled until I got a match with good ping (don't know how frame delay works)."
Skullgirls,38euts,SEJIBAQUI,3,Wed Jun 3 19:20:46 2015 UTC,This same situation happened with me and a friend. Send it to them via email. They should be able to install it if you send it that way.
Skullgirls,38euts,KazeRyu32,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:05:55 2015 UTC,Yep I had the same issue... sending it via email then telling them to download it from the steam store should work
Skullgirls,38euts,TripleVitality,2,Sun Jun 7 21:23:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe they could try uninstalling it and maybe then you can gift it? I'll admit I'm not sure how free weekends interact with stuff like this, but even if you can't gift it now, you should have the gifts stored up so you can give it to them after the sale. So I suppose they could just download the free weekend, play it until it's not free any more, and then you could just gift them your copies and there shouldn't be any problem."
Skullgirls,38euts,Nodscouter,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:33:25 2015 UTC,It'll be unfortunate if I have to wait until after the sale.  I didn't buy any dlc and if my friends want it they won't have much time to get it on sale.
Skullgirls,38ekah,Nodscouter,2,Wed Jun 3 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"That's a much better description than what I normally write.  New players who just picked up the game, you guys are more than welcome to come participate. I hope we see a lot of new faces this week."
Skullgirls,388r3u,cantinera,22,Tue Jun 2 17:19:14 2015 UTC,"WAOW What a great sale, and what a great opportunity to plug a couple of beginner resources!  First and foremost, check out the awesome FAQ stickied at the top of this subreddit. Seriously. Do it now.  The Skullgirls community is what really got me into this game, they're unbelievably supportive of new players and all around awesome. Even if you usually only lurk, there are a couple of groups and events you should keep on your radar.  First I'll plug Get Good, an event I co-host with Waifu (/u/prime1153) on Sundays at 3:00 EST. Get Good is geared towards new and intermediate players working to learn the game. We work in a stream format where each player does a set of three games and receives critique and tips. Chat is friendly and we always love meeting new players so please, come on by!  Second is Slapfest, which runs Tuesday nights on Datagram's mumble server. Most weeks it's just a friendly environment to play in but about once a month (*cough *cough tonight), they get a top player in to teach a lesson on a character. This week is Parasoul.  If you're into beginner tournaments we've got you there too!  I Wanna Be the Skullgirl is run by Sharpie (/u/cantinera) Saturday evenings. It's something of a variety show with a lot of friendly faces in chat, go check it out even if you don't compete.  Another place to check out is the Skullgirls Weekly Tourneys group on steam. The tournaments are open to all skill levels, and run Fridays at 7:00 pm EST.  This comment turned out longer than expected so I might actually copy the contents into a full post. I'm certain I've missed stuff so please let me know what you think I should add so I can include it when I copy this over.  TL;DR The Skullgirls community is the best I've ever seen, come check it out."
Skullgirls,388r3u,Tommer,3,Tue Jun 2 21:49:42 2015 UTC,"Tommer knows what he's talking about and it's of course also worth mentioning that it's not just the streams and events that can help newer players, but most events also come with a steam group filled with new players that you can hit up and play with at any time. If you're feeling that quick match is too difficult for you (Which it often is), there's no problem with joining, say, Get Good just to find someone to play with."
Skullgirls,388r3u,Nodscouter,3,Tue Jun 2 22:37:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to participate in Get Good, check out this thread for details!"

Skullgirls,388r3u,Sabrewylf,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"It depends on the event, I can tell you for sure that Get Good accommodates EU players but you should ask the event coordinators for anything you're interested in. Everyone's super nice and supportive so definitely say hi!"

Skullgirls,388r3u,zanerz,3,Tue Jun 2 17:53:29 2015 UTC,Is it letting you install it or have you already installed it and can't get it to open?

I was playing Binding of Issac Rebirth and I scrolled down on my Steam Game library and saw that Skullgirls was availible for sale. Cue checking price, buying game, then all the DLC. This was only a few hours ago.   I've just watched Youtube playthroughs of story mode and looked at the online promo material. Now I've just started playing the game (starting on Ms.Fortune), stuck on Marie's battle...Lets put it this way, I've played with the top traditional arrow key joystick on my logitech rumblepad to the point where my thumb was raw, so I've moved to the left lower joystick. This is surprisingly effective, haven't beat marie yet (boss music from the skull girls minimized window is playing) but gotten pretty close.  Oh, if only I had a way to play games like these without placing myself at risk for carpal tunnel (and possibly a game controller version tennis players elbow with the way my arms been feeling). I grip things waaaaay too hard.  I know what I'm playing tomorrow after going to a music lesson.  Getting a mocha and two donuts to stay perked from Tim Hortons:D"

Skullgirls,388r3u,gerdski,3,Tue Jun 2 18:38:27 2015 UTC,The only reason to play the beta is for anything not currently in retail... which is planned to be there by Evo in July. Or so I've heard. The major stuff you'd be missing out on is Robo Fortune and Voice packs. I don't think there's anything else of notable significance in the beta at the moment.
Skullgirls,388r3u,gerdski,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:15:20 2015 UTC,What I meant is that I already have the beta installed. And I do want to play robo fortune if I can.

Skullgirls,38bqfl,gerdski,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:35:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe just having a ""chat"" option for recently played opponents (with an obligatory ""block/ignore"" option as well) to send messages of congratulations or requests for advice or tips would suffice?"

Skullgirls,38bqfl,BoatsandJoes,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:05:24 2015 UTC,"In my experience, when I add people that I've lost to, they usually accept (and I say good game, nice crossups or whatever, sometimes we play a few more). I added 5 people yesterday and 4 accepted or something like that.  However, if I add someone after beating them, I haven't had a single person accept yet. That's kinda backwards from the way I thought it would be, but that's what I've experienced in both Skullgirls and Street Fighter."

Skullgirls,389bj6,TheCrimsonJin,2,Tue Jun 2 19:08:13 2015 UTC,"It's not showing up in your library at all? In this case I find it hard to believe it'd be on the end of Skullgirls, especially cause these problems just started appearing with the free weekend and all. It's likely on steam's end, or a miscoordination between Lab 0 and Valve. Send a report to customer service and wait is probably the only thing you can do. I imagine it won't be long until this is fixed."
Skullgirls,389bj6,Nodscouter,3,Tue Jun 2 19:22:59 2015 UTC,"As of right now it's not in my Library, yes. Now that you mention it, I thought that was weird as Free Weekend Games are usually auto-added. Steam issue I guess."
Skullgirls,389bj6,Reggiardito,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:37:09 2015 UTC,I don't think the 'free WEEKEND' was supposed to release today. Must've been a fuckup on VALVe's part. Likely going to become available this friday like all free weekends.

Skullgirls,385mn6,digitalskyfire,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:37:27 2015 UTC,"Undizzy only triggers a burst at the start of a new chain, so the best combos (like this one) start their last chain just before undizzy hits 240 (the limit).

Skullgirls,3804rq,BabyEatingFox,10,Mon Jun 1 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"I think they're amazing. Peacock - overflowing with references. They'll need a dozen pages of citations at TV Tropes to parse them. Parasoul - The acting makes this one really good. The venom and inflection put into every phrase portrays a very bitter princess. From looking down on the Egrets (""Get them you idiots!"") to funny nicknames for tags (Filia is called ""Peasant"" and Valentine is called ""KNOCK-ERS!""). Double - Hilarious. However, the male voice reminds me heavily of how Dr. Doom is portrayed in Maximilian's Assist Me series. Big Band - Like Peacock, I don't get all the references (""Jive ass dude ain't got no brains anyhow"" - Airplane! quote), but it's great, but a bit short (seems like the smallest pack, with many normal quotes remaining). Painwheel - fantastic acting. Strange concept that really works great for someone used to grunting and screaming. Great contrast."

Dazed announcer is funny but the sheer amount of energy Cristina put into her lines makes me want to use the female announcer over Dazed.   I'm really not a fan of politician double, or valley girl painwheel at all I don't find them funny or intersting.  I think Salty parasoul and sxploiation big band are better because while I don't find them super interesting either, they are somwaht, but more importantly,, they feel a lot more grounded.  ANime peacock is somewhere between the two but it has tons of amazing and fantastic lines, so I think it's my favorite character voicepack, Also it has not one, not two, but 3 G Gundam References, which is 3 more then I expected."

Skullgirls,380qga,SC2Humidity,3,Mon Jun 1 00:19:00 2015 UTC,I dabble in double so this is my advice on barrel loops.   The lp/lk have to be pressed very quickly after you jump. Make sure you do both hits of j.Mk.    Parasoul is the easiest character to loop against so try practicing on her. If you need other help I'm on your friend's list so you can send me a message.
Skullgirls,380qga,Dalextable,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:52:43 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks...I think I might be doing neither of those things :D"
Skullgirls,380qga,Nodscouter,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:57:07 2015 UTC,"Also, try to do the Item Crash pretty much directly after the first hit of J.HK. For the the loop to work, the Avery projectile needs to not be hitting your opponent while you're item crashing.  And remember that barrel looping doesn't work on Big Band. You'll have to do some other combo on him."
Skullgirls,380qga,Hstherter,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:29:33 2015 UTC,I had trouble with it myself It doesn't work on Big Band if you didn't already know that You must do the barrel RIGHT and I really mean RIGHT as you press j.HK

Skullgirls,37y5yr,digitalskyfire,2,Sun May 31 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"That was actually a solid fanfic, better then most fanfics. I wish they made Beowulf somewhat more 'smart' in the real story. And I really like the fact that Beowulf had a lot of interactions with Parasoul in your version, being a national hero and all. The only part I had a problem with was the part with Double and Valentine.  “No mortal human shall have as much knowledge of the Trinity as you do. And because of that, you shall join them.” Well if Beowulf is a hobbyist librarian, and he found out that the skullheart has a connection with the Trinity, by READING BOOKS, well Double did a pretty terrible job at hiding that fact, while Double to me seems pretty reliable to do her job."
Skullgirls,37y5yr,Spieren,-1,Wed Jun 3 14:31:52 2015 UTC,"In the link, you can comment, but:   Don’t say that Beowulf is being “out of character” I changed Beowulf’s personality on purpose. I advise you to comment on grammar, the other character’s personalities, and illogical faults in general. I felt like I had difficulties with those. Don’t say which version of Beowulf’s Story Mode is better. OK, maybe you can, but don’t attempt to make an argument. I made up some of the lore, so don’t say that the lore shouldn’t happen unless there’s some illogical fallacy involved.   Thanks for reading. :)"

Skullgirls,37sca8,Spookymank,2,Sat May 30 03:01:38 2015 UTC,Fortune has always been a good solo character because of the head combos.

Skullgirls,37sca8,Gakuno,1 point,Sat May 30 00:39:27 2015 UTC,"Since you play Rolento, I think Parasoul would be a good solo.  They have similar moves (ie jumping HP) with Parasoul also having fireballs and overheads and standing lows.  Squigly's okay, but I think she's stronger with another character.  She works well when she has meter and can set up her Seria charge.  Doing it alone is hard."

Skullgirls,37sfe2,Prime1153,2,Sat May 30 01:22:37 2015 UTC,yep
Skullgirls,37sfe2,Prime1153,3,Sat May 30 01:40:32 2015 UTC,"Give Parasoul a try. Napalm Shot is a good projectile, and Napalm Pillar is essentially a DP. Parasoul also has some nice tools like overheads and her Egrets. The one issue with learning Parasoul is that she has a lot of inputs to learn. If you have a tough time with charge characters, Parasoul might not be a good fit.  Filia might also be an option. Her playstyle is faster and more aggressive than Parasoul's. Updo is just as good of a move as Napalm Pillar, but her projectile doesn't compare to Napalm Shot. I started off with Filia and still use her.  Between the two, I'd say that Parasoul is a better choice, especially as a solo character. There's a lot to learn if you want to play Parasoul, but all of those tools are really valuable once you master them. Filia is easier to start off with, but you'll eventually have to put her onto a team to compensate for her weaknesses."
Skullgirls,37sfe2,Prime1153,1 point,Sat May 30 02:00:41 2015 UTC,charge characters aren't my strength but I'll give her a spin.

Skullgirls,37sfe2,Ontrevant,2,Tue Jun 2 08:37:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I noticed that and the animations really help time them out.
Skullgirls,37sfe2,SneakNSnore,3,Tue Jun 2 18:31:33 2015 UTC,Filia is a good beginner character imo. She has a standard uppercut thats shoto-esque.

Skullgirls,37dmhm,MasterE_Reddit,1 point,Tue May 26 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"This is actually kind of difficult.  The PC version runs better than Ps3/Xbox (no need for 8 bit transitions), has beta so you can play around with new stuff early (Robo fortune, stages etc), has a large player base, more options for controls, and has lobbys. If it was between ps3, xbox and PC the clear answer is PC.   The only issue is the Ps4 version is probably going to have all the stuff in beta now, run just as well as PC, its also going to add challenge mode, and it will have fully acted story modes. That stuff may come to pc as dlc down the road but it is not confirmed yet.   If you get the PC version you can start playing the game immediately but In the future you may want to play ps4 because it will probably become tournament standard. My friend who doesn't have it yet is waiting for ps4 version since he usually play fighters on console and they want all the dlc at once."

Skullgirls,37dmhm,shadowdude777,1 point,Wed May 27 23:00:50 2015 UTC,Its easier to get and more convenient to setup for TOs to buy a PS4 than build a PC. It would be cheaper too to use a PS4 since a lot of other games now will be using PS4 versions as tournament standard.
Skullgirls,37dmhm,Gingerositee,1 point,Wed May 27 23:05:41 2015 UTC,"That's not what I'm saying. How, in any conceivable way, will the PS4 version, in local vs mode, run any differently than the PC version?   (I already know the answer of course. It won't. But I can't understand why people think this is not the case)."
Skullgirls,37dmhm,Ontrevant,1 point,Wed May 27 23:13:23 2015 UTC,I don't know what he means by that honestly...
Skullgirls,37dmhm,Gingerositee,1 point,Wed May 27 23:41:28 2015 UTC,"Computers aren't standard, but consoles are, not saying PCs are shitty, it's just that fighting games are at home on console."

Skullgirls,377t17,Dalextable,6,Mon May 25 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"I think you can just hop in and start playing without any issues. Besides, if you have the PC version, you have access to the beta, so you can try out all the new changes before they make it to console."
Skullgirls,377t17,Prime1153,5,Mon May 25 16:30:56 2015 UTC,No.
Skullgirls,377t17,3DPK,3,Mon May 25 20:15:08 2015 UTC,"2nd encore is adding challenge mode, fully voiced story, and aesthetics that are similar to the pc version. Balance and characters are not a thing that is planned for the initial release of 2nd encore (compared to pc beta that is). Mechanically it should feel like the pc version so just play that until second encore comes out. Maybe you can just skip single player content until 2nd encore."
Skullgirls,377t17,MasterE_Reddit,1 point,Tue May 26 06:06:56 2015 UTC,"Additionally with the beta on PC and the fact that they ported to PC once, that makes things more likely for the 2nd encore port to be faster, right?"
Skullgirls,377t17,LoverIan,1 point,Tue May 26 10:11:16 2015 UTC,If you play the Beta (which you have access to since you have it for PC) that is the newest stuff.  No new characters or balance patches will be going to PS4 for 2nd Encore that aren't in the beta.

Skullgirls,3739gb,MegidoJo,1 point,Mon May 25 01:01:18 2015 UTC,"I see. In intermediate to advanced Peacock isn't good solo, her combos use assists from her team if she wants to do decent damage.  Video is still pretty funny though, I wasn't sure if it lasted as long as Cerebella's grab super."
Skullgirls,3739gb,Dalextable,2,Mon May 25 02:04:50 2015 UTC,Peacock has very good damage solo and does not rely on assists to deal upwards of 9k damage bnbs. Solo peacock just lacks the safety to be a reliable solo.

It was a reaction to the style of films Sidney Poitier was... Oh god my film classes are coming back to haunt me.   Just think ""urban"", Funk, and 70s and you will get a gist of the style."
Skullgirls,37207a,autowikibot,1 point,Tue May 26 06:23:28 2015 UTC,"Blaxploitation:       Blaxploitation or blacksploitation is a film genre that emerged in the United States in the 1970s. It is considered an ethnic subgenre of the general category of exploitation films. Blaxploitation films were originally made specifically for an urban black audience, although the genre's audience appeal soon broadened across racial and ethnic lines. The term itself is a portmanteau of the words ""black"" and ""exploitation,"" following upon the briefly-common use ""sexploitation"" for porn-inflected films, and was coined in the early 1970s by the Los Angeles National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) head, and ex-film publicist Junius Griffin. Blaxploitation films were the first to regularly feature soundtracks of funk and soul music as well as primarily black casts.  Variety credited Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, released in 1971, with the invention of the blaxploitation as well as the less radical Hollywood-financed film Shaft, also released in 1971.

Alternatively you could try using a wired internet connection instead of a wireless one. Does your friend live in another country or something? That could be a problem too. Make sure the internet is working properly on his end too. Unfortunately if you still can't get all of this to work your best option would be to buy the game on PC as that version has a MUCH better network than the Xbox version, it seems. That and the PC version's player base is a lot bigger too.  The game is 75% off at Humble Bundle right now so if you're going to go PC, might as well go now."
Skullgirls,372lxa,LOTO-12,1 point,Sun May 24 16:03:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried with a wired network yet, so I'll start with that. I didn't honestly think it would be that sort of issue when I'm able to play any other game just fine with a wireless internet router. But if it might fix it then it's certainly worth a shot.  As to the rest of it, I already have the PC version but I can't ask him to spend more money after he already paid for the game once. Even if I could ask him, I doubt I could convince him. He prefers consoles. Plus he'd probably just say what I'm about to say in the next paragraph.  Tbh, there NEEDS to be a way for this to work. When a function doesn't function, the person in charge of the function is supposed to fix it. How bad have things gotten now that we can't even reasonably expect that much of our developers anymore? Surely if wiring my connection doesn't fix the problem, and there really are no other possible solutions, then the next step would be to try to write the devs directly, right? I'm prepared to go that far if I have to, and of course I'll be super polite. But there can't not be an answer, that's simply unacceptable.  ...Not that I'm assuming it's an issue on their end. It could just be that I need to wire it like you said. I'll post an update once I've given that a shot."
Skullgirls,372lxa,LOTO-12,1 point,Sun May 24 17:25:29 2015 UTC,"Lab Zero is a VERY busy, understaffed and criminally underfunded group of incredibly talented people who put all of their love, blood, sweat and tears into this game. Believe me when I say if they could snap their fingers and fix it they absolutely would. Unfortunately, it's not that simple and if the issues are on your end or your friend's end there's nothing they can do."
Skullgirls,372lxa,LOTO-12,1 point,Sun May 24 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"Whoa whoa whoa. I'm not saying anything that contradicts any of that. Calm down. All I'm saying is that if there is a problem on their end (which I indicated when I said ""if wiring my connection doesn't fix the problem, and there really are no other possible solutions"") then I do feel it would be reasonable to expect them to be willing to try to remedy said problem, should somebody bring it to their attention. That's all I'm saying. I didn't even say that I expected them to fix it immediately. And I never said I expected them to fix a problem that truly is on our end. The third paragraph was quite clearly a hypothetical. Because if the problem is on our end, then there are still ""possible solutions"" that we just haven't found yet. I'm sorry if I sounded like I was being mean to them, I didn't mean for it to come off that way. I'm just a guy who's trying to get his game working, that's all."

Skullgirls,370r55,LOTO-12,4,Sat May 23 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"The latest big patch was the wolf patch. For all the changes check here. If you just want the big band stuff:   Added an original HUD portrait, replacing a reused animation frame.  Fixed various effect colors in certain palettes.  Increased the size of the burst visual effect from Big Band’s Infinity Breaker.  j.LK now behaves like a standard multi-hit high normal attack; the first hit that makes contact always forces a block direction and any subsequent hits can be blocked as mid.  Beat Extend received the following changes:  Lowered blockstun on all strengths for the initial hits, reducing the attack’s effectiveness as a lockdown Ensemble Attack.  Big Band can no longer shake for additional hits after the initial hits are blocked by the enemy point character, even if he hit an Ensemble character.  Changed the launch height for Big Band Outtake to prevent a bug when used against an Ensemble character. Thanks to 5uilliam.  Noise Cancel received the following changes:  Big Band can jump during the recovery animation after a successful parry.  Parrying Filia’s Gregor Samson now prevents Filia from passing through Big Band.  Fixed a bug preventing Big Band from starting a Noise Cancel from pre-block, block idle, and post-block frames. Thanks to Adeveis.  Fixed a bug where parrying certain moves would force Big Band into a standing animation in the air. Thanks to Ninja.  Fixed a bug that allowed unintentional Noise Cancels after certain Ensemble Attacks.  Take the A Train received the following changes:  LK version is now properly throw invulnerable on the active frame.  MK and HK versions startup -3f.  The kara cancel window from j.HK to the HK version of Cymbal Clash has been increased from 3f to 6f, further preventing unwanted j.HKs when performing the special with sloppy motions.  Super Sonic Jazz received the following changes:  The armor on a taunt-boosted SSJ now ends at the beginning of the final punch instead of during the recovery.  Gap on block between rapid punches and final attack of the taunt-boosted version increased from 1f to 5f.  TUBA TUBA! can now cancel to a Blockbuster Sequel after the final hit.  Fixed a Training Mode only bug where the Blockbuster could get stuck in an endless loop. Thanks to Huffy.  Fixed an error in the ceiling-check script during Tympani Drive.  Satchmo Solo’s input has been made slightly easier: the down input can now be held after the LK input and the LP+MP input does not require both buttons to be pressed on the exact same frame.  And yes, Fukua was nerfed a bit."

Skullgirls,36x798,me-tan,2,Sat May 23 02:18:53 2015 UTC,"It would probably be better to just buy a new stick when you want to upgrade. You can replace the parts on it but it's very inconvenient to do so. The button holes are 28mm as opposed to 30mm so you would have to file each hole to get new buttons to fit, and if you accidentally go too far, you're kinda screwed. The buttons also just have little plungers on the bottom of them that make contact with a daughter board beneath them. So you would have to desolder the daughter board, wire up all of the new buttons manually, and solder them to the main pcb. Mounting a JLF requires hacking away at some of the internals as well. Overall it's just more trouble than it's worth."

Skullgirls,36qql2,StillApony,2,Fri May 22 00:13:16 2015 UTC,"chairless, you can do basically anything into s.HP or j.HP. with chair you can only OTG c.MK, like after a j.HK or MP chair toss for example, or command grab after linking into s.HK for the stagger. dash MP into s.HK works well, but you can also land it after a nice deep jump-in.  basically, you need a stagger or an OTG to combo into grab mode, unless youre chairless"

Skullgirls,36nlpg,ANinjaNamedSlickback,1 point,Wed May 20 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, both work remarkably well together.  Valentine's schtick is that she doesn't do that much damage but builds meter like crazy, and Eliza is extremely meter-hungry.  Work in assists and DHCs to your combos, and you have a real funky duo that works well together."
Skullgirls,36nlpg,MnemonicJohnny,1 point,Wed May 20 19:33:19 2015 UTC,Thats almost like one of my marvel 3 teams lol. Second time in a row that I play a battery and a heavy hitting anchor.
Skullgirls,36nlpg,RadagastTheBrownie,1 point,Wed May 20 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember about teams is that either of your characters may die, so you'll need to be ready to main either one.  Unfortunately, I've taken this perspective too far, and I'm very bad about using my assists, so I effectively play as separate, disjointed solos.  Being able to switch tactics on the fly is pretty handy, though.  Based on this, you might find Valentine and Eliza to be too similar.    Val's faster but weaker than Eliza, and her normals don't extend as far.  Her projectile or dash could quickly cover a lot of space outside Eliza's normal range.  Unfortunately, I'm not very familiar with all of Val's tricks.  That grab special of hers might also be a useful interrupt.    Eliza: Osiris Spiral's a nice interrupt for ""Surprise!  I'm hitting you, and now I'm over here.""  Butcher's Blade can do similar, with armor, but is even easier to interrupt and spends meter.  cHK is an armored sweep, but also pretty slow to start up and I never found it to be very practical.  Bird or Couch could also be useful for area denial.    Really, though, play whatever's you enjoy, and you'll find a use for it.  For instance, I picked Cerebella's ""Devil Horns"" because they amused me, but slowly over time I've learned to use them for a surprise hit while I'm in the air.    I hope this helps!"
Skullgirls,36nlpg,RadagastTheBrownie,2,Wed May 20 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I've taken this perspective too far, and I'm very bad about using my assists   This was me when I first started playing lol. Since I couldn't figure out how to configure my buttons correctly when i was on pad i would play with a single character but i always got whooped on by people with 3. After I got a stick tho I couldn't get my buttons mapped correctly for tags with 3 so i settled for 2 character teams.  I was planning on using Eliza's Doom rocks-like assist to help Valentine's pressure game. Think that would work?"
Skullgirls,36nlpg,StillApony,1 point,Wed May 20 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"Aye, that could work.  Lot of chip there, covers a good amount of area.  Effective assists seem integrated into people's combos while distracting me from point, and Osiris/Doom does that pretty well."

Skullgirls,36nlpg,shadowdude777,1 point,Wed May 20 19:46:54 2015 UTC,"My main question is I want to know if there is any synergy between them.   Don't worry too much about this. Skullgirls is pretty good about letting you use whoever you want.   As for what assist to use it really depends what you want I'm not the most knowledgeable as I usually play solos and never play Eliza.   For Val: Low attacks tend to make good assists, but you could use grabs, to catch people off guard. Valentine has a good one for this, as you can combo easily off of it. You could also go with something that has a bit of range to it (dead cross, heavy dash attack. Etc.) since I think Eliza has a bit of a zoning game, and this could help keep the pressure on.  I'm really not sure whats best for Elizas play style as no one I know plays her, but I'm sure people will have better suggestions.  For Eliza: I think for best synergy with valentine a good low attack would be ideal. Valentines game is cross ups, and a good low attack assist can make them safer, and can land you a good high, low crossup reset, with the right timing."
Skullgirls,36nlpg,Krye07,1 point,Wed May 20 19:44:21 2015 UTC,"Background: I've played Valentine and Squigly since PC launch, picked up Cerebella later on, and now also run Eliza (usually in place of either Squigly or Bella).  Valentine and Eliza work very well together. As said below, Val is a battery and Eliza can go through meter like nobody's business. One of their weaknesses, though, is a lack of good reversals. Valentine has nothing with i-frames that you can use, and her only anti-air is the first hit of s.HK. And Eliza only has Upper Khat (which is also still vulnerable to throws) and Sekhmet moves. So while they have absolutely monstrous momentum, they aren't good at reversing the pressure to be back on their side, especially if your Eliza is short on meter.  If you ever add a third character, you might want to throw in someone like Filia with Updo assist, Parasoul with Napalm Pillar, etc."
Skullgirls,36nlpg,shadowdude777,1 point,Wed May 20 22:06:10 2015 UTC,I like c.MP for anti air with Val. Makes her low profile a lot!
Skullgirls,36nlpg,Krye07,1 point,Thu May 21 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"Good tip, never really used c.MP as an anti-air. Will try that out more."
Skullgirls,36nlpg,brocoder,1 point,Thu May 21 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"It's great because it's multi hit, and pretty easy to recognize hit or block to confirm off of."
Skullgirls,36nlpg,shadowdude777,1 point,Thu May 21 18:15:37 2015 UTC,"Val c.MP is a better anti-air normal than s.HK, imo. And Eliza has s.MP, which is probably the best anti-air normal in the game."
Skullgirls,36nlpg,brocoder,1 point,Thu May 21 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"s.MP is not bad but the hurtbox kind of makes it less useful in my opinion.  EDIT: Disregard, I am wrong."

Skullgirls,36nlpg,brocoder,1 point,Thu May 21 16:19:18 2015 UTC,"Oh! I don't know why I thought the whole thing was a hurtbox. I was probably just assuming that since it's one of her blood attacks, and those usually have hurtboxes over all of the hitboxes, it acted the same way. My mistake."
Skullgirls,36nlpg,LOTO-12,1 point,Thu May 21 17:28:31 2015 UTC,np; somewhat reasonable assumption.  I didn't even know it was actually upper-body invincible until Mike showed the hitboxes on UltraChen.
